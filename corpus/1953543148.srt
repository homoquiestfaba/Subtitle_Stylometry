1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,004
?

2
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,329
Hurry, Yoli.

3
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,668
(loud music)

4
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,523
<i>Mari, I'm hungry.</i>

5
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:48,327
<i>Ok, I'm coming, but you're</i>
<i>missing out on my moves.</i>

6
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,406
Whoa, shit!

7
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,361
(School bell rings)

8
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,699
Why'd you leave, girl?

9
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,134
It got good.

10
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,569
I stayed for a little bit.

11
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,670
It was tight, huh?

12
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,704
It was sick!

13
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,573
So then let's go again today?

14
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,408
Again...It's Tuesday.

15
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,909
Everyday's a Friday for her.

16
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,479
Everyday is like beans
without salt for her, ok?

17
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,546
You know what? That's not cool.

18
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,714
Is that my lipgloss?

19
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,983
It'd better not be my lipgloss.

20
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,952
Mom gave it to me...
Mom gave it to me.

21
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,454
How many times do I have
to tell you! It's mine!

22
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,589
Stop lying, it's mine!

23
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,124
I don't want you
going through my stuff.

24
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,934
I can sweep, mop,
and break down boxes.

25
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,970
Young lady, I don't need
help right now.

26
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,838
I'm only asking for
twenty a day.

27
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,042
Twenty for me goes a long way.
You don't believe me?

28
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:11,743
<i>Good day, Don Pedro!</i>

29
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,045
Dona Herlinda!

30
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:14,813
<i>What's new?</i>

31
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,615
(Don Pedro) You want produce?

32
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:17,549
Or gossip?

33
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,917
(Dona Herlinda) Both.

34
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,734
He's looking.

35
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,771
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

36
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,913
What is your friend's name?

37
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,115
Yolanda, what is
your friend's name?

38
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,050
She's not my friend, Don Pedro.

39
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,987
Damn it.

40
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,028
Olivia!

41
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,673
Olivia!

42
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:10,128
(Students chattering)

43
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,764
I was just talking about
alternate angles.

44
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,966
Interior, exterior. Ok?
They're all congruent.

45
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,535
Mr. G!

46
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,136
I'll be right with you.

47
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:18,937
We're going to go over it.

48
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,005
Mr. G!

49
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,540
It looks great, Yolanda.

50
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,880
Let's keep looking
at these over here.

51
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,550
You do understand this, right?

52
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,084
- Yes?
- Yes.

53
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,653
Yes?

54
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,758
Ok, Mari Rodriguez...
You're gonna have to share

55
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,960
until I get a copy
of the textbook.

56
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,095
Yolanda, can you share
your textbook with her

57
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,964
and help her catch up?

58
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,066
And you're going to have
to turn that over.

59
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,167
It's off.

60
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,969
<i>(Students Ooh and Ahh)</i>

61
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,138
Ok, ok, relax.

62
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,940
Just make it disappear, ok?

63
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,656
What?

64
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,060
Nothing, you're my neighbor
is all.

65
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,795
And?

66
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,231
Do I owe you something?

67
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,266
I'm just saying.

68
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,670
You look like a little fly.

69
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,739
Pinche mosquita.

70
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,811
<i>I'm working on getting</i>
<i>your homework posted online.</i>

71
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:36,147
Tomorrow, I do not want to hear,
"What was the homework, Mr. G?"

72
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,652
<i>I love the excitement.</i>

73
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,957
Wait, Cuata. I'm putting it
on my left eye.

74
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,093
That means you got to
put it on your right.

75
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,895
So did you guys
check out the new girl?

76
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,730
What's up with
that freakin' attitude?

77
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,965
Trying to act all tough and shit
in front of everyone.

78
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,800
Please. I think she's trouble.

79
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,869
You don't even know her, Vicky.

80
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,339
Just saying. It must suck being
new at a big ass school.

81
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,974
People can be rude and stuff.

82
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,378
Here you go again with that
holy santita bullshit.

83
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,147
It's getting real old.
I left that back in junior high.

84
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,382
I'm just saying.

85
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,918
Well, get over it.
That's what I'm saying.

86
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,857
Don't trip off her girl.
She's just feeling off and shit.

87
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,292
Yeah, I guess.

88
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,093
(School bell rings)

89
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,030
She's just bitchy right now

90
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,065
cuz she started her period
and I didn't.

91
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,417
(School bell rings)

92
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,998
What's up with Mr. G?

93
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,800
Why does he always
give us a lot of homework?

94
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,436
I don't know, man.
I don't know what's up.

95
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,775
This is geometry.
He has to calm down.

96
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,179
Shit, you're smoking
a joint, Yoli?

97
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,180
Right, Cuata?

98
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,414
Dude, it smells like weed.

99
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,216
Maybe that's how
her number two smells.

100
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,085
You're so stupid!

101
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,722
<i>Hey!</i>

102
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,960
What the hell?

103
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,428
You think you're
some kind of hot shit?

104
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,097
I am hot shit, dumbass.

105
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,466
Crazy bitch!

106
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,267
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

107
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,937
Alright, who's got it?

108
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,772
Hey, don't look at me.

109
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,142
We don't know either.

110
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,746
Let's just see
what the office knows.

111
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,956
Mari.

112
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,791
Thank you.

113
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,160
Thanks for pushing me
out in time.

114
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,495
My parents would have
freaked out

115
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,463
over something like this.

116
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,234
So what'd the Dean say?

117
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,969
I flushed that roach
down the toilet

118
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,938
so all they could do is warn me;
next time I'm out.

119
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,342
Yeah. They said I could
make it easier on myself

120
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,779
if I just drop out
and get my GED.

121
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,180
They're stupid.

122
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,016
It's not that crazy.

123
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,119
But what about college?

124
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,354
It's a waste of time.

125
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,389
It's not a waste of time.

126
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,458
It is for me.

127
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,963
Look, after school
we can meet up.

128
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,799
We'll go through
my Geometry book

129
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,434
and go over
whatever other stuff.

130
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,402
History, English...

131
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:48,073
Weekdays are good.
Weekends too.

132
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,555
One of that.

133
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,166
Thank you.

134
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,956
I don't know about studying
on the weekends.

135
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:20,098
You know, if you do good,
it's like the biggest...

136
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,602
Even if you don't go to college,
just imagine having the chance

137
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,405
to shove those grades
in their faces.

138
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,607
They'd feel so stupid.

139
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,944
I have all the homework.
We can start today.

140
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,514
You know you don't
owe me shit, right?

141
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,349
I know.

142
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,968
Mama!

143
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,102
Can I go to my friend's house?

144
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,205
She lives across the street.

145
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:14,652
Please? We have classes together
and we're going to study.

146
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,487
Ok, but don't be too late.

147
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:32,437
(Music plays from the TV)

148
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,005
(TV turns off)

149
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,073
After homework.

150
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,040
Please Mari?

151
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,375
Nope!

152
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,326
We should play some Ska
while doing our homework.

153
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,461
You won't be able to focus.

154
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,363
Yeah, but it'll make it fun.

155
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,638
Hello, my daughter.

156
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,172
Hello.

157
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,709
We're offering cereal
to our guests?

158
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,780
Well, it's not like
we have steak to offer.

159
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,516
Here, steak doesn't last.

160
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,552
You'll have to come real
early before it's all gone.

161
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,026
Can I talk to you
for a second, Mari?

162
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,139
While I was working all day,

163
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:44,075
you couldn't find it in you
to unpack a few boxes.

164
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,511
I'm tired.

165
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,245
What's that?

166
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,513
What's what?

167
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,048
That smell. Are you smoking?

168
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,750
No. Damn!

169
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,230
You ok?

170
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,737
I found it in my mom's drawer.

171
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,219
You look nice, Mari.

172
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,654
Yeah?

173
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,558
Yeah.

174
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,611
<i>Mari! Mom wants you</i>
<i>to move some boxes.</i>

175
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,386
Mom's calling you.

176
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,903
How did it go
at the neighbor's house?

177
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,340
I asked, how was your time
at the neighbor's?

178
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,409
Fine.

179
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,286
Let's break up into groups.
You three, Chapter 10.

180
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,322
You three in the middle,
Chapter 11.

181
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:45,923
Chapter 10 on the outside.

182
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:49,460
You three also Chapter 11
and Chapter 10.

183
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,296
Oops.

184
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:52,997
Douche!

185
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,432
Skank!

186
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,702
She's calling you.

187
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,391
Hop on already!

188
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,659
Hold on.

189
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,028
But not too tight.
Just like that.

190
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,530
Alright.

191
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,000
No, no, no, no, no!
Wait! My turn, my turn!

192
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,302
- You better not drop me!
- I'm not! I'm not!

193
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,537
- Promise.
- I promise.

194
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,609
I hope you end up
liking Huntington Park.

195
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,344
Why wouldn't I?

196
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,480
Cuz sometimes the air
smells like pan dulche

197
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,348
and others say
it smells like chemicals.

198
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,752
Or like the Las Cuatas say,
"It smells like ass."

199
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,322
Holy...

200
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,857
Are you okay?

201
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,625
What did I say!

202
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,294
Alright, that's enough.

203
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,963
Oh, shit. It's open.

204
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,998
We should go, Mari.

205
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,700
Come on, Mosquita.

206
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,591
"I love Chuy."

207
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,562
"Hydo Y Rusbi por vida."

208
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,602
"Guera Y Chaparra
friends forever."

209
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,845
"Mosquita y Mari."

210
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,748
Fuck the rest.

211
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,054
Whenever anybody
gets on our nerves,

212
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,456
this'll be our
"kick it" spot.

213
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,057
This is private property, Mari.

214
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,659
We can't just make it our own.

215
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,462
It's not like anybody's gonna
come here anytime soon.

216
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,866
"Smurf is my man.
All bitches stay away."

217
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:12,036
Yeah, you fight for your
little blue man, dumbass.

218
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,880
I bet you that guy Smurf
got his name

219
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,750
from wearing his
ugly-ass shorts.

220
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,120
What?

221
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,121
Nothing.

222
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,555
Smurfette.

223
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,591
Oh, hell, no!

224
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,500
Gotcha.

225
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,080
Look, you can do the recording

226
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,149
and me and Vera
can do the rest. Ok?

227
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,852
We're going to be doing
a random survey. Right, Cuata?

228
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,054
Yeah, random survey.

229
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,622
But what kinda survey?

230
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:06,490
Just press this button
to record, ok?

231
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,660
questioning your long-term
friends about shit?

232
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,031
So here we are
at my high school.

233
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,933
And we're gonna be
doing a random survey

234
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,168
where we're get
to ask guys

235
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,437
if they've ever
popped a boner in school.

236
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,038
Ay, Cuata.

237
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,773
What? It's just a question!

238
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,943
Anyways, we get to talk
to some cute-ass guys.

239
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,747
Or what? You don't
want to talk to them?

240
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,016
I never said that.

241
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,951
Well, then record me.

242
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,525
Hey! Have you guys ever
popped a boner in school?

243
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,093
No.

244
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,128
Whatever. Liars!

245
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,665
I don't know.
Maybe once or twice?

246
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,867
I don't know.

247
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,803
(whispering) No way.
And how did you hide it?

248
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,140
Come on. Can you stop
asking me that?

249
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,512
Hey, have you ever
popped a boner in school?

250
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:03,114
Yeah, when I saw your mom.

251
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,648
Your mom, bitch.

252
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,519
I'll probably just block it
with these books. Like this.

253
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,821
Wouldn't it hurt?

254
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,556
Uh, I don't think so.

255
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,125
What about, like
if you need to stand up,

256
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,227
like, the teacher tells you to
write something on the board?

257
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,129
I'll carry my books like this.

258
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,498
Oh, my god, I know him!

259
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,732
Go ask him, Yoli!

260
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,667
- I'm not gonna ask him!
- Go ask him!

261
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,137
Dude, stop acting
like that again.

262
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,109
Hey, she has something
she wants to tell you.

263
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:34,979
Well...

264
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,213
What?

265
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,850
Have you ever
popped a boner at school?

266
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,219
Yeah.

267
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,621
How about right now?

268
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:47,224
Vicky, just turn it off already!
It's getting boring.

269
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,126
I was going to anyway. Damn!

270
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,529
I'm sorry. That was stupid.

271
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,661
When two angles
and a side of a triangle

272
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:27,131
are congruent to two angles
and a side of a second triangle,

273
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,567
what does that prove?

274
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,569
I didn't get that far
in the book.

275
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:34,672
Just remember "ass,"
like in culo,

276
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,740
but spelled A-A-S.

277
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,709
It stands for Angle-Angle-Side.

278
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,344
Easy, huh?

279
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,114
The culo theorem. Got it.

280
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,862
Look, stupid.

281
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,733
Those sissies
suppose to inspire us?

282
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,001
It's better than,

283
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,303
"Smurf is my man,
all bitches stay away."

284
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,139
I'll go with
the little blue man.

285
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,109
It's not that bad.

286
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,080
Olivia, do you want
something to eat?

287
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,348
Yes!

288
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,886
There's a pot in here.

289
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,254
Should I take it out?

290
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,335
Know what they called her?

291
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,037
Guadalupe la frutera.

292
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,973
Don't move
or you will end up

293
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,376
like your father
on our wedding day.

294
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,411
You used to cut Dad's hair?

295
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,413
But he wasn't the first.

296
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:52,383
I grabbed the scissors
when I was 10.

297
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:58,389
And later, I got my
cosmetology certificate

298
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,358
to help people look
even more beautiful.

299
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,660
And?

300
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,195
And things change.

301
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,998
But why did they change?

302
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,135
Because that's how it is.

303
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:13,971
I'll do it.

304
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,881
The grading scale
is on the board.

305
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,426
Mari...

306
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,294
Forget this shit.

307
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,363
It just means we have
to work a little harder.

308
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,333
I'll meet you at the shop
so don't even trip.

309
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:43,901
We can't meet up?

310
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:46,937
I have some stuff to take care
of for my mom, you know.

311
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,372
Maybe later.

312
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,241
Yeah, ok.

313
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,930
- Hey.
- Hey.

314
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,467
How long you going to be
doing that on Pacific?

315
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,804
As long as it takes.

316
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:56,774
Why you getting like
all gloomy and shit?

317
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,276
Not even. Stupid.

318
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,811
Stupid.

319
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,116
We're gonna meet
at the shop tomorrow?

320
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,786
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll make it work.

321
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,856
I'm just saying...

322
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,127
I know, Yoli.
But it's not all I'm about.

323
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,230
(TV plays in the background)

324
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,998
And your homework?

325
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,300
I'm going to do it right now.

326
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,936
That's good.

327
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,435
Ok, stop.

328
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,941
Stop! Stop!

329
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,514
Stop.

330
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:46,150
First tell me what
you're thinking about.

331
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,484
Nothing...

332
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,887
Just about my parents.

333
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,288
What about them?

334
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,125
I was remembering this one day,
awhile back.

335
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,395
My dad put on this CD he bought
off this guy on Pacific.

336
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,099
He put it on then went and
pulled out this old cowboy hat

337
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:04,234
I've never seen him in.

338
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,403
Then he approached my mom

339
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:09,239
and then they waltzed
around the room...

340
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:11,241
Not caring about their usual,

341
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,443
resting up for work
the next day.

342
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,582
It was like they were
somewhere else for that moment.

343
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,121
It was kinda beautiful.

344
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,595
You think too much.

345
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,578
Come on, scaredy-cat.

346
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,597
What about your father?

347
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:18,135
He died.
Some sort of accident...

348
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,571
He used to drive one of those
big-ass 18-wheelers

349
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,741
up, down,
and all around this place.

350
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,378
Did he ever take you for a ride?

351
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,080
No...

352
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:33,050
He was always just too
happy to be home with us.

353
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:35,452
At least everyday
was different for him.

354
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,389
Different like today.

355
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,225
(siren wails)

356
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,135
(both singing)
They started to play...

357
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,805
To play...

358
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,174
Dancing with death!

359
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,444
I got to go...

360
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:01,778
Here.

361
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,147
Some guy who flyers
keeps eyeballing my shit.

362
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,349
This?

363
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,584
Fool, that's a classic.

364
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,604
(Music plays from the Walkman)

365
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,874
?

366
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,623
<i>Yolanda!</i>

367
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,495
<i>Yolanda!</i>

368
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,465
What are you doing?

369
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:59,136
You went into
your father's closet.

370
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,373
And those?

371
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,875
They let me borrow it.

372
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,676
Let me see.

373
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,319
(Music plays from the Walkman)

374
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,921
Shall we dance?

375
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,475
What, Mom?

376
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,377
Return it
to your father's closet.

377
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,914
What was it like
when you met Dad?

378
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,816
When you danced
for the first time?

379
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:47,384
What are you talking about?

380
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:48,752
You know...

381
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,287
Life stuff.

382
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,290
We've made it perfectly clear

383
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,525
that the only thing you
need to worry about is school.

384
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,194
Concentrate on that.

385
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,231
I'm not busting my ass all day
so you can throw it away.

386
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,468
I was just asking a question.

387
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,254
Photos and videos.

388
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,358
Photos for passports.

389
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,240
Thank you.

390
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,710
You making something
good for dinner?

391
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:48,879
They let us out early
from the factory.

392
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:50,480
I think there was a spill.

393
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,482
Gives me a chance
to cook for my two girls.

394
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,452
You must have your
hands full with two girls.

395
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:59,723
By any chance, do you
know of a job around here?

396
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:03,793
Not off hand, but I can
keep an eye out.

397
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:07,898
Or you can ask your eldest.
She seems to know.

398
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,000
You have something to tell me
about my daughter?

399
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,836
Well, only what I've heard.

400
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,640
I heard she's been flyering
for one of the local stores.

401
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,441
Sometimes till late.

402
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,810
There's nothing wrong
with helping her family,

403
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:22,312
you understand me?

404
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,481
That was my story
when I was young

405
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,750
and you never know to
what extent you have to go.

406
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,751
You understand me?

407
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,452
Must be another girl.

408
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,621
Thank you, Don Pedro.

409
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,701
Where did you find
your father's medallion?

410
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,036
In one of your drawers.

411
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,804
Under a bunch of crap.

412
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:52,442
Your father would be
disappointed in you...

413
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,512
In the streets as if you
didn't have a mother.

414
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:58,348
Maybe he's proud of me
because I'm making sure

415
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,450
we have a chance,
like how he wanted.

416
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,519
Give me a break, Mari.

417
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:06,790
You barely make enough
for rent, and now we got it.

418
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,593
Your father and I
wanted you to get school.

419
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,063
Having a green card
gets you an education.

420
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,965
I already figured that out.

421
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,076
I made them find one.
Sorry it took so long, Mari.

422
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,510
Cool.

423
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,816
I never thought I'd hear you
say that about a textbook.

424
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,085
Cool for when I can't
meet up with you.

425
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,953
You know, makes it easier.

426
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,456
We're going to meet up at
the shop today, aren't we?

427
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,825
Nah, I got that other stuff
to do, remember?

428
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:43,660
I'll go with you.

429
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,596
Why not?

430
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,465
Crazy! That's not you.

431
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,500
How do you know that's not me?

432
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:51,935
I ain't playing, Yoli.

433
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,604
I can do my work at home.
Don't trip.

434
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,524
Don't even trip, girl.
We got your back.

435
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:17,794
We got plans for us to kick it
after school and just have fun.

436
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,709
(Chattering, gossiping)

437
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,019
So are you like a freshman,
a junior, a sophomore?

438
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,554
No, I'm a sophomore.

439
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:45,889
I remember when I
used to be a sophomore.

440
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,691
(Yolanda) That's cool.

441
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,533
So you're a junior?

442
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:57,200
Yeah.

443
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,768
Oh, that's cool.

444
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,669
Yeah, you like it?

445
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,570
Yeah, so far.

446
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,838
I like your braid!

447
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,807
It's really long.
Who did it for you?

448
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:06,042
I can braid it
for you sometime.

449
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,210
That's be cool!

450
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,551
So who was that?

451
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,519
My best friend.

452
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,688
Need to talk to her
or something?

453
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:20,223
Are you sure?

454
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,825
Yeah.

455
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,795
So you want to come?

456
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:26,930
No, I'm ok.

457
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:29,466
Come with us, Yoli!
You'll have fun.

458
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:30,867
No, I'm ok.

459
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,013
Giving up the studies to hang
out with your little boyfriend?

460
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,181
He's not my boyfriend.

461
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,783
Yeah, he's probably a faggot.

462
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,786
He's just someone me and
Las Cuatas know from school.

463
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,087
Why do you care?

464
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,555
Please.

465
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,591
If you want to hang out
with the twiddle-dums

466
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,760
and the rest of them,
that's on you, stupid.

467
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,261
Stupid you.

468
00:39:58,263 --> 00:39:59,529
Yeah, whatever.

469
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,498
Yeah, whatever.

470
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,503
Photos and videos.

471
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,175
Photos for passports.

472
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,964
The Walkman.
You told me to hold onto it

473
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,900
so that guy
doesn't eyeball it.

474
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,136
Go play with your little
boyfriend or something.

475
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,090
Boo!

476
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,859
Come on, let's go!

477
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:40,697
Am I speaking Chinese
or something? Come on!

478
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,348
This ain't even
a real video game, Mari.

479
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,750
Yeah, it's a piece of shit!

480
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:06,389
Dude, not even!
I'm not on your lane!

481
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:07,824
Old lady.

482
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:10,360
You drive like my grandma.

483
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,028
Oh, is that right?

484
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,232
Oh, look at me!
I'm coming up in second.

485
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,101
That's right. Touch it now!

486
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:19,869
That's what I thought!

487
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,705
(Game) <i>New personal best!</i>

488
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,807
I don't have anymore change.

489
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,097
Mosquita!

490
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:03,680
(Music plays from the Walkman)

491
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,019
It's my jam right here!

492
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:13,222
(Both singing to song)

493
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,217
I didn't see you on Pacific.

494
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:44,854
I was flyering the cars along
the side streets.

495
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,393
Thank you.

496
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:54,297
Mrs. Rodriguez, how are things
with you and Mari?

497
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,065
Don't worry about us, Don Pedro.

498
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,900
Everything is good.

499
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:59,235
Let me introduce myself.

500
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:02,071
I'm Cruz Olveros
and this is my husband.

501
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:05,208
Thank you for
letting your daughter

502
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,010
help my daughter
with her schoolwork.

503
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:09,379
It's always nice to
have Mari in the house.

504
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:10,813
Such a good kid.

505
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,415
You all should talk more often.

506
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:15,251
Raising two
15-year-old girls is not easy.

507
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:18,921
In this day and age with the
youth and who they are

508
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,757
and the things
that happen sometimes.

509
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:23,493
What do you want to say
about our daughters?

510
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:26,229
It's not like I want
to gossip or anything--

511
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,364
Just spit it out.

512
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:31,100
Someone told me
that one of the girls

513
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:32,835
got into a car with someone.

514
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,038
You know what can happen
when someone gets in a car.

515
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,974
I don't see what's so unusual
about getting into a car.

516
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,209
Stepping into a car isn't,
but getting into a car is.

517
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:43,980
With all due respect,
that's all ridiculous.

518
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:47,250
Well, I had two kids
because I got into a car.

519
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:50,820
Mari doesn't have time
to get into cars with boys.

520
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:53,523
Or maybe she's finding the time.

521
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:58,861
My daughter is too smart to
be getting into cars with boys.

522
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,064
As you can see, not that smart.

523
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:04,233
I'm sure they're referring
to some other girls.

524
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:05,401
Not our daughters.

525
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,170
Excuse us.

526
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,805
I agree.

527
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,879
Maybe I should
get my driver's license.

528
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,449
I can get one
now that I'm 15.

529
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,955
For that, you need a permit.

530
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,342
What?

531
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,381
Is he giving you money?

532
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,151
What?

533
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:58,354
The boy you're spending
all your time with.

534
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:00,890
Is he giving you money?

535
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:03,025
Is that how
we've been paying rent?

536
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:04,927
I don't know what
you're talking about.

537
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,131
Playing dumb
isn't your strong suit.

538
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:09,632
They have you
working too hard over there.

539
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:11,300
I asked you a question!

540
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:13,402
There is no boy!

541
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,622
Mom, what are you
doing in there?

542
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,524
How was school?

543
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:36,125
Fine.

544
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,494
And on your walks back home?

545
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,196
The same.

546
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,465
The same?

547
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,433
Yes, Mom, the same.

548
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:46,369
Ok.

549
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,917
Don't you usually
walk with Mari?

550
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:06,556
It would be nice if you did.
Walk to school together.

551
00:47:06,558 --> 00:47:08,324
Ok, Mom.

552
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,394
To school and back.

553
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:12,929
Together.

554
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,331
Ok, Mom.

555
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,000
Go on and finish showering.

556
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,708
Tell me something...

557
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,177
Something you never told anyone.

558
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:13,349
I was five when we left
my grandma to come here.

559
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:18,521
My dad wanted her to
come with us, but she refused.

560
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:21,524
I still remember how
everyone was afraid of her

561
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:24,660
because she took care
of hers no matter what.

562
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:30,399
But she would always take me
on these walks to this river,

563
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:35,805
and we'd make tortas
with beans and cheese.

564
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:40,710
And we'd eat until we
couldn't take it anymore.

565
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,650
And we'd just lay there
and watch the birds fly.

566
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,787
She said if I really wanted to,

567
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,757
I could hear the wind
going through their feathers

568
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:56,525
as they flapped by.

569
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:04,533
And I swear to you,
for a moment, I could.

570
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:09,438
Ten years from now,
I'm gonna save up

571
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,441
and visit my grandma
in Xalapa Mexico.

572
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:15,311
By then, who cares
if I can't make it back?

573
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,448
Ten years from now,
I want to--

574
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,717
Be a doctor or lawyer.

575
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,220
I don't even know.

576
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:26,288
Maybe a truck driver?

577
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,624
Are you gonna ride with me?

578
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:30,726
You can take me
to my grandma's.

579
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,662
You can stay if you want.

580
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:38,701
Yeah, I could see that.

581
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,698
Yoli.

582
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,568
Hello.

583
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,839
You gotta get back
to your homework!

584
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:21,310
Yoli! Yoli!

585
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,213
Yoli!

586
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,183
Yolanda!

587
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:28,884
Come on! I'm ready.

588
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,528
Put a streak on each side,

589
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,831
and these are going to
look real cute, ok?

590
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:52,808
Yolanda?

591
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,348
Are those permanent?

592
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,694
Mr. Galvez wants to see us.

593
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:13,229
Why?

594
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,998
Why haven't we seen
any of your latest tests

595
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,766
posted on the refrigerator?

596
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,937
We'll see.

597
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:29,311
Yolanda is one of
my best students.

598
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,547
That's why I am
a bit concerned

599
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:34,016
that her grades
have been declining.

600
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:40,523
Maybe you've been preoccupied
helping out your friend Mari.

601
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,260
Is there something happening
to you here at school?

602
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,295
No.

603
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:48,264
Is someone harassing you?

604
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:49,999
No.

605
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:53,369
Lately you've had
your head in the clouds.

606
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,639
Thank you very much, professor,
for letting us know.

607
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:58,741
Thank you for coming.

608
00:52:58,743 --> 00:53:00,476
Anything else,
please let us know.

609
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:01,010
Of course.

610
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:02,311
Thank you.

611
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:06,549
Yolanda...

612
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,956
Look, um. I've got
these college pamphlets

613
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:16,759
and I was thinking maybe
you could take a look at them.

614
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:20,729
And we could talk about how
to get you a tour to visit them.

615
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:22,798
You know? Maybe one weekend?

616
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,768
That sound exciting?

617
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,037
- Yeah.
- Ok.

618
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,018
We don't have to
return to Mexico

619
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,055
to be reminded of
what poverty looks like.

620
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,458
It's just a few blocks
away from us.

621
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,628
Your mother and I
work very hard

622
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,397
to make sure your future
is far from this.

623
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:58,367
What we endure everyday
at work for years

624
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:00,803
isn't enough for you
to get it?

625
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:03,005
But I never said
I wasn't going to college.

626
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:07,409
Any obstacle
that gets in your way,

627
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,877
you can just move aside.

628
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,480
- And that includes any boy.
- What?

629
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:12,881
Don't play
the deaf one, Yolanda.

630
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:14,516
This isn't the moment for that.

631
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:18,053
Your future is too important for
you to have this attitude.

632
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:19,755
Ok Dad, I know.

633
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,457
It doesn't appear that way.

634
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,571
Don't lose sight
of what you have

635
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:36,872
right in front of you.

636
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:38,641
Yeah, like you.

637
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:40,442
What was that?

638
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,044
Nothing.

639
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,613
You listening to me, Yolanda?

640
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:45,714
Yes.

641
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,984
I won't lose sight.

642
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:14,610
Mari?

643
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:15,678
Yeah?

644
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,947
No chocolate.
Peanut butter and jelly ok?

645
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,184
Yeah.

646
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:23,786
Alright.

647
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,956
It looks nice.

648
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,683
Come on.

649
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,088
We just want one picture.
Is that ok?

650
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,590
Yes, that's ok.

651
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:35,791
Thank you.

652
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,235
Oh, come on.
Not like this.

653
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,970
Like this.

654
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,080
See! That's what
I'm talking about.

655
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,782
That says, "I'm here!"

656
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,051
No... "We're here."

657
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,190
Yeah, it's me and you for life.

658
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,566
Your parents?

659
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,936
Don Pedro's.

660
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:48,797
(Music plays from the stereo)

661
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,920
Just for a little bit.
I'm cold, Mari.

662
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,324
Ok, but just for a little bit.

663
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:38,073
You're probably going to go
far way for college, huh?

664
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:43,712
Wherever they accept us -
here, somewhere else.

665
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,082
Us?

666
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:50,052
I'm not helping you for nothing.

667
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:51,687
I can't afford it.

668
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,823
We'll figure it out.

669
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,225
Yeah?

670
00:59:57,227 --> 01:00:00,195
We'll get into school.
We'll get away.

671
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,268
Thank you.

672
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,004
Thank you.

673
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,114
Hi, girls!

674
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:27,516
Hi, girls.

675
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:32,487
Excuse me, I have to go
take care of my sister.

676
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,424
What's going on with her?

677
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:39,494
Yolanda, I'm talking to you.
What's going on with her?

678
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:41,129
What were you two up to?

679
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:43,198
Studying for our finals.

680
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,466
And how did it go?

681
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:46,301
We'll be ready for them.

682
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:50,038
That's what I like to hear.

683
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:21,630
It's the end of the month.

684
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:24,199
Please give me a chance
to make more than this.

685
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:25,500
I'm sorry, Mari.

686
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:28,537
It's just been too slow.

687
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:31,506
The flyering
hasn't given me results.

688
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:33,475
I have to let you go.

689
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:42,384
Do you need any help
in the store?

690
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:43,518
No?

691
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:50,192
Excuse me, but do you need help
with something by any chance?

692
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:52,027
In anything? No?

693
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:01,102
<i>How much will you</i>
<i>give me for this?</i>

694
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:02,270
<i>We'll give you fifteen.</i>

695
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:03,672
Only fifteen?

696
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:06,508
They're hard to find.
It's a classic.

697
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,709
Fifteen.

698
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,330
I got a booger on my face
or something?

699
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:29,664
Stupid.

700
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,066
Then?

701
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:36,304
Yesterday, was kinda...
I don't know.

702
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:39,040
You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

703
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,511
Ok.

704
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:51,519
You can be
so annoying sometimes.

705
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,660
You know that guy
from the other day?

706
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,730
Las Cuatas' friend...

707
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:03,999
Well, he asked me
to be his girlfriend.

708
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,135
He's more stupider
than I thought.

709
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:08,737
Well, maybe I should say yes.

710
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:10,472
Why not?

711
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:12,207
If you don't want me to,
I won't.

712
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:14,142
I already told you what I think.

713
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,610
Yeah, but--

714
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:17,479
Who cares? Just say yes.

715
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:19,514
I got real things
to be thinking about.

716
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,082
Not that dumb kid shit.

717
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,151
- Mari!
- What!

718
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,089
Don't forget about
the final on Monday.

719
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,144
Flyering going ok?

720
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,349
Yes.

721
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:33,221
I have a co-worker...

722
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:36,224
She said she turned
her garage into a studio.

723
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,428
And it came out really nice.

724
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,698
Even though it's a little
crowded for three.

725
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:45,800
They pay me
in a couple of days.

726
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:48,370
You don't have
to get all dramatic.

727
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,540
I'm sorry.

728
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,678
Forget about it.

729
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:02,884
Ok! All your books, notes,
backpacks under your desks.

730
01:07:02,886 --> 01:07:07,655
Nothing but pens, pencils,
and calculators out.

731
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,658
Just relax. You'll all do great.

732
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:28,743
Ok! Everyone with a test,
you may begin!

733
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,151
You may begin.

734
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:42,690
Good luck.

735
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,660
You too.

736
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:54,903
(Students chattering)

737
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,665
Come on Saturdays,

738
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,900
ladies get in free
before midnight!

739
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:31,806
Hi, how are you?
Every Saturday night...

740
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,814
I can help you flyer.

741
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:41,850
I'm not flyering. I'm promoting.

742
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:44,452
Doesn't matter.
I can still help you.

743
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,423
You're too young
to be doing this.

744
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:50,825
Come on, man. Hurry up.

745
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:58,299
You need money, don't you?

746
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,602
Yes, but it's not for sale.

747
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,437
Then, what is?

748
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:04,906
Perv.

749
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:13,248
Join us every Saturday night.

750
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,753
Mari!

751
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:21,256
Hey!

752
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,324
<i>That's enough!</i>

753
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,526
Hey!

754
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:30,665
What the hell's
going on with you?

755
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:37,939
I'm sure that boy is
the cause of this nonsense.

756
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,612
[knocking on door]

757
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:45,947
Everything ok?

758
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,618
Are you ok?

759
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,691
We'll leave you alone.

760
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:28,423
(School bell rings)

761
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:40,501
Mr. G, can I take
Mari's final to her?

762
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:42,403
Sorry, Yolanda. Not a final.

763
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,572
She's gonna have
to come get it herself.

764
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:08,463
Thanks, Mr. G.

765
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,132
Good work!

766
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,487
Have you seen Mari?

767
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,513
Who the hell is she?

768
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,615
My best friend.

769
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:36,517
Are you playing
elementary school games?

770
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:37,618
No!

771
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:38,920
You know what, go to hell.

772
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:40,154
Wait!

773
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:44,158
We made a deal.

774
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:03,237
?

775
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,864
What's wrong?

776
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,911
I'm tired, Mom.

777
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,862
My love.

778
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,969
(loud music plays,
kids laughing)

779
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,844
Scoot over, Yoli.

780
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,362
I like this song!

781
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,737
Yoli, you're gonna
start again

782
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,272
with that
holy santita bullshit?

783
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:19,907
No, I've done it before.

784
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,709
Well, then hit it!

785
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,778
It was different.

786
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:26,247
Come on, a joint is a joint.

787
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:38,392
(All sounds fade away
leaving only music)

788
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:45,700
?

789
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:42,323
What's wrong?

790
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,492
Stop the car. Stop the car!

791
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:45,960
What the hell, Yoli!

792
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:47,361
Look, stop!

793
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,531
It's ok, dude. Ok?
Just on a trip.

794
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:53,934
Just get back in the car.
You'll feel much better!

795
01:17:53,936 --> 01:17:57,038
- Just shut up, Cuata!
- I'm walking home.

796
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,973
Yoli, don't be like that.

797
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,009
- Alright, then go!
- I will!

798
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,945
You know, it's not like
we give a shit!

799
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,355
Good! Cuz I don't
give a shit either!

800
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,299
Let's just go, Cuata.

801
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:36,343
?

802
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:08,963
?
