And by the way,
you're doing a great job too.

178
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,462
I hope that dead kid
wasn't a friend of yours.

179
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,381
What do you want, Landry?

180
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,760
I want the keys to the Kingdom, Shane.

181
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,512
So why don't you personally escort us

182
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,222
up to the second and third floor.

183
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,433
You know what I'm talking about.

184
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,685
Come on. Finish that cigarette.

185
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,730
- Whatever you say, Detective.
- Good. Let's go.

186
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,568
A little slower after that stint, huh?

187
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,821
You're movin' old.

188
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,699
Dirt all on your back. Come on.

189
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,246
You know, big guy, I've been
waiting for this for a long time.

190
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,290
Yeah, I bet you have.

191
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,417
How long were you in there for?
Was it about five?

192
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,461
Yeah, something like that.

193
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,173
Must have been hard for a dirty cop
in there with all them bubbas.

194
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,022
No, it was all right.

195
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,441
I had your dad to keep me company.

196
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,155
You'll want to learn to shut your mouth.

197
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,534
Because if you say anything
about my dad again,

198
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,495
I'll kill you.

199
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,127
- Hey, Landry.
- Yeah, Shane?

200
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,629
I heard your dad gives
a helluva blow job.

201
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,424
- No.
- Whoa whoa. Not now.

202
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,385
- Take it easy, partner.
- Ray, this isn't over.

203
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,637
Whatever, tough guy.

204
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,646
You okay?

205
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,481
Yeah, I'm fine.

206
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,650
I heard you got into it with Tony.

207
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,236
Yeah, well, luckily your boyfriend

208
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,863
doesn't throw much of a punch.

209
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,907
- Tony's not my boyfriend.
- That's not what I heard.

210
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,242
Why do you say things like that?

211
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,035
Does it make you feel good
to act like an asshole?

212
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,872
Who says I'm acting?

213
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,624
- I know you, Ray.
- Not anymore, you don't.

214
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,044
So why don't you go back upstairs
with the rest of the whores?

215
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,673
Dick.

216
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,371
- Yeah?
- Why did you say that to me?

217
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,374
What?

218
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,418
Why do you like hurting me so much?

219
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,420
It doesn't have to be like this.

220
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,131
How do you think I feel
about what you did to me?

221
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,425
Tony? Is that what we're talking about?

222
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,678
Okay, I was with him
because you weren't there.

223
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,223
- I was in prison.
- Exactly.

224
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,184
Look, every time I try to talk to you,

225
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,602
you just walk away.

226
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,563
Well, then maybe
you should get the hint.

227
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,066
You know what,
will you just give me five minutes?

228
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,610
Just time to explain myself?

229
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:45,532
I mean it was a mistake.
It should have never happened.

230
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,575
You're goddamn right.

231
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,412
Look, I got to go to work.

232
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,499
Me too.

233
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,627
Yeah, but you get to lie down
on the job all day, don't you?

234
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,004
Fuck you, Ray.

235
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,309
Look, I really really
don't have time for this.

236
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,478
Shane, shut the fuck up.
Vincent's in his office.

237
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,689
Get yourself down here.

238
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,662
You're late. They started
the meeting without you.

239
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,706
Yeah, well, I got here
as fast as I could.

240
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,505
We had everything under control.

241
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,132
How could you let this happen?

242
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,967
It had nothin' to do with me.

243
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,552
You let this bum take care of shit.

244
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,596
He practically walked them
through the front door.

245
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,097
That's not the way it went down.

246
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,182
This guy you vouched for, Walter,

247
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,018
he left his post a minute
before that crew hit our door.

248
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,520
- What's that have to do with anything?
- He's your guy.

249
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,189
When was the last time
you talked to him?

250
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,109
We been looking everywhere.
We can't fucking find him!

251
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,321
- That don't mean shit.
- His son's dead because of you.

252
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,824
Enough! Do you know who this is?

253
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,578
Carlos sent him down. Charlie's here
to make sure you don't screw this up.

254
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,622
Do I get a chance to tell my side?

255
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,583
Can't wait to fuckin' hear this.

256
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,587
I'm sorry about Pete.
He was a great kid.

257
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,341
But I did everything
I could to keep things under control.

258
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,176
So you ordered the lock down?

259
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,179
Yeah, I did.

260
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,640
Well, I think that was a good move.

261
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,767
You protected the family
and our interests.

262
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,645
Fuck that. He should have been
stopping those guys

263
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,772
from taking over 300 grand of our money.

264
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,607
Why were we carrying that much cash?

265
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,567
Money's not the issue.
I want you to find them.

266
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,194
I want this handled internally.

267
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,322
- Mr. Marcella, I can't do that.
- You were a detective.

268
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,574
You're used to finding people
that don't want to be found.

269
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,618
But with all due respect,

270
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,620
to work like a cop
you need access to information--

271
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,122
ballistics, criminal histories,
I can't get any of that.

272
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,209
Use your contacts in the department.
Use ours for that matter.

273
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,835
If I show up at the precinct,

274
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,463
I'm gonna be as welcome
as the clap in a convent.

275
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,090
Fuck it. I'll handle it.

276
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,841
No.

277
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,637
Blood demands blood.

278
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,597
You find the men who murdered my son

279
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,808
and bring them to me.

280
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,896
- Can I get another Crown?
- Make that two.

281
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,358
You played it smart in there,

282
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,736
not letting that prick,
Tony, get to you.

283
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,780
You keeping tabs on me, Charlie?

284
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,116
That's what they pay me for.

285
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,077
There you go, gentlemen.

286
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,956
So where'd you do your time?

287
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,708
Terre Haute.

288
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,669
How was it?

289
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,589
- Colder than this shit.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

290
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,177
I did three years State time,
nearly nine Federal.

291
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,221
Nine years, man, I would have lost it.

292
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,724
You know the best way
to do a long stretch?

293
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,350
Yeah.

294
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,063
Day by motherfucking day.

295
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,112
I can't ever go back.

296
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,907
Is that what you're afraid of?

297
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,451
I got a dozen guys out there

298
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,703
just waiting for me to fuck up
so they can send me back.

299
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,039
Vinnie's not asking you
to step over the line,

300
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,416
just play it close that's all.

301
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,918
I don't know, man.

302
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,754
All right, listen to me.
Don't let Tony get to you.

303
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,547
He's trying way too hard
just to look the part.

304
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,592
Yeah. Prick's trying
to lay this shit on me.

305
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,344
Because we've never been hit before.

306
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,888
Just trying to cover his own ass.

307
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,307
What about you?

308
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,393
Well, they keep me around just
to eliminate problems for the old man.

309
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,354
Am I one of those problems?

310
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,399
Not yet.

311
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,903
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

312
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,823
Sometimes you got to
think about what you saw

313
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,284
and then ask yourself that question--

314
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,245
"What was out of place
when it all went down?"

315
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,252
Listen, I've got to go.

316
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,629
But if you need to find me,

317
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,175
this is where I am most afternoons,

318
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,010
where I go to clear my head.

319
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,058
You be lucky.

320
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,498
Hey, it's Walter.

321
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,001
Leave your digits
and maybe I'll get back to you.

322
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,828
Can I do something for you?

323
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,706
Yeah. I'm looking for a buddy of mine,

324
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,917
been staying here a month
or two since he got out.

325
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,127
His name's Walter Randall. You seen him?

326
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,046
Not in a couple of days.

327
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,636
- Thanks anyway.
- You know, you ain't the first guy

328
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,262
that stopped by here looking for him.

329
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,224
Is that right? You mind
if I check his room?

330
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,393
- Are you a cop?
- No.

331
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,604
Then, yeah, I do.

332
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,940
All right.

333
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,776
Hey, you find him,
tell him he's late on his rent.

334
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,236
It's due every Friday.

335
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,779
If he doesn't come back here
and pay up in full

336
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,573
in the next couple of days,
I'm throwing his shit out.

337
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,325
Yeah, I'll do that.

338
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,747
Hey, man. How much you got?

339
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,250
- Excuse me?
- I overheard you, what you were saying.

340
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,710
- What's that got to do with you?
- Look...

341
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,963
I know where your boy's staying, okay?

342
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,049
I'll tell you.
I just need a little cash, man, okay?

343
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,425
All right.

344
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,478
If he's not where you say he is,

345
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,064
- I'm coming back for this.
- Okay, man, look,

346
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,067
he's at the this little
piece of shit motel.

347
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,529
It's off the Interstate.

00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,157
we partied it up, man.
It's all good. I promise.

350
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,326
You know the room?

351
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,954
25, okay? 25.

352
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,414
Hey hey, man, you see him,

353
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,874
tell him I've got some
really good shit, okay?

354
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,543
Thanks, man.

Jimmy.

368
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,255
- Jimmy.
- What are you doing here, Ray?

369
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,299
I need your help, man.

370
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,467
I can't be seen with you.

371
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,177
Give me a call sometime.
Maybe we can talk.

372
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,095
- I called you three times.
- I've been busy.

373
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,722
Hey.

374
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,725
We were partners.

375
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,311
It's ancient history.

376
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,271
You think you'd still be on the job
if I hadn't stood up for you?

377
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,273
They wanted the whole squad--

378
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,900
Internal Affairs,

379
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,361
U.S. Attorney's office, goddamn FBI.

380
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,363
They all tried to make deals with me.

381
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,241
They offered me a walk if I testified.

382
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,159
Look, I appreciate
what you did, all right,

383
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,495
- but I can't do this with you.
- Five fucking years, Jimmy.

384
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,747
You know how long that is?

385
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,333
Well, I'm into something
and I need your help.

386
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,377
- You owe me that much.
- All right.

387
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,379
Let's go talk over there.

388
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,928
I got a wife and a new baby girl.

389
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,680
I can't do this shit anymore.

390
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,348
I don't want to see
pictures of your family.

391
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,017
They're the only reason
I'm still riding the desk.

392
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,144
You know,
Landry came down the other day,

393
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,397
said you were working over at the House.

394
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,315
- Yeah, that's right.
- Listen,

395
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,984
y'all got some shit brewing down there.

396
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,318
I don't want any part of it.

397
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,737
Hey, you've got access
to everything I need:

398
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:18,325
interviews, witness statements,
the whole case file.

399
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,702
I need you to show it to me.

400
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,954
I can't do that! If I get caught I'm g--

401
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,540
You weren't so worried about
getting caught back in the old days

402
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,208
when you were shoving
Vinnie's envelopes in your pocket.

403
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,836
- Keep your goddamn voice down.
- Have you seen the reports?

404
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,421
Yeah, I've seen them.

405
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,339
Is there anything in there I can use?

406
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,675
Goddamn you, Ray.

407
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,429
The lab matched the slugs
from the shooter's gun

408
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,681
to a bullet they dug out
of a murder victim about a month ago.

409
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,224
What good does that do me?

410
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,602
Homicide brought in a suspect,

411
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,605
they couldn't find a weapon,
they had to let him loose.

412
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,484
Get me the file.

413
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,448
Why are you helping the Marcellas?

414
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,411

I said what the fuck do you want?

445
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,570
I need to ask you a few questions.

446
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,572
- You got a search warrant?
- No. No.

447
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,908
Look, I just want to
ask you a few questions.

448
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,702
What the fuck you doing
in my goddamn house?!

449
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,370
You broke my fucking door!

450
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,038
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

451
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,791
- You ain't got no search warrant.
- I'm not a cop.

452
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,378
- Oh, you're not a cop?
- No. I just need to ask you a few--

453
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,050
Fuck yeah, motherfucker!

454
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,470
Yeah, you broke into
the wrong house today.

455
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,724
Fuck is wrong with you,
breaking into my house?

456
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,893
Broke into my motherfuckin' house.

457
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,481
Yeah, motherfucker. Yeah, that's right.

458
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,982
Yeah, getting dirty.

459
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,451
- I work for the Marcellas.
- So what? Get off me.

460
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,621
Someone robbed their place
and used your gun

461
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,749
- to kill the owner's son.
- I heard about what happened.

462
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,459
- I had nothing to do with it.
- You were picked up

463
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,336
on a murder charge two weeks ago.

464
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,838
- That charge's been dropped.
- Well, what did you do with the gun?

465
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,507
A motherfucker named
Scooby got that gun.

466
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,176
- White guy or black guy?
- White boy, buys coke from me.

467
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,428
He came over here about a month ago,
said he needed a piece.

468
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,472
- Where's he live?
- Man, I ain't no motherfuckin' snitch.

469
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,307
You're gonna tell me where he lives!

470
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,642
You're gonna tell me where he lives

471
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,268
or I'm gonna go back to the Marcellas

472
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,230
and tell them that you were
involved in the robbery.

473
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,481
And you know what that means?

474
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,483
They're gonna come looking for you!

475
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,944
So you're gonna tell me where he lives.

476
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,654
A'ight.

477
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,077
Shit.

478
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,162
Let's go.

479
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,500
Big fucker, let's go.

480
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,264
That's it right there,

481
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,892
707, second door. 707.

482
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,812
- Which car is his?
- I showed you where he live.

483
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,564
That's it. I'm done.

484
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,567
You tell the Marcellas
I had nothing to do with it.

485
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,987
- What?
- You tell anybody about me,

486
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,239
I'm gonna make sure everybody
knows you ratted your boy out.

487
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,032
Let go.

488
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,109
Who are you?

489
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,612
I'm a friend of Scooby's.

490
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,822
You look like a cop.

491
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,700
Yeah, I hear that
all the time. Is he home?

492
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,161
Scooby ain't here. He's dead.

493
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,038
Last night he was standing on the street

494
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,081
waiting for a ride
and somebody shot him.

495
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,382
- Hello.
- Jimmy, it's Ray.

496
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,635
You're calling me at home?
My family's here with me.

497
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,887
- Yeah, well, good for them.
- What do you want?

498
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,597
I need you to pull a rap sheet for me

499
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,058
on a guy named Lawrence Salazar.

500
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,687
It's a little late for that.
I can do it in the morning.

501
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,647
I need it now.

502
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,899
Meet me in the motor pool
basement in an hour.

503
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,720
- Jimmy.
- God damn it.

504
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,596
You scared the fucking shit out of me.

505
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,765
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

506
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,143
This is it though, Ray. I mean it.

507
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,936
Don't ask me for anything else.

508
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,858
Salazar runs a pretty tight crew.

509
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,278
Their sheets are a mile long.

510
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,321
One of his buddies has a spider tattoo.

511
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,948
A lot of guys in this town have them.

512
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,160
I busted this guy-- Dylan Sylvester.

513
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,203
You know him?

514
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,372
It looks like Fritz and I picked
him up nine years ago.

515
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,500
Son of a bitch.

516
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,253
We popped Salazar
two years later on a dope charge.

517
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,506
Kind of strange, huh,
you knowing the guys

518
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,300
that tried to put a bullet in your head?

519
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,594
Hey, you gonna tell the greasers that
you know two of the hold-up men?

520
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,887
It's not like we were drinking buddies.

521
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,305
Why don't you tell them about it then?

522
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,184
That's what I thought.

523
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,686
I'm out of this, Ray. I mean it.

524
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,229
Don't call me again.

525
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,523
- How old is your daughter?
- Why?

526
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,733
You want her to grow up
without a father?

527
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,693
- You're threatening me?
- Remember the old days, Jimmy?

528
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,113
Well, I'm deep into this
and the statute of limitations

529
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,865
on the shit we did hasn't run out.

530
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,825
If I go down, I'm taking you with me!

531
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,078
Fuck you, asshole!

532
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,652
It's been a long time, Detective.

533
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,987
Yes, it has.

534
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,950
You got 60 seconds.

535
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,869
I want Ray Shane off my back.

536
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,540
Too fuckin' bad for you.

537
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,916
I know you got Shane out
looking for the guys

538
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,876
that took you off the other night.

539
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,921
As far as I know,
the police are investigating that.

540
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,383
Stop pulling my dick, Tony.

541
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,094
You know Ray knows two of the shooters?

542
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,012
One of them's dead

543
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,306
and he's out looking for the others.

544
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,516
Is that right?

545
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,852
And your doorman, Walter,

546
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:50,647
he was found with his throat slit
in a motel on Division.

547
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,693
The maid spotted someone
leaving that very room

548
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,444
that matched
the description of Ray Shane.

549
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,573
Who else knows about this?

550
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,828
I want Ray Shane out of my life.

551
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,831
Look, I know how badly
your business was impacted

552
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,332
by this unfortunate event.

553
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,252
Shut down your brothel
and casino for how many nights now?

554
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,421
What'd that cost you?

555
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,179
I expect that this will be
filled by next time we meet.

556
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,830
You trust this cop?

557
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,208
He rode Vice with Shane.
He knows how he thinks.

558
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:58,423
- So why's he telling us?
- He needs the cash.

559
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,926
Figures if he sells us intel,
he can get back on the payroll.

560
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:05,597
If Shane set this up, why's he got
to lean on his old partner for help?

561
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,557
He's just tying up loose ends.

562
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,685
Listen, if we don't jump into this now,

563
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,562
we're gonna have no one left
to connect him to the robbery.

564
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,982
I brought that man into this House.

565
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,610
I took him when no one else would.

566
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:22,280
- I trusted him.
- We all did.

567
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,075
Bring him in.

568
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,748
- How you doing, Ray?
- What the fuck do you want?

569
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,419
Vincent wants to know
why you took our money

570
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,004
and why you killed his son.

571
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,797
What the fuck are you talking about?

572
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,591
Killing Pete was stupid.

573
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,845
Taking the money--
what the fuck were you thinking?

574
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,931
I didn't have anything to do with it,
and you fucking know it!

575
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,975
That's what I thought you'd say.

576
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,728
Fuck you. It wasn't me.

577
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,108
Bullshit. I didn't have
anything to do with it.

578
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,068
I know you know who the shooters are!

579
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,071
I was a cop! That connects me
to every scumbag in the city.

580
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,740
I knew you were a piece of shit

581
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,658
the second Vincent brought you in.

582
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,910
Once a dirty cop always a dirty cop.

583
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,539
Always looking out for number one, hmm?

584
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,044
- Right or left, Ray.
- What?

585
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,212
Your call.

586
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,067
Jenny.

587
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,486
Jesus, Ray. What are you doing here?

588
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,115
Can we go inside?

589
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,118
God, you look like
you got hit by a truck.

590
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,370
Yeah? Well, that's 'cause
your boyfriend decided

591
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,122
- to use me as a punching bag.
- You know what?

592
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,582
If you're gonna talk to me like that,
you can leave right now!

593
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,876
- I'm sorry.
- Stay right there.

594
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,172
Well, this place sure has changed.

595
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,258
Yeah well, it's mine now.

596
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:32,595
I didn't really like your furnishings
anyway. Here, try that.

597
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,849
Want a beer?

598
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:39,519
- Yeah.
- Oh God.

599
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,857
There you go.

600
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,486
So what happened, Ray?

601
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,907
- Huh?
- Vinnie thinks I set up the robbery.

602
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,909
He sent Tony and Joey
to work me over.

603
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,453
- Did you?
- Did I what, set up the robbery?

604
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,204
- Yeah. Did you?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

605
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,664
- No.
- How can you even ask me that?

606
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,333
You were there. You know what happened.

607
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,295
This is crazy. It doesn't make sense.

608
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,672
It's too connected.

609
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,923
You know what? You just need to get

610
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,884
as far away from here as you can.

611
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,761
But where am I gonna go? I'll be the
prime suspect in at least two murders.

612
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,849
And if I leave now, I'll spend the rest
of my life looking over my shoulder.

613
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,809
So if you stay, they'll kill you.

614
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,811
I did my time. I can't live like that.

615
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,731
- You're smart. You're really smart.
- I'm not running.

616
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,903
- Who is it?
- It's Tony. Open the door.

617
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,696
Shit.

618
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,114
Hold on.

619
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,617
Goddamn it.

620
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,203
Be there in a minute.
Let me put something on.

621
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,121
Open the fuckin' door!

622
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,834
- What do you want, Tony?
- Let me inside.

623
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,505
Take the chain off.

624
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,174
No. The last time I did,

625
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,717
you just fucked a lot of shit up.

626
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,470
- Take the chain off.
- What do you want?

627
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,349
- I want to talk to you.
- Do you?

628
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,184
- Yeah.
- Okay.

629
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,560
Say what you have to say right there.

630
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,189
- Don't get smart. Just let me in.
- Hey!

631
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,192
Let me inside.

632
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,570
You seen Shane?

633
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,615
No, I haven't seen him.

634
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,618
You think he would come here? Huh!

635
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,245
- Let me inside.
- Don't!

636
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,247
No. Do you want me to call the cops?

637
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,083
I'll call the cops.
Here. You want it, huh?

638
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,210
- You ready?
- Fuck you. I'll deal with you later.

639
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,880
Oh, big shot, big shot.
Fucking piece of shit.

640
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,593
Thanks, Ray. Thanks a lot.

641
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,595
God damn it.

642
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,867
- There you go.
- I can't believe you kept this.

643
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,247
Goodwill wouldn't take it.

644
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,083
Besides, I used it to wash my car.

645
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,464
Do you ever wonder where we'd be

646
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,384
if we hadn't messed up
our lives so badly?

647
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,388
Yeah, every day.

648
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,307
Did you mean what you said earlier

649
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,892
about not running away this time?

650
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,686
What else can I do?

651
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,689
You can be honest with yourself.

652
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,066
Just admit that you are who you are

653
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:36,154
because of all the choices you've made.

654
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,329
Practically the minute
I got my prison sentence

655
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,458
you went back to being a hooker.

656
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,756
I wasn't a hooker. I was a call girl.

657
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,508
And I stopped

658
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,470
when you got out
because of you, lunkhead.

659
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,974
Besides, you were a crooked cop.

660
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,268
You got paid to look the other way,

661
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,854
and that was the choice you made.

662
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,443
Those are the choices I made.

663
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:22,575
And, basically,

664
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,246
that was how
we got ourselves in this mess.

665
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,655
- Heya.
- New wheels?

666
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,616
Yeah, something like that.

667
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,244
I heard you got yourself
into a bit of a jam.

668
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,372
Yeah, it's become a habit.

669
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,207
Yeah, well,
you don't know the half of it.

670
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,504
Ray, Ray, Ray, relax. Sit down.

671
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,631
I'm not here to whack you.

672
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,760
Well, not yet anyway.

673
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,680
Doesn't sound very reassuring.

674
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,224
But just so you know,
if the old man gets involved

675
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,642
there's nothing I can do.

676
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,854
I need your help, Charlie.

677
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,651
Look, Ray, I like you.

678
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:24,614
So please do me a favor--
you did not hear this from me.

679
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,410
Tony Zello's been playing
the back channels.

680
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,288
He wants Vinnie out of the way and
he's gonna use the robbery to do it.

681
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,499
How?

682
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:37,502
Well, Vinnie put you in charge of
security. That used to be Tony's job.

683
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,421
And if it looks like you set up
the robbery, well then--

684
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,507
Vinnie's out and Tony takes over.

685
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,383
Yeah.

686
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,303
All I'm saying to you is
don't underestimate Tony.

687
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,472
He would do whatever it takes
to get what he wants,

688
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,808
including pimping his wife out.

689
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,311
Yeah.

690
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,355
Every Wednesday night

691
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,648
she meets the old man

692
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,483
after hours and they go out

693
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,318
to his estate on Reeds Lake.

694
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,237
Why is Carlos messing around with her?

695
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,655
Well, she's young and she's
good looking, isn't she?

696
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,658
You know, as long as Priscilla
takes care of him,

697
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,327
then the old man's
gonna watch Tony's back.

698
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,540
You think he'd listen to me
if I went to him in person?

699
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,751
He's a reasonable man.

700
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,754
But to be honest with you,
it's gonna be like--

701
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,631
it's gonna be like going to court.

702
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,508
You're gonna have to
make a really good case.

703
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,760
And the best way to do that

704
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,846
is to prove to him
who really set this up.

705
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,557
I'm telling you,
if you can find the cash

706
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,642
and you can find the shooter,

707
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,936
well, then the rest
will fall into place.

708
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,028
I'll see you around.

709
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,000
- Who is it?
- Maintenance.

710
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,795
What do you want?

711
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,339
One of your neighbors
smacked into your car.

712
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,440
I don't have time to fuck around.

713
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,693
You got one chance
to answer my questions.

714
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,361
Fuck you!

715
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,033
In a minute you're gonna
feel some real pain.

716
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,202
Who else was a part of your crew?

717
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,037
I don't know what you're talking about.

718
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,082
Next time you lie to me

719
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,292
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.

720
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,128
- I'm the only one left.
- Where are the others?

721
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,047
- Dead.
- What were their names?

722
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,925
One guy was named Eddie Teasedale.

723
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,719
The other guy we called Wop.

724
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,388
Scooby said he had a man on the inside.

725
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,849
It was supposed to be an easy score.
Shit was all arranged, man.

726
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,351
All we had to do was just come
and make it look real.

727
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,688
- What happened to 'em?
- They set up a meet for us

728
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,649
to drop off the cash.
When we got there all hell broke loose.

729
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,818
Who was it?

730
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,278
I didn't see any faces.

731
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:36,032
- It was too dark.
- You're going back with me.

732
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,162
I ain't talking to no cops!

733
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,367
You got a lot of nerve
interrupting my dinner.

734
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,703
It's business.

735
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,830
Why don't you two go
and powder your noses?

736
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,916
I don't need to powder my nose.

737
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,963
Go take a piss, get a drink,
whatever. Give us a minute.

738
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,091
Sit down.

739
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,348
Now what's so fucking important?

740
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,558
Some guy called me today,

741
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,895
said he saw Shane and Charlie Blackstone
talking at 4th Street Park.

742
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,856
Who made the call?

743
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,317
Just some guy who's
into me for a thousand.

744
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,241
Charlie's worked for me for a long time.

745
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:03,077
He got no business talking to Shane.

746
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,080
What do you want me to do?

747
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,987
Listen, I got to head out
for a little bit.

748
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,072
I won't be too long.

749
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,798
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

750
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,633
So where's your other guy, Joey?

751
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:03,220
He's just taking care
of some shit. Let's go.

752
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,179
I thought you said
that guy's supposed to be here.

753
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,848
That's what they told me.

754
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:52,937
- Who's "they"?
- Fuck, does it matter?

755
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,397
This kid has information on Shane.

756
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,107
Here's the guy now.

757
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,500
I trusted you, Charlie.

758
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,086
Considered you a stand-up guy.

759
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,591
No!

760
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,929
You been seeing Shane behind our backs.

761
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,014
That's fucking bullshit and you know it.

762
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:37,147
Charlie, quiet.
No one can fucking hear you out here.

763
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,823
.22 caliber, hurts like a bitch.

764
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,992
I once saw a guy take 11 rounds

765
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,077
before he begged me to kill him.

766
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,913
You tell me where he is,
I'll make it quick,

767
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,331
I promise.

768
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,208
You can do whatever you fucking want,

769
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,044
because I got nothing to give up.

770
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:04,800
Joey, how do you feel
about fucking this man's wife?

771
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,760
Fuck you!

772
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,142
Tell me where he is!

773
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,936
- Tell me where he is.
- You've just got to be patient,

774
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:20,774
because he's coming for you.., soon!

775
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,248
Clean that shit up.

776
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:55,184
Yeah, give me Detective Lagrange,
Jimmy Lagrange.

777
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,771
It's Ray Shane. Trust me,
he'll know who it is.

778
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,941
Where are you, Ray?

779
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,777
Jimmy, I'm in big trouble, man.

780
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,403
You got to meet me down at Fairfax--

781
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,572
You got some fucking balls,
calling me after what you did.

782
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,657
What are you talking about?

783
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,202
Yeah, we're all here
looking at your handiwork

784
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,079
over at Charlie Blackstone's.

785
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,081
Did you have to kill
the wife, Ray? Seriously?

786
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,500
- Holy shit.
- Was she getting in your way too?

787
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,126
You got to believe me.

788
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,836
Jimmy, I didn't have
anything to do with that.

789
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:25,422
I swear, man, I didn't have
anything to do with that.

790
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,508
Well, ain't that interesting, 'cause we
got an eyewitness who called in,

791
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,094
says he saw you
with Blackstone earlier today.

792
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,512
And we got your
blood-stained pocket knife

793
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,222
laying right beside the old lady.

794
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,475
Jimmy, this ain't right, man.

795
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,144
Someone's-- this ain't right.

796
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,313
- Jimmy, is that him?
- Yeah, its him.

797
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,357
- He called in from a payphone.
- Give me the phone. Now!

798
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,525
We got a trace on it.

799
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,068
- Keep him talking.
- I got it. I got it.

800
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,571
- Ray?
- Don't believe any of this shit.

801
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,156
You listen to me.

802
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,700
I'm gonna give you one chance, okay?

803
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,245
If you don't come in right now,

804
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,373
there is gonna be nothing
that is gonna get in my way

805
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,959
from personally strapping you
to the electric chair.

806
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,753
- Do you hear me?
- Fuck.

807
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,465
Ray?

808
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,803
Find him!

809
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,391
Oh no.

810
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,107
Hello?

811
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,984
Jenny, you got to get out
of your apartment now!

812
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,319
What? Ray, what are you talking about?

813
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,613
Just get out now!
Leave everything! Just go!

814
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,073
Meet me at the Riley in 10 minutes.

815
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,159
Just get out now! Go!

816
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,268
You've gotta fill me in, Ray.

817
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,687
What's happened? What's going on?

818
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,440
I found one of the shooters.

819
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:11,069
A guy named Dylan Sylvester.

820
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,113
He told me that someone
from inside the House

821
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,907
- set up the robbery.
- Who?

822
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,326
- He didn't know.
- There were four guys there, right?

823
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,537
Dead, they're all dead. He said
they showed up to exchange the cash

824
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,332
and somebody opened fire on 'em.
He's the only one that got away.

825
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,375
Okay, so where is he now?

826
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,086
Can't you go to the cops?

827
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,630
I tried. I tried.

828
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,381
Everything's leading back to me.

829
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,301
What about Charlie?

830
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,095
Doesn't he have an in with Carlos?

831
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,181
Charlie's wife was murdered tonight.

832
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,434
He's probably not far behind.

833
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,234
Charlie told me the only way

834
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,361
to clear my name
with Vinnie and the old man

835
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,781
was to get the cash and the shooters,

836
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,533
and the shooters are all dead.

837
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,619
I got to find that money.

838
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,376
Fuck.

839
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,424
What?

840
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,939
I ordered you a whiskey, neat.

841
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,817
Hmm. I gotta say,

842
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,986
I was surprised to hear from you.

843
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,740
A girl can change her mind, can't she?

844
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,825
Where you been?

845
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:25,370
You haven't been at work in days.

846
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,247
I quit.

847
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:30,709
Decided it was time
to move on to something new.

848
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,502
Is that right?

849
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:37,090
- Maybe I can help you.
- Maybe you can.

850
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,176
Hmm.

851
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,178
Coffee.

852
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,431
You still looking for Ray?

853
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,353
What do you know about it?

854
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,356
I know he fucked me over
like he did you.

855
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,441
I don't owe him a goddamn thing,

856
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,486
but in 15 minutes my phone is gonna ring

857
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,529
and my friend on the other line

858
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:02,157
is gonna tell me exactly where he is.

859
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,160
Who's this friend of yours?

860
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,537
She's a nurse.

861
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,041
Apparently you
roughed him up pretty hard

862
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,086
the other night 'cause she patched him.

863
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,172
Supposed to drop off
painkillers sometime

864
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,674
later this afternoon.

865
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,135
Where?

866
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,473
What's it worth to you?

867
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:29,476
You got my attention.

868
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,456
This is a waste of my fuckin' time.

869
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,291
Call me after you speak to your friend.

870
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,376
I still haven't heard a price.

871
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,920
2500, if it's legit.

872
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,089
Let's make it an even five
and you have a deal.

873
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,175
Hmm. For 5,000,

874
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,135
you gotta put something
sweet into the pot.

875
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,434
2500 it is.

876
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,227
Huh.

877
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,230
Rachel?

878
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:59,483
Jenny, Tony's in on it.

879
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,318
You got to get out of there now.

880
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,820
Really? What time?

881
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,448

01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:16,166
Yeah. You did good.

884
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,002

885
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,421

922
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,902
The man's got a gun, wants to talk.

923
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,320
I suggest we listen.

924
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,198
Everybody just be cool.
Just hear me out.

925
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:56,201
You pull a gun on me, kid,

926
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,578
you better have something

927
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,830
All right. All right.

928
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,209
All right. Look at that.

929
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,169
Open that up.

930
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,796
What's this?

931
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,674
It belongs to her husband.

932
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:14,552
He smokes. So do I.
So do you. So fuckin' what?

933
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,013
No, the Lazy T Motel, room 25.

934
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:19,599
I found that in Tony's car today.

935
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,435
That's where him and his boys killed
Walter and left him for the police.

936
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:25,146
He was the missing doorman
at the House the night it got robbed.

937
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,650
- And you can prove this?
- No, not yet.

938
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:32,320
Look, I know what you've been told

939
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:36,574
and, believe me,
the last place that anybody

940
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:38,743
who had anything to do
with this robbery would want to be

941
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,829
is right here, standing in front of you.

942
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,789
I can't believe you're
taking this shit seriously.

943
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,332
Dylan Sylvester was one of the shooters.

944
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,792
He told me it was an inside job.

945
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,544
Somebody from inside
the House set up the robbery.

946
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:51,423
- Yeah, it was you, you son of a bitch!
- Shut the fuck up. Go on.

947
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,174
I don't wanna spend
the rest of my life looking

948
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,428
- over my shoulder, Mr. Marcella.
- A lot of guys would have.

949
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:57,846
Maybe if they had an extra 300 grand

950
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,472
in their pocket, but I don't.

951
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,141
Charlie told me that her husband

952
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:03,309
was pimpin' her out to you.
That way you'd be distracted

953
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:04,936
while he tried
to take over Vinnie's spot.

954
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,856
- You shut the fuck up!
- Well, you tell me,

955
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,108
who authorized us to carry

956
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,027
300 grand the night we got hit?

957
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,947
Vinnie said it was Tony's idea.

958
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,074
Think about it. Think about it, Carlos.

959
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:22,078
I was head of security and I had
no idea we had that much cash on hand.

960
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:25,415
If I'd known, I'd have had security
all over that place.

961
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,418
- You're a fuckin' liar!
- You search their houses, their cars.

962
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,545
I'd bet my life that you find that cash

963
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,380
or at least something else that
proves that they did it.

964
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,050
No! No!

965
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,613
911 . What is your emergency?

966
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,824
Yeah.

967
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:42,992
I was out walking my dog
and I heard gunshots.

968
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,661
Where are you calling from, sir?

969
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,788

970
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,540
The Marcella house on Reeds Lake.

971
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,500
Sir, may I please have your name?

972
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,143
- Hello.
- Meet me at the House, Jimmy.

973
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,436
Ray, I told you I don't wanna be
involved in this.

974

I didn't have anything to do
with Pete getting killed.

1031
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:37,518
Tony said you knew the guys who did it.

1032
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,563
I arrested those scumbags
years ago when I was a cop,

1033
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,899
which means absolutely nothing
unless you're trying

1035
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,611
- Tony said--
- Tony set the whole thing up!

1036
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,865
Why was there so much cash
in the counting room?

1037
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,159
- We were expecting a big crowd.
- And whose idea was it

1038
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,995
- to have that much money on hand?
- Tony said we'd need extra.

1039
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:59,415
That's because he had
four guys coming in to rip you off.

1040
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,086
Tony wants your brother
to get rid of you

1041
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:05,213
so he can run the House.

1042
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:19,644
Vinnie, Tony's wife killed Carlos

1043
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,187
over an hour ago.

1044
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:24,023
Don't you see what's going on?

1045
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:26,484
If Tony makes it look like
I set this whole thing up,

1046
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,277
then I get whacked!

1047
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:30,071
And maybe you get whacked too

1048
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,948
depending on how he plays it.

1049
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,158
Either way he ends up
running this place.

1050
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,870
And he gets to keep the cash as a bonus.

1051
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:40,706
You got it figured out,
don't you, Shane?

1052
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,419
You're like a fucking
pitbull in a dog fight--

1053
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,255
you dig in, you don't let go.

1054
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,757
- You son of a bitch.
- Ray!

1055
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,676
Put the bag down.

1056
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,344
Ah-ah!

1057
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,390
No escape this time, big guy.

1058
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:00,351
Go ahead, open it.

1059
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,813
Come on.

1060
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,369
You stole from me.

1061
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:21,080
You murdered my son.

1062
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,665
That's right.

1063
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,209
My whole fucking life I spent building

1064
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:28,212
this place up with your older brother,
from the ground up.

1065
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,672
And how does he repay me?

1066
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,049
He turns it all over to you.

1067
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:34,552
You were never part of this family.

1068
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,680
Just some fuckin' douchebag
wannabe off the streets.

1069
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:39,140
We gave you everything!

1070
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,726
And I watched you bring it all down.

1071
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,061
That's a fraction

1072
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:47,148
of the money I've seen
you pocket from this place.

1073
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,317
What? You think I was
gonna turn a blind eye,

1074
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,693
watch you fuck it all up?

1075
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,321
You're a dead man, Tony.

1076
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,948
No matter what happens here tonight,

1077
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:57,492
I guaran-fucking-tee you

1078
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,578
you will be hunted like a fucking dog

1079
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,413
to the ends of the earth!

1080
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:13,257
It's my time now!

1081
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,428
It's my time!

1082
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:26,896
It's gonna break Carlos's fucking heart

1083
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,439
when he finds out
you killed his brother.

1084
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:31,817
You're so fuckin' stupid.

1085
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:35,488
Your bitch of a wife
already killed Carlos

1086
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:38,241
right before she took two in her chest.

1087
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,117
What?

1088
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,287
- What the fuck you talking about?
- You don't believe me?

1089
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:46,123
- No, I don't.
- Call her, see if she picks up.

1090
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:47,792
See if she's still fucking the old man.

1091
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:51,963
Just like every Wednesday, right?

1092
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:53,798
Go ahead, call her.

1093
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,384
- No.
- I don't fuckin' believe you.

1094
01:15:56,552 --> 01:16:00,179
Here you go. Here you go,
Tony, it's all yours.

1095
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,557
- Everybody's out of the way.
- Fuck you.

1096
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,350
What the fuck is this?

1097
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,229
Oh man, you're just in time.

1098
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,524
25 grand, Detective-- it's your cut.

1099
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,694
This wasn't our deal.

1100
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:18,072
I should have fucking known
it was you who sold me out.

1101
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,658
You shut the fuck up!
Your first mistake was coming after me.

1102
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,202
- We were partners!
- I got a family to protect!

1103
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,079
Something you don't know anything about.

1104
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,917
Do it.

1105
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,962
No way.

1106
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,171
Do it.

1107
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:37,592
Here's your chance. He shot Vincent.

1108
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,886
Self-defense, right?
So shoot. Now fucking do it.

1109
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,601
Come on.

1110
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:51,689
- Jim.
- Get on your knees, Ray.

1111
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,575
I need units to lonia and Franklin.

1112
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:05,995
Homicide suspect in alley east of lonia

1113
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,457
headed northbound.
Request immediate assistance.

1114
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,127
Move! Move!

1115
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,380
Come on, Jimmy, think about this.

1116
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,093
- Come on, you can't do this.
- Get on your knees, Ray!

1117
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,430
You do this,

1118
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,766
you're gonna be his lap dog
for the rest of your life.

1119
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:28,351
- Shut the fuck up.
- Then what?

1120
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:32,271
Come on, Jimmy.
Are you gonna kill her, huh?

1121
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,315
You're gonna have to.

1122
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,150
Right? No witnesses.

1123
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:38,235
Come on, Jimmy, think about this, man.

1124
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:40,404
You can't do this, not for that scumbag.

1125
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:42,740
Come on, we're friends.
Think about this.

1126
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,200
You can't do this.

1127
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,454
Think about this, Jimmy.

1128
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:10,935
- Come on!
- Okay.

1129
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:25,908
Move it!

1130
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,703
Go!

1131
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,656
Shit! Get down on the floor!

1132
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:33,184
What the fuck are you doing?

1133
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:50,284
- Whoo!
- Get it! Get it!

1134
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:55,539
- Whoo-hoo!
- Look at this!

1135
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,627
- Where is he?
- He went through the door.

1136
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,601
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1137
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:06,694
You couldn't let it go, could you, Ray?

1138
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,446
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

1139
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:11,615
I'll fucking take--

1140
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:16,912
♪ Grease me up with a bucket of sweat

1141
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:21,750
♪ I'm not leaving till
they're heading out, done yet?

1142
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,337
Drop the gun!

1143
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:29,216
Zello, you drop your weapon.

1144
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:30,593
Shane fuckin' did this!

1145
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,679
- No, Tony set up the robbery.
- Shut your fuckin' mouth!

1146
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:36,015
- Hey!
- He killed Walter Randall,

1147
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:37,933
he took out the shooters

1148
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:40,686
and he just shot and killed
Detective Jimmy Lagrange.

1149
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:42,396
I don't care who fuckin' did what.

1150
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,440
I'm a witness. I saw him do it.

1151
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:46,567
All right, I want to see your hands up

1152
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,277
and get down on the ground.

1153
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:50,404
Take it fuckin' easy.

1154
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:54,450
You fuck.

1155
01:21:57,996 --> 01:21:59,622
Ray!

1156
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:03,834
You fuckin' whore.
You fuckin' set me up.

1157
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,753
No!

1158
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,635
Oh my God! Ray.

1159
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:28,567
Shane! You know the drill--

1160
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:31,695
stay on your knees,
hands behind your head.

1161
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:34,114
Nice and slow.

1162
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:41,789
Officer. Officer, cuff him.

1163
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:53,801
Run him out. Call it in.

1164
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,178
Suspect's been apprehended.

1165
01:22:58,264 --> 01:22:59,807
Ray.

1166
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,686
- No, lady. No no.
- He's innocent.

1167
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:05,062
- He's innocent.
- No, ma'am, you can't.

1168
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,815
We're gonna need to tape off the scene.

1169
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:10,025
- Ma'am.
- Don't touch me!

1170
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:12,152
He didn't do anything!

1171
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,571
Ray, you have to
tell them what happened!

1172
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:16,740
- Ray!
- It's okay, Jenny.

1173
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:18,701
He's innocent.

1174
01:23:18,868 --> 01:23:20,661
It's all right.

1175
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,082
- Listen to him. It was Tony.
- Ma'am, you can't see him.

1176
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,167
Get away from me!

1177
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:29,753
Ray!

1178
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:31,130
- Ma'am, you can't see him.
- Get away from me!

1179
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:32,339
- You can't go down there.
- Stop!

1180
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,258
Everything's gonna be
fine now. Trust me.

1181
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:36,427
Listen to him! He didn't do it!

1182
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:38,846
- You can't go--
- Just go with them.

1183
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,806
Get off-- get off me!

1184
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:45,894
Ray.

1185
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,699
I'm so sorry for everything.

1186
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,577
I love you.

1187
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:03,954
Have a great life, Jenny.

1188
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,588
