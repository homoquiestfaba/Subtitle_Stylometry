00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
BELO QUINTO, SOUTHEAST BRAZIL

2
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you the investigator?
- Yes.

3
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank God you've come.

4
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who's in charge here?

5
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Father Alameida was.

6
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look! How much proof do you need?!

7
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Has the statue been removed
from the church for any reason?

8
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. The statue only started crying
on the day Father Alameida died.

9
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The day the doves came back.

10
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The people of the village loved Alameida.

11
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The tears of the Mother
are the blood of Christ.

12
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l suggest you clear the church.
l have to crate the statue up.

13
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Crate it up?
- Yes.

14
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Father Alameida would
never have allowed that.

15
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ma'am? This is Father Alameida's
own rosary...

16
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No, lady, you really shouldn't buy that.
- No, l like it... How much?

17
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You shouldn't do that!
You're stealing from the dead!

18
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee:

19
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the...

20
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No virgin, me

21
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
For l have sinned

22
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l sold my soul

23
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
For sex and gin

24
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go call a priest

25
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All meek and mild

26
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And tell him Mary

27
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is no more a child

28
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's raining stones

29
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's raining bile

30
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
From the luxury

31
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Of your denial

32
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l press alarms

33
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Place bets on truth

34
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm so up and down

35
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And now l'm growing old

36
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Disgracefully

37
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whatever happened to Mary?

38
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whatever happened to Mary?

39
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whatever happened to Mary?

40
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whatever happened to Mary?

41
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whatever happened to...

42
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll spit on floors

43
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And do more drugs

44
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Burn every bill

45
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get drunk on love

46
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wear next to nothing...

47
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, Frankie, sweetheart!

48
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's go. l'm trashed.

49
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you too tired to go home with me?

50
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm tired, not dead.

51
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll be uncareful

52
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll cause such scenes

53
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And l'll never talk

54
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Of used-to-be's

55
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tattoo my face

56
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l won't go grey

57
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Be a dancing queen

58
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm growing old disgracefully

59
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm so up and down

60
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And l love what's not allowed

61
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l was lost

62
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now l see

63
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And now l'm growing old disgracefully

64
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, hi, Mom.

65
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How do you do that?
How did you know that was me?

66
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have the most persistent ring l know.

67
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I just wanted to say hi while
l'm near a phone. How are you?

68
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where are you?

69
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Belo Quinto, near Rio.

70
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mom, hold on, l'm getting another call.

71
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hello?

72
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's about time. Where you been, baby?

73
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l hate it when you just leave.
You could say goodbye.

74
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why?

75
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
''Why?'' Forget it.

76
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, l got my mom on the other line.
I'll see you tonight.

77
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right, I'll see you later.

78
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mom? Hi, l'm back.

- Yeah, l got it yesterday.

80
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What did you think? Did you open it yet?
- Hold on, l'm gonna change phones.

81
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What do you think? Did you get a chance
to look at everything?

82
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm opening it now.

83
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Pretty postcards.
- Aren't those pretty?

84
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Cute brush.
- l saw a lady make that.

85
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- A little hat.
- lt's probably for a little doll.

86
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- A necklace?
- lt's not really a necklace. lt's a rosary.

87
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where did you get it?
- This little village...

- Belo Quinto.

89
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l took a little side trip.
So, the presents, do you love 'em?

90
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm so glad we talked.
l'm going on that cruise.

91
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We won't talk for a month. l have to run.

92
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Have fun. l love you.
l'm glad you called, Mom. Bye.

93
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Can l get two lattes, please? Low fat.
- Got it.

94
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Just one. l'm OK.
- A bacon and egg sandwich, too.

95
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To go. What's up?
You're not eating today?

96
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l threw up this morning
from the smell of tea.

97
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Late?

98
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Like a week.
- A week?

99
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l don't know. A few days. l feel weird.

100
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're so dramatic.

101
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l think you're just psyching yourself out.

102
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l feel like my heart
went to go live in my stomach.

103
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK, it's not traumatic!

104
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What if l'm having a baby?
- With Steven?

105
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What if l'm bringing a person
into this world?

106
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Man, what if? You've got options.

107
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l don't want to think about it.
lt's making me cranky.

108
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's get our tired asses to work
cos we are late.

109
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're always late. There's nothing new.

110
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ciao, bello!

111
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That is very kind of you,

No problem!

00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Father Andrew Kiernan, welcome back.
- Cardinal Houseman.

117
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
These are interesting. What's the trick?

118
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To be honest, l don't know.

119
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They probably made a fortune out of her.

120
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's... What was this?

121
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Infrared photographs of tears.
The statue's at room temperature,

122
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but the tears show up
as white because...

123
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Because they're warm.
- Warm tears?

124
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

125
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My lab report and analysis confirm that
the blood is not only warm, but... human.

126
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l know what you're thinking,
but with all due respect, Daniel,

127
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
this isn't a fake. lt's solid stone.
There is no scientific explanation.

128
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andrew, you were sent to Brazil

129
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to investigate the appearance of
the Virgin Mary on the side of a building.

130
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, but in São Paulo l heard
about the statue, so l investigated.

131
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And?
- And what?

132
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- The face of the Virgin Mary?
- lt's an oxidation stain

133
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
caused by rainwater running down
untreated side walls.

134
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Causes an optical illusion
of a veiled woman.

135
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good. We'll consider the matter closed.

136
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Father Dario has your next assignment.

137
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l was hoping that perhaps you could
send me back to Belo Quinto.

138
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why?

139
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Because l need to do
some more tests on the statue.

140
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You've left the statue in Belo Quinto?

141
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes. l was going to take it back,

142
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but when l saw the effect
it had on the people...

143
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's become a cornerstone of their faith.

144
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andrew, the cornerstone
of their faith is the Church,

145
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
not a crying statue.

146
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You represent the Catholic Church

147
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and the Congregation
of the Causes of the Saints.

148
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, l'm very well aware of that, Daniel,
but as a scientist l observe the facts.

149
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the facts are that this statue
has tears of blood.

150
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lf that's the case,
you know the policy.

151
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The statue is brought back to the Vatican.
We conduct expert tests.

152
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Geologist, engineers, medical examiners.

153
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We've examined 50 or 60 crying statues
in the last 12 months.

154
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not a single one of them has...

155
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, l'm aware of that, but l wanted you
to know that in my opinion

156
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l think that this is different.

157
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l won't allow you to go back to Brazil.

158
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We'll send a geologist, and if he sees fit
we'll send the statue back for tests.

159
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Father Dario, get me all the information
you can on this church in Belo Quinto.

160
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you, Andrew.

161
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you.

162
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l have never seen him this way before.

163
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andrew's problem is he can't decide
if he's a scientist or a priest.

164
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie,
you are gonna drive yourself crazy.

165
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

166
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lf you're worried about being pregnant,
let's go to the store and get a test.

167
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Give it a couple of days.
- Are you sure?

168
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l'm fine. Stop mothering me!
- All right, girlfriend. I'll call you later.

169
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK, bye. Drive safe.

170
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Late?
- Like a week.

171
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're always late. There's nothing new.
- What if l'm bringing a person

172
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- into this world?
- Frankie, you've got options.

173
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Nurse, what's going on?
l don't understand.

174
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Get out of the way!
- Frankie, can you hear me?

175
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm right here with you.

176
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's go!

177
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why is there so much blood?

178
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get me a clamp right now.

179
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right, CBC, electrolytes,
UA, tox screen.

180
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get me a pulse box, stat!

181
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Get me a tox screen and a stat CT.
- Heart rate is irregular.

182
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Blood pressure's off the map.
195 over 120.

183
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Let's change cuffs.
- Where's the lV?

184
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm calling it. Code blue.
Get the paddles. Get some gel.

185
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK, ready?

186
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Get the paddles.
- All right, clear.

187
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Temperature and blood pressure
are back to normal.

188
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who are you?
- l'm Dr Reston.

189
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Do you know what your name is?
- What happened?

190
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where am l?
- You're in the emergency room.

191
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You were found unconscious.
Do you remember anything?

192
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

193
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Jesus!

194
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can l get some more help over here?
We need some four-by-fours.

195
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We have a very deep laceration here.
Oh, my God, it's gone right through.

196
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Miss, you can't go in there.

197
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Doctor, l just need to know what's...

198
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She'll be fine.
Please have a seat. Thank you.

199
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
These are puncture wounds
caused by the entry of a sharp object.

200
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you in any pain?

201
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. That's weird, isn't it?

202
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wow, will you look at that!
it only bleeds when l touch it.

203
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maybe you should not touch it.

204
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Both wounds are identical.
The same size, same shape.

205
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She missed the main artery
by less then a centimetre.

206
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You keep saying ''she''. l didn't do this.

207
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's happening in your life, Frankie?
Do you have a lot of stress at work?

208
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l cut hair.

209
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Any trouble with a significant other?

210
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yes.
- And that is?

211
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm not very significant.

212
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, how long's this gonna take?
l wanna go home.

213
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You should stay here.
We need to get a handle on this.

214
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's nothing to get a handle on.

215
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l won't kid you. With wounds like this,
it's obvious they were self-inflicted.

216
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You think l did this?

217
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
it would never happen.

218
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l love being me. Ask anyone.

219
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie,

220
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
turn the light off, honey,
and come to bed.

221
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you smell flowers
in here or something?

222
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

223
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Smells like jasmine
or hyacinth or something.

224
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l don't smell anything.

225
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You need anything?

226
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

227
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good night.

228
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good night.

229
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l'm here to see Brother Delmonico.
- You've got to sign in.

230
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I'll only be five minutes.
- Everyone has to sign in.

231
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Duty-free.

232
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Welcome back, Andrew.
- Gianni, come stai?

233
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
God is good.

234
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So how was Belo Quinto?

235
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How do you know about Belo Quinto?
l was sent to São Paulo.

236
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- God lives here. We know everything.
- Oh, yes, l forgot.

237
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So how are you doing?

238
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l don't know.

239
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l don't know.

240
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l travel round the world
investigating... miracles.

241
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And then l disprove them.

242
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The real miracle is
anybody believes anything.

243
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l don't know what l'm doing.
- None of us know what we are doing.

244
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- So what are you working on?
- l have no idea.

245
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How can you translate something
if you've no idea?

246
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm a linguist.
l translate words, not their relevance.

247
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- But this one is a second-century gospel.
- How many is that now?

248
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l've helped translate about 1 5.

249
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That only leaves 20 still to go.

250
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So there are... what? 35 gospels?

251
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Everyone had a different experience
of Jesus, so they wrote different stories.

252
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All the gospels,
they are interpretations,

253
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
memories,

254
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
dreams, reflections.

255
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And there's no one gospel
in Jesus' actual words?

256
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're all blind men in a cave,

257
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
looking for the candle
that was lit 2,000 years ago.

258
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So what's in this text?

259
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l was only given every third page.

260
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why?
- The most sensitive documents

261
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
are always divided into threes among us.

262
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
One third to the Dominicans,
one third to the Franciscans,

263
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and one third to us Jesuits.

264
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The truth of any document
is only known to a very powerful few.

265
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's typical of this place, isn't it?

266
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We live in a highly competitive world,
Andrew.

267
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Church is no exception.

268
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Nothing ever gets out of here, does it?

269
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Unless, of course, they want it to.

270
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Both wounds are identical.
Same size, same shape.

271
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She missed the main artery
by less than a centimetre.

272
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You think l did this?

273
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's happening in your life, Frankie?

274
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- So, Jen, tell us about your date.
- it was with a tax lawyer.

275
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A tax lawyer?

276
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When l met him he seemed cool.

277
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, hi, you guys.

278
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

279
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Really OK, or just OK?

280
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm fine. So how's my day looking?

281
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l started your first client
and you're booked solid.

282
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thanks. Wanna come over here?

283
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK, well, go back to Jen and dish the dirt.

284
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So,

285
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
he seemed pretty cool.

286
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Divorced, but no kids.

287
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But he left the table in the middle of
dinner to call his mother in Oregon.

288
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Major points for the long-distance mom.

289
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah. You know,
l thought l'd give him a shot,

290
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but you won't believe what he did.

291
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Every single time he took
a bite of his steak,

292
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
he growled. He growled!

293
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Shit!

294
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stop! There's a baby!

295
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stop!

296
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wait!

297
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's a baby!

298
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie, what are you doing!

299
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where's the baby?!

300
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Watch it, lady!

301
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Frankie!
- Where's the lady! Did you see her!

302
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She dropped her baby!

303
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie, there was no baby, honey.
There's no baby and there's no lady.

304
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's happening?
- No, honey, it's...

305
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There was a lady. l saw her!

306
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- There was not a lady.
- She dropped her baby!

307
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l swear... l swear!

308
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l just wanna get you home, OK?

309
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You all right?

310
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We'll be home in a minute.

311
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Frankie...
- Hey, you!

312
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you speaking to me?
- Are you Andrew Kiernan?

313
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andrew Kiernan? No.
My name's Father Durning.

314
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
May l help you?

315
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No-one can help me now. l'm fucked.

316
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Passengers please exit the train.

317
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Somebody help!

318
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie Paige?

319
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're gonna schedule some more tests

320
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- for this afternoon around four.
- Did you run a pregnancy test?

321
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

322
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Am l pregnant?

323
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

324
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Was l?
- l don't know.

325
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Take this, all of you, and drink from it,
for this is the cup of my blood,

326
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
shed for you, and for all men,
so that sins may be forgiven.

327
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do this in memory of me.

328
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is the blood of Christ.

329
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is the blood of Christ.

330
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is the blood of Christ.

331
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, am l psychotic, or dying, or both?

332
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, none of the above.

333
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Actually,
l think that you are quite rational,

334
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and despite your wounds
you're in very good health.

335
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But there is another possibility
that is of concern.

336
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,228  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Epilepsy.

337
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Epilepsy?

338
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We've run some preliminary tests,

339
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and, all things considered,
l think it might explain a lot.

340
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But that seems impossible.

341
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How can you just wake up one day
and have that?

342
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, you can't, but, uh,
you described blunt trauma to the head,

343
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
disturbing hallucinations.
You're hearing voices.

344
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- These could all indicate epilepsy.
- So what do we do now?

345
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're gonna insert some electrodes
into the upper neo-cortex.

346
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wait a minute, wait.
You want to put wires inside my head?

347
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie, we're gonna do whatever we can
to find out what's causing this.

348
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You hang in there.

349
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Epilepsy?

350
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You should get a second opinion.
- Miss Paige?

351
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm Father Durning.

352
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You spoke to me on the train.

353
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l'd like to talk about what happened.
- Why?

354
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you know what the stigmata are?

355
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Father,
l gotta get Frankie home. Thanks.

356
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l understand how you feel, but please
call me if you change your mind.

357
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andrew, come in.

358
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l think we've found your next assignment.

359
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l was hoping you'd changed your mind
about sending me to Belo Quinto.

360
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We have no record
of a church in Belo Quinto.

361
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What? That's impossible.
There must be some mistake.

362
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No mistake, Father.
l have checked into it myself.

363
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lf there is a church in Belo Quinto,
it is not one of ours.

364
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And no record of a priest there, either.

365
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This was sent by a Father Durning in
Pittsburgh, from the train security camera.

366
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What are we supposed to be looking for?

367
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Watch.

368
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stop.

369
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Obviously it is some sort of attack.

370
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maybe possession.
The wrists are bandaged.

371
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
According to Father Durning,
she was whipped repeatedly

372
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
by an unseen force.

373
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How important is this really, Daniel?
- We don't know yet.

374
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then why are you sending me?

375
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Because of this clipping
from the Pittsburgh Globe.

376
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
''Twenty terrified witnesses...
unexplained wounds...

377
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..Catholic priest.''
The publicity is unfortunate,

378
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but by the time l get there
it will have blown over.

379
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're investigating this one.

380
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know what l heard?

381
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Catholic priest in the paper said
that it was something like...

382
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie.

383
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie.

384
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, l feel like l should do a monologue.

385
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, Cheryl. Come on over here
and have a seat. I'll just be a second.

386
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know what?
l think l'm just gonna wait for Donna.

387
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh. OK.

388
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's going on with her?
- She wants to get a second opinion.

389
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- They think she might have epilepsy.
- Epilepsy?

390
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She doesn't look too good.

391
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why is she even at work?
- Hey! Would you guys stop whispering

392
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
like this was a goddamn church!

393
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hi.
- Hello.

394
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you have an appointment, or...

395
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, l don't.

396
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Would you like a haircut, a manicure,
or maybe you'd like your nipples pierced?

397
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, maybe if we just start with a trim,
we could go from there.

398
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Thank you.
- Come on. Have a seat.

399
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Here we go. I'll put this cape on
so you don't get a scratchy neck.

400
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you.

401
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So, where are you from?

402
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l live in Rome, actually.

403
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Cool.
- And you?

404
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l'm from Naples.
- Naples.

405
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Naples, la città più bella del mondo.

406
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Naples, Florida.
l moved here to go to school.

407
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Which school?

408
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Claudia's University of Cosmetology.
See, l'm accredited.

409
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh. Cool.

410
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Am l going crazy,
or is Frankie hitting on a priest?

411
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What do l call you? l feel weird
calling a guy l could date ''Father''.

412
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l mean, l couldn't date you,
but... you know.

413
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,228  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, no, you just made my day.

414
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you. You can call me Andrew.

415
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andrew Kiernan, that's my name.

416
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Donna.

417
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l know this is gonna sound
kinda strange, but

418
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've sorta been expecting you.

419
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- So, you live in Rome?
- Yes, but l travel a lot, so l'm rarely there.

420
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Thank you.
- Coffee, honey?

421
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, thanks.
So what brings you to Pennsylvania?

422
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Father Durning asked us
to speak to you, Miss Paige.

423
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Us? Who's us?
l thought you were a priest.

424
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l am, but l'm also an investigator.
l work for a division in the Vatican

425
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
called the Congregation for
the Causes of the Saints.

426
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Do you mind if l switch this on?
- No, go ahead.

427
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What is... What is your full name?

428
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie Paige.

429
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And your age?
- 23.

430
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And... which church do you attend?
- l don't attend church.

431
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But you are Catholic?

432
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, l don't go to church
because l don't believe in God.

433
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well... that's gonna be it for me.
That's all l need to know, Miss Paige.

434
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's it?

435
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

436
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You see, stigmatics are
deeply religious people.

437
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And there's no exceptions?

438
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No.
- Well, why do they get stigmata?

439
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When Christ died on the cross
he... he died with

440
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
five wounds.

441
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
His back was scourged by whips.

442
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There were gashes in his forehead
from a crown of thorns.

443
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There were nails driven through
his hands and feet.

444
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And finally a spear

445
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
driven through his side.

446
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Throughout history

447
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
only deeply devout people have been

448
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
afflicted with these wounds.

449
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why?

450
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There is no scientific explanation.

451
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All stigmatics are haunted
by such intense spiritual pain.

452
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In some ways it affects them physically.
They're assaulted by visions of evil,

453
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and they manifest this battle
in their bodies.

454
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Church, on the other hand,
regards it as a gift.

455
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A gift from God.

456
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A gift? Can l give it back?

457
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen, Father, can l show you these
and you could tell me what you think?

458
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes. Yes, of course.

459
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Coffee, honey?

460
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, what do you think?

461
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- it doesn't really matter what l think.
- What does that mean?

462
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
it means officially
this is not a case for the Church.

463
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To say that a self-confessed atheist
exhibits the wounds of Christ

464
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- is a contradiction in terms.
- Here.

465
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Read that. l found that on my kitchen
table the other morning.

466
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now, l don't know what that says,
but that handwriting is mine.

467
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's ltalian.

468
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt says, ''Split a piece of wood
and l'm there.''

469
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
''Lift a stone and you will find me.''

470
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- lt's quite beautiful, actually.
- This isn't beautiful!

471
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is a warning!
lt means no matter what l do,...

472
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Miss Paige...
- ..l can't escape it.

473
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Miss Paige, l would really like to help...
- You know what?

474
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is not going anywhere.
You don't know what this is.

475
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You can't give me an answer.
Coffee's on me. Here.

476
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There is no scientific explanation.

477
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stigmatics are deeply religious people.

478
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're gonna do whatever we can

479
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to find out, but, all things considered,
l think it might explain a lot.

480
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Throughout history,
only people who believe deeply in God

481
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
have been afflicted with these wounds.
The nearer they come to God,

482
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the more open they are
to the torment of their demons.

483
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Church regards it as a gift.

484
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A gift from God.

485
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Here's to Friday night.
- Yeah. To Friday night, honey.

486
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie!

487
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't worry. Order another drink.
I'll be right back. l'm gonna check it out.

488
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
 But you just can't tell

489
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
 Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

490
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Hey.

491
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's up? l thought you were resting.
- Have you seen Steven?

492
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Forget about Steven.
What's up with that priest?

493
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Believe me, he's all business.

494
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, can we get two doubles each?

495
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, you know what's scarier
than not believing in God?

496
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Believing in him.

497
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l mean really believing in him
is a fucking terrifying thought.

498
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's Friday night.
You're taking things too seriously.

499
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lf there is a God, he hates me.
He's ruining my life.

500
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie, it's gonna be all right. Man, relax.

501
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't get it, do you?
l have fucking holes through my wrists!

502
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l have slashes across my back!

503
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lf it isn't God that's doing this to me,
then who is?

504
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l think you're losing it, man.

505
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where you goin'?

506
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie!

507
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie!

508
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie, get up!

509
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get up! Frankie!

510
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't just fuckin' stand there!
Call an ambulance!

511
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Damn.

512
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie, where are you?!

513
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get out of there!

514
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Miss Paige?

515
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie!

516
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Let's get you outta here.
- Frankie.

517
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- We need to get her to a safe place.
- Here, l got you. l got you.

518
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Welcome back.
- Where am l?

519
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're in Father Durning's church.

520
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Here.

521
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l think she should get some rest.

522
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You all right?

523
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You look like shit.

524
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt smells like...

525
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
flowers.

526
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You've got stuff all in your hair.

527
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Pronto.

528
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Gianni, come stai?
- Andrew, how are you?

529
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Gianni, listen...

530
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Could you translate something?
- Si. Do you have it there?

531
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, l have it here. I'll play it.

532
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thama...

533
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Well, what is it? Is it gibberish?
- No, it's not gibberish at all.

534
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who is speaking?

535
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Morning, Miss Paige. You're up early.
- Hey, l think you made a mistake.

536
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What do you mean?
- l can't have stigmata.

537
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Jesus was crucified through
the palms of his hands, not his wrists.

538
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My wounds are through the wrists.
So you're wrong.

539
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Actually, scientists have discovered that
in Roman times people were crucified

540
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
through the wrists, not the palms.

541
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The hands couldn't support
the body weight,

542
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
so they did crucify them
through the wrists.

543
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, wait, you're telling me
that every painting,

544
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
every statue of Christ,

545
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
every single crucifix
in the whole world is wrong?

546
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, no, just inaccurate.
They're impressions of the truth.

547
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Icons are meant to be inspirational.

548
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Miss Paige,
there's something else you should know.

549
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The words you keep repeating
that, uh, you thought were nonsense.

550
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's not.

551
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's actually a very specific language.
lt's a form of Aramaic.

552
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What?

553
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's a form of Aramaic
that hasn't been used for 1900 years.

554
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's a dialect that was used in Galilee
around the time of Jesus.

555
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Split a piece of wood and l am there.

556
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Lift a stone and you will find me.

557
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Did you get through?
- No.

558
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Her machine didn't even pick up.

559
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Miss Paige?

560
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie?

561
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who are you?

562
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The messenger is not important.

563
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l feel like my heart is breaking.

564
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why am l so sad?

565
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
it smells like flowers in here.

566
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Like... jasmine or...

567
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..rose or something.

568
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Can you smell that?
- Yes, l can.

569
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who wrote that?
- You did.

570
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l wrote that?!
- Yes.

571
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Have you heard from Father Andrew?
- No, Eminence.

572
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He hasn't filed a report.
- What are these?

573
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
These are newspaper clippings
from our office in New York.

574
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The first one is from Pennsylvania.

575
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The others are from New York
and Washington.

576
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
These are even more damaging.
This one mentions the stigmata.

577
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He isn't defusing the situation.
- Shall l call him home?

578
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Have him conclude his investigation
and report to me in New York next week.

579
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie, can you please come over here
and have a look at this?

580
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l just can't believe that none of this
means anything to you.

581
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie?

582
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie, can you please...

583
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can you please look at this?

584
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sometimes subjects retain fragments
or images that can be transmitted

585
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
subconsciously.

586
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This subject doesn't retain
fragments of images.

587
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't get it, do you, Father Kiernan?
l don't know what the hell that means!

588
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l don't know what the hell this means.
l just want my life back, OK?

589
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
 l'm sitting amongst yourselves

590
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
 Don't think you can see me

591
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
 l haven't gone anywhere

592
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
 But out ofmy body

593
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
 Reach out and touch me

594
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
 Make effort to speak to me

595
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
 Call out and you'll hear me

596
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
 Be happy for me...

597
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Miss Paige?

598
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Miss Paige, l'm sorry.

599
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't ''Miss Paige'' me
just because you messed up.

600
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm not gonna let you off the hook.

601
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK, but l am sorry.

602
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know, for a priest
you're pretty relentless.

603
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah, l guess l stopped being a priest
and slipped back into being a scientist.

604
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It happens.

605
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, what kind of a scientist
is a priest, anyway?

606
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't want to know.

607
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, yes, l do!

608
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You were an organic chemist?

609
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did you walk around
with those glasses

610
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
with Scotch tape around the sides,
and pocket protectors?

611
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l did, actually.

612
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Anyway, one day l just decided that
l was going to become a priest.

613
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why?

614
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- The holes.
- The holes?

615
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- The holes in the theories.
- What theories?

616
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The world is six billion years old.

617
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's been life for three billion years,
but before that there was nothing.

618
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No life.
Just a bunch of elements swirling around.

619
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And then one day,
for no apparent reason whatsoever,

620
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
all these elements
came together in perfect harmony

621
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and there was suddenly life.

622
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Living things like lilac
and... and hedgehogs and...

623
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Beer and... cheesecake.

624
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Beer and cheesecake.
Did you know monks invented alcohol?

625
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yeah. Everybody knows that.
- You knew that?

626
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah.

627
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, anyway, to get back to the big hole.
There really...

628
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There really isn't any explanation.

629
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And, l figured that
there was something more than

630
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
well, more important than
organic chemistry going on,

631
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and l figured that... it was God.

632
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And that God was responsible
for all this... life.

633
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l really can't get a line on you.
- Why not?

634
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l can't understand a man who's never...
- Never made love to a woman?

635
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, this may come
as a great surprise to you, but

636
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l wasn't born a priest.

637
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You didn't like it?
- What's not to like?

638
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- But you don't miss it?
- Yes, of course l miss it.

639
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l mean, l'm human, you know.

640
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l struggle with it, but I've made a choice.
Basically, I've exchanged

641
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
one set of complications for another.

642
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So this is the fourth?

643
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What do you mean?
- When l first met you,

644
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
didn't you say that
there were five wounds?

645
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, this is the fourth. What's the fifth?

646
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The spear.

647
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's the wound that killed him.

648
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't worry, Frankie.

649
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No stigmatic has ever received
the full five wounds.

650
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Have you ever met another person
who had stigmata?

651
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l did make a pilgrimage to a small village
in the mountains of southern Italy.

652
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There l met a priest called Padre Pio.

653
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He first received the wounds
when he was 23 years of age,

654
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the same age as Saint Francis of Assisi.

655
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who's Saint Francis of Assisi?

656
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:01,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Saint Francis was the first person
to receive the stigmata, in the 1 3thC.

657
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He was a wild young man,
who suddenly changed his ways

658
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
after he'd had a vision
of being crucified alongside Christ.

659
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When he woke up, his hands
and his feet were... were bleeding.

660
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This priest,
were his wounds as bad as mine?

661
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Padre Pio.

662
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:23,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sometimes he lost a pint of blood a day.
And he suffered terrible demonic attacks.

663
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A priest?

664
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:29,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All stigmatics suffer
the most intense spiritual conflict.

665
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The nearer they come to God,

666
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the more open they are to temptation,
to evil visions,

667
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to the torment of their demons.

668
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:43,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A smell accompanies the wounds.
The odour of sanctity, the smell of...

669
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Flowers?

670
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

671
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Flowers.

672
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, what happened to him?

673
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How many wounds did he receive?

674
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He...

675
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He lived to old age.

676
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How many wounds did he receive?

677
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Two.

678
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm dying, aren't l?

679
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This thing is killing me.

680
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Here's a closer shot.

681
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My guess is it's probably Aramaic.

682
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Aspetta.

683
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm looking at it.

684
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
ls there a... ls there a problem, Gianni?

685
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes. Don't send me any more pictures.

686
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How many did you send?
- Six. Why?

687
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- The problem is what it says.
- Well, what does it say?

688
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
it says, ''The kingdom of God is
inside you, and all about you.''

689
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andrew, forget you saw this.

690
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Drop it immediately.
- Gianni, what is the problem?

691
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you remember the Gospels...

692
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Gianni? Gianni, are you still there?

693
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you remember
the Gospels Commission?

694
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
it was closed down suddenly
by your friend Cardinal Houseman.

695
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, a few years ago, yes.

696
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We discovered a document that
looked like a completely new gospel.

697
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's the significance?
- l was one of the three

698
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:37,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
translators of this gospel.
lt was written entirely in Aramaic.

699
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The language of Jesus and his disciples.

700
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt may be Jesus's actual words.

701
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's...

702
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where is it now?

703
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Gianni? What's going on?

704
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you there?

705
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:53,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Gianni?

706
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Buona sera.

707
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's this?

708
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is that a painting?

709
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No, it's a mirror.
- Who else was there?

710
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l don't know.
- l thought you said it was just you two.

711
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
16a. Do you have the neg?

712
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who is that?

713
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll be back as soon as l can.

714
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Cardinal Houseman.
- l'm late for a meeting.

715
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l think this might be of interest.
- What is it?

716
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where did you get this?
- lt was e-mailed to Father Delmonico.

717
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- By who?
- Father Kiernan in Pittsburgh.

718
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Do you know what it means?
- No.

719
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
ls it important?

720
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Will you tell the meeting
I'll be with them in a few minutes?

721
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:018 Y2:574
New York City

722
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who is it?

723
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

724
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who's this?

725
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's an old friend.

726
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Delmonico? What's happened?
- The missing Jesus gospel... lt turned up.

727
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's impossible.

728
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:45,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Alameida...

729
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Alameida?

730
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In the United States. Pittsburgh.

731
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Send me something.

732
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. No, l can't.

733
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Houseman will kill me.

734
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hi, come in. The door's open.

735
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Frankie?

736
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l'm in here!

737
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How you doin'? Want a beer?

738
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sure.

739
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Check these out. They're getting better.
- That's great.

740
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Really good.

741
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You'll be able to get
these stitches out soon.

742
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's great.

743
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let me see your forehead.

744
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Does this... Does this hurt?
- No.

745
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Great. You'll...

746
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why did you paint over the wall?

747
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l got bored, and l got sick
of looking at that thing.

748
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l really wish you weren't wearing
that uniform right now.

749
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's got nothing to do with the uniform.

750
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, what is it? You took a vow
to be dead from the neck down?

751
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on!

752
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've seen the way you look at me.
You know the way that l feel about you.

753
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on, l'm not blind. lt's OK.

754
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

755
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why, because l...
l painted the wall out? ls that it?

756
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So now l'm no use to you, right? ls that it?

757
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Answer me!

758
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are so proud of your holy abstinence!

759
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Like touching a woman would kill you!

760
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Women are dirty little complications!

761
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's why you became a priest.

762
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt has nothing to do
with your convenient little stories!

763
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, you're so proud of your church,

764
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
of virgins and eunuchs!

765
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How's your faith these days, Father?

766
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How's your faith these days?!

767
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is what you fucking call God?

768
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Blood of Christ!

769
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:09,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l've never seen you pray before.
- l haven't prayed for a very long time.

770
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come here.

771
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's OK. Come on.

772
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go in.

773
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Daniel.
- We've come to help.

774
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Take her to the archdiocese.

775
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll be downstairs if you need me, Sister.

776
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where did you get this from, hm?
What does it mean?

777
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The girl wrote it.
l don't know what it means.

778
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Neither does she.

779
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why was it painted over?

780
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What language is it in?
- lt's Aramaic.

781
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How do you know that?

782
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- That's irrelevant.
- What l don't understand

783
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
is why you would send this
to anyone other than me.

784
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What are you hiding?
- All l know is

785
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that the girl is fighting for her life.

786
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lf she receives another wound
she's going to die unless we help her.

787
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Right. l'm taking over.

788
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Get some rest.
- l'm not leaving her alone.

789
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're leaving her
in the care of the sisters.

790
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You sent me here.
l didn't want to come.

791
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You told me to deal with her.
That's what l'm doing!

792
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She's in no condition
to take on you or the Church.

793
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is not about a girl
taking on me or taking on the Church!

794
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why are you more concerned
about photographs than a girl dying?

795
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Andrew, where's your loyalty?
- Don't you lecture me about loyalty.

796
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The only reason
you've been tolerated for so long

797
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
is because you were a good scientist.

798
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Because of your objectivity.
Well, you've lost that.

799
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The last thing l expected to see in
that girl's apartment was the two of you

800
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- lying on a bed together.
- Oh, come on!

801
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You think you're helping her,
but you're not. She's getting worse.

802
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andrew, you're in no state to help anyone
right now. You're exhausted.

803
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go to Father Durning's. Get some rest.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

804
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why are you so concerned
with these photographs?

805
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Father Delmonico seemed to think
they were important.

806
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What do they mean?
- We've no idea, but we're working on it.

807
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:46,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- ls it to do with the Gospel Commission?
- We don't know.

808
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good night, Andrew.

809
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andrew Kiernan?

810
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- l'm Kiernan.
- l want to see Alameida.

811
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l don't know any Alameida.

812
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Delmonico faxed me this copy
of his document.

813
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The girl wrote this. l saw her do it.
What is this?

814
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:36,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's maybe the most significant
Christian relic ever found.

815
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why?

816
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's an Aramaic scroll
from the first century,

817
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
discovered near the caves of the
Dead Sea Scrolls, outside Jerusalem.

818
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Alameida and l concluded that

819
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
it is a gospel... of Jesus Christ,

820
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
in his own words... Aramaic.

821
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But there are some factions in the Vatican
who believe that this document

822
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
could destroy the authority
of the modern Church.

823
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How?

824
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:11,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt was Jesus' words to his disciples
on the night of his Last Supper.

825
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:17,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
His instructions to them on how to
continue his church after his death.

826
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why would that be so... so threatening?

827
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When we gave our initial conclusions
to the Gospel Commission,

828
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Houseman ordered us
to stop immediately.

829
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Alameida refused.
He stole the document and disappeared.

830
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Houseman excommunicated us
in our absence.

831
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have no idea where he is?

832
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:38,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He doesn't want to be caught
until he finishes the translation.

833
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll show you this guy.

834
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's Delmonico, me and Alameida.
We were all translating the new gospel.

835
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:48,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've seen this man.
Three weeks ago, in Brazil.

836
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yeah?
- He's dead.

837
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How do you know this?

838
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:56,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Because l saw him in his coffin
in a church in Belo Quinto. l'm sorry.

839
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then it's all over. lt's gone for ever.

840
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why was your work stopped?

841
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What was so threatening
about this gospel?

842
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:11,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Look around you. What do you see?
- l see a church.

843
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
lt's a building.

844
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The true church of Jesus Christ
is so much more.

845
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not in buildings made of wood and stone.

846
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l love Jesus!

847
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l don't need an institution
between him and me.

848
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You see, just God and man.

849
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No priests, no churches.

850
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The first words in Jesus' gospel are,

851
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
''The kingdom of God is inside you,

852
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and all around you.''

853
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
''Not in buildings of wood and stone.''

854
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
''Split a piece of wood and l am there.''

855
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- ''Lift a stone and...
- ..you will find me.''

856
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, brother.

857
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why is Father Alameida wearing gloves?

858
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Alameida was a tormented man.

859
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Holy man. A very holy man.

860
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:06,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He wore the gloves
to cover the marks of the stigmata.

861
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She has the stigmata.

862
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's why.

863
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She's just his messenger.

864
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Houseman will never let
this gospel get out.

865
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Almighty God,
bless your humble servant,

866
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
guide me with your Holy Spirit,
and forgive me

867
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
for l have sinned exceedingly
in thought, word and deed.

868
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My sins deserve your punishments

869
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
because they have crucified
my loving Saviour, Jesus Christ.

870
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Amen.

871
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Lord,

872
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
do not remember our sins,
or those of our forefathers.

873
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where's Andrew?
- And do not punish us for our offences.

874
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Lead us not into temptation.

875
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Save this woman, your servant.

876
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Spirit of lust,
by the power of Jesus Christ

877
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l command you, come out of her body
now and for always.

878
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
ln the name of Jesus Christ
l command you

879
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
come out of her body now
and for always.

880
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
ln the name of Jesus Christ...

881
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are blind men.

882
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your eyes are open.

883
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But you see nothing.

884
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why do you persecute me?!

885
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord!

886
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:16,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Lord, hear my prayer!
Let the enemy have no victory over her!

887
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Behold

888
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
your servant,

889
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
dripping with blood!

890
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Embrace me, my child. l am the Church.

891
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are the true enemy
of the Church, Houseman.

892
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
l am the Church.

893
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Stop!
- Get away from me!

894
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get them out of here!
Get out of here! Get out!

895
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Eminenza!
- Get out!

896
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Save this woman from woe. O Lord,

897
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

931
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:43,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
