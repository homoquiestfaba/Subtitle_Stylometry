You're gonna love it

14
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,700
there Lana. Matthew really
lucked out on this place.

(Dinging)

20
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:37,933
Hey, you guys made it. We did.
Hi Lana.

21
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:46,067
(Nature sounds)

22
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:50,133
Oops. Come on. (Flapping)

23
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,200
Dustin. Get a life. It's just
paper.

24
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:02,133
Hey Jake. Look at that.

25
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:06,300
(Engine starting)

26
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:18,333
Well, here are your new digs.
It's not much, but once you get
it cleaned up

27
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:22,400
and decorated, it can be
pretty rad.

28
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:30,433
We'll let you guys settle in.
Let us know if you need
anything?

29
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:34,333
(Click)

30
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:38,467
So, how about some lunch?

31
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,400
Yeah.

32
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,433
That sounds pretty rad. Oh,
come on.

33
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:47,067
You know that I'm not good at
talking to kids.

34
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:50,400
Just give it some time. You'll
figure it out.

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,433
I have given it some time.

36
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,467
We've been dating almost a year
now and she still acts like she
doesn't know who I am.

37
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,600
Look, Lana hardly talks to
anybody.

38
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,533
She barely talks to me.

39
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:02,600
Yeah, but if she just opened up
a little bit, she'd realize
that I'm actually a pretty cool
dude.

40
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,667
You can't put Lana on the same
level as everyone else.

41
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,700
She's been through a lot.

42
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,633

47
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:51,067
Oh shit. Sheriff Thompson. Oh
fuck. Fuck.

48
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:54,900
Get rid of it! Get rid of it!
No!

49
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,100
I dropped it! Are you fucking
kidding me? Pick it up!

50
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,067
I can't find it. I have to
pull over.

51
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:07,067
Be cool. Found it.

52
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,167
Get rid of that.

53
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:12,200
In your fucking jacket? Are you
kidding me?

54
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,100
What do you want me to do? He's
coming. Be cool.

55
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,300
Be cool. (Slam)

56
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:31,433
Afternoon boys. Hi Officer
Thompson.

57
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,467
Alright, all of you. Out of
the car now.

58
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:43,467
Now!

59
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:55,533
(Static) This is Dubois. Go
ahead.

60
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:23,600
God dammit. You boys are in an
awful lot of trouble.

61
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,667
You know that? Sheriff. Can I
have a word with you for a
moment?

62
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:31,733
Don't move.

63
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:35,767
Get off.

64
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,833
(Coughing)

65
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,933
If I catch you little shits
doing this again, I'm going to
haul your asses down to the
station.

66
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,933
You got that?

67
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:08,067
Move!

68
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:11,933
(Slam) (Engine starting)

69
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:20,267
(Dinging)

70
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,233
Get rid of this shit, will
you?

71
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:32,400
Busting their asses over this?

72
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:40,500

73
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:48,400
(Sizzling)

74
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,667
I hope you guys are hungry.

75
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:56,533
It looks really good honey.

76
00:07:56,533 --> 00:08:00,633
Hey, Jake, go get your
brother. It's time to eat.

77
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:04,567
Mom, he left a while ago. He
left? Where?

78
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,633
He went off with Scott and
Curtis.

79
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:20,767
Now, where are you going?

80
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:24,733
I'm going to sit by the lake.

81
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,767

(Click)

85
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,367
Follow me.

86
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,500
Come running out of the woods,
screaming his head off.

87
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,533
Hey. Look at me.

88
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:33,567
Look at me! You're going to
have to talk to me son. Sheriff.

89
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:37,633
Let me, please.

90
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:41,600
What's his name?

91
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,567
Steve. Steve,

92
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:49,767
Steve, what was it? What did
you see?

93
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:51,800
It was gonna kill me.

94
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,700
What was gonna kill you?

95
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,800
It's in the woods. What's in
the woods Steve.

96
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,700
What did you see?

97
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,733
We're all dead. We're all
fucking dead.

98
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,833
What part of the woods did you
say he came out of?

99
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:13,767
He came running out of that
trail that runs north around
the lake.

100
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,933
You take everybody here and get
an ambulance. We got to get him
to the hospital.

101
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:25,900
I'm gonna take a drive around
the other side of the lake and
see what I can find out.

102
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,933
Alright.

103
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:33,900

104
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,933

(Crunching)

107
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:06,167
Hey Frank.

108
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,167
Listen, I want to talk to you
about Jake. I'm worried.

109
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,133
He's not made any friends since
we've been here.

110
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:14,067
I never see him hanging around
with anyone.

111
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:18,100
Frank!

112
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,133
Frank! What?

113
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:26,133
Will you talk to him?

114
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:30,300
Alright.

115
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,467
(Nature sounds)

116
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:42,367
Jake. Hey dad.

117
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:46,567
How you doing? OK, I guess.

118
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:50,567
OK, listen.

119
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:54,733
Try not to look so sad. You
worry your mother.

120
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:58,667
(Nature sounds)

121
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,833
(Nature sounds)

122
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:20,067
I just thought this would be a
good place to draw.

123
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:23,067
I didn't mean to scare you or
anything.

124
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:26,933
No, you're fine.

125
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:43,067
So, you draw?

126
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:47,133
Yeah. It's just a hobby.

127
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,067
I'm not really that good. Do
you mind if I see?

128
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:55,200
Sure.

129
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:04,100
It's not finished, but you get
the idea.

130
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,133
I like it. Thanks.

131
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,200
My name is Jake by the way.

132
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,133
It's nice to meet you Jake. I'm
Lana.

133
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:15,267
Nice to meet you Lana.

134
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:23,167
(Eerie music)

135
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,167
What the hell?

136
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:28,267
I thought we were going to the
lawn. No man, we're smoking
here today.

137
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:35,200
I don't know man. I've heard
stories about the guy that
lives in here. What kind of
stories?

138
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,300
He killed his wife or
something back in the day and
buried her in the woods.

139
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,400
Where'd you hear that horse
shit from?

140
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,333
Your fucking dad because that's
exactly what it is. Horse shit.

141
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:47,400
Let's fucking go. Come on. I
want to smoke.

142
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,500
(Nature sounds) (Slams)

143
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,500

144
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:07,533
(Ominous music)

00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:19,700
(Nature sounds)

146
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:25,833
Dude, I don't know. I don't
feel right about this. It's
just a barn.

147
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:31,967
Don't be a bitch. Come on.

148
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:36,067
Man, it is creepy as shit in
here.

149
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:40,067
No joke. You two shut the hell
up already.

150
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:43,933
Here. Make yourself useful. Go
roll that up.

151
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:47,967
Man, anyone got a horse for
this fucking chariot over here?

152
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:52,067
Oh yeah.

153
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:56,067
Check this out. Wa-wa-wa.

154
00:14:56,067 --> 00:15:00,300
Be careful with that thing!
Don't be a pussy. It's not even
turned on.

155
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,267
What the hell are you doing in
here? Nothing.

156
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:06,167
Sir. We were just. You were
just what? Trespassing?

157
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,133
We weren't doing anything.

158
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:12,300
Get out. Now!

159
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,400
(Nature sounds)

160
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:32,400
(Nature sounds)

161
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,500
Hey, there's probably something
you should know. What's that?

162
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,067
Steve ain't been quite right
for about a year or so now.

163
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:44,867
We were out east doing a job
and a bear wandered onto the
job site

164
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:48,900
and mauled one of my guys
really bad. Steve seen the
whole thing.

165
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,733
Really spooked him. Really?

166
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:53,900
But the guy lived? He didn't
make it. I don't know.

167
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,733
Maybe it has something to do
with this.

168
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,833
Yeah, I drew most of this back
when I lived

169
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:09,067
in the city. Do you miss the
city at all? Not really.

170
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,067
I like the forest. It's grown
on me.

171
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:16,900
Skyscrapers and city parks get
old after a while.

172
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:24,900
Um,

173
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,133
(Laughter) I drew most of
those back when I was a kid.

174
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:33,133
They're really good. How about
you and your photos?

175
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:37,200
They're nothing special. Can I
see them?

176
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:57,300
These are good.

177
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,333
You should be proud of
yourself. Thanks.

178
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:05,300
Did you take any of the lake
yet? No, I haven't.

179
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,400
Well, how about now? OK.

180
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:25,567
(Click) (Ominous music)

181
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,633
(Ominous music)

182
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:41,700
(Ominous music) Steve.

183
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,733
Are you OK?

184
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:49,767
(Screaming)

185
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:53,833
(Ominous music)

186
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,867
(Screaming) (Thuds)

187
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:01,833
(Ominous music)

188
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:05,867
Lana.

189
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:09,867
Is everything OK?

190
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:13,833
(Ominous music)

191
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,067
(Ominous music)

192
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:26,067
Steve, put the hammer down.
Steve. No!

193
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:29,900
No! Stop this Steve. We're all
dead!

194
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,967
Put the hammer down! We're all
fucking dead! (Gunshot)

195
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:46,067
(Ominous music) What was it?

196
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:50,300
You OK?

197
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,367
Lana.

198
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:02,467
(Ominous music)

199
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:10,533
(Nature sounds)

200
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:18,600
(Nature sounds)

201
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:26,633
(Nature sounds) (Engine
starting)

202
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:14,833
(Ominous music)

203
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:22,867
(Ominous music)

204
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,900
(Ominous music)

205
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,933
(Ominous music)

206
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:47,200
(Ominous music)

207
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:07,300
(Ominous music)

208
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,333
(Ominous music)

209
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:23,400
(Ominous music)

210
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,100
Here's my report. I did do a
little digging on this.

211
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,100
He has no history of violent
behavior.

212
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,233
No mental illness. No criminal
record.

213
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:44,267
The foreman at the site
mentioned something about an
animal attack that occurred
some time ago.

214
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,133
It's possible. I fail to see
how any of this is relevant.

215
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:52,133
I'm just trying to figure out
why he did this. Crazy isn't
enough?

216
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:56,167
Look, he thought he was being
chased by something. An animal
maybe.

217
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,367
Just like what happened
before. It is possible that
there is some sort of

218
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:04,400
connection here. Obviously,
the guy had problems.

219
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,300
Maybe he was just having a bad
day. I don't know.

220
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,500
But in the end, it really
doesn't fucking matter does it
because he's just

221
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,400
as dead.

222
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,600
With all due respect, sir, I
think we need to produce some
sort of closure on this.

223
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,567
Closure? For who?

224
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:24,567
You? I'm thinking that you
might just want to suck it up
and

225
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,533
step back a bit from this
Mitch. Easy for you to say.

226
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:32,667
You didn't have to kill
somebody yesterday. You know
what I did before I came to the
department?

227
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:36,700
No. I was in the marines. I
was sent to places that could
only be described

228
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,733
as hell on earth.

229
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:41,667
I've seen and done things that
no human being should ever have
to experience.

230
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:45,167
So when I tell you to suck it
up, you suck it up.

231
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:52,767
I have better things to do then
waste my time with your
insecurities.

232
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,900
(TV noise)

233
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:17,133
(Laughter)

234
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:21,067
Hey, Frank, Jake, you got to
come see this.

235
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:25,233
Yeah, in a minute honey.

236
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:33,200
Dad,

237
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,300
I have a question. I was
wondering

238
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:43,233
So I met this girl, and I
really don't know how to talk
to her.

239
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,300
Jake, I'm really busy right now

240
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,367
Can we talk about this later?
Alright.

241
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:57,533
(Squeaking)

242
00:24:57,533 --> 00:25:01,467
(Nature sounds)

243
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,567
(Nature sounds)

244
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:13,567
Hey.

245
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:17,633
Hey.

246
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:21,500
So, are you OK?

247
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,600
I'm fine. What happened
yesterday?

248
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,667
I don't really want to talk
about it. OK.

249
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:41,833
Hey, you want to see something
cool? Sure.

250
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:45,833
(Soft music)

251
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:54,167
Have places like this
everywhere. So, I figured
between this and the lake,

252
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:56,133
you should get plenty of
photos. I love it.

253
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:59,267
Have you sketched it yet?

254
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:02,233
No, not really. I'm not out
here enough to finish one.

255
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:06,300
Thanks for showing me this. No
problem.

256
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,400
(Soft music) How are you and
your parents enjoying the

257
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,300
new house?

258
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,433
They're not my parents.

259
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:22,400
I live with my Aunt Susie and
her boyfriend.

260
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,533
Where are you parents? My mom

261
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:30,700
she died when I was little.
I'm sorry Lana.

262
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,567
I didn't know. What happened?

263
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:38,633
I don't really remember. It was
too long ago.

264
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:46,733
(Ominous music)

265
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:50,867
Lana, what's wrong?

266
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:54,867
(Ominous music)

267
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:02,967
(Ominous music)

268
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:07,067
No! No!

269
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:11,100
You cut this up pretty badly.
I didn't mean to startle you
folks.

270
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,233
My social graces aren't what
they used to be. I don't get
many visitors out here.

271
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:19,300
Son, come help me. Let's get
her inside.

272
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,400
(Soft music)

273
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:39,433
(Ripping)

274
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:43,600
Have an interest in gnomes, do
you?

275
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,633
Not really.

276
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:51,667
Just kind of used to scare me
as a kid. Still kind of creep
me out.

277
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:55,833
Oh, it's alright. Everyone has
their fears no matter how old

278
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:59,700
they are. I think this is
gonna be

279
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,733
OK now. Just don't move it
much, OK? Thanks.

280
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:07,967
I'm just happy that it wasn't
any more serious.

281
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:11,867
Oh, your camera. I thought it
was broken.

282
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:15,933
I'm sure it's going to be OK.
What kind of pictures do you
take?

283
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:20,067
Just everything, really?

284
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:23,967
You mind if I see a few? Yeah,
sure.

285
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:27,900
Just press that button.

286
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:35,967
Quite beautiful.

287
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:40,067
Thanks.

288
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:43,967
(Ominous music)

289
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:52,200
(Ominous music)

290
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,267
You two ought to get going.
It's going to be dark

291
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:04,233
soon. You don't want to get
lost in these woods.

292
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:12,167
Thank you again. Don't even
mention it. Just be careful.

293
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,333
Oh, your gnome.

294
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:20,367
No, you keep it. You got to
face your fears sometime.

295
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:24,333
Thanks.

296
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,800
Hello George, how've you been?

297
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,767
As good as I can be, I guess. I
see you haven't kept up with
the farm too much.

298
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:07,767
You know, I remember the corn
you used to grow.

299
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:12,900
Pretty darn good if I do
remember. You didn't come all
the way out here for a friendly
chit-chat.

300
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,967
So, why don't you just tell me
what it is you want. Fine.

301
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:21,033
Yesterday afternoon, a
construction worker wandered
into the woods

302
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:25,133
your woods. A few minutes
later, he comes running out
screaming

303
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,067
something is chasing after
him.

304
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:30,100
A little bit after that he
bashes some guy's head in. Hell
of a mess.

305
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,767
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you,
George?

306
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:37,267
I don't know anything.

307
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:39,167
See, I find that just a little
hard to believe.

308
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:42,200
I mean, with everything that is
going on around here over the
years.

309
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,400
How long has it been?

310
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,467
Strange things that have
happened in this god forsaken
place.

311
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:50,333
I tried telling you before.
There is something not right
around here.

312
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,867
I'm not playing games anymore
George. It's different this
time. We have families here.

313
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:57,733
Then tell them to leave. Tell
them to get far from this place.

314
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:01,433
There's something wrong.

315
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:03,500
I know. I know. There's
something in the woods.

316
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,633
A very convenient excuse but a
very old and tired one.

317
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:13,633
I know you're up to something
out here George and when I find
out what it is,

318
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:17,733
I'm gonna take great pleasure
in taking you down.

319
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:25,833
(Slam) (Engine starting)

320
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:37,967
(Rock music)

321
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:42,067
(Chatter)

322
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:46,067
Dude! (Laughter)

323
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:50,067
(Rock music)

324
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:54,067
Ride the train.

325
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:58,133
(Rock music)

326
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:02,167
What's up bro-ski?

327
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:06,333
(Rock music) (Chatter)

328
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,467
(Rock music) (Cheering)

329
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:18,467
No. So, um,

330
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:20,400
What do you think you're going
to end up going to school as?

331
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,567
Chicken vagina is awesome.

332
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:26,500
(Laughter)

333
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,533
Hey, you know what would be
really great? What's that?

334
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:34,567
You're high man. A little.
Chickens man. Chicken vaginas.

335
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:40,667
Oh, good girl gone bad. Like
it. I know one of the boys over
there.

336
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:46,700
You wanna join the circle. I
was thinking more just us.

337
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,700
We can definitely. I can
definitely make that happen.

338
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,800
Sit right here and I will be
right back. (Chatter)

339
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:00,967
(Distant music) I can't
believe it.

340
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:07,067
Yeah, it was just like last
week when all that happened.
Here man.

341
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:11,067
You need something to drool
in.

342
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:13,067
Go fucking talk to her. I
can't talk to her.

343
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:16,100
If you don't fucking hit it, I
will.

344
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,467
Stop being a fucking pussy and
go get some pussy.

345
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:22,933
Get your fucking ass over there
man.

346
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:31,067
Alright, we got a fucking
challenger. Let's get this game
started man.

347
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:35,100
I mean, did you say Charlie
was

348
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,200
inside? Do you like beer pong?

349
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:48,200
Excuse me ladies. Can I borrow
my compadre over here.

350
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Dude, what the fuck? I was
about to get laid.

351
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,167
Where's the weed at? I don't
have any.

352
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:56,200
What do you mean, you don't
fucking have any? I dropped it
at that old dude's barn.

353
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,300
Well, go get that shit. I mean
it.

354
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,233
Now? Yeah, right now. I'm
going to get my knob gobbed on.

355
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:07,367
Go fucking get the weed. Bring
it back.

356
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:11,367
(Chatter)

357
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,333
If you want Lana and yourself
to have a place to stay,

358
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,233
then you're going to have to
let me take care of

359
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:17,267
what I have to take care
sometimes without harping at me
all the time.

360
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,300
Oh god. Harping?

361
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,333
Yes, harping. If you want you
and Lana to have a place to
stay, then I have business

362
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,467
that I have to take care of.
Like what?

363
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:28,467
What is more important than
what's going on here right now?

364
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:31,433
Oh my God, calm down. You know
that's not what I meant.

365
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:33,567
Do not fucking tell me to calm
down.

366
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:35,700
I'll tell you to calm down when
you need to calm down.

367
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,567
All I want is for you to
understand the situation. Try
to just get it a little bit.

368
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:41,667
I do understand the situation.
I'm part of it.

369
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:44,633
I think I get it pretty fucking
good. I let you guys move into
my place.

370
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:48,267
You did not let us move in. You
asked us to move in.

371
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:51,667
Yes, I asked you to move in,
doing a favor for you.

372
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,700
Because I felt bad for what
was going on.

373
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,767
Oh, because you told me it was
because you loved me.

374
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:59,700
I do love you, but that is not
remotely the point. So, what's
the point?

375
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,733
The point is that this is hard
on both of us, but it's harder
on me. You guys are
interrupting my life.

376
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:07,700
We're interrupting your life?
Yes. Are you fucking kidding me?

377
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,833
No, I'm not kidding you.
Please enlighten me.

378
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,767
Every time I come home, you
guys are here. I can't get away
from you.

379
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:16,867
I'm either at work or at home
dealing with you.

380
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:19,933
You're dealing with us? Yes,
dealing with you on a daily
basis.

381
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:24,067
Really? Yes. Maybe you should
be dealing with the clothes you
leave everywhere.

382
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:28,067
The clothes? Or the fucking
dishes you never wash. It's my
own business. It's my place.

383
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:32,067
It is our place now. It's your
place because you a re living
here but it's my

384
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:36,067
place because I own it. It's
our place because you asked us
to move in.

385
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:40,200
(Intense music)

386
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:48,100
(Ominous music) (Shatter)

387
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,133
Oh my god, Lana.

388
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:56,333
Are you OK? Lana.

389
00:35:56,333 --> 00:36:00,333
Lana.

390
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:08,467
(Slam)

391
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:12,367
Lana, Lana.

392
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:16,367
Come out. Lana. What's going
on?

393
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:20,400
We can't fight in front of
her.

394
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,500
Lana, come out. I'm sorry.

395
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,633
We'll work through this like
we always do.

396
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:36,733
Alright, well, if you feel like
talking, we'll be out here.

397
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:40,700

398

405
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:41,233
Fuck this place is as creepy
as shit.

(Intense music) Where you
going?

413
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,167
Crystal? What are you doing
here?

414
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:22,200
What's it matter? Do I need a
reason to see you?

415
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:30,067
I didn't think you were
interested. Just relax.

416
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:34,200
I'll take care of you.

417
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,267

00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,900
It won't be my last.

(Tapping) Frank, Dustin still
isn't home. Yeah.

430
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:43,400
So? So? Our son is missing.

431
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,600
Honey, do you see how busy I
am?

Lana? Hey, you OK? What
happened?

454
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:57,467
We just have to go OK? Lana
wait.

Lana!

459
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Lana!

460
00:45:45,967 --> 00:45:49,933
He didn't say where he was
going. He has

461
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:51,967
not called. We haven't heard
anything. It's alright Mrs.
Murphy.

462
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:55,133
You have every reason to be
concerned. We've been so
worried.

463
00:45:55,133 --> 00:45:58,767
This isn't like him. I
understand.

464
00:45:58,767 --> 00:46:02,200
When was the last time you saw
him? I don't know why he does
things like this?

465
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,267
I mean my other son doesn't.
He never really wants to talk
to me anyway.

466
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:10,233
You alright? I'm fine.

467
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:14,500
I'm trying to make the
responsible and do what they're
supposed to do.

468
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,433
(Ominous music)

469

(Ominous music)

470
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:30,600
Sleep it off.

471
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,533
Excuse me? Your son.

472
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:38,633
He's probably just sleeping it
off with his buddies.

473
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,633
What do you mean?

474
00:46:40,633 --> 00:46:46,633
What I mean is your son is a
pot head and a pain in my ass.

475
00:46:46,633 --> 00:46:50,800
Look, I'm sorry. I'm gonna
talk to Dustin's

476
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,767
friends, see what I can find
out, and I'll do everything in
my power

477
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:58,833
to get your son back to you.
You have my word.

478
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:19,100
What the hell was that? You
scared that woman half

479
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:23,067
to death. Dammit, Rick, you
have got

480
00:47:23,067 --> 00:47:27,067
to talk to me.

481
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:31,100
Whoa!

482
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,167
What the? What are you doing?

483
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,100
Jeez, Rick, what are you doing
man?

484
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,167
Rick, hey!

485
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:47,267
Rick! Rick! Hey!

486
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:49,267
What? Listen here you son of a
bitch.

487
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:52,233
I can put a hole through your
chest. You'll be dead before
you hit the fucking ground.

488
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:59,367
So, I'd think about that the
next time you consider touching
me. Rick.

489
00:47:59,367 --> 00:48:03,367
Tell me what is going on.
Where are you going?

490
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:07,433
Stand down private. This is my
mission.

491
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:35,700
Lana!

492
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:16,067

Whoa, what the fuck?

499
00:49:56,567 --> 00:50:00,633
What the fuck are you doing
here?

What are you doing? Foster? We
got to get cover.

511
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Come on. Get down. My god,
Foster. I watched you die man.

512
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,467
Do I look fucking dead to you?
What the hell is this?

513
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:29,467
Don't fucking get section 8 on
me now. (Gunshots) Get the fuck
down.

514
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:37,533
Foster. Foster!

515
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:41,633
Shit.

516
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:45,567

00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,767
Man, I'm sorry. I should have
never left you here.

519
00:52:07,767 --> 00:52:10,867
Fucking son of a bitch got me.
I should have been here for you.

520
00:52:10,867 --> 00:52:13,867
Rick, I'm fucking dying man.

521
00:52:13,867 --> 00:52:17,900
No, you hold on. You hear me?

522
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,933
Rick, you get that mother
fucker. You hear me? You get
that mother fucker Rick!

523
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:25,933
Yes, I'll get him. That son of
a bitch fucking killed me. Calm
down. I'll get him.

524
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:30,067
It'll be alright.

525
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:34,067
Rick! Behind you!

526
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:38,200
(Intense music)

527
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:46,267
(Intense music)

528
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:02,467
(Ominous music)

529
00:53:02,467 --> 00:53:06,533
Kill him Rick.

530
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:10,567
Kill them all.

531
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:14,667
For the core.

532
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:18,600
For the core.

533
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:30,700
(Flapping)

534
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:34,733

535
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,767
(Whispering)

536
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,867
(Tapping)

537
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:58,867
Yeah, hi, Mr. Schultz,

538
00:53:58,867 --> 00:54:02,867
it's officer Debois down at
the sheriff's station. Yes,
yes, I'm fine.

539
00:54:02,867 --> 00:54:06,900
Thanks. Uh, listen, would it
be possible to talk to Scott?

540
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,067
We're trying to locate his
buddy, Dustin. His parents

541
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:15,067
haven't...oh, he didn't come
home either?

542
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:17,067
OK. OK.

543
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:23,267
Let me check with his other
friends and see what we can
come up with.

544
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:27,200
No, we'll do everything we
can, I swear.

545
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,267
Mr. Schultz? What's wrong?

546
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:35,200
(Bangs) What's going on over
there?

547
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,367
(Ominous music)

548
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:47,467
So, where are we going? Just
keep walking.

549
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:49,400
We're not going to go with you
if we don't know where we're
going.

550
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:55,567
You're with us, so you don't
sick mom on us. Too late for
that. She already called the
cops.

551
00:54:55,567 --> 00:54:59,533
What was that? Last night,
when he didn't come home. Oh
shit.

552
00:54:59,533 --> 00:55:01,600
That's not good. No shit
that's not fucking good.

553
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,633
Your whore of a mom called the
god damn cops on us. What did
you do?

554
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:11,633
Scott, we were partying and he
went to get some shit and he
didn't come back.

555
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:15,667
What do you mean he didn't
come back? He means he didn't
come back.

556
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:19,567
Now, we are going to go
fucking find him. We're going
back to the barn.

557
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:23,667
You just want the weed man.
Fuck you.

558
00:55:31,733 --> 00:55:35,700
(Dinging)

559
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,700
(Slam)

560
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,767
(Ominous music)

561
00:56:03,867 --> 00:56:07,967
Dispatch, come in.

562
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:11,967
Dispatch, we've had a shooting
at the

563
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:16,067
Schultz residence. Please come
in.

564
00:56:16,067 --> 00:56:19,900
Dispatch, I need troopers in
here ASAP.

565
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,900
Dispatch!

566
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,867
Dammit!

567
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:35,933
(Ominous music)

568
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:43,967

571
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:08,367
(Nature sounds)

572
00:57:08,367 --> 00:57:12,267
So, this is where we're going?
Can't get anything passed you.

573
00:57:12,267 --> 00:57:16,400
Are you sure man? What if
something happens to Scott when
he went down?

574
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,567
What if that old bastard
killed him?

575
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:22,533
And you'd know? Jesus, will
you two shut the fuck up,
alright?

576
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:28,567
We need to go find Scott before
Thompson does.

577
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:32,667
Huh, look at this ugly mother
fucker.

578
00:57:32,667 --> 00:57:36,733
Right.

579
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:40,833
(Ominous music)

580
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:44,700
What in the world? I don't
know.

581
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:52,767
Guys. What is it? Look at
this.

582
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:56,733
Yeah, wonder boy, it's a god
damn scarecrow. Now, let's
fucking go.

583
00:58:00,867 --> 00:58:04,800
I don't know man. Something
feels awful about this. My god,

584
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,867
will you two jerk offs, can we
please fucking go? Jesus.

585
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:12,900
(Ominous music)

586
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,867
(Scream) Dude,

587
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:24,900
(Ominous music)

588
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:33,067
Lana! Dude, we got to fucking
go. We can't leave

589
00:58:33,067 --> 00:58:37,067
her. We got to fucking go. You
can fucking stay here. I'm
getting the fuck out.

590
00:58:37,067 --> 00:58:41,267
(Ominous music)

591
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:49,367
(Ominous music)

592
00:58:53,467 --> 00:58:57,467
(Ominous music)

593
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:05,533
Dustin!

594
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,533
(Knocking)

595
00:59:13,533 --> 00:59:17,633
Please! Please, you have to
let me in! Lana.

596
00:59:17,633 --> 00:59:21,533
What's wrong?

597
00:59:21,533 --> 00:59:25,633
It's OK. Nothing is gonna hurt
you. Trust me.

598
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:29,667
Come inside.

599
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:33,667
(Nature sounds)

600
00:59:37,733 --> 00:59:41,733
(Tapping)

601
00:59:43,867 --> 00:59:46,900
Here. Someone your age should
eat.

602
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,400
Besides, no one can pass up my
stew.

603
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,067
Thanks.

604
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:58,067
Poor girl.

605
00:59:58,067 --> 01:00:01,900
(Soft music) It's alright.
You're safe now.

606
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,900
Tell me what happened.

607
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,867
I can't.

608
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:13,867
Lana, I can't help you unless
you tell me what's going on.

609
01:00:17,967 --> 01:00:22,033
You know, I'm reminded

610
01:00:22,033 --> 01:00:26,067
of my wife. Why is that?

611
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:28,000
Long ago, shortly after we got
married,

612
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,967
we decided to move out here in
the country and we had, in our
early years,

613
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:38,167
an adventurous life you could
say. Decided to settle down

614
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:42,167
and before we knew it, we were
expecting a little one

615
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:44,100
of our own. I bet you were
excited.

616
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:50,267
Yes, we both were.

617
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:54,833
At least for a while. What
happened?

618
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:58,800
We lost the baby a few months
in.

619
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,767
I'm so sorry. Things happen.

620
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:06,733
But the point is,

621
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:10,900
Carol was devastated, but she
held it in.

622
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,900
She wouldn't talk about it.

623
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,967
She couldn't face the pain.

624
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:23,067
When you hold something like
that in,

625
01:01:23,067 --> 01:01:26,867
it only grows until it
destroys you from within.

626
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:34,967
Fear of facing your own pain is
the worst fear of all.

627
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:43,067
Lana, what are you afraid of?

628
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:47,200
(Clicking)

629
01:01:51,067 --> 01:01:55,067
(Rattling)

630
01:01:55,067 --> 01:01:59,067
Lana!

631
01:01:59,067 --> 01:02:03,167
(Rattling)

632
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:07,100
It's not real. this is not
happening.

633
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,100
It's not real!

634
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:15,133
(Clicking)

635
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:19,133
(Intense music)

636
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:21,200
Where's George?

637
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:27,300
I asked you a question young
lady.

638
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,300
You can run, but you can't
hide.

639
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,500
(Soft music )

640
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:59,533

(Gunshot)

645
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:40,200
Wasn't very smart George. Go
that way. Why?

646
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,367
He'll follow me. Go. (Click)

647
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:48,200
(Gunshot)

648
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,433

(Intense music)

652
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:20,667
I told you I'd find you,
didn't I? Why run?

653
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:24,700
(Intense music)

654
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:28,667
(Radio static)

655
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:32,767
You're going to pay for what
you did to Foster.

668
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:13,533
Dustin. No Jacob.

669
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:17,500
I mean. (Beeping)

670
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,533
(Beeping)

671
01:06:21,533 --> 01:06:23,500
Busy?

672
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,633
How can it be busy? How can 911
be busy?

673
01:06:26,633 --> 01:06:29,600
That's not the way it is.

674
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,567
Oh god.

675
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:41,600
Everything where it should be.

676
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:49,700
For when they get home.

677
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,767
OK, everything

678
01:06:53,767 --> 01:06:57,700
will be fine. (Tapping)

679
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:05,733

(Tapping) Still nothing.
Frank.

682
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:25,867
Frank, are you listening to
me? Not now. I'm busy. Not now?

683
01:07:25,867 --> 01:07:29,833
Frank, our boys are missing.
God dammit, Karen, I'm

684
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:33,933
fucking working. Now get out
and leave me alone!

685
01:07:33,933 --> 01:07:37,900

Jake! Jake!

688
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:58,300
Jake! Jake! Oh god Jake, no.

689
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,200
No. Frank! Frank! There's
something wrong with Jake.

690
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,300
Oh Jake. (Crying)

691
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,267
Frank! Karen, what the fuck do
you want?

692
01:08:10,267 --> 01:08:14,333
Jake, he won't wake up.

693
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,400
We need to call an ambulance.

694
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,533
What the hell are you talking
about?

695
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:22,567
What?

696
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,567
He was right here. I saw him.

697
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:31,733
Karen, I'm sick and tired of
your bullshit.

698
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,733
He was right here. I saw him.

699
01:08:34,733 --> 01:08:38,700
He was right here. Shut up!

700
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,800
I'm sick and fucking tired of
you and the kids interrupting me

701
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,700
every time I got work to do.

702
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,667
You know what will happen if I
don't get this report done?

703
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:50,667
Do you? Huh? We're gonna lose
the house. Gone.

704
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:54,867
The car. Gone. We'll lose
everything.

705
01:08:54,867 --> 01:08:58,733
Frank, please, just listen.
No.

706
01:08:58,733 --> 01:09:02,800
You listen. You should be
thankful for all the shit

707
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,800
I do around here, but no, it's
always Frank, come to dinner.

708
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,867
Frank, where are the children.
Frank, spend more time with me.

709
01:09:10,867 --> 01:09:14,967
Never fucking ends. Please.

710
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:18,967
Don't do this. Don't do what?

711
01:09:18,967 --> 01:09:22,867
Shut you up once and for all?

712
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:27,067
Huh? So, I can get some peace
and quiet around here.

713
01:09:27,067 --> 01:09:30,967
Finally get some work done.

714
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:34,933
Maybe I should. Maybe I should
just squeeze you until you pop.

715
01:09:37,067 --> 01:09:43,233
That'd be fucking great. (Stab)

716
01:09:47,133 --> 01:09:51,267
(Ominous music) (Choking)

717
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:59,167
Karen.

718
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:03,333
(Ominous music)

719
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:07,233
Oh god.

720
01:10:07,233 --> 01:10:11,433
Oh no. No, no, no.

721
01:10:11,433 --> 01:10:15,367
Frank.

722
01:10:15,367 --> 01:10:19,500
You shouldn't worry so much
mom.

723
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,500
No! No! No!

724
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:27,467
(Stabbing)

725
01:10:35,567 --> 01:10:39,533
(Ominous music)

726
01:10:43,633 --> 01:10:47,567
(Ominous music) Dad!

727
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:55,667
(Ominous music)

728
01:11:03,733 --> 01:11:07,733
(Ominous music)

729
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,767
(Strange noises)

730
01:11:19,867 --> 01:11:23,900
(Hissing)

731
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:27,867
(Ominous music)

732
01:11:31,933 --> 01:11:35,933
(Ominous music)

733
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:43,967
(Ominous music)

734
01:11:48,067 --> 01:11:52,067
(Ominous music)

735
01:11:52,067 --> 01:11:56,067
(Coughing)

736
01:11:56,067 --> 01:12:00,267
Mom. No.

737
01:12:00,267 --> 01:12:04,267
It's OK, mom. It's OK. You'll
be OK.

738
01:12:04,267 --> 01:12:08,267
You'll be fine. I promise.
What happened?

739
01:12:08,267 --> 01:12:12,300
Why did you do it? What? Why

740
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:16,300
I don't understand. Mom, come
on. No.

741
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:20,433
Mom, no. Come on. Wake up mom.

742
01:12:20,433 --> 01:12:24,300
Mom.

743
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,433
(Soft music) (Crying)

744
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:36,467
(Ominous music)

745
01:12:36,467 --> 01:12:40,433
(Sirens)

746
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:52,467
You hurt?

747
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:20,667
(Nature sounds)

748
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:24,667
(Soft music)

749
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:32,700
(Soft music)

750
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:40,767
(Soft music)

751
01:13:40,767 --> 01:13:44,800
(Dripping)

752
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,767
(Dripping)

753
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,767
Thank you.

754
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:04,767
Thompson had this file out.

755
01:14:04,767 --> 01:14:08,867
It's all about you.
Interesting read, I'd imagine.

756
01:14:08,867 --> 01:14:10,967
To be honest with you George,
I'm not sure what I read.

757
01:14:10,967 --> 01:14:17,067
That doesn't surprise me. God
dammit George, I just walked
away from a bloodbath.

758
01:14:17,067 --> 01:14:21,067
I need some answers. I don't
know what this is.

759
01:14:21,067 --> 01:14:23,133
I don't know where it came
from.

760
01:14:23,133 --> 01:14:29,233
What I do know, is whatever it
is,

761
01:14:29,233 --> 01:14:33,200
every tormented thought, every
fear, somehow,

762
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,233
is made real around here.

763
01:14:35,233 --> 01:14:38,233
What the hell does that even
mean?

764
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:45,433
It means there's something
wrong in those woods. So,
that's your explanation?

765
01:14:45,433 --> 01:14:49,400
People vanishing without a
trace, running out of

766
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:53,500
those woods completely mad.

767
01:14:57,533 --> 01:15:01,633
I have lived with this every
day for the last thirty years.

768
01:15:01,633 --> 01:15:05,467
I've seen good people.

769
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:09,500
Good people taken by this
place.

770
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,533
George, I got a question for
you.

771
01:15:13,533 --> 01:15:17,667
What exactly happened to your
wife?

772
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:21,633
(Soft music)

773
01:15:27,767 --> 01:15:30,800
After we lost the baby,

774
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,300
she started talking about
seeing some kind of shadows in
the corner of eyes.

775
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,967
I thought it was the grief
talking.

776
01:15:37,967 --> 01:15:41,900
But then other things started
to happen.

777
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,900
Missing persons.

778
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:49,867
People babbling about strange
creatures running around out
there in the dark.

779
01:15:49,867 --> 01:15:51,900
Terrible deaths.

780
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:57,933
I didn't think Carol had
anything to do with it, but she
was convinced

781
01:15:57,933 --> 01:15:59,900
it was all her fault.

782
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:06,067
She said that something had
latched onto her and was feeding

783
01:16:06,067 --> 01:16:09,967
off of her pain and fear.

784
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:18,067
Whether it was the guilt or
something else, I don't know,
but it

785
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:20,133
ate at her.

786
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:26,267
Ate at her until one day,

787
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:34,167
she ran out into those woods
and hung herself from the old
oak tree.

788
01:16:34,167 --> 01:16:38,333
(Ominous music)

789
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:44,300
And what about Thompson?

790
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,367
He was just a deputy at the
time.

791
01:16:47,367 --> 01:16:50,800
I took him out to the woods and
she was gone.

792
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:58,433
Carol's body had disappeared.
He didn't believe me.

793
01:16:58,433 --> 01:17:02,400
He was sure I had something to
do with it.

794
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,400
And he wouldn't let go of
that.

795
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:10,500
I don't even know what to make

796
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,600
of all this. You don't have to
make anything of it.

797
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:18,667
Just know that what I am saying
is the truth. Alright, but why
now?

798
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,567
Why after thirty years?

799
01:17:20,567 --> 01:17:26,700
After she died, out there,
whatever it is, lost its

800
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,700
potency. Its power.

801
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:34,733
So, it's been sitting out
there, all that time, waiting
for something.

802
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:38,733
Something to feed upon.

803
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:42,733
It needs fear.

804
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:50,800
The deeper the fear, the
stronger it gets.

805
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,767
(Soft music)

806
01:17:54,767 --> 01:17:58,867
You OK?

807
01:17:58,867 --> 01:18:02,833
Makes two of us.

808
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,900
(Soft music)

809
01:18:18,967 --> 01:18:22,967
We're leaving.

810
01:18:22,967 --> 01:18:27,133
Where?

811
01:18:27,133 --> 01:18:30,933
Into the city. It's about a
twenty minute drive.

812
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:47,267
What's wrong?

813
01:18:47,267 --> 01:18:51,267
Our supply shed is up the
road. We got flares, med kits,

814
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:55,233
things like that. Maybe we
should stop there first.

815
01:18:55,233 --> 01:18:59,200
You really think we need all
that?

816
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:03,233
You'd rather be without?

817
01:19:03,233 --> 01:19:07,367
It's your call. (Engine start)

818
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:11,200
(Dinging)

819
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,367
(Nature sounds)

820
01:19:23,367 --> 01:19:27,533
No, no. Just hang tight right
here.

821
01:19:27,533 --> 01:19:31,500
I'll be right back.

822
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:35,467
(Slam)

823
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:43,533
(Nature sounds)

824
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:59,600
(Intense music)

825
01:20:01,733 --> 01:20:04,667
I told you this day was coming.

826
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:07,667
I told you I was gonna take you
down. It's not you doing it.

827
01:20:07,667 --> 01:20:11,700
Rick!

828
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,567
Back off.

829
01:20:15,567 --> 01:20:19,667
(Crying) If you're going to
shoot

830
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:23,800
then shoot. Don't test me. You
ain't got the balls.

831
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,700
Jake, be careful. (Engine
start)

832
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:31,700
(Sirens)

833
01:20:35,867 --> 01:20:39,733
Jake, are you OK? Yes, I'm
fine.

834
01:20:43,767 --> 01:20:47,867
(Slam)

835
01:20:47,867 --> 01:20:51,833
Everybody's OK? Good job kid.

836
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:55,833
(Ominous music)

837
01:20:55,833 --> 01:21:00,067
Look!

838
01:21:00,067 --> 01:21:03,867
Let's get out of here.

839
01:21:07,933 --> 01:21:11,900
(Nature sounds)

840
01:21:16,067 --> 01:21:19,967
(Nature sounds)

841
01:21:24,067 --> 01:21:28,167
(Nature sounds)

842
01:21:28,167 --> 01:21:32,300
Did anyone else just see that?

843
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:40,267
Hello.

844
01:21:40,267 --> 01:21:44,267
Could be somebody signaling

845
01:21:44,267 --> 01:21:48,433
for help. Let's check it out.

846
01:21:48,433 --> 01:21:52,367
(Growling)

847
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:00,433
What is it? Not sure.

848
01:22:00,433 --> 01:22:04,433
Let's go. We don't want to
deal with it.

849
01:22:20,533 --> 01:22:24,533
It's a camera.

850
01:22:24,533 --> 01:22:28,500
That's my camera.

851
01:22:32,567 --> 01:22:36,500
(Ominous music)

852
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:44,567
(Ominous music) (Growling)

853
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:56,700
(Ominous music)

854
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,700
(Rustling)

855
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:04,700
George.

856
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:08,700
Jake.

857
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:12,700
Lana.

858
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:24,733
(Ominous music)

859
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:32,800
(Ominous music)

860
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:40,900
You did this to me! You!

861
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:44,933
You could have saved me!

862
01:23:44,933 --> 01:23:48,933
(Ominous music)

863
01:23:48,933 --> 01:23:52,900
You die!

864
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:57,067
Listen, whatever it is you
thought you saw, it's not

865
01:23:57,067 --> 01:24:01,067
real. Snap out of it.

866
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:05,167
We need to get out of here.

867
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:07,133
Wait, wait, wait. What about
the kids?

868
01:24:07,133 --> 01:24:13,200
We have to assume they made it
back to my place. We'll go look
there. Alright.

869
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:17,133
You OK? I'm OK. What about
you?

870
01:24:17,133 --> 01:24:21,300
I'm fine.

871
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,533
Jake!

872
01:25:01,533 --> 01:25:05,533
George!

873
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:09,500
Jake!

874
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:17,500
Jake!

875
01:25:21,467 --> 01:25:25,533
Jake isn't here right now
Lana.

876
01:25:25,533 --> 01:25:29,633
You don't need him. Not when
you have me.

877
01:25:33,733 --> 01:25:37,767
(Ominous music)

878
01:25:37,767 --> 01:25:41,733
Lana! God dammit,

879
01:25:41,733 --> 01:25:45,800
Karen, I'm fucking working.
Now get out! Dad?

880
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,767
I'm sick and fucking tired of
you and the kids interrupting

881
01:25:49,767 --> 01:25:53,733
me every time I got work to
do. Dad, where are you?

882
01:25:53,733 --> 01:25:57,833
Not do what? Shut you up once
and for all?

883
01:25:57,833 --> 01:26:01,833
Dad?

884
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:05,900
Mom?

885
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:09,933
Don't do this! (Woman crying)

886
01:26:09,933 --> 01:26:14,067
Oh no, no. Mom, I'm sorry.

887
01:26:14,067 --> 01:26:18,067
I was too late mom. I was too
late.

888
01:26:18,067 --> 01:26:22,067
Little baby cry. You're
pathetic.

889
01:26:22,067 --> 01:26:26,067
What are you doing here?

890
01:26:26,067 --> 01:26:30,167
I don't understand. What don't
you understand sweetie? I'm
here for you.

891
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:32,167
You don't have to worry any
longer.

892
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:38,133
Why are you afraid of me? Just
go away!

893
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:42,300
Really? Go away?

894
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:46,200
How dare you talk to me like
that you good for nothing shit.

895
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:50,300
Do not speak to me like that!

896
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:54,267
What am I gonna do with you
huh? I gave you everything

897
01:26:54,267 --> 01:26:58,333
Sorry. And now you want me to
go away.

898
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:02,333
You little shit. You're just
like your mother.

899
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:06,467
And like her, I'm gonna leave
you here.

900
01:27:06,467 --> 01:27:10,467
To rot alone.

901
01:27:14,533 --> 01:27:16,500
No!

902
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:22,633
You no friends, no family, and
it's all your fault.

903
01:27:22,633 --> 01:27:26,533
It's pathetic. No!

904
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:30,700
Your whole family is dead. You
have no one.

905
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:34,533
Not even Lana. Jake!

906
01:27:34,533 --> 01:27:36,533
Jake! She's gonna die out here
you know.

907
01:27:36,533 --> 01:27:38,600
We're just gonna feed off of
her.

908
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:42,667
Until the only option she has
is to end it all.

909
01:27:42,667 --> 01:27:46,667
And there is nothing you can
do because honestly, it's all
your

910
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:48,567
fault. No.

911
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:54,667
Lana is gonna die because of
you. No!

912
01:27:58,733 --> 01:28:02,767
(Soft music)

913
01:28:02,767 --> 01:28:06,733
Hey, Lana. It's Jake.

914
01:28:06,733 --> 01:28:10,900
Look, whatever you're seeing,
it's not real, OK? We got to go.

915
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,867
Come on. I'm not leaving you.
Come on.

916
01:28:14,867 --> 01:28:18,867
Come on.

917
01:28:23,067 --> 01:28:27,200
(Ominous music)

918
01:28:31,067 --> 01:28:35,067
(Ominous music)

919
01:28:35,067 --> 01:28:39,067
I thought you said it wasn't
real. It's not, but we can't
control

920
01:28:39,067 --> 01:28:42,233
everything.

921
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:47,200
OK, my house is that way. I
need you to go there and find
the kids and get them far away
from here.

922
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:51,400
What about you? Thompson, in
his own way, may have been
right all these years.

923
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:55,333
I have not been getting rid of
it. I've only been keeping it
in.

924
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:57,333
You can't blame yourself for
this.

925
01:28:57,333 --> 01:29:00,400
Ever since it did Carol in,
it's been trying to do me in
and by not letting it do that,

926
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,967
I've only been giving it just
enough fear to hang on. You
can't think that way.

927
01:29:03,967 --> 01:29:11,467
We can still beat this. It is
not too late. I'm gonna go end
it right now.

928
01:29:11,467 --> 01:29:15,500
That is not an option George.
What it did to Carol, I'm not
going to let it do it to that
girl.

929
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,600
I won't! We can think of
another way.

930
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:23,633
I hate to break up this tender
moment. Don't even think about
it.

931
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:31,700
(Grunting)

932
01:29:35,733 --> 01:29:39,700
George! No!

933
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,833
I've killed more people than
you can imagine.

934
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:47,933
This isn't any different, but
you know, I expected a little
more out of you.

935
01:29:47,933 --> 01:29:51,900
But you got no guts.

936
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,933
You should have shot me when
you had the chance. Now look at
you.

937
01:29:53,933 --> 01:30:00,067
You can't even fight off an old
man. You are a disgrace to the
marine core.

938
01:30:00,067 --> 01:30:04,000
I am not a marine!

939
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,967
(Click)

940
01:30:12,167 --> 01:30:16,033
You can't do it. You're
nothing but... (Gunshot)

941
01:30:16,033 --> 01:30:20,033
(Gunshot)

942
01:30:20,033 --> 01:30:24,233
(Cough)

943
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:40,367
(Ominous music)

944
01:30:44,467 --> 01:30:48,467
(Ominous music)

945
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:56,533
(Ominous music)

946
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:04,567
(Ominous music)

947
01:31:04,567 --> 01:31:08,567
Lana go!

948
01:31:08,567 --> 01:31:12,600
Go!

949
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:20,700
(Ominous music)

950
01:31:28,867 --> 01:31:32,867
(Ominous music)

951
01:31:36,967 --> 01:31:40,933
(Ominous music)

952
01:31:52,967 --> 01:31:57,100
I know

953
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:00,967
it's not you, but we will be
together

954
01:32:00,967 --> 01:32:05,067
soon.

955
01:32:05,067 --> 01:32:09,200
(Ominous music)

956
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:17,267
(Ominous music)

957
01:32:21,133 --> 01:32:25,267
(Ominous music)

958
01:32:29,133 --> 01:32:33,300
(Ominous music)

959
01:32:37,167 --> 01:32:41,367
(Ominous music)

960
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,333
Lana!

961
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:53,433
Hey, hey, it's Jake. Lana,
it's Jake.

962
01:32:53,433 --> 01:32:57,433
It's OK.

963
01:32:57,433 --> 01:33:01,433
(Crying)

964
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:09,533
Lana, we got to go, OK?

965
01:33:09,533 --> 01:33:13,567
(Ominous music)

966
01:33:13,567 --> 01:33:17,433
Let's go! Come on!

967
01:33:17,433 --> 01:33:21,467
Lana, come on. Let's go. Come
on.

968
01:33:21,467 --> 01:33:25,667
I can't! You have to Lana. You
have to.

969
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:29,600
You have to face your fear.

970
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,633
It's OK.

971
01:33:33,633 --> 01:33:37,567
Take this.

972
01:33:37,567 --> 01:33:41,633
Everyone has got to face their
fears sometime.

973
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:53,933
I can't do this anymore.

974
01:33:53,933 --> 01:33:57,833
What the fuck is that supposed
to mean?

975
01:33:57,833 --> 01:34:01,967
It means I want you to leave.
Leave? This is my fucking house.

976
01:34:01,967 --> 01:34:05,967
And I'm not going anywhere. I
love you,

977
01:34:05,967 --> 01:34:10,067
but I can't live here the way
you are.

978
01:34:10,067 --> 01:34:13,967
I understand, but I won't have
this for Lana.

979
01:34:13,967 --> 01:34:17,933
You calling me a bad father?
No, I'm not saying that. How
dare you talk to me like that!

980
01:34:17,933 --> 01:34:21,900
Fucking cunt! (Thud)

981
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:25,933
(Thud)

982
01:34:25,933 --> 01:34:29,933
Don't! (Thudding)

983
01:34:29,933 --> 01:34:33,900

984
01:35:14,467 --> 01:35:18,433
