1
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,552
A little more throttle
when you want to bank left like that.

2
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,677
- You're a natural.
- I practice on a computer.

3
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,634
- I can point down a little bit?
- Yeah, okay.

4
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,749
Good job.

5
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,669
Easy.

6
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,831
You're going too fast and too low!

7
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,836
We go back to airport now.
So exciting. My heart is beating fast.

8
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,589
Excuse me!

9
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,794
- Sorry, I didn't get your last name.
- Bob from Nepal.

10
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,119
To be truthful, Mr. Davis, I'm still not
sure exactly what you're trying to report.

11
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,915
To tell you the truth, I'm not exactly
sure myself. It was just weird.

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,276
The guy didn't really want to
learn how to fly as much as he wanted...

13
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,794
- <i>to learn how to aim the plane. </i>
- You got his name?

14
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,828
Barbir Alkazar. A-L-K-A-Z-A-R.

15
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,950
Are you going to be there
for a while, Mr. Davis?

16
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,838
- Maybe we'll take a drive out.
- <i>Yeah, you bet, I'll be here. </i>

17
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,634
I study art.

18
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,599
- Really?
- Yes.

19
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,158
- You're an artist, too, yes?
- Yes.

20
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,189
What medium?

21
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,036
Mortician. Body prep, that sort of thing.

22
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,188
Makeup, sculpt out the cheeks,
little cotton up there.

23
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,996
Catch it just right,
they almost come back to life.

24
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,992
Yes, I can imagine this.

25
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,239
It was nice meeting you.

26
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,034
Never fails. Damn it!

27
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,879
Tonight, real fast
hello-goodbye-type deal.

28
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,599
The base killed two guys last night.
Both had kids in my madrassa.

29
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,318
- What was that about?
- Osama paranoia.

30
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,436
Brothers going all crazy right now.

31
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,910
- Plan biggest operation ever.
- What kind of operation?

32
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,512
Same time targets, Tanzania, Sudan.

33
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,877
Only this time, big American cities.

34
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,435
Where and when?

35
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,072
I find out more, but then Hamburg no
good for me. I need Green Card, Brand.

36
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,356
Achmed, you just got
a very thick envelope.

37
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,509
Two weeks, here.

38
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,519
I give you dates, places, maybe even
names of brothers already in US.

39
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,111
If you don't be here, I go back Tunis.

40
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,670
Forget hajj to land of Kentucky-Fried
forever, and you, Brand...

41
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,234
maybe you never sleep
good again, ever.

42
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,789
'Cause this time...

43
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,238
your country bleeds.

44
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,590
He doesn't work, he doesn't go
to school, he doesn't have visitors.

45
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,671
He has no visible means of support.

46
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,350
He plays with Flight Simulator
all day long.

47
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,192
I thought you were here
to get a warrant.

48
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,918
Okay, so we watched him a little bit.

49
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,513
But we also talked to a phone-guy...

50
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,955
who installed a DSL line
in his apartment.

51
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,636
No TV, no stereo, no furniture,
just professional flight charts...

52
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,593
Arabic newspapers
and a computer with a joystick.

53
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,075
I want to see what's on this guy's
hard drive, Oscar.

54
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,232
Because of some goof-ball flight lesson
and computer games?

55
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,719
Not due cause, gentlemen.

56
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,440
I won't embarrass myself
in front of a Federal judge.

57
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,189
Go do other things.

58
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,031
I'm e-mailing headquarters in DC, Hank.

59
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,997
- You're kidding.
- Screw the consequences!

60
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,640
I've got a really bad vibe
on this thing, I really do.

61
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,635
It's Farsi.

62
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,477
"Praise the brave young brothers...

63
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,109
"and may God put courage in their
hearts the day of their longest journey. "

64
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,156
The speed, the inflections, the slang...

65
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,231
they got their adrenaline
going over something.

66
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,550
But what? It's all a-specific.

67
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,393
Shards of scripture, old poetry,
parabolic gibberish...

68
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,835
Maybe not. Our group thinks
we're seeing a theme.

69
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,070
Numbers being repeated, 9s and 11s...

70
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,354
Laurie, turn that off.

71
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,159
The quotes from Quran,
always from Sura 9.

72
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,559
If not 9, they're from 11.

73
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,993
Sometimes it's out in the open:

74
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,548
Everybody's got 11 girlfriends,
9 siblings or...

75
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,872
- 9 cars, 11 goats.
- Okay, people. 9s and 11s.

76
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,717
A codebook correlative?
A time? A date?

77
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,074
September 11?

78
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,677
Or November 9, the month
comes after the day in the region.

79
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,671
Pete, memo both CIA and FBI.

80
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,274
You know what, send it out
to the whole alphabet soup.

81
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,352
'Cause if this is the date,
we might be just about on top of it.

82
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,631
Harrison, good job. Keep working it.

83
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,874
Come on, Achmed.

84
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,439
So it's about 50-50.
Rudy, Jack, Drew bet you are.

85
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,431
Frank, Billy Noble, and Wally
bet you're not.

86
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,955
- How much are people betting?
- $20 a piece.

87
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,551
- So where'd you put your money?
- Me? Didn't bet.

88
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,520
Don't ask, don't tell, strictly by the book.

89
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,437
You're not being recorded. You can talk.

90
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,469
I'm just curious.

91
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,153
I bet you're a dyke.

92
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,991
We can probably surveil your ass.

93
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,510
Find out for sure
so some money can change hands.

94
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,550
Not without a DOJ bust for violating
my civil rights, you couldn't.

95
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,389
Hell!

96
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,589
Do it!

97
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,798
I'll sue the bureau for $10 million,
settle for $5, retire rich.

98
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,270
How about I set it up, make it happen,
then you and I split the ticket.

99
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,677
- Why not? It's really a very cool idea...
- Shut the hell up!

100
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,114
He's on his way.

101
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,633
<i>Okay, they're coming out. </i>

102
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,308
I'll take the first leg,
you stay on the parallels.

103
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,915
<i>Affirmative. </i>

104
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,475
Peace, my brother.

105
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,118
Damn it! What the hell?

106
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,228
Stay where you are!

107
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,153
Don't move!

108
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,833
Fulbar, are you okay?

109
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,197
Peachy! ATF just screwed us!

110
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,838
Get in there. Take him! Move!

111
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,799
Move it!

112
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,075
FBI!

113
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,277
Get your hands up! Kneel down!

114
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,509
FBI!

115
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,032
Counter-Terrorism Task Force.

116
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,874
Do you have any idea how long we've
been waiting to follow the guy you shot?

117
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,076
- Who's in charge here?
- Command is up front.

118
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,829
- Damn it.
- I'm hit.

119
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,318
Sorry, pal, he's ours. The dead guy
might have been Al Qaeda.

120
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,719
I don't care if he's Alfalfa.

121
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,553
There's C-4 in that truck,
illegal weapons in that building.

122
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,915
- He's coming with us.
- Sir! Messina's been hit!

123
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,439
How bad you hurt, Messina?

124
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,950
- I'm good.
- It's all right, boss.

125
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,951
It went in his bicep,
came right out again.

126
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,228
Where's my prisoner?

127
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,917
- Did she take him?
- Agent Fulbar?

128
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,512
She wouldn't do a thing like that.
In fact, I'm concerned.

129
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,799
This bust is all illegal.
Trunk not proper cartage.

130
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,553
There's cameras down here!

131
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,108
Sorry. It must be that time of the month.

132
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,599
1998. Vintage Al Qaeda year!

133
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,195
Two perfectly timed
simultaneous explosions...

134
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,113
at our embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania.

135
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,710
258 killed, over 5,000 injured.

136
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,874
'99, the near-sinking of the USS Cole.

137
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,630
He's getting good.
Somebody want to get the lights?

138
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,874
So, what created the monster?

139
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,432
We know he's cranky.
He's got a bad back.

140
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,037
Uses a staff to walk.

141
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,757
Bad kidneys. He's on dialysis, but
what else? The psychological aspect?

142
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,754
His mum was one of 20 wives.

143
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,796
His dad stayed with all the others...

144
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,269
but he left Osama's mum
right after he was born.

145
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,554
Never looked back.

146
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,831
So, in a culture
where parentage means everything...

147
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,070
Osama's almost an orphan.

148
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,513
- He's got 'Daddy Issues'.
- I think a lot stems from that.

149
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,759
Raised almost secular, he embraces
radical fundamentalism as a teenager.

150
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,634
Rebellion against a father
who's westernized...

151
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,631
really just a filthy-rich playboy.

152
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,230
Love it. Why does he hate us so much?

153
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,359
We desecrate the Islamic Holy Land by
building bases near Mecca and Medina.

154
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,193
We've got female troops
walking around with uncovered hair.

155
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,396
Kind of like bringing
a stripper to church.

156
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,470
So, as this old warrior retires,
this is the world they leave you with.

157
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,237
Nice guys like this.
Other asymmetric threats...

158
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,110
not to mention bio, chemical and
nuclear weapons in all the wrong hands.

159
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,072
So, good luck in your careers...

160
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,988
and watch your asses.

161
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,909
Don't become a gold star
in the lobby down there.

162
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,389
Thank you.

163
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,113
Good luck.

164
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,832
To a long and wonderful service.

165
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,509
God.

166
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,829
Why does everybody make it
sound like a funeral?

167
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,159
There's some upsides to this.

168
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,629
You won't have to get up
at 6:30 every morning.

169
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,712
No. We're not co-workers anymore.

170
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,431
And this means...

171
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,834
I guess that's kind of up to you.

172
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,108
You have reached
the voice-mail box of Joe Johnson...

173
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,431
and in that Mr. Johnson no longer works
for his former employer...

174
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,318
your message will not be recorded
by any damn beeps.

175
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,233
Some spook. I can hear the barroom
in the background.

176
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,194
- Are you on a secure cell?
- <i>Just like you taught me. </i>

177
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,439
Happy retirement, teach.

178
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,197
Well, thanks.
So how are you doing over there?

179
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,554
<i>Not too bad. </i>

180
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,673
Margaret says hello.

181
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,269
Ditto.

182
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,879
So, you're retired now...

183
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,918
<i>you're in a bar with Margaret... </i>

184
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,915
<i>Bet my last buck</i>
<i>what you have in mind right now. </i>

185
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,589
Are you still in Hamburg?

186
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,149
Not for long.

187
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,717
Flying to Al Qaeda land tomorrow.
First Uzbek, then Afghan.

188
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,594
- The Massoud thing?
- <i>Yeah. </i>

189
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,038
Apparently some of the bad guys
got away. Two of them.

190
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,318
Full-blown American citizens.

191
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,314
<i>That's interesting. </i>

192
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,952
So, how are you going to get into
Afghanistan, white boy?

193
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,509
I don't know.

194
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,195
But I'm guessing
it's gonna be kind of a drag.

195
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,593
The glamour of it all.

196
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,914
You went over my head?

197
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,192
I had to, Oscar. I'd do it again.

198
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,552
- It didn't get you very far, did it?
- No, it didn't.

199
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,638
Request a transfer out of here.

200
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,830
It wasn't personal! Oscar!

201
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,277
Yeah, well, this isn't personal either.

202
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,033
Request a transfer.
I won't work with you anymore.

203
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,359
Come on. Let's go.

204
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,436
- Give me your bag.
- I'm gonna be late.

205
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,599
- Step on it.
- Okay.

206
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,549
Stop!

207
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,599
Wasn't I just walking her
to kindergarten yesterday?

208
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,199
Seems like that, huh?

209
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,309
A college sophomore? Oh, God!

210
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,309
Honey, you can't bring King with you.

211
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,119
He's so spoiled, he's gonna
ask for a first-class ticket.

212
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,351
He can at least come to the airport
with us. I'm going to miss him.

213
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,351
- Come on, step on it, let's go.
- Okay.

214
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,269
We have the dorm address,
but not the phone number.

215
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,476
So you call as soon
as you get there, okay?

216
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,709
Yes, ma'am.

217
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,752
I've been thinking about the dorm...

218
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,391
and we could probably save a ton
of money if I got an apartment.

219
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,553
Honey, in our price range,
you'd wind up in an Oakland slum.

220
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,669
Probably a communist Oakland slum,
right, Dad?

221
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,711
Nothing like fascist Annapolis.

222
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,598
- Are you really going to take that job?
- I don't know, honey.

223
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,589
I really don't.

224
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,793
They'd kick me out of Berkeley
on general principles.

225
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,349
That they might.

226
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,960
- Tight driving, Dad. Time to spare.
- Okay, honey.

227
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,871
I'll park the car and walk you to the gate.

228
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,474
No, you don't have to do that.
King will be alone.

229
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,913
- King's okay.
- I'll be okay.

230
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,638
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

231
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,631
- I'm a grown-up now, remember?
- Okay.

232
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,111
- I love you guys.
- Love you, too.

233
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,474
- Bye.
- Bye.

234
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,269
Boy.

235
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,676
<i>Last boarding call for Flight 93.</i>

236
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,514
Good morning.

237
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,477
Is that black dog visiting again?

238
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,753
You only have one class today.
Why don't you drop by Dr. Goldman's?

239
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,559
He can readjust your medication, Fazul.

240
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,111
The depression will lift, Catherine.

241
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,869
It always does.

242
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,319
- Morning.
- Good morning.

243
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,436
Did you say
your morning prayers, Josef?

244
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,039
Dad, come on.

245
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,359
I don't even know the direction
of Mecca from this house.

246
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,709
No.

247
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,470
Didn't I see you wearing
that shirt yesterday?

248
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,675
Yeah, it's clean.

249
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,668
Please, you're picking up Melissa.
Change it.

250
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,509
Okay, Mum.

251
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,109
Oh, my God.

252
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,349
Mum!

253
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,399
<i>Apparently a plane has just crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center... </i>

254
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,029
<i>here in New York City. </i>
<i>It happened just a few moments ago. </i>

255
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,598
It's a terrible accident.

256
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,913
If it was an accident.

257
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,712
I think that look is a very good look.

258
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,794
No regrets?

259
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,468
Only that you didn't retire
a little sooner, maybe.

260
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,239
- I'll make coffee.
- Okay.

261
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,158
I gotta get going.

262
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,673
- <i>The second building was just hit. </i>
- <i>This is a piece of tape. </i>

263
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,036
<i>We may actually see another plane</i>
<i>enter the picture here in a second. </i>

264
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,875
<i>Here comes the videotape</i>
<i>we just showed you. </i>

265
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,316
<i>That appeared to be at least a 727</i>
<i>we saw a second ago. </i>

266
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,755
<i>You will see a large plane right there... </i>

267
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,118
<i>maybe even bigger, flying right into</i>
<i>the side of the World Trade Center. </i>

268
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,639
<i>Katie, thank you very much. </i>
<i>I'm joined by Tom Brokaw. </i>

269
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,230
- You're coming back in?
- We're at war, Maggie.

270
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,189
<i>The Federal Aviation Administration has</i>
<i>shut down all air traffic nationwide... </i>

271
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,432
Flight 186 Center, turn right,
heading 240, contact Atlanta...

272
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,432
Approach on 128.75. Over.

273
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,715
We've still got 11 flights not responding.

274
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,119
What's the matter with them?

275
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,029
Gentlemen...

276
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,198
the Pentagon's been hit, too.

277
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,595
FAA's still got seven aircraft
still not responding.

278
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,511
3 are off-course from filed flight plans.

279
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,909
General, Chairman of Joint Chiefs,
line one.

280
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,269
Yes, sir.

281
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,109
All right, sir.

282
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,639
The President has just ordered...

283
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,029
the fighters to arm
their missiles at this time.

284
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,796
Any aircraft not responding
to visual command is to be shot down.

285
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,878
<i>Confirming that the South Tower of the</i>
<i>World Trade Center has just collapsed. </i>

286
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,071
<i>Who knows how many people</i>
<i>were inside... </i>

287
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,752
Sweet Jesus, what's going on?

288
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,389
Oh, no.

289
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,671
<i>Cleveland Center, confirm your flight... </i>

290
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,869

291
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,598
<i>You're clear for missile-lock. Engage. </i>

292
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,199
<i>Oh, man. </i>

293
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,595
<i>Respond or you will be fired upon. </i>

294
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,557
- What the hell is going on?
- <i>Rock your wings. Come on, man. </i>

295
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,517
<i>Do you read, 182? What is your status?</i>

296
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,034
<i>I got a missile-lock. </i>

297
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,157
<i>I need orders here. </i>
<i>Do I launch on this aircraft or not?</i>

298
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,510
Don't shoot. We copy you! We copy!

299
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,352
Are you on the wrong frequency?

300
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,558
<i>Do I shoot?</i>

301
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,675
<i>Negative, One. Negative. Abort. </i>
<i>Repeat. Abort. They're responding. </i>

302
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,070
<i>Bring them down. Take a deep breath</i>
<i>and start escorting them to O'Hare. </i>

303
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,833
<i>Standby for O'Hare. 2-7.</i>

304
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,113
<i>Again, Jim... </i>

305
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,668
<i>here's the flights</i>
<i>we know were hijacked:</i>

306
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,355
<i>American Flight 11, Boston</i>
<i>to Los Angeles, American Flight 77... </i>

307
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,193
<i>both of those</i>
<i>in the Trade Center attacks. </i>

308
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,192
<i>United Flight 175, Boston to LAX... </i>

309
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,750
<i>we don't know, we haven't confirmed</i>
<i>the status of what happened to that... </i>

310
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,794
<i>and United 93,</i>
<i>Newark to San Francisco... </i>

311
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,599
<i>believed to be down in Pennsylvania. </i>

312
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,639
<i>Jim, have officials given us any</i>
<i>indication of what communications... </i>

313
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,759
- <i>preceded these crashes?</i>
- He didn't say United 93?

314
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,389
Ted?

315
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,237
Tell me that he didn't say that!

316
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,109
No!

317
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,678
My baby.

318
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,310
NSA, the NSC, ourselves,
it's pretty much one voice, sir:

319
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,789
Al Qaeda.

320
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,031
That would be supported by the
Massoud assassination the other day.

321
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,872
They didn't want
an Anti-Taliban leader...

322
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,235
just waiting to aid us
if we decide to go in.

323
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,273
We'll go in, all right.

324
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,789
That city hadn't been touched by
another nation since the War of 1812.

325
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,670
This operation called
for planning, funding.

326
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,472
Why didn't we see it coming, people?

327
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,829
Why?

328
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,595
<i>We have numerous</i>
<i>unconfirmed reports... </i>

329
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,358
Latest chatter intercepts.

330
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,956
They're celebrating like
it's New Year's Eve.

331
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,156
We knew about
the possibility of hijacking.

332
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,315
But using commercial airliners
as missiles?

333
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,829
No.

334
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,594
You notice the date?

335
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,754
Yes, sir, I did.

336
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,109
God above.

337
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,954
Those fighter planes,
did they almost shoot at us?

338
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,549
Ted McKee.

339
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,076
I'm screwed, Dad.
I missed my plane. I got the next one.

340
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,032
Where are you, Melissa?

341
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,436
Chicago. O'Hare.
Who's doing this to us?

342
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,272
I don't know, baby.

343
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,194
Melissa, honey?

344
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,109
Hi, Mum.

345
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,831
The sound of your voice...

346
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,792
<i>And I want to thank</i>
<i>Governor Pataki for... </i>

347
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,273
<i>the incredible cooperation</i>
<i>and coordination... </i>

348
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,511
<i>including deploying the National Guard. </i>

349
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,749
We had all of it.

350
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,990
All the dots,
we just didn't connect them.

351
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,356
- We screwed up.
- No, Frank. The system did.

352
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,794
We screwed up.

353
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,590
<i>Some believe United Flight 93</i>
<i>was headed for the White House. </i>

354
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,319
<i>Although President Bush</i>
<i>was in Florida at the time... </i>

355
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,509
What?

356
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,269
Melissa?

357
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,875
I'm okay.

358
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,359
Where are you now? Where?

359
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,469
I'm okay.

360
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,272
Which ones are friends
of yours, Vlenko?

361
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,554
You've been attacked.

362
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,109
Bad for you, good for me.
I got lots to say.

363
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,515
But not until I get immunity.

364
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,990
Full American brand, Big Time G-Man.

365
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,513
I get written guarantee.

366
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,559
- That son of a bitch.
- This one.

367
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,234
He recognized him.
He's got dual citizenship.

368
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,515
Syria and here. Right here. Seattle.

369
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,033
- And guess what else?
- What?

370
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,759
He just got back from Afghanistan.

371
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,150
CIA believes he was involved
in a political assassination over there.

372
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,390
- He's Al Qaeda.
- Can we get a warrant?

373
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,950
Today? I think we can get
a warrant on Nancy Reagan.

374
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,314
"Brutal US foreign policy
in the Middle East...

375
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,910
"being primarily dictated
by the powerful 'Jewish Block Vote'...

376
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,434
"in American domestic politics. "

377
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,877
Who's the author, Joseph Goebbels?

378
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,955
Some poli-sci prof down in Berkeley.
Adel. Doctor Fazul Adel.

379
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,797
Wait a sec.

380
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,394
Let's get a translation.

381
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,400
But now you must put aside
your petty differences.

382
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,075
Fight as one.

383
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,679
Because if you don't,
the Taliban will never be defeated...

384
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,593
and we all might just
as well go home right now.

385
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,197
He says he will not join this fight
because of Hezmir...

386
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,829
that guy over there, who he says
he hates more than the Taliban.

387
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,429
Ask him if...

388
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,355
three ounces of pure gold
would soften his position on Hezmir.

389
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,589
He says fine.

390
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,349
Man, forget it!

391
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,993
Hey!

392
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,668
How's it going?

393
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,159
Bad diplomatic-hair day?

394
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,151
I thought you were off
grazing in a pasture.

395
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,275
Yeah, right.

396
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,157
They're a bunch of raggedy-ass
gang-bangers!

397
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,673
There will never be an alliance.

398
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,273
Karzai!

399
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,918
- What the hell did he just say?
- Inspirational words.

400
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,873
You know how to ride, don't you?

401
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,712
- Wouldn't a truck be better?
- No.

402
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,075
Come on, son. Ass-kicking to be done.

403
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,195
- I want to get an apartment together.
- Okay.

404
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,675
<i>I, Tom Ridge, do solemnly swear... </i>

405
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,079
- <i>... that I will support and defend... </i>
- <i>... that I will support and defend... </i>

406
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,395
<i>the Constitution of the United States. </i>

407
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,349
Ted McKee.

408
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,749
<i>Annapolis has been informed</i>
<i>you'll not be taking... </i>

409
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,671
<i>the position as Academic Dean, sir. </i>

410
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,273
- Who is this?
- <i>Please, sir. </i>

411
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,430
<i>Be standing by for your</i>
<i>Commander-in-Chief. </i>

412
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,111
Honey, what was that all about?

413
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,909
I don't know.

414
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,670
Your immunity agreement says
you have to tell us everything you know.

415
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,948
So if you get caught in a lie,
even a teeny itsy-bitsy one...

416
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,793
this means nothing.
You understand that?

417
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,352
Were the men you were dealing with
members of Al Qaeda, Vlenko?

418
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,397
Some American gang kids.
Some Al Qaeda.

419
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,712
But this, I only think,
they don't wear badges on forehead.

420
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,839
Aside from the C-4...

421
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,674
we have tapes of you saying...

422
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,354
you could provide uranium
for one of your "customers".

423
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,396
Did that transaction ever take place?

424
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,676
Was crap from bull.

425
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,116
So maybe I fake...

426
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,353
just make some bucks, who knows?

427
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,553
- Recognize him?
- Khan.

428
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,955
Like Genghis. Nice guy for Moslem.

429
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,438
Was he the man who tried to buy
the Uranium from you, Vlenko?

430
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,596
Will you testify to that in a court of law?

431
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,154
Only if she don't do more beat-ups.

432
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,470
Do you, Admiral Theodore McKee,
without any mental reservation...

433
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,439
or purpose of evasion,
solemnly swear to defend this nation...

434
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,829
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

435
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,675
and swear to uphold the Constitution
of the United States of America?

436
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,915
I do.

437
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,595
Congratulations. I'm due back in court.

438
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,111
You're gonna like working
for Tom Ridge.

439
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,391
I have no idea what the Office
of Homeland Security is tasked with.

440
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,677
So you're going to have to
fill me in a little bit. Okay?

441
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,671
I called general accounting,
petted some fur backwards pretty hard.

442
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,230
If they don't have those desks
and computers here in just about...

443
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,950
All right. Move it on in!

444
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,158
In World War II, they called
this kind of thing war-born.

445
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,352
I guess it'll come together.

446
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,549
Your staff.

447
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,431
Is there anyone you'd like me to call?

448
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,229
God.

449
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,800
I think he's a little busy right now, Ted.

450
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,078
How about Sol Binder?
He knows his way around the Beltway.

451
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,118
Sol Binder. NSA, Lorraine.
Give him a call.

452
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,629
I know...

453
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,880
plus the porous borders,
a free and open society...

454
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,077
privacy laws guaranteed
under the Federal Constitution.

455
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,991
No, it's more than that.

456
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,678
A lot of it's structural.
Take the FBI. Great investigators.

457
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,879
Probably the best in the world. But they
don't bash in doors and shoot people.

458
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,155
They build legal cases against them.

459
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,110
CIA, DIA, they may be a little more
go-get-'em-type outfits...

460
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,599
but they're not really supposed
to work these shores.

461
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,791
We don't want a national Gestapo.

462
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,075
Stovepiping. You know what that is?

463
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,110
Every agency channels its own smoke
up and out its own chimney.

464
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,194
Don't want it wafting
into the other guy's office.

465
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,514
Agencies are in competition. Funding,
internal promotions, you name it.

466
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,798
- That's what the Army and Navy do.
- No, not like this.

467
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,599
This is a political town.

468
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,318
Look, say we stumbled onto something.

469
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,595
We're pulling on a little
investigative thread.

470
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,352
We share it with another agency.

471
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,590
Maybe they've got something
that can help us.

472
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,069
You want to know what's happened
more than once?

473
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,189
What?

474
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,074
We've read about it in the next day's
<i>Washington Post. </i>

475
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,479
Or it goes the other way.

476
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,870
The other guy's operation is tight as
a drum, only they don't help us...

477
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,949
they just follow it up.

478
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,634
Maybe they make an arrest,
catch a few little fish...

479
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,311
and we were after the whole school.

480
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,599
Bureaucracies in action.

481
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,670
I don't know how long
Homeland's going to last.

482
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,876
It's not official, but, Sol, if it were...

483
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,273
what if we had a chance
to build a bridge...

484
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,511
that would link all the agencies together
in some coherent way...

485
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,795
would you come help us build it?

486
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,189
What you are asking is a lot, my friend.

487
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,959
If I bolt the fold, I could be
committing career suicide.

488
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,712
I'm a little desperate, Sol.

489
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,430
I think the country's
a little desperate, too.

490
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,154
- Let me talk to Sarah.
- Talk to Sarah.

491
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,870
The Third Pillar of Islam?

492
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,033
<i>Al Zakat:</i> The Giving of Charity.

493
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,994
Originally, this was a free-will donation,
but now it is largely compulsory.

494
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,829
Two-and-a-half percent of every Moslem
income goes for the needy. Excuse me.

495
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,036
- What?
- They just took Dad away in handcuffs.

496
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,838
- Who took him away?
- They wouldn't talk.

497
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,876
They just put him in the car and left.

498
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,434
Class is dismissed.
We shall reconvene next Friday.

499
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,589
Class dismissed.

500
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,308
Azul, get those things out
of here! They stink.

501
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,033
- Americans.
- Tango 12 is in the building.

502
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,113
A- Teams. They've been in the country
since the 13th training the locals.

503
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,953
- Oh, yeah. I'm all shook up.
- Here we go.

504
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,112
So here I am. I'm being shelled.

505
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,074
I've got blisters on my ass,
I'm laying in mud.

506
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,028
I'm looking down on myself
from a UAV...

507
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,473
bouncing a video signal off a satellite
to a laptop lying in horse crap...

508
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,632
and Elvis just walked by.
Is this a dream?

509
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,517
You haven't seen the best part yet.

510
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,833
Meet your enemy.

511
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,956
Looks like they're dialing in the range.

512
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,076
Why aren't we sending in
something of our own?

513
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,594
Talking to the missus?

514
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,638
They're trying to talk the Taliban
provincial boss into surrender...

515
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,711
without spilling
all kinds of Afghani blood.

516
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,709
Call it in.

517
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,232
Just keep it outside the city walls.
Show them what we got.

518
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,150
Delroy 87 requesting a JDAM strike.
Coordinates, 32...

519
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,639
...7, one minute east.

520
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,558
Oh, yeah. They're all shook up.

521
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,148
- Town's ours. Let's go.
- Move it out!

522
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,953
Karzai!

523
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,833
You go, girl, I can relate!

524
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,029
Al Qaeda.

525
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,915
Losers!

526
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,991
Azul, it's my job
to download these people.

527
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,833
Next time, ask your friends
to take some of them alive.

528
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,309
- I'll give them back when I'm done.
- I'm sorry, sir.

529
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,710
Taliban Al Qaeda headed this way.
Yo! Tango 12!

530
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,512
- They're trying to take back the town.
- Let's set up a perimeter.

531
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,228
May I have a towel or something
to wipe my hands?

532
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,319
Just use the towel on your head, sheik.

533
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,679
Get in the cell.

534
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,950
This is a horrible mistake.

535
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,512
Dr. Fazul Adel.

536
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,910
What's your relationship with him, Saif?

537
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,470
We know you know him. You have
notebooks filled with his name.

538
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,228
You've got some other names
in your notebooks, too.

539
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,751
They all Al Qaeda, Saif?

540
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,600
Or maybe you were just buying rocks
over there.

541
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,639
I quote the words of...

542
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,190
our American Constitution:

543
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,235
"The right of the people is to be secure
in their person, houses, properties...

544
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,193
"and effects against
unreasonable searches and seizures. "

545
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,109
You have ignored these words
of our Founding Fathers.

546
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,751
I would like to speak to my attorney.

547
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,590
Personally, think it's the Agency's
biggest embarrassment...

548
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,399
- since the Angleton affair.
- Do you know what's hard?

549
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,672
We can't talk about all our successes,
and there's a lot of them...

550
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,716
I nearly lost my seat over NAFTA.

551
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,752
And if I get behind
a new non-union agency...

552
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,115
- it'll be the end of the line, believe me.
- Come on.

553
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,476
We're talking about security
of the homeland. We're at war.

554
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,155
"I think I'll just have to call my
union rep before I charge that hill, sir. "

555
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,309
Give me a break.

556
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,675
Admiral, the FBI
is a civil service operation.

557
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,194
Are you saying their performance
suffers because of it?

558
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,111
I think the President and Gov. Ridge...

559
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,316
want to keep us
out of the civil service system...

560
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,712
to get us up faster,
make us more adaptable. Fluid.

561
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:27,358
- CIA isn't fluid enough for you?
- I didn't say that, you did.

562
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,989
We could be creating a domestic
paramilitary operation here...

563
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,116
which may give comfort to some...

564
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,237
but I'm sure even you know
the dangers of the precedent it sets...

565
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,276
- Even me? Really?
- Ted.

566
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,675
Darling, hi. This is my wife, Alise.

567
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,637
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello, gentlemen.

568
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,435
- Are you okay?
- I think so. These darn shoes.

569
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,670
Let me get you out of here.
I better sit you down.

570
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,637
- Excuse us, gentlemen.
- Excuse us.

571
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,755
Certainly.

572
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,910
- Paramilitary?
- Well, it's a strong...

573
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,950
The Lone Ranger to the rescue.

574
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,873
Oh, boy, I was just about to
hang myself in there.

575
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,712
I'm sure you were fine.

576
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,234
- Admiral McKee, right?
- Yeah.

577
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,793
Well, well, well.

578
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,429
How does it feel
to be a cardboard target?

579
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,789
What?

580
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,398
The Administration, the Bureau,
the Agency...

581
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,190
all those wonderful elected officials
in there.

582
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,755
They know suicide attacks
can't be stopped.

583
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,156
Somebody's got to take the fall, right?

584
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,479
"Let's grab a couple of out-of-towners. "
That'll do it, right?

585
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,035
Brilliant.

586
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,158
You know, you and Ridge...

587
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,190
are the biggest patsies
since Lee Harvey Oswald.

588
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,916
They're all just scared, McKee.

589
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,035
I am. You are.

590
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,429
Everyone is.

591
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,718
Tell them to swing around south.
There's a big hole just over that berm!

592
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,237
No! They're going the wrong way!
Not that south! That south!

593
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,075
They just broke through our right flank!

594
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,119
What? No! We can't even communicate
with our friendlies.

595
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,509
All they've got
are a few fouled-up cell phones!

596
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,599
- You okay?
- Yeah, just get some damn Air here.

597
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,752
Get rid of that technical.

598
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,350
Delroy 87, this is Delroy 82.
Requesting vehicle strike coordinates.

599
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,952
Delroy 87, this is Delroy 82.
Requesting close-end support.

600
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,271
- We're being overrun!
- 52s are still loitering.

601
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,508
Call it in.

602
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,629
87, our position is being overrun.

603
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,072
Requesting JDAM strike
right down on top of us!

604
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,993
Coordinates 32.33...

605
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,512
Everybody down!

606
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,718
Not exactly the James Bond lifestyle
I signed up for.

607
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,559
No!

608
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,075
God.

609
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,760
We need to interrogate them.
I need to find bin Laden.

610
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,830
It was courageous of you
to call the air strikes.

611
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,270
I'm proud to fight beside you.

612
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,355
No. He ain't on this list.

613
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,868
- Try the SFPD?
- We have been to the police.

614
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,111
We have been to the INS,
District Attorney, the US Attorney...

615
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,350
we have been everywhere!
This is outrageous!

616
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,396
- Come on, Mum.
- Outrageous!

617
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,311
Mum, come on,
the country's been attacked.

618
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,038
Mistakes are gonna happen.

619
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,909
"When an American suburbanite stands
at a service pump filling his car...

620
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,198
"he is not pumping gasoline.
He is pumping Islamic blood. "

621
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,439
Yes, I wrote that, too. In 1972.

622
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,759
I was a young academic,
trying to bring attention to myself.

623
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,154
- It was a phase.
- Recognize any of these men, Dr. Adel?

624
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,074
Not him? You sure?

625
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,076
He's Al Qaeda, Dr. Adel.

626
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,591
Both of you in the same cell?

627
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,394
Cell?

628
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,759
Terrorist cell?

629
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,399
Listen to me.

630
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,715
I lecture in many places. Afterwards,
I converse with many people.

631
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,591
I don't know who they all are.
I don't know this man.

632
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,549
This is a copy of your credit card
statement. December last year.

633
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,757
- It shows a $150 donation...
- This is a fabrication.

634
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,349
It's insane. Am I formally
being charged with a crime here?

635
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,234
Am I?

636
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,155
We have a magic wand.

637
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,911
We wave it
over all the intelligence agencies.

638
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,597
We mesmerize them,
put them under our hypnotic spell.

639
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,117
Then we induce them to send us
all their data...

640
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,877
so that we can get it into one central
computer. Our computer.

641
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,475
Right here:
The Office of Homeland Security.

642
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,319
Then we design a program.

643
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,710
We feed in a name. A time. A place.
A street. Anything.

644
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,112
Press enter. Everything known about
that name, or time, or place, comes up.

645
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,959
All the dots, Ted. All the dots.

646
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,032
Right there in front of you,
just waiting to be connected.

647
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,474
So?

648
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,838
Hell, it's safe.

649
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,512
Compartmentalized.

650
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,875
Computers don't talk
to the <i>Washington Post. </i>

651
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,235
And we keep the loop
practically down to you and me.

652
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,676
If there's a leak, they can just come
right down here and shoot us both.

653
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,955
The only trouble is going to be
getting the other agencies to comply.

654
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,271
They've gotta send us
everything they have. Everything.

655
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,796
Or it won't work.
You know, it just won't work.

656
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,836
So, those stovepipes you talked about...

657
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,957
I think they went into the junk heap,
September 12.

658
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,429
<i>... first American was killed</i>
<i>today in combat... </i>

659
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,193
<i>against hundreds of Osama bin Laden</i>
<i>foreign fighters... </i>

660
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,397
<i>during an uprising at a makeshift prison</i>
<i>in Mazar-e-Sharif. </i>

661
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,278
We know you're Al Qaeda, Damhir.

662
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,273
The equivalent of a major, I'm told.
That about right?

663
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,559
You know where Osama is?

664
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,668
What about Atef?

665
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,639
Get him out of here.

666
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,392
Benai. Benny. You're right up there.
Something like a colonel, right?

667
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,799
Tell me where Osama is, Benny.

668
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,834
- Did it work?
- You think you can sing?

669
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,158
- That guy sounded like a bird.
- Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

670
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,956
Learn anything in Taloqan?

671
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,279
Osama's in Tora Bora.
His number two, Mohammed Atef...

672
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,634
Kabul. I know.

673
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,791
You know Osama's exact whereabouts?

674
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,235
- No.
- Hill 8823.

675
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,914
I had a little thermobaric present
sent up that way.

676
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,592
- This man, here. How bad is he?
- Dying.

677
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,114
- Who is he?
- Member of an AQ cell, back in Seattle.

678
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,270
FBI thinks they're working
on a dirty bomb.

679
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,715
They've been on this guy
since the Kabul airport.

680
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,075
He needs to be medevaced
out of here, Joe. Now.

681
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,636
Go with him. Download him yourself.

682
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,631
We got an interrogation unit
in Kandahar.

683
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,756
A dirty bomb? You do it yourself.

684
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,229
You follow him all the way
to Gitmo if you have to.

685
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,389
Yes, sir.

686
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,473
Look, if they have someone
who even mentions your name...

687
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,120
and the word "radiologic"
in the same sentence...

688
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,316
- we're screwed.
- My fate...

689
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,078
is in the hands of Allah.

690
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,918
You look stunning, Vlenko.
Right out of <i>GQ.</i>

691
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,271
Sorry to be a fashion-smasher, Vlenko.
Put that on.

692
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,150
- Makes me look fat.
- Vlenko, you are fat.

693
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,675
Come on. What the hell are you doing?

694
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,953
- Shots!
- Shots!

695
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,512
Seattle, this is SE-21.
We've taken sniper fire in the alleyway.

696
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,953
Witness down.

697
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,951
- Fulbar, you see him?
- No!

698
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,354
Damn it!

699
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,874
My client is a victim of ethnic profiling
and nothing more, Your Honor.

700
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,238
Now, I'd like to think that this isn't
Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia, but...

701
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,233
Counsel, we're here today
to determine your readiness for trial.

702
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,312
- Is the Prosecution ready to proceed?
- Yes, Your Honor.

703
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,551
Just a minute, Your Honor.

704
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,759
I've just been informed that our key
witness has met with an untimely end.

705
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,596
- Mr. Kahn.
- Khan.

706
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,399
Your Honor.

707
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,160
Mr. Khan, you're free to go.

708
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,754
However, I suggest
that you don't get picked up for...

709
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,479
Found this on the rooftop
two blocks away.

710
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,915
Is Mr. Simms or Miss Alrazi here?

711
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,592
That guy's working on a dirty bomb and
it is not a high school science project.

712
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,075
Suspended from his teaching duties?
For what?

713
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,595
My husband has been serving
that institution for 17 years.

714
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,750
Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

715
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,831
I'm going to resign my position
in protest...

716
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,753
and then I'm going straight
to the media! Do you hear me?

717
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,196
- Is there anything I can do, Mrs. Adel?
- No. Please, both of you...

718
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,995
I'm just not fit
for human contact right now.

719
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,838
It's okay, Mum. Don't worry.

720
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,912
He'll be okay. Don't worry.
We'll get him out of there, all right?

721
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,116
He doesn't even have his medication.

722
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,672
Dad, you have to do something.

723
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,709
Mel, it doesn't sound right. I'll get into it.

724
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,429
Now, how does Josef's father
spell his first name? F-A-Z...

725
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,996
U- L. Fazul.

726
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,954
I'll make some calls.

727
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,511
Mel, are you okay?

728
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,394
Yeah. No.

729
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,391
<i>Is anybody okay right now?</i>

730
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,948
Agent Jane Fulbar?
Special Agent Roland...

731
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,510
Office of Professional Responsibility.
What you're doing here is illegal.

732
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,034
He has a restraining order against you
and you know it.

733
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,236
You'll probably be suspended for this,
maybe more.

734
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,038
We're going to
the Federal Building now.

735
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,872
Do you know
what that guy is working on?

736
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,316
You wanna follow us or you wanna
come in one of our cars? In bracelets.

737
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,879
Let's go.

738
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,230
For a non-drinking,
respectful Islamic man like yourself...

739
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,356
that morphine must've felt like...

740
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,469
27 virgins, hey, Hessan?

741
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,992
I'm no doctor, but I know this:
That morphine's worn off.

742
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,752
You're a man in great pain.

743
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,513
Now, this...

744
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,435
this is non-pain.
This is a double-dose. 54 virgins.

745
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,152
We know about your dirty bomb.

746
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,596
Only with your Russian friend
no longer with us...

747
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,558
you'll probably have to go with waste
as originally planned.

748
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,836
Where are you keeping that waste?

749
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,356
If you've lost your English skills,
there's someone else who can use this.

750
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,634
Jamaitja...

751
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,636
brings from Vancouver.

752
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,951
Jamaitja? Your friend here.
He's in Canada now?

753
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,393
One more question, and then I plunge.

754
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,832
Where in Seattle does your cell meet?
An address, Mohammed.

755
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,913
- Not Seattle. Oakland.
- Where in Oakland?

756
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:35,069
I've been in Afghanistan for six months.

757
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,752
I don't know. Please.

758
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,232
Detainee had a fly on his face.
I was just gonna get rid of it, sir.

759
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,594
Let him be.

760
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,112
Understand the sentiment, though.

761
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,594
They're all coming through.

762
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,558
If it relates to Homeland Security,
we've got it. All of it.

763
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,633
The new weapon of war.
Not a ship, not a plane. A computer.

764
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,393
- Information.
- It's a new world, Ted. New kind of war.

765
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,152
- Yeah.
- Admiral.

766
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,112
- Bradley Brand. I'm Agency.
- Good to meet you.

767
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,349
- Sol Binder.
- Hey.

768
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,793
I just got back from Guantanamo.

769
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,031
I hear this is the new information
clearinghouse for homeland threats.

770
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,031
We're getting there.
What can we do for you?

771
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,317
Are you aware of an Al Qaeda cell
operating out of Oakland, California?

772
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,073
They're playing with a dirty bomb.
LAX is the intended target.

773
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,469
We knew they were sniffing around
radiologic material.

774
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,993
We didn't know it was LAX.

775
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,831
- Excuse me.
- Tell me what you've got.

776
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,831
I've got some data on where the
dirty material may be coming from...

777
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,399
but not enough for an interdiction.

778
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,471
I was hoping you guys
could fill in some blanks.

779
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,915
- I'll do my best.
- What do you know about this man?

780
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,355
His name's Jamaitja.
He's got Canadian papers.

781
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,951
I don't know. Let's feed him
into the big boy, see what we've got.

782
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,914
Yeah, honey, I got the call
just a few minutes ago.

783
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,036
<i>Oh, Dad. Where was he?</i>

784
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,910
Some unused juvenile facility
outside of San Jose.

785
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,956
Is he being released?

786
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,514
There are some things
he'll have to explain later on...

787
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,910
but there's really nothing to hold him on.
They're gonna release him now.

788
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,069
Dad.

789
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,998
- Thank you.
- <i>Mel... </i>

790
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,910
I had a little difficulty
getting this number.

791
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,833
- Someone at the dorm room said...
- <i>I got to call the Adels, okay?</i>

792
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,559
They've been through hell.
All right, I'll call you back.

793
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,039
I love you, Daddy.

794
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,758
- What the hell are those for?
- Sorry about your suspension.

795
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,913
Come on in.

796
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,958
Well, it's bad.

797
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,073
Khan got another lawyer,
and he's raising holy hell.

798
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,470
And it's not my first offence.

799
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,871
I think they're gonna fire me.

800
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,239
Oh, man.

801
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,114
Where are they bringing him from,
Antarctica?

802
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,994
My dad said he was somewhere
near San Jose.

803
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,313
It's a long drive.

804
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,713
Anyone from the family of Adel?
Dr. Fazul Adel?

805
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,789
Yes.

806
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,272
- You're related to Fazul Adel?
- Yes, I am his wife.

807
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,510
This is his stepson, Josef.

808
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,670
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

809
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,710
Your husband committed suicide.

810
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,998
This is insane.
Dr. Adel didn't do anything. Nothing.

811
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,436
Melissa, honey, please.

812
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,589
<i>I don't know how Dad expects</i>
<i>any of these people to help him. </i>

813
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,596
Melissa, will you talk to your father?
He's as upset about this as you are.

814
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,794
Fine.

815
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:49,192
- Mel...
- You're a part of all this, Dad.

816
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,989
<i>I used to be proud to be a McKee. </i>

817
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,072
- I should go out there.
- It's better if I go alone, Ted.

818
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,878
At least until she calms down.

819
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,959
<i>... findings are preliminary. </i>

820
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,113
<i>A member of Sen. Daschle's staff</i>
<i>is being treated for exposure to anthrax. </i>

821
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,232
<i>Members of Congress are asking... </i>

822
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,355
Heinhoff.

823
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,839
<i>... what can possibly happen next. </i>

824
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,638
Khan is fair game again?

825
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,076
Isn't that just supreme. He's probably
in freaking Bahrain by now.

826
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,189
Oakland?

827
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:31,191
1893 Lake Merritt Boulevard.

828
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,794
Yeah, I got it. I'll catch the next flight.

829
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,470
Good guy. Don't shoot.

830
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,114
Come on in.

831
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,317
- A spook? A real one?
- Yeah. Why?

832
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,152
I just never met one of you guys before.

833
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,198
Well, from here on in,
I think we'll all be working a lot closer.

834
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,919
Amen. Frank Heinhoff, Seattle office.

835
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,879
Bradley Brand. Kromberg Station.
You guys get any action over there?

836
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,357
The place has been empty for two days.

837
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,589
You hungry?

838
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,433
- Yeah.
- Hold on.

839
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,478
We got some action.

840
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,958
They're speaking Arabic.

841
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,633
Okay, they're meeting,
the others are late...

842
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,320
We might be able to grab
their whole damn cell.

843
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,909
You guys have something to do
with locating this place?

844
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,195
No. It's this new outfit, Homeland.

845
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,592
I had some intel. They cross-referenced
it with stuff they had...

846
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,274
- and this address popped up.
- Oh, yeah. Here we go.

847
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,599
I don't see Khan.

848
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,756
You're looking
for that son of a bitch, too?

849
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,039
Hold on. They have a cell call.

850
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,918
They know we're here.

851
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,920
We've been burned. Execute.

852
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,754
Do you have a point of origination
on that signal?

853
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,518
They're a block from here.

854
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,675
FBI!

855
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,758
Get against the wall!

856
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,794
- Show me your hands!
- Put your hands behind your head!

857
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,393
Turn around!

858
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,796
How much do you want to bet Saif
Khan's prints are all over that thing?

859
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,474
Damn it!

860
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,997
Al Qaeda cell boss from Hamburg.

861
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,200
According to Langley,
he's carrying new marching orders...

862
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,918
to his brothers in Pakistan.

863
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,794
Boy, I'd sure like to know
what route he's taking.

864
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,279
Yeah, Langley, too.

865
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,196
I think they'd like to drop him
a nice card or note or something.

866
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,350
- You guys find anything?
- Yeah.

867
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,829
Blank American passports.
They're perfect looking.

868
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,276
Training camp locations, list of camp
grads already stateside...

869
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,476
- It's a goldmine, sir.
- Right.

870
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,148
Tell the mortuary boys
to do a good job in here.

871
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,630
I want matched body parts in every bag.

872
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,553
Hope these arms and legs
got serial numbers on them.

873
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,518
They must've dropped
a damn thermobaric up here.

874
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,519
Yeah, I guess.

875
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,676
- Somebody taking x-rays down here?
- He's on dialysis.

876
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,559
Son of a bitch.

877
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,359
Just need to see your driver's license
for a sec.

878
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,117
Have a nice stay in America, sir.

879
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,591
Put your hands behind your head!

880
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,193
Hands behind your head!

881
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,389
Sweetheart.

882
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,117
I don't want to talk to you.

883
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,479
Melissa.

884
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,153
He left me, Mum.

885
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,589
- Baby, I am so sorry.
- I loved him.

886
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,276
It's really clicking out there.
It's working better than I ever dreamed.

887
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,318
We have a problem, Sol.
There are people being held...

888
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,550
because they have dark skin
and the wrong accents.

889
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,438
I know, it will clean itself up.
It'll just take some time...

890
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,873
Not good enough.

891
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:50,999
Damn it, Sol.

892
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,154
The people of this country
are losing their civil rights...

893
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,117
and the bad guy's already won.

894
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,269
No.

895
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,990
Now you're preaching to the choir.

896
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,832
You remember when I said
we don't want a national Gestapo?

897
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,315
I meant it.

898
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,074
Let me see if I can't get those big boys
to help us...

899
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,196
speed up the processing
of these names...

900
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,316
separate the good apples from the bad.

901
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,989
I'm on this thing, Ted. I'm on it.

902
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,629
Thanks, Sol.

903
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,116
<i>In four short months,</i>
<i>our nation has comforted the victims... </i>

904
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,115
<i>begun to rebuild New York</i>
<i>and the Pentagon... </i>

905
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,472
<i>rallied a great coalition... </i>

906
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,517
<i>captured, arrested and rid the world</i>
<i>of thousands of terrorists... </i>

907
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,319
<i>destroyed Afghanistan's</i>
<i>terrorist training camps... </i>

908
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:52,119
<i>and freed a country</i>
<i>from brutal oppression. </i>

909
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,550
I'm happy that you're back.

910
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,040
I don't know if I'm happy
that we're co-workers again.

911
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,558
We're spies.

912
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,071
We can get away with anything.

913
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,994
<i>... and terrorist leaders who urged</i>
<i>followers to sacrifice their lives... </i>

914
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,237
<i>are running for their own. </i>

915
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,271
<i>America and Afghanistan</i>
<i>are now allies against terror. </i>

916
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,594
<i>We'll be partners</i>
<i>in rebuilding that country. </i>

917
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,675
<i>And this evening we welcome</i>
<i>the distinguished interim leader... </i>

918
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:30,914
<i>of a liberated Afghanistan:</i>
<i>Chairman Hamid Karzai. </i>

919
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,390
Guess what?
I'm not a mortician anymore.

920
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,959
The President's speaking, jackass.

921
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,793
<i>... and use technology</i>
<i>to track the arrivals and departures... </i>

922
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,711
<i>of visitors to the United States. </i>

923
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,758
<i>Homeland Security will make America</i>
<i>not only stronger... </i>

924
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,232
<i>but in many ways, better. </i>

925
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,673
<i>For too long, our culture has said,</i>
<i>"If it feels good, do it. "</i>

926
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,195
<i>Now America is embracing a new ethic,</i>
<i>and a new creed:</i>

927
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,439
<i>"Let's roll. "</i>

928
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,674
She won't return my calls.

929
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:32,033
Time, honey.
Just have to give her a little time.

930
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:36,119
<i>We have known freedom's price. </i>
<i>We have shown freedom's power. </i>

931
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,798
<i>And in this great conflict,</i>
<i>my fellow Americans... </i>

932
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,516
<i>we will see freedom's victory. </i>

933
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,314
<i>Thank you all. May God bless. </i>

934
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,031
I guess I'll never be
a part of this fight again, will I?

935
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,873
We don't know that yet.

936
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,513
I know you are the best of the best.

937
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,388
Which probably means you people are...

938
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,157
- the ones with the most to lose.
- How's that, sir?

939
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,029
Because if you jump ship
and come aboard ours...

940
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,634
which may or may not stay afloat...

941
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,837
you may not be welcomed back.

942
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,758
And we could sink.

943
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,037
Congress hasn't approved
our existence yet.

944
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,629
- Yes?
- Lf we sign on with Homeland...

945
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,039
would we be restricted to
working only domestically?

946
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,317
No. In that we've been given
no official mandate...

947
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,391
we've sort of made up our own.

948
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:47,198
This has to be both a domestic
and an international operation.

949
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:51,273
Those of you who've worked the foreign
venue, you'll continue to work there.

950
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:55,353
Those who worked the domestic side,
you'll continue to work here.

951
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,276
But the overall singular mission...

952
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:04,432
is the defense
of the American homeland.

953
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,038
That's about it.

954
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,998
I won't blame any of you
for not joining us.

955
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,674
But I would appreciate a response
within 24 hours.

956
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,228
We need to know ASAP.

957
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,748
Thank you.

958
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,469
I'm in.

959
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,713
I'm in, too.

960
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,795
- I'm in.
- I'm in, sir.

961
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,231
- Question, sir.
- Yes.

962
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,156
- Osama bin Laden. High on our hit list?
- Top of the list.

963
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,869
- Old dog, new tricks.
- Welcome aboard.

964
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,119
Did that just happen?

965
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,959
I did tell them how tippy all this is, right?

966
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,076
Yeah. You told them.

967
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:37,358
Talk to you alone a moment, sir?
It's kind of important, Admiral.

968
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,839
At least, to me.

969
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,714
Bad news. They're not backing off.

970
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,997
You don't resign quietly...

971
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,231
they'll indict you on abuse
under the color of authority.

972
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,631
- Thanks. I kind of knew that.
- There's some other bad news.

973
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,353
Are you a sadist?

974
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,239
We're still partners.

975
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,194
Really?

976
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,514
I used his credit card
to make a donation.

977
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,397
I assume they found it.

978
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,991
I feel nothing. I didn't hate or love him.

979
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,753
- He was nothing like my real father.
- You did not know your real father.

980
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,078
I've read about him.

981
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,196
I've spoken to my mother about him
many times.

982
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:16,273
She never knew the glory
that filled that man.

983
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,078
The struggle within, the struggle without
against the Kafirs.

984
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,957
He never lost God in either struggle.
Never once.

985
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,276
I wish he could have seen me.

986
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:34,116
With that rifle? That Russian pig?

987
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,754
You were filled with your father that day.

988
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,990
You would have made him
so proud to heart.

989
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,678
Except for this.

990
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,998
Your mission is to assimilate, Josef.
What is this fuzz?

991
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,556
Me not shaving, nothing more.

992
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,791
That relationship of yours. Renew it.

993
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,393
Fan its flames.

994
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,432
Do you have any idea
how valuable that is for our future?

995
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,434
Melissa.

996
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,272
Please forgive me.
I'll never leave you again.

997
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,869
Ever.
