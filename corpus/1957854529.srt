00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:51,598
- CAREFUL. DON'T HACK THE LIMBS.CUT THEM.

177
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:54,221
I DON'T WANT THEM LOOKING
ALL CHOPPED UP.

178
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:59,502
- YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
A GENERAL.

179
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:01,781
PATTON WOULD HAVE WORSHIPPED
AT YOUR FEET.

180
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:07,407
- [laughs]

181
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:10,859
HELLO THERE.
- HEY.

182
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:13,413
- HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
- TOOK A CAB.

183
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:15,415
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ANYONE?

184
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,417
I WOULD HAVE HAD YOU PICKED UP.
- OH.

185
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:19,350
- IS HENRY WITH YOU?
- YEAH, HENRY'S WITH ME.

186
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,490
- BRITT, YOU TOOK A CAB
WITH A BABY?

187
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,526
- YEAH.

188
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:24,976
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THOSE DRIVERS.

189
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:26,426
THE CABS ARE FILTHY.

190
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,427
A GIRL'S NOT SAFE
IN ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

191
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:29,291
- VALETTA.
- NO.

192
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,395
WHEN JULIAN AND I GO
TO THE AIRPORT,

193
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,949
WE ALWAYS HIRE A LIMO.

194
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:34,503
- OK, FINE.
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

195
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:37,955
- I'M TRYING TO GET THIS PLACEINTO SOME SORT OF SHAPE.

196
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:39,404
[sighs]

197
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:40,612
MAMA DOESN'T WANT TO
SPEND ANY MONEY ON IT,

198
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:41,855
AND IT'S GETTING RUNDOWN.

199
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,546
I MEAN, HERE IT IS NOVEMBER.

200
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:45,307
ALL OF THIS SHOULD HAVE
BEEN DONE MONTHS AGO.

201
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:47,205
- LOOK'S PRETTY GOOD TO ME.

202
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,551
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

203
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:50,243
IT'S IN TERRIBLE CONDITION.

204
00:13:50,277 --> 00:13:52,935
THE HOUSE NEEDS PAINT
AND A MILLION OTHER THINGS.

205
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,491
SHE JUST HAS NO IDEA WHAT NEEDS
TO BE DONE AROUND HERE.

206
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:58,976
- HOW IS MAGGIE?

207
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,048
- YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
TO SEE HER YET?

208
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:05,085
UH, SHE'S GOOD.

209
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,881
SHE'S OVER THERE
WORKING IN HER FLOWER BEDS.

210
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,402
- SO, UM, YOU GOING TO
BE HERE FOR A WHILE?

211
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:13,093
- NO, I AM OUT OF HERE

212
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:14,888
AS SOON AS I CAN GET THESE GUYS
TO FINISH UP.

213
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:16,614
LITTLE JULIAN HAS
PIANO PRACTICE.

214
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,065
BUT WE'RE ALL COMING FOR DINNER.- OH, OK.

215
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,032
THEN I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- MM-HMM.

216
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,103
UH, BRITT?

217
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:25,416
DON'T FORGET TO DRESS
FOR DINNER.

218
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,453
- [laughs]

219
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:33,389
OK. DRESS FOR DINNER.

220
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,495
RIGHT.

221
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,601
- [sighs]

222
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,888
- MAGGIE?

223
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:54,928
- BRITT.

224
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,625
IT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER.

225
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:06,664
YOU COULD HAVE CALLED
NOW AND THEN.

226
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,356
- SO COULD YOU.

227
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:21,437
- NOW LET ME GET A LOOK AT YOU.

228
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:23,439
YOU'RE PENCIL THIN.

229
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,064
- YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

230
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:29,411
- [laughs]

231
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:32,655
THESE WRINKLES KEEP MULTIPLYING
LIKE HOUSEFLIES.

232
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,072
GROWING OLD IS FOR THE BIRDS.

233
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:37,108
- IT'S HARD FOR ME TO
IMAGINE YOU OLD.

234
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:39,283
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
I WON'T GIVE INTO IT.

235
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:41,112
[laughs]

236
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:43,563
YOUR FATHER AND I USED TO
BE OUT HERE FOR HOURS AND HOURS

237
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:45,565
WITH ALL THESE LEAVES FALLING.

238
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,567
WE'D BE RAKING UNTIL
OUR BACKS WERE ACHING.

239
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:49,327
[laughs]

240
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:52,641
YES, I'M GOING TO PLANT
ZINNIAS HERE THIS SPRING.

241
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,677
IT WAS YOUR FATHER'S
FAVORITE FLOWER, YOU KNOW.

242
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,272
- SO HOW YOU BEEN FEELING?

243
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:08,174
- PEOPLE MAKE SUCH A FUSS
ABOUT GETTING OLD.

244
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,658
THAT'S ALL THEY EVER
WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

245
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,798
NEXT SUBJECT.

246
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,765
- WHY DO WE HAVE TO
CHANGE THE SUBJECT?

247
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:19,702
- I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS
HOLIDAY INTO A WAR ZONE, BRITT.

248
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:21,428
DO WE UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER?

249
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:24,673
- I DIDN'T START ANYTHING.

250
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:27,641
- DO WE UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER?

251
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,712
- I'M GOING TO GO CHECK
ON HENRY.

252
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:32,681
- IS THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND?

253
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:36,478
- NO, IT'S MY SON, REMEMBER?

254
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:40,171
- OH, CHARLIE WAS SO HANDSOME.

255
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:42,001
- WHAT DOES DADDY
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

256
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:55,635
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THE OLD PLACE?

257
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:57,740
- NOTHING SEEMS TO CHANGE.

258
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:03,712
WANT TO COME MEET
YOUR GRANDSON?

259
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:06,611
- WELL, NO. I'LL MEET HIM
AT DINNER, DEAR.

260
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:07,603
[cell phone rings]

261
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,780
- HELLO?

262
00:18:11,814 --> 00:18:13,713
- CLAIRE GOODMAN EISENBERG,

263
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,232
HAVE YOU BECOME
A BORING OLD BITTY?

264
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:17,303
- [laughs]BRITT, WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU?

265
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:21,134
- [laughs]
I AM RIGHT HERE AT HOME.

266
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:24,172
- OH MY, HENRY.
IS HE WONDERFUL?

267
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:28,693
- HENRY'S BEAUTIFUL.
HE'S...HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

268
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:29,798
- OK, I HAVE TO SEE YOU.

269
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:32,180
- TOMORROW?
- PERFECT.

270
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:34,320
UH, GET YOUR BEHIND OUT HERE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,

271
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:35,321
AND WEAR YOUR BOOTS.

272
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:36,805
- SEE YA.

273
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,393
[clicks off phone]

274
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:39,463
[sighs]

275
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:03,590
- WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

276
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:09,148
COME ON, SWEETIE.

277
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:18,329
- [cooing]
- HEY, BRITT. LONG TIME NO SEE.

278
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:19,606
- [laughs]
HEY, JULIAN.

279
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:23,300
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
- LOOK AT HIM.

280
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:26,648
- OH MY GOODNESS! HELLO!
[kissing sounds]

281
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:30,307
OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BOY.

282
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:32,378
- WELL, HE HAS YOUR EYES.

283
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:34,345
- I THINK THEY'RE NICHOLAS'S.

284
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,278
- WHERE IS THIS NICHOLAS
ANYWAY?

285
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:37,900
- HE'S IN L.A.

286
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:40,696
- WELL, HE LOOKS HEALTHY.

287
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:44,355
- HERE, YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM?- NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.

288
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,495
- [baby gurgles]

289
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,877
- COME ON.

290
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:50,741
COME ON IN THE KITCHEN
WITH AUNT BILLY.

291
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,777
YOU CAN HELP ME OUT.

292
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:55,642
- OK, MAGGIE, HERE YOU GO.

293
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:57,368
- THANK YOU.

294
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:59,301
- SO WHAT'S YOUR POISON, BRITT?
BOURBON?

295
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:00,647
- I'LL JUST HAVE
SOME WHITE WINE.

296
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:02,891
- SURE.

297
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:04,513
- WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

298
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,242
IT JUST SEEMS SO DOUR.

299
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:11,796
- I THINK IT'S YOUR BASICSYLVIA PLATH NUMBER, ISN'T IT?

300
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:13,660
- [laughs]
- [sighs]

301
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,318
COULD WE PLEASE NOT DO THIS
TONIGHT?

302
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:19,804
- COLOR. JUST GIVE ME
LOTS OF COLOR ANYTIME.

303
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,669
WHERE DID YOU FLY IN FROM?

304
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:24,913
- DETROIT. PHOENIX.

305
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:26,673
I MADE A PRESENTATION
THIS MORNING

306
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,950
AT OMNIDEC IN SAN FRANCISCO.

307
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:29,711
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.

308
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:32,921
I'M WORN OUT
JUST GETTING OFF THE PLANE.

309
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:37,822
- THE PORTERS AT THE AIRPORT
SEE MORE OF HIM THAN I DO.

310
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:41,757
- COME AND GET IT
BEFORE I CAN SKATE ON IT!

311
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:42,896
[crickets chirping]

312
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,726
- SIT UP STRAIGHT, JULIAN.

313
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,350
- OH, AND PLEASE DO NOT
USE YOUR SALAD FORK

314
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:49,731
FOR THE HAM.

315
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:53,355
- HEY, RELAX.
IT'S NOT A STEAK DINNER.

316
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,426
- HE NEEDS TO LEARN
TABLE MANNERS.

317
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:56,841
HE MIGHT BE AT A FUNCTION
SOME DAY

318
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:58,498
WHERE IT WILL COME IN HANDY.

319
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,431
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHEREHE'S GOING TO BE IN 20 YEARS.

320
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:03,434
LET HIM BE A KID, RIGHT.

321
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:05,712
[laughs]
- NO, NO.

322
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:08,853
- WELL, WE CERTAINLY KNEW
WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE.

323
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:10,476
YOU PRACTICALLY JUMPED
OUT OF THE WOMB,

324
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,720
RAN AROUND THE CORNER
TO THE ART SUPPLY STORE.

325
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:16,999
AND VALETTA YOU CAME OUTWITH A CHECKLIST IN YOUR HAND.

326
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:18,967
all: [laugh]

327
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:21,452
- I THINK SOMEONE
NEEDS A CHANGE.

328
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:23,937
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

329
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:32,946
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HIM
UPSTAIRS?

330
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:34,879
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE.

331
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:38,952
- HE'S A BABY.
EVERYBODY DOES IT.

332
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:41,092
EVEN YOU, MAGGIE.

333
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:41,955
- YOU COULD USE
THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM.

334
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,405
- HMM.

335
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,339
- OK.

336
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:48,928
EVERYTHING UNPLEASANT
OUT OF SIGHT.

337
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:51,310
THAT WAY, IT DOESN'T EXIST.
[baby yells]

338
00:21:54,934 --> 00:21:58,627
- SIT UP STRAIGHT, JULIAN.

339
00:21:58,662 --> 00:22:03,011
- OH, BILLY ALWAYS MAKESTHE MOST SCRUMPTIOUS COBBLERS.

340
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:04,909
MM. BUT DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

341
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:06,497
WE DON'T WANT HER
TO GET THE BIG HEAD.

342
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:08,085
[laughs]

343
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,811
- OUTSTANDING COBBLER, BILLY.

344
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:12,986
- OK, HAVE ANOTHER HELPING,
KIDDO.

345
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:15,782
OK, COFFEE COMING UP.
- LET ME HELP YOU.

346
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:17,991
[dishes rattling]

347
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:20,960

FALLING APART.

523
00:33:16,684 --> 00:33:19,756
- LOOK AT THIS.

524
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,104
REMEMBER WHEN YOU PAINTED THISOF DADDY?

525
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:27,453
- [laughs]

526
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:28,282
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

527
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:35,116
I NEVER WAS ANY GOOD.
- YES, YOU WERE.

528
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:37,084
- [laughs]
OH, PLEASE.

529
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:38,775
I SHOULD HAVE JUST ADMITTED
IT WAS A HOBBY.

530
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,846
- YOU CAN SEE HE WAS
DRINKING TOO MUCH.

531
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,469
- WHAT A THING TO SAY.

532
00:33:43,504 --> 00:33:46,610
- COME ON, EVERYBODY KNEW
HE HAD A PROBLEM.

533
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:48,129
WE JUST NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT.

534
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:51,788
- OH, BRITT.

535
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,134
WHY ON EARTH AREN'T YOU DRESSED?

536
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:55,585
- IT WILL JUST TAKE A MINUTE.

537
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,484
- WELL, PUT ON SOMETHING NICE.- OK.

538
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:01,280
- AND TRY NOT TO LOOK LIKE
A GANGSTER.

539
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,764
[sighs]

540
00:34:06,182 --> 00:34:09,806
[cars honking]
THAT MAKES ME SO DARN MAD.

541
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:14,775
- YOU'RE HOLDING UP TRAFFIC.

542
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:16,157
- THEY'RE JUST SO IMPATIENT.

543
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:20,886
[stomping]
[brakes squeal]

544
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,612
[cars honking]
- I COULD JUST SPIT.

545
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,130
- LET ME DRIVE, OK?

546
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:26,822
- YOU'RE ALL IN SO MUCH
OF A RUSH.

547
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,136
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE IT TO ME.

548
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,172
[car honking]

549
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:33,761
WHERE THE DEVIL
IS THIS PLACE?

550
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:35,900
IT WAS ALWAYS RIGHT HERE
ON THIRD.

551
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:37,489
- WE'RE NOT EVEN ON THIRD.

552
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:38,904
THIRD'S BACK THERE.
IT'S WAY BACK THERE.

553
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:41,699
- I'VE BEEN THERE 100 TIMES.

554
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:43,150
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW
MY OWN TOWN?

555
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:45,496
- WE CAN DO THIS ANOTHER DAY.

556
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:47,568
- NO, WE'RE GOING TO DO IT
TODAY, BRITT.

557
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:51,123
[car honking]

558
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:52,745
[brakes squealing]

559
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:55,817
[car zooms past]

560
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:04,171
LOOK AROUND. YOU MIGHT FIND
SOMETHING YOU LIKE.

561
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:06,207
- YEAH, I BROUGHT SOMETHING
WITH ME.

562
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:07,760
- TAKE A LOOK BECAUSE
YOU MIGHT FIND SOMETHING

563
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:09,693
YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT.
[laughs]

564
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:11,178
AND YOU NEED SOMETHING
FOR THANKSGIVING.

565
00:35:11,212 --> 00:35:13,835
- IT'S THANKSGIVING,
NOT NEW YEARS.

566
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:17,805
- MAY I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

567
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,704
- NO, THANKS.
- YOU'RE THE WRITER.

568
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:23,535
NO, ARTIST. YOUR MOTHERTALKS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME.

569
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:26,538
- REALLY?
- OH, YES.

570
00:35:26,572 --> 00:35:28,850
THIS JUST CAME IN.

571
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:31,508
IT'S EXQUISITE.
- NO, THANK YOU.

572
00:35:31,543 --> 00:35:34,235
- OH, THAT'S DARLING.
WHY DON'T YOU GET THAT?

573
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,824
- UH, IT'S NOT REALLY ME,
THANKS.

574
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:39,206
- OH, BUT IT'S PERFECTLY
LOVELY. MY TREAT.

575
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,242
- NO.
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

576
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:43,969
YOU NEED SOME COLOR.

577
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:46,213
[sighs]WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ONE?

578
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:47,559
- GOOD, BUY IT.

579
00:35:47,593 --> 00:35:50,769
- OH. [laughs]
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.

580
00:35:50,803 --> 00:35:53,220
- WELL, YOU SAID IT WAS
A SPECIAL OCCASION.

581
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:54,876
- ALL RIGHT, YES.
I'LL TAKE IT.

582
00:36:00,986 --> 00:36:02,919
- WILL THERE BE ANYTHING ELSE,MRS. CALHOUN?

583
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,232
- BRITT, DON'T YOU WANT
THAT DRESS?

584
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:09,236
- IT'S REALLY NOT ME.
- YOU'LL WISH YOU HAD.

585
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:14,241
WRAP THIS UP, MARTHA,
AND THE OTHER ONE AS WELL.

586
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:17,934
- MAGGIE, I DON'T WANT IT.

587
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,592
- WHEN YOU GET HOME,
YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND.

588
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:22,973
[laughs]

589
00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:26,253
YOU AND YOUR SISTER VALETTA
ARE NOTHING ALIKE.

590
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:29,911
VALETTA WOULD HAVE HAD THISOUT OF HERE IN A SPLIT SECOND.

591
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:32,293
AND, OF COURSE, HER CLOSETS
ARE ALREADY OVERFLOWING

592
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:34,778
WITH EVERYTHING
UNDER THE SUN.

593
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:36,953
POOR JULIAN.

594
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,299
HE MUST HAVE TO WORK OVERTIME

595
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:41,613
TO PAY FOR THE--
THE, UH...

596
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:45,272
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE...

597
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:47,308
[breathing heavily]

598
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:48,723
WHAT IS THE WORD?

599
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:50,760
- DRY CLEANING BILL?

600
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:51,933
- YES, THAT'S IT.

601
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:57,974
- HERE YOU GO, MRS. CALHOUN.

602
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,769
IS THAT GOING TO BE
CASH OR CHARGE?

603
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:00,942
- IT WILL BE CHARGE, DEAR.

604
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:08,778
- MAGGIE, ARE YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT?

605
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:10,538
WHAT'S GOING ON?

606
00:37:10,573 --> 00:37:12,609
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR YOU.

607
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:13,714
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKINGABOUT.

608
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:14,784
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

609
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,303
- OH, HERE IT COMES.

610
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:18,028
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE THIS BACK?

611
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:20,272
- I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE DRESS, AND YOU KNOW IT.

612
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:21,825
- WELL, THEN I'M GOING TO
TAKE IT BACK.

613
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,310
- NO, MAGGIE. STOP IT!
STOP!

614
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:25,829
STOP!
[ripping]

615
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:37,945
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

616
00:37:37,979 --> 00:37:39,912
[seat belt clicks]

617
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:41,604
[sighs]
KEYS?

618
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:43,778
- I DON'T MIND DRIVING.

619
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:45,470
- I'M DRIVING. KEYS.

620
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:55,687
[engine starts]

621
00:37:58,897 --> 00:38:01,106
- YOU USED TO BE
SUCH A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.

622
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,005
- I'M NOT A LITTLE GIRL
ANYMORE.

623
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,938
- AND YOU'RE NOT HAPPY EITHER.

624
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:07,664
- I'M FINE.

625
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:11,358
- YOU AND YOUR SISTER
ARE SO DIFFERENT.

626
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:14,015
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
WE CAME FROM THE SAME PLACE.

627
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,845
- I JUST KNEW YOU WERE GOING
TO GET INTO TROUBLE

628
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,364
ONE OF THESE DAYS.

629
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:19,883
YOU WERE ALWAYS OUT
ALL NIGHT LONG.

630
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:22,369
- [scoffs] I WAS A TEENAGER
HAVING FUN.

631
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:26,027
- I REMEMBER ONE CHARACTERWITH LONG HAIR DOWN HIS BACK,

632
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:28,547
AND HE'D COME AROUND
ON A MOTORCYCLE.

633
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:30,031
- [laughs] OH, YEAH,
WELL HE'S A STOCKBROKER NOW.

634
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:31,895
ARE YOU HAPPY?

635
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:35,036
I'M SORRY I'M SUCH
A DISAPPOINTMENT TO YOU.

636
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:36,659
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

637
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:37,901
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

638
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:39,662
NOTHING'S EVER GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU.

639
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:42,527
- CAN'T WE HAVE AN AGREEABLE
THANKSGIVING FOR ONCE

640
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:44,977
AND NOT DREDGE UP
A LOT OF UNPLEASANT THINGS?

641
00:38:45,012 --> 00:38:48,049
- WHY NOT?

642
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:51,674
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT
FOR YEARS.

643
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,469
[door unlocks]

644
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:56,161
- I MADE A LIST OF THINGS
WE NEED FOR THANKSGIVING.

645
00:38:56,195 --> 00:38:58,715
YOU AND VALETTA CAN GO
TO THE STORE FOR ME.

646
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,062
- FINE.

647
00:39:01,097 --> 00:39:03,375
- [sighs]
I'M DONE IN.

648
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,928
- YOU WANT SOME TEA?

649
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:07,931
- OH, THANK YOU, BILLY.
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

650
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:14,075
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE NEED HERE.

651
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,940
[tea trickling]

652
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:20,012
- HOW WAS HENRY?

653
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:22,187
- OH, HE'S AN ANGEL.
HE'S SLEEPING.

654
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:25,742
- OK, IF THEY HAVE
ANY FRESH CRANBERRIES,

655
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:27,019
GET THOSE FOR ME.

656
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:30,782
- OK. SEE YOU LATER.

657
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,100
- SOMETIMES BRITT
AND I ARE JUST--

658
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:42,414
- SHE'S FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET
THAN YOU AND VALETTA.

659
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:46,004
- DO I HOLD HER TO
SOME UNREASONABLE STANDARD?

660
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:49,628
- WELL, YOU SURE HAVE BEEN
TOUGH ON HER.

661
00:39:49,663 --> 00:39:52,562
AND WITH THAT OTHER THING
HANGING OVER YOU,

662
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:56,635
YOU NEED TO WORK THINGS OUTWITH HER BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

663
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,743
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU
GOING TO IGNORE THE TRUTH

664
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:02,054
AND ADMIT THAT WE HAVE
A PROBLEM.

665
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:04,954
- WE?

666
00:40:06,127 --> 00:40:10,062
WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
I DO.

667
00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:14,066
- LISTEN, MAGS,

668
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:18,485
WE'VE MADE OUR PEACE,
YOU AND I, RIGHT?

669
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:22,661
AND IF TWO OLD BAGS LIKE US
CAN GET ALONG,

670
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:25,802
YOU CAN FIND A WAYTO GET ALONG WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

671
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:28,495
SHE'S A GREAT KID.
SHE'S A GOOD MOTHER.

672
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:31,187
- I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU WERE
OFF-CENTER.

673
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,810
I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY YOU TWOHIT IT OFF FROM THE BEGINNING.

674
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:36,088
- I'M OFF-CENTER?

675
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:39,229
WELL, ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?

676
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:41,128
- [laughs]

677
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,235
- YAMS. WE NEED YAMS.

678
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:49,688
- THERE. RIGHT THERE.
I'LL GET IT.

679
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:53,520
- I CAN'T READ HER HANDWRITING.
OH, CRANBERRIES.

680
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:55,798
THERE WE ARE.

681
00:40:55,832 --> 00:40:59,871
OH, THEY DON'T LOOK
VERY GOOD, DO THEY?

682
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:05,704
- I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT MAGGIE.

683
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:08,500
SHE HAD A LITTLE EPISODE
AT THE DRESS SHOP THIS MORNING.

684
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:09,881
- WHAT HAPPENED?

685
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:18,061
- SHE WAS TALKING,
AND THEN SHE JUST WENT BLANK

686
00:41:18,096 --> 00:41:21,202
AND FORGOT WHAT SHE WAS SAYING.

687
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:22,963
THIS IS BORDERLINE ALZHEIMER'S.

688
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,516
DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD
TALK TO A DOCTOR ABOUT THIS?

689
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:27,139
- YOU KNOW HER.
SHE HATES DOCTORS.

690
00:41:27,174 --> 00:41:28,865
LOOK, WE ALREADY
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

691
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,142
SHE'S OLD.

692
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,075
OLD PEOPLE HAVE LAPSES

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

897
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:04,862
- WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO GET HER ATTENTION?

898
00:54:07,934 --> 00:54:10,833
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
I HATE HER.

899
00:54:10,868 --> 00:54:13,595

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

905
00:54:37,964 --> 00:54:41,795

- [sighs]

939
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:56,015
THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT
I HAVE...

- YOU KEPT ME OUT OF YOUR LIFE.

951
00:59:37,056 --> 00:59:40,162
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HURT ME MOST OF ALL?

952
00:59:40,197 --> 00:59:43,027
YOU DIDN'T TELL
YOUR OWN MOTHER

953
00:59:43,062 --> 00:59:45,064
THAT YOU WERE HAVING A BABY.

954
00:59:45,098 --> 00:59:47,066

- I COULDN'T BREATHE.

WAS YOUR APPROVAL.

964
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:31,144

972
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:02,728
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF YOU LOVE ME.

973
01:01:02,762 --> 01:01:05,075
- [gasps]

974
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:07,940
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

975
01:01:07,974 --> 01:01:12,151
- MY WHOLE LIFE...

- IN A YEAR OR SO,

980
01:01:27,131 --> 01:01:29,271
I WON'T RECOGNIZE HENRY,

981
01:01:29,306 --> 01:01:34,276
AND HE WON'T KNOW ME.

982
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:37,107
I JUST THOUGHT THAT
DISTANCE WAS THE BEST SOLUTION.

983
01:01:39,903 --> 01:01:42,975
I'M SCARED.

984
01:01:43,009 --> 01:01:45,840
I'M SO SCARED.

01:02:07,033 --> 01:02:09,208
YOU'RE HIS GRANDMOTHER.

ON THANKSGIVING,

1003
01:03:01,329 --> 01:03:03,814
