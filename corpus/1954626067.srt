1
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,030
Hello.

2
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,230
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to talk to you today.

3
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,547
My name is Mark Schultz.

4
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,943
I wanna talk about America...

5
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,191
and I wanna tell you why I wrestle.

6
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,585
This is an Olympic gold medal.

7
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,700
I won this three years ago...

8
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,746
at the 23rd Olympic Games
in Los Angeles, California.

9
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,021
This is more than just
some piece of metal.

10
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,430
It's about what the metal represents.

11
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,828
The virtues it requires to attain it.

12
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,020
Twenty dollars and zero cents.

13
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,300
Is it Dave or David?

14
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,340
No, it's Mark.

15
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,304
Mark Schultz.

16
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,742
Yeah. Dave's my brother.

17
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,229
He was originally scheduled.

18
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,945
Okay.

19
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,108
We both won golds.

20
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,586
Make it the works, and coffee.

21
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,500
- For here?
- Yes.

22
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,146
Number two, number three, here.

23
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,500
Please come, coach.

24
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,340
We don't want to put any pressure
on you right now.

25
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,580
- You gotta think it through and all that.
- No, I get it. I appreciate it.

26
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,700
That's why I didn't wrestle him.

27
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,744
- But didn't you miss that match?
- I missed that match.

28
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,346
Hey, Mark!

29
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,860
You know the guys from U.S.A. Wrestling.

30
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,381
- Mark, how's it going?
- Fred, Bruce, Greg.

31
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,030
Hey, Mark.

32
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,540
- Well, all right.
- All right.

33
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,540
- Just give us a call.
- Appreciate it, Bruce.

34
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,380
- Thanks for coming all this way. Okay.
- All right.

35
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,504
- Hey, have a good workout.
- Thank you.

36
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,789
Hey, buddy.

37
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,346
You all right?

38
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,660
Hey, you been calling my machine
and hanging up?

39
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,140
What? Come on.

40
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,700
- What do you mean?
- Somebody's leaving hang-ups...

41
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,062
- ...on my machine.
- Come on.

42
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,385
Come on.

43
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,784
How you doing, buddy? You all right?

44
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,909
Okay.

45
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,261
Mark. Come on.

46
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,591
Keep your hips in.

47
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,308
Keep your hips in, Mark.

48
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,389
- Same time tomorrow?
- Yeah.

49
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,311
What'd the U.S.A. Wrestling guys want?

50
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,304
We're talking about me
doing some coaching.

51
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,704
In Colorado.

52
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,629
Hey. Give me a hug.

53
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,220
Hello?

54
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,866
Hello. May I speak with Mark Schultz?

55
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,504
Speaking.

56
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,221
Mark Schultz, the Olympic wrestler?

57
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,620
Yeah. Who is this?

58
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,380
I'm calling on behalf
of Mr. John E. du Pont.

59
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,060
He has been anxious
to get in touch with you.

60
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,788
- Who?
- John E. du Pont of the du Pont family.

61
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,620
Mr. du Pont asked that you consider
taking a day off...

62
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,940
to come out to Foxcatcher Farms...

63
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,780
so you men can meet face-to-face.

64
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,744
About what?

65
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,460
He'd like to discuss it in person
in Pennsylvania.

66
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,180
If I may, I'd like to make travel
arrangements for you, Mr. Schultz.

67
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,269
First class, of course.

68
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,140
Who'd you say again?

69
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,709
John E. du Pont, of the du Pont family.

70
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,661
Welcome to Philadelphia
International Airport.

71
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,900
Mark, Mr. du Pont wanted
to fly you himself today.

72
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,105
But last minute, he got called in by
the Newtown Square Police Department.

73
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,428
For tactical support.

74
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,264
He should be back at the estate
by the time we get there.

75
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,630
By the way,
that's Valley Forge below you.

76
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,703
This is the library.

77
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,100
Mr. du Pont should be here
in a few minutes.

78
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,426
Okay.

79
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,144
Mark.

80
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,863
John du Pont.

81
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,860
Thrilled. Thrilled that you're here.

82
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,221
Let's go downstairs.

83
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,260
We call this the trophy room,
for obvious reasons.

84
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,030
Have a seat.

85
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,420
How was your flight?

86
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,900
- It was good.
- Good.

87
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,545
Thank you.

88
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,940
Can I get you something to eat or drink?

89
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,900
Oh, no. No, I'm good. Thank you.

90
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,380
I could have them whip you up something.

91
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,100
No, sir, I'm fine.

92
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,790
Good.

93
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,660
Well, I know how busy you must be.

94
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,540
- I assume you're training for the Worlds?
- Yes, sir.

95
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,340
Good.

96
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,349
It's a big one.

97
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,984
How is training?

98
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,860
It's good.

99
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,550
It's intense.

100
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,029
We're in two-a-days.

101
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,260
Conditioning and weights
in the morning...

102
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,420
and technique...

103
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,380
We wrestle in the evenings.

104
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,780
That's good. Get yourself prepared.

105
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,789
Work hard.

106
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,186
You look good. You look strong.

107
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,180
- Fit.
- Thank you, sir.

108
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,303
Feeling confident?

109
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,860
That's one of the most important
elements of entering a match...

110
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,300
is feeling the confidence,
knowing that you're going to win.

111
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,548
Feeling it inside.

112
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,780
If you go to a match knowing
that you're going to win that match...

113
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,268
odds are,
you're going to win that match.

114
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,660
You're training with your brother Dave?

115
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,060
- Yes, sir.
- Great Dave Schultz?

116
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,627
- Yeah.
- I'm talking to the great Mark Schultz.

117
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,100
Do you have any idea
why I asked you to come here?

118
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,740
- No.
- No.

119
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,980
Well, Mark, do you...?

120
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,581
Do you have any idea who I am?

121
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,820
No. No.

122
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,866
Some rich guy calls you on the phone.

123
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,747
"I want Mark Schultz to come visit me."

124
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,023
Well, I'm a... I'm a wrestling coach.

125
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,626
And I have a deep love
of the sport of wrestling.

126
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,900
And I wanted to speak with you
about your future.

127
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,831
About what you hope to achieve.

128
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,666
What do you hope to achieve, Mark?

129
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,421
Well, I wanna be the best in the world.

130
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,227
I wanna go to Worlds and win gold.

131
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,907
I wanna go to the '88 Olympics
in Seoul and win gold.

132
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,620
Good.

133
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,743
I'm proud of you.

134
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,186
Are you getting the support
that you need?

135
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,824
What do you mean, sir?

136
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,904
Well, you know how the Soviets
support their wrestlers.

137
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,780
I do.

138
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,383
Mark, we as a nation
have failed to honor you.

139
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,663
And that's a problem.

140
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,351
Not just for you, but for our society.

141
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,590
When we fail to honor that
which should be honored...

142
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,028
it's a problem.

143
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,306
It's a canary in a coal mine.

144
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,469
Do you bird-watch?

145
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,900
- No.
- You can learn a lot from birds.

146
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,500
I'm an ornithologist.

147
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,670
But more importantly, I am a patriot.

148
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,941
And I want to see
this country soar again.

149
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,188
I want that too.

150
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,669
I can see that.

151
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,504
I'd like us to go to Seoul,
stun the world.

152
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,383
What do you think?

153
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,864
Three thousand men died here.

154
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,830
These patriots were willing
to give up everything...

155
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,541
including their lives...

156
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,229
for freedom.

157
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,269
I like to come here
to remind myself what really matters.

158
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,306
We're going to do great things, Mark.

159
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,823
Great things.

160
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,790
Yes, sir.

161
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,580
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey.

162
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,386
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Hey, Mark. Yeah.

163
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,580
- Can I talk to him?
- Go on.

164
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,181
Here! Do something.

165
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,580
The country has lost their morals
and values, and the kids are lost...

166
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,780
and they don't have role models,
and I agreed with him.

167
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,420
Everything he was saying.

168
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,989
I couldn't believe he was saying stuff
that I... It was in my head all the time.

169
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,980
Did you guys talk...?
Did you talk money?

170
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,860
- Yeah, yeah.
- What's he talking?

171
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,180
- You ready?
- Yeah.

172
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,907
Twenty-five thousand a year.

173
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,900
He said, "Name your price"...

174
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,620
and I just said the highest price
in my head.

175
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,983
And we get to handpick our team.

176
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,420
Who are you gonna train with?

177
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,420
No. No, we're...

178
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,103
I meant "we" as in me and you,
together, picking a team.

179
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,068
Mr. du Pont and I
would love to have you.

180
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,783
Mark, what's...?

181
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,900
What's he get out of all this?

182
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,100
- Mr. du Pont?
- Yeah.

183
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,667
America winning.

184
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,100
You winning. We talked about you.

185
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,029
Me winning.

186
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,260
- Okay.
- What are you thinking about, Dave?

187
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,905
This is it.

188
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,824
This is everything that we've...
That we've ever wanted.

189
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,261
Mark, I can't leave.

190
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,220
I'm settled here.

191
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,580
Nancy's happy.

192
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,306
Xander's doing well at school.

193
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,300
They can come.

194
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,700
Mark...

195
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,029
I got a contract, I got commitments.

196
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,024
That's great for you.

197
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,902
I should just pass this up
to be your training partner?

198
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,660
Mark. Mark.

199
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,340
This could be a real good thing for you.

200
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,668
I'm proud of you.

201
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,947
I think you can make something
real good for yourself here.

202
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,670
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

203
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,022
I love you, Mark.

204
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,180
Hi. Is Mr. du Pont home?

205
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,900
Is Mr. du Pont expecting you?

206
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,545
Yes, ma'am.

207
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,584
Not at this exact moment,
but, you know, this week sometime.

208
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,821
I'm Mark Schultz.

209
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,140
Have a seat here, for a moment.

210
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,911
I need to...

211
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,060
Do you have a commode?

212
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,780
Or, like, a washroom
or something I could use?

213
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,711
- Just in there to the left.
- Thank you.

214
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,620
Mr. Beck will see you now.

215
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,585
I'm... I'm sorry. Who?

216
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,980
All right. How old are you, Mark?

217
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,300
Twenty-seven.

218
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,580
Education?

219
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,820
University of Oklahoma.

220
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,900
Undergraduate?

221
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,546
- And you graduated?
- Yes, sir.

222
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,900
Do you own any property, Mark?

223
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,545
No.

224
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,660
Are your parents still together?

225
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,180
No.

226
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,906
How old were you when they separated?

227
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,191
Two.

228
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,589
Who raised you?

229
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,860
Well, we moved around a lot.

230
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,711
But my brother, mainly.

231
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,710
Okay.

232
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,540
Mark, have you ever been accused
of a crime?

233
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,340
No, sir.

234
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,860
I...

235
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,220
- Mr. du Pont.
- Oh, you're here.

236
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,184
Yes, I drove straight down.

237
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,342
Tonight's speech.

238
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,302
Okay.

239
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,660
So they're putting him in the chalet?

240
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,385
Yes, sir.

241
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,861
Excellent bed.

242
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,422
Good mattress. Firm.

243
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,580
- That's great. Thank you.
- All right.

244
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,066
Good.

245
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,740
Utilities are paid for,
gas, electric, water.

246
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,660
Kitchen, dining room.
Refrigerator is fully stocked.

247
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,669
Office.

248
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,620
Here's a key for you.

249
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,470
Thank you.

250
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,620
The gym is close. You can almost see it.

251
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,180
Couple hundred yards up
is the big house...

252
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,540
in case you ever get invited to dinner.

253
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,460
- Otherwise, it is off-limits.
- Okay.

254
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,143
Also, the horses that
you saw on the way in...

255
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,347
they all belong to Mr. du Pont's mother.

256
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,900
They're all world-class animals.

257
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,102
They're also off-limits.

258
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,468
Your history of the du Pont dynasty.

259
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,980
One more thing:

260
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,342
Just between you and me...

261
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,708
if you happen to see Mrs. du Pont,
just give her her privacy.

262
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,862
Yeah, of course.

263
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,420
Anything else I can get you?

264
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,146
No. No, no, I'm fine.

265
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,863
Well, I think that's it.

266
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,704
Have a good night.

267
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,110
You too.

268
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,108
Du Pont, a dynasty of wealth and power.

269
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,060
America's need for ammunition...

270
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,980
enabled the family to amass a fortune...

271
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,706
and grow their company
into what is today...

272
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,667
the largest chemical corporation
in the world.

273
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,024
Mr. du Pont?

274
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,390
Do you hear that?

275
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,743
That's a barred owl.

276
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,060
- I hope it's not too late.
- No, no, no.

277
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,025
I wanted to make sure
that everything was all right.

278
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,140
That everything was fine. Drop a few
things off that I thought you might enjoy.

279
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,547
Here are some field glasses.

280
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,580
There are many varieties of birds
right here on the property.

281
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,060
- That'll give you a better vantage point.
- Okay.

282
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,300
And this is from 10 years ago,
but I thought you might find it interesting.

283
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,344
- Wait, you wrote this?
- I did, yeah.

284
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,185
Thank you.

285
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,226
How long do we have till the Worlds?

286
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,541
Two months.
Well, a little less, actually.

287
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,784
Well, we'll get it done.

288
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,026
I promise you,
I'll give you everything I have.

289
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,061
I have great faith in you, Mark.

290
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,540
Thank you, sir.

291
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,424
You're welcome.

292
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,300
Night.

293
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,220
Certainly Abraham Lincoln,
Teddy Roosevelt...

294
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,060
they gave me something to aspire to.

295
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,580
My father was a role model.

296
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,703
Guys, introduce yourself.

297
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,231
See you guys at 6? All right.

298
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,140
Very good, I'll see you in three months.

299
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,546
Good.

300
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,310
Mark.

301
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,709
Come in.

302
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,269
Have a seat.

303
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,980
May I get you a drink?

304
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,260
No. No, sir. I'm good.

305
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,670
Good. Good man. In training.

306
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,664
How is it looking
with your brother Dave?

307
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,785
Dave?

308
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,020
How do you mean?

309
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,985
You said you were going
to talk to him again.

310
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,420
I did.

311
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,622
When is he coming?

312
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,024
He's not.

313
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,104
He... He's just not...

314
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,501
He's just not willing
to uproot his family.

315
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,910
Does he understand
what we're doing here, Mark?

316
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,630
I told him.

317
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,861
He just really doesn't wanna move.

318
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,148
How much does he want?

319
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,100
No, it's...

320
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,382
It's not about that.

321
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,704
About what?

322
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,110
Well, you can't buy Dave.

323
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,300
So the World Championships
are coming up soon?

324
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,150
Yes, sir.

325
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,428
I want you to win.

326
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,349
That's why you're here.

327
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,981
Everything okay, Mark?

328
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,665
Yeah.

329
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,740
What is it?

330
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,669
What's wrong?

331
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,710
Nothing. I'm... I'm fine.

332
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,863
No, you're not.

333
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,785
I just...

334
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,781
I just don't wanna let you down.

335
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,942
Do it! Go!

336
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,186
That's it.

337
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,140
Attack! Attack! Control his rolling.
Control his rolling.

338
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,502
Keep your elbows in!

339
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,270
Mark Schultz.

340
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,390
Good job, Mark.

341
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,304
Dave Schultz.

342
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,900
- Hello.
- Hey, Xander.

343
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,300
- Hi.
- Where's your dad?

344
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,060
Over there. Hello.

345
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,989
Hey, Mark. Come on in, buddy.

346
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,025
Oh, God, he's got me.

347
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,742
Dave, I wanted to...
I want you to meet Mr. du Pont.

348
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,540
Hold on a sec.
We got a guest. I gotta get up.

349
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,140
- How you doing? I have to say hi.
- Keep him...

350
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,580
No. We're not letting you up.

351
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,940
I wanna say hi to Mr. du Pont. Hold on.

352
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,700
- How you doing?
- Dad, come on.

353
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,060
- It's nice to meet you. Dave Schultz.
- John du Pont.

354
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,945
- That's my wife, Nancy.
- Hey.

355
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,980
- Hello.
- These are my beautiful, relaxed children.

356
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,860
- This is Xander and Dani.
- Hello.

357
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,664
- Hi.
- They're eating me.

358
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,460
Hey, Dani? Dani, come here.

359
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,220
- Can I get you a drink or something?
- No. No, I should go.

360
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,140
Good luck tomorrow.

361
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,342
Mark, thank you.

362
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,260
- You sure you don't want to...?
- No, no.

363
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,300
- No, Mark, stay.
- I'm gonna get you.

364
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,343
Come here. Get your brother.

365
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,260
- Hey. Okay. It's bedtime now.
- I can make an A.

366
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,666
- No!
- Let's go.

367
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,500
- Here it comes.
- Get ready for bed.

368
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,660
- Dave, I got that tape on Nanev.
- Yeah, pop it in, buddy.

369
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,500
- We need to check out his arm spin.
- We're gonna watch some wrestling.

370
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,180
Get your arm up.
Get your arms out of there.

371
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,664
There we go.

372
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,140
- Hurry up. Let me go!
- I'll have to keep you here.

373
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,380
- No.
- Let me get these tights off.

374
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,380
- Good princess.
- Okay, get...

375
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,789
Was it too much for you to come over
and just say hi to him?

376
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,300
- Aren't they fun?
- Excuse me?

377
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,867
You know who that is? It's John du Pont.

378
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,180
- I said hi, Mark.
- It's John du Pont.

379
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,100
The most generous man in America.
You can't treat him like he's anyone.

380
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,900
- Mark, she said hi.
- Mark, I said hi, okay?

381
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,420
- She said hi.
- You said hi from over there.

382
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,780
Buddy. Mark.

383
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,660
- She said hi, pal.
- Mark.

384
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,820
- You're in our room.
- I'm in your room? Okay. All right.

385
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,220
Great. You know what?
You don't even know.

386
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,260
You don't even know
what you don't know. You know that?

387
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,540
- Dave?
- Dad.

388
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,060
- Mark.
- Why? Dad.

389
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,780
- No.
- Yes.

390
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,460
- Dad.
- Buddy.

391
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,025
Mark.

392
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,590
Buddy. Come here.

393
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,510
Come here.

394
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,060
Give me the tape. Okay.

395
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:40,100
Nanev can't set up his arm spin
without setting up himself.

396
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,146
You just hit yours first.
When you feel him drive, hit it.

397
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,980
All right?

398
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,865
He's gonna drive and turn you and...

399
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,110
There it is.

400
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,740
That's it. Drive him out. Drive him out.

401
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,340
Drive him.

402
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,622
Drive, drive.

403
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,708
Elbows deep, Mark. Drive.

404
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,906
Five seconds, Mark!

405
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,300
Drive him. That's it.

406
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,185
Drive him, drive him, drive him.
Pop him up.

407
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,220
Yeah!

408
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,020
That's it, buddy.

409
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,746
Yeah! Yeah!

410
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,101
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

411
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,591
Oh, there we go.

412
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,743
Who needs a refill?

413
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,580
Let's all get very drunk.

414
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,464
- Mark, can I take a look at your medal?
- Yeah. Yeah.

415
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,621
What a fantastic evening.

416
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,705
All right. All right.

417
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,420
Enough. Enough!

418
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,145
Turn that off.

419
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,184
Take that down.

420
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,420
- Where do you want me to put it?
- I don't care.

421
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,100
Throw it away.

422
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,109
All of it, whole shelf.

423
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,301
Horses are stupid.

424
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,621
Horses eat and shit.

425
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,223
That's all they do.

426
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,702
It's very silly.

427
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,227
It's all very silly.

428
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,508
I love my mother very much, but she...

429
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,109
It's ridiculous.

430
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,903
Sitting on an animal was more dignified.

431
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,463
But I wanted to do what you're doing.

432
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,543
Let's have those medals.

433
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,264
Give me those.

434
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,300
Give me those medals.

435
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,301
I do not share my mother's
affection for horseflesh...

436
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,029
I'll have you know.

437
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,146
"Did your horse jump over the thing?"

438
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,946
"Did you catch the fox, Mother?"

439
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,910
Anyway...

440
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,381
the proof is in the pudding.

441
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,660
We caught the fox, didn't we?

442
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,100
- Yeah.
- This is the fox.

443
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,870
Yes, sir.

444
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,986
I am going to put these in there.

445
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,700
Gentlemen, I give you Mark Schultz...

446
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,860
Foxcatcher world champion. Yes.

447
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,550
Good.

448
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,180
Whoa, whoa, coach.

449
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,340
- You all right?
- Get him up.

450
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,623
- Coach, you all right?
- I think he had too much to drink.

451
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,180
- Drive! Drive!
- Drive, drive!

452
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,380
- Get on his other side.
- Get on him.

453
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,940
- Push him.
- Come on. You got him.

454
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,660
- What?
- The jig's up.

455
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,865
- Climb up on him. Come on. Come on.
- Work him, work him, work him!

456
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,865
Yes!

457
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,300
Don't let him drive you, Dan.
Don't let him drive you.

458
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,620
Turn him. Come on, turn him. That's it.

459
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,666
- You gotta turn him. Yes!
- Turn him. Turn him.

460
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,820
Yes!

461
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,860
- John!
- Johnny D!

462
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,220
John! John! John!

463
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,867
- John! John! John!
- Yeah!

464
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,823
- Yo, Johnny D!
- Yeah, Johnny D!

465
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,706
Yeah!

466
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,710
Mark.

467
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,260
After practice, I want you to shower
and come talk to me, all right?

468
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,224
Yeah. All right.

469
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,583
Three hundred eighty-seven days
to Seoul, gentlemen.

470
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,347
Let's have a good practice, shall we?

471
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,620
- You don't have to do this.
- You earned it.

472
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,220
You've given me enough.
This is not necessary.

473
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,185
Mark, Mark, you earned that.

474
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,182
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Mark.

475
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,822
You're more than Dave Schultz's
little brother, Mark.

476
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,425
Okay.

477
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,820
Dave Schultz is a wonderful wrestler.

478
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,500
He, I'm sure,
has been an inspiration to you.

479
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,226
A mentor to you.

480
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,380
But he will always be
your older brother.

481
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,981
He will never let you...

482
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,231
be everything that you can be.

483
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:42,461
Mark, you have been living
in your brother's shadow your entire life.

484
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,661
It's time. It's your time now.

485
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,028
I know what you mean.

486
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,504
Do you?

487
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,106
Because everything that I've done...

488
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,109
I feel like...

489
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,349
has somehow been credited to Dave.

490
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,947
And, you know, I feel that...

491
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,948
it's time for me to...

492
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,466
distance myself from him.

493
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,587
You know, become my own person.

494
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,262
Without your brother...

495
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,064
you can do anything that you
choose to set your mind to.

496
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,700
Mr. du Pont,
I need you to know that I'm...

497
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,780
I'm so grateful
for what you've done for me.

498
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,140
Well, first of all...

499
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,420
I don't want you to call me
"Mr. du Pont" or "sir" anymore.

500
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,780
I consider us friends.

501
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,544
And most of my friends
will call me "Eagle" or "Golden Eagle."

502
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,260
So either of those will work.

503
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,144
Okay.

504
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,945
Or "John" or "Coach."

505
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,380
All right. That's not a problem.

506
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,070
Good.

507
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,222
Good afternoon, sir.

508
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,100
- M113, sir. APC.
- I know what it is.

509
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,180
Where's the gun?

510
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,223
What gun, sir?

511
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,220
- Fifty-caliber machine gun.
- Sir, there wasn't a machine gun ordered.

512
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,344
It's supposed to be mounted right there.

513
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,987
There's no gun on the order, sir.

514
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,023
Sir, I just need a signature
to complete the order.

515
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,063
Get my gun.

516
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,220
Reed, McClaren, let's off-load.

517
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,580
It's supposed to come
with a .50-caliber machine gun.

518
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,350
We'll get it.

519
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,180
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

520
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,747
Let's get something to eat.

521
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,900
You snap him down.

522
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,060
He'll posture up, that's your window.

523
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,547
Shoot in and pull him over the top.

524
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,020
Excellent.

525
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,710
One more.

526
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,820
Great.

527
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,340
The oil looks really good on you, Mark.

528
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,749
Bow your arms a little bit. Here we go.

529
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,910
Excellent.

530
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,630
Very good, and all right.
Very good, Mark.

531
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,860
Your speeches, your kit.

532
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,580
Do we know if my mother
has already arrived?

533
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,589
She is en route, sir.

534
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,505
The blazer looks good.

535
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,181
Thank you, sir.

536
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,831
I wrote down a
few things for you to say.

537
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,551
Don't be nervous. You're gonna be great.

538
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,868
Read it. Read it out loud.

539
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,549
Okay. Right now?

540
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,586
- Get some practice.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,620
"Highly respected ornithologist...

- Philatelist.
- Philatelist.

- Stamps.
- Sta... Can we say "stamps"?

546
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,580
- No, philatelist.
- Philatelist.

547
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,260
Don't be intimidated by these people.

548
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,100
How many people are gonna be there?

549
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,223
About 400.

550
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,747
Go ahead.

551
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,310
- What is it?
- It's cocaine.

552
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,425
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

553
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,380
Mark, it's just cocaine.

554
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,947
It's not going to kill you.

555
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,382
What am I...?
You're supposed to just...?

556
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,340
Take the vial...

557
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,820
tap some on the mirror...

558
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,070
take the straw,
just inhale it through your nose.

01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,100

- All of it. Straight down.

564
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,740
Did you hear how I was doing it?

565
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,149
It's just all one thought, Mark.
You got it.

566
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,109
Give that to me.

567
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,990
Okay.

568

Ornithologist,

01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,820
Okay, ornilo... Ornithologist,
philatelist, philanthropist.

Ornithologist, philatelist,
philanthropist.

576

- Ornilo... Ornithologist, philatelist...
- Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

Ornilo... "Ornithogolist"...

- Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.
- Ornithologist...

579
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,540
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.
Look at me.

580
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,660
Ornithologist, philatelist,
philanthropist.

581
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,060
Again. Ornithologist,

Again. Ornithologist,
philatelist, philanthropist.

583
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,947
Good.

584
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,860
Do I know you?

585
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,260
- Yes, John. How are you?
- Good to see you again.

586
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,140
- This is Mark Schultz.
- Hi.

587
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,220
Have you ever met
an Olympic gold medalist before?

588
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,540
Mark won the Olympic gold medal
for wrestling in 1984.

589
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,820
Ever seen an Olympic medalist before?

590
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,784
No, I don't think I have.

591
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,580
Mark. Mark.

592
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,820
- This is Congressman Daniel.
- Nice to meet you.

593
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,300
- Bob.
- Congressman Daniel... Bob or Daniel?

594
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,260
- Bob, yes.
- Bob, nice to meet you.

595
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,620
This is Mark Schultz.

596
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,020
Mark won an Olympic gold medal
in the 1984 Olympics.

597
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,060
- Impressive.
- Isn't that impressive?

598
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,820
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

599
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,660
Quite a young man.

600
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,828
- Very proud of him.
- Nice meeting you.

601
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,660
I'm so proud to introduce my mentor.

602
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,626
He has the ability to look at me
and see where I am in life.

603
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,260
I feel his love for me as an athlete
and as a human being.

604
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,180
My mother and father were divorced
when I was 2...

605
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,980
and I spent a lifetime
looking for a father...

606
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,946
and I found one in the Golden Eagle
of America, John du Pont.

607
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,024
Mark Schultz. Thank you, son.

608
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,064
Hello, Mother.

609
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to read something.

610
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,140
"The liberties of our country...

611
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,620
the freedom of our civil constitution...

612
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,180
are worth defending at all hazards.

613
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,782
And it is our duty to defend them
against all attacks..."

614
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,905
- Oh, hey. Hey, what's up?
- I miss you.

615
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,940
- Yeah.
- What you up to?

616
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,063
What you up to?

617
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,460
Nothing. Nothing.

618
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,220
Are you working out? Getting ready?

619
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,780
Yeah... No. I mean, well, I'm taking
a little bit of a break right now.

620
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,140
Just resting up the body.
I'm gonna ramp it up, you know...

621
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,140
when it gets closer to World... Trials.

622
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,380
All right. How close?

623
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,300
- Hey, hold on. Hold on one second.
- What?

624
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,264
What's happening?

625
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,660
Hey!

626
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,180
Mark!

627
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,190
Gear up. Practice in the gallery.

628
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,030
You all right?

629
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,429
You are a good friend, Mark.

630
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,189
Thank you, John.

631
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:46,067
I only had one real friend growing up.

632
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,541
Hugh Cherry. Hughby.

633
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,549
He was the son of my mother's chauffeur.

634
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,380
When I was 16, I found out
that my mother had been paying him...

635
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,662
to be my friend.

636
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,468
Dave was my only friend growing up.

637
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,630
Yeah.

638
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,429
I thought we could put it
in the Rosemont case.

639
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,708
- It says John "Eagle" du Pont.
- That's right.

640
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,631
- First place?
- Yes.

641
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,908
You funded this.

642
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,504
Presumably.

643
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,140
You can put it in the trophy room.

644
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,149
Thank you, Mother.

645
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,820
What are we going to do
about your train set?

646
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,780
My train set?

647
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:24,980
Well, Mr. Beck spoke to you about this.

648
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,420
No.

649
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,060
Oh, I know he did.

650
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,944
I know he did.

651
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,140
You've never wanted
to give it away, but...

652
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,583
I don't care about my train set, Mother.
I don't care.

653
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,147
Well, I think We'll...

654
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,864
We'll give it to the children's museum,
if they have room.

655
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,220
Do you agree?

656
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,266
I don't care what you do
with the train set.

657
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,742
I don't care about trains.

658
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,820
Mother, I am leading men.

659
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,069
I am training them. I am teaching them.

660
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,388
I am giving them...

661
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,340
a dream.

662
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,140
And I am giving America...

663
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,990
hope.

664
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,310
Hope?

665
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,148
It doesn't matter.

666
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,420
I'm glad you have your trophy.

667
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,540
It can go in the trophy room.

668
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,186
Not in the Rosemont case.

669
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,866
I don't like the sport of wrestling,
as you know.

670
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,862
It's a low sport.

671
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:48,746
And I don't like to see you being low.

672
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,620
And quickly Herrera shoots the leg.

673
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,903
And Herrera's a very good grappler here.

674
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,740
Oh, my. Elbows in number,
by Goodridge...

675
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,540
and that is it.

676
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,266
Albert wrestled with this guy at Pitt.

677
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,460
I think it's sad.

678
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,900
He was legit.

679
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,100
He's probably getting paid a lot.

680
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,060
Look at his face.

681
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,740
- That was short and sweet.
- It's destroyed.

682
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,151
- It's John.
- It's John.

683
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,660
- Hey, coach.
- Is Mark in?

684
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,660
- Yeah.
- Right here, coach.

685
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,225
What's up?

686
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,467
Why is there nobody in the gym?

687
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,706
- What do you mean?
- It's noon. Nobody in there.

688
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:58,020
Yeah, no, I gave the boys the morning off.
We're gonna do a double tonight.

689
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,461
Who's making these decisions?

690
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,225
I am.

691
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,866
I want your brother Dave here.

692
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,180
What are you talking about?

693
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,428
I want your brother Dave to come.

694
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,940
That's not gonna happen.

695
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,302
We've talked about that.

696
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,384
Are you okay?

697
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,347
You ungrateful ape.

698
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,785
I made such a mistake bringing you here.

699
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,260
I'm getting Dave.

700
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,111
I don't care how much it costs.

701
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,584
Shit.

702
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,300
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

703
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,990
Yeah.

704
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,543
There he is. He's coming. He's coming.

705
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,791
- John du Pont.
- Yeah.

706
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,548
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

707
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,788
Hey.

708
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,300
How you doing?

709
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,901
Good. I'm good.

710
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,380
What's up?

711
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,140
I just... Just came in.
All the wrestlers were there to meet me...

712
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,500
and you weren't there,
and I just thought I'd come up...

713
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,540
make sure everything's okay.

714
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,947
No, I'm good.

715
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,500
Just concentrating.

716
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,782
We got trials coming up.

717
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,023
You okay, Mark?

718
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,620
Yeah. I'm good.

719
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,390
What's up?

720
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,822
You got my messages?

721
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,300
Nancy and the kids are here.

722
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,860
- Yeah? How are they?
- They're good.

723
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:20,066
- Why don't you come down and say hi.
- Okay. I will. I'll see you.

724
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,700
Boom, down low.

725
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,949
This hand comes here,
this hand catches the ankle.

726
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,980
Lay your back into the guy,
scoop with this leg, catch both knees...

727
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,540
put your arm through.
There's your cross ankle, all right?

728
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,220
Nice and tight.

729
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,860
Do it again, all right?

730
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,108
So you're here, you're wrestling.

731
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,506
If you get here
and you're loose like this...

732
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:57,580
to make it nice and tight, what you
wanna do is drive the knees together...

733
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:01,785
with your hip and your elbow,
and drop your arm down or drop your chest.

734
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,780
That'll make it nice and snug for you.

735
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,340
You wanna keep
your outside leg away from him.

736
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,420
Keep your leg away from him,
come up to your knee...

737
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:14,147
turn your toe to the ceiling,
step him up.

738
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,380
Let's say he does reel over
with that outside ankle...

739
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,380
that's pretty much game over.

740
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,584
I have a chance to make him
keep those feet...

741
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,460
So from here, you pull this up
and you drive that.

742
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,301
Outside shoulders from that,
and he pulls...

743
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,988
Use your stomach.

744
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,823
Use your stomach.

745
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,265
Good.

746
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,345
Good set.

747
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,826
All right, pair up.

748
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,985
Let's go, guys.

749
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,427
What's going on, Mark?

750
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:56,980
There's that knee pick he likes to hit
from a fake shot or cross...

751
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,071
Dave, I don't need your help.
I'm doing this on my own, okay?

752
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,983
- You don't want my help?
- Dave, what did I just say?!

753
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,263
Wanna tell me what's going on
with you and du Pont?

754
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,551
Okay.

755
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,820
Handstands.

756
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,546
Tuck and roll forward, boys.

757
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,307
Army crawl on this side.

758
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,384
Good.

759
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,549
Bring it in.

760
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,311
Move.

761
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,428
Right there. Make some room.

762
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,864
All the way over.

763
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,740
In three days...

764
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,260
several of you will be
traveling with me to Pensacola...

765
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,350
to participate in the Olympic trials.

766
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:20,504
When you leave the hallowed grounds
of this training facility...

767
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,468
you will be in competition.

768
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,466
You will be representing Foxcatcher.

769
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,710
You will be representing
the United States.

770
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,503
As a coach...

771
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:43,060
I want you to be champions in sport...

772
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,748
and winners in life.

773
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,069
And also...

774
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,666
to be good citizens...

775
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,145
for America.

776
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,064
Garcia.

777
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,068
A couple basics.

778
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:15,267
This is one that generally
works for me quite well.

779
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,749
Arm drag.

780
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,540
Right to left, left to right.

781
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,663
Rip it across.

782
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,229
And as I do that, you see this portion.

783
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,062
And I can move right in.

784
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,384
Again.

785
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,820
Right to left, left to right.

786
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,260
Rip it across.

787
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,303
And then in.

788
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,900
- Got it?
- Yeah.

789
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,671
- Do we have that?
- Yes.

790
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,983
All right, par terre.

791
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,705
Down. Actually, I'll go down.

792
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,060
- You do it.
- Okay.

793
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,500
Do it on me.

794
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,021
So get underneath my rib.

795
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,305
All right.

796
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,422
The basic physics is to keep yourself
wide at the bottom.

797
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,021
All right.

798
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,900
He puts his knee under my hip...

799
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,300
and you see an opening here.

800
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,831
So you shoot...

801
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,825
Let's pair up.

802
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,865
- Basics.
- All right.

803
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,380
All right, let's pair up
and work on arm drags.

804
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,380
Arm drags and gut wrenches.

805
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,423
All right, let's do it, guys.

806
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,020
Three days, three days.

807
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,666
Step forward.

808
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,300
All right, you got about a...
Looks like about a half a kilo to go.

809
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,020
- Step forward.
- Name, weight?

810
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,420
- Thirty.
- He's good.

811
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,380
- Next.
- Step forward.

812
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,460
- Name? Weight?
- Let's see.

813
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,100
That's about a half kilo to go.

814
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,620
- You're good.
- Next.

815
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,940
He's good.

816
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,820
Step forward. Name, weight?

817
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,060
Good. Next bastard's good.

818
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,340
Next.

819
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,580
Two kilos over.

820
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,540
- That looks good.
- You're good.

821
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,026
- Next.
- Step forward.

822
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:45,022
Next match:
Mark Schultz versus Rico Chiapparelli.

823
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,220
One, blue.

824
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,825
Best of three, Mark. You'll get it back.

825
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,905
Mark.

826
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:30,231
You're not in this alone, man.

827
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,461
I'm your brother and I love you.

828
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:39,622
I am not gonna let you
go down like this.

829
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,510
That's it.

830
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,668
There's more in there.

831
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,301
That's it, keep going, Mark.

832
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,780
Twelve pounds over.
How much time we got?

833
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,300
- Ninety minutes.
- Ninety minutes, okay.

834
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,423
Come on, there you go.

835
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,668
That's it, drive it.

836
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,100
Harder, Mark.

837
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,665
That's it. Time.

838
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,700
Okay. All right.

839
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:30,940
Five, four, three, two, one.

840
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,346
Time.

841
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,422
Three, two, one.

842
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,664
All right, buddy.

843
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,505
Go.

844
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,744
Circle.

845
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,428
Hold your position, Mark.

846
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,020
Ten seconds.

847
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,585
Hold your position.

848
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,905
All right. All right, Mark.

849
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,700
Sheets can't be on the team.

850
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,665
Mark Schultz is on the Olympic team.

851
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,544
Get in there, Mark, you hear me?

852
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,710
Okay, center red, center blue.

853
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,870
Yeah!

854
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,905
Two-thirty, Mark.

855
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,871
- Hey, Henry.
- Dave. What can I do for you?

856
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:48,340
Henry, John and I kind of had
an uncomfortable moment earlier...

857
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,180
and, you know,
I didn't see him at the finals.

858
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,780
- Was he even there?
- No.

859
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,950
Mr. du Pont flew home earlier today.

860
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,224
Okay.

861
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,267
Mr. du Pont's mother died.

862
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,824
Oh, man. That's really bad news.

863
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,991
- Excuse me, Dave.
- All right. Thank you.

864
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,380
Would you like us to mount the weapon?

865
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,786
- Yes.
- Gentlemen.

866
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,548
You and me, buddy.

867
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,831
How you doing? You sore?

868
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,146
There you go.

869
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,583
Open that stretch for me.

870
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,309
It's John.

871
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,149
Hey, John.

872
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:33,380
- I'm really sorry about your mother.
- Oh, no, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.

873
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,100
- You okay? You sure?
- Yes.

874
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:39,862
David, we have a lot of work to do
in the next couple of months.

875
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:44,260
And you're an integral part of that.
You understand?

876
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:47,060
- I understand.
- I'm going to need you.

877
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:50,940
And I will be relying on you...

878
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,100
- All right.
- ...to a great extent.

879
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:58,820
I want, more than anything,
to win a gold medal.

880
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:01,820
And we have someone
who could do that for us.

881
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,900
We're gonna win a gold medal, John.

882
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,580
- How are you feeling about that?
- I feel very good about it.

883
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:09,620
I am a little concerned...

884
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:14,223
that there are
some psychological issues...

885
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,620
that we need to take care of.

886
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:20,060
- He's gonna be in real good shape.
- You're doing a great job.

887
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:22,183
- Thank you, John.
- And I...

888
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:27,463
I think that with you and I,
working in tandem...

889
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:31,064
if we can't get him there, no one can.

890
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,540
All right. Get back.

891
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,230
Okay.

892
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,190
Mark?

893
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,430
Mark?

894
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,504
- You okay?
- Mark.

895
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:50,341
He's okay.

896
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,100
Come on, Mark.

897
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,790
Good.

898
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,140
Coach du Pont has a vision.

899
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,460
He would like Foxcatcher...

900
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,060
to be designated and recognized...

901
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,100
as the official training site...

902
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,667
for U.S.A. Wrestling
and the Olympic team.

903
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:43,780
Now, this means that the national team
would live here and train here.

904
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,620
On top of funding this program...

905
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:51,700
Coach du Pont would be willing
to make a donation to U.S.A. Wrestling...

906
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,780
of $500,000 per year.

907
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,300
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah, that's really nice.

908
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:59,860
Mr. du Pont, thank you very much for...

909
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,664
The spirit of Foxcatcher.

910
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:07,505
It is a philosophy
which began generations ago.

911
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:12,863
- Thank you.
- It is more than just sport.

912
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:21,100
And coaching these young athletes...

913
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:27,148
I am able to instill in them the lessons
that I have learned in life.

914
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:32,750
Athletes need role models.

915
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:38,109
Like anyone,
they need people to look up to.

916
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,789
A coach is a father.

917
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:46,266
A coach is a mentor.

918
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:53,624
A coach has great power...

919
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:00,343
great import on an athlete's life.

920
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:05,060
We'll put you in a house
with another wrestler.

921
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:07,831
Gym's a hundred yards from it.

922
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,660
There's plenty of places
for the kids to run around.

923
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,540
Hey, Mark, I'll just be...

924
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,220
All right. I'll tell her you said hey.

925
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:21,710
I'm waiting to hear from you. Bye.

926
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,620
Hey, buddy.

927
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:28,060
- Hey.
- Warm up. I'll be out there in a minute.

928
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,980
- Yeah, I just...
- I gotta make one more call.

929
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,750
Look.

930
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,742
I don't wanna be here.

931
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,190
I called Coach Beacham at BYU.

932
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:47,227
He said he'd take both of us.

933
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:52,020
We don't got time to make
a big change like that.

934
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,382
Okay, what about after Seoul?

935
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,625
Mark...

936
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:01,340
Look, I don't know what's gonna
happen in the future...

937
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:05,020
but Nancy and I would like to try...

938
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:08,906
and make it work here.

939
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:14,709
You and I both know
that I can't stay here.

940
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,743
I know, Mark.

941
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,511
Hey, do you remember when we were kids?

942
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,107
You remember how we lived?

943
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,380
Moving all over the place?

944
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:46,180
Never had any idea where or how long
we were gonna be anywhere.

945
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,740
Remember how that was for us?

946
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,181
Was it easy for us?

947
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,625
No.

948
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,501
That's my responsibility
to my family, Mark.

949
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:04,220
I know you understand that.

950
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,151
Keep your head in the game, Mark.

951
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,984
Go on down.

952
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,580
Hi, Dave, I'm Doc.

953
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:36,100
- Doc, Dave Schultz.
- Nice to meet you.

954
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,985
Have a seat in the chair here,
if you would.

955
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:47,900
We're rolling. Let's talk a bit
about his philosophy as a coach.

956
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,391
What is his philosophy as the individual
that's gonna lead this team and you?

957
01:46:55,040 --> 01:47:01,671
Well, John's philosophy as a coach
is to let the wrestlers...

958
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,500
Sorry.

959
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:12,420
Is to create an environment...

960
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:18,060
where the athlete
doesn't have many obstacles...

961
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:22,345
to get past to be great.

962
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:26,500
- Let's get pointed here. I...
- I'm not doing what you want me to.

963
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:29,140
- Let's get pointed.
- What are you looking for?

964
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:31,460
You know what we're trying
to accomplish.

965
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:37,020
We're making a documentary that shows
John is gonna be able to lead this team...

966
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:41,350
lead you to levels of greatness
in wrestling we haven't seen before.

967
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:45,340
And talk about that, but use
some of those terms that he likes...

968
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,386
like "excellent" and "intensity"
and "domination."

969
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:53,504
All right.

970
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:57,102
Well, John du Pont...

971
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:02,662
Say that again? I'm sorry.
Can you ask me that question again?

972
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:07,940
John sees you as important to this.
You're the closing chapter to this thing.

973
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,900
You're the end of it,
and you're his assistant coach.

974
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,220
He sees himself as your mentor.

975
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:16,580
I would like you
to just look at the camera...

976
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:21,422
and speak about John...

977
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:23,900
as a mentor.

978
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,545
And say what exactly?

979
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,950
That he's your mentor.

980
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,509
Can you do that?

981
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,509
John du Pont...

982
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:48,700
is kind of a mentor to me.

983
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:55,830
Just look over here at the camera
and say it again.

984
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,465
John du Pont is a mentor to me.

985
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:22,386
I thought maybe it'd be a good idea
if we talked, kind of clear the air.

986
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,180
I wanna make sure you guys
are clear that we expect...

987
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:31,341
that Mr. du Pont is gonna be in Mark's
corner throughout the Olympic Games.

988
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:38,460
Well, we can ask him if that's okay,
but first...

989
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:42,020
I'd like to raise a few things
that are important to me.

990
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:45,463
One, if I'm gonna...

991
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:51,027
commit to staying on here
at Foxcatcher...

992
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:55,380
I need to know that Mark's
gonna be taken care of.

993
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:58,140
Well, taken care of how?

994
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:02,940
So long as I'm at Foxcatcher,
Mark's gonna get paid.

995
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,100
You want him to be paid
even if he's not here?

996
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,826
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

997
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:15,740
Dave, you may be overestimating
your importance to Foxcatcher.

998
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:19,500
Well, that may be so.

999
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:24,660
We could test that,
but I'm here to say, John...

1000
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:29,024
I wanna continue what we've
started here at Foxcatcher.

1001
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,510
And it's important to me...

1002
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:37,028
that I know that my brother
is gonna be supported.

1003
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:50,060
Thanks, John.

1004
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:54,420
Okay, you'll get your deal,
you'll get your demands...

1005
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:58,300
but this means that Mr. du Pont...

1006
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,420
is gonna be seated in Mark's corner
throughout the Olympic Games.

1007
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:06,830
I wanna hear Mark agree to that himself.

1008
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,471
Remember what we went over today, Mark.

1009
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:12,711
You can't do this to yourself, buddy.
You can't do this to yourself.

1010
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:16,030
You can beat this guy, Mark.
You can beat him.

1011
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:46,500
Can I help you?

1012
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:51,111
- Everything okay?
- Can I help you?

1013
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:54,060
- Yeah, we live here.
- Okay.

1014
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:57,901
There's a new security plan in place.
I'm gonna need to see some IDs.

1015
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,944
Sure.

1016
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:31,191
Hey, John, it's Sunday.
It's family time.

1017
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,188
- Morning, John.
- Say hi to John.

1018
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,504
Hi, John.

1019
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,709
It's Sunday.

1020
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:40,949
Every athlete, no matter
what sport, needs structure...

1021
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:43,420
needs direction...

1022
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,351
and this is something
that a coach can offer.

1023
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:51,340
As a coach,
I hope to develop young athletes...

1024
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:54,783
not only in body, but in mind.

1025
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:02,351
I want you to be champions
in sport and winners in life.

1026
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:07,185
And also, good citizens of America.

1027
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,340
You will be representing Foxcatcher.

1028
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,827
You will be representing
the United States.

1029
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,588
The coach is there...

1030
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:18,661
to help the athlete succeed...

1031
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:24,020
in all the ways that
that athlete should be able to succeed.

1032
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,700
And in doing so...

1033
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:30,986
that coach is able to create a champion.

1034
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:37,220
My athletes look to me
as a brother, a mentor...

1035
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:40,500
a father and a leader.

1036
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:42,980
I spent my lifetime
looking for a father...

1037
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:46,740
and I have found one in the
Golden Eagle of America...

1038
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,510
John du Pont.

1039
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:25,544
Wayne.

1040
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:31,540
Yes, sir?

1041
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:33,708
Is it snowing?

1042
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,149
No, it's not.

1043
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,628
Warm up my car.

1044
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:44,545
Yes, sir.

1045
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:29,740
Hey, John. What's happening? Hey, whoa!

1046
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,940
- No.
- Do you have a problem with me?

1047
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:34,984
- John. Don't, John!
- No, John, I don't have a problem.

1048
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:37,824
Hey, John...

1049
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:40,300
John, no!

1050
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,070
Stop, John. Stop!

1051
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:47,669
John, no!

1052
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:51,942
- Freeze! Drop the gun!
- Drop it now!

1053
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:24,985
Mark.

1054
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,145
You're up.

1055
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:38,980
He is a jujitsu fighter,
standing 6 feet, 2 inches tall...

1056
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:42,100
weighing 225 pounds.

1057
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,380
From Moscow, Russia...
