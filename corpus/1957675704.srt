[whooshing]
 [upbeat, strumming music]

8
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:52,146
- You're a fine looking girl.

9
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:53,665
I'd like to get your number
 and take you out to dinner,

10
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:57,462
and you know, a couple movies,
 you know, get your number?

11
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:59,084
Are you taken?

12
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:02,122
Ah, that's too bad, I'm
 single-- [conversation fades]

13
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:07,127
[cheerful, ambient music]
 [people chattering]

14
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,209
- Hey cowboy,

15
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:23,143
if I didn't know better,

16
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,661
I'd say you were becoming
 a regular around here.

17
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,837
- Well, taking a shine to
 your fine establishment.

18
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:28,838
- Yeah, that's nice.

19
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,080
Hey, usual?

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,151
- [McCoy] Yeah, what the hell.

21
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,013
- All right.

22
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:34,050
- Annie working tonight?

23
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,260
- [Bartender] Oh, that's
 what this is all about, huh?

24
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,400
- Well, when you're
only in town for a week,

25
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,955
you can't afford to be
 pussyfooting around, you know?

26
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,440
- No, you can't.

27
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,958
- [McCoy] You've got to
 make your feelings known.

28
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:46,787
- Yeah, you do.

29
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:49,169
- So is she?

30
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,722
- [Bartender] Is she?

31
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:52,275
- Working tonight?

32
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:53,966
- Yeah, I got her cleaning
 some bottles in the back.

33
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:54,760
She'll be out.

34
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,695
- [exhales] Good.

35
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:00,559
Why don't you go ahead and
 hit me again there, partner.

36
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,353
- You got it.

37
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:07,704
[door clatters]

38
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,120
- Guess who's back
 and asking about you.

39
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,747
- Let me guess,
 tall, dark and Texan?

40
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:17,956
- Mmhmm, over at the bar.

41
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:20,683
- Fourth night in a row,

42
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,685
he looks like the
 generous type too.

43
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,826
- Mm, what do you
 have to lose? [laughs]

44
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:27,517
- [laughs] Nothing
 at all, sister,

45
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,209
nothing at all.

46
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:34,904
[cheerful, ambient music]
 [people chattering]

47
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:36,457
Hey,

48
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:39,529
gonna hang at the bar all
 night or do you want a table?

49
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:40,772
- Well, what I'd really like

50
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:43,637
is a nice, quiet dinner
date with you, Annie.

51
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,364
- Well, I have Tuesday off.

52
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:49,574
- Mm, I'm afraid I'm gonna be

53
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:51,679
about a million miles
 away come Tuesday.

54
00:03:52,922 --> 00:03:54,406
- [sighs] That's too bad.

55
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,097
- Hm.

56
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,930
Yep. [sighs]

57
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,279
It's uh,

58
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:09,870
kinda slow in here tonight,

59
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:12,562
don't you think?

60
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:15,220
- Uh, yeah, damn slow.

61
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:18,775
Annie, why don't you uh,

62
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,915
take the rest of the
 night off if you want.

63
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:23,918
- Well?

64
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:25,334
- I want.

65
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:30,200
[people chattering]
 [cheerful, ambient music]

66
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:35,205
[distant siren wailing]

67
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:42,282
[glasses clink]
 [cheerful, ambient music]

68
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:47,010
- Annie, I'm usually
 not this forward,

69
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:51,567
but I'm just gonna be heading
 back out west tomorrow

70
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,086
and I didn't wanna
 miss the opportunity

71
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,365
to tell you how special
I think you are.

72
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,679
- You know, that's one
 of the sweetest things

73
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,991
anyone's ever said to me.

74
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:04,407
- Well, it's true.

75
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,793
- So, tell me a
 little about yourself.

76
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:14,279
- Well, my daddy got
 into the oil business,

77
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,763
back when I was a little boy,

78
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:20,527
and uh, we kinda made it
into a family business.

79
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:22,183
And that went right fine,

80
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:27,085
and I grew up a little bit
 and I had the idea that,

81
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,052
well, we needed to
 diversify a bit.

82
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,746
So, we got into the
 cattle business.

83
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:37,198
Well that went right fine,

84
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:38,959
'til the cattle drank the oil.

85
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,306
They all died.

86
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:45,655
So we're back in the
 oil business now.

87
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:52,179
We uh, went ahead and bought
up a town and things like that.

88
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:53,111
- Town?

89
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,321
- Yeah, I own a town.

90
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,358
- You own a whole town?

91
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,220
- Yeah.

92
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:01,671
- Wow.

93
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,641
[exhales] I've always dreamed
 about something like that.

94
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:09,403
- I'd sure like to get
 to know you better.

95
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,163
We have such little time.

96
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,374
- Well,

97
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:16,790
there's always tonight.

98
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:19,102
- Tonight?

99
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,555
- Yeah, my apartment's
 just down the street.

100
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:26,213
- Well I'd be right honored.

101
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,009
- Shall we?

102
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:29,803
- We shall.

103
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:36,223
[McCoy sighs]

104
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:44,611
[upbeat, rhythmic music]
[distant siren wailing]

105
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:57,140
[door rattles]

106
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:03,423
[Annie sighs]
 [keys clink]

107
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,735
- So, can I get you
 a drink or something?

108
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:07,219
- Uh, no thank you.

109
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,015
I'm thinking that we oughta
 just circle our wagons.

110
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:13,847
- You are in a
 hurry, aren't you?

111
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:15,538
[McCoy chuckles]

112
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,264
[Annie squeals]
[laughs]

113
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:19,231
R.J.! [laughing]

114
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,718
[upbeat, strumming music]

115
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:34,384
[heavy breathing]
 [upbeat, strumming music]

116
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:52,126
[people chattering]
[cheerful ambient music]

117
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:54,819
[phone ringing]

118
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:00,341
- Hello?

119
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:02,171
- So, how's it going?

120
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:06,347
- He's still here.

121
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:08,315
- Hm, brought him
 to your place, huh?

122
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,112
Were you very
 naughty? [chuckles]

123
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:15,149
- Yeah, I really
knocked him out.

124
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:16,565
- [Stacy] Is he staying over?

125
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:19,395
- He is out like a light.

126
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:24,573
I mean, he's really out.

127
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:30,061
[hand squeaks]
 [thumps]

128
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:31,718
I think he's dead!

129
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:32,857
Oh my God.

130
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:33,754
- Dead?!

131
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:34,755
- Uh yeah.

132
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:37,931
He's dead.

133
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,104
- As in,

134
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:40,209
dead dead?

135
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:41,382
- Real dead.

136
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:43,523
Oh shit, I'd better
 call a medic.

137
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,526
- Oh, okay bye.
[phone clicks]

138
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,699
She fucking killed him.

139
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:51,151
[phone beeps]
 - [whines] Why me?

140
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:53,360
Why is it always me?

141
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,365
[phone clicking]
[Annie sighs]

142
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:03,232
[women whispering]

143
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:06,580
- Hi.

144
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:11,792
[sighs] I'm sorry to
 put you through this

145
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,380
during your time of grieving,

146
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,657
but the sooner we
 get on with it,

147
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:16,556
the sooner you'll be
 able to get it on.

148
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,629
With it.

149
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:24,564
- Oh, I understand, I think.

150
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,776
- Were you uh,
 long-time friends?

151
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:32,330
- Well, not really,
 but we were close.

152
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,538
- I see.

153
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,402
Uh, well Mr. McCoy's
will was rather specific

154
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:37,749
about how his estate
 would be settled.

155
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:39,302
- Well, to be honest with you,

156
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:41,132
I'm kinda surprised
 I'm even here.

157
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,826
- It reads uh, and I quote,

158
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:49,140
in as much as a fellow never
 knows who's gonna turn yellow

159
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,728
and run when the
 going gets tough,

160
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:52,315
and I can't rightly know

161
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:55,318
who will stand by
 me in the very end,

162
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:57,493
I hereby bequeath
 my entire estate

163
00:09:57,493 --> 00:10:00,047
to whomever is next to me
 at the time of my death.

164
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:02,015
That's you.

165
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:05,881
- Are you saying
 that Annie inherited

166
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:07,572
all of Mr. McCoy's estate?

167
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,644
- Well, that would be the case.

168
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,163
- I'm rich, [laughs] I'm rich!

169
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:15,166
- [Lawyer] Not quite that easy.

170
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,064
- [Together] Oh?

171
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:18,272
- From what we can determine,

172
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:20,343
Mr. McCoy's holdings
 consisted mainly

173
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:23,726
of the Devil's Ring
 Casino in Nevada.

174
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:24,969
- Casino?

175
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:27,454
- [Lawyer] Yes, that and
the Lost Diamond Mine.

176
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:28,558
- Diamond mine?

177
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:30,008
- Well that's what it's called.

178
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:32,390
Actually, the Lost Diamond
 Mine is a silver mine.

179
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,013
- Who cares, silver,
 gold, I'm not picky.

180
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:38,154
- Well here are the deeds
 to the Devil's Ring Casino

181
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:39,604
and the Lost Diamond Mine,

182
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:41,744
and in the packet is some money,

183
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:45,437
whatever was in his pockets
 at his time of passing.

184
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,957
- Thank you so much.

185
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:51,133
- Please be advised that
the Lost Diamond Mine

186
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,964
is actually lost, no
 one's been able to find it

187
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:59,003
in 100 years of searching
 and it's said to be haunted.

188
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:03,663
There's a map in there, but
 the map is 150 years old.

189
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,872
So undoubtedly, it's worthless.

190
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:07,874
- Well, check and double check.

191
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,429
- At least you own
 a casino. [laughs]

192
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:12,982
- You wanna go to Nevada?

193
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:16,468
- [Stacy] Thought you'd
 never ask, come on! [laughs]

194
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:24,822
[lawyer sighs]
 [sniffs]

195
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:28,101
[upbeat, twangy music]

196
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:37,697
- [Annie] Imagine, being able
 to walk through the doors

197
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,976
of your very own casino,
snap your fingers

198
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:43,703
and everybody
 jumps to serve you.

199
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:48,708
- [Stacy] Mm, free shrimp
 cocktails. [laughs]

200
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,365
- [Annie] My own
personal slot machines.

201
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,990
- [Stacy] Cheap
 hookers. [laughs]

202
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,337
- [Annie] Hot,
 desperate gigolos.

203
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:58,338
[Stacy laughs]

204
00:11:58,338 --> 00:12:00,374
There's one problem, though.

205
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,723
I think that we're lost.

206
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:10,039
- [Stacy] No sweat, just pull
 over and ask for directions.

207
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,249
- Oh, check this guy out.

208
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:19,704
[twangy banjo music]

209
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:25,848
Hey Gomer!

210
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:28,333
Which way to
 Devil's Ring Casino?

211
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,578
[upbeat, twangy music]

212
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,719
Don't strain yourself.

213
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:37,929
[upbeat, twangy music]

214
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,561
[quiet, mysterious music]

215
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:04,197
[gravel crunching]
 [quiet, mysterious music]

216
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:14,448
[birds chirping]
 [quiet, mysterious music]

217
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:25,701
[Annie yawns]

218
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:30,568
- Well, I wonder how much
 further it is to Devil's Ring.

219
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:33,847
- [sighs] I don't know,
 but my ass is killing me.

220
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:39,473
- This looks like a lovely
 place to die. [chuckles]

221
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:40,889
- You're kidding me.

222
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,339
Even the ghosts have pulled
 up stake and moved on.

223
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:44,168
- Wow.

224
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,549
Uh, Annie,

225
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,655
look.

226
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:52,762
[snare drum rim shot]

227
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:55,041
- Oh dear.

228
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:58,527
- Oh dear, oh dear.

229
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:00,460
- [sighs] Why me?

230
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,461
Why is it always me?

231
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:04,119
- [Wyatt] Having car trouble?

232
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:07,881
- Oh, [laughs] no.

233
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,365
We were just looking around.

234
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,195
- Well this ain't
 no place for women

235
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,645
to be poking around here.

236
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:17,270
There's dangers here y'all
 don't want no part of.

237
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:19,651
- Danger?

238
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,759
- Yeah, dangers, like
 rattlesnakes and Chihuahuas

239
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,106
and orangutans,
 big as your hand.

240
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:26,900
- Bigger.

241
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,662
Really, this ain't
 no place for ladies.

242
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:34,080
- [laughs] Well, thanks
for the warning, guys,

243
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,221
but Annie here, she
 owns this whole town

244
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:38,429
and everything in it.

245
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:40,155
So uh, you can just go ahead.

246
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,504
- [spits] [laughing]
 You hear that?

247
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:47,714
Owns Devil's Ring,
 you hear that, Wyatt?

248
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:50,613
- Lock, stock and barrel.

249
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:51,856
- You don't say?

250
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:55,170
- I do say, inherited
 it from R.J. McCoy.

251
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,930
- Old R.J., is he uh.

252
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:00,761
- Get the picture?

253
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:04,282
- Well, this ain't no place
 to be spending the night,

254
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:06,802
not with all them
 spooks flying around,

255
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:09,701
shrieking, making all
 kinds of crazy noises.

256
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,220
- Noises.

257
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,981
- So why don't you
 two little ladies

258
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:16,225
come up to the big house
and visit with the boss?

259
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:19,677
Him and and R.J.,
 they were like that.

260
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:22,335
- [laughs] And
 which one was R.J.?

261
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:23,923
- Well R.J. was uh,

262
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:26,753
damn.

263
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:28,306
[Annie laughs]

264
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:29,721
Why don't you two funny ladies

265
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,241
come up to the
 big house anyways?

266
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:34,864
I'm sure the boss
would like to meet you.

267
00:15:34,864 --> 00:15:36,901
- Oh, [sighs] I guess
 I'll check it out.

268
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:39,076
- Yeah, you know what, I'll
 put the luggage in there

269
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,974
and I'll have a bed waiting for
you when you get back, okay?

270
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,838
- All right, you can tell
 me what horror awaits me.

271
00:15:42,838 --> 00:15:44,598
- Yeah. [laughs]

272
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:45,945
- All right, let's go.

273
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:51,260
[Stacy sighs]

274
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:55,678
[horse whinnies]
 [strumming music]

275
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:57,749
So were you and R.J. close?

276
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:00,787
- [Wyatt] Mm. [laughs]

277
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:04,722
- Well, I guess you could
 say old R.J. and J.R.

278
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:08,415
Were opposites, yeah,
but friendly opposites.

279
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,900
I was the yin to
 his yang, you know,

280
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,249
the salt to his pepper,
the bacon to his eggs,

281
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:18,046
the Roy to his Trigger,
 the Starsky to his Hutch,

282
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,531
the Moby to his Dick.

283
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,602
- Mm.

284
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:27,538
- That's why I really couldn't
 understand that when he died,

285
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:29,574
he would leave
 everything to, well,

286
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:33,785
forgive me for saying,
 a complete stranger.

287
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,443
- Well I think that he was
 afraid of who was gonna

288
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:38,825
cut and run when
 the going got tough.

289
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:40,930
- Well that makes
 sense, doesn't it?

290
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,932
Now you may not know this but,

291
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:45,349
old R.J. and I had an agreement

292
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,626
that if one of us died,

293
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:49,905
well the other could
 buy their property.

294
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:51,527
What do you think of that?

295
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,013
- I think it's too bad
 that he's not here to ask.

296
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,982
- [chuckles] Well it's,
that's true, isn't it?

297
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:00,295
Now tell me, have you heard uh,

298
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:01,848
something about uh,

299
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:05,265
little place called
 the Lost Diamond Mine?

300
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:09,787
- Yes, we're gonna start
looking for it tomorrow.

301
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:14,792
- [chuckles] You're gonna
 look for it? [laughs]

302
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:17,105
She gonna look
 for it. [laughing]

303
00:17:17,105 --> 00:17:19,107
Now, I don't know if
you're aware of the fact

304
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:21,143
that for the last 100 years,

305
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:25,906
trained professionals, men,
 have tried to find that mine,

306
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:29,013
men, with dredges and
 machinery and know-how

307
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:32,637
and knowledge and the
knack to read the land.

308
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:35,916
Mineralogists, genealogists,

309
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,679
OBGYN's, no one could find
 that mine in 100 years.

310
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,957
Now, what makes you think,
 you, little Miss Get 'Em,

311
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:44,822
gonna sashay on
 into this territory

312
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:49,620
and walk in there and find the
 Lost Diamond Mine? [laughing]

313
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,139
- We have a map.

314
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:55,764
[wolf howling]

315
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,251
- Good answer.

316
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:03,599
Hm.

317
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,498
Well, you know what?

318
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:08,915
Why don't we just do a
 neighborly thing here,

319
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:12,091
I'm gonna give you a very
 generous amount of money,

320
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,471
yes dear, just a moment,

321
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,509
I'm going to give you a
generous amount of money

322
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,407
for that worthless
 piece of property.

323
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:20,409
Now, what do you
 say to that, huh?

324
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:24,827
- I have to wonder why you'd
 be so kind as to do that.

325
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:27,382
- Well, it's real
 simple, you know,

326
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:30,523
I mean uh, [clears throat]

327
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:32,076
you know, our properties,

328
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:36,391
they sort of butt up to
 each other, yeah, and uh,

329
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:39,325
well I had always figured
 I would bulldoze that ugly,

330
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:41,292
old, rundown ghost town anyway

331
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:44,157
and let my cattle sort of
 spread out a little bit.

332
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,780
You know, nobody
 likes a narrow cattle,

333
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,750
thin, scrawny, limp cattle.

334
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,372
They like strong
 cattle, you know,

335
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:55,134
it's a lot easier to catch
 'em and brand 'em, you know.

336
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:02,244
- Well, I'm afraid that I can't
fully entertain your offer

337
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:03,694
until I've had
 time to investigate

338
00:19:03,694 --> 00:19:06,248
exactly what it is
 that I've inherited.

339
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:08,492
- Uh, [clears throat]
That's fine, thank you.

340
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:13,773
[sighs] Well, you haven't
 even heard my offer yet.

341
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:16,189
- I'm sure I will,
 in a few days.

342
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:19,779
- Well, suit yourself.
 [clears throat]

343
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:22,264
Oh uh, by the way, uh,

344
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:24,508
if you've heard, there is a uh,

345
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:26,510
terrible curse on
 that area up there,

346
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,098
called the Devil's Ring.

347
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:32,930
That whole area, there's
some sort of a strange,

348
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,658
ghostly spirit to that area,

349
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:40,317
and it's, it's filled with dark,

350
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:42,905
demon-y, little biting,
squiggly little things

351
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,355
with gnawing teeth that'll come

352
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:46,702
and get inside your underwear
 and gnaw on your privates.

353
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,465
- Oh, thanks for the warning.

354
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:54,020
- Well, you're welcome.

355
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,850
It's what neighbors do, huh?

356
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,818
Well you'll uh,

357
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,511
have a good night, and I
 hope to see you real soon.

358
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:11,002
[Annie sighs]

359
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:14,592
Well girls, if you'll excuse me,

360
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:16,836
I think uh, we're gonna
have to go outside,

361
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:19,287
do a little man talk, huh boys?

362
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:21,599
Why don't you uh, make
yourselves comfortable?

363
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,224
Boys.

364
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:41,550
[match snaps]

365
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,527
[J.R. sighs]

366
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:55,184
- you want us to
 tar and feather her?

367
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:56,047
- Tar and feather.

368
00:20:57,394 --> 00:21:01,329
No, you crazy, tar is
 up to $52 a barrel.

369
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:03,917
No, we gotta come up with
 something craftier now.

370
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:06,265
- Hm.
 - Gotta get a hold of that map

371
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,267
to the Lost Diamond Mine.

372
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,958
- We can scare 'em off.

373
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,200
That always works.

374
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:14,549
- Yeah, you're both real scary.

375
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,310
Well whatever we do,

376
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,140
that girl's gotta sell
 that property in two days.

377
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,969
You got me?

378
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:24,110
- Yeah.

379
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,698
- How many days?

380
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:26,733
- Two days.

381
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:27,562
- How many?

382
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:29,426
- Two?

383
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,738
- Good.

384
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,260
[slaps arm]

385
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,744
- What's up?

386
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:42,128
- Not what's up, but uh,
 what's going down, yonder.

387
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:45,476
[Wyatt chuckles]

388
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:48,617

[wolf howling]
 [insects singing]

393
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:28,174
- Oh, do you think

394
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,557
everything about this place
 being haunted is true?

395
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,525
- No, don't be silly.

396
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:37,494
There's no such thing as ghosts.

397
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:41,774
[upbeat, twangy music]

398
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:49,851
Gomer, shut up!

[women sigh]

400
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:01,241
See, I told you,
nothing to worry about.

401
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:02,829
- Yeah.

402
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:05,349

[men yelling]

406
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,817
- [Wyatt] Hey it's me,
 it's me, it's Wyatt.

407
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:26,335
Here.

408
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:27,544
Scare ya?

409
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:30,961
- You scared the hell
 outta me! [mutters]

410
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:35,310
- [Wyatt] Well, let's hope
 that it works on the girls.

411
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,518
Where's my hat?

412
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:42,351
[men yelling]

413
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:44,077
[Wyatt clattering]

414
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:46,183
- [Ringo] Sheesh, you all right?

415
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:47,322
- [Wyatt] All right,
 come on, let's go.

416
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,428
They're just a couple of girls.

417
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,808
- Woo!
 - Sheesh.

418
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:54,398

[men mimicking ghosts]

421
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:03,821
- Annie.

422
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:05,202
Annie, wake up!

423
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:06,341
- What?

424
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:07,480
- Listen.

425
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,621
[playful music]
 [men mimicking ghosts]

426
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:12,243
What kind of animal
 makes that noise?

427
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,072
- Huh?

428
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:15,971
A dead animal.

429
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:17,110
[gasps] Look!

430
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,284
Oh my God!

431
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:19,458
- [Ringo] Wyatt,
where you going?

432
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,631
Yo, hey Wyatt,

433
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:25,153
this way.
 [men mimicking ghosts]

434
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:28,570
- [shuddering] Are
 they, are they ghosts?

435
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:31,711
- Well it ain't a clan rally.

436
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:34,473
[playful, spooky music]
[men laugh]

[hooves pattering]

439
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:41,480
- Ha!

440
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,791
Ha ha!

441
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:47,796
[gentle, Western music]
[men mimicking ghosts]

442
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:48,866
Whoa, ha.

443
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:53,181
[upbeat, Western music]
[men mutter]

444
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:54,216
- [Ringo] Look at that!

445

[hooves pattering]
[upbeat, Western music]

450
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:26,732
- What the hell just happened?

451
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:27,560
- I don't know.

452
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:31,702
I, I think the fireworks
are over for tonight.

453
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:34,325
- [labored breathing] Good.

454
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,603
[sighs] I'm beat.

455
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:36,845
- Me too.

456
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:40,987
[twangy, strumming music]

457
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:42,023
- Gomer, shut up!

458
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:47,684
[sighs] Okay, goodnight, Stace.

459
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:49,271
- Goodnight, Annie.

460
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,550
- [Together] Goodnight, R.J.

461
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,829
- Okay. [sighs]

462
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,659
[insects singing]

463
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,389
[twangy, strumming music]

464
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:07,566
- Oh. [laughs]

465
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,397
[Ringo yelling]

466
00:26:11,397 --> 00:26:12,812
- God!

467
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:17,472
Oh, this is so gay,
 Wyatt. [labored breathing]

468
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,716
- Where'd you get
 the tattoo, Ringo,

469
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:21,165
and who the hell's Ryan?

470
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:24,134
[Ringo yelling]

471
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:25,929
- Just get the
 goddamn bullet out

472
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:28,207
and nevermind you
 about Ryan, okay?

473
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:30,899
- I missed it.
 - Oh!

474
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:32,867
- It seems to be
going in deeper.

475
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:35,283
[Ringo grunting]

476
00:26:35,283 --> 00:26:38,666
[swishing broom]

477
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:39,528
- Ew.

478
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,913
- [sighs] What a mess.

479
00:26:46,294 --> 00:26:48,917
Maybe I should just sell
 this place to J.R. Masterson.

480
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,852
[sighs] I mean, I
 don't see what value

481
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:56,062
could possibly be in
 it for me. [sighs]

482
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:58,582
- I don't know, but
 someone who wants something

483
00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:02,448
as bad as he does, that
makes me suspicious.

484
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:04,070
- I know, I mean,

485
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,970
he was practically
 drooling over it.

486
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,490
- Yeah.

487
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,734
Who was that woman last night?

488
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:15,944
- I don't know, but she
even scared the spooks.

489
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:17,912
- Actually, I thought
 she was hot looking.

490
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:20,017
[women laugh]
 - Definitely agreed.

491
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:24,677
- [clears throat]
 Morning ladies.

492
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:27,991
- Oh, [sighs] Mr. Masterson,

493
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:29,682
you sure are light on your feet.

494
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,408
Didn't hear you coming.

495
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:33,306
- [chuckles] Yeah, I'm sorry,

496
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:35,619
next time I'll be sure
 and holler real loud.

497
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:36,896
- What brings you our way?

498
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:40,451
- Well, I just wanted to
 make sure you both, [sighs]

499
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,936
doing fine, you know,

500
00:27:41,936 --> 00:27:44,490
make sure that you didn't
 have any problems at night.

501
00:27:45,905 --> 00:27:48,218
- Well, we did have a bit
 of a ruckus last night,

502
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:51,117
but [sighs] turned
 out okay in the end.

503
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:54,051
- Ah, well, I heard about that.

504
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:57,917
You know, it's a long time
 since I've been up here.

505
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:59,125
Place sure has changed a lot

506
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,713
since I've been here
 though. [laughs]

507
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:04,544
Now it's just a big, old dump.

508
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:07,582
Like a big, old tinder box just
waiting to ignite, isn't it?

509
00:28:07,582 --> 00:28:10,516
- Yeah, a tinder box,

510
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:13,243
but a tinder box with potential.

511
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:15,694
- Yeah, lots of potential.

512
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,696
- Oh, potential.

513
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,214
Well, you two little ladies

514
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:22,977
gonna clean this whole place
 all by yourself? [laughs]

515
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:24,564
- This corner of it, yeah.

516
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:28,568
- Well good, real good.

517
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,088
- Well, if you don't mind,

518
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:32,400
we've got some work to do.

519
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,162
- Oh, oh, that's
 fine, that's fine.

520
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:38,855
Oh uh, just wanted to remind
 you of that offer I made you,

521
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:40,477
it still stands.

522
00:28:40,477 --> 00:28:43,722
Might save you a whole
lotta trouble and time.

523
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,102
- [chuckles] Yeah, don't worry,

524
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:47,484
we'll keep your offer in mind.

525
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:50,832
- Well, I never worry, ladies.

526
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:53,766
Good day to you.

527
00:29:00,393 --> 00:29:05,364
[twangy, strumming music]
 [pattering hooves]

528
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,888
Wyatt, Ringo,

529
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:15,857
you two nitwits think
 you got what it takes

530
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:17,652
to get this job done?

531
00:29:17,652 --> 00:29:19,033
- Ready and willing, boss.

532
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:21,587
- All right.

533
00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:23,106
Only this time, boys,

534
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:25,660
I think we're gonna try a
 little different approach.

535
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,972
- Different approach?

536
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:30,044
- Yeah, yeah, here's
 what you're gonna do,

537
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:32,632
you're gonna start by
 befriending those young girls.

538
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:34,842
That's right, get
 real cozy like,

539
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:36,602
help 'em with their chores

540
00:29:36,602 --> 00:29:38,293
and then when they
 least suspect it,

541
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:39,536
I want you to steal that map

542
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:42,677
and you bring it
 back to me, you hear?

543
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:45,991
- Yeah, I get it, it's
 like uh, reverse paralysis.

544
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:50,616
- Just do it, will ya?

545
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,308
- Yes sir, you got it, J.R.

546
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:54,689
- Oh and boys,

547
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:56,104
I want you to wait
 a full half an hour

548
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:58,935
before you ride on in
 there, you hear me?

549
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:00,108
Don't screw up.

550
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:02,524
See you boys.

551
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:12,120
[pattering hooves]
 [strumming music]

552
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,681
- Two Bit says this map

553
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:23,545
is what everyone's
 so excited about.

554
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:25,824
- Well it sure isn't
 the view. [laughs]

555
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,965
- Well, I'm going to
 put this someplace

556
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:31,105
they'll never sniff
 it out. [laughs]

557
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:33,107
- Good luck hiding it there.

558
00:30:33,107 --> 00:30:36,558
[pattering hooves]
 [horse whinnies]

559
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,734
- Well, well, well, look
 what the gopher dragged in.

560
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:44,221
[pattering hooves]

561
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:45,464
- Morning, ladies.

562
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:46,775
- What's shaking, handsome?

563
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:50,710
- Thought you might need
some help lifting stuff.

564
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,333
- Well, [sighs] I guess so.

565
00:30:53,782 --> 00:30:55,819
[claps rail] This rail
 here could use some work.

566
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:57,407
You boys got tools?

567
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:01,929
- Yeah, you got some
tools over there in that

568
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:03,516
blacksmith shop over there.

569
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:06,692
- Great, let's go find 'em.

570
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,247
- They're right over yonder.

571
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:18,324
- Okay Slick--

572
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:20,637
- My name's Ringo, ma'am.

573
00:31:20,637 --> 00:31:22,087
- Come on, follow me.

574
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:27,333
[twangy, strumming music]

575
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:49,459
[Annie sighs]

576
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,944
- Well, this place looks like

577
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,015
it's being held
 together with cobwebs,

578
00:31:54,015 --> 00:31:55,741
but it's home for now.

579
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,779
- Never dared venture
 inside here before.

580
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:01,643
- Well, I found a room upstairs,

581
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:02,921
I think if I fix it up,

582
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,406
Stacy and I can bunk
 down there tonight.

583
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:08,719
- You two girls sleep together?

584
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:11,515
- [slaps chest] It's not
like that, you pervert.

585
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,517
Not yet anyway.

586
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:15,864
You coming?

587
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:16,693
- You bet.

588
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:29,050
- Back yonder is
 the blacksmith shop,

589
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,431
all the blacks and the smiths

590
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:32,951
used to get together
 and pound nails.

591
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,435
- Oh Jesus.

592
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:37,610
- No, Jesus wasn't into pounding
nails, that was the Romans.

593
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,715
- Hey, look over here.

594
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,722
- Yeah, what do
 you got over there?

595
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:50,209
- Hm, see something
 you like, cowboy?

596
00:32:51,693 --> 00:32:54,731
- Uh, sorry ma'am, I, I
 didn't mean to be staring.

597
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:55,525
- Yeah?

598
00:32:56,836 --> 00:32:58,045
How about now?

599
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,046
- Oh now, now I
 meant to be staring,

600
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,254
oh yeah, and I'm staring.

601
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:03,464
- You know, [sighs]
 why don't you show me

602
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:05,707
how they pound the
 nails out West.

603
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,333
- Sure thing.

604
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,506
First you're gonna
need this hammer over--

605
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:13,922
- No, not those kind.

606
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:17,650
Like this.

607
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,722
[upbeat, sexy music]

608
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:24,623
[door clatters]

609
00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:30,732
- Woo!
 [crow cawing]

610
00:33:30,732 --> 00:33:33,735
This place sure does
 give me the creeps!

611
00:33:33,735 --> 00:33:35,979
- Well, at least it's indoors.

612
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:39,224
I did not wanna spend
 another night outside.

613
00:33:39,224 --> 00:33:40,501
- You know what?

614
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:42,158
I think this used to be the room

615
00:33:42,158 --> 00:33:44,781
where the hookers used to
 hang out, back in the day.

616
00:33:45,747 --> 00:33:46,679
[book thumps]
 - Ew,

617
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,544
um, just how old is this place?

618
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:52,168
- Goes back to the late 1800's.

619
00:33:52,168 --> 00:33:55,447
It was just a small wagon
 stop at the edge of town

620
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:59,451
where people would rest up
before moving on to California.

621
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:01,487
- A real boom town, huh?

622
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:03,041
- Not exactly,

623
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,629
but when some folk discovered
 silver in the mines,

624
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,907
this place did heat up a might.

625
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:11,118
- So that's where the Lost
 Diamond Mine comes in.

626
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:13,982
- Well, that's more
 of a legend really.

627
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:15,915
Biggest thing about
 that is the idea

628
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:18,815
that a local outlaw
 named Calamity Kate

629
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:21,990
hid her stash of loot
out there in them mines.

630
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:24,890
- Calamity Kate?

631
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,376
- They say she was
 one tough lady.

632
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:31,103
They say she robbed
dozens of stagecoaches,

633
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,071
banks and trains.

634
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,626
They say her ghost
still haunts this place,

635
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:39,905
protecting her treasure
 in the Lost Diamond Mine.

636
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:45,773
- All this talk of ghosts and
 spooks, there's no such thing.

637
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:48,362
- I wouldn't be so
 sure about that.

638
00:34:48,362 --> 00:34:51,710
- So, is that why J.R. Masterson
wants this place so badly?

639
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,437
- I reckon he'd love to
 bulldoze this whole place

640
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:58,751
if he thought he could
 discover the lost mine shaft.

641
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:01,271
- Isn't he afraid of the ghosts?

642
00:35:01,271 --> 00:35:05,103
- He don't believe in that
 sort of thing, but I do.

643
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:09,831
- Poor, poor Ringo.

644
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:13,801
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

645
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:17,391
- Yeah, but who's
 gonna protect you?

646
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:19,703
- [sighs] Why don't we uh,

647
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:22,568
check out that couch and make
 sure it's safe to sleep on?

648
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,019
- Couldn't hurt.

649
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:26,710
- [laughs] That's
 what you think.

650
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:30,369
[Ringo shudders]
[groans]

651
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:31,198
- Careful.

652
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:33,372
Real careful.

653
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:36,651
- Oh.
 - What are you looking at?

654
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,308
Hey--
 - I've never seen

655
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:40,103
one of these before, close up.

656
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:42,105
- Hey, that's cold steel.

657
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:43,624
- Oh, [giggles] I like it.

658
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:46,282
- Careful with that.

659
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:49,388
It's a man's weapon.

660
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:51,804
It's long and hard.

661
00:35:51,804 --> 00:35:52,633
- Yeah?

662
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:57,569
I'll show you a woman's weapon.

663
00:35:57,569 --> 00:36:01,849
[buttons patter]
[Ringo whimpers]

664
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:05,508
[cheerful, strumming music]

665
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:14,896
[pattering hooves]
 [cheerful, strumming music]

666
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:27,806
- Thought I gave you guys
 fair warning last night.

667
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:30,015
Maybe you don't hear so good.

668
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:32,190
- Um, who are you?

669
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,743
- I'll ask the questions.

670
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,710
- That's the,

671
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,851
the girl who shot me last night.

672
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:40,439
- What's going on here?

673
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,374
- You boys have got to the
count of 10, you're outta here.

674
00:36:44,374 --> 00:36:45,582
- Don't bother counting.

675
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:52,658
[Ringo whimpering]
 [upbeat, strumming music]

676
00:36:59,355 --> 00:37:01,011
- You ladies are too trusting.

677
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,221
Those boys ain't the brightest
 prairie dogs in the hole,

678
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,223
but they sure know
 how to follow orders.

679
00:37:06,327 --> 00:37:08,743
[exhales] You got that map?

680
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,747
- Yes.

681
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:13,576
- Good.

682
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,476
Now, let's get out of the
 middle of the road, huh?

683
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,242
[pattering hooves]

684
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,762
[twangy, strumming music]

685
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:37,772
[pattering footsteps]

686
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:42,260
This is the old VIP room.

687
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:46,402
Guests of a wealthy manner

688
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:50,198
were finely entertained
here. [laughs]

689
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:55,203
Parties went on for days
 and days and days and days.

690
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:58,034
'Til the money or the booze
 ran out, that is. [chuckles]

691
00:37:58,034 --> 00:38:01,071
- Well, sounds like you
know this place well.

692
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:01,900
- I did.

693
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:03,833
Once.

694
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:06,836
- Well who are you?

695
00:38:06,836 --> 00:38:09,425
- Well that doesn't really
 matter now, does it?

696
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:10,702
- [laughs] Yeah, it does.

697
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,911
I mean, you just don't
know who you can trust.

698
00:38:12,911 --> 00:38:16,673
- Well, I got me some
 land over the hill there,

699
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:19,331
but that J.R.
 Masterson bought up

700
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:22,092
every speck of land in
this place except mine.

701
00:38:23,128 --> 00:38:24,923
I hate that bastard.

702
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,375
[gun clicking]
 [exhales]

703
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,480
And those damn polecats
that work for him.

704
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:33,656
We agree to disagree.

705
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:36,314
- For a minute there,

706
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,556
I thought you might be a ghost.

707
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:40,387
- Ghost? [mimics a ghost]

708
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:42,527
I mean, [laughing]

709
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:49,948
really girls, would a
 ghost kiss like this?

710
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,574
[twinkling music]

711
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:58,750
[gentle, quiet music]

712
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:07,655
Woo!

713
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:13,420
[horse whinnies]

714
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:17,803
[J.R. exhales]

715
00:39:17,803 --> 00:39:19,495
- Now let me get this straight,

716
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:23,361
you say that, [clears
 throat] yesterday

717
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,915
she shot you in the ass.

718
00:39:25,915 --> 00:39:27,813
- No no no, that was me, boss.

719
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,056
- That was him.

720
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:31,092
- Oh, she shot you in
the ass and then today,

721
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:34,372
come back again and she
run both of you off.

722
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:37,892
- She's incredibly fast, boss,

723
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:40,861
I mean, she's so fast.
 [mimics shooting]

724
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:43,691
[J.R. laughs]

725
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:47,074
- Let me see if I can assess
 what's going on here now,

726
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:49,732
evidently, for
 the last two days,

727
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:54,046
these two little girls have
 been kicking your two big,

728
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:57,153
tough asses all
 around the place.

729
00:39:57,153 --> 00:40:00,018
Am I right or not?

730
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:02,434
Yeah well,

731
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,920
I guess that calls for
 more drastic measures.

732
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,749
- You mean?

733
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,027
- What do you mean, "You mean,"

734
00:40:09,027 --> 00:40:10,235
you don't even know what I mean.

735
00:40:10,235 --> 00:40:11,478
You don't know what
 I was gonna say

736
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:12,720
when I said, "I mean,"
 you know what I mean?

737
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,032
You know?

738
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:15,689
- All right, boss.

739
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:16,966
- All right?

740
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:20,866
No, what I mean is a
 little tit for tat.

741
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:22,523
- Tit for what?

742
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:23,662
- Tit for tat!

743
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:26,424
Map for muff.

744
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,115
One of you is gonna go in there

745
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:30,048
and you are gonna kidnap
one of those girls

746
00:40:30,048 --> 00:40:31,601
and hold her for the map.

747
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:33,914
- Oh.

748
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:35,536
- Which one?

749
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:37,814
- I don't give a
 rusty fart which one.

750
00:40:37,814 --> 00:40:39,644
Just go in and do
 something right

751
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:41,818
for once in your miserable
 lives, all right?

752
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:45,373
'Cause I am tired of being
nice, I am tired of being nice.

753
00:40:45,373 --> 00:40:47,237
[shudders] Oh, I wanna be evil.

754
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,792
I wanna be evil. [shudders]

755
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:51,794
Just do it.

756
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:57,040
[twangy, strumming music]

757
00:41:17,026 --> 00:41:18,165
[gun clicks]

758
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:21,651
[twangy, strumming music]

759
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:59,137
[shuffling footsteps]

760
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,146
[Wyatt exhales]

761
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:11,321
[shuffling footsteps]

762
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:20,158
- Hate to do this, but,

763
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:21,504
[gun clicks] hands up.

764
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:23,955
- What?

765
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:26,958
- You are now my hostage.

766
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:30,030
- [sighs] You are so dead.

767
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,825
- We'll just have
 to see about that.

768
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:33,723
Let's go, move it, move it.

769
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,735
[rustling hay]
 [cows mooing]

770
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:53,260
[clanking metal]
[rooster crows]

771
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,021
- Hold it right
 there, sweetheart.

772
00:42:58,196 --> 00:42:59,473
- What do you want?

773
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:04,754
- Uh, taking you prisoner.

774
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:06,307
- [sighs] So what's the plan?

775
00:43:06,307 --> 00:43:09,621
You gonna kidnap me and
ransom me for the map?

776
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:10,553
- Yeah, that's it.

777
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:14,419
- Aren't you
 forgetting something?

778
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:17,698
- Like what?

779
00:43:19,113 --> 00:43:21,391
- Like my new friend
 who's got a pistol

780
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:22,807
pointed at your head.

781
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:26,569
- Ha, that's funny.
 [pistol clicks]

782
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:27,743
- Take his gun, Annie.

783
00:43:29,537 --> 00:43:30,677
Hold him up here.

784
00:43:31,816 --> 00:43:34,542
I think we got some
 trouble outside.

785
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:45,761
- This isn't loaded.

786
00:43:47,072 --> 00:43:49,557
- Yeah, I know, I didn't
want anyone to get hurt.

787
00:43:50,455 --> 00:43:52,250
- You know? [slaps arm]

788
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,493
Maybe you're not such
 a bad guy after all.

789
00:43:56,392 --> 00:43:57,220
You want the map?

790
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,741
Why don't you strip
 search me for it?

791
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,757
[Annie chuckles]

792
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:17,965
- Got any front pockets?

793
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:22,729
- Don't you think I'd hide it
 somewhere much more creative?

794
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:28,493
[clattering items]

795
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:31,979
Wyatt, you bonehead.

796
00:44:32,877 --> 00:44:34,602
Let's take a roll in the hay.

797
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:41,264
[upbeat, sexy music]
 [heavy breathing]

798
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:57,418
[Annie laughs]

00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:10,811
[birds chirping]

801
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:19,613
[twangy, strumming music]
 - Come on over.

802
00:45:23,065 --> 00:45:26,240
[pattering footsteps]

803
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,971
[birds chirping]

804
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:38,874
- Well I've about had
 it with you bitches.

805
00:45:38,874 --> 00:45:42,532
Now, I want you to hand me
 over that map right now,

806
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,155
otherwise little Miss
 Goody Two-Shoes here

807
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:46,813
is gonna be turned
 into prairie dust.

808
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:50,230
- Tough talk, Masterson.

809
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:53,751
Let's see if you can back it up.

810
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:57,271
Annie, bring him out!

811
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:01,206
[Wyatt clattering]
 - Ow!

812
00:46:01,206 --> 00:46:02,035
Ow, ow.

813
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,279
Ow.

814
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:07,350
- [sighs] Wyatt,

815
00:46:08,524 --> 00:46:10,664
you are dumber than
 paint, you know that?

816
00:46:11,492 --> 00:46:12,770
- Yes sir, I am.

817
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,081
- 'Cause you are so dumb,

818
00:46:14,081 --> 00:46:16,704
you think that MCI is a rapper.

819
00:46:16,704 --> 00:46:18,189
- Dumb I am sir, yes.

820
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:19,673
- You're so dumb,

821
00:46:19,673 --> 00:46:22,020
you think that Taco Bell
 is a Mexican phone company.

822
00:46:23,953 --> 00:46:24,782
- It's not?

823
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,508
- You're so dumb,

824
00:46:27,508 --> 00:46:30,304
if you saw a sign that said,
 "Wet floor," you'd do it.

825
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:36,794
All right, what do you want?

826
00:46:38,036 --> 00:46:41,799
- Exchange, send
Stacy over here,

827
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,317
we'll send back
 your trained monkey.

828
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:47,943
- Ha, I always get the short
 end of the deal, don't I?

829
00:46:47,943 --> 00:46:50,704
All right, you win. [sighs]

830
00:46:50,704 --> 00:46:51,878
Go ahead, send her over.

831
00:46:53,396 --> 00:46:55,329
[shuffling footsteps]

832
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:56,848
All right, no bring Wyatt over.

833
00:47:01,473 --> 00:47:02,474
- Can I have my gun back?

834
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:04,407
[thumps hat]
 Oh, my hat.

835
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:05,857
Ow! [clattering footsteps]

836
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:09,274
Nice meeting ya!
 [pattering footsteps]

837

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,154
[whistling, Western music]

839
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:30,054
- Well now, seems to me

840
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:31,814
there ought to be some way
 we can settle this thing.

841
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:35,266
- The only way I know how.

842
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:38,614
[upbeat, Western music]

843
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,825
- Whoa, [laughs]

844
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:45,172
just you and me then, huh?

845
00:47:45,172 --> 00:47:48,520
[upbeat, Western music]

846
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:57,081
- On the count of three.

847
00:47:57,081 --> 00:48:00,394
[upbeat, Western music]

848
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:06,021
One,

849
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:11,405
two--

850
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:16,134
[horse whinnies]
[gun blasting]

851
00:48:16,134 --> 00:48:21,139
[J.R. laughing]
[gun blasting]

852
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,107
- Sorry about that,

853
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:25,592
but I never was much
 good at playing fair.

854
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:28,975
[upbeat, dramatic music]

855
00:48:30,528 --> 00:48:33,082
- Three.
 [gun clicks]

856
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:35,153
- Wait a minute,

857
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,294
I just shot you, you,

858
00:48:38,294 --> 00:48:41,919
[playful, dramatic music]

859
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,403
good Lord,

860
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:44,611
good Lord, you,

861
00:48:44,611 --> 00:48:47,925
you must be the ghost
 of Calamity Kate!

862
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,581
[horse whinnies]

863
00:48:49,581 --> 00:48:53,206
[playful, dramatic music]

864
00:48:53,206 --> 00:48:54,724
All right, I'll get you!

865
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,657
If not now, I'll get
 you at the sequel!

866
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:01,662
[stammering] What
 are you waiting for?

867
00:49:01,662 --> 00:49:06,081
- [Wyatt] Oh my God, it really
 is the ghost! [shudders]

868
00:49:06,081 --> 00:49:11,086
[Ringo shuddering]
 [playful, dramatic music]

869
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,509
[women breath a sigh of relief]

870
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:22,614
[Kate sighs]

871
00:49:22,614 --> 00:49:25,100
- That was unreal,
 you scared 'em silly!

872
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,518
- I mean, he really thought
 that he shot a ghost.

873
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:32,383
What did you use,
 a bullet proof bra?

874
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:34,454
- What's that?

875
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:38,216
- You know, that thing that
 keeps you from getting shot?

876
00:49:38,216 --> 00:49:40,425
- [chuckles] I'm afraid not.

877
00:49:42,255 --> 00:49:44,878
- You really are
 the ghost of uh--

878
00:49:44,878 --> 00:49:46,362
- Calamity Kate!
- Yeah!

879
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:50,539
- Well, my friends
 call me Katherine.

880
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:53,128
- Oh my gosh! [laughs]
 - Wow! [laughs]

881
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:56,096
- You still got that map?

882
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:59,513
- Yeah um, what do you
 want me to do with it?

883
00:50:01,274 --> 00:50:03,828
- Well, you plan on
looking for my treasure?

884
00:50:03,828 --> 00:50:05,623
- No, not if you
 don't want us to.

885
00:50:06,693 --> 00:50:09,178
- Good, well if I were you,

886
00:50:09,178 --> 00:50:11,215
I'd burn that map
 and head on home.

887
00:50:13,217 --> 00:50:14,804
- Consider it burned.

888
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,980
- Well, I gotta go.

889
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,500
See y'all later.

890
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,328
Oh,

891
00:50:22,398 --> 00:50:23,227
by the way,

892
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,884
thanks for the hot, steamy sex.

893
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:31,338
It was to die for. [laughs]

894
00:50:34,548 --> 00:50:35,963
- You're welcome.

895
00:50:38,863 --> 00:50:43,833
[quiet, Western music]
 [hooves pattering]

896
00:50:52,187 --> 00:50:53,153
- Um, Annie?

897
00:50:54,672 --> 00:50:55,845
- Mmhmm?

898
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,226
- Let's go home now, okay?

899
00:50:57,226 --> 00:51:00,057
- [laughs] Good idea.
 [Stacy laughs]

00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,680
[engine humming]

901
00:51:04,716 --> 00:51:09,721
[playful, twangy music]
[horn honks]

902
00:51:11,965 --> 00:51:15,106
[shuffling footsteps]

903
00:51:20,422 --> 00:51:23,942
[upbeat, strumming music]
