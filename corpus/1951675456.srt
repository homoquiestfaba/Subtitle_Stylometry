1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,013
People ask, "If you're African,
why's your name Michael Blackson?"

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,016
When I got to customs, they said,
"What's your name?"

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,017
I said:

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,979
"We're gonna call you
Michael Blackson."

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,983
I said, "I don't give a fuck
what you call me. Just let me the fuck in."

6
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,992
The reason...

7
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,996
...the black kids are not learning...

8
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,999
...is because...

9
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,001
...the black parents...

10
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:48,006
...don't know what the fuck
they're doing themselves.

11
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,015
It's hard. I ain't looking
for no man to pay my rent.

12
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,017
I can pay my own rent, hello.

13
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,020
It's the light, gas and phone bill
I need help with.

14
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,989
Black people are funny
than a motherfucker, right?

15
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,991
Look, we can grow up our whole lives...

16
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,993
...and never know
our cousins' real names.

17
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,995
Right? Ain't that some shit?

18
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,998
You know, the other week,
police came to the house:

19
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,002
"We're looking for the whereabouts
of a Clarence Johnson."

20
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,005
"We don't know no Clarence Johnson."

21
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,006
"Are you sure about that?"

22
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,009
"Yeah, officer. Shit.
We don't know no Clarence Johnson."

23
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,013
"Well, what about a Black Black?"

24
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,015
"Oh, that nigga right there.

25
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,019
Shit. Nigga, I didn't know
that was your name.

26
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:46,982
Fuck, get him.
Nigga, run, run. Nigga, run.

27
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,985
Five-0 here. My brother, let me know."

28
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,992
The jumper, a regular
on the comedy-club circuit...

29
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,996
...African American, reported
to be between 25 and 35 years old...

30
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:02,998
...and said to have been depressed.

31
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,001
So how have these typical comics
reacted to the jumper?

32
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,004
I think we can sum it up by these three.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,002
Hey, y'all.

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,006
Remember when my mama
used to try to sing?

35
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,009
We'd be in the car,
she'd turn the radio up.

36
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,010
Trying to sing with Aretha.

37
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,016
Thought she sounded just like her too,
until I cranked down the radio.

38
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,018
She'd be in the car:

39
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,980
"R-E-S-P-E-C-T."

40
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:10,983
And she'd spell it right too...

41
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,986
...but then she sang it
like there was a K at the end.

42
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,988
You know, like "respeck."

43
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,991
Just a little bit of respeck

44
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,996
That's my mama.
Where'd the K come from?

45
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,998
I ain't never seen a K in that word.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,001
Then she'd try to dance.

47
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,004
Started moving her feet.
Kicked that leg up doing the Hucklebuck.

48
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,007
Looked like a white man with a seizure.

49
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,011
My poor mama got no rhythm.

50
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,021
Guess she dance for Jesus now, huh?

51
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,982
Yes.

52
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,989
I'm sorry, y'all.

53
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,992
Hey. Come here.

54
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,998
Hey, boy, don't walk away
when I'm talking to you.

55
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,001
What the hell you think this is? Showtime?
What you trying to do?

56
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,002
Dad, you know as well as I do...

57
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:16,006
...Mama wouldn't want everyone
sitting around just moping and crying.

58
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,012
Do you still plan on leaving?

59
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,015
Nothing left for me here.

60
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,017
Thanks a lot.

61
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,979
So you...

62
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,981
You're going out to Hollywood
to be a big star, huh?

63
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,985
Yeah. Well, this is great timing, Reg.

64
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,987
I mean, with your mama gone...

65
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,991
...you know that I can use all the help
I can get with the business.

66
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,995
Son, you know how many people
try to go off to Hollywood to be a star?

67
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,997
You are set here.

68
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,000
I mean, what is wrong
with selling a little real estate?

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,003
Oh, Dad, that's you. It's not me.

70
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,006
Me, I'm won'th $2.5 million.

71
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,008
I built an empire for you.

72
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,011
No, no, no. You built that for you.

73
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,014
- All right?
- So you're just gonna go out there...

74
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,017
...you know, and be a bum
and make an ass of yourself.

75
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,019
Why don't you get off my back?

76
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,980
Damn, you're always putting heat on me.

77
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,982
I got dreams. I got goals.

78
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,985
- I got things I wanna do.
- Fuck your goddamn dreams.

79
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,989
I done did everything I could
in the world for you.

80
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,994
When you wanted a car...
I had your back.

81
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,998
When you got that little bitch pregnant...
I had your back again.

82
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:35,002
I had your back even when you had
a little substance-abuse problem.

83
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,005
You're inconsiderate and ungrateful.

84
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,008
What the fuck are y'all looking at?

85
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,012
Shit.

86
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,014
I'm sick of y'all.

87
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,017
I just do, do, do. For all of y'all.

88
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,019
For all of y'all.
I bought that goddamn suit.

89
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,980
I take care of your goddamn kids.
What the hell are you looking at?

90
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,984
How many times have I paid
your goddamn rent, huh?

91
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,986
I'm sick of all of you.

92
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,988
Yeah, just because Winston's rich,
you come to him?

93
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:04,990
Winston will help you.

94
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,993
Well, I'm sick of that.
And I'm especially sick of you.

95
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,995
Wanna leave?
Take your ass out of here.

96
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,998
But don't you come back to my door.
And you will be back.

97
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,000
It's all about money with you.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,003
It's all it ever is.
I don't need your money.

99
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,006
- I don't need your car.
- Give me my goddamn keys.

100
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,008
Walk, nigga.

101
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,011
Only thing I need
is to get away from you.

102
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:30,015
And I ain't coming back here.
You ain't got to worry about that.

103
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,018
What you looking at?

104
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,980
Nothing.

105
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,984
Absolutely nothing.

106
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,991
That's for you, Ma.

107
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,993
What you say?

108
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,997
- I see why Mom took herself out.
- Motherfucker, I will kill you, nigga.

109
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,000
Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off of me.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,002
Boy, get the fuck away from my house.

111
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,005
I loved your mother.
I took good care of your mother.

112
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:41,003
No, he didn't just kill that cockroach
and just walked off like nothing happened.

113
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,006
Oh, that's a bit.

114
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,010
Do a bit on finding a new apartment.

115
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,014
Well, I say to the apartment manager,
"I thought you said no pets."

116
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:54,016
And he says, "Correct, no pets."

117
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,018
I say:

118
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:59,021
"Guess them cockroaches
don't count as pets, huh?

119
00:07:59,021 --> 00:07:59,980
They're bigger than baby shoes."

120
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,985
Hey, guys.
Let's get this stuff on the truck.

121
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,993
I just moved here from Fresno.

122
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,996
Y'all got a lot of crime in L.A.

123
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,999
Crime's so bad out here, they don't ask,
"What's miss...?" I mean...

124
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,003
They don't ask, "What's happening?"
No more, they ask, "What's missing?"

125
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,008
Crazy, y'all, it's crazy.

126
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,010
I was at the store the other day...

127
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:35,015
I mean, "supermarket,"
y'all call it out here in L.A.

128
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,017
- And I'm eating up all the samples.

129
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,020
And this dude... This dude said to me...

130
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,981
Make that paper and plastic.

131
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,990
You ain't shit...

132
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,992
...and you ain't never gonna be shit.

133
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,997
Okay.

134
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,001
All right, come on, give it up.
Reggie Sinclaire. That was Reggie Sinclaire.

135
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,003
Thank you, Reggie.

136
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,006
The next Chris Rock.

137
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,008
Ladies and gentlemen,
the management of The Last Stand...

138
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,011
...would like to ask for cooperation
in the following:

139
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,013
Keep your conversations to a minimum.

140
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,015
Don't yell out at the acts.

141
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,017
And put your cell phones on silent.

142
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,020
Ladies, you might wanna
put yours on vibrate.

143
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,983
All right, it is my pressure...
I mean, pleasure...

144
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:26,984
...to introduce our next comedian.

145
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:28,986
You've seen him on Judge Mathis.

146
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,989
You've seen him on Court TV.

147
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,991
Give a nice welcome to Bo Clark.

148
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,994
Ladies and gentlemen, Bo Clark.

149
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:41,999
Did you see the jumper?

150
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,002
- I saw him bounce.
- Yeah, but he didn't stick the landing.

151
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,005
That's definitely a two-point reduction.
Everybody knows that.

152
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,008
You have to take into account
the difficulty of the jump.

153
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,014
As you can see, Jerry,
everything here is a big joke.

154
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:02,019
Reporting live from this tragic scene
at The Last Stand, I'm Shawne Baxter.

155
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,012
Cheryl.

156
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,003
Bo. Bo!

157
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,005
- Wake your ass up.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Rob.

158
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,008
- Get moving and get back to work.
- I'm sorry, Rob.

159
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,011
- I didn't get any sleep last night. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, right.

160
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,014
So how many jobs you got now, Bo?

161
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,018
- Mind your business, bitch.
- Hey, homey, check it out.

162
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,980
It's dinner for your wife and kid, dog.

163
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,984
Everybody, get back to work.

164
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,987
And you, man,
you need to get your shit together.

165
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,989
Between all these jobs
and this late-night comedy crap...

166
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,992
...step it up, or me and you
gonna have problems.

167
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:43,996
It's not gonna be a problem. Okay?
I got this. It's just...

168
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,998
Look, I really need this job, okay?

169
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:50,002
I just moved in with my mother-in-law,
so that's an extra mouth to feed...

170
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,003
Son, look...

171
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:55,007
...I know you're not trying to be
a dishwasher for the rest of your life.

172
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,010
But you're gonna kill yourself
doing all these jobs.

173
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:02,014
I feel you, Rob. Feel you.
But good looking out, man.

174
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,017
It's a good crowd out there tonight.
Lot of couples.

175
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,020
Lot of people with dates and stuff.
It's good.

176
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,980
Relationships are always cool.

177
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,983
Hey, G-Spot, how come
you have no girlfriend, man?

178
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:16,987
How you expect me to get a girlfriend
with your hand halfway up my ass?

179
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,996
My hand's not up your ass, G-Spot.

180
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,999
Smell your fingers. They smell like shit.

181
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,010
Stop it. Stop it. Stick to the script.

182
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,012
You know the script.

183
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,017
Let's go over here.

184
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,019
Let's go over here.

185
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,980
- That's my baby.
- Yeah, when he's bad, he's your boy.

186
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,982
- No, that's my baby.
- Yeah, okay.

187
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,984
He's cute too, right?

188
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,986
That, he does get from me.

189
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,988
Like his daddy.

190
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,993
- I wanna talk to you about something.
- Okay.

191
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,998
I'm really tired of this.

192
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:10,999
Tired of what?

193
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,005
Look, baby...

194
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,008
I can't continue washing dishes...

195
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:24,012
...and throwing newspapers
and delivering pizzas for the rest of my life.

196
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,014
Acting is gonna be our way out.

197
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,017
Bo, acting is not paying the bills.

198
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,019
Can't you just support me for once?

199
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,981
- I am supporting you.
- No, no, you're not.

200
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,985
I'm out here busting my ass
while you sit in the house.

201
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,988
I got three jobs, Cheryl.
How many you got?

202
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,990
I'm raising your son.

203
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:48,996
That's a job in itself. I mean, you act
like I sit at home doing nothing all day.

204
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:53,000
Bo, you're not even home enough
to see what I do.

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,002
You come in,
you plop down on the couch...

206
00:13:55,002 --> 00:14:00,007
...you hold Ahmad for like 10 minutes,
and you think you've done something.

207
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,011
Come on, please don't question what I do.
I work hard with our son.

208
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,012
All right, baby...

209
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,014
...your mom helps you out.

210
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,017
You wanna be real with it.

211
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:13,020
Okay, I just... I don't see
why you can't get a part-time job.

212
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,981
Sometimes I wonder
why we even did this.

213
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,983
Did what?

214
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:18,984
This.

215
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,986
This marriage thing.

216
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,989
I could really be doing a lot better.

217
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,991
Really?

218
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:30,996
Baby, black actors starve
and so do their families.

219
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:35,000
My uncle told you
about that position at FedEx last week.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,003
- It's a full-time position.
- Cheryl. That's not what I wanna do.

221
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,006
- I don't wanna...
- Bo, they got benefits.

222
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,009
And it's not about you
and what you wanna do anymore.

223
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,012
You got a child and a wife
to think about.

224
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,014
And we need some security.

225
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:52,017
I'm tired of taking Ahmad
to those Medicaid doctors.

226
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,019
You... You're refusing to listen.

227
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,980
It's, like, not...

228
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,983
It's impossible talking to you.

229
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,992
And then you got dry lips.
Get something for your lips.

230
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:09,993
Get a ginger ale?

231
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,997
You ever seen somebody's lips so dry,
it make you put on your ChapStick?

232
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,003
- Thank you.
- Tough crowd.

233
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,006
Yeah, I know.

234
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,008
That's the nastiest, ain't it?

235
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,010
Reggie Sinclaire?

236
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,011
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

237
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,014
- What's up?
- What's up, man?

238
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,016
Tru Dogg Kincaid, that's me.

239
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,019
Tru Dogg?

240
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,981
- Yeah, I speaks the truth, dog.
- Okay.

241
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:41,984
It's hard to hear in here, let's go on top.

242
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:43,986
What's that?

243
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,988
It's next door
where the comedians hang out.

244
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:46,989
Okay, all right.

245
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,991
- So bad, you can't say nothing to him?

246
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,993
Only thing you can do is frown at him.

247
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,996
- They be like, "What up...?"
- Thanks, man.

248
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,003
What's this, man?

249
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,005
This is our stage.
This is where we work out.

250
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:06,008
- Before we take it to the real stage.
- For real?

251
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,013
It's kind of close to the edge, ain't it?

252
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,015
That's how we live.

253
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,019
It's beautiful up here.

254
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,981
Audience didn't seem to be paying
too much attention tonight.

255
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:25,986
- Maybe because it was the dinner show.
- Yeah, maybe I just wasn't that funny.

256
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,990
I ain't trying to give you
advice and stuff...

257
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,993
...but you gotta be
a little more street with yours.

258
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,997
No matter how you look at it, that's
what them white folks are expecting.

259
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,999
Where I've been,
you gotta be street all the time.

260
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,002
- Where you been?
- Let's say a place you don't wanna go.

261
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,005
Yeah, where's that?

262
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,010
Prison.

263
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,013
I just got out.

264
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,017
That's good. Put that in your act.

265
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:01,980
You serious?

266
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,982
Yeah.

267
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,987
My bad.

268
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:11,990
What for, man? Do you mind?

269
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:13,992
No, that's a long story.

270
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,995
Let's say I was at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

271
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,997
Hanging out with the wrong crowd.

272
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,999
Just being young and dumb.

273
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,001
Thought I was hard.

274
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,003
Couldn't tell me shit.

275
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,006
But it be's like that sometime,
you know I mean?

276
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,009
It's tough, man.

277
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,013
In there, you gotta watch your back 24/7,
and your ass.

278
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,016
I bet.

279
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,981
Hey, yo, Kevin, man, bring me a beer.

280
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,989
What was you doing up there, man?

281
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,992
What was you doing?
You know the fucking lines, G-Spot.

282
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,994
Stick to the fucking script!

283
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:57,995
You always...

284
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,999
You do what you wanna do
all the time. What?

285
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:06,003
Don't you motherfuck...
Don't fucking embarrass me!

286
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:13,010
You're fucking embarrassing us,
you know that?

287
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,013
I e-mailed you the fucking script.
Read your e-mails!

288
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:20,017
This next guy you probably bought weed
and a fish sandwich from...

289
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,018
...at the local beauty parlor.

290
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:24,980
Put your hands together for TD,
Tru Dogg Kincaid.

291
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,984
Give it up for him. Tru Dogg.

292
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:37,993
Hey, don't I know you?

293
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:38,994
Yeah, yeah, I know you.

294
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,996
Yeah, you was locked up with us.

295
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,999
Yeah, I recognize the back of your head.

296
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:52,007
Hey, Tru. Two more days, baby.

297
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,008
Yeah, nigga.

298
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,011
I can't wait to get back
in your mom's arms again.

299
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,015
Oh, my God, nigga, let me tell you
something about your mama.

300
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:05,020
Her titties hang so low
that she kicks her nipples when she walk.

301
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,981
Nigga, your mother's so black,
they use her bath water...

302
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,984
...to dye bowling balls.

303
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:14,988
Really fucked up, man.

304
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,991
You know, my accountant,
he's not very bright.

305
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,993
I had to stop working with him.

306
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:23,997
Because he thought that American Express
was a parcel delivery service.

307
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,000
Told you, man, fucked up.

308
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,003
My mom was always talking about
how she wanted me to be something.

309
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,006
How she wanted me to go to college.

310
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,007
Shit, I went to college.

311
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:38,011
I was there the other day,
dropping one of my homeboys off.

312
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:44,017
Thank you, that's my time, everybody.
Goodnight, y'all.

313
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,980
Tru Dogg Kincaid.

314
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,983
Give it up for him.

315
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,986
Yeah. I've been having trouble
getting dates. I don't know what it is.

316
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:56,989
My friends said
I should lower my standards...

317
00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:00,993
...but if I lower my standards any more,
I'm gonna be sucking cock. Anyway...

318
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,995
Thank you.

319
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,999
Straight out of Brooklyn,
New York City...

320
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,001
...give it up for Dede Calvin.

321
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:13,005
She's gorgeous. Give it up. Dede Calvin.

322
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:16,008
What's up? How y'all feeling tonight?

323
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,014
Mom.

324
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:25,017
Ma.

325
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,019
- Yes, honey.
- I wanna talk to you.

326
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,021
I'm listening.

327
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:33,984
This whole teaching thing
is becoming like a job to me.

328
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,988
Don't get me wrong, because
I really love working with the kids.

329
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:41,992
But it says here in the book
that he discovered America.

330
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,994
Well, I know, sweetie, but the truth is...

331
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:48,999
...Christopher Columbus showed up in
America after it had already been discovered.

332
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:53,003
I think the only good thing that happened
was he received some reward points...

333
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,005
...on his frequent-sailing miles.

334
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,008
Should have brought
his Discover Card, huh?

335
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:03,013
- You're so funny, Miss Calvin.
- Well, thank you. Let's get to work.

336
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,015
I'm an actress.

337
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,017
I'm a comedian.

338
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,019
So I just moved out here.

339
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,980
Yeah, I just moved out here.
Straight out of Brooklyn.

340
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,984
Yeah. My first time
being out on my own.

341
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,986
I'm happy to be here in L.A. With y'all.

342
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,989
You know, I had a big altercation
with my mother.

343
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,992
Yeah, she didn't wanna let me go,
that whole separation-anxiety thing.

344
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,996
I was like, "Mom, I'm 30 years old.

345
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:33,001
I gotta get the fuck out, you know.
Yeah, gotta do my own thing."

346
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,003
You know, so I sat her down. I said:

347
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:39,007
"You know, I'm not a child.
Okay. Let's be real. I'm a grown woman.

348
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,009
A grown-ass woman, you know.

349
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:45,013
And I'm perfectly capable of making
grown-ass-woman-type decisions.

350
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,017
I mean, at the end of the day, come on,
I know what wine goes with Twinkies."

351
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,980
The only acting you've ever done
was in a high school play.

352
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,982
What do you know about acting?

353
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:57,985
- What do I know about acting?
- Yes.

354
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,989
My entire life has been an act.

355
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,992
Everything about me is an act.

356
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,995
I acted like it was okay
when you forced me to go to college...

357
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,997
...for this decent salary.

358
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:10,998
I acted like it was okay...

359
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:15,002
...when my daddy walked his black ass
out that door when I was 10 years old.

360
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,003
And you know what else?

361
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:20,007
I acted like it was okay when your boyfriend
would sneak into my room.

362
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,009
Stop! Don't you go there!

363
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,012
Stop that.

364
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:29,016
I'm sorry about that. How many times
do we have to talk about that?

365
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,995
Black people, do me a favor.

366
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,997
Have a life goal.
Do something with your lives.

367
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:58,003
Just strive, you know, for something
other than The Maury Povich Show.

368
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:01,006
Yeah. Yeah. That's where they do
the DNA testing...

369
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:05,010
...where they bring, like,
five to 10 different men on...

370
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,014
...to find out which one of them
is father of your child.

371
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:14,019
I need for y'all to think outside the box
just a little bit. Yeah.

372
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,985
This motherfucker.

373
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:26,990
Okay.

374
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,994
Now, when you find out that none of them
is the father of your child...

375
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,996
...you take off running backstage.

376
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,999
Start kicking and screaming
and crawling and yelling...

377
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:39,002
...like you didn't know
that he wasn't the father.

378
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,003
But we all knew.

379
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,005
Because Pookie don't look like him.

380
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:46,009
Pookie don't look like none of them.
That's my time, y'all.

381
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,010
I'm Dede Calvin.

382
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:54,017
- Hey, hey, you were great.
- Oh, thanks.

383
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,020
What kind of wine goes with Twinkies?

384
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,981
- I beg your pardon?
- The wine. Twinkies.

385
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:02,985
Would you suggest a Pinot Noir?
Or maybe a nice Riesling?

386
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:03,986
It's the critic, the walker.

387
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:05,988
The motherfucker.

388
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,991
- Yeah, I think I did say that, didn't I?
- Yeah.

389
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:10,993
Let's not get off on the wrong foot.

390
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:14,997
The reason I got up early was so I could be
the first one to talk to you.

391
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,999
Everybody's talking hip-hop now.

392
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:20,002
Even my grandmother's like,
"I'm rolling with my homeys to bingo.

393
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:25,007
Touch those cookies
and I'll bust a cap in your ass."

394
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,009
I asked my grandmother
why she cheats at bingo.

395
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,012
She's like, "Hey, hate the game,
not the player."

396
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:34,016
So you could convince me
of what a nice guy you are, right?

397
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,018
No, no, no. I'm a prick, for sure.

398
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,981
But those who know me would say
that deep down, I'm a nice prick.

399
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:44,985
Okay, well, nice to meet you, prick.
But I gotta go to work tomorrow.

400
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,988
I'm Scott Jacobs with ICC.

401
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,994
Dede Calvin, I see you.

402
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,996
That's cute. You're cute.

403
00:24:56,997 --> 00:25:00,000
And I gotta tell you,
from what I saw up there tonight...

404
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,003
...you have a lot of potential.
- Hopefully to be more than just cute.

405
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,006
We'll see. Do you have a second?

406
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:11,011
Well, for Hollywood's most powerful agent,
I think I can spare a second.

407
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,013
You've heard of me, huh?

408
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,015
Well, who hasn't heard of you?

409
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,017
You flatter me.

410
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,019
What's your name?

411
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,979
Sparkle.

412
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:25,984
Black people...

413
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:30,989
...stop naming your motherfucking kids
after cars...

414
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,993
...alcohol, constellations...

415
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,996
...and motherfucking clothes, all right?

416
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,998
I'm serious.

417
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,000
Look, the other day,
I met this chick, right?

418
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:49,007
Her name was Alexis Alizé
Sparkle Prada Jackson.

419
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,010
How the fuck that gonna look
on an application?

420
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,013
I gotta tell you,
I think you have a lot of talent.

421
00:25:55,013 --> 00:26:01,019
What you don't have is representation,
and maybe I can change all that.

422
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:04,982
You're gonna need someone
in this town to guide your career.

423
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:06,984
It can be a rough place, rough people.
Understand?

424
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:08,986
Yeah.

425
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,989
I want you to call the office
and make an appointment.

426
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,992
Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Jacobs.

427
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:16,994
You're very welcome.

428
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,997
That shit don't make no sense,
I'm just saying.

429
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:23,000
Other day I was in the supermarket,
right?

430
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,002
Walked up to this kid,
"What's up, little man?"

431
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:27,004
He said, "How you know my name?"

432
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:32,009
Stop doing this shit to your kids.
Stop it.

433
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:34,011
Get that motherfucker
another drink right there.

434
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,013
That motherfucker know comedy.

435
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:38,015
- You catch my act?
- Oh, my bad, man.

436
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:42,019
I was going over my act, man.

437
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,021
Want something to drink?
They're free for the comedians.

438
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,982
Oh, no, I don't drink, man.
I'll take a ginger ale.

439
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:51,987
- Come on, man, are you sure?
- Yeah, trust me, I'm sure.

440
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:55,991
I got a lot of material
from being inside.

441
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:57,993
It's all up in here.

442
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,996
- I bet.
- But it's all over the damn place.

443
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:05,000
Maybe we could get together.
You can help me shape it.

444
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,003
- We could help each other.
- A writing session or something?

445
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:10,005
That's cool. Let me get your number,
we'll hook up.

446
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:14,009
I ain't exactly got a phone right now.
I'm getting ready to move out of the Y.

447
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:16,011
Soon as I find a place I can afford.

448
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,014
Ain't nothing but a bunch of damn bums
in there anyway.

449
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:21,016
You're staying at the Y, man?

450
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:32,986
You got some money, man? I mean,
think you can afford, like, 225 a month?

451
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,988
For what?

452
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,991
I got a couch.
I could use some help on the rent.

453
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:44,998
- Yeah, yeah. Hell, yeah. I can swing that.
- All right, all right.

454
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,001
Cool. Well, consider us roommates.

455
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,003
Tru Dogg.

456
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,005
Yeah, that's what's up.
Reg Sinclaire to the rescue.

457
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,008
- It's all good.
- I'll drink to that.

458
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,014
Yeah, that's Greg Rant. Local bite comedian
according to everybody around here.

459
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:05,018
- Bite comedian? What, he steals?
- Well, only your good stuff.

460
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,020
Since you don't have anything,
you're safe.

461
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,982
Oh, you got jokes. Yeah.

462
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,985
He touch any of my joints,
I'm gonna break his jaw.

463
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:17,990
But I do know what wine
goes good with Twinkies.

464
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,994
Y'all gotta answer a question for me.

465
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:25,998
Why do we do our kids a disservice
by what we name them?

466
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:29,001
Kijuana.

467
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,003
Radisha.

468
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:33,005
I go in a grocery store the other day.

469
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:36,008
I see this little boy playing.
I say, "What's up, little man?"

470
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:39,011
He like, "How you know my name?"

471
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:43,015
I was like, "I don't, man.
But I guess I do now."

472
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:48,020
Look, I'm Greg Rant, I'll see y'all later.
I'm the best in the world right here.

473
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,983
That's your bed. The couch.

474
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:56,987
In here, man. I cleared some space
in the closet for the rest of your clothes.

475
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,990
And the first drawer of the dresser,
put the rest of your stuff.

476
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,993
I mean, I know it ain't much, but...

477
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,996
Hey, man, I've been in worse.

478
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,999
- Yeah.
- Hey, man, look.

479
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,003
You ain't that crazy about my acts, huh?

480
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:16,006
Hey, I don't know.
I ain't the one to judge.

481
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:20,010
I know, I know, I know. It's just sometimes
I get uncomfortable on-stage, man.

482
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:24,014
It's like everybody's looking at you.
It's like they're saying, you know:

483
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:28,018
"Be funny. Be funny. Be funny."
And it's like I be bugging, man.

484
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,020
Yeah, man. I feel you.

485
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,981
Hey, have one.

486
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,984
No, I can't, man. I had my bout
with the bottle back in high school...

487
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:40,989
...amongst a whole bunch of other things.
I mean, I was wilding out. Out there.

488
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,991
I had to quit, man.
Gave it up, cold turkey.

489
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,994
Don't come to the club
if you ain't gonna laugh. What the fuck?

490
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,997
How you gonna come
to a motherfucking comedy club...

491
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:52,000
...and not wanna motherfucking laugh
at a joke?

492
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,003
Some bullshit. You ain't all that, motherfu...
You're cute.

493
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,005
I mean, you're cute. Okay? Shit.

494
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:00,008
You ain't all that fine, though,
to be up there, "Motherfucker."

495
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,013
See, man, that's my problem.
I can't deal with hecklers, man.

496
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,015
- I can't.
- Personal attacks work.

497
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,018
You gotta make the attacks
work for you and not against you.

498
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,980
Talk about their mamas,
their daddies and their clothes.

499
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,982
That ain't me, man. I can't do that.

500
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,985
I suck at improv.
You? You like a Gatling gun of insults.

501
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,988
Your mama... your daddy... your fat uncle.
Come on, man.

502
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:24,992
That's because for the last 12 years,
my audience has been murderers...

503
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:25,993
...gangbangers and rapists.

504
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:28,996
Tell a joke in there and it goes bad,
gotta throw up your hands.

505
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:34,001
That's why I don't get upset when
a handful of drunks don't laugh. So what?

506
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,003
Least I ain't gotta worry
about getting shanked.

507
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,005
Think I should get arrested?

508
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:44,011
I'm bullshitting, man. All right, man.
No, I'm out, man.

509
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,013
Reg.

510
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,015
- Stop stealing, man.
- What?

511
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:52,019
Come on, man. Trying to make the
apartment look sexy for the ladies, Dogg.

512
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:54,980
They love these lamps, man.
That's why the club got them.

513
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:57,983
Stop stealing, Reg.

514
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,012
Yes.

515
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,980
What's up, fellas?

516
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,982
- Hey, what's going on?
- Y'all get bumped again?

517
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:21,984
Yep.

518
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,987
You know Buddy be hating on anybody
who gets big laughs.

519
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:27,990
I don't get it. Why does he have
so much control over who goes on stage?

520
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,993
Because he's fucking the owner.

521
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,996
This shit is crazy. We come out here
every night till 2 in the morning...

522
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:38,000
...just to get five minutes on-stage
in front of a bunch of drunks.

523
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,002
Yeah, and then this punk bumps us.

524
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:43,005
Hey, ladies and gentlemen.

525
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:44,006
Miss De... What's your last name?

526
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:46,008
It's Calvin.

527
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:49,011
- Did your thing up there.
- Oh, thank you very much.

528
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:51,013
Yeah, you were great.

529
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:53,015
Look, I'm Bo.

530
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:54,016
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

531
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,018
This is TD, Mr. Announcer, right here.

532
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:59,021
- And it's Reggie, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

533
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:04,985
I ain't trying to sound corny.
But we should look out for one another.

534
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:07,988
Just gotta make sure
we have each other's backs.

535
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:08,989
Well, you can count me in.

536
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,992
- Me too.
- I'm down.

537
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:14,995
What we need to try to do
is start demanding more stage time.

538
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,997
That's what's gonna get it, you know?

539
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:18,999
Keep in contact with each other,
do something, man.

540
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,003
Call me. You can call me anytime.

541
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:29,009
You can get at me and TD
with this number.

542
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:32,012
Until Mr. Announcer here
decides to get a phone.

543
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:35,015
I'm trying to get a job first,
then I'll get a phone.

544
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,017
Yeah, I see you got
the same phone as me, huh?

545
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:40,979
Oh, yeah, my mother got it for me.
She likes the paging feature on it.

546
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:44,983
My wife, she loves the paging feature.
Oh, joy.

547
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:47,986
I'll give you my Direct Connect
and then you can chirp me.

548
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:48,987
Yeah, all right.

549
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,990
Hey, how can I Direct Connect you?

550
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,992
You're gonna have to use the phone.

551
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:57,996
Oh, I see. So you're saying,
if I call you 3:00 in the morning...

552
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,999
...and ask what you're wearing,
you gonna tell me?

553
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,002
- See, you're a nut.
- Oh, see, I got a joke for that one too.

554
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:07,005
But I won't say it,
unless you wanna hear it.

555
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,989
Last night was one of my best shows.
I had a heckler.

556
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,992
This guy with his wife. I said,
"She left her shoes under my bed."

557
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:19,995
Hey, what the hell is going on here?

558
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,998
You guys get back to work.

559
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:25,000
Hey, Sinclaire.

560
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,002
How many breaks do you need a day?

561
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:30,005
Come on, boss, if you let me smoke
my weed when I'm clocked in...

562
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:33,008
...I wouldn't need so many breaks.
I'm just joking.

563
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,010
You know what, man?
I am not playing with you.

564
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:40,015
Well, that's because you're used
to playing with yourself, boss.

565
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:44,019
That's why nobody shakes your hand.
You haven't noticed that? I'm just joking.

566
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,980
Come on, get the hell in there.
Get over there.

567
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,983
That's the jack-off hand, man.
Don't be touching me with that hand.

568
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,989
What's up, Reg? You ain't work today?

569
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,991
Reg.

570
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:01,995
- You ain't working today?
- Oh, no, man.

571
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:04,998
Foreman gave me
the rest of the year off, man.

572
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:07,000
- Without pay.
- Word.

573
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,002
He had it in for me anyway.
He didn't like me.

574
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:12,005
He was waiting for an excuse
to fire my ass, I gave him one.

575
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:15,008
- Fuck him.
- What's this? "Call DJ."

576
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,010
My parole officer.
When did this come in?

577
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,013
Shit, I don't know, man.
Last Thursday, Friday.

578
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:21,014
- What?
- Forgot to tell you.

579
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:24,017
Goddamn it, what is wrong with you?
You slipping?

580
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:27,020
Oh, man. I said I'm sorry, man.
I forgot to tell you, I'm sorry.

581
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,982
- Be happy I wrote the thing down.
- Be happy you wrote it down?

582
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:33,986
That's the least you could do for me
after all the shit I do for you.

583
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:36,989
I sit around, helping you
with your tired-ass jokes.

584
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:39,992
- Oh, my jokes are tired.
- This is serious. This is my life.

585
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:41,994
Come on, man,
going on with all that bullshit, man.

586
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:45,998
You didn't call for a couple of days,
just tell him you was out gigging.

587
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,000
Just think of some jokes, man.
That ain't no big...

588
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,003
I know what the fuck is wrong with you.
"Oh, yeah, TD.

589
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:54,006
I went cold turkey, I don't drink.
I got it under control."

590
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:55,007
Look at you, sitting here, drunk.

591
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:59,011
I got control of this shit, man.
I got control of this mess.

592
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:01,013
This is my life you're fucking with,
not yours.

593
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:04,016
- My fault you didn't call that parole officer?
- Stealing shit.

594
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:07,019
- So what, man? So what? So what?
- Fuck you.

595
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:09,021
Man, don't kick my couch, man.

596
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:11,982
Tired-ass jokes. My couch wasn't tired
when I let your ass sleep here.

597
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:13,984
Reg, you slipping, man.
You fucking slipping.

598
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:15,986
Yeah, well, look. Look at me slip.

599
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:18,989
I'm drinking to slipping.
I'm drinking to slipping.

600
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:22,993
We're slipping. We're tripping and slipping
and dipping, nigga. So what, bitch?

601
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:35,005
I'd like to say hi to my wife who's...
She's here tonight.

602
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:38,008
- Give it for her, y'all. Yeah.
- Yeah.

603
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:41,011
Yeah. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.

604
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:44,014
Thank God my girlfriend isn't here.

605
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:48,018
This is the first time she's seen me perform.
Know why?

606
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:51,980
Because I'm not that good in bed.
I'm gonna be honest with you.

607
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,981
Oh, well.

608
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:59,988
It's hard, man. Marriage.
It's... It's work. You know?

609
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:03,992
It's tough to make love when
our 2-year-old son is in the bed with us.

610
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:07,996
You know. It's like... Don't give me none...
I love my son. You know?

611
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:09,998
That's my heart, but my wife, she's like:

612
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:13,001
"Bo, baby, it gives me such a,
you know, warm feeling...

613
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:16,004
...just to know that our son
is close to us at night."

614
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:19,007
I said, "Baby, that warm feeling
is Ahmad pissing on us again.

615
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:21,009
Girl, what you talking about?"

616
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:24,012
Well, it's better than getting shitted on.

617
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:29,017
Okay, now, who said that?

618
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:32,020
You can call me "master" if you like.

619
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,984
That's a first, a racist heckler.

620
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:39,987
Aren't you late for a Klan meeting
or something?

621
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:43,991
I'm no racist. I resent that, friend.
But I'll buy you a drink anyway.

622
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,993
No. No. That won't be necessary.

623
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:51,999
Bartender. Get my man here
one of those watermelon-flavored martinis.

624
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:58,005
Hey. I'm not gonna finish all these wings.
You want some wings?

625
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:01,008
Listen, I'm Bo Clark.

626
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,009
Good night.

627
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:16,982
Hey, Dede. Dede.
Did you see who was heckling me?

628
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,984
No, I just got here. Wanna go up top?

629
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:21,987
No, I can't. I gotta find my wife,
go to work. I'll talk to you later.

630
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,990
Okay. Bye.

631
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,992
I'll go up top with you, baby.

632
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:30,996
What?

633
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:31,997
Bitch.

634
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,003
Hey, look at this dude right here.

635
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:41,006
Look at this dude. He...
What are you? What are you?

636
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:43,008
I'm white.

637
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:47,012
"White." I know that.

638
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:50,015
What you do for a living?

639
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:52,017
- I'm a lawyer.
- A lawyer.

640
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:55,979
I figured that. That's why your cheap ass
is sitting there drinking water.

641
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:03,987
Who is the broad you got next to you?
Is this your secretary, your wife? What?

642
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:06,990
- My wife.
- Wife of a lawyer.

643
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,995
Now, she's probably the only one
you don't fuck.

644
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:18,001
Hey, Reggie Sinclaire.
Give it up for him. Big Reggie.

645
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:21,004
Oh, Reggie, my man.
Reggie, come over here for a second.

646
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:23,006
- Come on. Come on, over here.
- He ain't that good.

647
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:26,009
I know, but we gotta fill that hole
in the tour, eh?

648
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,011
TD would've been perfect
but parole is killing me.

649
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:32,015
- What about that chick Dede?
- Jacobs wants her to sign with ICC.

650
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:34,017
What chances have we got
if she does that?

651
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:37,020
- I don't have a problem with Jacobs.
- He's got a problem with you.

652
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,980
- He hates your guts.
- Listen.

653
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:40,983
- Martin Lawrence made that decision.
- Whatever.

654
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:43,986
Okay, here he comes.
Reg, I'm Marty.

655
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:44,987
- How are you doing?
- This is Art.

656
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:47,990
- Hey, funny guy.
- Very funny guy.

657
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:51,994
Listen. We're putting together a circuit,
sort of a club Def Comedy Jam...

658
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,997
...and we're putting together
some up-and-coming comics.

659
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:56,999
- Up-and-coming.
- And we think you're a perfect fit.

660
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:59,001
Perfect. Perfect.

661
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,003
- Yep.
- You serious?

662
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:04,006
No, I just pulled that out of my ass.
Yeah. Yeah.

663
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:08,010
Hey, we think you could do this.
Tru Dogg said you were perfect for this.

664
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,013
- That's my roommate, yeah.
- It's not paying a lot, but it's exposure...

665
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:14,016
...and you can work out your flaws.
- There you go.

666
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:17,019
I have flaws?

667
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:21,982
What he's trying to say is that we think
you have this real quality of being real.

668
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,985
Yeah, and your ability to improv
is incredible.

669
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:26,987
You know what I'm talking about?

670
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:30,991
Listen. Everybody, and I mean everybody,
has to fine-tune their stuff. You hear me?

671
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:34,995
You can work on adding some stronger
material. Bigger jokes. Bigger jokes.

672
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:38,999
This is what you gotta do: You gotta
pay somebody to tweak up your act.

673
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:41,001
You know, just punch up the jokes.

674
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:44,004
I appreciate that, but I already have
somebody I'm working with.

675
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:45,005
I'm cool, really.

676
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:49,009
Hey, look, call us at the office tomorrow
and we'll give you the itinerary, huh?

677
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,012
- Funny guy. Funny guy.
- Very funny guy.

678
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,014
I appreciate it, thank you.

679
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:56,016
- He's not very funny.
- You're right. He's not funny.

680
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,979
- Do that shit in your house, man.
- TD, what's up, man?

681
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:01,980
Hey, what's up, Reg?

682
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,983
They told me what was up, man.
Good looking out.

683
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:07,986
No doubt, that's what we do.
We got each other's back. It's all right.

684
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,989
- You're good. I appreciate it.
- I'm gonna get dressed.

685
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,991
- I'll meet you up on top.
- We gonna celebrate?

686
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,994
Yeah, man. Do your thing, baby.
That's you, blow up.

687
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:16,995
- I'm trying.
- I'm proud of you.

688
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:17,996
- Yes, sir.
- All right?

689
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:20,999
- We gonna throw some back, man. My man.
- All right.

690
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:24,002
- Smile.
- I'm good.

691
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:28,006
Hey, Reg. Reg. Reg.

692
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:30,008
Come on.
Hear we got something to celebrate.

693
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:32,010
What's up, Jay?
What you celebrating?

694
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,012
Come on. We're going on tour together.

695
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,014
- Are you going too?
- Yes, right.

696
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:39,017
- When did you find out?
- Don't worry about that, man.

697
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:41,019
- All right.
- All right.

698
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:42,020
Get a little blast, man.

699
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,982
No, I'm cool. I ain't had that shit
since high school.

700
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:47,985
Come on, man.
One celebration bump, man.

701
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:49,987
Stop being a bitch.

702
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:51,989
All right, all right, all right.

703
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,991
- Hold up. How I do this shit, man?
- Sniff, nigga.

704
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:56,994
Sniff. There you go.

705
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,996
God. Damn, nigga.

706
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:04,001
Oh, nigga, you ain't got to cry.

707
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:10,007
Celebrate.

708
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:14,011
Hey, y'all ready for this?

709
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:18,015
I am going on tour.

710
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:22,019
Winston's boy is going on tour.

711
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,021
I'm happy for you, man.

712
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,982
Thanks for that spot.

713
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:27,983
I appreciate that, brother.

714
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:30,986
- Thank you, for real.
- No problem, just looking out.

715
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:32,988
Thanks.

716
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:37,993
What's up with you, man?
Why you give up your spot?

717
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,997
Dede needed a favor. She asked me to let
Bo showcase for an agent or something.

718
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:45,000
What's the problem? We're supposed
to look out for one another.

719
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:49,004
I know all that, man, but this is different.
I mean, you're gonna let him showcase?

720
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:52,007
You should be showcasing, man.

721
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:56,011
Oh, I see, you're getting your head right.
That's what's wrong with you.

722
00:43:57,012 --> 00:44:01,016
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
Why are you always in my business?

723
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:04,019
- Are you drunk or on something?
- On something? I ain't on nothing.

724
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:06,980
Then don't fuck this up.
This is the opportunity...

725
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,981
...to show people what you can do.

726
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:10,984
Why you sweating me about this?
You gave up your spot.

727
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:12,986
I didn't give up shit.

728
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,988
You know I can't leave this county.

729
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,990
You guys are in the middle
of something...

730
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,993
...so I just wanted to say thank you
for the spot.

731
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:20,994
And we're gonna head on out.

732
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:23,997
Goodbye, Miss Super-Agent.

733
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:25,999
- Are you talking to me?
- Reg, chill.

734
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,003
No, no, no. Aren't you a talent agent,
talent scout and stuff?

735
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:32,005
Reggie, be easy, man.

736
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:35,008
Hey, TD, take this guy home, man.

737
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:38,011
Don't worry about him,
he's all fucked-up anyway.

738
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:39,012
- I'm fucked up? I'm fucked up.
- Yeah.

739
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:42,015
- TD, please take him home.
- I got him, I got him.

740
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:44,017
- All right.
- Oh, I know what it is.

741
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:46,019
I know what it is. Y'all jealous.

742
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,980
Oh, y'all are some haters.

743
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,984
Because I'm going on tour,
and you losers are staying local.

744
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:54,987
Losers? Are you out
of your fucking mind?

745
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:56,989
You a big man
because you're going on tour?

746
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:58,991
- Yeah.
- What's that? The Universal Studios tour?

747
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:00,993
Tour them lips around my nuts.

748
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:02,995
- Oh, that'll be a short-ass tour.
- Reg.

749
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:06,999
- Watch your fucking mouth.
- Get off me.

750
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:10,002
Get your hand off me.
You ain't my daddy.

751
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:13,005
No, I ain't your daddy.
That's who you are. That's the problem.

752
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:17,009
- I'm not my father.
- Look at you.

753
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:21,013
I don't know your father, but it seems
like he's still the one in control.

754
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:24,016
And you're using this to forget?

755
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:27,019
When I first met you, you said
you've been down this road before.

756
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:30,981
"Oh, yeah, I gave it up, cold turkey." Now
you downing half a bottle of Jack a day.

757
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,983
Look, I'm not my father.

758
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:34,985
I got this. I can control my liquor.

759
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:36,987
That's the way it starts, Reg.

760
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:39,990
You think you're in control
but you're not.

761
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,993
Every time you need something
to help make you better...

762
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:44,995
...proves you got a problem.

763
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:48,999
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
What are you preaching about now?

764
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,001
Always preaching:

765
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:54,004
Who the fuck are you? T.D. Jakes?

766
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:57,007
You act like you're clean...

767
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:59,009
...and you ain't done nothing.

768
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:01,011
Nigga, you was locked down.

769
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:03,013
Yeah, I said it.

770
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:05,015
Don't throw stones, man.

771
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:09,019
Don't you ever disrespect me
like that again.

772
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,981
Now, I'm gonna forget that you said that
because your ass is drunk.

773
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:15,984
Because, see, everybody around here
knows how you can't go on-stage...

774
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:17,986
...without taking a drink.

775
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:19,988
Everybody, huh?

776
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:21,990
Well, yeah. I go:

777
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:25,994
I'm gonna drink to that.

778
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:28,997
And everybody?
Everybody can kiss my ass.

779
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:33,001
That's right. You can kiss my ass.

780
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:36,004
Kiss my ass.

781
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:42,010
Reg, come on down, man.

782
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,020
Reg, come down from there, man.

783
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,985
I'm going on tour. You hear that, Daddy?

784
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:00,988
You hear that all the way in Fresno?

785
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:05,993
Winston's boy is going on tour.

786
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:07,995
- Hey, there's someone on the roof.
- Jump.

787
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:11,999
Jump, jump, jump.

788
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:16,003
Ain't nothing to play about.
Ain't nothing to play about, y'all.

789
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,005
He could have got hurt.

790
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:23,010
Please, Bo, fuck Reg.
His ass should have jumped, all right?

791
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:26,013
- Damn, Dede.
- All right, I'm just kidding.

792
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,014
I don't want him to jump.

793
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:32,019
Always telling me I ain't shit.
Well, I am the shit.

794
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:34,021
I am the shit.

795
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:40,986
You know I got something for you.

796
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:42,988
Give me my meth, man, okay?

797
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:45,991
Shit, you can't rush this.

798
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:46,992
Give me the snot.

799
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:51,997
They ask, "What's missing?"

800
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,006
See you out there.

801
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:30,994
- Hello?
- Hey, what's up, man?

802
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:34,998
- Hey, what's up, Reg?
- Hey, I just called to apologize, man.

803
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:37,000
- Don't sweat that.
- Yeah, I know, man.

804
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,002
Yo, let me tell you about the road, man.

805
00:48:39,002 --> 00:48:43,006
Oh, my God.
Dude, ain't nothing like road pussy, man.

806
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:45,008
I'm getting pussy almost every night.

807
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:48,011
That's good to hear.
Don't let the liquid confidence control you.

808
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:50,013
I'm taking advice
from a career criminal now?

809
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:52,015
Yeah, whatever, nigga.

810
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:54,017
Tell me what you think about this.

811
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,019
Friday, we're in Fresno, right?

812
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,980
And...

813
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:01,984
- You think I should invite my dad?
- Hell, yeah.

814
00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:04,987
That'll be big of you to be the first
to step up and make a move.

815
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:05,988
You think he'll come?

816
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:09,992
If he knew about it, and you invited him
and left him some tickets, he'd come.

817
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:11,994
- You invite your friends?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

818
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:13,996
All my boys are coming to support me.

819
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:16,999
Man, I would love to be there...

820
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:18,000
...but you know my situation.

821
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:20,002
Yeah, I know, man. I know, man.

822
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:22,004
I won't be home for a couple of weeks.

823
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:26,008
We got Bakersfield coming up, then
some little country town called Merced.

824
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:30,012
So I put the rent check in the mail.
It should be there in a couple of days.

825
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:33,015
That's it, man. I gotta go, but...

826
00:49:34,016 --> 00:49:35,017
Tru, you ain't gotta worry
about me, man.

827
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:37,019
All right? I'm clean.

828
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:39,021
You stay up out there, all right?

829
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:42,983
All right, man. Keep...
Keep holding down the fort, all right?

830
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:43,984
All right. Peace.

831
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:57,998
I'll be right back.

832
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,001
Excuse me. Excuse me.

833
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,002
Excuse me.

834
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:05,005
Hey, I'm Reggie.
I'm on the show tonight.

835
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:08,008
I left some passes for a Winston Sinclaire.

836
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:11,011
- Do you know if he picked them up?
- Let me look, okay?

837
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:15,015
- He has already picked them up early.
- He did?

838
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:18,018
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Next.

839
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,982
- Thank you.
- Reggie Sinclaire.

840
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:25,984
- Hi.
- What's up, man? How are you doing?

841
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:29,988
How you doing? Let's take it...
Hey, girl. You look good.

842
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:32,991
- You look good. What's going on?
- I'm good.

843
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:33,992
- Hey.
- Skinny.

844
00:50:34,993 --> 00:50:35,994
- Skinny?
- Yeah.

845
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:38,997
Life on the road. I can't get
a home-cooked meal like I want.

846
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:42,000
- Eat some cheeseburgers.
- Look like you had too many cheeseburgers.

847
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,003
- Oh, that's messed up. Excuse you.
- Oh, my God.

848
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:47,005
Excited to see you perform, man.

849
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:48,006
- Thanks, man.
- My pleasure.

850
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:50,008
Appreciate it, man.

851
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:52,010
Hey, anybody seen my dad?

852
00:50:53,011 --> 00:50:55,013
No. I think I saw your aunt,
so he's probably here.

853
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:58,016
- Oh, she's in there?
- We're here. Friends.

854
00:50:58,016 --> 00:51:01,019
- I know, I know. I know. Come on, now.
- Moral support.

855
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:03,981
- You gonna kill it.
- Thank you. I gotta get backstage.

856
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:06,984
- That's why we're here, baby.
- I'll see you later tonight?

857
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:07,985
- Definitely, man.
- Break a leg.

858
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:10,988
- Good luck.
- Yo, are we on the list?

859
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:12,990
Ladies and gentlemen...

860
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,992
...let's hear it for Greg Rant.

861
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,003
- It's crazy.
- I understand this dude just joined the tour.

862
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:28,005
I'm familiar with that joke thief.

863
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:31,008
- Let's hope the man is funny.
- Depends on whose material he's doing.

864
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:33,010
- Do this or not.

865
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:38,015
It's nice to be in Fresno, though.
But the crime is getting bad up here.

866
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:40,017
Y'all didn't tell me that.

867
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:43,020
People ain't even asking,
"What's happening?" no more.

868
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,981
- They're asking, "What's missing?"
- "What's missing?"

869
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:48,984
Where's my wallet at?
I don't know where my wallet at.

870
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:51,987
And it is safe to go through
Fresno at night.

871
00:51:51,987 --> 00:51:53,989
- Lf you a bullet.
- Bullet.

872
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:58,994
I guess he done heard my act before.
Everybody's seen me.

873
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:00,996
He's doing my act.
He's doing my act.

874
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:02,998
Right in front of me, if I ain't here.

875
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:06,001
Listen, people out there
didn't pay to hear it again.

876
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:09,004
- You better go Material B.
- B? Can't you do something?

877
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:11,006
Can't you flick the light?
Cut his mike down?

878
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:14,009
- Cut his mike down.
- Come on, you need to go Plan B.

879
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:16,011
My mother, man, she used to tell
everybody we was smart.

880
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:19,014
That's the problem. Y'all don't tell
your kids they smart enough.

881
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:22,017
People used to be like,
"Why do you think your kids so smart?"

882
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:25,979
"Because when they was little,
I used to beat them with books."

883
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:31,985
Encyclopedias, magazines, dictionaries.

884
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:36,990
Thank y'all so much.
I'm Greg Rant. See y'all later.

885
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:38,992
Get my DVDs, y'all.

886
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:42,996
Love you, Fresno. I love you.

887
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,003
What did I tell y'all?
Greg Rant, rips all around the country...

888
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,005
Get the fuck off...

889
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,008
- What the fuck is your problem?
- Get off me, man.

890
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:56,009
What is your problem?

891
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:58,011
Mess with me while I'm on-stage,
now you sneak me?

892
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:01,014
- You thief.
- I don't even know you, bitch.

893
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:04,017
Yeah, but you knew my act.
You're doing everybody's jokes, man.

894
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:07,020
You don't know what act you doing.
Did my whole act.

895
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,983
Don't know what you're talking about.
Everything is fair game. Everybody steal.

896
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:12,985
I've seen your act.
It ain't that damn good.

897
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:14,987
- I only steal funny stuff.
- Wait a minute.

898
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:17,990
What the fuck is going on here?

899
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:21,994
I will not have any fighting on my tour.
You understand?

900
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:23,996
Get your shit together.

901
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:28,000
Reggie, you're next.

902
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:34,006
Don't be here when I get back.

903
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:38,010
I'm gonna be here with one of your jokes.
How about that?

904
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,013
You don't want none of this, boy.

905
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:03,994
Let's give it up for Reggie Sinclaire.

906
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:07,998
Reggie. Reggie.

907
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:45,994
What's up, Fresno?

908
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:52,000
What's up, Fresno?

909
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:55,003
Hey, look.

910
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:58,006
The first motherfucker
to say something to me...

911
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:00,008
...l'll smash in their face.

912
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:04,012
Yeah, that's right, that's right.

913
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:08,016
Hey, bitch.

914
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:12,980
What you looking at?
You look like you got a good job.

915
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:17,985
You wipe down the pole for the next girl.

916
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:23,991
I guess that's professi-"ho" courtesy.

917
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:25,993
Girl, whatever.

918
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:28,996
Professi-"ho."

919
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:35,002
Hey, no titties. Where your titties go?

920
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:38,005
You ain't getting no tips.

921
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:48,015
Guys, they don't tip you a dollar,
they ask for a change for a dollar.

922
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:52,019
Oh, shit.

923
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:56,982
Hey, make sure y'all...
Y'all tip your wait staff.

924
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:00,986
They're tired of being in prostitution.

925
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:05,991
You know, it's hard out there for a ho.

926
00:56:06,992 --> 00:56:08,994
Because they're so slow with the drinks.

927
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:11,997
They slow with the drinks.
I been waiting two hours for a drink.

928
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:16,001
I ain't gonna wait no more. You order
another one because I'm taking yours.

929
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:24,009
It's good shit, nigga.

930
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,011
Check, please.

931
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:31,016
That boy... You be in the Navy, huh, boy?

932
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:34,019
Yeah, I know.

933
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,979
What rank were you again?

934
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:37,981
Rear admiral.

935
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:46,990
I guess... Know what? I guess the Navy
is the best place to go get some seamen.

936
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,992
You're not funny.

937
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:50,994
You're not funny, buddy.

938
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:52,996
Not funny.

939
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:57,000
- Who said that?
- Right here, buddy.

940
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,002
Oh, you're a motherfucking white boy.

941
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:01,004
Motherfuck...

942
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:08,011
You're through. You're through, mister.

943
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:11,014
You will not work
another day of this tour.

944
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:13,016
Sandra. Hey, Sandra.

945
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:15,018
Get me Marty on the phone.

946
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:19,982
You know, Reggie, you could have
started a full-scale riot out there.

947
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:23,986
Besides, everybody knows
that you are a drunk and a junkie.

948
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:25,988
- He is not a junkie.
- Yes, he is!

949
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:27,990
- He is not.
- Yes, he is.

950
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,993
We all know about his little
goddamn habit. You're finished.

951
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:33,996
You did good, baby.

952
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:36,999
Yeah, no, we think
we can probably fast-track this.

953
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:39,001
I just have to make some calls.

954
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:45,007
Yeah, you know what, though?
No, let us call you.

955
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:47,009
Yeah, I gotta make some calls.

956
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:49,011
All right.

957
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:51,013
Yeah, okay. Bye.

958
00:57:52,014 --> 00:57:55,017
Susan, no more bullshit scripts
anymore, okay?

959
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:58,020
This is ridiculous, it's garbage.

960
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:02,983
- Dede Calvin.
- Yes.

961
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:04,985
- Looking as beautiful as ever.
- Thank you.

962
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:06,987
- How are you doing?
- I'm good. You?

963
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:08,989
Fantastic.

964
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:10,991
Let's get this out of the way.

965
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:12,993
I want you to have your lawyers
look that over.

966
00:58:13,994 --> 00:58:14,995
And in the meantime...

967
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:16,997
...be here tomorrow, 3:00.

968
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:18,999
You're reading for Finlayson.

969
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:22,002
Oh, wow, are you kidding?

970
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:24,004
- I never kid about money.
- Well...

971
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:26,006
Wow, I mean...

972
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:30,010
You know, Mr. Jacobs,
this is all going so fast. This is...

973
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,014
Hold that, hold that.
Hey, what did you shoot?

974
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:36,016
You're kidding me.

975
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:38,018
Who did you play with?

976
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:40,979
Yeah, well, I wanna see that scorecard.

977
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,981
Okay, I'll see you Saturday.

978
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:46,985
Yes, bright and early.
Bring your A game. Bye.

979
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:48,987
He's such a liar.

980
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:49,988
Okay, what were you saying?

981
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:52,991
Well, I just don't wanna appear
to be ungrateful...

982
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:55,994
...but I just wanted to know
if this role required nudity, because l...

983
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:59,998
No, no. All the roles that you'll
be reading for will be classy ones, okay?

984
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:02,000
Nothing degrading.

985
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,003
Okay. All right.

986
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:07,005
- I'm sorry, I had to ask.
- No, it's smart. I like that.

987
00:59:08,006 --> 00:59:12,010
- Smart clients. I could use more of them.
- Thank you so much, Mr. Jacobs. This is...

988
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:15,013
Please. Please, it's Scott to you. Okay?

989
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:18,016
- Oh, then it's Dede to you.
- Okay.

990
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:20,018
Oh, by the way...

991
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:23,981
...remember the guy you met the other day
that you said had leading-man quality?

992
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:24,982
- Oh, yeah...
- Bo.

993
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:26,984
- Bo, right.
- Bo Clark.

994
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:29,987
He needs representation also.

995
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:31,989
Well, when does he go up next?

996
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:35,993
I'm glad you asked because, fortunately,
I was able to get him a spot tonight.

997
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:37,995
- Between 12 and 1.
- Why not?

998
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:39,997
I'll check out his act.
Maybe you'd like to go with me.

999
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:44,001
- I could meet you there around 10.
- Nonsense, I can pick you up at 9.

1000
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:46,003
Okay.

1001
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:51,008
Thank you. Thank you so much,
Mr. Jacobs. Scott.

1002
00:59:51,008 --> 00:59:52,009
Scott.

1003
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:55,012
- Bye.
- Okay.

1004
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:11,987
So how'd it go?

1005
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:14,990
What do you mean, "How'd it go?"

1006
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,992
Unless you wanna know
that I signed with ICC...

1007
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:19,995
...and I'm reading
for Finlayson D. Zero tomorrow.

1008
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:25,000
- You know, I'm really happy for you.
- Thank you. But there is more.

1009
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,003
Now, remember I told you that he asked
who you were the other night...

1010
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,005
...and he had missed your act?

1011
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:32,007
Yeah.

1012
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:35,010
Thank TD for his spot
because he's coming to see you tonight.

1013
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:36,011
- Who?
- Scott Jacobs.

1014
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:38,013
- No shit.
- Yes, shit.

1015
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:40,015
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

1016
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:42,017
He said he wanted to see you perform...

1017
01:00:42,017 --> 01:00:45,020
...because he's helping Finlayson
with the casting of this movie.

1018
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,982
You want some pizza?
Because I'm buying.

1019
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:51,985
I would love some pizza
but I gotta get back to the bank.

1020
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:53,987
Thank you.

1021
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:55,989
You're welcome.

1022
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:01,995
You're so silly. Forgot about your wife?

1023
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:03,997
Yeah... I mean, no.

1024
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:08,001
Come on, Marty,
give me another chance, please.

1025
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:10,003
Hell, no.

1026
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,005
How many times
am I gonna let you burn me?

1027
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:14,007
You have been late
three of the last four shows.

1028
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:16,009
You are not the headliner, all right?

1029
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:20,013
Everybody's on to your little trick:
Show up late so you can go on last.

1030
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:23,016
And now you wanna pick a fistfight
with the audience?

1031
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:27,020
You can pack your shit right now.
There's a bus ticket waiting in the lobby.

1032
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,981
The cat stole my act!

1033
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:31,984
I ain't got nothing to do with that.
That's the comedy business.

1034
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:33,986
You should know that by now.

1035
01:01:33,986 --> 01:01:37,990
We offered you help in the beginning
with your material, but you blew us off.

1036
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,992
Your shit wasn't funny to begin with.

1037
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:41,994
I'm the best you got
on this bootleg tour.

1038
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:44,997
Fuck this.
It doesn't matter anymore.

1039
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:48,000
It's basically our fault
that we went with your sorry ass.

1040
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,004
It's bullshit, man. Then pay me my money.
Pay me my money then.

1041
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:53,005
What money?

1042
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:56,008
The money that's gonna pay
for the damages to the club?

1043
01:01:56,008 --> 01:01:58,010
Is that the money you're talking about?

1044
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:01,013
What the fuck you mean?
Fuck you, Marty. Fuck you, man.

1045
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:04,016
Fuck you. Fuck you.

1046
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:30,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1047
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,004
- Where are you going in such a hurry?
- Oh, I have a sort of an interview.

1048
01:02:34,004 --> 01:02:37,007
- For another job?
- Yeah, well... No.

1049
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:41,011
No, Mr. Carter, not another job,
an acting job.

1050
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:46,016
Maybe it's me, but why am I
allowing you to look for other work...

1051
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:49,019
...when there are people out there
who would love to have your job?

1052
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:50,979
Someone who wants a future
at the bank.

1053
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:52,981
Look, Mr. Carter, you don't understand.

1054
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:56,985
This... This is a terrific part, I mean.

1055
01:02:56,985 --> 01:03:00,989
Besides, when I took this job, you knew
I had aspirations of being an actress.

1056
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:05,994
Just like everybody else in this town.
Hell, even some other people at this bank.

1057
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:09,998
This part really would give me
an opportunity to get to where I wanna go.

1058
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:13,001
Please. Please?

1059
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:16,004
You know, let me just do
some of the lines.

1060
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:20,008
- That's okay. I'll take your word for it.
- No, no, Mr. Carter.

1061
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:21,009
You are going to listen.

1062
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,011
Now, how dare you, sir?

1063
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:28,016
Harassing me and making advances
in a place of business?

1064
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:30,018
Will I kiss you?

1065
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:32,020
Indeed not.

1066
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,982
All right, all right. Get out of here.

1067
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:38,986
She's just rehearsing a role for a movie.
Right, Dede?

1068
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:41,989
Right, Mr. Carter.

1069
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:05,012
Girl, I told you to break up with Ty.

1070
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:09,016
I know. I was... I was rolling.

1071
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:13,020
Wait, let me... I'm gonna call you back,
all right? All right, bye.

1072
01:04:18,984 --> 01:04:21,987
Baby.

1073
01:04:22,988 --> 01:04:25,991
Federal Express called again today.

1074
01:04:25,991 --> 01:04:28,994
And they say they have
night positions available.

1075
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:31,997
- This man wants you to call him before...
- Cheryl, Cheryl.

1076
01:04:32,998 --> 01:04:35,000
I don't wanna work for FedEx.

1077
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,002
Okay?

1078
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:43,008
But you could stop working three jobs
and just have one.

1079
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:45,010
Oh, I forgot.
You wanna be a movie star.

1080
01:04:46,011 --> 01:04:47,012
Yes, exactly.

1081
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:49,014
Exactly.

1082
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:50,015
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

1083
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:55,020
You need to wake the hell up, okay?
Because you got a child and a wife.

1084
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,980
And whenever I suggest a job,
it's always something.

1085
01:04:57,981 --> 01:04:59,983
I am sick and tired of having
this conversation with you...

1086
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:00,984
...day in and day out.

1087
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,987
You're always asking somebody,
"Can somebody support me?"

1088
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:06,990
You can't support nobody up in here.

1089
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,993
You're months behind on the rent.
The car is on its last leg.

1090
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:10,994
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1091
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:13,997
Guess what. Well, my big break
is going down tonight.

1092
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:19,002
Why? Because Scott Jacobs, ICC, coming
to see me at The Last Stand tonight.

1093
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:22,005
I don't give a damn about no MCI.
I don't give a damn.

1094
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:25,008
FedEx is a good job.

1095
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:29,012
It pays a lot more than that pizza joint
and the restaurant where you wash dishes.

1096
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:32,015
And it's stable work. Stable, Bo, stable.

1097
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:36,019
- So just call them. Just...
- No, I'm not calling them.

1098
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:37,980
- Then I'm gonna call them for you.
- Cheryl, Cheryl.

1099
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,983
Get... You better...

1100
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:46,989
Cheryl.

1101
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:48,991
- Cheryl.
- Hello, is Mr. Samanski in?

1102
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:53,996
Yes, hi. This is Cheryl Clark, Bo's wife.
You've been looking for my husband?

1103
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:58,000
Right. Well, he's right here.
Hold on, okay? Hold on.

1104
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,002
Take it. Take it.

1105
01:06:00,002 --> 01:06:02,004
He wants to talk to you.

1106
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:04,006
Hey.

1107
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:07,009
How you doing, Mr. Samanski?
How you doing?

1108
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:11,013
I'm good, I'm good. I wanted to thank you
for considering me for that job...

1109
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:14,016
...but I already got one. Okay.

1110
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,018
You too.

1111
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:18,020
Bye.

1112
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,982
What's wrong with you?

1113
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:23,984
What is wrong with you?

1114
01:06:24,985 --> 01:06:27,988
I wish that you would...

1115
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,991
I hate you.

1116
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:42,002
All right, Scott,
you got that camera, baby?

1117
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:44,004
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1118
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:47,007
- Miss Calvin, you know the scene, right?
- Yes.

1119
01:06:47,007 --> 01:06:49,009
Take it from the top.

1120
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,012
And action.

1121
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:56,016
Nurse Watson,
did you shave Mr. Johnson?

1122
01:06:56,016 --> 01:07:00,020
Yes, doctor, and he asked me for a date
when I was finished.

1123
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,981
- You have such a crappy job.
- Yeah.

1124
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,983
Now, I didn't forget about us for tonight.

1125
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:06,985
Okay.

1126
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:17,996
Oh, cut.

1127
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:19,998
Damn it.

1128
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:22,000
Damn it.

1129
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:26,004
- So, what did you think, Wesley?
- Best one we've seen so far.

1130
01:07:27,005 --> 01:07:29,007
Goodness gracious. That was fabulous.

1131
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:32,010
So, what are you guys saying?

1132
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:34,012
You got the part.

1133
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:37,015
I got the part! This is awesome.

1134
01:07:57,995 --> 01:08:00,998
Hello, this is Winston Sinclaire.
I'm not at home at the moment.

1135
01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:04,001
Leave your name and number,
I'll call you back.

1136
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:23,020
Hello, hello, TD.

1137
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,021
Your roommate's back.

1138
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:27,983
Oh, hey, what's up, Reg?
What you doing back?

1139
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:29,985
You ain't supposed to be back
till next week.

1140
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:32,988
Yeah, I know, man. Well, you know,
something came up, man.

1141
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:35,991
What's up with them glasses, man?

1142
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:36,992
Oh, yeah.

1143
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:39,995
Oh, oh, snap.

1144
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:41,997
- Oh, you got a honey here?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1145
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:43,999
Hey, Reg, do me a favor, man.

1146
01:08:43,999 --> 01:08:46,001
Come back in about an hour,
that shorty's in there.

1147
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:48,003
I don't wanna make her nervous.

1148
01:08:48,003 --> 01:08:51,006
I got that, man. About time
you got some pussy up in here.

1149
01:08:51,006 --> 01:08:52,007
- Come on.
- My bad, my bad.

1150
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:55,010
- Make sure you wash my sheets.
- Yeah. No doubt, no doubt.

1151
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:58,013
I was gonna put my bags in there,
but I'm gonna drop them.

1152
01:08:58,013 --> 01:09:01,016
- Oh, no, no, no. I got them. I got them.
- Okay.

1153
01:09:01,016 --> 01:09:05,020
How long does it take for a lady
to get a glass of wine up in here?

1154
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:10,984
- Hey, Reg, it's not what you think.
- And who are you?

1155
01:09:11,985 --> 01:09:13,987
Shut the fuck up. Reg, I can explain.

1156
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:15,989
- You're not gonna talk to me like that.
- I'm going.

1157
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:17,991
No, no. Hold on, Reg, hold on.

1158
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:20,994
You fuck me and you think
you could talk that way?

1159
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:22,996
- Shut up and get your shit.
- I'm gonna get my shit.

1160
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:27,000
- This all makes sense now.
- I ain't leaving till I get my glass of wine.

1161
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,001
Come on, man.

1162
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:31,004
Now I understand
why you bash so many gays in your act.

1163
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:34,007
- You're a faggot yourself, man.
- Ain't no faggots up in here.

1164
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:36,009
- Hey, man, don't touch me...
- Reg, come on, Reg.

1165
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,011
Come on, man, let me explain to you.

1166
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:41,014
Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me, TD.

1167
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:43,016
Reg, let me explain.
Reg, let me explain, man.

1168
01:09:43,016 --> 01:09:46,019
Explain nothing, man.
Forget about washing my sheets.

1169
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:48,981
- Burn that motherfucking mattress, man.
- Reg, let me explain.

1170
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:49,982
Let me explain.

1171
01:09:51,984 --> 01:09:54,987
See, shit is fucked up, man.
You know shit is fucked up...

1172
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:57,990
...when you argue with a faggot
because he was staring at you.

1173
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,993
I was like, "Yo, motherfucker,
stop looking at me.

1174
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:03,996
I'm gonna fuck you up."
He was like, "For real?

1175
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:08,000
I'm saying, stop playing. You promise?"

1176
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:12,004
Are you having a good time?

1177
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:14,006
All right, good deal.

1178
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:17,009
We got a lot of interracial couples
here tonight.

1179
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:20,012
That's good, that's good.
My last girlfriend was black.

1180
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:21,013
I loved her. We got along great.

1181
01:10:21,013 --> 01:10:24,016
But we had a big argument.
She accused me of being racist.

1182
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:27,019
I said, "Nigga, please."

1183
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:30,981
I'm sor... All right, here we go.

1184
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:32,983
We're gonna keep the show rolling along.

1185
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:35,986
Bring you an up-and-coming star.

1186
01:10:35,986 --> 01:10:39,990
Put your hands together for Mr. Bo Clark,
ladies and gentlemen.

1187
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:43,994
How's everybody doing tonight?

1188
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:46,997
Say, I'm married with a child, right?

1189
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:48,999
My son likes to sleep in the bed
with me and my wife.

1190
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,001
Do you need another drink?

1191
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:54,004
No, Scott, I haven't finished this one.

1192
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:56,006
Are you watching the show?

1193
01:10:58,008 --> 01:11:00,010
You know something, Dede?

1194
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:02,012
Fuck the show.

1195
01:11:03,013 --> 01:11:05,015
What do you mean, "Fuck the show"?
That's why you're here.

1196
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:09,019
I can get him something small
in the movie. No big deal.

1197
01:11:09,019 --> 01:11:11,980
- But...
- But what, Scott?

1198
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:14,983
I have a little confession.

1199
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:18,987
I really dig black chicks.

1200
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:19,988
Well...

1201
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:21,990
...l'm flattered.

1202
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:24,993
But can we talk about this later
and you watch the show now?

1203
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,996
- Please?
- Later?

1204
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:29,998
The show.

1205
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:33,001
So I'm trying to run away
from my little son in the mall the other day.

1206
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:35,003
This little boy, 2 years old. This tall.

1207
01:11:36,004 --> 01:11:38,006
Don't you know, his little ass
met me at the car.

1208
01:11:38,006 --> 01:11:40,008
At the car. I said, "Damn.

1209
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:43,011
Should not have bought him
the Air Force 3s."

1210
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:45,013
What do they got now?
Seventy-sevens? I don't know.

1211
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:50,018
That's my time, y'all.
Have a good night.

1212
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:24,011
Goddamn.

1213
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,981
Yeah, I knew your ass
would be back here tonight.

1214
01:12:36,982 --> 01:12:39,985
You think you can just roll out of here
without trying to holler at me?

1215
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:43,989
That shit ain't free, man.

1216
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:46,992
You already into me for 2 grand.

1217
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:49,995
And I want my motherfucking money
tonight. You feel me?

1218
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:52,998
Come on, Jay.

1219
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:58,003
I'll get you your money...

1220
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:02,007
...when I get you
your motherfucking money.

1221
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:12,017
Okay.

1222
01:13:13,018 --> 01:13:14,019
It's like that, right?

1223
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:16,980
Just like that, nigga.

1224
01:13:20,984 --> 01:13:23,987
Bitch, you get the fuck up.

1225
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:27,991
Now, look here, motherfucker.
I want my money tonight.

1226
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:29,993
Do you hear me? You hear me, bitch?

1227
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:32,996
I don't give a fuck
whose dick you gotta suck. You get...

1228
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:35,999
Oh, you laughing, huh?
You think this shit's funny?

1229
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:39,002
You think this shit funny?
You think this shit funny, motherfucker?

1230
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:41,004
I want my money, you feel me?

1231
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:44,007
I don't give a fuck what you got to do.
Hear that?

1232
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:47,010
Fucking with you, nigga,
you make this a motherfucking...

1233
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:49,012
Do you hear? I want my motherfucking...

1234
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:52,015
Get the fuck off me. Get the fuck off me.

1235
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:54,017
Get the fuck off me.

1236
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:58,981
Anytime I see you, motherfucker,
I will whoop your motherfucking ass.

1237
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:00,983
Get the fuck off me.

1238
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:02,985
You're getting a fucking ego.

1239
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:04,987
You get a couple of laughs now...
"Motherfucker" what?

1240
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:08,991
Who's the motherfuck...? You.
Don't call me no motherfucker, bitch.

1241
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:09,992
I'll kill you in here.

1242
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:11,994
I'll fucking end it all right now.

1243
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:14,997
Call me no motherfucker.
You're being stupid.

1244
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:16,999
Showtime, you don't know your shit.

1245
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,003
- Everybody know their shit...
- Told you you were gonna love him.

1246
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:24,006
It was a great show. Really was.
Liked the stuff with the family...

1247
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:26,008
- Right, I was...
- What you looking at him for?

1248
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:30,012
I know who he is. He ain't gonna sign you
if he ain't gonna sign me.

1249
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:35,017
What's with the puppet?
I don't like puppets. Puppets and midgets.

1250
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:36,018
- You're silly.
- No, I'm serious.

1251
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:38,020
Hey, everybody. Buddy, can I get a spot?

1252
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:39,980
- Reg, I'm booked up.
- Come on, man.

1253
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,982
- I came straight down.
- I'm all filled up.

1254
01:14:42,983 --> 01:14:43,984
Oh, come on, man.

1255
01:14:43,984 --> 01:14:45,986
I got your ass. Call me...
Call me something else.

1256
01:14:45,986 --> 01:14:48,989
- I want a little time.
- Look at you, you're messed up.

1257
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:50,991
- Are you drunk?
- No. I only had one drink.

1258
01:14:50,991 --> 01:14:52,993
I'll cut your nose right off.

1259
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:55,996
Forget that list. I'm funnier
than anybody you've got in this place.

1260
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:58,999
Everybody here watching us,
they know we getting ready to perform.

1261
01:14:58,999 --> 01:15:02,002
Being stupid...
Motherfucker, say something else.

1262
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:03,003
Say something the fuck else.

1263
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:06,006
Get your hands off...
Get your hands... You wanna fight?

1264
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:09,009
Five a.m. Tomorrow
you are to report on set.

1265
01:15:09,009 --> 01:15:12,012
- Put you in a little trailer.
- Mr. Jacobs, thank you.

1266
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:14,014
- You're welcome.
- Look, I won't let you down.

1267
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:17,017
- I know you won't.
- Dede, you need a ride home?

1268
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:19,019
No, I rode with Scott.
I'll let him take me home.

1269
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:20,979
Okay.

1270
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:22,981
- Don't bullshit me, Buddy.
- All right.

1271
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:26,985
I'll put you on after F-Stop.
Do five minutes and keep it tight.

1272
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:27,986
Cool. He can't follow me anyway.

1273
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:30,989
Get your hands off me.
Get your fucking hands off me.

1274
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:32,991
Stop. Stop it. Stop.

1275
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,993
F-Stop, you're on next.
I'm bringing you up now.

1276
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:36,995
Right now?

1277
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:38,997
- Thanks a lot.
- Good luck. Get some sleep, okay?

1278
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:40,999
Come here, G. I'll fix you up.

1279
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:43,001
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
pulled out my knife again.

1280
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:47,005
I did it once, I ain't need to do it twice.
Showtime.

1281
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:50,008
There's agents out there. Let's get one.

1282
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:55,013
Hey, G, so I heard that you're really
good friends with Woody Harrelson.

1283
01:15:57,015 --> 01:16:00,018
Oh, okay, I can admit
that that's not funny.

1284
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:02,020
Would you forgive me?

1285
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:06,984
Enough with wood jokes.
They're not funny.

1286
01:16:08,986 --> 01:16:11,989
Oh, now, come on.
Now, come on, you guys.

1287
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:14,992
Would I say a joke that's not funny?

1288
01:16:15,993 --> 01:16:19,997
What if I told everybody that you've
got a dick the size of a wood tick?

1289
01:16:26,003 --> 01:16:27,004
Stop it.

1290
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:30,007
Stop it. That's enough.

1291
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:32,009
That's enough.

1292
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:35,012
Ladies... Ladies and gentlemen,
he's got a wood-tick dick.

1293
01:16:37,014 --> 01:16:39,016
I've seen bigger dicks on a gnat.

1294
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:49,985
You embarrass me all the time.

1295
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:51,987
Fucking stick to the script.

1296
01:16:52,988 --> 01:16:53,989
You follow the script.

1297
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:56,992
You never follow the script. Ever.

1298
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:01,997
You always wanna be bigger.
It's not just you. It's not just you.

1299
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:03,999
I don't have a dick like that. I don't.

1300
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:06,001
Stop it.

1301
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:12,007
You've been in the shower with me.
You know it's not true.

1302
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:14,009
It's not true. It's not fucking true.

1303
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,012
You do it, you do it all the time.
You fucking make it personal.

1304
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:20,015
You make it fucking about you. You do.

1305
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:27,981
You don't make it personal. I don't care.

1306
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:33,987
Fucking doll.

1307
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:36,990
Get away from me.

1308
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:40,994
I'll blow his brains out.

1309
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:42,996
I'll fucking shoot him.

1310
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:45,999
- I swear to God, I'll shoot him.
- Stop, F-Stop. Stop, stop.

1311
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:48,001
- I'll shoot him in the head.
- I know, I know.

1312
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:51,004
- He embarrasses me.
- I know. I know, man.

1313
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:53,006
- All the time.
- Come on, F-Stop, take it easy.

1314
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:58,011
I'm sorry, I don't wanna mess up...
I just wanna make a good show.

1315
01:17:58,011 --> 01:18:00,013
- He makes me look dumb.
- It's cruel, it's cruel.

1316
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:04,017
- I just wanna do it right.
- Fuck him.

1317
01:18:06,019 --> 01:18:07,980
Goddamn.

1318
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:11,984
Give it up for the last two dummies.

1319
01:18:13,986 --> 01:18:16,989
How y'all doing? Y'all okay?

1320
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:19,992
Okay. All right. All right.

1321
01:18:19,992 --> 01:18:21,994
We got some white boys
in the house, huh?

1322
01:18:25,998 --> 01:18:30,002
How long you two been,
you know, flipping fry, you know.

1323
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:33,005
About as long
as you've been out of rehab.

1324
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:40,012
Funny. Not funny.

1325
01:18:41,013 --> 01:18:43,015
I see we got a comedian amongst us.

1326
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:46,018
Well, at least one of us is.

1327
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:51,982
Turn the light on.
Get him out of there, Buddy.

1328
01:18:51,982 --> 01:18:53,984
Hell, the light's been on.

1329
01:18:53,984 --> 01:18:55,986
I'm gonna turn the mike off.

1330
01:18:55,986 --> 01:18:57,988
Let's get out of here.

1331
01:18:58,989 --> 01:18:59,990
Cheers.

1332
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:03,994
- Yo, man, fuck...
- You suck.

1333
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:10,000
Oh, shit.

1334
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:13,003
Oh, Scott. I'll be right back, all right?

1335
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,011
He sucked.

1336
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:25,015
- Oh, I gotta piss.
- Okay.

1337
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:27,017
- Hey. Hey.
- What?

1338
01:19:28,018 --> 01:19:30,020
He sucked.

1339
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,980
No, no, no. I got this, Dede.

1340
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:35,984
- Peckerwood.
- For fuck's sake. What's the problem?

1341
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:37,986
Hey, I do that for a living, man.

1342
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:38,987
Come on. We're just having some fun.

1343
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:41,990
Come on, don't do this.
It's not won'th it, Reg.

1344
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:44,993
This guy's had more to drink
than we have.

1345
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:45,994
I got news for you, pal.

1346
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:46,995
- Hey, get off me.
- Back up.

1347
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:50,999
- Getting heckled comes with the territory.
- Who's talking to you?

1348
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:53,001
Keep the day job, huh?

1349
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:55,003
- What did you say?
- Bo.

1350
01:19:55,003 --> 01:19:57,005
I said, what did you say?

1351
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:02,010
I said, keep the day job
or become a rapper or something, huh?

1352
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:23,991
- We don't speak the same language.

1353
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:26,994
That was the problem, communication
with me and the African chick.

1354
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:30,998
But African chicks are different
than African-American chicks, man.

1355
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:34,001
That shit is wild, you know.

1356
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:37,004
Because look, you try to leave
an African-American chick...

1357
01:20:37,004 --> 01:20:41,008
...she pull out a motherfucking
straight razor or gun on your ass, right?

1358
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:43,010
You try to leave an African chick...

1359
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:46,013
...she pulls out
a motherfucking blowdart.

1360
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:48,015
Where do you go?
Where do you go?

1361
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:50,017
Me? I'm leaving your ass, bi...

1362
01:20:57,983 --> 01:20:58,984
What the hell was that all about?

1363
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:03,989
I don't wanna talk about it. Just get in.

1364
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:07,993
Some friends.

1365
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:13,999
Hey, look, before we head out,
I wanna talk to you.

1366
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:17,002
Scott, you didn't see any of Bo's show.

1367
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:23,008
Well, what can I say?
I was slightly distracted.

1368
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:28,013
So a girl can't dress nice
without you becoming a pervert?

1369
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:30,015
- Pervert?
- Yeah.

1370
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:32,017
Oh, that hurts.

1371
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:34,019
Look...

1372
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:35,979
...l'm not interested, okay?

1373
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:38,982
And I just want our relationship
to be purely professional.

1374
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:40,984
Oh, I see.

1375
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:46,990
Well, Dede, let me explain something
to you about the business.

1376
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:50,994
You see, here in Hollywood...

1377
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:54,998
...a young actress' career
can really skyrocket...

1378
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:57,000
...or it can shit the bed.

1379
01:21:58,001 --> 01:22:03,006
Sometimes it all depends on how
you treat the people who do you favors.

1380
01:22:04,007 --> 01:22:06,009
Meaning?

1381
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:11,014
Meaning you don't wanna
burn any bridges, you know?

1382
01:22:11,014 --> 01:22:15,018
- Now, your friend Bud needed a...
- Bo.

1383
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:17,020
Right, Bo. He needed a part in a movie.

1384
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:18,981
Who got him that part?

1385
01:22:19,982 --> 01:22:21,984
- You did.
- I did.

1386
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:25,988
Who got you your part, for that matter?

1387
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:27,990
You did.

1388
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:28,991
Right.

1389
01:22:31,994 --> 01:22:35,998
- Yeah, I think I see where this is going.
- Good. Good.

1390
01:22:36,999 --> 01:22:39,001
You want me to do you a favor.

1391
01:22:40,002 --> 01:22:41,003
Bingo.

1392
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:46,008
Okay, I get it.
What exactly did you have in mind?

1393
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:49,011
Well, let's see.

1394
01:22:57,019 --> 01:22:59,021
It's not gonna suck itself.

1395
01:23:06,987 --> 01:23:09,990
I'm the comedian.
You're the agent, remember?

1396
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,992
Stay in your place, sweetie.

1397
01:23:13,994 --> 01:23:15,996
I'm serious, Dede.

1398
01:23:16,997 --> 01:23:18,999
It's not gonna suck itself.

1399
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:25,005
Just don't get any on the seats, okay?
They're leather.

1400
01:23:29,009 --> 01:23:31,011
Have you lost your mind?

1401
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:33,013
- Oh, come on, Dede.
- Wow, Scott.

1402
01:23:33,013 --> 01:23:35,015
Get back in the car.

1403
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:39,019
You know what? I'm just gonna assume
that you had too much to drink...

1404
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:40,979
...and forget about this whole night,
all right?

1405
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:42,981
I'm gonna get my own ride home.

1406
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:45,984
Dede. Dede.

1407
01:23:47,986 --> 01:23:49,988
Fucking prude.

1408
01:23:56,995 --> 01:23:58,997
Freeze!

1409
01:23:58,997 --> 01:24:00,999
- Hold it!
- Cut.

1410
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,003
- Freeze. Police.
- Cut. Cut.

1411
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:10,008
Mr. Clark, it's your wife again.

1412
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:12,010
Another phone call?

1413
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:14,012
That's your third call.

1414
01:24:14,012 --> 01:24:15,013
What is the problem?

1415
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:18,016
It will just be a second, it's...

1416
01:24:18,016 --> 01:24:20,018
I'm sorry.

1417
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:23,981
- Come over here.
- What do you want now?

1418
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:27,985
I don't have time to talk right now, okay?
I'm in the middle of shooting.

1419
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:29,987
Well, did you find my phone?

1420
01:24:30,988 --> 01:24:34,992
Cheryl, this is my first acting gig, okay?
You're making it really hard to concentrate.

1421
01:24:35,993 --> 01:24:38,996
I gotta go. I gotta go. Bye.

1422
01:24:38,996 --> 01:24:40,998
- Are we ready, Mr. Clark?
- Yes.

1423
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:41,999
Oh, that's fabulous.

1424
01:24:41,999 --> 01:24:44,001
Let's do this again, okay?

1425
01:24:45,002 --> 01:24:46,003
And...

1426
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:48,005
...action.

1427
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:50,007
- Freeze, police!
- Cut.

1428
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:54,011
Cut! Cut! Cut!
What the fuck is your problem?

1429
01:24:54,011 --> 01:24:56,013
Do you know your lines?

1430
01:24:57,014 --> 01:24:59,016
Hey, everybody, let's take five...

1431
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:03,020
...so Mr. Clark can learn
his four lines, okay?

1432
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:08,984
No more favors for Jacobs, okay?

1433
01:25:08,984 --> 01:25:10,986
Sending this fucking stiff.

1434
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:16,992
Scott, go home. I'm trying to lie down.

1435
01:25:16,992 --> 01:25:18,994
Come on, open the door.

1436
01:25:18,994 --> 01:25:22,998
I just came back to apologize
for the other night, okay?

1437
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:26,001
I feel really bad about what happened.

1438
01:25:27,002 --> 01:25:29,004
You got five minutes.

1439
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:35,010
You look nice.

1440
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:40,015
This is a nice place.

1441
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:42,017
What do you want, Scott?

1442
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:45,979
Well... First of all, I wanna...

1443
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:49,983
I wanna apologize for my behavior.
Unacceptable.

1444
01:25:49,983 --> 01:25:52,986
And far more importantly...

1445
01:25:52,986 --> 01:25:56,990
Look, I don't normally
get involved with my clients.

1446
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:59,993
But, Dede, there's something about you.
I find you so sexy...

1447
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:02,996
Scott, wait. We've been through this.

1448
01:26:03,997 --> 01:26:04,998
Don't interrupt, okay?

1449
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:09,002
When you interrupt, I feel
you're belittling me. I don't like that.

1450
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:13,006
- I wanna have a business relationship.
- This is part of a business relationship.

1451
01:26:13,006 --> 01:26:14,007
Just a second.

1452
01:26:15,008 --> 01:26:18,011
- Hello?
- Hello, this is Cheryl Clark.

1453
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:21,014
- Okay.
- I got your number off my husband's phone.

1454
01:26:21,014 --> 01:26:25,018
- Who did you say this was again?
- Cheryl Clark. As in Bo Clark's wife.

1455
01:26:25,018 --> 01:26:27,020
Same last name, bitch.

1456
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,981
Wow, name-calling at your age.

1457
01:26:28,981 --> 01:26:30,983
Bo did say you were a little immature.

1458
01:26:30,983 --> 01:26:33,986
Bo is married with a child.

1459
01:26:33,986 --> 01:26:36,989
I know that, which is why
he's just a friend, sweetie.

1460
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:39,992
And you know what? I'd prefer
you didn't call my phone anymore.

1461
01:26:39,992 --> 01:26:43,996
Stay the hell away from my husband!

1462
01:26:50,002 --> 01:26:52,004
Okay, Scott, listen.

1463
01:26:52,004 --> 01:26:54,006
Scott, stop it.

1464
01:26:54,006 --> 01:26:57,009
- What? What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with you?

1465
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:16,987
Okay, cut.

1466
01:27:16,987 --> 01:27:20,991
Mr. Clark, you have
an emergency phone call.

1467
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:22,993
Something about your son.

1468
01:27:22,993 --> 01:27:26,997
It's the last call. I promise.
Mr. Finlayson, this is the last call.

1469
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:28,999
- Hey, take your time, man.
- Hello?

1470
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,003
Cheryl, you called me for that?

1471
01:27:33,003 --> 01:27:36,006
Dede is just a friend, okay?
She's the one that got me this gig.

1472
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:39,009
I say eighty-six him. This is getting old.

1473
01:27:39,009 --> 01:27:42,012
Okay, thank you.

1474
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:44,014
What are you talking about?

1475
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:47,017
I got the assistant director
waiting for me. I really gotta go, bye.

1476
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:50,020
I'm sorry.

1477
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:52,981
That's gonna be the last time, I promise.

1478
01:27:53,982 --> 01:27:55,984
- Okay, you're done.
- Oh, I am?

1479
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:57,986
Call your agent in the morning,
get your paycheck.

1480
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:01,990
Okay, but we aren't done
with the scene yet.

1481
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:03,992
Mr. Clark, you're no longer needed
for the picture.

1482
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:05,994
You're fired.

1483
01:28:08,997 --> 01:28:10,999
Security will escort you off the set.

1484
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:19,007
Mr. Finlayson?

1485
01:28:21,009 --> 01:28:24,012
Please, I can... I can do a better job.

1486
01:28:37,985 --> 01:28:39,987
Thanks.

1487
01:28:43,991 --> 01:28:44,992
Let me ask you something.

1488
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:47,995
Do you know how quickly
I can have you removed from this picture?

1489
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:49,997
- Do you?
- I don't care.

1490
01:28:49,997 --> 01:28:50,998
- Oh, you don't care?
- I don't.

1491
01:28:50,998 --> 01:28:51,999
Get your hands off me.

1492
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:58,005
- I just wanna make love to you.
- Oh, Scott.

1493
01:28:58,005 --> 01:29:01,008
Where are you going?
Opportunity, Dede.

1494
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:04,011
Do you have any idea
how many women in this town...

1495
01:29:04,011 --> 01:29:07,014
...would like to fuck Scott Jacobs?

1496
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:10,017
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

1497
01:29:10,017 --> 01:29:12,019
I'm sorry. No, no, no. It's okay.

1498
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,021
Don't! Stay away.

1499
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:15,981
Okay, I deserved that.

1500
01:29:15,981 --> 01:29:18,984
- Stay away from me.
- Goddamn, the girl's got a left.

1501
01:29:19,985 --> 01:29:21,987
See what you made me do?
Get the fuck up.

1502
01:29:21,987 --> 01:29:24,990
Come on. Get up.
You wanna play like this, huh?

1503
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:26,992
- Don't do this to me.
- It's gonna be...

1504
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:30,996
- Shut the fuck up.
- No, stop, please!

1505
01:29:30,996 --> 01:29:32,998
Please.

1506
01:29:32,998 --> 01:29:35,000
What the fuck?
Okay, cool. Be cool, be cool.

1507
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:38,003
- Get the fuck away from me.
- No baby, it's okay, it's okay.

1508
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:41,006
- Get away from me!
- It's cool.

1509
01:29:41,006 --> 01:29:45,010
I will cut this motherfucker off.
Get the fuck out of my house.

1510
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:47,012
Now, Scott!

1511
01:30:09,993 --> 01:30:12,996
Welcome to my world.
Welcome to Reggie's world.

1512
01:30:13,997 --> 01:30:17,000
Reggie's world.

1513
01:30:23,006 --> 01:30:26,009
Oh, shit. There you go.

1514
01:30:26,009 --> 01:30:28,011
Psych.

1515
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:34,017
My roommate. Let me tell you
something about this shit right here.

1516
01:30:34,017 --> 01:30:37,980
If you ask my roommate
if he wants some blow...

1517
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,983
...he don't know
if you talking about some cocaine...

1518
01:30:40,983 --> 01:30:42,985
...or his ding-a-ling.

1519
01:30:43,986 --> 01:30:44,987
Cheryl!

1520
01:30:45,988 --> 01:30:46,989
Cheryl, get out here!

1521
01:30:46,989 --> 01:30:48,991
- What is wrong with you...?
- I got fired.

1522
01:30:48,991 --> 01:30:52,995
- I heard.
- Oh, you heard. How did you hear?

1523
01:30:52,995 --> 01:30:54,997
The last time I called,
they said you were let go.

1524
01:30:55,998 --> 01:30:58,000
Baby, I'm sorry.
I know you wanna act and everything...

1525
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,002
You're the reason I got fired, Cheryl!

1526
01:31:00,002 --> 01:31:03,005
Don't blame this on me, Bo Clark.

1527
01:31:06,008 --> 01:31:08,010
Why did you call eight times?

1528
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:10,012
You shouldn't have given me
the number.

1529
01:31:10,012 --> 01:31:12,014
Besides, I didn't call you no eight times.

1530
01:31:12,014 --> 01:31:13,015
You're fucking lying.

1531
01:31:13,015 --> 01:31:16,018
Bo, do not try to blame me
for your inability to perform.

1532
01:31:17,019 --> 01:31:18,020
Well, I couldn't concentrate.

1533
01:31:19,021 --> 01:31:20,981
- Oh, here we go.
- You know what?

1534
01:31:22,983 --> 01:31:24,985
- You don't want me to succeed.
- Oh, right.

1535
01:31:24,985 --> 01:31:27,988
You want me to fail.
See, because if I succeed...

1536
01:31:27,988 --> 01:31:31,992
...then your ass won't have nothing
to complain about all the time.

1537
01:31:31,992 --> 01:31:34,995
God, it's like you just live
off of negativity and drama.

1538
01:31:35,996 --> 01:31:36,997
- You're sucking the life out of me.
- Right.

1539
01:31:37,998 --> 01:31:40,000
God, I'm so tired of you, Cheryl.

1540
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,002
I don't even have the energy
to deal with you.

1541
01:31:42,002 --> 01:31:43,003
Stop crying like a bitch.

1542
01:31:44,004 --> 01:31:47,007
Why don't you take the job at FedEx
like I told you in the first place?

1543
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:49,009
Because I don't wanna work for FedEx.

1544
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:53,013
Cheryl, I'm not a package handler.

1545
01:31:53,013 --> 01:31:55,015
I'm an actor.

1546
01:31:55,015 --> 01:31:58,018
And I got talent. And you just basically
just killed my career.

1547
01:31:58,018 --> 01:32:00,020
Okay, now I think you're overreacting.

1548
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:03,982
Oh, I'm overreacting.
When you called for the eighth time...

1549
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:06,985
...you said there was something wrong
with Ahmad to get me to the phone. Why?

1550
01:32:07,986 --> 01:32:09,988
There is nothing wrong with Ahmad.

1551
01:32:09,988 --> 01:32:12,991
- Mom, stay out of this.
- Wait. This is my house. This is my house.

1552
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:15,994
Okay, fine. You wanna know
what's wrong with Ahmad?

1553
01:32:15,994 --> 01:32:17,996
I'll tell you what's wrong with Ahmad.

1554
01:32:17,996 --> 01:32:20,999
Ahmad needs a daddy
with some common sense.

1555
01:32:20,999 --> 01:32:25,003
He needs a father that's not out there
trying to chase some childhood dream.

1556
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:30,008
What he needs... What he needs
is a father that is not dumb enough...

1557
01:32:30,008 --> 01:32:34,012
...to leave his phone out
so that his wife can see his messages...

1558
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:36,014
...and call his mistress.

1559
01:32:36,014 --> 01:32:38,016
- So you found my phone.
- That's what's wrong with Ahmad.

1560
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:41,019
Why would you lie about Ahmad?
That's not right.

1561
01:32:41,019 --> 01:32:42,980
- You had my phone the whole time.
- Yeah.

1562
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,982
And you're not any good
at cheating either.

1563
01:32:44,982 --> 01:32:48,986
Bo, sometimes you have to make sacrifices
for your family.

1564
01:32:48,986 --> 01:32:52,990
- Sacrifices?
- Yeah, sacrifices.

1565
01:32:54,992 --> 01:32:58,996
I've been sacrificing for you
since I was 15.

1566
01:32:58,996 --> 01:32:59,997
Okay?

1567
01:33:00,998 --> 01:33:03,000
But no, that doesn't mean
anything to you.

1568
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,003
No, no, no, see, I had your baby.

1569
01:33:06,003 --> 01:33:09,006
- That is a sacrifice. That is a sacrifice.
- Fuck this.

1570
01:33:09,006 --> 01:33:11,008
Fuck this.

1571
01:33:11,008 --> 01:33:17,014
Cheryl, I am sick and tired of you
living this lie...

1572
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:20,017
...and using that little boy as a pawn.

1573
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:36,992
Come on, Dede. Pick up the phone.

1574
01:33:37,993 --> 01:33:41,997
I just had a little too much to drink.
Come on, pick up the phone, please.

1575
01:33:42,998 --> 01:33:46,001
Dede, it's Scott again.
Pick up the phone, will you?

1576
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:47,002
We need to talk.

1577
01:33:49,004 --> 01:33:52,007
You're fucking pissing me off, Dede.
Pick up the phone.

1578
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:55,010
Pick up the fucking phone
or you're done. You understand me?

1579
01:33:56,011 --> 01:33:59,014
You're done. Fuck.

1580
01:34:00,015 --> 01:34:03,018
That little boy in there
needs a responsible father.

1581
01:34:03,018 --> 01:34:05,020
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Don't start, okay?

1582
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:07,981
You are holding that man back
because you're afraid of losing him.

1583
01:34:08,982 --> 01:34:12,986
But you're holding him the wrong way.
A baby don't keep no man.

1584
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:17,991
You are so afraid that Bo will find out
that Ahmad is not his.

1585
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:19,993
- Lower your voice.
- It's driving you crazy.

1586
01:34:19,993 --> 01:34:23,997
- Lower your voice.
- Secrets and lies. Secrets and lies.

1587
01:34:32,005 --> 01:34:33,006
No.

1588
01:34:42,015 --> 01:34:44,017
Momma.

1589
01:34:48,981 --> 01:34:50,983
Momma, I'm asking you, okay?

1590
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:53,986
You never lie to me.

1591
01:34:58,991 --> 01:35:00,993
Is Ahmad my son?

1592
01:35:02,995 --> 01:35:06,999
Of course. Of course he's your son.

1593
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:15,007
Am I his biological father?

1594
01:35:29,021 --> 01:35:31,982
Ahmad is not your biological son.

1595
01:35:31,982 --> 01:35:35,986
But you are his father.

1596
01:35:35,986 --> 01:35:38,989
You are his father.

1597
01:35:38,989 --> 01:35:40,991
You are his father.

1598
01:35:40,991 --> 01:35:42,993
Cheryl.

1599
01:35:43,994 --> 01:35:44,995
Talk to me.

1600
01:35:45,996 --> 01:35:47,998
- Please.
- What do you want me to say?

1601
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,003
You go off chasing these pipe dreams.

1602
01:35:53,003 --> 01:35:54,004
You are his father.

1603
01:35:55,005 --> 01:35:57,007
What was I supposed to do
until 4:00 in the morning...

1604
01:35:57,007 --> 01:35:59,009
...while you at the comedy clubs?
- You are.

1605
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:03,013
This ain't on me. This is on you.

1606
01:36:03,013 --> 01:36:06,016
- Lf you'd handled your responsibilities like...
- Cheryl.

1607
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:09,019
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1608
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:13,982
Dede, it's Scott. I'm sorry.

1609
01:36:13,982 --> 01:36:16,985
I'm sorry. I've had time
to cool out a little bit.

1610
01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:19,988
Hey, let's get lunch tomorrow.

1611
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:22,991
All right, all right. Call me at the office.

1612
01:36:45,013 --> 01:36:47,015
Dede.

1613
01:36:48,016 --> 01:36:52,020
Dede, look, I need to talk to you
right now, okay?

1614
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,983
I really need to talk to you.
I think I'm gonna kill her.

1615
01:36:56,984 --> 01:36:58,986
Dede.

1616
01:36:58,986 --> 01:37:01,989
I really need you right now, okay?

1617
01:37:32,019 --> 01:37:34,021
Hey, you. I'll be here all week.

1618
01:37:34,021 --> 01:37:35,981
Try the veal.

1619
01:37:36,982 --> 01:37:38,984
Reg.

1620
01:37:38,984 --> 01:37:41,987
- Reg.
- Tip your wait staff.

1621
01:37:41,987 --> 01:37:42,988
Reg.

1622
01:37:45,991 --> 01:37:48,994
Come on down, man.
I need to talk to you.

1623
01:37:50,996 --> 01:37:52,998
That's my roommate.

1624
01:37:53,999 --> 01:37:56,001
Didn't hear what I just said.
He didn't hear.

1625
01:37:56,001 --> 01:37:58,003
What up, nigga?

1626
01:37:58,003 --> 01:38:01,006
Come on down, man.
I need to talk to you.

1627
01:38:01,006 --> 01:38:02,007
Need to talk to me?

1628
01:38:03,008 --> 01:38:04,009
For what?

1629
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:09,014
What? What can you possibly tell me
I don't already know?

1630
01:38:09,014 --> 01:38:11,016
Just come down, man.

1631
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:14,019
All right, I'll come down to your level.

1632
01:38:14,019 --> 01:38:16,980
No, I ain't gonna come to your level.
Your level would be like this.

1633
01:38:17,981 --> 01:38:19,983
- Reg.
- Hey, keep your distance.

1634
01:38:20,984 --> 01:38:23,987
Keep your distance, man.
What? Talk. Talk.

1635
01:38:23,987 --> 01:38:25,989
Look, man.

1636
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:28,992
I don't know why I am the way I am.

1637
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,995
You know how it feels
to be ostracized by your family...

1638
01:38:31,995 --> 01:38:33,997
...because of your sexual preferences?

1639
01:38:34,998 --> 01:38:37,000
That's why I ain't say nothing to you.

1640
01:38:38,001 --> 01:38:41,004
That's why you ain't say nothing?

1641
01:38:43,006 --> 01:38:46,009
"I'm ostracized by my family."

1642
01:38:48,011 --> 01:38:52,015
What are you doing here, man?
Why you even come down here?

1643
01:38:53,016 --> 01:38:54,017
Don't you have a dick to suck, nigga?

1644
01:38:58,981 --> 01:38:59,982
Why did you do that?

1645
01:39:03,986 --> 01:39:07,990
You don't listen, man. You don't listen.

1646
01:39:08,991 --> 01:39:10,993
- I gotta talk to you, Reg.
- All right. All right.

1647
01:39:10,993 --> 01:39:12,995
- You just...
- Nigga, fuck you.

1648
01:39:12,995 --> 01:39:16,999
This shit ain't got nothing
to do with you.

1649
01:39:16,999 --> 01:39:20,002
You understand that?
It ain't got nothing to do with you.

1650
01:39:20,002 --> 01:39:22,004
All right.

1651
01:39:22,004 --> 01:39:23,005
I'm trying to help you, man.

1652
01:39:24,006 --> 01:39:26,008
You got a chance, man.

1653
01:39:26,008 --> 01:39:28,010
- I fucked up already.
- I'm gonna jump.

1654
01:39:29,011 --> 01:39:31,013
- I'm gonna jump.
- Bo, what you doing?

1655
01:39:31,013 --> 01:39:34,016
- I'm gonna jump.
- Bo, come down off the ledge, man.

1656
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:36,018
No, no, no, Bo.
See, you not gonna jump.

1657
01:39:37,019 --> 01:39:39,021
What are you talking about, man?
Come down off of there.

1658
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:40,981
Come off the ledge, Bo.

1659
01:39:42,983 --> 01:39:44,985
What's wrong with that nigga?

1660
01:39:44,985 --> 01:39:46,987
Yo, get away from me, man.

1661
01:39:50,991 --> 01:39:53,994
Bo, pick up the phone. Bo, talk to me.

1662
01:39:54,995 --> 01:39:57,998
- What are you gonna jump for, man?
- You hear me, Bo? Let's talk.

1663
01:39:57,998 --> 01:40:02,002
You gonna jump and mess up
that little Bill Cosby sweater you got on?

1664
01:40:03,003 --> 01:40:06,006
Look, I'm gonna get help. Watch him.

1665
01:40:06,006 --> 01:40:07,007
Watch him.

1666
01:40:09,009 --> 01:40:11,011
It's like...

1667
01:40:12,012 --> 01:40:15,015
- What?
- It's like I wanted to kill her, man. And l...

1668
01:40:15,015 --> 01:40:18,018
Who? Who's fucking with you, man?

1669
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:20,020
What about your son?

1670
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:22,981
- You got a little shorty...
- Look, shut up!

1671
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:25,984
Just shut the fuck up! You ain't helping!

1672
01:40:30,989 --> 01:40:32,991
Man, don't. Come on.

1673
01:40:32,991 --> 01:40:34,993
Come on down.

1674
01:40:35,994 --> 01:40:37,996
Come on down, man.

1675
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:40,999
Look, see? Hey, shit is silly, huh?

1676
01:40:40,999 --> 01:40:44,002
I got a fucking drunk
trying to talk me off a building.

1677
01:40:44,002 --> 01:40:46,004
Yeah.

1678
01:40:46,004 --> 01:40:48,006
Oh, me?

1679
01:40:49,007 --> 01:40:52,010
Oh, I'm the drunk. You're right.

1680
01:40:53,011 --> 01:40:55,013
You saw my bottle. I'm the drunk.

1681
01:40:55,013 --> 01:40:58,016
That's right, I'm a drunk.
Come on down, man.

1682
01:40:58,016 --> 01:41:00,018
Come on down and have a drink
with the drunk.

1683
01:41:00,018 --> 01:41:02,020
Have a drink with the drunk.

1684
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:04,982
Have a drink with a drunk.
Have a drink with a drunk. All right.

1685
01:41:05,983 --> 01:41:08,986
Hold on.
Let's pour some out for the homeys.

1686
01:41:08,986 --> 01:41:10,988
Not too much.

1687
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:14,992
That's good shit right there.
You don't wanna waste good shit.

1688
01:41:20,998 --> 01:41:23,000
Yo, you hear?

1689
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,002
You hear them down there?

1690
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:35,012
Oh, that's some bull...
Now, that's comedy.

1691
01:41:36,013 --> 01:41:37,014
That's comedy.

1692
01:41:37,014 --> 01:41:39,016
Dude, that's a joke, man.

1693
01:41:40,017 --> 01:41:43,020
- That's a joke, dude.
- They're playing Kris Kross, man.

1694
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:45,981
That's... That's unbelievable.

1695
01:41:48,984 --> 01:41:51,987
Be quiet. I'm gonna record this,
say this joke.

1696
01:41:51,987 --> 01:41:53,989
Yeah.

1697
01:41:53,989 --> 01:41:56,992
Motherfucker, you don't wanna be
on a ledge ready to commit suicide...

1698
01:41:56,992 --> 01:42:00,996
...and somebody down there playing
Kris Kross, "Jump, Jump."

1699
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:05,000
That's funny, man.

1700
01:42:07,002 --> 01:42:09,004
That's funny, dude.

1701
01:42:18,013 --> 01:42:20,015
Hey, police are here. Where's Bo?

1702
01:42:20,015 --> 01:42:22,017
Bo's cool, man. He's just tripping, man.

1703
01:42:22,017 --> 01:42:25,020
- I said, where is he?
- Tell him, Bo. Tell him, Bo.

1704
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:27,981
Bo.

1705
01:42:28,982 --> 01:42:29,983
Bo!

1706
01:42:32,986 --> 01:42:36,990
Bo!

1707
01:43:19,992 --> 01:43:20,993
Bo.

1708
01:43:21,994 --> 01:43:23,996
Why did you do this?

1709
01:43:24,997 --> 01:43:28,000
- Why did you do this?
- Get the hell away from my husband!

1710
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,001
Oh, see, it's on now.

1711
01:43:29,001 --> 01:43:32,004
- Get off of me.
- Don't let me catch you on the street.

1712
01:43:32,004 --> 01:43:37,009
Don't let me catch you on the street.
Let's go, right here. That's my husband.

1713
01:43:37,009 --> 01:43:38,010
My husband!

1714
01:43:49,021 --> 01:43:49,980
So...

1715
01:43:50,981 --> 01:43:52,983
...what else have you done?

1716
01:45:40,007 --> 01:45:41,008
Yeah.

1717
01:45:42,009 --> 01:45:44,011
I know what you mean.

1718
01:45:51,018 --> 01:45:53,020
I'll talk to you later.

1719
01:48:44,983 --> 01:48:47,486
Ripped from the subpack.
