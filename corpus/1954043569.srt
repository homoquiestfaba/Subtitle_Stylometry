1
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:34,919
What the fuck is he doing here?!?

2
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,559
I have to watch him.

3
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,745
He's gonna have to prove
himself first.

4
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:49,326
What was that for?

5
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:51,064
You'll be fine.

6
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:52,755
It's pussy shit.

7
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:03,933
Last one to the top
is a fucking faggot!

8
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:31,373
Finneas, help!

9
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,318
I almost fell, Finneas.

10
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:07,580
You'll be okay.

11
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,634
Watch this.

12
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:38,073
Shit.

13
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:39,871
Shit.

14
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:43,197
Theo!

15
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,920
Theo, get the fuck over here!

16
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,406
Jesus Christ,
can you fucking believe it?

17
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:50,050
Come on, dude!

18
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:50,951
Let’s go!

19
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:53,795
Come on!

20
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,330
What the fuck was that?

21
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:03,569
Hey! Hey! Leave him alone!

22
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,477
Fag almostgot us caught.

23
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:05,555
Hey, he's just a kid!

24
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:07,975
Pull that shit again and I swear
to Christ I'll fucking murder you.

25
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:10,901
Don't fuck with my brother Tommy.

26
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:15,605
All right,

27
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,013
let’s go.

28
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:22,701
Thanks.

29
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:26,768
Next time fucking listen to me.

30
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:38,109
What?

31
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:40,504
My stepdad's truck.

32
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:41,405
It’s gone.

33
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:43,683
So?

34
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:45,597
Wait here.

35
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:55,023
That man could have died.

36
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:57,530
Everything is going to be fine Theo.

37
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:58,431
I promise.

38
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,300
Hey,

39
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,996
fucking try this.

40
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:29,676
Oh yeah.

41
00:04:57,528 --> 00:04:58,438
Hey!

42
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:02,571
Get the fuck out of our spot!

43
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:04,396
It's not yours,

44
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:05,744
they can be here if they want.

45
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:07,370
No! They can't!

46
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:16,449
What are you 
going to do about it, kid?

47
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,495
Tommy, put the gun away!

48
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:25,366
This is... the gun's not loaded.

49
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,497
Find the fuck out.

50
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,700
Come on Tommy,
let's just kick his ass!

51
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,436
The gun is not loaded.

52
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:33,037
Find the fuck out.
I dare you.

53
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:36,155
You don't have the balls.

54
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,781
Theo, go home!

55
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:48,822
Fuck!

56
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:51,625
God dammit Theo!
Listen to me, go home!

57
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:55,545
Tommy, let's go!

58
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:57,343
Tommy, come on!

59
00:05:58,178 --> 00:05:59,718
What the fuck
are you doing?

60
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:02,094
They can trace the bullet back
to my dad’s gun.

61
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,015
It doesn't matter
those kids saw us.

62
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:05,735
I got to get this out, come help me.

63
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:07,036
I can't.

64
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:09,092
Please,

65
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:10,123
help me.

66
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,195
I can't.

67
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,640
Fuck.

68
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:18,769
Theo, come on!

69
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,670
Slow down!

70
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:22,873
Theo, you're gonna hurt yourself,
come on!

71
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,014
Shit.

72
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,347
You'll be okay.

73
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:44,501
The End

74
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:48,601
