1
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:22,004


2
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:26,467
That Cameron Diaz is hot.
Did you check out the new F-150 yet?

3
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,969
Dude, it's huge.

4
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:31,723
I figure after the Laker game, I'll
head to Dublin's, grab some brewskies.

5
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:34,350
No way, man.
There's no snatch there on Mondays.

6
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,562
- It's total sausage on week nights.
- You guys see that Saxon got traded?

7
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,815
It sucks.
The line's gonna be shit now.

8
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:41,108
Amen, girlfriend.

9
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:45,154
- What did I say?
- We were doing so well.

10
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:48,240
There isn't a straight man who doesn't
refer to anyone but his girlfriend...

11
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:49,575
as "girlfriend."

12
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:51,619
But I was so butch
when I said it.

13
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:54,873
Fine. I don't care that I lost.
I hate games. Where's the check?

14
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:56,583
You should be proud to have lost.

15
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:00,420
This whole exercise is an unabashed,
demoralizing case of self-mockery.

16
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:03,465
This from the man that brought us,
"There's no snatch there on Monday."

17
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:05,509
- That's different.
- I agree.

18
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:08,596
If Larry Kramer knew this is how gay men
spent their time, he'd defect.

19
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:10,890
Larry Kramer can blow me, okay?

20
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:12,266
This is fun.

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,561
Besides, that was 5 minutes
and 32 seconds.

22
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:16,354
- Group record.
- Meanwhile...

23
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:18,106
I was saying earlier--

24
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:21,443
Could I have
a double steroid mocha?

25
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:23,612
- I can't help it. I'm a gym bunny hag.
- Gross.

26
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:26,073
Yes, Benji, yours is a lost cause.

27
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:28,784
I hate this city.
Everyone's better-looking than me.

28
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:31,871
- Cheer up,Jan. You'll make the team.
- I'm serious.

29
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:33,373
Fuck off.

30
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:35,375
It's from the three of us.

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,963
And you wrapped it in your pants.

32
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:42,007
That's very funny.

33
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,638
- "Love, Here I Am."
- It's a joke.

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,100
You're the only one of us that never
complains about not having a boyfriend.

35
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:54,479
Certain individuals less familiar
with the real Dennis...

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,732
might interpret that
absence of desire to couple...

37
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:00,986
as a defense mechanism, a wall.

38
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:05,324
In which case, this text would serve you
in overcoming your emotional blockage...

39
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:09,161
and opening yourself up
to the possibilities of a relationship.

40
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:13,249
Okay, hint taken.
Come on.  Just get together.

41
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,835
I can't take a picture.
I look terrible right now.

42
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:18,004
I really, honestly.
Wait a minute. Look at this.

43
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:20,257
- Actually, this isn't bad.
- Okay.

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,594
Good. Light's good over there.
Go. Come on, go.

45
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:28,891
All right.

46
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,230
Meanwhile--

47
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,402
A lot of people ask me
when I first knew I was gay.

48
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:42,698
Fact is, I don't know.
Can't remember.

49
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:44,616
But what I do remember...

50
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,370
what I can recall is the moment
I first realized it was okay.

51
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:50,873
- "It was when I met these guys..."
- Thank you.

52
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:52,375
my friends.

53
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:22,616
I still need to find a housewarming gift
for my sister and Clubber Lang.

54
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:24,952
She's been your sister's girlfriend
for five years.

55
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:27,454
Don't you think you two
should get along?

56
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,879
Meanwhile, don't look now,
but right behind me--

57
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:36,631
I could kill you.

58
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:39,217
You act like he'd never know
we were checking him out.

59
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,970
He wouldn't even know I was a fag
if I wasn't here with you--

60
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:43,972
a cart full of kitchenwares.

61
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,474
What planet are you living on?

62
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:48,519
Not a person in this store wouldn't
pick you off the homo tree in a second.

63
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:50,813
- Keep telling yourself that.
- You don't believe me?

64
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,441
Okay. I'm sorry, miss?
Excuse me, miss?

65
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:55,818
Could you come here
for just a second?

66
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,072
This man, you've never seen him before
in your whole entire life, right?

67
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,576
Tell me, which is it:
fag, not a fag?

68
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,412
I'll have to say big fag.

69
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,789
- The first thing I want to say, Larry--
- Lawrence.

70
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,168
- Remember my thing with that?
- Right.

71
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,629
Anyway, Lawrence,
the last two weeks...

72
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,174
that we've been going out...

73
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:21,221
have been some of the best moments
in my dating career.

74
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:23,306
We've laughed, we've learned...

75
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,684
we've tripped the light fantastic.

76
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,895
And yet, I just...

77
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:31,690
feel like something's
just not working.

78
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,152
What do you think, dear?

79
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:37,488
I'm not sure.  Fold your arms.

80
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:43,370
Oh, gosh, yeah.  Big nellie.

81
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:45,997
It's not you, okay? It's me.

82
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,834
I'm the broken piece,
and you wanna know why?

83
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,504
It's because deep down inside...

84
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:57,051
I'm a lonely person.

85
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:01,598
Are you reading that
off of your hand?

86
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,767
What? No.

87
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:07,396
You are. You are totally
reading a script.

88
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:09,857
It's just some notes. I wanted
to make sure I said the right thing.

89
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,900
Oh, give me a fucking break.

90
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:15,112
The light fantastic?
You don't even know what that is.

91
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:16,906
What?

92
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:19,534
Got an APB on a Caucasian male,
brown hair and eyes...

93
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:21,536
160 pounds, 5-feet-11.

94
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:25,457
Suspect is unarmed and has distinct
characteristics of a homosexual male.

95
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,793
That's how I'd call you in myself.

96
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:32,631
You know, you are worse
than all the muscle boys combined.

97
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,384
At least they don't presume
to want a relationship.

98
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,054
I never said
that I wanted a relationship.

99
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,640
- Then what did you want?
- Something casual.

100
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,936
Linen sports jackets are casual.
Swimwear is casual.

101
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,398
- Fucking somebody is not casual.
- Okay.

102
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,983
While we're on the subject...

103
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,403
if certain rumors concerning
your sexual proclivities...

104
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:55,656
start popping up around town,
you'll know who started them.

105
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,242
Have a pleasant evening,
bottom boy!

106
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:02,330
That is such bullshit!

107
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:33,405
Why do you bring them here,
strumpet?

108
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:35,449
I am not in the mood
for one of your tirades.

109
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:38,619
As a person in a long-term relationship,
I'm gonna let you know.

110
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:40,955
- What you do is sick.
- Whatever.

111
00:06:40,997 --> 00:06:43,958
Number one, you work here.
It's in poor taste.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,419
Number two, if you're gonna
break up with somebody...

113
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:48,922
have the decency to provide them
with better lighting.

114
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:51,967
I heard that, ingrate.
Oh, record time, Casanova.

115
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,428
You can start your shift early.

116
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:57,473
Roberto, what are you
cutting those with, a chain saw?

117
00:06:57,556 --> 00:07:00,518
This is bruschetta.
You slice the tomatoes thinly.

118
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:04,606
Jack, that's Javier.
Roberto is his brother.

119
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,816
If he cuts those tomatoes right,
I'll call him Phyllis if he wants.

120
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,860
As a person
in a long-term relationship...

121
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:11,780
I don't see how you're ever gonna
find happiness with one person...

122
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,490
if you don't mend your ways.

123
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:17,036
Do you not start any sentences with, "as
a person in a long-term relationship"?

124
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,038
It speaks of my authority
on matters of the heart.

125
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,291
-It speaks of your boyfriend's insanity.
-Hey, guys.

126
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,876
- Thank God.
- You're late.

127
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,671
Sorry, but, you know,
it is my birthday.

128
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:29,007
Sorry doesn't feed the bulldog, sugar.
Go to work.

129
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,385
Saw your prey on the curb.
Nice work.

130
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,887
Last time I use an audition monologue
to break up with somebody.

131
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:36,056
You coming to the party,Jack?

132
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,477
I just wrapped 1 00 pieces of cantaloupe
in prosciutto to keep 'em warm.

133
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,479
You didn't.  Jack!

134
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,481
I couldn't let you have a birthday
without giving you...

135
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,317
at least a little bit
of my superior taste and talent.

136
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:49,154
And in addition to which,
look what I got today.

137
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:50,655
The Broken Hearts jerseys.

138
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:53,492
I will be signing up
interested parties all night.

139
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:56,328
Please, I'm begging you,
no softball team this year.

140
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,831
No softball team this year.
No softball team this year.

141
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:02,043
Are you crazy? You know what kind
of P.R. this is for the restaurant?

142
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:05,547
It can't be that good. We lost
every single game we played last year.

143
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,674
Two of those teams
only had four people.

144
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:10,927
Nobody's forcing you two to play,
but remember who pays your bills.

145
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:21,105
Leslie, Queen of Bitchtar,
your people have come to take you home.

146
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:24,859
Good evening, Patrick.
It's your brother!

147
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:27,237
I'll be right there.

148
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:29,614
What is it with lesbians
and candles?

149
00:08:29,698 --> 00:08:33,702
I just got home from the office,
and I'm not in the mood for your shit.

150
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:36,789
So...

151
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:38,249
what's the gift?

152
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,626
It's a housewarming present
for Anne.

153
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,211
Two months late.

154
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,632
Looks like a coffeemaker.

155
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:48,635
Well, you can shut your mouth
because it's a surprise.

156
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:50,637
Oh, we already have a coffeemaker.

157
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,140
I've seen your old one.
This one is way better.

158
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:56,143
We got rid of that one.
She didn't tell you?

159
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:58,312
We have a new Webb 3000.

160
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:00,815
- You already have a Webb 3000?
- Don't worry, sweetie.

161
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:04,026
It won't be the first time
she's returned one of your gifts.

162
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:09,699
So Anne tells me you're jealous
of her vibrator.

163
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:12,244
How do I look?

164
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:15,163
- Great! Where's Hansel and Gretel?
- That's clever.

165
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:17,541
- You sure you don't want to come?
- No, thank you.

166
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,294
- He said it's gonna be mixed.
- The last time he said that...

167
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:23,506
there were 60 men, 3 women
and a parrot...

168
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,675
and the parrot was getting
more attention than the women.

169
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:28,219
That parrot knew the words
to "Material Girl."

170
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:29,721
Shall we?

171
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:45,530
Do you have to do that in here?
We are two blocks from the house!

172
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,532
Parties make me nervous.

173
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:50,410
- I'm relaxing.
- Can you relax legally?

174
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:53,163
- What if we get pulled over?
- What are the police gonna do?

175
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,916
For starters,
the whole arresting thing.

176
00:09:57,376 --> 00:10:00,504
If we don't go home together tonight,
you'll understand.

177
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:03,174
- Let's not do this thing.
- What whole thing?

178
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:06,344
This eleventh-hour breakup routine.
It's really demoralizing me.

179
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:08,680
I'm not breaking up anything here...

180
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:11,766
because what there was to break up here
was broken up two months ago.

181
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,643
Yet we're still sleeping together.

182
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:16,063
We sleep together because
we got a fucked-up friendship...

183
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,523
not because we're boyfriends.

184
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:19,900
- I don't want to talk about this.
- You never wanna talk.

185
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:24,238
You just want to smoke pot,
watch the fucking Cartoon Network.

186
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:27,867
What's to talk about? We're
ex-boyfriends who still screw around.

187
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,661
I want more. You don't.

188
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:31,246
I hang on because I love you.

189
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:35,000
I wait desperately for the day
you calm down, wake up...

190
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,210
and realize you love me.

191
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,840
You hang on because it's easy.

192
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:46,053
When you say it that way,
I sound like an asshole.

193
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:55,366


194
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:11,498
Okay, wait. Hold on.
First television crush.

195
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:13,500
Oh, easy.  John-Boy Walton.

196
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,628
Yes, honey, I always wanted to be
the last one to say good night to him.

197
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:19,965
- No, that mole.
- Mine is Matthew Laborteaux.

198
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:22,301
- Who's that?
- Albert from "Little House."

199
00:11:22,384 --> 00:11:24,762
Wait a minute. It was the morphine
addiction episode, wasn't it?

200
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:27,849
- How did you know?
- 'Cause you have a thing for bad boys.

201
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:31,603
The valley stream is clear enough
to reflect even a hair or a whisker.

202
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:33,646
Why should I keep this mirror?

203
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:37,526
See, as an artist, it's crucial
that I reject the mirror for the stream.

204
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:39,444
Right.

205
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:42,531
I'm gonna get a drink.
Do you wanna hang here or--

206
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:43,949
Definitely.

207
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:45,951
I mean, you know, whatever.

208
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:50,498
So how do you and Benji
know each other?

209
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,542
We fold jeans at Structure.

210
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,003
Okay, my first television crush:
Aquaman.

211
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:57,464
Aquaman? Are you kidding me?

212
00:11:57,506 --> 00:12:00,467
No, you laugh, but he was a blond
and he had a swimmer's build.

213
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:03,095
I don't like blondes though.

214
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:06,307
- Swimmer's?
- It was a lot of crap.

215
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,435
Listen, boys,
I'm not leaving this party...

216
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,646
until you sign up...

217
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:16,192
to be on the best team
in the West Hollywood Softball League...

218
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,986
the Broken Hearts!

219
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:21,448
So come on over here
and sign up, guys.

220
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,242
Free drinks for a signature!

221
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,995
Oh, they'll all quit
after we lose the first game.

222
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,249
- That looks good, actually.
- Don't do that.

223
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,002
I have to let it set
for at least-- Gosh.

224
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,004
- Guess who's outside.
- Who?

225
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,382
J. Crew guy from New Year's.

226
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,010
- No shit. At my party?
- Yeah.

227
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,553
Come here.

228
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:47,560
Over there by the dining room table
talking to a bunch of his friends.

229
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,562
There he is. Oh, my God.

230
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,564
Shut the door.

231
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,567
It's your birthday star
shining on you.

232
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:58,154
We barely hooked up last time.
He probably doesn't even remember me.

233
00:12:58,238 --> 00:13:00,324
How 'bout you?
Any luck with the coworker?

234
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:02,868
Who had a chance?
Cole moved right in.

235
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,912
I just live with him.

236
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:08,207
It wouldn't have worked anyway.
The guy's a total newbie.

237
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:11,169
- Hasn't even told me he's gay yet.
- No shit. You can pick 'em.

238
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:13,755
I know. I can't help myself.

239
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:18,051
They remind me how great
it used to feel, you know.

240
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:21,847
When you first come out,
and every guy in the room is just--

241
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,849
Possibility.

242
00:13:23,932 --> 00:13:25,517
Yeah.

243
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:29,021
Then you find out
we are the possibility.

244
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,777
- Oh, damn.
- What?

245
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:38,031
Much like a Zen master,
you must struggle to find freshness...

246
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:40,242
in the mundane tasks of your world.

247
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:42,786
That, of course,
being the world of retail.

248
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:44,997
I totally understand what you mean.

249
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,082
It's that book.
He's unstoppable with the book.

250
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,542
What's the book?

251
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:51,921
Some book on Zen lessons
he found on Dennis' shelf.

252
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,716
One of Cole's ex told him he was
without an opinion about anything...

253
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,093
so he thought it'd be best
if he went out and got some.

254
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:59,721
Dumb, gorgeous people should not
be allowed to use literature...

255
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,640
when competing in the pickup pool.

256
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:03,934
It's like bald people wearing hats.

257
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,770
It's deceiving.

258
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,483
- You open my gift yet?
- No. Which one is it?

259
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,568
- Right there.
- I didn't know that.

260
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:16,489
Where's Paul?
He hasn't answered my pages all day.

261
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:20,702
Love, Here I Am.

262
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:24,122
It helped me so much
in preparing myself for loving Paul.

263
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:26,166
- Thank you, sweetie.
- You're welcome, baby.

264
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,920
I'll just put that
with my other two copies.

265
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:31,923
I was wondering
if there's any more ice.

266
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:33,633
Ice.

267
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:35,677
Yes, there is ice...

268
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,971
and I will go get it.

269
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:40,140
Hark! The party calls.

270
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:46,480
From New Year's, right?

271
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:48,649
I wasn't sure you'd remember me.

272
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:51,402
Well, I do.

273
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:54,405
I really didn't come in here
for this.

274
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:26,356
That's my frosting.

275
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,611
Dan, you gotta come upstairs.
It's Taylor.

276
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:35,116
What's goin' on?

277
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,118
You're kidding me.

278
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:42,749
- What's happening?
- Paul finally called Taylor back.

279
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,545
From Hawaii, where he's vacationing
with his new boyfriend.

280
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:48,046
Oh, shit.

281
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:52,718
No Streisand, no Bette, no Judy.

282
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,930
What the fuck is a fairy supposed to do
around here in case of emergency?

283
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:58,099
- Howie, there's gotta be something.
- I'm looking.

284
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:00,477
- There's Celine Dion.
- In hell!

285
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,938
No. Okay, here.

286
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:04,856
"Beaches" soundtrack.

287
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,609
Oh, thank God. Track four.

288
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:09,486
I just heard.

289
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,655
I was left for another man.

290
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:15,493
And not just any other man,
a trainer.

291
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:17,495
A trainer named Dash.

292
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,539
I was left for a punctuation mark.

293
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:21,666
We all knew this was gonna happen.

294
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:23,919
- Patrick.
- Come on.

295
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:26,338
It's not like he didn't know
Paul was sleeping around.

296
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:30,092
I tried to warn him before they moved
in together, and he wouldn't listen.

297
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:32,470
I'm in the room, asshole.

298
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:35,056
Nice. That's what I get
for being a friend.

299
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,308
We obviously have two different
interpretations of that word.

300
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:38,601
What does that mean?

301
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:41,438
It means that when it comes to men...

302
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:44,774
you delight in being the bearer
of bad news for all of us.

303
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:48,654
You can disguise it all you want under
the guise of Patrick's good advice...

304
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:51,156
but it ain't shit
but a pin...

305
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:53,659
trying to pop
all of our relationship balloons.

306
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:59,332
Yeah, I knew Paul was sleeping
with other people.

307
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,502
But he said
that we'd work things out.

308
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,256
He promised we'd work things out.

309
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,216
He lied.

310
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,094
I'm sorry. You know what?

311
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:13,055
This is the time of the evening
where all the prettier boys hook up...

312
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:15,474
so I'm just gonna leave now.

313
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:19,062
- He hates me.
- He'll get over it.

314
00:17:21,314 --> 00:17:23,483
The apartment was Paul's.

315
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:25,735
He wants me out by Friday.

316
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:29,281
We have a guest room.

317
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:31,367
You're more than welcome to it.

318
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:35,538
- I couldn't.
- It wouldn't be a problem.

319
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:40,418
Cole lives here too. I couldn't do it
unless you were okay with it.

320
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,755
Well, it's sort of sudden.

321
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,259
But...

322
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:51,638
it's Dennis' house,
so if he's okay with it...

323
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:53,098
then I guess I am.

324
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:56,519
Then it's settled.

325
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:02,317
Dennis, Cole, I--

326
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,820
You'll never, ever know
how much I appreciate this.

327
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:09,825
I'm gonna need your strength now.

328
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:15,831
See you guys.

329
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:25,216
What happened?

330
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,761
Paul dumped Taylor.
Taylor's a wreck.

331
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:32,558
Party's gonna break up soon,
if you want a ride.

332
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:35,019
Howie, no.

333
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:37,646
You know,
I can't be your Rice-A-Roni.

334
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,981
My what?

335
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,983
Your Rice-A-Roni.

336
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,236
It's the ultimate '7 0s game show
consolation prize...

337
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,530
the thing everybody went home with
even if they lost.

338
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:47,991
It is not like that.

339
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:49,618
It's different.

340
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:51,411
Yeah.

341
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:52,955
Oh, my--

342
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,753
Oh, don't do that.

343
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:01,214
Because you know that
gets me worked up when you do that.

344
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:02,757
Do what?

345
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,135
You take off your glasses.

346
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:07,137
You rub your eyes.

347
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,139
And you're speechless.

348
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,396
I still make you speechless?

349
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:23,237
- Where's your jacket?
- It's in the car.

350
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:24,739
Let's go.

351
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:36,502
Do you wanna talk about it?

352
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:38,796
What's to talk about?

353
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:42,091
Gay men in L.A. are a bunch of 10s
looking for an 11.

354
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:45,887
On a good night, and if the other guy
is drunk enough, I'm a six.

355
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,223
- That's not true.
- It is.

356
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:51,852
I love you, and I know
that you mean well, but it is.

357
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,521
Patrick, maybe it's time
you start hanging out...

358
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:56,732
with a different group of guys.

359
00:19:57,691 --> 00:20:00,528
They're the only ones
that make it bearable.

360
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:03,614
Good night, Patrick.

361
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:07,869
Oh,just before I forget,
Leslie and I wanna have a baby...

362
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:11,373
and since that's biologically impossible
for us to do so without sperm...

363
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:14,293
and since your genes are close to mine,
we thought we could borrow yours...

364
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:17,004
and then it would be like the baby
she and I would've had together...

365
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:19,048
had I a penis.

366
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,218
You wouldn't have to sleep with her.
She'd be artificially inseminated.

367
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:24,721
So take your time,
think about it.

368
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:28,141
Not to rush you, but we do want to
kind of get moving on it right away...

369
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:31,561
like within the next couple
of ovulation cycles.

370
00:20:31,645 --> 00:20:33,647
So...

371
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,649
talk to you tomorrow.

372
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,912
- You can drive away now.
- Oh, okay.

373
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,259
Go home. I'll get the rest.

374
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,346
Come, you spirits...

375
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,390
that tend on mortal thoughts.

376
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,433
Unsex him here.

377
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,811
Now is not the time
for Shakespeare in the Living Room.

378
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,147
No, of course not.
It's getting late.

379
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,359
It's only 20 minutes to your next
meaningless sexual experience.

380
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,320
- Ten, if I'm lucky.
- Never, if you're really lucky.

381
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:21,323
Notice how subtly
I'm ushering you towards the door?

382
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:24,702
Notice how subtly I'm ushering you
towards a healthier existence?

383
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:26,496
Good night,Jack.

384
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,623
Happy birthday, Dennis.
I love you.

385
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:33,086
Don't get nervous.

386
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,507
Little kids and senior citizens
don't say it for you to say it back.

387
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,449
We should light a few more candles.

388
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:04,453
I'm cool.

389
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:08,291
Yeah, but we could use a little,
you know, some mood adjustment.

390
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:30,482
How 'bout--

391
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:33,068
How 'bout some music?

392
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,569
- Sure.
- Great.

393
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,489
- Whatever.
- Yeah. Great.

394
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:39,825
You like the Carpenters?

395
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:43,287
Play something else.

396
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:52,422
You don't find Karen Carpenter's
music even remotely romantic?

397
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,840
- No.
- None of it?

398
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:56,385
Not "Close to You,"
"Rainy Days and Mondays."

399
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:59,096
What about the one
about Warren Beatty?

400
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:03,434
"You're So Vain."
That's Carly Simon.

401
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:05,519
- You should go.
- What?

402
00:23:05,603 --> 00:23:09,565
I'm feeling virtuous all of a sudden,
but I'm gonna go with this impulse.

403
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:13,570
- Is this about the music?
- No, it's not. It's about me.

404
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:16,573
- I can't do this anymore.
- We haven't done anything yet.

405
00:23:16,615 --> 00:23:19,117
I know what we're about to do,
and I can't do it.

406
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,577
- Sure, you can.
- You're right.

407
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:23,914
- I can, but I'm tired of it.
- You're tired of sex?

408
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:25,416
Yes. No.

409
00:23:27,043 --> 00:23:30,672
I'm tired of sex with people who care
what I look like and make up the rest...

410
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:32,715
and I'm tired
of doing the same with them.

411
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:35,969
I want something more...

412
00:23:36,052 --> 00:23:37,345
something else.

413
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,724
I want someone who likes my music
and I care about in the morning.

414
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:43,310
I keep forgetting your name...

415
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:46,397
because my friends and I
refer to you as "J. Crew guy."

416
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:49,442
It's Ted.

417
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:52,695
Well, Ted...

418
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,739
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:54,823 --> 00:23:58,910
Normally, how you look in that sweater
would be enough, but just not tonight.

420
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,411
You scared me.

421
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:41,456
It's my house.
I'm allowed to do that.

422
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,542
- Is Cole asleep?
- Yeah, he's asleep.

423
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,171
There's nothin' in there.
I checked.

424
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,050
You should try the cake.

425
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:54,512
The icing looks gross,
but the cake's pretty good.

426
00:24:55,597 --> 00:24:58,642
This is not what I need tonight.

427
00:24:58,725 --> 00:25:01,937
- You are not what I need tonight.
- What'd I say?

428
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,524
I made that cake you just insulted
for my own birthday.

429
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:08,277
It took me two hours, and I didn't
even get to blow out the candles...

430
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:11,030
cause my friend's relationship
hit DEFCON 5.

431
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:12,824
Bummer.

432
00:25:12,907 --> 00:25:17,287
Everyone knows that birthday wishes
are the only ones with real validity.

433
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,207
I plan on writing to the committee
for an extension.

434
00:25:25,004 --> 00:25:26,797
Why write?

435
00:25:30,092 --> 00:25:33,096
Now you made the deadline.

436
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:46,443
Come on. Make your wish.

437
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:00,500
Thank you.

438
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:03,128
Kevin.

439
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:04,671
You must be "Ennis."

440
00:26:04,755 --> 00:26:06,298
That's Dennis.

441
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:09,343
Somebody ate the " D."

442
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:13,181
- Are these yours?
- Yeah.

443
00:26:13,264 --> 00:26:15,850
I found your darkroom when I
was looking for the bathroom...

444
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,603
so I figured you were
a photographer or something.

445
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:20,897
Or somethin'.

446
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:25,778
- I like this one.
- That was my first class assignment.

447
00:26:25,861 --> 00:26:29,824
We had to find an inanimate object
that represented our emotional state.

448
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:32,785
I had just come out of the closet,
hadn't met any of my friends yet...

449
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:36,080
but I was still feeling a sense
of strength and independence.

450
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:40,085
I think it looks lonely.

451
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:41,503
You're Benji's friend?

452
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:44,590
Oh, yeah.
More sort of coworker...

453
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:47,259
but I like him.

454
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:49,345
- Apparently not enough.
- What's that mean?

455
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:54,308
Between you and me, I think
you kind of dashed his hopes tonight.

456
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:58,396
You've been a hot topic of conversation
since you joined the Structure family.

457
00:26:59,522 --> 00:27:01,483
What, he's been talking about me?

458
00:27:02,317 --> 00:27:05,529
Relax. It's just a crush.

459
00:27:05,612 --> 00:27:07,531
I mean, you should be flattered.

460
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,078
By the next full moon,
he'll have a new one. It's his way.

461
00:27:12,161 --> 00:27:14,288
I don't get you guys.

462
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,041
Is that all you do,
sit around here and talk about men?

463
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,669
Either that or we talk about men.

464
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:22,214
Yeah, well...

465
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:24,549
I think it's really gay.

466
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:29,388
- You're not out, are you?
- What?

467
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:32,808
You're not just a newbie.
You're not even out to anyone.

468
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,145
- I don't think it's anyone's business.
- It isn't.

469
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,857
- I'm getting tired of being asked.
- I can imagine.

470
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,443
Why do I have to tell anyone anyway?

471
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,696
Maybe I'm straight. Maybe I'm gay.
Maybe I haven't decided.

472
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,157
Maybe I should say good night.

473
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,326
Yeah. Good night.

474
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,043
You're right.

475
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:59,045
It looks lonely.

476
00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:09,494


477
00:28:09,702 --> 00:28:12,414
I can't decide if my friends are
the best or worst thing to happen to me.

478
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:15,521
Clearly, without them,
my life would be a lot less fun...

479
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:17,565
but with them...

480
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:22,195
I don't know if I'll ever be able
to have a life of my own.

481
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:26,491
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

482
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:29,787
Do you want to
keep it short on top?

483
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,288
Yeah.

484
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:36,544
I know they're my friends. I just
don't know if I can trust any of them.

485
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:38,588
Especially when it comes to men.

486
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,049
Every time I introduce someone,
they're all over him.

487
00:28:41,132 --> 00:28:43,134
Watch your posture, all right?

488
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:44,553
Sorry.

489
00:28:44,594 --> 00:28:46,638
Take, for instance,
the party the other night.

490
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:49,558
Taylor's boyfriend
broke up with him from Hawaii.

491
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:52,228
Howie went home with Marshall again.

492
00:28:52,311 --> 00:28:55,481
Benji's quasi-boyfriend
slept with Cole.

493
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:59,903
And my sister ends the evening
with a plea for my sperm.

494
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:02,447
It's like one big gay soap opera.

495
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:05,325
I keep waiting for Sue Ellen
to wander into my living room...

496
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:09,121
and tell me she secretly bought
controlling interest in my oil company.

497
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:13,667
I was watching this documentary on cable
about this tribe of monkeys in Somalia.

498
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:17,588
Benji was telling me about this
documentary he saw about monkeys--

499
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,339
In Somalia.

500
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,135
They hang out with each other until
mating season, and then just like that--

501
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,597
They attack each other.
It's survival of the fittest.

502
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,892
I thought to myself,
that's our group.

503
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,227
That's us.

504
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,023
We're those monkeys, and I'm
the monkey with the image problem.

505
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,984
The only one who's unfaxed
by anything is Cole.

506
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,653
I mean,just look at him.

507
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,155
He's gorgeous,
completely straight-acting.

508
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,575
He's the ultimate meanwhile,
and he has no soul.

509
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,911
My dad would sleep with Cole.

510
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:51,500
If you asked me, Cole is precisely
what's wrong with this group.

511
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:55,421
We all want to be him,
but we're all afraid to admit it.

512
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:58,257
Actually,
Howie would probably admit it.

513
00:29:58,341 --> 00:30:00,593
I wanna be Cole.
Why can't I be Cole?

514
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:02,595
Why can't God have made me Cole?

515
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:08,351
My friends get a haircut with this.

516
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:11,063
It's not like I wanna be Cole
or anything.

517
00:30:11,146 --> 00:30:13,607
He just makes it all look so easy.

518
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:17,486
I just wish it was, you know,
that easy to let someone in.

519
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,946
To get a boyfriend.

520
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,698
To be beautiful.

521
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,869
Thanks, Betty.

522
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:27,455
You always know just what to say.

523
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:28,957
It's a gift.

524
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:40,428
Where is my living room?

525
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:43,932
- I just shifted it around a little.
- No, this is your living room.

526
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:45,600
You didn't shift
my living room around.

527
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:47,644
You shifted my living room out
and your living room in.

528
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:49,813
So where is my living room?

529
00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:52,232
Distributed evenly around the house.

530
00:30:52,316 --> 00:30:54,526
- Distribute it back.
- It took me all day.

531
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,113
Start now, you'll be done in time
to set your curlers for bed.

532
00:30:57,196 --> 00:30:59,240
Okay, Dennis.
Think of it this way.

533
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:02,910
A furniture arrangement
is like a new hairstyle, right?

534
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,373
You have to live with it for a few days
before you know if you like it or not.

535
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:08,375
That's not true.

536
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,712
I haven't had a shag, but I don't have
to live with one for a few days...

537
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:13,756
to know that I don't want one.

538
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:17,384
Thank God you're home.

539
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:19,428
Thanks to Mufassa here,
it's now a Tunisian hut.

540
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:22,014
- Why do I even try?
- I have amazing news.

541
00:31:22,098 --> 00:31:25,894
This casting director is bringing me in
for this role in this Kip Rogers movie.

542
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:28,730
- That's terrific.
- Except I ran out of head shots.

543
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:30,774
- You need me to make a head shot.
- Bingo.

544
00:31:30,857 --> 00:31:33,068
- Go get your negatives.
- I love you.

545
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:35,279
You are a fucking godsend.

546
00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:37,698
I hear Kip Rogers is a big fag.

547
00:31:37,782 --> 00:31:39,951
Kip Rogers is not gay.
He's married.

548
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:45,206
Please, that's right up there with,
"He's not gay. He's in a fraternity."

549
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,633
My agent thinks that I have
a really good shot for this one.

550
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:57,970
Says they're just looking
for a face.

551
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:00,640
Doesn't that bother you?

552
00:32:00,723 --> 00:32:04,477
- That people think I'm attractive?
- That that's all they think.

553
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,813
That's not necessarily true.

554
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:09,649
When was the last time you got asked
to audition for a role?

555
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:12,611
It's always they want a look
or face...

556
00:32:12,694 --> 00:32:14,112
or nice eyes.

557
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:17,616
So what? Who gives a fuck?
That's my way in.

558
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:20,661
What matters is whether or not
I have the shit to back it up.

559
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:23,873
I guess.

560
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:28,336
- So you like this Kevin kid?
- He's nice enough, sure.

561
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,714
That's how you feel about him?
He's nice enough?

562
00:32:30,797 --> 00:32:32,758
Do I agree with his opinions
on the Middle East?

563
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:34,468
Forget I asked.

564
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:37,513
It's been a week.
Who knows what I feel?

565
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:40,933
I think if this is gonna be
another random you sleep with and dump--

566
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:44,061
- Another?
- You don't have the best track record.

567
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:47,148
- You're not taking home the gold.
- This isn't about me.

568
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:51,194
What is your excuse for not
settling down with one of your scams?

569
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:53,280
You don't even call them back.

570
00:32:53,363 --> 00:32:55,991
At least I have the decency
to date them for a little while.

571
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:58,035
Which brings me to my point.

572
00:32:58,118 --> 00:33:01,539
Why lead somebody on when you know
it's not gonna work out?

573
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:04,250
Because what if it does?

574
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,294
A relationship
can't be built on lust.

575
00:33:06,377 --> 00:33:11,007
No more than you can base a relationship
off coffee and good conversation...

576
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:13,719
but that works just fine
for our first date.

577
00:33:16,555 --> 00:33:18,140
There it is.

578
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,518
Well.

579
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:24,105
Have you gained weight?

580
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:25,898
What? Where?

581
00:33:27,317 --> 00:33:30,278
I can't help it.
Every night at about 1 1..00 it hits.

582
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:33,740
This awful panic that I'm gonna
have to spend another evening alone.

583
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:35,742
So I go over there.

584
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:39,371
- That's called being horny.
- It's not horny.

585
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:40,873
I know horny.

586
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:43,084
I've taken entire
lecture series on horny.

587
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,878
They have lecture series on horny?

588
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,880
They don't call it that.

589
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:50,633
You think I should
paint my toenails again?

590
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:56,598
Any time you hags
wanna join the game.

591
00:33:56,682 --> 00:33:59,977
I hate the outfield.
There's too much action.

592
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:06,150
Where did my mitt go?

593
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:13,074
Oh, say can you see

594
00:34:13,158 --> 00:34:15,577
How y'all doin'?

595
00:34:15,661 --> 00:34:18,622
You ready for this?
You ready for this one?

596
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:20,624
Attaboy, Taylor!

597
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,252
With a monarch's voice,
cry havoc...

598
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:26,380
and let slip the dogs of war!

599
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:29,300
Strike!

600
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:37,768
Our first game of the season, and they
pit us against the Hollywood Firemen?

601
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:41,939
Not only are they better than us,
they're a physical distraction.

602
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:43,566
Come on. Let's play.

603
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:46,068
Look at that.

604
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:50,865
Strike two.

605
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:55,078
You know, if he was smart,
he'd hurl himself in front of the ball.

606
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:57,873
- I tell you, it's the law of fractions.
- You're insane.

607
00:34:57,956 --> 00:34:59,917
Howie thinks one
of the other players is gay.

608
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,711
It's a known scientific fact
that one out of ten men is gay.

609
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:05,298
Including the bench, they've got
1 1 players. You do the math.

610
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:07,133
I dare you to share that with them.

611
00:35:09,761 --> 00:35:11,262
Thank you.

612
00:35:12,055 --> 00:35:14,099
Where's Cole?
He's up after Will.

613
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:17,561
I'll get him.

614
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:19,563
Strike three! You're out!

615
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:22,983
I don't understand why they don't
just let me hit off the tee.

616
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:24,985
Shut up, bitches.

617
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:37,874
You're up in two.

618
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:41,128
Thanks, Den.

619
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:54,643
So you're still deciding
if you're gay?

620
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:59,106
I'm going with the shortstop 'cause he's
the only one with the shirt tucked in.

621
00:36:00,232 --> 00:36:01,650
Benj, hold these.

622
00:36:01,734 --> 00:36:04,778
Cole, if you had to pick a mole
off the other team, who would it be?

623
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:08,574
No problem. Catcher.

624
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:10,326
Catcher? Yeah, right.

625
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,413
The biggest meanwhile on the team
is really gay? People think I'm crazy.

626
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:15,206
The guy's a total breeder.

627
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,251
First round at Jack's
says I'm right.

628
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:22,798
Who's the coach?

629
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:26,469
That's Jack. Loves baseball
and Hawaiian shirts.

630
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:29,806
- Shakespeare fan, huh?
- Classically trained.

631
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:34,436
Before he opened the restaurant,
he was a stage actor in New York.

632
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:37,063
See that man?
That's his partner of 20 years.

633
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:39,149
Plays piano at the restaurant.

634
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:40,859
Comes to all the games.

635
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:43,445
We call him Purple Guy,
for obvious reasons.

636
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:44,947
Yeah.

637
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:55,166
Hey, Mr. Catcher.

638
00:36:57,586 --> 00:36:59,087
You got a name?

639
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:01,256
Sure.

640
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,592
It's Low and Inside.

641
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:06,428
Strike!

642
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:10,933
- Thanks for the tip.
- Next time listen to me.

643
00:37:12,226 --> 00:37:15,104
My friends and I
have a little bet goin'...

644
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:18,608
that one of you fire boys plays on
our league, if you know what I mean.

645
00:37:18,692 --> 00:37:20,110
That's interesting.

646
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,822
- Who'd you bet on?
- You.

647
00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:25,366
Ball!

648
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,873
So do I win?

649
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,210
What tipped you off?

650
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:39,965
I've been up to bat twice, and twice
I've caught you staring at my ass.

651
00:37:41,049 --> 00:37:42,467
Ball.

652
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,187
So what are the chances
of me getting your number?

653
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,565
Sorry. I'm seeing someone.

654
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,733
So was I.

655
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,777
Strike two!

656
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,405
Two and two, batter.

657
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:04,366
I missed that one on purpose
so I could ask again.

658
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,828
What are the chances
of getting your number?

659
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:13,042
About the chance of you
hitting a home run.

660
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:21,593
Yeah, go!

661
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:27,474
Print neatly.

662
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:24,661
- You ever talk to him?
- Purple guy?

663
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:29,583
I thought he said hi to me once.
Turned out it was just a burp.

664
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:35,590
I wonder what Jack sees in him.

665
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:39,344
I don't know. Whatever it is,
though, he couldn't be happier.

666
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:43,765
The world's only prompt lesbians.

667
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:46,727
Well, I'm off.

668
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,438
- Wish me luck.
- You're not gonna do it.

669
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't get it.
Are we breaking up?

670
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,294
I don't get it.
Are we breaking up?

671
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:12,296
See, that's the thing.

672
00:40:12,379 --> 00:40:16,050
That you would think there
was actually something to break up...

673
00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:19,929
implies we were never really clear
on what we had to begin with.

674
00:40:20,013 --> 00:40:22,307
That lack of clarity...

675
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,808
well...

676
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:26,395
frightens me.

677
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:32,067
What?

678
00:40:32,151 --> 00:40:34,570
- What's up with them?
- Cole's breaking up with him.

679
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:37,532
In the course of six innings?
What happened?

680
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:40,910
He got the catcher's number.
The fucker was right.

681
00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:47,084
- Where's Kevin?
- He doesn't feel like coming.

682
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:49,128
Obviously.

683
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:51,505
- Something wrong here?
-Jig's up, Mr. Man.

684
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:54,050
We know all about this little
Heartbreak Hotel you're runnin'.

685
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:56,302
We're here to shut that shit down.

686
00:40:56,385 --> 00:40:59,639
Relax, Tex.
All I did is cool things off.

687
00:40:59,722 --> 00:41:02,142
Was that what you were doing behind
the bleachers, cooling things off?

688
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:09,107
- I had a change of heart. Shoot me.
- You're so full of shit.

689
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:12,152
I'm a little sick of your
self-righteous attitude lately.

690
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:16,866
You toss one scam out of bed,
and suddenly you are St.-fuckin'-Gandhi.

691
00:41:20,286 --> 00:41:24,165
You know what I meant.
Bottom line, that kid is a newbie.

692
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:26,668
He can't even admit to being gay.

693
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:29,671
What he needs right now are friends,
not a boyfriend.

694
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:32,800
Where you goin'?

695
00:41:32,883 --> 00:41:35,428
You're right.
What he needs now are friends.

696
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,395
- He wants to sleep with him.
- Thank you.

697
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:51,695
Hey, we're going to Jack's.
It's one of our many losing traditions.

698
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:53,822
-Just fuck off.
- You should come.

699
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:56,534
Everyone gets dumped
first time around.

700
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:59,620
It's the rule
of all newbie relationships.

701
00:41:59,704 --> 00:42:02,957
What happens next?
Do I become like you and your friends?

702
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:05,043
You don't even know my friends.

703
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:08,338
I know them well enough to know
you're a bunch of bitter, jaded--

704
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:10,674
Fags? Go ahead and say it.

705
00:42:10,757 --> 00:42:12,801
- I wasn't going to say that.
- You should.

706
00:42:12,885 --> 00:42:15,304
Maybe then you'd be less afraid
of what it means.

707
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:20,560
Why can't everything just slow down?

708
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:24,564
I promise it will,
but you can't go back now.

709
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:28,985
At least go have
a cup of coffee with me?

710
00:42:30,988 --> 00:42:33,365
- One condition.
- What?

711
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:35,367
West Hollywood's that way.

712
00:42:37,078 --> 00:42:40,915
Show me one thing
you find interesting that way.

713
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:43,835
- So you come here a lot?
- You could say that.

714
00:42:45,003 --> 00:42:47,130
In fact, next to Karen Carpenter...

715
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:49,591
this place is the closest thing
to perfection I know.

716
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:51,969
The Carpenters?
Now, that I get.

717
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,596
- You like the Carpenters?
- Insanely.

718
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,475
Here's to your first O.G.T.

719
00:42:57,558 --> 00:42:59,477
Obviously Gay Trait.

720
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,981
Mine are love of the Carpenters,
culinary interests...

721
00:43:03,022 --> 00:43:06,443
and intense fear of blood sports.

722
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:10,030
I don't get it. Why be friends with a
group of people just because you're gay?

723
00:43:10,113 --> 00:43:12,115
That's not why we're friends.

724
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:15,995
It may be why we became friends,
but that's not why we're friends.

725
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:20,666
- Doesn't that drive you crazy?
- Of course.

726
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:24,879
At least six times a year, I threaten
to move to Europe like my brother did.

727
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:27,132
Only I wouldn't go for just
a few months. I'd stay.

728
00:43:27,215 --> 00:43:31,511
I'd bring my camera, finally take
my time developing a photographer's eye.

729
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:34,515
Really find my voice.

730
00:43:36,058 --> 00:43:38,227
Then something happens.

731
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,813
A birthday, summer parties...

732
00:43:40,897 --> 00:43:43,358
Christmas,
great night of dancing.

733
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:46,194
And I'm with them and...

734
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:49,823
suddenly I can't imagine
being anywhere else.

735
00:43:49,906 --> 00:43:51,825
So I stay.

736
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:59,375
Have you told anybody
about what you're going through?

737
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,377
- A few people.
- Like?

738
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:05,798
- My sister.
- Ooh, that's worth at least ten points.

739
00:44:05,882 --> 00:44:09,344
Yeah, it wasn't planned. I was home
last Christmas, and she caught me.

740
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:11,888
- With a guy?
- No, alone.

741
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,308
By myself, flying solo.

742
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:16,685
Ouch. To what, gay porn?

743
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:18,979
Oh, no. Worse than that.

744
00:44:19,063 --> 00:44:21,732
An article on Antonio Sabato,Jr.

745
00:44:21,816 --> 00:44:26,070
I thought my mom would be cooler.
She was a '60s love child.

746
00:44:26,112 --> 00:44:29,199
In high school, she caught me
smoking pot with my friends.

747
00:44:29,282 --> 00:44:32,035
All she said was, "I hope you
didn't pay market for that."

748
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,248
But when I told her I was gay,
she didn't talk to me for a month.

749
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:38,167
- How is she now?
- Better.

750
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,920
Still refers to the homosexual
population as "the gays"...

751
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:43,673
like they live on her block
or somethin'.

752
00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:46,843
" Dennis, I see the gays had a parade.
Did you go?"

753
00:44:48,344 --> 00:44:50,263
My dad would have been different.

754
00:44:50,347 --> 00:44:53,392
- You didn't tell him?
- He died before I told anyone.

755
00:44:53,475 --> 00:44:55,853
My biggest regret:
he died not knowing me.

756
00:44:55,936 --> 00:44:59,106
You can't say that.
Maybe he didn't know--

757
00:44:59,148 --> 00:45:01,192
He died not knowing me.

758
00:45:05,863 --> 00:45:08,241
We want your sperm.
We're not asking you to move in.

759
00:45:08,324 --> 00:45:11,286
What about cousin Jeffrey?
He's got our genes. He could donate.

760
00:45:11,328 --> 00:45:13,955
Jeffrey's a Promise Keeper
and a card-carrying member of the NRA.

761
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:16,625
He doesn't have any genes
I'm interested in, Patrick.

762
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,794
I'm sorry.
My answer still stands.

763
00:45:18,877 --> 00:45:20,796
I told you we should have
drugged him and jerked him off.

764
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,965
Drug me and jerk--
Do you hear this?

765
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:25,134
This is the woman that you
want to become a mother with.

766
00:45:25,218 --> 00:45:27,679
- She's being serious.
- Okay.

767
00:45:27,762 --> 00:45:30,056
You two want the truth?
Here's the truth.

768
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,353
You guys can't keep a plant alive.
How are you gonna take care of a child?

769
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:38,816
We haven't even discussed the realities
of what this kid will have to deal with.

770
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:44,572
Are you prepared to answer, " Mom #1 ,
why is Mom #2's brother my father?"

771
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:48,326
Look at the three of us. What kind
of Christmas card is this gonna make?

772
00:45:48,368 --> 00:45:51,288
You know what?
I don't have to listen to this.

773
00:45:51,371 --> 00:45:54,875
I'm doing this for your sister because
she wanted to involve you in this.

774
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:58,337
She had this funny idea
that maybe if we did...

775
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,466
you'd get your shit together and start
taking responsibility for your life.

776
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,468
But I can see
that you'd rather not.

777
00:46:04,552 --> 00:46:07,472
That's fine with me.
I'm going to get the car.

778
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:12,477
Is that what this is about?
Some sort of mission to save me?

779
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,484
Patrick, when you came out...

780
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,321
you said it was because you couldn't
live the rest of your life in misery.

781
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,160
And I have never seen you
more miserable.

782
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:40,883
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
but the evidence is rudimentary.

783
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:43,135
There's not a single film
in the cinema canon...

784
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:46,514
that paints a portrait of a gay man
that any of us would aspire to be.

785
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:49,225
What are our options?
Noble, suffering AI DS victims...

786
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:52,520
the friends of noble,
suffering AI DS victims...

787
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,940
compulsive sex addicts,
common street hustlers...

788
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:57,567
and the most recent addition
to the lot...

789
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:59,820
stylish confidantes
to lovelorn women.

790
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:03,574
Just once I'd like to see
a gay character that is not sick...

791
00:47:03,616 --> 00:47:08,246
has not been laid in about three months
and is behind on his student loans.

792
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:10,415
And that's someone
you would aspire to be.

793
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:12,417
At least they would be someone real.

794
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,296
Can you imagine if they made a film
about us, our group of friends?

795
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:19,216
Maybe then we wouldn't have
to shamefully compare ourselves...

796
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:21,885
to "Steel Magnolias."

797
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:24,388
He is so Sally Fields.

798
00:47:24,472 --> 00:47:27,308
- I thought I was Sally Fields.
- No, you're Shirley MacLaine.

799
00:47:29,477 --> 00:47:31,271
Which one am I?

800
00:47:31,354 --> 00:47:32,772
Julia Roberts.

801
00:47:34,232 --> 00:47:36,151
For your nerves, honey.

802
00:47:43,701 --> 00:47:46,162
What are you doing here? We agreed
not to see each other in public.

803
00:47:46,245 --> 00:47:49,123
- I said it was too hard.
- I didn't know you were gonna be here.

804
00:47:49,207 --> 00:47:51,584
We had a game today.
We always come here after the game.

805
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,504
- I'm telling you, I forgot.
- Whatever.

806
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,592
Since you're here, if you want
to join us for a drink.

807
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,220
- I can't.
- You can't?

808
00:48:01,303 --> 00:48:03,138
I'm trying to tell you
that I can't.

809
00:48:03,222 --> 00:48:05,641
There are no tables available,
so it might be a while.

810
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:08,978
Oh, it's too busy here, so we should
probably go to the movie anyway.

811
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,480
Cool.

812
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,078
I didn't see you out there.

813
00:48:24,161 --> 00:48:25,371
I came in the back.

814
00:48:25,454 --> 00:48:29,417
I felt like an emergency piece
of cobbler before I faced the crowd.

815
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,461
How'd it go with the girls?

816
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:35,382
It went.

817
00:48:36,883 --> 00:48:39,136
I miss anything?

818
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:41,221
Same old song.

819
00:48:41,305 --> 00:48:44,350
Howie was going on about gay cinema.

820
00:48:44,433 --> 00:48:47,269
Sometimes I wonder what you boys
would do if you weren't gay.

821
00:48:47,353 --> 00:48:49,897
You'd have no identity.

822
00:48:49,981 --> 00:48:53,568
It was easy when you couldn't talk
about it. Now it's all you talk about.

823
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:56,488
You talk about it so much
that sometimes you forget about...

824
00:48:56,571 --> 00:48:58,657
all the other things that you are.

825
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:02,035
When I watch them,
it feels so strange.

826
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,747
It's like I'm not even a part of it.

827
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,166
They're all so much
more attractive than I am.

828
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:10,795
No. You know what?

829
00:49:10,878 --> 00:49:12,880
I don't mind. Really, I don't.

830
00:49:12,964 --> 00:49:15,133
I kind of like being attractive
by association.

831
00:49:15,216 --> 00:49:18,386
It's the closest I've ever gotten
to feeling beautiful.

832
00:49:20,055 --> 00:49:21,765
Help me put my dress on.

833
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:24,977
Jack, you're not going out
in drag tonight.

834
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,021
It's Saturday.
The crowd expects it.

835
00:49:27,104 --> 00:49:30,525
The madness has got to stop. You don't
even like wearing women's clothes.

836
00:49:30,608 --> 00:49:31,526
So?

837
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:33,987
So it's a disgrace
to drag performers everywhere.

838
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,030
Big fuckin' deal.

839
00:49:36,114 --> 00:49:39,367
And it completely plays into
the whole gay stereotype.

840
00:49:39,451 --> 00:49:41,662
Again, big fucking deal.

841
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:44,206
And your tits are always crooked.

842
00:49:44,957 --> 00:49:48,753
- No shit? Nobody ever told me that.
- Well, they are.

843
00:49:48,794 --> 00:49:50,630
Here, come here.

844
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,768
I've never felt a man up before.

845
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:04,144
There. That's--

846
00:50:04,228 --> 00:50:06,438
Okay. Zip me up, would you?

847
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:12,278
Oh, okay. All right.

848
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:20,537
Everybody can't be the same,
Patrick.

849
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,539
Everybody can't be straight.

850
00:50:22,622 --> 00:50:25,542
Everybody can't be beautiful.

851
00:50:25,626 --> 00:50:28,087
Some people
are just gay and average.

852
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:35,386
We're the strongest, I think.

853
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:57,243
Hello, boys! Hello.

854
00:50:57,327 --> 00:51:02,082
I'm sorry. I know we were supposed
to start two hours ago.

855
00:51:02,165 --> 00:51:06,378
But you know what they say?
Better latent than never.

856
00:51:06,462 --> 00:51:09,507
So to start with,
I'd like to do a little number...

857
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,842
from my first platinum album...

858
00:51:11,926 --> 00:51:13,761
Color Me Jack.

859
00:51:16,222 --> 00:51:18,349
Hit it, honey.

860
00:51:20,226 --> 00:51:24,439
Shall we join the ladies
Yes, do, let's join the ladies

861
00:51:24,523 --> 00:51:28,402
And make one great big lady

862
00:51:32,198 --> 00:51:34,700
You sure you don't want
to come in?

863
00:51:34,784 --> 00:51:38,037
I do. I'm just not ready
for it all yet.

864
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:40,915
- I have the same number as Cole.
- Don't worry.

865
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:42,292
I'll call.

866
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,794
Okay.

867
00:51:43,877 --> 00:51:45,003
Good night.

868
00:51:48,674 --> 00:51:50,092
Bye.

869
00:52:06,109 --> 00:52:09,947
Just checking a page.
I'm betting it's the fireman.

870
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,491
Which, incidentally,
would be record time.

871
00:52:12,575 --> 00:52:15,828
Yeah, but I just wanted
to apologize for earlier.

872
00:52:15,912 --> 00:52:19,040
- About Kevin.
- Oh, hey, no problem.

873
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:23,086
Holy shit. Holy shit.

874
00:52:23,169 --> 00:52:25,338
- What is it?
- No way. It's my agent.

875
00:52:25,422 --> 00:52:27,507
What's he saying?

876
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:30,886
I got the part.
I got the part in the movie.

877
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,264
- You're kidding me.
- Oh, my God.

878
00:52:33,347 --> 00:52:36,392
I leave in a week
to shoot for a month in Phoenix.

879
00:52:36,476 --> 00:52:38,561
Holy shit. I got the part
in Kip Rogers' movie.

880
00:52:38,645 --> 00:52:41,231
- I'll be in a movie with Kip Rogers.
- This is incredible.

881
00:52:41,272 --> 00:52:42,774
No kidding.

882
00:52:42,816 --> 00:52:46,111
- It's a small part, but,Jesus Christ--
- I heard Kip Rogers was gay.

883
00:52:46,153 --> 00:52:47,946
He's not gay. He's married.

884
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,240
I gotta tell the other guys.
They're gonna freak.

885
00:52:53,994 --> 00:52:58,583
Hey, listen. Tell the other hags
I'm leaving. I'll see you tomorrow.

886
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:00,210
Where are you going?

887
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:02,128
To my sister's.

888
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:05,423
To see if it's not too late to change
my mind about this whole baby thing.

889
00:53:05,507 --> 00:53:08,260
- What happened?
- Nothing.

890
00:53:08,302 --> 00:53:12,139
Nothing ever happens.
That's the whole point.

891
00:53:29,032 --> 00:53:32,202
You scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing here?

892
00:53:32,286 --> 00:53:35,414
I think that it's great
that you're dating again.

893
00:53:36,874 --> 00:53:38,543
Yeah, it is.

894
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:42,714
And it's not that I'm giving you
my approval, but I am approving.

895
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:47,844
- I'm going inside now.
- Wait. Come on.

896
00:53:47,886 --> 00:53:51,682
Let me just come inside,
just for a minute.

897
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:53,684
Until you get off?

898
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:56,062
- That is not true.
- No, no.

899
00:53:56,145 --> 00:53:58,064
You'll be kind enough
to share your latest theory...

900
00:53:58,147 --> 00:54:00,984
on why Snagglepuss was the first
openly gay cartoon character.

901
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:05,989
You know, if memory serves, it's
your post-coital hashish bonfires...

902
00:54:06,072 --> 00:54:09,826
- that sent me running.
- That is such a convenient argument.

903
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,287
My pot smoking is the source
of all our problems?

904
00:54:12,371 --> 00:54:15,207
God forbid it was symptomatic
of our fucked-up relationship.

905
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:18,628
I'm the one that studies
relationships for a living.

906
00:54:18,711 --> 00:54:21,381
- Ours was quite normal.
- Normal?

907
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:27,220
When did you once express any physical
affection outside of the bedroom?

908
00:54:27,304 --> 00:54:30,766
Do you know Brian actually
held my hand in public tonight?

909
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:34,311
Do you know what that's like to be with
someone who's not terrified to do that?

910
00:54:35,062 --> 00:54:39,775
You know, I congratulate Mr. Gorgeous
on his issue-less existence.

911
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,028
So that's what this is about.

912
00:54:43,404 --> 00:54:47,367
Brian's better-looking than you,
so I matter again.

913
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,330
But if he was ugly, you wouldn't
be here right now? Am I right?

914
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,504
Thanks for not answering that.

915
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:05,428
You know, Howie,
I didn't ask for much from you...

916
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:09,474
but it would be nice if your attraction
to me had something to do with me.

917
00:55:16,357 --> 00:55:20,528


918
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:22,905
My ex is dating a print model.

919
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:26,034
A blond, goy print model named Brian.

920
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:28,620
Could that possibly hit
on more of my issues?

921
00:55:28,703 --> 00:55:30,747
He could have a big penis.

922
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:33,125
Which one of you hags
suggested level eight? I'm dying.

923
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:35,753
- Let's bring it down to seven.
- Six, and I pick up lunch.

924
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:37,838
It's a deal.
Maybe he just wants to win you back.

925
00:55:37,922 --> 00:55:41,968
That's not Marshall's m.o. Unlike me,
he doesn't have a vengeful bone in him.

926
00:55:42,051 --> 00:55:45,305
- Meanwhile--
- You have the oddest taste.

927
00:55:45,388 --> 00:55:46,890
- Sue me.
- I don't understand.

928
00:55:46,973 --> 00:55:49,226
For months you've been guilty
that you ended the relationship.

929
00:55:49,309 --> 00:55:52,688
- He's moved on and you sound worse.
- Because my guilt I can control.

930
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:56,191
It's my guilt.
Jealousy is completely out of my hands.

931
00:55:56,275 --> 00:55:59,737
I'm with Dennis. How can you be jealous
about something that you gave up on?

932
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,656
I don't know.
I just know that it's over...

933
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:04,158
and you won't catch me going through
any mourning cycle.

934
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:06,369
Speaking of which, I haven't seen
Princess Taylor all week.

935
00:56:06,453 --> 00:56:09,331
He's been curled up on my couch,
watching old Joan Crawford movies.

936
00:56:09,372 --> 00:56:12,042
When I ask him what's wrong, he gives me
this sinister look and mutters...

937
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:15,629
- "Phase five, phase five."
- The revenge phase.

938
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:18,299
If I were you, I'd remove
all sharp objects from the house.

939
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:21,802
Is that what they're teaching you
in school these days, young Sigmund?

940
00:56:21,886 --> 00:56:24,222
Guys, is that the girl
from "Young and the Restless?"

941
00:56:24,305 --> 00:56:26,015
I'm so over "Y&R."

942
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:29,686
You're excited for him to call,
but you don't want to sleep with him?

943
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:31,938
Even if I wanted to sleep with him,
I wouldn't.

944
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:34,566
- So you do want to sleep with him.
- Why is it always about that?

945
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,902
Don't you see
what happens to us?

946
00:56:36,986 --> 00:56:40,698
We come out of the closet, we get our
hearts stepped on like a Twister game...

947
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,201
and we become more bitter
than we were in the closet.

948
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:46,746
The only thing keeping us from complete
despair are the friendships we develop.

949
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:48,915
I just want him to see that
before it's too late.

950
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:52,377
Before he becomes jaded,
like us.

951
00:56:52,419 --> 00:56:55,923
Interesting. What you're trying to do
is save yourself by saving Kevin.

952
00:56:56,006 --> 00:56:58,092
- It's classic projection.
- You haven't answered my question.

953
00:56:58,175 --> 00:57:01,178
- No, I don't want to sleep with him.
- Bullshit.

954
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:05,892
- Benji's talking to Idaho guy.
- Who's that?

955
00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:08,603
Idaho Guy
is Benji's newest crush.

956
00:57:08,686 --> 00:57:11,439
He's been strategically working out
near him for weeks...

957
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:13,442
in hopes
that Idaho Guy would notice.

958
00:57:13,525 --> 00:57:16,904
Why do you call him
Idaho Guy?

959
00:57:16,987 --> 00:57:19,990
I don't know. He just kind
of looks like he's from Idaho.

960
00:57:20,074 --> 00:57:22,743
It's not really one
of our better ones.

961
00:57:22,785 --> 00:57:24,120
I'm freaking out.

962
00:57:24,203 --> 00:57:27,916
I was in the middle of my squats and he
comes over and just gives me these tips.

963
00:57:27,999 --> 00:57:31,419
Is that like fate or what?
Maybe I should get his number.

964
00:57:31,503 --> 00:57:34,965
No way, little Benjamin. Gym bunnies
make a bad name for all of us.

965
00:57:35,048 --> 00:57:37,634
Their lives revolve around sex
and protein shakes.

966
00:57:37,718 --> 00:57:39,219
And cat tranquilizers.

967
00:57:39,303 --> 00:57:43,266
If you intend on experiencing the joys
of a bitter, codependent relationship...

968
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:44,934
it won't be
with a gym bunny.

969
00:57:45,017 --> 00:57:47,520
I don't care.
I'm going back over there.

970
00:57:47,604 --> 00:57:51,900
Hi. I turned around and you were gone.
I wanted to give you this.

971
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:55,028
It's my number.

972
00:57:55,946 --> 00:57:58,615
Give me a call if you want.

973
00:58:00,367 --> 00:58:01,827
Yeah, definitely.

974
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,829
That'll be cool.

975
00:58:27,647 --> 00:58:29,732
It's no improvement.

976
00:58:29,941 --> 00:58:32,319
I didn't pack a jacket.

977
00:58:32,402 --> 00:58:34,446
I hope Phoenix
doesn't get cold at night.

978
00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:36,281
Should we call a doctor?

979
00:58:42,163 --> 00:58:45,541
He'll be all right.Just as long
as he doesn't start boiling any rabbits.

980
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:51,339
You know what?
I almost forgot to tell you.

981
00:58:51,381 --> 00:58:53,592
That Kevin kid called
while you were at the gym.

982
00:58:53,675 --> 00:58:56,136
- He did?
- He said to call him back.

983
00:58:56,219 --> 00:58:59,097
Sounded kind of cold, though.
I hope he doesn't still hate me.

984
00:58:59,181 --> 00:59:00,683
They never still hate you.

985
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:04,562
It's funny, isn't it?
I'd hate me.

986
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:08,816
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'd hate you too.

987
00:59:08,858 --> 00:59:11,444
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

988
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,219
- "What is taking him so long?"
- I don't know.

989
00:59:37,472 --> 00:59:39,933
It'll just be another minute more.
I had to make a phone call.

990
00:59:40,017 --> 00:59:43,479
A phone call?
I knew he was gonna pull some shit.

991
00:59:43,562 --> 00:59:46,065
- Patrick, what happened?
- I couldn't do it.

992
00:59:46,148 --> 00:59:50,486
- I need material.
- They don't have material?

993
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:53,865
Well, the whole "Hustler" oeuvre isn't
exactly helping my cause right now.

994
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:58,620
Oh, my God. It's embarrassing
to even be seen in here.

995
00:59:58,704 --> 01:00:01,498
- Did you bring the stash?
- You owe me so big for this, hag.

996
01:00:01,582 --> 01:00:04,084
You know my issues
with buying porno.

997
01:00:07,713 --> 01:00:09,132
Hurry up!

998
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,979
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Oh, no, it's cool.

999
01:00:23,689 --> 01:00:25,608
Crank it.

1000
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:41,667
Call it crazy,
but I have this theory.

1001
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,169
Bear with me.

1002
01:00:44,253 --> 01:00:46,297
I believe that there
are gay numbers.

1003
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,010
- Gay numbers?
- Yeah.

1004
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:54,222
Have you ever given thought
to the number 38?

1005
01:01:08,195 --> 01:01:11,032
I've seen this sort
of thing before, Detective.

1006
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:14,661
The victim in the Miranda case
was done the exact same way.

1007
01:01:14,744 --> 01:01:17,914
Cut. That was perfect.
Print.

1008
01:01:47,863 --> 01:01:50,575
I was so glad
that Sharon set us up.

1009
01:01:50,658 --> 01:01:54,162
She mentioned you at her last cleaning,
but she said you were involved.

1010
01:01:55,497 --> 01:01:59,334
- I used to be.
- Well, I know how that goes.

1011
01:01:59,376 --> 01:02:02,838
I was in this long-term relationship
with this guy once for five months.

1012
01:02:02,921 --> 01:02:06,467
Five months and he broke up with me.
He broke up with me.

1013
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:10,221
He said I talk too much. Is that not
the most ridiculous thing you've heard?

1014
01:02:10,304 --> 01:02:12,223
Cause I'm all about listening.

1015
01:02:39,085 --> 01:02:42,631
I know what you're thinking.
Why would a gay man wanna be a gyno?

1016
01:02:42,714 --> 01:02:45,592
I mean, most gay men can't even say
the word "vagina"...

1017
01:02:45,634 --> 01:02:47,928
let alone stare at them
all day long.

1018
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:50,973
But it never really bothered me.
I mean, it's just a word, right?

1019
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:53,559
Vagina, vagina, vagina.

1020
01:02:55,561 --> 01:02:57,564
It's just a word, right?

1021
01:02:57,605 --> 01:03:00,275
I'll tell you the word
that sort of does get me, though.

1022
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:01,818
Clitoris.

1023
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,250
Why am I shaking?

1024
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,419
It's your first gay club.
You should be nervous.

1025
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,006
If anybody attacks you,
just tell them you're with me.

1026
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:23,884
Nice to see you again. Things are
better with the breakup, I take it?

1027
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,594
- Breakup?
- With Paul?

1028
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:26,970
Paul who?

1029
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:29,098
It's phase six.

1030
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:31,726
It's denial.

1031
01:03:49,244 --> 01:03:51,038
Oh, my God.

1032
01:03:51,121 --> 01:03:53,040
I've been looking
for you guys all night.

1033
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:56,085
- You want a drink?
- No. I have water here somewhere.

1034
01:03:56,169 --> 01:03:58,796
- Where's Idaho Guy?
- Where's this new boyfriend of yours?

1035
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,465
Dance floor.

1036
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:03,093
You guys, everybody's here.
Come on. Come and dance.

1037
01:04:03,176 --> 01:04:05,846
Fly, young one.
Fly like the wind.

1038
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,848
Come on. Dance with your mama.

1039
01:04:09,642 --> 01:04:13,312
- So what do you think? Ecstasy?
- I don't know. Probably K.

1040
01:04:13,354 --> 01:04:14,897
Should we talk to him?

1041
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:17,066
They said,
finishing their fourth shot.

1042
01:04:17,316 --> 01:04:19,527
We've all messed around with stuff
and you know it.

1043
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:21,655
He's just having a good time.
Let's go dance.

1044
01:04:21,738 --> 01:04:24,407
Dance? We're here
to attract men, remember?

1045
01:04:24,491 --> 01:04:26,576
Speak for yourself.
This body wants to groove.

1046
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,078
Come on.

1047
01:04:29,288 --> 01:04:31,832
Howie? Howie Mixner?

1048
01:04:31,916 --> 01:04:34,961
Barry.
We had dinner a few weeks ago?

1049
01:05:26,704 --> 01:05:30,354


1050
01:05:31,438 --> 01:05:33,190
I got one.

1051
01:05:33,274 --> 01:05:37,153
Who would you kick out of bed?
Morley Safer or Mike Wallace?

1052
01:05:37,236 --> 01:05:40,949
Okay, I believe this requires
a daiquiri break.

1053
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,827
- I'd say Safer.
- Safer all the way.

1054
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:47,706
But I would kick them both out of bed
for Ed Bradley circa 1 980.

1055
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:51,210
I'd kick Wallace.
He always annoyed me.

1056
01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:52,586
Who's got the 30?

1057
01:05:52,628 --> 01:05:56,674
- What are you doing outside?
- I'm getting base.

1058
01:05:56,757 --> 01:05:59,886
It's July 4.
You don't have a base yet?

1059
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:02,013
Have you heard
from the movie star yet?

1060
01:06:02,096 --> 01:06:04,224
He only called once all month.
I missed it.

1061
01:06:04,307 --> 01:06:06,685
He's too busy getting shtupped
by Kip Rogers.

1062
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:08,687
When will you guys get over
the fact that just because...

1063
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:11,482
every gay man in America
wants Kip Rogers to be gay...

1064
01:06:11,565 --> 01:06:13,651
that doesn't mean
he is gay.

1065
01:06:13,734 --> 01:06:15,903
You know what?
I should get going.

1066
01:06:15,986 --> 01:06:18,656
- You're not staying for the party?
- I gotta make an appearance...

1067
01:06:18,698 --> 01:06:20,658
at my parent's barbecue.

1068
01:06:24,329 --> 01:06:26,081
- Have fun.
- Bye.

1069
01:06:26,164 --> 01:06:28,625
- I've got another one.
- Who would you kick out of bed?

1070
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:30,669
The Grimace
or the Hamburglar?

1071
01:06:30,752 --> 01:06:32,713
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1072
01:06:32,796 --> 01:06:35,674
- That's a good one.
- Homo say what?

1073
01:06:36,509 --> 01:06:38,261
Homo say bad party lighting.

1074
01:06:39,512 --> 01:06:40,972
Get out.

1075
01:06:44,976 --> 01:06:47,979
- Did you lock the door?
- I don't remember.

1076
01:06:48,063 --> 01:06:50,732
Shit. One second!

1077
01:07:01,035 --> 01:07:02,286
Yeah?

1078
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:04,539
- You're going to shoot in five.
- Terrific.

1079
01:07:04,622 --> 01:07:08,543
- All right. Cappuccino?
- No, no. No, thank you.

1080
01:07:08,585 --> 01:07:10,921
- I'll see you out there.
- Okay. All right.

1081
01:07:20,515 --> 01:07:23,476
- That was close.
- A little too close.

1082
01:07:27,564 --> 01:07:29,191
I have to cancel tonight.

1083
01:07:29,232 --> 01:07:32,236
My publicist wants me to do
this "Access Hollywood" interview.

1084
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,905
Today's my last day of shooting.
I leave tomorrow.

1085
01:07:34,988 --> 01:07:38,075
- What would you like me to do?
- Cancel it.

1086
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:40,286
- Tell them you can't do it.
- With what excuse?

1087
01:07:40,369 --> 01:07:43,831
"Sorry. I have dinner plans with
the pretty boy extra I'm sleeping with."

1088
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:47,794
- I'm not an extra.
- That's not what I meant.

1089
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:50,088
They have me shooting here
for four weeks.

1090
01:07:50,172 --> 01:07:53,675
My part is integral to the plot.
I have seven lines of dialogue.

1091
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:56,804
- I'm not a fucking extra.
- Okay, okay.

1092
01:07:56,887 --> 01:07:59,181
I'm sorry
I called you an extra.

1093
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:04,520
I'll make it up to you.
I'll fly into L.A. this weekend.

1094
01:08:04,604 --> 01:08:07,482
We'll go somewhere discreet
for dinner.

1095
01:08:07,565 --> 01:08:09,943
- All right?
- Okay.

1096
01:08:11,319 --> 01:08:12,779
Good.

1097
01:08:15,282 --> 01:08:18,953
Wait about ten minutes. Make sure
no one sees you before you leave.

1098
01:08:33,427 --> 01:08:36,597
Hey, having fun? Good.

1099
01:08:43,646 --> 01:08:46,232
Hey, there you are.

1100
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:48,568
How you doing?

1101
01:08:50,153 --> 01:08:52,072
Everything all right?

1102
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:56,618
What happened?

1103
01:09:00,498 --> 01:09:02,083
You told your parents.

1104
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:04,210
Just kind of slipped out.

1105
01:09:04,293 --> 01:09:08,673
The three of us were in the kitchen,
helping them with dessert...

1106
01:09:08,757 --> 01:09:12,177
and my mom mentioned
that she'd made key lime pie.

1107
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:17,015
I said, "That's great.
I love key lime pie, and I'm gay."

1108
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:20,436
I bet she wishes
she'd made apple pie.

1109
01:09:24,857 --> 01:09:26,401
They were great, Dennis.

1110
01:09:26,484 --> 01:09:30,196
And then I started thinking,
why was I so scared to tell them?

1111
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,325
Why was I so scared
to tell everyone?

1112
01:09:34,409 --> 01:09:38,038
- If I hadn't met you--
- Oh, I didn't do anything.

1113
01:10:24,922 --> 01:10:26,466
Morning.

1114
01:10:30,887 --> 01:10:33,473
We're gonna be late
for the game.

1115
01:10:40,773 --> 01:10:45,486
Once more unto the breach,
dear lads! Once more!

1116
01:10:48,823 --> 01:10:51,910
It's the height of irony, really.

1117
01:10:51,951 --> 01:10:55,080
Here we are, bottom of the ninth.
Three men on. Two outs.

1118
01:10:55,122 --> 01:10:56,915
Our least able player
stepping up to bat.

1119
01:10:56,957 --> 01:10:59,752
We're either one hit away
from our first victory ever...

1120
01:10:59,793 --> 01:11:04,924
or three strikes away from going down
as the worst softball team in history.

1121
01:11:04,965 --> 01:11:07,426
If we could just get him
to hit it to left field.

1122
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:11,139
The sad thing is,
he catches so much better than I do.

1123
01:11:14,601 --> 01:11:17,354
Come on, Taylor.
You can do it. Come on.

1124
01:11:35,498 --> 01:11:37,417
Attaboy!

1125
01:11:41,296 --> 01:11:43,841
Sweet are the uses
of adversity.

1126
01:12:19,338 --> 01:12:22,424
"Sweet are the uses
of adversity...

1127
01:12:22,508 --> 01:12:26,470
which, like the toad,
ugly and venomous...

1128
01:12:26,554 --> 01:12:29,849
wears yet a precious jewel
in his head.

1129
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:32,435
And this is our life...

1130
01:12:32,518 --> 01:12:35,063
exempt from public haunt...

1131
01:12:35,146 --> 01:12:38,358
finds tongues and trees...

1132
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,028
books in running brooks...

1133
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:43,697
sermons in stones...

1134
01:12:43,781 --> 01:12:47,076
and good in everything."

1135
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:49,537
Jack was a Shakespeare fan.

1136
01:12:49,579 --> 01:12:53,708
That passage from "As You Like It"
was his favorite.

1137
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:56,836
He would've wanted me
to share it with you today.

1138
01:12:57,921 --> 01:13:01,383
Other than that,
I'm not good with words.

1139
01:13:01,425 --> 01:13:02,593
That was Jack.

1140
01:13:07,139 --> 01:13:10,017
I'll just play something.

1141
01:13:10,101 --> 01:13:13,771
Hopefully, wherever Jack is...

1142
01:13:13,855 --> 01:13:16,066
he'll sing along.

1143
01:13:29,664 --> 01:13:31,624
That's what Jack saw in him.

1144
01:13:51,938 --> 01:13:54,774
- So where's Brian?
- Getting the car.

1145
01:14:01,114 --> 01:14:03,033
You look terrific.

1146
01:14:06,245 --> 01:14:10,541
You don't have to say anything just
because I'm standing in front of you.

1147
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:13,461
I'm not just saying.

1148
01:14:15,004 --> 01:14:16,881
Thank you.

1149
01:14:19,384 --> 01:14:21,803
I quit smoking pot.

1150
01:14:21,845 --> 01:14:25,307
It's not 'cause we're not dating.
No, it's not because of Brian. I just--

1151
01:14:27,184 --> 01:14:29,562
It was just time.

1152
01:14:30,855 --> 01:14:34,734
It's weird how you can need something
for so long and then just...

1153
01:14:34,817 --> 01:14:36,319
not need it anymore.

1154
01:14:36,361 --> 01:14:38,321
Just like that.

1155
01:14:54,714 --> 01:14:58,301
It's so weird, you know.
It's like he's still here.

1156
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:01,137
You're on something right now,
aren't you?

1157
01:15:02,055 --> 01:15:05,976
- Excuse me?
- You show up late. You look like shit.

1158
01:15:06,059 --> 01:15:08,896
- What did that boyfriend give you?
- He didn't give me anything.

1159
01:15:08,938 --> 01:15:11,524
I look like shit because I've
been crying for the last two days.

1160
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:14,110
Unlike you, who has yet to shed a tear,
you fucking asshole.

1161
01:15:14,193 --> 01:15:16,905
- He wants to make sure you're okay.
- We all do.

1162
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:19,282
That's crap. Since I've have a boyfriend
none of you guys even call.

1163
01:15:19,366 --> 01:15:22,536
- You stopped calling us.
- That is such bullshit.

1164
01:15:22,577 --> 01:15:25,998
Admit that you don't talk to me because
I'm in a relationship and you're not.

1165
01:15:26,081 --> 01:15:28,334
You're a muscle boy's plaything
for a couple of weeks.

1166
01:15:28,417 --> 01:15:30,503
That hardly constitutes
a relationship.

1167
01:15:30,586 --> 01:15:33,381
That is more than you've ever had,
you ugly fuck.

1168
01:15:37,844 --> 01:15:40,263
His friends...

1169
01:15:40,347 --> 01:15:42,307
they're not like us.

1170
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:46,019
When they go out,
when they're together, they're happy.

1171
01:15:46,103 --> 01:15:48,564
We're always so miserable.

1172
01:15:48,605 --> 01:15:51,942
We make each other miserable.

1173
01:15:52,026 --> 01:15:54,445
Why?

1174
01:15:54,529 --> 01:15:56,698
Is it such a bad thing
to be happy?

1175
01:15:56,781 --> 01:15:59,701
It is if you have to pay
30 bucks a tab for it, yeah.

1176
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:09,420
- What did I miss?
- You don't even wanna know.

1177
01:16:09,461 --> 01:16:13,090
Just spoke to Purple Guy.
He said he'll meet us at the bar.

1178
01:16:13,132 --> 01:16:16,719
I can't go. I'm supposed to have dinner
with some people from the film.

1179
01:16:16,803 --> 01:16:19,597
- Maybe I'll catch up after.
- Yeah.

1180
01:16:21,307 --> 01:16:23,727
I'm not gonna go either.
I'm gonna go home.

1181
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:26,063
I'll talk to you guys tomorrow.

1182
01:16:37,408 --> 01:16:39,160
You should go with them.

1183
01:16:39,244 --> 01:16:41,496
I thought maybe we could talk
about the other night.

1184
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:45,709
- We haven't really discussed--
- Now's not a good time.

1185
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:48,754
- Could you tell me when is?
- I don't know. But not here, not now.

1186
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:52,424
You've barely even looked at me
since the other night.

1187
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:54,218
You've spent all week hiding
behind this funeral.

1188
01:16:54,301 --> 01:16:57,054
Hiding? Is that what
you think I've been doing?

1189
01:16:57,138 --> 01:16:59,474
Can you even imagine
whatJack meant to me? To us?

1190
01:16:59,515 --> 01:17:03,019
No, you can't.
You can't know.

1191
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:05,439
So don't tell me
I've been hiding.

1192
01:17:05,522 --> 01:17:08,483
All we did was hook up.
It's not that big a deal.

1193
01:17:08,525 --> 01:17:10,152
We can talk about it later.

1194
01:17:10,986 --> 01:17:14,490
You're right.
It's not a big deal.

1195
01:17:14,573 --> 01:17:16,659
All we did was hook up.

1196
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,071
Yeah, this is he.

1197
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:26,573
What?

1198
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:29,159
Jesus!

1199
01:20:32,037 --> 01:20:33,956
Benji Waters?

1200
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,906
I just got the page.
How is he?

1201
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:07,492
They pumped his stomach.
We're waiting for him to wake up.

1202
01:21:07,575 --> 01:21:10,704
- Can I see him?
- Only one person at a time can go in.

1203
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:12,789
- Patrick's in there right now.
- How did this happen?

1204
01:21:12,873 --> 01:21:15,459
- How the fuck could this happen?
- Isn't it obvious?

1205
01:21:16,335 --> 01:21:18,295
We weren't there.

1206
01:21:19,713 --> 01:21:23,175
Did you two come together?
I think that's cute.

1207
01:21:25,428 --> 01:21:26,888
What is his problem?

1208
01:21:28,139 --> 01:21:30,767
Him and Kevin slept together
last week.

1209
01:21:30,809 --> 01:21:34,438
You, Senor Disheveled, obviously came
from sleeping with Kevin yourself.

1210
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:37,483
- Are the clouds lifting?
- You guys, I didn't know.

1211
01:21:37,566 --> 01:21:40,194
I've been away all month.
Why didn't you tell me something?

1212
01:21:40,277 --> 01:21:42,571
- You could help me out.
- It was a secret.

1213
01:21:43,322 --> 01:21:44,657
Terrific.

1214
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:49,788
The one time you bastards actually keep
a secret is the one time it matters.

1215
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:51,289
Now I feel like shit.

1216
01:21:51,331 --> 01:21:55,085
I think that's
a scientific impossibility.

1217
01:21:57,796 --> 01:22:00,215
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't be.

1218
01:22:00,299 --> 01:22:02,218
I slept with Cole
to get back at you.

1219
01:22:02,301 --> 01:22:05,221
You did exactly what you're supposed to
when you're 23 and just out the closet.

1220
01:22:05,304 --> 01:22:07,265
And you did it
because I was an asshole.

1221
01:22:07,348 --> 01:22:09,350
It doesn't matter.
I was wrong.

1222
01:22:09,434 --> 01:22:11,895
No, Kevin. I was wrong.

1223
01:22:11,978 --> 01:22:15,399
When I slept with you, I knew it
couldn't lead to a relationship.

1224
01:22:15,482 --> 01:22:18,819
And if there was anything I've been
trying to change lately about myself...

1225
01:22:20,571 --> 01:22:22,573
well, that would be it.

1226
01:22:22,656 --> 01:22:24,867
So what,
you're not attracted to me?

1227
01:22:24,951 --> 01:22:29,372
Or course I am. I've been crazy about
you ever since you lit the damn candles.

1228
01:22:35,379 --> 01:22:39,383
- You were the wish.
- So what's the problem?

1229
01:22:41,385 --> 01:22:44,805
The problem is
that I'm not ready for it.

1230
01:22:44,889 --> 01:22:47,517
I thought that...

1231
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,895
all a relationship would take
was meeting the right person...

1232
01:22:50,979 --> 01:22:53,106
but it's so much more than that.

1233
01:22:53,189 --> 01:22:55,150
Like what?

1234
01:22:55,233 --> 01:22:59,655
Like the fact that I'm 28 years old and
the only thing I'm good at is being gay.

1235
01:23:00,447 --> 01:23:03,033
- That's not true.
- It is true.

1236
01:23:03,117 --> 01:23:06,078
And I'm okay with it.

1237
01:23:06,162 --> 01:23:10,250
I didn't get to be gay for 25 years.
I figured I got some catching up to do.

1238
01:23:13,378 --> 01:23:15,297
But I need to move on.

1239
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:18,383
I need to make my life
into something else...

1240
01:23:19,718 --> 01:23:23,848
instead of just my friends
and the parties.

1241
01:23:23,931 --> 01:23:28,728
That's the only way I'll have something
to give back to someone.

1242
01:23:32,398 --> 01:23:34,442
Do you see that?

1243
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:38,989
Tell me you see that.

1244
01:23:39,823 --> 01:23:41,867
Can't you move on
with someone there?

1245
01:23:42,952 --> 01:23:46,038
Not if that someone
has a lot of catching up to do.

1246
01:24:08,646 --> 01:24:10,106
Hey, guys.

1247
01:24:10,148 --> 01:24:11,983
Hey, hag.

1248
01:24:12,066 --> 01:24:14,486
Why'd you go and do
a thing like that for?

1249
01:24:14,569 --> 01:24:15,946
I'm sorry, guys.

1250
01:24:17,322 --> 01:24:20,450
- I'm sorry, Patrick.
- Hey, I'm sorry too.

1251
01:24:23,412 --> 01:24:26,082
I am so Demi Moore
in "St. Elmo's" right now.

1252
01:24:27,249 --> 01:24:30,044
You can be Demi Moore.
Just as long as I'm not Ally Sheedy.

1253
01:24:30,128 --> 01:24:34,466
- I get to be Mare Winningham.
- Nobody's gonna fight you on that one.

1254
01:24:35,383 --> 01:24:38,303
- Which one do I get to be?
- Rob Lowe.

1255
01:24:41,807 --> 01:24:44,184
Cause you're just
so damn cute.

1256
01:24:44,268 --> 01:24:46,187
You can't help yourself.

1257
01:25:00,744 --> 01:25:03,455
Marshall, I don't care
if you're not alone.

1258
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:07,209
Marshall, open up.

1259
01:25:11,714 --> 01:25:14,467
What the hell are you doing?

1260
01:25:14,551 --> 01:25:16,010
This.

1261
01:25:16,052 --> 01:25:20,390
- All right, that's it, asshole.
- Brian. Please, get inside.

1262
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:29,775
You told me once that you
were waiting for me to wake up.

1263
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:33,237
You didn't wait long enough.

1264
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:35,573
I've never been more awake
than I am right now.

1265
01:25:36,783 --> 01:25:39,911
And I admit it. I fucked up.
No matter who you were...

1266
01:25:39,995 --> 01:25:43,415
there would've been something wrong
with you and someone better out there.

1267
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:47,253
And I wish
that I could change that.

1268
01:25:47,294 --> 01:25:51,007
I wish I could take back all the times
that I didn't appreciate having you.

1269
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:53,634
But I'll tell you right now...

1270
01:25:53,718 --> 01:25:55,637
I loved you.

1271
01:25:57,389 --> 01:26:01,059
I still love you.
And it has nothing to do with me.

1272
01:26:01,101 --> 01:26:03,854
It has nothing to do
with how good-looking he is.

1273
01:26:03,937 --> 01:26:07,483
It has to do with you.

1274
01:26:07,566 --> 01:26:11,237
Because you are sweet,
you're endearing and...

1275
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:14,657
uncomplicated.

1276
01:26:14,741 --> 01:26:17,160
And you're so beautiful.

1277
01:26:17,243 --> 01:26:21,164
I hope that you're happy together.
I hope that this...

1278
01:26:22,457 --> 01:26:26,003
works out and that he is
everything that you need...

1279
01:26:26,086 --> 01:26:28,005
because you deserve it.

1280
01:26:28,088 --> 01:26:32,093
But if he's not and it ends,
I'll be there.

1281
01:26:34,929 --> 01:26:37,974
It's my turn to wait,
and I'm going to wait long enough.

1282
01:26:52,365 --> 01:27:00,707


1283
01:27:02,209 --> 01:27:04,753
- "You really don't need to be here."
- "Okay, I'm here..."

1284
01:27:04,836 --> 01:27:07,005
because Anne had a showing
and she asked me to be here...

1285
01:27:07,089 --> 01:27:10,217
and because the baby book
said this is an emotional event.

1286
01:27:10,301 --> 01:27:13,346
And no matter how tough you think
you are, you might need somebody.

1287
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:16,474
- Is this ready yet?
- No. It takes a second to come through.

1288
01:27:16,516 --> 01:27:19,644
Why don't you just sit down
and let the man do his job?

1289
01:27:19,728 --> 01:27:23,231
- Why don't you bite me?
- Why don't you suck my left tit?

1290
01:27:23,315 --> 01:27:25,359
- If I sucked tits--
- Excuse me.

1291
01:27:26,318 --> 01:27:28,612
It's ready now.

1292
01:27:32,366 --> 01:27:33,576
That's the baby.

1293
01:27:50,928 --> 01:27:54,223
Miss Thing, where have you been? I have
a full restaurant. I'm a waiter short.

1294
01:27:54,307 --> 01:27:56,059
I was at the closing on my house.
I'm sorry.

1295
01:27:56,142 --> 01:27:58,895
Sorry don't feed the bulldog, sugar.
Get your apron on.

1296
01:27:58,937 --> 01:28:02,524
Question. How much does Purple Guy
pay you to be such a bitch?

1297
01:28:02,607 --> 01:28:06,486
It's your last night, hag. So you don't
have to worry about that now, do you?

1298
01:28:08,822 --> 01:28:11,283
Surprise!

1299
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:50,576
I had forgotten Dennis
knew this many meanwhiles.

1300
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:53,245
I know. They're from
all of his house parties.

1301
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:56,499
So, did Leslie tell you?
We saw the baby.

1302
01:28:56,582 --> 01:29:01,921
Oh, that is so cool.
So is it a Patricia or a Patrick,Jr.?

1303
01:29:01,963 --> 01:29:03,924
It's a Jack.

1304
01:29:05,133 --> 01:29:07,761
I'm an actor.
I just shot this film with Kip Rogers.

1305
01:29:07,803 --> 01:29:10,389
Kip Rogers. Wow.

1306
01:29:10,472 --> 01:29:12,391
I hear he's gay.

1307
01:29:12,474 --> 01:29:14,685
No, he's not gay.
He's married.

1308
01:29:14,769 --> 01:29:17,271
Okay, so check this shit out.

1309
01:29:17,355 --> 01:29:19,565
Paul called me.

1310
01:29:19,649 --> 01:29:22,944
He said he wants to talk. He said
he misses me, but just as a friend.

1311
01:29:22,986 --> 01:29:25,489
This is a good thing.
It allows you the perfect opportunity...

1312
01:29:25,572 --> 01:29:28,909
for the final phase
of all relationships: reconciliation.

1313
01:29:28,992 --> 01:29:32,246
Try closure.
I told that bitch to fuck off.

1314
01:29:32,329 --> 01:29:35,458
Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck in traffic on the 405.

1315
01:29:35,499 --> 01:29:40,046
I told you not to take the freeways.
L.A. is all about the side streets.

1316
01:29:44,718 --> 01:29:47,137
It's for Europe.
It's a carrying case for your camera.

1317
01:29:47,179 --> 01:29:49,264
Look, got your initials on it.

1318
01:29:54,603 --> 01:29:57,648
I saw that guy you came with.
He's cute.

1319
01:29:57,732 --> 01:30:00,318
Whatever. We met at a club
a few weeks ago.

1320
01:30:00,401 --> 01:30:02,737
- You know how it is.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

1321
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:06,491
I'll be back.

1322
01:30:07,492 --> 01:30:08,744
I'll be here.

1323
01:30:10,329 --> 01:30:12,623
- Okay, hag, you ready for your gift?
- Excuse us.

1324
01:30:12,706 --> 01:30:16,460
- You didn't have to get me a gift.
- We didn't get you anything. You did.

1325
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:19,714
- It was nothing, really.
- Gentlemen and very few ladies...

1326
01:30:19,797 --> 01:30:21,758
I am pleased to present...

1327
01:30:21,841 --> 01:30:24,761
the premiere
photo gallery opening...

1328
01:30:24,844 --> 01:30:26,972
of budding photojournalist...

1329
01:30:27,055 --> 01:30:31,393
our very own European-bound
Mr. Dennis Schiff.

1330
01:30:49,037 --> 01:30:53,208
- Where did you guys get these?
- Taylor and I stole your negatives.

1331
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,169
This one's out of focus.

1332
01:30:55,252 --> 01:30:57,588
After a few drinks,
it'll look fine.

1333
01:30:58,589 --> 01:31:02,844
Taylor, get the pitchers.
The drinking games are about to begin.

1334
01:31:02,927 --> 01:31:05,805
Let's play
"Who Can Act Straight the Longest."

1335
01:31:17,568 --> 01:31:20,571
A lot of people ask me
when I first knew I was gay.

1336
01:31:20,613 --> 01:31:24,492
Fact is, I don't know.
I can't remember.

1337
01:31:24,576 --> 01:31:27,078
But what I do remember,
what I can recall...

1338
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,123
is the moment
I first realized it was okay.

1339
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:34,128
It was when I met these guys...

1340
01:31:34,211 --> 01:31:36,255
my friends.

1341
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:50,000
