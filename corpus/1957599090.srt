00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,902
DUDE.

183
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,403
DUDE, DUDE, DUDE.

184
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,573
DUDE, CHECK IT OUT.

185
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,942
[SNORING]

186
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,618
HEY, WHAT THE HELL?

187
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,054
NOT VERY FRIENDLY, ARE YOU? HEY.

188
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,989
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WOKE ME UP.

189
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,691
I KNOW.

190
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,492
OH, YOU DO, HUH?

191
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,928
WELL, YOU SEE, I HEARD THAT THERE'S THIS AMERICAN GUY

192
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,364
NAMED BOG WHO WAS VERY HANDSOME,

193
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,699
AND I'D LIKE TO MEET HIM.

194
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,201
GREAT. MY NAME'S JEREMY.

195
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:29,902
THE OTHER GUY'S BOG.

196
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,937
THE ONE WHO SLEEPS ABOVE YOU?

197
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,505
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

198
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,040
BUT THERE MUST BE A MISTAKE.

199
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,342
I'M SURE IT WAS BOG WHO WAS HANDSOME.

200
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,011
YOU MEAN, YOU THINK I'M BETTER-LOOKING?

201
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,079
OH, PLEASE,

202
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:40,980
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

203
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,515
I WOULDN'T WANT TO HURT ANYONE'S FEELINGS.

204
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,617
AND IT'S NOT THAT HE'S UGLY.

205
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,718
IT'S JUST THAT HE'S...

206
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,486
NOT A WORD, I PROMISE.

207
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,555
PROMISE?

208
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,024
YEAH. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

209
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,425
LEMMYA.

210
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,060
LEMMYA.

211
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,428
I LIKE THAT NAME.

212
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,465
THANK YOU.

213
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,105
OH, I'VE GOT TO CHECK ON MY BOARD.

214
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:10,209
WATCH YOUR HEAD IT'S FIBER, SEE.

215
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,679
MANGO PANCAKES FOR BREAKFAST. MMM.

216
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:14,713
YOU THINK IT'LL PLEASE THEM?

217
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,716
I'M NOT PLEASED WITH OUR DAUGHTER AT THE MOMENT.

218
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,519
THEY'RE CRASHING ON ME, AND I'M LIKE THIS.

219
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,321
AND I GOTTA BREAK THROUGH...

220
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,056
HE SEEMS LIKE A VERY NICE YOUNG MAN.

221
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,691
HE'S A CRAZY PERSON.

222
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,760
SURFING AT LILO CAY...

223
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,229
YOU SEE, LEMMYA, WAX ON THE BOARD

224
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,298
ALLOWS YOUR FEET TO HAVE MAXIMUM MOVEMENT.

225
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,466
THE REST IS UP TO YOU AND YOUR BALANCE.

226
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,002
YOU'RE VERY INTELLIGENT, TOO.

227
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,504
STOP IT.

228
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,506
HEY, DOGFACE. WHERE YOU BEEN?

229
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,574
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE, BLONDIE?

230
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,010
WHAT'S THAT SHIT? YOU'LL FIND OUT.

231
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:45,978
Zack: WHAT DO YOU SAY?

232
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,081
YOU NUT JOBS READY TO MAKE A LITTLE HISTORY?

233
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,182
BORN READY.

234
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,751
FANTASTIC.

235
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,382
ANYONE WANT SOME MORE MANGO JUICE?

236
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,084

00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,488
YES, PLEASE. I'D LOVE SOME.

238
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,426
YOU KNOW, LEMMYA,

239
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,328
THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST FRENCH TOAST

240
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,696
I'VE EVER HAD.

241
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,765
SILLY, THESE ARE PANCAKES.

242
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,737
[SCREAMING]

243
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,206
Man: GET OUT! GET OUT!

00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,623
LILO CAY OFF PORT BOW!

245
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,219
FATHER, PLEASE GUIDE OUR FRIENDS,

246
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,621
AS THEY EMBARK ON THEIR PATH.

247
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:13,258
PROTECT THEM FROM THE DANGER BELOW,

248
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,696
AND SEE TO IT THAT THEY RETURN SAFE.

249
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,499
THEY ARE IN YOUR HANDS.

250
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,600
AMEN.

251
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,635
All: AMEN.

252
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,819
WELL, WELL, WELL.

253
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,422
SWELLS. SWELLS.

254
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,859
YEAH, YEAH. BREATHTAKING.

255
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,794
WHERE ARE THE SHARKS?

256
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,800
IT'S DISGUSTING.

257
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,836
CHECK OUT THE EYE.

258
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,804
WHAT?

259
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,808
LUNCH TIME! LUNCH IS SERVED.

260
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,444
ALL RIGHT, BOYS, COME AND GET IT!

261
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,880
IT'S TIME!

262
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,818
OH!

263
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,887
OH, POOR BABY. ARE YOU NERVOUS?

264
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,422
NO, NO. NO. NO. SURE?

265
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:22,561
I'M NOT NERVOUS. I DON'T GET NERVOUS.

266
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,606
AND, UH, YOU KNOW, WHAT IF THEY DON'T COME?

267
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,910
DON'T WORRY. THEY'LL COME.

268
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,350
NOW NOTHING CAN HURT YOU.

269
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:50,255
Sonny: NOT QUITE NOTHING.

270
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,967
SHOW TIME! THERE YOU GO.

271
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,907
OH, YES. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE!

272
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,445

00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,286
LET'S GO TO WORK.

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,788
Bog: YOU KNOW, THESE WAVES ARE BREAKING

277
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,922
ALL THE WAY IN TO SHORE.

278
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,724
YOU COULD ACTUALLY JUST SIT ON THE BEACH

279
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:26,959
AND SHOOT IT WITH A TELEPHOTO.

280
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,728
SURE I COULD, AND IT WOULD LOOK LIKE SHIT.

281
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,629
LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU--

282
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,764
JUST TRYING TO TELL ME HOW TO DO MY JOB?

283
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:33,899
SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN THE WATER, BOG?

284
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:37,869
OK, PEOPLE, LET'S ROLL, LET'S GO.

286
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,021
IT'S JUST YOU, YOUR BOARD...

287
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:56,755
AND THAT WAVE.

288
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,490
YOU KEEP YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT.

289
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,659
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE OUT THERE.

290
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,960
ARE YOU STINKING?

291
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,695
LET ME HEAR YOU SAY IT.

292
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,097
I STINK, MAN. COME ON!

293
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,832
I FUCKING STINK BIG TIME!

294
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,567
DAMN RIGHT YOU DO!

295
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,636
LET'S GO, GUYS!

296
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:25,917
Bog: DUDE...

297
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,819
I WOULDN'T BE DOING THAT IF I WERE YOU.

298
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,888
YAH!

299
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,059
OH, MY GOD, I THINK THERE'S ONE BELOW ME!

300
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,460
THAT'S THE IDEA.

301
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,495
NOW!

302
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,095
COME ON.

303
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,031
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

304
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,486
NUTS. THIS IS SIMPLY NUTS.

305
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,890
AND IT'S GONNA BE HUGE.

306
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,060
GO GET 'EM, BOYS!

307
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,935
IDIOTS.

308
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,098
DO IT, BOY! DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!

309
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,833
ALL RIGHT!

310
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,547
THE SHARK IS TOO SLOW!

311
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,919
TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

312
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:11,556
OH, BABY.

313
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,669
GUYS!

314
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,438
HEY, ZACK!

315
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,107
ZACK, HELP!

316
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,243
SHIT.

317
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:35,180
Cecily: HELP! HELP!

318
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,748
WHAT THE HELL?

319
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,184
HELP! ZACK!

320
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:42,788
TAKE ME IN.

321
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,823
THERE'S A SMALL DOCK AROUND THE LEEWAY.

322
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,658
WELL, LET'S GO THERE.

323
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,093
HELP ME!

324
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:53,031
CESS! CESS, GET ON MY BOARD. COME ON, CESS.

325
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,734
COME ON!

326
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,580
COME ON!

327
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,790
I GOT THE BOARD! GRAB HER!

328
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,226
WATCH THE CAMERA!

329
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,799
YOU ALL RIGHT?

330
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,067
I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

331
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,136
YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST PERSON

332
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,805
TO FREAK OUT SURROUNDED BY MAN-EATING SHARKS.

333
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,241
BUT THIS IS MY JOB, MY SHOW.

334
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,976
I NEED THIS DOCUMENTARY.

335
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,912
WITHOUT YOU, I DON'T GOT IT.

336
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:43,949
HOW'S THE TAPE?

337
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,116
IT'S GOOD.

338
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,817
VERY COOL.

339
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:50,055
CESS, WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

340
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,857
FIRST THING YOU LEARN AS A KID,

341
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,559
DON'T EAT BEFORE YOU GO SWIMMING.

342
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,727
YOU GET CRAMPS.

343
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,495
YOU WERE SO GOOD.

344
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,529
THE SHARKS COULDN'T EVEN CATCH UP.

345
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,832
YEAH, WELL, I HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T.

346
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,568
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S TOUCHING.

347
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,469
VERY TOUCHING.

348
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,671
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

349
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,606
LET'S GO!

350
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,108
HUH? WHAT'S THAT?

351
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,711
OF COURSE, WE NEED MORE FOOTAGE.

352
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:16,014
LET'S GO! LET'S GET WET.

353
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,921
OK, THEN.

354
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:32,197
NO, SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

355
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,004
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

356
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,640
YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

357
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,610
OK, THEN, UH...

358
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,779
LET'S CALL IT A DAY, SHALL WE?

359
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,314
Jeremy: YEAH.

360
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,636
WHAT'S HE TRYING TO PROVE?

361
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,637
IT'S STUPID.

362
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,306
THE GUY'S A HEAD CASE.

363
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,708
YOU KNOW, FOR A GUY YOU DON'T LIKE VERY MUCH,

364
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,010
YOU SURE ARE VERY CONCERNED, AREN'T YOU?

365
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,880
NO. IT'S JUST I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S BACK OUT THERE

366
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,949
AFTER WHAT WE SAW.

367
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,119
HE MUST REALLY LOVE TO SURF, HUH?

368
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,022
YEAH, SURE. HE LOVES IT MORE THAN ANYTHING.

369
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,959
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

370
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:36,828
SAY, UH...

371
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,966
YOUR MOM SAID SOMETHING ABOUT 500-YEAR-OLD TEMPLES.

372
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:41,967
MM-HMM.

373
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,636
YOU WANT TO-- YOU WANT TO GO SEARCH THE ISLAND?

374
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:49,240
MY FATHER WOULD KILL ME IF HE KNEW WE'D BE OFF ALONE.

375
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,344
SO I SURE DO HOPE NO ONE TELLS HIM.

376
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,979
OH, MY GOD.

00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,281

00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:30,849

I GOT TO TELL YOU, HON...

IF THE FOOTAGE LOOKS HALF AS GOOD

387
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,045
AS WHAT I SAW FROM THE BOAT,

388
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,913
WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE.

389
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:02,881

WHAT'S WRONG? IS IT ME?

399
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,473
NO, NO. NO, IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S JUST, UM...

WHY DON'T YOU COME IN?

408
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,959
IS THIS AS EXCITING AS SURFING WITH SHARKS?
