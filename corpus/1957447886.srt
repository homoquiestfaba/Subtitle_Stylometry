00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:28,267
I'd sooner it be one of my
field boys than you!

3
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:32,267
Like Willis. Dark, piercing

4
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:36,300
brown eyes, with just a hint of
hazel.

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,300
Dark, bulging, glistening
muscles

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,300
nice firm buttocks

7
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,333
[squeaking]

8
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:52,333
Sit down, boy.

9
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:56,333
My own sweet darling daughter
and Jewel Mayhem's

10
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:00,400
husband?! Makes me sick to my
stomach to think of the two of
you

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,333
co-mingling. You're just a
foul, money-hungry little gigolo

12
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:08,333
aren't you? That is a great
word, isn't it?

13
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,367
Gigolo? I believe that it's
Italian.

14
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:16,367
My dad used to sit on that
verandah

15
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:20,367
buck naked drinking moonshine,
let this whole place fall apart
around him.

16
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:24,367
I worked my fingers to the bone
to bring this place back

17
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:28,367
to the successful plantation
you see before you, and I am
not,

18
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:32,367
not, I say, gonna let some
little adulterer come and steal
it from me!

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Charlotte's all I have. I'm
going to protect her from the

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,400
likes of you.
- Your daughter is not a little
girl anymore, and there's going
to

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,400
be lots of other men.
- and I'm gonna be there with a
shotgun if I have to, and

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,433
shoot every god-dang one of
them! What was your plan boy?

23
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:56,433
She was going to meet me out at
the shed. Her bag is packed.

24
00:01:56,433 --> 00:02:00,500
Then over to the Dramata Inn in
Baton Rouge. They got a real
nice-

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,467
Oh shut your filthy mouth boy!
So in this plan,

26
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:08,467
what were you going to tell your little 
- She was giving me a divorce.

27
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:12,467
Well that's not going to
happen. You see,

28
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,467
Jewel was here last night.
- Last night?

29
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,467
- Last night.
- Right here?
- Right here?

30
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:20,500
Right here?
- Right here in that chair.
- This chair?
- That chair.

31
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
- Last night?
- Last night.
- Right here.

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Now when you came in on the
verandah there was

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,500
a couple of chairs. Not those.

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,533
You go in the foyer, and just
before the music room we've got a whole

35
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:40,533
Yes that chair, you jackass!

36
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:44,533
Sat there crying her little
eyes out.

37
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:48,533
Told her she wouldn't worry
about a thing. Now, you're going to come

38
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:52,533
night with Jewel, your wife.

39
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:56,533
But you're going to meet
Charlotte in the shed. What you're going

40
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:00,567
is this:

41
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:07,233
*

42
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:11,233
Big daddy sure knows how to
throw a party!

43
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:15,233
I just love all the food!

44
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:19,233
*

45
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:23,233
Mayhem.
- I heard that see is

46
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:27,233
having a scandalous affair!
- Have you seen Charlotte?
- Can't you see I am

47
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:31,233
busy?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Hello

48
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:35,233
Drew.
- Hello Drew.
- Hello. Don't you

49
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:39,267
look real pretty tonight.
- I think she went out back with

50
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:43,267
John Mayhem. Yeah, I bet
they're doing something scandalous. Some

51
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:47,267
even speak it out loud.
- Jewel Mayhem

52
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:51,267
Like s-e-x.

53
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:55,267
Why do you always have to have such a po

54
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:59,267
potty-brain?
- I don't, you do.
- I don't, you do.

55
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:03,267
Would you please stop that?
- Would you please stop that? Alright.

56
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:07,300
I go find her.

57
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,300
You're the pretty sister.

58
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,300
So all I have to do is grow
some big boobies and you'll be

59
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,300
on my hip?

60
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,300
*

61
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,300

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,300
* Paint the town, wear
something fancy *

before you know it! Roll off the bed *

65
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,300
* you can sleep when you're dead 
- I'm sorry, Charlotte.

66
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,300
I really am. Please don't cry.

67
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,333
Someone will love you someday.

68
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:59,333
Maybe. And if not,

69
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,333
you can always look forward to
growing old here, by yourself.

70
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:07,333
Turning into some crazy old
loon.

71
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:11,333
Probably just you and Velma,
all alone.

72
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:15,333
Old, old maids.

All wrinkly.

74
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:23,333
I got you that real nice music
box so you can remember me.

outrageous, *

and scowl or go out *

yourself howl *

81

back to take your music box. Now get!

some of your, your buttermilk pancakes

of those beignets you make.

why would you be coming all the
way from London England to investigate a

00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:38,800
like this? The only journalists
coming around these parts is so they can

162
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,800
like this.
- It's like this, Sheriff. I've never be

that I haven't solved.
- Sheriff, you've gotta come out to the

observe, I'll be quiet as a churchmouse.

I don't see any harm in that as
long as you just stay in the car and obs

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,833
Mr. Wills.
- I'm writing a cookbook about the seven

delicacies in these here parts.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

170

Is there a Mrs. Stan that I
might get some recipes from?

No, I'm not married.
- Not married? A big handsome, strapping

- No, I guess just

00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,833
never met the right girl.
- What kind of girl?

174
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:32,533
Sheriff, I'd like to get with
that Jewel Mayhem, I'm sure she's got a

175
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,567
You know Miss Jewel?
- Yes, I've done a thorough investigatio

176
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:40,567
in these here parts.
- Mr. Wills, your accent is very

177
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:44,600
interesting. What part of
England are you from?

178
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Oh, the southern part.

179
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,600
*

180
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:04,633
Velma!

181
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:08,667
He's here!
- Hey, Miss Velma.

182
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,667
How are you doing this fine morning?
- Well, I'd be just fine if

183
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:16,700
some people would stop meddling
in other people's business.

184
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,700
She don't want to see you anyhow.
- Well that's too bad, I guess I'm just

185
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,700
to come on in and wait until
she feels like seeing me so we can discu

186
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,733
of shooting at Stan. How are
you doing this fine morning?

187
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:32,733
May I say you're looking mighty pretty.
- Get out Sheriff Luke!

188
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:37,467
Did you say pretty? Am I
looking pretty today?

189
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:41,500
I would be just fine is
everybody weren't trying to throw me off

190
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,500
and making such a mess and a
big racket out there

191
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,533
and practically digging up Big Daddy's g
- Charlotte, you know

192
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:53,533
you've had plenty of time to
pack up and leave before this all starte

193
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:57,533
This house is coming down and there ain'

194
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:01,567
This is so unfair. Nobody asked
me to sign anything and

195
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:05,567
suddenly it's become some sort
of public decree.

196
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:09,567
I've told you this time and
time again Miss Charlotte, papers were s

197
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:13,600
That is not true, and if anyone
did it was that Jewel Mayhem,

198
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,633
She's always trying something out to get

199
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:21,633
about poor Miss Jewel? She's
old and frail and practically senile, co

200
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:25,633
of anything these days, she's quite ill.

201
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:29,667
When my cousin MIldred comes,
she'll

202
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:33,667
fix everything.
- Cousin Mildred?

203
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:37,667
The pretty one?
- Yeah, the pretty one.

204
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:41,700
She's going to march right down
to that courthouse and tell them where t

205
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,700
shove that decree. Now, get out!

206
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,267
Now why did you tell him she
was coming?

207
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:54,267
You haven't heard hide nor tail
from here since you sent her away

208
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:58,267
I know she's coming. I can feel
it

209
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:02,300
in my bones.
[Doorbell]

210
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,300
Telegram for Miss Charlotte!

211
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,300
Dear Charlotte, stop.

212
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,300
On my way to help immediately,
stop. We'll take this

213
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,300
to the highest court in the
land, stop. Love, Mildred stop.

214
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,333
You see? I told you she was
coming to

215
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:26,333
fix everything.

216
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:30,333
Such beautiful weather we're
having isn't it?

217
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:34,333
It's gorgeous. It's quite
picturesque really.

218
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:38,367
It reminds me a bit of a
wedding I went to.

219
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,367
The bride wore red

220
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:46,367
Oh, oh my, what an odd
coincidence.

221
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:50,367
Look, it's my sister standing
by the side of the road. Driver,

222
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:54,367
please pull over.

223
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:58,400
*

224
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Hello.
- Hello, dear.
- What are you doing here?

225
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Well when I heard you were
coming out here to help poor Cousin Char

226
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,433
two heads would be better than one.
- Oh, marvelous.
- Would you mind helping

227
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:14,433
me put my bag in the trunk,
it's awfully heavy. Oh, not you, sir. Sh

228
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:18,433
the exercise.
- Drive on.

229
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:22,433
But what happened to the other lady?
- She forgot some- she decided not to co

230
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:26,467
One of those excuses will do. Drive on.
- But-

231
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:30,467
I said, drive on.
- Okay, lady.

232
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:38,467
[bell rings]

233
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:42,467
Well, come on in

234
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:46,500
then.
Drew. What are you doing here?

235
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,500
I swear, all the comers and
goers that are

236
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,500
happening today.
- Well I stopped by to see if you need a

237
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,533
new something to calm your nerves?
- That's very kind of you Drew, but

238
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:02,533
my cousin Mildred is coming and
she's going to take care of

239
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:06,533
everything. I won't have to
leave the house. We can give

240
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:10,533
parties here again. Wouldn't
that be fun!

241
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:14,567
Well, here we are.

242
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:18,567
Isn't this an amazing piece of history?
- History?

243
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:22,567
Yes. I just hate this place, it gives me
- Too bad it's

244
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:26,600
going to be torn down next week.
- Oh what a pity. What a pity I'm going

245
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,600
hillbilly for every cent she's got.
- Did you say something?
- I said I need to pee.

246
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,600
So hurry it up.

247
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,600
*

248
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

249
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,600
I will too.
- Well, I guess

250
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,633
I gotta go out and get her bags.

251
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:54,633
Velma.

252
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:58,633
Velma Smothers.

253
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:02,667
You look so... well.

254
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:06,667
You are not Mildred.
- Velma, why would you say such

255
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:10,667
a thing. Of course,
- Well, your boobs are so much bigger.

256
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:14,700
I mean, Mildred's boobs were big, but yo
- Now, Velma, we haven't seen each other

257
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,700
in many years. The years have
changed us. Some for good and some for-

258
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,700
well.

259
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,733
Milli-
-Dred! Drew, what a surprise.

260
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:30,733
Why yes. Mildred.

261
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:34,733
I just can't believe it, you
look

262
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:38,767
fantastic. It's been so long.

263
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:42,767
In a recent letter I sent you a
photo, what did you expect?

264
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:46,767
They look so much better in
person.

265
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:50,767
Did you have any trouble with you know w
- Oh, it's so wonderful to be back here.

266
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,800
It-way as-way easy-way.

267
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,833
Ock-tray.

268
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,833
Ock-tray!
- Yes, I will take care of that one myse

269
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,833
Who does your hair? I need to
find out because I want to have it done

270
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,833
Well I just do it myself.

271
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,867
I wash it in lye soap that I
make from bacon

272
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:18,867
fat. That's the secret.
- So that's why you smell like

273
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:22,867
pork. Well I guess it's time,
I'd best go up and

274
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:26,900
see dear cousin.
- That's the last of it, I thank you ver

275
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,900
and I'll be on my way, ma'am.
- I sure hope that that fine

276
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,900
lady -
- Oh wonderful, wonderful, well don't di

277
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,933
to pick up.
- Thank you for your generosity.

278
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:42,933
No, no, there are no buts here
at the plantation, just hurry along. I s

279
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:46,933
along! As in have a wonderful
day. Life.

280
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:50,933
[chuckling]

281
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:54,967
Well don't think I'm bringing
in all them bags.

282
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:58,967
Specially not that big one!
- Well don't you worry your little hands

283
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:02,967
my dear Velma. Drew will bring
them into the house and to the

284
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:06,967
large walk in closet at the end
of the hallway by the

285
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:11,067
second bathroom.

286
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:15,067
I should be able to auction all
these old pieces for a very

287
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:19,067
good price.
- I don't see how you're gonna convince

288
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:23,067
You just leave that to me Drew.
I'm the mastermind in this.

289
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:27,067
You're the Rhoda. I'm the Mary.
I'll take care

290
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:31,067
of her.
- You'll take care of her?

291
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:35,067
Now what did you mean by that
remark?

292
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:39,067
It's just that poor Charlotte
has lived here for so long, and I will h

293
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:43,067
care of her with the move and
all.

294
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:48,333
Them bags are not going to move
themselves.

295
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:52,333
Yes, of course.
- I've got the guest room all ready for

296
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:56,333
Second door on the right.

297
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:00,433
Thank you Velma. And once
again, what a pleasure to

298
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:04,367
see you. You look ravishing.

299
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:08,367
Well, I guess you're

300
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:12,367
gonna be wanting to stay for
supper, especially now

301
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:16,367
that Miss Mildred is here. I'm
not

302
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:20,367
doing anything fancy, so don't
'spect much. I don't serve

303
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:24,367
nothing, I am out of here
before dark. This place

304
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:28,367
gives me the willies after
dark.

305
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:32,400
Just fine, Velma, just fine.

306
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,400
I am so hungry for your
homestyle cooking, but

307
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,400
I just have to get the bag, put
it in the back of the closet like

308
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Mil-dred suggested.

309
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
*

310
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Something sure smells

311
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,467
fishy.

312
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:04,400
Charlotte. It's me.

313
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,433
Melanie?
- No dear, it's Mildred.

314
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:16,433
I got your letter asking me to
come.

315
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:20,433
But you've gotten so much
bigger.

316
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:24,433
Well, it's been a very long
time. A lot can happen to a girl when sh

317
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:28,467
off to New York City, gets
caught up in a wild and carefree lifesty

318
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:32,467
and smoking and drinking until all hours

319
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:36,467
I met the right surgeon.
- You have come to help me?

320
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:40,467
Yes.
- What is it?

321
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:44,467
Oh, the baby Jane doll.
Remember how we would play with her

322
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:48,467
for hours? How much you loved
her?

323
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:52,467
I never could understand why
your sister was so afraid of her, I mean

324
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:56,467
afraid of such an angelic face.
- Come here little girl!

325
00:25:56,467 --> 00:26:00,533
[laughing]

326
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:04,467
Not me.
- Do you

327
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:08,500
do you remember Preston? The
boy I dated who

328
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,500
went off to war and came back
with a Yankee wife?

329
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,500
I thought his name was Ashley.
- No. Preston.

330
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Do you remember the time you
went to the big ball and wore that red d

331
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Oh, and everyone was appalled
and made fun of you, saying, 'lady of th

332
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Hussy, whore.

333
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,500
And Big Daddy was so upset.
That's when I met John Mayhem and

334
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,500
and, oh Mildred.

335
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,500
You have come to help me?
- Yes Charlotte. I'm come to help with

336
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,500
everything. Just everything.
You won't have to worry about

337
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,533
a thing. Not a single thing,
I'll take care of everything.

338
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:52,533
Really, I will. You won't even
know

339
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:56,533
what hit you.

340
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:08,600
*

341
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,600
This was Big Daddy's favorite
room

342
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,633
in the entire house. He'd just

343
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:20,600
sit in here and eat and drink
and eat and drink

344
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,600
and eat and drink and eat and
drink and

345
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,633
eat and drink. And then he'd
have a big old cigar.

346
00:27:28,633 --> 00:27:32,633
He'd be in here for days and
days sometimes.

347
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:36,633
Carrying on, entertaining
different business associates.

348
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:40,633
Sometimes he'd call me and have
me lift up my dress

349
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:44,667
and show my belly button and
we'd giggle.

350
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:48,667
Mildred, you can go into town
first thing tomorrow morning and walk st

351
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,667
them what's what.
- Now Charlotte, you're going to have to

352
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:56,667
I don't think Mildred or you can do anyt
- Charlotte, Drew

353
00:27:56,667 --> 00:28:00,733
is right. You have to leave the
house.

354
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:04,667
But that's just, that's just crazy talk!
- Tomorrow

355
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:08,667
at breakfast, we sit down and
discuss all this and come up with a plan

356
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:12,667
A plan? We don't need to make
any plans.

357
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,700
What do you think I asked you
here for?

358
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,667
Company? Do you think I'd ask

359
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:28,667
you back here just to - just to
make a plan?

360
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:32,700
You owe me, missy.

361
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,700
Remember when Big Daddy took
you and your sister downtown? Bought you

362
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,700
whole new wardrobes?
- Yes, I remember.

363
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,700
Down to a sleazy Baton Rouge-
- It wasn't good enough for you?

364
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,700
Big daddy didn't give you
enough? Well maybe that's what you came

365
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,733
swindle me out of all of this -
- Charlotte, what's gotten into you? You

366
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:56,733
come here to come and help.

367
00:28:56,733 --> 00:29:00,800
And you continue like this?
What is dragging up the past

368
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,733
going to do for you?
- It's all right Drew. Charlotte's not h

369
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:08,733
She's been carrying such a
large burden for many years and now with

370
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:12,733
new threat of the demolition of
this beautiful old house

371
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:16,767
we all just need to stay calm
and come up with

372
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:20,767
a plan.
We all know exactly she came back here t

373
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:24,767
house. It was you who went
sneaking off

374
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:28,767
to Jewel and told her about her
husband and me in the

375
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,767
first place!
- You seem to be forgetting

376
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:36,767
that was my sister, Melanie.
- Oh that's right.

377
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:40,767
I'm sorry. You're the nice one.
The pretty one.

378
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:44,767
But you still didn't know about
that, did you Drew? Or did you?

379
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:48,767
I know the two of you were
having a sordid little affair,

380
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:52,767
but Drew dumped you because you
weren't in line to get any of Big Daddy'

381
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:56,800
money. You know something Melanie?
- Mildred.

382
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,800
You're just a vile, conniving,
sour little

383
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,800
bitch!

384
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Would you like me to get that
cousin dear?

385
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,800
I'll get it. It's still my
house.

386
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,800
*

387
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,833
Did you take care of Mildred?

388
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:28,800
Oh yes. I took care of her.

389
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:44,333
*

390
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:48,333
Yes?
- Miss Charlotte?
- Yes?

391
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:52,333
Miss Charlotte Holler? The Miss Charlott
- Yes.

392
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:56,367
I'm a reporter with the
international newspaper, The Daily Nosey

393
00:30:56,367 --> 00:31:00,433
you if I asked you a few
questions? Did you kill

394
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:04,367
your lover?
- Please get off my property!

395
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:08,367
*

396
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:12,400
What are you two doing?

397
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Conniving behind my back?
- Oh, Charlotte.
- Charlotte

398
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,400
don't be silly. I think you've
been locked up here with

399
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,433
only Velma and myself as your
only connection to the world.

400
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:28,433
Too long. I mean, it has
altered your perception

401
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:32,433
of reality. Not everyone is out
to get you.

402
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:36,433
Yes, Charlotte. I am here for
one reason. I only want

403
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:40,467
what's best for me. For you.

404
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:44,467
Like the time I told Big Daddy
that his darling little girl

405
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:48,500
was having a dirty little
affair with someone who could only end

406
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,500
up badly. I- we- only

407
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,500
wanted what was best for you
then, too. How could we have known

408
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,600
it would end up in a
horrifically, bloody, disgusting

409
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,533
murder that would haunt you and this hou

410
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:08,533
How could we have known that?
- Absolutely, how would we know that.

411
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:16,567
But... but you said it was

412
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:20,567
Melanie who did it, not you.
- Well, I meant my sister

413
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:24,600
She actually confided in me,
although I must

414
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,600
admit, I strongly agreed with
her actions. In fact, I suggested it.

415
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,633
We all knew he was in it for no
good reasons.

416
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:36,633
We didn't want you to get hurt.

417
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:40,667
Well,

418
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,667
no you couldn't have known that.

419
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:48,667
John.

420
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:52,700
John?

421
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,700
*

422
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,800
John? John?

423
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,733
Everytime I come out here to
visit, she's a little worse.

424
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:08,767
She seems to lose her grip on
reality more and more

425
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:12,767
She goes up there in that room,
puts on that dress, the same dress

426
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:16,767
she wore that night, and she
waits for him.

427
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:20,800
Or she goes to the music room
and plays that song.

428
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,800
The music box that John gave
her over and over,

429
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,800
again and again.
- We have no choice but to follow the pl

430
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,833
Come on, Drew. Don't get
sentimental

431
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:36,833
on me now. Just think about the
money.

432
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:40,867
John. John.
- See? She is insane.

433
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:44,867
We're actually doing a good
deed. She needs to be taken care of by s

434
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:48,867
Other than that pork-smelling
hick! How much more would it

435
00:33:48,867 --> 00:33:52,900
take? You know, so that there
isn't any doubt?

436
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,900
I don't think it would take
much.

437
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,967
Push her over the edge
completely.

438
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:04,933
Really? You really think so?
- Charlotte was wrong.

439
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:08,933
I mean, I never left you
because of what

440
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:12,967
well, my mother didn't - 
- Drew! You know I don't

441
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,967
hold on to things. Let bygones
be bygones and

442
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:20,967
never bring it up again. Don't
even think about it. Not even a little b

443
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:24,967
See, I've completely forgotten
about it, I've moved on with my life, ok

444
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:29,067
Do you want me to stay here in
this house with you?

445
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,067
It's a big old scary house.

446
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:37,067
I'll be fine. I'm not a little
girl anymore.

447
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:41,067
No, you're not.

448
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:45,067
Well, Drew, are you forgetting
something?

449
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:49,067
You said you were

450
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:53,067
going to bring me something for
my protection.

451
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:57,067
The gun, you im-patient

452
00:34:57,067 --> 00:35:01,067
fool.

453
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:09,067
So I guess you can see yourself
out, Drew. Good night.

454
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:17,067
I said, good night.

455
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:21,067
Good night, Meli.

456
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:25,067
See you later.

457
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:36,067
John.

458
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:48,467
*

459
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:52,467
John. [crying]

460
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,467
[creaking]

461
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,500
My dress!

462
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,367
Somebody slashed my dress!

463
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:21,367
[child laughing]

464
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:29,400
Why do you think that she was

465
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,400
sent off the London if she
wasn't guilty? It's the best way to take

466
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,400
To stay here and deny the
allegations,

467
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,433
proud of it?
- That's the thing Mr. Wills. From what

468
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:45,433
poor old Miss Charlotte
couldn't remember anything that happened

469
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:49,433
her daddy sent her over there
to prevent her from bein charged with

470
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:53,433
murder.
- But how, she was the leading suspect.
- Big daddy

471
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:57,433
was in bed with the mayor, the
governor, anyone of any power

472
00:36:57,433 --> 00:37:01,433
here in this here parts. He
could do anything he wanted.

473
00:37:01,433 --> 00:37:05,467
Do you think she could've done
it?

474
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:09,467
No, I don't. Do you?
- I agree.

475
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:13,467
Sugar?
- Please. Five.

476
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:17,500
One,

477
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,467
two, three, four,

478
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:25,467
five.

479
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:45,533
All right? It's delightful, I'm
not typically a coffee drinker, I'm more

480
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:49,533
a tea drinker being from London
and all.

481
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:53,533
So, I hope you don't mind my
asking Sheriff, how did you become

482
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:57,533
the local law and a newspaper
man.

483
00:37:57,533 --> 00:38:01,567
I guess it's just in my blood.
My mama

484
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:05,567
loved reading the newspaper,
and my daddy, he loved listening

485
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:09,567
to little orphan Annie on the
radio.

486
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:13,567
So I guess that's as good as
reason as any.

487
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:17,567
I was the understand that her
cousin Mildred is coming to help?

488
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:21,600
That's what I've been told, but
I don't know.

489
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Now we just have to do one more
thing and then we can be done with all o

490
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,600
It was such a nice visit, but
what

491
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,633
did we just do?
- Miss Jewel, we have to go file those p

492
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:37,633
plantation in my name. You promised, rem

493
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:41,633
Now we just have to do one more
thing and we can be done with all this.

494
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:45,633
Excuse me Sheriff, but I'm a
bit confused.

495
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:49,667
If that's Mildred, she's all
grown up now.

496
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:53,667
The other lady out there in the
black dress, that's Jewel Mayhem.

497
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:57,667
Interesting. As you may already
know, Mildred has a sister Melanie,

498
00:38:57,667 --> 00:39:01,700
they were identical twins,
except for a few

499
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,700
things.
- What things?

500
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,700
What I want to do is

501
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,700
go back home, have some tea,
and your special

502
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,700
scones.
- Miss Melanie?

503
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,733
But you're quite mistaken, I'm Mildred.
- Miss MIldred,

504
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:25,733
my deepest apologies.
- It's always so difficult to

505
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:29,733
tell you two apart, except for-

506
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:33,767
[laughing]

507
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:37,767
Jewel. Jewel Mayhem.

508
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:41,800
How good it is to see you after
all these years.

509
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Can't you even give me the time
of day?

510
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,800
I haven't the time in my last
dying days

511
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,833
to give anyone the time of day.
Especially the likes of you.

512
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:57,833
Well you must be confusing me
with my sister Melanie.

513
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:01,867
Jewel, she had told me that you
two had had some sort of spat.

514
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:05,867
You are not Mildred. I love
Mildred.

515
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:09,867
I can tell by every fiber in my
body that you are that

516
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:14,600
thieving, disgusting vile pig
Melanie!

517
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Please not here. Not on the
public street.

518
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,600
I'll do whatever I wish! Now
get out of my way

519
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,633
you stinky harlot bitch! Murder

520
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:30,633
starts in the heart. Its first

521
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:34,633
weapon is a vicious, vile,
disgusting, really gross,

522
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:38,633
not nice, unalluring,

523
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:42,667
loose tongue.
- Now, Miss Mayhem,

524
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:46,667
let's go and get you back home
where we can get you that tea

525
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:50,667
and a nice scone.
- I am not unalluring.

526
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:54,700
I aways did say she was unalluring.
- Oh, you never say that.

527
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,700
I may not have said it, but I thought it
- Will you two hush up?

528
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,700
Let's go over there and say
hello and find out what she's up to.

529
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,700
That must've hit the nail right
on the head.

530
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,700
Do stop this, Charlotte!
- And you forgot this!

531
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,733
And that!
- Now, who do you think you

532
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:18,733
is going to clean this mess all
up? Just because you saw

533
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:22,733
a bit of literature about you
and that John Mayhem.

534
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:26,767
Now I thought this was all kind
of funny, but you've just

535
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:30,767
lost all your sense of humor, I swear!pp

536
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:34,767
I thought this was a real nice
picture of Miss Charlotte.

537
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:38,767
Yes, I see what you mean. Where did you 
- I bought it.

538
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:42,800
Down at the Piggly Wiggly. I
thought it was a real nice

539
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,767
likeness of Miss Charlotte,
just like I said, and I thought it was g

540
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:50,800
brighten up her day, what with
all the goings on and all.

541
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,767
Well you obviously were very
mistaken, even though I hate to admit it

542
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:58,800
it's a lovely picture of her.

543
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Oh, by the way Velma, I've
hired your old friends

544
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Bertie, Agnes, and Trudy to
pack up Charlotte's belongings

545
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,800
They'll be here any moment, so
please, have them start in the dining ro

546
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,800
With the silver. Someone will
be by tomorrow

547
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,833
to pick up the boxes and put
them into safekeeping.

548
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:22,833
Safekeeping, huh?

549
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:26,833
I bet it's for safekeeping.
- Worst picture of me on the cover!

550
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:30,867
Charlotte, you know that Velma
has always been someone with special

551
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:34,867
needs. I'm sure she was just
trying to be amusing.

552
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:38,867
But look at it. It- it looks
terrible. I don't look like that. They m

553
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:42,900
done something to the picture.
I bet Jewel Mayhem is behind all this.

554
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,900
She hates me. All she wants to
do is try to make my life miserable.

555
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,900
Don't be ridiculous. You're
beginning to sound a bit mad. Batty.

556
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,900
Irrational, wacky, crazy,
delusional, delirious, psychotic, banana

557
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,900
and a bit mental.

558
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,933
Now, Charlotte, I just saw
Jewel Mayhem at City Hall

559
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:06,933
downtown. Crazy as a loon and
practically at death's door.

560
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:10,933
She called me unalluring. Crazy.

561
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:14,967
Me. Unalluring.
- I'm glad Jewel

562
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,967
Mayhem is ill. She deserves to
be ill. She

563
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:22,967
deserves to die! I've got
evidence. Lots of it.

564
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,967
Now do you think I'm crazy? I
know

565
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:30,967
Jewel Mayhem is behind this, I
have all of these hidden all over the ho

566
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:35,067
Bertie, Agnes, and Trudy are
downstairs.

567
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:39,067
I told them to start on silver,
like you said.

568
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:43,067
Thank you Velma.
- What are Bertie, Agnes and Trudy doing

569
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:47,067
And what about the siler?
- Oh Charlotte,

570
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:51,067
I'm so worried about you in
this terrible stress.

571
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:55,067
Now later, we will sit down and
discuss everything and talk

572
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:59,067
about the plan. Oh, and by the
way dear,

573
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:03,067
I picked up something today for
your nerves.

574
00:44:03,067 --> 00:44:07,067
But what happened today at City Hall?
- We'll talk about that later Charlotte,

575
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:11,067
now, drink up, okay?

576
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:15,067
Just one.

577
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:19,100
Now that's a good girl. Well,
I'm going to go downstairs

578
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,067
and make sure they're doing
everything correctly.

579
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:27,067
*

580
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,100
Velma!

581
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,100
What are those women doing in
my house?

582
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,133
Damn you! Damn you all!

583
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:47,133
And don't come back!

584
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:51,133
Please, do sit down. I'm sure
you're quite pleased

585
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:55,167
that I gave you permission for an audien
- Oh yes, I'm very

586
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:59,167
happy. Just to be clear, I've
been wanting to sit down with

587
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:03,200
you for many, many, many years.
- Really?

588
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Well I'm not quite sure why.
Montgomery,

589
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,233
do we have any of those nice
blueberry scones left?

590
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:15,233
Yes, Miss Mayhem. We've got two
left. Why not go get them?

591
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:19,233
Oh Montgomery.
- Yes, Miss Mayhem?

592
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:23,233
Look what I made you.

593
00:45:23,233 --> 00:45:27,233
Yes. Very nice.

594
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:31,267
Very nice.

595
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:35,267
Some goober peas, Mr. Wills?

596
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:39,300
Now, where were we? Yes.

597
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,300
I need something from you.
- Oh! Well now I'm intrigued.

598
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,333
How can I help?
- This town is incredibly miniscule.

599
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:51,333
I'm sure by now everybody's
talking about

600
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:55,367
my repartee with Melanie today.
- Melanie? I thought it was Mildred.

601
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:59,400
Yes. So she claims. Melanie,
Mildred,

602
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,400
I don't care who she says she
is.

603
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,433
You see Mr. Wills, I know that
I do not have much time left in this

604
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:11,433
world. I'm sick. Fragile.

605
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:15,467
Some say I'm losing my grip on
reality.

606
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:19,467
Oh, you're fine.

607
00:46:19,467 --> 00:46:23,500
I'm not wearing any panties!

608
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,500
I was going to be a dancer.

609
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,533
I'm slender, beautiful. But John

610
00:46:31,533 --> 00:46:35,567
Mayhem proposed, and I said yes.

611
00:46:35,567 --> 00:46:39,567
Oh, I'd loved him ever since we
were little together

612
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:43,600
and we played doctor.

613
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,633
With popsicle sticks.
- With popsicle sticks.
- Sticky ones.

614
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:51,633
He said he would see to it that
John

615
00:46:51,633 --> 00:46:55,633
never ever got any of our
family money. So John

616
00:46:55,633 --> 00:46:59,667
wanted Charlotte for just one
thing. He told me

617
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:03,667
when he'd swindled Charlotte
out of all her money, he'd come back to

618
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:07,700
I want you

619
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,733
to keep something for me. To
give to the Sheriff

620
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:15,733
after I've passed. You see,

621
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:19,767
everyone's out to get me.
- Out to get you?

622
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:23,767
This town is filled with dark,
dirty little secrets.

623
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:27,767
Dirty little secrets.
- Repeat after me! I promise.
- I promise

624
00:47:27,767 --> 00:47:31,767
Never to open the envelope that
Jewel Mayhem gave me

625
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:35,767
Never to open the envelope that Jewel Ma
- Even if I'm stripped naked

626
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:39,767
and if my testicles are beaten
with tiny little bats!

627
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:43,767
Where did they find these tiny little ba
- Just say it.

628
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:47,800
All right, even if they strip
me naked and beat my testicles with tiny

629
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,800
Until I'm dead and gone.
- Until you're dead and gone!

630
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,800
Well, now. Wasn't that good fun?

631
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,767
Now, how about some of my

632
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:03,800
nice buggrass tea?

633
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,833
*

634
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:23,833
Charlotte?

635
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:43,833
*

636
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:47,833
Charlotte.

637
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:51,833
Charlotte, come to bed.

638
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:55,833
Don't turn on the light.

639
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:59,833
It's not real when it's light.
It's only

640
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:03,867
real when it's dark.

641
00:49:03,867 --> 00:49:07,867
Now come to bed.

642
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:17,467
*

643
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:21,500
[screaming]

644
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,500
He's dead! He's dead! He's dead!

645
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:32,200
He's dead, he's dead!

646
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,200
Well I think she's plum crazy.
- Well, maybe she is,

647
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,200
maybe she ain't.
- That's what I always say.

648
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,233
Well, which isn't?
- I don't know.

649
00:49:48,233 --> 00:49:52,233
Well I do know. We should do
this real slow, because

650
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:56,233
we get paid by the hour.

651
00:49:56,233 --> 00:50:16,267
*

652
00:50:16,267 --> 00:50:20,267
Charlotte!

653
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:26,167
Jesus Christ

654
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Miss Charlotte?

655
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,200
Miss Charlotte, please, can I
talk with you? I've come such a long way

656
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,233
meet with you.
- Where are you from?
- I'm from England.

657
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:50,233
Oh really? How nice for you.
- Yes, I was there to greet you

658
00:50:50,233 --> 00:50:54,233
when you came to London so many years ag

659
00:50:54,233 --> 00:50:58,233
journalists who stood in line to have a

660
00:50:58,233 --> 00:51:02,233
interviews. Big daddy forbid it.
- I know.

661
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:06,233
Let me introduce myself. I'm
Mr. Wills.

662
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:10,267
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
startle you, but I just wanted

663
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:14,267
to be with you for such a long time.
- You really were there?

664
00:51:14,267 --> 00:51:18,267
Oh yes indeed.
- Then what was I wearing.
- Let me think.

665
00:51:18,267 --> 00:51:22,267
Hot pink dress and a big green hat?
- No.
- A snakeskin coat

666
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:26,300
with matching t-straps?
- No.
- A little black dress, a monkey

667
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,300
fur collar?
- No. It was a pale blue

668
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,300
dress with matching bag and shoes.
- Oh yes, of course.

669
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,300
How could I forget? And you
were just lovely.

670
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,300
Then you really were there.
- Of course.

671
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:50,333
Well, well what can I

672
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:54,333
do for you now?

673
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:58,367
I've something to confess. I'm
your number one fan.

674
00:51:58,367 --> 00:52:02,367
You're my favorite living
mystery.

675
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:06,367
Have you

676
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:10,367
ever ever solved me?
- No.

677
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:14,367
Then you wouldn't be a mystery
anymore, now would you?

678
00:52:14,367 --> 00:52:18,400
No I wouldn't.
- Then what would I do myself?

679
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

680
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,400
I think I've offended you with all this

681
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,400
I never talk to people about
you-know-what.

682
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,400
I know. I'm so glad you allowed
me to talk with you

683
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,400
about you-know-what.
- Mr. Wills, do you

684
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,433
think I'm a certifiable
demented lunatic unbalanced

685
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:46,433
killer?
- Well,

686
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:50,433
Miss Charlotte, that is the big
question. Now, I've entertained many the

687
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:54,433
that you've taken his
taxidermic head and kept it under the be

688
00:52:54,433 --> 00:52:58,433
or you exhumed Big Daddy's body
and put Mr. Mayhem in his place

689
00:52:58,433 --> 00:53:02,433
or you've kept him under the
floorboards and brought him out to celeb

690
00:53:02,433 --> 00:53:06,433
and re-enacted that night over
and over again, but

691
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:10,467
alas,

692
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:14,467
you're the only one that knows
the real truth.

693
00:53:14,467 --> 00:53:18,467
I didn't do it. I know I didn't
do it.

694
00:53:18,467 --> 00:53:22,467
But just lately,

695
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:26,500
at night, things have gotten so
crazy

696
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,500
in my head, it's made me
question everything and everybody.

697
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,500
I really don't know

698
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,500
anymore.

699
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,500
Would you like

700
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,533
a tour of the inside of the
house?

701
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:50,533
That's Big Daddy. You see, he'd
sit in here and

702
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:54,567
eat and drink and eat and
drink, and eat and drink

703
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:58,567
eat and drink, and then he'd
have a big old cigar.

704
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:02,567
He'd be in here for days and
days sometimes.

705
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:06,567
Entertaining different business
associates. He'd call me in

706
00:54:06,567 --> 00:54:10,600
sometimes and have me lift up
my dress and show my bellybutton,

707
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,600
and we'd giggle.

708
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,600
So, why do you call him Big
Daddy? He's not that big.

709
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,600
That's not why we called him
Big Daddy.

710
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,633
So you're, you're

711
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:30,633
Miss Mell-
-dred. Yes I am. And what are you doing

712
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:34,633
when she's in such a delicate state.
- I'm Mr. Wills and she was kind enough

713
00:54:34,633 --> 00:54:38,633
A tour. Isn't that special?

714
00:54:38,633 --> 00:54:42,633
I was just showing him the
portrait of Big Daddy, it's so impressiv

715
00:54:42,633 --> 00:54:46,667
Isn't it impressive? He's such
a big man.

716
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:50,667
He was a fine figure of a man.
There seems to be-

717
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:54,667
Take you hands off that! You
give that to me!

718
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:58,667
Oh Charlotte! Charlotte! Calm
down, it's just an old

719
00:54:58,667 --> 00:55:02,700
stinky out-of-tune music box.
- An old stinky out of tune music box,

720
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,700
it's all I have left of John.

721
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,733
How dare you call it an old
stinky out of tune music box!

722
00:55:10,733 --> 00:55:14,733
Get out! Get out! Get out all
of you! Get out!

723
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:18,733
Damn you! Damn you all!

724
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:22,767
Charlotte? Melanie? Anybody?

725
00:55:30,767 --> 00:55:34,767
*

726
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:38,767
Go! You gotta go!

727
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:42,767
Get out!

728
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:46,800
Charlotte.
- Get out!

729
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,800
Get the hell out!

730
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,833
How did this happen?

731
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:58,833
Big daddy. He was mad about
something

732
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:06,833
Get out!
- Charlotte!

733
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,867
Oh my god! Charlotte.

734
00:56:14,867 --> 00:56:18,867
How did this happen?
- It was Big Daddy.

735
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:22,867
He was mad about something,

736
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:26,900
he was so angry. Real angry,
and he was here.

737
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,900
He was right here.
- Charlotte, you know that's

738
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,900
impossible. Big daddy's been
dead for many years.

739
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,933
But he was here. Right here. He
was so angry.

740
00:56:38,933 --> 00:56:42,933
Real angry, he was here. Right
here.

741
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:46,933
Yes, I got that he was here.
Right here.

742
00:56:46,933 --> 00:56:50,933
Go upstairs and go to bed and
I'll get some bandages and call Drew.

743
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:54,933
Charlotte. Stop dripping over
everything.

744
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:58,967
Real angry. And he's here.

745
00:56:58,967 --> 00:57:02,967
He was right here.
- Go upstairs!

746
00:57:02,967 --> 00:57:06,967
Please?

747
00:57:06,967 --> 00:57:10,967
Okay.
- Oh, dammit.

748
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:23,067
Melanie?

749
00:57:23,067 --> 00:57:27,067
Mildred.
- Mildred.

750
00:57:27,067 --> 00:57:31,067
Drew, what are you doing in my
room?

751
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:35,067
What is my suitcase

752
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:39,067
doing up here?
- Charlotte, we're taking you away from

753
00:57:39,067 --> 00:57:43,067
today. Especially after last night.
- Last night?

754
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:51,100
Charlotte, you just stay put.

755
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,133
I'm gonna give you something to
help calm your nerves.

756
00:57:55,133 --> 00:57:59,133
While Mildred packs up a nice
little bag for you.

757
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:03,167
Ow.

758
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:07,167
Charlotte. Drew and I have
talked it over, we believe this house is

759
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:11,167
making you do things you can't
control.

760
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:15,200
No I'm not, I won't go.

761
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,200
Jewel will be sitting down
there, waiting for me and laughing at me

762
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,200
I can't give her that
satisfaction.

763
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,233
You see? She thinks Jewel Mayhem

764
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:31,267
is sitting outside, waiting for
her to go insane.

765
00:58:31,267 --> 00:58:35,267
Is there anything else I can
get you Miss Mayhem?

766
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:43,300
How much more of this do we have to endu
- Now Melanie, she may be there now

767
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:47,300
But I think we should stay the
course and make sure that, when she's qu

768
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,333
she doesn't make any sense at
all.

769
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:55,367
But she just thought that Big
Daddy broke the mirror. I'd say that's p

770
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:59,367
Give me the police. Yes, Luke?

771
00:58:59,367 --> 00:59:03,367
This is Velma from down at
Holler Plantation. I need to come

772
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:07,400
down to the hotel and talk to
you and Mr. Wills right away. Yes.

773
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Oh good, good. All right, well,

774
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,433
I will be coming right away and
I need to get me

775
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:19,433
a nice ham hock so I can make a
good stew for supper.

776
00:59:19,433 --> 00:59:23,467
Yep, yep, that will be real
good, why thank you butcher

777
00:59:23,467 --> 00:59:27,467
John. Yes I'll see you real
soon.

778
00:59:27,467 --> 00:59:31,467
That was the butcher. I just
wanted to make sure I could get a nice

779
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:35,500
ham hock for stew for supper.

780
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,500
I heard your conversation. I
assume you

781
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,500
want to make some more of your
lovely hair products so you can continue

782
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,500
I might as well tell you now
Velma, we will be taking

783
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:51,500
Miss Charlotte away from here
tonight. Somewhere where she can be take

784
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:55,500
care of properly. So there will
be no more need for you

785
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,500
or your lovely stew.
- Taken care of? Someplace

786
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,500
where she can be taken care of?
Well I've been taking care of

787
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,533
her ever since Big Daddy died,
and we've been getting along

788
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:11,533
just fine until the likes of
you came.

789
01:00:11,533 --> 01:00:15,533
Besides, only Miss Charlotte

790
01:00:15,533 --> 01:00:19,533
can give me my walking papers.
- You don't seem to understand

791
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:23,533
My cousin is not in the right
frame of mind.

792
01:00:23,533 --> 01:00:27,533
Oh and by the way, the childish
tricks you've been playing here,

793
01:00:27,533 --> 01:00:31,533
trying to frighten me into
leaving? A more than sufficient reason t

794
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:35,533
Tricks? I didn't rip your
slutty old red

795
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:39,533
dress.
- Odd, you seem to know it was ripped.

796
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:43,533
I saw it. I saw it hanging in
your room.

797
01:00:43,533 --> 01:00:47,567
Besides. I know you're here to
get your

798
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:51,567
hands on all Miss Charlotte's
money. That's why you

799
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:55,567
want to take her out of here
and take her someplace and commit her.

800
01:00:55,567 --> 01:00:59,567
I know what you're up to missy,

801
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:03,567
missy, missy, miss missy.

802
01:01:03,567 --> 01:01:07,600
This is none of your concern.
The point is, you are

803
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,600
no longer needed. You are being
let go.

804
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,600
You are fired! Is that plain
enough

805
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,567
for your lily-white trash brain
to comprehend?

806
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:23,600
Now get out.

807
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:29,267
No. I'm gonna go upstairs

808
01:01:29,267 --> 01:01:33,267
and tell Miss Charlotte what
you've been up to.

809
01:01:33,267 --> 01:01:37,300
Go ahead. Tell her whatever
you'd like,

810
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,300
Come now my dear Velma. You're
not exactly the most reliable

811
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,333
sort due to your long standing
as an alcoholic.

812
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:49,333
What's all this ruckus going on down her

813
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:53,333
Oh, you should be ashamed,

814
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:57,367
both of you! I see everything
now

815
01:01:57,367 --> 01:02:01,367
missy, missy miss missy, miss
missy!

816
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:05,400
Now Velma, don't be ridiculous.

817
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,400
There ain't nothing going on
here.

818
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,400
We're just trying to take care
of Charlotte, because she's

819
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,433
ill and she needs special care.

820
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:21,433
All right.

821
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:25,433
I'm going. But don't think
you're not going to be

822
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:29,467
sorry. Both of you!

823
01:02:29,467 --> 01:02:33,467
Yuck, that little pork-smelling
slut.

824
01:02:33,467 --> 01:02:37,500
Can't wait until she's out of
my hair. Do you think she's going to be

825
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,533
Now Melanie, no one's going to
believe her.

826
01:02:41,533 --> 01:02:45,533
Trust me.

827
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:53,567
Well they are taking advantage
of Miss Charlotte!

828
01:02:53,567 --> 01:02:57,600
I tell you, she has not been
the same since that woman got here.

829
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,600
There is something going on
there that is really bad, it's really ba

830
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,600
I tell you! I think they are
trying to

831
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:09,633
commit her to someplace so they
can get her money!

832
01:03:09,633 --> 01:03:13,667
I'm so sorry, what can I do.
- Well now, I saw the way she took to yo

833
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:17,667
I never saw her take to no one
like she did that, now, you could

834
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:21,700
talk to her, and you could tell
her not to listen to that

835
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,700
Miss Melanie and Dr. Drew.
- I thought it was Mildred.

836
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:31,167
Oh, I heard Dr. Drew address
her as Melanie.

837
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:35,167
What if he just addressed her by acciden

838
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:39,200
That woman ain't sweet at all.

839
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,200
ou do realize these are serious
accusations you're making. What if I cam

840
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,200
Oh, no, no, no, that would not
do. She just doesn't take to you like sh

841
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,233
to Mr. Wills. I mean, she likes
you for other things, but

842
01:03:51,233 --> 01:03:55,233
she still doesn't trust you.
Besides,

843
01:03:55,233 --> 01:03:59,233
I'm worried about that Miss
Melanie and her charms.

844
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:03,233
Oh, I just don't think Mr.
Wells would be as influenced by that wom

845
01:04:03,233 --> 01:04:07,267
charms.
- I wouldn't be influenced at all by her

846
01:04:07,267 --> 01:04:11,267
I've never met that Dr. Drew.
- Oh, he's a real looker.

847
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:15,300
Really?

848
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,300
See Charlotte, you just needed
a good nap.

849
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:23,300
You look much better, and
you'll feel much better once you're away

850
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:27,300
old dusty house filled with
antique treasures.

851
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,300

853

Big Daddy.

854
01:04:50,067 --> 01:04:54,067
Charlotte. I got to tell you
something, you've got to listen

855
01:04:54,067 --> 01:04:58,067
[bell dings]
- Don't get that. You got to

856
01:04:58,067 --> 01:05:02,067
listen to me. Charlotte, these
people are out to get you, my

857
01:05:02,067 --> 01:05:06,067
sweet. That's not Mildred. And
Drew?

858
01:05:06,067 --> 01:05:10,067
Well, he's -
[bell dings]

859
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:14,067
Maybe it's John coming to get
me.

860
01:05:14,067 --> 01:05:18,100
Miss Charlotte, over here!

861
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:22,100
That's great, Miss Charlotte,
give me more excitement?

862
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,100
Now, give me some fear. Really
great stuff.

863
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:30,100
This time, give it all you've
got.

864
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:34,100
Thank you, Miss Charlotte.

865
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:38,100
*

866
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:42,100
Charlotte? What was all the
commotion?

867
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:53,767
*

868
01:05:53,767 --> 01:05:57,767
I love you, Charlotte.

869
01:05:57,767 --> 01:06:06,200
*

870
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,200
How is she?
- I would say

871
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,200
she'd be tripping real good
right now. Probably sleep

872
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,233
till morning.
- Well I have to figure out how to dispo

873
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:22,233
had made. He's quite charming,
don't you think?

874
01:06:22,233 --> 01:06:26,233
Amazing work.

875
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:30,233
So, do you think we have her
where we want her?

876
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:34,267
Oh, Drew, I love you.
- Drew?

877
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:38,267
Where were you?

878
01:06:38,267 --> 01:06:42,267
I should say. She's just one
little

879
01:06:42,267 --> 01:06:46,300
more nudge until she's locked
up for the

880
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:50,267
rest of her days.
[laughing]

881
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:06,333
Good morning Charlotte!

882
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:10,333
There, what a lovely breakfast!
- That's not Velma's

883
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:14,333
southern cooking.
- No, I made it. Doesn't it look yummy?
- I want Velma's

884
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:18,367
southern breakfast. Where's
Velma?

885
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:22,367
Don't you remember Charlotte?
You fired her!

886
01:07:22,367 --> 01:07:26,367
You told her she was a no good

887
01:07:26,367 --> 01:07:30,400
filthy whore and to get out and
to never step foot in this house again.

888
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,400
I did?
- Yes.
- I don't remember that.

889
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,400
You also mentioned she smelled
like pork.

890
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,400
I remember being downstairs
and...

891
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,433
John...

892
01:07:46,433 --> 01:07:53,900
[crying]

893
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,933
There, isn't that better? Now
I'll just take this tray

894
01:07:57,933 --> 01:08:01,933
away and you can lie there and
drool.

895
01:08:01,933 --> 01:08:05,933
Hello?

896
01:08:09,933 --> 01:08:13,967
A priceless heirloom.

897
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:17,967
Poor Charlotte will be so upset.

898
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:27,433
Meeoooww.
- Oh, it's just a cat.

899
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:31,433
Just an old, disgusting
pork-smelling cat.

900
01:08:39,467 --> 01:08:43,433
I guess I'll go to the kitchen
and get a broom and clean up this mess.

901
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:47,467
And maybe I'll have a snack. Oh
yes.

902
01:08:47,467 --> 01:08:51,467
A snack would be nice.

903
01:08:51,467 --> 01:08:58,933
*

904
01:08:58,933 --> 01:09:02,967
Miss Charlotte? Miss Charlotte?

905
01:09:02,967 --> 01:09:06,967
Mis Charlotte!

906
01:09:06,967 --> 01:09:13,067
*

907
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:17,067
They've been drugging you up!
Oh my stars. What kind of

908
01:09:17,067 --> 01:09:21,067
crazy trip have they set you on?
- John...

909
01:09:21,067 --> 01:09:25,067
No, It's not John! John is dead
and buried.

910
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:29,067
Big Daddy?
- No, it's not Big Daddy, he's dead and

911
01:09:29,067 --> 01:09:34,067
Now hush Miss Charlotte, we've
got to get you out of here.

912
01:09:34,067 --> 01:09:42,800
*

913
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,800
Charlotte. I brought you a
candy bar.

914
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,800
It is chocolate and nougat and
plenty of nuts. Doesn't that sound

915
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,833
tasty?
- Velma?

916
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:58,833
Velma? Why Charlotte, why would
you be asking for her? She's gone,

917
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:02,867
remember? You fired that little
hillbilly pork-smelling

918
01:10:02,867 --> 01:10:06,867
slut.
- She's getting me a sweater.

919
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:10,867
A sweater! Charlotte, you're
delusional, because

920
01:10:10,867 --> 01:10:14,867
that little bitch better not
show her face around here

921
01:10:14,867 --> 01:10:18,900
ever!
- Meeeoooww.
- What the hell do you

922
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,900
think you're doing?
- I came here to check on Charlotte.

923
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:26,933
She seemed a little cold, so I
was getting her

924
01:10:26,933 --> 01:10:30,967
a sweater.
- A sweater. How nice.

925
01:10:30,967 --> 01:10:34,967
I was coming to collect some of
my things.

926
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:39,000
Is my cousin one of your things?

927
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Now get out of my house! This
house! Get out!

928
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Oh now you're showing your true
colors!

929
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,033
You're that stinking bitch
sister

930
01:10:51,033 --> 01:10:55,067
Melanie!
- I told you

931
01:10:55,067 --> 01:10:59,067
to get out and stay out!
- Oh, I'll go all right.

932
01:10:59,067 --> 01:11:03,100
I'll go right to the Sheriff's
office and tell him

933
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:07,133
everything that's going on down
here!

934
01:11:07,133 --> 01:12:01,433
* [ominous music]

935
01:12:05,467 --> 01:12:14,100

936
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:18,133
The filthy pork-smelling whore
is dead.

937
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:22,133
No stupid, Charlotte doesn't
smell like pork. She smells like- neverm

938
01:12:22,133 --> 01:12:26,167
Just get here right away.

939
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:38,200
This is Drew. I'm over here at
Velma's and she's had a terrible acciden

940
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,233
She fell off a roof.
- That's terrible

941
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:46,267
news, Drew.
- Velma's dead.

942
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:50,267
You know Velma. She was
probably up on the

943
01:12:50,267 --> 01:12:54,267
roof fixing her antennae or
taking down her Christmas lights

944
01:12:54,267 --> 01:12:58,267
from last year or fixing the
holes in her roof, who knows.

945
01:12:58,267 --> 01:13:02,300
Guess I'd better call some of
her kinfolk. Not that she

946
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:06,300
has much more than a cousin out
in Lafayette.

947
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:10,300
Thanks for calling.

948
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:14,300
There's nothing

949
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:18,300
more to worry about. Now, I'm

950
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:22,300
the Mary, and you're the Rhoda.

951
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:26,300
Well I guess I'd better be
taking the body down to the morgue.

952
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:30,333
We wouldn't want them to know
that "Miss Mildred"

953
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:34,333
threw Velma down the stairs and
practically broke every bone in

954
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:38,333
her body.

955
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:42,333
Now I have the upper hand, and
we're

956
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:46,333
going to follow my plan.

957
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:50,333
Charlotte...

958
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:54,333

Charlotte!

966
01:14:26,433 --> 01:14:30,433
It's Mildred. Keep things
going. I'll take care of her.

Look what you've done!

01:16:50,767 --> 01:16:54,767
You've killed Drew!

984
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:58,767
You stupid, stupid bitch!

Melanie! Mildred, whatever your
name is, please

987
01:17:07,633 --> 01:17:11,633
don't call the sheriff, Jewel
Mayhem will be laughing at me if she fin

988
01:17:11,633 --> 01:17:15,633
killed anybody. Never, never,
never, we can think of something

989
01:17:15,633 --> 01:17:19,633
I've got lots of money. Lots of
money.

990
01:17:19,633 --> 01:17:25,467
Piles of money. I'll give it to
you. All of it. You can have all of my m

991
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:29,500
I wish to God

992
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:33,500
I'd never come here.

993
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:37,500
All right. I'll get the car and you watc

994
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:41,533
It's the Sheriff and that nosy
Mr. Wills.

995
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:45,533
Just stay quiet and stay out of
sight.

996
01:17:45,533 --> 01:17:49,533
Well go on!

997
01:17:49,533 --> 01:17:53,567
Luke, Mr. Wills.

998
01:17:53,567 --> 01:17:57,567
What can I do for you?
- Well, Miss Mildred.

999
01:17:57,567 --> 01:18:01,600
Sorry I haven't been by to give you my r
- That's quite all right,

doing Sheriff things and all.

01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:10,867
[laughing]

1002
01:18:10,867 --> 01:18:14,867
Well, you sure are a sight for
sore eyes.

1003
01:18:14,867 --> 01:18:18,867
What can I help you with?
- Velma.

1004
01:18:18,867 --> 01:18:22,900
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about Velma's

1005
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,900
issue, there seems to me some
confusion with time and such,

1006
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:30,900
so Velma came by, she was real upset abo

1007
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,900
Sheriff, but Charlotte is still
asleep, can't this wait until morning?

1008
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:38,900
Yes, I suppose it could.

1009
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,933
I'm sorry. We'll just come

1010
01:18:42,933 --> 01:18:46,933
by first thing. And you sure
are a sight for sore eyes.

1011
01:18:46,933 --> 01:18:50,967
Oh Luke, you're not so bad
yourself.

1012
01:18:50,967 --> 01:18:54,933
Please give Miss Charlotte my
condolences.

1013
01:18:54,933 --> 01:18:58,967
Yes, this has been a terrible
shock for her.

1014
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,967
Give her my deepest sympathies.
- I will, Mr. Wills.
- Goodnight.

1015
01:19:02,967 --> 01:19:06,967
Miss Melanie.
- Mildred!
- Melanie!

1016
01:19:06,967 --> 01:19:10,967
I can't do it.

1017
01:19:10,967 --> 01:19:14,967
I can't do anything else. I
don't think I can help you.

1018
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:19,067
You can't help me?

1019
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:23,067
I'm the one that's helping you!

1020
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:27,067
Do you want me to call the
Sheriff, Charlotte? Wash my hands of the

1021
01:19:27,067 --> 01:19:31,067
Is that what you want? All
right, then.

1022
01:19:55,067 --> 01:20:00,667
[screeching]

1023
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:04,667
*

1024
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:08,667
Do you mind?

1025
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:14,500
*

1026
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:19,633
I must be the worst person in
the world

1027
01:20:19,633 --> 01:20:23,633
to have killed Drew!
- Will you please

1028
01:20:23,633 --> 01:20:27,667
shut up?
- Sorry.

1029
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:31,700
Now get out.

1030
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:35,700
Don't make me do it Mildred.
- I said get out!

1031
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:39,733
[splashing]

1032
01:20:43,733 --> 01:20:47,767
[crying]

1033
01:20:47,767 --> 01:20:51,767
Will you please shut up?

1034
01:20:51,767 --> 01:20:55,767
Mildred, they'll be finding him
soon and coming to the house

1035
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:59,767
and asking questions, and I
can't do it. I just can't

1036
01:20:59,767 --> 01:21:03,767
do it. You have to tell them.
You have to talk to them and tell them I

1037
01:21:03,767 --> 01:21:07,767
I'm really ill and I'm not able
to answer questions. They'll believe tha

1038
01:21:07,767 --> 01:21:11,800
Everybody in town thinks I'm
looney anyway. They'll believe that. Jew

1039
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,767
have a field day with this one.
You have to talk to them!

1040
01:21:15,767 --> 01:21:19,767
They'll find out if you don't!

1041
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,800
Now really,

1042
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:36,600
you shut your mouth!

1043
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,567
You'll do exactly what I tell
you

1044
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:44,600
to do. If I tell you to lie,

1045
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:48,633
you'll lie. If I tell you to
run around

1046
01:21:48,633 --> 01:21:52,633
town with your panties on your
head,

1047
01:21:52,633 --> 01:21:56,633
you'll do that, too.

1048
01:21:56,633 --> 01:22:00,667
Do you understand?

1049
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:04,667
[horn beeping]

1050
01:22:04,667 --> 01:22:08,700
Now get out! I'm going to drive
the car out back.

1051
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,733
Why are you going to drive -
- Because I want to, that's why!

1052
01:22:12,733 --> 01:22:16,733
Go up to your room, and I'll
come back later to check on you.

1053
01:22:16,733 --> 01:22:20,767
[crying]

1054
01:22:24,767 --> 01:22:40,867
*

1055
01:22:40,867 --> 01:22:44,867
Ah! Ah!

1056
01:22:44,867 --> 01:22:48,867
Ah!

1057
01:22:48,867 --> 01:22:52,867
[screaming]
- He's here! He's here!

1058
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:56,900
He's here! He's here!

1059
01:22:56,900 --> 01:23:00,900
He's dead! He's dead!

1060

*

1061
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:14,567
Hush up, sweet Charlotte.

1062
01:23:14,567 --> 01:23:18,567
Hush up

1063
01:23:18,567 --> 01:23:22,600
[chuckling]

1064
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,600
Oh gorgeous!

1065
01:23:38,633 --> 01:23:42,633
Wow.

1066
01:23:42,633 --> 01:23:50,433
[chuckling]

1067
01:24:02,467 --> 01:24:06,500
To a very profitable

1068
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,500
arrangement. By tomorrow,

1069
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,500
we should have her fully
committed, and it shouldn't be too long

1070
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:18,500
you are in charge of all that
she possesses.

1071
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:22,533
Which I believe is in the

1072
01:24:22,533 --> 01:24:26,533
millions.
- Well, as soon as everything's in my na

1073
01:24:26,533 --> 01:24:30,533
I'm going to move far, far
away. Maybe Paris.

1074
01:24:30,533 --> 01:24:34,567
Hong Kong. Tuluth.

1075
01:24:34,567 --> 01:24:38,567
Without me?
- Drew.

1076
01:24:38,567 --> 01:24:42,600
You didn't honestly think that
we would be romantically involved, did y

1077
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,600
I used you. Now you'll be amply

1078
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:50,600
rewarded.
- But you have forgotten one minor

1079
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:54,633
little detail. Velma.

1080
01:24:54,633 --> 01:24:58,633
You killed her. For me to
forget that bit of information,

1081
01:24:58,633 --> 01:25:02,667
I'm afraid I'm coming with you.

1082
01:25:02,667 --> 01:25:07,167
I love you, Melanie. With all
my heart.

1083
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:11,167
Touche'.

1084
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:15,200
Oh, my dear, dear Drew, but you
don't know

1085
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:19,200
the whole story. You see,

1086
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:23,200
I've been blackmailing Jewel
Mayhem for years.

1087
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:27,200
Ever since I just happened to
see her kill her husband John in a viole

1088
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:31,200
Once I bled her dry

1089
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:35,200
and helped her go stark raving
mad, I began to

1090
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,233
work on Charlotte.

1091
01:25:39,233 --> 01:25:43,233
Charlotte never liked me. She
liked my sister, of course.

1092
01:25:43,233 --> 01:25:47,233
The nice one. The pretty one.

1093
01:25:47,233 --> 01:25:51,233
Not me. So, I started

1094
01:25:51,233 --> 01:25:55,233
sending her those letters.
She's been getting those for

1095
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:59,233
years and years and years.

1096
01:25:59,233 --> 01:26:03,233
Well that's all well and good
Melanie,

1097
01:26:03,233 --> 01:26:07,233
You seem

1098
01:26:07,233 --> 01:26:11,267
to keep forgetting that you and
I are in this

1099
01:26:11,267 --> 01:26:15,267
together. And if I go down in
any way,

1100
01:26:15,267 --> 01:26:19,267
I'll take you down with me.

1101
01:26:19,267 --> 01:26:23,267
Well Drew, when you're right,

1102
01:26:23,267 --> 01:26:27,267
you're right. Here, darling,
let's have a drink then.

1103
01:26:27,267 --> 01:26:33,967
To us.
- To us.

1104
01:26:37,967 --> 01:26:42,067
Well, we have one more show to
put on tomorrow morning, and that's goin

1105
01:26:42,067 --> 01:26:46,067
to be a doozy. I have to act
devastated that my

1106
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:50,067
poor cousin Charlotte has gone
completely insane!

1107
01:26:50,067 --> 01:26:54,067
Now I'm just stuck figuring out
to do with all these old, decrepit

1108
01:26:54,067 --> 01:26:58,067
priceless relics.

1109
01:26:58,067 --> 01:27:02,067
Is something wrong, Drew?
- Very strange

1110
01:27:02,067 --> 01:27:06,633
tingling sensation. My thumbs
is going numb!

1111
01:27:06,633 --> 01:27:10,633
I'm losing my, my footing.

1112
01:27:10,633 --> 01:27:14,633
My tongue is...

1113
01:27:14,633 --> 01:27:18,667
swollen. It's like I'm letting
go of all my

1114
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:22,667
faculties! Like I've been...

1115
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:26,667
Like what, Drew?

1116
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:30,667
Like you've been poisoned?

1117
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:34,700
Some men can't hold their
poison. And by the way, Drew,

1118
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:38,700
That was for jilting me.

1119
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:42,700
Maybe I do hold onto things.

1120
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:46,733
[chuckling]

1121
01:27:54,733 --> 01:27:58,733
[screaming]

1122
01:28:06,767 --> 01:28:10,767
*

1123
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:18,800
*

1124
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,800
Fix your hair up all pretty,
and put on some nice lipstick.

1125
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:31,267
*

1126
01:28:31,267 --> 01:28:35,267
I got you that real nice music
box.

1127
01:28:35,267 --> 01:28:39,267
So you can remember me.

1128
01:28:39,267 --> 01:28:53,200
*

1129
01:28:57,233 --> 01:29:01,233
Mildred is actually

1130
01:29:01,233 --> 01:29:05,267
Miss Melanie.

1131
01:29:05,267 --> 01:29:09,267
That means

1132
01:29:09,267 --> 01:29:13,267
Melanie must've gotten the boobie job!pp

1133
01:29:13,267 --> 01:29:17,300
that's what I always say.
- I bet Miss Charlotte just went on a ra

1134
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:21,267
and killed Velma and her cousin.
- and she probably got

1135
01:29:21,267 --> 01:29:25,300
away with it, too. Just like
she did before.

1136
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:29,300
She was living in the lap of
luxury.

1137
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:33,300
Big Daddy... I gotta go now.

1138
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:37,300
They're going to tear down the
house, and I have to stay in a hotel unt

1139
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:41,300
figure out what I'm going to
do. Where I'm going to live.

1140
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:45,300
If only that Jewel Mayhem would
drop dead so I could buy her house

1141
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:49,300
and live there. Still be close
to you and John.

1142
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:53,300
Don't worry about a thing my
little daughter.

1143
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:57,300
No, Miss Melanie.

1144
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:09,333
Somebody help! Miss Mayhem, she
done died!

1145
01:30:09,333 --> 01:30:13,333
Charlotte!

1146
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:17,333
Charlotte, please! Please,
Charlotte!

1147
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:21,333
Please!

1148
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:25,333
Charlotte!
- Mildred, is that you?

1149
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:29,333
Yes, She tied me up and kept me
drugged.

1150
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:33,333
Drugged?

1151
01:30:37,367 --> 01:30:41,333
My stars!

1152
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:54,867
I killed John Mayhem. Sorry.
Yours Truly, Jewel Mayhem.

1153
01:30:54,867 --> 01:30:58,900
All this time.

1154
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:18,933
*

1155
01:31:22,933 --> 01:31:38,967

1156
01:31:42,967 --> 01:31:51,667
*

1157
01:31:55,667 --> 01:32:23,700
*

1158
01:32:27,733 --> 01:32:31,733
Driver,

1159
01:32:31,733 --> 01:32:35,733
take me to Jewel Mayhem's place.

1160
01:32:35,733 --> 01:32:39,733
She won't be needing it anymore.

1161
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:47,767
Driver, stop the car.

1162
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:55,767
Yes, Miss Charlotte?

1163
01:32:55,767 --> 01:32:59,800
Get in. I'm moving to Jewel
Mayhem's place.

1164
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,800
That's a marvelous idea,

1165
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:07,833
Charlotte. Now, don't you worry
about a thing.

1166
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:11,833
Montgomery and I are going to
take care of everything.

1167
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:15,833
Aren't we, Montgomery?

1168
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:19,833
Oh, it's so good to be home,
and so wonderful

1169
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:23,867
to see you. And remember
darling,

1170
01:33:23,867 --> 01:33:27,867
not a thing to worry about.

1171
01:33:27,867 --> 01:33:31,867
Everything's going to be just
