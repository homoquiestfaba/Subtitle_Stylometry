00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,707
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

2
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:24,377
KNOW WHAT? FUCK YOU.

3
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:28,515
YOUR LITTLE GIRL NEEDS YOU,
GIGI.

4
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:30,183
MOMMY?

5
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:34,221
MOMMY?

6
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,408
- BONJOUR, SWEETHEART.

7
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:58,545
- YOU LOOK SLEEPY.
- OH, I JUST WOKE UP.

8
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:00,780
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.
HOW IS EVERYTHING AT HOME?

9
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:02,449
- EVERYTHING'S FINE.
- YEAH?

10
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,351
MARIE DECIDED
TO DRESS HERSELF THIS MORNING.

11
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:06,553

BONJOUR.
HERE'S DADDY, MOMMY.

17
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:21,568
I GUESS SHE'S GOT
BETTER THINGS TO DO, MOMMY.

18
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:22,702
YES.

19
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:24,404
WHAT TIME'S
YOUR AUDITION, BABE?

20
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:26,673

<i>JE T'AIME.
BYE-BYE.</i>

24
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:39,352
YOU THINK
YOU CAN TREAT ME LIKE THIS

25
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:41,454
AND NOT PAY FOR IT, BASTARD?

26
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:44,557
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH, MISTER.

27
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:48,528
AW, YEAH,
YOU BETTER BELIEVE I DO.

28
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:50,863
WHAT DO YOU THINK...
YOU THINK... YOU THINK YOU CAN

29
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:54,033
TREAT ME LIKE THIS
AND NOT PAY FOR IT, BASTARD?

30
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:57,437
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH, MISTER.

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,440
OH, YEAH,
YOU BETTER BELIEVE I DO.

32
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:52,659
THANK YOU.

33
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:55,828
- FOR YOU.
- THANKS, MS. GENEREAU.

34
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,902
YOU THINK
YOU CAN TREAT ME LIKE THIS

35
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:04,737
AND NOT PAY FOR IT, BASTARD?

36
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:07,440
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH, MISTER.

37
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:11,010
- YOU HAVE REAL BALLS, BITCH.
- OH, YOU BETTER BELIEVE I DO.

38
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:13,045
JESUS, I HOPE
THAT GUN'S NOT REAL.

39
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,082
AND WHAT IF
IT WERE, BASTARD?

40
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:23,089
THAT WAS GREAT.
THANKS, GIGI.

41
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:24,624
<i>THANK YOU.
MERCI BEAUCOUP.</i>

42
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:26,659
I HAVE TO SAY
I LOVE THIS ROLE.

43
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:28,495
I'M EXCITED
TO PLAY A HEROINE.

44
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:32,064
TO BE HONEST, I THINK YOU
MIGHT BE TOO YOUNG FOR THE ROLE

45
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:34,634
AND PROBABLY
A LITTLE TOO SEXY FOR IT.

46
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,437
I CAN DO IT
ANOTHER WAY FOR YOU.

47
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,406
LET'S TRY
THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER, OKAY?

48
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,408
UH, YOU CAN JUST
GIVE ME A COLD READING

49
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,643
AND MAYBE
A LITTLE LESS ACCENT.

50
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:47,013
PAGE 88 AT THE TOP,
THREE LINES.

51
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:07,800
IT SAYS THAT I AM,
UM, 20-SOMETHING

52
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:10,069
DRUG ADDICT PROSTITUTE
IN A RELATIONSHIP

53
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:14,741
WITH A MARRIED COUPLE
AND THAT I AM NAKED AND TIED UP?

54
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,912
SO FRENCH.

55
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:41,601
THANK YOU.

56
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:54,146
TWO MALES,
ONE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ONE WHITE.

57
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:02,021
I'LL MEET YOU
BACK IN THE LOBBY, OKAY.

58
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:07,026
- OKAY.
- LET'S MOVE OUT.

59
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:22,642
WHAT?

60
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:25,578
NEVER SEEN A CLOWN BEFORE?

61
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:30,049
NO FUNNY BUSINESS, CLOWNY.

62
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,921
I'LL BE OFF IN A MOMENT.

63
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,729
FUCKING HELL.

64
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,665
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

65
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:47,266
OKAY, EVERYONE'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

66
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,235
JUST RELAX.
THIS IS OFFICER MUNOZ.

67
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:50,903
THIS IS OFFICER MUNOZ.

68
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:53,272
DO YOU READ ME?
DOES ANYONE READ ME?

69
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,241
IS ANYONE ON THIS FREQUENCY?

70
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:56,976
ISN'T THERE A PHONE
ON THE PANEL?

71
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,811
NO.
THERE'S A BUTTON HERE.

72
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:01,781
WELL,
PRESS THE FUCKING BUTTON.

73
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:11,858
JESUS.

74
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:13,192
THIS IS OFFICER MUNOZ.

75
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:15,261
I'M STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR, GUYS.
10-13.

76
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:19,599
- WHAT IS A 10-13?
- IT'S POLICE BULLSHIT FOR

77
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:20,900
"WE'RE FUCKED

78
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,068
DO YOU MIND, SIR?

79
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,703
YEAH, I FUCKING MIND.
DO YOU MIND?

80
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:24,904
COME ON, WHAT'S IT BEEN,

81
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:28,107
CAN EVERYONE
PLEASE JUST SHUT UP?

82
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,277
DOESN'T ANYONE'S PHONES WORK?

83
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,613
WELL, MINE IS... IS...
IT'S SO DARK.

84
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:35,147
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN FIND IT.
- I DON'T HAVE ANY BARS.

85
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:36,983
NAH, CELL PHONE BOLLOCKS.

86
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:39,285
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF HERE.

87
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:41,654
- WHY ISN'T ANYONE RESPONDING?
- AND WHAT'S THAT FUCKING ALARM?

88
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:43,790
YOU'RE NOT
HELPING THINGS, SIR.

89
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:46,058
CAN YOU JUST
PRY OPEN THE DOORS?

90
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:56,035
LET ME TRY.
I CAN DO IT.

91
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:58,905
COME ON!

00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:03,676
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.
SO...

94
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,977
WHAT ABOUT THE CEILING?

95
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:06,979
CAN WE JUST OPEN THAT UP
AND CLIMB OUT THERE?

96
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:08,114
LADIES FIRST.

97
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:10,182
I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOUR HUMOR.

98
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:11,350
NOBODY'S CLIMBING ANYWHERE.

99
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:12,619
I HAVE A CONDITION,
YOUNG LADY...

100
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:13,986
JUST HANG ON, MA'AM.

101
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,154
CAN'T YOU USE YOUR STICK?

102
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:19,091
THE STICK ON YOUR BELT?

103
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,968
WE'RE IN THE PARKING GARAGE.

104
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:30,302
COME ON.

105
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:33,339
I'LL HELP YOU DOWN.
ONE AT A TIME.

106
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:37,810
BE CAREFUL.

107
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:39,278
BE CAREFUL.

108
00:07:39,311 --> 00:07:41,147
HANG ON TO ME, OKAY, OKAY.

OKAY, OKAY.

111
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:48,988
LET'S GO.

112
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:53,993
HELLO.

113
00:07:56,996 --> 00:07:58,064

114
00:07:58,097 --> 00:08:01,267
- THANK YOU.

115
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:23,322
MERDE!

116
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:28,427
I CAN FUCKING MANAGE.
I'M NOT A BLEEDING SPASTIC.

117
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,863
THE EXIT GATE'S LOCKED DOWN.

118
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:35,001
FUCKING HELL.
SO WE TAKE THE FUCKING STAIRS.

119
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,740
I DON'T FUCKING BELIEVE IT.

120
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:43,009
DID ANYONE TRY
THE OTHER ELEVATOR?

121
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,077
THERE MUST BE
A POWER OUTAGE.

122
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,345
YEAH, BUT WHY ARE
THE LIGHTS STILL ON?

123
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:47,880
THOSE ARE
THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS.

124
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:50,249
WHAT IS
THE FUCKING EMERGENCY?

125
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:52,051
AND HOW SOON
WILL THIS BE OVER?

126
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:53,820
I NEED SOMETHING
IN MY STOMACH.

127
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:57,389
NO WAY.

128
00:08:57,423 --> 00:08:59,325
HOLD THAT DOOR,
HOLD THAT DOOR!

129
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,260
HOLD THAT DOOR, HOLD THAT DOOR!
OH, SHIT.

130
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:03,830
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
- YOU JUST LOCKED US IN.

131
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:05,898
- A FUCKING DUNGEON.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

132
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:08,935
ARE YOU SURE
THE EXIT GATES ARE LOCKED?

133
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:11,070
AH!

134
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:14,073
- HEY, ASSHOLE!
- WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?

135
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:24,083
COME ON,
LET'S TRY TO LIFT IT.

136
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,226

137
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,828

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,173
HELP!

140
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:50,176
NO, DON'T LEAVE!

141
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,477
NO!

142
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,146
HE WAS LOOKING RIGHT AT US.

143
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,948
MAYBE HE WENT FOR HELP.

144
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,149
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

145
00:09:57,183 --> 00:10:00,119
WE'RE...
WE'RE TRAPPED DOWN HERE?

146
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:04,090
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
LIKE A CLOWN?

147
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,092
BECAUSE HE IS
A FUCKING CLOWN.

148
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,426
THIS IS OFFICER MUNOZ.

149
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,029
DOES ANYBODY IN THE BUILDING
READ ME? COME IN.

150
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:11,964
I'M NOT EVEN GETTING STATIC.

151
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:14,333
HONEY,
LET'S JUST CALL 911, HUH?

152
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,868
NOBODY'S GETTING RECEPTION.

153
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:19,205
OH, THAT ALARM
IS GIVING ME A HEADACHE.

154
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:22,074
IT'S GIVING US ALL
A HEADACHE.

155
00:10:26,378 --> 00:10:29,115
IS THAT YOUR CAR?

156
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:36,055
WHY IS THE TRUNK OPEN?

157
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:47,299
STOP!

158
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,506
- HEY!

159
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,175

00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,810

161
00:10:57,844 --> 00:10:59,511
PUT IT DOWN AND LET

162
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:03,850
I'LL FUCKING PULL THE TRIGGER!
I'LL DO IT RIGHT HERE!

163
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:06,452
EVERYBODY JUST BACK AWAY.

164
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:07,519
NOBODY FUCKING MOVE!

165
00:11:07,553 --> 00:11:08,921
JUST TAKE YOUR FINGER

166
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:10,189
SLOWLY OFF THE TRIGGER.

167
00:11:10,222 --> 00:11:11,858
CAN YOU DO THAT, D?

168
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:13,826
BOOM. HER HEAD EXPLODES
LIKE A PUMPKIN.

169
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,928

- OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.

170
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:17,429
PLEASE,
I'VE GOT A LITTLE GIRL.

171
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:19,398
- SHE'S GOT A LITTLE GIRL, D.
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

172
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:20,900
I'M GETTING THE HELL
OUT OF HERE,

173
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,101
AND I'M TAKING THIS WOMAN
WITH ME.

174
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:24,203
OKAY,
EVERYBODY JUST MOVE BEHIND ME.

175
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:26,939
THIS MAN ESCAPED
A PRISON BUS LAST NIGHT

176
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,941
AND ELUDED A MANHUNT...
HE'S A VIOLENT KILLER.

177
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:31,443
I DIDN'T MURDER THAT WOMAN.
I'M INNOCENT.

178
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:34,546
SO PUT THE GUN DOWN,
AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT.

179
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,048
CAN YOU DO THAT, D?

180
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:37,917
DON'T YOU FUCKING
SMOOTH TALK ME.

181
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,419
HEY, MAN.
WHOA, WHOA.

182
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:41,954
THERE'S GOTTA
BE A WAY TO NEGOTIATE.

183
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:43,890
NOBODY'S TALKING TO YOU.

184
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:45,591
IT'S OKAY, I'M A LAWYER.
I DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

185
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,526
PLEASE,
JUST PUT YOUR GUNS DOWN.

186
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,229
THAT'S THE ONLY
SENSIBLE OPTION HERE.

187
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:51,530
THE ONLY SENSIBLE OPTION

188
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:53,099
WOULD BE TO LET ME JUST
WALK UP OUT OF HERE.

189
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:54,133
WE'RE TRAPPED DOWN HERE, D.

190
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,502
NOW, I'LL LOWER MY GUN

191
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:57,603
IF YOU GO FIRST.

192
00:11:57,636 --> 00:11:59,271
YOU PUT YOUR GUN
ON THE FLOOR.

193
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:00,472
I CAN'T GIVE UP MY GUN,
I'M SORRY.

194
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:01,974
WHO'S MAKING
THE FUCKING RULES?

195
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:05,377
- HE'S GONNA KILL ME!
- OKAY, OKAY.

196
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:08,180
I'LL PUT MY GUN ON THE GROUND
IF YOU LET THE WOMAN GO.

197
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:11,317
BUT I WANT YOU
TO DO THE SAME.

198
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,618
IS THAT A DEAL?

199
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:15,521
WELL, I HAVE TO SIT DOWN.

200
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:19,358
I'M... I'M... I'M REALLY...
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

201
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:32,338
FUCK.

202
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:35,674
THAT'S THE BEST
YOU'RE GONNA GET.

203
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:37,443
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, MA'AM.

204
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:41,280
- YOU SCARED ME TO DEATH.
- I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE.

205
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:45,251
I'M AN INNOCENT MAN,
WRONGLY ACCUSED.

206
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:47,419
I FUCKING BELIEVE HIM,
DON'T YOU?

207
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:49,188
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE ALL HAVING A GOOD TIME.

208
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:50,990
NOW I WANT THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE!

209
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:52,358
WE'RE LOCKED IN HERE, D!

210
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:54,626
THERE'S BEEN A POWER OUTAGE,

211
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,931
AND THE DOORS ARE SEALED,
SO YOU CAN JUST COOL OFF, OKAY?

212
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:00,632
UH, EXCUSE ME?

213
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:05,171
YOUR FRIEND
IS BLEEDING REALLY BAD.

214
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:07,940
FUCK HIM.
HE AIN'T MY FRIEND.

215
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:10,076
THAT FOOL FOLLOWED ME
OUT THE HOLE.

216
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,410
HE'S GONNA DIE LIKE THAT.

217
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:14,380
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
FUCKING SHOT HIM THEN.

218
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:16,148
IT'S A GUTSHOT.

219
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,350
NOTHING Y'ALL CAN DO BUT LET
THE MOTHERFUCKER DIE IN PEACE.

220
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:20,219
I'M GONNA TRY TO RADIO
FOR HELP, ALL RIGHT?

221
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:23,522
- I'M GOING FOR MY RADIO...
- STAY OFF THE FUCKING RADIO!

222
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:26,959
HEY, HEY, D, IS IT?

223
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:28,594
THE OFFICER'S RIGHT.
WE'RE TRAPPED DOWN HERE.

224
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:31,030
NOW, THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO

225
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:33,532
IS WORK TOGETHER AND DISCUSS

226
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:35,968
A REASONABLE SOLUTION
TO THIS PROBLEM, OKAY?

227
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:37,203
I LOOK REASONABLE TO YOU,
MOTHERFUCKER?

228
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:38,437
HEY, I GOT NO DOG
IN THIS FIGHT.

229
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,339
THEN STOP FUCKING
LAWYERING ME!

230
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:43,642
ALL RIGHT.
YOU FIGURE IT OUT, COOL.

231
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:47,413
SOMEBODY HAS
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

232
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:49,581
CAN WE JUST PLEASE
TALK ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

233
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:52,251
YEAH, LET'S DISCUSS HOW YOU
LOCKED THE FUCKING DOOR ON US.

234
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:54,186
WE'RE DOWN HERE BECAUSE ALL
THE OTHER FLOORS WERE LOCKED.

235
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,387
YEAH.

236
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:59,191
HOW DID YOU
GET ONTO THE STAIRS?

237
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:04,130
WHY WERE YOU
IN THE STAIRWELL?

238
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,332
NOW THERE'S A GIRL
YOU DON'T MEET EVERY DAY.

239
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,567
VERY FUCKING HIGH CLASS.

240
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,502
- SHUT UP.
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE A LAWYER.

241
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:11,637
SAME FUCKING DIFFERENCE.

242
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,305
NO, I NEVER SAID
I WAS A LAWYER,

243
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,506
AND WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHAT I DO ANYWAY?

244
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,175
ALL THE OTHER FLOORS
WERE LOCKED?

245
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,543
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU, YEAH.

246
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:19,078
THAT'S GOOD THEN.

247
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:20,346
THAT MEANS THERE COULD BE OTHERS
ON THE STAIRS.

248
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:22,014
GETTING THEIR OWN
FUCKING BLOW JOBS.

249
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:25,151
HEY, OLD LADY'S
IN TROUBLE OVER THERE.

250
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:36,162
MA'AM?
MA'AM, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

251
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:37,563
OH, MY GOD.

252
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:40,699
MA'AM? MA'AM, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
MA'AM?

253
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:42,034
LET ME GET IN THERE.
LET ME GET IN THERE.

254
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:43,035
OKAY.

255
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:44,136
MA'AM.

256
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,437
LISTEN TO ME, LISTEN TO ME.

257
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:47,239
- MA'AM.
- LOOKS LIKE SHE'S DYING.

258
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:48,540
MA'AM, YOU SAID
YOU HAD A CONDITION.

259
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:51,143
CAN YOU INDICATE THAT?

260
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:53,679
MAYBE SHE'S HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

261
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:55,481
I'VE GOT AN AED IN MY CAR.

262
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:58,750
CHECK IN HER BAG IF SHE'S GOT
A PRESCRIPTION OR ANYTHING.

263
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:00,719
MAYBE SHE'S DIABETIC.

264
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:03,089
I GOT AN AUNTIE IN TALLAHASSEE
WHO'S A DIABETIC.

265
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:05,057
- SHE COULD BE IN INSULIN SHOCK.
- NO, YOU GOTTA GIVE HER SUGAR.

266
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,193
- BLEEDING SUGAR.
- JUST, LIKE, CANDY OR GUM

267
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:09,161
- OR SOMETHING, ANYTHING.
- HERE, SUGAR.

268
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:11,063
- SHE'S TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING.
- WHAT DO I DO? WHAT DO I DO?

269
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:12,398
UH, PUT IT ON HER TONGUE.

270
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:14,400
- LET ME GET IN THERE.
- OKAY.

271
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:17,703
HOLD HER HEAD.

272
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:19,171
MOVE ASIDE.

273
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:24,810
SEE, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

274
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:28,214
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I DON'T EAT.

275
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:29,615
ARE YOU GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT NOW?

276
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:32,251
UH, THERE'S SOME CHEESE
AND CRACKERS

277
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:34,486
IN MY CAR FROM THE AIRLINE.

278
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,623
THE KEYS ARE IN MY PURSE.

279
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:43,795
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT BLACK MAN?

280
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:59,745
I COULD HAVE JUST SHOT YOU
IN THE BACK.

281
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,681
THERE ARE COPS
OUT ON THE STREET, D.

282
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:05,151
HOW FAR DO YOU THINK YOU'LL GET
RUNNING AROUND WITH A SHOTGUN?

283
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:07,853
I AIN'T JUST
DOING THIS FOR ME.

284
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,255
I'M WORKING
TO SPRING ALL Y'ALL.

285
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:11,190
WE DON'T NEED YOUR HELP, D.

286
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:13,659
BUT YOU DO NEED
MY COOPERATION.

287
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:18,597
NOW WHAT DOES
THAT ALARM MEAN?

288
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,299
I THINK THE BUILDING
COULD BE ON FIRE.

289
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:22,701
WHAT?
GET AFTER IT, MAN.

290
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:23,869
CRANK UP THAT GATE.

291
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:27,439
WELL, BE MY GUEST,
BEVERLY HILLS.

00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:30,209
ALL RIGHT, ONE OF YOU,
GO HELP HIM.

00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,581

00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:42,821
COME ON.

00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:08,214
NO, COME ON.
WE NEED YOUR HELP!

298
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:10,249

300
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,487
YEAH,

301
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:17,889
DON'T NEED
Y'ALL'S FUCKING ADVICE.

302
00:17:17,923 --> 00:17:21,793
MOVE, FUCK IT. JUST MOVE.

303
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:29,935
NOW YOU BE THINKING REAL HARD
ABOUT SHOOTING AN UNARMED MAN.

304
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:31,937
YOU PUT A GUN
TO A WOMAN'S HEAD,

305
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,805
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO?

306
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,409
I LET THE FOREIGN CHICK GO,

307
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:38,877

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,581
LET'S GET THE FUCK OUT

00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:50,956
FUCK.

310
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:03,269
INNOCENT MAN,
WRONGLY ACCUSED.

311
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:07,839
ALL RIGHT, YOUR TURN.

312
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:10,309

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

316
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:34,700
I THINK SO, BUT IT HURTS.

317
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:37,803
OH, GREAT, NOW WE'RE REALLY

00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:46,845

322
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:51,983
WHERE ARE MY CHEESE

323
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:24,516

00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:03,622
A MAN IS DYING.

JUST OVER THERE
WITH A GROUP OF OTHER PEOPLE.

334
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:23,074
- A POLICE OFFICER? IS HE HURT?

335
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:25,444
BUT SHE NEEDS YOUR ASSISTANCE.

339
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,382
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,783
NOBODY KNOWS
HOW MANY ARE AFFECTED

341
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:33,752
OR HOW WIDESPREAD
THIS WHOLE MESS IS.

342
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,931
I NEED TO GET WORD

343
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:47,499
TO MY HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER
IN NEW YORK.

344
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,167
FORGET IT, LADY.
POWER'S OUT.

345
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,769
THE CITY'S IN GRIDLOCK.

346
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:53,004
WE HAVEN'T HAD COMMUNICATION
SINCE YESTERDAY.

347
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,507
YESTERDAY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

348
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:19,831
GO, GO, GO!

349
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:34,105
STAY TOGETHER!

350
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:51,623
- MOMMY!
- MOMMY!

351
00:22:51,657 --> 00:22:54,526
MOMMY!

352
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,863
- MOM!
- MOMMY, HELP ME.

353
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:05,163
I NEED TO GET
UP TO MY ROOM.

354
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:06,331
- NOBODY'S ALLOWED UPSTAIRS.
- OUT OF MY WAY.

355
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:07,933
BUT I'VE GOT TO GET UP THERE.

356
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,067
I'M SORRY,
BUT IT'S FOR SECURITY.

357
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,003
UM, WHO DO I TALK TO?

358
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:14,706
YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM.

359
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,908
I'VE GOT CASH.
I CAN PAY YOU.

360
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:27,318
- COME ON.
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING?

361
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:30,689
END OF THE WORLD,
FOR ALL I KNOW.

362
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:04,322
MERDE, MERDE, MERDE!

363
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:06,624
DAMN IT.

364
00:25:19,938 --> 00:25:21,873
COME WITH ME.

365
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:25,276
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE MONEY BACK.

366
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,379
- BE QUIET AND KEEP MOVING.
- YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THAT?

367
00:25:28,413 --> 00:25:30,048
I'M TRAINED,
AND I'M DEADLY.

368
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:34,085
'CAUSE I DON'T
WANT AN ACCIDENT.

369
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,987
HERE.

370
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:38,389
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- OPEN IT.

371
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:39,825
THERE'S NO POWER
TO THE LOCKS.

372
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:41,059
KICK IT IN.

373
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:43,995
WELL, YOU GOT
REAL BALLS, BITCH.

374
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:47,833
YOU'D BETTER FUCKING
BELIEVE I DO.

375
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:52,430
OUT OF MY WAY.

376
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:00,405
MS. GENEREAU,
MS. GENEREAU.

377
00:27:00,438 --> 00:27:02,373
OVER HERE.

378
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:04,442
HURRY UP.
THERE'S STILL ROOM.

379
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:05,777
THEY SAID THE AIRPORT IS OPEN

380
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:07,245
AND THAT FLIGHTS
ARE STILL LEAVING.

381
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:08,947
- THEY SAID THAT? WHO SAID THAT?
- THE BUS DRIVER.

382
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,082
HE THINKS HE CAN GET THERE
BY TAKING THE BACK ROADS.

383
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:14,920
COME ON,
HE'S GOT ONE SEAT OPEN.

384
00:27:14,953 --> 00:27:16,988
COME ON.

385
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:29,868
HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

386
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:34,272
- SIR, DO YOU HEAR ME?
- YEAH, I FUCKING HEAR YOU.

387
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:36,307
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

388
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:40,011
FUCKING PUT A BULLET
IN MY HEAD.

389
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:43,081
AND THEN PUT ONE
IN THAT FUCKER D'S.

390
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,257
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

391
00:27:57,328 --> 00:28:01,099
THIS IS ABSOLUTE MADNESS!

392
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:04,302
THEY'VE BEEN GONE
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

393
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,306
- WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.
- THANK GOD.

394
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:12,143
GIRL'S THINKING ON HER FEET.
FIRST DRINK'S ON ME, DEAR.

395
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,187
THERE IT IS AGAIN.

396
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,293
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

397
00:28:28,326 --> 00:28:30,061
YOU WANNA DIE DOWN HERE?

398
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:32,463
COME ON.

399
00:28:32,497 --> 00:28:33,631
LOOK.

400
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,000
ON THREE.
ONE...

401
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:38,103
TWO...

402
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:42,273
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

403
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:00,992
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

404
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:04,029
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO YOU?

405
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:07,365
COME ON. SPIT IT OUT.

406
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:08,967
WHAT IS IT?

407
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,135
YOU DON'T WANNA LEAVE HERE.

408
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:12,470
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

409
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:15,440
THERE IS NO POWER,
NO NOTHING.

410
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:17,342
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
IS HAPPENING.

411
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,644
- THEN I HAVE TO GET OUT THERE.
- NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

412
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:21,579
THE POLICE
HAVE LOST ALL CONTROL.

413
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:33,524
OH, YOU CAN ALWAYS
COUNT ON A FIREMAN.

414
00:29:41,132 --> 00:29:43,434
THAT'S NO FUCKING FIREMAN.

415
00:29:45,236 --> 00:29:47,072
FIGURED Y'ALL
WOULD STILL BE HERE.

416
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:48,373
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT TRUCK?

417
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:50,175
IT'S A RESCUE VEHICLE,
AIN'T IT?

418
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,044
LOOK LIKE
Y'ALL NEED RESCUING.

419
00:29:59,184 --> 00:30:03,021
NOW WE'RE GETTING SERIOUS.

420
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:07,492
HOW Y'ALL LIKE IT
BEHIND BARS?

421
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,341
THIS LOOKS
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE.

422
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:25,376
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I TOLD MYSELF THIS MORNING,

423
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,711
BUT HERE I FUCKING AM.

424
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:30,315
WHY DID YOU
COME BACK FOR US?

425
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:34,485
BEEN CALLED A MONSTER
MY WHOLE LIFE.

426
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,688
WHY DID YOU COME BACK?

427
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:40,558
- I PROMISED THOSE PEOPLE.
- YEAH?

428
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:44,529
THEN WE'RE BOTH
FUCKING STUPID.

429
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,765
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

430
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:51,136
FUCKING OPEN THE DOOR.

431
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:05,116
SHIT, SHIT, SHIT.

432
00:31:06,217 --> 00:31:07,352
YOU OKAY, DUDE?

433
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:10,121
- YOU OKAY?
- YES.

434
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:12,623
GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY.

435
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:16,127
- YOU OKAY? HERE YOU GO.
- WHOA, ALL RIGHT.

436
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:18,463
YOU'RE NO FUCKING FIREMAN!

437
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:22,200
HE FUCKING HIJACKED
THIS TRUCK.

438
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:23,534
COME ON, YOU BITCH!

439
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:25,570
- CAN WE GET OUT?
- STAY IN THE FUCKING CAR.

440
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:27,705
HEY, HEY!

441
00:31:27,738 --> 00:31:30,408
MOVE THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY.

442
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:31,409
WHOSE FUCKING IDEA WAS THIS?

443
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:34,145
EASY!

444
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:36,181
- MOVE!
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

445
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:38,516
THEY'RE TRYING TO ROLL US.

446
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,353
I THINK THEY WANT TO KILL US.

447
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:44,522
MOVE RIGHT NOW!

448
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:45,723
STOP! HEY!

449
00:31:45,756 --> 00:31:47,358
GO, GO, GO!

450
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:22,460
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

451
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:24,862
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

452
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:29,167
HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!

453
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,750
ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT, EASY!

454
00:32:45,783 --> 00:32:48,153
JESUS.

455
00:32:48,186 --> 00:32:51,222
AH, WORSE THAN
A FUCKING PLANE CRASH.

456
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:53,324
AT LEAST
YOU CRASH-LANDED IN BEL AIR.

457
00:32:53,358 --> 00:32:55,226
THIS IS
WHERE THE OLD LADY LIVES?

458
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,428
I JUST HAD
THESE GATES FIXED.

459
00:32:57,462 --> 00:33:00,898
GRACIELA,
CAN YOU OPEN THE GATE?

460
00:33:00,931 --> 00:33:03,168
GRACIELA, I'M HOME, HONEY.

461
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:05,336
WHO'S GRACIELA?
IS THAT YOUR DAUGHTER?

462
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,738
SHE'S MY HOUSEKEEPER,
GRACIELA,

463
00:33:07,772 --> 00:33:10,241
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING ME.

464
00:33:10,275 --> 00:33:12,610
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
BECAUSE SHE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

465
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:14,345
THE POWER'S OUT.

466
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:16,481
MAYBE WE COULD
JUST CLIMB OVER.

467
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:18,283
IF SHE HAD A BLEEDING BAR,
WE COULD.

468
00:33:18,316 --> 00:33:19,850
I KNEW
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

469
00:33:19,884 --> 00:33:21,319
WE SHOULD HAVE JUST GONE
TO THE STATION.

470
00:33:21,352 --> 00:33:22,653
WHAT WE SHOULD
HAVE DONE IS GONE HOME,

471
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:24,255
BUT YOU SAW THE SITUATION
OUT THERE, RIGHT?

472
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:25,823
SHE SAYS
SHE HAS FOOD FOR US HERE.

473
00:33:25,856 --> 00:33:27,458
DINING IN THE FUCKING DARK,
SO...

474
00:33:27,492 --> 00:33:28,559
HEY, Y'ALL,
WE NEED A PLACE TO SLEEP.

475
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:30,361
OKAY, EVERYONE JUST STOP,

476
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:31,662
- AND LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT.
- JUST STOP?

477
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:33,431
YOU'RE AN OFFICER.
YOU HAVEN'T...

478
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:34,532
- IS THAT THE BEST YOU GOT?
- THAT'S YOUR PLAN?

479
00:33:40,738 --> 00:33:43,508
EVERYONE GET OUT OF THE WAY!

480
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:52,350
PFFT!

481
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:38,596
GRACIELA,

482
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:42,500
I'M HOME, DEAR.

483
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:43,934
WOW.

484
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:49,774
YOU LIVE HERE
ALL BY YOURSELF?

485
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:52,477
WITH GRACIELA,
WHEREVER SHE IS.

486
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,580
FUCKING DIED
AND WENT TO HEAVEN.

487
00:34:55,613 --> 00:34:59,350
THIS HOUSE MUST
BE WORTH A FORTUNE.

488
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:02,620
IT'S WORTH 100 MILLION
IF IT'S WORTH A PENNY.

489
00:35:02,653 --> 00:35:05,623
WHO MAKES $100 MILLION?

490
00:35:05,656 --> 00:35:07,458
NOT ALL THE CLOWNS
IN THE WORLD.

491
00:35:07,492 --> 00:35:11,696
EXCUSE ME.
I'D LIKE TO TRY THE TELEPHONE.

492
00:35:11,729 --> 00:35:14,699
WELL, THERE'S ONE
IN THE KITCHEN.

493
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:17,568
HI, MOM.

494
00:35:17,602 --> 00:35:20,305
GIVE ME A KISS
TO THE CAMERA.

495
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:21,972
- MWAH.
- OH!

496
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:24,842
- SEAFOOD, LOOK AT THAT.
- AND TO DADDY TOO?

497
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,611
- A KISS.
- LOOK AT DADDY. NO?

498
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:29,680
NO? JUST MOMMY.
YOU PREFER MOMMY, RIGHT?

499
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,720
SHY IN FRONT
OF THE CAMERA.

500
00:35:35,753 --> 00:35:37,988
ANY LUCK WITH THE PHONE?

501
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:40,891
THERE WASN'T EVEN
A DIAL TONE.

502
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:42,393
HMM.

503
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:45,730
THIS FOOD'S GONNA SPOIL.

504
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:48,366
DO YOU KNOW
THERE IS NO WATER?

505
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:54,972
I THINK
THE SHIT HAS HIT THE FAN.

506
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:56,407
YOU'RE NOT SAYING
THIS IS SOME KIND

507
00:35:56,441 --> 00:35:58,075
OF TERRORIST ATTACK
OR SOMETHING.

508
00:35:58,108 --> 00:36:01,011
I WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE
THEIR HANDS ON THE HOT BUTTONS,

509
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:02,847
PEOPLE WHO WORK
AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS.

510
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,015
AND THEY ALL ASSURE ME IT'S NOT
A MATTER OF "IF," YOU KNOW,

511
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:06,984
BUT "WHEN."

512
00:36:14,692 --> 00:36:17,662
* OUT CAME THE SUN
AND DRIED... *

513
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:21,866
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

514
00:36:21,899 --> 00:36:24,902
ME NEITHER.
CAVIAR.

515
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,052
OH.

516
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:47,091
I'M GONNA FUCKING MARRY
THIS WOMAN.

517
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,762
GRACIELA?

518
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:54,098
GRACIELA? HONEY?

519
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:01,539
GRACIELA?

520
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,141
GRACIELA?

521
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:07,044
WHERE ARE YOU...

522
00:37:07,077 --> 00:37:10,481
OH, THERE'S A STRANGE MAN
IN THE HOUSE!

523
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:11,749
IT'S OKAY,
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED.

524
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:13,384
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

525
00:37:13,418 --> 00:37:15,119
IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.

526
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:17,588
- WHAT DID YOU DO WITH GRACIELA?
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH HER.

527
00:37:17,622 --> 00:37:19,123
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY HOUSE?

528
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:23,594
NOTHING.
I CAME HERE WITH YOU?

529
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:25,463
IT'S ME, DAVID.

530
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,432
THE CLOWN.

531
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:36,507
YOU PEOPLE
ARE TRYING TO KILL ME.

532
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:50,521
HOW MUCH
THAT FUCKING SET YOU BACK?

533
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,022
I JUST PAY
HER HEALTH INSURANCE.

534
00:37:52,056 --> 00:37:54,659
YOU'RE FUCKING SHITTING ME,
RIGHT?

535
00:37:54,692 --> 00:37:57,795
HER COBRA PLAN WAS,
LIKE, A GRAND A MONTH.

536
00:37:57,828 --> 00:37:59,697
I FIGURE IT'S A WIN-WIN.

537
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,066
OBAMACARE COVER THAT?

538
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,534
IT BETTER,

539
00:38:03,568 --> 00:38:06,103
OR SHE'S SHIT OUT OF LUCK.

540
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:13,043
I TELL YA, I GOT
A FUCKING COBRA PLAN FOR HER.

541
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:39,036
YA MIND IF I MIXED IN?

542
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:40,705
I WAS JUST GETTING OUT,
ACTUALLY.

543
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:43,574
AH, RIGHT.

544
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,745
THEN MAY I ASSIST YOU
WITH YOUR CAPE?

545
00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:02,793
WE'RE REALLY NO DIFFERENT,
ARE WE,

546
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:05,530
THAN THIS HELPLESS LITTLE BEE?

547
00:39:05,563 --> 00:39:08,999
WE GOT THE MILK
OF HUMAN KINDNESS.

548
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:14,672
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY
FRIGHTENED ABOUT ALL THIS.

549
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:18,042
ALLOW THE SHELTER
OF MY ARMS.

550
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:21,011
HOW WILL WE PAY
FOR OUR SINS?

551
00:39:23,247 --> 00:39:25,282
AS PART OF THE HEALTH PLAN?

552
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:27,852
THE BOOK OF REVELATION?

553
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:30,955
HAVE YOU EVER READ IT?

554
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:33,524
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER
REALLY READ IT?

555
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:35,159
YOU SPEAKING OF THE BIBLE?

556
00:39:35,192 --> 00:39:37,995
MAYBE THAT
EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.

557
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:39,530
WHAT IT IS JOHN SAW

558
00:39:39,564 --> 00:39:42,900
ABOUT THE SERPENT
AND WHO THE PROSTITUTE IS.

559
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:47,171
I PREFER "ESCORT"
OR "FILLE DE JOIE."

560
00:39:57,682 --> 00:40:01,185
OR MOGGY FUCKING
SKANKY WHORE.

561
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:11,562
PUT DOWN THE SHOTGUN
AND EAT, D,

562
00:40:11,596 --> 00:40:14,264
OR IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG NIGHT.

563
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:17,101
WHAT, ARE WE BEST FRIENDS NOW
OR SOMETHING?

564
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:19,904
HMM?

565
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:21,939
COP SHOOTS A NIGGA
EVERY 28 HOURS.

566
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:23,741
DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHAT DAY IT IS?

567
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:28,045
THE DATE...
IT'S WEDNESDAY THE 28TH.

568
00:40:28,078 --> 00:40:30,881
BUT I WAS TOLD WE HAVEN'T HAD
COMMUNICATION FOR A WHOLE DAY.

569
00:40:30,915 --> 00:40:35,185
WHY WOULD THEY
SAY SUCH A THING?

570
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:39,657
- WELL, THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.
- WHAT... WHAT IS REALLY WEIRD?

571
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,159
THE OLD LADY AND I
SHARE A BIRTHDAY, MARCH THE 7TH.

572
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:45,896
MARCH THE 7TH?
THAT'S... THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

573
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,131
GET OUT.
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

574
00:40:47,164 --> 00:40:49,900
THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY TOO.

575
00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:53,103
WHEN'S YOUR BIRTHDAY?

576
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:57,107
MY BIRTHDAY?
MARCH 7TH, WHY?

577
00:40:57,141 --> 00:40:59,810
- WHO IS HE? WHO ARE YOU?
- HE'S THE FUCKING CLOWN.

578
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:00,978
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE'S THE CLOWN?

579
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:04,314
WHO WEARS PANTS LIKE THAT?

580
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:06,784
WHEN'S YOUR BIRTHDAY, CLOWN?

581
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:09,920
IT'S DAVID.
IT'S MARCH 7TH.

582
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:12,890
MARCH 7TH?
THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

583
00:41:12,923 --> 00:41:15,125
MARCH 7TH IS MY BIRTHDAY.

584
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:17,394
MARCH 7TH
IS EVERYONE'S BIRTHDAY.

585
00:41:17,427 --> 00:41:19,296
WHAT ARE YOU
POINTING THAT AT ME FOR?

586
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:21,899
WE'D LIKE TO KNOW
YOUR BIRTHDAY.

587
00:41:21,932 --> 00:41:23,267
NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.

588
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,670
HE'S BEEN DRINKING.
HE'S DRUNK.

589
00:41:25,703 --> 00:41:27,638
- HE WAS DRUNK ON THE ELEVATOR.
- SO?

590
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:29,807
IS THAT A FUCKING CRIME?

591
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,342
IT'S A MISDEMEANOR,
ACTUALLY.

592
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:39,116
NOT IN MY FUCKING COUNTRY,
IT AIN'T.

593
00:41:42,687 --> 00:41:45,055
WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?
IN AMERICA?

594
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:48,726
- I DON'T WORK A FUCKING CIRCUS.
- I DO PRIVATE BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

595
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,194
SO DOES SHE,
I FUCKING BETCHA.

596
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:52,763
HEY, THERE'S NO NEED
TO INSULT HER, OKAY?

597
00:41:52,797 --> 00:41:55,766
OR WHAT?
WANNA FUCKING FIGHT?

598
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,136
IT'S BEEN A LONG, STRANGE DAY.
TEMPERS ARE A LITTLE SHORT HERE.

599
00:41:59,169 --> 00:42:00,304
AND WHY MUST EVERYTHING BE

600
00:42:00,337 --> 00:42:02,106
"FUCK YOU, FUCK THIS,
FUCK THAT"?

601
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:03,774
IT'S A MANNER
OF FUCKING SPEAKING.

602
00:42:03,808 --> 00:42:07,277
"IT'S A MANNER
OF FUCKING SPEAKING."

603
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:08,679
DO YOU EVEN HAVE ANY FRIENDS?

604
00:42:08,713 --> 00:42:10,314
IN HIGH FUCKING PLACES,
YA TWINK.

605
00:42:10,347 --> 00:42:11,816
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW
I'M GAY?

606
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:15,052
YOU'RE GAY
AS FUCKING CHRISTMAS.

607
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:17,287
YOU ARE JUST
A HATEFUL HUMAN BEING.

608
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:19,423
IT'S THEM FUCKING PARADES
I HATE.

609
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:22,292
YOU KNOW, HATE SPEECH
IN ITSELF IS A CRIME.

610
00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:23,393
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

611
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:25,029
FUCKING MURDERER
STANDING THERE,

612
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:26,997
YET I'M THE FUCKING CRIMINAL.

613
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:28,432
I'D WATCH YOURSELF THERE,
IRELAND.

614
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:31,001
YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW,

615
00:42:31,035 --> 00:42:34,038
WHAT'S IT FUCKING LIKE
TO KILL SOMEONE?

616
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:35,205
YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW?

617
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,741
DON'T PRETEND YOU HAVEN'T

618
00:42:36,774 --> 00:42:37,942
FUCKING THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
MADEMOISELLE.

619
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:39,243
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT ONCE.

620
00:42:39,276 --> 00:42:41,245
AW, I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT PLENTY.

621
00:42:41,278 --> 00:42:42,713
I'M THINKING
ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

622
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:44,148
SO WHAT'S
THE FUCKING ANSWER?

623
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:46,050
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE FUCKING ANSWER IS.

624
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,952
I'VE NEVER KILLED ANYBODY
MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE.

625
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,453
TWO FOUL MOUTHS
IN MY HOUSE.

626
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:51,121
WELL, THEN WHY'D
THEY PUT YOU IN PRISON?

627
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:52,356
'CAUSE I'M A BLACK MAN.

628
00:42:52,389 --> 00:42:54,024
AND THE PRISON
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

629
00:42:54,058 --> 00:42:55,760
NEEDS BLACK MEN
TO FEED YOUR SYSTEM.

630
00:42:55,793 --> 00:42:57,094
THERE'S MORE NIGGAS
IN PRISON TODAY

631
00:42:57,127 --> 00:42:59,329
THAN THERE WERE SLAVES
IN THE CIVIL WAR.

632
00:42:59,363 --> 00:43:00,831
HOW LONG WERE YOU IN PRISON?

633
00:43:00,865 --> 00:43:03,968
I'VE BEEN INCARCERATED
13 GODDAMN YEARS.

634
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,402
YOU EVER TAKE ONE
FOR THE HOME TEAM?

635
00:43:05,435 --> 00:43:07,204
FUCK YOU,
MOTHERFUCKING SHAMROCK.

636
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:09,039
UP THE QUEEN'S BRIDAL PATH.

637
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:10,440
AREN'T YOU AFRAID
THAT HE'S GONNA SHOOT YOU?

638
00:43:10,474 --> 00:43:11,942
OKAY, OKAY,
WE'RE GONNA SHUT THIS DOWN.

639
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:14,211
SAYS HE'S NEVER
KILLED ANYBODY.

640
00:43:14,244 --> 00:43:16,513
I TAKE THE MAN
AT HIS FUCKING WORD.

641
00:43:16,546 --> 00:43:18,949
OH, I DIDN'T SAY
I NEVER SHOT A MAN.

642
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:22,019
I'M OUT OF HERE.

643
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:23,921
THAT THE WAY
THEY DO IT IN PRISON?

644
00:43:23,954 --> 00:43:25,455
YEAH.

645
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:29,994
FIGHT LIKE A FUCKING MAN,
YA LEPRE-COON.

646
00:43:35,966 --> 00:43:39,103
FIGHT LIKE A MAN, HUH?
FIGHT LIKE A MAN?

647
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:41,305
STOP IT! STOP IT!

648
00:43:42,439 --> 00:43:44,875
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
- COME ON!

649
00:43:44,909 --> 00:43:46,811
STOP IT, STOP IT!

650
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:49,079
JUST STOP IT!

651
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:52,449
I'M TIRED OF THIS.
I'M SICK OF IT.

652
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:56,153
DON'T ANY OF YOU
HAVE FAMILIES AT ALL

653
00:43:56,186 --> 00:43:58,889
THAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT?

654
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:04,094
WELL, IF YOU DON'T, I DO.

655
00:44:04,128 --> 00:44:06,130
I JUST WANT THIS
TO BE OVER.

656
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:10,367
I WANT TO KNOW MY HUSBAND
AND DAUGHTER ARE SAFE.

657
00:44:13,203 --> 00:44:16,240
I JUST WANNA GO.

658
00:44:18,876 --> 00:44:22,146
SOMEONE'S COMING.
MAYBE IT'S HELP.

659
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:47,371
OH,
THAT'S GRACIELA'S LITTLE CAR.

660
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:53,343
WHO THE FUCK
ARE THESE GUYS?

661
00:44:53,377 --> 00:44:55,312
ANYBODY MOVES,
AND YOU'RE DEAD.

662
00:44:55,345 --> 00:44:58,115
STOP!
I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

663
00:44:58,148 --> 00:45:00,150
I AM ARMED,
AND I WILL SHOOT YOU.

664
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:01,952
<i>OH,
LOOK AT THE CHICA FUERTE.</i>

665
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:17,167
WE DON'T NEED
NO UNNECESSARY VIOLENCE.

666
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,974
<i>MUJER, SOMEONE WANNA TALK
WITH YOU.</i>

667
00:45:24,008 --> 00:45:27,577
GRACIELA,
COME TALK TO FRANCIS.

668
00:45:27,611 --> 00:45:32,382
OH!

669
00:45:35,052 --> 00:45:37,187
<i>LO SIENTO, FRANCIS.</i>

670
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:40,290
I DIDN'T WANT
TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE.

671
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:43,127
THEY MADE ME.

672
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,494
IT'S... IT'S ALL RIGHT,
GRACIELA.

673
00:45:49,299 --> 00:45:52,636
THEY WANT NUMBERS
TO THE SAFE.

674
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:55,605
PLEASE, I DON'T WANT THEM
TO HURT YOU.

675
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:57,908
I-I DON'T REMEMBER
THE COMBINATION.

676
00:45:57,942 --> 00:46:01,445
I DON'T EVEN... I-I HAVE IT
WRITTEN DOWN SOMEWHERE

677
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:03,147
IN THE... IN THE...
IN THE HOUSE.

678
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,249
WELL, THEN,
GO FIND IT FOR US, CHOCHA.

679
00:46:08,485 --> 00:46:10,654
GET IN THE HOUSE, NOW!

680
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,489
GO!

681
00:46:12,522 --> 00:46:14,291
GO, GO, GO!
WAIT UP!

682
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:21,598
KEEP GOING!
DON'T STOP!

683
00:46:24,668 --> 00:46:26,670
WAIT!

684
00:46:27,604 --> 00:46:29,339
WAIT!
