"Words from your lips
made her hips wanna roll

00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:04,474
"It's the Rap Crusader on stage,
they call me James

00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,362
"Playing games like Spades,
I'm on his cut like a Band-Aid

"Throw your hands in the air

00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:11,959
"Knock the mikes out real quick,

00:01:12,044 --> 00:01:14,478

00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:23,273
Check it out.

00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:32,002
Daddys little girl
Daddy's little girl

11
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:34,234
"Daddy.... Daddy's little girl.

12
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:36,042
"Are you Daddy's little girl?"

13
00:02:15,124 --> 00:02:16,239
Shit!

14
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,243
Any other needs, sir?

15
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:44,112
Let's see. Ladies, gentlemen,
John, would you like something?

16
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,200
I think we're fine, thank you.

17
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:49,162
Tell Cheryl that this is spectacular.
She's outdone herself.

18
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:50,996
-Just fabulous.
-Thank you.

19
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:52,483
All right, everybody.

20
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:56,762
Napkins, please, on the laps.
This is quail, and it tastes great.

21
00:02:56,924 --> 00:03:00,200
You're gonna love it.
The grapes look like flowers.

22
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:01,957
Everything's perfect.

23
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:03,437
And a terrific sauce.

24
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:06,283
Slice little pieces off
and then dip it in the sauce.

25
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:07,723
Hi, Katie.

26
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:10,673
Well, well, well. What an honour.

27
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:13,081
Only a half hour late.

28
00:03:13,404 --> 00:03:17,033
-May I ask where you've been, Charlie?
-Hi, Daddy. I've been at the liberry.

29
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:18,842
The "Iiberry"?

30
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:22,201
Is that any relation
to the institution known as a "Iibrary"?

31
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:24,679
Can't we have one dinner
where we don't argue?

32
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:26,561
I hope so. But I've told you.

33
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:30,677
If you must wear that ridiculous
gold tooth, do it outside, not in my house.

34
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:32,795
And take your jacket off, too.

35
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,559
What were you guys doing
before you decided...

36
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:44,158
...to become rap artists
and cut your first album?

37
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:47,077
What that got to do
with what we talking about?

38
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:50,201
I came here as a businessman,
coming to do business with you...

39
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:53,117
...and your establishment
and you're giving me the rundown...

40
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:55,559
...on this shit like you're the police.

41
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:58,317
Isn't this place a recording studio?

42
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,396
It is a recording studio.
I'm trying my best to accommodate you.

43
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:04,158
I'm a kid coming up out of the street, man.

44
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:09,718
Trying to do my thing, trying to get on.
Make music, live a better life.

45
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:12,315
-Graduating this year?
-I sure am.

46
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:16,522
God willing.
With a little luck and a few bribes.

47
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,879
Dad, why you always
gotta say shit like that?

48
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:20,761
Why can't you just be normal?

49
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,916
-Why do you have to be such a nut?
-A nut? Excuse me?

50
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:27,963
You don't see me coming in here
and talking about your problems.

51
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:31,432
You know? Why do you always
gotta fuck with me?

52
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:35,239
Rich is the guy behind the Cream Team,
is that correct?

53
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:37,514
Rich is the mind behind Cream Team.

54
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:39,834
-And his name is Rich--
-Rich Bower, yeah.

55
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:42,194
The guy meeting us here is Rich Bower?

56
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:43,837
Tell me what you heard.

57
00:04:43,924 --> 00:04:47,758
Just stories and gossip about some trouble
you guys might've been in.

58
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:51,354
That's in the past. This is the present.
What are we gonna do?

59
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:54,283
Actually, Cigar,
to be totally honest with you...

60
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:57,760
...l can't give you a firm answer now.
We're really jammed up.

61
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:00,722
-What's going on?
-You still negotiating, nigga?

62
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:04,433
-Thought we had a deal.
-This is the cat who owns the studio.

63
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:07,677
Arnie Tishman. Nice to meet you.
Feel free to look around.

64
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:10,483
By the way,
which library were you studying at?

65
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:13,118
-Surely you remember the name.
-I don't remember.

66
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:18,836
She was studying at a library an hour ago.
But ask her where and she can't remember.

67
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:21,643
What do you mean you can't take cash?
What's wrong?

68
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:23,601
-Money ain't green?
-Don't want cash?

69
00:05:23,684 --> 00:05:25,117
-You don't like me?
-No--

70
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:28,321
Cash is king! What's wrong with you?
You sound like you're mad.

71
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:32,882
You're acting like you're on drugs.
Drugs are bugging you out.

72
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:36,276
-Who's your lawyer?
-What do lawyers got to do with it?

73
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:39,913
You're the police or something?
We just want some studio time.

74
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:41,676
What you talking about my lawyer?

75
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:44,557
You don't treat me
like you do everyone else.

76
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,157
Don't start with comparisons.

77
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:48,474
-Katie's so perfect.
-Katie's nine years old.

78
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:52,273
But you think she's so perfect.
And I'm just a disgusting leech...

79
00:05:52,364 --> 00:05:55,515
...that you have.
With my friends, I don't feel that way.

80
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:59,319
I'm having a good day, hanging out
with my friends, going to the library...

81
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,718
...and you ruin it.

82
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:03,473
You have to cut your first album
somewhere else.

83
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,283
You'll use this studio in the future.

84
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:08,720
This is why people get hurt.

85
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:12,434
You make a person feel a certain way,
then you shut him down.

86
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:15,394
-Is that a threat?
-We don't make threats.

87
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:17,640
We said we'd be back. That's a promise.

88
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:22,554
There's a time and a place for this.
But I don't think that now is the right time.

89
00:06:22,644 --> 00:06:26,398
Let's just all sit here,
enjoy this quail and have a meal together.

90
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,641
-Hello.
-Hey, Charlie.

91
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:41,233
-Hold on, Wren.
-You lighting up?

92
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:44,155
-I missed you after school.
-Right.

93
00:06:44,444 --> 00:06:47,197
I listened to Rae pour out
all her boyfriend problems.

94
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,673
That's good for Rae.
I'm glad she's doing that.

95
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:51,834
-Do you love me?
-Of course I love you.

96
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:53,915
You do? I love you, too.

97
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:56,001
-Hello.
-What up, girl?

98
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,638
What's up, Rich? What you doing?

99
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:01,756
-I'm gonna call you back, okay?
-Wait a second, Charlie.

100
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:04,677
-Shut up. I'll call you back.
-Who are you talking to--

101
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:10,794
-What's up? What you doing?
-Just chilling.

102
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:13,034
-Did you have fun today?
-What can I say?

103
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:14,159
-It was nice, right?
-It was all right.

104
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:17,160
-I would go for it again.
-When?

105
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:19,479
-Whenever you're ready.
-Okay.

106
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:23,523
Let me get up.

107
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:26,717
I'm gonna go down there
and see what's going on.

108
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:34,599
The motherfucking D.A.'s son.

109
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:46,843
What the fuck aspect they get from
having this motherfucker working for me?

110
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:55,319
I gotta talk to you about some shit
we ain't talked about yet.

111
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:57,872
That some major shit that's going down.

112
00:07:58,004 --> 00:07:59,596
You gotta deal with it right away.

113
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:03,233
There's some disrespect going down
and you can't allow this to happen.

114
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:04,837
Just between you and me.

115
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:07,119
No, me and you
and everybody else in here.

116
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:10,361
I need to talk to you about some shit.

117
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:14,393
-I know Rich will slap the shit out of him.
-What about?

118
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:17,721
And his father's the fucking D.A.

119
00:08:19,284 --> 00:08:22,435
You can't be coming to my joint
blowing a spot like that.

120
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:26,039
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm doing this for you. Not for myself.

121
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:28,319
I work for you.
You know what I do with my life.

122
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:31,521
These guys open a club on your turf
without calling or asking you.

123
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:35,673
And no compensation. It's bullshit.

124
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:38,883
So you're gonna tell me
what's going on in my hood?

125
00:08:38,964 --> 00:08:42,513
I know these cats. Scotty, Eric
and all these other motherfuckers.

126
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:45,164
White cats that I know
that are opening up this club...

127
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:47,712
...in your hood with no calls, no nothing.

128
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:50,477
I don't think it makes sense.
What you gonna do?

129
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:54,239
What am I gonna do? What's your point?
You gather information, right?

130
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:58,238
Just keep the information coming in
and you'll see what I'm gonna do.

131
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:00,679
I understand. I overstand what I gotta do.

132
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:23,483
What's up?

133
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:26,036
-He wanna be a rapper.
-Yeah.

134
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:29,361
I was tellin' him
not everybody can be a rapper.

135
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:31,680
-You know what I'm saying?
-Yeah, no doubt.

136
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:35,719
-What's up?
-You all right?

137
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:37,522
What's going on, man?

138
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:40,437
What's up, Greta? What's going down?

139
00:09:40,564 --> 00:09:43,158
-This is a nice spot.
-You like it?

140
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:46,242
-Why don't we go look outside?
-Let me show you....

141
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:49,276
I ran into your man, Will,
on my way up, man.

142
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:51,879
He had a wild look in his eyes.

143
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:54,757
Looked like he had something on his mind.

144
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,519
-Just a white boy trying to be a nigga.
-Didn't even say, "What's up?" to me.

145
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:00,674
Fuck all that. How's your game going?

146
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:03,153
-Come see me play sometime.
-Guaranteed.

147
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:11,513
"Young people are always more given
to admiring what is wild...

148
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,714
"...than what is reasonable."
That is a quote from Delacroix.

149
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:18,916
I want to examine today, with you,
the question of identity.

150
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:22,321
Is culture involved
and is race a factor? Charlie?

151
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:25,794
I wanna be black.
I wanna get into the hip-hop thing.

152
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:28,842
Times are definitely different now
and things are different.

153
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:33,594
Obviously now you see
a lot of white kids...

154
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:38,600
...that admire and look up
to the black community...

155
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:40,761
...and hip-hop and rappers.

156
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:44,242
I think that people are struggling
with who they are.

157
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:47,441
That's a big thing.
And being a teenager is a transition...

158
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:49,560
...from being a kid to being an adult.

159
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:52,364
When you're an adult,
you have to know who you are.

160
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:55,682
What's not healthy about choosing a style?

161
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:58,358
You're saying I should treasure
my Russian heritage...

162
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:01,641
...and then get all caught up
in what's going on in Russia now?

163
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:03,954
I don't give a fuck! It'll never affect me!

164
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,834
You don't wanna be
what people expect of your race.

165
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:11,561
People say you're white,
you have to be this way.

166
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:16,161
You can't walk around and talk...

167
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:18,441
...Ebonics, you know...

168
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:20,560
...and they're saying....

169
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:26,120
Sometimes you just don't wanna be
what your race is supposed to be.

170
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:29,640
I'm like a little kid.
Little kids go through phases.

171
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:34,195
I like it now. I'll stand up for it
and say, "I'm into hip-hop."

172
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:36,884
But when it comes down to it,
I'll be over it soon.

173
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:39,603
But right now while I'm in school
and I've got comfort...

174
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:41,754
...and I'm okay and my friends are into it...

175
00:11:41,844 --> 00:11:44,881
...l can go hang out with them
and I can be a part of that.

176
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,677
I can do whatever I want.
I'm a kid, in America.

177
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:51,357
First of all, not everybody in here is white.

178
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:54,994
I'm from the hood, and I don't live there
anymore. I don't wanna go back.

179
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:58,121
I go there to visit some friends
and they're trying to get out.

180
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:01,082
They wanna go on to a college education.

181
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:04,561
They stay in school and get their grades
so they can get out.

182
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:06,794
And I have friends that do wanna rap.

183
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:09,762
And they rap about stuff so they
can get out of the hood.

184
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:12,432
We're trying to move up
and y'all trying to go down.

185
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,197
I wanna leave you with a quote
on the subject of identity.

186
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:18,833
It's from Shakespeare's Othello.
Iago, who has no identity, says:

187
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,720
"I am not what I am."

188
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:39,318
Excuse me, my name is Sam Doneger
and this is my husband Terry Doneger.

189
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:41,520
I am a freelance documentary filmmaker.

190
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:45,398
I'm doing a project on a phenomenon
that I've followed in America...

191
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:48,362
...of white high school kids
who imitate black hip-hop life.

192
00:12:48,444 --> 00:12:51,117
I would love to include you
in my documentary.

193
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,399
This is very important to me.
I have a vision.

194
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:55,714
I want it to be very real, raw and honest.

195
00:12:56,804 --> 00:13:00,080
-You think we fit this description?
-I think you do.

196
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:03,117
So you wanna know
why we call ourselves niggas?

197
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:06,873
You actually use the term "niggers"?
lsn't that a derogatory term?

198
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:12,403
"Nigger" is a derogatory term.
"Niggas" isn't.

199
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,040
"Niggas" is like, "These are my niggas."

200
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,675
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

201
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:19,880
We should introduce her to Will.

202
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:23,752
You gotta meet Will, his brother.
He's the true nigga.

203
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:27,276
This is my girl Kim, I'm Marty, that's Wren.

204
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:29,002
Raven and Wren's girl Charlie.

205
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm Sam, this is Terry...

206
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:34,154
...and include me in your day, all right?

207
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:37,999
-So you're gonna make us famous?
-Whatever I can do.

208
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,523
-Where'd you learn how to make movies?
-I went to NYU film school.

209
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:46,756
The 14th is no good.
We can do it on the....

210
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:50,116
Let's make it the 13th at 2:00.

211
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:52,642
Hold on one second.

212
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:55,316
-Arnie!
-I'll call you back.

213
00:13:55,444 --> 00:13:57,321
-How you doing?
-Good to see you.

214
00:13:57,564 --> 00:14:00,601
-I think you know Rich.
-Absolutely. We met yesterday.

215
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:02,640
And I believe you know Cigar.

216
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:06,634
And this is Dean. He's a point guard
on the Rider's basketball team.

217
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:09,113
I love watching
those smooth moves you got!

218
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:13,402
I suggest that you guys take a look
downstairs and get a run of the joint.

219
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:15,920
Steve and I will talk business up here.

220
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,757
-Friendly business.
-This is gonna be big for everybody.

221
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:22,560
It's a ball to see you, baby.
Have a seat right over here.

222
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:25,795
I'm so glad that you called
and we got this thing straightened out.

223
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:27,795
These white motherfuckers kill me!

224
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:32,042
Yesterday me and Gar come in here
by ourselves, no fucking deal.

225
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:35,197
Today we bring in another cracker
and it's all good.

226
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:39,757
-Could you explain this shit to me?
-That's just your reputation preceding you.

227
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:42,116
That's all gonna change now.

228
00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:45,355
What I cannot afford is a corpse
in my lobby.

229
00:14:45,604 --> 00:14:48,835
A Biggy Smalls, a Tupac,
a body in my elevator.

230
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:51,159
You know, that's not good for business.

231
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:53,603
What did you think about me
and Greta getting back?

232
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,118
Back and forth. It's your game, baby.

233
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:58,320
Do what you want.
Whatever turns you on.

234
00:14:58,404 --> 00:15:01,043
She's writing her
anthropology graduate thesis on race.

235
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:02,080
Good for her.

236
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:05,315
-I think we're gonna make it this time.
-Let me ask you a question:

237
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,123
What do you think these white people
really want from us?

238
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:11,241
You know. White motherfuckers
trying to imitate us...

239
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:14,122
...trying to rap, dress black
and all this shit.

240
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:17,435
Bitches throwing pussy all over.
What's going on with this shit?

241
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,437
A lot of people think it's like size.
The myth....

242
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:24,318
Niggas got bigger dicks and shit.
But I don't think that's it.

243
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:27,362
I think they think they're gonna
get some kind of life force...

244
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:29,196
...some shit from fucking with us.

245
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:31,957
Had some white chicks
in the park with me the other day.

246
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:34,604
Some preppy little chicks,
freaking them off.

247
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:39,201
Pops is an investment banker.
Central Park West living and all that.

248
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:43,401
I don't know what she thinks
she's gonna get from being around me.

249
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,716
I'm probably trying to get a little of her
information and see what I can do with it.

250
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:51,041
White people are as different
from each other as black people.

251
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:55,157
You can't lump them together like that.
The thing I got with Greta, it's different.

252
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:58,035
"The mind is a terrible thing to waste

253
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:01,396
"Especially smoked out,
puffin' that morphine base

254
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:03,395
"Prostitutes display the avenues

255
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:06,198
"Homicides searching for seed

256
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:11,276
"Cattle vans filled up with lifies,

257
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:12,683
"Equal long skids

00:16:12,924 --> 00:16:15,643
"Time to fix our position,

00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:32,722
"Ooh, coach saw him again"

265
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:35,438
-What up, kid? What's up, baby?
-Hi.

266
00:16:35,604 --> 00:16:37,640
-What's going on?
-How are you?

267
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:39,876
Sneaking up on us.

268
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:42,876
I'm not sneaking up on you.
I can't believe this is happening.

269
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:46,400
-We're gonna make hits, I'm telling you.
-Congratulations.

270
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:51,232
-Where's Rich?
-Rich is right up there talking to Dean.

271
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:58,000
They're not in jail. They're professionals
and they just want to work.

272
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,757
And I'd really appreciate
if we can work here with you.

273
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,915
-What's up?
-How are you?

274
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:08,515
This is like real shit!

275
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:11,158
Just trying to do my biz
and make a record.

276
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:13,793
-Are you proud of me, baby?
-Yes, I'm proud of you.

277
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:16,273
I just want you to know,
that I care about you a lot.

278
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:20,755
If you do feel like you're going
into a bad route....

279
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:23,517
If I do, I'm gonna come see you
and get my blessings.

280
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:25,083
Good, then you know.

281
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,723
Just keep them blessings
in your heart for me, that's all.

282
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:31,594
Four words: You've got a deal.

283
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:33,555
Thanks. All right, man.

284
00:17:33,644 --> 00:17:35,839
"The harder they come, the harder they get

285
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:39,314

"Filled with happiness,

Damn, life is just fucking crazy, man.

295
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:07,677
You could be living in heaven
and still living in hell.

296
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:10,722
I'd be thinking,
can you change who you are?

297
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,684
Do you love the Other,
more than you love yourself?.

298
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,915
Do you wish you were another way?

299
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:18,040
If you're black, can you bleach?

300
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:19,996
If you're white, can you dye?

301
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,439
Can you be ghetto
without living in the ghetto?

302
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:26,716
Do you look in the mirror and see your
face or do you close your eyes and dream?

303
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:28,078
What do you want?

304
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:30,798
Can you look within
and embrace your soul or not?

305
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:34,758
Can you change who you are?
You can look at me as long as you want...

306
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:37,153
...but I'll always be me
and you'll always be you.

307
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:41,753
I've got one for Kim.
She said something earlier about:

308
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:45,002
"I don't wanna eat dick tonight,
just eat my pussy right."

309
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,403
-Dirty mouth.
-Is that--

310
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:49,517
-You know that's Little Kim. It's a quote.
-She's a rapper.

311
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:52,112
But that's also Big Kim right here.

312
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:55,241
If you're making that assumption,
is it that you want to have...

313
00:18:55,324 --> 00:18:58,236
...a girl eating your pussy
or you don't want dick that night?

314
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:01,680
I'm just saying that guys for so long
have been taking what they want...

315
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:05,552
...getting their come on.
It's time girls fucking get their come on.

316
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:09,357
What about you guys?

317
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:11,919
Your husband's obviously gay.
What's that about?

318
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:13,722
Love. That's what it's about.

319
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:16,517
My husband is a very sensitive
and complex person...

320
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:19,118
...and we're crazy about each other.
Right, darling?

321
00:19:19,204 --> 00:19:21,957
Absolutely, my angel.
I have a question for everyone.

322
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:24,439
Origin of the word "fuck." Who knows it?

323
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:28,483
What's the origin of the word "fuck?"
Tell them the origin of the word.

324
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:33,882
17th century, Charles l:
"Fornication under consent of the king."

325
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:38,434
Tell me what they can offer you.
What do they offer you?

326
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:40,594
Why do you wanna be involved in it?

327
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:43,039
-It's like safety.
-Safety from what?

328
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:46,156
Safety from anyone
who wants to fuck with us.

329
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:56,677
Hi. I'm Mark Clear.

330
00:19:57,484 --> 00:19:59,440
How are you doing, Mark?

331
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:01,800
-You're Dean.
-That's me.

332
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:07,241
-You're the point guard on the Rider team.
-Yeah, man. Good luck.

333
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:09,241
Good luck with what?
What does that mean?

334
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:11,474
That's my way of saying see you later.

335
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,795
Really? That's too bad 'cause...

336
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:17,324
...l had something
I wanted to talk to you about.

337
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,083
What's that?

338
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:23,277
I was just wondering if you wanted
to make $50,000. $10,000 up front.

339
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:26,640
-Are you a quiz show host or something?
-No. I'm your future.

340
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:30,080
I think you got the wrong guy.

341
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:33,401
So some rinky-dink basketball game
that nobody gives a shit...

342
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,163
...what the score is tomorrow is more
important to you...

343
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:39,236
...than making $50,000 in cash?

344
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:43,156
-I'm starting to think you're serious.
-I'm totally serious.

345
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:47,234
I don't know about this.
This is criminal stuff.

346
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:49,959
In what way, though?
It's a crime against...

347
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:53,395
...the federal government.
It's not a crime against some old woman.

348
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:56,044
You're not hurting anybody.
Only the Federal Government.

349
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:57,762
Do you care about them? I don't.

350
00:20:57,844 --> 00:21:00,563
What have they done for you?
They haven't done much for me.

351
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:03,556
-You haven't been drafted yet, have you?
-No.

352
00:21:03,724 --> 00:21:05,601
What happens after you graduate?

353
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:08,801
I got more interesting things
going on than throwing a game.

354
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:11,239
If you don't want it, don't take it.

355
00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:13,519
-What if I turned you in right now?
-Turned me in?

356
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:15,556
I don't think you'd turn me in.

357
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:19,804
Would this be the worst thing
you ever did in your life?

358
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:22,643
What? A few bad passes,
a few missed lay-ups.

359
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:25,277
Who the hell would ever know?

360
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:27,355
-What's in it for you?
-Don't worry about me.

361
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:28,877
I'll bet what I want on the game.

362
00:21:28,964 --> 00:21:32,115
I'm gonna make more money than you will.
Think about it.

363
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:35,640
Tomorrow if you're around at noon,
Time Café downtown?

364
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:37,194
Okay.

365
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:43,478
900 words? No way.

366
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:46,801
I need at least 1,800.
This is a major article I'm writing.

367
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:49,718
Look who's sitting there.
District Attorney King.

368
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:53,238
You boys were playing football.
What's the verdict?

369
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:55,201
He's got good hands.

370
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,792
Runs in the family.

371
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:06,243
Billy, an odd-looking guy
keeps staring at you.

372
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:08,440
-Looks like he knows you.
-Maybe he does.

373
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:12,358
I should make my way over
and introduce myself to our illustrious D.A.

374
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:14,958
George Wayne, Vanity Fair, writer.

375
00:22:15,564 --> 00:22:18,124
I read your column every month.
You're wonderful.

376
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:20,081
You're the much loved, much praised...

377
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:23,759
-...District Attorney of Manhattan.
-I don't know if I'm praised and loved.

378
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,881
And you are Sheila King,
formerly Sheila Blair.

379
00:22:27,364 --> 00:22:29,798
Assistant D.A. in charge of sex crimes.

380
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:30,959
Very good.

381
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:34,918
I've interrupted your lunch because
I'm having a meeting with my editor...

382
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:38,355
...and we're thinking about doing a story:
"Ten Who Run New York."

383
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:43,279
And you're on the short-list with the likes
of Donald Trump and the Mayor.

384
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:45,560
What do you think of that notion?

385
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:49,763
Maybe you should interview
some of his past wives, too.

386
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:53,280
-Wives?
-He's got two others besides this woman.

387
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:56,917
You should meet my brother Will.
He's got a nice resume, too.

388
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:58,642
Is Will studying to be a lawyer?

389
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:01,841
He's on his way to law,
but in a different sense.

390
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:05,917
-My son has a vivid imagination.
-I've got a good imagination, George.

391
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:08,832
-Call my office tomorrow.
-Sounds like a great idea.

392
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:12,843
-We can lock it up.
-I like that notion. "Lock it up."

393
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,994
-Nice to meet you.
-Thanks for the intrusion.

394
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:21,635
What's wrong with you?

395
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:26,920
-The guy's a journalist.
-This is a great opportunity for your father.

396
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:29,438
What do you care?
What's it have to do with you?

397
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:32,402
-It's his fucking career.
-Watch your mouth.

398
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:34,395
Are you serious? Watch my mouth?

399
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:37,760
Since when do you say watch my mouth?
Since she's around?

400
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:41,200
Don't you ever disrespect my wife
or me in front of a stranger again.

401
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:46,074
I'll cut you off. Be with your brother.
Buy your fancy Avirex and Kangol hats.

402
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:50,962
-Go uptown and hang out with him.
-You're really scaring me, Pop.

403
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:52,802
Go. Why don't you leave right now?

404
00:23:52,884 --> 00:23:55,318
Go home, pack your bags,
move out of our house.

405
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,440
What's that supposed to be, a punishment?

406
00:23:57,524 --> 00:24:00,038
You bet it is.
Either play by my rules or get out.

407
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:02,843
Do you hear me? Support yourself.

-Go on. What?

It's just somewhere else right now.

444
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:14,757
Wanna talk about it?

445
00:26:19,284 --> 00:26:22,754
Something happened real strange today.
I can't tell anybody.

446
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:25,679
-Nobody.
-You don't trust me?

447
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:30,434
I'm listening to a guy
and the way he was coming at me--

448
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:32,674
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

449
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:35,477
The guy who approached me
was a gambler.

450
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:38,561
So what's your point?

451
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:42,444
He offered me $50,000 to throw the game.

452
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:45,994
That's the kind of thing Luke used to do
when I was living with him.

453
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:47,403
He would bribe players.

454
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:49,202
Why'd you live with someone like that?

455
00:26:49,284 --> 00:26:51,673
-Someone like you?
-What's that supposed to mean?

456
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:55,040
He paid bribes, you're gonna take a bribe.
What's the difference?

457
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:56,392
Should I do it or not?

458
00:26:58,164 --> 00:26:59,916
Just be true to yourself.

459
00:27:05,204 --> 00:27:09,117
So, we have no alcohol sponsor,
no liquor sponsor, nothing.

460
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:11,360
And we're gonna open up a club
in three days?

461
00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:13,475
We do have a sponsor.

462
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,643
Celebrity plus models equals a bash.

463
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:18,437
It's gonna be sick.

464
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:19,958
Hook me up.

465
00:27:20,124 --> 00:27:21,876
Get on the phone and check on that.

466
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:25,041
If you don't stop stressing,
you're gonna die before you're 25.

467
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:26,955
I want it to be right.

00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:31,398

469
00:27:33,004 --> 00:27:34,960
Get a fucking representative up.

00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:37,553
-Who's the man in charge?
-Back up.

00:27:37,684 --> 00:27:39,993
-Who's in charge?
-I am.

472
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:41,881
-You in charge?
-Yeah. Scotty.

473
00:27:42,884 --> 00:27:44,522
You here with me?

474
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,800
Everybody shut the fuck up
and let me handle my business!

475
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:51,795

476
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:54,273
You all some blind motherfuckers
for trying that.

477
00:27:54,364 --> 00:27:57,003
-Ain't this a bitch.
-Just quit this shit.

478
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,641
-You know where you're at?
-Yeah, I know.

479
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:03,512
I don't think you know. I didn't get
any phone calls from you or your people.

480
00:28:03,604 --> 00:28:05,276
-You know who I am?
-I think so.

481
00:28:05,444 --> 00:28:07,753
I need 75 percent of this joint right here.

482
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:11,473
75 percent me,
25 percent for you and your guys.

483
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,077
What are we getting for 75 percent?

484
00:28:13,164 --> 00:28:17,760
Who the fuck are you?
I thought he was the fucking spokesman.

485
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:20,193
Do you understand?
Turn around and look at him.

486
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,440
You understand what I'm talking about?

487
00:28:22,524 --> 00:28:25,243
I don't want this fucking shit
happening here.

488
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,360
All right.

489
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,958
I don't know. I don't have any money.

490
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,035
It's not my money, it's somebody else's.

491
00:28:32,124 --> 00:28:35,400
Then why did you step up
like you're the man in charge then?

492
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:38,203
'Cause I didn't know who you were,
I didn't know.

493
00:28:38,444 --> 00:28:40,196
Shut up, all right? Please.

494
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:43,242
Don't watch my gun.
Guns don't kill people, people kill people.

495
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:45,839
-Tell him who your uncle is.
-Fuck his uncle!

496
00:28:46,484 --> 00:28:49,157
-Take down his phone number.
-Are you down with the mob?

497
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:51,883
-You want my number?
-Yeah, your number.

498
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:54,194
555-2975.

499
00:28:54,764 --> 00:28:59,838
-I'm sorry, man. What was your number?
-555-2975!

500
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:01,962
White boys, you all got heart.

501
00:29:02,044 --> 00:29:03,477
Tell him Rich Bower.

502
00:29:04,404 --> 00:29:07,953
-Come to the gym tomorrow.
-What gym you talking about?

503
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:09,523
Where Tyson trains.

504
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:13,713
You motherfuckers make sure
you get your shit right 'cause I'll be back.

505
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:18,601
Tell the boys to reach out for me.

506
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:37,034
Scotty, we had nothing to do with that.

507
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:38,995
What the fuck is going on?

508
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:41,716
Do you know those guys?

509
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:43,962
Who are those fucking guys?

510
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:48,117
Nigger motherfuckers come in here.
Who the fuck are they?

511
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:03,118
-So we're on?
-What makes you so sure?

512
00:30:03,364 --> 00:30:04,399
You showed up.

513
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:06,993
Yeah, I'm here.

514
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:09,155
-Did you tell anybody about this?
-No.

515
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,555
-Nobody.
-Nobody.

516
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:15,914
-Not even your girlfriend?
-How do you know I got a girlfriend?

517
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:19,317
I don't know you have a girlfriend.
I just assume you do.

518
00:30:19,404 --> 00:30:21,793
I mean, you're a young man. You know.

519
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:26,193
-So did you tell her?
-Why would I tell my girl?

520
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,997
If you do, we're fucked.
You don't wanna fuck me.

521
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,718
I thought about it, but I think I'll pass on it.

522
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:34,633
Seriously, you don't wanna fuck me, right?

523
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:37,955
-You're asking me some strange questions.
-This will be a fuck fest.

524
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:42,000
Both of us are gonna be fucked
if you say anything to anybody.

525
00:30:43,804 --> 00:30:45,442
I don't think you wanna do this.

526
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:48,357
You act like you don't.
So do you want me to say no?

527
00:30:48,524 --> 00:30:51,084
I don't want you to say no,
just what you wanna say.

528
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:53,724
If you wanna do it, I want you to do it.
If you wanna...

529
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:56,034
...basically take a lot of money
to fix a game.

530
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:57,637
I want you to be clear with this.

531
00:30:57,724 --> 00:31:01,034
You're committing a felony.
You're losing a basketball game for money.

532
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:04,480
I want you to understand
that you're breaking the law.

533
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:06,441
If you're fine with that, then so am l.

534
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:09,079
I know what I'm doing.
You got the money or what?

535
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:11,997
I got the 10. Then you get the 15,
then the 25.

536
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:13,594
Where is it?

537
00:31:14,364 --> 00:31:16,719
It's in the bathroom.

538
00:31:18,284 --> 00:31:21,082
It's not in the bathroom,
it's in my underwear.

539
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:25,476
I think we should go
into the bathroom to get it.

540
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:30,432
I could get it out of my underwear now
but I think we should go in the bathroom.

541
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:33,243
All right. Let's go in the bathroom
and get your money.

542
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,792
Let's go to the bathroom
and get out my underwear.

543
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:37,763
This is crazy.

544
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,842
The things we do
to throw a basketball game.

545
00:31:56,204 --> 00:31:57,239
So?

546
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:06,996
-Don't try no funny stuff, man.
-Funny stuff?.

547
00:32:07,164 --> 00:32:09,155
You look like a pervert or something.

548
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:12,036
I'm not a pervert.

549
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:16,957
You are mighty strange.

550
00:32:17,044 --> 00:32:19,399
Will you stop fumbling around
and give me the money?

551
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:21,202
What is that supposed to mean?

552
00:32:23,644 --> 00:32:27,239
-Bad? Strange? What?
-Take it how you want it.

553
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:50,995
-How are you?
-Chilling.

554
00:32:52,364 --> 00:32:55,401
Went down there and checked out
that club you told me about.

555
00:32:56,604 --> 00:32:58,435
Glad to be of service.

556
00:32:58,804 --> 00:33:01,876
-What's happening?
-Same old same old. Taking care of shit.

557
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:03,837
Taking care of what?

558
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:09,362
Nothing, just come from down the street.
Smoke a little weed, see some girls.

559
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:12,197
-Who's down there?
-Just some girls I saw.

560
00:33:12,764 --> 00:33:14,595
Nothing belonging to me down there?

561
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:18,000
Four guys, three cows,
two sheep, anything you need.

562
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,716
You got a sick mind.

563
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:24,720
White boy gets into
some crazy shit sometimes.

564
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:27,360
Fucking D.A.'s psycho son.

565
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:33,598
This right here is the infamous Will.

566
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,795
Sam Doneger. Nice to meet you.

567
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:37,522
I'm you're fan, aren't l?

568
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:41,196
I'm doing a film on your brother.
This is my husband Terry.

569
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:46,277
She found us
and she's doing this documentary.

570
00:33:48,604 --> 00:33:51,164
Who are these guys?
Will you introduce us?

571
00:33:52,084 --> 00:33:53,312
-No.
-No?

572
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:56,163
What up?

573
00:33:58,324 --> 00:34:00,599
I'll be over there at the wall.

574
00:34:00,884 --> 00:34:02,476
What's the wall?

575
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:05,596
The wall is where they're from.
It's where they congregate.

576
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,114
Can we go to the wall? Can we do that?

577
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:11,318
No, you can't go to the wall.
Don't go to the wall.

578
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:14,073
We'll go to the wall. It's a free country.

579
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:17,042
Don't go to the wall.
Don't follow them there. Don't do it.

580
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:19,684
Why don't you get back downtown?

581
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:20,958
Let's go to the wall.

582
00:34:21,044 --> 00:34:23,922
Why don't you go downtown?
I'm as much from here as you are.

583
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:27,155
-Why can't we go to the wall?
-We can go if you wanna go.

584
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:30,759
-Why has he gotta be so possessive?
-Let's go. Let's go to the wall.

585
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:32,914
My brother's a pretty cool guy, isn't he?

586
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,161
Are you guys imitating a black culture
or a black lifestyle?

587
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:56,593
We're not imitating it,
we're influenced by it.

588
00:34:56,724 --> 00:35:01,639
Did you always have that way of speaking?
ls that the way you were brought up?

589
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:03,641
Whatever. It just happened.

590
00:35:03,764 --> 00:35:07,552
If you moved to London right now,
in two years you'd be talking...

591
00:35:07,644 --> 00:35:08,872
...like some English person.

592
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,321
You talk like this to your parents?
How do they feel about it?

593
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:15,163
They hate it,
but their parents hated what they did.

594
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:17,553
So, it is about rebelling
against your parents.

595
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,599
It's about doing what the fuck
you wanna do.

596
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:28,523
Sam? Oh, my God!

597
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:31,438
Hi. How are you?

598
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,475
You've changed so much.

599
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:38,439
I have. I'm a filmmaker.
I'm doing a documentary.

600
00:35:38,524 --> 00:35:39,320
Really?

601
00:35:39,444 --> 00:35:40,797
What's your name?

602
00:35:41,324 --> 00:35:42,279
Scott.

603
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:45,519
-Howdy, Scott.
-How you doing, pal?

604
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:48,557
What do you want?

605
00:35:48,884 --> 00:35:50,920
-Nothing. Just watching.
-Watching what?

606
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:52,483
The approach to Staten lsland.

607
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:53,758
Are you married?

608
00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:57,154
Yeah, I'm married.
I live on the Upper East Side....

609
00:35:57,444 --> 00:36:00,402
-I don't mean to be strange or pushy or...
-Well, you are.

610
00:36:00,964 --> 00:36:04,001
...come off like a cushion pusher to you.

611
00:36:04,844 --> 00:36:06,197
I don't understand.

612
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:09,915
Why do you guys always gotta come up
and talk to me?

613
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:13,560
I'm not gay. Do I have a sign on me
that says "fuck me" or something?

614
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:15,680
-'Cause I don't like dick.
-Right.

615
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:19,479
I'm going to my girlfriend's house.
Girlfriend, girlfriend.

616
00:36:19,684 --> 00:36:21,993
-What's his name?
-His name. Real funny.

617
00:36:22,124 --> 00:36:24,718
I'm married, too.
Actually, that's my husband.

618
00:36:25,164 --> 00:36:28,076
Back up. Every day I got
one of you freaks coming up...

619
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:31,201
...and trying to hit on me.
I don't understand. What's the deal?

620
00:36:31,444 --> 00:36:34,720
Do I look gay?
Am I wearing a G-string and Daisy Dukes?

621
00:36:34,804 --> 00:36:38,922
-It's more of just an energy.
-Let me know if you see it.

622
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:41,643
-'Cause I don't know what it is.
-I just saw you walk in.

623
00:36:41,724 --> 00:36:45,637
-Is my walk feminine or something?
-Let me see. Give me a walk.

624
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:48,762
-Did you see it when I walked in?
-I wasn't paying attention.

625
00:36:48,844 --> 00:36:50,641
What makes you think
I wanna go with you?

626
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:51,918
It's your energy.

627
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,201
-There's nothing to do about it?
-I don't know if it's internalised.

628
00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:57,434
Do you go up to people randomly
and bother them?

629
00:36:57,524 --> 00:36:58,877
-Yes.
-You're bothering me.

630
00:36:58,964 --> 00:37:01,194
-I don't mean to.
-Can you leave me alone?

631
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:02,478
Certainly--

632
00:37:02,564 --> 00:37:05,681
All right. Nice meeting you.
Let's leave it at that.

633
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:07,800
-Goodbye. Take care.
-Very well.

634
00:37:10,244 --> 00:37:14,920
-I don't know about this shit.
-Just trust me on this shit.

635
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:18,042
-This is Brett Ratner right here.
-Rich, good to see you.

636
00:37:18,524 --> 00:37:20,674
-Cigar, what up?
-Good to meet you.

637
00:37:20,924 --> 00:37:22,642
I heard your record. I'm a big fan.

638
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:24,680
-It's incredible.
-I don't make records.

639
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:26,158
He sent me the demo.

640
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,758
I sent him the tape,
the demo of the Cream Team.

641
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:30,482
Why do you think I came out here?

642
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:33,203
I hope you came out here to do work.
That's what we want.

643
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,081
I'm here to sell records for you.

644
00:37:37,044 --> 00:37:41,356
Every time I call this nigga,
he be having a joint, playing.

645
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:44,442
I'm doing Hollywood films,
you got a hit record.

646
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:48,036
I wanna do a video. Because
if I do it, it's gonna cross over.

647
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:50,160
I've never been to Staten lsland before.

648
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:52,798
But I know what you
and your music are about.

649
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:54,522
And I know what you're saying.

650
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:57,562
I respect what he do,
but we ain't the same type of people.

651
00:37:57,644 --> 00:37:59,123
We're black, he's white.

652
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:02,475
The truth is, I'm white, I'm from Miami.
But I love your music.

653
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:05,476
I'm just here to make it look great.
That's my job.

654
00:38:05,564 --> 00:38:07,600
He gonna Hollywoodise it for us.

655
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:09,800
I'm gonna give you the production values.

656
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:12,921
He gonna make it look like it's Hollywood
even though it ain't.

657
00:38:13,164 --> 00:38:17,203
-We're gonna take it from the purest form.
-I know what your audience wants...

658
00:38:17,284 --> 00:38:19,752
...and I know how to cross it over
at the same time.

659
00:38:19,844 --> 00:38:24,395
All I want to say is,
if my man believes in you, I believe in you.

660
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:28,282
-What's going down?
-Sorry. Sam Doneger.

661
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:29,479
I'm doing a documentary.

662
00:38:29,564 --> 00:38:32,203
Rolling up on a nigga
with a camera and all this shit.

663
00:38:32,684 --> 00:38:35,039
This is a camera.
I'm just working with myself.

664
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:38,275
I'm doing a documentary
on this phenomenon I've witnessed...

665
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:40,958
...all over America.
Hi. Sam. What's your name?

666
00:38:41,044 --> 00:38:41,999
Brett Ratner.

667
00:38:42,524 --> 00:38:43,957
Brett. Rush Hour. Great.

668
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:47,841
You said you were going to the wall.
Is this the wall?

669
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:00,322
Okay, I want to interview you.

670
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,360
Holly shit! Brett fucking Ratner!

671
00:39:02,484 --> 00:39:04,520
Why didn't you tell me he was coming in?

672
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:06,322
I know you know this cat, man.

673
00:39:08,004 --> 00:39:09,960
We're doing a video here.

674
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:13,759
Now I know I gotta watch my back.
I'm fucking with analogue niggas.

675
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,357
You know these motherfuckers?

676
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:23,356
-I don't know them.
-They bought your record.

677
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:27,603
Don't leave me out.

678
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:30,761
What goes on? Oh, my God.

679
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:33,153
This the pesky lady
with the camera right here.

680
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:35,712
-Yeah, I'm doing a documentary.
-Miss Doneger.

681
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:38,637
-Sam's my name.
-What you be needs to know?

682
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:42,433
-I wanna know about the wall.
-All right, I'll tell you about the wall.

683
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:46,676
This wall is a monument
to two former soldiers that lived out here.

684
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:51,076
America is definitely eating its young.
It's time we did something about it...

685
00:39:51,164 --> 00:39:53,803
...and took responsibility
for our ways and actions.

686
00:39:53,964 --> 00:39:57,559
That's why you got,
"Can it be all so simple?"

687
00:39:58,044 --> 00:39:59,193
It ain't that simple.

688
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:02,833
It's never that simple. That's why
after the laughter there's always tears.

689
00:40:03,044 --> 00:40:05,956
You'd be surprised how many white kids
do know what time it is.

690
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:08,399
The same way we was taught
when we came here...

691
00:40:08,484 --> 00:40:10,918
...on the slave ships, we teaching now.

692
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,678
So who are the slaves today?

693
00:40:13,884 --> 00:40:15,237
We still the slaves.

694
00:40:15,324 --> 00:40:19,112
-The average working man is a slave.
-We all sharecropping.

695
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:22,435
But the thing is,
this music is so influential and so real...

696
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:25,601
...there is not a wall built
that can hold it down.

697
00:40:34,844 --> 00:40:37,438
Me and Charlie wanna come
hang out with you.

698
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:40,038
You all got too much
extra baggage around.

699
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:43,480
-If we lose our boyfriends, can we come?
-What did I just tell you?

700
00:41:17,484 --> 00:41:20,123
-I'll say I'm not feeling well.
-I wanna go.

701
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,114
When we get off the ferry,
let's jump in a cab and ditch them.

702
00:41:24,924 --> 00:41:27,154
Let's get something to eat
when we get back.

703
00:41:27,244 --> 00:41:29,314
Let's get it when we get to Chinatown.

704
00:41:55,684 --> 00:41:58,244
There's only one cab.
There's not enough for everybody.

705
00:41:58,324 --> 00:41:59,962
We have to stick with these kids.

706
00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:02,274
-You wanna meet up later?
-We gotta take two cabs.

707
00:42:02,364 --> 00:42:05,242
-I'm just gonna chill out.
-Let's go over to my house.

708
00:42:05,324 --> 00:42:06,473
Let's go.

709
00:42:06,684 --> 00:42:09,517
-Charlie, wait!
-We'll talk tomorrow.

710
00:42:10,084 --> 00:42:13,554
-I can't find my nose ring.
-Something's fucked up. Let's follow them.

711
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:15,236
This is fucking bullshit.

712
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:19,918
-What's wrong?
-Get in. Go.

713
00:42:57,004 --> 00:42:58,881
Come on, I ain't got all day.

714
00:43:03,244 --> 00:43:04,563
You're under arrest.

715
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,034
For what?

716
00:43:12,604 --> 00:43:15,072
I want you to understand
that you're breaking the law.

717
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:17,155
If you're fine with that, then so am l.

718
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:19,394
Just tell me you understand
what you're doing.

719
00:43:19,484 --> 00:43:21,714
I know what I'm doing.
You got the money or what?

720
00:43:21,804 --> 00:43:25,080
I got the 10. Then you get the 15,
then the 25.

721
00:43:26,444 --> 00:43:27,843
Where is it?

722
00:43:28,724 --> 00:43:30,316
What you want from me?

723
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:36,036
-Rich.
-Rich?

724
00:43:37,724 --> 00:43:39,476
Rich is not even in--

725
00:43:40,004 --> 00:43:42,518
He's just the biggest gangster in Harlem.

726
00:43:42,604 --> 00:43:46,643
Rich is into entertainment, rap.
He's not a street hustler.

727
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:48,761
Okay, then you go to jail.

728
00:43:48,924 --> 00:43:50,437
What's this all about?

729
00:43:50,524 --> 00:43:54,119
It's about you going to jail
unless you give me Rich. You're fucked.

730
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:57,238
I'm a fucking New York City detective.

731
00:43:58,284 --> 00:44:00,639
You're under arrest. You're fucked.

732
00:44:04,444 --> 00:44:06,400
For $50,000.

733
00:44:10,204 --> 00:44:12,513
You and Cigar arrange that meeting
at the gym for me?

734
00:44:12,604 --> 00:44:15,482
You know I handled that.
2:00, he wants to talk.

735
00:44:15,644 --> 00:44:17,157
Everybody gonna be there.

736
00:44:19,204 --> 00:44:22,162
-Who is it?
-Wren and Marty to see Charlie and Kim.

737
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:23,279
Oh, shit!

738
00:44:24,324 --> 00:44:25,882
Yeah, let them in.

739
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:29,001
-What the fuck are they doing here?
-I don't know, but chill.

740
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:34,195
Charlie, come on, I want to talk to you.

741
00:44:34,324 --> 00:44:36,599
No, not now. What do you want?

742
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:42,961
-I want to talk to you. Please.
-Tell me now. What?

743
00:44:43,044 --> 00:44:45,922
-Can we talk?
-What do you want to talk about? Stop it!

744
00:44:46,004 --> 00:44:48,564
-Calm down, man.
-Get off it.

745
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:51,194
Don't be starting with him.
It's my problem.

746
00:44:51,324 --> 00:44:53,792
What do you mean,
don't be starting with him?

747
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:57,553
It's my fucking problem.
I don't even want to talk to you about it.

748
00:44:57,804 --> 00:44:59,396
Chill out with that bullshit.

749
00:44:59,484 --> 00:45:02,317
-I thought I could trust you.
-You can. What did I do?

750
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:04,555
I thought you were going to Kim's house.

751
00:45:04,644 --> 00:45:07,636
I thought I was going over
to Kim's house, too. But Rae--

752
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:10,477
I didn't know that you knew
these people like this.

753
00:45:10,764 --> 00:45:14,074
They were talking about this place,
and I'd never been here.

754
00:45:14,164 --> 00:45:16,041
So I said, "Take me there."

755
00:45:16,164 --> 00:45:19,156
You've never gotten into a cab
and changed your mind? Ever?

756
00:45:19,244 --> 00:45:21,553
She didn't even know.
We would've told you.

757
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:26,082
You come here
and you're disrespectful to everybody.

758
00:45:26,164 --> 00:45:28,394
Disrespectful? What?

759
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:33,163
It was a chill, mellow environment
until your ass showed up.

760
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:36,994
It was cool in here.
We were all relaxing, smoking joints...

761
00:45:37,204 --> 00:45:38,603
...watching television.

762
00:45:38,684 --> 00:45:41,801
-You said you were going to Kim's.
-And then we changed our minds.

763
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:44,444
-In the middle of the cab drive.
-Why are you here?

764
00:45:44,524 --> 00:45:48,722
Alright, let her chill out.
Help me finish this. Come on.

765
00:45:50,204 --> 00:45:53,799
It's cool.
Everybody's a little crazy right now.

766
00:45:55,564 --> 00:45:58,124
Why do you gotta be getting
involved with my problems?

767
00:45:58,204 --> 00:46:01,196
What do you mean, why I got
to get involved with your problems?

768
00:46:01,284 --> 00:46:03,878
When he's around
you always disrespect me.

769
00:46:03,964 --> 00:46:05,192
So fucking what?

770
00:46:06,044 --> 00:46:09,878
You're always telling me I'm your pussy,
I'm this, I'm that.

771
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:11,835
You gotta chill on that shit.

772
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:14,434
-Is that Mike Tyson?
-Yeah, that's Mike Tyson.

773
00:46:14,524 --> 00:46:17,322
-Are you filming everything?
-It's part of the documentary.

774
00:46:17,404 --> 00:46:19,918
-Check the joint out.
-Give me this shit.

775
00:46:20,004 --> 00:46:24,520
Come on, it's part of the documentary.
I'm not doing anything bad with it.

776
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:26,802
Okay, this is me.

777
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:30,638
-This is what I look like.
-Yeah, I can see you right there.

778
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:33,158
-Is that really Mike Tyson?
-Yeah, that's Mike Tyson.

779
00:46:34,484 --> 00:46:37,362
-Women in the Palaeolithic Era.
-The Golden Age.

780
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:39,083
Yeah. Goddesses.

781
00:46:40,244 --> 00:46:43,122
-They ruled.
-No one understood procreation.

782
00:46:43,364 --> 00:46:45,594
How would anybody know
without being told?

783
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:49,512
-People just go on being naive and angry.
-It makes perfect sense.

784
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:53,041
-We didn't go to the bookstore.
-We'll do it tomorrow.

785
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,194
-Keep well.
-You too. Bye.

786
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:03,796
Did you know that women
in the Palaeolithic Era were like....

787
00:47:05,724 --> 00:47:07,760
-What's the matter?
-I'm fucked.

788
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:11,075
-The game didn't work out?
-Nothing worked out. The guy was a cop.

789
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:14,241
-The guy who approached you?
-The guy who paid me!

790
00:47:15,204 --> 00:47:16,637
You took the money.

791
00:47:17,164 --> 00:47:19,962
You act surprised.
You thought I should take the money, too.

792
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:22,393
I said, "Do what you want,
just be true to yourself."

793
00:47:22,724 --> 00:47:24,316
What was that supposed to mean?

794
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:28,795
That means free will, your choice.
And you chose to take the bribe.

795
00:47:28,964 --> 00:47:32,843
-So what's the problem now, you regret it?
-Yeah, I regret it. I got caught!

796
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:35,722
Suppose you hadn't been caught.
Then what?

797
00:47:36,524 --> 00:47:38,958
Then you would've felt good
about yourself, right?

798
00:47:39,044 --> 00:47:44,323
So, who you are is based on external
judgements and not any conviction.

799
00:47:44,404 --> 00:47:48,033
Are you listening to yourself?.
I'm in the worst trouble of my life...

800
00:47:48,124 --> 00:47:50,592
...and you're examining it
like it's a term paper.

801
00:47:50,684 --> 00:47:53,357
What happened? Did he arrest you?

802
00:47:53,764 --> 00:47:55,561
-I guess.
-What do you mean you guess?

803
00:47:55,644 --> 00:47:57,521
-He didn't want me.
-Who did he want?

804
00:47:57,644 --> 00:48:01,114
He wanted me to rat out Rich
because of the shit he's doing.

805
00:48:01,204 --> 00:48:03,638
-Then he'll let you go?
-That's what he said.

806
00:48:03,724 --> 00:48:05,919
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

807
00:48:08,444 --> 00:48:10,116
I thought Rich was your friend.

808
00:48:10,244 --> 00:48:13,316
We grew up together.
He went his way, I went my way.

809
00:48:13,404 --> 00:48:15,440
All this is about fucking with the law.

810
00:48:15,564 --> 00:48:17,395
-And you've been straight?
-That's right.

811
00:48:17,484 --> 00:48:21,238
-Now you broke away and got nailed?
-Are you saying I'm supposed to go to jail?

812
00:48:21,324 --> 00:48:23,884
-I'm saying be true to yourself.
-What would you do?

813
00:48:23,964 --> 00:48:25,158
It doesn't matter.

814
00:48:31,884 --> 00:48:35,433
-Sorry. Are you having a private moment?
-Yeah.

815
00:48:37,924 --> 00:48:42,076
-Excuse me, brother?
-I'm sorry, my heart is pounding right now.

816
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:45,395
I'm just so excited to meet you and stuff.

817
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:52,117
If I could just have a minute of your time
to tell you some things I have to get rid of.

818
00:48:52,644 --> 00:48:55,602
-What can I do for you, my friend?
-I'm Terrence Doneger.

819
00:48:55,964 --> 00:48:57,556
What can I do for you?

820
00:48:57,884 --> 00:49:01,035
I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

821
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:05,756
I met you in the Versace store...

822
00:49:05,844 --> 00:49:09,757
...in Los Angeles a while back,
and I was a little drunk, and--

823
00:49:10,684 --> 00:49:11,833
I don't know you.

824
00:49:11,924 --> 00:49:16,315
No, I didn't say that we knew each other,
just that I had met you before.

825
00:49:16,404 --> 00:49:18,360
I wanted to apologise if I said anything--

826
00:49:18,444 --> 00:49:22,278
-I don't remember.
-Good. 'Cause I barely remember myself.

827
00:49:23,284 --> 00:49:25,559
Don't worry about it. You're okay, man.

828
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:39,595
I had a dream about you.
This was what I wanted to say.

829
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:41,959
It's why my heart is racing
and I'm so fluttery.

830
00:49:42,044 --> 00:49:46,674
If I seem strange, I'd like to apologise.
I had a dream about you two weeks ago.

831
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:50,797
That's funny, because you were wearing
a shirt like the one you're wearing now.

832
00:49:52,084 --> 00:49:54,314
-And in the dream--
-Listen.

833
00:49:56,604 --> 00:49:59,277
I'm on parole brother. Please. Let's....

834
00:49:59,484 --> 00:50:02,601
-Am I annoying you?
-I just wanna....

835
00:50:02,964 --> 00:50:06,274
-I'm having a peaceful moment. Please.
-Okay.

836
00:50:08,244 --> 00:50:10,712
In the dream, you were holding me,
that's all.

837
00:50:15,124 --> 00:50:16,796
Motherfucker!

838
00:50:16,884 --> 00:50:18,363
Sam, are you getting this?

839
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,874
Don't talk to me like that again!

840
00:50:24,524 --> 00:50:27,197
God! What are you doing?

841
00:50:27,284 --> 00:50:29,081
Don't fuck with me, come drinker!

842
00:50:33,484 --> 00:50:37,796
I'm sure Mr. Tyson would rather
speak to so many other people right now.

843
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:39,472
I'm Sam.

844
00:50:43,404 --> 00:50:47,363
She got that on tape.
That isn't right. You ain't right.

845
00:50:47,484 --> 00:50:51,602
I don't know anything about this
white fag shit. White guys do this shit.

846
00:50:52,124 --> 00:50:54,160
Listen, I'm from a different culture.

847
00:50:54,644 --> 00:50:56,714
Steady on the assault and battery now.

848
00:50:56,844 --> 00:51:00,803
I was in the penitentiary.
They said I raped somebody, so just....

849
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:05,157
-Do you wanna talk to me about it?
-That's okay.

850
00:51:05,244 --> 00:51:07,200
I'll take your word for it.

851
00:51:07,724 --> 00:51:11,000
They put you underneath the penitentiary
for the white women.

852
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:12,676
Is there a difference?

853
00:51:12,764 --> 00:51:15,836
What's the difference between
a white woman versus a black woman?

854
00:51:15,924 --> 00:51:19,678
Don't touch no white bitch.
They got me with that other.

855
00:51:20,484 --> 00:51:22,361
Do you want me to turn it off?.

856
00:51:22,444 --> 00:51:24,594
-Please, now.
-Do you want me to turn it off?.

857
00:51:24,684 --> 00:51:28,393
Please! You're not dealing with an animal.
This is not a study of animals.

858
00:51:28,484 --> 00:51:30,076
It's off. Okay?

859
00:51:30,564 --> 00:51:33,362
Please allow me....
Just leave me here, please.

860
00:51:33,564 --> 00:51:35,202
-Okay.
-Please.

861
00:51:35,564 --> 00:51:40,001
Can I just introduce myself to you?
ln all honesty, I'm a fan.

862
00:51:41,124 --> 00:51:43,558
Go ahead with that strange individual.

863
00:51:44,324 --> 00:51:47,043
I don't think he meant any harm.
I really don't.

864
00:51:53,204 --> 00:51:54,603
What's his name?

865
00:51:55,124 --> 00:51:56,876
-Whose name?
-The cop.

866
00:51:57,244 --> 00:51:58,597
Mark Clear.

867
00:51:59,204 --> 00:52:00,796
What does he look like?

868
00:52:00,964 --> 00:52:02,795
-What does he look like?
-Yes.

869
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:05,034
What difference does it make
what he looks like?

870
00:52:05,124 --> 00:52:06,443
Just curious.

871
00:52:07,244 --> 00:52:08,996
He looks like what he is.

872
00:52:10,244 --> 00:52:11,802
So what are you gonna do now?

873
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:20,720
You're definitely beautiful to look at.

874
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,477
-You really believe that?
-Why would I say that?

875
00:52:23,804 --> 00:52:27,194
Do you think I want you mad at me
for lying? I'm not gonna lie to you.

876
00:52:27,764 --> 00:52:31,882
Of course I wouldn't be angry 'cause
no one ever told me that I was gorgeous.

877
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,357
But you are, you really are. Come on!

878
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:37,879
You've got beautiful eyes.

879
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:44,192
And I'm in the phone book. Sam Doneger.

880
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:56,603
Hold on. A chick named Greta
wanna holler at you.

881
00:52:57,084 --> 00:53:01,441
Greta? What the fuck she wanna holler
at me for? What's going on here?

882
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:04,755
Are you okay, honey? That was great.

883
00:53:05,284 --> 00:53:06,876
Rich right here. Speak to me.

884
00:53:07,444 --> 00:53:09,594
Listen, I've gotta see you right away.

885
00:53:10,124 --> 00:53:12,797
-What's on your mind?
-Not on the phone.

886
00:53:12,924 --> 00:53:14,516
You're in a lot of trouble.

887
00:53:14,644 --> 00:53:17,317
I wanna help you,
but you have to come out and meet me.

888
00:53:17,684 --> 00:53:19,879
What do you mean
I may be in a lot of trouble?

889
00:53:20,084 --> 00:53:22,598
What the fuck are you gonna help me with?

890
00:53:23,084 --> 00:53:27,874
Be at The Roger Williams Hotel.
Room 406, in one hour.

891
00:53:28,444 --> 00:53:31,595
-Meet you at a hotel?
-That's right.

892
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:35,394
-Why you can't tell me over the phone?
-Just be there. Trust me.

893
00:53:46,564 --> 00:53:48,759
Let's get this shit straight.

894
00:53:49,364 --> 00:53:51,753
Ain't no funny business going on here.

895
00:53:51,844 --> 00:53:55,439
Me and my man Dean been down
for too long since we was kids.

896
00:53:55,604 --> 00:53:58,357
Like five years old.
You know I what I'm saying?

897
00:53:59,164 --> 00:54:00,483
All right.

898
00:54:11,684 --> 00:54:14,596
-Come on, baby, I gotta take a piss.
-Go right ahead.

899
00:54:19,684 --> 00:54:22,676
-So, you think Dean is your friend?
-Yeah, Dean's my friend.

900
00:54:22,764 --> 00:54:26,154
What would you do if you knew
that Dean was approached by a gambler...

901
00:54:26,244 --> 00:54:29,395
...and offered $50,000
to shave points on a game?

902
00:54:29,484 --> 00:54:34,353
$50,000? I'd probably tell him to take it.
I'd take it, depending on the circumstance.

903
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:36,998
And if you knew he took the money,
threw the game...

904
00:54:37,084 --> 00:54:39,962
...then found out that the gambler
was really a cop?

905
00:54:40,084 --> 00:54:42,200
Then I'd say Dean got trouble on his hands.

906
00:54:42,284 --> 00:54:45,754
And suppose the cop wasn't really
after Dean but after his friend Rich.

907
00:54:45,884 --> 00:54:49,513
And Dean decided to sell him out,
let him go to jail so he could stay free.

908
00:54:49,644 --> 00:54:50,633
What would you do?

909
00:54:50,724 --> 00:54:55,115
I'd have to be a 100 percent sure before
I even thought about doing anything.

910
00:54:55,204 --> 00:54:56,796
-You can be.
-Is that right?

911
00:54:56,884 --> 00:54:58,476
That's right.

912
00:55:00,644 --> 00:55:03,681
-So what would you do?
-Might have to do something to his girl.

913
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:06,119
-Like what?
-Depends. Whatever turns her on.

914
00:55:06,204 --> 00:55:07,922
Whatever excites her.

915
00:55:08,884 --> 00:55:11,921
And what about Dean?
What would you do to Dean?

916
00:55:12,484 --> 00:55:14,395
Don't worry about Dean.

917
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:48,796
Take a break, Raoul.

918
00:55:49,404 --> 00:55:52,521
We'll go get some pasta.
I'll take you to a sports bar.

919
00:55:52,604 --> 00:55:56,119
I wanna go there. I've never been there.
'Cause I need to go there.

920
00:55:56,204 --> 00:55:57,319
Get a nice bite.

921
00:55:57,444 --> 00:56:01,039
The only thing I got to do
is go home and see my wife...

922
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:03,718
...and get a morning run.
Take my kids to school...

923
00:56:03,844 --> 00:56:07,962
-...and come back and go to the gym.
-Then we'll go next week.

924
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:09,995
The guy be here, Chucky.

925
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:12,397
What's up, my man?

926
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:16,874
This is Cigar. My friend Chuck.

927
00:56:17,204 --> 00:56:21,402
That was some crazy shit last night.
That weird-ass white motherfucker.

928
00:56:21,604 --> 00:56:26,041
-Just came to get some wisdom from you.
-Really. Tell me about wisdom.

929
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:30,554
I've made too many mistakes
to be a man known for his wisdom.

930
00:56:30,684 --> 00:56:33,676
Except you can't make
the same mistakes twice.

931
00:56:34,164 --> 00:56:35,961
I've made quite a few.

932
00:56:36,164 --> 00:56:39,520
Not the same, but I always get
the same consequences: pain.

933
00:56:39,684 --> 00:56:41,675
All this shit boils down to pain.

934
00:56:42,004 --> 00:56:43,835
You know that cat Dean?

935
00:56:44,004 --> 00:56:48,794
He got arrested for some bullshit
and he's trying to stagnate my process.

936
00:56:50,204 --> 00:56:53,276
Where I came from,
as to where the fuck I'm going.

937
00:56:53,604 --> 00:56:57,119
Age-old story, brother. Deceit, treachery.

938
00:56:57,364 --> 00:56:59,832
The dude is in a squeeze.

939
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,121
He's gonna fuck me,
he's gonna get me rocked...

940
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:06,315
...so he can save himself, basically.

941
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:10,803
He's gonna try to....
It's police business and all that shit.

942
00:57:11,484 --> 00:57:13,395
So, this is what you're telling me.

943
00:57:13,484 --> 00:57:16,601
This is what I'm deciphering
from your vernacular.

944
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:19,081
You fucked with a nigger...

945
00:57:19,764 --> 00:57:22,756
...he got in trouble and he told on you.

946
00:57:23,284 --> 00:57:25,400
There are two possibilities.

947
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:27,759
I could kill the motherfucker
or not kill him.

948
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:32,315
If I don't kill him, I'm going to jail.
What's your suggestion?

949
00:57:32,524 --> 00:57:35,834
You got a problem with somebody,
you got to solve it, take care of it.

950
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:39,843
You're angry. You're angry about people
that you feel have betrayed you.

951
00:57:40,404 --> 00:57:44,283
If you're not willing to be nice to somebody
constantly, you should kill them.

952
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:47,800
If you're not nice to them, and you
have them around and empower them...

953
00:57:47,884 --> 00:57:49,636
...they'll kill you or hurt you.

954
00:57:49,724 --> 00:57:52,557
So, you're telling me I should murder him.

955
00:57:53,164 --> 00:57:55,917
No, my friend, I said nothing of the sort.

956
00:57:56,044 --> 00:57:59,559
I'm too fastidious with my words.
I choose them very carefully.

957
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:03,432
What I said is you have a problem.
Deal with the repercussions of it.

958
00:58:03,524 --> 00:58:06,482
Would you deal with the responsibility
of going to prison?

959
00:58:06,564 --> 00:58:11,080
I've been there. You don't want to go.
Random strip searches, kicks in the ass...

960
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:13,234
...having dogs look up your ass.

961
00:58:14,164 --> 00:58:17,201
Having a pervert guard playing
with your asshole and your balls.

962
00:58:17,284 --> 00:58:18,603
Is that what you want?

963
00:58:18,684 --> 00:58:20,834
-You're fucking with words.
-I'm not playing.

964
00:58:20,924 --> 00:58:23,438
You're very articulate and all this bullshit.

965
00:58:23,524 --> 00:58:24,718
Oh, my God.

966
00:58:24,844 --> 00:58:27,233
We're from the same
motherfucking part of town.

967
00:58:27,564 --> 00:58:31,318
I don't even understand
whatever the fuck it was you just said.

968
00:58:31,924 --> 00:58:33,755
In other words...

969
00:58:35,644 --> 00:58:37,441
...a bug needs to be stomped on.

970
00:58:38,284 --> 00:58:41,117
But listen, I love you as a brother,
always will love you.

971
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,994
I like Dean, too,
but your guy chose this life.

972
00:58:45,124 --> 00:58:47,877
Deal with that problem.
You should call me with the scores.

973
00:58:47,964 --> 00:58:51,195
I got a fucking headache,
you're talking some fucking scores.

974
00:58:52,364 --> 00:58:53,638
I'm out of here.

975
00:58:53,724 --> 00:58:55,442
Gotta go, gotta go.

976
00:58:59,204 --> 00:59:01,195
See you tomorrow night, Mike.

977
00:59:02,244 --> 00:59:04,439
Chucky-Chuck. What up, Chuck?

978
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:12,354
Mr. Roberto, talk to me.

979
00:59:14,124 --> 00:59:17,116
There was some trouble
the other night in the club.

980
00:59:17,204 --> 00:59:21,436
-Motherfucking right, there was trouble.
-First of all, this is Scotty, and that's Frank.

981
00:59:22,044 --> 00:59:24,604
-Tell me what happened.
-I'll tell you what happened.

982
00:59:24,684 --> 00:59:26,834
I wanna hear this. He tried to take half.

983
00:59:26,924 --> 00:59:31,475
Clubs opening in the neighbourhood
where I've lived all these years of my life.

984
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:35,160
A 20-block radius
that me and my crew rule.

985
00:59:35,244 --> 00:59:39,123
We're gonna work something out.
I got something else we'll deal with later.

986
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:41,559
As for this, it's solved.
We'll take care of it.

987
00:59:41,724 --> 00:59:44,636
Shake hands with my nephew.
Come on, shake hands.

988
00:59:45,204 --> 00:59:46,637
Shake hands!

989
00:59:48,604 --> 00:59:51,243
All right, no more problems, no more.

990
00:59:51,324 --> 00:59:54,316
There will be no more problems.
We'll work out what we gotta do.

991
00:59:54,444 --> 00:59:57,402
All right, guys, I'll see you at the opening.

992
01:00:01,604 --> 01:00:05,119
Next time you go to him first
and work with him.

993
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:08,833
You make me sound like an asshole.
This guy comes in here and calls me soft.

994
01:00:08,924 --> 01:00:11,597
I do business with him. He's a good guy.

995
01:00:11,684 --> 01:00:15,518
You shut the fuck up!
Just shut up, let him talk.

996
01:00:48,004 --> 01:00:53,032
Excuse me, are you lnspector Deck?
Nice to meet you. I'm Sam Doneger.

997
01:00:53,364 --> 01:00:56,003
I'm a really big fan.
This is my husband, Terry Doneger.

998
01:00:56,084 --> 01:00:58,757
Would you do me a favour
and introduce me to your friends?

999
01:00:58,844 --> 01:01:02,553
-I'm going over there anyway.
-Would you mind? I'd really appreciate it.

1000
01:01:03,884 --> 01:01:05,283
Hi. I'm Sam.

1001
01:01:08,204 --> 01:01:10,035
Nice to meet you.

1002
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:13,594
We were talking about
how your music influences kids today.

1003
01:01:13,684 --> 01:01:15,242
-What's your name?
-Sticks.

1004
01:01:15,324 --> 01:01:17,679
-Why Sticks?
-It's what I do every night.

1005
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:19,483
"Sticks." What's it mean?

1006
01:01:19,564 --> 01:01:22,601
It means don't let me catch you
on a late night walking around.

1007
01:01:28,964 --> 01:01:31,080
What's going on? You all right?

1008
01:01:31,204 --> 01:01:34,082
-How do you like the club? Looks good?
-It's nice.

1009
01:01:34,884 --> 01:01:38,593
-Rich, how are you?
-I could use that favour right about now.

1010
01:01:38,684 --> 01:01:42,643
-You got it. What is it? No problem.
-There's a dude and I need to get him hit.

1011
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:44,954
I want one of your boys to take care of it.

1012
01:01:45,044 --> 01:01:47,717
-Tonight?
-Tonight. Right now.

1013
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:50,079
It's opening night.
You want me to kill a guy?

1014
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:52,837
Let the place warm up a few weeks.
Give me a break.

1015
01:01:54,164 --> 01:01:57,873
Listen, the guy will be here in two days.
It can't wait two days?

1016
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,283
I ain't got two days.

1017
01:01:59,364 --> 01:02:01,719
You want me
to go kill the guy myself tonight?

1018
01:02:01,804 --> 01:02:03,203
I'll deal with it.

1019
01:02:06,564 --> 01:02:09,283
-Do you feel exploited by it?
-It's just bullshit.

1020
01:02:09,364 --> 01:02:12,561
Tell me why. What's bullshit about it?
What's a crock about it?

1021
01:02:13,044 --> 01:02:17,117
It's like the big-ass-tourist bus
that be riding through Harlem...

1022
01:02:17,324 --> 01:02:20,521
...looking at us like we're on display here.

1023
01:02:20,644 --> 01:02:23,841
So you're saying you cannot know it
unless you live it.

1024
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:28,803
Shit is kinda proper.
Gentlemen, what's the word?

1025
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:36,279
I just can't comprehend it.
It's just too much.

1026
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:39,635
-It's like a tumour in my brain.
-That's true.

1027
01:02:40,444 --> 01:02:41,559
Help.

1028
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,119
I'm sorry. I'm so scared.

1029
01:02:44,444 --> 01:02:47,117
I'm just trying to have fun, too.
I thought we share!

1030
01:02:47,204 --> 01:02:49,160
We do. We share.

1031
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:51,834
Let me hit that.

1032
01:02:54,924 --> 01:02:57,392
-What is that you're wearing?
-This?

1033
01:02:58,124 --> 01:02:59,273
The cologne.

1034
01:02:59,364 --> 01:03:03,073
It's Aramis.
You remember Aramis, don't you?

1035
01:03:03,164 --> 01:03:05,678
-That's the same that I wear.
-Come on.

1036
01:03:05,764 --> 01:03:07,595
-I swear to God.
-You're shitting me.

1037
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:11,123
Oh, my God. Is that just nuts?

1038
01:03:11,724 --> 01:03:14,522
She's gone. Who cares?

1039
01:03:14,604 --> 01:03:16,515
She was pretty smart. What's your name?

1040
01:03:16,604 --> 01:03:20,677
-Terry Doneger. What's your name?
-Casey. It's nice to meet you.

1041
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:21,992
It's my pleasure.

1042
01:03:22,324 --> 01:03:24,918
Where you been?
I've been looking for your little ass.

1043
01:03:25,004 --> 01:03:27,393
-What's going on?
-Watch the do.

1044
01:03:27,484 --> 01:03:30,237
Come on, your do's fucked up anyway.
Stop this bullshit.

1045
01:03:30,524 --> 01:03:32,480
What do you think of the gig?

1046
01:03:32,644 --> 01:03:35,556
This shit is right.
What's up with you though?

1047
01:03:35,644 --> 01:03:37,999
-Chilling, feeling the vibe.
-You feeling it?

1048
01:03:39,484 --> 01:03:42,078
Hi everybody, how are you?
How you doing, baby?

1049
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:45,440
Mom, nice coat.

1050
01:03:45,564 --> 01:03:46,963
You borrowed my coat?

1051
01:03:48,084 --> 01:03:50,359
It's my coat, not yours, baby.

1052
01:03:50,444 --> 01:03:52,036
I'm Sam Doneger.

1053
01:03:52,164 --> 01:03:55,952
I'm doing a documentary on your
daughter and all of her friends.

1054
01:03:56,644 --> 01:03:59,238
It's about how we're into hip-hop and shit.

1055
01:03:59,324 --> 01:04:02,316
I got some serious shit
I need to really get at you.

1056
01:04:02,404 --> 01:04:05,635
I'm the one. What do you need?

1057
01:04:05,724 --> 01:04:08,955
You the one? You don't even know
what the fuck I'm talking about.

1058
01:04:09,044 --> 01:04:12,320
You got all the boys,
but I take care of the serious shit.

1059
01:04:12,404 --> 01:04:14,634
-You live like that?
-I'm live like that.

1060
01:04:14,724 --> 01:04:18,433
-Your balls look kind of small to me.
-'Cause these pants is big.

1061
01:04:20,404 --> 01:04:24,158
-I need you to do something for me.
-I'm the one. What you need to do?

1062
01:04:24,764 --> 01:04:26,083
You sure you up to it?

1063
01:04:26,204 --> 01:04:29,958
Depends. But most of the time
I can deal with what you need me to do.

1064
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:32,683
Depends on what?
What do you mean "most of the time"?

1065
01:04:32,764 --> 01:04:36,723
-Either you're with it or you ain't.
-I'm with it. You need me to do what?

1066
01:04:36,924 --> 01:04:38,755
You up to do a murder?

1067
01:04:40,404 --> 01:04:42,634
This is a club. What're you talking about?

1068
01:04:42,724 --> 01:04:45,761
Don't give me this "club" shit.
I don't give a fuck about that.

1069
01:04:46,204 --> 01:04:47,398
You up for it?

1070
01:04:47,604 --> 01:04:49,276
Who do you need to get murdered?

1071
01:04:50,084 --> 01:04:51,199
Dean.

1072
01:04:52,604 --> 01:04:56,643
I don't know about that.
What the fuck, Dean--

1073
01:04:56,724 --> 01:04:59,522
What you mean you don't know?
You said you were with it.

1074
01:05:00,324 --> 01:05:04,158
I am with it. But what the fuck?
Dean is like your boy, he's like my boy.

1075
01:05:04,244 --> 01:05:08,840
-What the fuck's up with Dean?
-What he did to me? ls that important?

1076
01:05:08,924 --> 01:05:11,484
-So you wanna do this right away?
-What do you think?

1077
01:05:11,564 --> 01:05:14,556
I need you to do it right away.
I need you to do it now!

1078
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:17,841
It's done. I'll do it.
I'll do it for you, no problem.

1079
01:05:17,924 --> 01:05:20,597
-You gonna do it?
-Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

1080
01:05:21,964 --> 01:05:23,636
I said I would.

1081
01:05:31,084 --> 01:05:34,394
-Remember me?
-What's up, baby? How you doing?

1082
01:05:34,484 --> 01:05:36,395
-What is going on?
-What you mean?

1083
01:05:36,484 --> 01:05:38,873
-What is going on?
-What you talking about?

1084
01:05:38,964 --> 01:05:42,718
Don't act like you don't know.
You've walked around the club four times...

1085
01:05:42,804 --> 01:05:46,797
...having little conversations with people.
What is this? Look me in the eye.

1086
01:05:47,004 --> 01:05:50,474
What the fuck is going on?
You're full of shit. I can tell.

1087
01:06:03,164 --> 01:06:06,600
Fucking silencer.
What the fuck am I doing?

1088
01:06:11,124 --> 01:06:13,433
That's what the fuck I really ought to do.

1089
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:29,797
-Yeah.
-You ready?

1090
01:06:29,884 --> 01:06:32,603
-Ready?
-Ready to roll. Your time's up, pal.

1091
01:06:32,684 --> 01:06:35,152
There's a lot ofstuff about Rich
I don't even know.

1092
01:06:35,244 --> 01:06:37,633
You got enough on him
just like I got enough on you.

1093
01:06:37,724 --> 01:06:40,033
-Where you gonna be at 8:00?
-The gym.

1094
01:06:40,124 --> 01:06:43,560
-I'll be waiting outside.
-I'm gonna make a lot of enemies.

1095
01:06:43,844 --> 01:06:45,914
My heart's breaking for you, Dean.

1096
01:06:59,324 --> 01:07:01,235
Go on, I'm not playing.

1097
01:07:01,724 --> 01:07:04,796
-You ain't playing? You finished?
-I'm finished for the day.

1098
01:07:26,244 --> 01:07:28,474
Just stay right there. Don't move.

1099
01:07:29,044 --> 01:07:29,999
Relax.

1100
01:07:30,124 --> 01:07:33,082
Just fucking stay right there!
You know what you did.

1101
01:07:33,684 --> 01:07:35,561
You don't understand.

1102
01:07:35,804 --> 01:07:38,318
Don't try to fuck with my head.
You stay there.

1103
01:07:38,404 --> 01:07:41,077
-Let me and him talk about it.
-Rich don't wanna talk.

1104
01:07:41,164 --> 01:07:44,918
You're going to shoot me? Relax man.

1105
01:07:45,124 --> 01:07:47,638
Don't let him get in your head.

1106
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:50,232
Don't you try to fuck with my head.
Stay there.

1107
01:07:50,324 --> 01:07:53,441
-Don't you take another step.
-Me and you will talk about it.

1108
01:07:53,524 --> 01:07:56,084
I swear to God,
don't take another fucking step.

1109
01:07:56,244 --> 01:07:57,723
Don't let him do this.

1110
01:07:57,844 --> 01:08:00,278
Fuck you. Just stay back.

1111
01:08:00,724 --> 01:08:02,874
-Just relax.
-Fuck you.

1112
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:34,520
Attention, units. We got a report

1113
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:37,283
All units in the vicinity, please respond.

Again, we've got a report of a homicide,

1116
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:51,362
Hi. What's so urgent?

1117
01:09:53,044 --> 01:09:56,559
-What's so urgent?
-Remember? That's the word you used.

1118
01:09:57,004 --> 01:09:58,403
Yeah. Hi.

1119
01:10:00,684 --> 01:10:01,753
Yeah?

1120
01:10:02,404 --> 01:10:04,315
You wanna start out like that?

1121
01:10:04,604 --> 01:10:07,277
Wait a minute. What is this?

1122
01:10:09,644 --> 01:10:11,123
This is our....

1123
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:15,243
Doesn't this place bring back any....

1124
01:10:16,364 --> 01:10:18,082
Doesn't it conjure up any....

1125
01:10:18,204 --> 01:10:20,081
No. What is this about, Luke?

1126
01:10:25,884 --> 01:10:28,318
-That guy.
-What guy?

1127
01:10:28,404 --> 01:10:30,554
That guy, what's his name...

1128
01:10:31,204 --> 01:10:32,637
...the basketball player.

1129
01:10:32,724 --> 01:10:36,273
-His name's Dean.
-Right, it was. Dean.

1130
01:10:38,764 --> 01:10:40,561
What do you mean "was"?

1131
01:10:43,644 --> 01:10:44,963
He's dead.

1132
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:49,281
You didn't know that?
You didn't hear it on the news?

1133
01:10:49,364 --> 01:10:50,399
No.

1134
01:10:54,604 --> 01:10:58,722
You know what fascinates me?
It's very interesting to me.

1135
01:10:58,804 --> 01:11:02,797
There's this guy. This weak,
greedy, fucking corrupt asshole...

1136
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:05,114
...that you fall for, that you leave me for.

1137
01:11:05,284 --> 01:11:08,003
You get all crazy about him.
Then I tell you he's dead...

1138
01:11:08,084 --> 01:11:12,635
...and you have less of a reaction than
if I told you a squirrel was hit by a van.

1139
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,112
-You know about this?
-No, I don't.

1140
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:18,923
Don't lie,
'cause I can tell when you're lying.

1141
01:11:19,524 --> 01:11:20,798
How was he killed?

1142
01:11:20,884 --> 01:11:23,352
-I didn't say he was killed.
-Yeah, you did.

1143
01:11:23,444 --> 01:11:25,514
I said he was dead.
I never said he was killed.

1144
01:11:25,604 --> 01:11:27,276
It's the way you were saying it.

1145
01:11:27,364 --> 01:11:30,037
You're lying to me.
You know about this, don't you?

1146
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,360
I never said he was killed.
I said he was dead.

1147
01:11:32,444 --> 01:11:34,958
-Did you have something to do with it?
-No. Did you?

1148
01:11:35,044 --> 01:11:37,797
No. I can't believe we're having
this conversation.

1149
01:11:38,324 --> 01:11:40,884
I wish we could get together
and talk about us.

1150
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:42,363
How was he killed?

1151
01:11:42,844 --> 01:11:46,120
He was shot in front of his locker.
'cause he was a weak, greedy...

1152
01:11:46,204 --> 01:11:49,037
...bribe-taking motherfucker. That's why.

1153
01:11:50,044 --> 01:11:52,638
-How would you know that?
-How would I know that?

1154
01:11:54,964 --> 01:11:57,034
There's stuff I know that you don't know.

1155
01:11:57,164 --> 01:11:58,802
-What's your name?
-What?

1156
01:11:58,884 --> 01:12:01,478
After you became a detective,
did you change your name?

1157
01:12:01,604 --> 01:12:03,117
-Yeah.
-To what name?

1158
01:12:04,644 --> 01:12:06,919
-To what name?
-Mark Clear.

1159
01:12:14,004 --> 01:12:16,234
-You fucking Rich Bower?
-Fuck you!

1160
01:12:16,324 --> 01:12:18,554
-You're fucking Bower, right?
-Fuck you!

1161
01:12:18,644 --> 01:12:21,283
Let me get this straight. Dean told you...

1162
01:12:21,364 --> 01:12:24,959
...then you told Rich 'cause it turned
you off that Dean would be so weak...

1163
01:12:25,044 --> 01:12:28,514
...to actually open up to you.
Like when I left, you considered it weak...

1164
01:12:28,604 --> 01:12:30,799
...that I'd do something to change my life.

1165
01:12:30,884 --> 01:12:33,637
To actually turn my life around.
That's weak!

1166
01:12:34,204 --> 01:12:35,956
You're so fucking twisted.

1167
01:12:36,044 --> 01:12:39,400
Don't you get it?
God! You haven't changed.

1168
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:43,354
You're the same guy,
except now you're hiding behind a badge.

1169
01:12:46,164 --> 01:12:48,359
So when are you gonna come back to me?

1170
01:12:51,604 --> 01:12:54,118
Why is that so crazy?

1171
01:13:22,204 --> 01:13:25,799
In local news, the killer of City Rider
Dean Carter is still at large.

1172
01:13:25,884 --> 01:13:28,523
Police continue to investigate
this tragic shooting.

1173
01:13:28,684 --> 01:13:30,834
Carter was found dead
outside his locker room...

1174
01:13:30,924 --> 01:13:32,437
...a gunshot wound to the chest.

1175
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:36,358
If you have any information,
please call our crime watch hotline.

1176
01:13:36,564 --> 01:13:40,000
555-1234.

1177
01:13:40,284 --> 01:13:42,036
And now, for the weather.

1178
01:13:42,124 --> 01:13:45,594
Once again, it will be mild tonight
with temperatures in the 50s.

1179
01:13:48,084 --> 01:13:50,200
Did you know I got locked up in Memphis?

1180
01:13:50,324 --> 01:13:52,679
-What the fuck were you doing?
-Being black.

1181
01:13:52,804 --> 01:13:53,919
You're right.

1182
01:13:54,004 --> 01:13:57,519
In the South, you've gotta figure
what time it is and where you're at.

1183
01:13:57,644 --> 01:14:00,363
I was in the middle of the street
signing autographs.

1184
01:14:00,444 --> 01:14:03,754
Nigger pulled up, pulls me over to the side.

1185
01:14:04,324 --> 01:14:07,077
Came back and just maced me
over the top.

1186
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:09,799
Maced me right in my eyes.

1187
01:14:09,924 --> 01:14:11,755
Shit was burning, face on fire.

1188
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:16,243
And they locked me up after that.
It was bad though.

1189
01:14:16,324 --> 01:14:18,474
You got up out of that shit.

1190
01:14:18,964 --> 01:14:21,956
Then I served my night,
went to see the judge.

1191
01:14:22,044 --> 01:14:23,477
A night for what?

1192
01:14:23,604 --> 01:14:27,483
A night for obstruction of traffic
and motherfucking resisting arrest.

1193
01:14:30,484 --> 01:14:33,237
It was bad,
but they did it because I was black.

1194
01:14:33,324 --> 01:14:35,474
That's where Martin Luther King got killed.

1195
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:44,274
Loving you, biting the ear and shit.

1196
01:14:44,364 --> 01:14:45,638
My nigga.

1197
01:14:46,324 --> 01:14:47,723
Look what you did.

1198
01:14:47,804 --> 01:14:51,194
My niggas burning each other up,
dropping shit on my rug.

1199
01:14:52,204 --> 01:14:54,923
Damn, man! Come on, man!

1200
01:14:55,004 --> 01:14:57,882
I'm lucky you all know I got cash pool.

1201
01:15:00,124 --> 01:15:03,514
You got these cats disrespecting your crib.

1202
01:15:03,644 --> 01:15:07,239
It ain't no disrespect, it was an accident.
You know how I play the game.

1203
01:15:07,764 --> 01:15:11,074
I don't know about that thing
we discussed at the gym.

1204
01:15:11,204 --> 01:15:13,081
When you moved on this kid, what's up?

1205
01:15:13,204 --> 01:15:15,672
Did you take care of it
on your own or what?

1206
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:18,113
-I hired somebody to do the shit.
-Hired who?

1207
01:15:19,084 --> 01:15:21,439
A brother member, a family member?

1208
01:15:21,524 --> 01:15:23,719
Not your brother or my brother.

1209
01:15:23,924 --> 01:15:26,882
That's a bad move.
You're playing dirty pool.

1210
01:15:27,204 --> 01:15:28,683
What are you talking about?

1211
01:15:28,804 --> 01:15:32,479
You can't send no child to do a man's job.
You have to handle it on your own.

1212
01:15:32,644 --> 01:15:35,283
As soon as he needs a fix or something,
you're burned.

1213
01:15:35,404 --> 01:15:38,635
You don't know nothing about him,
what his weakness is.

1214
01:15:38,804 --> 01:15:41,716
I'm just trying to save your ass.
You got somebody to do it--

1215
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:45,922
Save my ass? Come on, man.
I was taking your advice.

1216
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:48,120
But you wasn't man enough
to do it yourself.

1217
01:15:48,204 --> 01:15:50,479
You gotta be a man.
When you make moves--

1218
01:15:50,604 --> 01:15:53,198
You're assassinating my character.

1219
01:15:53,284 --> 01:15:56,082
Assassinating your character?
Your manhood?

1220
01:15:56,164 --> 01:15:58,997
-You got some kid you don't know, l--
-I know him!

1221
01:15:59,244 --> 01:16:02,281
-Hi. Is this District Attorney King?
-Yes, it is.

1222
01:16:02,884 --> 01:16:05,637
I'm Mark Clear.
I'm a detective with the NYPD, sir.

1223
01:16:05,724 --> 01:16:09,433
I have a bit of information
about your son Will...

1224
01:16:09,684 --> 01:16:11,879
...that I'd like to meet you about.

1225
01:16:12,884 --> 01:16:14,954
What information are we talking about?

1226
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:19,121
It's very important.
I think I should meet you in person.

1227
01:16:19,484 --> 01:16:22,635
I'm free from 2:00 to 2:30
tomorrow afternoon.

1228
01:16:22,724 --> 01:16:26,876
No, tomorrow isn't good.
I'd say in an hour would be best.

1229
01:16:26,964 --> 01:16:28,602
Right away would be really good.

1230
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:31,756
You should drop everything
you're doing right now and meet me.

1231
01:16:31,844 --> 01:16:33,436
If you know what I mean.

1232
01:16:35,204 --> 01:16:37,479
So where's your friend Charlie?

1233
01:16:37,964 --> 01:16:39,795
She don't want none of this dick today?

1234
01:16:39,884 --> 01:16:41,237
She's angry at you.

1235
01:16:41,324 --> 01:16:43,121
What the fuck she angry about?

1236
01:16:43,204 --> 01:16:46,833
-Because of the other night.
-What happened the other night?

1237
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:49,321
You disrespected her.

1238
01:16:50,404 --> 01:16:52,599
She got what her hand called for.

1239
01:16:53,204 --> 01:16:56,753
Anyway, you think
I can't satisfy you by myself?.

1240
01:16:56,844 --> 01:16:59,563
-I don't know.
-Why don't you let me show you?

1241
01:16:59,644 --> 01:17:03,159
You can show me. But I still think
of you and Charlie as a team.

1242
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:23,203
Oh, shit.

1243
01:17:35,524 --> 01:17:36,593
Mr. King?

1244
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:41,081
-Hi, I'm Mark Clear. How you doing?
-Can I see some...

1245
01:17:42,004 --> 01:17:43,881
...identification?

1246
01:17:48,604 --> 01:17:50,913
I'm a detective with the 15th Precinct.

1247
01:17:53,364 --> 01:17:55,400
I have some photographs to show you.

1248
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:59,194
You heard about the murder
of that basketball player, Dean, from City?

1249
01:17:59,284 --> 01:18:03,914
Yes, I've heard of it. I'll be prosecuting
the case as soon as we catch the killer.

1250
01:18:04,364 --> 01:18:06,798
-Can I see the photographs?
-Yeah.

1251
01:18:16,204 --> 01:18:20,834
Those were taken about two minutes
after your son shot and killed the victim.

1252
01:18:22,124 --> 01:18:24,160
I don't want to arrest your son.

1253
01:18:24,284 --> 01:18:27,117
Does anyone else know
about these photographs?

1254
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,359
Nobody.

1255
01:18:28,444 --> 01:18:30,674
-What do you want?
-Redemption.

1256
01:18:31,724 --> 01:18:34,921
-I'm a D.A., I'm not a priest.
-That's why you can help me.

1257
01:18:35,004 --> 01:18:38,599
A priest can't help me here.
Let me tell you something about myself.

1258
01:18:39,084 --> 01:18:42,713
My dad is a lawyer.
He's a very liberal lawyer.

1259
01:18:42,804 --> 01:18:46,160
My mom was involved in voter registration
in the South in the '60s.

1260
01:18:46,244 --> 01:18:48,804
She put her life on the line
for causes she believed in.

1261
01:18:48,884 --> 01:18:51,637
I went a different way
and became a gambler and a cheat...

1262
01:18:51,724 --> 01:18:54,033
...l stole, basically, did everything wrong.

1263
01:18:54,124 --> 01:18:57,799
I was rebelling against what they were.
I don't know whatever the hell it was.

1264
01:18:57,964 --> 01:19:02,321
I also was very creative as a kid.
I actually made guitars.

1265
01:19:02,484 --> 01:19:04,520
I made my own clothes.
I'm good with my hands.

1266
01:19:04,604 --> 01:19:06,959
I can talk my way in and out
of a lot of situations.

1267
01:19:07,044 --> 01:19:11,117
It's gotten me into trouble a lot in my life.
It's also done incredibly well for me.

1268
01:19:13,684 --> 01:19:15,595
Have you ever heard of...

1269
01:19:16,524 --> 01:19:19,436
...Saul of Tarsus?
Do you know who that was in the Bible?

1270
01:19:19,644 --> 01:19:21,441
He became St. Paul the Apostle.

1271
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:23,992
He was an epileptic
who had this conversion.

1272
01:19:24,084 --> 01:19:26,962
He decided not to persecute Christians
but to become one.

1273
01:19:27,044 --> 01:19:31,435
The most zealous Christian ever.
Six years ago, I had a big change in my life.

1274
01:19:33,004 --> 01:19:34,596
I decided to become a cop.

1275
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:39,243
I had this girlfriend who was just
not even a fucking girlfriend.

1276
01:19:39,324 --> 01:19:41,679
She was more like the only woman
I ever loved.

1277
01:19:41,884 --> 01:19:45,001
She was just really fucking with my head.

1278
01:19:45,164 --> 01:19:47,632
I think she got off on the fact
that I was a criminal.

1279
01:19:47,724 --> 01:19:51,080
And when I had a change in my life,
when I decided to do something...

1280
01:19:51,164 --> 01:19:54,281
...to persecute these fuckers....
When I became who I am now...

1281
01:19:54,364 --> 01:19:57,436
...she couldn't deal with it, she left.
She left and she--

1282
01:19:57,684 --> 01:20:01,154
-What do you want from me?
-I'm trying to explain what I want.

1283
01:20:01,244 --> 01:20:03,633
I'm leaving in one minute.
What do you want?

1284
01:20:03,724 --> 01:20:07,273
I want to explain to you.
Before I became a cop, I was a gambler...

1285
01:20:07,364 --> 01:20:09,958
...l got involved
in some very bad situations.

1286
01:20:10,044 --> 01:20:12,433
There's one situation
that I got involved with...

1287
01:20:12,524 --> 01:20:15,084
...that's coming back now,
it'll come across your desk.

1288
01:20:15,164 --> 01:20:18,315
This guy named Jimmy Fordo.
There's a basketball fix.

1289
01:20:18,404 --> 01:20:19,598
I know the case.

1290
01:20:19,884 --> 01:20:24,036
I think I understand
where you're leading this.

1291
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:29,114
Do you? 'Cause there's a really
simple solution to this problem here.

1292
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:32,600
I can help your son out, you can
help me out, we can help each other.

1293
01:20:32,684 --> 01:20:34,117
I don't know.

1294
01:20:34,604 --> 01:20:36,003
What you don't...

1295
01:20:37,044 --> 01:20:39,512
...know about my son and me is that...

1296
01:20:42,484 --> 01:20:44,520
...we're not close.

1297
01:20:47,284 --> 01:20:48,433
Will and l...

1298
01:20:49,724 --> 01:20:52,318
...we haven't seen each other
for two years.

1299
01:20:52,884 --> 01:20:56,354
I don't know if I wanna help Will...

1300
01:20:57,444 --> 01:20:59,833
...and I know I don't want to help you.

1301
01:21:00,204 --> 01:21:04,516
But I will have to speak with my son
and I'll need some time.

1302
01:21:07,204 --> 01:21:08,842
All right. Okay.

1303
01:21:09,484 --> 01:21:13,921
I don't wanna tell you
how you wanna live your life...

1304
01:21:14,004 --> 01:21:16,359
...but I think you should help your son.

1305
01:21:16,484 --> 01:21:18,679
I think I can help you help your son.

1306
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:25,317
What do you want?

1307
01:21:27,084 --> 01:21:28,563
What's going on?

1308
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:31,678
What's up with you?
Why you out here like this?

1309
01:21:32,284 --> 01:21:34,593
I don't want those hands on me right now.

1310
01:21:34,684 --> 01:21:37,960
I don't know where they've been.
What's up with you and white girls?

1311
01:21:38,044 --> 01:21:41,036
-Me and white girls?
-You said you'd never go there.

1312
01:21:41,124 --> 01:21:44,514
You're acting like it's my girl or something.
What're you talking about?

1313
01:21:44,604 --> 01:21:49,075
I just had to walk in and see a white girl,
with hair down to her ass, blue eyes...

1314
01:21:49,164 --> 01:21:52,122
...with granny underwear
on with fucking flowers on them.

1315
01:21:52,204 --> 01:21:55,594
We ain't married or nothing.
I don't see no ring on your finger or mine.

1316
01:21:55,684 --> 01:21:58,596
I'm just trying to give you a reality check...

1317
01:21:58,724 --> 01:22:02,034
...on how you're living right now.
It's foul and disgusting.

1318
01:22:02,524 --> 01:22:04,833
Won't you come over here
and make my house a home?

1319
01:22:04,924 --> 01:22:07,154
I shouldn't have
to make your house a home.

1320
01:22:07,284 --> 01:22:11,562
-I told you how I felt a long time ago.
-You're used goods. I don't want you.

1321
01:22:13,124 --> 01:22:17,914
You know what you need? You need
to go inside and do some searching.

1322
01:22:18,324 --> 01:22:21,157
Figure out who the fuck you are
before it's too late.

1323
01:22:27,324 --> 01:22:29,519
Can you pop the trunk, please?

1324
01:22:30,444 --> 01:22:31,763
Thank you.

1325
01:22:40,724 --> 01:22:43,522
See you in a week. We're off to the South.

1326
01:22:44,164 --> 01:22:45,563
-Honey.
-What?

1327
01:22:45,844 --> 01:22:47,721
Come on. What's the matter?

1328
01:22:50,044 --> 01:22:51,557
-Please.
-I'm not sure.

1329
01:22:51,684 --> 01:22:53,322
I'm not sure that I'm going now.

1330
01:22:53,404 --> 01:22:57,238
-Don't do this again. Every time we fly....
-Just go solo.

1331
01:22:57,364 --> 01:22:59,798
Solo? What's the matter with you?
Get in the car!

1332
01:22:59,884 --> 01:23:02,034
-I'm not going.
-You are going. Stop it!

1333
01:23:02,124 --> 01:23:05,912
I am tired of living this lie. Every time
we got down there we pretend--

1334
01:23:06,004 --> 01:23:09,314
Stop it. Get in the car.
Just get in the car, okay?

1335
01:23:12,444 --> 01:23:15,720
I'm a come guzzler. Mike nailed it!

1336
01:23:15,844 --> 01:23:18,233
-Stop it! Okay?
-I don't wanna pretend anymore.

1337
01:23:19,164 --> 01:23:20,597
Richard, I'm gay!

1338
01:23:20,684 --> 01:23:23,437
-Richard does not care.
-Richard's known.

1339
01:23:23,604 --> 01:23:26,277
What do I do?
She's out of town with boys in here.

1340
01:23:26,364 --> 01:23:28,241
Am I a fag or what?

1341
01:23:28,324 --> 01:23:31,555
Stop it, please! So what? You're a fag.
Who the fuck cares?

1342
01:23:31,724 --> 01:23:34,318
Everyone knows but you.
You won't even admit it.

1343
01:23:34,444 --> 01:23:36,639
I do admit it. I admit everything.

1344
01:23:36,724 --> 01:23:39,761
I'm fine with it.
I am so fine with it. Stop it!

1345
01:23:39,884 --> 01:23:42,956
You're staying here. Get a life, get a man!

1346
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:45,678
You were so into Mike the other night.

1347
01:23:46,044 --> 01:23:50,242
You want a big black man,
not a little, stingy queen.

1348
01:23:51,084 --> 01:23:53,962
I was doing it for you,
trying to save him from hurting you.

1349
01:23:54,084 --> 01:23:56,120
You're the one that was
so excited about it.

1350
01:23:56,204 --> 01:23:58,513
You're in denial. I'm taking your bags out.

1351
01:23:58,604 --> 01:24:01,164
Can you pop the trunk again real quick?

1352
01:24:01,924 --> 01:24:05,553
It's like The Day of the Dolphin, right?
Where you say you don't love me.

1353
01:24:05,644 --> 01:24:08,158
Pa says he doesn't love the dolphins
because it's safe.

1354
01:24:08,244 --> 01:24:10,439
Pa loves cock. Sorry.

1355
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:25,164
I don't get it. I just don't fucking get it.

1356
01:24:30,564 --> 01:24:34,034
Just go! Go! Keep fucking going!

1357
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:39,677
He'll come back.

1358
01:24:46,524 --> 01:24:48,958
I really feel spooked about that kid, Will.

1359
01:24:49,044 --> 01:24:52,036
I think he's gonna be a threat
to us down the line.

1360
01:24:57,924 --> 01:24:59,073
Pop?

1361
01:25:07,684 --> 01:25:08,799
Billy.

1362
01:25:11,324 --> 01:25:12,359
Sit down.

1363
01:25:19,604 --> 01:25:22,880
Number one,
the motherfucking nigga pops is the D.A.

1364
01:25:22,964 --> 01:25:26,115
Forget about it. We gotta get away
from that kind of thinking.

1365
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:29,719
All that shit is in the past.
The only hits we're doing is on wax.

1366
01:25:30,044 --> 01:25:33,002
We ain't killing nobody no more,
you all understand?

1367
01:25:34,084 --> 01:25:35,676
A police officer...

1368
01:25:37,044 --> 01:25:39,000
...took these photographs.

1369
01:25:40,364 --> 01:25:42,082
He doesn't want you.

1370
01:25:44,204 --> 01:25:48,243
What he wants is,
he has a case coming before me...

1371
01:25:49,564 --> 01:25:51,361
...where he's indictable.

1372
01:25:54,164 --> 01:25:56,200
He wants me to throw the case out.

1373
01:25:56,324 --> 01:25:59,236
You know that white kid
wasn't right for that shit.

1374
01:26:00,484 --> 01:26:01,633
You know that.

1375
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:08,244
There's no way I'm letting you go to jail.
We're going to have a new beginning.

1376
01:26:09,204 --> 01:26:11,877
We can't do this shit. We're not doing it.

1377
01:26:12,884 --> 01:26:16,115
Let me take the stance for all of that.

1378
01:26:43,764 --> 01:26:46,358
'Cause he acting like
we don't know what time it is.

1379
01:26:46,444 --> 01:26:49,993
I don't see you working it, nigga,
for what you need to work 'em for.

1380
01:26:50,364 --> 01:26:52,320
A Detective Mark Clear.

1381
01:26:54,604 --> 01:26:57,641
This is Detective Mark Clear.
Now listen to me very carefully.

1382
01:26:57,764 --> 01:27:01,040
I know what you did.
I know everything that you did.

1383
01:27:01,724 --> 01:27:05,512
-I don't know what you're talking about--
-Shut up and listen, asshole.

1384
01:27:05,604 --> 01:27:07,959
You may think
you got away with what you did...

1385
01:27:08,044 --> 01:27:10,638
...and think, "My life is free now. "
Right? It isn't.

1386
01:27:10,724 --> 01:27:13,602
Sometimes people get second chances.
I got a second chance.

1387
01:27:13,684 --> 01:27:16,244
I'm Saul of Tarsus. I'm not gonna blow it.

1388
01:27:16,324 --> 01:27:19,236
You're gonna blow it.
Maybe not right away, but you will.

1389
01:27:19,324 --> 01:27:22,555
And when you do,
I'm gonna be right there to nail your ass.

1390
01:27:22,644 --> 01:27:26,114
I'm gonna annihilate you, asshole.
You're going the fuck down.

1391
01:28:45,044 --> 01:28:46,636
I am so fucked up.

1392
01:29:03,764 --> 01:29:08,679
In the Palaeolithic Era, people believed
that the female body was sacred...

1393
01:29:08,924 --> 01:29:11,154
...because it was creating a life on its own.

1394
01:29:11,244 --> 01:29:13,963
They didn't make a connection
between the sexual act...

1395
01:29:14,084 --> 01:29:16,359
...and a child being born nine months later.

1396
01:29:16,444 --> 01:29:21,074
So, for thousands of years people
considered that men were unnecessary.

1397
01:29:21,164 --> 01:29:23,359
Yes, okay, I know that's right.

1398
01:29:23,444 --> 01:29:25,241
They were decoration.

1399
01:29:26,604 --> 01:29:28,640
And women were everything.

1400
01:29:29,284 --> 01:29:31,878
They still are, baby, they still are.

1401
01:29:42,084 --> 01:29:44,962
I told everybody that your hair
and make-up look great.

1402
01:30:04,644 --> 01:30:07,363
Now there ain't no boundary.
We're all in it together.

1403
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:09,639
Black people, white people, Asians.

1404
01:30:09,764 --> 01:30:12,642
You know what I'm saying?
lndians, whoever.

1405
01:30:13,684 --> 01:30:15,800
You look on TV and see Japanese cats...

1406
01:30:15,884 --> 01:30:18,478
...hopping around, doing hip-hop,
singing your record.

1407
01:30:18,564 --> 01:30:22,113
There's a Japanese Cigar out there.
You ever thought of that?

1408
01:30:22,204 --> 01:30:25,594
I don't think a lot of people really
wanted this shit to exist like that.

1409
01:30:25,684 --> 01:30:27,481
And they have no control over it.

1410
01:30:27,564 --> 01:30:31,239
Nobody can manage hip-hop.
Hip-hop is just fucking hip-hop.

1411
01:30:31,324 --> 01:30:33,554
You got your morals
and your common sense.

1412
01:30:33,724 --> 01:30:36,158
You gotta bring out
the true talent in yourself.

1413
01:30:36,244 --> 01:30:39,475
It's all about getting up. Don't be afraid.

1414
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:45,796
