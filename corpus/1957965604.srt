1
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,588
- Morning, Boy.

2
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,784
- Oh, here he is.

3
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:37,652
- Good morning, Hank.

4
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,020
- Good morning, Aki.

5
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,387
Nobu.
- Morning.

6
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,255
Hey, look at this.

7
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,391
Bug bites me a lot, you know?

8
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,994
- I keep telling
Nobu that hiring you

9
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:49,296
was the best decision
we've ever made.

10
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,969
And after all this time, we
are still right.

11
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:57,205
- Don't think we had choice

12
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,374
since he was here everyday
strolling through the gardens.

13
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,376
- It's peaceful here.

14
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,412
That, and I like
workin' with you two.

15
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:09,917
- You ever get tired

16
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:12,820
of the same old
breakfast every morning?

17
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,021
- Hm mm.

18
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:18,425
- But nothing gets a day going
better than bacon and eggs.

19
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,360
- Leave him, Nobu.

20
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,530
He can make his own choices.

21
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:26,433
And why would he wanna get
high cholesterol like you?

22
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,468
- Oh, don't start nagging me.

23
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:30,738
- Sorry if I just
wanna keep ya alive.

24
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:35,042
- I'm fit as a fiddle,
Aki, right, Hank?

25
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,878
- Ha!

26
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,980
If you mean a garage sale fiddle

27
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:42,449
that no one's interested
in, then I agree.

28
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:45,787
- All right.

29
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,654
Good.

30
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,423
I'll see you out there.
- Okay.

31
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,461
- Wear a hat!

32
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,478
- I brought you
a new piece, Aki.

33
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,847
- A new friend?

34
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,348
- I thought you could
use another one.

35
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,383
- Let's have a look.

36
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,855
Oh, this one has a curious face.

37
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,424
I wonder what he's thinking.

38
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,827
- Oh, she.

39
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,963
- Of course, I see that now.

40
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,800
Maybe we'll call this
one Emmy.

41
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,872
Oh, Hank, it's the best one yet.

42
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:44,512
There are so many of them,

43
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,916
and I can't tell them apart.

44
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,355
But I know each one is unique,

45
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:58,659
and belongs,

46
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,494
just like you.

47
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,700
- Oh.

48
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,603
I get real dizzy.

49
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,139
Just needed for sit
down for a moment.

50
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,307
- You forgot your water.

51
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,174
- Ah, thank you.

52
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,781
Ah.

53
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,687
You used to count the log rings

54
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,023
instead of splitting
them, remember?

55
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,159
I used to do that, too.

56
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:49,997
When I was younger, my
father always got upset

57
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,766
when my pile was small.

58
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,037
What were the oldest
one you counted?

59
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,573
- 212.

60
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,276
- 212?

61
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,144
Wow.

62
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:05,846
180.

63
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:13,254
Each ring is a birthday
for the tree, adding up.

64
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,726
That's a lifetime of
reverse determination.

65
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,797
When you put your
finger on each ring,

66
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,766
what do you think the
tree might have seen?

67
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:28,903
- Lots.

68
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,039
- Who knows?

69
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,875
Maybe feuding brothers
who make peace,

70
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:40,181
a mother burying her newborn
baby under the shade,

71
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:45,219
or lifetime lovers sharing
first a kiss at the trunk.

72
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:49,757
How many summer mornings
have greeted this tree?

73
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,795
Not to mention, how many
creatures called this tree home?

74
00:09:56,831 --> 00:10:01,836
And timeline of life,
how fragile it can be.

75
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,239
It's on my fingertip.

76
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:10,845
When I count those
rings, I wonder.

77
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,115
- Me too.

78
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,722
- All right, bring another over.

79
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,326
- Shouldn't I start
splitting them?

80
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,028
- You will have plenty
time of that before.

81
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,197
- Before what?

82
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:32,833
- Before it gets
too busy.

83
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,772
Besides, it's good for the soul.

84
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,590
Have a good weekend, Hank.

85
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:09,857
- Thank you, Nobu.

86
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,794
- Are you going
collecting this weekend?

87
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:15,362
- As usual.

88
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,133
- If you find any mother
of pearl buttons out there,

89
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,434
pick me up one.

90
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:05,446
- Mwah.

91
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,313
- #1?

92
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:36,817
Aloha, #1.

93
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,540
- Delivery day, my favorite.

94
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:37,244
We got those special
order plants.

95
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:38,779
We've been waiting forever.

96
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:41,549
- Finally.

97
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:44,118
- Yeah, I got a
backlog of customers

98
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,821
to call to let them
know they are here.

99
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,157
You'll deal with the requests.

100
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:52,059
You start counting
and bring them in.

101
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,595
I will take this off your hands,

102
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:56,630
and start making phone calls.

103
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,533
- Sure.

104
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:00,668
I'm on it.
- All right.

105
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,343
- Nobu Hitahiashi,

106
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,945
how many times do I
have to remind you?

107
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:46,781
Wear a hat in the sun.

108
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,784
- I put sunscreen on.

109
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:51,619
- That's not enough.

110
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:53,721
Do you want another heatstroke?

111
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,122
- Ah, it was this one time.

112
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:58,626
- Ah, that's what everyone
says right before, "Ah!"

113
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:02,163
- Hey, will you stop making
the face if I put hat on?

114
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:05,332
- Your big brim hat,
not a baseball cap.

115
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:08,269
- I'm serious.

116
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:09,804
- And I'm Nobu.

117
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:12,640
- Very funny.

118
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,863
- Paid day off, paid day off.

119
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,033
- Ha!

120
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:42,036
- Paid day off.

121
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:07,027
- Hello.

122
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,336
You've had a long trip.

123
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:18,739
Bet you're thirsty.

124
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:25,779
It's okay.

125
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:49,436
It's not big or
fancy, but it's home.

126
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:53,007
I like to collect leaves.

127
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,411
Another hobby of mine.

128
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,915
That's where I sleep.

129
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:04,785
That's where I shower.

130
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:08,389
Uh, sorry, I wasn't
expecting company.

131
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:12,927
We'll make this
your home for now.

132
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,930
It belonged to a friend,
but he won't mind.

133
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:20,868
I'm Hank.

134
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,237
And you need a name.

135
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,907
Let's see, hm.

136
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,343
How about,

137
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:34,148
Jolene?

138
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:40,020
Jolene.

139
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:29,336
Something mossy?

140
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:40,014
Definitely leaves.

141
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:52,326
How 'bout some tree bark?

142
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:08,008
I could get used to this.

143
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:59,486
I dreamed that I was a rose
that grew inside of a boy,

144
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:07,327
close by a path none ever chose.

145
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:11,398
And there I lingered day by day.

146
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:17,037
Beneath the sunshine
and the shower,

147
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:20,608
I grew and waited there apart.

148
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:27,247
Gathering perfume hour by hour,

149
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,983
the story within my heart,

150
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:35,322
yet never knew.

151
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:37,692
Which is why I waited
there and grew.

152
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,730
I dreamed that you were a bee

153
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:46,300
that one day gayly flew along.

154
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,270
You came across a hedge to me,

155
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:55,242
and sang a soft lovebird song.

156
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:00,113
You brushed my
petals with a kiss.

157
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:03,585
I woke to gladness with a start,

158
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,089
and yield it up to you, bliss.

159
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:12,727
A treasured fragrance
of my heart.

160
00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:18,065
And then I knew that
I had waited there.

161
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:20,768
We knew.

162
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:33,213
How well did others
feel, I wonder?

163
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:05,345
- Oh, Hankyung.

164
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:08,783
- Hankyung, we gave
you an extra day off.

165
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:10,350
Go and enjoy it.

166
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:13,086
- Or feel free to move
some cactuses out back.

167
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,154
- Stop it.

168
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,759
- Sorry I didn't bring
you anything today, Aki.

169
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,561
- That's okay.

170
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:22,864
But really, you should
go catch a movie today.

171
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:25,332
Or even better, go
on a lunch date.

172
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,771
- What's this?

173
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:32,205
You meet someone?

174
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:36,544
Look at his face.

175
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:40,380
- I knew
there was something.

176
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:41,783
- I wanted you to meet her.

177
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,253
- I knew one day a cute
young woman would come along.

178
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:49,857
- Does she cook and clean?

179
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:51,158
- Uh-
- You gotta get

180
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:52,125
one of those girls.

181
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,796
- Why is that always a
criteria for you men?

182
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,798
- Don't ask me, it's
just the law's nature.

183
00:34:56,831 --> 00:35:00,902
- Would you believe I
put up with this for 35 years?

184
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:05,506
So, what's her name?

185
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:07,508
- Jolene.

186
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,777
- Jolene?

187
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:12,346
That's an old
fashioned name, Jolene.

188
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:14,515
I bet she will cook
and clean for you.

189
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:16,450
Sorry.

190
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:21,321
- I'd love to sit and
have coffee with her.

191
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,390
- I don't think
she drinks coffee.

192
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:24,224
- Tea?

193
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:25,560
Who doesn't like tea?

194
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:28,328
- Um, maybe not Jolene.

195
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:29,831
- Is she the one?

196
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:34,234
- I think
I'm in love with her.

197
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:37,471
- I knew one day
you'd find love!

198
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:38,338
Aw!

199
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:41,375
- Careful, there's Jolene.

200
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:43,210
She's right here.

201
00:35:49,517 --> 00:35:50,417
- Eh, that's a-

202
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:53,521
- That's Jolene?

203
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:58,392
We're very pleased to meet
you, Jolene, aren't we, dear?

204
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,162
- Couldn't be happier
for you, Hank.

205
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:04,899
- I could still
move those cactuses

206
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:06,868
for you if you're not 100%.

207
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:14,207
- I might have a little
dizzy spell the other day.

208
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:15,743
- And you didn't wanna tell me?

209
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:16,644
- It was nothing.

210
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,467
- This place makes
me feel small.

211
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:18,806
Like you.

212
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:26,681
Aki and Nobu, they're great.

213
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:32,019
They're special to
me, like family.

214
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:34,789
Love and support unconditional.

215
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:08,589
- Is that your favorite machine?

216
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:16,463
Yeah?

217
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:18,498
I have my favorite one, too.

218
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:19,734
XJ900.

219
00:38:20,902 --> 00:38:22,537
- Sounds futuristic.

220
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:24,471
- Thanks.

221
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:27,008
What do you call that one?

222
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:34,715
Guess you call it Out
of Order for now, huh?

223
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:41,421
Well, this is XJ900.

224
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:42,489
He's the best.

225
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,359
- Okay.

226
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:49,530
- I'm Sam by the way.

227
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:52,567
Well, Samantha, but I go by Sam,

228
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,401
much to my parents' disapproval.

229
00:38:55,503 --> 00:38:56,938
One syllable names,

230
00:38:56,971 --> 00:39:01,441
they're so much easier to
say and remember, so I'm Sam.

231
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:04,846
- Hank.

232
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:08,883
- There you go,
one syllable name.

233
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,518
I already have it memorized.

234
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:23,631
- You dropped this.

235
00:39:24,565 --> 00:39:25,600
- Thanks.

236
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:28,603
Can't have a missing
sock.

237
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:50,490
Do you ever wonder where
all the missing socks go?

238
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,427
- Sometimes.
- Right?

239
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:56,831
Maybe there's a
race of sock puppets

240
00:39:56,864 --> 00:40:00,433
that live beyond the dryers
in a parallel universe

241
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:02,603
trying to liberate other socks

242
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:05,072
from the clutches
of static zing.

243
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:09,010
I'm really glad you
picked this up for me.

244
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:10,811
I don't know what I would
have done if I had lost it.

245
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:11,679
- It's okay.

246
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:26,694
- Do you know how much
this sock means to me?

247
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,933
Do you know who this
sock belongs to?

248
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,168
Bill Murray.

249
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:37,238
- Who?

250
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:38,639
- Bill Murray.

251
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:43,010
You know, actor,
been in everything.

252
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:49,583
Seriously?

253
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,554
- Maybe if I see his face.

254
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:54,956
- Really?

255
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,657
Everyone knows Bill Murray.

256
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,162
Okay, I wasn't expecting that.

257
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:02,830
It was accidentally left here,

258
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:04,632
and I heard it's his favorite.

259
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,703
And since you saved it, I'll
let you hold onto it for me.

260
00:41:11,572 --> 00:41:14,575
- But what if he
comes lookin' for it?

261
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:16,077
- I'll tell him you have it.

262
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,879
Famous people have a way
of getting what they want.

263
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:52,713
- Hey, Boy.

264
00:41:52,747 --> 00:41:54,682
I want to introduce
you to someone.

265
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:55,616
This is Jolene.

266
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:05,192
Not Jolie, Jolene.

267
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:07,094
Hold on.

268
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,669
Jolene, this is Boy.

269
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:28,682
Yes?

270
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:29,750
Yes, she is.

271
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:41,729
What was that?

272
00:42:47,101 --> 00:42:48,602
Inappropriate, Boy.

273
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:52,840
Nobody thinks that.

274
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,681
Well, I don't agree.

275
00:43:05,686 --> 00:43:08,856
Okay, okay, now that
was just offensive.

276
00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:11,926
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

277
00:43:16,363 --> 00:43:17,932
Real classy, Boy.

278
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:23,337
Whatever.

279
00:44:51,258 --> 00:44:53,861
Aki, I couldn't find
you at the counter,

280
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:55,095
and the gate was locked.

281
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:01,869
- When Nobu and I
started this nursery,

282
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:04,939
we were gonna call
it Sunflower Farms.

283
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,810
I love sunflowers and I
really like that name.

284
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:15,783
But Nobu had his heart set
on Muddy Boots.

285
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:21,422
This nursery for me
has always represented

286
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:24,358
the feeling a sunflower
brings to the world.

287
00:45:26,794 --> 00:45:28,862
Bright, full of warmth,

288
00:45:30,798 --> 00:45:32,366
and I can't help but to wonder

289
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:35,936
what this place would have been
like had it been named that.

290
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,939
But it's too
late to change it now.

291
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,278
I got mad at Nobu this morning

292
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:48,048
for leaving the gate
unlocked, really mad.

293
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:52,820
I should've known better
but I couldn't help myself.

294
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,257
But it wasn't about the gate.

295
00:45:57,891 --> 00:45:58,492
- Where is he?

296
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:01,428
- At home.

297
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,531
- Is he okay?

298
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:07,334
- He's bedridden at the moment.

299
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:11,171
- What happened?

300
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:16,343
- An angry customer came in
when I was getting on Nobu.

301
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:20,314
The man was a real
you know what.

302
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:23,150
Calling Nobu all
sorts of nasty names.

303
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:27,488
The guy kept on
raising his voice,

304
00:46:27,522 --> 00:46:29,990
and Nobu had this
look on his face.

305
00:46:30,024 --> 00:46:33,227
I've seen that look before,
and I got really scared.

306
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:36,897
Nobu was shaken up.

307
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:42,469
I think he was still mad at
himself about the unlocked gate.

308
00:46:43,538 --> 00:46:47,207
This morning left him stressed
out and doubting himself.

309
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,945
I worry it may be
something bigger,

310
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:54,281
like the early onset
of Alzheimer's.

311
00:47:00,555 --> 00:47:03,891
I've realized that
I can't do it all,

312
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:07,995
worry about him,
and keep this going.

313
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:12,132
- What are you saying?

314
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:17,539
- After I brought Nobu home,

315
00:47:17,572 --> 00:47:19,507
he and I had a long discussion,

316
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:23,043
something we've had
to think about before.

317
00:47:26,347 --> 00:47:27,181
- What?

318
00:47:31,985 --> 00:47:33,487
- We are closing the nursery.

319
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:42,262
- I can fill in for Nobu.

320
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:45,633
- I wish it
was that simple, Hankyung.

321
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,605
Besides, we already
rely on you too much.

322
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:54,308
And now I have to tend to Nobu,

323
00:47:56,076 --> 00:47:58,580
and it's too much to
be at both places.

324
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:07,955
When we first opened this
nursery back in 1985,

325
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:14,094
we agreed to run it side by
side, 50/50, a partnership.

326
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,168
But if my partner isn't here...

327
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:25,139
- So, it's...

328
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:32,647
What will happen
to all the plants?

329
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,581
The garden?

330
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:38,586
- Everything will go, wholesale.

331
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:40,555
- And then?

332
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:45,993
- A commercial
real estate company

333
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:47,294
will probably buy the land.

334
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,102
- And the shop, the counter?

335
00:48:58,506 --> 00:49:00,073
- Not exactly sure.

336
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:05,179
- I love this place, you know?

337
00:49:11,018 --> 00:49:12,352
- Me too.

338
00:49:15,222 --> 00:49:18,192
- Working here is
like, it's like...

339
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,297
- Being with a family, I know.

340
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:29,136
- I love with working
with you and Nobu.

341
00:49:30,404 --> 00:49:33,240
- We know how much this
place means to you,

342
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:35,175
and we are so thankful.

343
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,681
Nobu and I made this
painful decision

344
00:49:39,714 --> 00:49:41,549
with your wellbeing in mind.

345
00:49:43,685 --> 00:49:44,519
So,

346
00:49:46,588 --> 00:49:48,623
your paychecks will keep coming.

347
00:49:50,658 --> 00:49:54,562
In fact, he is the
one that suggested it.

348
00:49:54,596 --> 00:49:58,098
Can you imagine Nobu happily
giving money?

349
00:50:05,072 --> 00:50:08,041
- It's gonna be hard not coming

350
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:10,778
to this place every
day, you know?

351
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:13,113
- I understand.

352
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:16,718
Have one last walk around.

353
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:20,788
Feel free to take
home any plants.

354
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:51,218
- Oh, what a day,
what a day, Jolene.

355
00:50:57,892 --> 00:50:59,259
A gift from Aki and Nobu.

356
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,261
A parting gift.

357
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,069
It's gonna be really hard
not going there everyday.

358
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:14,776
Working there was
more than a job.

359
00:51:18,345 --> 00:51:23,150
Guess you're my only
family now, right Jolene?

360
00:51:30,725 --> 00:51:31,559
Jolene?

361
00:51:48,308 --> 00:51:50,612
No.

362
00:54:43,518 --> 00:54:44,886
- Aloha, Hank.

363
00:54:47,522 --> 00:54:48,455
- #1?

364
00:54:48,488 --> 00:54:50,423
I thought Aloha meant goodbye?

365
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:54,929
Wait, am I dead?

366
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:57,832
- It also means hello.

367
00:55:00,101 --> 00:55:01,368
- Hello and goodbye?

368
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,473
That makes absolutely no sense.

369
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:10,410
- It depends
on the context.

370
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:12,547
Am I coming or am I going?

371
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:15,650
- I'm so confused.

372
00:55:17,585 --> 00:55:19,921
I don't know whether
I'm coming or going.

373
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:25,026
What?

374
00:55:26,393 --> 00:55:27,628
- Even in this head room,

375
00:55:27,662 --> 00:55:28,896
you're bloody hopeless.

376
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,736
- What is this place?

377
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,004
- This?

378
00:55:37,038 --> 00:55:39,106
This is life outside the bowl.

379
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:43,544
- What's it like?

380
00:55:43,578 --> 00:55:45,613
- Ugh, liberating.

381
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:47,380
I swim this way and that way.

382
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:49,684
I can go as high as I
want, as low as I want.

383
00:55:49,717 --> 00:55:51,418
No more counting
steps before I smack

384
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:53,420
my face in that cruel glass.

385
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:56,524
Best of all, I'm not
swimming in my own crap.

386
00:55:56,557 --> 00:56:00,061
Now, the world is my toilet.

387
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:06,567
- So how does this work?

388
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:07,835
Are you dead?

389
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:10,605
'Cause you're definitely
not alive back at home.

390
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:13,507
- I'm not sure,
but I do know one thing.

391
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:17,545
I've never felt more alive
in my entire existence.

392
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:30,658
- Do you know things?

393
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:36,097
I mean, were you imparted
with wisdom as you departed?

394
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:39,466
- You mean,
did my life flash

395
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:41,702
between my eyes when
that maniac ghosted me?

396
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:48,709
- I mean, do you know the
secrets of the universe?

397
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:53,581
- I do feel calm,
possibly enlightened.

398
00:56:54,649 --> 00:56:55,883
So, what do you wanna know?

399
00:56:57,051 --> 00:57:00,655
- Where do lost socks go?

400
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,558
- Of all the
biggest mysteries

401
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:05,660
in space and time,

402
00:57:05,693 --> 00:57:06,827
you're asking about a garment

403
00:57:06,861 --> 00:57:08,729
that whisks away
sweat from your foot?

404
00:57:16,003 --> 00:57:17,071
Over there.

405
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,016
- I wish I was
there to stop that cat.

406
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,484
- I have no hard
feelings towards the cat.

407
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:33,087
The cat's a cat,
the fish is a fish.

408
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,756
Cats eat fish, dogs eat cats,
it's the circle of life.

409
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:39,527
- Who eats dogs?

410
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,841
- How's life
inside your bowl?

411
00:57:53,874 --> 00:57:54,842
- What do you mean?

412
00:57:56,544 --> 00:58:00,514
- I mean you live
in an unnecessary bowl.

413
00:58:00,548 --> 00:58:01,916
Bloody hell, there's
a whole world

414
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:04,552
of possibilities just
waiting to be explored.

415
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:07,922
Some big, some small.

416
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:09,790
Some, eh, whatever.

417
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:12,593
But you'll never find out

418
00:58:12,626 --> 00:58:15,596
if you hole yourself
up talkin' to leaves.

419
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:18,566
- I don't talk to leaves.

420
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,902
- Uh, hi, are
you forgetting?

421
00:58:21,936 --> 00:58:23,637
I never left the bowl.

422
00:58:26,107 --> 00:58:28,242
- Okay, maybe one time?

423
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:32,580
- Never, ever
left the bowl.

424
00:58:34,682 --> 00:58:35,983
- Okay.

425
00:58:36,017 --> 00:58:37,752
Maybe sometimes I do.

426
00:58:39,587 --> 00:58:40,821
- Can we be
done with all of this

427
00:58:40,855 --> 00:58:42,757
so you can put
yourself out there?

428
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:46,660
- I guess.

429
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:53,934
- Watching you

430
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:55,870
from that bowl
day in and day out

431
00:58:55,903 --> 00:58:58,739
with nothing new or exciting
in your life, I worried.

432
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:01,742
- Thanks, #1.

433
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:07,281
By the way, I had no
idea you were female.

434
00:59:07,314 --> 00:59:08,149
- Hm.

435
00:59:09,283 --> 00:59:11,218
Well, I had no idea
you were either.

436
00:59:11,252 --> 00:59:13,187
- Wait, what?

437
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,789
- Aloha, Hank.

438
01:03:22,936 --> 01:03:23,871
- Hey.

439
01:05:07,374 --> 01:05:08,375
- Hey, Nobu.

440
01:05:16,518 --> 01:05:18,018
Good for the soul.

441
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:22,356
- Good for the soul.

442
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:26,528
Sorry about the nursery, Hank.

443
01:05:27,995 --> 01:05:29,096
- How are you feelin'?

444
01:05:31,131 --> 01:05:33,000
- Now or in general?

445
01:05:34,067 --> 01:05:35,302
- Both.

446
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:44,144
- Rested, but
feels like I should

447
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:46,113
be doing something productive.

448
01:05:47,314 --> 01:05:50,350
- It's okay to just rest.

449
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:55,389
- Yeah, I guess but in
general, I'm not sure.

450
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:03,330
Aki has me document the
day out on an index card

451
01:06:04,732 --> 01:06:09,169
what I ate, what time
I ate, blah, blah.

452
01:06:09,203 --> 01:06:12,640
It's annoying, but I get it.

453
01:06:25,553 --> 01:06:26,554
- Jolene died.

454
01:06:32,694 --> 01:06:34,061
- Aki told me.

455
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:40,167
Very sorry to hear that, Hank.

456
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,504
I know she was special to you.

457
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,442
- You spent a lot of
time at that nursery.

458
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:49,744
How's life outside of it?

459
01:06:56,818 --> 01:07:00,387
- Being in this bed has
given me time to think.

460
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,123
Maybe too much time.

461
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:07,194
I feel like a
weight has vanished,

462
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:10,698
giving me time to figure out

463
01:07:10,732 --> 01:07:13,267
the meaningful
things in my life.

464
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:22,175
Maybe Aki and I should have
closed the shop more often,

465
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,685
ventured out, seen
more of the world,

466
01:07:31,218 --> 01:07:33,453
or simply done nothing

467
01:07:34,556 --> 01:07:38,492
and just enjoyed
each other's company.

468
01:07:42,664 --> 01:07:47,367
I was going through an
old photo album, and me,

469
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:52,439
I was handsome fella.

470
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:05,285
I had a lot of
adventures, a lot.

471
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:11,091
Then the world grows smaller.

472
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:15,797
The nursery, the mortgage,

473
01:08:16,463 --> 01:08:20,233
the tax returns and on and on.

474
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:22,436
It seemed...

475
01:08:37,217 --> 01:08:38,218
- Adventures?

476
01:08:40,755 --> 01:08:41,589
- Yeah.

477
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,124
Yeah.

478
01:08:46,628 --> 01:08:48,896
That album reminded me again,

479
01:08:51,264 --> 01:08:56,169
there is a big world
out there full of new,

480
01:08:56,203 --> 01:08:59,373
and exciting possibilities.

481
01:09:02,242 --> 01:09:03,778
You never know.

482
01:09:03,811 --> 01:09:07,749
One day you're
walking in forest,

483
01:09:07,782 --> 01:09:12,285
the next you meet the
love of your life.

484
01:09:25,298 --> 01:09:26,768
Oh , don't worry.

485
01:09:26,801 --> 01:09:30,605
No sock of mine every
accidentally goes
missing.

486
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:39,379
Yokai.

487
01:09:41,683 --> 01:09:42,517
- Yokai?

488
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:46,486
- Supernatural creatures
in Japanese folklore.

489
01:09:50,424 --> 01:09:54,327
Yokai existing beyond
what he would see,

490
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:56,631
and when you aren't looking,

491
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:01,368
Yokai bring good fortune
to the human world,

492
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,405
but also wreak of havoc.

493
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:11,278
A physical trait of most
Yokai, their grotesque feet,

494
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:14,381
and so they envy
humans for theirs.

495
01:10:16,918 --> 01:10:20,822
Hatsuhana was a good
Yokai, but like all Yokai,

496
01:10:20,855 --> 01:10:24,391
she was very jealous
of the humans' soft,

497
01:10:24,424 --> 01:10:26,794
smooth and delicate feet.

498
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,899
She believed that because
humans wore socks,

499
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:34,367
as they were called,

500
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:37,437
they were able to have
such beautiful feet.

501
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:42,275
A Yokai from a neighboring
forest, Kusunoki,

502
01:10:42,309 --> 01:10:44,045
was in love with Hatsuhana,

503
01:10:44,078 --> 01:10:48,482
and observed her every
moment from a distance.

504
01:10:48,516 --> 01:10:51,786
Kusunoki watched
Hatsuhana cry daily

505
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:54,488
about her hideous
feet until he could

506
01:10:54,522 --> 01:10:58,391
no longer endure seeing
his love in pain.

507
01:11:00,327 --> 01:11:01,796
So he went to work,

508
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:05,332
crafting the most symmetrical
pair of socks in history.

509
01:11:07,068 --> 01:11:09,771
When Kusunoki gave the
socks to Hatsuhana,

510
01:11:09,804 --> 01:11:11,639
she was so very happy,

511
01:11:11,672 --> 01:11:14,474
but her happiness
would not last long.

512
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:18,946
Once in the morning

513
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,749
when she was bathing
in the age spring,

514
01:11:21,783 --> 01:11:24,986
a human took one look
at her cherished socks.

515
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:30,792
When Hatsuhana
told Kusunoki this,

516
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:33,694
he vowed vengeance
against the humans.

517
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:39,000
Joined by his
brothers and sisters,

518
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:42,369
the Yokai reigned
terror on earth

519
01:11:42,402 --> 01:11:44,806
in search of Hatsuhana's
missing sock.

520
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:50,845
Kusunoki presented each
missing sock to Hatsuhana,

521
01:11:50,878 --> 01:11:53,781
but the socks were
not the right match.

522
01:11:55,382 --> 01:11:58,019
- Why doesn't he just make
her a new pair of socks?

523
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:01,388
- Because of sock.

524
01:12:02,523 --> 01:12:04,859
Hatsuhana wore what's
made from love.

525
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:09,030
So, it can be removed
without its mate.

526
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:13,534
Kusunoki continues
to this day searching

527
01:12:13,568 --> 01:12:16,403
for its one true match,

528
01:12:17,572 --> 01:12:19,574
leaving millions
of people baffled

529
01:12:19,607 --> 01:12:21,576
by their one missing sock.

530
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:27,815
And so, Kusunoki came to
be known as the Sock Yokai.

531
01:12:30,685 --> 01:12:32,987
- What happens to the
socks that she rejected?

532
01:12:34,922 --> 01:12:38,425
- Kusunoki hides them,
never to be seen again.

533
01:12:39,594 --> 01:12:40,427
Me?

534
01:12:41,596 --> 01:12:45,733
The Sock Yokai thinks
he's outsmarted me,

535
01:12:45,766 --> 01:12:50,771
but I just enjoy wearing
mismatched socks.

536
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:59,580
- So, because of love
there's a missing sock?

537
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:02,083
- Absolutely.

538
01:13:02,116 --> 01:13:04,919
If you can come up with
more logical explanation,

539
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,454
I'll pick the farm.

540
01:15:36,637 --> 01:15:37,671
