1
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,265
They call it pizza, darling!

2
00:01:58,406 --> 00:01:59,664
Is it good?

3
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:03,757
It's just too messy to eat!

4
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,356
Five minutes till curtains up!

5
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:02,567
Five minutes!

6
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,676
"O blessed, blessed night!

7
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:09,754
"I am afeard...

8
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,840
"being in night...

9
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,567
"all this is but a dream...

10
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:15,614
"too flattering sweet
to be substantial.

11
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,362
"A thousand times the worse
to want thy light.

12
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,081
"love goes toward love
as schoolboys from their books...

13
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:26,159
"but love from love, toward school,
with heavy hearths...

14
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:38,393
Absolutely the most beautiful Juliet
I have ever seen.

15
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:40,737
Oh, Tom...

16
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:44,706
Are the vultures outside?

17
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,745
I think everyone must have gone
straight to the party.

18
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:52,697
Well, why don't you go out ahead,
I'll join you later.

19
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:54,371
I'm...

20
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,534
I'm still in a daze...

21
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:58,854
You were magnificent.

22
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,151
Magnificent.
And nothing you can say...

23
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,651
Will ever change my mind...

24
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:08,808
Hurry!

25
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:22,032
I haven't seen such bravery
since Dunkirk.

26
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:24,054
Didn't we loose at Dunkirk?

27
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,821
But fabulously played.

28
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,789
Oh, Christopher, I didn't even know
you were in town!

29
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:32,588
And my darling Guido...

30
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:34,651
Siete bellissima!

31
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:36,807
Ah, you're a beautiful lier!

32
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,807
Be angels, will you both go
and find Tom at the party?

33
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:42,204
- And face those monster?
- Please, for me...

34
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:45,193
I'm terrified he will hit
anyone who criticize it.

35
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,620
You know, Juliet was his idea,
I couldn't talk him out of it!

36
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:51,704
I think I'm still 23 in his eyes,
God bless him!

37
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:55,580
No one was brave enough
to come back stage.

38
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:58,594
I think they are all going to
need a few stiff drinks...

39
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,362
Before complimenting me.

40
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:02,236
On my opening nights...

41
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:05,417
As soon as the curtains descends,
I hop on the first plane out of town...

42
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:06,735
Wherever it's going...

43
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:09,586
But as you seem to lack
a getaway vehicle...

44
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:13,330
It's best just to put on
your finest false smile...

45
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,891
And grin the bastards down.

46
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,696
I'll see you later...

47
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:34,547
Karen Stone, the beautiful
Broadway star...

48
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:37,939
Who graced many a hit plays
of the last 25 years...

49
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:40,977
Took a fall last night in
a Broadway disaster...

50
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:42,487
That wass bound for the book.

51
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:47,650
Whatever possessed our lovely
and intelligent Karen to imagine...

52
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:50,432
She was young enough
to play Juliet...

53
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:53,823
Will remain forever one of the
great Broadway misteries.

54
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,673
I wish you wouldn't read
that Francis Down.

55
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:57,862
Send him a note.

56
00:05:57,963 --> 00:05:59,823
"I don't know
what possessed me either."

57
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:01,549
"But I love you anyway."

58
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:04,792
Now, whose birthday is it?

59
00:06:08,354 --> 00:06:09,649
Horace Oliver.

60
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:11,946
Ah, the columnist
for the Detroit Star.

61
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,899
Send him a telegram, the usual...

62
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:15,985
Oh, and say I'm so thrilled...

63
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:19,008
That he recovered from his
operation so beautifully.

64
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,250
Anyone died yesterday?

65
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:24,985
Apart from Karen Stone
on the stage?

66
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:29,297
Mattie Osborne, the Chicago critic.

67
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,813
Hearth attack.

68
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,290
Oh, flowers and condolences!

69
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,735
I didn't know
that she had a hearth.

70
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,852
Well, at least no one else
will be reviewing you in Chicago.

71
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:45,196
No one will review me in Chicago,
I cancelled the tour.

72
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:49,009
You know, I'm very worried
about Tom's health...

73
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,399
He's so tired!

74
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,392
I think he needs a long holiday.

75
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,752
Will you be returning
in a new play next season?

76
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:22,768
Gary, I'm afraid not.

77
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:25,268
I'm retairing from the stage.

78
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:27,018
Are you serious?

79
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:29,353
Yes, I am serious, Red.

80
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,400
My husband needs me now
and he's much more important...

81
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:33,900
Than my silly career.

82
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:36,361
So, we're going
on a long vacation...

83
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:39,189
To Europe and Asia.
I just want him to be well.

84
00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:40,760
She's spoiling me!

85
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,807
All right, that's enough guys,
come on...

86
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:44,908
You wouldn't want
us to miss our boat!

87
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:47,768
Good bye!

88
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:06,578
Oh, you mustn't catch a chill!

89
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,336
- Doctor's orders!
- All right.

90
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,102
What is it, Tom?
What's the matter?

91
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:26,477
I... I...

92
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,430
It's just that....

93
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:34,038
I've been such a bad husband
for you these years...

94
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:37,203
When it comes to...

95
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:39,547
When it comes to the physical...

96
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,141
I.. I... am sorry.
I'm so sorry, I...

97
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:47,422
Listen: If I wanted to
live like an animal...

98
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:49,446
I would have married an animal.

99
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:51,094
Instead I married...

100
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:54,875
The kindest man there is.

101
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,555
I'm so sorry, Karen!

102
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,899
There you go.

103
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:12,156
I love you.
I love you...

104
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:13,330
So much!

105
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:18,836
It's all right!

106
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:31,194
Yor reputation here, Mrs Stone,
is of a great actress.

107
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,805
You must have been
talking to my husband.

108
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:38,173
It is unusual for a man
tro praise his wife.

109
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,954
Tom has collected every
newspaper cutting..

110
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,095
Every review
I have ever received.

111
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:45,173
I wonder where he is...

112
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,993
Oh, I'm sorry,
would you excuse me?

113
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,251
Christopher...

114
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:05,720
Baby!

115
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:08,180
What a beautiful surprise!

116
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,876
What are you doing in Rome?

117
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,384
In transit, of course,
it's always in transit.

118
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:17,118
Guido is taking me to Sicily
to meet his family...

119
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:18,906
A dismal prospect.

120
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:21,266
But I am finally working
on my new play.

121
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:24,031
My, don't you look lovely?

122
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:25,704
Where is Tom?

123
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:29,031
He has probably found someone
who understands Wall Street.

124
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:31,829
Meanwhile he has landed
me with some old harpy...

125
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:33,716
Who forced a card upon him.

126
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:35,992
Oh, yes, the Contessa.

127
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,368
She forces her card
upon everyone.

128
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:40,079
Contessa?
Contessa who?

129
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,197
Who knows who?

130
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,688
Everyone here has a title
with a long name...

131
00:10:43,714 --> 00:10:45,760
Running after it like a poodle.

132
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,209
Eredited in her case I
believe, from an ancestor...

133
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:50,912
Who was a male whore...

134
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:53,541
Noted for the lenght
of his appendage.

135
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:57,555
Who received his title in
payment for services rendered.

136
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:00,022
- It's a slander!
- Well, it's true!

137
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:01,806
At least is gossip!

138
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:07,461
Baby, this party is crawling
with stately witches...

139
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:08,470
And dandies...

140
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:12,123
Who despite their elegance are really
just hookers ot pimps.

141
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,336
There's been a war, after all...

142
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:15,837
Remember the war?

143
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,852
You were playing in
"This Above All".

144
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:21,009
At least during most of it.

145
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:23,850
All that's left to Society
anywhere in Europe...

146
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:26,291
Is the well dressed people
with something to sell.

147
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,005
Ah, now, over there...

148
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:32,352
The most beautiful
young man in Rome!

149
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:35,785
Everyone fancies him,
male or female.

150
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,586
He is with Mrs Jameson Walker,
whose husband owns Texas...

151
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,951
He must be costing her
a pretty penny!

152
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:44,545
You're not looking!

153
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:46,376
I'm not remotely interested.

154
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:48,414
There are things in life
that are more important.

155
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,482
Such as?

156
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:51,967
Don't ask difficult questions,
let's find Tom!

157
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,384
Oh, yes!

158
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:04,345
Thank you!

159
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,930
Her name is Karen Stone...

160
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:13,936
Evidently a terrible actress,
but her husband is very rich.

161
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,266
This rich?

162
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:18,360
Rubies.

163
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,399
Oh, great!

164
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:34,704
Like a dove!

165
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:37,998
Oh, it's beautiful!

166
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,872
Shouldn't I have
something a little darker?

167
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,102
Why?

168
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,595
It might make me look
a little thinner.

169
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:45,469
Weight suits you, darling.

170
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,884
As does grey, trust me.

171
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:01,764
Well, how do I look?

172
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,157
Very handsome.

173
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:10,990
So how do I look?

174
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,610
Beautiful!

175
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:15,845
Absolutely beautiful.

176
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:01,587
Tom, are you feeling badly?

177
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:07,759
My husband is hill!

178
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,740
Tell the pilot, we have
to make a landing!

179
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,204
Your husband has fainted.

180
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:20,727
No! please...
You have to land!

181
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:22,688
You have to land,
there is an island!

182
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:27,766
Island!
Island!

183
00:14:27,897 --> 00:14:29,009
Please!
Sit down please!

184
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,720
You have to make a landing!
You have to make a landing!

185
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:33,595
- You have to!
- Signora, please!

186
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,812
Island!

187
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:56,766
Sometimes you surprise me.

188
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,597
Is that so?

189
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,916
Is this where Tom would
want his soul to linger?

190
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:03,722
Tom didn't believe in souls.

191
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:07,813
But he was a christian, and he loved
theater, and this is the ultimate...

192
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,354
Christian theater.

193
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:12,587
This is where the christians
were devoured.

194
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:15,251
It goes with the territory.

195
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,305
I'm going to stay in Rome.
I'll take another apartment.

196
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:26,407
Can nothing tempt you
back on to the stage?

197
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:28,102
Only amnesia.

198
00:15:28,915 --> 00:15:31,134
- I have no talent.
- Talent?

199
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:34,626
Why, talent is the ability
to get away with something.

200
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:38,407
Of course it was a mistake
for you to play Juliet...

201
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:40,407
At the age of Lady Macbeth...

202
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:44,290
That wasn't better than all that
white stuff and them pearls.

203
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:46,891
Well, there is as you know a
tradition of older actresses...

204
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,360
Playing that roll.

205
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:51,587
But it is assumed they can act.

206
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:55,626
I was charming and pretty and
I had a certain flare...

207
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,001
And an enormous ambition...

208
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,595
And a wealthy husband.

209
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:01,290
Not to mention one's youth.

210
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:04,962
All of which is gone.

211
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:08,071
Poff!

212
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:10,557
Up in a cloud of smoke.

213
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:13,485
And all of which, I shall miss!

214
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,274
Can I give you a lift?

215
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:19,782
No thanks,
I'm meeting Guido neraby.

216
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,352
Peppo!

217
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:24,422
Thank you for coming.

218
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,308
What will you do?

219
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:30,788
Hello!

220
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:33,565
Contessa, this is Karen Stone.

221
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:36,187
Thank you so much for your
lovely letter of condolence.

222
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,093
Yes.

223
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:39,984
Yes, very sad.

224
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:42,070
Well, I have...

225
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:44,781
Decided to linger here...

226
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:45,979
A while.

227
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,729
And.. so, would you perhaps...

228
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:50,354
Care for tea, or...

229
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:52,776
Tomorrow afternoon?

230
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,609
Lovely, okay.

231
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,551
Lovely, I'll look
forward to that.

232
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:00,072
Thank you.
Bye-bye.

233
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:20,583
You are in the right city, Mrs Stone.

234
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,299
We understand loss, here.

235
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:24,815
Do you?

236
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,518
In our bones!

237
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,059
We make up for it
with substitutes.

238
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,302
How lucky!

239
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,035
Here's somebody
I want you to meeet.

240
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:35,684
Marco!

241
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,216
Vieni qua!

242
00:21:45,098 --> 00:21:46,263
Hello!

243
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:51,723
"A strange fascination...

244
00:21:53,091 --> 00:21:56,919
"There's a strange fascination...

245
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:00,692
"That is coming...

246
00:22:00,895 --> 00:22:08,224
"And takes me to a place
that I never knew...

247
00:22:09,982 --> 00:22:13,091
"Such a strange fascination...

248
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:19,216
"Or is one infatuation...

249
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,895
"I am falling in now with you...

250
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:26,591
"Strange fascination...

251
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:30,129
"Carrying me away...

252
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:32,872
Thank you, Lorenzo,
that was a charming evening.

253
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,122
I must speak to you, please.

254
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:39,466
Of course.
Do come in.

255
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,700
You have a problem...

256
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:46,317
Yes, my mother.

257
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:49,107
Her stomach.

258
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:50,669
She has...

259
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,435
Something in the way.

260
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,528
- A growth?
- Yes, a growth.

261
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:56,661
I'm so sorry!

262
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,130
They must operate.

263
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:00,270
But there is only one
doctor in Italy...

264
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,637
Who does this kind of operation.

265
00:23:02,154 --> 00:23:03,341
But he is in Naples..

266
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:05,325
And is very expensive
to send her there.

267
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:07,802
So I thought perhaps...

268
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,255
I know it is a big favor to ask,
but maybe you'd be...

269
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:13,169
Able to lend me
one million lire.

270
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:15,716
For my mother.

271
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:18,989
It would make me
grateful to you forever.

272
00:23:21,474 --> 00:23:22,833
It would make me...

273
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:24,739
Completely for you.

274
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:26,786
You see?

275
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:30,880
Yes, I do see.

276
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:35,989
One million lire,
that is a lot of money.

277
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:51,583
I think you have
misunderstood my desire...

278
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:53,606
For companionship.

279
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,606
A lady does not like to dine alone,
it is...

280
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,028
A foolish social prejudice,
but there it is.

281
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,849
I've known the Contessa
for some time now...

282
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,606
First she introduced me to...

283
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:10,028
Marco, then to Luciano, then to you.

284
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:14,388
Marco had a sister, Luciano a cousin,
and you have... a mother.

285
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:19,966
None of you understood...

286
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,848
Take this.

287
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,802
And now, I will say goodnight.

288
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:38,575
Sorry if I offended.

289
00:24:39,677 --> 00:24:42,177
You are nice boys, really,
all of you.

290
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,864
I won't be seeing you again.

291
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,950
Good night.

292
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:51,731
Good night.

293
00:25:01,004 --> 00:25:04,028
- And goodbye?
- Yes, goodbye.

294
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:08,692
I don't understand.

295
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,919
I mean, really,
I should stop seein you.

296
00:25:19,473 --> 00:25:21,317
Roman boys are so strange.

297
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:22,538
What can I do?

298
00:25:22,614 --> 00:25:25,528
But...
They are so handsome!

299
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:27,224
Yes.

300
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:28,958
But vapid.

301
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:31,153
Like the colorless actors
I worked with.

302
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,731
But don't you think a woman
sometimes needs a...

303
00:25:33,896 --> 00:25:34,796
What?

304
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:36,028
Love!

305
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:38,169
Define love.

306
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:40,272
Biting an ear...

307
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:41,560
Excuse me?

308
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:44,724
Well, that's only a pass,
then it proceeds downwards...

309
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:46,566
Contessa!

310
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:50,973
Cara mia, att my age one's thoughts
are primarily carnal.

311
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,208
Are you going to finish that?

312
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:56,020
- Take it!
- Thank you!

313
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,574
So, what do you think about it?

314
00:26:01,825 --> 00:26:03,161
Drift.

315
00:26:04,474 --> 00:26:05,598
What?

316
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,903
You walk into a room,
you walk out of the room...

317
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:12,348
In, out, what does it matter?

318
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:18,372
Drift.

319
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:39,317
Karen?

320
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,309
Karen Stone!

321
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:45,450
Karen it's Julia!

322
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,950
Julia!
Good heavens!

323
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:48,997
Oh, Julia!

324
00:26:50,802 --> 00:26:52,591
This is so fortunate!

325
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:54,919
We knew you were here,
but not where!

326
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,232
Greg and I are in town custom shopping,
you know how that's like!

327
00:26:58,309 --> 00:26:59,348
Yes, of corse I know.

328
00:26:59,388 --> 00:27:00,966
No one's heard from you!

329
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:03,192
Except that you're
living in Rome.

330
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,499
But why?

331
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:07,427
It's beautiful, of course,
but is...

332
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:09,380
All falling down.

333
00:27:09,817 --> 00:27:11,388
So old!

334
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,052
There's a little rumour
you're writing your memoirs...

335
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:17,654
No, that would be
a very slim volume.

336
00:27:17,818 --> 00:27:19,614
What are you doing here?

337
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,122
Drifting...

338
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,153
Along with the breeze.

339
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:26,840
Karen...

340
00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:28,770
It's a line from a song.

341
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,278
Are you all right?

342
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:34,599
- No.
- Well...

343
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,270
You must give me your number
and we can have a proper visit.

344
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:38,755
I...

345
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:40,731
Have something...

346
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:43,005
- Something?
- Yes!

347
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,247
In the way. Something...

348
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:47,114
In the way.

349
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:48,940
I don't understand.

350
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:50,935
- It's a tumor.
- Oh, my God!

351
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:52,357
Yes, I'm afraid it...

352
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,482
I'm afraid it's inoperable.

353
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,169
Karen.

354
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:57,716
You know...

355
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,661
I don't have long to live.

356
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,114
So you can see...

357
00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:04,372
I can't face visitors,
I need my privacy.

358
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:07,077
Where is it?

359
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:08,497
Where is what?

360
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:11,388
The tumor.

361
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:16,067
- It's in the womb.
- Oh, my God!

362
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:18,421
So...

363
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,044
I beg you, I beg you
not to visit me.

364
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,333
I must go.
You do understand, don't you?

365
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:27,677
Goodbye!

366
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:36,013
Thank you, Peppo.

367
00:28:46,817 --> 00:28:49,192
- I was ringing on your bell!
- It's you, of course.

368
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,614
- We were just in the neighborood.
- In the neighborood!

369
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:52,198
Of course!

370
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,111
I would like you to meet
a great friend of mine.

371
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,663
Are you Francesco?

372
00:28:56,724 --> 00:28:58,247
Pietro?
Alessandro?

373
00:28:58,355 --> 00:29:00,481
This is not I can see
a good time for a visit.

374
00:29:00,677 --> 00:29:01,806
You must excuse me.

375
00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:03,861
Oh no, forgive me I'm behaving
incorrectly.

376
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:06,927
I don't know, I'm just a little
lightheaded this afternoon.

377
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:08,489
Why don't you come in for tea.

378
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:09,942
We'd be delighted!

379
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:11,388
English tea.

380
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:13,856
I am Conte Paolo di Lio

381
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,989
It's a very distinguished family.

382
00:29:26,427 --> 00:29:27,723
Have we met?

383
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:32,928
No.

384
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:34,552
Please, come in!

385
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:36,341
Signora...

386
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:44,458
Muoviti!

387
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:20,401
A beautiful view!

388
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:22,479
Yes, it is.

389
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:26,096
Exellent chocolate!

390
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,034
Where?

391
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:30,026
In the biscuit.

392
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,557
Oh, thank you.

393
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:35,448
So...

394
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:37,055
Why was it light?

395
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,680
What?

396
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,909
Your head.

397
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:44,690
I...

398
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:47,487
I discarded something
this afternoon.

399
00:30:48,635 --> 00:30:49,555
What?

400
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,346
An old friend.

401
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:55,276
Yes, they weigh a lot.

402
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:57,438
I feel as if...

403
00:30:57,601 --> 00:30:59,276
As if the airline lost
all my luggage...

404
00:30:59,302 --> 00:31:00,783
And I don't really care.

405
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:03,095
But your luggage...

406
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:05,462
Did not have on it a label?

407
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:09,034
It fell off.

408
00:31:10,188 --> 00:31:12,119
So now you are free, then.

409
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:15,166
I suppose.

410
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:16,986
Like a bird.

411
00:31:27,211 --> 00:31:28,547
I suppose.

412
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:32,603
Weel, will you excuse me.
I got a...

413
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:34,410
- You have an appointment?
- Yes.

414
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:52,160
- This has been a charming tea.
- Yes, it has.

415
00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:02,441
It was lovely to meet you.

416
00:32:06,962 --> 00:32:09,636
Thank you for stopping by Contessa
and appreciating the biscuit.

417
00:32:16,962 --> 00:32:18,050
Bitch!

418
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,313
- It's been seven days.
- Six.

419
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:30,120
And she hasn't phoned you yet!

420
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:31,688
She's very proud.

421
00:32:31,797 --> 00:32:32,800
She's very stupid.

422
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,572
She looks in the mirror
and she doesn't see.

423
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:36,667
You must phone her.

424
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:38,011
Please don't be ridiculous.

425
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:40,009
The season is over, Paolo!

426
00:32:40,035 --> 00:32:42,243
- What season!
- Your season!

427
00:32:42,472 --> 00:32:45,599
The ruby cufflinks have been in the
pawnshop for five months now.

428
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:46,525
Four.

429
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:55,110
Not a single line.

430
00:32:55,415 --> 00:32:57,228
Then your eyesight
is failing you.

431
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,212
Beauty is a cruel gift.

432
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:02,032
Like snow in April.

433
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:03,813
Breathtaking and then...

434
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,899
The sun is out!

435
00:33:06,423 --> 00:33:08,227
I've not melted yet.

436
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:11,204
Dial!

437
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:13,329
Dial!

438
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:14,790
Paolo?

439
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:17,313
Of course I remember.

440
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,071
Your card is still in the hall
where you left it.

441
00:33:22,774 --> 00:33:24,282
How lovely of you to call.

442
00:33:24,938 --> 00:33:27,040
I would like very much
to invite you to dinner.

443
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,962
Well, how sweet.

444
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:32,540
Tomorrow night?
Let me just check.

445
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,173
Yes, yes it is free!

446
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:39,516
Eight o'clock?

447
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:41,782
I'll look forward to it.

448
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,531
Thank you.

449
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,047
Ciao!

450
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,696
Ciao!

451
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:52,493
Look what you made me do!

452
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,001
I had to invite her.

453
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,501
That means,
I have to pay for the meal!

454
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:10,142
It's not just
one season, Contessa.

455
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:12,501
You're wrong.

456
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:15,470
Not just one.

457
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:19,595
Good boy.

458
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:22,681
Thank you, Paolo.

459
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,110
I've made a booking.

460
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,266
- Booking?
- For supper.

461
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:27,774
- No, no.
- No...

462
00:34:27,823 --> 00:34:30,672
Bernini's. I dine there all the time.
We can dance there.

463
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:32,931
My dear Mrs Stone...

464
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:35,407
When you are asked out
by a gentleman...

465
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:36,826
He chooses the restaurant.

466
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:38,979
- Oh, no, but I thought...
- We will go to Trastevere.

467
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:39,909
Pepisco's.

468
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:42,360
- Pepisco's?
- Have you heard of it?

469
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,923
- No, no, I...
- Good!

470
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:45,212
Then you will be surprised!

471
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:04,375
Mrs Stone, this is
Mamma Pepisco...

472
00:35:05,124 --> 00:35:06,384
Papà Pepisco.

473
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,853
Let me help you.

474
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,767
This is like a family gathering.

475
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,751
Family is very
important in Italy.

476
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,157
Do you have a family?

477
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:26,853
Not anymore.

478
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,181
Well, it is sad.

479
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:30,798
If we don't have one in Italy,
we create it.

480
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:33,751
It was my late husband
that was my...

481
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:35,079
- Family?
- Yes!

482
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:36,399
But now he's gone.

483
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:40,618
The Pepiscos come from a small
village in Nothern Italy.

484
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,829
You know, my grandparents had
one of their houses there.

485
00:35:44,063 --> 00:35:46,767
The cuisine is very simple
but perfect.

486
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:49,509
Excuse me.

487
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:11,954
What were you talking
to her about?

488
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:13,220
I ordered!

489
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:14,642
How do you know what I want?

490
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:17,446
Please, Mrs Stone,
you must trust me.

491
00:36:17,931 --> 00:36:20,353
I guarantee you
a delicious meal.

492
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:27,368
This is one of the
oldest streets in the city.

493
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:29,649
Can you hear whispers?

494
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:32,384
No.

495
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:35,665
Voices from the past
through the centuries.

496
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,298
Years do not exist
for us, Mrs Stone.

497
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:40,982
Centuries do.

498
00:36:41,008 --> 00:36:43,235
I wish you wouldn't
call me Mrs Stone.

499
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:46,423
I have not yet the right
to speak you first name.

500
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:48,876
Oh, really?

501
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:50,696
How is that right achieved?

502
00:36:51,015 --> 00:36:52,017
By dancing.

503
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,001
Dance?

504
00:36:54,157 --> 00:36:55,057
Of course.

505
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:59,329
Well, is this an old custom,
one from your grandparents town?

506
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:00,954
You make fun of me.

507
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,660
- No, I'm sorry.
- Because that is what it is.

508
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:06,079
There was music every night
in the town square.

509
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:09,360
A violin, a trombon,
and drums perhaps, and...

510
00:37:09,985 --> 00:37:11,915
You know what?
Close your eyes.

511
00:37:12,454 --> 00:37:13,399
What!

512
00:37:13,603 --> 00:37:14,923
Just close your eyes.

513
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:18,837
There. Now...

514
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,439
Can you hear the music?

515
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:22,733
No, Paolo, I'm afraid I can't.

516
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:25,009
Please, please, you must
use your imagination.

517
00:37:25,258 --> 00:37:27,664
You are an actress after all,
surely you must hear.

518
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,548
Listen.

519
00:37:31,243 --> 00:37:32,642
There is a tuba.

520
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,834
Oh please, this is ridiculous.

521
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,204
Nothing is ridiculous
if you believe it is possible.

522
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:40,290
There are coloured lights
everywere.

523
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:43,032
Cafées, waiters and customers...

524
00:37:43,103 --> 00:37:44,821
Men singing, women laughing...

525
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,853
Kids are running
through the crowds.

526
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:49,813
And those little flying insects...

527
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,884
You know, that have
light on their backs.

528
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,259
- Fireflies.
- Yes.

529
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:57,345
And the lights go on and off.

530
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,446
On and off.

531
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:01,954
An accordion.

532
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:02,798
What?

533
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,204
I can hear an accordion.

534
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:05,196
Brava.

535
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,892
That means...

536
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,696
We can dance.

537
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,400
Thank you, Paolo.

538
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:28,596
That...

539
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:30,744
Was an enchanted evening.

540
00:38:31,235 --> 00:38:32,720
No, no, I thank you.

541
00:38:33,306 --> 00:38:34,572
I'm a lucky man.

542
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,814
Tonight I dasnced
with a princess.

543
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:38,994
Hardly.

544
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,337
In my eyes.

545
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,298
My eyes...

546
00:38:44,517 --> 00:38:45,736
Do not lie.

547
00:38:51,126 --> 00:38:52,142
Good night.

548
00:38:52,673 --> 00:38:53,798
Karen.

549
00:38:58,267 --> 00:38:59,431
Good night.

550
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:16,050
I know that she wants me.

551
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:18,021
Why doesn't she say
or do something?

552
00:40:18,511 --> 00:40:19,411
Patience.

553
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,401
Rome wasn't built in a day.

554
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:23,847
Perhaps not,
but at some point...

555
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:25,995
They laid the foundation.

556
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,456
Don't be vulgar.

557
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:35,936
And do you make love
to her every night?

558
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:38,889
What do you think?

559
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,811
You must have an important
appointment this afternoon.

560
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:49,335
No, I don't think so.

561
00:40:51,402 --> 00:40:53,717
In New York I always
had an appointment.

562
00:40:53,943 --> 00:40:55,952
One tries to be there
at a certain time.

563
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:56,899
Yes.

564
00:40:57,507 --> 00:40:58,655
Here never!

565
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,194
I'm just free!

566
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:03,702
To drift.

567
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:07,835
She's crazy about me,
she wants to marry me.

568
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:11,241
But you know me.
What am I going to do in America?

569
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:14,194
And is she richer
then Signora Coogan?

570
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:15,983
Absolutely.

571
00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:18,100
- And the baron?
- Oh, yes.

572
00:41:19,194 --> 00:41:20,803
Mrs Jameson Walker?

573
00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:22,506
Much richer.

574
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:24,428
And much more beautiful.

575
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:27,515
She's a very great actress.

576
00:41:28,264 --> 00:41:30,296
Everybody in America knows her.

577
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:35,585
Lovely, lovely!

578
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:37,280
Much more... young!

579
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,530
Thank you.

580
00:41:39,928 --> 00:41:41,733
Do you mind if I use
your telephone?

581
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:43,084
I'll pay, of course.

582
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:44,264
As you wish.

583
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,243
- Thank you.
- Ciao!

584
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:40,860
Stop, stop, Peppo.

585
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:44,313
I'll walk from here.

586
00:42:44,551 --> 00:42:46,056
Va bene, signora.

587
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:55,715
Is she coming here?

588
00:42:55,817 --> 00:42:57,458
- Who?
- That lady?

589
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,137
She isn't one of our patrons.

590
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:01,179
Don't you know who she is?

591
00:43:01,202 --> 00:43:01,728
No.

592
00:43:01,754 --> 00:43:03,372
She is the Signora Stone!

593
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:06,379
I disn't know she was
such a great lady.

594
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:11,723
She is not to great a lady
to take a turn at the pump.

595
00:43:11,887 --> 00:43:13,575
If the house is on fire,
that is!

596
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:18,786
Is she taking him
to America too?

597
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,846
Where did you learn?

598
00:45:40,893 --> 00:45:41,713
To sing?

599
00:45:41,776 --> 00:45:44,698
No, no, no, all Italians
can sing, I know that...

600
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,096
No, to play the piano!

601
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:47,619
Ah, my aunt tought me.

602
00:45:47,972 --> 00:45:49,261
She played for Ligechi.

603
00:45:49,573 --> 00:45:51,097
He was a very famous tenor.

604
00:45:51,425 --> 00:45:52,870
And he became her lover.

605
00:45:53,456 --> 00:45:56,323
But his wife one night discovered
them asleep in bed...

606
00:45:56,472 --> 00:45:57,979
And you know what she did?

607
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,120
She took a hammer...

608
00:46:01,549 --> 00:46:03,284
And she broke the hand
of my uncle.

609
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:04,940
Oh, that's awful!

610
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:06,956
My aunt is a beautiful person.

611
00:46:08,823 --> 00:46:10,401
Now I am unhappy.

612
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:12,354
Oh, no, no, you mustn't be.

613
00:46:13,174 --> 00:46:14,799
Rome is a cruel city.

614
00:46:16,128 --> 00:46:17,729
It is very foolish to sing.

615
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:20,713
It's good to try to be happy.

616
00:46:21,105 --> 00:46:22,105
Do you think so?

617
00:46:22,175 --> 00:46:24,448
Yes, don't be sad,
it doesn't suit you.

618
00:46:25,675 --> 00:46:27,369
Why don't you play for me again.

619
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:28,502
No.

620
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:30,385
I'll sing for you.

621
00:46:31,027 --> 00:46:32,534
A song from the South.

622
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:34,854
About a beautiful woman.

623
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:39,175
"Ohi, Marì...

624
00:46:39,276 --> 00:46:40,878
"Ohi, Marì...

625
00:46:41,323 --> 00:46:44,448
"Quanto suonno aggio
perso pe' te...

626
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:47,354
"Famme addormì...

627
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,812
"Abbracciato 'nu poco cu' te...

628
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,081
"Ohi, Marì...

629
00:46:53,237 --> 00:46:54,917
"Ohi, Marì...

630
00:46:55,495 --> 00:46:59,417
"Quanto suonno aggio
perso pe' te...

631
00:47:00,096 --> 00:47:02,815
"Famme addormì...

632
00:47:03,644 --> 00:47:05,464
"Ohi, Marì...

633
00:47:06,277 --> 00:47:11,784
"Ohi... Marì

634
00:47:21,823 --> 00:47:23,122
Two months...

635
00:47:23,276 --> 00:47:26,888
And all you receive
is one necktie.

636
00:47:27,497 --> 00:47:28,862
At least she buys you dinner.

637
00:47:28,939 --> 00:47:29,931
What about me!

638
00:47:30,003 --> 00:47:31,716
Last week I fainted
from hunger...

639
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,575
Smelling the food as I walked
in front of Rosati...

640
00:47:34,653 --> 00:47:36,386
And the Americans there
were rapt...

641
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:37,784
And smiled..
They...

642
00:47:37,972 --> 00:47:39,935
They think fainting is European.

643
00:47:40,706 --> 00:47:42,675
And then they gave
a beggar some coins.

644
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:44,948
Enough money
to feed me for a week!

645
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:47,152
Mres Stone is a great lady.

646
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,557
A very great lady indeed...

647
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:51,652
And cannot be treated
cinically like Mrs Coogan.

648
00:47:52,138 --> 00:47:55,067
There's no such thing
as a great American lady.

649
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,677
Great ladies do not
occur in countries...

650
00:47:57,703 --> 00:48:00,216
That are less then
200 years old.

651
00:48:00,755 --> 00:48:05,255
Your great lady was, I'm told,
an artistic mediocrity...

652
00:48:05,294 --> 00:48:07,310
She does non possess
real dignity...

653
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:08,683
Real pride...

654
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:09,989
You are malicious.

655
00:48:10,611 --> 00:48:12,231
I say I'm quite positive...

656
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,232
Her feeling for me is...

657
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:15,668
Yes!

658
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:16,958
Romantic.

659
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:18,513
But she's not a wolf.

660
00:48:19,081 --> 00:48:21,565
She's made no move
to get me to bed.

661
00:48:22,477 --> 00:48:25,708
I think you are infatuated
wit this Mrs Stone.

662
00:48:25,763 --> 00:48:28,252
Then I think you do sleep with her
and then you lie to me...

663
00:48:28,278 --> 00:48:29,896
And don't give me my percentage!

664
00:48:30,003 --> 00:48:32,521
Go away, you witch!
You will die in the black market!

665
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,982
I hope that puts you
out of business for tonight.

666
00:49:17,274 --> 00:49:20,907
Strangers come and destroy
this city all the time, cara mia...

667
00:49:20,977 --> 00:49:22,943
Little bit for bit.

668
00:49:24,907 --> 00:49:29,579
I understand that you've been seeing
a lot of young Paolo lately...

669
00:49:29,657 --> 00:49:32,052
And as your oldest
friend in Rome...

670
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:34,247
I think it is necessary
that I should tell you...

671
00:49:34,273 --> 00:49:35,925
A little bit more about him.

672
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:37,154
Do you?

673
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:39,329
I imagine you find him charming.

674
00:49:39,355 --> 00:49:40,712
Everybody does.

675
00:49:40,738 --> 00:49:42,840
He is the most charming
boy in Rome...

676
00:49:43,157 --> 00:49:47,016
But there are certain things that are
more important than charm.

677
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,888
What are those things?

678
00:49:49,837 --> 00:49:53,087
The true Roman qualities
are lacking in Paolo...

679
00:49:53,134 --> 00:49:56,235
And there is one thing that you
must keep in mind about him.

680
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:59,787
He is by way of being
a little "marchetta".

681
00:50:00,337 --> 00:50:01,357
A what?

682
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:04,126
That is our word for a boy...

683
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:05,720
Who has no work...

684
00:50:05,806 --> 00:50:08,396
And no money, but lives
very well without it.

685
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:11,615
How do you feel
about such people?

686
00:50:11,821 --> 00:50:13,834
Well, I have nothing
against them, although...

687
00:50:13,912 --> 00:50:17,016
I am pretty surprised that you
know someone like that.

688
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:22,341
Make sure you get
your money's worth, cara mia.

689
00:50:22,462 --> 00:50:23,774
That is my only advice.

690
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:26,654
I think that Signora Coogan
was very badly cheated.

691
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:28,368
Signora Coogan?

692
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:30,603
Didn't you know
the Signora Coogan?

693
00:50:30,657 --> 00:50:32,107
She's from America too.

694
00:50:32,537 --> 00:50:34,935
And last summer
she took Paolo to Capri...

695
00:50:35,344 --> 00:50:37,841
And they say she was the
only one in the party...

696
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:39,935
That he did not make love to.

697
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:46,943
Beauty has a world of it's own.

698
00:50:49,618 --> 00:50:51,243
It has a godly license.

699
00:50:52,837 --> 00:50:55,224
I know it only too well,
I possessed it once.

700
00:50:56,415 --> 00:50:59,115
And then the license
was revoked.

701
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:03,657
What church do you belong to?

702
00:51:04,837 --> 00:51:07,884
None. I was brought up
a methodist. Why?

703
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:12,013
Then he will probably
tell you the story...

704
00:51:12,234 --> 00:51:14,388
Of his friend and the
wicked priest...

705
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:16,357
Who operates
on the black market.

706
00:51:16,665 --> 00:51:18,162
What story is that?

707
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,915
He will tell you
how the wicked priest...

708
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:23,615
Cheated his friend
out of ten million lire...

709
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:25,023
On the black market.

710
00:51:25,556 --> 00:51:28,876
And he will try to touch your hearth
so deeply with this story...

711
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:32,540
That you will want to restore
his friend's losses to him.

712
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,876
Oh, I don't imagine I will be
touched that deeply.

713
00:51:36,532 --> 00:51:39,193
I may be touched,
but not for ten million lire.

714
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:43,310
You know, Americans aren't
as romantic as their motion pictures.

715
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,860
What a pity they aren't.

716
00:51:51,899 --> 00:51:53,747
That was a lovely afternoon.

717
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:55,974
Yes.

718
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,583
You seem sad.

719
00:52:02,556 --> 00:52:04,021
I have a headache.

720
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:09,530
No, I am sad.

721
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,472
Won't you come in?

722
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:30,852
Would you like a Negroni?

723
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:33,258
No, no.

724
00:52:34,032 --> 00:52:36,118
I don't want to drink.
If I do...

725
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:37,930
I will cry.

726
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:39,797
What about, Paolo?

727
00:52:41,806 --> 00:52:43,899
A terrible thing has happened
to a friend of mine.

728
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:45,508
Terrible.

729
00:52:48,938 --> 00:52:50,461
I'll tell you what it is.

730
00:52:53,345 --> 00:52:55,110
He was approached
by this priest...

731
00:52:55,196 --> 00:52:57,524
Who's very high up
in Vatican circles....

732
00:52:58,294 --> 00:52:59,702
And this priest told
him that he knew...

733
00:52:59,728 --> 00:53:02,258
About a lot of English and
American army supplies...

734
00:53:02,454 --> 00:53:04,172
Which could be sold
on the black market...

735
00:53:04,229 --> 00:53:05,601
At a great profit.

736
00:53:06,078 --> 00:53:07,578
So my friend gave the priest...

737
00:53:07,665 --> 00:53:09,149
Ten million lire...

738
00:53:09,196 --> 00:53:11,250
To buy up a lot
of this stuff, you know...

739
00:53:11,695 --> 00:53:12,935
But the priest kept the money...

740
00:53:12,953 --> 00:53:14,430
And my friend got nothing.

741
00:53:14,602 --> 00:53:16,399
And now, it turns out
that the priest...

742
00:53:16,445 --> 00:53:18,914
Has spent all the money,
the ten million lire...

743
00:53:18,969 --> 00:53:22,062
On cocaine and women,
so Fabio my friend went crazy...

744
00:53:22,321 --> 00:53:23,696
He won't have his money back.

745
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,196
So he goes to see the judge...

746
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,149
And the priest,
and he said, listen...

747
00:53:42,832 --> 00:53:44,730
Wheere is my receipt,
and the money?

748
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,331
And they said
"but you don't have a receipt..."

749
00:53:46,371 --> 00:53:48,566
"Where is it? Give it back to me!"
said Fabio...

750
00:53:48,628 --> 00:53:51,109
"Give you what? We never saw any!"

751
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:55,414
So?

752
00:53:56,207 --> 00:53:58,359
When does your friend
need the money, Paolo?

753
00:54:01,089 --> 00:54:02,320
I don't know.

754
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,432
As soon as possible, or...

755
00:54:05,597 --> 00:54:07,000
He will turn on the gas.

756
00:54:07,547 --> 00:54:08,676
No, I am in...

757
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,229
Doubt whether he will do
anything as silly as that.

758
00:54:11,402 --> 00:54:14,121
Oh yes, he's desperate,
he writes poetry...

759
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,613
His faith in the church...

760
00:54:16,894 --> 00:54:18,555
Is totally destroyed.

761
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:23,359
Ten million lire...

762
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,281
That's a lot of money.

763
00:54:28,675 --> 00:54:30,953
What is money
when friendship is involved?

764
00:54:32,332 --> 00:54:34,754
But when there is
that much money involved...

765
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,707
I think it's usually
more than friendship.

766
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:42,699
What is more than friendship?

767
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:44,703
Friendship is...

768
00:54:44,765 --> 00:54:46,687
The most beautiful
thing in the world.

769
00:54:47,886 --> 00:54:49,445
Now, who told you that?

770
00:54:49,972 --> 00:54:51,273
What do you mean?

771
00:54:52,761 --> 00:54:54,945
Did the Signora Coogan
tell you that?

772
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,753
The Signora Coogan?

773
00:55:02,113 --> 00:55:03,203
Yes.

774
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:07,633
I do not understand.

775
00:55:19,124 --> 00:55:20,284
Paolo, when the time comes...

776
00:55:20,307 --> 00:55:22,241
That nobody can desire
me for myself...

777
00:55:22,272 --> 00:55:23,686
I think I would rather...

778
00:55:24,694 --> 00:55:26,344
Not be desired at all.

779
00:57:02,704 --> 00:57:04,627
Don't come in, I'm not dressed.

780
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:27,290
Why did you want
to know when my friend...

781
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:29,161
Needed the money?

782
00:57:30,188 --> 00:57:32,794
Because you are very young
and very foolish.

783
00:57:34,594 --> 00:57:36,161
And very beautiful.

784
00:57:40,516 --> 00:57:41,935
And I'm not so young...

785
00:57:43,055 --> 00:57:44,528
I'm not beautiful anymore...

786
00:57:44,607 --> 00:57:45,507
And...

787
00:57:48,805 --> 00:57:50,844
But beginning to be very wise...

788
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:12,265
Buonasera Paolo!

789
00:59:13,766 --> 00:59:15,054
Ciao Paolo!

790
00:59:25,513 --> 00:59:26,927
Signora Stone!

791
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:28,185
Grazie!

792
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:40,651
- Signora?
- Grazie, Emilia.

793
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:46,792
Bravo, Christopher!

794
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:03,881
It's not a bad part
if I say so myself.

795
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:07,285
I wrote it for you.

796
01:02:07,517 --> 01:02:09,238
It's a beautiful part.

797
01:02:10,381 --> 01:02:12,715
- Beautiful play.
- Then do it!

798
01:02:13,655 --> 01:02:15,988
Make one of
those legendary comeback.

799
01:02:16,059 --> 01:02:17,916
Return to Broadway!

800
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,457
- I can't.
- Can't?

801
01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:25,621
Won't.

802
01:02:26,482 --> 01:02:28,582
You can retire from a
profession, you know...

803
01:02:28,608 --> 01:02:30,199
But not from an art.

804
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:32,293
Then thank goodness
I'm not an artist.

805
01:02:35,186 --> 01:02:36,512
Paolo!

806
01:02:39,147 --> 01:02:40,645
I hate the cold sun.

807
01:02:42,506 --> 01:02:44,434
I don't like it
when the heat is gone.

808
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,201
Whoops!

809
01:02:50,692 --> 01:02:52,746
- Indeed.
- A handful?

810
01:02:53,209 --> 01:02:54,403
I suppose.

811
01:02:55,491 --> 01:02:57,092
I thought you would approve.

812
01:02:57,894 --> 01:03:01,175
Beautiful boys and medicinals
like penicillin...

813
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:04,755
They should be taken twice a day
until the course is finished...

814
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:08,405
After which you should have,
in theory, recovered

815
01:03:10,905 --> 01:03:13,053
Unless you have a lingering virus.

816
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,579
Or, shall we say,
a drifting one.

817
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,110
Walk back on stage in New York?

818
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:27,655
Cold New York!

819
01:03:31,623 --> 01:03:34,818
There's been a fantastic
amount of talk, you know...

820
01:03:35,427 --> 01:03:38,154
Sniggering hints
in the gossip columns.

821
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,689
You may have escaped
from the stage...

822
01:03:40,735 --> 01:03:43,139
But you can't escape
from the public attention.

823
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:46,228
Anymore than you can
shake off the skin of your body.

824
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:49,454
There isn't anyone
who ever loved you...

825
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:50,907
Oh, who are these people
who ever loved me?

826
01:03:50,933 --> 01:03:52,335
I want names!

827
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:53,954
There are thousands!

828
01:03:54,154 --> 01:03:56,735
- You represent...
- Just a series of parts.

829
01:03:58,357 --> 01:03:59,732
Never myself.

830
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:02,169
Is this yourself?

831
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:06,341
I have lived my life
without medicins...

832
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:08,325
Without drugs.

833
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:12,501
Now I know
the meaning of addiction.

834
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:14,661
Then baby...

835
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:16,587
You're lost!

836
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:40,830
Careful!

837
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,338
- Ma sei pazzo?
- Ma va' al diavolo!

838
01:04:58,143 --> 01:04:59,315
Imbecille.

839
01:05:17,186 --> 01:05:19,742
No, no, no, not in the car!

840
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:21,257
It's okay!

841
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,476
It is an Italian tradition.

842
01:06:51,161 --> 01:06:52,240
Do you...

843
01:06:55,059 --> 01:06:56,576
Do you love me?

844
01:07:01,278 --> 01:07:02,967
I am hungry.

845
01:07:18,495 --> 01:07:20,803
Oh, it's going to rain!

846
01:07:24,838 --> 01:07:26,154
You don't want it to rain?

847
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:27,913
No, it will spoil the picnic.

848
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:34,440
I don't suppose it has occurred to you
that there are some more considerations...

849
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:37,412
Beside the amusement
of rich foreigners here.

850
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:39,764
That perhaps...

851
01:07:40,221 --> 01:07:41,800
We care about our crops.

852
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:45,904
Paolo!

853
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,256
Well well, you rich American ladies
are the new conquerors of Rome.

854
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:52,573
But you must know this...

855
01:07:52,682 --> 01:07:54,354
Roma is 3 000 years old.

856
01:07:54,425 --> 01:07:55,721
Yes, three thousands!

857
01:07:55,807 --> 01:07:58,303
And all of these conquerors,
all of them...

858
01:07:59,057 --> 01:08:00,529
Have come back to the dust.

859
01:08:03,268 --> 01:08:04,737
Paolo, were you a fascist?

860
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:06,119
I am an aristocrat.

861
01:08:06,237 --> 01:08:07,459
Is that an answer?

862
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:10,175
You know, when I was 15...

863
01:08:11,065 --> 01:08:12,607
I was already a pilot...

864
01:08:13,425 --> 01:08:15,748
And I was the leader
of a flying club called...

865
01:08:16,181 --> 01:08:17,189
"The Doves".

866
01:08:17,354 --> 01:08:18,690
We would wear uniforms.

867
01:08:18,854 --> 01:08:20,847
- Oh, uniforms?
- Yes!

868
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,076
Bright blue.

869
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,698
With gold doves on the sleeves.

870
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:28,479
Six of my friends...

871
01:08:29,416 --> 01:08:31,325
Died on their planes over Africa.

872
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:33,596
I thought in the war
you drove the tanks.

873
01:08:34,307 --> 01:08:35,948
Both, I did both.
I... I...

874
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,370
You never understand, what...

875
01:08:37,475 --> 01:08:38,553
I travelled to Africa in my...

876
01:08:38,579 --> 01:08:39,479
In your tank!

877
01:08:39,518 --> 01:08:40,584
Plane!

878
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:46,983
I do not blame you for laughing.

879
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:49,639
We lost the war,
so we are ridiculous.

880
01:08:52,626 --> 01:08:54,397
But you can be
ridiculous yourself.

881
01:08:55,643 --> 01:08:57,409
You were ridiculous in the car.

882
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,053
Why?

883
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:04,006
You asked if I loved you.

884
01:09:07,175 --> 01:09:08,515
Is that ridiculous?

885
01:09:09,878 --> 01:09:11,506
Besides my family
and my Doves...

886
01:09:12,073 --> 01:09:13,659
I've only loved one person.

887
01:09:14,104 --> 01:09:16,772
And that was my second cousin,
the Principessa di Lio.

888
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:22,971
She was raped by drunken
American soldiers...

889
01:09:24,581 --> 01:09:25,912
In Naples.

890
01:09:30,456 --> 01:09:31,356
Now...

891
01:09:31,386 --> 01:09:33,807
She's gone into the convent
of the Grey Nuns.

892
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:37,534
So...

893
01:09:37,885 --> 01:09:39,104
Laugh all you want...

894
01:09:40,065 --> 01:09:41,709
I do not love anybody.

895
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:47,615
Paolo?

896
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:51,105
As the shops in Rome
are still open...

897
01:09:51,131 --> 01:09:53,170
Let's go to Brioni!

898
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:55,346
Get you measured...

899
01:09:55,534 --> 01:09:56,748
For a suit.

900
01:09:57,245 --> 01:09:58,170
Brioni.

901
01:09:58,425 --> 01:09:59,998
Yes, for a summer wardrobe.

902
01:10:00,393 --> 01:10:01,753
No, no, no.

903
01:10:02,471 --> 01:10:03,892
I could not accept the gift.

904
01:10:04,003 --> 01:10:06,162
Oh, I'm sorry,
that was a bad idea.

905
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:09,552
Signora Coogan wanted to give me
an Alfa Romeo för Christmas.

906
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,292
The colour of blood.

907
01:10:11,318 --> 01:10:13,037
- Blood?
- Yes, blood.

908
01:10:13,518 --> 01:10:15,667
But I could not accept it.

909
01:10:16,331 --> 01:10:17,240
Because...

910
01:10:17,888 --> 01:10:19,194
I did not love her.

911
01:10:21,331 --> 01:10:22,591
Oh, I see.

912
01:10:26,432 --> 01:10:28,214
But this is different.

913
01:10:30,049 --> 01:10:31,198
Is it?

914
01:10:32,026 --> 01:10:33,268
Yes.

915
01:10:33,737 --> 01:10:34,980
The truth is...

916
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:37,362
We love each other, no?

917
01:10:42,151 --> 01:10:44,533
I thougt you only loved
your family, your Doves and...

918
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:47,331
And your second cousin
who lives in the convent.

919
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:50,010
I only said that because
you hurt my feelings.

920
01:10:50,503 --> 01:10:52,268
And anyway,
when you love somebody...

921
01:10:52,534 --> 01:10:54,433
You must not listen
to what they say.

922
01:10:55,854 --> 01:10:57,300
You must look at their eyes.

923
01:10:58,456 --> 01:10:59,792
And feel their hearth.

924
01:11:06,987 --> 01:11:08,105
What?

925
01:11:11,636 --> 01:11:12,536
What?

926
01:11:12,596 --> 01:11:13,995
Did I make you sad?

927
01:11:16,183 --> 01:11:18,159
No, you make me happy.

928
01:11:26,972 --> 01:11:28,120
The tuxedo...

929
01:11:28,268 --> 01:11:29,737
It will be a work of art.

930
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:32,034
Blue.
Midnight blue.

931
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:34,792
The only midnight blue
tuxedo in Rome.

932
01:11:35,276 --> 01:11:36,519
But the suit...

933
01:11:36,721 --> 01:11:38,042
It will be the masterpiece.

934
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:40,315
Grey like a dove,
like my uniform.

935
01:11:40,393 --> 01:11:42,675
Like the uniform
of my six friends who...

936
01:11:42,754 --> 01:11:43,934
Who died on the boat.

937
01:11:44,128 --> 01:11:45,597
Please, show her the material.

938
01:11:45,955 --> 01:11:48,595
It's kashmir wool,
first quality, beautiful.

939
01:11:49,213 --> 01:11:50,113
See?

940
01:11:50,353 --> 01:11:52,347
Come on, touch it, feel it.

941
01:11:53,549 --> 01:11:54,972
I know how it feels.

942
01:11:57,096 --> 01:11:59,456
I am happy, I'm very happy!

943
01:12:34,718 --> 01:12:36,315
Paolo!

944
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:38,480
What?

945
01:12:40,344 --> 01:12:41,761
What?

946
01:12:45,071 --> 01:12:45,971
Nothing!

947
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:48,027
I just wanted you
to help me me with this things.

948
01:12:52,384 --> 01:12:55,447
"A tisket a tasket,
a little yellow basket....

949
01:12:56,344 --> 01:12:57,672
What, ah?

950
01:12:58,023 --> 01:12:59,704
Are you surprised
I know that song?

951
01:13:00,055 --> 01:13:01,923
I'm always surprised by you.

952
01:13:02,288 --> 01:13:03,563
Sing it with me.

953
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:06,305
No, no that is not
something I can do.

954
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:07,416
Why?

955
01:13:07,641 --> 01:13:09,313
Did you not sing on the stage?

956
01:13:09,727 --> 01:13:11,422
Oklahoma!

957
01:13:11,828 --> 01:13:13,703
No, no, no, no...

958
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:16,891
I can make you sing.

959
01:13:17,766 --> 01:13:18,899
If you want.

960
01:13:27,468 --> 01:13:29,062
What does "tasket" mean?

961
01:13:29,289 --> 01:13:30,446
I've no idea.

962
01:13:31,344 --> 01:13:32,428
Sing it!

963
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:36,491
- A little yellow basket...
- Basket...

964
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:45,685
No robe.

965
01:13:46,748 --> 01:13:47,810
I'm cold.

966
01:13:48,109 --> 01:13:49,123
Come here.

967
01:13:50,382 --> 01:13:51,826
Tis is not you.

968
01:13:55,373 --> 01:13:56,571
No, no.

969
01:13:56,657 --> 01:13:58,396
I want to look at you
in the light.

970
01:14:03,032 --> 01:14:04,302
I'm old.

971
01:14:16,422 --> 01:14:17,946
You're beautiful.

972
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,222
Beg.

973
01:15:17,342 --> 01:15:18,857
No, no.

974
01:15:19,255 --> 01:15:20,302
Beg.

975
01:15:21,287 --> 01:15:22,526
Please...

976
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,307
What?

977
01:15:25,909 --> 01:15:27,326
- Please!
- What?

978
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:28,347
Please!

979
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:37,706
The new colour suits you.

980
01:15:38,787 --> 01:15:39,862
Colour?

981
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:41,943
- Of your hair.
- Ah!

982
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,354
Thank you.

983
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:45,565
Makes you so much younger.

984
01:15:46,112 --> 01:15:47,349
Better then blond.

985
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:48,966
Blond is an American colour.

986
01:15:48,998 --> 01:15:50,771
Europeans don't have it.

987
01:15:51,545 --> 01:15:53,112
Of course we could
buy in a bottle...

988
01:15:53,138 --> 01:15:55,386
But we have to be
so careful of our money.

989
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:59,401
We suffered great losses
during the war, you know.

990
01:16:00,537 --> 01:16:02,849
Not just what we were...

991
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:04,303
But...

992
01:16:04,615 --> 01:16:06,261
Our finances as well.

993
01:16:07,779 --> 01:16:11,190
Some of us came from
noble families, proud families...

994
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:13,737
Proud.

995
01:16:14,881 --> 01:16:16,229
Now we must beg.

996
01:16:16,417 --> 01:16:18,182
Well, it is as bad as that?

997
01:16:19,693 --> 01:16:20,753
Worse.

998
01:16:22,443 --> 01:16:25,261
Has Paolo mentioned
my financial situation to you?

999
01:16:25,443 --> 01:16:26,440
No.

1000
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:27,948
Of course.

1001
01:16:28,263 --> 01:16:30,276
His mind is
on other things, you see.

1002
01:16:31,865 --> 01:16:32,831
The young.

1003
01:16:33,982 --> 01:16:35,217
Oh, the young!

1004
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:41,089
I have no assets.

1005
01:16:42,553 --> 01:16:45,560
All the family heirlooms
were destryed.

1006
01:16:45,755 --> 01:16:46,947
Destroyed?

1007
01:16:48,106 --> 01:16:49,307
The bombs.

1008
01:16:50,114 --> 01:16:51,424
Enemy aircraft.

1009
01:16:51,545 --> 01:16:53,057
Oh, oh yes.

1010
01:16:55,006 --> 01:16:57,115
Now my rent has been raised.

1011
01:16:58,224 --> 01:16:59,857
The landlord is a communist.

1012
01:17:00,001 --> 01:17:02,096
They should have died,
all of them.

1013
01:17:03,974 --> 01:17:05,119
I thought...

1014
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,323
I thought perhaps...

1015
01:17:08,334 --> 01:17:10,560
You might be able
to make me a small loan.

1016
01:17:10,599 --> 01:17:12,599
As a token of our friendship.

1017
01:17:14,224 --> 01:17:15,878
I'm so embarrassed.

1018
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:19,706
Please forget that I asked.

1019
01:17:20,279 --> 01:17:22,130
My face must be red.

1020
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,214
Only a thousand.

1021
01:17:30,849 --> 01:17:32,904
I thought perhaps...

1022
01:17:33,943 --> 01:17:35,349
One thousand.

1023
01:17:35,967 --> 01:17:37,104
Dollars?

1024
01:17:37,623 --> 01:17:39,667
Yes, of course.

1025
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:42,425
But that's a very large sum...

1026
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:47,464
- In appreciation of...
- What?

1027
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:53,628
Of introducing you to the
pleasures of Roman society.

1028
01:17:58,967 --> 01:18:02,188
I would be happy to lend you
1 000 dollars, cara mia.

1029
01:18:04,248 --> 01:18:05,578
If I had it.

1030
01:18:06,356 --> 01:18:07,958
But sadly, my...

1031
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:11,099
My accounts are tied up in
a absurde, obscure...

1032
01:18:11,146 --> 01:18:12,969
Litigation in America.

1033
01:18:16,326 --> 01:18:18,633
I do however have a
small personal fond...

1034
01:18:18,659 --> 01:18:21,938
And out of that I could
lend you 400 dollars.

1035
01:18:23,998 --> 01:18:25,545
400 dollars?

1036
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:28,453
400 dollars.

1037
01:18:33,787 --> 01:18:35,508
You are most gracious.

1038
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:41,336
400 dollars.

1039
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,670
She spends
400 dollars on a hatt.

1040
01:18:44,779 --> 01:18:46,407
A hat to hide her face.

1041
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:49,282
Have you seen her face?
She's grotesque!

1042
01:18:49,537 --> 01:18:51,282
But, what does it matter.

1043
01:18:51,536 --> 01:18:53,474
She is the victorious American.

1044
01:18:53,539 --> 01:18:55,060
She has better toilet-paper.

1045
01:18:55,154 --> 01:18:56,703
Why did you ask her for money?

1046
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:01,170
As you are aware, my dear...

1047
01:19:01,196 --> 01:19:03,635
I usually get a
percentage of the profits.

1048
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,951
Where are the profits?

1049
01:19:04,977 --> 01:19:06,791
Where's the ten million
lire she promised you?

1050
01:19:07,006 --> 01:19:08,498
She's cheating you.

1051
01:19:09,467 --> 01:19:10,867
She's not vulgar.

1052
01:19:11,193 --> 01:19:12,625
She's not like the others.

1053
01:19:14,912 --> 01:19:16,000
Anyway...

1054
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:19,242
You will never understand
a woman llike her.

1055
01:19:21,092 --> 01:19:23,055
Are you in love
with this foolish woman?

1056
01:19:24,184 --> 01:19:25,492
Don't be stupid.

1057
01:19:26,029 --> 01:19:28,279
You know perfectly the woman
that I always loved.

1058
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:30,172
Ah, I know, I know...

1059
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:31,297
The nun!

1060
01:19:32,748 --> 01:19:34,664
This is a young actress
from Hollywood...

1061
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:35,813
She's here in Rome.

1062
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:39,258
She's between husbands
and unmistakably bored.

1063
01:19:39,912 --> 01:19:41,969
I could make an introduction.

1064
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:44,508
I will let you know.

1065
01:19:45,131 --> 01:19:47,657
"Marchette" do not become
attached to their clients.

1066
01:19:47,904 --> 01:19:49,547
I'm not a marchetta.

1067
01:19:49,742 --> 01:19:51,297
Of course you are.

1068
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:53,545
But a fading one.

1069
01:19:53,607 --> 01:19:55,321
Soon you'll be on the street.

1070
01:19:55,435 --> 01:19:57,217
When she's bored with you.

1071
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:58,875
When she returns to America...

1072
01:19:58,901 --> 01:20:01,219
When she resumes
her boring career.

1073
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:04,758
Don't you know that everyone
is laughing at you?

1074
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:06,184
No one laughs at me!

1075
01:20:06,271 --> 01:20:08,693
All of Rome is laughing at...

1076
01:20:14,748 --> 01:20:16,138
It is a waste.

1077
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:18,474
The waste...

1078
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,516
Of your last golden years.

1079
01:20:21,693 --> 01:20:22,610
Paolo.

1080
01:20:22,759 --> 01:20:23,775
Caro.

1081
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:28,469
You are not just another
beautiful young man.

1082
01:20:30,131 --> 01:20:32,039
There's more to you than that.

1083
01:20:32,646 --> 01:20:33,953
Is there?

1084
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:45,678
There are new marchette in town!

1085
01:20:45,896 --> 01:20:47,821
Every day, new ones!

1086
01:20:48,342 --> 01:20:49,795
Prettier ones!

1087
01:20:49,951 --> 01:20:51,693
Younger ones!

1088
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:07,771
I need air.

1089
01:21:08,732 --> 01:21:10,709
- We are in the air.
- This is not air!

1090
01:22:26,919 --> 01:22:28,176
Excuse me!

1091
01:22:36,012 --> 01:22:36,966
What?

1092
01:22:38,262 --> 01:22:40,560
I'm not used to wearing
such fine clothes?

1093
01:22:40,887 --> 01:22:41,888
Is that it?

1094
01:23:25,118 --> 01:23:26,212
Who's that boy?

1095
01:23:27,275 --> 01:23:28,454
What boy?

1096
01:23:29,126 --> 01:23:30,829
The one that follows you
all the time.

1097
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,134
Have you not noticed him?

1098
01:23:34,767 --> 01:23:35,931
He's down there now.

1099
01:23:36,127 --> 01:23:37,376
Come on. take a look.

1100
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:48,017
Probably some money changer.

1101
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:55,103
The troble is that you have made
a spectacle of yourself.

1102
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:56,931
What do you mean?

1103
01:23:57,494 --> 01:24:00,009
We're being pointed out in the street,
did you not know that?

1104
01:24:00,455 --> 01:24:02,056
It's you who like to show off.

1105
01:24:02,892 --> 01:24:05,322
And it's you they look at
mostly, not me.

1106
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,025
You do not hear the comments.

1107
01:24:08,447 --> 01:24:09,658
Oh yes, I do.

1108
01:24:10,197 --> 01:24:12,337
My hear is better for Italian
then you think.

1109
01:24:13,322 --> 01:24:15,908
"Che bell'uomo, che bell'uomo",
that's what they say...

1110
01:24:16,072 --> 01:24:17,353
At the sidewalk tables.

1111
01:24:17,486 --> 01:24:19,408
And you bask in it
like a sunflower.

1112
01:24:19,775 --> 01:24:22,462
Your hear for Italian
is not as good as you think.

1113
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:24,986
I did not tell you this,
but last week...

1114
01:24:25,094 --> 01:24:27,570
I was compelled
to challenge a man to duel.

1115
01:24:28,275 --> 01:24:30,752
Because of a remark
that was made about us.

1116
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:32,493
What remark.

1117
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:35,283
A disgusting remark.

1118
01:24:36,252 --> 01:24:37,830
You fought a duel?

1119
01:24:38,017 --> 01:24:40,892
Well, I delivered the challenge
and the man left Rome.

1120
01:24:43,846 --> 01:24:45,829
I do not suppose
it has occurred to you...

1121
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:50,134
That women of your kind
are often found murdered in bed.

1122
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:53,056
Well, they are.

1123
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:55,736
Let me tell you something.

1124
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:58,032
Last week,
on the French Riviera...

1125
01:24:58,431 --> 01:25:01,899
A middle-aged woman was found in bed
with her throat cut from ear to ear.

1126
01:25:02,596 --> 01:25:04,853
She was laying
on the right side of the bed.

1127
01:25:05,713 --> 01:25:08,502
There were strands of hair-oil
on the left pillow.

1128
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,782
Yes.

1129
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:12,306
Hair-oil.

1130
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:16,228
Are you trying to tell me
that you are going to kill me?

1131
01:25:18,783 --> 01:25:19,954
Laugh all you want.

1132
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:23,439
On three or four years I'll read in the
newspapers about your murder.

1133
01:25:23,549 --> 01:25:24,540
You will see.

1134
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,775
Three or four years
is all the time I need.

1135
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:31,360
After that a cutthroat
will probably be a convenience.

1136
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,971
Do not laugh at me!

1137
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:00,291
Sorry.

1138
01:26:02,778 --> 01:26:04,330
My mouth runs away.

1139
01:26:20,145 --> 01:26:22,494
Let me take off my
grandmother's locket first.

1140
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,114
Yes, I've been thinking
about that girl, you know...

1141
01:26:44,747 --> 01:26:45,950
The movie star.

1142
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:47,614
Bravo!

1143
01:26:47,864 --> 01:26:50,161
Angel Hunter.

1144
01:26:50,669 --> 01:26:52,262
What a stupid name.

1145
01:26:52,288 --> 01:26:53,302
Perhaps.

1146
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:56,184
But I'm certain there's more to
be gained from this quarter...

1147
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,676
Than you managed
to get out of Signora Stone.

1148
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:03,262
And I'm not speaking
of anything strictly material...

1149
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,926
What do you mean?

1150
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:07,192
I am thinking of you
future, Paolo...

1151
01:27:07,225 --> 01:27:09,378
I am thinking of a career.

1152
01:27:09,651 --> 01:27:12,378
After all you have stile,
you have distinction.

1153
01:27:12,809 --> 01:27:16,861
You have something millions of women
would respond to on the screen...

1154
01:27:20,698 --> 01:27:23,510
Then, bring her with you tonight,
to the apartment

1155
01:28:36,572 --> 01:28:38,826
Why do you follow me?

1156
01:29:02,889 --> 01:29:04,404
Why did you leave the table?

1157
01:29:05,163 --> 01:29:06,567
Who's that girl?

1158
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:08,529
A friend of Aldo.

1159
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:10,912
And who is Aldo?

1160
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:12,724
A friend of that girl.

1161
01:29:13,945 --> 01:29:15,414
Where're you going?

1162
01:29:15,477 --> 01:29:17,045
To get the car,
have you forgotten?

1163
01:29:17,164 --> 01:29:18,591
Forgotten what?

1164
01:29:18,742 --> 01:29:22,060
The invite at the Contessa and some
friends to look at our moving pictures.

1165
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,508
I invited the Contessa?

1166
01:29:24,554 --> 01:29:25,465
Hardly.

1167
01:29:25,539 --> 01:29:27,769
You invited, or I invited,
what difference does it make?

1168
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:30,177
They will be there in five minutes
with no one except the buttler.

1169
01:29:30,203 --> 01:29:30,779
Where?

1170
01:29:30,805 --> 01:29:32,709
At the apartment,
where do you suppose?

1171
01:29:41,677 --> 01:29:43,576
I'm not the Signora Coogan.

1172
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:46,413
What?

1173
01:29:46,451 --> 01:29:49,607
I'm not some wretched old woman
with nothing but money to give you.

1174
01:29:50,482 --> 01:29:52,373
I don't know what
you are talking about.

1175
01:29:55,287 --> 01:29:57,498
- Look at me Paolo.
- What is the matter with you?

1176
01:29:57,545 --> 01:29:59,701
I want you to see
that I'm not like that.

1177
01:30:00,684 --> 01:30:03,981
Even when I'm tired and I've lost
all my pride, I'm not...

1178
01:30:04,318 --> 01:30:06,966
- Really like that.
- But I have said nothing!

1179
01:30:07,326 --> 01:30:09,638
In America I'm known
as a woman of talent and beauty...

1180
01:30:09,677 --> 01:30:12,029
Books are written about me
and plays are written for me.

1181
01:30:12,646 --> 01:30:13,846
Anyone who goes to New York...

1182
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,749
Will tell you I'm not someone
to be treated like that.

1183
01:30:18,059 --> 01:30:19,607
When we get home
I'll show you a collection...

1184
01:30:19,633 --> 01:30:21,529
Of theater reviews
and newspaper articles...

1185
01:30:21,555 --> 01:30:23,248
So you see for yourself.

1186
01:30:23,301 --> 01:30:25,904
Yes, yes, I've seen you pictures
in the fashion magazines.

1187
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:28,412
I do not like somebody
who has to brag.

1188
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,000
You know, you are not
the first great lady...

1189
01:30:32,029 --> 01:30:33,499
That I have gone out with.

1190
01:30:34,043 --> 01:30:37,387
Last year I was all over Marocco
with Mrs Jameson Walker.

1191
01:30:37,536 --> 01:30:40,137
Who is also photographed
by fashion magazines.

1192
01:30:41,104 --> 01:30:44,349
I come from a very distinguished family,
I'm not just a mythomane.

1193
01:30:44,701 --> 01:30:46,474
I have a title, I'm a Count.

1194
01:30:47,081 --> 01:30:49,722
Years ago with married into
other distiguished families.

1195
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:53,404
I would never be seen with
someone who's not a great lady.

1196
01:30:54,521 --> 01:30:55,341
It is...

1197
01:30:55,412 --> 01:30:56,427
It is only because of the war...

1198
01:30:56,453 --> 01:30:59,116
That I can't always
buy my own dinner.

1199
01:30:59,895 --> 01:31:01,568
Do you think it gives me pride?

1200
01:31:08,982 --> 01:31:11,388
I do not think this is
a dignified conversation.

1201
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:19,904
It's terrifying, I suppose.

1202
01:31:21,808 --> 01:31:23,256
For both of us.

1203
01:31:23,604 --> 01:31:24,693
What?

1204
01:31:27,128 --> 01:31:28,857
The loss of dignity.

1205
01:31:53,526 --> 01:31:55,417
It is a scandal...

1206
01:31:55,534 --> 01:31:56,597
A sscandal?

1207
01:31:56,831 --> 01:31:58,597
Oh my, oh my...

1208
01:31:58,682 --> 01:32:01,456
It is difficult to shock me,
my dear, but...

1209
01:32:02,237 --> 01:32:04,284
She has shocked all of Rome!

1210
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,167
- But why?
- No, please...

1211
01:32:06,267 --> 01:32:07,409
Do not ask me.

1212
01:32:07,495 --> 01:32:09,175
I cannot bring myself to
repeat the stories...

1213
01:32:09,201 --> 01:32:11,317
One hears about this woman.

1214
01:32:13,901 --> 01:32:15,683
I really don't understand!

1215
01:32:16,119 --> 01:32:18,244
- Oh my, oh my...
- Please...

1216
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:20,872
I beg you, do not
force me to repeat them.

1217
01:32:23,104 --> 01:32:24,214
But what?

1218
01:32:25,105 --> 01:32:26,417
It's tragic...

1219
01:32:26,448 --> 01:32:28,315
She has descended
to the depth...

1220
01:32:28,736 --> 01:32:30,402
She's in, I believe...

1221
01:32:30,838 --> 01:32:32,175
What is the word?

1222
01:32:32,799 --> 01:32:34,089
An abyss...

1223
01:32:34,675 --> 01:32:35,972
Karen Stone?

1224
01:32:37,463 --> 01:32:41,314
She's in my opinion nothing more
then a harlot who's procured riches.

1225
01:32:42,628 --> 01:32:44,401
But she used to be famous...

1226
01:32:45,074 --> 01:32:47,237
I saw her on stage,
when I was a child.

1227
01:32:47,284 --> 01:32:48,542
Ah, yes.

1228
01:32:48,636 --> 01:32:50,245
Her mediocre career.

1229
01:32:50,362 --> 01:32:52,011
Paid for by her husband...

1230
01:32:52,127 --> 01:32:54,941
She's purchased her
way into prominence.

1231
01:32:56,096 --> 01:32:57,737
I thought she was good.

1232
01:32:58,901 --> 01:33:00,846
Of course I...
I was young.

1233
01:33:01,456 --> 01:33:04,839
And, now that she's lost
her looks and she's growing old...

1234
01:33:05,073 --> 01:33:08,377
She creates a scandal by throwing herself
in front of a younger man...

1235
01:33:08,722 --> 01:33:10,354
Who has no interest in her...

1236
01:33:10,441 --> 01:33:12,214
Whatsoever...

1237
01:33:14,604 --> 01:33:18,769
And now no one will receive her
in the places where I was foolish enough...

1238
01:33:18,862 --> 01:33:19,995
To present her.

1239
01:33:20,564 --> 01:33:22,166
But it will not stop her.

1240
01:33:22,417 --> 01:33:24,706
When Rome has been exhausted...

1241
01:33:25,245 --> 01:33:27,183
She will move to Tangier.

1242
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,503
She's more pathetic
then the Signora Coogan...

1243
01:33:31,566 --> 01:33:33,464
Whom you must have heard about.

1244
01:33:42,566 --> 01:33:44,362
I do not approve
of eavesdropping.

1245
01:33:51,464 --> 01:33:52,878
Contessa!

1246
01:33:53,745 --> 01:33:55,511
How delightful of you to come.

1247
01:33:56,909 --> 01:33:59,081
- Baron, Baronessa...
- Piacere.

1248
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:00,800
Oh, Paolo...

1249
01:34:00,894 --> 01:34:03,456
- This is...
- Angel Hunter, of course.

1250
01:34:03,675 --> 01:34:05,128
I've seen all your films.

1251
01:34:05,597 --> 01:34:06,851
I am Conte...

1252
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,333
Paolo di Lio.

1253
01:34:10,558 --> 01:34:12,378
Signora Stone and I
are very pleased...

1254
01:34:13,714 --> 01:34:15,659
That you have chosen
to come tonight.

1255
01:34:16,644 --> 01:34:19,339
The Contessa is a devoted admirer
of Signora Stone...

1256
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:22,245
- Is she not?
- Yes, yes!

1257
01:34:22,308 --> 01:34:24,081
I adore her!

1258
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:26,511
Miss Hunter is filming...

1259
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:28,722
Yes, of course, she's
filming in Rome.

1260
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,917
The arrival of such beautiful visitors
to our city...

1261
01:34:33,487 --> 01:34:35,394
Does not pass unnoticed.

1262
01:34:35,886 --> 01:34:36,933
Paolo.

1263
01:34:39,839 --> 01:34:41,683
The Contessa's glass is weeping.

1264
01:34:46,003 --> 01:34:47,972
Good evening, Baroness...

1265
01:34:49,112 --> 01:34:50,237
Contessa.

1266
01:34:50,855 --> 01:34:53,621
Oh, and this must be, uhm...

1267
01:34:54,839 --> 01:34:56,753
Miss... Miss Hudson?

1268
01:34:57,127 --> 01:34:58,127
Hunter.

1269
01:34:58,972 --> 01:34:59,878
Indeed.

1270
01:35:00,253 --> 01:35:01,651
I admired you...

1271
01:35:01,862 --> 01:35:04,096
So much in... "This Above All"

1272
01:35:05,682 --> 01:35:08,027
Oh, thank you so much,
that is reassuring.

1273
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:15,597
I believe the Contessa was about
to tell you about the Signora Coogan...

1274
01:35:16,018 --> 01:35:18,128
That ridiculous old woman...

1275
01:35:18,948 --> 01:35:21,198
We do not want
to hear about her.

1276
01:35:24,191 --> 01:35:26,683
Miss Huter, have you seen
the seven hills of Rome?

1277
01:35:27,269 --> 01:35:28,332
I...

1278
01:35:28,378 --> 01:35:30,182
Think only about four.

1279
01:35:31,331 --> 01:35:33,730
Then come outside, please,
and I will show you.

1280
01:35:46,417 --> 01:35:48,487
Would you like
something to eat, Contessa?

1281
01:35:49,049 --> 01:35:50,690
No, thank you, I'm fine.

1282
01:35:51,003 --> 01:35:52,183
A few crackers?

1283
01:35:52,316 --> 01:35:54,198
- No...
- Dip, maybe?

1284
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:55,745
No.

1285
01:35:55,995 --> 01:35:56,987
Thank you.

1286
01:36:08,611 --> 01:36:11,909
I'm sorry Paolo wasn't interested
in the stories you might tell...

1287
01:36:11,987 --> 01:36:14,987
I'm always intrigued when you
talk about your customers.

1288
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:16,886
Customers?

1289
01:36:17,627 --> 01:36:18,995
È pronto, signora.

1290
01:36:19,339 --> 01:36:21,019
Yes, yes, we can start now.

1291
01:36:21,836 --> 01:36:24,024
They are just home movies,
forgive the quality...

1292
01:36:24,073 --> 01:36:25,823
I'll fetch Paolo and Miss Hunter.

1293
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:44,253
Where's the lady
of the silver screen?

1294
01:36:44,636 --> 01:36:45,691
Gone.

1295
01:36:46,596 --> 01:36:47,761
Why so quickly?

1296
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:51,292
Because I knew that you would
follow us out in less than five minutes.

1297
01:36:51,776 --> 01:36:54,050
So, I told her
that you were histerical...

1298
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:56,081
And I adviced her to leave.

1299
01:36:56,713 --> 01:36:59,269
It is the third or fourth time
you've insulted me tonight.

1300
01:37:01,425 --> 01:37:02,847
First at Rosati's...

1301
01:37:03,097 --> 01:37:05,644
When you behaved so outrageously
with that drunken girl and...

1302
01:37:05,753 --> 01:37:06,972
Please, please...

1303
01:37:07,916 --> 01:37:10,089
- I have a terrible headache.
- Oh, do you?

1304
01:37:12,588 --> 01:37:14,792
So that means
you can't stay here tonight.

1305
01:37:16,643 --> 01:37:18,354
No, I cannot.

1306
01:37:19,712 --> 01:37:21,487
It isn't because of a headache.

1307
01:37:22,933 --> 01:37:24,657
You are going to take
from here to the Excelsior...

1308
01:37:24,683 --> 01:37:26,466
To keep an appointment
with that cheap...

1309
01:37:26,492 --> 01:37:27,480
Cheap...

1310
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:29,675
Is not a word you should use.

1311
01:37:43,112 --> 01:37:44,441
Let me tell you
something, you...

1312
01:37:44,467 --> 01:37:46,042
You ought to leave Rome.

1313
01:37:46,167 --> 01:37:48,003
You have ruined yourself here.

1314
01:37:48,792 --> 01:37:51,573
I would not be surprised if
the Police refused to...

1315
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:53,152
Renew your permission to stay.

1316
01:37:53,222 --> 01:37:55,058
Don't be ridiculous!

1317
01:37:55,603 --> 01:37:58,635
What I personally can not
tolerate your dishonesty.

1318
01:37:58,979 --> 01:38:00,722
- Have you gone crazy?
- No!

1319
01:38:00,831 --> 01:38:02,472
I have not gone crazy!

1320
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,736
And I have not lost
my memory either!

1321
01:38:06,417 --> 01:38:08,285
I remember, last
February you told me...

1322
01:38:08,311 --> 01:38:10,347
That you were going to
help my friend Fabio.

1323
01:38:10,595 --> 01:38:12,737
Who lost everything
on the black market.

1324
01:38:13,572 --> 01:38:14,650
Oh, Paolo...

1325
01:38:14,714 --> 01:38:16,042
Oh, Paolo!

1326
01:38:16,761 --> 01:38:18,573
My friend need a lot of money.

1327
01:38:18,707 --> 01:38:19,715
No.

1328
01:38:21,245 --> 01:38:23,073
- No, Paolo...
- And you gave him nothing!

1329
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:25,175
- Paolo, please, I beg you.
- You lied!

1330
01:38:25,425 --> 01:38:27,253
You are never going to help!

1331
01:38:28,675 --> 01:38:30,620
Your friend does not exist.

1332
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:33,855
What`?

1333
01:38:35,877 --> 01:38:37,644
Can we tell the truth?

1334
01:38:40,175 --> 01:38:41,433
The truth?

1335
01:38:43,175 --> 01:38:45,159
Do you know how old Roma is?

1336
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,823
3 000 years old.

1337
01:38:48,752 --> 01:38:50,222
And how old are you?

1338
01:38:50,596 --> 01:38:51,885
Fifty?

1339
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:55,003
- Fifty?
- Yes.

1340
01:38:56,244 --> 01:38:58,330
That is the thruth,
you are fifty.

1341
01:39:01,948 --> 01:39:03,355
Why would I be with you...

1342
01:39:03,441 --> 01:39:05,136
Other then to help my friend?

1343
01:39:20,274 --> 01:39:21,532
I want you to leave.

1344
01:39:21,703 --> 01:39:22,945
Cara mia...

1345
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:25,383
The film's very enchanting.

1346
01:39:26,047 --> 01:39:28,024
You Contessa
are a female pimp...

1347
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:30,563
With a collection of handsome boys
that you dispose of...

1348
01:39:30,797 --> 01:39:32,883
To aging, desperate...

1349
01:39:33,172 --> 01:39:35,055
Foolish women and men...

1350
01:39:35,108 --> 01:39:37,430
And because I won't engage
in that kind of ugly traffic...

1351
01:39:37,492 --> 01:39:39,164
You just pass the off
to someone who will.

1352
01:39:39,719 --> 01:39:41,110
How dare you?

1353
01:39:41,821 --> 01:39:43,337
I am the Contessa.

1354
01:39:43,445 --> 01:39:44,991
Oh, please, spare me your title!

1355
01:39:45,017 --> 01:39:46,688
Just get out of here!

1356
01:39:47,055 --> 01:39:48,655
And take your
prize marchetta with you...

1357
01:39:48,711 --> 01:39:50,563
Take him to the next conquest...

1358
01:39:50,626 --> 01:39:52,032
Take him to the movie star...

1359
01:39:52,102 --> 01:39:53,063
Take him...

1360
01:40:09,797 --> 01:40:10,922
Get out!

1361
01:40:11,008 --> 01:40:12,657
Get out!
Get out!

1362
01:40:16,758 --> 01:40:19,790
Do you think you can cause
noble people to go hungry?

1363
01:40:20,329 --> 01:40:22,735
And then tell us how to behave?

1364
01:40:23,797 --> 01:40:25,876
Do you think you can help
the traitors who...

1365
01:40:25,945 --> 01:40:28,187
Hung il Duce upside down?

1366
01:40:28,524 --> 01:40:30,985
And then tell us how to behave?

1367
01:40:33,352 --> 01:40:35,251
Do you think you can bomb us...

1368
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:37,017
And kill our children...

1369
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:40,126
And then tell us how to behave?
