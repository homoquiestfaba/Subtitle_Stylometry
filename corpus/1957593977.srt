1
00:00:01,515 --> 00:00:04,348
(Multicom jingle)

2
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:15,831
(dramatic music)

3
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,230
- [Narrator] For untold
ages we mined the pure rock,

4
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,583
life blood of our world.

5
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,310
With it, the guild magicians
created the matrix,

6
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,313
a tool so powerful it
fulfilled all of our dreams.

7
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,893
All power has a price.

8
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,730
Ours was a seething shadow,

9
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,873
a living force called The Dark Mist.

10
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,650
In desperation, the totalitarian guilders

11
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,816
built the great seal, and
with their ancient rites

12
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:50,373
banished The Dark Mist
from the world of light.

13
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,280
Books of prophecy were written
so that none would forget.

14
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,740
The Lord Protector watched
over these words and,

15
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,373
for a time, the world was at peace.

16
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,943
But peace lasts as long as youth.

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,011
Houses of kindred color
formed battling for control.

18
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,844
(swords clanging)

19
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,110
Destroying knowledge so
that none could use it,

20
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,376
to seize power.

21
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,930
(marching)

22
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,900
Little of the old world was left

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,063
and most had forgotten
what had gone before.

24
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,573
Save one.

25
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,023
Rennick, last of the Lord Protectors.

26
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,100
Rennick dedicated himself
to the scraps that remained,

27
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,253
dark whispers of prophecy.

28
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,230
So haunted, he left love behind

29
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,613
and shut himself away from the world.

30
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:55,303
(beam striking)

31
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,730
- [Quadrant Shadow] You are called.

32
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,400
Fulfill your destiny.

33
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,363
As you read, so shall you lead.

34
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,040
End times are upon you.

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,763
The Dark Mist is rising.

36
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:13,422
Come.

37
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:15,007
Assemble, chosen one.

38
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,017
A reader does not fear the words he reads.

39
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:20,850
So fickle, the chosen.

40
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:24,867
When you're ready, I shall return.

41
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:26,200
Peace be by you.

42
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:33,800
- [Narrator] Thus Rennick sought Pentakis,

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,008
once a Lord Protector himself,

44
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,673
now leader of the powerful guild, Magus.

45
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,730
- Here's to many turns, Lord Protector.

46
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,810
We were not aware of any
request for an audience.

47
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,180
- We're on the brink
of end times, Watachi.

48
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,250
I do not need an invitation.

49
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,000
- That was not my meaning, Rennick.

50
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,113
Here lies our way.

51
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,520
- Since when?

52
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,660
- We've made changes.

53
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,903
- I see.

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,120
- You have not been announced.

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,193
- Fine, announce me!

56
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:06,355
Pentakis?

57
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:07,188
(Pentakis laughs)

58
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:08,351
- Forgive this intrusion, guild mage.

59
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:13,351
- Rennick, you old scavenger, welcome.

60
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:15,823
Watachi, take Feltrays.

61
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,740
(creature squawks)

62
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,350
Come in.

63
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,100
Come in, rest your bones.

64
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,003
Rennick, I would like you to meet Priamus,

65
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:29,530
our most promising adapt.

66
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,036
Priamus, this is Rennick,

67
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:36,040
otherwise known as the
fabled Lord Protector.

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,210
- It is time to gather the Chosen!

69
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,440
- Rennick, please.

70
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,870
- The warning is less than
10 beats and simply sounded.

71
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,390
- [Rennick] The law of probabilities!

72
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,540
The talents required of each
of the Chosen would obviously

73
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,720
be sought in the best candidate

74
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,945
of the current frame of time.

75
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:51,360
Well, the best in their field would

76
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,323
most likely be well-known.

77
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,030
- You have read very well.

78
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,730
- Very clever, yearling.

79
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,080
You've answered something
that was not asked.

80
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,250
- But, Pentakis, he is right.

81
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,160
It's the only way it fits.

82
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,320
A stone breaker, sealmaker,
obviously a guilder.

83
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,820
Spirit watcher, herbalist.

84
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,570
Something about a homeless warrior.

85
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,403
Look, what's this?

86
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:16,980
Ponflection will know him.

87
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,820
He who is star shaven with twine.

88
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,900
A power case.

89
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,080
- Storage device.

90
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,700
- A pure rock crystal of proper tone

91
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,450
would work as a storage device.

92
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,230
The Star of Jasper could
be the needed item.

93
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,033
- That will be enough!

94
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,020
- Jasper could be the key.

95
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,563
Pentakis, we must begin immediately.

96
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,402
- I will have no part
in your fool's quest.

97
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:45,152
(dramatic music)

98
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:48,917
- What?

99
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:51,783
- My place is here.

100
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,930
The Dark Mist must be stopped,

101
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,370
but the riddle is not the only answer.

102
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,970
- It is the only answer.

103
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,030
The realm needs you.

104
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,770
- Touching, but hardly accurate.

105
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,478
- But the need of pure rock for closure.

106
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:11,311
- Priamus.

107
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,393
You are excused.

108
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:23,893
- Why do you refuse to accept your duty?

109
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,403
- My duty leads me elsewhere.

110
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,450
- I should have expected this from the man

111
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,447
who could cut off the
hand of his own brother.

112
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:38,630
- Strong words from a bond breaker!

113
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,363
- You're right, I don't need you.

114
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,848
I will bring this before the Great Hall.

115
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:47,153
Brindey will hear of this.

116
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,132
- Don't leave out, Lady Diamond.

117
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:53,050
(laughs)

118
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,893
Lord Protector.

119
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,992
- Self preservation we
agree to comprehend!

120
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:02,310
- You dare disrespect my house?

121
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,511
- My lady Diamond, so
kind of you to join us.

122
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:07,240
- You tread on sifting sands, Burgandy.

123
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,520
By what authority do
you deny my house entry?

124
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,200
- Small oversight, Lady Diamond.

125
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,261
Only the lower houses were to be barred.

126
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:16,630
- I trust all was
resolved to your pleasure.

127
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,106
- Words speak to this house.

128
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:20,853
- What's the meaning
of this, Lady Diamond?

129
00:07:20,853 --> 00:07:22,520
- We are not joined.

130
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,330
We were met at the gate.

131
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,333
He brings us tidings of prophecy.

132
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,470
- The short of it is this.

133
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,463
The Dark Mist is about to break free and

134
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:34,470
that will pretty much be the
end of all life as we know it.

135
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,499
- Dark Mist, end times?

136
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,250
You speak of bed tales told
to wet the sheet of yearlings.

137
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,980
- It is true!

138
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,894
The Guild has violated their oath.

139
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:48,783
We must assemble the Chosen.

140
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,695
- We have seen the words of
prophecy, Lord Protector,

141
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:56,040
but they do not support your rantings.

142
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,260
- What are you talking about?

143
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,800
- The reader has studied
from the Cabal of Valdur

144
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,050
and disagrees with you, my lord.

145
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,057
- As does most of the realm, it seems.

146
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:06,307
(laughing)

147
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,113
- Show me these words.

148
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,213
(clapping)

149
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:11,823
- Bring the reader!

150
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,950
- Lord Protector.

151
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,263
- Rise, Mariana.

152
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:24,623
- Turns have been very kind to you.

153
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,610
- Your words are fair.

154
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,456
- Yes, he's quite the
silver-tongued suitor

155
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:30,993
when he wants something.

156
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,713
- What words do you hold?

157
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,543
- Most is as you say, Lord Protector.

158
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,010
The signs point to a
coming crisis of import.

159
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,352
- Please, Mariana, we do
not have time for ceremony.

160
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:54,463
Are the end times upon us?

161
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,093
- From the words I have been given.

162
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:04,827
- A reader shall not fear what she reads.

163
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:08,222
Yes or no?

164
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:10,863
- No, a reader shall not fear.

165
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:14,230
The signs are not as you say.

166
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,712
The fault must lie in your
definitions of key phrases.

167
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:17,545
- Mariana!

168
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:18,513
- There, you see.

169
00:09:18,513 --> 00:09:20,240
The reader has spoken.

170
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,073
- We are done.

171
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:22,230
- We are done.
- We are done.

172
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,300
- We are not done!

173
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,320
What is this you read?

174
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,227
- Please, Lord Protector.

175
00:09:25,227 --> 00:09:27,460
- You all defy the prophecy!

176
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,000
- You have fulfilled your
duty, Lord Protector.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,700
We choose to follow another path.

178
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,340
- There is no other path!

179
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,870
- Don't, Rennick!

180
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,520
(glass breaking)
(woman screaming)

181
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,729
- Are you part of these
lies, too, my lady?

182
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:41,240
- Take him!

183
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,073
- Guards!

184
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:43,223
(growling)

185
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:44,219
- Call off your men!

186
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:45,706
(weapons clanging)

187
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:48,373
- It's an assassination attempt!

188
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:50,091
(man groans)

189
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:53,008
(panther growling)

190
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,220
- I don't need your help!

191
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,570
- Yes, doing so well on your own.

192
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,584
- Duck!

193
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:01,250
(weapons clanging)

194
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,083
Here, catch!

195
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:04,320
- Kill him!

196
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,938
- Rennick, over here.

197
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,823
- Can't you all stop one man?

198
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,041
(groaning)

199
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:18,868
(fabric ripping)

200
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:22,548
(groans)

201
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:32,439
(playful music)

202
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,641
- Speak a word and your dead.

203
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:45,683
- What is it you're doing?

204
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:46,823
- Shh, be quiet.

205
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,620
They'll tire of looking
and I'll be on my way.

206
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,240
(man groans)

207
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,479
(cow moos)

208
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:01,495
- Uh, they seem to be quite determined.

209
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,950
- You don't wanna push me here.

210
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,383
I'm already three steps past
too far with blood on my sword.

211
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,530
Have I made my point?

212
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,613
(laughs)

213
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,213
(slapping)

214
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:24,046
- You there!

215
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,203
What's so funny?

216
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,973
- It's a private joke.

217
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,580
- Well, I for one could
certainly use a good laugh.

218
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,610
- Yeah, why don't you tell us?

219
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,443
- Now.

220
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,763
- What, and have to explain it 10 times?

221
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:46,890
Now, you lads look like men of a keen eye.

222
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,860
May I offer you some of my choice items?

223
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,090
This little bauble, for instance,

224
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,823
this comes from the furthest
reaches of the Third Wood.

225
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,037
Hey, you over there, clear off!

226
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,475
- There he is!

227
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:13,871
(sighs)

228
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:27,453
- Ponflection, you know me.

229
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,323
Upon reflection you will know him.

230
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,993
- You can go away now.

231
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,793
- Quite a powerful talent
for a simple merchant.

232
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,341
Who are you?

233
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:46,523
- I'm three steps passed too
far so don't you push me.

234
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,053
Now go save the world.

235
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,013
- I think you owe me some
answers, Mr. Malthon, is it?

236
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,570
What do you know of the prophecy?

237
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,910
- I owe you nothing and I just

238
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,036
helped you if you'll recall.

239
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:04,360
Hey!

240
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,060
Will you watch where you're going?

241
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:08,137
- Malthon.

242
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:12,126
Malthon.

243
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,570
- [Malthon] What are you staring at?

244
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,403
- Malthon, is it?

245
00:13:18,403 --> 00:13:22,160
You know, I once read a tale
of a great spell weaver,

246
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,654
best in the land,

247
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:27,843
that is until his own brother,
Pentakis, cut off his hand.

248
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:32,194
Nohtlam was his name.

249
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:35,928
He managed to escape and
hasn't been seen since.

250
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:37,800
(laughs)

251
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,146
Come to think of it, a wagon like this

252
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:42,430
would make a very good disguise.

253
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,980
- Are you finished?

254
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,490
- Couldn't you have come
up with something better

255
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,550
than to have your own
name spelled backwards?

256
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,190
- I'm sure I could if my name was Nohtlam.

257
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,973
But as you can see I have two hands.

258
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,650
- Yes, but you know of the riddle.

259
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,533
- What, that makes me some
kind of rogue techno wizard?

260
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,920
- Where did you find this?

261
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,933
- Um, I'm a trader, I trade.

262
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,570
- Is this really the True Cabal?

263
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,450
- If that's what it
says, that's what it is.

264
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,340
- You know where to find
this, were there any more?

265
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,693
Can you take me there?

266
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,970
- In the Lost City of Valdur,
maybe, you have to look.

267
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,733
No, go find it yourself.

268
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,933
Now, did I miss anything?

269
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,140
- You've read all those then?

270
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,840
- Of course.
- Well, then you know!

271
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,610
If you've read the books, you know!

272
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,213
- Really, and where do
you see that written?

273
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,270
- What is it with everyone?

274
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,200
- Keep your voice down.

275
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,120
- Why should I?

276
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,520
The world is coming to an end!

277
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,610
I would love to at stay home
with slippers and cream, too,

278
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,200
but I have no choice.

279
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,460
- You don't want me.

280
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,443
- I will not let you walk away.

281
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:08,303
- No, no, no!

282
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:11,224
God, no!

283
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:13,040
No, no.

284
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,603
You will not interfere.

285
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,902
- Sorry.
- No, stay away!

286
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:18,735
Oh, no.

287
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:22,037
Goddammit, no, no!

288
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:22,870
(choking)

289
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,703
No!

290
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:25,393
Alright, alright, I'll help.

291
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:31,517
(panting)

292
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:32,447
- I said I was sorry.

293
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:33,280
- Right.

294
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:36,298
Look.

295
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,340
Do you happen to have a plan?

296
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,173
- Yes.

297
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,297
I go to appeal to the Lower Houses.

298
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:46,750
- There are no Lower Houses.

299
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,690
Opal and his scavengers
have all but wiped them out.

300
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,150
- Then I'll go to the clans.

301
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,983
- Forget it.

302
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,083
This is your show, Lord Protector.

303
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,533
Whether you want it or not.

304
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,250
As you read so shall you lead.

305
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,083
Remember that?

306
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,873
Don't ask.

307
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,993
Alright, look.

308
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,550
I know where you can find a fighter.

309
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,970
I will help you that
far and then I am done.

310
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,103
Is that clear?

311
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,433
Good.

312
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,640
We should move on.

313
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,473
Hop in the back.

314
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:37,549
(singing in foreign language)

315
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:46,403
- You're just full of
surprises, aren't you?

316
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,533
- Do you no longer practice the art?

317
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,930
You're going to need it.

318
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:59,618
(cow grunting)

319
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:13,686
(singing in foreign language)

320
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:18,563
(zooming)

321
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,643
(swords clanging)

322
00:17:25,643 --> 00:17:29,770
- This is a waste of time,
it can't be the place.

323
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,833
- The man you are looking for is

324
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:35,328
known to favor the atmosphere here.

325
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:36,227
(glass breaking)

326
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:39,010
- We are looking for a hero.

327
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,645
- No, you are looking for a fighter.

328
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,770
(crowd cheers)
(crowd applauds)

329
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,937
- [Crowd] Boo!

330
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:48,705
- My turn.

331
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:53,131
- [Crowd] Yay!

332
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:54,006
(glass breaking)

333
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,565
- You silly cretins
wouldn't recognize real art

334
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:57,815
if it reared up and bit ya!

335
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,270
Not a bit of originality.

336
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,745
No style!

337
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:04,590
- What do you mean?
- Terrible form.

338
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,248
- Him?
- Him?

339
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:07,560
(swords clanging)

340
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,393
- C-minor.

341
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,000
(clanging)

342
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,375
No, C-minor, are you deaf?

343
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,244
(clanging)

344
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:18,073
(clanging)

345
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:19,801
(clanging)

346
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,254
(clanging)

347
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:23,087
Ah.

348
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,223
(clanging)

349
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:29,806
(upbeat music)

350
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,660
Ah, Harold of Burgandy.

351
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,850
I bid you,

352
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,293
go back to your master and give him this.

353
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:39,543
(smashing)

354
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:44,487
Head up.

355
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,793
Chest.

356
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,450
(smashing)

357
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,423
(clanging)

358
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:55,256
- What?

359
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:57,989
(woman groans)

360
00:18:57,989 --> 00:19:00,572
(crowd cheers)

361
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:13,743
- When we who eat are hungry.

362
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:17,257
When we who drink are dry.

363
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,090
(clanging)

364
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,699
When we who blow are frozen.

365
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:25,221
Our answer to nefarious Opal
and his lot will be the same.

366
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:27,471
(groaning)

367
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,609
(crashing)

368
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,290
We give you back defiance for defiance.

369
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,033
Menace for menace.

370
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,923
Blow for blow.

371
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:49,591
Ha!
(swords clanging)

372
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,556
Woo hoo hoo!

373
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:56,733
Ole!
(swords clanging)

374
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:57,566
Ya!

375
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:00,147
(groaning)

376
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:00,980
- Ya!

377
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:04,624
(swords clanging)

378
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:05,821
- Ya!

379
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:07,018
- Ya!

380
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:09,475
(swords clanging)

381
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,725
(shouting)

382
00:20:14,427 --> 00:20:19,427
- Ha!
(men screaming)

383
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:25,685
(men screaming)

384
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:30,190
(crowd cheers)
(crowd applauds)

385
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,607
Toast to the pig.

386
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,100
Toast to the victor!

387
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,100
(crowd cheers)
(crowd applauds)

388
00:20:40,702 --> 00:20:41,535
Bow.

389
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:44,294
- [Man] Bravo, bravo!

390
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:47,772
- And now I wish to retire.

391
00:20:56,324 --> 00:20:58,072
Would you be so kind as to remove

392
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:00,280
your fingers from my jacket.

393
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,870
- Whoa, easy friend.

394
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,203
- Or I will remove them from your hand.

395
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,600
- We're just trying to help.

396
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,856
- Ah.

397
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:16,763
Well, gentlemen.

398
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:21,171
Are you a merchant?

399
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,390
- I travel.

400
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,223
- Ah.

401
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:26,190
A poor merchant.

402
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,913
- Can I buy you a drink, master?

403
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,480
- You may call me Dunnigan.

404
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,790
And the price of this courtesy?

405
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,290
- A few words of conversation.

406
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,310
- I can tell you're the long-winded type.

407
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,963
Better make it a bottle.

408
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,604
- Ah, yes, here we are.

409
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:55,219
(instrumental music)

410
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:57,969
(wine splashing)

411
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,454
(mugs clashing)

412
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:04,488
- No.

413
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:05,610
- No?

414
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,999
Wait, did you just say no?

415
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:09,020
I don't believe this.

416
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,274
- Nothing against you, my friend.

417
00:22:12,274 --> 00:22:15,023
I'm honored that you consider
me one of the Chosen,

418
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:19,333
but I am already sworn to a quest

419
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,870
by the balls of my father.

420
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,493
- You brought us to him?

421
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,214
- This place was your idea.

422
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:30,760
- I am Dunnigan Bragg, the last living

423
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,000
heir of the clan of the blade.

424
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,560
- Makers of the legendary dressine, yes!

425
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,100
But you can't make it anymore, can you?

426
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,110
- Do not test my honor!

427
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,278
- Your family's honor couldn't be saved

428
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,390
by a hoard of Darginian virgins.

429
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,223
- An insult!

430
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,821
- Temper, temper.

431
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:53,403
- Stop it, both of you!

432
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:58,453
- I have not lost my ardor.

433
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,133
I suffer from an absence of material.

434
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,250
It's a rare, golden flower.

435
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:09,533
Furnished from our rarest world.

436
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,796
It is my quest to find it.

437
00:23:13,796 --> 00:23:15,629
Or die in the attempt.

438
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,180
- I am loathe to bring this up,

439
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,673
but Rennick will be
traveling to many dismal

440
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:25,788
out of the way places on his quest.

441
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,483
You might just find your weed.

442
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:35,930
- You are an extremely irksome presence.

443
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,490
- And you are a drunk.

444
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,613
You'd be better off without him, Rennick.

445
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:57,732
- It shall be an honor
to assist you, Lord.

446
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:10,217
(crashing)

447
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:13,300
- Thank you so much for your support.

448
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,769
(cow grunting)

449
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,283
- There, I've helped him!

450
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,383
Have a nice quest.

451
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,977
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

452
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,753
- Are you done?

453
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:46,920
(cow grunting)

454
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,530
- I'll help you to the edge
of town and that's final.

455
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,083
- Right, whatever you say.

456
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,490
Tell me, what's with you and the glove?

457
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,323
- It's.

458
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,683
Don't ask!

459
00:25:00,963 --> 00:25:03,713
(dramatic music)

460
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:11,999
Wagon, wagon, get him to the wagon.

461
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,416
- Hold, merchant.

462
00:25:14,945 --> 00:25:17,063
Is this your wagon?

463
00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:19,210
- This is the Lord Protector.

464
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,870
Now let us through.

465
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,703
- Take him!

466
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:24,197
- I probably should have told you

467
00:25:24,197 --> 00:25:26,627
I had a bit of a run in with Pentakis.

468
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:28,390
- Guys, to the fight!

469
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,223
Charge!

470
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:32,954
(swords clanging)

471
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:39,975
(groaning)

472
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:45,979
(swords clanging)

473
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:02,553
- Dunnigan, we're out of here, now!

474
00:26:02,553 --> 00:26:07,553
(groaning)
(swords clanging)

475
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:14,699
Brace for it!

476
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:24,885
(ground rumbling)

477
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:26,874
Come on!

478
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:45,144
(panting)

479
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:48,520
- You know, I shall flee no further.

480
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,920
You shame me, Lord Protector.

481
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,210
- That was some shield you
wove back there, Malthon.

482
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,133
- It wasn't me.

483
00:26:58,474 --> 00:27:00,757
I said it wasn't me.

484
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:02,670
- Would anyone care for a drink?

485
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,053
- Look, Malthon.

486
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:06,625
Do you know a quick way outta here?

487
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,458
(laughs)

488
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:11,080
- Anywhere we go now there
are at least 27 gates,

489
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,456
five causeways, and 15 tunnels

490
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,960
between us and the outer walls.

491
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,611
- All heavily-guarded, no doubt.

492
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:17,540
- No doubt.

493
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,653
- I smell a fight, cheers!

494
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,770
- Well, we're awfully popular
for a bunch of loaners.

495
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,820
- Look, don't draw your swords.

496
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,370
Maybe we can bargain with them.

497
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,910
- Charge.

498
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,813
- Right.
- Hold!

499
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:41,680
- Well, Rennick, I see you found

500
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,860
some nice friends to play with.

501
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,390
I've come to help you.

502
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,090
- My lady of the House of Diamond.

503
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,154
The tales of your beauty
are as hollow lies

504
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:53,403
when confronted by your presence.

505
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,243
Blade Master Dunnigan at your service.

506
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,293
- I am honored.

507
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,453
Look, Rennick, manners.

508
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,430
Excellent work, Austin.

509
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,423
All are dismissed.

510
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,438
(clapping)

511
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,630
- Bravo.

512
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,199
You might as well call
them all right back here.

513
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,830
We don't need your help.

514
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,714
- Really?

515
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:23,210
I can go wherever I choose, can you?

516
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,920
- My lady has made an excellent point.

517
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,610
- She is not part of this prophecy.

518
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,110
She has no place here!

519
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,451
- Do you dare to walk away from me again?

520
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:34,233
- Oh, perhaps I should just
leap from the nearest window!

521
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,310
- We accept your aid.

522
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,143
- No, we don't.

523
00:28:37,143 --> 00:28:39,580
- Yes, we do.
- Then it's settled.

524
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,784
- Rennick can be so stubborn sometimes.

525
00:28:41,784 --> 00:28:44,434
- I've even thought of the
perfect disguises for you.

526
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,860
- Just to the city gates

527
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,823
and then you must go back to safety.

528
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:53,983
- We'll see.

529
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:58,519
(grumbling)

530
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,153
Bearers, up!

531
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:03,986
- One!

532
00:29:05,564 --> 00:29:06,716
Two!

533
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:07,549
Three!

534
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:17,111
(grunting)

535
00:29:27,787 --> 00:29:29,250
- There, I'm done.

536
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,463
- Yes, far enough.

537
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,133
Now, take your shopping and go.

538
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,683
- Such a way with words.

539
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:39,834
No.

540
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:47,690
(Lady Diamond singing)

541
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,973
- Someone should tell her
we're trying to remain hidden.

542
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,840
- Oh, now it's we, aye?

543
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,772
You tell her.

544
00:29:56,772 --> 00:29:59,437
- Cowards, the both of you.

545
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:05,223
Your pardon, my lady.

546
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:07,300
- [Lady Diamond] Is that
you, Dunnigan, dear?

547
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,619
- At your service.

548
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:11,590
I regret that the pleasure
of your song, alas,

549
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,083
endangers the wellbeing of our persons.

550
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,723
- Oh, that's a good one!

551
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:20,473
(dramatic music)

552
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:38,243
(fire sizzles)

553
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:39,629
I don't believe I allowed myself

554
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,880
to be roped into this bloody.

555
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,900
- An excellent time for an
herbal scouting exhibition.

556
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,733
- So.

557
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,763
What's with old grumpy glove?

558
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:08,460
- Says his name is
Malthon, he's a merchant.

559
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,723
Plus other talents.

560
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,416
First I thought he was Nohtlam.

561
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,960
- (chuckles) The rogue?

562
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,450
Rennick, he has two hands, both very real.

563
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,353
- Yes, I know, I know, but.

564
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:21,130
There's something not straight about him.

565
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,163
I just can't put my finger on it.

566
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,043
He's the equal of any guilder I know.

567
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,397
Maybe even better than
your friend, Pentakis.

568
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,880
- I didn't come here to argue.

569
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,320
Believe it or not, I've come to help!

570
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,030
- All I've heard from you is argument.

571
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,510
- That's because you've
forgotten how to listen.

572
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,980
- I know how to listen!

573
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,533
It is the rest of the
realm that has gone deaf!

574
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:48,380
- Rennick, in case you haven't
noticed things have changed!

575
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,030
Your self-imposed exile has made you blind

576
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,330
to the very world that
you are trying to save!

577
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,733
- I don't know why I even bother.

578
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,963
Your apathy has sealed our doom.

579
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:14,990
- You're simply adorable when
you're being melodramatic.

580
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,710
All is not doomed.

581
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,990
There's others that might help.

582
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,180
- I have enough riddles to deal with.

583
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,489
What others?

584
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:23,389
- [Malthon] Perhaps she could tell us.

585
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,753
- Mariana?

586
00:32:26,753 --> 00:32:30,280
- We found her snooping
alongside the road.

587
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,203
- What we?

588
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,140
- Hear me, Lord Protector.

589
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,000
I come by firth oath, fealty to the lord.

590
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,493
- Malthon, let her go!

591
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,810
- Fealty to the lord.

592
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,893
Here, warm yourself by the fire.

593
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,871
- How did you find me?
- Long has my mind

594
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:52,633
held the key waiting for
the leader of the Chosen.

595
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,700
- [Rennick] I am no leader.

596
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,950
- It has always been
for a protector to lead.

597
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,843
There is more I have to tell.

598
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,663
After your departure from the Great Hall,

599
00:33:07,663 --> 00:33:09,740
Pentakis branded you rogue,

600
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,210
claiming you had stolen his property

601
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,019
and kidnapped his son, Priamus.

602
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:15,610
- Priamus?

603
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,720
Priamus is his son?

604
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,100
- He hunts for you,

605
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,976
demanding your hands in
payment for your crime.

606
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:22,308
- How original.

607
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:24,120
- [Mariana] You must move quickly.

608
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,953
When you get to Val--

609
00:33:24,953 --> 00:33:27,060
- We are not visiting the lost cities.

610
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,660
We travel to Third Wood.

611
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,642
- But your fighter?

612
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:31,980
- Dunnigan Bragg, at your service.

613
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,690
- Yes, we have a fighter.

614
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,560
We need a hero.

615
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,930
Do you know of Ravelle?

616
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:41,760
- But, Birdwood, our
influence is thin in Outland.

617
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,973
- I smell a fight!

618
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:47,227
- Light!

619
00:33:47,227 --> 00:33:48,468
(muffled shouting)

620
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:50,104
Outsiders!

621
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,598
(screaming)

622
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:56,598
Dunnigan, no!

623
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,197
You gotta get outta here!

624
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:06,583
- There's more!
- Not now.

625
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,513
Mathlon, back up Dunnigan.

626
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,792
- Send me to wait on Dunnigan?

627
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:14,440
- You sure you wanna continue?

628
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,640
The risk could be great.

629
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,863
- Travel safely, friend.

630
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:23,479
Hey!

631
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:27,260
What are you doing?

632
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,093
Those are my things.

633
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:30,966
- They don't want us, they want stuff.

634
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:32,829
(smashing)

635
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:34,390
- Then why not give them your stuff?

636
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,825
- Oh, but you have so much.

637
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,658
Ah!

638
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:40,298
- No!

639
00:34:40,298 --> 00:34:43,348
- I'm about to teach these
ruffians proper sword technique!

640
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:44,958
- Use your talents, Rennick.

641
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,208
We need it now!

642
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:52,166
(static whizzing)

643
00:35:03,693 --> 00:35:05,753
- [Lady Diamond] No, no, hey, hey, hey!

644
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:06,753
That's mine.

645
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:13,703
- Do it!

646
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:16,286
- [Lady Diamond] Give it to me!

647
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:20,169
Give it back!

648
00:35:21,098 --> 00:35:21,931
It's mine!

649
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,401
Come on.

650
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:25,234
It's mine.

651
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,247
No, don't, no, no!

652
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:30,266
- Dunnigan, we're pulling out!

653
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:31,693
Dunnigan, leave it!

654
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:35,481
- [Lady Diamond] No, no,
no, put me down, Dunnigan!

655
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:37,033
- Follow me!

656
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:38,366
To a safe place.

657
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:44,541
(water splashing)
(savages hooting)

658
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:13,429
(dramatic music)

659
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,530
- Malthon, what exactly
are you looking for?

660
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,523
- An access tunnel.

661
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,660
In ancient times, they
were used to carry water.

662
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,730
Now, they're all but forgotten.

663
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,563
- Except by you.

664
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,125
How fortunate.

665
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,375
(chanting)

666
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:39,192
- Ah.

667
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,703
Quickly, my head is killing me.

668
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,120
You know, I wouldn't
want somebody's blade arm

669
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,113
to be severed.

670
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:19,457
(chanting)

671
00:37:20,754 --> 00:37:21,587
- Light.

672
00:37:27,097 --> 00:37:29,884
- Are you sure these tunnels aren't used?

673
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:31,470
- Absolutely.

674
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,783
I travel these ways all the time.

675
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:37,750
- I don't like tunnels.

676
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,943
- Get used to it.

677
00:37:39,943 --> 00:37:43,963
Besides, this way no one can track us.

678
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,947
(animal squawking)

679
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:55,438
(crickets chirping)

680
00:37:57,563 --> 00:37:59,813
(chanting)

681
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,873
Whoa.

682
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:13,564
Oh, the ancient signals work.

683
00:38:13,564 --> 00:38:14,520
Oh.

684
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,760
- I have him.

685
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,610
I need official--

686
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,443
- Move aside.

687
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:21,019
No!

688
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,473
Don't go in!

689
00:38:25,196 --> 00:38:28,407
Watachi, did you get his location?

690
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,303
- No, I'm--
- Find them!

691
00:38:31,303 --> 00:38:33,321
- I regret I was--
- Do you hear me?

692
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:34,154
Find them.

693
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,573
(thrilling music)

694
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,670
- [Narrator] With papers in hand,

695
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,800
they reached the border of the Outland.

696
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,823
From there, they would
pass into Third Wood,

697
00:38:53,823 --> 00:38:58,440
a fearful place of magic and mystery

698
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,567
in search of Ravelle, the healer.

699
00:39:03,922 --> 00:39:06,589
(eagle calling)

700
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:13,878
As for my Priamus, it
was then he discovered

701
00:39:13,878 --> 00:39:16,983
how far-reaching
Pentakis's grip had become.

702
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,113
The mark of Pentakis served
as Priamus's safe passage.

703
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,100
They searched, and as
time passed hope waned,

704
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,463
tempers flared.

705
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:41,259
(wolf howling)

706
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:44,009
(dramatic music)

707
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,003
Only Malthon could hear
the voice of the beast.

708
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:08,233
And thus they were led into
the dark heart of Third Wood.

709
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,113
- At last, welcome!

710
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,904
I've heard you coming for
the last turn of sand.

711
00:40:20,904 --> 00:40:24,570
I'm Ravelle, come in please to my home.

712
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,733
Be warm and eat.

713
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,360
- Our many thanks to you.

714
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,479
I carry the title Lord Protect--

715
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:32,970
- No need for formal talk now.

716
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:33,803
Come in, please.

717
00:40:33,803 --> 00:40:35,860
We'll get to know each
other by a warm fire.

718
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:45,838
(door creaking)

719
00:40:54,678 --> 00:40:56,340
Pendil, that's enough.

720
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,343
You'll eat me out of house and home.

721
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,033
Zesty, my compliments, hostess.

722
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,110
Are you going to eat that, wagon man?

723
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,513
- How can you eat this swill?

724
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:13,430
(banging)

725
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,893
- You be nice.

726
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:22,400
- Brisk ale, anyone,
to top off the evening?

727
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,233
- Legendary!

728
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,870
- Now, tell me why you journeyed

729
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,963
so far to talk of prophecies.

730
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,360
- The riddle points to you
as a member of this quest.

731
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,913
We are the last hope of
defeating the Dark Mist.

732
00:41:41,337 --> 00:41:42,953
- I don't understand.

733
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,635
I'm just a simple herbalist.

734
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:48,150
- Herbs?

735
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,573
My lady, hostess, do you mind
if I go through your bins?

736
00:41:51,573 --> 00:41:54,800
I'm looking for the root
of a rare golden flower--

737
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,146
- They're back there.

738
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,433
Help yourself.

739
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,200
You want me to go with you
because of some dandy tale?

740
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,410
That's ridiculous.

741
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,470
- I know it seems strange
to have all of our lives

742
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,880
affected by something so remote,

743
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,213
but I've made my decision.

744
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,612
The same as everyone else I guess.

745
00:42:22,612 --> 00:42:24,862
(crashing)

746
00:42:27,732 --> 00:42:32,732
(glass shattering)
(metal objects clanging)

747
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,600
- Well, I'm not picking him up.

748
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,603
- Rest here tonight.

749
00:42:40,652 --> 00:42:42,602
I'll give you my answer in the morning.

750
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,086
- Yeah.

751
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:46,468
A little sleep.

752
00:42:46,468 --> 00:42:49,218
(dramatic music)

753
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:13,547
- [Pentakis] They are with you now?

754
00:43:13,547 --> 00:43:15,130
- All but your son.

755
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,297
- [Pentakis] Don't concern
yourself with Priamus.

756
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:24,150
You'll find my son, he has
gone ahead to the caves.

757
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,093
Show me the talisman.

758
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:31,050
Ah, so that is the key.

759
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,752
- Rennick says we'll face the Dark Mist.

760
00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:38,931
You didn't mention that, Pentakis.

761
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:40,137
Why?

762
00:43:40,137 --> 00:43:43,270
- Ravelle, you are a trained assassin.

763
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:46,460
Why would a hint of danger bother you?

764
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,473
- Because I wasn't paid to die.

765
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,720
What's to keep your Mist spawn

766
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,470
from eliminating me, as well?

767
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,230
- You should not fear magic
for magic will protect you.

768
00:43:58,432 --> 00:43:59,265
Catch.

769
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:05,523
It shall identify you as belonging to me.

770
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:09,500
Report when you make final contact.

771
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,159
- You tell me the target now and

772
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:13,010
we'll be done with them tonight.

773
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,010
- No!

774
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:17,150
I need them, for now.

775
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:20,210
Do I need to employ someone else?

776
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,210
- I don't break my contracts.

777
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,223
- See that you don't.

778
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,210
- Put on the amulet, Ravelle.

779
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,034
I'm with you always.

780
00:44:36,034 --> 00:44:38,117
(scoffs)

781
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:54,274
(dramatic music)

782
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,415
(clears throat)

783
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:07,915
- May I be of some assistance?

784
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:14,943
- You should be sleeping.

785
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,140
- I'm a late sleeper.

786
00:45:32,244 --> 00:45:35,693
Pretty handy when cutthroats are about.

787
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:38,889
- And what do you mean by that?

788
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:42,963
- Oh, I often sleep in
disreputable places.

789
00:45:43,893 --> 00:45:45,976
No offense to you, of course.

790
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,934
- None taken.

791
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:50,686
I just like my guests to be comfortable.

792
00:45:50,686 --> 00:45:52,323
I'm so sorry I woke you.

793
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:54,643
- You are too kind.

794
00:45:57,517 --> 00:45:59,143
I thought I heard voices.

795
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,300
- I talk to myself.

796
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,150
- So many lovely girls
suffer from that same malady.

797
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,741
- Comes from living alone.

798
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:12,003
- Alone, lonely, wild woman of the wood.

799
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,720
I know all about reminiscing.

800
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,948
Can't bear to think of
such an honest woman

801
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:23,913
as yourself feeling that way.

802
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,353
From now on, I shall be
your constant companion.

803
00:46:40,873 --> 00:46:42,853
- I haven't said I'm going.

804
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,360
- Oh, I think it's safe to say your going

805
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:52,237
and I will be with you always.

806
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:10,383
- Oh, how clumsy of me.

807
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,753
Are you alright?

808
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,803
- No harm done, mistress.

809
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:23,187
Accidents will happen.

810
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,787
See you in the morning, Ravelle.

811
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,360
- [Narrator] Dunnigan was right.

812
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,136
Ravelle joined the Chosen.

813
00:47:48,136 --> 00:47:51,992
Rennick led them to an ancient
place of gathering forces

814
00:47:51,992 --> 00:47:56,992
where manmade tunnels joined
with rock from a lost age.

815
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,607
The crystal caves, now
known as a place of evil,

816
00:48:03,607 --> 00:48:05,623
a place to be feared.

817
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:18,363
- People go in there and
they don't come out again.

818
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,296
- I hate tunnels and
now I don't like caves.

819
00:48:23,296 --> 00:48:24,610
I'll wait out here.

820
00:48:25,646 --> 00:48:26,963
- We all go.

821
00:48:54,027 --> 00:48:56,329
(chanting)

822
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:57,162
Light.

823
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,940
(chanting)

824
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:40,973
Alright.

825
00:49:40,973 --> 00:49:44,117
We'll have to split up
into teams to search, uh.

826
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:18,210
- Move away from there, yearling!

827
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:20,090
- Malthon, come see what I found.

828
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:22,320
Techno spawn spy!

829
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,410
Sent no doubt by my thrice-damned brother.

830
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,550
Move away.

831
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,610
- No, see, I understand how it works.

832
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,880
And if we can decipher the correct--

833
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,383
(chanting)

834
00:50:32,383 --> 00:50:35,133
(dramatic music)

835
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:46,183
(groaning)

836
00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:50,936
(chanting)

837
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:54,186
(electricity whizzing)

838
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:02,738
(electricity whizzing)

839
00:51:02,738 --> 00:51:03,571
- Malthon!

840
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:05,723
Stop!

841
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,233
You'll bring the whole place down!

842
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,060
Malthon, enough!

843
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,300
- He is in league with the Guild.

844
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,389
- I know him.

845
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:19,094
Priamus, if you stop we can talk.

846
00:51:19,094 --> 00:51:22,554
(electricity whizzing)

847
00:51:22,554 --> 00:51:24,804
(groaning)

848
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,240
You alright?

849
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,583
- Just a little shaken up.

850
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:33,223
- But still delightfully whole.

851
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,280
- Alright, would somebody
tell me what is going on?

852
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,060
Priamus, what are you doing here?

853
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,473
- He's been following us since day one.

854
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,060
I felt him the whole time.

855
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,383
- So that was you?

856
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:48,160
Oh, I should have known.

857
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,210
- Pentakis claims I've kidnapped you.

858
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,350
- Oh, it was a reasonable
assumption on his part

859
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,488
as I did not share with
him my plan of departure.

860
00:51:54,488 --> 00:51:55,500
- Reasonable?

861
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,520
He wants my hands!

862
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,390
- Well, I'm sorry if my arrival
came at an inopportune time

863
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:04,503
but if I've read aright you need me.

864
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,310
- Can we just kill him?

865
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,760
- Where's Diamond?

866
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,070
- My lady, Diamond?

867
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,472
- I'm here.

868
00:52:15,472 --> 00:52:18,722
(electricity whizzing)

869
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:21,650
- [Quadrant Shadow] Welcome to the Chosen.

870
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,638
The repair team is now complete.

871
00:52:23,638 --> 00:52:24,863
- Repair team?

872
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,360
- [Quadrant Shadow] Leader, approach.

873
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,310
- I think i means you.

874
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,160
- [Quadrant Shadow] Leader, approach.

875
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,900
You are well chosen, but
your gathering has been slow.

876
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,870
Only five lights remain to mend the

877
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,890
promise in Shadow Valley.

878
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:45,273
Remember, access to the
Tulcarion seal is the key.

879
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,923
- Wait, is that it?

880
00:52:49,923 --> 00:52:52,190
- [Quadrant Shadow] End time is now.

881
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,943
Chosen, heal the brink.

882
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,027
Peace be by you.

883
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:00,490
- I need a drink.

884
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,093
- Quiet, quiet, I need to think.

885
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:05,135
Dunnigan, fighter.

886
00:53:05,135 --> 00:53:07,500
Ravelle, healer.

887
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,277
Priamus, mage.

888
00:53:10,277 --> 00:53:11,640
- Not bloody likely.

889
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,580
- Lady Diamond must be
part of it, too, Rennick.

890
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,730
- As what, a storage device?

891
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:16,693
- Drop dead.

892
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,263
- So, Priamus.

893
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,630
Eh, it seems like you're meant to be here.

894
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,090
- Does that mean we don't
get to kill the Guild spawn?

895
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:27,110
- Right now we have to figure out how

896
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,050
to find the Shadow Valley.

897
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,460
- We can access the matrix.

898
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,750
- Absolutely not!

899
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,892
- Quiet, Malthon, what
are you talking about?

900
00:53:33,892 --> 00:53:36,253
- Well, the matrix stands before you.

901
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,900
It reflects the energy currents that float

902
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:39,733
through our world.

903
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:40,571
This is our greatest discovery.

904
00:53:40,571 --> 00:53:42,730
See, Pentakis learned
of it using the books

905
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:43,630
that you gave him, Rennick.

906
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,240
- But what does all of that mean?

907
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,760
- We can use the matrix as a doorway

908
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,660
to wherever we need to go.

909
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,400
- Wait, you say you can use it?

910
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,290
Pentakis has trained you as techno-mage?

911
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,597
- I was made for it.

912
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:56,600
All my genetic codes
were chosen by Pentakis

913
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,220
to yield a mind that could
comprehend the ancient ways.

914
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,899
- Pentakis grew you?

915
00:54:00,899 --> 00:54:03,603
- Well, technically he is my father.

916
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,800
Is that not how it is done?

917
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,000
Uh, if you do not wish
to access the matrix,

918
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,230
another alternative would
be to construct a portal.

919
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,010
- Where do you come up with these ideas?

920
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,580
A construct would be unstable at best.

921
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,733
- I merely state our present options.

922
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,423
- Activate the matrix.

923
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,333
- Of course.

924
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:33,520
(dramatic music)

925
00:54:37,978 --> 00:54:38,811
(buzzing)

926
00:54:38,811 --> 00:54:40,900
There, now.

927
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,763
Input, Shadow Valley.

928
00:54:45,233 --> 00:54:47,400
(beeping)

929
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:53,070
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

930
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,240
- Is this where the big
fight is supposed to happen?

931
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,149
On the other side of the world?

932
00:54:57,149 --> 00:54:58,900
- We'll be there in moments.

933
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,253
Proper access codes.

934
00:55:01,793 --> 00:55:02,626
(electric shorting)

935
00:55:02,626 --> 00:55:03,459
- What's the matter?

936
00:55:03,459 --> 00:55:05,570
- Oh, I don't know.

937
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,513
This is not right.

938
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,463
Look out!

939
00:55:09,444 --> 00:55:12,890
- Rennick, how nice of you to call.

940
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:14,737
- Well, well, Pentakis.

941
00:55:14,737 --> 00:55:17,340
I now have proof of your crimes.

942
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,140
Genetic manipulation, the
matrix, crimes for which--

943
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:20,973
- Careful, Lord Protector, he--

944
00:55:20,973 --> 00:55:22,273
- We are talking!

945
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,870
Such manners.

946
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,635
You learned that insolence from your

947
00:55:29,635 --> 00:55:32,110
short time with Rennick.

948
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,770
Who else is there?

949
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,800
- Oh, Lady Diamond!

950
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,593
- [Rennick] Diamond!

951
00:55:39,593 --> 00:55:41,926
(screaming)

952
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,297
- What ever gave you the
idea you could be a leader?

953
00:55:48,297 --> 00:55:50,900
The Bragg clan?

954
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,540
Poor choice.

955
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,080
- What about me, my brother?

956
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,247
I am one of the Chosen.
- Traitor!

957
00:55:56,247 --> 00:55:57,370
- Rennick, raise the bond.

958
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:58,750
- Rogue!

959
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:03,550
Priamus, I created you,
you cannot deny me this.

960
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:05,920
Give me the location of the seal.

961
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,847
- Don't tell him.

962
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:10,877
- The Shadow Valley.

963
00:56:13,235 --> 00:56:15,024
- Goodbye, my son.

964
00:56:15,024 --> 00:56:17,680
(laughs)

965
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,900
(ground rumbling)

966
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,017
- Cave in!

967
00:56:20,017 --> 00:56:21,350
- Everybody out!

968
00:56:23,637 --> 00:56:28,637
- My things!

969
00:56:36,483 --> 00:56:38,990
- I think we go that way?

970
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,470
- You think?

971
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:43,083
- A Groton walk has
more brains than you do.

972
00:56:45,088 --> 00:56:47,443
- Now just try it, little man.

973
00:56:51,017 --> 00:56:52,883
- Put it away, Malthon.

974
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,983
Put it away.

975
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:07,804
(grunting)

976
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,023
- I must beg your pardon, hostess.

977
00:57:17,023 --> 00:57:19,130
- Just stay away from me!

978
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:19,963
You, too!

979
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,453
- This is just great.

980
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:32,347
Dunnigan, keep an eye on things.

981
00:57:47,316 --> 00:57:48,233
- Pentakis.

982
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:53,232
(creature squawking)
Pentakis, are you there?

983
00:57:53,232 --> 00:57:54,670
- I can barely here you?

984
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:55,610
Where are you?

985
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:58,960
- We're in some kind of manmade tunnel.

986
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
I'm not sure, but we're heading

987
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,410
for Lady Diamond's southern stronghold.

988
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,460
- We're trying to get a fix on you.

989
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:08,910
Ravelle, it's time to earn your keep.

990
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,493
Eliminate Dunnigan.

991
00:58:17,843 --> 00:58:20,660
Ravelle!
(creature squawking)

992
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,410
Oh, blast that woman.

993
00:58:26,195 --> 00:58:27,028
Watachi!

994
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:33,350
- I could not get a fix on them, master.

995
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:36,063
- No need to worry, Watachi.

996
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:41,249
She said they were in some
tunnels going to Diamond's.

997
00:58:41,249 --> 00:58:43,332
(laughs)

998
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:49,255
Oh, very clever, my brother, very clever.

999
00:58:50,355 --> 00:58:52,653
They're in the ancient tunnels.

1000
00:58:55,058 --> 00:59:00,058
We will just flood them all.

1001
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,873
Here.

1002
00:59:05,481 --> 00:59:07,437
Here.

1003
00:59:07,437 --> 00:59:08,979
(laughs)

1004
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:09,812
And here.

1005
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:12,449
Whoosh!

1006
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,317
- Dunnigan.

1007
00:59:21,178 --> 00:59:22,423
You startled me.

1008
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,930
- I Know you're up to something

1009
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,103
and I will find out what it is.

1010
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:40,830
I had no idea your feelings
for me were so strong, my lady.

1011
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:42,330
- I should kill you right now.

1012
00:59:43,257 --> 00:59:44,437
Right now.

1013
00:59:44,437 --> 00:59:46,917
- I'm sure we'd make
the crossing together.

1014
01:00:03,405 --> 01:00:04,238
- Ah!

1015
01:00:05,209 --> 01:00:06,042
You, no!

1016
01:00:07,194 --> 01:00:08,027
You!

1017
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:14,680
Let me finish, please.
(whimpering)

1018
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,242
(sobbing)

1019
01:00:37,511 --> 01:00:38,344
Nohtlam.

1020
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:42,603
Yes.

1021
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:45,007
Nohtlam.

1022
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,963
A long time ago.

1023
01:00:49,995 --> 01:00:52,078
(laughs)

1024
01:00:53,948 --> 01:00:55,807
Uh, I prefer Malthon now.

1025
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,923
- Alright, then, Malthon.

1026
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,793
I think it is time for that explanation.

1027
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,113
Tell the tale.

1028
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:17,950
(sighs)

1029
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:18,783
- This hand.

1030
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,903
This hand was a gift.

1031
01:01:29,683 --> 01:01:34,063
A gift from the Dark Mist.

1032
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,550
Pentakis and I have
fought this battle before.

1033
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:43,913
He won and took my hand in the process.

1034
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,250
I went to his secret pool,

1035
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,483
a place where the Dark
Mist had penetrated.

1036
01:01:50,785 --> 01:01:51,618
(steam blowing)

1037
01:01:51,618 --> 01:01:52,451
No!

1038
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:55,003
The Dark Mist sensed my emotions.

1039
01:01:58,853 --> 01:02:01,733
It knew what I wanted and it wanted me.

1040
01:02:03,574 --> 01:02:06,824
(electricity whizzing)

1041
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:11,814
(screaming)

1042
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,833
It talks to me, Rennick.

1043
01:02:18,503 --> 01:02:21,023
It wants something.

1044
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:27,323
I don't know how much is me
and how much is it anymore.

1045
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,243
I could kill all of you.

1046
01:02:32,187 --> 01:02:35,403
Not me, but this thing.

1047
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,177
- The hand is part of you, Malthon.

1048
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,800
From what I've read of the Dark Mist,

1049
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,630
it shadows the needs of the host.

1050
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:50,603
If you kill one of us it is
because you harbor that desire.

1051
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:54,763
It is you.

1052
01:02:59,130 --> 01:02:59,963
Take it.

1053
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:17,143
- Wait.

1054
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,360
We have to get out of here now.

1055
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,523
This is a trap.

1056
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,793
Pentakis has found us.

1057
01:03:37,824 --> 01:03:40,160
- Priamus, glad to see
you're still with us.

1058
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,420
Everybody, we are out of here, now!

1059
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,670
- He can't be moved, Rennick.

1060
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:43,560
- We have to.

1061
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,695
- He can't, he's hurt!

1062
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,620
- The tunnel is going to flood.

1063
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,453
- Flood?

1064
01:03:47,453 --> 01:03:48,690
I thought you said it was safe?

1065
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:50,020
- Dunnigan, I really don't have time

1066
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,400
to debate this right now.

1067
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,256
- Doors.

1068
01:03:52,256 --> 01:03:54,080
- Wait, he's trying to say something.

1069
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,344
- Seal doors.

1070
01:03:56,344 --> 01:03:57,177
- Rennick, the doors.

1071
01:03:57,177 --> 01:04:00,240
Priamus says seal the doors.

1072
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,747
- Doors.

1073
01:04:01,747 --> 01:04:06,747
(waves crashing)
(Water flowing)

1074
01:04:18,235 --> 01:04:19,943
- (together) What doors?

1075
01:04:21,187 --> 01:04:24,678
(waves crashing)

1076
01:04:24,678 --> 01:04:25,511
- Panel.

1077
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,453
Use the panel.

1078
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,673
- It's here!

1079
01:04:37,852 --> 01:04:39,602
- Do something, lads!

1080
01:04:40,996 --> 01:04:41,829
- Come on!

1081
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:46,265
- Malthon, now!

1082
01:04:47,185 --> 01:04:50,685
- That's it, I don't know what else to do.

1083
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:53,460
- Run!

1084
01:04:56,388 --> 01:04:59,420
(door slamming)

1085
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,181
(sighs)

1086
01:05:01,181 --> 01:05:02,431
I hate tunnels.

1087
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,950
- [Narrator] With the aid
of Ravelle and her potions,

1088
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,736
Priamus quickly regained his strength.

1089
01:05:09,736 --> 01:05:11,844
They traveled the tunnels and emerged

1090
01:05:11,844 --> 01:05:16,453
near Lady Diamond's stronghold
filled with new hope.

1091
01:05:18,024 --> 01:05:20,774
(dramatic music)

1092
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:33,069
(sand blowing)
(fly buzzing)

1093
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,070
- The clans gave their word
that this would not happen.

1094
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,713
This is the work of Pentakis.

1095
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:47,573
He's killed them all, destroyed my house!

1096
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:50,823
- With new pure rock, we fail.

1097
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,113
That is why he destroyed it all.

1098
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:55,873
- You see those?

1099
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,570
Solid pure rock.

1100
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:00,703
We don't let him win.

1101
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:08,270
- Malthon, can you
levitate those out of here?

1102
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:09,870
- I suppose we can.

1103
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,550
You realize, of course, it
will leave us almost powerless?

1104
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:13,840
Do you really wanna build a portal

1105
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,960
if you're gonna be too
drained to walk through it?

1106
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,780
- I thrillingly await
your superior suggestion.

1107
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,000
How long to build the portal?

1108
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,150
- Less than a pass if
we all work together.

1109
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,070
Malthon, I could use an extra hand.

1110
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,120
- Let's get to it.

1111
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:32,983
- You go on then.

1112
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:36,620
I'll take care of the dead.

1113
01:06:37,678 --> 01:06:40,261
(rock sliding)

1114
01:06:54,975 --> 01:06:57,558
(rock sliding)

1115
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:11,008
(groaning)

1116
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:18,701
- You did.

1117
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,073
Well.

1118
01:07:23,308 --> 01:07:26,308
(crickets chirping)

1119
01:07:34,187 --> 01:07:35,937
- Goodbye, my friend.

1120
01:07:51,227 --> 01:07:53,977
(fire crackling)

1121
01:08:08,777 --> 01:08:10,277
- I smell a fight.

1122
01:08:14,135 --> 01:08:16,885
(dramatic music)

1123
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:23,649
(warriors giving battle cry)

1124
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,247
- Get to the portal.

1125
01:08:33,185 --> 01:08:34,518
Hey, night, die!

1126
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:42,216
Hey, night!
- Portal activated.

1127
01:08:42,216 --> 01:08:44,883
(whip cracking)

1128
01:08:49,015 --> 01:08:52,015
(soldiers shouting)

1129
01:09:01,107 --> 01:09:04,190
- [Rennick] Malthon, hold the portal.

1130
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:09,763
(swords clanging)

1131
01:09:28,395 --> 01:09:29,228
- Watch it!

1132
01:09:29,228 --> 01:09:30,780
- I'm sorry.

1133
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,030
(groaning)

1134
01:09:38,463 --> 01:09:41,463
(maniacal laughter)

1135
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:08,609
- Quadrant Shadow, Dash Valley.

1136
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:11,776
- [Quadrant Shadow] Enter access code.

1137
01:10:19,956 --> 01:10:22,206
(shouting)

1138
01:10:26,717 --> 01:10:29,550
(swords clanging)

1139
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:33,458
(groaning)

1140
01:10:35,485 --> 01:10:37,818
(screaming)

1141
01:10:42,711 --> 01:10:44,570
(panting)

1142
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:45,423
- That's twice.

1143
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:48,763
- Thanks.

1144
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:50,820
- Couldn't bare the thought of a knife

1145
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:53,023
marring that beautiful back of yours.

1146
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:56,925
(shouting)

1147
01:10:57,897 --> 01:11:00,147
(groaning)

1148
01:11:01,912 --> 01:11:03,500
- Are you alright?

1149
01:11:04,972 --> 01:11:06,543
- Only a flesh wound.

1150
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:09,020
Let's get back to the others.

1151
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:12,440
- Quadrant Shadow, Dash Valley.

1152
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,340
- [Quadrant Shadow] Enter access code.

1153
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,430
- Why isn't it open?

1154
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:20,150
- It says we require an access code.

1155
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,240
- Here, use this!

1156
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:24,937
- Centurion!
- Access granted!

1157
01:11:24,937 --> 01:11:25,937
Portal open.

1158
01:11:27,499 --> 01:11:30,332
Time allowed for passage 20 turns.

1159
01:11:36,204 --> 01:11:37,718
17.
- On the other side.

1160
01:11:37,718 --> 01:11:38,940
- 16.
- Come on.

1161
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:40,590
- Please move a little faster.

1162
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:42,660
I cannot guarantee the
integrity of this construct!

1163
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,160
Let's go, Dunnigan.
- 12, 11.

1164
01:11:45,438 --> 01:11:46,513
- Please hurry.

1165
01:11:46,513 --> 01:11:48,680
- [Quadrant Shadow] 10, 9.

1166
01:11:50,204 --> 01:11:53,193
(whip cracking)

1167
01:11:53,193 --> 01:11:54,840
- Dunnigan!

1168
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,523
- [Quadrant Shadow]
Attention, portal closing.

1169
01:11:57,523 --> 01:11:59,106
In three, two, one.

1170
01:12:02,665 --> 01:12:04,915
(groaning)

1171
01:12:09,278 --> 01:12:10,278
- Oh my god.

1172
01:12:12,053 --> 01:12:14,220
(panting)

1173
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:18,363
Oh.

1174
01:12:23,905 --> 01:12:28,905
(birds chirping)
(groaning)

1175
01:13:22,067 --> 01:13:25,062
(groaning)

1176
01:13:25,062 --> 01:13:27,012
- You will not be fighting for a while.

1177
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:31,340
- Tell that to the Dark Mist.

1178
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:34,810
- Sometimes in life you
don't have a choice!

1179
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:39,243
- You always have a choice, my lady.

1180
01:13:43,983 --> 01:13:46,400
- I believe you dropped this.

1181
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,690
- Never really liked it anyway.

1182
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:06,442
(electricity whizzing)

1183
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,609
(banging)

1184
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:16,873
- A wise choice.

1185
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,833
- For you, for saving my life.

1186
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:33,330
(laughs)

1187
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,230
- I believe it is I that should
be giving you the flowers.

1188
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:40,450
It's your herb, you silly man.

1189
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:43,150
The one you've been looking
for to make your dressine.

1190
01:14:47,069 --> 01:14:47,902
- Aye.

1191
01:14:54,061 --> 01:14:56,966
(laughs)

1192
01:14:56,966 --> 01:14:59,330
(groans)
- We better get outta sight.

1193
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:00,583
We leave at dusk.

1194
01:15:03,077 --> 01:15:05,543
Make what preparations you.

1195
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:07,668
You can.

1196
01:15:12,505 --> 01:15:15,255
(birds chirping)

1197
01:15:53,274 --> 01:15:56,024
(fire crackling)

1198
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:02,610
We'll wait another click
or so and then we go.

1199
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:05,030
- A few turns of sand one way or the other

1200
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,500
will make little difference.

1201
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,023
- You don't have to wait, Rennick.

1202
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:10,943
He's not coming back.

1203
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,870
- What did you say to him?

1204
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,453
- Don't you understand?

1205
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:19,938
His arm is worthless!

1206
01:16:19,938 --> 01:16:22,480
He can't fight!

1207
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,290
He left so that we would
stand a better chance.

1208
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,390
- I know how he feels.

1209
01:16:31,896 --> 01:16:33,288
- Drink this.

1210
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,371
It'll help ease the pain.

1211
01:16:36,519 --> 01:16:38,877
- I have something infinitely better!

1212
01:16:42,718 --> 01:16:47,073
Dressine, that which
gives heart to the hunter,

1213
01:16:48,279 --> 01:16:50,453
courage to the worthy,

1214
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:56,353
and beauty to all women.

1215
01:17:00,798 --> 01:17:01,800
Drink.

1216
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,767
- Dunnigan, what?

1217
01:17:02,767 --> 01:17:04,434
- Go on then, drink!

1218
01:17:08,096 --> 01:17:11,013
(magical tingling)

1219
01:17:14,492 --> 01:17:17,409
(magical tingling)

1220
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:20,666
- That stuff has some kick.

1221
01:17:21,877 --> 01:17:24,794
(magical tingling)

1222
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,437
You do your family proud,
brew master Dunnigan.

1223
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:33,593
- It is superior.

1224
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,483
Is there more?

1225
01:17:35,483 --> 01:17:36,940
- Plenty for all.

1226
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:38,373
If the lady would oblige.

1227
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,990
- It's good to have you back, Dunnigan.

1228
01:17:45,519 --> 01:17:46,363
All of you.

1229
01:17:50,217 --> 01:17:52,103
I'm no good at speeches, I.

1230
01:17:53,557 --> 01:17:55,257
I think you all know what we face.

1231
01:17:58,679 --> 01:17:59,633
To friends.

1232
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,283
And companions.

1233
01:18:05,221 --> 01:18:07,123
It's time we finish this quest.

1234
01:18:14,078 --> 01:18:19,078
- [Dunnigan] Okay.

1235
01:18:30,056 --> 01:18:33,473
- My Lord Protector, if you'd be so kind.

1236
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:44,816
(door creaking)

1237
01:18:54,849 --> 01:18:57,599
(dramatic music)

1238
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:09,520
- Stay your hand.

1239
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,253
Allow me to clear the way.

1240
01:19:17,311 --> 01:19:20,144
(swords clanging)

1241
01:19:21,981 --> 01:19:26,700
(grunting)
(groaning)

1242
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,043
- Their made of Dark mist.

1243
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,840
- Not much of a defense if you ask me.

1244
01:19:32,244 --> 01:19:34,411
Come on then, move across.

1245
01:19:42,606 --> 01:19:45,439
(swords clanging)

1246
01:19:49,434 --> 01:19:51,684
(shouting)

1247
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:57,737
- Well, it seems the Dark Mist knights

1248
01:19:57,737 --> 01:19:59,460
are multiplying exponentially.

1249
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,247
- Move across, yearling!

1250
01:20:06,657 --> 01:20:08,907
(shouting)

1251
01:20:10,491 --> 01:20:13,324
(swords clanging)

1252
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:26,060
(shouting)

1253
01:20:28,434 --> 01:20:29,267
- Come on.

1254
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,580
Give me your hand.

1255
01:20:35,646 --> 01:20:37,063
- Hurry, Malthon!

1256
01:20:38,717 --> 01:20:40,717
- Thanks, Malthon.
- Run!

1257
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:48,871
(Lady Diamond shouting)
(warrior shouting)

1258
01:20:48,871 --> 01:20:50,005
- I had him.

1259
01:20:50,005 --> 01:20:50,838
- I know.

1260
01:20:52,135 --> 01:20:54,385
(shouting)

1261
01:21:05,005 --> 01:21:05,922
- Dunnigan!

1262
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,793
- At last, a worthy challenge.

1263
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:15,233
You travel on, I'll catch up later.

1264
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:20,900
- I won't leave you.

1265
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,473
- I can't tell you how touched I am,

1266
01:21:22,473 --> 01:21:25,367
but the others need an
assassin of your caliber.

1267
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:27,297
- You knew?

1268
01:21:27,297 --> 01:21:29,844
- Can we possibly take this up later?

1269
01:21:29,844 --> 01:21:32,556
- You are the most impossible man I have

1270
01:21:32,556 --> 01:21:35,800
ever met and I hate you!

1271
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,633
- What's that?

1272
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:38,663
I love you, too!

1273
01:21:43,617 --> 01:21:45,867
(shouting)

1274
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:49,953
- It's not working.

1275
01:21:49,953 --> 01:21:51,923
Pentakis must have altered the codes.

1276
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,263
- Step aside.

1277
01:21:56,997 --> 01:22:00,035
(electricity blasting)

1278
01:22:00,035 --> 01:22:01,035
Knock knock.

1279
01:22:06,509 --> 01:22:08,676
(panting)

1280
01:22:15,058 --> 01:22:15,975
- Pentakis.

1281
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:38,373
- You are here.

1282
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:42,783
Welcome to end times.

1283
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:44,883
- The final seal.

1284
01:22:45,839 --> 01:22:49,330
Pentakis, brother, you know what the

1285
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:51,393
Dark Mist will do if you free it.

1286
01:22:51,393 --> 01:22:54,150
- It will do my bidding!

1287
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:03,340
Brother, it is a distinct
pleasure to see you again.

1288
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:07,721
We have so very much to talk about.

1289
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:08,554
Pain.

1290
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:12,090
- No, Father!

1291
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,560
The massive Dark Mist bound by
the seal is far too powerful.

1292
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,720
You cannot control it.

1293
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:20,285
- I made you too well
and you talk too much.

1294
01:23:20,285 --> 01:23:21,118
Air!

1295
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,173
(choking)

1296
01:23:24,173 --> 01:23:25,090
- Pentakis!

1297
01:23:26,162 --> 01:23:27,495
He's a yearling!

1298
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:32,923
- I can make a new one.

1299
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:39,200
Lady Diamond, the most
precious prize of all.

1300
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:40,990
Isn't she beautiful, Rennick?

1301
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:43,450
- Don't you touch her.

1302
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:46,920
- Oh, I will do much more than that.

1303
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,950
You will be my conduit to remove the seal.

1304
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:52,780
- Over my dead body.

1305
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,813
- Yes, well.

1306
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:57,263
If you insist!

1307
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:58,983
- No!

1308
01:24:07,257 --> 01:24:09,507
(groaning)

1309
01:24:14,413 --> 01:24:16,663
(groaning)

1310
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:21,703
- God!

1311
01:24:21,703 --> 01:24:24,162
- Now the conduit is in place.

1312
01:24:24,162 --> 01:24:27,657
I could do with a little more power!

1313
01:24:28,615 --> 01:24:31,865
(electricity whizzing)

1314
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:40,295
I have fulfilled the prophecy!

1315
01:24:40,295 --> 01:24:41,190
(groaning)

1316
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:43,873
Let the Dark Mist rise!

1317
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:50,870
(electricity whizzing)

1318
01:25:13,255 --> 01:25:15,588
(screaming)

1319
01:25:18,402 --> 01:25:20,735
(screaming)

1320
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:24,351
- Rennick, stay with me.

1321
01:25:24,351 --> 01:25:25,384
- He's killing her!

1322
01:25:25,384 --> 01:25:26,217
- The seal.

1323
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,824
We have to stop it before
it builds up more power!

1324
01:25:30,824 --> 01:25:33,074
(groaning)

1325
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:38,816
- Rennick!

1326
01:25:38,816 --> 01:25:40,483
- Where the fuck is the crystal?

1327
01:25:53,952 --> 01:25:54,785
More!

1328
01:25:58,075 --> 01:26:00,764
Give it everything you got!

1329
01:26:00,764 --> 01:26:03,649
(shouting)

1330
01:26:03,649 --> 01:26:05,982
(exploding)

1331
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:09,704
- Don't let it pull you in!

1332
01:26:15,502 --> 01:26:17,502
- [Priamus] Need a hand?

1333
01:26:22,252 --> 01:26:24,502
(shouting)

1334
01:26:27,464 --> 01:26:29,714
(laughing)

1335
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,269
- Diamond, Diamond!

1336
01:26:35,453 --> 01:26:36,286
Oh.

1337
01:26:37,751 --> 01:26:40,084
What am I gonna do with you?

1338
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,170
- Well, technically the quest is over.

1339
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:47,957
I'm in Seranna, Rennick,
you figure it out.

1340
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:52,837
- Thank you, Priamus.

1341
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:56,527
- You're welcome, uncle.

1342
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:05,533
- [Dunnigan] Would
anyone care for a drink?

1343
01:27:08,488 --> 01:27:09,405
- Dunnigan.

1344
01:27:12,578 --> 01:27:13,828
Well, go do it.

1345
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:22,923
- Always.

1346
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,791
- [Narrator] And thus the Lord
Protector solved the Riddle

1347
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:36,790
of the Chosen and led them to victory,

1348
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:41,790
victory that ensured life
to their world, for a time,

1349
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:45,725
but that is another tale.

1350
01:27:45,725 --> 01:27:48,308
(upbeat music)

1351
01:30:10,547 --> 01:30:13,380
(thrilling music)

1352
01:30:51,566 --> 01:30:54,399
(Multicom jingle)
