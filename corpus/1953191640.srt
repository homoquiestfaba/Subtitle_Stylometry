1
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,327
(birds chirping)

2
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,584
-( dog whines)
- Come on.

3
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,320
Let's go.
Come on.

4
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,924
(woman chanting in Hindi)

5
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,960
Hey, "Buddha."

6
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,704
- Love you, Lily.
- Love you, too, Dad.

7
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,400
(sighs)

8
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,152
( horns honking )

9
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,029
( groans )
I already have to get up so early.

10
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:36,329
( Phone ringing )

11
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,960
Shut up.

12
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,078
(treadmill beeps)

13
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,513
-( ringing )
- This is Ash. Leave me a message.

14
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,423
Hey, Ash. It's me.

15
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,449
I need to pick you up
15 minutes early

16
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,861
'cause I still gotta
do some prep

17
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,865
before our meeting
with Winchester.

18
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,389
Call me back.

19
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:14,000
( Reel whines, clicks)

20
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,241
Well, I don't think
we'll be eating her for breakfast.

21
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,812
Is that me?

22
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,819
Nice.
Very Rubenesque.

23
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,589
Miss Tisdale?
Remi's not painting right.

24
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,492
The sky is not green.

25
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,325
Oh.

26
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,355
Well, haven't you ever seen
a winter sunset on the lake

27
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,025
when the sky
turns silver-green?

28
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,763
No.

29
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,464
Well, that's too bad,

30
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,735
because it's one of the most
beautiful sights you'll ever see.

31
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,708
Right, Remi?

32
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,213
Ugh, come on, Ash.

33
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,979
(sirens blaring,
horns honking )

34
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,577
(woman groans)
Where are you?

35
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,213
The fact that they're
involved in litigation

36
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,723
means great clients for us.

37
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,281
I'm persuaded.

38
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,792
No worries, you're fine.

39
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,385
They just started
about 10 minutes ago.

40
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,225
Receptionist:
Coffee, Ms. Tisdale?

41
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,596
I have your contracts,
depositions, profiles,

42
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,259
and your notes.

43
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,532
- Rapture's bringing in huge revenues.
- Approved.

44
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,232
On your recommendation.

45
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,036
Just make sure
they're well vetted.

46
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,598
Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up--

47
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:28,374
Ash.
You're already here.

48
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:32,816
Now that we're all here,
can we get started?

49
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,810
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, baby, that's breakfast!

50
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,254
-( Dog barking )
- Beautiful.

51
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,261
( Gas hisses )

52
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,769
(dog whimpering )

53
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,464
What are you doing?
What? What?

54
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,530
Do you want to play?
You wanna play?

55
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,040
Get it!

56
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,976
-( Dog barking )
- Get it!

57
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,845
( Hissing continues)

58
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,807
Ms. Tisdale:
I can tell you exactly.

59
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,753
Page 13, paragraph 42D.

60
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,415
Yes.
"Pursuant to indemnity,

61
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,447
purchaser shall place
in escrow--"

62
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,559
I'm gonna have to
call you back, Counselor.

63
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,586
I waited for you
for 20 minutes.

64
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,700
- I took a cab early.
- I called, I texted--

65
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,538
I left my phone in the office.

66
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:35,068
If you had moved in with me
like we talked about, you'd know.

67
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,240
Don't even go there, Ash.
Right after you left,

68
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,272
Winchester
chewed me out good.

69
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,014
Well, you do look
good enough to eat.

70
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,919
Don't let them bully you.

71
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,553
If you're not the predator,
you're the prey.

72
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,826
Yeah, easy for you to say.
You just made partner.

73
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,059
You're on your way.

74
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,558
Don't be pissed at me.
I remembered your dress.

75
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,298
I asked you to bring
the green one.

76
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:04,570
But I love this one on you.
And it's my party.

77
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,634
Well, if you love it so much,

78
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,545
then why don't you
just wear it?

79
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,071
Ahem--!

80
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,945
Winny.

81
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,453
Take it easy on my girl.

82
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,615
- See you at 7:00?
- Wouldn't miss it.

83
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,820
Tisdale.

84
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,627
You have to be our face
on the merger.

85
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,462
I'd rather have a partner lead,

86
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,765
but you have the best rapport
with United Textiles.

87
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,964
Of course.
I'd be honored, sir.

88
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,468
Familiarize yourself
with their share exchange ratios

89
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,101
and employee contracts.

90
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,976
My office, noon?
We'll work through lunch.

91
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,107
I'll be there. Thank you.

92
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,379
Jeanne?

93
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,113
"Rapture Real Estate"-
who sent this?

94
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,558
It says, "Call me."
Do you want me to call?

95
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,458
-( Can lid pops)
- Sugar free?

96
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,589
- Of course.
- I love you, Jeanne.

97
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,703
That dog never quits.

98
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,946
-( Loud blast)
-( Lily gasps)

99
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,610
( laughter )

100
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,485
That's okay, Remi.

101
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,199
Woman on intercom:
Miss Tisdale?

102
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,263
Not now. I've got to be in
Winchester's office in two minutes.

103
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,707
It's your sister.
She says it's urgent.

104
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,910
Lily. I actually can't talk
right now.

105
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,974
I'm right in the mi--

106
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,918
ls-.

107
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,047
Are you joking?

108
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,896
( Sighs )
I'm not going.

109
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,598
Sara...

110
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,665
he was your dad.

111
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,334
I'm already on thin ice
with Winchester and--

112
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,208
I'll manage him.

113
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,214
He lied to all of us and Mom
still thinks he's God's gift.

114
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,886
Sara.
Come on, come on.

115
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,684
You have to go.

116
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,462
Only if you're by my side.

117
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,059
I can't face them
without you.

118
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,367
The firm can't
lose us both right now.

119
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,032
(sighs)

120
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,167
United Textiles will just have to

121
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,734
interface with me.

122
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,078
Sara?

123
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,482
My proposal still stands.

124
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,511
You can turn me down
as much as you like.

125
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,352
I'm still here.

126
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,789
Call me, okay?

127
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,300

You look, uh, like crap.

157
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:01,291
Thanks, Lily.
So do you.

158
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,159
Besides, you like snakes.

159
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,639
Yeah, well,
you like boys.

160
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,668
Hey, no boy?
Where's your swank L.A. lawyer?

161
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,044
Oh, uh--
he had to work.

162
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,276
Huh.
Sounds like a putz.

163
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,945
You just sounded
like Dad.

164
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,786
- Where's--
- Come on.

165
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,415
Mommy?

166
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,510
Thought you'd
never get here.

167
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,921
I had to fly into Greensboro.
It was a two-hour drive.

168
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,619
Wish you could've come here
the summer I invited you.

169
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,424
- I guess you won.
- Won?

170
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,625
Whatever cruel game
you were playing with your father.

171
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,402
- Now you don't have to see him after all.
- Mom.

172
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,961
She didn't mean that.

173
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,567
( Sighs )
'Course, he didn't know I'd need them.

174
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,339
- Need what, Mama?
- Keys to the shed.

175
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,473
We mow on Monday.
Someone's got to mow the grass.

176
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,779
So you can hire a gardener.

177
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,252
Mom: Dave Boyers
at the bank might know.

178
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,085
- About our shed?
- No, where those papers were.

179
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,183
- Your father's papers.
- What papers?

180
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,423
- His passport? Stocks?
- Sara.

181
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,659
- Give her a chance.
- This is something that I can handle.

182
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,691
- I did go to law school.
- And you never came back.

183
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,603
Lily? We're gonna need
some food for the reception.

184
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,608
Yeah, I'll go to Tinnell's
and order.

185
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,770
No, I can go.
I have to pick up some things.

186
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,240
- Mom, I've got it.
- No.

187
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:03,378
You've already paid
for a plane ticket, a rental car.

188
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,355
Lord knows
when we'll ever see you again.

189
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,455
I also need some ketchup.

190
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,997
I shouldn't have come.

191
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,695
Then why did you?

192
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,670
'Cause you'd never forgive me
if I didn't.

193
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,368
Sara, she won't admit it,
but she's--

194
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,932
-( phone ringing )
- Oh.

195
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,775
I have to take this.
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,747
There you are.

197
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,342
- Have you sent the orals?
- Jeanne: Of course.

198
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,751
Also, I need you
to do me a favor

199
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,843
and move my flight up.

200
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,595
- Man: You married, huh?
- Sara: No.

201
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,657
- Boyfriend?
- Yes.

202
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,258
Dang.

203
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,793
'Cause my grandson's 26.
He'd be perfect for you.

204
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,397
These platters will be ready
first thing tomorrow, right?

205
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,238
Okay, I get it, hon'.

206
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,171
Just-- just take this receipt
to the register.

207
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,615
That's all right, I understand
you're very busy. I just-

208
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,645
they're for my dad's funeral.
He decided to blow himself up.

209
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,783
Oh-- Ray
was your daddy, huh?

210
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,157
Sorry.

211
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,685
Anything I can help
you with, I'm Vic.

212
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,358
Anything at all you need,
you let me know.

213
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,197
- Thanks, Vic.
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,635
Oh, ketchup.

215
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,469
It's two aisles over yonder.

216
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,635
You wouldn't happen to have
any sugar-free Red Bull, would you?

217
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,306
Red what?
Might try the candy aisle.

218
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,812
Mrs. Tinnell.

219
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,478
How can I help you, Jim?

220
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,955
Flyers for the wine festival.

221
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,458
Ainsley-- well, hello there.

222
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,723
Jim McCarren, chairman
of the Wine Festival Committee.

223
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,787
I'm running
for re-election next year-

224
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,459
- I don't live here.
- Yes.

225
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,798
- Ainsley...
- Mrs. Tinnell: Can I help you, darling?

226
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,327
Hey, we're gonna miss you
at the meeting, Old Vic.

227
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,203
Hey, why it gotta be
"Old Vic"?

228
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,402
- Whatever happened to "Big Vic"?
- You got old.

229
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,070
(groans)
Umph.

230
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,047
With the platters,
that'll be $46.74.

231
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,549
Oh, my God.

232
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,517
Well, just give me 40, then.
That's fine.

233
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,214
Oh, no, no, no.
It's just so cheap-

234
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,813
in L.A., that would be
like 200 bucks.

235
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,348
In L.A., they should just go
to "Brangelina's" house

236
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,122
and borrow some ketchup.

237
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,651
Mrs. Tinnell:
Wait-- Sara Tisdale?

238
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,961
Goodness!

239
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,528
- I'm so sorry about Ray.
- Thank you.

240
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,063
Ooh, sorry.
We're huggers around here.

241
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,939
Don't you worry
about the platters.

242
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,708
- Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
- Oh, no, no, no.

243
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,716
Your daddy was
a good customer here

244
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,378
since before you could walk.

245
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,182
And a good friend.

246
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,655
You tell your mama and Lily
we're thinking about them, okay?

247
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,715
I will. Thank you.

248
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,586

the ancient creature
living at Smith Mountain Lake.

266
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,688
Group:
We do.

267
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,056
- Sorry I'm late, boys.
- Man #2: Hey, Carl.

268
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,186
- Are we ready to do this?
- Yes, sir.

269
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,664
- Let's do it.
- Okay, okay.

270
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,224
The Smithy Research Society
will hereby come to order.

271
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,701
First order of business-

272
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,328
a moment of silence for Ray.

273
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,304
By the way,
I ran into Ray's daughter at Tinnell's.

274
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,905
All:
Ooh--!

275
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,916
- You wanna marry her.
- No, no, not Lily.

276
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,679
The other one,
the attorney from L.A.

277
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,778
- Sara?
- Oh.

278
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,288
Okay, next order
of business.

279
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,449
What did we learn
from our last stakeout?

280
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,421
- Larry?
- No Mallomars.

281
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,796
They melted
all over my backpack.

282
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,769
Carl:
Okay, boys. New business.

283
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,001
The Smithy Research
Society now has...

284
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,508
night vision.

285
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,909
( laughs )
Oh, wow.

286
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,708
He can hide from us
no more.

287
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,181
- That's very true.
- Man: Ooh, Larry.

288
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,343
I can see your chakras.

289
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,319
Well, get 'em off me.

290
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,313
Bob: Hey, you guys
see Futterman's show last night?

291
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,251
- Larry: Of course.
- Russell: Yeah, buddy.

292
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,449
Carl: Hey, you know what?
We should get Futterman to come here.

293
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,856
Vic: Mark Futterman ain't gonna
come to Smith Mountain Lake.

294
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,088
He goes for big-name stuff.

295
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,824
Bob: Yeah, like that episode
on Bigfoot they found in Malaysia.

296
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,924
No, no, Bob, that's stupid
because Bigfoot ain't real.

297
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:27,460
I know Bigfoot's not real, Carl.

298
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,472
Vic:
I think Bigfoot killed Kennedy.

299
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,965
Ash? Ash?

300
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,979
Oh, my God, Ash.
I can actually almost hear you.

301
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,571
How's it going?

302
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,947
This is way more stressful
than I thought it was gonna be.

303
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,043
I just-- I wish
that you were here.

304
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,849
. L..
-( phone line clicks)

305
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,118
Ash? Ash?

306
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,853
Oh, this is so cool.

307
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,258
- What do you see?
- What is it?

308
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,819
I think I see Sara.

309
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,797
Vic: Hey, are you looking
for Smithy or Lily?

310
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,025
Man:
What are you doing?

311
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,332
( Yells )
Argh! Hey!

312
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,135
Hey there, Tyler.

313
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,641
It's just the, uh,
Smithy Research Society.

314
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,166
We're on a stakeout.

315
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,810
Ain't gonna find Smithy
up there, boys.

316
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,617
Just remember,
the water's this way.

317
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:19,987
- Absolutely.
- Yes, sir.

318
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,582
We did know that.
Thank you.

319
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,559
Thank you
for protecting and serving.

320
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,687
- Have a good night.
- Namaste.

321
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,458
( Groans )
I keep getting disconnected.

322
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,299
Why don't you stop torturing us all
and use the house phone?

323
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,327
Because the bill
would be astronomical

324
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,397
and you won't let me
give you money.

325
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,476
Dear Lord,
bless this food for our use

326
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,676
and thank you
for bringing Sara back.

327
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,348
Please take good care of Ray.

328
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,378
Amen.

329
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:03,122
Still dating that Ashland?

330
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,726
Ash, yes.

331
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,567
What is it,
three years now?

332
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,368
Since I graduated
law school.

333
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,999
And he still
hasn't proposed?

334
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,805
Actually, he has.

335
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,812
Twice.

336
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,405
Can't be serious if he won't even
come to your father's funeral.

337
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,246
I mean, what kind of a man
is that?

338
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,876
Can we not
talk about Ash, then?

339
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,946
Ahem.

340
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,151
- So, how's work?
- Great, actually.

341
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,060
Our biggest client
loves me.

342
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,690
They want me to be
lead chair on a huge merger,

343
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,563
which should
help me make partner.

344
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,431
Well, you always were
ambitious.

345
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:42,030
- Is that a backhanded compliment?
- No, it's just a statement.

346
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,937
You're ambitious.

347
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,669
Aren't you the one
who always encouraged us

348
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,507
to go out in the world
and make something of our lives

349
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,139
instead of sitting around
with a husband who's always gone

350
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,115
doing who the hell
knows what?

351
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,951
( Door closes )

352
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,583
Jesus, Sara.

353
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,890
The only thing
I came here to say

354
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,123
I guarantee you
she won't hear.

355
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,428
Well, you're the lawyer.
Ever think of the way you're saying it?

356
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,456
Come on, Lily.
Don't give me grief, too.

357
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,265
I can't handle it
from both of you.

358
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,431
All right, then.

359
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:20,034
Come on.
I know what you need.

366
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,286
Nothing's changed, huh?

367
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:37,486
Yeah, it's part of its charm.

368
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,587
- Hey, Lily.
- Hey, Irene.

369
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,155
Do you know my sister Sara?

370
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,689
Honey, I heard
you were in town.

371
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,759
Really? How'd you know?
I just got here.

372
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,705
Hey, I am so sorry
to hear about your dad.

373
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,638
You two need anything,
it's on me tonight.

374
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,839
- You back in town to stay?
- No.

375
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,906
I mean, I'm just here
for the funeral.

376
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,612
Ainsley:
.' You are, you are... .'

377
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,348

Everybody knows
her name, huh?

381
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,156
I'd shrivel up and cry.

382
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,530
Not when we were kids.
You would've knocked out the lead singer

383
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,796
and stole the microphone.

384
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:22,397
Sara, you can be
real proud of your sister.

385
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,429
When my boy Remi
first got sick,

386
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,501
Lily was my..

387
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,274
Thanks, Irene.
Remi's doing real well in class.

388
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,578
My little Picasso.

389
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,915
You two need anything,
you just holler.

390
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,515
Anybody here you don't know?

391
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:44,584
You, for starters.

I don't think Mom and Dad
were ever the same after you left.

395
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:05,506
- I think you broke his heart.
- He broke mine first.

396
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,175
Is that why you took off?

397
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:11,417
Hey, people grow up.
They move on.

398
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,081
- I needed to move on.
- Oh, please.

399
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:17,491
If you start singing "Circle of Life,"
I swear I will slap you.

400
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,462
Answer my question.

401
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,065
Dad was everything good
about this place.

402
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,660
Getting up early
to look for deer

403
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,466
and Sunday barbecues

404
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,996
and even his
frickin' "BFL."

405
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,566
You're the one who started calling
Smithy the "BFL."

406
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,135
Yeah, well, I learned
I can't trust any of that.

407
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,249
- He was cheating on Mom.
- You're full of crap.

408
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,310
- With someone named Betty.
- Sara, stop.

409
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,582
- I found the letters in the attic.
- Dad is gone!

410
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:52,419
You better figure out if you're gonna be
poison around here or a cure.

411
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,929
Find your own way home.

412
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,992
Lils-- wait, Lils!

413
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,668
Lils!

414
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,542
I think I might need
a ride home, Irene.

415
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,408
Honey, I gotta be here
'til 2:00.

416
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,640
I can take her.

417
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,809
Thanks, hon'. But we need somebody
that knows his way around.

418
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,911
I have the perfect solution.

419
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,287
Tyler Humphries?

420
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,519
Hey, Sara.

421
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,622
- You look great.
- You look different.

422
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,259
Yep.
Got contacts.

423
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,570
Tyler, you think Sara
can bum a ride home with you?

424
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:41,075
Yeah, sure.
Anything I can do to help.

425
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,376
Keep the change, Irene.

426
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,006
I was sorry to hear
about your dad.

427
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,711
We used to go fishing
together all the time.

428
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,947
Thanks.

429
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,824

430
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,094
Hear that?

431
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,626
Get the horned owl
this time of year.

432
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,807
Oh.
Well, thanks for the ride.

433
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,841
- Will I see you again?
- Tomorrow.

434
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,309
- At the funeral.
- Oh, yeah.

435
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,843
- Okay, good night.
- Night.

436
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:30,352
Mom?
Why don't you go to bed?

437
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,029
I'm just gonna
sit here for a bit.

438
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,865
Bed's so big
for one person.

439
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,173
Your dad proposed to me
on a Friday.

440
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,335
Gave me
a single pink rose.

441
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,773
He knew I loved roses,
but he couldn't afford a whole dozen.

442
00:27:56,274 --> 00:28:00,950
Every Friday for 34 years,

443
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,491
no matter where he was,

444
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,961
he made sure I got my rose.

445
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,076
Pastor: We are here today
to celebrate a life.

446
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:31,178
To pay our final respects
to our friend,

447
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,680
our husband, our father,
Ray Tisdale.

448
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,716
Ray loved this lake.

449
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,696
Ray and I spoke many times
about his belief

450
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,293
-( woman sobbing )
- that appreciating the majesty of this lake

451
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,395
was, for him,
giving glory to God.

452
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,905
You know,
Ray did not frequently...

453
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,101
Who's that bawling
back there?

454
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,804
I don't know. I feel like
my head's gonna explode.

455
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,247
( Phone ringing )

456
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,511
Figures.
Finally get service.

457
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,452
-( Phone clicks)
- Sorry, Ash.

458
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,988
This is where Ray wanted us,
the people he loved, to gather.

459
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,291
And so we bid Ray farewell,

460
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:17,391
evoking the spirit
of his Saxon forebearers.

461
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,165
(whispering )

462
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:24,230
I've changed my mind.

463
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,072
Uh-- listen.

464
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,601
It's what he wanted,
Vivian, you know.

465
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,275
I know. But given
the circumstances of his death,

466
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,945
I'm sure you'd agree
that this is not appropriate.

467
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,556
Uh, this lake was
a big part of Ray,

468
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,583
and now he's gonna
become part of it.

469
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,961
Pastor: Ray did want us
to celebrate, Viv.

470
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,557
I know.
You're right.

471
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,501
Come on.

472
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,131
You must be
tickled pink, Ray.

473

474
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,924
He's not in there, is he?

475
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,258
No.

Vic: Did you know
something, though?

481
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,610
I wish I would've brought
a flask of 'shine

482
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,272
just to stick
right in this coffee.

483
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,543
( laughing )
Hi, honey, how you doing?

484
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,983
I don't think he'd mind
if we were having a good time.

485
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,284
Mm-hmm.
You want a muffin, Vic?

486
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,187
- Thank you very much, yeah.
- Sure.

487
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,489
- Carl?
- You holding up all right, sweet pea?

488
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,459
- My deepest condolences.
- Thank you.

489
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,796
- Have you seen Sara?
- Yeah, she's...

490
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,392
- Pay my respects?
- ...out on the deck.

491
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,858
Thank you.

492
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,466
That's the only way
to send a guy like your dad out.

493
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,409
Oh, Tyler. Hey.

494
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,412
I didn't see you
at the service.

495
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,675
It was my boat
that put out the fire.

496
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,076
He was a great man.

497
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,985
Taught me a lot
while I was in prison.

498
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,480
I'm out on
work release now.

499
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,322
I'm kidding.

500
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:00,921
- I run marine patrol.
- Oh.

501
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,627
And you seem underwhelmed.

502
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,535
Of course, my gigolo business
does pretty well.

503
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,162
Summer renters, mostly.

504
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:12,436
- Elderly and lonely.
- Oh.

505
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,966
- But horny.
- Stop.

506
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,070
- They're saggy.
- Gross.

507
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,172
- Gassy.
- You are evil.

508
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:23,242
( Sputters )

509
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,185
( man coughs)

510
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,919
Sara? Years back,
when you took off--

511
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,363
Yeah, I gotta take off now.

512
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,290
Out already?

513
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,936
- Anything I can do?
- No, it's been great seeing you,

514
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,999
but my flight takes off
in a few hours.

515
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,378
Sara?

516
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:53,678
Sara!
You can't leave!

517
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,514
I have a huge case.

518
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,178
You can't abandon me
with this.

519
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,678
Come on, Lily.
Give me those keys.

520
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,352
Can't you think about someone
other than yourself for one minute?

521
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,759
Damn it, Lily.
I have to go.

522
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:09,492
Fine, just run away again.
You're mad at Dad, so I lose a sister.

523
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,890
- That's not fair.
- Fair? You're gonna go back

524
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,461
to your L.A. life
and your cush job.

525
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,064
I'm stuck here
taking care of Mom.

526
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,702
Whatever he did, just-

527
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,905
don't take it out on us.

528
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,607
Help me.

529
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,058
Thank God
for the old moonshiners.

530
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,066
Thank you, girls,
for humoring your old mother.

531
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,697
- I just got tired of cleaning up.
- Sara: Yeah, right.

532
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,264
Little Lily, here.
You're drunk enough for all of us.

533
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,866
Hair of the dog, baby.

534
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,242
I got only two days
to get in shape for the festival.

535
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,144
He's gone.

536
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,617
He loved you girls so much.

537
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,780
Freshman year,

538
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,585
I got a message
from dorm security

539
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,319
that I had a whole bunch
of flowers,

540
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:13,124
and I got all excited, like,
"Oh, who are these from?"

541
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:16,564
They were from Dad,
of course.

542
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,261
You didn't thank him.

543
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,292
That hurt.

544
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,895
It's not that simple, it's--

545
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,497
Dad was-

546
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,737
There were things about him
you didn't know.

547
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:32,270
Did you know
this was his dream?

548
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:35,307
He wanted to raise his sons
hunting and fishing

549
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:39,116
and then you two girls
came along.

550
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,430
Think there's
a thunderstorm coming.

551
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:52,868
- Oh, I miss those in L.A.
- ( thunder rumbles)

552
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,497
I think we'd best
go back inside.

553
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,834
Here, I got that.

554
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,210
Vivian: The thing is,
it's a dry heat.

555
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,650
Huh?

556
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,814
Arizona, that's what they say.
It's a dry heat.

557
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,619
And I think it'll go quickly.

558
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,353
- What'll go?
- The house.

559
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,486
You're gonna burn
the house down?

560
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,964
- I mean, this could be a tear-down.
- Huh?

561
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:26,525
- They buy 'em and tear 'em down--
- I know what a tear-down is

562
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,400
but I don't want
our house to be one.

563
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:32,067
Then I need $117,000.

564
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,406
So, if you don't have
that kind of money layin' around,

565
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,208
I think that the condo
is very reasonable.

566
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,714
- What condo?
- What condo?

567
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,909
Rancho Del Monte.

568
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,544
I liked it right off 'cause
I used to use their tomato paste-

569
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,554
not too acidy.

570
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,112
You can't sell this house.

571
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,989
What am I gonna do
rattling around here all by myself?

572
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,994
Hello?
I still live here.

573
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,723
Honey, you just
made it quite clear

574
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,288
that you need
to go off to art school.

575
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,391
Am I the only one
that doesn't get to leave this place?

576
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,459
This is crazy.

577
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,631
And Sara, don't you make me
wait to see you again.

578
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,234
Arizona's right next to California,
last time I checked.

579
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,542
What are we gonna do?
She already got an agent.

580
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,210
( Splashing )

581
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,339
Dad?

582
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,849
I didn't think you'd have
the guts to face me.

583
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,151
Remember when you were little
and you tried to row this boat

584
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,588
all the way across the lake
by yourself?

585
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,250
You had to rescue me.

586
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,124
You were only seven and you already
knew that you could do anything.

587
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,958
'Course, you were too small
to use the oars,

588
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,192
but the wind was blowing.

589
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,633
Before we could figure out
where you'd gone,

590
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,332
you were three,
four hundred yards out.

591
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,103
That scared the living daylights
out of me.

592
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,940
I jumped in the water,
swam out there,

593
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,446
and you were having a grand old time
watching me splash around,

594
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,005
trying to climb into the boat.

595
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,176
It wasn't so grand
when we capsized.

596
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,777
- That's true.
- I thought Smithy'd get us.

597
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,982
You had to put me on your back
and swim me to shore,

598
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,653
and you squeezed me
for like 15 minutes.

599
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,422
- It's good to see you, sunshine.
- Yeah, how am I--

600
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,296
- Seeing me?
- Yeah.

601
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,097
How cool is this?

602
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,270
What the hell happened?

603
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,775
It was an accident.
And trust me,

604
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,300
nobody tries to have
an accident like that.

605
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,971
I even lost my damn hat.

606
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,383
I'm hungry-

607
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,353
- I used to love to eat.
- Mm-hmm.

608
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,116
Always with your mouth
wide open.

609
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,748
You all hated that,
didn't you?

610
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,816
My three sophisticated ladies
of the lake?

611
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,690
Three, huh?

612
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,287
Is that all?

613
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,563
No other special lady
at your funeral?

614
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,433
- You're not gonna let that go, are you?
- What about Mom?

615
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:54,306
All those years
that you lied to her?

616
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,677
Like a rose every Friday
makes up the difference.

617
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,706
Well, sunshine, I can see
you're no romantic.

618
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,548
I want to go home.

619
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,315
Take me back.

620
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,694
The Willards.
They brought you pancakes

621
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,206
with chocolate chips
and peanut butter.

622
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:27,004
Oh, Mom.
I can't eat that.

623
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,635
But it's your favorite.

624
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:32,739
Yeah, when I was like, eight.

625
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,149
(birds chirping)

626
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,522
New painting technique?

627
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:46,016
It helps me organize my mind sol
can be open to the gifts of the universe.

628
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,587
- ( Sighs )
- So what are you painting?

629
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,591
Nice.
Very minimalist.

630
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,625
Ha-ha.

631
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,399
It was for Dad.

632
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,634
He wanted me to capture
this view of the lake.

633
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,642
My first and only
commission.

634
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,610
I kept putting him off
and putting him off

635
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,375
and, well,
there's no hurry now.

636
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,041
Lily, this is who you are.

637
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,381
( Scoffs )
I know who I am.

638
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,116
I'm a small-town art teacher
who paints cities she'll never visit.

639
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,590
I never even made it
to Chicago.

640
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,195
I should've burned my portfolio
when I had the chance.

641
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,198
What?

642
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,827
I got the gas can from the shed
and Dad stopped me.

643
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,497
He said it'd be a shame to waste
the canvases, so he took them down

644
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,098
to the church's
Joyous Junk Sale and--

645
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:35,542
I guess they got what they deserved,
all painted over by amateurs.

646
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:39,207
I thought you liked
being a teacher.

647
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,910
I do, I--
I love the kids,

648
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:46,445
but watching 10-year-olds
draw robots and me,

649
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:51,017
and me as a robot, it's not exactly
how I pictured my life,

650
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,925
you know?

651
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,800
I'm all in my head.

652
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:01,793
I've gotta just get my Kundalini flowing
and open up my heart chakra.

653
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,075
"Under heaven,
all can see beauty

654
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,638
only because
there is ugliness."

655
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,547
If you ever quit teaching,

656
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,350
you could start writing
fortune cookies.

657
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:24,917
"You will soon be leaning over a bar
with several old friends..."

658
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,429
Both:
"In bed."

659
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,695
( phone ringing )

660
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,040
Hello?

661
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,046
- Man on phone: Is this Carl Burger?
- Speaking.

662
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,638
Yeah, you sent me
63 e-mails.

663
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,307
This is Mark Futterman,
with The Exploratory Channel.

664
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,181
M-Mark Futterman?

665
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:52,744
Oh, my God.
Sir, we love you.

666
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,347
Well, we're in scramble mode
because of a cancellation.

667
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:58,690
But I'd like to bring a crew out there
and do an episode on Smithy.

668
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:02,493
For real?
That would be awesome!

669
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,172
Why didn't you tell me, Ray?

670
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,369
We don't have the money
to pay these people.

671
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,272
You promised we were gonna
grow old here together.

672
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,839
And now you just left me
here alone.

673
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,444
Ray:
Darlin', after 34 years together,

674
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,513
does it feel like you're alone?

675
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,761
No.

676
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:37,254
No, maybe that's the problem.

677
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,962
You're everywhere.

678
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,330
Our books, our bed.

679
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:50,777
You even built this shed.

680
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:54,374
You were always my home.
This was the girls' home.

681
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,612
If you're leaving
'cause you think you have to,

682
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,280
well, the girls can help.

683
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,221
The girls.

684
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,591
Lily feels stuck here
taking care of me

685
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,223
and Sara just wants to take
the first plane out of here.

686
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,078
( Door opens )

687
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,842
Mom?

688
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,975
Mom, why are you selling
the house?

689
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:32,579
I don't have a choice.

690
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:38,420
Rapture Real Estate.
Why do I know that name?

691
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,191
Apparently, they have
the deeds to the house.

692
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,926
You have two weeks to pay
or you're gonna have to be evicted?

693
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,264
Mom, this letter
is dated 10 days ago.

694
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,270
Why didn't you come to me
with this earlier?

695
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,272
I didn't know about it.

696
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,969
But I thought that Dad paid off
the mortgage when we were kids.

697
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,911
One day, Ray comes in,
he just says,

698
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,039
"Go for it, darling.

699
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,549
Build the kitchen
of your dreams."

700
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,279
- So he refinanced.
- Yeah,

701
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,309
with Dave Boyers
down at the bank.

702
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:09,290
I never heard word one
about these Rapture people.

703
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,590
If I don't sell the house
and pay these people, I'm--

704
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:15,222
I'm gonna end up
with nothing.

705
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:22,393
Mom, I'm gonna figure this out.

706
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,319
- Hello?
- Jeanne?

707
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,325
Sara, where the heck
are you?

708
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,258
United Textiles' rep
will be here in an hour.

709
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:48,195
Oh, I tried to call you
but I don't have any cell phone service.

710
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:51,665
- I missed my flight.
- Let me see how quickly I can re-book.

711
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,760
I'm actually not coming back
right now.

712
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:56,670
Winchester's on a rampage.
He needs you at the briefing.

713
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,674
Ash can cover for me.

714
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,200
Look, there was a card on my desk
that said "Rapture Real Estate."

715
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:05,270
Give me those details
as soon as you can, okay?

716
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:08,215
- Okay.
- Thank you, Jeanne. You're the best.

717
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:15,386
Oh, Dad.

718
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,566
How am I supposed
to find anything in this?

719
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,812
The She-Doos are still here.

720
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:49,017
I wonder what they wanted out of life
when they were my age.

721
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,729
( Motor starts )

722
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,830
(flock quacking )

723
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,579
How does Rapture fit in?

724
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,261
These guys
are all over the lake.

725
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,599
Sara, here's one more
probate file.

726
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,199
Oh, thank you so much.

727
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,177
- Great blouse. My favorite color.
- Thank you.

728
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,781
Sara?

729
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,374
Oh, Tyler.

730
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:50,351
What are you doing here?
I thought you left town.

731
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:53,685
I'm trying to establish chain of title
for my dad's estate.

732
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,384
You seem stressed.

733
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,290
You wanna grab
some lunch?

734
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,888
- I have a boyfriend.
- Yeah, well, he'll have to buy his own.

735
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,966
Let me drop off my dock permit.
Give me two seconds.

736
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,368
Don't go anywhere.

737
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:25,017
So why in the world
are you doing marine patrol

738
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,715
here at
Smith Mountain Lake?

739
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:29,155
Well, I love issuing
fishing citations.

740
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,921
But the bullhorn.
That was the real sell.

741
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:35,829
- Seriously?
- There's something magic about this lake.

742
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:40,163
Don't want to be
anywhere else.

743
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,727
Now, you said
you'd never leave.

744
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:47,230
And then, just as we were
about to get serious-

745
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:51,144
- You went off to school.
- Well, I wrote. I called.

746
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,513
L-- I needed
a change of pace.

747
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,643
I have a confession to make.

748
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,153
I saw you the other night

749
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,554
trying to throw yourself
off the dock.

750
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:04,184
Trying to get frickin'
cell phone reception.

751
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,889
Well, you gave quite a show
to some locals looking out for the BFL.

752
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,762
Hey, they deserve to see
something, at least.

753
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:14,462
( laughs )
That's the Sara I remember.

754
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,164
Y'all know
what you'd like?

755
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,730
Uh, yeah. I will have
a pulled pork sandwich,

756
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,605
iced tea, and some
onion rings, please.

757
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,110
For you, hon'?

758
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:26,842
Side salad
and water with lemon.

759
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,476
- Bottled.
- All right.

760
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,382
So, how's your mom?
Holding up?

761
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,482
She-.

762
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:40,825
She wants to sell the house
and move to Arizona.

763
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,660
Well, it is a dry heat
out there.

764
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:46,099
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.

765
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:49,900
There ya go.

766
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,838
I'm sorry,
I have to go.

767
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,671
Well, now I know
how you stay so slim.

768
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:56,735
You don't eat a damn thing.

769
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,371
Let me make you
dinner sometime.

770
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:00,404
Tyler...

771
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,418
I'm just here to settle
my father's estate.

772
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,017
Larry.

773
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,529
Nice to meet you, Larry.

774
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:18,397
- Russell, with an L.
- With an L. Duly noted.

775
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,299
Hi, I'm Bob.

776
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,930
- Can I get your autograph?
- Yeah, I'll make sure that happens.

777
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,406
Say, um, Mr. Futterman,
if I may.

778
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,808
Why is it that you sound
so different in real life

779
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,812
than you do on the TV?

780
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,814
For the show,
I like to use the dialect

781
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,544
so that the viewers actually
think it's one of their own

782
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,245
telling them a story.
You understand?

783
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,083
It's Hollywood.

784
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,055
So, look, what I'm gonna do
is flush out some interviews,

785
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,819
mix it with some actors,
some CGI.

786
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:45,486
For example,
if you hit "Enter" on the computer,

787
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,358
you're gonna see footage
of the project we did on "Cressie."

788
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,988
Shot it up in Newfoundland.

789
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,225
As you can see
from the footage,

790
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,255
we got tons of monsters
on green screen.

791
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,666
We can augment that
with shots of your lake.

792
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,033
We can put the creature
anywhere we want.

793
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,731
How do you know
what he looks like?

794
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,262
Doesn't matter
what he looks like.

795
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:01,139
Not gonna get any footage
of the creature. Come on.

796
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,666
( laughs )
That's why we do reenactments.

797
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,236
Come on, fellas.

798
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:08,249
It's not radio. We gotta show them
something visual.

799
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:10,717
Okay.

800
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,551
Say, me and the boys are gonna go
get a drink down the road.

801
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,318
Would you like to join us?

802
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,258
No.
No, I'll skip that.

803
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,090
Yeah.

804
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,730
( Music playing )

805
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,234
Sara: I don't remember
the last time I had this much to drink.

806
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,898
I love Jack Daniels.

807
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,771
It always feels a little zesty.

808
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,506
Guess what?
I had a lunch today with Tyler

809
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,538
- You bad girl. How did that go?
- No, no, no, no.

810
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,481
- I found Betty.
- What?

811
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:43,951
- She's a waitress in town.
- No.

812
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:46,284
Oh, yeah. How are you so sure
she really exists?

813
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:47,788
'Cause I have the letters.
I can show them--

814
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,586
I don't believe it.

815
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:53,823
This lake, this life,
it's not an illusion-- or delusion.

816
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:57,730
Listen to you. You talk about
how this place entraps you.

817
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,859
Why don't you come
out to L.A. with me?

818
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,767
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
I'll leave Mom now.

819
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,396
- That's nice.
- Oh, man.

820
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,374
How long are you gonna
use Mom as an excuse?

821
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:10,469
"Okay, class. Let's get our
Kundalinis flowing in our chakras,

822
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,777
and I don't have to risk
taking a real critic."

823
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,750
- Take that back.
- Oh! Hey!

824
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:18,480
Oh, Carl,
I'm so sorry.

825
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:21,546
That's okay. Beer has spilled
on this shirt before.

826
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,115
And will again.
Like that, maybe.

827
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,991
( laughter )

828
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,463
Gee, thanks, Vic.
This was yours.

829
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:33,730
Hey, Carl. Heard you guys
meta big movie star today.

830
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,603
We sure did. Mr. Mark Futterman,
from Exploratory.

831
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,301
- He's doing an exposé on Smithy.
- For real?

832
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,708
Guys:
For real.

833
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,939
Say, listen. You mind
if I bring him around?

834
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:46,242
Vic:
Yeah, you know, like,

835
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,249
show him where
the legend began.

836
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,979
Sure, my dad
would be so proud.

837
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:54,614
- Cheers, guys.
- All: Cheers.

838
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:55,952
Bye!

839
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:59,756
That was so nice of them
to give us a ride.

840
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,925
- I know! So nice.
- Oh, God.

841
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,697
- They're always there.
- I forgot about the stairs.

842
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,204
Lily: This is why
I never go to the gym.

843
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:15,876
So, uh, it must
be pretty weird

844
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,505
coming here after your
glamorous city living, huh?

845
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,744
Does he take you
to parties all the time?

846
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:25,082
- He who?
- He who? Lawyer boy.

847
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:28,954
- Is he the one?
- The one? I don't know.

848
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:33,758
Ash is-- he should be,
but, you know,

849
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,161
he's such a lawyer.

850
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,860
Why are you with him, then?

851
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:42,200
Uh-oh.

852
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:45,536
Ash is smart and funny and--

853
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:49,704
Ooh, wow. I got it.

854
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,884
Oh, stars.

855
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,889
You never see those in L.A.

856
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:05,382
I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

857
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:08,988
I didn't mean it.

858
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,590
Hell, it's true.

859
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:16,702
I'm a medium fish
in a small, small pond.

860
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,707
Well, a lake, really.

861
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,335
I'm safe, you know.

862
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,311
Safe and boring.

863
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,713
Oh, one thing
you will never be is boring.

864
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,514
Both:
"In bed."

865
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,595
Sara: Thank you for seeing me
so early, Mr. Boyers.

866
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,263
As you know, my father
refinanced with this bank,

867
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,033
but the chain of title says that Rapture
holds the papers to the house.

868
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,531
Your father came to see me
three years ago.

869
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:58,034
He wanted to use some equity
to pay for some upgrades.

870
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,672
A gift to Vivian.

871
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,307
So he re-mortgaged.

872
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,511
This area got hit very hard
by the recession.

873
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,749
Everybody was overleveraged.
A lot of people were missing payments.

874
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:10,383
Rapture, well...

875
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,451
Rapture claimed they would
treat this community like family.

876
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,519
So we sold
a group of loans

877
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,533
at an acceptable loss.

878
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,159
As mortgage-backed
securities.

879
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,431
And now they're calling
these loans.

880
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,461
As they have
the right to do so.

881
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,269
My mother doesn't have
that kind of money.

882
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,799
- They're forcing her into short sale.
- Sara, I'm sorry.

883
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,641
I can't make them
live up to their word.

884
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,914
If there's anything
I can do.

885
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,417
I'd gladly repair this
if I could.

886
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:48,953
Thank you.

887
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:51,898
Whoa, good morning.

888
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,527
I got the idea
to tell some folks

889
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,537
that you were looking
into Rapture Real Estate.

890
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,470
Mrs. Tinnell:
Hey, Sara.

891
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:02,033
I was just telling your mom that for us,
it started when Dale's foot injury

892
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,841
forced him to leave
the state police.

893
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,508
The bills were just piling up.

894
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,608
Mr. Boyers
couldn't help us any--

895
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,619
too risky.

896
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,781
And then Rapture just swooped in
and offered us a way out.

897
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,757
Irene:
Same thing with the bar.

898
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,125
I couldn't work 'cause I was with Remi
in the hospital, you know?

899
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,357
I had to take out
a second mortgage

900
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:23,989
to help pay
for the radiation therapy.

901
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,899
These people came to us
like they was guardian angels.

902
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:30,530
- Rapture ain't no angel.
- More like "Raptor Real Estate."

903
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:33,405
How'd you find these guys?

904
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,309
They put flyers
on the hospital bulletin board.

905
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,711
It didn't strike me at the time
how sick that is.

906
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,375
Fella came by
the electronics shop.

907
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:44,078
If something doesn't change soon,
I'm gonna have to sell--

908
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:46,087
just like you, Viv.

909
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,989
That's a lot of complaints
in one year.

910
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,864
( Phone ringing )

911
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:09,542
- Thanks for calling me back.
- Woman: Sure thing, Sara.

912
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,568
But I gotta tell you. We've looked
into Rapture before, hon'.

913
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,603
We never had enough
to build a case.

914
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:16,014
Sara: They're clearly
trying to manipulate the market.

915
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,747
Good luck to you, honey.
That's gonna be tough to prove.

916
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,187
Sara: At least let me bring you
what I've found.

917
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,055
All right. I can give you
10 minutes tomorrow at 5:00.

918
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,151
I'll be there.

919
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,391
( Phone ringing )

920
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,365
Hey, baby.

921
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,339
How's it going up there
on the mountain?

922
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,035
Been kidnapped
by the McCoy clan yet?

923
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,773
- Don't say that.
- You're always knocking those hillbillies.

924
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,781
They're my family.

925
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:50,182
People around here, they wave to you
when you drive by them.

926
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,584
They'll do anything
that you ask them to do,

927
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,351
- and you really should see it.
- Next time, baby.

928
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,221
We're totally swamped
on this merger.

929
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,851
When you get back,
we'll do it up.

930
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,556
Yamashiro.
That halibut carpaccio you love?

931
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,564
That's the one you love.

932
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:07,830
Then we'll go to a place
you like, okay?

933
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:10,269
Just hurry up
and get back here.

934
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,500
I have to deal with
Rapture Real Estate first.

935
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,338
Finally.

936
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:18,107
I didn't want you to mix
business with personal, but--

937
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,478
Yeah, they have so-called
clients all over the lake.

938
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:23,143
They buy failing loans off the bank,
jack up the interest,

939
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,210
and then force people
into short sales.

940
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,517
I'm convinced that I can
press criminal charges.

941
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,785
I'm going to meet
with the D.A. and--

942
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,760
- Ash, are you there?
- Uh, Sara, I-I'm here-

943
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,887
What do you mean
"criminal charges"?

944
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,694
- Are you there?
- Sara?

945
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,291
- Damn.
-( phone beeps )

946
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,302
(saw whines)

947
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,175
Folks, I am here in the town

948
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,339
of Smith Mountain Lake,
Virginia.

949
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:55,872
Now, Carl, you say there's
an entire town under this lake.

950
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,885
A bunch of houses, anyway,
Mark Futterman.

951
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,853
Cemeteries, too.

952
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,823
Some folks didn't believe the water level
would get as high as it was marked.

953
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:05,349
Ended up having to leave
everything behind.

954
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:08,328
Carl Burger heads up
a local group,

955
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,422
the Smithy Research Society,

956
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:13,457
in search of a giant
plesiosaur known as "Smithy."

957
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,595
Now Carl, what can you tell me
about the beast?

958
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,696
Okay, first of all,
calm down, relax.

959
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,729
We're gonna cut it there,
we'll make this work.

960
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:21,799
When I ask you this question,
just relax, okay?

961
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,003
- Okay.
- Your note would be,

962
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,909
"More good, less suck."
Don't be nervous,

963
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,607
don't stare at the camera,
don't stare at me.

964
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:28,411
And stop saying my last name.
It makes you sound ridiculous.

965
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,781
- Yes, sir.
- All right? You good?

966
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,252
Ahem.

967
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,154
So, Carl, what can you tell me
about the beast?

968
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,021
Well, Mark Futterman,

969
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:40,118
"Smithy" was the name
that the old fisherman gave him.

970
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,595
It was our friend, Ray.
He named him Smithy.

971
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:46,328
We believe he may be hundreds
of years old and weigh over two tons.

972
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,063
Sounds like my mother-in-law.

973
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,695
You can cut that part out,
obviously.

974
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,267
-( Ceiling creaking)
- Lily?

975
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,576
UP here!

976
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,179
Nice job tearing down
that sign-

977
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,121
what's going on?

978
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,590
He...

979
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:13,150
told me he took these
to the junk sale.

980
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,894
Oh...

981
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:25,202
I can't believe
you were gonna burn these.

982
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,071
Crazy.

983
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,775
Oh, Lils.

984
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:35,044
This is great.

985
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,381
Keep it.

986
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:41,048
What were you saying about being
"open to the gifts of the universe"?

987
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:45,423
- Hello?
- Yeah. Well, fine.

988
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:48,088
Let's go figure out
how to save the house.

989
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:50,324
You coming?

990
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:53,027
- In a sec.
- Okay.

991
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:32,562
Why'd you tell me
that story before?

992
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:36,008
Well, maybe it was to remind you
of a girl who wasn't afraid of anything.

993
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,512
- I went to L.A. by myself.
- Exactly.

994
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:40,309
By yourself.

995
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,043
Now you're tethered
to some man

996
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,573
who'll do anything he can
to keep you away

997
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,847
from all the people
that you really care about.

998
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,446
- That's just speculation.
- Well, excuse me, Your Honor.

999
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,459
Everybody's got their secrets.
You should know that.

1000
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,859
- What do you mean by that?
- Betty?

1001
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:57,194
She is one big step down
from Mom.

1002
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,325
What'd she offer
you anyway, Dad?

1003
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,335
Two-for-one specials?

1004
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,898
- I have the letters.
- You were a teenager, Sara.

1005
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:08,875
If it wasn't the letters, it'd have been
something else that made you upset.

1006
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,878
Take me back.

1007
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,141
Now.

1008
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,048
- You're way off base.
- I know that you wrote those letters.

1009
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:18,245
Yes, I did.
I wrote those letters.

1010
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,015
Every one of them.

1011
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,717
When you think you've got
everything figured out,

1012
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:25,749
you might wanna just
look a little deeper.

1013
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,762
( Echoing )
Look a little deeper.

1014
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:29,661
(groans)

1015
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,326
One night.

1016
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,835
Can't I just get
one night's sleep?

1017
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,561
Vivian:
Hello.

1018
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,997
- Y'all here to see the house?
- Oh.

1019
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,625
Are you selling?

1020
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:09,262
- Moving to Arizona.
- Oh, dear.

1021
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:13,068
Well, it is a dry heat.

1022
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:17,105
I'm so sorry to hear
about your husband.

1023
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:19,738
I'm Dottie Price.

1024
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:22,375
I own the gift shop
at Bridge-water Marina.

1025
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,476
I think you know
Dee-Dee Bondurant.

1026
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,283
I hope
you won't move.

1027
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:31,019
- Ladies wanna come up?
- Both: Sure.

1028
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:36,063
It's kinda old,
but this is what it is.

1029
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,928
Boo!

1030
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:41,401
You don't want this house!
This house is haunted.

1031
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,962
Lily Tisdale!
I'm so sorry about that.

1032
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,600
- We didn't actually come to see the house.
- Pffft.

1033
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,201
No, we all wanted
to invite you

1034
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,871
to join the She-Doos.

1035
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,643
Oh, I'm not much
for jet skis.

1036
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,809
We do a lot more than that
all around the lake.

1037
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:59,786
For instance, one thing we're doing
is helping with the wine festival.

1038
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,482
I don't know, I'm--

1039
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:02,956
Dottie:
A lot of us are widows.

1040
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,960
I lost Herbie six months
after we moved in.

1041
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:09,657
Reaching out is so much better
than tucking in.

1042
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,665
We'd love, if you could
spare the time,

1043
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:13,826
to help us set up the art displays
at the festival.

1044
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,229
That's good, that's good.
Thank you.

1045
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,573
So, Mr. McCarren...

1046
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,305
what is your take
on whether or not

1047
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,971
the serpent
actually exists?

1048
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,881
Well, as chairman
of the Wine Festival Committee,

1049
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:32,751
- I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
- Sure.

1050
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:35,551
But I really don't know
what you want me to say--

1051
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,489
That's good, Ainsley.

1052
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:41,188
My official position
is that Smithy exists.

1053
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:44,221
My private position
is that he does not.

1054
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:45,891
However,
my public position is

1055
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:48,698
that folks here love
this sea serpent,

1056
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:50,431
therefore so do I.
( chuckles )

1057
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:53,531
So, when do we roll?

1058
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,600
Oh, we've been rolling.

1059
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,737
-( Crew laughing)
- What? But I-- well, you can't--

1060
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:01,806
I swear, if you idiots do anything
to mess up my wine festival,

1061
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,442
I'll-- we're done here.

1062
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,863
You've got to be
kidding me.

1063
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,389
Go. You said "Full"
when I left.

1064
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,504
Shocker.

1065
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,735
Oh, man.
Where is your flare, Dad?

1066
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,305
Help!

1067
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:34,337
Anyone?

1068
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,445
Ash:
I took the red-eye to Virginia.

1069
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:45,982
Winchester: You, too?
What is it with this place?

1070
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:49,019
Ash: I have to head off
potential litigation.

1071
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,214
- People here are completely nuts.
- 24 hours.

1072
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,225
Ash, the ink isn't dry
on your contract.

1073
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,853
So if one of you isn't back
in 24 hours,

1074
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:23,227
- you're both terminated.
- I understand, sir,

1075
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,493
but my GPS
isn't working at all.

1076
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:29,333
- Hmm. Okay.
- Was that a llama?

1077
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:32,567
Hello? Hello?

1078
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:38,207
Okay, let's keep the chatter down.
Please and thank you.

1079
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:40,180
Let's do this.
Ready?

1080
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:42,148
- Okay.
- I think we're all set here.

1081
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:46,244
Carl, I think we got enough of you
and the Smithy boys.

1082
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,721
- Yeah.
- Okay. Want me to hold the boom, or--

1083
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:51,725
I think we--
I think we got it from here.

1084
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,852
Appreciate the stuff, though.
Great stuff, really.

1085
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,386
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Good stuff.

1086
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:59,229
- Sorry.
- Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.

1087
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,758
I am sitting here with none other
than Lily Tisdale.

1088
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,566
Now, she is the daughter
of Ray Tisdale,

1089
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,663
the original Smithy spotter.

1090
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,574
- Have you ever seen the monster?
- Hmm.

1091
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:12,272
Well, there was this one night
where my dad was fishing late

1092
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,713
and my mom started
getting scared,

1093
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,808
and when he finally
drug himself in,

1094
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:20,184
he was soaking wet, and he said
this huge lizard had capsized the boat.

1095
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,688
- Smithy?
- Yeah.

1096
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,920
He said it was all like--
(growls)

1097
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:29,657
- Was it now?
- Mm-hmm.

1098
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:32,029
Now, you tell me this.
What do you think that was?

1099
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:35,035
Oh, that he was drunk
and he flipped the boat himself.

1100
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:37,560
( laughs)

1101
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:41,063
- Cut it, cut it. Tell me you got that.
- I got it.

1102
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:44,601
Lily, that was beautiful. That's gonna be
very very wonderful on television.

1103
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:46,306
- All right.
- You're a natural.

1104
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:49,282
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I am going to give you my card.

1105
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:52,616
And if you can think of anything else,
you don't hesitate to give me a holler.

1106
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:55,315
As a matter of fact,
Steve's gonna be spending some time.

1107
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:58,723
He's got to transfer tapes
and the-- and technical nonsense.

1108
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:01,922
But, I've really got
to get back to the motel.

1109
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:04,795
- You think you can give me a ride?
- Sure.

1110
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,800
Producer, huh?

1111
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:10,634
- Might bring a chaperone.
- Futterman: No need.

1112
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,764
You were great-

1113
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:16,470
- Will you hand that to Steve?
- Yeah.

1114
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,809
Lily: Mom, can you make sure
the neighbor kids get home?

1115
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,447
Sara?

1116
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,954
Sara? Sara?

1117
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:32,258
- Boat trouble?
- Tyler, thank God.

1118
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:34,158
I can't get her started.

1119
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,459
Do you have gas?

1120
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:40,991
- Oh, I forgot you like them gassy.
- Ha-ha.

1121
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:44,266
- Dispatch, we've got a newbie here.
- Newbie?

1122
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,102
- The gauge was broken.
- "Mysterious Disabled Boat Syndrome."

1123
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:48,199
- We're gonna tow her in.
- Dispatch: Roger.

1124
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,938
- I've got to get to the D.A.'s office.
- You're not gonna make it.

1125
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:53,674
Besides, I just saved your life.
You owe me dinner.

1126
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:56,376
- Oh, come on.
- You know what could've happened here

1127
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,942
if I hadn't come along?
Bad sunburn,

1128
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:03,514
giant radioactive catfish,
the BFL.

1129
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,423
- Let's go.
- Okay, you win, you win.

1130
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:07,928
Watch your head.

1131
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,262
Hey. Can you tell me how to get
to Scruggs Road?

1132
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:22,139
Ooh, you know it'd be easier
to take ya than to tell ya.

1133
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:24,804
It'd be quicker on the water.
You got a boat?

1134
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:27,246
- Do I look like I have a boat?
- No, son.

1135
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,216
You look like you have
an attitude problem.

1136
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,614
Hicks.

1137
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,594
Futterman:
I am glad I asked you for a ride.

1138
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,499
I would've been lost
with this.

1139
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:52,063
Okay, front seat's all yours.

1140
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:54,233
- Good girl.
- I like the paint.

1141
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:57,005
Yeah, I did it myself.

1142
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:59,034
Thanks for letting me be
a part of this show.

1143
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,105
My mom will get
a real kick out of it.

1144
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,879
No, that's my pleasure.

1145
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:07,183
You seem destined
for far greater things.

1146
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,689
- Thanks.
- I'll tell ya.

1147
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,953
Would you like to go to my room
and have a drink?

1148
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,585
Would you like that?

1149
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:17,063
I would, but I'm working
on something and I really got-

1150
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,498
- Focus. You're focused, aren't ya?
- Mm-hmm.

1151
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,502
I could tell
the first time I saw you.

1152
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,561
Well, I'll tell you what.

1153
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,333
Tomorrow,
before the stakeout,

1154
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,534
you give me the inside story
on the Smithy nuts,

1155
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:30,237
and you and I,
AKA the two of us,

1156
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,836
will go
and have dinner.

1157
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:34,438
- What do you say to that?
- I will--

1158
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,112
I'm gonna take that
as a yes.

1159
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,749
I'm gonna take that as a yes,
served on a bed of yes,

1160
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:45,190
rinsed down
with a cup of yes.

1161
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,057
I'll see you tomorrow!

1162
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:49,289
Good night!

1163
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,900
You are a terrible chaperone.
Terrible.

1164
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,067
Sara:
Smells good.

1165
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:01,233
Chilean sea bass.
fingerling potatoes...

1166
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:08,012
and some Keswick
"vee-on-yay."

1167
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,074
It's local.

1168
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:13,018
I always thought when they said "local"
they meant "moonshine."

1169
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,022
There's about 20 wineries
in the region.

1170
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,024
Sara:
Hmm.

1171
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,890
- What is all this?
- Uh, artifacts.

1172
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:21,826
I find 'em while I dive.

1173
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,523
It's for another book
I'm writing.

1174
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:26,590
Another?

1175
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:29,398
Well, technically, I'm on sabbatical
from my day job.

1176
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,996
I'm a professor
at Virginia Tech.

1177
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:35,304
My first book's right there.

1178
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,278
- "Knots"?
- The other one.

1179
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,211
Oh.

1180
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,409
"Lake Effects...

1181
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:45,044
Infinite Ripples,

1182
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,850
by Dr. Tyler Humphries."

1183
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,914
My doctoral thesis.
Pretentious as hell, yes.

1184
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:55,392
But everybody
calls me Tyler.

1185
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,418
(clicks)

1186
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:59,194
Oh, I found this.

1187
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,259
Thought you'd like it.

1188
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,234
- That's my favorite color.
- Yeah, I remember.

1189
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,111
You know what? Save it.
I really have to--

1190
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,174
Oh, come on.
One more drink.

1191
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,345
- I'll tell you about the ruins.
- On the lake?

1192
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,945
Oh, it's dangerous.

1193
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:24,423
There's a lot of places a diver
can get snagged, you know?

1194
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:28,360
Barbed wire fences
and tree branches.

1195
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:31,331
And visibility's
just piss-poor.

1196
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,731
Just when you thought
you'd seen it all,

1197
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:35,827
you gotta look
a little deeper.

1198
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,396
I mean, it's amazing
down there.

1199
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:42,875
There's houses
with cans of food

1200
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:44,673
lying in the pantries.

1201
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,271
So we can have
clean energy.

1202
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,077
And all this.

1203
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,882
And that's why
you came back.

1204
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:59,484
I'm just trying to honor the people
who lived here, you know?

1205
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,728
- What are you doing?
- Beautiful night for a swim.

1206
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:09,429
No, it's not.
It's freezing.

1207
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:12,837
- Coming?
- No.

1208
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,501
Oh, I forgot.

1209
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,636
You're not from here
anymore, are ya?

1210
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,173
- Newbie.
- Hey.

1211
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:27,744
- Oh, it's on.
-( water splashing )

1212
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,453
Whoo-hoo!

1213
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:39,722
( Coyote howls )

1214
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:44,534
( owl hoots )

1215
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,874
<i>Hey.
Tyler?</i>

1216
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,344
Oh...!

1217
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:58,709
I have a boyfriend.

1218
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,887
I heard that somewhere.

1219
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,440
( Rooster crows )

1220
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:42,087
Hello?

1221
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,432
Anybody?

1222
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:49,061
Come on. There's gotta be somebody
on one of these boats.

1223
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,901
- Morning.
- Oh, hey.

1224
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,464
Thank God.
Someone who's awake.

1225
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:57,477
My GPS is dead.

1226
01:13:57,499 --> 01:14:01,174
Is this Smith
Mountain Paradise?

1227
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:02,807
That's on the other side
of the lake.

1228
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,114
- What are you doing over here?
- Don't ask, dude.

1229
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:09,020
I spent the night waiting for the boys
from "Deliverance" to show up.

1230
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:12,651
- Can you tell me how to get there?
- Sure.

1231
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,093
But you'd make better time
on the water. You got a boat?

1232
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,495
Do I look like--

1233
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,665
No.
No, I don't.

1234
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,396
All right,
what you want to do,

1235
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:25,837
you're gonna go
about 10--

1236
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:27,841
You know what?
Why don't you come inside?

1237
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,900
Got some coffee and a map.
We'll get you squared away.

1238
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,605
Thanks.

1239
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:46,817
All right, we are here.

1240
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:49,762
- And you needed to be here.
- Oh.

1241
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,892
- Hey, you mind if I--
- Go ahead.

1242
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:11,640
Uh, Tyler?
What is my bra doing-

1243
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,983
Sara?

1244
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,852
Oh, my God.

1245
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,084
What the hell
are you doing here?

1246
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:18,785
Me? What are you
doing here?

1247
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:22,387
- You backwoods son of a bitch!
- Ash! Stop it!

1248
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:25,227
My boat got towed
and I couldn't get home last night.

1249
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:28,133
What are you doing?
Ash, look-- Ash!

1250
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:33,431
Predator, prey!

1251
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:37,000
Wait a minute.

1252
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,706
If you're not the predator,
you're the prey.

1253
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:42,810
Rapture Real Estate?
Who sent this?

1254
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,316
Rapture's bringing in
huge revenues.

1255
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:51,053
You represent
Raptor Real Estate.

1256
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,922
That's why you came here.

1257
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:55,827
Rapture.
I did it for you.

1258
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,956
So that you'd have clients
in your hometown.

1259
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,660
I had no idea they owned
your parents' loan.

1260
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:03,465
Now grab your stuff
and get in the car.

1261
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:07,133
I'll even forgive you for being
with "goober boy" over here.

1262
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:10,939
You'll forgive me?
Go home, Ash.

1263
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:13,947
You owe me.
I'm not going home without you.

1264
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,783
Ah!

1265
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,843
You've ruined my mom.

1266
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:23,455
How soulless
can you be, Ash?

1267
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,617
Hunt for those...

1268
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:27,649
"predator."

1269
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,997
What if Futterman
doesn't find anything?

1270
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,728
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean, what if he sets up

1271
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:37,430
with all his cameras and lights
and Smithy doesn't show?

1272
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,735
You heard him.
That's when they bring out all the...

1273
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,468
- CSI.
- Vic: Larry's right.

1274
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:43,305
You know what they do
on his show.

1275
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:46,370
He's gonna make us
look like idiots.

1276
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:49,007
Nobody can make us
look like idiots.

1277
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,778
Only we can do that.

1278
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,877
We gotta make sure
he sees something.

1279
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:55,752
Yeah. How?

1280
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,561
Guys,
I think I've got a plan.

1281
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:06,222
Whew...

1282
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:08,200
I coulda taken him,
you know.

1283
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:12,694
Come on, "slugger."
Let me buy you breakfast.

1284
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,639
I can't.

1285
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,143
You gotta eat sometime.

1286
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:20,237
I can't do this.

1287
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:23,545
Hey. hey-

1288
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,950
Before you run out again,

1289
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,976
without telling me why,
at least-

1290
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,513
at least let me put all my cards
on the table.

1291
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,192
I love you, Sara.

1292
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:38,255
I've always loved you.

1293
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:42,664
Now, if you could see
what's in my heart-

1294
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,237
It's not you, I'm sorry.

1295
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:50,072
Sara!

1296
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,580
Carl is gonna be
so surprised.

1297
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:59,017
You know what? You'd better hurry up
and get that thing to the dock.

1298
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,544
Let's go.

1299
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:04,113
Futterman, you want Smithy,
you got Smithy.

1300
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,489
Careful, careful.

1301
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:12,355
-( Dog whining)
- Louie, what is it?

1302
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:14,663
What is it?

1303
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,863
( Barking )

1304
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,609
( sobs )

1305
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:49,827
Irene down at the bar told me
your Ashland and you had a fight.

1306
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:53,305
- You all right?
- All right?

1307
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:55,934
I just cut my own throat.

1308
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:59,468
To fight Rapture,
I'd have to fight my own firm.

1309
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,811
I was in line
for a partnership.

1310
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:05,307
Now I'll never be able
to face Winchester again.

1311
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:13,389
You know how proud I am
of all you've accomplished?

1312
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:22,364
- I know you didn't want to end up like me.
- No, Mom.

1313
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,804
That's not why I left.

1314
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:28,705
Sara, why don't you
just tell me

1315
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,835
what it is
you've got to say?

1316
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,846
I have-

1317
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:36,145
You think you gotta tread lightly
'cause I allowed myself

1318
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:39,015
to fall into
the depths of grief.

1319
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,782
I loved your father
with my whole heart.

1320
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:46,722
But I'm not that fragile.

1321
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:50,424
Now, I chose this life.

1322
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:55,529
I chose family
and community

1323
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,468
and simplicity and nature

1324
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,494
over wealth and power

1325
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:01,940
and position and fame.

1326
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:03,943
Now, I respect your choices.

1327
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,411
I know folks in your neck of the woods
don't respect mine.

1328
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:12,251
But I expect you
to know better.

1329
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:15,551
I taught you to be
a straight shooter-

1330
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,523
rifle or man.

1331
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:20,851
You just take a deep breath,

1332
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:22,555
relax...

1333
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:26,724
and squeeze
that trigger slowly.

1334
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:30,168
That's how you handle
Mr. Winchester.

1335
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:34,530
I am not accustomed
to negotiating

1336
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:36,543
with my own employees,

1337
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,409
but I'm sure we can come
to terms, Ms. Tisdale.

1338
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:41,539
Persuade me,
Mr. Winchester.

1339
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,483
I will stipulate that
Rapture should have been

1340
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,350
more rigorously vetted
before Ash signed them.

1341
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:50,447
So, how can our client
avoid criminal proceedings?

1342
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:53,721
Rapture returns ownership
of the house to Vivian Tisdale.

1343
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:56,592
- Done.
- And pay six months of her mortgage

1344
01:20:56,618 --> 01:21:00,225
to the bank for time and suffering.
- Done.

1345
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:04,067
The same goes for Tinnell's Market,
Jim Powell's boat,

1346
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:08,006
and 14 other owners.
I'll forward a list.

1347
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:11,306
Agreed.
Anything else?

1348
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:14,075
Your client is through
with Smith Mountain Lake,

1349
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:17,049
in fact, in the entire
Commonwealth of Virginia.

1350
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:20,178
In exchange, you will not
pursue any criminal action

1351
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,746
against Rapture for any infractions
or tortious activity,

1352
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:25,883
nor will you involve
any third party.

1353
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:29,657
- Mm-hmm.
- Deal.

1354
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:32,528
You're a good lawyer,
Sara.

1355
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,465
Your values
are your strength.

1356
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:37,333
- Now get the hell back here.
- What about Ash?

1357
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,896
That person
no longer works at this firm.

1358
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,333
We did it.

1359
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,283
It's finished.

1360
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:56,778
( gasps )
Dad would have loved that, Lils.

1361
01:21:58,446 --> 01:21:58,712
Chairman McCarren:
My fellow citizens.

1362
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:00,920
Chairman McCarren:
My fellow citizens.

1363
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:05,261
We have dozens of Virginia's
finest vintages on tap--

1364
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:07,563
well, not on tap, of course.
That's beer.

1365
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,535
I mean, uh, decanted.

1366
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:12,060
No, no, you can't decant.
That would've been done by then.

1367
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:17,441
- Breathing!
- Vic: These are fertile Smithy waters here.

Side salad,
water with lemon.

1373
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:40,365
Hell, if I had your body,
I'd eat like a rodent, too.

1374
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,995
So, how did you know
my father?

1375
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:46,903
Ray was a good friend

1376
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:49,204
when not too many
other people were around.

1377
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:52,234
How-- how good a friend?

1378
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:58,541
I didn't have the most
wholesome reputation,

1379
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,952
but it didn't mean
I deserved a man like Waylon.

1380
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,116
Ray got me out of there.

1381
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,352
He gave me money
for a room.

1382
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:08,725
He even took me
to see the doctors.

1383
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:12,163
I never knew that about him.

1384
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:14,929
You were too young
to know about such things.

1385
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:17,664
I will always be grateful
to your daddy.

1386
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:20,502
Did he ever call you
by any kind of nickname?

1387
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:22,940
No.

1388
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:25,501
Some folks here call me Liza,
but I hate it.

1389
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,513
I prefer Elizabeth.

1390
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:29,515
- Elizabeth.
- Mm-hmm.

1391
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:33,246
- Then who is Betty?
- Betty? Hmm.

1392
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:35,254
Hey, come on down
to the lake.

1393
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:37,187
The Exploratory guy's
doing a project for TV.

1394
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:38,850
Come on.

1395
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,156
Carl: We often pick up
some motion right around here.

1396
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,662
'Course, we don't have
the fancy equipment that y'all have.

1397
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,528
- Yeah, 'course you don't.
- No.

1398
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:47,555
Hey, Carl.

1399
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:50,763
Me gusta, baby.
Me gusta.

1400
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,465
- Cameraman: Ready?
- Futterman: Okay.

1401
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:54,235
All right,
you know what?

1402
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:55,866
Let's get a countdown from five.
Get it rolling.

1403
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:59,470
In five, four,
three, two--

1404
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:03,313
I am standing here with Carl,
on the shore of Smith Mountain Lake--

1405
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:07,013
The package is in play.
Repeat.

1406
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,919
- Cut it, cut it.
- The package is in play.

1407
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:10,945
- What is-- you hear that?
- The package is in play.

1408
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,084
Excuse me!

1409
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:14,923
Yes, thank you!
We're rolling sound here!

1410
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:18,726
Hey, come on, everybody.
Just pipe down.

1411
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,994
- Hit it again.
- I'm sorry about that.

1412
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:22,797
- It's fine, it's okay.
- Sorry.

1413
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:25,202
Here we go.
And we're rolling.

1414
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:29,003
I am here with Carl on the shore
of Smith Mountain Lake,

1415
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:33,035
to get a look at a sea monster
they think lives beneath the water.

1416
01:24:35,103 --> 01:24:37,845
( "Ride of the Valkyries" playing )

1417
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:39,783
Futterman
is gonna love this.

1418
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,414
Sara: Where's that music
coming from?

1419
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:45,550
Ladies and gentlemen,
keep your eyes on the horizon.

1420
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:49,289
This is the first modern
documented sighting

1421
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:51,593
of a lake monster.

1422
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:54,395
( Music continues)

1423
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,663
Bring it back around.
Let's get the heck out of here.

1424
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:58,671
- I can't.
- What do you mean you can't?

1425
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:01,139
- You wired it, Boy Scout.
- It's not turning-

1426
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:03,870
- like there's something pushing us!
- Why'd you wire it wrong?

1427
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:06,276
Hello, I would like
to introduce you--

1428
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:08,281
( snapping )
I-- excuse me!

1429
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:11,773
- Could I have your attention, please?
- What?

1430
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:14,548
We have Miss Virginia here,
for goodness' sake!

1431
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:17,489
- Pay no attention to those idiots!
- What is that?

1432
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:19,014
- I don't know.
- Is that a joke?

1433
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:20,151
- No, sir.
- Is that a joke?

1434
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:22,787
Is that our Smithy?

1435
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:24,888
- I am so sorry.
- ( feedback squeals)

1436
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,492
(flame roars,
music continues)

1437
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,036
I think that's some of my--

1438
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,368
Are you trying to make a mockery
of Mark Futterman?

1439
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:36,773
- Is that what you're doing?
- I would never think of doing that.

1440
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:39,870
Russell: It's not stopping!
We're gonna hit the rocks!

1441
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,147
You laughing at me?

1442
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,083
No, wait, Mr. Futterman, please.
Smithy is real.

1443
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:54,684
If you just let me explain-

1444
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:59,790
Please do not go--
Crap. Crap!

1445
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,698
( Music stops )

1446
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,294
Carl?

1447
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,306
You shoulda asked me.
You know, I do a really mean Smithy.

1448
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:11,936
( Growls )

1449
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,912
You think I knew
about this?

1450
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:16,677
Come on, it's made
out of scrap metal.

1451
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:19,310
Carl: They must've done it
out of love.

1452
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,479
You're telling me you had
nothing to do with that?

1453
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:24,115
No.

1454
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:26,989
Still, though, I'm not gonna
throw away an entire friendship

1455
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:30,428
just for one stupid,
stupid mistake.

1456
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:32,431
Carl:
I know what's in their hearts.

1457
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:35,400
The least I owe them
is to let them explain it.

1458
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:37,926
- Rascals.

Well, sorry for what happened,
not sorry to hear about it.

1463
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,879
Of course I heard about it.
Your father's well connected in this town.

1464
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:59,983
Oh, yes. Look, I think Miss Virginia

Free tour,

- Boyfriend?
- No, I don't have a boyfriend.

1476
01:27:42,056 --> 01:27:45,594
That's great, 'cause my grandson's 26

Do you know who did this?

1482
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:10,391
That's mine.
I did that painting.

1483
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:12,193
It's astonishing.

1484
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,860
How much

1485
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:18,200
I'm sorry.

Oh, Mom.
This is painful.

Lily, you were a beauty.

1503
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:19,231
Yeah.

1504
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:24,032
- What happened?
- Hey! Jerk.

1505
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,432
Just hand me the gear,
Mr. DeMille,

1506
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:30,374
- if you'd be so kind.
- Ray: Hold your horses.

1507
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:33,174
Hey, guys! This is me and Big Vic
and we're going fishing!

1508
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:35,044
Hey, Big Vic. What kind of bait
we using this morning?

1509
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:37,242
Only the finest quality.

1510
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:39,683
The kind
the masters bait with.

1511
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:42,119
Honey, that was Vic
that said that, not me.

1512
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:44,350
I'm going blind
over here!

1513
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:47,155
I don't understand
why he left you like that.

1514
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:49,457
(sighs)

1515
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:52,226
I made him go.

1516
01:29:52,253 --> 01:29:54,096
A man needs to spend time
with his friends.

1517
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,624
And so did I.

1518
01:29:57,425 --> 01:29:59,564
- He was cheating on you.
- Sara--!

1519
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:07,011
- Your entire marriage.
- Don't be silly.

1520
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:09,947
- Her name was Betty.
-( laughing )

1521
01:30:16,277 --> 01:30:18,951
Before you girls were born,

1522
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:21,722
we both worked
in sales at Carrulean.

1523
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:24,252
Ray was on the road
all the time.

1524
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:26,231
- So?
- Well, when he was traveling,

1525
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,790
we used to write to each other,

1526
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:30,860
and he got it into his head
to call me "Betty."

1527
01:30:30,892 --> 01:30:32,963
Like Betty Boop.

1528
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:36,004
You're Betty?

1529
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:39,603
Well, didn't you ever wonder
why letters addressed to someone else

1530
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:41,341
ended up in our attic?

1531
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:44,543
But those letters.
They're-

1532
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:47,746
- they're filthy.
- Uh-huh, I know.

1533
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,618
Ugh.

1534
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:51,282
Lily:
I'm in the room here.

1535
01:30:51,312 --> 01:30:54,020
Gross.

1536
01:30:54,048 --> 01:30:56,392
I missed
all of your anniversaries.

1537
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:00,491
I missed every-

1538
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:02,467
Oh, shh.

1539
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:05,232
I thought I'd be a hypocrite.

1540
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,535
Oh, honey.

1541
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:12,907
Oh, my girls.

1542
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:18,509
( Water splashing )

1543
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,467
Dad?

1544
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:37,629
How could I believe
Betty was real?

1545
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:39,865
Maybe you needed
to find your own road.

1546
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:42,807
Didn't you care when I stopped
coming home to visit you?

1547
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,969
Daddy?

1548
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:47,502
When I stopped
answering your calls?

1549
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:49,344
Of course I did.

1550
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:52,180
Maybe you needed to believe
that Betty was real,

1551
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:55,153
or something like that,
to give you the strength-

1552
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:59,647
to give you the fire
to venture out in the world.

1553
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:02,752
But I love you more
than you'll ever know, darling.

1554
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:07,327
I love you so much.

1555
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:18,002
Well, look at that.
You found it.

1556
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:20,478
I probably looked for that thing
all over the lake.

1557
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:33,317
You're gonna do just fine,
sunshine.

1558
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,957
Just fine.

1559
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,368
-( Wind whistling)
- Dad?

1560
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:00,975
Morning.

1561
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:02,919
Good morning, sunshine.

1562
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:04,548
Would you like
some French toast?

1563
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:08,026
Sara! Lily!

1564
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:12,361
Duty calls.

1565
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:15,663
Get the roast out of the freezer.
I want to cook it tonight.

1566
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:21,834
I never would've guessed.

1567
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:29,474
She looks happy.

1568
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:31,676
-( Horn honking )
- Whoops-- there he is.

1569
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:34,152
- He who?
- I got a date.

1570
01:33:37,478 --> 01:33:39,754
- Hey, Carl.
- Hey, Lily.

1571
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:42,090
- Wait.
- Oh.

1572
01:33:42,116 --> 01:33:43,891
Have fun
in La-La land.

1573
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:45,693
-( Phone ringing )
- Oh.

1574
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,722
Whoever that is,
I will call them later.

1575
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:52,194
See you soon.

1576
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:55,366
