Please help me welcome Caleb
Peterson and Paisley Terrell!

21
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:36,663
Hi!

22
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,711
Hello.

23
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:39,812
Hey, Sandra, how are you?

24
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:41,247
Wonderful.

25
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:44,350
Well, don't you two
make just the cutest pair?

26
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:46,252
Thank you so much for
coming to the show.

27
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:47,586
Well, thank you for having us.

28
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,054
We're really so excited.

29
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,223
You see, Caleb and Paisley
have agreed to discuss

30
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:53,592
what makes their
relationship so successful.

31
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,394
So tell us, how do
you make it work?

32
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:58,197
Not only is Caleb a rare breed,

33
00:01:58,198 --> 00:02:01,133
he is the epitome
of every woman's dream.

34
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:05,126
He is sexy, he is driven,
he is successful,

35
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,435
he makes me laugh...

36
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,709
and he spoils me rotten.

37
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,977
You wanna say anything, baby?

38
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:13,212
Yeah, thanks, baby.

39
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:15,714
See, a relationship is
simple, Sandra.

40
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:18,818
You take two people who
really care for one another,

41
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,688
throw them into a pot, stir that
up with a whole lot of trust

42
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:26,459
and sprinkle it with a
handful of tender, loving care

43
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,394
and you get a dish made from
the finest ingredients

44
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:29,395
in the world.

45
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,697
We call that a recipe for love.

46
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:34,333
Oh, that is so beautiful.

47
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:35,835
See, all this talk
about gold diggers

48
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:37,002
really doesn't apply to me.

49
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,438
- Oh?
- I mean, thanks to my GDDS.

50
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,473
Your GDD-what?

51
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:42,041
Gold Diggers Detection Sensor.

52
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,809
Oh, it's a radar for
gold diggers,

53
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,911
a little skill I developed
hanging out at the clubs.

54
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:46,979
Okay.

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,381
See, a man with money is
like a walking ATM machine.

56
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:51,750
But you better believe that
when it come to me,

57
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:56,155
Caleb Peterson, ATM
stands for Another Trick Misled.

58
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:57,389
Ooh!

59
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,357
Well, my goodness.

60
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,092
Well, I am so proud of you.

61
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:01,360
I mean, you guys have seemed
to really build

62
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,496
a strong
relationship built on trust

63
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,764
and void of all
the drama and girl,

64
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:10,098
you know we know there's plenty
of drama out there.

65
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:12,493
Yes, we do.

66
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:14,807
But we are determined
to the go the distance.

67
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:16,509
- Yes, we are.
- The distance?

68
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,979
Well, ding ding dong, do I hear
wedding bells in the distance?

69
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,047
Uh, well, we
have talked about it.

70
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:25,217
I must admit it, I have always
dreamed about the day

71
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,286
where my very own
chocolate Prince Charming

72
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:30,756
would carry me off and take care
of me for the rest of my life.

73
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:34,593
Well, baby, that day is here.

74
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:36,262
Oh my God!

75
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:37,796
What are you doing, Caleb?

76
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:39,765
Are, are, are you... are
we about to have a proposal

77
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:41,534
right here on my show?

78
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,524
That's right, baby.

79
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,773
I want the whole world to see
that when a man loves a woman

80
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:49,542
the way I love you,

81
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:52,845
he has to be willing to take it
to the next level with her.

82
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:57,716
Baby, you make me feel
like Hercules and Rockefeller

83
00:03:57,717 --> 00:03:59,518
wrapped in one.

84
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,555
Paisley, baby,
will you marry me?

85
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,545
- Yes!
- Yes.

86
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:07,626
Yes, Caleb, of course
I'll marry you.

87
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:08,727
Come here, boy.

88
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,195
Oh, so wonderful.

89
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:11,463
Wow.

90
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:14,867
Now listen, though, we
all know that money issues

91
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,535
are the leading cause
of divorce, so,

92
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:19,038
so Caleb, what about
your financial security?

93
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,172
I mean, are you thinking
of asking

94
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:21,807
for a prenuptial agreement?

95
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:24,799
A prenup...
Oh, that's just silly.

96
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,980
We're not Russell and Kimora
or Babyface and Tracey.

97
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:30,716
You talking to
Caleb and Paisley.

98
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:36,155
We got that soft ghetto puff,
puff, pass kind of love.

99
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:41,149
Well, it, it appears Caleb has
just learned to say no, Paisley.

100
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,462
You want me to sign a prenup?

101
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:45,864
Baby, I mean, you know
what's mine is yours

102
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:47,766
and what's
yours is mine, but...

103
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:48,934
But what?

104
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,603
Oh, we hear a but, a but.

105
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:53,172
But I don't want half my money
to be yours if we break up.

106
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:56,342
So you wanna start a marriage
thinking about the end?

107
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:58,177
Well, now, she does have
a good point there, Caleb.

108
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:59,411
Baby, why would
you want the woman

109
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,981
that you claim to love
to sign a prenup?

110
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:03,616
Well, baby, that's my point.

111
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,517
I'm trying to show everybody
here that we love each other

112
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:07,486
so much that you don't
care about my money.

113
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,788
No, what you're trying to show
everybody is that you care more

114
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,457
about your money than
this relationship.

115
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,891
That's not true.

116
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,160
Baby, what is love if
you don't wanna invest in it?

117
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:17,696
Paisley, are you saying then
there is a part of you

118
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:19,798
that wants Caleb's money?

119
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,200
No...
Yes... No.

120
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,801
Well, damn, Paisley...
Which one is it?

121
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:25,971
Maybe our next guest will
help us answer that question.

122
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:29,873
Paisley's best friend
Trina James!

123
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:33,834
Hey, Sandra!

124
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,449
Have a seat, have a seat.

125
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,752
Uh oh, there go my
Gold Digger Detection Sensor.

126
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,520
Girl, you better not
sign no prenup.

127
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,355
Digger, digger...
Digger, digger.

128
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:45,190
Oh, shut up, Caleb.

129
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:47,326
You wouldn't be worried about
no so-called "digger digger",

130
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:50,396
if you wasn't wearing all those
Rolexes, driving fancy cars

131
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:53,766
and buying all them high-end
expensive ugly-ass clothes.

132
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:54,967
What?

133
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,168
You are simply
attracting what you are.

134
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:57,569
Uh, you know what?

135
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,271
If a woman wasn't looking
for a bulls eye,

136
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:01,206
then what I'm wearing
wouldn't be a target.

137
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:02,474
Please.

138
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:03,942
Black men are just mad that
sisters are finally making

139
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:05,611
our step up to the plate.

140
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,279
Thank you.

141
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,548
And what is wrong with stepping
up to the plate?

142
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,250
It's too damn high.

143
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,878
Caleb's brother Damon!

144
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:15,421
I told you she
wouldn't sign no prenup.

145
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:16,422
You can't trust her.

146
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:18,057
I knew you had something
to do with this.

147
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:20,259
Okay, all women want
a man with money, Damon.

148
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,261
And all men have the right
to protect themselves.

149
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:23,495
Exactly.

150
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,330
But they have a responsibility
to protect their woman first.

151
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:26,865
That's right.

152
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,268
Caleb, if you ain't no punk, you
better holler, "We want prenup."

153
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:30,803
- We want prenup!
- We want prenup!

154
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:32,237
Caleb, I am not
signing a prenup.

155
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:33,739
- Then we have a problem.
- Tell 'em, bro.'

156
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,374
Wow.

157
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,209
Okay, if you don't want to
pay the million-dollar price,

158
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,978
then why you looking for
a Halle Berry clone?

159
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:42,481
This been going on
since the beginning of time.

160
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:44,316
- All right, if Eve didn't trick Adam...
- Trick?

161
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,851
Yeah, that's right...
Trick, trick.

162
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:47,152
We wouldn't be
having this conversation.

163
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,721
- Did you just call me a trick?
- Yep.

164
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:50,189
If Adam had been more of a man,

165
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,790
he wouldn't have let
his woman out of his sight

166
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,859
when there was a damn snake
running around the Garden!

167
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,160
Hello.

168
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:56,662
Well, she obviously
wanted to be...

169
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,497
With her own kind!

170
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:02,267
And on that note, we'll
close this segment of the show.

171
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:04,803
Remember, ladies and gentlemen,
there is a thin line

172
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:07,439
between a gold mine
and a gold digger,

173
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,142
so ask yourself
which one are you?

174
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:13,312
I'm Sandra Winslow
and that's our show.

175
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:15,837
Whoo hoo!

Synced and corrected by R3V0LV3R.

177
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:21,780
I'mma be a star,
I'mma be a what.

178
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:25,350
I'mma be a star,
I'mma be a what.

179
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:26,618
I'mma be a star
and I don't give a...

180
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:27,619
'cause I'm gonna be a star.

181
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,688
Go Trina, go Trina.

182
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,324
Go Trina, go Trina.

183
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,625
Go Trina.

184
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:35,060
Yeah, you sure are a star.

185
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:37,029
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, sexy.

186
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,764
Yeah...
Trina, right?

187
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,299
Mm-hmm.

188
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,967
Trina, Bonita, Shaquita, I'll
be whoever you want as long

189
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:44,002
as you keep that shirt
unbuttoned just like that.

190
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,704
Really...
Well, I'm Lionel, Trina.

191
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:47,005
Okay, well, you
'bout to be dinner

192
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,073
if you don't cover
up this entrée.

193
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:49,441
I'm sorry, my bad.

194
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:50,709
I thought I was working
here alone today.

195
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,044
Yeah, Okay.

196
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,112
- Well, you 're lucky I don't bite you.
- Really?

197
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:55,013
I don't have a
problem with that.

198
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:56,615
Long as you don't mind
if I bite you back.

199
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,984
Ooh, you better tame
yourself, Mr. Wild Kingdom,

200
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,152
before this turns
into an episode

201
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:01,920
of When Animals
Attack up in here.

202
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:02,921
Oh, really...
Really?

203
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:05,583
You mean something like this.

204
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:10,729
So what are you, Caleb's frat brother...
Business partner?

205
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,864
Oh, no... The plumber.

206
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:12,764
Ooh, you pushing a
Hummer, that's what up!

207
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,399
You got the H2, the H3?

208
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,467
What you pushing?

209
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:17,102
The H2O, as in water.

210
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,764
I'm his plumber, baby...
Plumber?

211
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:20,806
Ah, hell, you ain't
got no money.

212
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:21,840
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

213
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:22,975
Why do you say that?

214
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,243
I mean, I don't do too bad.

215
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:25,544
Yeah, you don't do too
good either, sweetie.

216
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:26,979
Mm-mm... No.

217
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,415
I can't believe you
brought me on national TV

218
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,417
to tell me you wanted me
to sign a prenup.

219
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:35,954
I was with you when
you had nothing, Caleb.

220
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:37,656
Yeah, but Baby,
when I had nothing,

221
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:40,125
I still had more than half
the people out there.

222
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:41,994
You didn't meet me on
the street corner, Paisley.

223
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:44,830
We met on an exclusive getaway
cruise to Trinidad.

224
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:46,632
Okay, I was on that cruise too.

225
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,500
How you think I got there?

226
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:51,236
Uh, the other dude?

227
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:54,865
The other... Look, point being...

228
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:59,144
I was trying to get away from
one heartbreak

229
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:01,480
and it feels like all I'm doing
is running into another one.

230
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:03,982
Baby, that dude didn't do
nothing but wine and dine

231
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:05,651
his way into your heart.

232
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:09,187
He iced you so much that
he left you frozen in place.

233
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:12,658
But I was the one who
defrosted you, baby.

234
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:14,626
You was cold and depressed.

235
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:18,764
I was the one who put the
warmth back into your life.

236
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,866
I'm feeling a chill up
in here right now.

237
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,534
- Chill out, please.
- That's corny.

238
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:24,469
Chill the hell out.

239
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,371
Bobby might not have been
the best man for me...

240
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:28,173
See, now, now, why
you gotta mention his name?

241
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:29,541
See, I didn't say his name.

242
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:30,709
I said "that dude."

243
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,344
But no, you had
to go and say Bobby.

244
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,780
How you gonna disrespect me in
my crib like that, Paisley?

245
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:37,416
- Come on.
- Do you hear yourself?

246
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:38,850
Your crib?

247
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:40,452
Your life?

248
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,187
Your money.

249
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:44,856
At least Bobby shared more with
me than what he had to offer

250
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:46,358
in the bedroom.

251
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,926
Offering in the bedroom...
This ain't about sex.

252
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,561
Yeah, but most of
the time it is though.

253
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,263
- Uh, Lionel...
- I'm gonna check on the leak though.

254
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:53,925
Let me get the leak.

255
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,801
Paisley.

256
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:58,463
It's just a formality, baby.

257
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:01,139
It's like, it's like when
Dedra has to sign forms

258
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,374
for me at work.

259
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,442
Gosh.

260
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:04,710
Dedra?

261
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:05,877
See, uh-huh,
read him girl.

262
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:07,512
Let him have it...
Let him know.

263
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:10,849
Do not compare me to your
little corporate mistress.

264
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,484
Oh, don't start with that.

265
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:13,752
Please.

266
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,821
Dedra and I are
strictly business,

267
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:17,022
just like this prenup, baby.

268
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:18,256
I told you, no they not.

269
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:19,825
No, they not, no, they
not, no, they not.

270
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:22,260
They're not business,
they're not nothing.

271
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:24,229
Listen, Caleb.

272
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,221
A man with money is wonderful,

273
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,169
but a six-figure man with a $2
heart isn't worth a dime to me.

274
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,504
That's right, girl.

275
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,239
If you want to participate,
set him straight!

276
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,572
How about you
relocate out my house?

277
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:40,512
Baby, can you please get Gangsta
Boo here to go somewhere else?

278
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:41,980
Gangsta Boo?

279
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:45,250
Trina James is 100%
a super modern,

280
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:46,585
classy kind of chick, okay?

281
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:47,853
Check yourself.

282
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:49,454
I'm sorry, but ain't nothing
classy about a woman

283
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:50,956
who screams out
in the middle of a sermon,

284
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,924
"You better preach, nooka."

285
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:54,159
Um, I was hyping him up.

286
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,260
Preachers love that.

287
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:56,428
No, rappers love that.

288
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:57,596
Listen, Paisley,
I'm about to go.

289
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,264
I've been kicked
out of better places.

290
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:00,499
Little man over here is always
asking somebody to leave,

291
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,933
standing in
somebody's business.

292
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,035
I told you before.

293
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,236
I told you once,
I told you twice.

294
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:07,330
He's jealous of our friendship.

295
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:09,474
Man, sound like you got more
problems around here

296
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:11,376
to worry about
than just your plumbing.

297
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,578
Nah, man, ain't got
no problems.

298
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,747
A woman is just
like a boomerang.

299
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,849
You know how to toss her right,
she always come back around,

300
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,418
you know?

301
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,286
Yeah, well, maybe you
need to check your technique.

302
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,788
Looks like she done lost
her sense of direction.

303
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:25,257
Hey, I pay you to repair
my cribs, not my relationships.

304
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:26,558
How much do I owe you?

305
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,060
You're right... You know what?

306
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:31,229
After seeing what I seen today,
this one's on the house, bro.

307
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,891
- Thank you.
- All right, man.

308
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,234
Why you always gotta
put her down like that?

309
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:39,567
Because birds of a feather
flock together.

310
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,907
And I don't want
her gangsta booness

311
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,475
rubbing off on you, baby.

312
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:46,912
Look, I mean, I'm moving
up in the corporate world

313
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:50,245
and I need my woman, my wife...

314
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,117
Hmm.

315
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,619
To uphold a certain image.

316
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,587
What image?

317
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:56,888
You know, soccer mom.

318
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:57,923
Charity functions.

319
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,124
Company picnics.

320
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,926
The corporate life
of a corporate wife.

321
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,794
You know, the heads of the firm
are real strict about this

322
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,029
wholesome image thing.

323
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,019
Mmm, I see.

324
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:11,329
Well, you know, I think
that you forgot to tell them

325
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:15,496
that your fiancée is a vixen.

326
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:17,576
- Vixen?
- Mm-hmm.

327
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,311
You trying to get it started?

328
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:22,380
You trying to... Oh, baby,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

329
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:24,249
You need... no, I
gotta stay focused now.

330
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,884
I'm nervous, okay?

331
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:30,548
Today is my first official
day as junior partner at Smith,

332
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:32,457
Jolly and Rancher.

333
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,892
How do I look, baby...
I'm looking good?

334
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:35,160
Watch me now.

335
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:37,229
Watch me...
This is my Denzel walk.

336
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,219
Mm, mm, mm.

337
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:40,966
Bam!

338
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,234
Look at this...
Bam!

339
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:43,435
That's for "Ebony" right there.

340
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,237
- And boom.
- What's that?

341
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:47,227
"Playgirl.."

342
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,407
You so crazy.

343
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:52,308
Crazy about you, baby.

344
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:55,436
Just give it some time, okay?

345
00:13:56,716 --> 00:14:00,018
I just need to know that
you're with me for me

346
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,350
and not my money.

347
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:05,016
Caleb, this is my paradise.

348
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:07,859
I wouldn't do anything
to mess that up.

349
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,561
People change.

350
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:10,862
Paradises fade.

351
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:13,194
Prenups stay the same.

352
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,901
- I'll think about it.
- That's my girl.

353
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,169
That's what I'm talking about.

354
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,637
Let me see...
you know what?

355
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:19,905
Let me see if I can get
you to give me a yes.

356
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:20,939
Come here...
Come here.

357
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,240
Come here.

358
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:23,408
Mm, mm, come here.

359
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:26,309
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

360
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:29,681
Aw, you're adorable.

361
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,082
Thank you, baby.

362
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,449
I gotta get to work.

363
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,255
All this is for you.

364
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:39,291
You're the reason
I'm doing this now.

365
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,059
- All right?
- Have a great day.

366
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,049
Thank you, baby.

367
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:58,172
Executive assistant
to the junior partner.

368
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,245
Okay.

369
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:02,577
Okay, picture goes here.

370
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:08,308
Okay and this goes here.

371
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:11,556
All right.

372
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:13,291
Right there.

373
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,360
He'll need to sign this later.

374
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:19,057
Put it right there.

375
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,564
Okay.

376
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:25,064
All right.

377
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,106
Ooh.

378
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:30,438
Mmm, that is comfy.

379
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:34,502
This can't be that hard.

380
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,712
Smith, Jolly and Rancher,
this is Caleb Peterson speaking.

381
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:47,225
Oh, hey, Paisley, baby.

382
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:51,662
Oh, yes, I'll buy you a BMW.

383
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:57,469
Oh, yes, baby, of course
we can go to Paris.

384
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,459
Bam!

385
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:01,973
What?

386
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:05,343
No, we can't get married until
you sign that prenup, trick!

387
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,646
Maybe that's
how I should say it.

388
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,447
Sorry.

389
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:10,582
You scared me.

390
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,551
You obviously saw
the show this morning.

391
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:14,886
I did.

392
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:19,550
And, uh, as your assistant
who knows a lot about women,

393
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:23,561
Paisley's not going to
sign her life away.

394
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:27,132
Caleb, you want to date
these high-maintenance women

395
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:29,434
and you expect them
to be honorable.

396
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,736
Paisley's a good woman, Dedra.

397
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,726
Okay.

398
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:35,040
Good woman, huh?

399
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,122
That's, that's debatable.

400
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,244
And she's beautiful.

401
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,445
Men always say that.

402
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:42,047
You know Lionel
the janitor told me that

403
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:43,415
on the way in this morning?

404
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,417
Yeah, but Paisley's
got that cover girl,

405
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:47,686
supermodel type of
beauty, you know?

406
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:49,676
Oh, yeah.

407
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,390
That's right.

408
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:55,723
Yeah, because in
your world, two degrees,

409
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:59,397
closed knees and a Bible
don't mean nothing.

410
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:03,060
For you, it's two-inch
waist, cover girl face

411
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,003
and a big booty
to chase, right?

412
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:07,105
Why you trying
to psychoanalyze me?

413
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:10,008
I don't have to analyze
what I already know.

414
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,443
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

415
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:13,345
Well, since we're being
so analytical

416
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:15,380
and poking our little noses
into other people business,

417
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:17,349
- why you don't have a man?
- What?

418
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,084
Yeah, ever since what's-his-face
broke up with you...

419
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:20,218
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

420
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:21,319
He did not break up with me.

421
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,654
The decision was mutual.

422
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:23,988
Yeah, well, whatever
it was, I haven't seen you

423
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:25,490
with a man since then.

424
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,926
Well, maybe I spend all
my hours working for you.

425
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:29,194
Oh!

426
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:31,129
Oh, so now your being
single is my fault.

427
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,664
Okay.

428
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:36,657
Maybe some men find my
commitment to your success

429
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:39,571
just a little intimidating.

430
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:40,705
You know what?

431
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:42,006
I don't have time for this.

432
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:43,641
Can you please just get
my office together?

433
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:46,303
I gotta get to work.

434
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:50,439
Well, thank you for noticing.

435
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:53,147
- Oh, uh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

436
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,953
Good job.

437
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:56,087
Did you take care of my...

438
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:58,056
Bills for the month...
Paid.

439
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:59,691
- What about changing...
- Voicemail?

440
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:02,861
It now says, "Office of
Caleb Peterson, junior partner."

441
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:04,396
I like the way that sounds.

442
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:05,497
And the parking arrangements?

443
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,432
Been there, done that.

444
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:08,767
Oh, good, then you
got enough time to send...

445
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:10,435
Send flowers to Paisley?

446
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:13,605
Yeah, she should be receiving
those in like, oh, five, four,

447
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,595
three, two and...

448
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,699
Caleb Peterson.

449
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:22,180
Oh, hey, Paisley, baby.

450
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:24,512
Oh, yeah, I know.

451
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:29,517
But you know, it's always
the little things that count.

452
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:31,456
Yeah.

453
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:32,791
I love you too.

454
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,781
All right.

455
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,661
Wait, how did you...

456
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,329
I did tell you that I saw
the show this morning, right?

457
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,865
So I just figured that you'd
want to send some flowers

458
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,197
to smooth things over.

459
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,303
Damn, look at you.

460
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:46,805
- What would I--
- Do without me?

461
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,306
I, I really don't know.

462
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:50,508
Probably finish one
of my own sentences.

463
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:51,709
Shoot.

464
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,278
I mean, why do you
look so surprised?

465
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,213
Five years together,
you would figure

466
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:57,148
I would know
something about you.

467
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:58,516
Oh, you don't know everything.

468
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:00,084
What color
underwear I'm wearing?

469
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:01,886
I'm just kidding.

470
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:03,876
Um, hmm.

471
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:05,557
Blue.

472
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,058
Calvin Klein.

473
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,793
Button fly boxer briefs

474
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:11,062
with the signature logo
on the waistband

475
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:14,499
and might I say,
a little too tight?

476
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,201
You should really think
about a bigger size

477
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:18,369
because if you
could breathe a bit,

478
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,106
you might not be walking
around here so uptight.

479
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:25,098
- I'm just saying.
- You know what?

480
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:28,012
I don't know whether to fire
you for sexual harassment

481
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:29,814
or take that as a compliment.

482
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:33,818
Well, just like you say,
I'm just doing my job, sir.

483
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:35,119
Oh, wait.

484
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,488
Speaking of big offices,
your brother called

485
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:38,189
and said he'll
be here in a minute.

486
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,521
Damn, forgot about that.

487
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:42,360
Why does he need your office?

488
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:46,764
Uh, to meet with another one
of his freak show clients.

489
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,032
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

490
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:49,067
Who is it this week?

491
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,468
I dunno, he said it's a secret.

492
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:51,669
Oh.

493
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,804
Okay.

494
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:54,539
Well, um, wish him luck for me.

495
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,307
Wait a minute, where you going?

496
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:57,442
You're not just going
to leave me

497
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:58,843
to deal with
this nonsense by myself.

498
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:00,478
He's coming, he's coming...
Get up, get up.

499
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,080
- Hey, Damon.
- Hey, how you doing, Dedra?

500
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:04,315
- What are you talking--
- Come on, it's gotta look like my office.

501
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:06,184
Hey, hey, man, don't you do nothing
crazy in my new

502
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:07,719
executive leather chair...
I just got that.

503
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,721
Man, stop playing and get into
character, he's almost here.

504
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:11,456
- I don't see anybody...
- Where is he?

505
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:12,724
He's walking up,
you don't see him?

506
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:13,958
Where?

507
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,483
Look it.

508
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:20,598
Yeah, I'm here
to see Damon Peterson.

509
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,467
Damon, what the hell you doing?

510
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:23,635
Damon?

511
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:25,270
I'm Sway.

512
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,738
- Sway.
- Yeah.

513
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,406
You know, like a boat
rocking back and forth?

514
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:30,775
I'm so smooth, I sway.

515
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:33,177
Oh, so I get it.

516
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:34,479
You're the new artist.

517
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,547
Depends.

518
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:36,548
Depends on what
ya'll got to offer.

519
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:37,749
I'm already giving you money.

520
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,983
Come on, playboy.

521
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:40,718
You're probably
giving Damon some money.

522
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:41,786
I'm Sway.

523
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,922
- You know, like a boat rocking.
- Yeah.

524
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:45,423
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.

525
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:46,758
That's it...
I like her.

526
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,259
So, what ya'll got to
offer a brother?

527
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,727
Uh, I need to consult
with my brother,

528
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:52,719
but he seemed
to disappear... somewhere.

529
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,432
Hold on, man, I'm on the phone.

530
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,801
Oh, yeah, yeah, we'd love
to do the Usher remix.

531
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,102
Yeah, yeah.

532
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,871
Talk to you soon,
Mr. Face.

533
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:01,639
Mr. Babyface, that is.

534
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,207
All right, playboy.

535
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,375
What'd I miss?

536
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:05,543
- Look, Sway, you--
- What?

537
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:08,944
You know, like sway, right?

538
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,214
No, I'm Damon.

539
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:11,416
CEO of Just Us Records?

540
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,717
Oh, so now you're Damon.

541
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:14,218
Of course I'm Damon, bro.

542
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,521
We've been brothers
for about, what, 30 years?

543
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:17,889
I think the junior partner
thing is starting to mess

544
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,691
with your mind... Man,
what's the matter with you?

545
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,759
What's the matter with me...
You the one lost your damn mind.

546
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,495
No, it seems like ya'll got
some crazy dysfunctional

547
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:25,863
sibling rivalry thing going on.

548
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,265
I'll check back
with ya'll later.

549
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,767
Uh, Damon, Sway, whoever
the hell you are right now.

550
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:32,070
You cannot be an artist
and run the company.

551
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:33,805
Come on, bro...
it can be done.

552
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:36,074
Think about Jay-Z,
huh?

553
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:38,409
Look, you take
care of the finances.

554
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,078
Me, I'll book the talent.

555
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,212
You mean booking yourself.

556
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:42,380
Yeah, yeah.

557
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:43,381
See, I told you I like her.

558
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:44,649
Or was that Sway?

559
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,950
Look, Damon, I didn't
put my money into this

560
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:47,352
for you to be a star.

561
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:49,954
We put our money together
so we can make stars, man.

562
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:51,623
Well, let's make Sway a star.

563
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:53,758
I'm telling you,
man, he is the one.

564
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:54,759
I feel it.

565
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,994
I feel him.

566
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:57,228
You know, like you say
you feel about Paisley,

567
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:58,696
only this is real.

568
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:00,331
You know what, you're wrong
for that, but you know what,

569
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,066
see, I've heard this a thousand
times before, Damon.

570
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,301
What are you talking about?

571
00:22:03,302 --> 00:22:05,269
First it was the, uh,
Siamese twins boy band.

572
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,371
What were they called?

573
00:22:06,372 --> 00:22:07,839
- Connected?
- They was hot.

574
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,374
They was just a
little before their time.

575
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,876
Then it was the gay,
blind country rapper.

576
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:13,411
- Boy Charles?
- Boy Charles.

577
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:14,612
How was I supposed to
know the brother was blind?

578
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:17,248
- And now it's you!
- No, now it's Sway.

579
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:18,349
And I'm telling you,
he got some skills.

580
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,684
The ladies will love it.

581
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:21,386
Damon, you took third place
in a talent showcase

582
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:22,553
with only one person in it.

583
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:24,055
Why you gotta bring that up?

584
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:25,490
I was just starting
to get over it.

585
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:26,924
I'm just saying, man,
you know, you get stage fright.

586
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:28,593
That's why I created Sway!

587
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:32,188
Look, when I'm him,
I ain't scared of nothing.

588
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,967
Cross this line, son,
I'll knock your ass out.

589
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,869
Man, take these
damn things off.

590
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,103
You know you can't fight.

591
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,072
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

592
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:42,440
I mean, that's brilliant.

593
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:43,908
The whole alter ego thing.

594
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:44,909
I mean, that could work.

595
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,077
Who's gonna pay for it?

596
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:47,512
Come on, man, give it a shot.

597
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:49,580
Look, let me perform at
your engagement party.

598
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,249
Now, if I'm wack, you
won't hear another word.

599
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,918
If I'm hot, you promise
to back me, huh?

600
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,986
That sounds fair to me.

601
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:56,287
Dedra?

602
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:57,755
But what do I know?

603
00:22:57,756 --> 00:23:00,792
I'm just a little old assistant
and ain't nobody ringing

604
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,226
no wedding bells for me.

605
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:03,394
All right,
man, you can perform.

606
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:05,263
But look, don't you
mess this up.

607
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:07,765
Now can you please get
your schizophrenic butt

608
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:08,833
out of my office?

609
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:10,368
I've got to get to work now.

610
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:11,536
All right, all right, all right,
don't be pushing on me, man.

611
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:12,437
I'll tell Sway.

612
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:14,172
Man, get out of here.

613
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:16,607
Oh, like, oh my God,

614
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:19,940
you guys are, like,
so cute together.

615
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,013
You know what?

616
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:24,549
Just 'cause it's cute
don't mean it won't kill you.

617
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,751
I just hope he don't mess up
my engagement party.

618
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:28,741
Are you coming?

619
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:30,288
Yeah.

620
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:33,655
Yeah, I mean, of course.

621
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:37,983
Um, Caleb?

622
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:39,397
Mm-hmm.

623
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:42,730
There's an opening
in the London office

624
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:47,097
and the partners think that...
I should apply.

625
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:49,974
What...
London?

626
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,109
You're kidding, right?

627
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,510
No.

628
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:54,178
I mean, there's not anything
really left for me here.

629
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,279
There's plenty.

630
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,314
We just got here.

631
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,015
We got a good thing going.

632
00:23:58,016 --> 00:23:59,283
You can't just leave.

633
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:01,919
Look, tell me what
you want and you got it.

634
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,090
I don't think you can
give it to me, Caleb.

635
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:07,358
I forbid you to leave.

636
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,826
If you leave, you're fired.

637
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:11,062
Okay, see, this is why
I didn't want to tell you.

638
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:13,364
You overreact to everything.

639
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:15,199
I'm just thinking about it.

640
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,400
Who put you up to this?

641
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,835
Nobody!

642
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:22,039
Okay, look, I'm here now,
so let's just enjoy the moment.

643
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,574
- Cool?
- Cool.

644
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:27,237
Now, I want you
looking your best, right?

645
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,747
Hold on.

646
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:33,151
Come on, your mama
would be upset with you,

647
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:36,313
Mr. Junior Partner.

648
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:39,154
All right.

649
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:41,058
Thank you.

650
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:42,693
Wait, wait, wait.

651
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:43,995
- What?
- Come here.

652
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:45,985
Come here.

653
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:47,398
What?

654
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,268
I want you looking
your best too,

655
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:52,600
Miss Junior Partner Assistant.

656
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:55,269
My junior partner assistant.

657
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:57,074
- Caleb!
- What?

658
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:58,776
Stop it!

659
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,077
What is it?

660
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:02,547
Look, why you wanna
leave all this?

661
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:03,481
Huh?

662
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:05,082
Caleb, what are you doing?

663
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:08,043
I promised myself I'd do
this when I made partner.

664
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:15,760
This is your world, honey.

665
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:17,895
Okay, and as your friend,
I am telling you,

666
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:18,996
you are not signing no prenup.

667
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:20,431
Hmm.

668
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:23,868
You have been there for
Caleb through thick and thin.

669
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:25,303
- Yeah, I have.
- Uh-huh.

670
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:26,704
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

671
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:29,607
You gotta have some kind of
insurance policy on him.

672
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,042
I got an idea.

673
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,277
Someone to make him jealous.

674
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:34,478
Oh, uh-uh,
Trina.

675
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,314
I am done with games.

676
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:39,647
Yoo hoo, Sister Winslow
in the building!

677
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:40,985
Yoo hoo!

678
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:42,620
I'll be right back,
I gotta talk to her.

679
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:45,323
Sandra, you look nice with...
when you dress up like that!

680
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:47,058
You had a great
show today, Sandra.

681
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,392
Ooh, come here.

682
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:49,927
I was thinking, you
ought to let me co-host.

683
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:52,463
Honey, me and you could me
the new Oprah and Gayle!

684
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:56,133
No, no, no, I don't
need another co-ho... st.

685
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:57,435
How did she break that up?

686
00:25:57,436 --> 00:25:59,757
Paisley,
congratulations, sweetie.

687
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:02,127
Thank you.

688
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:03,641
You know you
started something, right?

689
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:05,276
Oh, guilty as charged,

690
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,945
but my ratings went
through the roof, honey.

691
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:09,914
Mm, at the expense
of our relationship.

692
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:12,016
Well, you know what they say.

693
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:16,680
Every good relationship needs to
go through a challenge or two.

694
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:17,855
Who says that?

695
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,457
I say that.

696
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,826
Whoo, you ladies look good!

697
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,127
Mmm.

698
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:24,228
Can I get ya'll
something to drink?

699
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:25,563
Lionel, you a waiter, too?

700
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:27,064
Yeah, just a little
something-something

701
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:28,366
I do on the side...
What can I get you?

702
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:29,834
How many sides you got?

703
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:32,403
Mm, however many you
think you can handle, baby.

704
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:33,638
Please.

705
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:35,206
Tell this man it's going
to take more than a tray table

706
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:37,108
and plumber to
drain these pipes.

707
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,876
Perhaps you'd like a
screwdriver, baby...

708
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:39,977
I'll have a Merlot.

709
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:41,545
That's what you gonna get.

710
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:44,115
If I was your co-host, I would
have let you know it's Mer-lot.

711
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:45,283
You see what I'm saying?

712
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:46,684
Me and you could
do good together.

713
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,152
I would let you know,
if I was the co-host.

714
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:50,221
Do you speak French?

715
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:54,058
Speak of the devil
and he will show his face.

716
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,259
See that?

717
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,694
I told you you might be
his trophy wife,

718
00:26:56,695 --> 00:26:58,396
but that thing there,
that's his girlfriend

719
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:00,164
and why you getting
shelved, guess who gonna be

720
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:02,066
getting slipped up under
your bed sheets?

721
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,668
Yup...
Ugly Betty.

722
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:04,902
Betty le fea!

723
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:06,037
What's up?

724
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:07,605
- We need to talk.
- About what?

725
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:09,473
Why are you gonna come up
in here with her like that?

726
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,509
People looking at ya'll like
ya'll are the ones engaged.

727
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,171
What people, you and Trina?

728
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:16,346
Congratulations, you two.

729
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:19,684
I'm sure heaven is so
excited about this union.

730
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:21,085
Thank you.

731
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:24,021
And I'm sure hell can't
wait for you to come back home.

732
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:26,557
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay, Caleb.

733
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,560
As Mama always said,
never back a woman in a corner

734
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:31,662
'cause you never know when
you find a tramp.

735
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:33,297
What'd you say...
Did you say, "tramp?"

736
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:35,466
Is something wrong with you?

737
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:38,302
Ladies and gentlemen, Just Us
Records would like to showcase

738
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:40,438

"I like her this
and that, that."

745
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:07,231
"Make my heart
pitter pat, pat."

746
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:08,566
"She blows a kiss at Sway."

747
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,267
"Then waits for
him to come tap that."

748
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:11,569
"I like the cat on that, that"

749
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,970
"it's yummy too

750
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:14,205
"I hate to see her mad man"

751
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:15,740
"it makes me like a mad man."

752
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:17,141
"I dress up like a bad man."

753
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:18,642
"Tie up the nearest ad man."

754
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:20,011
"I hold him hostage."

755
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:21,312
"Till they send
in Kevin Spacey grandad."

756
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:24,015
"I'm just saying I get
off of my rocker."

757
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:25,316
"When she in the bad mood."

758
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:27,084
"Or when we round
some cockblockers."

759
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:28,185
"I need it like clockwork."

760
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:29,286
"On call."

761
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,555
"I'll agree to stop
being a jerk"

762
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,157
"if you agree to have a ball."

763
00:28:33,158 --> 00:28:36,060
"Matter of fact why don't you
just go and have them both"

764
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,461
"but you don't
you get too greedy baby"

765
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:39,096

00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,567
"Go and grab the "Troni."

769
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:44,869
"And meet me inside the
boom boom room."

770
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,303
"I'mma warm the room up and."

771
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:47,705
"Zoom up inside

"Yeah baby "cause Sway

"And boom go the dynamite."

"She got that dynamite."

789
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:17,134
"Not just things I kinda like."

790
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:19,937
"But what I'd fantasize
about if it were 25 to life."

791
00:29:19,938 --> 00:29:21,539
"Yeah she fine, all right."

792
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,041
"She's throwing
curves like baseball."

793
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,210
"Meaning you can hit it if
your time is right."

794
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:29,046
"She's so sexy that what

795
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,514
"Might turn into whoa,
whoa, whoa."

796
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:31,916
"You just can't
show it any time of night."

797
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,250
"I'm not the silent type."

798
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:34,685

00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:41,892
"That boom, boom, boom."

803
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:44,562
"Yeah baby until you make it

00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:07,318
Whoa, man, that
was off the hook!

812
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,786
- You like that?
- Yeah!

813
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:09,687
That was so great.

814
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:12,019
Thank you, thank you.

815
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:14,125
Man, I told you,
I told you I am somebody.

816
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:15,759
I don't care what nobody
say, I'm signing me.

817
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
It's going down.

818
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:17,728
I told you.

819
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:19,029
I told you that
was a brilliant idea.

820
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,396
You did, you did.

821
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:27,071
Yeah, well, you know,
it's been a really long evening

822
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,572
at the office.

823
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:29,907
I think I'm just going to turn
in a little early tonight.

824
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:32,176
I'm incredibly,
incredibly tired.

825
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:33,511
Get a life.

826
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:35,246
- Baby.
- Get a degree.

827
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:36,614
Okay.

828
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,883
What is wrong with your friend?

829
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:40,518
I dunno...
Drama.

830
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,652
That boom, boom, boom!

831
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:43,053
- I like it!
- You like it?

832
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:45,990
Yeah, so you gonna put
me in your video, right?

833
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:47,825
Girl, nah, I need some
experienced hos,

834
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:49,226
not no wannabes...
Excuse me.

835
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:50,294
What are you talking about?

836
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:51,362
I am experienced.

837
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,763
Damon!

838
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:54,732
Did he just... did
he just call me a ho?

839
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:56,233
I want you to try this, baby.

840
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:57,501
I made it just for you.

841
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:59,036
Oh, no, I ain't trying that.

842
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:01,972
You're making something and
trying to take advantage of me.

843
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:03,340
Exactly!

844
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:04,742
Now take it today!

845
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:06,744
Ladies and gentlemen, if
I could have your attention,

846
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,713
gather 'round because I would
like to propose a toast'

847
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:13,150
to Caleb and Paisley on
their glorious engagement,

848
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:15,586
which of course, you know, was
announced on my show.

849
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:17,221
Yes, it was.

850
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:21,885
Be blessed, you two and may
you live happily ever after.

851
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,383
Amen to that.

852
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:26,497
Bobby?

853
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:27,598
What's he doing here?

854
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,567
Who is this?

855
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:31,669
Hey, man, this party
is invitation only.

856
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,238
Sorry, I just came by to say
congratulations to Paisley.

857
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:36,440
No, you better do it by email
or Facebook or something,

858
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:37,875
because you ain't
welcome here, brah.

859
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:38,976
What's up, partner?

860
00:31:38,977 --> 00:31:41,445
Look, man, I'm just
in town for a hot second.

861
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:45,049
I saw your little episode
on the TV show

862
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,184
and I'm glad to see
you two worked it out.

863
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:48,252
I'm happy for you.

864
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:49,353
Appreciate that.

865
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:51,685
These are for you.

866
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,879
Keys?

867
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:56,360
Bobby, why do I need keys?

868
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:57,728
Caleb already has the keys
to my heart.

869
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:59,363
He may have the keys
to your heart, but these keys

870
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:02,366
are to the Porsche I have
parked out front.

871
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:04,134
Damn!

872
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:05,236
What the hell?

873
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:06,370
You bought me a Porsche?

874
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:08,505
Uh, look, look here, brother.

875
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:10,474
I hope you kept the receipt

876
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:12,643
'cause Paisley's
already got a ride.

877
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:14,178
I know you're not
talking about that 1920

878
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:16,747
get-out-and-go-push car she
got that you bought her.

879
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:19,049
Uh, Trina, don't you know
when to shut your damn mouth?

880
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,751
Nope.

881
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:24,388
Baby, he's just trying to show
his appreciation, that's all.

882
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,223
Baby, baby, what the
hell you think you're doing?

883
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:28,492
Forgive me, uh, Khalib, right?

884
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:30,160
Wrong...
it's Caleb.

885
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,495
Well, whatever...
Bobby.

886
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:32,696
I know who you are.

887
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:33,764
That's good.

888
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:35,399
That means she hasn't
forgotten.

889
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,568
Look, man, you ain't
got nothing to worry about.

890
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:40,560
You got yourself a
remarkable woman.

891
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:45,665
Seems she got herself a
good man, so congratulations.

892
00:32:45,777 --> 00:32:48,108
Registration's in your name.

893
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:49,246
Swag!

894
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:50,447
Oh my God.

895
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:51,515
Girl, let's go!

896
00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:52,716
Let's go give it a test drive!

897
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:54,451
A Porsche, honey, yeah!

898
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:56,520
We got a Porsche!

899
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:57,621
I don't think so.

900
00:32:57,622 --> 00:32:58,722
Give me the keys to this.

901
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:00,124
Uh-uh, ain't
happening, not today.

902
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,759
Hurry up, let's go!

903
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,560
Caleb, why are
you being so childish?

904
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:04,828
It was just a gift.

905
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:06,730
Because ain't no man gonna
come up in my house

906
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:09,633
at my engagement party and
buy my woman no damn Porsche.

907
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:11,035
Yo, Caleb, why are
you tripping?

908
00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:12,603
It's just a car, man.

909
00:33:12,604 --> 00:33:14,705
I'm tripping because ain't
no brother gonna buy a woman

910
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:17,841
a damn Porsche unless he wants
something in return.

911
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:18,876
Yup.

912
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,544
Something like what, Caleb?

913
00:33:20,545 --> 00:33:21,812
I don't know, Paisley.

914
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,048
Ain't got no keys...
You tell me.

915
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,550
I don't think I like what you're
trying to say to me, Caleb.

916
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:29,153
You see, it's her car, but
I'm sure if you sign a prenup,

917
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:30,421
she'll let you drive it.

918
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:31,922
Hey...
Ho cake.

919
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:33,490
I'm sure if I shove my fist to
the back of your throat,

920
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:34,858
- I can snatch out your tongue.
- Who are you talking to?

921
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:37,061
- Can he talk to me like that?
- I'm talking to you.

922
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:38,195
It's fine.

923
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:40,531
I will give back the keys.

924
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:43,767
He was just trying to wish me
well... wish us well.

925
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:45,002
Us?

926
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:47,905
I mean, then why is the
registration in your name only

927
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:48,972
if it's us?

928
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:50,174
Damn, bro, you
sound like you jealous.

929
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:51,342
No, this ain't about jealous.

930
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:52,443
I'm just saying,
when is the last time

931
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:53,444
you talked to this dude?

932
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:54,445
Like, last year?

933
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:55,979
- Last week.
- What?

934
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,348
Oh no, beat her.

935
00:33:57,349 --> 00:34:00,340
Beat her ass...
Use my belt.

936
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:03,721
When was you planning
on tell me this, Paisley?

937
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:05,789
I didn't think it mattered.

938
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,391
Look, let's just
forget everything ever happened

939
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:08,492
and just enjoy it.

940
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:10,482
Enjoy what, Paisley?

941
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,030
My future wife
entertaining her ex-love?

942
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:14,298
That's right.

943
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:16,288
My ex-love.

944
00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:19,596
You're just gonna
have to trust me.

945
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:24,475
I told you it would work, girl.

946
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:25,642
Another man in the picture

947
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,045
and you're back
in the driver's seat.

948
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:31,548
Except only this time, that seat
is attached to a Porsche.

949
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:34,084
This is not what I wanted.

950
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:35,953
Look, P, okay?

951
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:38,389
Bobby has more money,
he's ready to settle down

952
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,390
and you're still in
love with him.

953
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:40,657
What's the problem?

954
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:42,393
I am not in love
with Bobby anymore.

955
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:43,660
Oh really?

956
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:45,062
Then why your eyes light
up like floodlights

957
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:47,498
every time you see him?

958
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:50,160
- They do not!
- They do.

959
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,870
Look, you're single
till you're married, girl.

960
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:54,671
Give Bobby a chance.

961
00:34:54,672 --> 00:34:56,832
See what he's talking about.

962
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:59,076
Ooh, that's my alarm.

963
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:01,178
- Yep, gotta go.
- Where you going?

964
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,914
Girl, I met this rich doctor.

965
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,549
He says that
every time he sees me,

966
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,086
he just feels like giving
me a free check-up!

967
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:11,288
I told him if his checkbook
checks out then hell,

968
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:12,756
he can spin me like a bottle.

969
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:14,358
I don't care as long as he
keeps paying that tab.

970
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:16,226
Peace, girl, love you.

971
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:18,558
- You too.
- Call me!

972
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:33,765
Come in.

973
00:35:34,145 --> 00:35:37,443
Trina, what did you forget?

974
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,485
Bobby, you cannot
keep popping up in here!

975
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:44,147
What if Caleb was here?

976
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:45,756
Oh, he's not here.

977
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:46,857
No.

978
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:49,827
But he will be when
he gets back from work.

979
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:52,129
I just had to see you.

980
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:56,463
I got so excited when you
called, I-l couldn't wait.

981
00:35:57,202 --> 00:36:02,172
I just called you to tell you
that I can't keep the Porsche.

982
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:03,240
It's too much.

983
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,175
Not for you.

984
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:07,678
Why are you showing me all
this attention all of a sudden?

985
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,681
'Cause I miss
having you in my life.'

986
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:12,649
When I was in your life,
I played second string

987
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,485
to all these NBA clients.

988
00:36:14,486 --> 00:36:16,920
I was building my career.

989
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:20,583
You should have
built your career with me.

990
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,793
I know.

991
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:25,659
But you should have waited.

992
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,166
You were supposed
to go for LA for a week

993
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,367
and then send for me.

994
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:31,535
I sent you a plane ticket.

995
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:33,637
Bobby, that was
two years later!

996
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:35,172
How much waiting can there be?

997
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:37,808
Rome wasn't built in a day.

998
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:42,142
Now I was trying to go
from rich to wealthy.

999
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:47,343
Well, you're too late
'cause I moved on.

1000
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:49,875
So move back.

1001
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:55,788
Let me make it up to you.

1002
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:59,789
You know I... I opened
an office downtown.

1003
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:03,088
You did what?

1004
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:04,535
I thought you
were just gonna...

1005
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:07,070
I know, you thought I
was passing through.

1006
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:11,404
I just didn't want your little
boyfriend raising no eyebrows.

1007
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:13,377
My fiancée.

1008
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:15,078
What's in a title?

1009
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:19,412
Look, the point is, my
clients come to me now.

1010
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:24,487
So I can come to you and give
you anything you want.

1011
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:28,825
Not if I don't want it.

1012
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:32,029
You want to be with a man who
wants you to sign a prenup

1013
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,530
when you could be with a
man who's going to give you

1014
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,862
anything your heart desires.

1015
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:39,670
What my heart desires
is somebody that's going

1016
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,138
to be there.

1017
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:42,873
And I will, woman.

1018
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:44,863
I will.

1019
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:49,542
I'm gonna love you.

1020
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,281
I'm gonna love you so deep

1021
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:56,742
that your grandma's grandma
gonna feel it in her bones.

1022
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:04,887
Your knees are gonna
buckle when I step in the room.

1023
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:08,520
Mmm.

1024
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:10,864
On your way out...

1025
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:14,801
Not even gonna
think about your body.

1026
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:18,641
Gonna be making
love to you so...

1027
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:29,753
I can't do this!

1028
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:31,521
- Come on.
- No, it ain't right!

1029
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:33,023
Why are you trying to make
this so hard on me?

1030
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:36,159
I was just trying to get
you to follow your heart.

1031
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,061
What?

1032
00:38:38,062 --> 00:38:40,051
That's all.

1033
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:41,331
Hmm?

1034
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:43,734
Look, Caleb's gonna be home!

1035
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:45,302
- You gotta go.
- No, no.

1036
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:46,470
Then let's go to your crib.

1037
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,460
My what...
Crib?

1038
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,241
House I bought you
in the hills.

1039
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:52,476
What house?

1040
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:53,710
You bought me a house?

1041
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,646
That's right...
Two stories.

1042
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:57,814
Filled with your
wildest fantasies.

1043
00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:01,518
Bobby, I don't know...
Whoa, you said two stories?

1044
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,920
We can make it three.

1045
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:06,582
All right...
Say the word.

1046
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:08,025
Word.

1047
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:09,426
That's what I'm talking about.

1048
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:10,594
Let's go check it out, okay?

1049
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:12,095
Okay, but we gotta go!

1050
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:13,096
All right, all right,
all right.

1051
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:14,598
Wait, wait, wait, my shoes.

1052
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:17,294
I gotta get my shoes.

1053
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:25,330
- Hey, baby.
- Hey!

1054
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:28,278
What's wrong with you?

1055
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:30,280
I'm just so happy to see you.

1056
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:32,683
You act like you saw a ghost.

1057
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:34,284
How was your day, baby?

1058
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:35,552
It was long and hard.

1059
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:36,820
Mm-hmm, I know
what you mean.

1060
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:37,788
- What?
- Huh?

1061
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:39,589
What was long about your day?

1062
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,579
Nothing.

1063
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:44,061
Hey, come here.

1064
00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:45,462
Come here.

1065
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:46,863
Come here.

1066
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:48,999
What's... what's
wrong with you?

1067
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,233
Why you all wet?

1068
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:52,565
Not wet...
Oh, wet.

1069
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,661
I, uh, I was just cleaning.

1070
00:39:56,874 --> 00:39:58,341
I'm so hot.

1071
00:39:58,342 --> 00:39:59,342
How about something to drink?

1072
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:00,510
Yes, God, yes.

1073
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:02,345
Can I have a... I would
love a glass...

1074
00:40:02,346 --> 00:40:03,413
- Excuse me?
- Hennessy!

1075
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:05,315
- Hennessy?
- Mm-hmm.

1076
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:06,483
You've been hanging
out with Trina too long.

1077
00:40:06,484 --> 00:40:08,151
How about some bottled water?

1078
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:09,152
Good... Go.

1079
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:10,320
Can you get it for me please?

1080
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:12,845
I'm so hot.

1081
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:17,623
Bobby.

1082
00:40:18,629 --> 00:40:20,063
What's with all the screaming?

1083
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:22,699
Nothing, I'm just so excited
to see this house.

1084
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,201
You're gonna love it too.

1085
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:26,536
Yes, you can tell me all
about it in the car, okay?

1086
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:27,938
Okay, I'm going to
take you there.

1087
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:29,239
I know, I can't wait.

1088
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,841
Okay... I'm just going
to freshen up.

1089
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:32,809
- You can wait for me in the car.
- All right, all right...

1090
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,177
Okay...
Okay.

1091
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:35,746
Go!

1092
00:40:35,747 --> 00:40:38,081
You wanna spring or sparkling?

1093
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:40,071
Just pick one.

1094
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:43,341
All righty then.

1095
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:45,422
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1096
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:46,590
Menstruation cycle.

1097
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:47,858
Around and around we go.

1098
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:51,089
I'm going to go turn it in.

1099
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:03,540
I left my watch.

1100
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,675
Oh, baby, you shouldn't have!

1101
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:07,244
You bought me a watch?

1102
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:08,678
Hey, Bobby.

1103
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,281
- What are you doing here?
- What the hell are you doing here?

1104
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:13,183
This is my house.

1105
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:15,173
That's my watch.

1106
00:41:15,253 --> 00:41:16,753
What the hell is
going on, Paisley?

1107
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:18,421
It's not what you think.

1108
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:19,856
Oh really?

1109
00:41:19,857 --> 00:41:21,691
What is it then?

1110
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:22,793
He just happened to stop by.

1111
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:24,394
- For what?
- For my woman.

1112
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:26,062
Well, too bad you're
leaving with just your watch.

1113
00:41:26,063 --> 00:41:27,998
Now get out before I add
a beat down with it.

1114
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:29,099
Look, Caleb.

1115
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,467
We were just talking.

1116
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:31,568
Why don't you tell him
about the crib I bought you?

1117
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:33,336
- What crib?
- Stop, Bobby.

1118
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:34,437
What crib?

1119
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:35,806
Come on, don't be shocked.

1120
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:39,342
Everything she got up
in here, I paid for.

1121
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:42,538
Bobby Tremaine is
all over this house.

1122
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:46,616
Is that true, Paisley?

1123
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:47,984
Of course it's true.

1124
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:51,920
And all you gotta do
is make a choice.

1125
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:56,014
Him or me?

1126
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,527
Bobby.

1127
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:59,095
Yo, man, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

1128
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:00,864
What I've been waiting to do for
the last two and a half years.

1129
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:02,365
Well, you're going
to have to keep waiting

1130
00:42:02,366 --> 00:42:04,734
because Paisley is already
getting married.

1131
00:42:04,735 --> 00:42:06,136
I know.

1132
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:07,671
To me.

1133
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:09,639
- You know what...
- No, Caleb!

1134
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,341
Look, Bobby, I can't do this.

1135
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:12,943
Yes, you can.

1136
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:16,313
All you gotta do is
make a decision.

1137
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:18,315
Who you gonna choose, Paisley?

1138
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:20,943
Him or me?

1139
00:42:30,661 --> 00:42:31,795
Caleb!

1140
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:33,430
Hey!

1141
00:42:33,431 --> 00:42:34,798
Damn, dog.

1142
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,867
What happened
to your furniture?

1143
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:38,602
She took it.

1144
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:39,502
What?

1145
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:40,904
She took everything.

1146
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:42,894
Why?

1147
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:45,772
I told her to.

1148
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:47,544
Why?

1149
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:50,413
I didn't think she
was really gonna do it.

1150
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:54,584
It was all tainted with her
gold digging stench anyway.

1151
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:55,685
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

1152
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:58,677
I told you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1153
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:01,791
Dedra told me that they
fired you from the firm,

1154
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,560
ain't been out your house
for a couple of weeks.

1155
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:04,828
Is that why you ain't
been answering your phone?

1156
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:07,197
'Cause I'm trying to
call you all week.

1157
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:08,665
Ain't got no phone.

1158
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:09,833
Why not?

1159
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:11,368
She took it.

1160
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:13,036
She took the phone?

1161
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:15,368
What about your mobile?

1162
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:17,007
Disconnected.

1163
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:20,543
Hey, you think we could
get those Siamese twins back?

1164
00:43:20,544 --> 00:43:22,045
- Connected?
- Yeah.

1165
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:23,313
They went solo.

1166
00:43:23,314 --> 00:43:25,315
Oh...
Good for them.

1167
00:43:25,316 --> 00:43:26,650
Look, man.

1168
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:27,651
You said you were going
to come with me

1169
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:29,185
to meet the record execs.

1170
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:30,921
Now get up.

1171
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:32,322
Ah, man, just do it
without me, man.

1172
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:33,390
I can't do it by myself, man.

1173
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:34,791
- Get up.
- Come on, man.

1174
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:37,260
All you have to do is
put on your sunglasses

1175
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:39,396
and do your alter ego thing.

1176
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:40,530
I ain't got time for
this right now, Caleb.

1177
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:42,165
We got way too much to do.

1178
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,867
Just give it up, Damon.

1179
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:45,235
It's over.

1180
00:43:45,236 --> 00:43:46,336
What are you talking about?

1181
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:48,326
Look at me.

1182
00:43:50,508 --> 00:43:54,170
I was on top of the world, man.

1183
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:56,279
Now what I got?

1184
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,347
Get up.

1185
00:43:57,348 --> 00:43:58,615
Get your ass up...
Come on!

1186
00:43:58,616 --> 00:44:00,850
I'm tired of
helping you, Damon.

1187
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,252
Don't act like I'm the one
with the problems.

1188
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:04,154
I know I got problems.

1189
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:07,724
But as long as I can get you
and all these other crabs

1190
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:10,026
off my back,
I'm gonna be just fine.

1191
00:44:10,027 --> 00:44:11,227
Mm-hmm...
Know what?

1192
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:12,495
Crabs keep you down.

1193
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:13,930
I'm your brother, so
I'm going to get you up.

1194
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:16,132
Get up...
Come on, man.

1195
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:17,500
You better than this.

1196
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:18,969
Damon!

1197
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,303
Damon, what are you doing?

1198
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:21,838
Trying to shake
some sense into this bum.

1199
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,373
Look, we gotta be there
in two hours, man.

1200
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:24,574
Two hours.

1201
00:44:24,575 --> 00:44:25,675
Damon.

1202
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:27,510
Okay, look, why
don't you go and get ready?

1203
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:29,679
I will make sure he's there.

1204
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,875
Okay?

1205
00:44:35,853 --> 00:44:39,155
Love what you've
done with the place.

1206
00:44:39,156 --> 00:44:42,147
I didn't ask for you, Dedra.

1207
00:44:42,827 --> 00:44:44,160
I didn't ask for none of ya'll,

1208
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:46,822
so please just get out.

1209
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:48,798
I'm here to help, Caleb.

1210
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:52,791
You can't help me, so please
just stop trying.

1211
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:55,038
You can get
through this, you know.

1212
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,340
I don't want to hear
that, Dedra, so just...

1213
00:44:57,341 --> 00:44:58,375
just leave me alone.

1214
00:44:58,376 --> 00:44:59,509
Fine.

1215
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,777
Fine... I'll go.

1216
00:45:00,778 --> 00:45:02,345
Fine.

1217
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:05,940
- Just leave.
- I am... Next week.

1218
00:45:08,386 --> 00:45:10,987
I took the job in London.

1219
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:15,158
So you won't have to
worry about me ever again.

1220
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:16,326
Just like all the rest.

1221
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:18,316
Just... just go.

1222
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,821
You know it's
your fault, right?

1223
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:25,135
Caleb!

1224
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:27,137
You are better than this.

1225
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:29,105
You have all this love to give

1226
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:32,939
and you just keep letting it
fall into the wrong hands.

1227
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:38,915
Caleb, what are you doing?

1228
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:40,905
I don't know.

1229
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:42,652
Would you please stop?

1230
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:43,887
What if I don't want to?

1231
00:45:43,888 --> 00:45:44,821
I think you should.

1232
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:46,056
I'm feeling better already.

1233
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:47,323
Because you're drunk, Caleb!

1234
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:48,324
Make me sober.

1235
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:49,492
- I can't.
- Why not?

1236
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:52,395
Because you don't
know what you want.

1237
00:45:52,396 --> 00:45:54,364
You know what I want.

1238
00:45:54,365 --> 00:45:57,567
Just costs too much to have it.

1239
00:45:57,568 --> 00:45:59,769
Well, if you would stop
trying to buy it,

1240
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:03,102
maybe you wouldn't
have all these problems.

1241
00:46:03,307 --> 00:46:05,141
You know, it costs more than
what's in your wallet, Caleb.

1242
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:06,476
Did you know that?

1243
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:08,244
I don't need a
financial advisor, Dedra.

1244
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:11,114
All I want is for you to be
here for me right now.

1245
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:12,615
Oh, be here?

1246
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:15,118
Oh, okay, because before,
you wanted me to leave.

1247
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,854
Now you want me to stay.

1248
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,457
Caleb, love
isn't a constant high.

1249
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:23,790
Sometimes, love isn't new,
bright and expensive.

1250
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:28,127
Love is, is complex...

1251
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:29,232
and so simple sometimes.

1252
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:31,067
Just leave, Dedra.

1253
00:46:31,068 --> 00:46:32,102
I can't do that.

1254
00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:33,603
Why not...
Everybody else did!

1255
00:46:33,604 --> 00:46:36,739
Because I can't walk
out on the man that I love.

1256
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,401
You hear me?

1257
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:47,580
Just let me rest in peace.

1258
00:46:56,827 --> 00:46:59,488
You feel sorry for yourself.

1259
00:47:00,164 --> 00:47:02,153
You lay there.

1260
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:04,501
Don't expect me
to lay there with you

1261
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:08,869
because I have too much
life to live.

1262
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:15,368
I'm so sorry.

1263
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,454
Come here.

1264
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:25,922
Come here.

1265
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:29,653
Get up.

1266
00:47:33,297 --> 00:47:36,492
Shut up.

1267
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:40,726
I'm not gonna let you go.

1268
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:54,184
Ooh, now that's a ring.

1269
00:47:54,185 --> 00:47:56,152
See, I told you.

1270
00:47:56,153 --> 00:47:58,142
I'm jealous, girl.

1271
00:47:58,956 --> 00:48:02,158
You got a real chance
now living the dream life.

1272
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,151
Speaking of dream life, how
is your free check-up?

1273
00:48:06,297 --> 00:48:08,298
Oh, I didn't tell you?

1274
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:12,001
Oh, that dude is out of breath
somewhere damn near unconscious.

1275
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:14,237
- Stop it.
- What, my doctor needs a doctor.

1276
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:15,538
I'm serious.

1277
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:18,374
Gifts have been flowing
in ever since, honey.

1278
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:21,077
Looks like you might
have found your Mr. Perfect.

1279
00:48:21,078 --> 00:48:24,147
Everything on the checklist
checks out, so we'll see.

1280
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:26,479
All right, all right.

1281
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,051
Here you are.

1282
00:48:28,052 --> 00:48:29,052
- Okay.
- Lionel?

1283
00:48:29,053 --> 00:48:30,286
- You work here?
- This dude.

1284
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:31,287
Another little
something-something

1285
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:32,422
I do on the side.

1286
00:48:32,423 --> 00:48:34,190
Brother got bills, you know?

1287
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:36,526
And here's a special
drink for a special lady.

1288
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:37,660
- Oh, thank you... this is him.

1289
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:38,628
Hello?

1290
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:40,096
- Hey, baby.
- Baby?

1291
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:43,299
Good, how are you... I'm here
with Paisley having coffee.

1292
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,063
What you doing?

1293
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:52,698
Why?

1294
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:57,480
I don't want to talk
in person, I'm busy, babe.

1295
00:48:57,481 --> 00:48:59,749
What's going on...
You can tell me.

1296
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,739
Tell me now.

1297
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,957
Oh...
Are you sure?

1298
00:49:20,604 --> 00:49:22,739
Listen, you don't know me and
I don't really know you

1299
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,108
so until you get your facts
straight, don't call me again.

1300
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:26,542
Thank you.

1301
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:28,543
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1302
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:30,113
Let's go.

1303
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:31,648
Paisley, let's go.

1304
00:49:31,649 --> 00:49:34,951
We're not going anywhere
until you talk to me.

1305
00:49:34,952 --> 00:49:36,753
What, did he turn out
to be a dog or something?

1306
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:38,855
What's wrong...
What's wrong, huh?

1307
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:40,323
You need me to get
somebody for you?

1308
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:41,858
What's the matter, Trina?

1309
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:43,893
The matter is that ya'll keep
asking me what's the matter.

1310
00:49:43,894 --> 00:49:47,658
Let's go...
I'm fine.

1311
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:51,899
I'm good.

1312
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:55,872
I'm Trina James, I'm perfect.

1313
00:49:55,873 --> 00:49:56,873
Right?

1314
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:57,840
Yes, yes.

1315
00:49:57,841 --> 00:50:01,503
- You are as perfect as...
- You know what?

1316
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:03,680
I'm fine.

1317
00:50:03,681 --> 00:50:04,580
Let's go.

1318
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:05,782
Just forget it.

1319
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:07,850
It's going to be okay, Trina.

1320
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:09,840
All right?

1321
00:50:10,254 --> 00:50:11,487
What's wrong?

1322
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:14,149
He found a lump, Paisley.

1323
00:50:14,858 --> 00:50:16,959
In the middle of me making
him feel like a man,

1324
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,360
he made me feel
like less than a woman.

1325
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:25,435
What am I gonna do, girl?

1326
00:50:25,436 --> 00:50:27,203
Trina, listen to me.

1327
00:50:27,204 --> 00:50:29,972
You have to believe that
you're going to get better.

1328
00:50:29,973 --> 00:50:32,675
The power of life and death
is in the tongue.

1329
00:50:32,676 --> 00:50:34,143
You have to say it
and you have to believe it.

1330
00:50:34,144 --> 00:50:37,180
You have friends who care
about you and love you.

1331
00:50:37,181 --> 00:50:38,781
I'm just keeping it real.

1332
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:40,516
Oh, really?

1333
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:44,509
That's what my wife said
and now she's gone

1334
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:47,357
because she was
so-called keeping it real.

1335
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:49,125
Your wife passed away
of cancer?

1336
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:50,927
Five years ago.

1337
00:50:50,928 --> 00:50:52,729
And I took care of
her every step of the way

1338
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,263
and I can take care of you.

1339
00:50:54,264 --> 00:50:55,398
You can't help me, Lionel.

1340
00:50:55,399 --> 00:50:57,533
- Yes I can!
- How?

1341
00:50:57,534 --> 00:50:59,235
Clean more sinks?

1342
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:00,269
Wait more tables?

1343
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,704
Yes, yes.

1344
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:04,307
Wash more cars, cut more
grass, get five more jobs.

1345
00:51:04,308 --> 00:51:06,142
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

1346
00:51:06,143 --> 00:51:08,644
That's sweet, Lionel, but
you are not Prince Charming

1347
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:11,147
and this is not a fairy tale,
so I'd really appreciate it

1348
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:12,648
if you'd stop acting like it.

1349
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:14,317
I have cancer...
I'm gonna die.

1350
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:16,352
No, but, no...
You don't know that!

1351
00:51:16,353 --> 00:51:17,387
So what are gonna do, huh?

1352
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:18,588
I'm gonna live.

1353
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:19,622
I'm gonna live like
there's no tomorrow

1354
00:51:19,623 --> 00:51:21,057
'cause there just might not be.

1355
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:22,558
- Trina, that's not the answer.
- Trina, wait.

1356
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,327
Please let me do it.

1357
00:51:24,328 --> 00:51:25,862
Trina!

1358
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:27,852
Trina!

1359
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,229
Hello.

1360
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:41,098
My answer's yes.

1361
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:43,509
Yes, let's do it.

1362
00:51:43,914 --> 00:51:45,903
Do what?

1363
00:51:46,383 --> 00:51:48,284
Get married.

1364
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:49,719
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1365
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,709
We will.

1366
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:53,990
Okay, well, we
can do it tomorrow.

1367
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:55,425
I've been putting things
in perspective

1368
00:51:55,426 --> 00:51:56,692
and I don't want to wait any...

1369
00:51:56,693 --> 00:51:58,728
Slow down, slow down.

1370
00:51:58,729 --> 00:52:00,763
These things need to
be planned out.

1371
00:52:00,764 --> 00:52:02,799
We don't need a
big wedding, Bobby.

1372
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,867
I've already got the ring,
what are we waiting for?

1373
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:06,135
Exactly, right.

1374
00:52:06,136 --> 00:52:08,137
So what's the rush?

1375
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:10,206
Why can't we
just jump into this?

1376
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:13,843
You ever hear the saying
''Look before you leap?''

1377
00:52:13,844 --> 00:52:15,311
What?

1378
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:16,846
Since we last spent time,
I had to make some,

1379
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:18,836
some big decisions.

1380
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:21,350
What are you
talking about, Bobby?

1381
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:23,186
I'm talking about my wife.

1382
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:25,950
Your wife?

1383
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:29,091
Who the hell is she?

1384
00:52:29,092 --> 00:52:30,660
Doesn't matter.

1385
00:52:30,661 --> 00:52:35,164
What matters is I was hurt
and you wouldn't take my calls.

1386
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:37,233
I had to be with somebody.

1387
00:52:37,234 --> 00:52:42,227
How can you ask me to marry you
when you're already married?

1388
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:43,940
When were you
going to tell me that?

1389
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:45,208
When I got divorced.

1390
00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:47,176
Which is when?

1391
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:48,878
I don't know.

1392
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:50,868
You don't know?

1393
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:53,082
It's complicated.

1394
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:56,819
I mean, look, this whole
thing has been like a whirlwind.

1395
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,321
A whirlwind?

1396
00:52:58,322 --> 00:53:01,824
What world were you in
when you were in bed with me?

1397
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:05,394
Wasn't a whirlwind when you
destroyed my relationship.

1398
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:07,029
You weren't in love with him.

1399
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,965
You don't know that!

1400
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:11,234
You might have appreciated
the benefits...

1401
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:13,069
the house,
the cars, the clothes.

1402
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:14,303
That's not why I was with him.

1403
00:53:14,304 --> 00:53:16,965
Then why didn't you stay?

1404
00:53:18,775 --> 00:53:21,544
I thought what we had
was real, Bobby.

1405
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:24,206
You were my first love.

1406
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:27,250
But how could you
do this to me?

1407
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:29,912
- Paisley.
- No, I chose you.

1408
00:53:32,155 --> 00:53:34,144
I chose you.

1409
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:37,326
You mean everything to me.

1410
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:40,318
I could have loved Caleb more.

1411
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:41,597
I could have
given him more of me,

1412
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:43,165
but you're still in my heart.

1413
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:45,497
All right, all right.

1414
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:47,970
Let me make it right, okay?

1415
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:52,372
Every time I'm with her,
I'm thinking about you.

1416
00:53:54,177 --> 00:53:56,166
Then leave her.

1417
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,248
It's not the thing
to do right now.

1418
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,238
And cheating is?

1419
00:54:02,686 --> 00:54:04,820
I told her about us, okay?

1420
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:07,924
About the Porsche, the house
in the hills, the furniture,

1421
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:11,027
the fact that we're
going to get married.

1422
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:13,162
Bobby, why would you
tell her all of that?

1423
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:15,464
I didn't know I was
telling her.

1424
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:18,134
I must have been
talking in my sleep.

1425
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:19,135
You know, or dreaming.

1426
00:54:19,136 --> 00:54:21,797
I think about you 24/7.

1427
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:25,308
She threatened to
take half if I leave her.

1428
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:26,509
Nah.

1429
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:27,977
You can still leave.

1430
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:29,912
And have her take half?

1431
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:32,244
I don't think so.

1432
00:54:32,783 --> 00:54:35,151
If I'd had her sign
a damn prenup,

1433
00:54:35,152 --> 00:54:37,954
I wouldn't be
having these problems.

1434
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:39,155
Look.

1435
00:54:39,156 --> 00:54:40,356
I got my lawyers working on it.

1436
00:54:40,357 --> 00:54:42,758
They'll let me know
what my options are.

1437
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,594
Okay, so what am I supposed
to do while your lawyers

1438
00:54:44,595 --> 00:54:47,256
are working on your options?

1439
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:49,165
Bobby that could take years.

1440
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:50,866
I know.

1441
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:52,868
And I'm going
to take care of you.

1442
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:54,570
You expect me to
spend Christmas

1443
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:57,232
and holidays all by myself?

1444
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:00,910
You want me to sneak
around with you

1445
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:05,114
so that I can lay with you
so you can hold me at night?

1446
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:06,916
I don't want to be some
bitter old person

1447
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:09,118
that's pissed that she
gave her milk away for free.

1448
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:16,422
I may be married to her, but
my heart is always with you.

1449
00:55:17,894 --> 00:55:19,562
You know what... I would
have been better off with Caleb

1450
00:55:19,563 --> 00:55:23,157
'cause at least I wouldn't have
been getting half a man.

1451
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:28,771
I don't believe this.

1452
00:55:28,772 --> 00:55:30,106
- Baby.
- No.

1453
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:32,808
Bed your wife
because I am done.

1454
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:35,299
We're over.

1455
00:55:43,987 --> 00:55:45,521
Where's Dedra?

1456
00:55:45,522 --> 00:55:48,791
Dropping the single off
at the radio station.

1457
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:50,693
You know she's
leaving tomorrow.

1458
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:52,683
Yeah.

1459
00:55:52,829 --> 00:55:54,430
So?

1460
00:55:54,431 --> 00:55:55,831
So what?

1461
00:55:55,832 --> 00:56:00,403
So... you know, you're a
genius when it comes to money

1462
00:56:00,404 --> 00:56:02,505
and an idiot when
it comes to love.

1463
00:56:02,506 --> 00:56:04,040
She's there for
the taking, man.

1464
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:05,541
Who, Dedra?

1465
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:06,509
Yeah... I mean,

1466
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,144
she's not thick
the way I like them,

1467
00:56:08,145 --> 00:56:10,246
but she ain't bad on
the eyes either.

1468
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:12,081
No, it's not that, man.

1469
00:56:12,082 --> 00:56:14,350
I like her just the way
she is, but you know,

1470
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:15,584
we've been
hanging out a lot lately

1471
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:18,688
and to tell you the truth,
she touches me.

1472
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:20,322
She does?

1473
00:56:20,323 --> 00:56:21,957
On the inside, Damon.

1474
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,359
Oh, okay, just asking.

1475
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,261
Just saying, don't leave
a brother out.

1476
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:29,129
- You need therapy.
- I just might.

1477
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:30,966
Hey...
Hey, guys.

1478
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:32,735
Okay, I dropped the song off
at the radio station.

1479
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:34,336
I talked to
the program directors

1480
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:37,273
so I guess all we can do
is just wait and see.

1481
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:38,541
Might as well get started.

1482
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:41,874
There's a radio in
the back, right?

1483
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:45,347
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1484
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:48,484
So are you...
really going to London?

1485
00:56:48,485 --> 00:56:51,954
There's nothing left for me
to stick around for.

1486
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:55,423
What are you talking about?

1487
00:56:56,893 --> 00:57:00,726
There's me.

1488
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:02,898
Why do you want me to stay?

1489
00:57:02,899 --> 00:57:05,501
To, um, take your calls?

1490
00:57:05,502 --> 00:57:07,833
To schedule your appointments?

1491
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:10,227
No... No.

1492
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:13,709
Okay, well, then why, Caleb?

1493
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,244
Why should I stay?

1494
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:17,079
- Dedra...
- You know what, wait.

1495
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,014
Caleb.

1496
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:20,845
Now...

1497
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:25,517
I might not be the trophy girl

1498
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:29,358
and I might not be the
cover girl supermodel

1499
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,020
that you are looking for,

1500
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:36,557
but I'm beautiful just
the way that I am.

1501
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:40,236
Hey, hey.

1502
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:41,704
They just played our song
on the radio, baby!

1503
00:57:41,705 --> 00:57:42,772
Got to be kidding.

1504
00:57:42,773 --> 00:57:44,273
Already...
Why didn't you call us?

1505
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:45,708
I was so excited I
couldn't believe it.

1506
00:57:45,709 --> 00:57:46,876
I gotta call Sway.

1507
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:48,210
I mean, they said if it
was good, they'd play it,

1508
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:49,445
but I didn't think
they meant today.

1509
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:50,813
Hello?

1510
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:51,814
Hey, Sway?

1511
00:57:51,815 --> 00:57:53,415
Hey, it's me, man.

1512
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:54,884
Man, they are playing our
song all over the radio, baby.

1513
00:57:54,885 --> 00:57:57,319
It is the number one requested
song all morning.

1514
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,654
Man, I told you we
was gonna make you a star.

1515
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:01,486
Didn't I tell you...
Didn't I tell you?

1516
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:04,393
Oh, yeah, that's cool, player.

1517
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:05,761
I seen some honeys I want
to celebrate with

1518
00:58:05,762 --> 00:58:08,753
so I'mma get back at you.

1519
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:10,733
Sway's excited!

1520
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:11,834
We gonna blow up, man.

1521
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:13,002
We gonna blow up, girl.

1522
00:58:13,003 --> 00:58:14,303
You did it...
You did it.

1523
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:16,238
I'm gonna tell
Sway to give you some.

1524
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:17,773
Come here, girl.

1525
00:58:17,774 --> 00:58:18,808
Would you stop?

1526
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:20,009
Get off me.

1527
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,177
You're so crazy...
I don't know where you

1528
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:23,167
or Sway...

1529
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:26,604
Oh... okay.

1530
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:30,841
I'm... I'm sorry.

1531
00:58:32,122 --> 00:58:35,181
I didn't mean to do that.

1532
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:39,657
I know you didn't, Caleb.

1533
00:58:40,997 --> 00:58:42,986
Um.

1534
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:45,467
I'm going to go and
finish packing because you know,

1535
00:58:45,468 --> 00:58:48,437
I have some people that are
coming to look at the house.

1536
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:53,374
But, um, I'm happy for you.

1537
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:55,945
Okay.

1538
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:59,210
Dedra, wait.

1539
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:02,681
I need you.

1540
00:59:02,752 --> 00:59:05,583
I love you.

1541
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,079
What?

1542
00:59:09,759 --> 00:59:11,748
You love me?

1543
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:13,896
Yes.

1544
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:15,598
I love you.

1545
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,588
So what?

1546
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:19,468
I've been loving you.

1547
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:21,770
I know...
I know... I'm sorry.

1548
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:26,008
I'm not going to let the woman
I love walk out on me.

1549
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:27,409
If I got to wake
up every morning

1550
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,577
and prove how much I love you,

1551
00:59:28,578 --> 00:59:30,479
I'm not letting you walk out.

1552
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,141
I have always loved you.

1553
00:59:34,017 --> 00:59:38,111
And I need you in my life.

1554
00:59:47,797 --> 00:59:51,267
No, I said we
get to publish it.

1555
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:53,602
Yeah, well, I'll let you think
about it, all right?

1556
00:59:53,603 --> 00:59:55,004
There are plenty
of other companies

1557
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:58,107
who would love to distribute
this for us.

1558
00:59:58,108 --> 01:00:00,009
I thought you would.

1559
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:02,671
All right, let's talk later.

1560
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:05,314
Yeah, like I was saying,
we can take a look at her.

1561
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:07,182
I mean, if she's any good.

1562
01:00:07,183 --> 01:00:10,845
But, uh, our A&R
person gets last say.

1563
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:12,855
That's right.

1564
01:00:12,856 --> 01:00:14,845
Dedra Simmons.

1565
01:00:15,158 --> 01:00:16,825
All right, man.

1566
01:00:16,826 --> 01:00:19,225
Later.

1567
01:00:20,163 --> 01:00:21,664
Told you you'd be a hit.

1568
01:00:21,665 --> 01:00:24,326
I am happy.

1569
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:26,068
How you doing there, boss?

1570
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:27,670
Hey, Lionel.

1571
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:29,004
Hey, listen, there's a package
for you down in the lobby.

1572
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:30,105
You want me to sign for it?

1573
01:00:30,106 --> 01:00:31,340
Yeah, sign for
the package, Lionel.

1574
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:32,441
I'll do that...
I'll do that, boss.

1575
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:33,442
- And Lionel?
- Yes, sir, boss?

1576
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:34,476
Don't call me boss.

1577
01:00:34,477 --> 01:00:35,811
Oh, you know what, boss?

1578
01:00:35,812 --> 01:00:37,680
I'm never going to call
you boss again.

1579
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:39,014
That's the last time I'm ever
going to call you boss, boss.

1580
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:40,616
I'm sorry, Mr. Peterson.

1581
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:43,252
And if you don't
mind me saying so,

1582
01:00:43,253 --> 01:00:45,087
I think ya'll look
good together.

1583
01:00:45,088 --> 01:00:46,488
Well, thank you.

1584
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:47,389
Aw.

1585
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,590
Well, thank you, Lionel.

1586
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:51,388
But... but...

1587
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:53,162
business before pleasure.

1588
01:00:53,163 --> 01:00:54,730
Where you going?

1589
01:00:54,731 --> 01:00:57,232
I gotta follow up
with video shoot location.

1590
01:00:57,233 --> 01:00:59,860
Come here...
What you doing?

1591
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,204
Oh, oh, oh.

1592
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:04,006
You see what I gotta deal with?

1593
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:05,107
Okay.

1594
01:01:05,108 --> 01:01:07,509
See what I gotta deal with?

1595
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:10,312
And you are right, we
cannot shoot in a prison.

1596
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:15,417
But, if, you know, you're good,

1597
01:01:15,418 --> 01:01:17,386
I might let you frisk me later.

1598
01:01:17,387 --> 01:01:18,487
What?

1599
01:01:18,488 --> 01:01:19,855
That's what I'm talking about.

1600
01:01:19,856 --> 01:01:21,090
That's what I'm talking
about right there.

1601
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:22,458
- Lionel?
- Yes, sir.

1602
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:23,625
- That's mine.
- Oh, that is your package.

1603
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:26,061
I'll get the other one for you.

1604
01:01:26,062 --> 01:01:28,859
Crazy.

1605
01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:34,803
Trina, you cannot
be in my video.

1606
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:36,038
Stop asking.

1607
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:38,768
I've been practicing
and everything.

1608
01:01:39,776 --> 01:01:43,336
That's my you
can't handle this face.

1609
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,913
What you doing?

1610
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:46,415
That's my ''you still
can't be in the video'' face.

1611
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:47,783
Damon, come on, please.

1612
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:50,052
You know I'm the right one
for the video.

1613
01:01:50,053 --> 01:01:51,487
Okay, okay...
I'll think about it.

1614
01:01:51,488 --> 01:01:52,888
Ain't promising nothing,
but I'll think about it.

1615
01:01:52,889 --> 01:01:54,456
- All right?
- Okay.

1616
01:01:54,457 --> 01:01:58,160
That's all I asked 'cause
I've been practicing, I'm ready.

1617
01:01:58,161 --> 01:02:00,150
And no.

1618
01:02:00,163 --> 01:02:01,530
What do you mean no?

1619
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:02,598
You just said you
would think about it.

1620
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:04,166
And I thought about it.

1621
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:06,535
Come on, that was too fast.

1622
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:07,870
Who told you I be
doing it too fast?

1623
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,971
Alicia?

1624
01:02:08,972 --> 01:02:10,272
She be lying.

1625
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:12,441
Caleb, Caleb, can
I be in the video?

1626
01:02:12,442 --> 01:02:14,610
That's Damon's department
and, uh, Damon,

1627
01:02:14,611 --> 01:02:16,845
I need the treatment
for the video, please.

1628
01:02:16,846 --> 01:02:20,149
I'm trying to work on, but
Trina keeps harassing me.

1629
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:22,051
You're not even looking.

1630
01:02:22,052 --> 01:02:23,152
- Sway.
- No.

1631
01:02:23,153 --> 01:02:24,153
- Sway.
- Uh-uh.

1632
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:28,453
Look...
I did this in the rodeo thing.

1633
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:30,359
Paisley!

1634
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,527
Where you been, girl?

1635
01:02:31,528 --> 01:02:32,694
I've been trying to call you.

1636
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:33,896
I've been calling and calling.

1637
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:35,197
You look good.

1638
01:02:35,198 --> 01:02:38,359
Hi, Caleb.

1639
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:40,469
Sorry, girl.

1640
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:42,337
I've just been taking
some time off to think.

1641
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:44,640
I heard about, you know, Damon
and Caleb's success.

1642
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,241
I just wanted to
come by and wish them well.

1643
01:02:46,242 --> 01:02:47,376
That was nice of you.

1644
01:02:47,377 --> 01:02:50,277
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

1645
01:02:52,215 --> 01:02:54,204
Congratulations, Caleb.

1646
01:02:54,317 --> 01:02:56,051
You deserve it.

1647
01:02:56,052 --> 01:02:57,486
Thanks.

1648
01:02:57,487 --> 01:03:00,255
People tend to get what
they deserve, Paisley.

1649
01:03:00,256 --> 01:03:03,918
Um, can we talk...
alone for a second?

1650
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,427
- Hell, no.
- Damon.

1651
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:07,429
- Hell no.
- Let's not hear that.

1652
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,660
All right, you watch your back.

1653
01:03:12,802 --> 01:03:15,326
Uh, me too?

1654
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:17,106
All right...
Call me later.

1655
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:18,407
Don't forget.

1656
01:03:18,408 --> 01:03:19,641
Damon, wait for me...
Wait, wait, wait.

1657
01:03:19,642 --> 01:03:22,303
I was just about to show you...

1658
01:03:26,516 --> 01:03:28,383
Look at you.

1659
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:30,385
Back on top,
right where you belong.

1660
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:33,320
Things are looking up.

1661
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:36,525
Caleb, I miss you.

1662
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:37,826
Now, hey, hey, hey, hey...

1663
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:39,194
it's too late for that.

1664
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:40,696
I'm... I don't even know
where to start.

1665
01:03:40,697 --> 01:03:42,831
You don't have to explain
nothing to me, Paisley.

1666
01:03:42,832 --> 01:03:45,823
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1667
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:48,633
It happens sometimes, right?

1668
01:03:49,539 --> 01:03:52,336
Look.

1669
01:03:53,176 --> 01:03:54,376
I've played this moment

1670
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:56,078
a thousand times
in my head, Caleb.

1671
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,581
I know I have no right
to be here.

1672
01:03:59,582 --> 01:04:01,884
I just wanted you to
know that I loved you.

1673
01:04:01,885 --> 01:04:04,216
You left me, Paisley.

1674
01:04:05,588 --> 01:04:10,285
I gave you all I had to
give and you still left.

1675
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:14,196
You made me look like a fool.

1676
01:04:14,197 --> 01:04:16,528
I made a mistake.

1677
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:19,801
Look, Bobby was my first love.

1678
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:22,204
I can't explain what kind
of hold that kind of person

1679
01:04:22,205 --> 01:04:24,536
can put on you.

1680
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:29,011
All I can say is I was stupid.

1681
01:04:29,012 --> 01:04:31,313
I was foolish...
I was confused.

1682
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:33,115
I'm not confused
anymore, Caleb.

1683
01:04:33,116 --> 01:04:35,105
I love you.

1684
01:04:35,118 --> 01:04:37,653
And what we had was special.

1685
01:04:37,654 --> 01:04:39,955
Then you should have
stayed, Paisley.

1686
01:04:39,956 --> 01:04:41,557
You aren't
perfect either, Caleb.

1687
01:04:41,558 --> 01:04:43,525
I never said I was
perfect, Paisley.

1688
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:44,960
No, you just pushed me away.

1689
01:04:44,961 --> 01:04:46,295
Pushed you away?

1690
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:47,596
The lack of trust, the prenup.

1691
01:04:47,597 --> 01:04:50,258
This wasn't about no prenup!

1692
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,932
If you had just
signed the thing,

1693
01:04:54,337 --> 01:04:56,939
I was gonna tear it up.

1694
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,932
I just needed to
know where you heart was.

1695
01:05:01,144 --> 01:05:04,476
My heart's always
been with you, Caleb.

1696
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:08,676
It's always been with you.

1697
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:12,321
Look, I never asked
another man to take me back,

1698
01:05:12,322 --> 01:05:15,313
but please, just forgive
me, okay?

1699
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:20,823
I forgive you, Paisley,
but you had your chance.

1700
01:05:21,831 --> 01:05:23,820
I know.

1701
01:05:24,801 --> 01:05:26,468
And I messed it up.

1702
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:28,737
And if I were you,
I would say no.

1703
01:05:28,738 --> 01:05:32,070
Well, good, because
that's what I'm saying.

1704
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:35,974
But you're not me.

1705
01:05:36,946 --> 01:05:40,608
You're a good man
with a good heart.

1706
01:05:41,851 --> 01:05:43,285
A heart that loved me once.

1707
01:05:43,286 --> 01:05:45,120
Paisley, I don't,
I don't love you anymore.

1708
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:46,688
You do...
You do love me.

1709
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:49,316
No, no, I don't.

1710
01:05:50,226 --> 01:05:52,215
Excuse me?

1711
01:05:52,528 --> 01:05:54,859
Am I interrupting something?

1712
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:57,165
Dedra.

1713
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,567
Paisley, what
are you doing here?

1714
01:05:58,568 --> 01:06:00,902
I was just about to ask
you the same thing.

1715
01:06:00,903 --> 01:06:03,564
- Oh, I'm here...
- With me.

1716
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:07,472
Dedra, Dedra and
I are together now.

1717
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,279
Dedra?

1718
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,647
Caleb, I know you hurt you,

1719
01:06:11,648 --> 01:06:15,017
but you don't have to be
with Dedra to spite me.

1720
01:06:15,018 --> 01:06:18,350
I'm with Dedra
because I love her.

1721
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:21,646
That's nothing to do with you.

1722
01:06:21,691 --> 01:06:23,191
I see.

1723
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:32,157
I wish you and Bobby the best.

1724
01:06:33,002 --> 01:06:34,670
Bobby and I are over.

1725
01:06:34,671 --> 01:06:35,604
No.

1726
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:37,105
It ain't over
till I say it's over.

1727
01:06:37,106 --> 01:06:38,373
You're gonna stop
walking in my house.

1728
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:39,741
I don't believe
I'm talking to you.

1729
01:06:39,742 --> 01:06:41,143
I don't care who you
think you talking to.

1730
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:42,444
- Get the hell out.
- Caleb!

1731
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:43,779
How did you find me?

1732
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,614
Thought I was going
to let you get away?

1733
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:48,650
After the all time and money I
spent building what we have?

1734
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:50,385
I said I didn't belong
to you anymore, Bobby.

1735
01:06:50,386 --> 01:06:53,221
I got $500,000 worth of
receipts that say you do.

1736
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:54,256
Now let's go, Paisley.

1737
01:06:54,257 --> 01:06:55,624
No... I said no.

1738
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,459
Paisley, don't make
me snatch you faster

1739
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,461
than the rapid refund...
Now let's go.

1740
01:06:59,462 --> 01:07:00,962
Hey, there ain't gonna
be no snatching

1741
01:07:00,963 --> 01:07:02,297
while I'm here, partner.

1742
01:07:02,298 --> 01:07:04,697
Is everything cool in here?

1743
01:07:06,803 --> 01:07:08,792
Yeah.

1744
01:07:08,938 --> 01:07:10,405
Everything is cool.

1745
01:07:10,406 --> 01:07:14,500
Bobby was just leaving.

1746
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:26,188
You know, I remember when
ya'll took that shot.

1747
01:07:26,189 --> 01:07:27,322
Yeah.

1748
01:07:27,323 --> 01:07:28,557
That's when it all started.

1749
01:07:28,558 --> 01:07:30,692
Just Us Records was
just a dream.

1750
01:07:30,693 --> 01:07:31,693
Look at it now.

1751
01:07:31,694 --> 01:07:33,428
Yeah, yeah.

1752
01:07:33,429 --> 01:07:37,366
You know, you should
be real proud of yourself.

1753
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:40,699
- Ya'll did some big things.
- Yes, sir.

1754
01:07:42,171 --> 01:07:44,406
Ooh, good Lord, what is this?

1755
01:07:44,407 --> 01:07:45,741
Mmm!

1756
01:07:45,742 --> 01:07:46,942
Baby, you look good.

1757
01:07:46,943 --> 01:07:47,943
You look
better than J-Lo.

1758
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:50,605
You look like Way Low.

1759
01:07:51,948 --> 01:07:53,782
Mmm... Mmm!

1760
01:07:53,783 --> 01:07:55,823
I'm just kidding, ya'll.

1761
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,321
- How do I look, boys?
- Baby, you look amazing.

1762
01:07:59,322 --> 01:08:02,491
You look like some frosting
on a Cinnabun.

1763
01:08:02,492 --> 01:08:05,119
Get a room.

1764
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:08,029
Good.

1765
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:10,365
'Cause I am gonna
tear it up tomorrow on set.'

1766
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:11,500
Yes, I am!

1767
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:12,768
You're tearing it up now.

1768
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:14,169
Tomorrow is Sway's
first music video.

1769
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:15,437
- Don't mess it up.
- Mess it up?

1770
01:08:15,438 --> 01:08:16,738
Baby, I'm gonna turn it up.

1771
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:18,106
I've been
practicing... I've got moves.

1772
01:08:18,107 --> 01:08:20,709
I got eight counts,
I got rolls,

1773
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:22,911
I got pop, pop, pop and drop.

1774
01:08:22,912 --> 01:08:24,546
You got the bounce, baby.

1775
01:08:24,547 --> 01:08:25,814
Don't forget that bounce.

1776
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:27,315
Oh, yeah, I got
the boom, boom, boom.

1777
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:30,079
Boom, boom, boom!

1778
01:08:30,787 --> 01:08:31,887
Did you take
your medication, sweetie?

1779
01:08:31,888 --> 01:08:33,121
Yes, I did, baby.

1780
01:08:33,122 --> 01:08:34,322
Thank you for
loving me so good.

1781
01:08:34,323 --> 01:08:35,791
Okay.

1782
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:38,093
I told you, when I said I was
going to take care of you,

1783
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:39,227
I meant it.

1784
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:40,929
Listen... All those
jobs you've been doing

1785
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:45,923
has been preparing you to put
in some hard work on me.

1786
01:08:46,068 --> 01:08:48,270
I can't take it...
I can't take it.

1787
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:50,839
If Caleb was here, he would
put a stop to this mess.

1788
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,407
Put a stop to what mess?

1789
01:08:52,408 --> 01:08:54,009
Trina and her little
freak show.

1790
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:55,510
Hey, hey, hey, get a room.

1791
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:56,678
Get a room.

1792
01:08:56,679 --> 01:08:57,979
The boss is here!

1793
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,514
Hey, come on, get off me, girl!

1794
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,504
Hey!

1795
01:09:01,584 --> 01:09:02,918
So we all set for
the video tomorrow?

1796
01:09:02,919 --> 01:09:06,149
Yeah, is Sway ready is
the question.

1797
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:08,523
Oh, for sure.

1798
01:09:08,524 --> 01:09:10,513
Sway!

1799
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,694
Look, I'm glad
everybody is here.

1800
01:09:12,695 --> 01:09:15,297
We can head over to the
engagement dinner.

1801
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:16,431
All right, let's go...

1802
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:17,566
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

1803
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:18,733
- The what?
- Engagement?

1804
01:09:18,734 --> 01:09:20,168
What do you mean?

1805
01:09:20,169 --> 01:09:21,403
Dedra.

1806
01:09:21,404 --> 01:09:23,393
Ooh.

1807
01:09:24,106 --> 01:09:25,941
Oh.

1808
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:27,931
Step up.

1809
01:09:29,946 --> 01:09:31,935
I love you...

1810
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:36,274
with every ounce of my soul.

1811
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:41,986
I thought that I needed
a woman to complete me,

1812
01:09:43,893 --> 01:09:47,562
but you taught me that all
I needed was the right woman

1813
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:50,030
to compliment me.

1814
01:09:54,637 --> 01:09:58,663
I don't ever wanna
see a day without you.

1815
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:01,009
Will you be mine forever?

1816
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,577
Really?

1817
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:04,346
This is for real?

1818
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:06,678
This is for real.

1819
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:08,583
Yes.

1820
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:10,252
Aw, she said yes!

1821
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:11,453
I heard her!

1822
01:10:11,454 --> 01:10:12,921
Can't take it back now!

1823
01:10:12,922 --> 01:10:13,922
I wanna see this.

1824
01:10:13,923 --> 01:10:14,990
What ya'll about to do?

1825
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:16,358
Ya'll gotta get a room.

1826
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:17,959
Ya'll gotta save
that for the honeymoon.

1827
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,325
Yeah!

1828
01:11:19,622 --> 01:11:22,112
That was kind of cool, though.

1829
01:11:26,696 --> 01:11:27,963
Ladies and gentlemen,

1830
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:29,698
Just Us Records would
like to showcase

1831
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:34,135
some of our new
talent, so please... reset!

1832
01:11:51,053 --> 01:11:54,189
He's great, he's amazing,
he loves women,

1833
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:55,991
pizza and hot dogs.

1834
01:11:55,992 --> 01:11:58,653
He loves shooting movies and...

1835
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:01,255
everybody, Miguel Nunez,
everybody!

1836
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:05,800
Hello and welcome to
The Sandra Winslow Show.

1837
01:12:05,801 --> 01:12:07,736
I'm your host Sandra Winslow.

1838
01:12:07,737 --> 01:12:09,726
Whoo hoo!

1839
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:12,307
Well, I hope you're ready for
the sizzling questions and...

1840
01:12:12,308 --> 01:12:14,138
Let's start again.

1841
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:21,683
Just pick one.

1842
01:12:21,684 --> 01:12:23,585
And cut!

1843
01:12:23,586 --> 01:12:26,053
Reset it.

1844
01:12:31,193 --> 01:12:32,994
Sway.

1845
01:12:32,995 --> 01:12:34,984
He's Sway!

1846
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:38,793
You Sway!

1847
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:41,803
Hope you got a 600 millimeter
lens on that thing

1848
01:12:41,804 --> 01:12:42,804
so you can see all this.

1849
01:12:42,805 --> 01:12:45,204
Okay.

1850
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,276
I'll make it right.

1851
01:12:48,277 --> 01:12:51,646
Every time I'm with her,
I'm thinking about you.

1852
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:53,381
I don't know
about all that, homie.

1853
01:12:53,382 --> 01:12:55,517
- Don't know about all that.
- And cut.

1854
01:12:55,518 --> 01:12:57,815
- Great job.
- Do it again.
