1
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,500
<i>Tell me again.</i>
<i>Start from…</i>

2
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>I know where to start from.</i>

3
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,300
<i>It was 1961.</i>

4
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,500
<i>And you were a grown up</i>
<i>but you still lived with your parents.</i>

5
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,300
<i>And I worked for a wonderful man</i>
<i>named JFK.</i>

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>And that summer</i>
<i>I took my vacation at Camp Unity.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,800
<i>It was where you went</i>
<i>to get out of the city</i>

8
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,500
<i>if you were young and single</i>
<i>and a registered democrat.</i>

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,700
<i>And there were handsome boys there.</i>

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,500
<i>And one day you and your friends</i>
<i>were playing ping-pong…</i>

11
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,000
<i>Who is telling this story?</i>

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,200
<i>when somebody stole your ping-pong ball,</i>

13
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,200
<i>which you didn't appreciate at all.</i>

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,100
<i>That's right.</i>

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,900
<i>But why did he steal it?</i>

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,700
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>That's not the point.</i>

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,800
<i>The point is</i>
<i>he gave it back.</i>

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,600
What will you give me for it?

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,300
<i>And that might have been</i>
<i>the end of the story.</i>

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,300
<i>But later that night…</i>

21
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,800
<i>I decided to take a walk</i>
<i>by the lake.</i>

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,700
<i>There he was</i>
<i>and he was holding…</i>

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
<i>I love this part.</i>

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,600
<i>…a bouquet of wild flowers.</i>

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
<i>So I introduced myself.</i>

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,400
And that is the story
of how your mommy and daddy met.

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,400
I love that story.

28
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,500
And someday when you're all grown up
you'll meet someone too.

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,300
I know. I have it all planned.

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,800
Don't lie to me.
I know you've been drinking.

31
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm this close
to a recording contract.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,900
And I'm Conny Stevens.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,200
Just this one loop.
That's all I need.

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,900
We can't afford a piano, Vince.

35
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,000
You're living
in a dream world.

36
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,500
I didn't say
"buy a piano", did I?

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,900
I didn't use
those exact words.

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,500
If you want to be a failure
all your life go ahead.

39
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,900
Mom, dad, look.

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
He should have drew the poor house
'cause that's where you're gonna put us.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,300
Great.

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,200
Don't forget to brush, Nicholas.

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,500
It's gonna be okay, pal.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,700
I don't hear practicing.

45
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,600
Tell me again about the piano.

46
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,100
Well.

47
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,200
This was not __ piano.

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,560
This belonged to your grandma Lina.

49
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,700
Hand-carved by a man named
Faustus Daukintis.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,700
And they loved each other very much,
more than life itself.

51
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,960
Life itself?

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But their parents disapproved because…

53
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,860
Because he wasn't Jewish.

54
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,960
Can I finish a sentence?

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,460
Then some very bad people
invaded Lithuania, called Nazis.

56
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,860
That's right. So Faustus Daukintis
bribed an official

57
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,260
so that he could get passage for
your grandmother in a boat bound for America

58
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,800
along with this piano.

59
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,900
And he told her that he would meet up
with her later in New York City

60
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,600
but she never saw him again.

61
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,400
Never again did she played that piano.

62
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,400
"One Big Happy Family".

63
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,700
See? This man has 3 daughters
and he marries this lady

64
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,500
who has 3 sons
and a sheep dog.

65
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,500
And they form
this rock'n'roll band,

66
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,100
even the dog.

67
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,000
we had to do something.

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,100
Miss Muff is really groovy
even if she is an old lady.

69
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,700
I know, Taffy. But telling lies,
even white ones, isn't groovy.

70
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,600
I hope you have learned something
from all this.

71
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,100
We have, Dad.
And we're really sorry.

72
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,900
That's Taffy.
She always says "right, Stinky".

73
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,600
Right, Stinky?

74
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,900
Don't let him
stay up all night.

75
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,000
Nicholas Dockin
where is your pass?

76
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,700
I need the teacher!

77
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,100
You're dead meat, Dockin.

78
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,500
<i>His name was Johnny Hassenschmidt.</i>

79
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,300
<i>He was the first boy I met</i>
<i>after moving to Los Angeles.</i>

80
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,100
He'd probably be my boyfriend now
if my dumb parents hadn't forced me
into private school.

81
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,400
But if they hadn't
we wouldn't even know each other.

82
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,500
Let's play "someday".

83
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,400
You first.

84
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,700
Someday I'll have contacts.

85
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,600
Someday we'll be grownups.

86
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,800
Someday someone will love me
more than life itself.

87
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,100
Someday my whole life will be
completely different.

88
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,300
Except…

89
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,000
We'll still be friends.

90
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Forget that guy from 2nd grade.

91
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,600
There could be somebody out there
that's perfect for you.

92
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,300
Someone you don't even know yet.

93
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,700
I think I really learned
something from all this.

94
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,200
Right, Stinky?

95
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,800
<i>All my life I pictured it.</i>

96
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,400
<i>Falling in love.</i>
<i>Night after night</i>
<i>I pondered my destiny.</i>

97
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,700
<i>I couldn't wait</i>
<i>for the story of my life to happen.</i>

98
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,800
<i>I knew it would happen.</i>

99
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,600
<i>It was just a question of where,</i>
<i>when and how, and how soon.</i>

100
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,800
<i>But I knew for certain that</i>
<i>once I found him, everything</i>
<i>would fall into place.</i>

101
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,800
<i>My search for a major?? </i>
<i>proved frustrating.</i>

102
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,800
<i>So I entered grad school</i>

103
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,500
<i>and waited for that</i>
<i>piercing moment of revelation.</i>

104
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,500
<i>I guess the truth is</i>
<i>nobody had come along</i>

105
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,400
<i>who could actually live</i>
<i>after my expectations.</i>

106
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,400
<i>Nobody was "him",</i>
<i>till you.</i>

107
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,100
Everything in my life
has led up to this moment.

108
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,900
Oh, hasten not this loving act

109
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,800
Rapture where self and not-self meet

110
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,000
My life has been the awaiting you
Your footfall was my own heart's beat.

111
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,100
That's beautiful!

112
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,000
Nick, you have
a real problem at intimacy.

113
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,700
Can I leave now?

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,300
Can you take 2 minutes
to converse with me?

115
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,000
Of course, you always manage to squeeze
intercourse into you busy schedule.

116
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,000
What can I say,
you make the time.

117
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,100
You have no romance in your soul.

118
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,100
You are incapable
of giving and receiving love.

119
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,800
By pursuing architecture,
you're merely constructing this symbolic wall

120
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,700
to separate yourself
from the rest of humanity.

121
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,300
Well, you snore.

122
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,700
None of this is surprising,
giving your __ childhood.

123
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,500
At the age of 3 to witness
your own father

124
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,400
trampled to death
at a fox hunt.

125
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,860
I think I should tell…

126
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,700
And then that mother of yours
shipping you to some
snotty Swiss boarding school.

127
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,700
We have to talk.

128
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,200
Please, don't smoke.

129
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,100
I have my final presentation
in 11 hours.

130
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,800
I have so much work into this model. __
Timon Heldenfeld will be judging my work.

131
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Everything in my life has led up
to this moment.

132
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,200
You know, this whole
tragic-slash-romantic mythology

133
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,600
you cling to is
just a kind of addiction

134
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,700
which our sick culture
encourages.

135
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,400
I'm quitting.
After this semester.

136
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,400
Just write something.
The semester is almost over.

137
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,400
You'd better get going.

138
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,300
He wanted me to spend the night,
I could see it in his eyes.

139
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,300
He is so protective.

140
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,500
Oh, sure.

141
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,000
All I have to eat today
is this fallafel.

142
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
-Oh, look!
-What?

143
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,300
There's Dean.

144
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,300
Don't say "hi", don't wave.
He might not see us.

145
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,500
Poor Dean.
He really likes you.

146
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,300
Oh, did I tell you!

147
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Gregory is considering a job
at N.Y. __ 

148
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,700
Can you imagine it?
Gregory and I in New York City.

149
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,100
Your parents said you could stay
at their guest house after grad school

150
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,000
as long as you wanted.

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,100
I'd rather die than live
in their guests house.

152
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,800
New York could change everything.

153
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,500
I could write poetry.
Gregory and I…

154
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,300
Gregory's essays!

155
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,000
This has nothing to do with my life.

156
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,500
It's not a political statement,
it is a roof garden.

157
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,600
You put a roof garden
on a homeless shelter.

158
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,900
I thought the kids
should have some place…

159
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,200
I am just asking
what is the source.

160
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,100
There is no source.

161
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,900
The choices we make
are determined by who we are.

162
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,300
I am not saying that it's good.
I realize that it's crap.

163
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,200
Is that what you want me to say?
Okay, it's crap!

164
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,200
<i>was apprehended today</i>
<i>for the possession of cocaine.</i>

165
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,500
<i>Francesca Lanfield,</i>

<i>In other news, president Bush…</i>

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,000
Mr. Daukin

170
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,300
Made a fool of myself back there, didn't I?

171
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,300
Yes.

172
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,000
I know what it's like.

173
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,400
You're Sophia Monroe.

174
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,600
When I see a building of yours

175
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,300
this feeling comes over me…

176
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,100
It's hard to explain.

177
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:48,600
I never really believed
I could amount too much until you.

178
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,100
I know what it's like.
The feeling that you just

179
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,600
never belong,
never be good enough.

180
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,500
I'm an architect.
We pay attention to how things are made.

181
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,100
Shit.

182
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,500
You idiot!

183
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,600
Your stupid little building
nearly killed me!

184
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,800
I know a lot of you
brought in work today,
so who would like to begin.

185
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
I have a poem
I'd like to read.

186
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,900
It's here somewhere.
I know.

187
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,700
Does anyone else
have a poem today?

188
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Kevin?

189
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,700
Gravity.

190
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,400
Come in.
I've been expecting you.

191
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,700
There is a knock on the door

192
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:05,200
and love walks through
and lights the fire.

193
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
Smiles.

194
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,000
Smile? Still, love,
we are going to stay a while.

195
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
And the fire breathes
and reads its spell.

196
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,700
But then love runs out
of lies to tell.

197
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,500
For love is restless.

198
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,800
Love is a flirt

199
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,200
Love has places to go.

200
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,700
And people to hurt.

201
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,700
so here is the shovel
to smother the flame

202
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,300
tomorrow you'll barely
remember my name.

203
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
And I'll try to forget you
my dearest one,

204
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,600
as a prisoner tries
to forget the sun

205
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,500
for life holds
no curtness,

206
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,000
Love holds no charms

207
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Since I beheld you

208
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,400
in another's arms

209
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,800
<i>I thought I had learned</i>
<i>all I could in a classroom situation</i>

210
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,500
so I left college.

211
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,900
That makes sense,
you moved on.

212
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,000
How did you get into
ghost writing?

213
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,000
From a friend of a friend
I knew this doctor,

214
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,200
so next thing I know
I'm writing "Hi, I'm your __ "

215
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,400
Read it, you'll love __ 

216
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,700
Then I did this diet and exercise book,
"Eat less, move around more"…

217
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,300
Let me just guess.
You're tired, sick.

218
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,900
Tired of ghosting,
you're busting to write
something of your own.

219
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,400
I like other people stories,
they're safer.

220
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,700
I don't expect what I write
to change anybody's life.

221
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,600
Could I ask you a huge favor?

222
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,300
Could I possibly smoke
one cigarette?

223
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,700
Sure.

224
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,700
Let me just…
Hold on one sec.

225
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,300
Actually, I'll have one with you.

226
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,100
I basically quit but…

227
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,400
Me too, basically.
Nobody smokes anymore.

228
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,800
There is one thing that
I shouldn't mention.

229
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,300
Do you want me to help you
with that?

230
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,600
I do this all the time.

231
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Thank you.

232
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,100
Were was I?

233
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
-Oh, yes! Francesca!
-Yes.

234
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,300
Francesca will not go with an
"as told to". She wants sold crat __ 

235
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,300
I never put my name
on anything I write.

236
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,800
That way nobody gets hurt.

237
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,600
I think you are
the perfect person…

238
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,200
To tell her story.

239
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,600
I loved her as Taffy and…

240
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,900
One Big Happy Family.

241
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,500
Yes.
Everybody loves Taffy.

242
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,800
What in the hell
is keeping her, anyway.

243
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I know she had some
business thing.

244
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,400
Misty, try Francesca's purse.

245
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,660
This is awful but
I actually thought she was…

246
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,900
Dead. I know.
She gets that a lot.

247
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,300
I have Francesca on hold for you.

248
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Hello.

249
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,300
Do you remember those two
developers I told you about,
Murdstone and Heep,

250
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,300
Where are you?

251
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,200
…who can't build their condominium
if I won't sell them my building?

252
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,800
They've got me at some
architectural place.

253
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,400
and they're petrified.

254
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,800
It's highly enjoyable.

255
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,700
The book means everything to me
but this is business.

256
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,560
I can't believe it.
I thought she was…

257
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,400
Dead. I know.
What is she doing here?

258
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,300
She owns "La Fortuna".

259
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,800
What's "La Fortuna"?

260
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,600
The small 18-unit courtyard building
Murdstone Heep must acquire

261
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,500
in order to start construction of
the much anticipated Murdstone Heep complex.

262
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,600
He's got to see this.

263
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,500
Timor,
What can I say?

264
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,200
I shouldn't have done it.
I shouldn't have gone
behind your back.

265
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,100
Everyone moonlights nowadays.

266
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,900
Oh, yeah.

267
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,500
And this is your apology?

268
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,900
I never thought they would get
this kind of publicity.

269
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,700
I know how you love the __ 

270
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,300
So you go behind my back
and you design "The awful truth".

271
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,960
I know it is a stupid name
for a restaurant.

272
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,960
The watering hall "du jour".

273
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,800
So tell me,
are you pleased with your work?

274
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,600
Yeah. Kind of.
Not completely.

275
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,500
Among those spotted at the __
Icecube?

276
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,700
What can I say?

277
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Enough.

278
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,860
I have to go now and meet
Murdstone and Heep,

279
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,700
and this woman
with cold feet.

280
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,300
That is important for the business.

281
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,000
So am I not gonna be considered
to design Murdstone Heep?

282
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,200
That's my punishment?

283
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,800
It's not a question
of punishment.

284
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,300
And no, you're not.

285
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,600
At least let me sit
in our meeting.

286
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,460
Come on.

287
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,800
Just seat there,
don't say anything.

288
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,600
I'll just seat there.
I promise.

289
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,100
I don't know.
Maybe.

290
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,000
That's her?
That is the holdout?

291
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,800
Right, Stinky?

292
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,700
Unbelievable.

293
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,300
She looks so much like
she looked in the cheerleader episode.

294
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,100
I remember the pompoms.

295
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,900
-Tell her you're a fan.
-Oh, come on.

296
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,000
17 thousand?

297
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Yes, fine, I'll have dinner
with both you and her tonight.

298
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,600
Bob, I don't care
what you're wearing.

299
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,300
That was my lawyer.

300
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,060
He goes
"Francesca, why can't you sell?"

301
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,200
And I'm like
"You know what that neighborhood
means to me"

302
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,400
"I grew up in that neighborhood"

303
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,100
Don't people live there or something?
Think of them.

304
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,000
And he says:
"You can still change your mind
because that letter of intent isn't

305
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,100
legally binding"

306
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,000
So I guess I'm changing it.

307
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,800
-Hi.
-Hi.

308
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,100
What your layer doesn't know
is that you'd be a partner.

309
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,100
We want you to have full participation
because that's what you deserve.

310
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,500
We wish to address your concerns
but Mr. Dockin is not authorized to…

311
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,900
What?

312
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,100
We're gonna have to pick
another restaurant

313
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,300
because we're never going
to get into the awful truth.

314
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,400
He can get you in.

315
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,900
I sort of designed it.

316
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,500
Get out of here!

317
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,200
No, I stepped my foot.
I'll see you at 8.

318
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,300
You must be so fucking proud!
Don't you just love the way
it turned out?

319
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,500
I'll sell.
On the condition that I make
full partner like he stated

320
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,800
and the further condition that
he designs it.

321
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,100
I shouldn't have done that.

322
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,900
Were you serious
about me designing?

323
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,700
I enjoy bending people to my will.
Sue me.

324
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,300
I just felt like helping you.

325
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,900
But I guess nobody is allowed
to do that.

326
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,500
cause you don't need anything
from anybody.

327
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,800
Am I warm?

328
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,300
The story of your life.

329
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,100
Tell me the story.

330
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,200
Start at the beginning.

331
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,200
Maybe this is the beginning.

332
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,900
We've got a deal.

333
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,360
I know you think
I'm not ready to…

334
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,600
I know you're not.

335
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,700
Once you start down this road
there's no turning back.

336
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,500
I don't want to.

337
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,300
Woooooooooaaaah!

338
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,300
I'm sorry!

339
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,800
Hi.

340
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,700
I'm meeting…

341
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,700
There you are.

342
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,300
I'm meeting Francesca Lanfield.

343
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,800
Is this place finished?

344
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,200
Follow me.

345
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,100
I see.

346
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,900
Hi.

347
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,600
Isn't this something?

348
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,400
I love it here.

349
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,700
Francesca saw Icecube here.

350
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,500
Unfortunately she won't be joining us.

351
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,800
Some food poisoning thing.

352
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,100
I didn't get all the details.

353
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,700
How did you come
to represent Francesca?

354
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,000
That's a long story.

355
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,900
You don't have to tell it.

356
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,300
I just had something in my eyes.

357
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm sorry.

358
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,200
Are you all right?

359
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,400
This table just keeps stabbing me.

360
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,200
Francesca and I were involved.

361
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,800
I have moved on.

362
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,100
I have.

363
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,100
That's great.

364
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,800
Do you know where the ladies room is?

365
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,100
No? Okay.

366
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,000
Nick, I don't know what to say.

367
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,200
Do you want me to come over?

368
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,500
No, I need to be by myself
for a while.

369
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,400
You know how it is.

370
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,300
One minute your father is alive
and the next minute…

371
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,100
I begged him not to fly.

372
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,200
I've got to go.

373
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,100
What was that?

374
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,200
Just a business thing.
I've rescheduled.

375
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,700
-And you had a dinner thing?
-I canceled.

376
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,500
How long have you lived here?

377
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,600
2 and half years.

378
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,300
You should unpack.

379
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,800
This is just temporary.

380
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,200
Like insanity?

381
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,300
I plan to design my own place
in the near future.

382
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,100
This is kind of a layover.

383
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,300
I get it.

384
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,600
You can't unpack 'cause that would mean
you really live here.

385
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,000
Which you don't.

386
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,200
You
too good for you.

387
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,500
Who are you to deserve
some place perfect?

388
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,800
even unpack.

389
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,200
I never went to college.

390
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,100
This place does need something.
Needs a piano.

391
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,199
I'd buy you a piano tomorrow
and you'd hate it.

392
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:20,000
You would buy me a piano?

393
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,400
No, I'm saying I wouldn't.

394
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,600
Cause you'd prefer to dream
of some future piano
to a piano in actuality.

395
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,300
I used to be the same way.

396
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,300
I just sold a whole building.

397
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,699
It feels highly enjoyable.

398
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,000
"La Fortuna" was my shelter
as in money.

399
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,199
I was 18.

400
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,400
I was full time
at Crystal Meth University.

401
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,900
God, I love methamphetamines,
more than life itself.

402
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,600
My business manager
was scared I go through my whole savings.

403
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,100
So we bought it.

404
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,300
Saved my life.

405
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,300
You never grew up there?

406
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,700
Please. Never even seen it.

407
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,500
Speaking of things
you've never seen,

408
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,900
where's the bedroom?

409
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,100
You're not shy, are you?

410
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,700
My tits developed
at national television.

411
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,700
Shy __ 

412
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,200
I'm sorry.
They developed where?

413
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,900
While I was doing the show.

414
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,900
What show is that?

415
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,700
Get out of here.

416
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,000
You seriously don't know
what I'm talking about?

417
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,600
You never watched the
One Big Happy Family.

418
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,300
"One Big Happy Family"?
No. You see,

419
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,100
we weren't permitted to watch television
when I was a kid so…

420
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,000
What do you want?

421
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,100
You want me to be shy?

422
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,700
Just be yourself.

423
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,200
-Brief encounter is on.
-Really?

424
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,500
Come on over,
we'll watch it together.

425
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
Come on,
we never see anymore.

426
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,900
Okay.

427
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,600
-Where did your mother hide that __ 
-Oh, daddy.

428
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,300
<i>You're not angry with me,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

429
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,800
<i>No, I'm not angry.</i>

430
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
<i>Forgive me.</i>

431
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,500
<i>Forgive you for what?</i>

432
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,000
<i>For everything.</i>

433
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,500
<i>For meeting you in the first place.</i>

434
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,200
<i>for taking the piece</i>
<i>of grit out of your eye.</i>

435
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,300
<i>For loving you.</i>
<i>For bringing you so much misery.</i>

436
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,900
Oh, God,
I am so lonely.

437
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,300
I can't live like this anymore.

438
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,200
I'm sorry.

439
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,600
I had a peculiar evening.

440
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,000
I had dinner with this guy, Bob.

441
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
He's a perfectly decent guy.

442
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,200
He's somewhat obsessed with his
last girlfriend but

443
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
otherwise…

444
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,900
Gwen, sweetheart, come here.

445
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,000
Why haven't I found someone?

446
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,700
Am I so misshapen?

447
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,000
So repellent?

448
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,900
Why can't it just happen
like it did with you and mom?

449
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,600
Sweetheart, I'm going to tell you
something very important.

450
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,900
Tell me, please.

451
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,900
I never loved your mother.

452
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,000
What?

453
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,400
Never.

454
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,800
I mean, not real love.

455
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,800
What?

456
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,400
What are you talking about?

457
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,300
when you're talking about.
When you're searching for.

458
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,500
I will find someone.

459
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,000
You have someone.
She's upstairs.

460
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,500
She gave birth to me.

461
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,900
Many times, I can't tell you
how many times, I thought

462
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,000
I'll wait it out,
maybe she'll die.

463
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,300
You've been waiting
for my mother to die?

464
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,360
Not really but…

465
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,500
Yeah, that's true,
finally I can say it.

466
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,900
No, you can't.

467
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,800
I thought you would understand,
you of all people.

468
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
This is very unsatisfying.

469
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,800
I wanted something chewy,
I got something kecky.

470
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,200
Under the sink,
behind the __ 

471
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,900
Are you serious?

472
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,100
Wait.

473
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,000
How can you say you never loved…

474
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,100
What about the story?

475
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,500
The night you met.

476
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,300
What about the flowers?

477
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,900
You went down to the lake
to find her

478
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,500
and you picked her flowers.

479
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,700
-I did?
-Yes!

480
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,000
No.

481
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,100
I remember.

482
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,700
I had a date with a girl
I was just nuts about.

483
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,200
What the hell was her name?

484
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,900
Anyway, she stood me out,
and then I run into your mother.

485
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,400
She made a big deal.
She thinks I picked the flowers for her.

486
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,200
What am I gonna do,
argue with her?

487
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,000
You can't argue with her.

488
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:49,000
So you married her
and lived with her for 35 years

489
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,800
to avoid an argument?

490
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,700
Josie. Her name was Josie.

491
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,200
Damn it!

492
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,300
I'm sorry. I just…

493
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,900
I learned something
rather disturbing last night.

494
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,600
You know how that is when something
just shakes you to the core?

495
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,700
No.

496
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,900
Great.

497
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,300
Where were we?

498
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:49,900
Last night I had the most
highly enjoyable sex possible.

499
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,700
This is __ 

500
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,300
I know. The lack of closet space
is really disheartening.

501
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,500
It's not the closet space.

502
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,100
My parents are getting a divorce.

503
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,500
I'm losing you.

504
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,800
What do you mean see other people?

505
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,400
Nick, I'm losing you.

506
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,000
Jesus Christ!

507
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,700
-I'm so sorry.
-It wasn't your fault.

508
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,400
She's British so
maybe they're most legal over there.?? 

509
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,600
Gwen. I don't believe this.

510
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,300
Kevin Helper from poetry class.

511
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,000
-I'm so sorry.
-No, it wasn't your fault.

512
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,400
Are you all right?

513
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,500
I'm having trouble
getting started on this book but…

514
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,900
Oh, you mean am I injured.
No, no.

515
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,600
We should exchange
insurance information.

516
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,900
Yes.

517
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,500
How are you?

518
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,900
I'm great.

519
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,300
And change is good.
Change is healthy.

520
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:51,200
We have to keep moving
or just slid our turds?? 
and slowly bleed to death.

521
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,400
And yourself?

522
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,500
I teach high school now.

523
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,000
Do you live around here?

524
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,900
No. My friend Patrick does.

525
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,800
Did.

526
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I don't need that.

527
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,200
-Bye.
-Bye.

528
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:38,000
Maybe sorting through a dead guy's possessions
would brighten your day.

529
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,300
Yeah.

530
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,000
Gweenie! Hi!

531
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,400
Happy thanksgiving.

532
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,100
Happy thanksgiving.

533
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,800
I can't believe I'm seeing you.

534
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,900
Thank you.

535
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,400
Well, you're busy.

536
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,300
How is Dean in the car?

537
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,200
I don't know.
He just likes to sit there
sometimes.

538
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,600
Says the music sounds better in there.
I don't know.

539
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,300
 __ are you?

540
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,400
 __ don't fight.
They just listen you to death.

541
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,100
I cannot believe you met Taffy.
I thought she was dead.

542
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:01,500
Just a drug addict for a while.

543
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,800
Chelsea! Love of my life.

544
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,900
Come here.

545
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,200
God, you're grown!

546
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,900
It's a nightmare.

547
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,000
They're happy.

548
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,300
And get this:

549
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,600
my mother is videodating.

550
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,360
Isn't that mentioned in the Bible
as one of the signs

551
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,000
that the world
is coming to an end?

552
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,000
She keeps
foisting applications on me.

553
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,800
Maybe that would be fun.
You don't know.

554
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,800
-Debbie
-What?

555
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,500
That's not the plan.

556
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,900
The plan is find
some temporary shelter

557
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:57,360
and finish the Taffy book
and then get out of L.A.

558
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,300
because —let's face it—
I belong in New York.

559
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,900
When will you stop with that
whole New York thing?

560
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,700
Are you okay?

561
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,400
I'm the surgeon,
I cut people!

562
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,200
You didn't need to do this.

563
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,400
He didn't.
I did most of it.

564
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,800
Your cat is trying
to get in.

565
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,000
I don't have a cat.

566
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,300
It's trembling.

567
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,160
This is not my cat.

568
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,300
Do you have any tuna?

569
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,600
I can't have a cat.

570
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,600
A woman living alone
with a cat is…

571
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,600
That's when you have 3 cats.

572
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,600
Definitely don't do
the three-cat thing.

573
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,900
I don't like cats,
of any quantity.

574
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,300
A very lovely little piano.

575
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,000
It was my grandmother's.

576
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,500
It's hand-carved by a man
named Faustus Daukintis.

577
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,000
They were in love but
it just wasn't meant to be.

578
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,600
She dumped him.

579
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,000
I played professionally at one time.

580
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,100
Which, of course, led to my career
in motion pictures.

581
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,300
If you need some cat food
I have plenty.

582
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,600
My cat eats like a Jew.

583
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,100
Excuse me?

584
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:29,300
All I know is the dearest man
in the world to me is a Jewish man…

585
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,200
That isn't even an expression.

586
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,200
Someone __ kitchen boxes
in the bedroom.

587
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,400
It's me, Glane.

588
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,900
Hi, Lane.

589
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,900
No, with a "ga", Glane.

590
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,700
Me and the band are throwing some
 __ 

591
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,800
Thank you.
That would be lovely.

592
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,900
I'm afraid I have a previous
engagement.

593
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,200
My limousine should be here __ 

594
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,500
Francesca hates cats.

595
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,800
You should feed your cat,
she's skinny.

596
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,600
Introduce me to your darling husband.

597
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,700
He's not my husband.

598
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,200
I'm not married.

599
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,000
A sweet girl like you?
Why aren't you married?

600
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,200
You're not serious.

601
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,700
Being married is not
necessarily the answer.

602
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,200
My parents __ 

603
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,400
Mime too.

604
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,600
Small world.

605
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:46,600
I just will never understand
by a darling girl…

606
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,900
It's the end of the 20th century
and we've reached this point

607
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,500
where people are frightened,
they're full of fright.

608
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,700
And besides, I was too young
to get married. For years.

609
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,700
And I went directly
from too-young to

610
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,600
"why aren't you married,
what's wrong with you"

611
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:09,100
There were those 10 minutes
in 1992 when I was exactly

612
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,500
the right age and weight
to be married but I've…

613
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,700
Forgot to set the alarm clock
and I

614
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,600
slept right through it.

615
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,000
The piano is out of tune.

616
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,100
I've never married either.

617
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I suppose because nobody
ever asked me.

618
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,400
That's the other reason.

619
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:42,600
I met Irving when I was 21
but mother didn't approve of him.

620
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:48,900
And then he married someone else.

621
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,300
But I have never stopped
loving him.

622
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,000
I love him to this day.

623
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,800
What's going on here?
What's happening?

624
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,900
You said I could bring
some of my stuff over.

625
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:14,300
I meant
little personal cotton things.

626
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,200
Table goes here.

627
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,500
Hold it.

628
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,900
I'm putting my piano here.

629
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,400
You don't have a piano.

630
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,400
But I plan to acquire one
and I plan to put it here.

631
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,200
When?

632
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,600
In the near future.

633
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,200
You just don't run out
and buy a piano.

634
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,500
You have to browse and compare
and shop and…

635
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,400
It sounds like a plan.

636
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,000
Nick, I am here
almost every night.

637
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,000
I know but this is…

638
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
You're moving in.

639
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,800
I'm not moving in.

640
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,800
These guys are movers.

641
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,700
-Are you guys movers?
-We're movers.

642
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,700
What's that supposed to mean?

643
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,000
I need a surface.

644
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:09,300
To go throughout my scrapbox
for the book?? 

645
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,600
write poetry

646
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,500
You write poetry?

647
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,800
I write all kinds of shit.

648
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,900
Just the other day
I wrote a great poem.

649
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,300
It was all about you.

650
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,900
Really?

651
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,960
You work hard at your blueprints
from morning till night

652
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,500
and hopefully we'll shack up
without one major fight

653
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:59,400
you like deconstructionism,
the new, not the old,

654
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,100
and you're great with a blowtorch
Or so I've been told

655
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,700
You're good with the clients
and also with sex

656
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:14,100
which is why you're the greatest
of all architects

657
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,000
That is something
that I would love to be able to do.

658
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,600
Actually someone tried to teach me.

659
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,100
But I could never…

660
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,500
so whatever I made
I just never ended

661
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,000
so I gave up.

662
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,900
That hat doesn't suit you.

663
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,400
You need something with a brim.

664
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,000
You should do something
about that stube.

665
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,400
Flowers or a bench.

666
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,500
Everyone here has done
something with their stube.

667
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,900
Right, Cinders?

668
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,860
What is this?

669
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,500
That's the song
they were playing on the radio

670
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:10,500
the first time
Irving kissed me.

671
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,900
Excuse me.

672
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,600
This sucks!

673
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,200
The development corporation
of Murdstone and Heep…

674
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,200
It's a total conspiracy,
like a JFK movie.

675
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,700
I can't believe this.

676
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:38,300
My boyfriend moves to Utah,
my restaurant gets condemned
and now this?

677
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,800
What does this mean?

678
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,000
I don't understand.

679
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,900
Some kind of hearing thing.
To challenge the eviction.

680
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,300
Hearing tomorrow night
at the high school.

681
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,200
I think we'd better go.

682
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:10,500
I wish I could go.
I'm just so behind on my book.

683
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,900
But you let me know what happens.

684
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,400
You do that for me?
Let me know what happens?

685
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,500
Sure. Whatever.

686
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,100
Gwen.

687
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,700
This is nice.
this is fun.

688
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,700
Seeing each other. But

689
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,200
there's something
that I have to say.

690
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,300
I know I'm behind in the book.

691
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,100
It's taking me a while
to find an approach. I promise you…

692
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,100
I think we should go to Paris.

693
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,200
Excuse me?

694
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,100
I think we need it.

695
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,700
We'll be surrounded by rude
French people.

696
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,400
It will bring us closer.

697
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,900
Gwen, will you look at this?
Is this funny?

698
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,700
Am I laughing?

699
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
You must be Bob.

700
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,500
I'm Beebee, I'm Gwen's mother.

701
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,400
You're kidding me!

702
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,000
We were on our way
to the __ .

703
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,000
This is Paul Pullman

704
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,700
Sit, please.

705
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,600
Paul and I were matched up together
to the video dating service.

706
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,700
It turns out —can you believe this—
Paul was at Brookman College

707
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,200
all 4 years I was there,
our paths never crossed.

708
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,300
Never crossed.

709
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,600
So, Bob, how was __ 

710
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:13,300
I've just asked Gwen
to go to Paris with me.

711
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,700
Bob, we're not going to Paris.

712
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,000
Of course you should go.
We should all go.

713
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,800
I've never been to Paris.

714
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,200
Oh, you would love it!

715
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,700
Maybe we could swim
to the wine country.

716
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,500
Okay, that's it.

717
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,500
I'm sorry.

718
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:41,300
It's really nice meeting you
in this very surreal kind of way.

719
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,900
Excuse me.

720
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,800
Do you know where Timo Heldenfeld
is right now? Shanghai.

721
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,900
This is extremely non-enjoyable.

722
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,300
Do you mind?
Some of us are trying to listen.

723
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,600
Ever have sex in a parking lot?

724
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,300
Thank you, Mr. Babcock.

725
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:39,400
And now we will open up
to members of the community.

726
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,500
Just a minute.
I wanna say something.

727
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,400
My name is Katz.

728
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:55,600
I'm leaving in La Fortuna
46 years.

729
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,900
Did I say 46?
Here, 47 years.

730
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,100
I moved in in 1948.

731
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,300
I'm 80 years…
81 years old.

732
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,900
Mr. Cats, if you could…

733
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,400
Mr Cats, if you please sit down.

734
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,800
Someone help Mr. Cats.

735
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,500
Are there any other comments
from the floor?

736
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,000
Hello. Testing.

737
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,000
Your name, please?

738
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,500
Miss Harriet May Kinney.

739
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,500
But I don't use the "May".

740
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,400
Irving said "loose the may"
and I did.

741
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:47,000
If you would limit your remarks,
Miss Kinney, to those concerned
with the building.

742
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,400
Certainly I'm concerned,
I live there.

743
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,300
I've lived there
since 1936.

744
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,500
I know everyone of my neighbors.

745
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,400
It's the courtyard with
the fountain, with the gold fish.

746
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,600
One of them passed away recently.

747
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,700
One of the neighbors,
the gold fish are thriving.

748
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,200
Oh, the parties we'd have.

749
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,200
Paper lanterns…

750
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:28,200
Ernst Lubitsch would come.
Louis Brooks and…

751
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:33,600
All I know is
I just can't sit home every night, mother.

752
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,700
This isn't Omaha.

753
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,900
Who is Louise Brooks?

754
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,200
She was a silent movie star
but that's not the point.

755
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,500
It isn't?

756
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,600
Excuse me, miss?

757
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,800
The point is legendary people
lived in La Fortuna.

758
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,700
That to destroy it
would be to eradicate

759
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:10,400
a part of our past,
a part of ourselves.

760
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:17,000
That La Fortuna has a story.

761
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:22,800
A story irrevocably
entwined with our own.

762
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:27,900
Indeed, the very history of the city…

763
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:28,900
Excuse me…

764
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:29,700
Who are you?

765
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,700
It's me, Gwen.

766
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,600
No, she wears a funny hat.

767
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:41,400
If I may, this is a waste
of the council's valuable time.

768
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,200
This building has value.
Doesn't it, Miss Kinny?

769
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:50,100
It holds precious secrets
about what this city once was

770
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,800
and what it inspired to be?? 

771
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:57,500
and it's held on
through change

772
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:03,400
and against incredible odds.
Against earthquakes…

773
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,060
You're that sweet girl
next door to me
that smokes too much.

774
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:12,200
…and we need to hear that story.

775
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:18,100
We need to tell it
because this city

776
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:23,300
can be a cold
cruel place.

777
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,700
That's the awful truth.

778
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,600
You can't tear it down.

779
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,600
Because I won't let you.

780
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,600
Gwen Moss,

781
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,000
you don't remember me.

782
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,100
John Hass,

783
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:05,100
used to be Johnny Hassenschmidt

784
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,800
I can't believe you're my councilman.

785
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,300
How come I never got to know you.

786
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,800
My parents,
they transferred me to private school.

787
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,000
Can I give you a lift here?

788
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,900
I'm from New York.

789
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:51,200
Good luck with this building thing.
 __ 

790
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,100
Can I call you sometime?

791
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,400
God, yes.

792
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,000
How is the book coming?

793
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,600
It's terrible.

794
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:33,100
It's horrible. I'm completely blocked.

795
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,500
This is just a letter,
to the Times.

796
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,300
-Do you wanna hear it?
-Sure.

797
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:50,300
Once upon a time I needed a home.
And the day I found one

798
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:56,300
was the day I first beheld
the beautiful courtyard at La Fortuna.

799
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:01,000
She goes on and on about
she knows all her neighbors.

800
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,600
 __ good thing.

801
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,300
What is her problem?

802
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,600
It is pretty rude
to read at the table.

803
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,200
She doesn't even sign her name.
She signs a friend of La Fortuna.

804
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,400
How do you know it's a she?

805
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,500
I just know. "Beheld", come on.

806
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,899
I can't believe
you're not coming with me.

807
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,100
Don't go.

808
01:08:27,499 --> 01:08:30,100
I cannot be in town
for the holidays, no way.

809
01:08:31,499 --> 01:08:34,600
It's non-enjoyable.

810
01:08:34,999 --> 01:08:37,500
I can't get away.

811
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:42,000
I am so behind and
the schematic is insane.

812
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,300
I bet __ this whole Christmas
 __ with mom and pop the second I leave.

813
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,000
I don't think so.

814
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,399
Right. I forgot your dad's dead.

815
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,200
I guess I just assumed he was.

816
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:09,399
Actually he's not. Yet.

817
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,000
He's just a drunk.

818
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,500
So is my mom.

819
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,800
So I don't speak to him ever.

820
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,200
 __ to the family.

821
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,899
So you'll be okay.
All by yourself. Alone.

822
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:47,399
I'll be fine.
I'll figure something out.

823
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,700
The building sleeps, yet I can not.
Who talks like that?

824
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:44,500
I am sorry but this is
the 5th letter in 3 weeks.

825
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:48,560
I know on the surface they appear
to be extremely well-written,
entertaining letters

826
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:54,000
but this person is attempting
to sabotage us, I know it.

827
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:58,500
Forget the preservationists.
No one listens the preservationists.

828
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,200
On the other hand,
where is your site report?

829
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,300
I haven't filed one yet.

830
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,800
Dockin is scared to show his face
at La Fortuna.

831
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,300
Oh, yeah?
I'll tell you what.

832
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:11,300
I will pay a visit to that dump
right now.

833
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,900
She's not home.

834
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,200
I too have a previous engagement.
He'll be here any minute.

835
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:18,300
-It's beautifully preserved.
-Yes. It's held up well.

836
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,700
So many people…

837
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,000
So beautifully planned,
I always thought.

838
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,300
Designed by…

839
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:33,100
What was that woman's name?
I used to know it.

840
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,800
Oh, my God.

841
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,400
I think I know her name.

842
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:48,600
She was one of the first
woman architects in Los Angeles.

843
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,100
Is that a fact?

844
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,400
It all connects.

845
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,400
Most people don't notice.

846
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,500
I'm an architect.

847
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:07,200
We pay attention to
how things are made.

848
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,100
I could tell you stories…

849
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,900
A man lived right over there.

850
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,700
Fell like a ton of bricks
for the lady two doors over.

851
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,800
Really?

852
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,300
Both married, mind you.

853
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,400
I said "mother, this isn't Omaha".

854
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,400
Went out together one day
to buy fly paper,

855
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,500
never came back.

856
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,700
Still send me pictures
of the grand-children.

857
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,400
There he is.

858
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,000
-Hi. What's the matter?
-Nothing.

859
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,900
Well, so…
Come here.

860
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,100
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

861
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,500
Smoking?

862
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,560
Do you smoke?

863
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,600
What? No.

864
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:46,900
Non-smoking.
As "none is possible".

865
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,700
What was that?

866
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,100
Oh, my god.
Are you all right?

867
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,600
What happened?

868
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,800
Excuse me.

869
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,200
 __ in this place.

870
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,200
Look out!

871
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,500
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

872
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,400
Lactose-intolerant.

873
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,900
The first step
is admitting it.

874
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,000
You're very sweet.
Very sweet with that old lady
who lives near you.

875
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,300
The character she is.

876
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:47,900
It's not like
she lives in a shoe or anything.

877
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,000
She's actually led a
fascinating life.

878
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,400
I don't think I've ever spoken
to one of my neighbors.

879
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,800
I'm too self-centered,
obsessed with my career…

880
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:02,700
I see myself running for major
some day.

881
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,500
That's just the beginning.

882
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,700
With me, my career comes first.

883
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:14,600
I guess not a lot of women
like to hear that.

884
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,400
So you can't eat cheese
of any kind?

885
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,300
The building sleeps,
yet I can not.

886
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,700
-What?
-Nothing.

887
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:28,200
You know how something as insignificant
as those La Fortuna letters

888
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,800
can sometimes just shake you
to your core?

889
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,100
No.

890
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,700
I don't believe it.

891
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,700
That's my ghost writer.
That's the woman who's
writing my book.

892
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,200
Who is she to make feel
this guilty?

893
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,300
Look over there and tell me
if that woman is looking at us.

894
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,000
No, she's not looking at us.

895
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,000
I know that guy
from somewhere though.

896
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:04,900
Bitch.

897
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,200
I'm sorry, what?

898
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,800
I Can't do this.

899
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,200
Can't compete with someone
you've never even met.

900
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,500
What are you talking about?

901
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,100
That woman who writes
those letters.

902
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,200
That's who you're thinking about
just now, isn't it?

903
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,400
That's who you're always
thinking about.

904
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:32,100
Isn't that Taffy
from One Big Happy Family?

905
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,000
Oh, god.

906
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,000
-I thought she was…
-Dead, I know.

907
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,300
I'm writing her autobiography.

908
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,500
You know Taffy.
Oh, my god.

909
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,500
And I cancelled on her?? 
today.

910
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:51,000
I'd better go say something.
I think she saw me.

911
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,500
Francesca, hi.

912
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,500
Hi.

913
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:08,300
Look, I'm really sorry about today.

914
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,700
 __ 

915
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,700
I just met someone.

916
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:20,900
I am being thrown out
of my home.

917
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:23,400
I'm sorry but this book
means a lot to me.

918
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,900
I'm sorry too.

919
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:30,600
I swear I'll get to work on it.
I promise.

920
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,400
Bob wants you off the book.

921
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,400
I'm being fired?

922
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,900
Fired?

923
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,100
You've never been fired before?

924
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:48,200
No. I've been fired a lot.

925
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,800
This just never gets any easier.

926
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,600
Excuse me.
Can I ask you something?

927
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,100
Yes, it's me,
I'm not dead.

928
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:01,100
Would you have me arrested
if I smoke one cigarette?

929
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,500
I have a really short
attention span.

930
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,700
My pattern was always

931
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:25,700
get them __ fall in love with me,
get bored, get really bored, leave.

932
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,000
But this guy,

933
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,600
he sees me for what I am
and he never even watched the show.

934
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,100
Can you imagine
how enjoyable that was to hear?

935
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,200
Men have always treated me
like I was Taffy.

936
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,600
And he's smart,
he's really successful…

937
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:47,900
My problem is he's kind of…

938
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:50,200
Emotionally unavailable.

939
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,000
Deeply.

940
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,200
His emotions require voice mail.

941
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,800
This is an incredibly
controlling person.

942
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,000
You should never use
tissue on your face, only cotton.

943
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:05,900
I won't phone a man who's not in therapy.
Life's too short.

944
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:08,200
Why? What does tissue do?

945
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,200
I think he's falling in love
with someone else.

946
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,900
Oh, honey.

947
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,800
Then he is crazy.

948
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,300
He is an idiot.

949
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:33,000
You are beautiful,
intelligent and interesting.

950
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,100
I know.

951
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,600
We can handle this.
We are women.

952
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,000
Just get him into therapy.

953
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,700
The guy you're seeing,
is he in therapy?

954
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:52,400
No, he is perfect.

955
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:05,100
Francesca, I know this is
none of my business now but

956
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:07,000
don't hire another ghost.

957
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:10,000
Write to yourself,
to your story.

958
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,200
Me?

959
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:17,300
But I never even went to college.
Or high school very often.

960
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:20,600
I think you'll find it
highly enjoyable.

961
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,700
-I'm __ for historical status.
-Really?

962
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,100
Look at this.

963
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,900
See? I discovered something.

964
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,900
Something important.

965
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,900
Look who designed La Fortuna.

966
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,000
Sophia Monroe.

967
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,900
One of the first woman architects
in Los Angeles.

968
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,400
She literally changed the face
of this city.

969
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:06,000
-Nick, do you know what time it is?
-Nope.

970
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,700
Come to bed.

971
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,200
Honey, I can't.

972
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,100
The building sleeps,
yet I can not.

973
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Well.

974
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,500
Good night.

975
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:41,900
Good night.

976
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,700
So?

977
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,600
I like your other Bob better.

978
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,300
Who?

979
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,400
It is out of the question.

980
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,300
Why not? __
Who __ 

981
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,800
Anyway I wanna preserve
several pieces of the facade…

982
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:11,100
They want your original concept.
They're not gonna spend more money
so you can preserve __ 

983
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:14,300
We can at least attempt to preserve
some of the building.

984
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,600
You're beginning to sound like
this crazy preservationist.

985
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,300
She is not crazy.
She has a case.

986
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,260
Now she has a case?

987
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:25,300
Why, because some
dead movie stars lived there?

988
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:29,700
Because Sophia Monroe
designed it. Our teacher.

989
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:36,500
I warned you.

990
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,500
Do you remember what I told you?

991
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,500
I know this wasn't the plan but
there are things that you can't…

992
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:47,900
There are some things worth
holding on to

993
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:52,200
that connect us to the past
and to each other.

994
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,000
That show us who we are.

995
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:00,200
Sophia Monroe made a unique
contribution to our lives.

996
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:07,200
Since her death, she's at last been accepted
as one of the leading lights of modern architecture.

997
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:15,200
Therefore I urge this commission
to withdraw the demolition permit for La Fortuna.

998
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,400
And Louise Brooks lived there.

999
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,300
I brought you a kitty.
I was…

1000
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,200
It's easier.
They'll keep each other company.

1001
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,700
At least 2 isn't 3.

1002
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,400
I'm sorry.

1003
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:49,300
 __ and I was supposed…

1004
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:52,300
 __ what to eat today,
one of those happy meals
or one of those non-fat, non-dairy…

1005
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,400
Debbie, nobody cares.
Just eat it.

1006
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,900
I need a cigarette.

1007
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,200
I can't really stay.

1008
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Wait. I wanna tell you
about John.

1009
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,200
Just wait.

1010
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,200
You've got to hear the whole thing.
It's so amazing.

1011
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:21,000
Finding him again after
all these years.

1012
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,200
It's such a great story,
don't you think?

1013
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,800
Forget it.

1014
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:33,300
I'd better get going,
Dean's waiting for me in the car.

1015
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,000
Why?

1016
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,000
Because he is.

1017
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,200
Why is Dean in the car?

1018
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,300
The man is constantly in his car!

1019
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:48,400
He happens to like
spending time in his car

1020
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,600
but I can't talk to her
about Dean or Chelsea

1021
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,800
Because you don't understand.

1022
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,300
Women with children.

1023
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,400
It's like a club
that I can't get into.

1024
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,700
Like that cool group
in high school.

1025
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:09,500
She tells me every minute
that she's gonna be moving to New York
like __ 

1026
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,200
I am not moving to New York.

1027
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,300
And I don't know why Dean
is always sitting in the car.

1028
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,200
It's just the way it is when
you share a life with someone.

1029
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,600
It's complicated.

1030
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:22,000
You just wanna keep hearing
how perfect everything is.

1031
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:29,400
But how could you bring me a cat?

1032
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,000
I'm sorry, I'll take it back.

1033
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,400
No, no, no.

1034
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,200
Two is better.

1035
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,700
You know,

1036
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:56,700
you think I'm done because
I have these things that I have.

1037
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,000
Like it's the end of the story.

1038
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,100
And it's not.

1039
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,700
It's not a story.

1040
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,700
Good morning, Cheryl.

1041
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,700
-Angenelle.
-What.

1042
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,160
Angenelle.

1043
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:28,700
What.

1044
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,700
Just heard the bad news.

1045
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,500
La Fortuna was granted
historical status.

1046
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:40,800
No problem.

1047
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,000
I just assumed that it was…

1048
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,200
Don't worry so much,
you'll leave longer.

1049
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,600
It says they granted it
historical status.

1050
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,760
Doesn't say they can't tear it down.

1051
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,200
Give me a cigarette.

1052
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,200
-What about the preservation committee?
-Can't preserve shit?? 

1053
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,300
They're all out celebrating.

1054
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,700
Some announcement
in the paper.

1055
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,400
But you can't believe
everything you read.

1056
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:15,200
I let you know that I will fight this.
I'll do everything in my power.

1057
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,500
But it's not
within your power, is it?

1058
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:21,000
That something has come
to an end.

1059
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,500
Don't look so sad
and think it was all your fault.

1060
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:37,300
You're a dear sweet boy
to come here.

1061
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:40,100
No, I'm not, believe me.

1062
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:50,800
Yesterday my mother calls.
My father collapsed again.

1063
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:55,500
It must be bad because
she asked me to come see him

1064
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:58,500
and I said no.

1065
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:01,500
So, you see?
I'm not sweet.

1066
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,300
I don't even know why I came here.

1067
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,600
Yes, I do.

1068
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,800
I need to find the woman
who wrote those letters.

1069
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,100
Who?

1070
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:19,100
A friend of La Fortuna.
I have to speak to her.

1071
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,600
It's important.

1072
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:27,900
Sorry, I have to rest
for just a moment.

1073
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,600
Just tell me her name.

1074
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:33,900
I can't.

1075
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,700
I can't see you anymore.

1076
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,200
You know how mother feels about you.

1077
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:53,700
It wouldn't be right
but I do care for you.

1078
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,800
What do words can say?

1079
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,900
Me too.

1080
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:17,500
Saving this building is the only thing
I've ever done right in my whole life.

1081
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:33,800
They cancelled __
against preservation.

1082
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:40,800
The city government.
Is what I hate about my job.

1083
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,100
You outvoted?

1084
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,900
No.

1085
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:58,700
The vote is unanimous.

1086
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,300
Where's my other shoe.

1087
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:15,700
I was not voting against you,
I have certain commitments.

1088
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,000
This is the part I hate.

1089
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,400
This is the part __
actually hurts.

1090
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,500
I believed in you.

1091
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,900
I thought you and I were…

1092
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,430
I'm sorry.


1093
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:45,100
No, I'm sorry.

1094
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,900
Some things can't be forgiven.

1095
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:55,600
Some people can't be forgiven,
like you.

1096
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:00,600
You're gonna crucify me
because I told you the truth?

1097
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,400
About how I voted?
About who I am?

1098
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,300
You said you believed in me.

1099
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,400
You don't even know me.

1100
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,300
Cinders,
what are you doing?

1101
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,300
Come here.

1102
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,400
Harriet.

1103
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:04,700
I don't like to delay by the point
but at the same time __ 

1104
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:06,000
Anyway there it is.

1105
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,700
That's very disturbing.

1106
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,400
What type of thing?

1107
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:14,500
An elderly woman passed away
last night at La Fortuna.

1108
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,500
Miss Kinney.

1109
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,500
Miss Kinney.

1110
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,400
This just does not help the mood
in the community.

1111
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:20,800
A lot of __ 

1112
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,600
That's his uncle Faustus.

1113
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,900
He looks like you.

1114
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,400
Go home.
I'll stay with him.

1115
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,100
-Bye, honey.
-Bye.

1116
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:14,900
I called the firm.

1117
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,000
They said you went to see
your father.

1118
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,800
I did.

1119
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,500
Francesca, I did.

1120
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,100
You don't speak to your father.

1121
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:34,500
Well, today I did.

1122
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,500
But it doesn't bear mentioning to,?? 
for instance me.

1123
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:41,300
I didn't know that
I was gonna do it.

1124
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,500
I don't get it.

1125
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:53,200
I give you the opportunity
of a lifetime,

1126
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,500
I give you myself,
which I…

1127
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:02,300
which I swear
would never do.

1128
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:10,800
So tell me,
what did I do wrong?

1129
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:24,000
I watched you
when I was a kid.

1130
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,500
What?

1131
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,200
I loved you.

1132
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:34,800
I loved Taffy.

1133
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,100
I was just afraid to tell you.

1134
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:47,900
-You lied about that?
-Yeah.

1135
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:07,800
This is the longest hours
I've ever been in my entire life.

1136
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,200
That's a perfect ending to __ 

1137
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,000
Come on,
don't do this.

1138
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,500
-Listen to me.
-No, you listen.

1139
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:19,200
You're never gonna live up
to your potential.

1140
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:20,300
You're never gonna have a piano.

1141
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:22,900
You're self destructive
and make self destructive choices,

1142
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:25,200
you're toxic and
I don't wanna be around you anymore.

1143
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,500
You're just worthy to leave.

1144
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:27,400
Shut up.

1145
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,900
Isn't this about
when you always leave?

1146
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:33,600
When the __ is getting hard
and you figure there's gotta be something
better or newer or easier…

1147
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:39,200
I know, I've done it.
It's all I've done.

1148
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:44,700
So neither of us
know how to do this.

1149
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,500
So what?

1150
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,000
So what?

1151
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:55,400
Why can't we just
start from here?

1152
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,400
I can't.

1153
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:00,800
Why not?

1154
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:08,300
Because it's gonna end eventually.
Everything does.

1155
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:16,900
The show gets cancelled
and everybody goes through
separate ways.

1156
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:23,800
Even if they're your family.

1157
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,100
I don't want you to go.

1158
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:45,200
Someday you'll thank me.
Honest.

1159
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,700
 __ right?

1160
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:53,500
Right Stinky?

1161
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,200
Oh, my god.

1162
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:42,900
Cinders

1163
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:46,000
Come here, baby.

1164
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:55,200
It's okay, baby.

1165
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:58,500
We're gonna go home.

1166
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,700
So then it's true,
you're leaving.

1167
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:53,900
I got something for you.

1168
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:58,900
What?

1169
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,400
I quit smoking.

1170
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,600
Who am I gonna talk to now?

1171
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:13,000
-Wanna know how I quit?
-No.

1172
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,900
How?

1173
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:31,700
I'll be right back.

1174
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:07,800
First time?

1175
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,200
Me too.

1176
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:18,600
Gwendolyn Moss

1177
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:22,300
Nicholas Daukintis

1178
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,800
It's Lithuanian.

1179
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:30,100
I know.

1180
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,500
Most of us have appreciated
the perfection of the universe,

1181
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:05,000
the animation of living things,
the action of the human mind

1182
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,400
and the power of love.

1183
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:12,600
These things all seem to denote
a dynamic lifeforce

1184
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,000
that surges through everything
around us.

1185
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:22,200
This force appears to direct
all things harmoniously but irresistibly

1186
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:27,200
towards a natural,
definite, useful conclusion.

1187
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:33,300
Is it hard to recognize in this lifeforce
a power greater than ourselves?

1188
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,500
What happened to La Fortuna?

1189
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:26,000
Well, it's gone
but that's not the point.

1190
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:29,200
The point is
you're here.

1191
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:35,300
And that's the story
of how your mommy and daddy met.
