1
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:23,383
Ladies!

2
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,520
Break's over.

3
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:28,690
Elsa Cartwright, I'm not
paying you to hit golf balls.

4
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,238
I want you to deliver
these to the golf teams

5
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,675
of every elite private
school in New England.

6
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:21,709
Outsiders?

7
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:22,844
Hardly.

8
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,345
This year's junior tournament
parent coordinator thought

9
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,715
it would be a strategic
move to recruit new members.

10
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,484
Doling out invites
like CVS coupons.

11
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,887
Just do as I say, Petey Varga.

12
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,640
See you on the green.

13
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:39,921
Wait, wait.

14
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,288
Delivery, wait.

15
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,990
Wait wait wait.

16
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:44,458
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

17
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:47,095
I'm looking for the
school's golf teams.

18
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,896
The JV and varsity.

19
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,298
It's the summer.

20
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:58,371
There's a driving
range two miles west.

21
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:00,875
I think the kids practice there.

22
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,660
Kid's got a bright
future, unlike me.

23
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,167
Can I help you?

24
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,935
Invitations to
Butlerbrick Golf

25
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,704
and Country Club's
junior tournament.

26
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,607
Old elitist institution
getting desperate, huh?

27
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,742
Elsa Cartwright?

28
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,177
From the Connecticut
Cartwrights?

29
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,845
That's right, ma'am.

30
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,047
Well, these kids
only practice here

31
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,716
when school's in session.

32
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,785
Right, summer.

33
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:45,052
Who knew?

34
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,554
Actually, there is
another Elsa Cartwright

35
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,689
that's working a
summer job here for me.

36
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:50,224
Of course, not a
Connecticut Cartwright,

37
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,893
more of like a cleaning
crew Cartwright.

38
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:54,862
But she's still a
pretty good golfer.

39
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,334
Here, how about I give
these to their parents?

40
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,004
You're my
type of woman, ma'am.

41
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:10,144
Excuse me, I have a meeting.

42
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,956
Reception, please hold.

43
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,525
Back.

44
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:26,027
Else, I'm concerned
you're taking out

45
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,229
<i>your frustration on</i>
<i>Mom's golf clubs.</i>

46
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,730
<i>They're practically heirlooms.</i>

47
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,666
No, they're hand-me-downs.

48
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,734
If they were worth anything, I
would have sold them already.

49
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:37,538
<i>They were Mom's. That's</i>
<i>gotta count for something.</i>

50
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,373
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean it like that.

51
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:43,443
Oh, one second.

52
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,413
Reception, please hold.

53
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,250
<i>Here.</i>

54
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,252
I don't know, I guess I'm just
upset about Dad being laid off.

55
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,755
College and getting a job is
just so far out of reach now.

56
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,560
I just don't wanna end up like
everyone else around here.

57
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:02,563
<i>Who works in construction</i>
<i>or does hair.</i>

58
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,132
Weird.

59
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,336
<i>Weird?</i>
<i>It's humiliating.</i>

60
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,973
You really want student
debt, or like a useless

61
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,407
<i>college degree and</i>
<i>still be living at home.</i>

62
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,911
I'm having a midlife crisis.

63
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,579
Ugh!

64
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,716
Reception, please hold.

65
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,718
<i>You know, I</i>
<i>called three times already.</i>

66
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,120
Well, I am sorry you've
called three times today,

67
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:28,055
but we are very busy.

68
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,627
Back.

69
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:34,829
My life is literally
in the shitter.

70
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:38,933
Hey, everyone shits,
even rich people.

71
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,128
Miss Cartwright.

72
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,997
Tina, I found
these in the store.

73
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,333
You know you're not supposed
to sell your designs here.

74
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,935
But look how cute they are.

75
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:14,535
Tina.

76
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,070
Please, Margery.

77
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,773
Tina, the women that come
in here, they want labels.

78
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,274
They want brand names.

79
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,810
They wanna wear what
their friends are wearing.

80
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,679
All right, I've tried to sell
other stuff in here before.

81
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,748
It doesn't sell. I am sorry.

82
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,087
All right, look at it like this.

83
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,657
You walk into a grocery
store. You need some cat food.

84
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,525
I don't have a cat.

85
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,060
We have a dog.

86
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,195
Fine, you need dog food.

87
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:44,398
They have some Purina,
they have some Blue Ribbon.

88
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:47,535
But then, look, on the shelf,
sitting in a plastic bag,

89
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,104
is some bootleg dog food.

90
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,206
What are you gonna choose?

91
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,776
The plastic bag if it
was in my price range.

92
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,011
Duh.

93
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,014
The point is, labels
aren't just for show.

94
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,183
They show what's inside.

95
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:03,884
Now don't let me find
these here again,

96
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,619
or you'll be out of a job.

97
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,655
This is a summer job, and
Labor Day is this weekend.

98
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,623
Well in that case, you'll
be out of a reference.

99
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,727
Now take your freaking
designs. Get outta here.

100
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,501
Come on.

101
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:23,070
Else.

102
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:24,939
Better
not see these again.

103
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,752
The tournament has been
generously underwritten,

104
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:42,023
and juniors will receive
a cash prize of $15,000.

105
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,425
$15,000?

106
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,694
Yeah. I think
that's pretty normal.

107
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,262
Haven't you heard people
at the driving range

108
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:49,530
talk about their private clubs?

109
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:00,741
Aw, did you miss us?

110
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,764
It's a sign.

111
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,199
Seriously.

112
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,002
You've been stressing
about college all summer.

113
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,303
Now you can win your tuition.

114
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:31,072
It's a coincidence for sure.

115
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:34,008
You know what Dad
says about coincidences.

116
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:37,311
They're for people who
don't believe in destiny.

117
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,047
How did this happen?

118
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:43,084
Doesn't matter.
You have to go.

119
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,718
No, I'm sure
there's an entry fee,

120
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,587
and they probably charge
a lot to stay there.

121
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,589
I'm sure we can
afford like one night,

122
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,157
between the two of us.

123
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,227
I mean, I have savings
from the summer, don't you?

124
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,995
What's in this for you?

125
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:58,332
I could make us some cute
clothes, and then maybe

126
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,801
the people at the club
woulda wanna wear them.

127
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:04,271
Our savings is money
that could go to Dad, to--

128
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:05,507
To what?

129
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,509
It's not even enough for like

130
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:10,311
a semester of community college.

131
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:14,482
Oh wow.

132
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,458
I'm in.

133
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:30,231
When Butlerbrick
Golf and Country Club

134
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:34,935
opened its doors in 1924,
it became an instant--

135
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,139
Scene 101, Take 38.

136
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:41,242
When Butlerbrick Golf and
Country Club opened its doors

137
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:45,980
in 1913, it became an
instantaneous hot spot,

138
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,850
for golf enthusiasts
and swinging socialites.

139
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:55,524
Ah, sorry, I gotta
start again.

140
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,793
Seasons have changed.
Fortunes have fallen.

141
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:03,197
But Butlerbrick has remained
a place of community

142
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,333
for those wealthy
enough to afford one.

143
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:11,573
Hello, I'm Victor Simmons,
and for four generations,

144
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,774
my family has made it a priority

145
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:17,912
to create a welcoming
home for the elite.

146
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,380
Cut.

147
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:22,183
I can see you.

148
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,553
Are you sure this
thing doesn't work?

149
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,588
Unfortunately, no, ma'am.

150
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,889
I need you to get down lower.

151
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,158
You have to get lower.

152
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:32,393
Lower.

153
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,630
You know what, forget it,
you're done. You're cut.

154
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,031
Let's go.

155
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,435
Did you deliver
the invitations?

156
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,770
It's all taken care of, sir.

157
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,772
I've got a commercial to run.

158
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,174
And we're rolling again.

159
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:53,080
Consider Butlerbrick the
next time you feel unimportant.

160
00:11:56,417 --> 00:12:00,287
<i>You have money.</i>
<i>You are important.</i>

161
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:24,311
Nurse, tell Pilot to
turn on the heat seaters.

162
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:25,312
Heat--

163
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:26,615
Seat heaters?

164
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,948
In the heli.

165
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,953
There's somewhere
that I need to be.

166
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,068
Come on.

167
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,439
Let's go.

168
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:02,349
Perfect.

169
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:09,790
Go.

170
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,250
Aunt Janet says hi, Dad.

171
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,619
<i>You have arrived.</i>

172
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:38,553
I love you.

173
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,453
- Bye.
- Bye.

174
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,158
Okay, ready?

175
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,193
<i>Whoa, Kenny!</i>

176
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,427
Next time, may I
suggest you walk?

177
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:34,576
He was rude.

178
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,986
There's only
up from here, sir.

179
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,454
This is humiliating.

180
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,923
Let's just try and
forget last year's debacle.

181
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,425
Forget?

182
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,764
How can I forget when my
name is ranked dead last?

183
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,632
It's like you trying to
forget you were born a caddy

184
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:00,502
when you're scrambling
for stray golf balls.

185
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:02,302
I wasn't born a caddy.

186
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:03,437
I'm sorry, okay.

187
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:04,806
It's hard to be
political correct

188
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,140
when you're feeling lightheaded.

189
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,542
Are you hungry?

190
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,778
Am I having
a heart attack?

191
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,779
Ow, Ow

192
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:11,979
Roger?

193
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,648
Do you need a snack?

194
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:16,483
Nuts or trail mix?

195
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,252
Nuts.

196
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,387
Excellent choice, sir.

197
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:22,256
Who's Cartwright?

198
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,090
Who?

199
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,726
Number three.

200
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:27,194
I nearly won last year. I
should be on top of Northfield.

201
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,496
Always
thought you'd be a bottom.

202
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,900
Mm, make out.

203
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,934
Northfield, didn't
see you coming.

204
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,169
That's sexy.

205
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,137
Stop fannying.
Who's Cartwright?

206
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,506
I'm not fannying.

207
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,741
You're the one
fannying while faffing.

208
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:41,208
I'm not faffing.

209
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,043
Who is Cartwright?

210
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:44,813
You don't know the
infamous Cartwright

211
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,281
of the Connecticut Cartwrights?

212
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,851
Oh, the Connecticut
Cartwrights.

213
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,686
Why didn't you just say so?

214
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,388
Overheard Simmons discussing
the news story at brunch.

215
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:55,924
Arg, matey.

216
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:57,958
But he didn't
even play last year.

217
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,493
How can he be third?

218
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:00,994
Ah, last year.

219
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,732
Well, when one player drives
their golf cart into the lake

220
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:07,034
when they're about to
clinch the tournament,

221
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,704
just how much
competition is there?

222
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,911
Aw, fudge.

223
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,650
How dare you
bring up my incident?

224
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,819
I nearly drowned.

225
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:28,388
I had to spend a week in the
spa sauna after the lake leech.

226
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:31,358
I'll never understand
why Lumer wasn't driving.

227
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:35,295
Why would you drive
your own golf cart, bro?

228
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:36,764
Ah!

229
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:40,234
Granny Lynn. So
she's back, eh?

230
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,069
Speaking of unfair.

231
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,005
She's an 83-year-old woman

232
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,841
who only golfs with
her right hand.

233
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,711
The odds are really stacked
against you, Kowalski.

234
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:52,947
The rules say 18 and under,
so you'd see why I'd be upset.

235
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,750
Admit that you suck at golf.

236
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,585
Maybe I like sucking.

237
00:16:58,586 --> 00:16:59,654
Ah.

238
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:01,088
Hi, excuse me.

239
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,590
Could you point us
to tournament check-in?

240
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:03,625
Yeah.

241
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,898
Hello there, fair maiden.
Not interrupting at all.

242
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,866
In the foyer. I can
walk you there if need be.

243
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,903
I'm Roger. My mommy
is underwriting the
tournament prize.

244
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,572
To avoid scandal, he's
number eight on the board.

245
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,173
See number eight,
Kowalski, at the bottom.

246
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:23,310
And I'm number one,
Bernard Northfield.

247
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,748
And these are our caddies,
but they're unimportant.

248
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:28,516
Hi, Lumer.

249
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:30,150
Oh, hi, I'm Tina.

250
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,293
I'm Elsa, Cartwright.

251
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,695
Cartwright.

252
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:41,930
You're ranking number
three, Cartwright.

253
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,196
Oh, cool.

254
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,966
Pre-rankings, that's
a lotta pressure

255
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,668
for a junior golf
game, isn't it?

256
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:49,303
Thank you. See, that's what
I've been trying to tell you.

257
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,104
See? Doesn't mean anything.

258
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,306
I'd rather
be ranked last night

259
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,841
than not ranked at all, caddy.

260
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:55,944
Well, your dreams came true.

261
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,277
Shut up.

262
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,245
Well it's
nice to meet you guys.

263
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,347
Yeah, thank you.

264
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:01,950
Cool, okay.

265
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,785
I will follow you on Instagram.

266
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,185
Follow her on Instagram?

267
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,955
I'll follow her into Chernobyl.

268
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:07,956
Wait up.

269
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:08,990
What's Chernobyl?

270
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,290
Enjoy nut munching.

271
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,759
Maybe I will.

272
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:12,961
Yeah, it's tasty.

273
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,294
Gunter!

274
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,964
- I'll take this.
- Thank you.

275
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,739
Marshal.

276
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:27,542
Thanks.

277
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:28,676
Oh!

278
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,011
What the hell, dude?

279
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:33,815
Did it hurt,
when you fell from heaven?

280
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:37,217
You just slammed a door in
my face, so yeah, it hurt.

281
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:38,620
I panicked.

282
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:42,122
You look exactly like
my future ex-wife.

283
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,393
I'm Marshal, Mayson.

284
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:47,695
Hi.

285
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:49,129
The Fifth.

286
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,032
Okay, I'm Tina Cartwright.

287
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,067
Of the Connecticut
Cartwrights?

288
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,503
Yeah, I am from Connecticut.

289
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,575
Aren't you gonna apologize?

290
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,375
For what?

291
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,977
Bashing my nose in.

292
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,880
Uh, I kinda did you a
favor, because now the ladies

293
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,347
at the Junior League
don't have to talk

294
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,182
when you get that nose job.

295
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,318
Are you saying my nose is big?

296
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,253
I'm not not saying it's big.

297
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:14,722
Say you're sorry.

298
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:16,124
I'm not sorry we met.

299
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,559
And I'm not wearing
any underwear.

300
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,261
Again, have we met?

301
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,898
I'm Marshal Mayson V

302
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:31,739
Right through here.

303
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,076
Oh,
just one waiter?

304
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,578
Oh, it's Winston.

305
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:39,947
He's very efficient.

306
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:43,551
Ah, ladies, meet Ms. Lynn.

307
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:45,920
She's just returned
from a lengthy hiatus.

308
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,255
It's Granny Lynn to you dears.

309
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,060
May I present Elsa Cartwright

310
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,163
of the Connecticut Cartwrights.

311
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,531
I don't think so.

312
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:57,799
Hm?

313
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:00,001
I said I don't think
this is Elsa Cartwright

314
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:02,402
of the Connecticut Cartwrights.

315
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:04,806
Oh.

316
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:08,810
Elsa grandmother's was
one of my closest friends.

317
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:13,915
Diana Cartwright, and
I saw Elsa many times.

318
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:17,952
The most recent time being
at her grandmother's funeral.

319
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,419
Uh.

320
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,859
Yes, I remember you.

321
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,128
I probably look a
little different.

322
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,796
I've been working all summer.

323
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,630
Working?

324
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:36,303
Oh, oh, you mean with
your charity work.

325
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,573
Yes, my charity work.

326
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,276
What a summer can
do when you're 17.

327
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,754
Well ,
wait a minute.

328
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:59,359
Your shoulders should be
covered in a club, young lady.

329
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:05,032
Okay.

330
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:09,036
I can't believe I
forgot a cardigan.

331
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,337
More importantly, who the fuck

332
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,773
are these Connecticut
Cartwrights?

333
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,109
Okay, I found it.

334
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:18,846
Diana Cartwright's
obituary is in Vanity Fair.

335
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,081
Oh my God.

336
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:22,750
They're like some kind
of American dynasty.

337
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,187
Oh my God.

338
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,588
Get this.

339
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:29,991
She is survived by
her parakeet, Wendell,

340
00:21:30,124 --> 00:21:33,728
to whom a sizable trust
fund has been left.

341
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:34,829
Nice.

342
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:36,697
Guess there is more than one

343
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:39,033
Elsa Cartwright in Connecticut.

344
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,873
So she goes to the Daft School.

345
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:47,374
Ugh.

346
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:49,376
And she golfs at the driving
range during the school year.

347
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,646
So, should we unpack?

348
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,181
I think we should
make a run for it.

349
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,481
We already made it this far.

350
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:55,783
Everyone here
knows these people.

351
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:56,918
They're gonna
realize I'm not her.

352
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:58,385
They know of them.

353
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,188
But only that old lady
like actually knows them,

354
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,756
and you already fooled her.

355
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:02,590
Come on.

356
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:05,059
You're both, I don't know,

357
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:06,093
brunettes.

358
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,063
Oh my God, wait.

359
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:10,264
No, look, look, look, look.

360
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,465
Says she's gone for the summer.

361
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,335
No having cellphones out

362
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:18,371
on club property, Rule 78.

363
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:20,440
Heed my warning.

364
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,846
Ladies.

365
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:30,117
Hi, would you like
to join me at lunch?

366
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:31,351
- Oh, no.
- We'd love to.

367
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,253
- We can't impose.
- Yes, no.

368
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:33,386
We'd love, yes.

369
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:35,388
No no, no no, hey, it's on me.

370
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:37,758
It's on Daddy, but
it will be fun.

371
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,665
Follow me, ha ha.

372
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,434
Here you are.

373
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:48,569
Thank you.

374
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:51,239
Lumer, sit.

375
00:22:56,944 --> 00:22:58,813
Oh yes, hotdogs.

376
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,719
That was fast.

377
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,290
Roger's family are
gold status members.

378
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,592
They've been here for years.

379
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:14,028
Dig in.

380
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,871
What is this?

381
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:28,643
Cheers.

382
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:33,114
Roger, can I ask
you a question?

383
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:34,447
- Why?
- Oh.

384
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:36,317
God.

385
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:37,985
Unfortunate turn of events.

386
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,153
Caddy, wand me.

387
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:40,354
It's fine.

388
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:42,957
Thank you. Allow me.

389
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,424
The White's Wand.

390
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:46,426
Gets anything out like magic.

391
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,462
You just apply a
little bit to your, um,

392
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:51,732
to your chest area.

393
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,434
To your breasts, your boobs.

394
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:56,704
- Got it.
- Okay, sorry.

395
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:59,607
Oh, first you actually
need to apply some water, oh!

396
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,775
Oh my God.

397
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:03,644
Okay, there I go again, ha ha.

398
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:04,879
Mr. Klutz.

399
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:06,147
Olé!

400
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:10,685
Sorry.

401
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:14,655
Smoothly executed, sir.

402
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:15,957
I feel flushed.

403
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,959
I think you're
just embarrassed.

404
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,193
Are you okay?

405
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:20,127
Feel my forehead.

406
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:21,529
You're fine.

407
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:23,798
I'm not fine. I
think I have a fever.

408
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,634
He's got a panic disorder.

409
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,169
He doesn't look good.

410
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:29,704
No, that's mild.

411
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:31,038
Can I ask you a question?

412
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:31,872
Winston?

413
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:32,873
Sir?

414
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,608
Grab me a fresh
wiener for Elsa.

415
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:37,445
Actually I should probably
go see if Elsa's okay, so

416
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:38,879
Winston, will you
just send it up?

417
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:39,680
Thanks.

418
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:47,321
Roger, my
man, whatever you guys
are doing over here,

419
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:49,690
you need to chill it out, okay?

420
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:52,026
Especially you.

421
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,133
Hey!

422
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:01,569
You had your hat on.

423
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:03,237
I thought you were leaving.

424
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:05,373
I always have my hat on.

425
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,974
He knows I don't
take off my hat.

426
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:07,742
He's an asshole.

427
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,711
Oh my God, what the H?

428
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:13,381
What is going on
with these people?

429
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,750
Mommy says to never let
anybody see the top of my head

430
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:18,119
because of my genetic
predisposition for early onset

431
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:20,054
- Male pattern baldness.
- Male pattern baldness.

432
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,393
I had an inquiry for you,
Roger. Will you give me a call?

433
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,962
Can't really use my
cellphone on club premises.

434
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:29,463
That's why she's
giving you her number,

435
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:31,532
in case you go to
the cellphone room.

436
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:34,702
No thanks.

437
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:37,838
Um, give me a call?

438
00:25:37,972 --> 00:25:38,739
Yeah.

439
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:42,910
Thank God.

440
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:44,245
What?

441
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,746
- Huh?
- What?

442
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,816
You heard her. She said
can I ask you a question?

443
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:52,253
That's premier I'm about
to ask you out intro.

444
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:53,988
Is that what she was doing?

445
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:56,657
Caddy, leave the
social science to me.

446
00:25:57,091 --> 00:25:59,293
There's a reason some
of us are born caddies.

447
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:01,862
Please tell me you know
I wasn't born a caddy.

448
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,597
What?

449
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:05,666
Tina just gave
me a great idea.

450
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,735
I will ask out Elsa.

451
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:11,806
So you're gonna reject Tina
and then ask out her sister?

452
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:14,909
Hm, I know you are but a
humble caddy and have much

453
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:17,311
to learn in this world,
but the best way to win

454
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:21,482
a tournament, as an
athlete, is to focus

455
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:23,651
on distracting the competition.

456
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:26,120
If Elsa is worried about me,

457
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,823
she will not have any
time to think about golf.

458
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:30,658
What about we
focus on your drives?

459
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:33,294
Instead of, like,
all this nonsense.

460
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:34,428
- Winston.
- Sir?

461
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:36,063
I will be taking
this. Thank you.

462
00:26:36,197 --> 00:26:37,765
I can't, sir.

463
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:39,834
I will deliver it,
Winston. That's very fine.

464
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,769
I have my orders, sir.

465
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:43,838
Winston, let go of the box.

466
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:46,474
No, sir, I have my orders.

467
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,209
I will deliver it, Winston.

468
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:49,710
You cannot take it.

469
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:52,514
Winston, let go of
the box. Give it to me!

470
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:54,148
I can't, sir.

471
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,818
A bag, sir?

472
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:00,988
That will not be necessary.

473
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:03,090
Thank you, Winston, lead me out.

474
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:04,325
Very good, sir.

475
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,293
Just go a little bit faster.

476
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:08,829
I can't go any faster, sir.

477
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:12,299
I tried to ask Roger
if he would model

478
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:15,169
for my clothing line, but
he got like violently ill.

479
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:18,105
Will you ask him? I
don't think he likes me.

480
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,541
Why Roger?

481
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:22,343
Have you seen his
all-pink ensemble?

482
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,245
He's clearly into fashion.

483
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:26,247
Isn't it a
woman's sports line?

484
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,182
Gender is a construct.

485
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:33,320
Look, tennis rackets.

486
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,257
<i>Oh, Elsa.</i>

487
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,533
At your service.

488
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:45,833
Thank you.

489
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:48,002
Oh, a note.

490
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:49,370
Oh, what?

491
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:50,804
What's it say?

492
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:52,740
Elsa, will you go to
the junior tournament

493
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:55,910
celebrational formal
with me, kisses, Roger?

494
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,278
My mommy's organizing it.

495
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:58,379
When is it?

496
00:27:58,513 --> 00:27:59,548
Post-tournament, that evening.

497
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,815
Okay, sure. Thanks, Roger.

498
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:05,886
Awesome sauce. Also,
will you be my girlfriend?

499
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:09,123
Uh, wow.

500
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:11,526
Okay.

501
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,627
Okay, well.

502
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,762
Okay, you'll be my girlfriend?

503
00:28:15,564 --> 00:28:16,697
Okay.

504
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,400
Okay,
I have girlfriend.

505
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:20,100
Okay.

506
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:21,435
Okay.

507
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,170
- Bye.
- Bye.

508
00:28:24,606 --> 00:28:25,439
Bye.

509
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:30,344
Thought I was gonna sneeze.

510
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:31,745
Okay, bye.

511
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,596
Make it rain!

512
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,899
Love 30.

513
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:55,402
Send it!

514
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,508
Are you queefing serious?

515
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:01,643
Love 40.

516
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:05,145
Fuck yeah!

517
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:09,116
Ow! You got me in the boob.

518
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,784
Game.

519
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:21,362
My new girlfriend asked me
to model, so model I will.

520
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:23,931
Hello, Mr. New Booty.

521
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,166
You're in too deep.

522
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,935
Then don't come.

523
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:30,004
You'll see.

524
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:32,873
The fish has already eaten
the hook hidden inside me.

525
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:34,275
The juicy bait.

526
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,552
I know exactly
what to get you.

527
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:45,520
Okay.

528
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:48,690
He looks good.

529
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,696
I mean Roger
is a great dresser.

530
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:55,896
Mm-hm.

531
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,031
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

532
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:58,533
I'll be right back, okay?

533
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,401
O-kay.

534
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:04,038
Hey.

535
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:05,707
Looks like we're
playing together.

536
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,509
Elsa's the golfer.

537
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:10,578
Looks like we're
playing together.

538
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:12,813
Look, it's not too
late to just call it off.

539
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:14,481
Get some sleep.

540
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:19,053
Lumer, ever since my daddy
had to take up residence

541
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:22,823
in Antigua for chasing the
American dream, sans taxes,

542
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:25,225
I haven't quite been myself.

543
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:27,729
Sir--

544
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:29,296
Oh oh oh, don't interrupt.

545
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:34,468
My daddy always said to
me, to be successful,

546
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:38,238
to be this successful,
you can't be honest.

547
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:42,610
And that applies to sports,
life, whatever you can win at.

548
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:43,678
All right, Marshal seems to be

549
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:45,379
Mr. Steal Yo Girl right now.

550
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:46,581
Mr. Steal My What?

551
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:55,222
Hello!

552
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,057
Shoo.

553
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:01,395
- Bye.
- Bye.

554
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:06,735
You couldn't have picked
a better guy for the job.

555
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,770
Roger loves his outfits.

556
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:13,240
Who, Marshal? That guy
smells like shit.

557
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:14,274
Yeah.

558
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:17,411
How are you, um,
how are you doing?

559
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:20,080
So how's your sister
feeling about, about the game?

560
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:22,916
And you also like television?

561
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:24,753
Cool.

562
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:27,589
Hello.

563
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:29,289
Hey.

564
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:32,893
May I interest you in a secret
handshake, as my girlfriend?

565
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:34,395
Sure.

566
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,430
This could be the
boyfriend-girlfriend handshake.

567
00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:38,031
Slide.

568
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,401
Pound, not like that.

569
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,772
That's pretty good.

570
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:47,007
And a little peace sign, and
we're boyfriend girlfriend.

571
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:01,455
No, I think I'll
just sleep in the nude.

572
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:03,090
I think you
made the right decision.

573
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:06,160
I regret it. Give
me the chemise.

574
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:08,128
I meant coming back here.

575
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,933
Why don't we go down and
have a drink with Winston?

576
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:16,838
Oh no, I'm not ready
to face Winston yet.

577
00:32:23,912 --> 00:32:25,312
You know what's funny?

578
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:27,749
Even though I'm not a model
or anything, I've always kind

579
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:30,618
of been immersed in like the
competitive world of fashion.

580
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:33,153
Like, my mommy's always
told me that you can tell

581
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:35,189
how much money somebody
has based off their handbag

582
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:36,758
and stuff like that.

583
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:41,328
Like, my greatest accessory
would be, like Lumer,

584
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:42,996
because I don't have a handbag.

585
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:47,836
On second thought, I'm not
sure that the beret is working.

586
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:50,805
But if Lumer was a
handbag, he'd probably--

587
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:52,907
Could you take it off, maybe?

588
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,846
Oh no, I think it
brings some worldliness

589
00:32:57,978 --> 00:32:59,413
to this whole thing.

590
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:03,518
A little bit of
parlez-vous Francais.

591
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:06,521
Well, maybe,

592
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:08,756
let's see.

593
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:10,625
Yeah, let's do this.

594
00:33:10,758 --> 00:33:13,561
Can you just tie this
around your waist,

595
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,864
and maybe lose the scarf?

596
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,198
Oh, I see what you
ladies are doing.

597
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,334
Wanna see the goodies.

598
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:23,003
You got it.

599
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:24,639
Did you hear that?

600
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:26,073
Some power poses.

601
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:27,274
Got it.

602
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:29,844
Just like
confident stuff.

603
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:31,011
Totally.

604
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:35,717
But you, Roger you.

605
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,751
The beauty within?

606
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:38,520
Like Vince Vaughn.

607
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:43,090
Not like Vince Vaughn.

608
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:46,360
Maybe somebody like Steve-O.

609
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:50,865
You can't handle the truth.

610
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,032
Something like that.

611
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,902
No, I think it's the beret.

612
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:54,836
What?

613
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:55,937
Can we just lose it?

614
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:57,037
- No, no no no.
- Please.

615
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,172
- Please.
- No no, no no.

616
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:01,041
Okay, bring it in.

617
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:02,476
What's up?

618
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,845
Okay, so you know how
you were saying that

619
00:34:03,978 --> 00:34:05,112
Lumer is like an
accessory, right?

620
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:08,248
Yeah, he's super nice, right.

621
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:11,318
But that's like, that's
kind of it, you know.

622
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:13,788
Some accessories, they
enhance us, and others,

623
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:17,291
they just, they keep us from
shining on our own, right?

624
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:18,492
- Mm.
- Hm-mm?

625
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:19,459
Mm-hm.

626
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:21,094
You don't need Lumer,

627
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,865
just like you don't
need that beret.

628
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:26,233
Come on, we'll do
it together, okay?

629
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,770
This one is for Vince.

630
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:36,544
Toss that old thing aside.

631
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,350
Let me see the cardigan.

632
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:47,254
Come on.

633
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:49,289
Come on.

634
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:52,860
Come on, yes!

635
00:34:52,994 --> 00:34:54,428
Yes, yes!

636
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:56,664
Perfect, that was great.

637
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,834
What the hell is
going on out here?

638
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:02,202
Oh no.

639
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:05,540
Not again.

640
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,577
Put up your hands and step
away from the flagpole please.

641
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:12,614
Come on, over here.

642
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:17,018
Jesus, Roger, ow!

643
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,519
Freeze.

644
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,656
I'm just gonna head out, too.

645
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:24,324
Ah.

646
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,695
For God sake, Roger, what
the hell are you doing?

647
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:29,296
Just chilling.

648
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,798
No you're not.

649
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:32,867
Get up.

650
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,469
Tired, long day.

651
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:36,704
Just taking a nap, buddy.

652
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:38,740
Come
on, let's go, up.

653
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:39,674
Just don't.

654
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:41,509
Oh.

655
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:42,610
Oh! Roger.

656
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:44,244
What was that?
Was there an animal?

657
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:48,816
I think there's an
animal behind me.

658
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,685
A muddy animal.

659
00:35:51,886 --> 00:35:52,720
Hello.

660
00:35:55,923 --> 00:35:57,224
What's up, Mr. Simmons?

661
00:35:57,357 --> 00:35:59,727
This is not what it looks like.

662
00:35:59,861 --> 00:36:02,362
Looks like you're flouncing
around for the camera.

663
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:05,033
God, you're smart. That's
exactly what this is.

664
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,568
Here I am, trying to
sleep, and I can't get a wink

665
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:09,570
because you hooligans
are traipsing around

666
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:11,438
in my beautifully
manicured grounds.

667
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:13,340
You think this is some sort

668
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:16,410
of Midwestern
putt-putt fun center?

669
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:20,114
This golf course costs
more than your life.

670
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:25,520
Fine, I'll take
full responsibility.

671
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:28,388
It was Tina's idea.

672
00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:30,858
Yeah, you think I don't
know that you don't have

673
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:33,260
the wherewithal to
orchestrate anything?

674
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:37,397
Go lick your wounds, elsewhere.

675
00:36:39,534 --> 00:36:41,903
Miss Cartwright? What
are you doing here?

676
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:42,970
Are you practicing?

677
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:44,204
- Yes.
- At midnight?

678
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:45,305
Yes.

679
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:47,474
Well, big day tomorrow, ha ha.

680
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:48,341
You done?

681
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:49,409
- Yes.
- Okay.

682
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:50,978
You feeling good?

683
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:55,282
It's very important.
Everything's riding on this.

684
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:56,784
No, I'm kidding.

685
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:59,419
Everything's not riding on
it, but it is important.

686
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:02,690
Ugh.

687
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:10,397
What did you do to poor Roger?

688
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,667
We were doing a photo shoot.

689
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,001
With Roger?

690
00:37:14,135 --> 00:37:16,269
What, are you jealous?

691
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:18,940
Maybe, a little bit.

692
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:24,779
Come here, I wanna
show you something.

693
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:30,651
Oh, and get this. She
asked to remove the beret.

694
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:32,419
Yeah, I lost it.

695
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:33,855
That's unlike you.

696
00:37:33,988 --> 00:37:37,457
Ugh, I know. I was
pooping everywhere.

697
00:37:38,993 --> 00:37:41,495
Ooh, boy.

698
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:53,373
Oh my God.

699
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:59,981
200 calories left on my
dieting app for today.

700
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:03,618
Oh, two taquitos, please.

701
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,953
One and a half.

702
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:08,388
Guess I shouldn't
be eating this late?

703
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,794
Lumer, phone.

704
00:38:16,164 --> 00:38:18,199
Lumer, phone.

705
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:23,470
Hello, Lumer, phone!

706
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:28,042
Lumer.

707
00:38:32,246 --> 00:38:33,114
Hello.

708
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:34,081
<i>Hello.</i>

709
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,851
Daddy?

710
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,019
How's Antigua?

711
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:49,329
What?

712
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,533
Hey, I meant to talk
to you about something,

713
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:55,036
but I forget exactly.

714
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:56,369
What it was.

715
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,209
Coming in?

716
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:02,510
It's warm.

717
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:04,245
I don't think so.

718
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:06,446
How are you
liking Butlerbrick?

719
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:08,415
I love it.

720
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,350
You love it? Nobody
loves Butlerbrick.

721
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:11,986
It's iconic.

722
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,088
It's iconic?

723
00:39:14,222 --> 00:39:15,723
Maybe the golf tournament.

724
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:17,525
There's like 10
people signed up

725
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:19,160
for the junior tournament.

726
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:21,896
Not the junior tournament.
The junior tournament sucks.

727
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:23,931
Really?

728
00:39:24,065 --> 00:39:26,701
The junior tournament's just
there to get new families in,

729
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:29,436
you know, new blood with old
money like Granny Lynn money.

730
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,105
What is the deal
with Granny Lynn?

731
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,273
Like, what's with the fur?

732
00:39:32,405 --> 00:39:34,108
The fur, she's a legend.

733
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:35,076
It's 80 degrees outside.

734
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,544
She's a legend.

735
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:38,880
She can wear fur in the
summer if she wants.

736
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,148
She's got all that
cheese money, you know.

737
00:39:41,282 --> 00:39:42,216
What?

738
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,684
She's a cheese heiress.

739
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:45,119
I mean, her family
literally made their money

740
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:46,954
on the backs of smoked
Gouda and Parmesan.

741
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:48,155
Are you serious?

742
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:49,523
I'm serious.

743
00:39:49,657 --> 00:39:52,159
She used to come out
here every summer,

744
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:53,393
like a thousand different WASPS,

745
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:54,829
and they'd just party and rage,

746
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:56,631
and then she stopped
coming for some reason

747
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:59,466
and they all stopped coming too.

748
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,736
Now they all gather in
Westhampton every summer.

749
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:03,470
- Westhampton?
- Yeah, right.

750
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:05,373
Not even a real Hampton.

751
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:06,607
Can you help me out?

752
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:07,942
I wasn't born yesterday.

753
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,744
I'm freezing. Can
you just help me out?

754
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:10,645
No.

755
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:12,513
I'm not gonna pull you in.

756
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:14,315
Promise?

757
00:40:14,447 --> 00:40:15,616
Yeah, totally.

758
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:17,484
Please.

759
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:19,987
- Good.
- Thank you.

760
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,827
I lied, sorry.

761
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:29,864
Aren't you glad
you got in, though?

762
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,065
It's warm, right?

763
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:32,533
I pretty much knew
that was gonna happen.

764
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:33,868
Oh, you knew that
was gonna happen?

765
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,069
Mm-hm.

766
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:38,639
Did you? Are you a
psychic or something?

767
00:40:39,507 --> 00:40:40,508
Do you have ESP?

768
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:52,653
I was hoping for some hedge
fund new money, some Democrats.

769
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:54,989
Why?

770
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:56,991
Because otherwise
you wouldn't be here.

771
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:59,560
You don't know
anything about me.

772
00:41:01,162 --> 00:41:03,397
I know you're not a
Connecticut Cartwright.

773
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:05,967
I was kicked out
of the Daft School.

774
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:15,643
Where you going?

775
00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:28,456
Your secret's safe with me.

776
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:33,060
Come in.

777
00:41:41,202 --> 00:41:46,574
Why can't I work up the courage
to say hello to Winston?

778
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:53,447
Truthfully, it was so wonderful

779
00:41:53,581 --> 00:41:56,517
to catch a glimpse
of him at lunch.

780
00:41:58,185 --> 00:41:59,253
Mm.

781
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:04,291
Even though he got that gut now.

782
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:08,396
Oh, I wonder what he would
think of me.

783
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:11,365
Uh-huh, Nurse, are you there?

784
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:35,089
Oh.

785
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,025
My apologies, Madame.

786
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:52,773
Oh, shut the door, man.

787
00:42:56,977 --> 00:42:59,780
Least you got
the one good hand.

788
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:05,786
No!

789
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,215
All right.

790
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,186
Thank you, it's a beautiful day.

791
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,822
Very excited, just
a few announcements.

792
00:43:41,956 --> 00:43:45,860
Due to last year's incident
involving an unidentified

793
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:48,362
member who will not be
named, all caddies have been

794
00:43:48,496 --> 00:43:50,297
equipped with a life jacket,

795
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:54,068
should this function
be necessary.

796
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:55,169
Woo!

797
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:59,206
What happened,
with the life vest?

798
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,709
Players have been
paired by starting rank,

799
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:04,311
so number one with
number two and so on.

800
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:08,382
Excuse me, is this really
fiscally responsible?

801
00:44:08,517 --> 00:44:10,217
Why should we all have
the burden of extra weight

802
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:12,686
when only some of
us are incompetent?

803
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,389
Who cares if
you're incompetent?

804
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:18,025
As long as you're not impotent.

805
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:19,426
Excellent motto, Granny Lynn.

806
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:21,061
Boop, boop.

807
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:24,498
And due to a different
biohazard incident involving

808
00:44:24,633 --> 00:44:26,601
the same unidentified member,

809
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:28,769
we will not be
playing hole four.

810
00:44:28,903 --> 00:44:31,506
Play hole five twice.

811
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:33,874
I guess that's my bad.

812
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:35,510
Please stay hydrated.

813
00:44:35,644 --> 00:44:38,112
We have beverages courtesy
of the Northfield family.

814
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:39,079
Ugh.

815
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:41,749
Woo-hoo.

816
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:45,452
Thank you, okay.

817
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:46,887
Jesus, what's up your butt?

818
00:44:47,021 --> 00:44:49,056
There's been nothing
in my butt for weeks.

819
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,257
All right.

820
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:53,260
The diarrhea was a
psychosomatic issue.

821
00:44:57,566 --> 00:44:58,866
Thanks.

822
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:06,707
Caddy!

823
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:09,343
I don't know if this
is a competition thing,

824
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:10,711
because you're
being really rude.

825
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:12,379
Just trying to
do my job, Tina.

826
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:16,383
You know, be the best
accessory that I could be.

827
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:21,088
How's that working out?

828
00:45:22,223 --> 00:45:26,460
Lumer, move your bootay
souffle.

829
00:45:26,595 --> 00:45:28,663
Let the games begin.

830
00:45:40,675 --> 00:45:42,977
I know you're not supposed
to ask a woman for her age,

831
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,580
but, uh, are you in college?

832
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:47,682
You see, I'm 14 trying
to take applications

833
00:45:47,815 --> 00:45:49,783
- for a little side piece thing.
- His mom knows my mom. Sorry.

834
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:50,951
Think about it.

835
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:04,064
Keep your puppy on a leash.

836
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:07,968
You tapping that tonight?

837
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:10,804
Roger and Elsa?

838
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,975
Yeah, I thought Elsa
was dating her sister.

839
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:18,979
Gunter, I'm teeing off.

840
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:23,685
It's a conflict of interest.

841
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,220
I mean, there has to be
something in the rules

842
00:46:26,353 --> 00:46:28,389
about dating the competition.

843
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:30,592
Take a crack, young'un.

844
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:32,560
Lick my crack, old man.

845
00:46:32,694 --> 00:46:33,628
Well.

846
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:41,603
Duck hook.

847
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:44,004
Quack, quack.

848
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:55,082
No caddy, Mary-Anne?

849
00:46:55,215 --> 00:46:57,117
Isn't that what
golf carts are for?

850
00:46:57,251 --> 00:46:59,420
I thought at least
my mom would show.

851
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,088
Should I go first?

852
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:04,224
Whatever, Mary-Anne.
Free country.

853
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,000
Will you tee off for me?

854
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:14,868
She's right there.

855
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:16,771
She will see us.

856
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:19,607
Oh my God, I hate
Mary-Anne so much.

857
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:20,841
I can hear you.

858
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:23,243
Good.

859
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:25,312
Then do you mind if
Lumer tees off for me?

860
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:27,816
What do I get in return?

861
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:29,350
Whatever you want.

862
00:47:31,085 --> 00:47:32,186
Tee for two?

863
00:47:32,721 --> 00:47:35,055
Oh, that's perfect.

864
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:37,491
That's actually a
really good idea.

865
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:39,426
There you go, buddy.

866
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:41,095
You love golf, yay.

867
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,098
Stay humble.

868
00:47:46,768 --> 00:47:49,103
And always move forward.

869
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,572
All right, you got it.

870
00:47:57,411 --> 00:47:59,880
Remember, eye on the prize.

871
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,538
Playing the fifth hole
twice is getting crowded.

872
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:57,505
Yeah.

873
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,312
I like her butt when she putt.

874
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:07,948
Not looking too fierce.

875
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:09,983
Hey, I made this.

876
00:49:10,984 --> 00:49:11,985
The competition.

877
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,460
You a good golfer?

878
00:49:19,594 --> 00:49:20,562
Yeah, you?

879
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:23,798
I'm good, just not like,
interested in getting better.

880
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:32,807
One, two, three.

881
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,041
Three, three.

882
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:35,610
- Three.
- Three.

883
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,177
Yeah.

884
00:49:57,799 --> 00:49:58,566
- Bravo.

885
00:50:00,902 --> 00:50:01,703
Bravo.

886
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:06,608
Is it snack time yet?

887
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:09,243
God help me. I will
turn this cart around.

888
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:10,945
- Please.
- Please.

889
00:50:11,078 --> 00:50:12,279
I'm the only one
doing any golfing here.

890
00:50:12,412 --> 00:50:14,047
Not that anybody would know.

891
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:17,417
Because nobody's here,
and nobody cares.

892
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:18,686
I care.

893
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,788
I really don't care
if you care, Mary-Anne.

894
00:50:20,922 --> 00:50:21,856
Okay, fine then, I don't care.

895
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,891
Fine, that's great.

896
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:23,791
Fine.

897
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:24,893
I'm glad we agree.

898
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:26,159
Why are you so mean about it?

899
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:27,562
I'm not being mean.
I'm just hungry.

900
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:29,631
Carbs or fruit?

901
00:50:29,764 --> 00:50:30,698
Fruit.

902
00:50:34,602 --> 00:50:35,603
Yay, thanks.

903
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,774
Can I have some?

904
00:50:39,908 --> 00:50:40,775
Yeah.

905
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,376
Good luck, buddy.

906
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:56,323
Whoa ho ho, nice job.

907
00:50:56,456 --> 00:50:59,493
I guess you don't miss 100%
of the shots you don't take.

908
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:07,936
What the hell?

909
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:09,771
That was funny.

910
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:11,639
Hey, good job.

911
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,709
That was good stuff.

912
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,413
Woo!

913
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:02,322
Trade?

914
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:07,595
Wait, what?

915
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:09,530
You golfed better for
Roger than for me?

916
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:13,001
Nice, take
that, Northfield.

917
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,870
You know what? I quit.

918
00:52:16,004 --> 00:52:17,872
Wait, Mary-Anne, Mary-Anne.

919
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:19,907
I just golfed 18 holes for you.

920
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:21,341
Whatever, Lumer.

921
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:24,679
What does that mean?

922
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:27,015
It means lunch.
Let's go to lunch.

923
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:29,884
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ho ho ho!

924
00:52:30,018 --> 00:52:31,819
You look rough.

925
00:52:31,953 --> 00:52:34,856
Not as rough as hole four
after you pooped on it.

926
00:52:34,989 --> 00:52:37,224
You guys were supposed
to play hole five twice.

927
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:38,860
There's nothing wrong
with a round two.

928
00:52:38,993 --> 00:52:40,128
Slut.

929
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,229
All right, enough.
I have to go.

930
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:44,032
What, go poo-poo?

931
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:46,834
At least I have a real caddy.

932
00:52:47,568 --> 00:52:49,169
Everybody knows Gunter
here doesn't even

933
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:50,705
belong to this country club.

934
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:57,578
Roger, can we go to lunch?

935
00:52:57,712 --> 00:52:59,413
Caddy, I'm trying
to make a point.

936
00:52:59,747 --> 00:53:01,983
You see, I have a
real-life caddy.

937
00:53:02,315 --> 00:53:04,952
One that was born a caddy.

938
00:53:05,086 --> 00:53:06,721
I wasn't born a caddy.

939
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:08,288
Lumer, chill.

940
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:11,291
Look, man, I just golfed
18 holes for you and 18 holes

941
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:12,994
for Mary-Anne, and
you don't care.

942
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:14,529
I'm exhausted.

943
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:16,564
And I heard you agree with Tina.

944
00:53:16,698 --> 00:53:19,266
I'm just an accessory,
so, you know what, man?

945
00:53:20,668 --> 00:53:24,038
If I'm that disposable to you,
then good luck without me.

946
00:53:24,337 --> 00:53:25,506
What are you doing?

947
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,053
I know a better
way to get wet.

948
00:53:39,419 --> 00:53:41,122
Leaving the luncheon already?

949
00:53:41,254 --> 00:53:44,224
Yeah, you'll learn
that country club
food is not the best.

950
00:53:44,592 --> 00:53:45,793
Meeting some friends for lunch.

951
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:50,330
Your, uh, your Uber's here.

952
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
That's my driver.

953
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:53,634
See ya.

954
00:53:53,768 --> 00:53:54,602
Yep.

955
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:17,525
Hey, I tried texting you,
but that tween took my phone

956
00:54:17,658 --> 00:54:19,827
for not being in
a cellphone room.

957
00:54:20,695 --> 00:54:22,764
I wouldn't have been
able to answer anyways,

958
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:24,899
unless I was also
in a cellphone room.

959
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:26,200
So.

960
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,635
Okay, that doesn't
make any sense.

961
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:28,970
I mean, doesn't that
mean we'll just end up

962
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:32,472
having a face-to-face
conversation?

963
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:34,108
I think that's
sort of the point.

964
00:54:34,742 --> 00:54:37,779
Hey, I wanted
to say I'm sorry.

965
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:41,215
I didn't mean all that stuff
about you being an accessory.

966
00:54:41,348 --> 00:54:43,618
I don't think that about you.

967
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:46,554
I'm starving.

968
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:48,990
Do you wanna?

969
00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:50,258
No, I'll see you in there.

970
00:54:50,423 --> 00:54:51,959
Roger's driving me
absolutely crazy,

971
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:54,195
so I'm gonna take a five.

972
00:54:54,327 --> 00:54:56,496
Take a five, and take a 10.

973
00:54:56,631 --> 00:54:58,498
Okay, see you there.

974
00:55:01,836 --> 00:55:03,303
Okay, sweet.

975
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:05,540
- Okay.
- All right, yeah.

976
00:55:05,673 --> 00:55:07,141
What the hell am I doing?

977
00:55:50,284 --> 00:55:51,552
Hello, Mommy.

978
00:55:54,755 --> 00:55:56,791
Didn't see you at
the tournament today.

979
00:55:56,924 --> 00:56:01,062
Oh, traffic from
Southampton was horrid.

980
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:03,363
Why can't I stay
in Southampton?

981
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:04,999
Darling, you know, I told you.

982
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:07,034
The Winthrops have so many
guests already this summer.

983
00:56:07,168 --> 00:56:09,436
But don't worry, we'll
be back in our own home

984
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,438
just as soon as your
father's name is cleared.

985
00:56:11,572 --> 00:56:12,573
Mm-mm.

986
00:56:16,143 --> 00:56:20,882
Now, I want you to make
a good impression, mmkay?

987
00:56:21,015 --> 00:56:25,119
Because we don't
exactly have the highest

988
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:27,121
reputation right now.

989
00:56:27,255 --> 00:56:29,891
I also want you to be a
good boy, and to help string

990
00:56:30,024 --> 00:56:33,127
some of the lanterns
along the table, Roger!

991
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:36,564
And then, I want you
to help the servers

992
00:56:36,697 --> 00:56:40,167
to light the, oh,
the purple ones.

993
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:43,537
To light the food troughs.

994
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,911
Thanks for asking how the
tournament's going. Not!

995
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:54,615
Okay.

996
00:56:58,386 --> 00:56:59,320
Hello.

997
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:00,621
Ooh.

998
00:57:00,755 --> 00:57:03,557
Hi, for those of
you who don't know me,

999
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:07,962
I'm Frances Kowalski, but
you may call me Fanny.

1000
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:13,567
As the parent coordinator
for this year's Labor Day

1001
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:15,236
junior golf tournament--

1002
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:22,310
It makes me and my
son Roger so happy

1003
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:24,011
to have a sense of community.

1004
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:35,022
Myself and Roger appreciate
community so much.

1005
00:57:36,424 --> 00:57:37,625
Right now.

1006
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:40,561
Everyone knows my
son Roger, right?

1007
00:57:40,695 --> 00:57:42,363
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

1008
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:43,998
One sec.

1009
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:49,303
To community.

1010
00:57:49,437 --> 00:57:52,073
- To community.
- Community.

1011
00:57:54,008 --> 00:57:56,711
Oh no, don't toast with
water, it's bad luck.

1012
00:57:57,445 --> 00:57:58,579
Cheers.

1013
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:00,314
Cheers, too.

1014
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:01,649
Hello.

1015
00:58:01,782 --> 00:58:02,316
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1016
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,384
One sec.

1017
00:58:03,517 --> 00:58:04,552
You still there?

1018
00:58:09,957 --> 00:58:11,058
Daddy!

1019
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:12,793
<i>How's the big</i>
<i>tournament going?</i>

1020
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:14,095
It's um.

1021
00:58:19,934 --> 00:58:22,069
<i>It's going well, I hope.</i>

1022
00:58:22,203 --> 00:58:24,905
It's uh, it's going.

1023
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,745
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1024
00:58:31,746 --> 00:58:32,980
<i>Roger?</i>

1025
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:35,082
Betrayal.

1026
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:38,586
Hello!

1027
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:43,391
I'd like to make a
toast too, as well.

1028
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:45,059
Roger, honey, come sit down.

1029
00:58:45,192 --> 00:58:45,960
Not now, boy.

1030
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:47,395
Yes, now, boy.

1031
00:58:47,928 --> 00:58:51,999
My own mommy, Frances Kowalski,

1032
00:58:52,466 --> 00:58:55,202
is so obsessed with
having everything all--

1033
00:58:55,336 --> 00:58:56,604
Are you listening?

1034
00:58:56,737 --> 00:58:58,539
Why are you eating?

1035
00:58:59,273 --> 00:59:02,710
My mommy, right there, is
so obsessed with having it

1036
00:59:02,843 --> 00:59:05,646
all figured out, doing
everything for herself,

1037
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,982
that she's abandoned me.

1038
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:09,518
That is not true.

1039
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,652
We still have a
staff in the city.

1040
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:13,888
Cheers to being a
terrible mommy, Mommy.

1041
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:17,224
Roger? Is this because
you're not winning?

1042
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:18,626
How would you even know?

1043
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:20,127
You haven't even been
to the tournament.

1044
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:21,929
Roger, Fanny's
been a part of it.

1045
00:59:22,063 --> 00:59:24,965
- She was at Elsa's
first-hole tee-off.
- Well--

1046
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,634
What the H?

1047
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:27,635
Roger.

1048
00:59:27,768 --> 00:59:30,104
Are you H'ing me?

1049
00:59:31,272 --> 00:59:33,240
Oh my A.

1050
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:36,243
Traitor, traitor.

1051
00:59:36,377 --> 00:59:37,111
Please.

1052
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:37,978
You too, old man.

1053
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:38,813
Hey.

1054
00:59:38,946 --> 00:59:40,147
Traitor.

1055
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:41,582
Roger.

1056
00:59:43,684 --> 00:59:45,119
Do you feel better now?

1057
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:46,620
You're a traitor!

1058
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:48,389
Roger,
that's enough.

1059
00:59:48,523 --> 00:59:50,257
All right, Roger,
that's enough.

1060
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:57,364
I'm gonna set myself on fire.

1061
00:59:57,498 --> 00:59:59,066
- Okay.
- Settle down.

1062
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:01,202
Roger.

1063
01:00:01,335 --> 01:00:02,571
God, I'm gonna do
it! I'm gonna do it.

1064
01:00:02,703 --> 01:00:04,972
I'm gonna do it.

1065
01:00:05,106 --> 01:00:07,509
I'm gonna do it, I'm
gonna set myself on fire!

1066
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:09,076
Ah!

1067
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,244
There's a snake.

1068
01:00:10,377 --> 01:00:12,346
Ow, ow!

1069
01:00:12,713 --> 01:00:15,182
Ow, I'm suffocating.

1070
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:16,784
I don't like it.

1071
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:18,853
This is it for me.

1072
01:00:21,655 --> 01:00:22,690
Bye.

1073
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:41,008
What a wonderful
performance, so passionate.

1074
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:43,210
Everyone, go back to your lunch.

1075
01:00:43,344 --> 01:00:44,845
Bravo, bravo.

1076
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:46,847
He's high-strung.

1077
01:00:47,516 --> 01:00:49,450
No, somebody's in there.

1078
01:00:57,024 --> 01:00:58,993
Why don't you have a seat?

1079
01:00:59,894 --> 01:01:01,829
All right, very good.

1080
01:01:05,733 --> 01:01:07,034
What about
the tournament?

1081
01:01:07,168 --> 01:01:09,503
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Elsa Cartwright.

1082
01:01:09,638 --> 01:01:10,572
And who are you?

1083
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:12,072
I'm Elsa Cartwright.

1084
01:01:12,206 --> 01:01:14,241
Someone here is
pretending to be me.

1085
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:18,245
Which one of you
is @RogerThatZaddy?

1086
01:01:18,913 --> 01:01:20,381
Roger Kowalski?

1087
01:01:22,183 --> 01:01:24,118
He tagged me in a
picture on Instagram

1088
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:26,253
with the caption,
Love at First Sight.

1089
01:01:26,387 --> 01:01:27,922
My beautiful girlfriend
Elsa Cartwright

1090
01:01:28,055 --> 01:01:29,591
of the Connecticut Cartwrights.

1091
01:01:29,723 --> 01:01:31,593
I was giving a bath
to a rescue goat

1092
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:32,760
when I got the notification.

1093
01:01:32,893 --> 01:01:35,896
Obviously, this is not me.

1094
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,804
What she said is true.

1095
01:01:43,938 --> 01:01:47,942
Well, my name is also
Elsa Cartwright, but

1096
01:01:48,075 --> 01:01:49,910
I pretended to be you.

1097
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:56,717
I did it because I don't
have any money for college.

1098
01:01:58,452 --> 01:02:00,754
I work at a driving
range in New Haven,

1099
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:03,090
and your invitation
was sent there,

1100
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:05,960
so I thought it was for me.

1101
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:10,431
I thought this was my chance.

1102
01:02:11,465 --> 01:02:13,400
That I wouldn't be
judged by my clothes

1103
01:02:13,535 --> 01:02:17,938
or by my neighborhood, but
by my skill as a golfer.

1104
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,809
By the time I realized
it was a mistake,

1105
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:23,844
I couldn't walk away.

1106
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:26,780
I'm sorry.

1107
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:32,820
I for one think
you should stay,

1108
01:02:34,088 --> 01:02:36,591
and finish the remainder
of the tournament.

1109
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:41,495
I'm sorry, no. You're
obviously a wannabe.

1110
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:56,977
Well, what's
Labor Day out east

1111
01:02:57,111 --> 01:02:58,912
without a little scandal, right?

1112
01:02:59,614 --> 01:03:01,181
Whose side are you on?

1113
01:03:02,216 --> 01:03:03,585
Yours.

1114
01:03:03,718 --> 01:03:06,554
I just, I thought your family
was known for their charity.

1115
01:03:17,364 --> 01:03:18,198
Oh.

1116
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:26,541
What have I told you about
serving minors, Winston?

1117
01:03:26,675 --> 01:03:28,543
Oh, posh.

1118
01:03:28,677 --> 01:03:31,979
I was crawling myself out
of a barrel of Guinness

1119
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:34,181
before I had my
first pubic hair.

1120
01:03:34,315 --> 01:03:39,320
You were a good time back
then, Winston.

1121
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:47,127
Oh, Winston.

1122
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:51,198
I came back here
looking for excitement.

1123
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:54,902
But just now when
that Kowalski boy

1124
01:03:55,035 --> 01:03:57,838
almost set himself on fire ...

1125
01:03:58,372 --> 01:03:59,541
Hello.

1126
01:04:00,074 --> 01:04:04,111
I realized that
the only excitement

1127
01:04:04,244 --> 01:04:08,248
I ever really missed was you.

1128
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:13,854
I've never been one
for monotony, monot--

1129
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:15,255
Monogamy.

1130
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:16,758
Same thing.

1131
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:20,628
I should have done
this long ago.

1132
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:29,436
- One.
- One.

1133
01:04:29,571 --> 01:04:30,638
- Two.
- Two.

1134
01:04:30,772 --> 01:04:33,140
- Three.
- Three.

1135
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:34,875
Yeah.

1136
01:04:35,242 --> 01:04:39,079
Winston, will you marry me?

1137
01:04:40,414 --> 01:04:41,248
Oh.

1138
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,411
Hey, what's going on?

1139
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:12,647
I have good news,
Cartwrights from Connecticut.

1140
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,749
You guys can stay.

1141
01:05:15,315 --> 01:05:17,117
Yeah, I talked to the
other Elsa and I told her

1142
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:19,153
the only thing worse
than being talked about

1143
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:20,187
is not being talked about.

1144
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,656
And that works?

1145
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:25,092
Yes, that and I offered
to show her around.

1146
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:31,965
You're welcome, you
little troublemakers.

1147
01:05:39,774 --> 01:05:42,042
I'll catch up with you.

1148
01:05:43,177 --> 01:05:45,479
Hey, you okay?

1149
01:05:47,816 --> 01:05:49,584
Lumer has resigned.

1150
01:05:58,827 --> 01:06:00,360
The storm is passing.

1151
01:06:02,496 --> 01:06:05,165
How am I gonna get myself
dressed for the tournament?

1152
01:06:06,668 --> 01:06:09,871
Yeah, you can't go
out in that bathrobe.

1153
01:06:10,003 --> 01:06:12,507
It's too Harvey Weinstein.

1154
01:06:14,509 --> 01:06:17,177
Okay, don't worry. Let's see.

1155
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:22,884
Look!

1156
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:23,852
Hey.

1157
01:06:33,962 --> 01:06:34,995
Macaw!

1158
01:06:51,779 --> 01:06:53,213
Granny Lynn?

1159
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:19,239
No Service!

1160
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,285
What are you doing here?

1161
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:33,253
Texting you.

1162
01:07:34,288 --> 01:07:36,123
What are you doing here?

1163
01:07:37,157 --> 01:07:38,760
Yeah, I was gonna text you.

1164
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:41,461
Oh, really?

1165
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:44,599
What did you wanna say?

1166
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:48,302
Yeah, some girl, she

1167
01:07:49,136 --> 01:07:50,805
commented on Roger's post,

1168
01:07:50,939 --> 01:07:52,139
that she's coming here.

1169
01:07:52,272 --> 01:07:54,876
Oh yeah, that actually
already happened.

1170
01:07:55,543 --> 01:07:59,814
Times at Butlerbrick
move fast, so, keep up.

1171
01:08:01,816 --> 01:08:02,984
Cool.

1172
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:05,285
So you're like not
getting thrown out?

1173
01:08:08,957 --> 01:08:09,791
Sweet.

1174
01:08:13,193 --> 01:08:14,494
What did you,

1175
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:17,599
what did you wanna say to me?

1176
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:20,233
You wanted--

1177
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:22,402
Oh you to, to you.

1178
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:54,201
Those are tough.

1179
01:09:33,273 --> 01:09:37,078
Ladies and gentlemen,
the homestretch.

1180
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,379
A few contenders have forfeited.

1181
01:09:39,514 --> 01:09:43,216
Mary-Anne Montreal
and Marshal Mayson.

1182
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:47,387
Also Granny Mary Lynn,
who asked me to read

1183
01:09:47,522 --> 01:09:50,390
her official
statement, and I quote.

1184
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:57,665
"I felt bad crushing the juniors
in their baby competition."

1185
01:10:00,168 --> 01:10:03,705
Look, I know that was
super quick, I just--

1186
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:05,540
It's been like a
like a long time.

1187
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:08,408
Can you help me
with something?

1188
01:10:28,162 --> 01:10:30,098
Roger's returns closet.

1189
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,999
Oh my God.

1190
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:33,768
Whenever he buys something
he doesn't like or it's like

1191
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:35,435
the wrong size, he acts
like he's gonna return it,

1192
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,337
but inevitably waits too
long, throws it in here

1193
01:10:37,471 --> 01:10:39,607
and pretends like
it never happened.

1194
01:10:40,808 --> 01:10:42,810
It's been such a long summer.

1195
01:10:42,944 --> 01:10:44,779
For a second, Roger got
really into wakeboarding.

1196
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:46,681
Can't imagine he'd
be very good at that.

1197
01:10:46,814 --> 01:10:49,249
He realized that as soon
as he got into the boat.

1198
01:11:50,711 --> 01:11:51,612
Wand me.

1199
01:11:54,182 --> 01:11:56,984
And now for the dark horse

1200
01:11:57,118 --> 01:12:00,855
of the tournament,
Ms. Cartwright.

1201
01:12:13,668 --> 01:12:16,737
That was a major mistake
for young Cartwright.

1202
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:20,174
She's gonna have to
hit a three-wood here.

1203
01:12:22,543 --> 01:12:25,546
She's hitting a
driver off the deck.

1204
01:12:28,549 --> 01:12:33,353
Ugh, did anybody else get
a whiff of that whiff?

1205
01:12:34,055 --> 01:12:34,655
Terrible.

1206
01:12:35,656 --> 01:12:38,559
One more try for
Miss Cartwright.

1207
01:12:56,744 --> 01:12:59,446
Just as I thought,
southwesterly.

1208
01:13:05,753 --> 01:13:07,855
My mistake, it's just westerly.

1209
01:13:08,756 --> 01:13:13,828
Coincidentally, this
is the same position

1210
01:13:14,262 --> 01:13:17,131
Mr. Kowalski held at this time

1211
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:21,468
as he was about to clinch
last year's tournament,

1212
01:13:21,602 --> 01:13:25,006
and we all know how that ended.

1213
01:13:25,373 --> 01:13:27,909
There's grass on
the ball, ha ha.

1214
01:13:29,277 --> 01:13:30,945
Okay, here we go, woo!

1215
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:36,617
Lumer!

1216
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:40,121
You came back.

1217
01:14:19,093 --> 01:14:23,130
Mr. Kowalski, please
clear the premises,

1218
01:14:23,264 --> 01:14:26,734
so we can continue
the tournament.

1219
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:30,503
Lumer, Lumer, something
grave has happened.

1220
01:14:30,638 --> 01:14:32,573
Take me to the pool house.

1221
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:48,022
Wait, Lumer.

1222
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:51,726
Sorry I hurt your feelings.

1223
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:54,695
You're my best friend.

1224
01:14:56,364 --> 01:14:57,698
I'm your only friend.

1225
01:14:58,498 --> 01:14:59,433
Onward.

1226
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:06,774
Oh.

1227
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:08,542
Daddy?

1228
01:15:08,676 --> 01:15:10,044
Oh.

1229
01:15:10,177 --> 01:15:12,046
Wheel me away.

1230
01:15:13,914 --> 01:15:14,882
Hey, no!

1231
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:16,717
Oh my God.

1232
01:15:17,218 --> 01:15:18,219
Whoa.

1233
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,791
That was
literally my family,

1234
01:15:23,924 --> 01:15:25,359
like all the little
ice coffee shit

1235
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:26,293
that like hipsters drink--

1236
01:15:26,427 --> 01:15:27,628
Is somebody coming?

1237
01:15:27,762 --> 01:15:30,765
My grandpa invented
that. It's crazy.

1238
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,735
I promise. This is not a morgue.

1239
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,539
What are they doing?

1240
01:15:42,743 --> 01:15:44,278
This is my spot.

1241
01:15:44,412 --> 01:15:46,647
Oh, we were just leaving.

1242
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:48,215
Just looking for, um,

1243
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,786
decorations for a junior formal.

1244
01:15:51,919 --> 01:15:53,888
Yeah, I put the
decorations outside

1245
01:15:54,021 --> 01:15:55,423
because Simmons kept
walking in on me.

1246
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:57,391
Oh sweet, well,
that makes sense.

1247
01:15:57,526 --> 01:15:59,693
Do you wanna, let's head out?

1248
01:15:59,827 --> 01:16:01,595
We'll head out back, okay?

1249
01:16:01,729 --> 01:16:02,763
Cool.

1250
01:16:06,067 --> 01:16:07,201
Bye.

1251
01:16:24,752 --> 01:16:28,355
Thank you so much. I
love you all, thank you.

1252
01:16:36,831 --> 01:16:40,668
Do as I say,
Petey. Victor Simmons.

1253
01:16:46,674 --> 01:16:49,710
Hidden in plain
sight, bastard.

1254
01:16:49,844 --> 01:16:51,679
You have
to tell your mom.

1255
01:16:53,914 --> 01:16:55,282
Oh my God, he's calling me.

1256
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:56,350
Don't answer it.

1257
01:16:56,484 --> 01:16:57,318
Stop.

1258
01:17:02,656 --> 01:17:03,891
That's good.

1259
01:17:04,024 --> 01:17:06,160
Oh shoot. Will you
go get that for me?

1260
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:08,362
I didn't back it up.

1261
01:17:08,496 --> 01:17:09,697
Thank you, buddy.

1262
01:17:17,338 --> 01:17:20,040
Next
up, Ms. Cartwright.

1263
01:17:20,174 --> 01:17:24,912
Can she eagle this hole
and win, or will the rains

1264
01:17:25,045 --> 01:17:27,882
continue to get
the better of her?

1265
01:18:38,786 --> 01:18:40,287
I hate him.

1266
01:18:40,421 --> 01:18:43,023
No, no no no no no no.

1267
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:46,126
I married wrong.

1268
01:18:47,094 --> 01:18:51,165
Roger, honey, your father
has always been a sociopath.

1269
01:18:51,298 --> 01:18:55,035
I mean, he was
wild and handsome.

1270
01:18:56,136 --> 01:18:58,205
But he was also off.

1271
01:18:59,139 --> 01:19:00,941
It was part of his charm.

1272
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:08,249
He strangled a ferret to death

1273
01:19:08,617 --> 01:19:11,986
at his fraternity when he was
in college, for no reason.

1274
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,188
They got it as a mascot,

1275
01:19:14,321 --> 01:19:16,156
and then it ended up
being too much work.

1276
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,958
Well the president
said get rid of it,

1277
01:19:18,092 --> 01:19:20,160
and he meant take it
back to the pet store.

1278
01:19:20,294 --> 01:19:24,498
But your father killed it,
with his own bare hands.

1279
01:19:25,866 --> 01:19:28,670
That shoulda been
the first red flag.

1280
01:19:28,802 --> 01:19:30,804
But I was in love.

1281
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:34,208
I thought, what's
one ferret's life

1282
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:36,377
in the grand scheme
of a relationship?

1283
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,514
Hm.

1284
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:43,618
I'm sorry I didn't
come see you play.

1285
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:48,055
I was so busy keeping
up appearances,

1286
01:19:48,657 --> 01:19:50,525
putting on a good face.

1287
01:19:50,659 --> 01:19:52,226
Your face looks fine.

1288
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:54,328
Mm, Botox.

1289
01:19:55,229 --> 01:19:55,863
Mommy?

1290
01:19:56,864 --> 01:19:59,133
Did you mean what you said
when I was in the bathroom?

1291
01:20:00,602 --> 01:20:02,836
No, somebody's in there.

1292
01:20:03,705 --> 01:20:05,372
That somebody was in there?

1293
01:20:05,507 --> 01:20:07,776
Somebody's in there.

1294
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:10,110
Do you really
think I'm a somebody?

1295
01:20:13,881 --> 01:20:15,015
Yes, dear.

1296
01:20:15,784 --> 01:20:18,185
I think you're a somebody.

1297
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:20,555
Now, go get cleaned up.

1298
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:23,490
I'll take care of this
pool house situation.

1299
01:20:34,636 --> 01:20:35,670
Oh.

1300
01:20:42,544 --> 01:20:43,911
There you are.

1301
01:20:44,044 --> 01:20:46,914
Now congratulations.

1302
01:21:09,903 --> 01:21:11,806
Excuse me. I'm the proprietor.

1303
01:21:20,615 --> 01:21:21,949
Excuse me.

1304
01:21:22,082 --> 01:21:23,618
Harboring a wanted
criminal is a felony.

1305
01:21:23,752 --> 01:21:25,185
Well, I know that.

1306
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:26,353
Let's go.

1307
01:21:26,487 --> 01:21:27,488
What does
that have to do with me?

1308
01:21:49,476 --> 01:21:52,446
Is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

1309
01:21:56,885 --> 01:21:58,986
There's always next year.

1310
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:01,321
Too bad about last year.

1311
01:22:01,455 --> 01:22:03,691
If only you hadn't
driven your golf cart--

1312
01:22:03,825 --> 01:22:04,659
Your elitism shines.

1313
01:22:04,793 --> 01:22:07,094
--into a lake.

1314
01:22:07,227 --> 01:22:09,396
Who would do
something that crazy?

1315
01:22:10,765 --> 01:22:12,466
Someone in love, that's who.

1316
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:14,968
In love.

1317
01:22:16,003 --> 01:22:20,508
I mean, people do crazy
things for love, don't they?

1318
01:22:22,142 --> 01:22:24,846
Like try and set
themselves on fire.

1319
01:22:24,978 --> 01:22:27,147
I'm gonna set myself on fire.

1320
01:22:27,281 --> 01:22:32,019
Or hit themselves on the
head with their own golf club.

1321
01:22:33,721 --> 01:22:35,189
Point taken.

1322
01:22:35,322 --> 01:22:39,159
So I thought to myself,
who does Roger love?

1323
01:22:40,994 --> 01:22:44,164
Then I realized,
Roger loves golf.

1324
01:22:45,365 --> 01:22:47,602
Then I remembered, oh, not, no.

1325
01:22:49,102 --> 01:22:51,539
Lumer does all the brunt work.

1326
01:22:51,673 --> 01:22:53,741
So then I thought,

1327
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:56,243
well, Roger must
love Cartwright.

1328
01:22:56,376 --> 01:22:58,145
I love my
girlfriend very much.

1329
01:22:58,278 --> 01:23:00,748
May I interest you
in a secret handshake?

1330
01:23:00,882 --> 01:23:02,983
But then, I remembered,

1331
01:23:03,116 --> 01:23:06,286
your girlfriend wasn't
around last year.

1332
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:08,155
Was she?

1333
01:23:08,288 --> 01:23:09,624
She was busy.

1334
01:23:09,757 --> 01:23:11,191
Yeah.

1335
01:23:12,694 --> 01:23:14,194
And then it hit me.

1336
01:23:15,697 --> 01:23:17,866
Roger loves me.

1337
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:20,367
Maybe I like sucking.

1338
01:23:22,637 --> 01:23:25,573
Are you in love with
me, Roger Kowalski?

1339
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:27,742
You said you
wanted to do this.

1340
01:23:27,876 --> 01:23:29,944
I say a lot of things.

1341
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:32,680
Don't just stand
there. Wash it off!

1342
01:23:32,814 --> 01:23:34,348
Ah, crap.

1343
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:37,050
Oh, fudge.

1344
01:23:38,151 --> 01:23:39,186
Hurry up.

1345
01:23:39,988 --> 01:23:40,822
Hurry up.

1346
01:23:41,856 --> 01:23:43,123
All you have
are energy drinks.

1347
01:23:43,257 --> 01:23:45,259
Oh, I don't drink
water anymore.

1348
01:23:45,392 --> 01:23:46,794
I'm trying to lose weight.

1349
01:23:46,928 --> 01:23:48,596
Sir, these are loaded
with sugar. You know that?

1350
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:51,766
Energy drinks are trendy,
and trendy people are skinny.

1351
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,801
I don't want you to
beat yourself up for it.

1352
01:23:53,935 --> 01:23:56,403
Just stop making those
mistakes, okay, buddy?

1353
01:23:56,538 --> 01:23:57,739
Oh, shoot.

1354
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,574
Oh.

1355
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:03,578
Just use the White's Wand.

1356
01:24:03,711 --> 01:24:05,279
We're gonna be good,
I'm not scared.

1357
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:07,147
It didn't work.

1358
01:24:07,281 --> 01:24:10,585
Aw, crap, we're
crap outta luck.

1359
01:24:10,718 --> 01:24:11,653
Get outta the way.

1360
01:24:11,786 --> 01:24:12,587
What are you doing?

1361
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,320
Get out of the way.

1362
01:24:13,453 --> 01:24:15,455
Get out of the way!

1363
01:24:24,999 --> 01:24:26,099
Shocking.

1364
01:24:27,035 --> 01:24:28,570
I hope he's okay.

1365
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,608
Feel my abs.

1366
01:24:33,741 --> 01:24:34,341
Really?

1367
01:24:34,474 --> 01:24:35,843
Go on, feel my abs.

1368
01:24:42,717 --> 01:24:43,483
Gunter!

1369
01:24:51,325 --> 01:24:55,162
I have a hard exterior,
but I'm gooey underneath.

1370
01:25:04,104 --> 01:25:05,840
My little lake leech.

1371
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:29,964
Oh, there they are.

1372
01:25:30,098 --> 01:25:31,733
Bravo.

1373
01:25:31,866 --> 01:25:33,367
Thank you for everything.

1374
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,136
What will happen to Butlerbrick?

1375
01:25:36,804 --> 01:25:39,707
I will be taking
over for my nephew.

1376
01:25:39,841 --> 01:25:41,174
And how about you?

1377
01:25:41,308 --> 01:25:44,411
What school have you
set your sights on?

1378
01:25:44,545 --> 01:25:48,181
Actually, I'd like to
stay here, if you'd let me.

1379
01:25:48,315 --> 01:25:50,217
As your golf pro.

1380
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:52,020
What about college?

1381
01:25:52,152 --> 01:25:53,888
I was told if I
didn't go to college

1382
01:25:54,022 --> 01:25:55,690
I'd never amount to anything.

1383
01:25:55,823 --> 01:25:56,891
But that's not true.

1384
01:25:57,692 --> 01:25:59,159
And if you let me stay here,

1385
01:25:59,292 --> 01:26:00,728
I can save this money
doing what I love.

1386
01:26:00,862 --> 01:26:02,462
The American dream.

1387
01:26:02,597 --> 01:26:03,731
Congrats.

1388
01:26:03,865 --> 01:26:05,566
You killed it. It was
definitely the outfit.

1389
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,534
Lucy?

1390
01:26:09,637 --> 01:26:11,906
Ladies, just a minute please.

1391
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,710
Ms. Cartwright here is going
to be our new golf pro.

1392
01:26:16,544 --> 01:26:19,446
So, perhaps a lesson?

1393
01:26:20,782 --> 01:26:21,314
Sure, why not?

1394
01:26:57,451 --> 01:27:00,454
You don't know this, but
I actually took up golfing

1395
01:27:00,588 --> 01:27:02,322
just to be near you.

1396
01:27:02,456 --> 01:27:04,125
I was always so jealous.

1397
01:27:04,257 --> 01:27:05,793
You're so much better than me.

1398
01:27:05,927 --> 01:27:06,861
You finally admit it.

1399
01:27:24,612 --> 01:27:26,681
I owe you an
apology, Cartwright.

1400
01:27:26,814 --> 01:27:29,584
You were just a casualty
on the battlefield of love.

1401
01:27:29,717 --> 01:27:32,452
It's okay, Roger. Friends?

1402
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,188
Friends.

1403
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:35,489
Proud of you.

1404
01:27:35,623 --> 01:27:37,992
Thanks, but it's
not the Super Bowl.
