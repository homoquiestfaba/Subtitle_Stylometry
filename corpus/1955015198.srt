1
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:24,298
Heard you shoot.

2
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,886
What was it?

3
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,711
Somethin' small n' fast.

4
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:42,512
Rabbit?

5
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:47,346
Maybe.

6
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,718
I don't know if it was
even really there.

7
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:57,130
Once that gun goes off,

8
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:00,987
everythin' livin' is gone.

9
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:07,815
Why's it so hard when the only thing
there's you and the rabbit?

10
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:13,404
The wood is big
and the rabbit's small.

11
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,634
Can I start?

12
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,810
Yes, we all goin' to.

13
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:28,997
I was asking my sister.

14
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:32,842
No need to talk
to Mad like that.

15
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:43,408
Don't you want to eat?

16
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,506
I'm cold.

17
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:17,380
What?
What is it?

18
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,438
I saw 'em.

19
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:26,566
Saw who?

20
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:31,144
Daddy and Nathaniel.

21
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:40,125
It's only a dream.

22
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:43,110
But I was right there.

23
00:11:49,394 --> 00:11:51,913
Go back to sleep.

24
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:57,782
I can't stop hopin'
they might come home.

25
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:06,215
Our father and brother
ain't desertin' no duty.

26
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:12,323
It was like it was
really happenin',

27
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:14,493
they needed me.

28
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:21,588
What happens when
you sleep ain't real.

29
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,235
Come here.
Come sleep next to me.

30
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:50,134
I look like her.

31
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,912
You do.

32
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:02,221
This dress feel so
nice on my skin.

33
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,238
Almost fits me now.

34
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:08,500
You should take it off.

35
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,083
But I just put it on.

36
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:18,792
Louise, I best not see
that dress movin' again.

37
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,219
Thought I told you
to take that off?

38
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,692
I didn't feel like it.

39
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,660
Louise, I'm asking you, please.

40
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:06,649
- Why you care so much?
- Because you gonna ruin it.

41
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:16,566
Don't feel like hoein'.

42
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:22,364
Don't like her lookin'
at me that way either!

43
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,192
Go change and come back to work.

44
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:37,751
She's the nigger,
she should do it.

45
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,673
Like I told you, Louise:

46
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,812
We all niggers now.

47
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,791
Augusta!

48
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,373
Louise!
What happened?

49
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:49,423
- Louise, what happened?
- Raccoon.

50
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,727
She was suppose to
be workin' with you!

51
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,675
I can't keep eyes
on her all the time.

52
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,551
There's work to do and sometimes
she's gotta learn what's right.

53
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,086
We best get her inside.

54
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:37,791
One, two, three.

55
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:45,483
We need medcin'.

56
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:49,257
Maybe they got somethin'
at the Weaver place.

57
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,972
Let me.

58
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,731
You should go.

59
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:01,948
Clara?

60
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:05,842
Hello?

61
00:20:08,112 --> 00:20:09,741
Mary?

62
00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:30,030
Clara?

63
00:20:38,477 --> 00:20:40,221
Mary?

64
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:47,413
Thank you, girl.

65
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:19,974
- Augusta.
- Caleb.

66
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,517
You shouldn't be here.

67
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:34,201
Have you seen anybody from out of the
Weaver place? Have you seen Clara?

68
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:36,520
Mary was the last one I saw.

69
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:38,295
Mary's dead.

70
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,290
No.

71
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:44,001
- Drank herself some poison.
- God forgive her.

72
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:46,242
She just sitting up there.

73
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:49,017
You come out here
just to tell me that?

74
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:54,711
No.
Louise. Raccoon bit her.

75
00:23:58,794 --> 00:24:02,298
You need to turn around
and get yourself out of here.

76
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:22,134
- Here.
- What's this for?

77
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,240
You'll know it soon enough.

78
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:42,064
Good girl.

79
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,286
I went to the Weaver place
lookin' for medicine.

80
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,824
Came here hopin' for better luck.

81
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:54,170
There ain't been medcin'
here in a long time.

82
00:24:56,736 --> 00:25:01,592
- You should go 'fore they sober up.
- I can't go back with nothin'.

83
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,273
Wait here.

84
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:48,038
- Thought you said there wasn't no...
- I wouldn't call that medcin'.

85
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:50,145
But it'll work?

86
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,839
It might work.

87
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,584
Where you ridin' to?

88
00:26:05,608 --> 00:26:07,865
Due east.
Night's ride.

89
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:10,872
- What you ridin'?
- A dead horse.

90
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:21,586
You're gettin' Captain.

91
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:25,173
He's a good horse.

92
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:29,242
Why are you bein'
so nice to me?

93
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:36,989
I knew your daddy.
He was a good man.

94
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:42,375
He was alright.

95
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:48,878
Hey, how much uh
that you gonna...

96
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:51,895
We're only savin' it for
someone who needs it.

97
00:26:57,463 --> 00:27:00,231
- I see you found more liquor.
- Sure thing.

98
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:03,638
Yeah.
Here you go.

99
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,705
Oh, what'd ya know?

100
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:15,448
Eh, Moses. This place is
luckier than we thought.

101
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:19,751
I didn't think they still made them...

102
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:23,287
... pretty as this.

103
00:27:32,404 --> 00:27:34,193
You comin' over?

104
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:42,423
Maybe later.

105
00:27:44,854 --> 00:27:47,554
- This' half empty!
- Yes.

106
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:52,104
I have got some more, yeah.
Plenty more at... back.

107
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:08,355
Go upstairs.

108
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:24,143
You boys hungry for me?

109
00:28:39,123 --> 00:28:42,461
I bet you want some too?
Hmm.

110
00:28:56,911 --> 00:28:59,088
Hey, where you goin', honey?

111
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:04,786
Ain't nothin' up there.

112
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,835
Better things to do with
your mouth than talk.

113
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:44,182
Don't think the dog
likes what you're doing.

114
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:47,332
From what I seen that dog
don't like much 'uh anything.

115
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:41,203
Battle.

116
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:42,792
What?

117
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:46,855
The dog.

118
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:51,501
His name is Battle.

119
00:30:52,932 --> 00:30:55,269
He sure sounds like one.

120
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:02,441
That's a mighty big horse
for a girl like you.

121
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:06,422
You go on now, Augusta.

122
00:31:10,153 --> 00:31:12,275
Some place you got to be?

123
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,881
I do.

124
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,906
All on your own?

125
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:21,278
No.
She's got people.

126
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:33,527
You should go.

127
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:39,528
Go on now.

128
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:51,517
Go.

129
00:31:52,903 --> 00:31:54,343
Go on.

130
00:32:22,286 --> 00:32:24,143
Don't cry.

131
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:32,190
You should try 'n sleep.

132
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,954
Don't want to.

133
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:40,804
I can just keep talkin' til you do...

134
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:46,440
I remember daddy tellin' a story
about a girl 'n her sister.

135
00:34:57,117 --> 00:35:00,449
A girl was goin' to
be killed by a king.

136
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:02,181
What king?

137
00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:06,795
- I don't know, some king somewhere.
- Why was he gonna kill her?

138
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:11,740
I guess she musta done
somethin' he didn't like.

139
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:13,458
Anyway.

140
00:35:13,782 --> 00:35:19,768
The whole town shows up for the
execution, includin' the girl's sister.

141
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:27,670
And the sister goes over
to the girl, who's crying now,

142
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:30,972
and she says,

143
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:35,425
"When the king asks you
if you have any last words,

144
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:39,052
you tell him that you want me
to tell you a story."

145
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:43,032
So the king asks
and the girl says,

146
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:47,025
"I want my sister
to tell me a story."

147
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:50,590
And the king grants the request.

148
00:35:51,498 --> 00:35:55,114
The sister gets up
to the girl.

149
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:59,711
She starts tellin' a story so good,

150
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:02,965
the king can't help himself but listen.

151
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:08,793
And dawn has come and gone
and now it's twilight.

152
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:12,840
And the whole town
is still standin' there

153
00:36:12,864 --> 00:36:16,952
stock still,
their hearts in their throats.

154
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:21,846
And all of a sudden,
at just the most excitin' part,

155
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:23,706
she stopped.

156
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:28,394
- Why?
- She says to the king,

157
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:34,152
"You want to know the end?
I'll tell you tomorrow.

158
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:37,585
If you give my sister
one more day."

159
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,793
Now the town's people know that mean
old king is goin' to kill 'em both for sure,

160
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:47,523
but the King,
needin' to know the end,

161
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,487
says yes.

162
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:53,423
What was the story she was tellin'?

163
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:56,791
I only remember the part
'bout he tellin' it.

164
00:36:57,561 --> 00:37:00,248
Did the king kill the girl after?

165
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:05,646
But, the next day, just as soon as
the sister finished telling that story,

166
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:10,532
she starts another one, and she
stops that one 'fore the best part.

167
00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:16,170
and the same thing happens
the next night

168
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:21,112
and the next night
and the next night

169
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:25,282
for near a thousand nights.

170
00:37:25,556 --> 00:37:28,014
What happens to the girl?

171
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:30,634
Well.

172
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,913
As long as her sister
kept tellin' stories,

173
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,498
she never dies.

174
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:42,710
And her sister...

175
00:37:47,317 --> 00:37:50,443
I think after she told
all those stories,

176
00:37:52,257 --> 00:37:54,719
the king married her.

177
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:21,268
Didn't know you needed
your mouth to walk proper.

178
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:25,849
If you were the one bit, we'd still be sitting
back at the whorehouse instead of moving.

179
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:30,657
I won't actually call
what you're doing moving.

180
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:34,804
- You sure we're going the right way?
- Road only goes one way.

181
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:39,041
You know as well as I do, you can
go any way you want to on a...

182
00:39:39,632 --> 00:39:41,170
On a what?

183
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:43,916
Road.

184
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:50,423
We're going the right way.

185
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:53,329
- Maybe we should stop a minute?
- Uh, Henry?

186
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:13,210
What's he got?

187
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:21,211
Looks like we're going
the right way after all.

188
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:06,378
Day's half over.

189
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:11,760
Didn't wanna wake you.
She up too?

190
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,764
No.

191
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:22,360
Comin' back to life ain't easy.
She needs the rest.

192
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:28,074
We got anything to drink?

193
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,869
Yeah.

194
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,239
Goat's milk.

195
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:39,273
That's not what I meant.

196
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:46,250
Gets easier the more you drink.

197
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:54,302
Gets real easier.

198
00:42:02,581 --> 00:42:05,541
I like the way I feel.

199
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:13,606
Bill was the only one
your Daddy let drink it.

200
00:42:13,637 --> 00:42:19,547
He used to come back
at night stinkin' and proud.

201
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:26,101
You was with him?
Bill?

202
00:42:27,188 --> 00:42:29,023
I was.

203
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,306
You wanted to have his babies.

204
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:35,512
Oh, lord.

205
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:47,414
You miss him?

206
00:42:49,836 --> 00:42:51,789
I do.

207
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:03,898
Was he...

208
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:09,052
Go on.

209
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,954
With this moonshine in me I'm fixed
to answer any question you got.

210
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:26,222
What's it feel like?

211
00:43:28,503 --> 00:43:30,163
You'll know.

212
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:31,911
What If I don't?

213
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:38,215
What if all the men
kill all the other men?

214
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:42,469
What if it's the end of the world
and we're the last ones left?

215
00:43:43,893 --> 00:43:46,356
It aint the end of the world.

216
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,432
Think 'bout all the women
sittin' in their houses.

217
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,405
Were supposed to be taken,
but aint.

218
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:57,365
Learned to shoot a gun
'fore they learned to bed.

219
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:01,664
Learned to be men
instead 'uh a wife.

220
00:44:11,547 --> 00:44:13,282
I'm hungry.

221
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,137
Did she say...

222
00:44:17,213 --> 00:44:18,992
...hungry.

223
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:28,355
- What did you say?
- I'm hungry.

224
00:44:29,954 --> 00:44:32,418
Say it again.

225
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:35,217
I'm hungry.

226
00:44:35,744 --> 00:44:38,289
- She is hungry!
- She is hungry!

227
00:44:40,036 --> 00:44:45,920
Im gonna cook you
somethin' so good, Louise.

228
00:44:46,043 --> 00:44:50,376
Come-back-from-the-dead stew,
that's what.

229
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,195
Come-back-from-the-dead stew!

230
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:56,235
Best stew I ever made.

231
00:45:48,628 --> 00:45:50,318
Fern.

232
00:46:12,467 --> 00:46:13,996
Hey.

233
00:46:14,974 --> 00:46:17,012
- Mad.
- What?

234
00:46:17,038 --> 00:46:18,563
Shhh.

235
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:24,494
- Why you wake me just to be quiet?
- Listen, just-just listen.

236
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,945
Probably a ghost.

237
00:46:33,365 --> 00:46:35,418
Come have a look with me?

238
00:47:30,391 --> 00:47:32,644
Who's firing?

239
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:36,119
Show yourself!

240
00:47:36,175 --> 00:47:37,806
Get inside!

241
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:39,989
Go, get inside now!

242
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:47,385
Louise, wake up!

243
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:49,278
- Louise, wake up!
- What's goin' on?

244
00:47:49,304 --> 00:47:52,913
We got men here.
They are soldiers. Yankees.

245
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:53,938
How you know that?

246
00:47:53,963 --> 00:47:57,309
You shot this dog!

247
00:47:59,567 --> 00:48:03,159
He was just a dog.

248
00:48:03,184 --> 00:48:06,271
Same as you and me.

249
00:48:06,295 --> 00:48:10,632
You went and shot him down.

250
00:48:10,657 --> 00:48:14,389
Couldn't let him be.

251
00:48:14,806 --> 00:48:21,202
And now there's no more drink.
And theres no more dog.

252
00:48:21,228 --> 00:48:28,920
We only have this gun.
And Im through with my song.

253
00:48:28,945 --> 00:48:30,994
We got any other guns?

254
00:48:32,914 --> 00:48:36,324
Downstairs.
In one of the drawers.

255
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,242
I'm goin' to go get
it and come back.

256
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:40,307
Let's get to the Keepin' Room.

257
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,809
We aint leavin' this house.

258
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,769
-Too many doors and windows and rooms.
- We goin' to fight.

259
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:46,965
I don't wanna fight.

260
00:48:47,503 --> 00:48:50,235
We can hide.
They don't know we here.

261
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,572
I just shot their dog,
they gonna come lookin'.

262
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,307
How you know what dog
belong to what Yankees?

263
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,230
'Cause they followed me.

264
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:01,952
Don't leave us.

265
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:04,733
We ain't goin' to wait all night.

266
00:49:04,913 --> 00:49:06,159
Augusta.

267
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:09,313
- You want them here?
- No.

268
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:14,150
Then I gotta go down.

269
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:28,007
Girl.

270
00:49:28,655 --> 00:49:30,842
Who else you got in there?
You got men?

271
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:33,036
Negros or cowards?

272
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:48,059
Girl!
Where are you?

273
00:51:39,744 --> 00:51:41,021
No!

274
00:51:41,762 --> 00:51:44,155
Moses!

275
00:51:44,278 --> 00:51:46,818
Moses!

276
00:51:52,074 --> 00:51:55,679
Help me!
Moses!

277
00:51:55,704 --> 00:51:58,211
- Sorry.
- Here.

278
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:05,398
Shhhhh.

279
00:52:10,342 --> 00:52:12,233
Why you naked?

280
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:16,394
There was a fire.
I had to put it out.

281
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:17,581
What?

282
00:52:17,606 --> 00:52:20,449
Get over here.
This is your gun.

283
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:22,297
I gotta reload.
Watch me and do as I do.

284
00:52:22,322 --> 00:52:25,728
Take the powder.
Take the powder, put it in.

285
00:52:25,753 --> 00:52:28,411
Take the ball,
put it in.

286
00:52:28,576 --> 00:52:30,221
Push it down.

287
00:52:32,976 --> 00:52:34,753
Pull this back.

288
00:52:35,846 --> 00:52:37,318
- You hold steady.
- All right.

289
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:39,043
And you pull this.

290
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:40,574
Yeah.
All right.

291
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:42,195
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

292
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:43,875
- You sure.
- Yes. Yes.

293
00:52:44,425 --> 00:52:45,967
Girl!

294
00:52:47,346 --> 00:52:49,222
Girl!

295
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:58,864
You got ten to come out
or were coming in.

296
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,012
One!

297
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:06,992
Two!

298
00:53:07,503 --> 00:53:09,523
Im gonna try n' draw 'em
away from the house.

299
00:53:09,548 --> 00:53:11,059
No, don't.
No.

300
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:12,791
You bar this door behind me.

301
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:15,990
If a man comes through,
no matter what, you shoot.

302
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,153
Four!

303
00:53:21,971 --> 00:53:23,679
Five!

304
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,751
Six!

305
00:53:35,605 --> 00:53:37,364
Seven!

306
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:44,896
Eight!

307
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:04,545
Nine!

308
00:54:15,856 --> 00:54:17,402
Ten!

309
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:21,702
Shhh.
Shhhh.

310
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,027
You followed me?

311
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:02,539
Yeah, I did.

312
00:55:05,757 --> 00:55:08,614
Why didn't you kill me
with Caleb and that woman?

313
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,757
I wanted to keep
you for a while.

314
00:57:09,086 --> 00:57:14,094
Damp powder.
Must be as old as this gun.

315
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:28,414
Something about you
makes me wanna..

316
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:31,708
sit down.

317
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:37,489
Then why you come
like you want a war?

318
00:57:42,775 --> 00:57:45,152
I dont know how to stop.

319
00:57:54,144 --> 00:57:56,139
Why don't you come on out?

320
00:57:58,818 --> 00:58:00,996
I wanna see you.

321
00:58:24,351 --> 00:58:27,208
Why dont we just
put down the guns?

322
00:58:30,268 --> 00:58:33,184
We can get a lot closer
without them.

323
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,286
Well.
Maybe it's just you and me now.

324
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:29,750
If you don't stand still,
I just might have to shoot you.

325
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:44,612
Quiet!

326
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:56,358
Don't make me hurt you.

327
01:03:35,567 --> 01:03:37,061
Go on.

328
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,275
At my second farm,

329
01:04:08,443 --> 01:04:11,514
there was this one shed
we wasn't allowed at.

330
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:15,463
All the other buildings
had their jobs.

331
01:04:15,994 --> 01:04:20,148
One for feed.
One for tools.

332
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:25,371
But there was this one shed
we was told never to go in.

333
01:04:25,722 --> 01:04:30,884
Not to play near it.
Not to get curious.

334
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:34,663
We made up all sorts of stories.

335
01:04:35,144 --> 01:04:39,193
Gold.
Ghosts.

336
01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:41,797
God.

337
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:50,885
Then, one day when I was 'bout ten
the man told me to go to the shed.

338
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:58,440
I was goin' to the shed.
I would get to know.

339
01:05:00,425 --> 01:05:05,487
I walked to the shed,
my heart comin' out my dress.

340
01:05:06,577 --> 01:05:10,442
I was gonna get to know.
I was gonna get to know.

341
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:14,528
I was gonna be the one
to tell all the others.

342
01:05:20,856 --> 01:05:22,802
I opened the door.

343
01:05:23,181 --> 01:05:27,115
Only thing in there was
a low cot and no windows.

344
01:05:28,474 --> 01:05:31,282
I stood there a minute
so unsure.

345
01:05:32,242 --> 01:05:34,331
So sad.

346
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:38,293
Wonderin' why we wasnt
supposed to know for so long.

347
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:45,411
And then the man come in.

348
01:05:46,757 --> 01:05:48,746
And he had me.

349
01:05:52,596 --> 01:05:56,074
He was so big
and I was so small.

350
01:05:57,226 --> 01:06:00,835
So small that I didnt even know
what was happenin'.

351
01:06:04,472 --> 01:06:09,398
That was the first time.
And there were many more.

352
01:06:14,244 --> 01:06:17,159
Some times they cut the baby out.

353
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:20,405
Other times, they keeps them.

354
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,480
I don't know where they are now.

355
01:06:32,532 --> 01:06:36,090
There are many kinds of
monsters in this world,

356
01:06:36,528 --> 01:06:39,434
you never know which one
goin' to be yours.

357
01:06:40,248 --> 01:06:42,659
Dont know what happened to mine.

358
01:06:42,831 --> 01:06:45,735
Probably died old and happy.

359
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:49,244
But yours...

360
01:06:51,253 --> 01:06:53,237
You killed him.

361
01:06:54,074 --> 01:06:56,376
- That right?
- Yes.

362
01:06:57,965 --> 01:07:00,420
Your monster's dead.

363
01:08:46,694 --> 01:08:48,953
You come back.

364
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:51,628
Yeah.

365
01:08:52,202 --> 01:08:55,554
I just wanted to hear
that old voice again.

366
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:04,052
It's over.

367
01:09:06,344 --> 01:09:10,368
- It's all over.
- What you mean?

368
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:14,420
You take shelter.

369
01:09:18,045 --> 01:09:20,000
They comin'.

370
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,078
They...

371
01:10:08,555 --> 01:10:10,381
Where is Augusta?

372
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,432
Mad?

373
01:10:57,423 --> 01:10:59,523
Whats goin' on?

374
01:11:03,747 --> 01:11:05,922
He come back.

375
01:11:12,139 --> 01:11:14,871
I aint angry with you, Augusta.

376
01:11:16,387 --> 01:11:19,850
I's angry 'cause I come close
to killin' him myself.

377
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:23,850
But we wanted him dead.

378
01:11:28,403 --> 01:11:31,206
He'd never forgiven me
if I's the one done it.

379
01:11:41,676 --> 01:11:46,484
When you gonna learn
what dont happen dont matter?

380
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:49,082
You just goes on.

381
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:11,298
Might be another man
out there want us dead.

382
01:12:12,887 --> 01:12:15,640
Aint no time
to think on love.

383
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:19,627
There is another man out there.

384
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,837
We aint goin' to wait for him.

385
01:12:27,994 --> 01:12:30,542
We goin' out there to hunt him.

386
01:12:31,936 --> 01:12:35,051
And we aint come back
'til he ours.

387
01:14:53,761 --> 01:14:56,188
This some fine moonshine.

388
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,639
Our daddy made it.

389
01:15:04,663 --> 01:15:07,411
Your daddy made
some fine moonshine.

390
01:15:14,484 --> 01:15:16,645
I've been waiting for you.

391
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:20,890
I've been looking for you.

392
01:15:22,052 --> 01:15:24,197
You found me.

393
01:15:36,595 --> 01:15:38,612
I like this room.

394
01:15:41,707 --> 01:15:43,543
I like it too.

395
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:52,520
What's your name?

396
01:15:58,872 --> 01:16:00,655
Moses.

397
01:16:02,796 --> 01:16:04,764
Like the baby.

398
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:08,315
Yes, just like.

399
01:16:12,752 --> 01:16:15,009
Why're you doin' this, Moses?

400
01:16:18,005 --> 01:16:21,069
Me an' him are bummers.
We...

401
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:29,587
We're sent ahead to forage
the land for food and deserters

402
01:16:30,047 --> 01:16:32,996
and survivors.

403
01:16:33,485 --> 01:16:40,731
Whole army is behind us.
Already took Georgia.

404
01:16:41,744 --> 01:16:44,207
Uncle Billy's coming.

405
01:16:44,444 --> 01:16:47,234
Burning down every thing
in his path.

406
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:52,127
Rest assured,
it'll be cruel.

407
01:16:53,930 --> 01:17:00,195
And the crueler it is
the sooner itll be over.

408
01:17:05,492 --> 01:17:07,413
We can hold 'em.

409
01:17:10,194 --> 01:17:12,505
Girl, I believe you can.

410
01:17:17,144 --> 01:17:21,057
You know how many
battles I fought in?

411
01:17:21,082 --> 01:17:24,033
Dont seem like many,
easy as you went down.

412
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:27,033
No.
It don't.

413
01:17:29,884 --> 01:17:31,871
But it was.

414
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:36,373
And yet, here I sit.

415
01:17:43,685 --> 01:17:48,159
Fuck.
You are beautiful.

416
01:17:55,027 --> 01:17:57,208
I'd like to know your name.

417
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:03,027
Augusta.

418
01:18:04,908 --> 01:18:06,746
Augusta.

419
01:18:09,278 --> 01:18:11,974
Augusta and Moses.

420
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,923
Things could have be different.

421
01:19:11,787 --> 01:19:13,734
But they ain't.

422
01:19:18,418 --> 01:19:20,590
I know that it's over.

423
01:19:23,127 --> 01:19:25,136
Truth be told,

424
01:19:28,518 --> 01:19:30,599
Im heartened.

425
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:37,170
Don't think I know
my way home from here.

426
01:19:45,502 --> 01:19:48,537
I'd appreciate it if you'd
show me the way.

427
01:20:11,594 --> 01:20:14,003
You 'bout finished with your drink?

428
01:20:18,519 --> 01:20:20,265
Just about.

429
01:21:39,081 --> 01:21:42,826
How strange he show up
here lookin' like a Yankee.

430
01:21:53,412 --> 01:21:55,582
Maybe he was free.

431
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:02,390
And he came back.

432
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:08,603
I didnt know people looked the same
whether they was dead or alive.

433
01:22:14,364 --> 01:22:16,488
He gone.

434
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,561
But he dont look so bad.

435
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,421
Like he's sleepin' maybe.

436
01:22:32,524 --> 01:22:34,796
He look dead.

437
01:22:37,408 --> 01:22:39,984
But he look good.

438
01:22:44,628 --> 01:22:48,091
You sure you dont wanna
dig him another hole?

439
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:55,398
Ain't time.
Ain't strength.

440
01:22:55,422 --> 01:22:58,697
Dont think he should go
in the same place as them.

441
01:23:01,404 --> 01:23:05,735
Dont worry.
They aint goin' to the same place.

442
01:23:47,028 --> 01:23:48,880
Augusta!

443
01:24:00,604 --> 01:24:03,516
Looks like the sky's on fire.

444
01:24:05,662 --> 01:24:08,368
Looks like the whole world's on fire.

445
01:24:11,896 --> 01:24:13,786
They comin'.

446
01:24:22,529 --> 01:24:24,399
This our home.

447
01:24:26,716 --> 01:24:28,604
We gonna have to fight.

448
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:35,034
This our home.

449
01:24:38,672 --> 01:24:40,689
We gonna defend it.

450
01:24:43,872 --> 01:24:46,363
What if we didnt stay here?

451
01:24:48,176 --> 01:24:50,090
What if we went?

452
01:24:50,501 --> 01:24:51,997
Went?

453
01:24:52,881 --> 01:24:54,640
Out there.

454
01:24:55,179 --> 01:24:56,635
No.

455
01:24:57,773 --> 01:25:02,104
All 'em Yankees walkin' right for us
we can't just walk right back.

456
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,243
They walkin' here on the way.

457
01:25:04,269 --> 01:25:07,600
I don't see what a few bullets
is gonna do to keep them out.

458
01:25:08,356 --> 01:25:10,564
We can keep it safe.

459
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:14,627
Keeping Room's just walls, Augusta.
Aint nothin' safe.

460
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:20,471
Three women comin' 'gainst
the Union army dont mean nothin'.

461
01:25:23,859 --> 01:25:26,599
What if we was men
instead 'uh women?
