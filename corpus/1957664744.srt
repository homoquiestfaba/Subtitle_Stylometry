1
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:44,871
Michelle.

2
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,520
Michelle.

3
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,396
Why Michelle?

4
00:01:10,997 --> 00:01:13,032
Why did you do this to me?

5
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:14,600
Why?

6
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:22,508
Can you hear me?

7
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,044
Can you hear me? What's your name?

8
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:27,380
- What's your name Miss?
- Michelle.

9
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:29,983
Michelle stop it.

10
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:32,852
Hospital's not that far.

11
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,721
She's gonna be OK.

12
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:37,256
Jesus Christ Michelle, what did you do?

13
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,258
Why would you hurt her like that?

14
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:20,053
Dr. Barbary.

15
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,091
Michelle.

16
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:29,762
Michelle.

17
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:32,732
Yeah.

18
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,534
Easy now.

19
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:36,602
You were in an accident.

20
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:39,672
You're in the hospital.

21
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:41,941
What happened?

22
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,978
There was a car crash.

23
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,946
You sustained injuries.

24
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:48,448
Do you remember anything?

25
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,084
Not really.

26
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:54,520
You suffered significant head trauma.

27
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:58,257
Doctors are perhaps too liberal
with the word miracle but...

28
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:03,429
Was there a man in the car with me?

29
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,165
Yes Michelle,

30
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,001
your father.

31
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:11,170
I'm afraid he...

32
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,107
he's gone Michelle.

33
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,249
Seizure!

34
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,465
Father?

35
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:46,339
Michelle?

36
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,042
It's me Father.

37
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,178
Why did you hurt her?

38
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,049
And why did you kill me?

39
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,352
I...

40
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:12,598
You gave us quite
a scare there young lady.

41
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,168
What happened?

42
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:18,871
There was a delayed
episode of cerebral enema.

43
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:22,375
We made a little hole in your
head to relieve the pressure.

44
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,844
In the Dark Ages they used to do that

45
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:26,779
to let the evil spirits out.

46
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:29,649
They gone?

47
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:33,219
The spirits.

48
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,888
You tell me.

49
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,991
I saw something.

50
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:42,662
Something terrible.

51
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:47,033
It was...

52
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:50,570
The man from the accident.

53
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,106
He...

54
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:54,874
Your father?

55
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:57,977
I hear you say that,

56
00:06:58,411 --> 00:07:02,348
but... I don't remember.

57
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,853
When I see him,

58
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,689
there's... nothing.

59
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,391
I...

60
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:16,195
He's my father,

61
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,197
I should...

62
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:23,703
Why am I so afraid?

63
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:27,874
A not unnatural consequence.

64
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:30,410
Your memory will come back to you in time.

65
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:34,247
How long do these
bandages have to stay on?

66
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:38,685
I don't wan to give you
unrealistic expectation Michelle

67
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,219
It's going to be a while.

68
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:42,622
You have a number of

69
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:44,791
reconstructive surgeries ahead of you.

70
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,095
Will I ever...

71
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:52,899
pass for normal?

72
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:58,137
You'll be just as beautiful
as you were before the accident.

73
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:01,274
Remarkably burns and
lacerations are at a minimum.

74
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,576
What we'll do over
the next couple of months

75
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:06,346
is re-assemble your
shattered bone structure.

76
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:10,083
I was...

77
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,285
beautiful?

78
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,887
You get some sleep now young lady.

79
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:18,157
Your gonna need all
your energy in the weeks ahead.

80
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:30,970
No, I'm getting to the good part.

81
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:32,772
So the guy screams,

82
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:35,108
"Dr. Bennet, Dr. Bennet."

83
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:38,211
Doc looks up in horrible pain

84
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,746
and says,

85
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:43,149
"Bent it? I damn near broke it."

86
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:53,493
That's not only
the lamest joke I ever heard,

87
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:56,095
It's also grounds for
a sexual harassment suit.

88
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:00,933
Hey, it ain't like I'm trying to

89
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,002
get on the supreme court or nothing.

90
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:08,808
Hey Cliff.

91
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:10,643
Oh hey Mike.

92
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:13,313
They got you working days now too?

93
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,381
Nah, I'm just doing a double shift.

94
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:16,649
The day guy's out sick.

95
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,319
So you've been here all night?

96
00:09:19,385 --> 00:09:20,486
Yip.

97
00:09:20,953 --> 00:09:22,255
I don't know how you do it.

98
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:24,657
Actually it feels kinda nice.

99
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,860
Sounds like you're in need
of a good 12 step program.

100
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:30,430
You lost me on that one.

101
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,899
I'm accusing you of being a workaholic.

102
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,500
Not me man.

103
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:38,671
I mean it feels kind nice to
enjoy the sun for a change.

104
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:41,074
There's definitely a shortage
of that on the nightshift,

105
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:42,508
Damn straight.

106
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,877
Place get's pretty scary too.

107
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:47,714
Especially with the bride of the
mummies roaming the halls.

108
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,148
Gives me the willies.

109
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:53,553
You know, the girl in 104.

110
00:09:53,686 --> 00:09:56,556
The one with the
invisible man thing going on.

111
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:57,857
Michelle.

112
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:01,094
Dr. Barbary's been parading her
up and down the halls at night.

113
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:03,062
It's called physical therapy Cliff.

114
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,564
She's been bed ridden for weeks.

115
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:06,432
I don't care what it's called,

116
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:07,867
still creeps me out.

117
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:10,069
How much longer is she gonna be here?

118
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:12,438
Well Dr. Barbary said he's probably gonna

119
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:14,474
take off the bandages soon so,

120
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,211
if that works out she could
be released in no time.

121
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:20,880
Provided there are no
complications of course.

122
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,882
Well let's pray for the best.

123
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:26,386
What's the scariest thing you've seen?

124
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:28,287
At the hospital?

125
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:29,455
Yeah

126
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:31,924
Well, it happened before I worked here.

127
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:33,760
Then that don't count.

128
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,129
I wanna know
the scariest thing you've seen.

129
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:38,498
Hang on a second, I did see it.

130
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:41,200
I was all of about 8 or something.

131
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,435
I was with my mom.

132
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:45,038
She rushed me here
after I had broken my arm,

133
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,974
my brother pushed me
from the top bunk... anyway.

134
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:51,577
These two guys come ruching in
while we're sitting in the ER

135
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:52,779
and they're carrying another guy.

136
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,681
He had something in his eye.

137
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,083
I thought this was supposed to be scary.

138
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,118
As far as I could make out,
the thing in his eye was

139
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:00,453
a woman's dress shoe.

140
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:02,789
At least the heel.

141
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:04,290
Ouch.

142
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:09,062
Yeah, the rest of it was just
kinda dangling off his face.

143
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:12,231
What happened?
Some woman walk all over him?

144
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:14,600
I don't know, I never figured it out but

145
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,669
I'm pretty sure he was
already dead though.

146
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,938
I had nightmares about that for years.

147
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:23,543
I still think bride of the
mummies' scarier.

148
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:55,041
You've healed wonderfully.

149
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,445
It's extraordinary.

150
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:22,869
Like what you see?

151
00:12:25,338 --> 00:12:27,307
No complaints doc.

152
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,082
But it's still...

153
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,718
doesn't ring a bell.

154
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:42,889
You fly much?

155
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:46,926
No.

156
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:51,931
I don't know.

157
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:53,599
Why?

158
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,536
Good luck getting
through the metal detectors.

159
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:06,079
Thank you.

160
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,449
Oh, I almost forgot.

161
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,886
The Sheriffs Department finally released

162
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:16,222
your personal
belongings from the accident.

163
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:19,993
I was hoping they might jar some memories.

164
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:43,583
Do you...

165
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:51,824
I made this.

166
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:54,727
It's a real one. Not like the party game.

167
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:57,964
Michelle.

168
00:13:58,031 --> 00:13:59,399
Are you alright?

169
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:03,569
Michelle.

170
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:07,640
Sorry.

171
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,811
I just... went a little spacey I guess.

172
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,845
Hey, I just mopped that floor.

173
00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:51,084
I wouldn't want you to...

174
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:53,052
slip and fall.

175
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:57,924
You take it easy.

176
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:06,199
We gotta talk.

177
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:12,005
What did you bring this goddamn thing for?

178
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:02,722
They letting you go home?

179
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:04,424
It's been known to happen.

180
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:06,726
Stick around.

181
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:08,928
I'm off in 20.

182
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:10,396
I'll get you beer.

183
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:11,864
Night Cliff.

184
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,034
Ah man.

185
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:18,338
She is so hot.

186
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:27,981
Ah man if I could get me some of that.

187
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:57,844
Dammit.

188
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:15,395
So you... you heard nothing at all.

189
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:17,664
Not until the nurse screamed.

190
00:17:18,364 --> 00:17:19,999
I was sound asleep.

191
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,972
OK.

192
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:27,874
Alright.

193
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:29,809
Well that'll do it.

194
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:33,146
- Thank you and thank you Doctor.
- No thank you Detective Joiner.

195
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:34,847
And don't forget to get
those locks changed,

196
00:17:34,947 --> 00:17:36,816
- As we speak.
- OK.

197
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:38,651
You heal quick.

198
00:17:43,256 --> 00:17:44,691
That's terrible.

199
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:47,894
Why would someone do something like that?

200
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:52,732
Possibly and addict
looking to score some drugs.

201
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,735
That poor janitor.

202
00:17:56,803 --> 00:17:58,705
Cliff had been with us a long time.

203
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,608
We posted extra security.

204
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:05,578
Try and get back to sleep, if you can.

205
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,434
Hi.

206
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:30,169
You must be Michelle.

207
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,439
Soon as you're dressed.
We'll get out of here.

208
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,445
Good morning Michelle.
How are you feeling?

209
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,814
This would be Mr. Bisson.

210
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:43,549
Who?

211
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,419
He's from Harmony House.
Where you've been placed.

212
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:48,121
Placed?

213
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:52,091
You're still a minor Michelle,
with no living relatives.

214
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:56,729
And given your amnesia
and your history it's really

215
00:18:56,796 --> 00:18:59,232
the logical follow up to your treatment.

216
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:01,968
History?

217
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:04,637
You're a problem kid. You'll fit right in.

218
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:06,506
I mean in a good sort of way.

219
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:09,809
So... I can't go home?

220
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:12,245
I'll tell you what. We'll stop by there

221
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:13,680
pick up some things and after that,

222
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,282
Harmony House will be your home.

223
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:19,819
You're much better physically Michelle

224
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,221
and now it's time to take the next step.

225
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:24,123
Jackie and I would love to have you

226
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:25,825
and you'd be with kids your own age.

227
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:38,871
It feels good to be out of that hospital.

228
00:19:40,273 --> 00:19:42,308
And it's such a great day for it too.

229
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:44,310
Don't you think?

230
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:48,181
- Mr. Bisson?
- Yeah.

231
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:50,283
It's a nice day.

232
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,784
Don't you think?

233
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:54,687
Sure kid, whatever you say.

234
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:09,669
Used to be a great
strip joint right up over here.

235
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:12,872
'Till they went out of business.

236
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,310
Oh man they had a great buffet there too.

237
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:20,146
You probably don't remember though.

238
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:24,117
No, I probably don't.

239
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:27,387
One night some
drunken bastard got a little too

240
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:30,823
up close and personal
with one of the dancers.

241
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:35,295
There she was on all fours
in front of him when suddenly

242
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:37,830
he's got her ankle in one hand,

243
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:40,400
and a dollar bill in the other.

244
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,836
Chick freaked and mule kicked
him right in the head.

245
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,374
Stiletto heel went through his
eye and on into his brain.

246
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,645
Chump was dead
before the tip hit the rail.

247
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,317
Place was shut down that very night.

248
00:20:57,383 --> 00:21:00,253
Never to open it's doors
to the public again.

249
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:03,556
And I had an unused
discount admission coupon,

250
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:05,391
good for a two for one lap dance.

251
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:10,596
I hate how one
son of a bitch can ruin things

252
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:12,265
for everybody else.

253
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,767
Yeah.

254
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:17,670
Life can be pretty unfair sometimes.

255
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:19,505
Come to think of it,

256
00:21:19,806 --> 00:21:22,909
I still may have that coupon
around somewhere.

257
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:26,346
You know, I've always
been a bit of an optimist.

258
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:29,716
It's part of our philosophy
over at Harmony house.

259
00:21:45,531 --> 00:21:47,000
What are you looking at?

260
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,901
Nothing.

261
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:04,784
Well, this is it.

262
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:09,489
What did you mean back at the hospital?

263
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:11,557
When you said I'm a problem kid?

264
00:22:11,924 --> 00:22:13,793
Well the way I understand it,

265
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,396
you used to be a real goodie two shoes

266
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:19,999
Made good grades, respected your parents.

267
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,969
Went to church on Sunday.

268
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:25,004
Parents.

269
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:26,839
So there were two.

270
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:28,341
Well yeah.

271
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:33,513
Your dad was a pretty
capable guy but even for him

272
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:36,316
getting pregnant
would have been quite a stretch.

273
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:39,986
I mean didn't that
doctor tell you anything?

274
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:43,022
So what happened to my mom?

275
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:45,758
She had a long bout with cancer.

276
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:48,895
Your dad spent no expense in her treatment

277
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:52,065
but there just wasn't anything
medical science could do.

278
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:55,768
He was with her though,
you know, when she died.

279
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:59,472
And she died peacefully in her sleep.

280
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:03,443
It was about 18 months ago.

281
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:06,846
So how does that make me a problem kid.

282
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:11,184
Well you tried to stick a knife
in your dad's girlfriend.

283
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,686
That's usually considered a problem.

284
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:19,859
Now your dad was a saint and all
while your mom was still alive

285
00:23:19,926 --> 00:23:22,862
but in the months after her death he,

286
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:26,099
scraped himself together and moved on.

287
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,534
He started dating again.

288
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:33,106
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

289
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,675
You didn't see it that way though.

290
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:39,245
To you... it was like a betrayal

291
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:42,215
Suddenly Daddy's little girl

292
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:45,351
harbored a whole lot of resentment.

293
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:47,020
So I rebelled.

294
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,421
Big time.

295
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:50,290
Lost interest in school,

296
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,992
started hanging around
with the wrong crowd.

297
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:55,395
You know I've seen this a million times

298
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:57,363
And the knife incident?

299
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:01,734
Dad was able to stop you
in time but the girlfriend

300
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:03,903
called the police anyway.

301
00:24:04,203 --> 00:24:06,606
A domestic disturbance report was filed

302
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:08,908
but that was pretty much the end of it.

303
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:12,312
Of course the girlfriend
never came around again.

304
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:13,680
But there were others.

305
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,618
Now hurry up and get your stuff.

306
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,969
Make it snappy. Jackie's cooking dinner.

307
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,240
That is one big ass house.

308
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:27,547
Gotcha.

309
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,450
Come on, it's starting to get dark.

310
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:33,920
Who's your decorator, Charles Manson?

311
00:26:56,643 --> 00:26:57,944
This is nice.

312
00:27:06,653 --> 00:27:07,954
Ow.

313
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:09,222
God. Wha...

314
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,900
You gotta have something
good stashed in there.

315
00:27:36,382 --> 00:27:38,918
A whole house and you
gotta hide everything you got

316
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:42,322
in the most obvious spots.

317
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:57,270
Maybe this will jog your memory.

318
00:28:09,148 --> 00:28:11,250
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

319
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:13,286
- Try.
- No, I'm not gonna try...

320
00:28:13,353 --> 00:28:14,988
- You gonna do it?
- I'm gonna do it right now.

321
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,156
Fucking idiots.

322
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:26,366
Hey I'm gonna do you right now.

323
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:37,143
Shit guys, what is it with these games?

324
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,211
I mean the violence.

325
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:39,912
Dutch, don't you get
enough of that at home

326
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:45,652
Hi, I'm Dutch.

327
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:47,387
Hi, Michelle.

328
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,022
I'm Larry.

329
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:50,923
Don't get too close.

330
00:28:51,024 --> 00:28:53,326
He just got back from visiting his old man

331
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:55,161
You can still smell
the dick on his breath.

332
00:28:55,228 --> 00:28:58,298
Dude, you know what dick smells like?

333
00:29:02,835 --> 00:29:05,238
You see how violence on the screen

334
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:07,473
begets violence in real life?

335
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,909
Kick his ass Dutch, come on.

336
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:13,646
Time out.

337
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,315
You son's of bitches are gonna fly right

338
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:17,183
and you're gonna spend
the rest of the evening

339
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,685
on serious lock down.

340
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:21,688
You hear me you ungrateful
little piles of shit.

341
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:25,124
Now Dalia, show her where she sleeps.

342
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,061
God.

343
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:34,133
Come on.

344
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:41,741
Anybody for a par cheesy?

345
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:49,782
This one's yours. And I'm over there.

346
00:29:55,788 --> 00:29:58,825
What, you expected maybe the Ritz Carlton?

347
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:02,762
I wasn't expecting a toxic waste dump.

348
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:06,532
Let's see what you got.

349
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:12,805
Oh, music. Always a good choice.
Gotta have the jamskis.

350
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:15,642
Mr. Bisson thought maybe they'd help me.

351
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:18,544
What, take a stroll down memory lane?

352
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:20,580
Somehow I don't think that retard

353
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:22,281
had your best interest in mind.

354
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:30,923
No, nope, no. OK. No, have it, no.

355
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:34,727
She'll take them away anyway.

356
00:30:34,827 --> 00:30:36,029
Why fight it.

357
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:37,397
We surrender these,

358
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:39,198
she might not find
the ones that we hide. Right?

359
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,301
Who?

360
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:44,103
Ever see 'Ilze, She Wolf of the SS'.

361
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:48,107
Me neither.

362
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:50,276
Dutch says that's who she reminds him of.

363
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,146
I'm not following any of this.

364
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:55,815
And they say my brain is fried from drugs.

365
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:58,318
I used to have a problem.

366
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:00,119
Problem my ass.

367
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:05,458
Once you stop everything
seems so goddamn normal.

368
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:09,028
Ooh.

369
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:10,697
Hot.

370
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,632
It's all I could find.

371
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:15,802
I really just wanted
something more comfortable.

372
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:18,871
Comfortable? This is rocking good.

373
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,442
Something tells me
you used to be a lot more fun

374
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:23,843
before you hit your head

375
00:31:24,777 --> 00:31:26,145
Yeah.

376
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:29,148
I'll take it.
Trade you for something of mine.

377
00:31:29,682 --> 00:31:32,352
I'll have to stuff it though
I've got the...

378
00:31:33,052 --> 00:31:34,520
Oh my Lord.

379
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:36,322
Father in heaven.

380
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:38,558
Whores of Babylon.

381
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:40,259
Not in my house.

382
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:44,664
Pass it over. Now.

383
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,199
What?

384
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,568
You brought this stuff into my house

385
00:31:49,102 --> 00:31:50,803
I didn't, I...

386
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,505
I'm not stupid OK.

387
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:54,207
Don't treat me like I am.

388
00:31:54,974 --> 00:31:58,544
You the... new girl that my
husband picked up today?

389
00:31:59,045 --> 00:32:00,880
He helped me pick this stuff.

390
00:32:01,214 --> 00:32:03,016
And what part did you play...

391
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:04,584
temptress?

392
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:05,852
No.

393
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:07,854
Yeah well.

394
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:10,723
Bisson's got a weak spirit.

395
00:32:10,823 --> 00:32:13,059
Easily led astray by lies of the flesh.

396
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:14,427
Please.

397
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:16,763
I didn't mean to
get off on the wrong foot.

398
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:18,865
The only foot you have to worry about

399
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:20,600
is the one I'm gonna stick up your ass

400
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,602
you get anywhere near my husband again.

401
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:26,139
Now go to bed.

402
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:29,208
Say your prayers.
You got group in the morning.

403
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:32,045
- I haven't had anything to eat.
- Shut it.

404
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:38,084
Sorry.

405
00:32:38,918 --> 00:32:42,889
I'm starved. I'll see you later.

406
00:33:16,923 --> 00:33:18,524
You don't think that,

407
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,260
Dutch and Di are
getting a little too friendly.

408
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:25,732
Why, were they playing
footsie under the table?

409
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:26,966
Cute.

410
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:30,903
Like it's footsie I'm worried about.

411
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:32,905
Whatever.

412
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:35,008
Yeah right, whatever.

413
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:37,744
So you can just whatever your
way through all the shit

414
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,178
that's gonna come down on us

415
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,648
when one of these sluts end up pregnant.

416
00:33:43,383 --> 00:33:44,917
It's sinful behavior Bisson.

417
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:48,021
And I'm not going to
tolerate it in my house.

418
00:33:49,022 --> 00:33:51,190
You make it sound like
they're queer or something.

419
00:33:51,324 --> 00:33:52,859
The last time I checked,

420
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:56,029
Dalia was not packing a penis.

421
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:01,701
Hey, it's just an expression.

422
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:04,237
It's not like I
really checked or anything.

423
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:11,944
Should I take some of this
up to the new girl 'cause

424
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:14,147
she didn't have any supper.

425
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:16,949
She's being punished.

426
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:20,353
Good for her.

427
00:34:20,787 --> 00:34:23,022
Don't you think you're
taking this tough love thing

428
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:24,991
a little too seriously?

429
00:34:25,525 --> 00:34:27,994
I mean it's her first night here.

430
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:31,197
If you don't discipline them
right when they get in,

431
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:34,233
These brats will just walk all over you.

432
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:37,036
Well so much for a warm welcome.

433
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:41,341
What would you have me do?

434
00:34:41,674 --> 00:34:44,777
Go up stairs and, tuck her in.

435
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:47,146
Jackie.

436
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:50,917
I have one word for you.

437
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:53,553
Cincinnati.

438
00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:14,641
Those charges were dropped
baby you know that.

439
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,544
OK?

440
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:21,280
Let's go upstairs.

441
00:35:21,648 --> 00:35:22,949
Come on.

442
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:29,255
Good.

443
00:35:31,424 --> 00:35:33,793
We'll be OK. You'll see.

444
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:54,314
Dutch, what are you doing?

445
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:55,848
Nothing Baby.

446
00:35:56,082 --> 00:35:57,483
I'm just looking.

447
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:58,785
Get over here.

448
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:01,220
I'll give you something to look at.

449
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:05,391
She is out cold man.

450
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:08,594
I think we should do something to her.

451
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:11,798
Why don't you do something to me?

452
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:51,304
Michelle.

453
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:54,507
Who is she?

454
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:57,310
I don...

455
00:36:57,377 --> 00:36:58,911
Who is this girl Michelle?

456
00:36:59,545 --> 00:37:00,847
What did you do to her?

457
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:02,448
I can't remember.

458
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:05,151
Bullshit.

459
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,396
I suppose you never
saw these before neither.

460
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:23,703
Here, let me get that for you babe.

461
00:37:38,484 --> 00:37:39,686
You OK?

462
00:37:41,688 --> 00:37:43,523
What is going on?

463
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:46,793
It was just a nightmare.

464
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,795
You'll be alright kid.

465
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:52,398
What are you soft on this one?

466
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,094
Anybody.

467
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:27,533
This would actually help if you
jerks just try to participate.

468
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:31,704
At the very least tell Michelle
how it's supposed to go.

469
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:32,939
Dalia.

470
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:35,074
Oh, thanks for sharing.

471
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:37,644
OK, Dutch, how about you?

472
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:38,978
No can do B-Dog.

473
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:40,713
Can you tell me why?

474
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,482
I'm sleepy man.

475
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:44,584
Didn't catch a wink last night.

476
00:38:44,784 --> 00:38:47,620
OK fair. Is that where we should start?

477
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:49,989
Last night, Michelle, how about it.

478
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:52,859
I don't know.

479
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:54,927
I had a dream.

480
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:57,730
The guy...

481
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:01,668
my father was there.

482
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:04,270
He...

483
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,272
Did he touch you Michelle?

484
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:07,807
Did you like it?

485
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:08,941
What?

486
00:39:09,008 --> 00:39:10,343
No.

487
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:11,944
He was hurt.

488
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:14,113
Like in the accident.

489
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:17,583
And there was someone...

490
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:19,652
else there too.

491
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,689
On the floor.

492
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,960
But I couldn't make out who it was.

493
00:39:28,161 --> 00:39:30,029
He kept asking me about her.

494
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:32,699
But I...

495
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,867
just didn't know anything.

496
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:36,302
Maybe it was your lesbian lover.

497
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:37,637
Dutch.

498
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:41,674
He accused me of lying.

499
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:43,543
Sounds about right to me.

500
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:46,212
What?

501
00:39:46,312 --> 00:39:50,149
You've been lying to yourself
ever since the... accident.

502
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:53,853
Deep down you know exactly what happened

503
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,254
but you're afraid to face it.

504
00:39:55,822 --> 00:39:57,557
That's why Daddy's
on to you in your dreams.

505
00:39:58,491 --> 00:39:59,826
Right Bisson?

506
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:02,662
I'd caution you about
drawing any conclusions.

507
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:05,465
The subconscious mind
can be a very complex...

508
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:06,933
Don't sugar coat it.

509
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,669
You know she's got a troubled
past or she wouldn't be here.

510
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:12,538
Accident or not, she fucked up somehow.

511
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,341
Daddy's dead, and she's
just gonna have to deal...

512
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:17,443
- Dalia.
- I'm serious.

513
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:18,645
Dalia I'm serious.

514
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:20,680
Hey, I'm just trying to help her man.

515
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:26,252
You're a jerk.

516
00:40:26,753 --> 00:40:28,388
Well that went well.

517
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:35,295
Don't let Dalia bother you.

518
00:40:35,395 --> 00:40:37,697
She just likes to stir up trouble.

519
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:40,933
No. It's even worse than she says.

520
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:44,203
I'm a really bad person.

521
00:40:44,704 --> 00:40:46,673
Don't say that. It's not true.

522
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,708
Listen to this.

523
00:40:53,279 --> 00:40:56,115
'Father came home with
another one of his whore.

524
00:40:56,215 --> 00:40:57,684
The asshole.

525
00:40:58,117 --> 00:41:00,753
I waited, till they were asleep.

526
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,855
And then I put the leeches on.

527
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:05,858
I watched them get fat on his blood.

528
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,794
Gorged themselves.

529
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:09,629
I wanted to join them.

530
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,597
I stood...

531
00:41:11,698 --> 00:41:13,333
barely able to breath.

532
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:15,034
While they stole his life,

533
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:17,337
and then dropped off like ripe fruit.

534
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:20,273
They never felt a thing.

535
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:24,510
This morning, they thought
the marks were hickeys.'

536
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:28,081
So you were mad at him that day
and wrote some stupid fantasy.

537
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,783
An accident is just that.

538
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:32,251
An accident.

539
00:41:35,622 --> 00:41:37,357
You didn't kill you father.

540
00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:39,292
How do you know?

541
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:48,835
'The earliest boards, were dark and light.

542
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:50,670
Yes and no.

543
00:41:51,304 --> 00:41:53,673
Egyptian images added alphabets.

544
00:41:53,773 --> 00:41:57,343
Hieroglyphs to impart greater
meaning to their summonings.

545
00:41:57,744 --> 00:42:02,081
The most powerful boards,
the gateways, the daemon boards,

546
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:04,150
were drawn in human blood.

547
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,189
They were used to open direct
communication with daemons.

548
00:42:11,524 --> 00:42:13,192
It's getting so close.

549
00:42:13,526 --> 00:42:15,128
I can't wait.

550
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:17,463
The board is almost done.

551
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:20,099
How I've savored creating the images

552
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:22,168
with my father's stolen blood.

553
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,339
All I have to find is an offering.'

554
00:42:27,874 --> 00:42:30,510
It's probably just a creative
writing project or something.

555
00:42:31,144 --> 00:42:32,378
It's not funny.

556
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:35,181
It goes on and on.

557
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:37,850
Detail after detail.

558
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:40,019
Killing.

559
00:42:40,153 --> 00:42:41,688
Daemon summoning.

560
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,358
This is witch craft.

561
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:47,226
Evil.

562
00:42:48,328 --> 00:42:49,729
This is me.

563
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:53,132
This stuff...

564
00:42:55,902 --> 00:42:57,370
I wrote this.

565
00:42:57,971 --> 00:43:00,206
You feel it? You remember?

566
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:03,009
No.

567
00:43:03,376 --> 00:43:05,545
You're a screwed up kid like us all.

568
00:43:05,778 --> 00:43:07,413
I've got pictures I drew a few years back

569
00:43:07,513 --> 00:43:09,749
of me chain sawing my entire family.

570
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,685
It doesn't mean I'm actually gonna do it.

571
00:43:13,152 --> 00:43:14,921
What about the girl in my dream?

572
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:16,589
Who is she?

573
00:43:16,689 --> 00:43:18,224
What difference does it make?

574
00:43:18,524 --> 00:43:20,159
It's just a dream.

575
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,694
She's not real.

576
00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:28,034
Come on.

577
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:29,936
I'll show you around this dump.

578
00:43:30,536 --> 00:43:31,904
It'll take your mind off things.

579
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:46,085
Boys bedroom.

580
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:52,558
Around the corner here is the bathroom.

581
00:43:52,659 --> 00:43:53,893
I'm sure you know.

582
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,130
To the right is Jackie and Bisson's room.

583
00:43:58,598 --> 00:43:59,932
Let's check out downstairs.

584
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:01,968
What's that one?

585
00:44:03,202 --> 00:44:04,304
Yeah.

586
00:44:04,404 --> 00:44:07,407
That's Jackie and Bisson's treasure room.

587
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:10,610
How much of your stuff did she take?

588
00:44:11,377 --> 00:44:13,046
Everything just about.

589
00:44:13,112 --> 00:44:15,281
Yeah well. Look for it on eBay.

590
00:44:15,915 --> 00:44:18,418
She shakes down every kid
that comes through that door.

591
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,853
I thought the state was paying her way.

592
00:44:21,387 --> 00:44:22,922
You don't know the half of it.

593
00:44:23,623 --> 00:44:26,392
This is the main profit centre
for the whole operation.

594
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:28,828
We're state sponsored
for all kinds of meds.

595
00:44:28,928 --> 00:44:30,263
Subsidized like.

596
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,398
I'm not on anything.

597
00:44:32,632 --> 00:44:34,267
Check your records sweetheart.

598
00:44:34,334 --> 00:44:36,936
Guaranteed she's got you
on everything from Ritalin

599
00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:38,871
to medical Mary Jane.

600
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:40,640
Cabinet's stocked and locked

601
00:44:40,707 --> 00:44:42,842
in case child services comes by but,

602
00:44:43,176 --> 00:44:45,478
I could brake in there
in two shakes if I wanted to.

603
00:44:46,312 --> 00:44:49,482
Yeah, I've had quite a bit of
experience braking and entering.

604
00:44:49,816 --> 00:44:51,184
It's what got me here.

605
00:44:52,118 --> 00:44:54,520
Anyway, most of this stuff...

606
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:56,255
Right out the back door.

607
00:44:56,422 --> 00:44:58,157
And at a hefty mark up I might add.

608
00:45:01,995 --> 00:45:04,864
...came at the
same time. What you like that?

609
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:13,806
Ghetty.

610
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:16,909
What.

611
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,313
Why don't you put a radio
in this raggedy piece of shit?

612
00:45:22,148 --> 00:45:23,549
Can I ask you a question?

613
00:45:25,218 --> 00:45:26,319
What?

614
00:45:26,386 --> 00:45:27,920
Do you love me?

615
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:32,992
I didn't mean it.

616
00:45:35,295 --> 00:45:37,030
Ghetty I didn't mean it.

617
00:45:37,764 --> 00:45:39,699
Why don't you let me make it up to you?

618
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,201
Cat got yo tongue now huh?

619
00:47:18,131 --> 00:47:20,099
What the hell are you doing?

620
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:21,734
I just wanna talk.

621
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:23,636
You looked like you're about
ready to scream again.

622
00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:31,411
More nightmares?

623
00:47:32,779 --> 00:47:33,880
Yeah.

624
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,015
Starring Daddy I assume.

625
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,955
I know about dreams.

626
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:44,023
One of the people in
the place I was at before this.

627
00:47:44,123 --> 00:47:45,658
Did a lot of dream therapy work.

628
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:47,860
Yeah.

629
00:47:48,328 --> 00:47:50,363
I'm sorry I came off
a little strong yesterday.

630
00:47:51,631 --> 00:47:52,899
I think you're just
trying to work out some

631
00:47:52,999 --> 00:47:55,635
unresolved father daughter
stuff in your sleep.

632
00:47:55,835 --> 00:47:57,670
Well it ain't working.

633
00:47:58,538 --> 00:48:00,707
Maybe you need to take
a more pro-active approach.

634
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:03,876
Got any suggestions?

635
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:14,253
When was the last time you tried this?

636
00:48:14,887 --> 00:48:16,322
That thing scares me.

637
00:48:16,723 --> 00:48:19,492
Face your fears. It's the only
way to overcome them.

638
00:48:20,026 --> 00:48:22,061
You don't seriously think I can contact

639
00:48:22,161 --> 00:48:23,630
my dead father with this.

640
00:48:23,696 --> 00:48:25,064
It doesn't matter what I think.

641
00:48:25,164 --> 00:48:27,500
It's what you think. It's your board.

642
00:48:27,567 --> 00:48:28,568
But it's...

643
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:31,104
If it helps you say what you
couldn't say while he was alive.

644
00:48:31,204 --> 00:48:32,538
Then go for it.

645
00:48:33,106 --> 00:48:34,574
What do you have to lose?

646
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:40,913
Come on. It's just a form of therapy.

647
00:48:41,748 --> 00:48:43,416
Place your hands lightly.

648
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:45,385
Barely touch it.

649
00:48:46,085 --> 00:48:48,254
See, it's coming back already.

650
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:50,890
Close your eyes.

651
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,862
Dad?

652
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:57,930
Are you there?

653
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:01,534
Father?

654
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:07,307
It's moving.

655
00:49:14,847 --> 00:49:16,316
I feel something.

656
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:24,691
It says yes.

657
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:09,202
I should really be going.

658
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:10,336
No!

659
00:50:17,644 --> 00:50:18,845
What are you doing?

660
00:50:27,153 --> 00:50:29,322
- What are you doing?
- Making a deal.

661
00:51:12,332 --> 00:51:13,566
- Michelle.
- Shit.

662
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:14,968
What's he doing home so early?

663
00:51:17,437 --> 00:51:19,172
You bitch.

664
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:21,708
Hey. What are you kids up to now huh?

665
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:22,842
Dalia, are you OK?

666
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:24,344
Get your hands off of me.

667
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,545
What happened? Where you there?

668
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:27,714
Shut up you crazy bitch.

669
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,048
What is going on?

670
00:51:29,148 --> 00:51:30,183
She hit me.

671
00:51:30,717 --> 00:51:32,151
What did you do that for?

672
00:51:32,218 --> 00:51:34,187
I didn't want my dad
to know she was up here.

673
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,688
Fuck you.

674
00:51:36,422 --> 00:51:38,758
You'll sleep downstairs
on the couch tonight.

675
00:51:39,092 --> 00:51:41,527
No please, I have to talk to her.

676
00:51:41,594 --> 00:51:42,895
I need to know what she saw.

677
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:44,931
Get her out of here now.

678
00:51:45,398 --> 00:51:48,401
Just tell me if you were there.
Tell me what you saw.

679
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:50,637
Sort this out in the morning.

680
00:51:55,174 --> 00:51:57,043
You two using this?

681
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:00,546
You're just asking for trouble.

682
00:52:00,613 --> 00:52:01,914
It's not mine.

683
00:52:02,281 --> 00:52:03,950
Yeah. You're right about that.

684
00:52:08,788 --> 00:52:09,789
Here.

685
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:16,629
If you hit her,
how come your nose is bleeding?

686
00:52:29,275 --> 00:52:30,443
Need a lift?

687
00:52:42,755 --> 00:52:44,090
Michelle.

688
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:49,862
Father?

689
00:52:58,137 --> 00:52:59,238
Father?

690
00:53:11,951 --> 00:53:13,553
I'm over here Michelle.

691
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:20,360
Where?

692
00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:29,435
She'd like
to know why you did it Michelle.

693
00:53:30,136 --> 00:53:31,437
Do you know?

694
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:33,306
I'm not sure.

695
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:36,709
I don't remember.

696
00:53:37,377 --> 00:53:39,479
You won't get away with this Michelle.

697
00:53:40,513 --> 00:53:42,749
'What's her name'
has got a score to settle.

698
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,033
Hey, who's there.

699
00:54:02,302 --> 00:54:03,903
You're not supposed to be in here.

700
00:54:05,638 --> 00:54:07,040
Oh shit.

701
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:17,483
Now what?

702
00:54:24,924 --> 00:54:26,893
Dutch I'm so sorry.

703
00:54:28,661 --> 00:54:30,430
She's all I had.

704
00:54:42,575 --> 00:54:45,912
Was she despondent,
or depressed about anything?

705
00:54:46,879 --> 00:54:49,248
I wouldn't characterize it that way.

706
00:54:49,415 --> 00:54:54,253
All of our residents have...
issues of one kind or another.

707
00:54:54,354 --> 00:54:55,922
And we're just here to help.

708
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:00,893
Right.

709
00:55:01,094 --> 00:55:03,730
Any idea how she might
have cut her wrists?

710
00:55:05,598 --> 00:55:08,768
No, she must have improvised I guess.

711
00:55:08,835 --> 00:55:11,604
Weapons of any kind
are strictly prohibited.

712
00:55:12,972 --> 00:55:16,743
Improvised? See we couldn't
find anything in the room,

713
00:55:17,443 --> 00:55:19,812
that would have
inflicted those kind of wounds.

714
00:55:21,714 --> 00:55:24,550
Nothing was removed, was it?

715
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:26,786
No, absolutely not.

716
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,389
No. Not that I know of.

717
00:55:30,823 --> 00:55:32,091
OK.

718
00:55:32,825 --> 00:55:34,927
I'll talk to the roommate now please.

719
00:55:34,994 --> 00:55:36,029
Yeah, no problem.

720
00:55:36,129 --> 00:55:37,263
I'll go get her.

721
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,631
Thank you.

722
00:55:42,435 --> 00:55:46,939
I have to tell you, this girl
Michelle is a literal head case.

723
00:55:47,006 --> 00:55:49,742
She got into a bad car wreck and...

724
00:55:50,977 --> 00:55:52,211
you know.

725
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:56,215
Thanks for that.

726
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:00,153
It's OK. Just let it out.

727
00:56:01,187 --> 00:56:02,822
Just let it all out.

728
00:56:10,296 --> 00:56:11,464
Dutch.

729
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,034
Michelle.

730
00:56:15,134 --> 00:56:16,536
Would you come with me please.

731
00:56:26,446 --> 00:56:28,081
What'd you do dickweed?

732
00:56:33,019 --> 00:56:34,687
I have dreams.

733
00:56:35,822 --> 00:56:37,490
Terrible dreams,

734
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:44,063
Dalia thought, they might stop,

735
00:56:45,231 --> 00:56:47,934
if I could somehow
resolve things with my father.

736
00:56:51,504 --> 00:56:53,640
Your father is dead dear.

737
00:56:54,507 --> 00:56:56,275
This is what I'm talking about.

738
00:56:56,376 --> 00:56:59,212
She just doesn't have a grasp on reality.

739
00:57:02,882 --> 00:57:04,017
Ma'am...

740
00:57:05,184 --> 00:57:07,920
would you excuse us please.

741
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:10,056
Yeah.

742
00:57:19,832 --> 00:57:21,734
Oh. No problem.

743
00:57:26,005 --> 00:57:27,040
Little better huh?

744
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:30,677
So Michelle,

745
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:33,146
You say you were trying to...

746
00:57:33,613 --> 00:57:38,117
patch things up with
your dad by using the board?

747
00:57:39,052 --> 00:57:41,754
I know, it sound ridiculous.

748
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:46,893
But there's got to be something to it.

749
00:57:48,728 --> 00:57:50,096
It was...

750
00:57:51,264 --> 00:57:52,632
it was bizarre.

751
00:57:53,766 --> 00:57:54,767
U-huh.

752
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:57,303
Somehow...

753
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,273
It transported us.

754
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:04,644
Transported?

755
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:07,046
Where?

756
00:58:09,582 --> 00:58:10,950
I don't know.

757
00:58:12,118 --> 00:58:15,521
And... your father was there?

758
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,358
Not at first.

759
00:58:19,592 --> 00:58:22,729
He showed up just before I hit Dalia.

760
00:58:23,162 --> 00:58:24,530
You hit Dalia?

761
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:27,934
Why would you do that?

762
00:58:29,202 --> 00:58:31,804
I didn't want him to see her I guess.

763
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,177
Michelle...

764
00:58:41,214 --> 00:58:42,749
you were still at the hospital

765
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,817
the night the janitor was murdered

766
00:58:45,451 --> 00:58:47,787
You remember, you and I talked.

767
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:49,756
Yes.

768
00:58:50,323 --> 00:58:51,324
OK.

769
00:58:52,191 --> 00:58:53,559
His wounds...

770
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:57,397
were very similar to Dalia's.

771
00:58:57,497 --> 00:59:00,199
Maybe caused by the same instrument.

772
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,702
Detective Joyner,

773
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:07,106
If you think Dalia
had something to do with...

774
00:59:09,142 --> 00:59:10,543
Wait a minute.

775
00:59:11,644 --> 00:59:13,313
You think I...

776
00:59:14,113 --> 00:59:15,848
But Dalia's a suicide.

777
00:59:16,382 --> 00:59:18,151
We don't know that for a fact.

778
00:59:19,118 --> 00:59:20,653
Am I gonna need a lawyer?

779
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:23,356
That depends.

780
00:59:24,657 --> 00:59:25,959
Are we done?

781
00:59:26,726 --> 00:59:28,194
Yeah. We're done.

782
00:59:28,828 --> 00:59:29,896
For now.

783
00:59:56,723 --> 00:59:57,991
Where're you going?

784
00:59:58,057 --> 01:00:00,793
- Out.
- It's way past curfew.

785
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:02,595
Fuck curfew.

786
01:00:04,097 --> 01:00:05,264
What's going on?

787
01:00:05,598 --> 01:00:06,766
Is everything OK?

788
01:00:07,266 --> 01:00:08,468
Short answer...

789
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:10,570
No.

790
01:00:11,904 --> 01:00:13,106
And the long answer?

791
01:00:24,484 --> 01:00:27,120
You don't wanna get
mixed up with me Larry.

792
01:00:29,255 --> 01:00:30,723
I gotta go.

793
01:00:31,257 --> 01:00:33,726
Before that cop shows up
with and arrest warrant.

794
01:00:34,227 --> 01:00:35,395
What?

795
01:00:35,495 --> 01:00:36,896
But Dalia was...

796
01:00:36,963 --> 01:00:38,031
I know.

797
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:42,101
But it's a lot more complicated than that?

798
01:00:44,437 --> 01:00:45,638
I think...

799
01:00:45,905 --> 01:00:47,640
I killed somebody.

800
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:48,941
Who?

801
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:50,143
Your dad?

802
01:00:50,476 --> 01:00:51,644
I don't know.

803
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,150
I might have somehow caused the accident.

804
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,519
But I'm talking about
something more overt.

805
01:01:02,388 --> 01:01:05,425
I'm talking about human sacrifice.

806
01:01:05,525 --> 01:01:06,826
Michelle.

807
01:01:07,694 --> 01:01:09,395
That journal's going to your head.

808
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:11,931
We've been over all this before.

809
01:01:12,131 --> 01:01:13,933
It's more than that.

810
01:01:15,768 --> 01:01:18,338
I can see her in my dreams.

811
01:01:20,006 --> 01:01:21,407
My victim.

812
01:01:21,507 --> 01:01:22,508
Who?

813
01:01:22,775 --> 01:01:24,243
I've never seen her face?

814
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:28,681
I just know I picked her up hitch hiking.

815
01:01:34,988 --> 01:01:36,289
My head...

816
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:42,295
feels like it's about to explode.

817
01:01:47,433 --> 01:01:49,369
I've got to get out of here.

818
01:01:49,636 --> 01:01:52,105
Wait... I'm coming with you.

819
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:59,445
You sure you aren't
making a big mistake Larry.

820
01:01:59,512 --> 01:02:01,014
You're my friend.

821
01:02:01,347 --> 01:02:02,982
Cool and smart and

822
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:04,817
I bet if you put some of
this shit behind you

823
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:06,552
you'd be pretty fun to be around too.

824
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:17,764
- Shit.
- What.

825
01:02:18,731 --> 01:02:20,066
The journal.

826
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,367
I left it behind.

827
01:02:21,467 --> 01:02:22,568
So?

828
01:02:22,702 --> 01:02:24,037
You're better off without it.

829
01:02:24,537 --> 01:02:26,773
- But I need it.
- Why?

830
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,474
I just do.

831
01:02:32,412 --> 01:02:33,880
Alright I'll go back.

832
01:02:34,314 --> 01:02:35,581
Seriously?

833
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:38,651
Larry.

834
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,055
Thanks.

835
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:49,062
Sorry Larry.

836
01:02:56,102 --> 01:02:57,236
Do I know you?

837
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,088
Shit.

838
01:03:55,461 --> 01:03:56,663
Bitch.

839
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:10,410
What's going on here?

840
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:12,345
I uh...

841
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:14,514
Thought you'd steal from me.

842
01:04:15,415 --> 01:04:16,582
Is that what you're calling it?

843
01:04:18,017 --> 01:04:19,752
You breaking into my room.

844
01:04:21,788 --> 01:04:23,323
Looks like thieving to me.

845
01:04:23,523 --> 01:04:24,791
Is that right?

846
01:04:26,059 --> 01:04:28,161
You mind telling me
where you got all this stuff?

847
01:04:28,895 --> 01:04:31,364
How many kids are you
collecting checks for?

848
01:04:31,464 --> 01:04:34,200
How much are you getting for
my anti-psychotic medicine?

849
01:04:35,234 --> 01:04:36,602
I want the journal back.

850
01:04:37,537 --> 01:04:38,705
What journal?

851
01:04:38,905 --> 01:04:41,307
The one you took from Michelle's room.

852
01:04:41,774 --> 01:04:43,609
I want it back now.

853
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:46,012
What the fuck would I want with a journal?

854
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,146
Yeah.

855
01:04:47,981 --> 01:04:49,015
Well...

856
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,018
never mind then.

857
01:04:55,555 --> 01:04:57,523
Thieving son of a bitch.

858
01:04:58,191 --> 01:05:00,460
This is what you get
when you let them in your home.

859
01:05:03,162 --> 01:05:04,197
Hey.

860
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:18,211
Fuck you think you're going?

861
01:05:18,277 --> 01:05:20,013
Get your hands off me.

862
01:05:20,113 --> 01:05:22,348
Would you rather I put them
all over your little friend?

863
01:05:22,448 --> 01:05:23,983
I'll let you watch.

864
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,985
She ain't into beasteality fuck face.

865
01:05:28,888 --> 01:05:30,423
- Son of a...
- Hey.

866
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:32,425
What did I tell you about punching walls.

867
01:05:32,525 --> 01:05:34,127
- But...
- But nothing.

868
01:05:34,727 --> 01:05:36,829
You've got to find more constructive ways

869
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:38,431
of dealing with your anger.

870
01:05:38,931 --> 01:05:41,200
Huh. Now get back upstairs.

871
01:05:42,035 --> 01:05:43,369
Michelle.

872
01:05:44,537 --> 01:05:45,772
Michelle?

873
01:05:47,473 --> 01:05:48,708
What the hell.

874
01:06:02,488 --> 01:06:03,890
Tell me about your childhood.

875
01:06:06,092 --> 01:06:07,493
I don't recall.

876
01:06:08,328 --> 01:06:10,296
What is this, CIA and Contra hearing?

877
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,465
Tell me about your childhood.

878
01:06:13,132 --> 01:06:16,235
How were thing between you and dad?

879
01:06:18,171 --> 01:06:19,405
I don't know.

880
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:21,074
I can't remember.

881
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:24,777
So it's the old 'No me recuerdo' Huh?

882
01:06:25,645 --> 01:06:27,447
Mr. Johnny buy you that outfit?

883
01:06:28,114 --> 01:06:29,248
What?

884
01:06:29,716 --> 01:06:31,317
I don't know what you're talking about.

885
01:06:32,785 --> 01:06:35,355
And they say my brain
is fucked from drugs.

886
01:06:35,455 --> 01:06:36,589
Dalia.

887
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:40,193
Was that her name Michelle?

888
01:06:40,293 --> 01:06:41,361
Dalia?

889
01:06:43,062 --> 01:06:44,664
What kind of person are you?

890
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:46,966
What did you do Michelle. What did you do?

891
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:57,210
Dr. Andrews, recovery please.

892
01:06:58,978 --> 01:07:00,279
Dr. Barbary?

893
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:04,951
I'd like to talk to you
about my friend Michelle.

894
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,688
Please.

895
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:10,623
I'm sorry.

896
01:07:12,692 --> 01:07:14,227
I didn't mean it.

897
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:16,996
Who are you?

898
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:20,833
Who are you?

899
01:07:22,568 --> 01:07:23,803
Who are you?

900
01:07:25,972 --> 01:07:27,507
What's your name?

901
01:07:29,575 --> 01:07:31,144
Michelle.

902
01:07:33,513 --> 01:07:35,214
My head hurts.

903
01:07:38,184 --> 01:07:39,585
OK Michelle.

904
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:43,556
What did you do to her?

905
01:07:45,024 --> 01:07:46,326
Who?

906
01:07:47,226 --> 01:07:48,494
Kayla.

907
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:58,037
Need a lift?

908
01:07:58,671 --> 01:07:59,839
Kayla.

909
01:08:01,441 --> 01:08:02,709
It just can't be true.

910
01:08:03,576 --> 01:08:06,679
I know her Doc. She's not
capable of hurting anyone.

911
01:08:07,447 --> 01:08:09,515
Yet she insists she did.

912
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:11,918
Before the accident?

913
01:08:12,018 --> 01:08:13,019
Yeah.

914
01:08:13,086 --> 01:08:15,221
Sometimes severe head trauma

915
01:08:15,321 --> 01:08:17,790
can change a person dramatically.

916
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,859
To the opposite of who they were?

917
01:08:19,926 --> 01:08:25,365
There's a well documented case
from the late 1800 early 1900,

918
01:08:25,431 --> 01:08:27,433
of a man who had a railroad spike

919
01:08:27,533 --> 01:08:29,268
blasted through his head.

920
01:08:29,869 --> 01:08:32,005
He went from being a kind gentle soul

921
01:08:32,071 --> 01:08:35,041
to a cold hearted
son of a bitch overnight.

922
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:39,412
Maybe in Michelle's case
thing worked out for the better.

923
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:43,783
You have to understand

924
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:46,819
the severity of her injuries Larry.

925
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,656
I built her face...

926
01:08:50,757 --> 01:08:55,828
from nothing, from shards
of bones and photographs.

927
01:08:55,928 --> 01:08:57,130
What?

928
01:08:57,563 --> 01:09:02,235
We had to use family photos as
a guide to rebuilding her face.

929
01:09:02,402 --> 01:09:06,239
It was like, making a skull from...

930
01:09:07,073 --> 01:09:08,308
scratch.

931
01:09:15,682 --> 01:09:17,483
Her name was Kayla.

932
01:09:24,324 --> 01:09:25,525
Where is she?

933
01:09:29,128 --> 01:09:31,631
I swear to Christ if you
don't tell me where she is

934
01:09:31,698 --> 01:09:32,765
I'll kill you.

935
01:09:48,281 --> 01:09:49,549
Oh...

936
01:09:49,782 --> 01:09:54,287
Dr. Gordon, this is
Dr. Barbary at Queen's Hospital.

937
01:09:54,354 --> 01:09:57,123
I'm sorry to bother you
at home at this late hour.

938
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:02,095
Yes, I'm aware that you've retires sir but

939
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:05,264
I was hoping that you could
assist us in locating records

940
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:07,266
of a former patient of yours.

941
01:10:16,643 --> 01:10:18,378
I know it was you.

942
01:10:21,147 --> 01:10:23,149
I saw you there that night.

943
01:10:26,185 --> 01:10:27,520
What did you do to her?

944
01:10:36,596 --> 01:10:38,598
What the hell did you do to her?

945
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:41,367
Tell him Michelle.

946
01:10:42,302 --> 01:10:43,670
Tell him what you did.

947
01:10:46,773 --> 01:10:49,509
Well, these don't tell us
what we want to know.

948
01:10:50,176 --> 01:10:51,844
Hopefully Gordon's stuff will.

949
01:10:52,245 --> 01:10:53,913
I just hope she's OK.

950
01:10:54,414 --> 01:10:57,684
She's a survivor. That you can count on.

951
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:58,851
Dr. Barbary.

952
01:10:59,018 --> 01:11:00,253
These just came in.

953
01:11:09,762 --> 01:11:11,698
I killed her.

954
01:11:12,966 --> 01:11:14,600
I killed her.

955
01:11:22,108 --> 01:11:23,910
Oh my God.

956
01:11:24,944 --> 01:11:25,945
What?

957
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,816
You've got a pretty good intuition.

958
01:12:04,017 --> 01:12:05,551
Dalia had it right.

959
01:12:06,953 --> 01:12:09,289
I was afraid to face the truth.

960
01:12:11,924 --> 01:12:14,027
I'd like you to call the police.

961
01:12:17,163 --> 01:12:18,464
Mr. Bisson.

962
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:03,343
Jackie.

963
01:13:11,651 --> 01:13:12,819
Larry?

964
01:13:16,856 --> 01:13:18,358
Dutch?

965
01:13:48,354 --> 01:13:49,555
Hello.

966
01:13:50,657 --> 01:13:51,758
Anybody?

967
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:53,226
Please.

968
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:07,473
Dutch. What happened?

969
01:14:09,842 --> 01:14:11,477
Come on, come on.

970
01:14:12,445 --> 01:14:14,847
Somebody pick up for Christ's sake.

971
01:14:17,483 --> 01:14:19,252
Oh my God, Dutch.

972
01:14:21,287 --> 01:14:23,556
What?

973
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:25,491
Why?

974
01:14:26,759 --> 01:14:29,595
Why did you have to kill us?

975
01:14:30,263 --> 01:14:32,865
You... you bitch.

976
01:14:48,181 --> 01:14:50,116
What's happening?

977
01:15:02,762 --> 01:15:05,765
Why don't you try again.
Maybe you dialed wrong.

978
01:15:29,289 --> 01:15:30,390
Hello.

979
01:15:30,823 --> 01:15:31,824
Michelle?

980
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:35,495
They're all dead Larry.

981
01:15:35,561 --> 01:15:37,196
What are you talking about?

982
01:15:37,463 --> 01:15:38,698
I killed them.

983
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:40,933
No you didn't. You didn't kill anyone.

984
01:15:43,469 --> 01:15:46,572
It's time we both got real
about who I am Larry.

985
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,708
What I am.

986
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:52,312
Michelle, hang tight.
I'm gonna be right over.

987
01:15:52,412 --> 01:15:54,414
Don't come here Larry.

988
01:15:55,214 --> 01:15:56,649
It's not safe.

989
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:58,518
Michelle...

990
01:15:59,552 --> 01:16:00,853
Michelle?

991
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,892
She doesn't sound so good.

992
01:16:07,327 --> 01:16:09,128
I gotta get over there right away.

993
01:16:09,195 --> 01:16:10,730
Can you give me a life?

994
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:13,733
Paging Dr. Barbary.
Please report to the ER.

995
01:16:14,434 --> 01:16:17,337
Come on Doc. This is an emergency.

996
01:16:20,773 --> 01:16:23,576
Take my car, and bring it back.

997
01:16:57,944 --> 01:16:59,278
Michelle.

998
01:17:02,115 --> 01:17:03,716
There's been a huge mix up.

999
01:17:03,783 --> 01:17:05,218
They got it all wrong.

1000
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:06,919
The dental charts don't match.

1001
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,721
The house, the journal, the board.

1002
01:17:09,088 --> 01:17:10,556
It's got nothing to do with you.

1003
01:17:10,623 --> 01:17:13,026
The guy in the car, not your dad.

1004
01:17:14,394 --> 01:17:17,563
The y rebuilt your face
from the wrong photos.

1005
01:17:18,464 --> 01:17:19,565
Don't you get it?

1006
01:17:21,367 --> 01:17:23,269
The girl, the one that wrote the journal.

1007
01:17:23,603 --> 01:17:25,305
It's not you, that's...

1008
01:17:27,106 --> 01:17:29,208
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1009
01:17:54,067 --> 01:17:55,535
Kayla.

1010
01:17:56,002 --> 01:17:57,236
Looking good kid.

1011
01:18:05,278 --> 01:18:06,446
Need a lift?

1012
01:18:06,512 --> 01:18:07,680
Thanks.

1013
01:18:18,491 --> 01:18:19,959
Ew, gross.

1014
01:18:20,026 --> 01:18:21,361
Science project.

1015
01:18:21,661 --> 01:18:22,962
Want something to drink?

1016
01:18:25,531 --> 01:18:26,666
I made this.

1017
01:18:27,467 --> 01:18:30,269
It's a real one. Not like the party game.

1018
01:18:40,446 --> 01:18:43,583
Wow, you really were thirsty.

1019
01:18:50,456 --> 01:18:51,524
Michelle.

1020
01:18:51,591 --> 01:18:53,559
Shit, what's he doing home so early?

1021
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:55,395
It's alright, I should get out of here.

1022
01:18:56,329 --> 01:18:57,497
No, you can't leave yet.

1023
01:18:57,563 --> 01:18:59,299
Eddie's probably starting to worry.

1024
01:18:59,365 --> 01:19:00,366
No.

1025
01:19:06,172 --> 01:19:07,874
What did you bring that goddamn thing for?

1026
01:19:08,007 --> 01:19:09,942
Michelle stop it.

1027
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:15,682
Hospital's not that far.

1028
01:19:15,748 --> 01:19:17,517
She's gonna be OK. She's gonna be OK.

1029
01:19:18,484 --> 01:19:20,420
Jesus Christ Michelle. What did you do?

1030
01:19:20,753 --> 01:19:22,221
Why would you hurt her like that?

1031
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:24,357
Give it up man.

1032
01:19:24,424 --> 01:19:26,726
She'll be dead by the time
you get to the hospital.

1033
01:19:27,026 --> 01:19:28,094
I poisoned her.

1034
01:19:28,561 --> 01:19:30,196
Oh my God. What are we gonna do now?

1035
01:19:30,697 --> 01:19:32,398
She's street trash Daddy.

1036
01:19:32,498 --> 01:19:33,599
Don't sweat it.

1037
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,335
What kind of a person are you?

1038
01:19:36,135 --> 01:19:38,237
What did you do Michelle? What did you do?

1039
01:19:38,705 --> 01:19:40,873
Just worked a little deal Daddy.

1040
01:19:41,574 --> 01:19:43,109
A deal for her life.

1041
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:47,513
You, I'm going to
give to them for nothing.

1042
01:20:06,232 --> 01:20:07,567
Oh my God.

1043
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:08,901
Larry.

1044
01:20:09,168 --> 01:20:10,403
Larry.

1045
01:20:15,108 --> 01:20:16,809
What did you do to him?

1046
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:19,445
Larry. Oh my God.

1047
01:20:22,015 --> 01:20:23,149
Why?

1048
01:20:23,549 --> 01:20:24,851
He bothered me.

1049
01:20:25,251 --> 01:20:27,286
Did they all bother you?

1050
01:20:27,654 --> 01:20:29,422
They stood between me and the board.

1051
01:20:29,489 --> 01:20:30,923
I needed it back.

1052
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:32,859
You've got it.

1053
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:34,994
Why are you still here?

1054
01:20:36,162 --> 01:20:38,564
I've been waiting for you of course.

1055
01:20:38,865 --> 01:20:40,833
There's still a little misunderstanding

1056
01:20:40,933 --> 01:20:42,168
that need to be cleared up.

1057
01:20:42,302 --> 01:20:45,338
And I'd like you to
set the record straight.

1058
01:20:46,139 --> 01:20:49,142
Summon the nether world
daemons and explain to them

1059
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:51,144
that you're not me.

1060
01:20:55,281 --> 01:20:57,450
I don't believe in that stuff.

1061
01:20:57,817 --> 01:20:59,018
Humor me then.

1062
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,421
Summon them.

1063
01:21:01,821 --> 01:21:03,756
Tell them you're not me.

1064
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:06,492
What difference does it make?

1065
01:21:07,327 --> 01:21:09,028
I need to reclaim from you.

1066
01:21:09,128 --> 01:21:10,630
What is rightfully mine.

1067
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:13,166
I don't know what you're taking about.

1068
01:21:13,299 --> 01:21:15,535
You got the board back.

1069
01:21:15,635 --> 01:21:19,372
I'm the one who bartered
for immortality, not you.

1070
01:21:19,906 --> 01:21:21,541
There's no such thing.

1071
01:21:21,841 --> 01:21:23,476
Then how did you survive the poisoning?

1072
01:21:24,043 --> 01:21:26,145
How did you survive the car crash?

1073
01:21:26,446 --> 01:21:28,548
You're own doctor called it a miracle.

1074
01:21:28,648 --> 01:21:30,316
You're crazy.

1075
01:21:30,383 --> 01:21:31,651
Do it.

1076
01:21:32,085 --> 01:21:33,186
Do it or I'll...

1077
01:21:33,252 --> 01:21:34,687
Or you'll what?

1078
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:36,389
Kill me?

1079
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:39,525
I'd say your logic's a little flawed.

1080
01:21:39,659 --> 01:21:40,860
Isn't it?

1081
01:21:40,927 --> 01:21:43,463
You can still feel pain can't you?

1082
01:21:46,032 --> 01:21:47,166
Now summon them.

1083
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:49,736
I don't know how.

1084
01:22:01,914 --> 01:22:02,915
Now tell them.

1085
01:22:03,516 --> 01:22:05,451
Dark Lords of the underworld.

1086
01:22:06,252 --> 01:22:08,021
There has been a mistake.

1087
01:22:08,454 --> 01:22:09,689
Keep going.

1088
01:22:09,889 --> 01:22:11,057
My name is...

1089
01:22:13,393 --> 01:22:14,594
Kayla.

1090
01:22:15,928 --> 01:22:18,131
I wish to rectify a grievous error.

1091
01:22:20,266 --> 01:22:22,435
I have not payed
well enough for your gifts.

1092
01:22:22,535 --> 01:22:23,536
What?

1093
01:22:23,603 --> 01:22:25,538
So I bring you another.

1094
01:22:28,675 --> 01:22:31,778
You bitch. Only one of us
is getting out of here alive.

1095
01:22:31,878 --> 01:22:34,247
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1096
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:03,636
Thank God.

1097
01:24:04,103 --> 01:24:06,372
We were worried about you.

1098
01:24:06,806 --> 01:24:08,975
You ought to know better than that Doc.

1099
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:11,177
I'm a survivor.
