- Well, come with me, Stace.

164
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:50,205
- No.
- See?

165
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,395
<i>All right, let's do it.
Okay, give me the pound.</i>

166
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,491
- Okay. All right now.
- All right, here we go.

167
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:58,763
Get up on his grille.
Sell him that stuff.

168
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:01,705
<i>[Ramón]
Oh, no.</i>

169
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,134
Yes, Jazmin?
What can I do for you?

170
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,146
Well, actually,
I wanted to talk to him.

171
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,148
Is that the head buyer
of Bloomfeld's?

172
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,684
And that information is
pertinent to you because?

173
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:18,917
- Well, I want to show him
my fashion design sketches.
- Absolutely not.

174
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:21,993
Robert Myer is an
extremely busy man...

175
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:24,858
and doesn't have time
to entertain your amateur sketches.

176
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:28,297
Maybe he can just take a look
and tell me if I've got potential.

177
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,561
I got this whole
book of plus-size designs.

178
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:34,070
Since our plus-size selection could use some
help, I thought he might be interested.

179
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:36,539
I can assure you he's not.

180
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:39,042
But he's standing right there.
Can I just talk to him?

181
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:42,671
You wouldn't believe how many big women
come up to me on the street every day...

182
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:44,749
wantin' to know
where I got my outfit from.

183
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,751
And frankly,
I don't give a damn.

184
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:52,654
Look, Jazmin, launching a clothing line
is much more than a notion...

185
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:55,522
and takes a lot of things
that you don't have.

186
00:11:55,627 --> 00:12:01,088
Now, I have work to do and so do you
if you appreciate your job here.

187
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
Go... Bloomfeld's!

188
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:11,269
<i>I'm gonna start my line. I'm gonna show
dickface. I'm gonna get me a bank loan.</i>

189
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,937
Jaz, girl, you know I'm down
for you for whatever...

190
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:16,139
<i>but bank loans
aren't easy to get.</i>

191
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:17,806
They ain't just
handing 'em out.

192
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,111
Then I'll do whatever
it takes, Stace.

193
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:24,212
- You serious about this, huh?
- Damn right I'm serious.

194
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:28,054
I'm sorry, Ms. Biltmore,
your loan application has been denied.

195
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,060
<i>- Denied?
- Uh, due to...</i>

196
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:32,630
insufficient

197
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,996
Yes, unfortunately,

199

might classify...</i>

200
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,907
as an upper-middle-class
neighborhood...

201
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:47,843
uh, the bank classifies it
as a high-risk zone.

202
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:51,109
- You mean a "black zone. "
- Ms. Biltmore, this is not a race issue.

203
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:56,244
No, no. We here at First Plantation Bank
are an equal-opportunity lender.

finding trendy clothes to wear.

209

And when you dropped me off at my room,
you gave me a handshake.

a man likes you...

ofTunde's...

1317
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:19,003
<i>and I traveled here
all the way from America...</i>

1318
01:29:19,107 --> 01:29:22,702
and, um, I just wanted to know
if I could say hi.

1319
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:25,108
Would that be okay?

Y'all go wait in the cab.
I, uh, want to get rejected in private.

1324
01:29:47,802 --> 01:29:50,862
- You sure? All right.
- Yeah. All right.

1325
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:08,854
- Jazmin?
- Tunde.

1326
01:30:14,095 --> 01:30:17,030
- Am I dreaming?
- No, you're not dreaming.

1327
01:30:17,131 --> 01:30:19,656
Um, I'm really here.

1328
01:30:19,767 --> 01:30:22,895
And I'm sorry to show up
at your home unannounced...

1329
01:30:23,004 --> 01:30:26,201
but I didn't think you would
take my call, so I just-

1330
01:30:26,307 --> 01:30:28,468
<i>I took a chance,
and I thought I'd come by to-</i>

1331
01:30:28,576 --> 01:30:31,943
to see if you can look
at this broken fingernail.

1332
01:30:33,581 --> 01:30:38,985
So you flew 8,000 miles to ask me
to look at a broken fingernail?

1333
01:30:39,086 --> 01:30:42,419
Yeah, because, I mean,
it could get infected.

1334
01:30:42,523 --> 01:30:46,220
And a girlfriend of mine, she had
to get her whole hand amputated.

1335
01:30:46,327 --> 01:30:50,320
Well, maybe that's not
the only reason I came.

1336
01:30:50,431 --> 01:30:55,528
Truth is, Tunde, um,
I flew all this way to- to say I'm sorry.

1337
01:30:55,636 --> 01:30:58,537
<i>And I know it's too late
to win you back...</i>

1338
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,040
<i>but I hope you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.</i>

1339
01:31:02,143 --> 01:31:04,805
And I just want you to know
if, uh-

1340
01:31:04,912 --> 01:31:09,576
if you ever regret meeting me,
I don't regret meeting you...

1341
01:31:09,684 --> 01:31:12,414
because it changed my life.

1342
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:18,117
<i>And, Tunde, you helped me see things
that no other man was able to.</i>

1343
01:31:18,226 --> 01:31:22,219
You were offering me so much,
but I didn't love myself...

1344
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:25,697
<i>and I couldn't understand
why in the hell you wanted me...</i>

1345
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,394
so I couldn't love you.

1346
01:31:28,502 --> 01:31:32,302
<i>But thanks to you, Tunde,
I'm- I'm a different person.</i>

1347
01:31:32,406 --> 01:31:35,102
<i>And I hope one day I will-</i>

1348
01:31:35,209 --> 01:31:39,202
I will find another man
as wonderful as you.

1349
01:31:39,313 --> 01:31:41,543

Jazmin, thank you.

1352
01:31:49,223 --> 01:31:52,784
And tell your wife I am so sorry
for barging in on y'all like that.

1353

but I'm no home wrecker.

My wife?

1355
01:31:58,099 --> 01:32:00,829
The last time I checked,
I was still a single man.

1356
01:32:00,935 --> 01:32:04,462
The woman that answered
the door ain't your wife?

1357
01:32:04,572 --> 01:32:07,632
Heavens no. She's one
of the housekeepers.

1358
01:32:07,742 --> 01:32:10,609
<i>- And her baby?
- I delivered the baby...</i>

1359
01:32:10,711 --> 01:32:12,838
but had nothing to do
with the conception.

1360
01:32:12,947 --> 01:32:16,610
- But she said-
- Well, I doubt she said much of anything.

1361
01:32:16,717 --> 01:32:19,345
She doesn't even
speak English.

1362
01:32:19,453 --> 01:32:22,013
Hey, y'all,
it was a false alarm!

She was the maid! Okay.

01:32:24,959 --> 01:32:30,158
So- So, why ain't no woman
snatched you up yet?

1365
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:42,041
I was waiting on you,
Jazmin.

1366
01:32:42,143 --> 01:32:45,010
I never stopped
thinking about you.

1367
01:32:45,112 --> 01:32:48,980
I prayed that one day
we would meet again...

1368
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:53,577
and you will accept how beautiful
you are and let me love you.

1369
01:32:55,656 --> 01:32:59,422
Well, looks like my prayers
have been answered.

1370
01:33:01,929 --> 01:33:05,330
Jazmin, if you will have me-

1371
01:33:05,433 --> 01:33:07,333
Have you?

1372
01:33:08,703 --> 01:33:10,603
