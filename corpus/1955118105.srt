1
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,218
<i>Amen.</i>

2
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,489
Dear lord, our father in heaven.

3
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,392
You are the physician
of our souls.

4
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:05,831
We beseech thee, protect
this young woman's soul...

5
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,236
our lord and savior...

6
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,110
<i>Vanquish this diabolic being.</i>

7
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,646
Protect this young woman,
body and soul,

8
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:25,016
from all spiritual poison.

9
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,753
<i>In the name of Jesus Christ,
our lord and savior...</i>

10
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:36,027
young woman...

11
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,296
Hello, gorgeous.

12
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,613
Hello, Ava.

13
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,348
I'm father merino.

14
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,085
Your parents asked me
to be here to help.

15
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,757
Boy it's nice to,
to see the real you.

16
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,196
You see, I've been here
for a while...

17
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,599
But it wasn't you
that I was talking with.

18
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:29,741
I-it was an ancient,
malicious entity,

19
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,543
and it's gone now.

20
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,279
It's not possible.

21
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,714
No, no.

22
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,584
This is a joke, right?

23
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,219
This is... this is a joke.

24
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,088
I know you're frightened

25
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,159
and exhausted and confused,
but it's not a joke.

26
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,763
You've been being controlled
by a spirit

27
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,531
that was not your own.

28
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,704
Okay, okay.

29
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,973
Let's pray.

30
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,444
Dear father in heaven.

31
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:11,916
Thank you for returning Ava,
to this life.

32
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,994
How are you feeling, Ava?

33
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,829
There she is.

34
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,866
Hey Ava, you look great.
Hope you're hungry.

35
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,467
Cut it out.

36
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,337
What? She looks great.

37
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,449
How long has it been?

38
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,452
It's been a month, Ava.

39
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,089
Did anyone call in sick for me?

40
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,458
Uh...

41
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,526
I doubt it.

42
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,666
More lo mein?

43
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,835
No, I'm good, thanks.

44
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,003
Ava.

45
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,672
This thing that managed to get
inside of you

46
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,476
should be a real wake-up call.

47
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,814
Are you, uh, are you still
smoking marijuana?

48
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,018
Are you seriously blaming me
for getting possessed?

49
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,288
I mean, it's
a gateway drug, okay?

50
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,527
<i>I wish you would let us
put you in a hotel.</i>

51
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,062
Your father's right, darling.

52
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,198
You really can't live like this.

53
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,766
I didn't have time to clean.

54
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,901
Oh Ava, it's a dump.

55
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,704
It doesn't matter
how much you clean it up.

56
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,940
Well, we're gonna
come back and check on you.

57
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,608
Whatever, just call first.

58
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,676
Uh-huh.

59
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,009
Oh, sweetie.

60
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,647
I guess the district attorney,

61
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,417
uh, has several videos
like this.

62
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,655
And you're up for indictment
for multiple charges.

63
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,924
Wait, what other charges?

64
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,092
What other charges?

65
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:39,330
Ava, you...
Property damage, assault,

66
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,667
indecent exposure,
two counts of possession...

67
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,237
Narcotics.

68
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,409
I mean, we're talking about
serious jail time here.

69
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,445
Jail?

70
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,347
Bloody maniac,
running through the streets,

71
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,685
like, hurting people
usually go to jail.

72
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,187
Yeah.

73
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,122
Your... your... your parents
are lobbying to put you

74
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,025
in some kind of
residential facility.

75
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,793
But I don't belong
in a facility.

76
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,096
No, you don't,
you don't belong in a facility.

77
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,333
There is a third option
and it's called, uh,

78
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,836
spirit possession anonymous.

79
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,504
It's funded by the government.

80
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:23,341
It's in association
with the church, go figure.

81
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,377
And you go
through the treatment and...

82
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,047
And they erase all the charges.

83
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:34,986
One thing, you are required
to study this handbook

84
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,656
so you're prepared
for the first day.

85
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,527
It's kind of, uh, like aa
for people like you.

86
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:50,535
Okay, yeah,
I'll go with option three.

87
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,404
Okay, I'm gonna
inform the judge right now.

88
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,140
I think you made a fantastic
decision, sweetheart.

89
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,500
Hello?

90
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,522
<i>Hey Carl, it's me.</i>

91
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,995
<i>I'd love to hear your voice.
I really miss you.</i>

92
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,164
Please call me back
as soon as you get this.

93
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,341
How 'bout tomorrow?

94
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,611
Okay, just let him know
I'm feeling better

95
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,081
and I can come back to work.

96
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,351
<i>Okay.</i>

97
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:11,142
"To Conrad.
Thirty years of wedded bliss."

98
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,877
Who's Conrad?

99
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,480
<i>Hello?</i>

100
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,148
<i>Hey, how's it goin'?</i>

101
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,784
<i>Uh... are you better now?</i>

102
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,519
<i>I guess so.</i>

103
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,688
<i>Sarah says hi.</i>

104
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,857
Hi, Sarah.

105
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,859
Do you guys maybe want to
hang out later?

106
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,128
She wants to hang out.

107
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,162
Um...

108
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,966
<i>Sarah asks if it's safe.</i>

109
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,200
Tell Sarah to wear a raincoat

110
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,903
'cause I've got pea soup
spraying out of my butt.

111
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,339
That's an exorcist reference.

112
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,976
<i>Yeah, I know, it was funny.</i>

113
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,577
<i>She sounds normal.</i>

114
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,578
<i>Okay.</i>

115
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,080
<i>We'll text you.</i>

116
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,943
Cheers!

117
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:25,016
So... was it
kinda like being pregnant?

118
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,618
'Cause you had this thing
inside of you.

119
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,289
I pictured that as being
a more beautiful experience.

120
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,590
W-what are you gonna do

121
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,793
about picking up
the pieces of your life?

122
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,128
My life's not really in pieces.

123
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,798
I just have
a few things to sort out.

124
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,367
It'll be back to normal
next week.

125
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,969
Totally.

126
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,037
Yeah.

127
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,541
Whoo.

128
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,077
So what's up with
Roxanne's birthday party?

129
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,479
Did it change?

130
00:11:55,815 --> 00:12:00,952
Um, well, you're sort of
not invited anymore.

131
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,888
People are just
really freaked out still.

132
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,056
Yeah.

133
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,724
And you sort of
acted like a mega-bitch

134
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,159
while you were possessed.

135
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,161
And a slut.

136
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,797
W-which is fine,

137
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,935
but you did sleep with
Roxanne's boyfriend.

138
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,637
Does Carl know?

139
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,140
I don't know the detail...
I just heard.

140
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,043
Ava...

141
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,815
What is it?

142
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,217
Do you hear that?

143
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,320
Hear what?

144
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,950
Something's wrong with her.

145
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,340
Fuck, I knew
we shouldn't have come here!

146
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,081
Ava, are you okay?

147
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,519
What just happened, Ava?

148
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,254
Nothing. I-I-I...

149
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,026
I-I just drank that too fast.

150
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,129
You guys should just go
'cause you're gonna be late.

151
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,897
Are you upset?

152
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,800
No, no, I just,
I have a lot of stuff to do

153
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,104
and, uh, pieces of my life
to pick up and whatnot.

154
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,907
Okay.

155
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,743
Well, we'll give Roxanne
a kiss for you.

156
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,645
Oh, I'm sure she'll love that.

157
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,187
Oh, shit!

158
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,682
Shh!

159
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,508
Shh!

160
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,610
Uh... did I...?

161
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,412
No, I'm sorry, Darlene.

162
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,415
You can try again, okay?

163
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,350
Alright, that's it for today.

164
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,752
Louie, Casey, get her
out of this thing please.

165
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,157
I really apologize...

166
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,658
Don't ever come late again.

167
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,727
I'm sorry.

168
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,366
Alright, let's go get your files

169
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,668
so you can be prepared
for the next time.

170
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,270
What was that necklace?

171
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,039
If you read the manual,
you'd know.

172
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,175
It's a spirit steeper,
you put it on

173
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,609
and the last spirit
that possessed you

174
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,111
is invited back.

175
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,813
We record everything
on that camera there,

176
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,048
and we chart your progress.

177
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:59,023
If you can remove
the spirit steeper on your own,

178
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,124
while possessed,

179
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,226
then you've
completed the training.

180
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,329
If I have to remove it
for you, then...

181
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,997
The therapy continues.

182
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,866
There's also a lot of homework.

183
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,735
You're gonna have some pretty
uncomfortable conversations

184
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,370
with your family
and your friends.

185
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,538
Yeah, I think
I already stumbled into those.

186
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:21,078
You need to look for clues,
piece together lost memories.

187
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,014
What is all this stuff?

188
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:28,753
Old cases... files on everyone,
even before I worked here.

189
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:32,323
Dates back to 1982, I think.

190
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:41,365
This is your priest report on
your uninvited spiritual guest.

191
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,535
People you hurt or injured
while you were possessed.

192
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,337
You're gonna need to make
amends with them.

193
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,072
Does it say why it chose me?

194
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,374
No, it doesn't.

195
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,711
The goal is not
to determine why.

196
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,013
Is it possible, my demon...

197
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,215
We don't use the "d" word here.

198
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,418
Did you even look at the manual?

199
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,554
I'm sorry. Yeah,
I flipped through it.

200
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:08,592
Is it possible it's my fault?

201
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,860
Well, it could be random,

202
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,530
or karmic,
or induced by a third party.

203
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,266
But more important
than placing blame

204
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,802
is preventing it
from happening again.

205
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,272
I've been seeing...

206
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,378
Crazy visions.
Like waking nightmares.

207
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,946
That's the spirit.

208
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,187
It's trying to come back.

209
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:52,837
"Naphula is a
six-foot-one-inch tall succubus,"

210
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:56,373
"a feline hybrid
of a dragon, bird and goat."

211
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,680
"He is depicted carrying a drum.

212
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,716
The sound of the drums
signals his approach."

213
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,527
That's her.

214
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,662
Hi.

215
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,265
I know who you are.

216
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,502
Demon! No.

217
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,837
Be gone! Go away!

218
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm better now! Be gone!

219
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,210
I-I'm... I'm
happy to take the time,

220
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,513
just keep your distance.

221
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,148
The cops brought you in
for a psych evaluation.

222
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,150
They said
they wanted you sedated.

223
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,220
You'd been jumping over cars
causing accidents.

224
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,524
But when I went to administer
the benzodiazepine,

225
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,393
you broke though the cuffs
on the stretcher,

226
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,462
and you chewed
right through my finger.

227
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,732
Specifically?

228
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,868
You shoved your tongue
down my throat

229
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,504
and smashed my head
into the ATM three times.

230
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,906
I'm sorry.

231
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,744
Did I...

232
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,879
Say anything?

233
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,882
Yeah, you did actually.

234
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,819
"<i> Ad miseriam esurio</i> ."
Over and over.

235
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,054
I looked it up

236
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:17,821
because it was ringing
through my head for days,

237
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,657
driving me crazy.

238
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,058
It's Latin.

239
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,295
It means "for your misery,
I hunger."

240
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,097
<i>Hey Carl, it's me...</i>

241
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,699
<i>Again.</i>

242
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,870
<i>Uh, I guess you're upset at me.</i>

243
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,240
I am so, so sorry...

244
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,241
<i>Hello.</i>

245
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:40,377
Hey. Hi.

246
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,779
You're there.

247
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:46,116
<i>Yeah.
Look, please stop calling me.</i>

248
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,352
Wait Carl, I'm better now.

249
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,354
Can we please just meet
and talk about this?

250
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,522
<i>No. I don't,</i>

251
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,357
<i>I don't want to see you anymore.</i>

252
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,859
<i>Look, we broke up.</i>

253
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,528
But...

254
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,463
<i>I-I get that you
don't remember, but it's over.</i>

255
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:05,703
Ava, honestly, forget about him.

256
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,039
If a demon isn't an excuse
for a little indiscretion,

257
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,441
I don't know what is.

258
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,777
Ooh.
"Say goodbye to split ends."

259
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,047
What if my possession
wasn't an excuse, though.

260
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,283
What if it's bad Karma,
like mom said.

261
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,918
Mom has her own issues.

262
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,320
They have nothing to do
with you.

263
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,788
She just thinks they do.

264
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,961
Hi everybody, my name's Ava.

265
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,898
My uninvited spiritual guest
possessed me for 28 days

266
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,401
and was exorcised on Tuesday.

267
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,902
Tell us its name.

268
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,007
Naphula, the anointed.

269
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,112
In the grand scheme
of the 36 legions of hell,

270
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:53,450
he's sort of the, uh,
entitled, arrogant rich kid.

271
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:58,656
He likes to come up
for joyrides in human bodies.

272
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,091
And he carries a drum...

273
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,862
That he beats as he approaches.

274
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,464
Mine was drekavac, the cursed.

275
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,533
He's from the souls
of murdered babies.

276
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:12,803
My evil spirit's orivus,
he made me eat my dog.

277
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,873
Guys...
Let's let Ava talk, okay?

278
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,444
I found this in my couch,

279
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,280
and I don't know
how it go there.

280
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,582
Oh, that could be
a good place to start.

281
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:30,688
"To Conrad.

282
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,690
For thirty years
of wedded bliss."

283
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:35,359
Do you know who this Conrad is?

284
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,860
No.

285
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,029
This is a cheri Cher watch.

286
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,331
There's a store in Soho.

287
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,535
Abaddon, the annihilator
shoplifted from there.

288
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,604
That's my demon's name.
The "d" word, Hazel.

289
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,474
Such a pointless rule.

290
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,875
Hazel!

291
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,311
Don't make this any more
serious than it already is.

292
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,247
Anything else?

293
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,586
There was a...

294
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:06,323
A little blood on the floor
in my living room.

295
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,027
But I don't know
whose blood it is.

296
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,528
Probably your own.

297
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,230
It could be animal blood.

298
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,531
Did you have any pets?

299
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,701
Louie, haven't we
talked about this?

300
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,304
Barnabas is in
a better place now.

301
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,515
Hey, new girl.

302
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,785
Got the hots for Tony yet?

303
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,688
Mmm, not really my type.

304
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,090
What's going on
between you and him?

305
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,225
He caught me sneaking in there

306
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:44,061
a couple weeks ago
so I'm on thin ice.

307
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,462
Or whatever.

308
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,697
You broke into the church?

309
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,867
Yeah,
I want that amulet he's got.

310
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,968
The spirit steeper?

311
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,538
But why? Is it worth a lot?

312
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,140
Probably.

313
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,375
I would use it
to get my demon back.

314
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,945
Why would you wanna do that?

315
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,448
There was
a connection between us.

316
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,884
And I think
it was special for him too.

317
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,118
I was the first girl.

318
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,721
Abaddon, the annihilator
had ever been inside of.

319
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,990
In that way.

320
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,292
And he's got this sexy scar
on the side of his cheek

321
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,561
from when an archangel
slashed him.

322
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,899
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'll see you at the next one.

323
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:22,966
Alright.

324
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,828
You didn't have to help.

325
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,663
Don't you have
a giant wedding to plan?

326
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:55,632
Oh, uh, we pushed back the date.

327
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,834
Not because of
what happened to you,

328
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:59,403
we just needed more time.

329
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,506
Look what I got...

330
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,508
To replace
the one grandpa gave me.

331
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,444
It's exactly the same, right?

332
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,849
Oh. It got destroyed?

333
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,617
No, it went missing.

334
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,620
I remember
not being able to find it.

335
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,456
It's one of
the last memories I had...

336
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,191
Before the demon.

337
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,895
Ava?

338
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,564
You okay?

339
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:30,968
What's wrong?

340
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,703
I'm okay.

341
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:33,770
I'm okay.

342
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:36,907
Whoa, whoa!

343
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:40,811
Okay, okay, alright.
I got her, I got her.

344
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:41,812
Okay.

345
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,046
Let's get her in your bed.

346
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,055
<i>Why are you
acting like this is your fault?</i>

347
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:56,393
<i>She's not your responsibility.</i>

348
00:24:56,395 --> 00:25:00,197
<i>It's just that
things are different now.</i>

349
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,199
<i>Exactly.
And if we're not careful,</i>

350
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,334
<i>she's going to find out
what happened.</i>

351
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,545
<i>You know, I gotta say,</i>

352
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,581
<i>I'm with mom and dad
on this one.</i>

353
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,517
<i>She's not fit
to take care of herself.</i>

354
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,085
<i>She needs to go away
for a while,</i>

355
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,620
<i>get some proper care.</i>

356
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,789
<i>You need to stop
calling them mom and dad.</i>

357
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,425
I'm part of the family now.

358
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,496
Just... We're not married yet.

359
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,300
Well, we might as well be,
after what I did.

360
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:50,547
Hey, Ava. How ya feeling?

361
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,649
A little better, thanks.

362
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,052
These came for you
while you were asleep.

363
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,988
Maybe you've got
a secret admirer.

364
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,758
They're from my boss.

365
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,061
A bunch of the bands
I represent signed it.

366
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,929
They want me to come back.

367
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,799
See? Things are gonna
get back to normal in no time.

368
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,039
Where's Hank?

369
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,078
Someone needs to
check on the girls backstage,

370
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,579
I'll be back in a minute.

371
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,017
Ava, no way!

372
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,018
You're looking good.

373
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,019
Thanks.

374
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,020
How's it been going?

375
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,021
It's going good.

376
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,123
Apparently,
you've got a new single.

377
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,524
<i>Duke, we're ready!</i>

378
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:37,928
Go see.

379
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,902
<i>La, la, la, la, la...</i>

380
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,074
<i>La, la, la, la, la...</i>

381
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,775
Ava, Ava.

382
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,480
Ava.

383
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:06,716
Jesus, Ava,

384
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,286
I'm-I'm sorry if the song
upset you, but...

385
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:12,355
You're not really
releasing that, are you?

386
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,423
It's clearly a hit.

387
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,893
It's not funny.
It really happened.

388
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,362
Maybe the lyrics are a metaphor.

389
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,131
Yeah, it's like poetic license.

390
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,133
Shut up, Hank.

391
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,602
He looks like a sex offender
in that outfit.

392
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:30,874
You know what, little Dukie,

393
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,710
I found you, I signed you,

394
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,712
and I decide what sounds
like a single.

395
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,214
And it's not this.

396
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,615
Maybe it's not time
for you to come back

397
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,951
and start making decisions
just yet.

398
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,127
Thanks for the
get-well-soon card, assholes.

399
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,604
Hi, I found a cheri Cher watch

400
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,572
I'd like to return to the owner.

401
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,008
There's an inscription on it.

402
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,144
It says, um, "to Conrad."

403
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,513
Thirty years of wedded bliss."

404
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,682
Okay.

405
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,540
Hi, I'm supposed to
meet with Ben.

406
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,008
Ben just stepped in the back
for a moment.

407
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,075
He'll be right out.

408
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,245
Have I been here before?

409
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,082
I don't know.

410
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:52,122
I'm sorry, um, perhaps you'd
like to join our mailing list.

411
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,430
You sure you don't recognize me?

412
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,633
Should I?

413
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,634
No, no, no.

414
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,769
Not if you don't.

415
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,650
Ava. Yes. Ben?

416
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,219
Thank you for
going through all the trouble

417
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:25,488
with calling the store
and coming here.

418
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,724
It's a damn good watch.

419
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,893
Where did you find it?

420
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,862
On the street outside
of my building.

421
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,998
So you've never met my father?

422
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,166
Your father?

423
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,434
Conrad.

424
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:38,568
Oh.

425
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,437
This was a gift
from my mother to him.

426
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,906
She passed away a few years ago.

427
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,708
That's why
the store contacted me.

428
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,243
Well I'd really
like to meet Conrad,

429
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,744
if at all possible.

430
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:50,513
He's away on business, a lot.

431
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,615
What kind of business?

432
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,185
Art, among other things.

433
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,120
He owns this gallery with me.

434
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,535
I-I-I should really get going.

435
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,437
It was really nice to meet you.

436
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,990
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

437
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,458
Nothing anymore.

438
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,726
I was fired.

439
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,961
Ooh.

440
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,665
Are you a bad girl?

441
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,168
You need to learn to be
a little more cutthroat.

442
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,305
Well, when I was possessed,
I cut some throats.

443
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,008
Snarl.

444
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,378
Stretch out your facial muscles.

445
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,617
Remember, when you
face the dark spirits,

446
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:03,019
they must also face you.

447
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,521
<i>She is a riot, man.</i>

448
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:08,425
She is a real riot.

449
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,526
Told you.

450
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:10,627
No, really.

451
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,529
Ava, please not here.

452
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,964
I was possessed.

453
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,701
You all have a target
on your back, people.

454
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:21,004
Once you've been possessed,
you are ten times more likely

455
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:24,174
to be repossessed, revisited.

456
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,242
So let's not make it
easy for 'em, shall we.

457
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,681
More angry. Do not let them
take you over.

458
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:35,518
It's your body, claim
possession, claim ownership,

459
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,455
claim the right
to your existence.

460
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,123
Hazel, hit the goddamn thing!

461
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,192
Come on, harder! Two hands, go.

462
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,293
Two hands.

463
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,195
Come on, Hazel. Come on, Hazel!

464
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,564
That was embarrassing.

465
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,733
Fastest date in history.

466
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:52,602
Well, if he can't accept
my inner demons, then fuck him.

467
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,305
Totally.

468
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,576
Hi, Ava.

469
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,412
Hi, mom.
I told you to call first.

470
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:37,614
You're not
supposed to be drinking.

471
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,516
Haven't you heard,
I can handle my spirits.

472
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,451
Oh, you think it's funny?

473
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,853
What are you,
some kind of expert.

474
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,222
How can you possibly know
what this has been like for me?

475
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,191
I just know, okay?

476
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,027
I've had my share
of difficulties.

477
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:56,032
Zinc, one a day, with meals.

478
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,301
Here's your calcium.

479
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:01,271
Something happened here that
you guys aren't telling me.

480
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,374
I found blood
under the rug over there.

481
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,876
Someone tried to cover it up.

482
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,213
Well, you hurt yourself,
we cleaned it up. So?

483
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,382
Part of my therapy is I have to
confront all of the bad things

484
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,750
that I did head on.

485
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:16,820
I hope you're not spilling
your guts to those hippies.

486
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,622
Those hippies
are the only people

487
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,357
helping me recover.

488
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:26,129
Trust me when I say

489
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:29,232
you don't want to know any more.

490
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,900
Just leave it alone.

491
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,841
Ginseng...

492
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,180
Hey Tony,
you said the possession

493
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,517
could be induced
by a third party.

494
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,585
How?

495
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,454
What did you mean by that?

496
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,990
By invoking runic
or psychokinetic energy.

497
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:56,659
Maleficium or Vamachara.

498
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,760
What's that?

499
00:34:58,797 --> 00:34:59,996
Black magic.

500
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:06,469
Truth is we don't know
exactly how it works.

501
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,005
It's like breaking and entering.

502
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:12,242
Spectral doorways open,
the barrier's weakened.

503
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,745
Spirit slips in.

504
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,314
The whole point
of what we do here

505
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,117
is to make you possession-proof.

506
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,519
Lay the right
foundational bricks

507
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:27,257
so that no one or no thing
can ever get in again.

508
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,656
Remember me, doll-face?

509
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,358
You chewed my ear
like a little rat.

510
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,660
Well you danced
with the wrong matador,

511
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,596
'cause I will carve out
your fuckin' eyes.

512
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,364
Now I want my money.

513
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,532
Plus interest.

514
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,502
Plus damages. Plus fuck you.

515
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,003
I don't remember.

516
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,439
I'm sorry.
Oh, you don't remember?

517
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:20,510
You don't remember Noelle
with your titties in her face?

518
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,513
Now I don't care
if you're a girl or a boy

519
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,849
or a pig or a dog
or a monkey vegetarian,

520
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,384
or an episcopalian.

521
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,788
If you're with one of Escobar's
girls, you gotta pay...

522
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:36,092
One way or another.

523
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,862
Now open up your wallet
and show me your money.

524
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,433
And your jewelry too.

525
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,538
Ow, ow, ow.

526
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:05,321
Come on, Darlene, you can do it.

527
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,090
I mean, what are the odds

528
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,692
that two twin sisters
both get possessed.

529
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,431
Maybe it's genetic?
I heard that can happen.

530
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,468
What are you doing Saturday?

531
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,836
Do you wanna hang out?

532
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,738
Sure.

533
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,739
Fight it.

534
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,173
Fight this spirit, fight it.

535
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:29,579
C'mon.

536
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:34,017
C'mon. Fight it. You can do it.

537
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,585
I know you can do it!

538
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,859
That a girl!

539
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,531
You did it.

540
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,266
Give me this.

541
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,237
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

542
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:02,311
Cut my hand
as a warning, I guess.

543
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,813
And ran off.

544
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:07,016
Sounds like he was
some sort of pimp or something,

545
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,518
which explains why he's not
on the list of people

546
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,953
pressing charges against you.

547
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,356
Did he tell you the name
of the woman?

548
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,825
Yeah, Noelle.

549
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,627
Maybe she's a prostitute.

550
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,729
You're gonna have to
talk to Noelle.

551
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,631
You're gonna have to
meet her in person.

552
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,700
How am I supposed to find her?

553
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:26,803
There's nothing easy
about this process, Ava.

554
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,171
Some of these people have been
coming here for years

555
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,606
with little or no progress.

556
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,577
You know what Hazel would say?

557
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,846
You keep us chasing the past,

558
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,181
so that you can
keep this place filled up,

559
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:39,515
so you've got a job.

560
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,018
That sound's like
something Hazel would say.

561
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,753
What do you say?

562
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:44,987
I'd say...

563
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,190
Did I really do something
when I was possessed

564
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,759
that your average scumbag
hasn't already done?

565
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:54,197
That's a pretty
bleak outlook, Ava.

566
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,832
You may want to
change your perspective.

567
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,619
I got you a little present.

568
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:22,024
Oh, that's nice.

569
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,494
Thanks for the Jade elephant.
That's...

570
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,698
J.J...

571
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,866
What do you,
want do you want from me?

572
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,234
What do you, what do you...

573
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,302
What do you want me to do?

574
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,470
You got a guy in city hall

575
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,272
who can like track down people?

576
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,976
Yes.

577
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,778
How about a prostitute?

578
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,448
Wait, a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

579
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,784
Are you, are you trying to
get me a prostitute right now?

580
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:50,286
No, it's part of my therapy.

581
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,556
Is that two separate
thoughts there?

582
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:57,326
I gotta find people
and talk to them, make amends.

583
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,295
You want me to track down
a prostitute for you?

584
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,663
Yes, please.

585
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,900
I like where this is going.

586
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:07,503
Hello?

587
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,005
<i>Hi, this is Ben Branson.</i>

588
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:11,007
- Oh, hi.
<i>- Could I ask you to, um,</i>

589
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,276
<i>come out for a drink with me,
as a thank you?</i>

590
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,977
<i>Conrad would say
that's the decent thing to do</i>

591
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,612
<i>for returning his watch.</i>

592
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,181
Yeah, sure.

593
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,487
<i>I thought we were
going out for a drink.</i>

594
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,758
More fitting gift,

595
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,860
would be letting you chose
whatever you like.

596
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:32,428
Are you serious?

597
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,198
You can take any piece you want.

598
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,935
Unless you don't like anything.

599
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,547
I like this one.

600
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:56,219
This is one of my favorites.

601
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,521
Leda and the swan.

602
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,456
That's a swan?

603
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,859
It's actually
the Greek god Zeus.

604
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,861
He took the form of a swan

605
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:08,231
in order to seduce
a woman named Leda.

606
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,732
I thought it was an angel.

607
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,436
Greek gods are
kind of like fallen angels.

608
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,341
Is this Conrad?

609
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,408
Yes.

610
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,547
I don't think
I could work for my family.

611
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,082
I can relate.

612
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,917
I love that Conrad travels.

613
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,553
Let's me run this place
the way I want.

614
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,388
That's good...

615
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,723
That you know what you want.

616
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:42,098
Sorry, it's my lawyer calling.

617
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,335
J.J.?

618
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,436
<i>What's up, kiddo?</i>

619
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,871
<i>Uh, I have a lead</i>

620
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,741
<i>on that Noelle woman
you're looking for.</i>

621
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:52,875
You have a number?

622
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,543
<i>Uh, no, I have an address,</i>

623
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,713
and I hear she's only there
for another hour.

624
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:58,714
Tonight?

625
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,716
Yeah, tonight. What? Come on.

626
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,084
Oh, shit.

627
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,519
Ben, I'm so sorry I have to go.

628
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,921
It was nice to see you again.

629
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:06,122
But...

630
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:41,991
Your loss, baby.

631
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:43,059
You'll be back.

632
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:46,896
Take a look at that guy.

633
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,566
Take a look at this bitch.

634
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,635
There's that crazy bitch
that chewed up Escobar.

635
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,570
Hey, is one of you Noelle?

636
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,781
You remember me?

637
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,950
How could I forget.
What do you want?

638
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,785
You're gonna have to pay first.

639
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,420
I'm talkin' Benjamins.

640
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,790
Can we talk somewhere?

641
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:15,858
Yeah.

642
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,529
Welcome back to hotel Noelle.

643
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,367
Oh, wow.

644
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:25,801
This is nice.

645
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:28,371
So I-I don't remember
the night we met.

646
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:31,507
No, no, no, no, no.
I just wanna talk.

647
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:33,509
I don't say no to money, honey,

648
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,845
but I ain't no psychoanalyst.

649
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,480
Listen, I'll be
out of your way in five minutes.

650
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:40,783
I just need to know
what happened that night.

651
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,319
You really
don't remember anything.

652
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:46,555
No. I was possessed...

653
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,524
By a demon.

654
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:51,360
Holy fuck. Is that contagious?

655
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:52,862
I don't think so.

656
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:55,331
Good. 'Cause I've got enough
problems without that shit.

657
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,866
Okay, well, I just need to know

658
00:43:56,868 --> 00:44:01,137
how I found you,
what I said to you.

659
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,738
Yeah,
I was in here with some guy,

660
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,840
and you showed up
and climbed in.

661
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,375
You stripped down
to your underwear

662
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,045
and next thing I know
we were all going at it.

663
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:13,349
I saw you earlier, you were like
following him, I think.

664
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:17,686
I figured you were his wife
or girlfriend or something.

665
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:22,224
I've seen people play
all sorts of kinky games.

666
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,692
So we knew each other?

667
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,694
Definitely.

668
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,730
He really liked you.

669
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:30,166
His name wasn't Conrad, was it?

670
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,869
I don't do names, baby.

671
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:34,937
Okay.

672
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,374
I'm gonna give you my number.

673
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:40,443
If you can please
try to find out

674
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:45,214
any more information
on the guy, call me.

675
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:48,117
Oh fuck, it's Escobar!

676
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,452
Get your little ass out here!

677
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:51,854
I swear to god,
she made, she made me!

678
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,222
Now let me get this straight.

679
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:54,790
You come to my Chuck e cheese

680
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,126
and you throw your own
goddamn pizza party?

681
00:44:57,128 --> 00:45:00,096
I told you Escobar's girls
are off limits to you bitch.

682
00:45:00,098 --> 00:45:02,098
Do you have a death wish?

683
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,766
Now if I catch you
around here again,

684
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:06,268
I will snuff out
your little light.

685
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,245
I know how it feels, Ava.

686
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:17,980
All my friends hate me now too.

687
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,886
Except Eliza,
who I saved from a rapist.

688
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:27,890
I beat the shit out of him
with supernatural strength?

689
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,726
That's fucking awesome.

690
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,061
Wow.

691
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,497
I don't think mine did
anything heroic like that.

692
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:38,000
Oh, yeah, and I was
way more effective at PR.

693
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:39,168
I got a raise,

694
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,337
the clients said
I was more fun to be around.

695
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,672
I mean, eventually I got fired

696
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,609
for ripping
my co-worker's hair out.

697
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:50,279
But what if you could
control a demon?

698
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:54,016
You know,
like training an animal,

699
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:57,520
like how people can learn
to fly in their dreams.

700
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,155
I guess
that would be pretty cool.

701
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:02,424
Yeah.

702
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:08,497
Hey, wanna do something crazy?

703
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,806
Look, there's only three
of these stores in New York.

704
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,842
Tony sent my photo
to all of them,

705
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:22,678
so they won't sell to me.

706
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,180
There's some
black magic website,

707
00:46:24,182 --> 00:46:27,116
but I hate shopping online.

708
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,117
So, all I have to do

709
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,552
is buy this spell for you?

710
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,521
And perform it.

711
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:36,325
I can't perform my own spell.

712
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:38,260
What makes you think
I can even do that?

713
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,796
You've been possessed before.

714
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,765
What makes you think
I would do that?

715
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,035
You're my friend.

716
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,573
You do realize
that if we break Tony's rules,

717
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:52,408
we could get
in a lot of trouble.

718
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,378
Have Tony's rules
helped you at all?

719
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,247
Have you had any results
from his therapy?

720
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:18,867
- Hello.
- Hi.

721
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:22,871
I-I'm here to pick up
a demonium invitabo spell.

722
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,574
Mm-hmm. First time?

723
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:29,111
Yeah.

724
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:33,382
I should warn you,
it'll change you.

725
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:36,018
Oh, no, I've been
possessed before.

726
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,087
I meant invocation.

727
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:39,888
The spell.

728
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:44,093
Forces like these,
they leave their mark.

729
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,530
The instructions are inside,

730
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,867
all the ingredients for
the potion, the incantation.

731
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,670
Do you need a ceremonial cloak,
or do you have your own?

732
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,540
What's that?

733
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,876
That's just the frog.

734
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,879
It's supposed to be sedated.

735
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,282
You need to sacrifice it.

736
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:08,417
I have to sacrifice it?

737
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,718
Oh, Jesus.

738
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,388
I just hope there are
no more surprises.

739
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,556
Good luck with that.

740
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,397
Okay. So, almost done.

741
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,765
You just have to

742
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:26,602
"burn an item
that belonged to the host,"

743
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:29,305
that's me, "...Since childhood"

744
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:30,339
and read this...

745
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:34,143
Aw, I had one of these.

746
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:36,011
Are you sure you want me to...

747
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,913
Yeah, yeah. It's worth it.

748
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:41,417
Yeah, and you know,

749
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,519
give it a couple hours,
at least,

750
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:44,920
before you call the priest...

751
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,856
So we can have a little fun.

752
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:48,924
Okay.

753
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,028
Here we go:

754
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:03,505
"<i> Abyssus abyssum invocat-</i>"

755
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:10,045
<i>saeternum-
Terra es, terram ibis-</i>

756
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:14,717
<i>ecce quomodo moritur,</i>

757
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:19,888
<i>hoc sustinate damnosa
hereditas...</i>

758
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,197
Hazel!

759
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,565
Are you okay?

760
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,071
Hazel, is it working?

761
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,249
What have I done?

762
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:50,352
Oh. Oh, my god,
please don't hurt me.

763
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,353
Please don't hurt me.

764
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,255
Please don't hurt me, please...

765
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:55,691
You're... you're really hot,
really hot.

766
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:56,692
You're really hot.

767
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:59,261
And... and...

768
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:02,264
You're...

769
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:03,832
You're really pretty.

770
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,605
That's the spirit.

771
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:22,451
Oh!

772
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,261
Oh shit!

773
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,109
Oh, my god, what happened?

774
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:49,044
Jesus,
what the fuck is wrong with her?

775
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,546
I think she wanted
your soda or something.

776
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,548
Psycho bitch bit my arm.

777
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,715
Or maybe she had rabies.

778
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:54,983
Where did she go?

779
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:57,553
She fucking climbed
that building over there.

780
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,495
<i>Hi, father, it's Ava.</i>

781
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:09,565
Sorry to call so late,
but a friend of mine,

782
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:13,001
a girl named Hazel,
might show up on your radar.

783
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,503
She's possessed.

784
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,572
Uh, please call me
if you hear anything.

785
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,246
Hey.

786
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,116
What are you doing here?

787
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:31,253
You're on our mailing list.

788
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,355
Oh, right.

789
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:34,923
You forgot this...

790
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,862
Do you wanna come inside?

791
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,981
Do you want to talk about why
you left in such a hurry?

792
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:00,082
No.

793
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:06,088
I'll just, um, leave this here.

794
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:12,294
Do you want me to leave?

795
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:13,362
No.

796
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:21,103
What...
What happened to your head?

797
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,030
What's wrong?

798
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:02,938
<i>I didn't put you here, Alice.</i>

799
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,007
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

800
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,743
<i>Why won't you talk to me,
I'm your mother.</i>

801
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:08,744
<i>I have nothing to talk about.</i>

802
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,479
I have to come clean
about something.

803
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,983
What? I, um...

804
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,225
I lied about
where I found the watch.

805
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,530
It was in my apartment.

806
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:36,772
Conrad was here,
and you do know him.

807
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,743
This is awkward.

808
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,389
What?

809
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,391
My friend's in the hospital.

810
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,248
The church will cover the costs

811
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,516
for any broken equipment.

812
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,018
We have insurance for that.

813
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,320
We're gonna take her
to a residential facility.

814
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,988
Ava, thank you
for coming so quickly.

815
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,924
She's been asking for you
desperately.

816
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:30,358
They're about to take her away.

817
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,027
Where? Someplace where

818
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:34,596
she won't be a danger to
herself or anyone else.

819
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:37,766
You should speak to her,
but... go in alone.

820
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:40,736
God bless.

821
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:43,238
I'll be right back.

822
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,619
Hi, Hazel.

823
00:55:57,621 --> 00:56:00,088
Ava, I'm so sorry.

824
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,524
I- I hope you're not in trouble,

825
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,529
but it was so worth it.

826
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:11,066
I mean, I remember
everything this time.

827
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:14,870
Like, every little detail.
I jumped off your roof.

828
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,705
You? You mean, Abaddon...

829
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:19,574
No, it was both of us.

830
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:20,609
We were one.

831
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:23,044
I mean, it wasn't a battle.

832
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:27,582
I wasn't fighting him
and he wasn't controlling me.

833
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:31,720
I made him stronger,
and he made me stronger,

834
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:35,223
and it was better
than the best heroin,

835
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,725
the best ecstasy,

836
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,226
better than any dick
I've ever had.

837
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,327
Hazel, I-I don't
need to know that...

838
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,595
Yes, you do.

839
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:41,830
That's why I wanted to see you,
to tell you,

840
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:44,499
because you believe me.

841
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,169
Sure demons are dark,
but they're just our shadows.

842
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:50,138
Like black matter
or like a doughnut hole,

843
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,940
like negative space.

844
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,275
Nothing makes you more complete

845
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:56,344
than total union
with your shadow.

846
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:15,530
Tony, I, uh, I really
don't feel ready for this.

847
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:19,034
Nobody passes the first time.

848
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:23,705
It's all just part of
the training process.

849
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:25,140
When you learn how to ski,

850
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:27,943
you don't expect to make it
down the black diamond trail

851
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,344
the first try, right?

852
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:32,314
So, this is gonna be
your bunny slope.

853
00:57:32,316 --> 00:57:33,615
I don't ski.

854
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:36,852
You're gonna be fine.

855
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:45,193
What, what?

856
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:46,428
What have you done?

857
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,299
You got a thaumaturgic
mark on your skin.

858
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,500
Right on your neck.

859
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,836
What? Shit.

860
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:57,339
What does it mean?

861
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:58,373
It means you've appealed

862
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,575
to a left-handed
mode of witchery.

863
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,881
It also means
I can't help you anymore.

864
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:09,017
Oh, come on, Tony. I'm so close.

865
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:12,020
These dark powers
that you're just playing with,

866
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:15,557
once they mark you,
they weaken you.

867
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:17,926
Any form of magic,
no matter what the intention,

868
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:21,129
can invite evil inside.

869
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,868
All the progress,
all the work we've done...

870
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,003
It's for nothing.

871
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:31,539
Wow, once a week.

872
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,608
I don't even know
if any of this is gonna work,

873
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,876
but let's try... Excuse me.

874
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,712
We'll make it... What is this?

875
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,381
Excuse me...

876
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:40,916
What is this thing on my neck?

877
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:42,517
You've got these things
all over you.

878
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,720
I told you...
Some spells leave a mark.

879
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,522
I thought you meant
metaphorically.

880
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,524
Like, like visiting
the Grand Canyon

881
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,193
or walking in on your dad naked.

882
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,862
I meant the high cost

883
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:57,532
that must be paid
for summoning such powers.

884
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,868
But this was just
for a friend though.

885
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,237
You summoned the demon.

886
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,741
You awoke the darkness.
You have the mark.

887
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,710
Excuse me, I'm with someone.

888
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:13,381
She's crazy. She's crazy.

889
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,721
The judge knows
you were kicked out of group.

890
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:21,389
I don't see any other choice.

891
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,758
The only alternative is jail.

892
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,628
This is best for you, Ava.

893
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,129
Everyone
who goes into these places

894
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,831
comes out ever crazier.

895
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:33,134
You were kicked out of demon aa.

896
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,070
It doesn't get much crazier.

897
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,672
It's quiet, it's tranquil...

898
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,341
It's in the Adirondacks.

899
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:41,076
It's where you should have gone
in the first place,

900
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:44,179
but he wouldn't listen to me.

901
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,480
J.J. Must have other ideas.

902
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:47,148
Well, J.J.'S been let go.

903
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,650
What? We didn't like the way

904
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:50,685
he handled certain things,
so we let him go.

905
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,754
He enabled you
to look up some prostitute,

906
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,155
and you got attacked...

907
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:55,690
He was helping me.

908
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,425
That was part of my therapy...

909
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,394
Well, that's some therapy.

910
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:04,933
Oh, my god,
who would have thought

911
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:09,804
our family would be
so vulnerable to demons.

912
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:13,441
Honey, you have to go away.

913
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,959
Hello?

914
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,527
Hey, it's Noelle.

915
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:33,862
<i>Hey, Noelle.</i>

916
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:35,030
What'd you find out.

917
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:37,332
<i>I got a name for you.</i>

918
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:39,367
Car's downstairs.
You almost packed?

919
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,568
<i>One of the girls took that guy</i>

920
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,003
<i>you were looking for</i>

921
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,672
to a room where they had to
put down a credit card.

922
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:45,740
What's his name?

923
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,542
Was it Conrad Branson?

924
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:48,543
<i>I'm not telling you anything</i>

925
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:50,912
until you give me more money.

926
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:52,881
You know where to find me.

927
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:54,582
Okay, okay I'll figure it out.

928
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,451
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

929
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:08,029
You know the prostitute?

930
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,665
The one J.J. Helped me find?

931
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,534
I need to see her, tonight.

932
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:13,601
Why?

933
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,205
I can't tell you.

934
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:18,873
What?

935
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,109
Please, I have to see her.

936
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,846
Please.

937
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,081
Alright, listen.

938
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,683
I'll cover for ya.

939
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:32,120
I'll say that you, you ran away.

940
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:35,857
Thanks, dad,
but I have to pay her.

941
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,358
Can I borrow 200 bucks?

942
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:26,574
Oh, shit.

943
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,611
No way. No way.

944
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:33,081
What the hell you do?
You killed Noelle dead.

945
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,482
What, no.

946
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,284
Somebody did, bitch.

947
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:38,853
I've got some scripture wisdom
for your white ass.

948
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:41,656
An eye for an eye.
You know about that bitch?

949
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:44,592
I'm gonna take it out on you.
You're gonna pay.

950
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,194
Escobar...

951
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:48,163
I've had a really bad month.

952
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:50,999
You do not want to
fuck with me right now.

953
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:53,768
Okay. Escobar can turn
the other cheek.

954
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,239
There's no need for trouble.

955
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,681
Are you okay?

956
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:08,750
Oh, my god. Ben.

957
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,320
Oh, my god.

958
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:14,656
Are you following me?

959
01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:16,858
What? I'm trying to protect you.

960
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:20,361
Ava!

961
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:21,963
I saved your fuckin' life
back there.

962
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,064
Why were you even there?

963
01:03:23,066 --> 01:03:26,868
Ava, Ava, please. Listen to me.

964
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,170
When you told me that Conrad
was in your apartment,

965
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:31,406
I realized you're in danger.

966
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,579
He does a lot of
illegal business.

967
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:41,182
Someone must have wanted you
out of the picture.

968
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,250
What?

969
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:51,159
Ava, he kills people,
for a living, for money.

970
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,129
Why would
someone want to kill me?

971
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:58,733
I don't know.

972
01:03:58,735 --> 01:04:01,369
But maybe if we can
figure out where he went

973
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:03,538
after he left your apartment
that night...

974
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,373
I can't, I...

975
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,042
What, you can't remember?

976
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,110
I don't know.

977
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,550
Let me protect you.

978
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:18,052
I don't know if you can.

979
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,654
I'm sorry.

980
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:49,150
Look, J.J. You're the only
person I can trust right now.

981
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:51,686
Everyone's gonna think
I killed Noelle.

982
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,790
If I go home,
they're gonna send me away.

983
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:00,395
You did the right thing coming
here.

984
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,566
It's the first smart thing
you did all day.

985
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,505
Thanks for helping me.

986
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:13,107
You know
that your parents, uh...

987
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,342
They fired me.

988
01:05:14,344 --> 01:05:17,078
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

989
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,181
Ugh, fucking hell.

990
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:21,516
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

991
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:25,019
First things first,
you need some rest.

992
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,855
I got a spot for you, come on.

993
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,094
God, what are you
doing here so late anyways?

994
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:34,862
Um, some of us work.

995
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:40,935
The couch is yours.

996
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,008
Just make yourself at home.

997
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,676
Thanks, J.J.

998
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,611
I gotta make some phone calls.

999
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:53,614
Good night.

1000
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:13,534
<i>He may present
a sacrifice of burnt offerings</i>

1001
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,870
<i>and if the new vessel
is without blemish,</i>

1002
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:17,405
<i>he will accept it...</i>

1003
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:21,809
Reflect my bear.

1004
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:26,814
<i>We have to tell her,</i>

1005
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,317
<i>she has to understand why...</i>

1006
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:50,905
The night before the exorcism...

1007
01:06:50,907 --> 01:06:52,940
That is my bear...

1008
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:54,442
It's you they want...

1009
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:57,044
It always was.

1010
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:07,555
Thanks, J.J.

1011
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:09,190
I'm here to help. What?

1012
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:12,026
What the hell
were you thinking, running away?

1013
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,428
Are you alright?

1014
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,763
Someone's trying to kill me.

1015
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,398
She's clearly delirious.

1016
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,033
I mean, we better call Zephyr

1017
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,203
and have them send
some orderlies over to help us.

1018
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,404
It might look bad

1019
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:26,040
dragging her out of here
like a mental patient.

1020
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,675
I can drive her myself.

1021
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,382
I'll make sure she gets
to Zephyr place tonight.

1022
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,582
Where are we going?

1023
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,887
What is this,
what are you doing?

1024
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,757
Roger. Hello?

1025
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,868
It's just you and me now.

1026
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,503
Uh...

1027
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:29,871
Hey, hey.

1028
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:31,606
Ugh, no.

1029
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:38,646
It was you.

1030
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:40,281
You're the guy with Noelle.

1031
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:43,484
So good.

1032
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:45,786
Oh, my god, we had sex!

1033
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,456
Yeah. It was so intense.

1034
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:52,627
Oh, my god, get off me! Hey.

1035
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:56,964
Hey. I have feelings for you.

1036
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:03,137
Ha. I do.

1037
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,205
What?

1038
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:11,512
Yeah. It was a funny story.

1039
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:14,649
We ran into each other
in that whore's minivan.

1040
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:19,253
Uh! I was a nervous wreck!

1041
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:23,691
I just hated myself, a mess.

1042
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:26,594
Then I hired Conrad
to knock you off.

1043
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:35,736
You can imagine my surprise

1044
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:39,640
when we found you alive
and Conrad dead.

1045
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:59,360
It was the demon.

1046
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:00,995
It saved you.

1047
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:04,765
It saved me too.

1048
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:07,435
Roger...

1049
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:09,937
Yeah?

1050
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:14,141
I don't feel anything for you.

1051
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,046
How can you say that...

1052
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,417
After what I did?

1053
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,494
And that's when I realized,

1054
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:44,632
it's deeper than anything
I ever felt for Jillian.

1055
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,735
What we have is truly special.

1056
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:52,707
That wasn't me.

1057
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:54,608
That was the demon

1058
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:07,188
then how do we
get the demon back?

1059
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,823
There is one way...

1060
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,126
It's in there.

1061
01:13:06,783 --> 01:13:08,349
There you go.

1062
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,862
This is it.

1063
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:25,032
Put it on.

1064
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:40,548
Put it on!

1065
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,394
You're so fucking hot.

1066
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:31,799
Why do you
want me so bad, Roger?

1067
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:34,335
Fuck yeah.

1068
01:14:34,337 --> 01:14:37,438
Same as any of those
other women of the night?

1069
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:44,378
Tell me about
the hookers, Roger.

1070
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,547
You're
so much better than they are.

1071
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,889
Oh, yeah.

1072
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:07,534
Tell me what happened to Noelle.

1073
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:13,374
Tell me, Roger, and I'll give
you everything you want.

1074
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:15,242
She didn't matter.

1075
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,278
I fucked her.

1076
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,646
I killed her.

1077
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:22,116
She didn't mean a thing.

1078
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:24,485
Take it.

1079
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:05,919
Well, you've proved me wrong.

1080
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,057
Well done.

1081
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:15,295
Thanks, Tony.

1082
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,032
What about that mark on my neck?

1083
01:17:18,034 --> 01:17:20,000
Uh, I wouldn't
worry about that now.

1084
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:23,804
It's just one of many scars.

1085
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:26,040
Will I ever know why?

1086
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,674
The possession.

1087
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:29,309
What brought it on?

1088
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:32,646
Ava, you just
defeated your demon.

1089
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,315
Be happy.

1090
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:40,754
We don't use the "d" word.

1091
01:17:58,107 --> 01:18:00,407
Maybe you should
move in with me for a bit.

1092
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:03,777
I've got room now.

1093
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:06,713
You know, Jillian,
I'm really sorry.

1094
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:10,417
I guess Roger
had everyone fooled.

1095
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,720
You were never
really fooled by him.

1096
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,589
It's my fault.

1097
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:18,892
I invited him into our lives.

1098
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:21,528
Finally,
it's not my fault for once.

1099
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,436
I'm not used to being
the one comforting you.

1100
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:04,738
You ready to pop that?

1101
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,083
I'm bill.

1102
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,651
I- I don't know
exactly why I'm here,

1103
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:19,186
I mean, it's been
a rough six weeks.

1104
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:20,521
It's been tough.

1105
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:25,692
I held up a-a 7-11
in Newark and, and here I am.

1106
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:26,927
And... And now I got a record,

1107
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,829
and I don't even remember
doin' it.

1108
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:30,297
It's weird,
it made me feel younger.

1109
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:33,100
It made me feel younger,
and I miss this little fucker.

1110
01:19:39,842 --> 01:19:42,176
Hey, Ava.

1111
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:43,777
Good job today.

1112
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,946
I'll, uh, see you tomorrow.

1113
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,782
Bye, captain. I'll lock up.

1114
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:24,952
Fucking hell.

1115
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:51,044
<i>This thing that managed
to get inside of you</i>

1116
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:53,780
<i>should be a real wake-up call.</i>

1117
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,215
<i>Mom has her own issues.</i>

1118
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:57,451
<i>They have nothing
to do with you.</i>

1119
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:58,785
<i>She just thinks they do.</i>

1120
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:04,057
<i>Trust me,
you don't wanna know any more.</i>

1121
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:05,525
<i>Just leave it alone.</i>

1122
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:11,365
<i>How can you possibly know
what this has been like for me?</i>

1123
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,000
<i>I just know.</i>

1124
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,439
<i>Who would have thought</i>

1125
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:23,210
<i>our family would be
so vulnerable to demons.</i>

1126
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,378
<i>Maybe it's genetic?</i>

1127
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,479
<i>I heard that could happen.</i>

1128
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:26,747
<i>Look what I got.</i>

1129
01:21:26,749 --> 01:21:28,448
<i>To replace the one
grandpa gave me.</i>

1130
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,751
<i>Any form of magic,
no matter what the intention,</i>

1131
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:33,387
<i>can invite evil inside.</i>

1132
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:36,056
<i>You summoned the demon,
you woke the darkness,</i>

1133
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:37,791
<i>you have the mark.</i>
