00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:09,009
(no audio)

2
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:19,149
(bright music)

3
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:29,159
(bright music)

4
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:39,169
(bright music)

5
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:45,915
(dramatic music)
(hooves clopping)

6
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:46,916
(projector clacking)

7
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,397
(whip cracks)

8
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,446
(gentle music)

9
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:06,066
(gentle music continues)

10
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,596
(gentle music continues)

11
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,207
(engine revving)

12
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:22,299
- (sighs) I told you to get
those signs out of the back,

13
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,606
clean those tools out
of the truck, did I not?

14
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,302
- Yes, sir.

15
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,742
- Everybody already knows
I work two jobs, but,

16
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,571
my Lord, they
shouldn't have to look

17
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,138
at a rolling billboard
in the parking lot.

18
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:37,749
- I'm sorry, Daddy. I forgot.

19
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:44,539
- Sister Abernathie, she's,
uh, she's at her wit's end.

20
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,632
Your behavior has been off.

21
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,288
And you better do right
in that classroom today,

22
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:56,116
or I'll ground you for another
week, you understand me?

23
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:56,942
- Yes, sir.

24
00:01:58,248 --> 00:01:59,336
- Look, I was a
preacher's kid, too.

25
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:02,078
But you got to do right, son,

26
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,647
'cause if you don't,

27
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,129
I'ma have to talk to my friend,

28
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:12,349
Gary, the Goose.

29
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,482
Oh, man, he's hungry.

30
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,831
- Daddy, no! Please, no!
- He's so hungry.

31
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:16,701
- No, please! No!
- He's hungry!

32
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,790
(both laughing)

33
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:22,142
(gentle music continues)

34
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:31,586
(gentle music continues)

35
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:36,808
- (Samuel) Daddy, who
parked in your spot?

36
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,207
- Go on in, son.

37
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,303
- And things like cussing
will get you there.

38
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:59,309
The word of God says, "Let
your conversation be holy."

39
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:03,270
The word says, "Be ye holy

40
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,228
as I am holy."

41
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:07,709
(upbeat music)

42
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:09,624
What, Samuel?

43
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:13,105
- I know you said cussing
will get you in,

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,978
but what if you, like,
just tried it once,

45
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,545
and you didn't really mean it?

46
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,199
What if Jesus came
back right then?

47
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:21,897
- Come here.

48
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:25,248
(upbeat music continues)

49
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:27,337
Come right here.

50
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:29,905
Then, boy,

51
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,950
you'd bust wide open.

52
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:32,821
(congregation applauding)

53
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,432
(bright music)

54
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,479
- Ma'am.

55
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,046
- (sighs) What, Samuel?

56
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,657
- Can I go to the bathroom?

57
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:46,400
- Hurry back.

58
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,796
- The Lord looks on the heart.

59
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,538
Now, the GCO guidebook
says no swimming,

60
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,327
no makeup, no worldly music,
no going to the picture show.

61
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,893
- That's right.
- Yes.

62
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,547
- And there's probably
a million people

63
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,594
in this organization who
follow those rules to tee.

64
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,204
- I do, Pastor.

65
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,162
- I know you do,
Zachary. I know you do.

66
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:12,556
(congregation chuckling)

67
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,905
But what about those people

68
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:19,389
that are following those
rules on the outside,

69
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,870
but they're doing something
different on the inside?

70
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:27,876
Right, someone who wouldn't
dare touch a bottle of whiskey,

71
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:33,055
and yet they walk around
drunk on their own pride.

72
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:34,839
(congregation muttering)

73
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:35,927
God looks on the heart.

74
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,627
Someone who wouldn't even think

75
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,933
about lighting up
a single cigarette,

76
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,853
but their heart is
burnt up with jealousy.

77
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:51,552
(congregation muttering)

78
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,509
See, because God,

79
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,034
he knows how to spot a fake.

80
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,649
And if we don't tell him
every single day how we fail,

81
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,693
and we need his help,

82
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,132
then our own hearts
will go astray.

83
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,830
- Oh yes.
- Amen.

84
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:12,137
- 'Cause where religion
fails and where people fail,

85
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,706
God will never, and
I mean never fail.

86
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,361
Hallelujah.

87
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:19,231
- Amen!

grandma this Saturday.

The King, preacher boy.

112

out in the back.

121
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:03,161
- (Barry) Come on.
Let's go hustle.

122
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:04,336

(Joe clears throat)

125
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:18,829
- Just driving by?

126
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:19,787
- Joe.

127
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,227
That's quite a little show
you put on there this morning.

128
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,881
- It's our church
state overseer.

129
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:28,360
He tells everybody what to do.

130
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:30,580
- (Joe) What do you need?

131
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,365
- God's Church Organization
is growing by the hour.

132
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,019
Lord's returning any day.

133
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:37,239
We just need to make sure
that all of our pastors

134
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,981
are preaching what they
ought to be preaching.

135
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:42,157
- I haven't gotten
any complaints.

136
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:43,680
- Mm.

137
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:44,594
I have.

138
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:48,685
Brother Wilburn let his
whole family go swimming.

139
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,993
Mixed bathing encourages lust.

140
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:57,041
Well, God's Church,
we show the way.

141
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:58,173
- We can't just throw
a rule book at 'em

142
00:07:58,347 --> 00:07:59,522
and tell 'em to change.

143
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:02,133
See,

144
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:03,831
you and I, um, we're different.

145
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,138
- Like Cain and Abel.

146
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:08,879
- You're a professional.

147
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:13,318
I'm just a boy that God
found out in a cotton field.

148
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,450
When I was 14,

149
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,280
your daddy asked me to
come and tell my story.

150
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:19,411
- Yeah.

151
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:20,848
Small town nothing.

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,374
- Maybe, but I got ambition.

153
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:28,203
Raise my son. Lead my people.

154
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:29,160
- Your people?

155
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,511
They're my people.

156
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:34,818
My daddy ain't gonna live
forever. Remember that.

157
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:37,647
- None of us do.

158
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,520
(brooding music)

159
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:46,743
- We'll see who's
smiling in the end.

160
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,879
(engine starting)

161
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:56,448
(brooding music continues)

162
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:57,711
- Watch out for that bush!

163
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,974
(brakes screech)

164
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:00,888
You found it.

165
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,588
(gentle music)

166
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:08,330
- Someday I'll
start my own church

167
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,202
and be a preacher like my daddy.

168
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,556
(cutlery clacking)

169
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:23,345
- Good Lord, ain't you
gonna ask about the present

170
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,216
sitting right here on the table?

171
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:25,956
- It's a present?

172
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:27,654
For me?

173
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,004
- Ain't my birthday.

174
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:34,530
(paper rustling)

175
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,712
(clock ticking)

176
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,584
It's time.

177
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:53,810
- Daddy, I've been
thinking a lot.

178
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,770
I think I know why Momma died

179
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:57,640
with my little
brother in her belly.

180
00:09:57,814 --> 00:09:58,598
- Hey.

181
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,992
Remember, we don't question
Lord in those matters.

182
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:03,951
You know that.

183
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:08,390
- Daddy, I cussed a few times.

184
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:09,304
On purpose.

185
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:10,131
- Samuel, stop.

186
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:12,786
- It's my fault.

187
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,659
- Samuel.

188
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,183
Samuel, look at me.

189
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,273
Now, what you said right
there, that's not true.

190
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:25,363
Your mother had
complications with the baby.

191
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,629
- But Sister Abernathie
said I was going to

192
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:31,152
because I cussed.

193
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,675
- Well, you know what?

194
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:33,937
I don't think Sister
Abernathie knows

195
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,547
what she's
talking about.

196
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,985
Oh! I just said it too, huh?

197
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,552
(bright music)

198
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,816
I'm gonna have to give
her a little talking to.

199
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,908
Hey, you remember what we
used to say about God's love?

200
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:50,432
Think about the
deepest, highest,

201
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:54,044
strongest, and widest
thing there could ever be.

202
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:56,046
That's God's love for
you and me. Yes, sir.

203
00:10:57,352 --> 00:11:00,529
(bright music continues)

204
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,881
I want you to head over to
that closet. Open it up.

205
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:08,276
Before your food gets cold.

206
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,461
(gentle music)

207
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:28,949
(gentle music continues)

208
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:30,690
I traded your mother's
mandolin for it.

209
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:33,475
It's yours, son.

210
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,001
(gentle music continues)

211
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:40,221
- I thought the GCO said
electric instruments

212
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:41,222
are of the devil?

213
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:46,923
- Well, rock and roll don't
sound too good on an acoustic.

214
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,972
See? Your dad pays attention.

215
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:55,366
(bright music)

216
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,150
You got a gift, son.

217
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,414
It's in your blood.

218
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,938

219
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,598

You all know Brother Joe
Allen over at GCO Sayre.

00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:09,109
He's a good man.

252

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,374

here today, Samuel.

254
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,855
He's going to come up
and sing a song for us.

255
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:18,553
Give the Lord a
praise in welcome.

260
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:37,964
I thought you said you were
gonna marry Jody Barnes?

261
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:43,012
- Well, either him or Samuel.

262
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:44,535

- Thank you.

281
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,013
- All right, now
let us remember,

282
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,580
we do not clap for the man.

283
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:18,281
We only clap for the Lord. Amen.

284
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:19,195
Amen.

285
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,372
All right, let's go
ahead and get the rest

286
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:25,114
of the youth leaders from
the State of Alabama up here.

287
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:26,681
All right.

288
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:28,770
Now let's stand
and clap for God!

289
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:29,597
(audience cheering)
Come on!

290
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:32,208
(upbeat music)

291
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,913
(upbeat music continues)

292
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:42,871
- Go!

293
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,791
- Hey, rock and roll.

294
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,969
You need to come to my
party this Saturday.

295
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,145
- You're Dr. Blackburn's
daughter, are you?

296
00:16:58,713 --> 00:16:59,844
Rock and roll.

297
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:00,758
Wow.

298
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,805
That was a, that's
a gospel song.

299
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:06,242
- I'm Angie, and
it's called a joke.

300
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,679
It's a 4th of July
party. Just come.

301
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:10,072
Your song was groovy.

302
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,335
- Thank you.
- This Saturday at 12:00.

303
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,424
Barbecue and everything.

304
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,862
But no swimming trunks.
Swimming's of the devil.

305
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:22,693
- (Samuel) It's
nice to meet you.

306
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:28,003
- (Julie) Hi, Samuel

307
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,180
- Julie.

308
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:32,268
(Julie chuckles)

309
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:33,965
Haven't seen you in a while.

310
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,403
My momma used to listen
to the record y'all made

311
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:39,058
with your daddy
when you were kids.

312
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:39,928
- Oh.

313
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,060
Well, thank you.

314
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,585
- She said that y'all
are getting married.

315
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,197
- Ah. You must be
making things up.

316
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,721
- Actually, I, (sighs)
I did say that.

317
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:53,202
- That's cool, I just, I
didn't give you a ring yet.

318
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:57,424
- Uh, I...

319
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:58,773
Sorry, I gotta, I gotta go.

320
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,514
We gotta go. Come on, Ray.

321
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,255
- Um, whoa, hey, uh, Angie,

322
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,257
Angie Blackburn's having
a party this Saturday.

323
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:05,780
- Well, I- I don't think
my daddy would let me go.

324
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:08,217
He doesn't really let us, um-

325
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,436
- What?

326
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,089
Have fun?

327
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,743
Please?

328
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,834
Look, it's at noon, and I just
wanna keep talking to you,

329
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:18,532
so I'll go if you're going.

330
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,540
- He's waiting, but I'll try.

331
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,458
Oh, wait, um...

332
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,636
Here.

333
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,639
This used to be mine, but
I want you to have it.

334
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,249
(gentle music)

335
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,077
You can hold onto it till
you give me that ring.

336
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,301
(gentle music continues)

337
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,440
(gentle music continues)

338
00:18:57,614 --> 00:19:00,139
(ominous music)

339
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:04,273
(Julie giggles)

340
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,497
(slap thwacks)
(Julie gasps)

341
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,373
(brooding music)

342
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:26,687
(brooding music continues)

343
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:29,559
- Excuse me.

344
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:30,517
Samuel.

345
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,434
What are you doing here?

346
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:36,610
- Oh, Angie Blackburn
invited me to the party.

347
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:39,700
- You realize there's no place

348
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,180
for music like
that in the church?

349
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,968
- Uh, what- what do you mean?

350
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:48,622
- Rock and roll.

351
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,190
It's an infection.

352
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,062
I've seen it.

353
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:59,589
First it's music and
concerts, then it's parties,

354
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:01,722
next it's sex,

355
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,770
then it's full-blown
devil worship.

356
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:10,426
(brooding music continues)

357
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:12,254
- Um...

358
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:16,215
Wow, um, no disrespect,
sir, I just, um,

359
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:19,827
I don't really see
the connection of the-

360
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:20,915

The City of Weems

don't really like people
like you around here.

546
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:22,821
- (Samuel) Can I make a
call? I need to call my dad.

547
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:25,824
- You wanna call your daddy?

548
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:27,913
Well, I'll tell you, son.

549
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:31,830
Your daddy's not gonna
help you tonight.

00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,133

(somber music continues)

575
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:23,115
- In the case of the State of
Alabama versus Samuel Allen,

576
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:28,033
the deadly crash on
State Route 78 in Weems

577
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:31,601
has been determined to be the
fault of James Lowry Bell.

578
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,172
Now, as to the charges
of possession of drugs,

579
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,350
I declare

580
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:44,963
that due to the

581
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:47,922
mishandling of evidence

582
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:52,448
and the degradation of
evidence caused by the fire,

583
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:54,668
these charges will be dismissed.

584
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:58,063
(audience murmuring)

585
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,803
- Thank you, sir.

586
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,328
- These charges have been
dropped under one condition,

587
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:04,547
community service.

588
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:08,334
Public speaking in schools
on the dangers of drugs

589
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:11,598
with the Alabama State Anti-Drug
Program, you understand?

590
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,079
I can't hear you.

591
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:15,732
- Yes, sir.

592
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:16,995
- Don't let me catch you
in my courtroom again.

593
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:25,177
(engine rumbling)

594
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:28,441
- I just don't understand
why the judge let me go.

595
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:30,182
I don't think you
need worry about that.

596
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:34,012
- Hey, why was T.L.
Whittmore in the courtroom?

597
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:39,930
- Well, guess he's got as much
right as anyone to be there.

598
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:41,323
- He has a right to go to.

599
00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:42,455
- My God, Samuel.

600
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:45,588
We can't hold hatred
in our hearts.

601
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:50,898
- Sorry, Dad.

602
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:55,207
- I'm thinking
about stepping down.

603
00:33:56,556 --> 00:33:57,035
The church.

604
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:01,430
- Because of me?

605
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:02,388
- I just...

606
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:07,045
I wanna help you become the
man you were meant to be.

607
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:10,178
The paper hanging
business, it's good.

608
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:13,225
It's right.

609
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,054
- Church is your life.

610
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,364
- Never surrender the dream.

611
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:25,846
You hear me?

612
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:34,942
- I hear you.

613
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:46,562
Stop the car.

614
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:47,476
- What?

615
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:50,088
- Dad, pull over.

616
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:52,960
- All right.

617
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,745
(engine revving)

618
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:05,103
(handbrake ratchets)

619
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:12,327
(gentle music)

620
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:22,337
(gentle music continues)

621
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:29,388
- You ever felt like you
know the man you wanna be,

622
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:31,129
but you're just
not strong enough?

623
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:33,261
- Every day?

624
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:40,442
- Truth is, you're
my only example of
someone that means it.

625
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:46,796
And the world is listening
for people that mean it.

626
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:53,542
Baptize me.

627
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:57,155
- Here?

628
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,159
- Ah, I can't wait.

629
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:06,512
(gentle music continues)

630
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,906
- I'll baptize you.

631
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:17,305
(geese honking)
(gentle music)

632
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,395

633
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:29,578

634
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:37,934
(bright music)

635
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:40,502
- Preacher boy.

636
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:47,857
(Samuel laughs)

637
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:50,512
(Barry laughs)

638
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:52,949
- (Samuel) Hey, man.

639
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:57,737
- Ah, man.

640
00:36:57,911 --> 00:36:58,825
- (laughs) I missed you.

641
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:00,261
- I missed you too, brother.

642
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:01,349
It's been six months.

643
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:06,006
It still hurts.

644
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:09,227
I can barely play, but

645
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:12,708
the ladies love it.

646
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:14,319
(both chuckling)

647
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:15,233
But I just say

648
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:19,759
I was saving puppy dogs
from a burning building.

649
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,978
(both chuckling)

650
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:24,546
The shrink say I'm depressed.

651
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:28,898
Like some kinda,
some kinda darkness.

652
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:34,252
- Brother, I'm sorry.

653
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,037
You're my best friend.

654
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,259
All right, I'm gonna,

655
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,478
I'll make sure that you stay
strong, 'cause I need you.

656
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:47,482
I got baptized.

657
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:50,790
(Barry laughs)

658
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:52,574
I'm trying to,

659
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,491
just trying to start
over, you know.

660
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:00,321
I'm speaking at

661
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:04,020
Gate City GCO tonight.

662
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:06,153
First time in church since...

663
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:08,851
- Hmm.

664
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:12,942
- Please, please come with me.

665
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,205
- Nah, man.

666
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,990
I don't think they
allow my good friend

667
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:19,601
Jack Daniels in church. (laughs)

668
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:21,124
- Who cares what they think?

669
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,865
The Lord loves you
just like you are.

670
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:28,828
- Preacher boy
becomes preacher man.

671
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:31,004
(Samuel laughs)

672
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,311
(laughs) You trying
to convert me?

673
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,408
- And when Angie died, you
introduced me to the band.

674
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:49,196
I didn't know who I was, but

675
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:53,896
you made me a part
of your world,

676
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,421
so I'm gonna make
you part of my world.

677
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:57,770
- I'll come for
the church girls.

678
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,774
Hey, you know, long
skirts, no makeup,

679
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,125

American settlers.

called me today.

He's our state over overseer.

711
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,123
- Uh, yeah, I know who he is.

712
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:31,298
- Well, you may know who he is,

713
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:32,430
but you don't know what he said.

714
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:34,127
He told me to watch out for you.

715
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:35,998
You need to watch your
content in this place.

716
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:38,305
There's a lotta sinful-looking
people in this place.

717
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:40,786
- Uh, isn't, isn't
that the point?

718
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:46,618
- It's the point, but we don't
want 'em staying that way.

719
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:49,098
- Don't worry. I'll be careful.

720
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:51,231
- Okay, you be careful.

721
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:52,754
Look at the size of this crowd.

722
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:53,712
There ain't been this
many people in this room

723
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:55,888
since Easter '62.

724
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:58,499
I'm telling you, man, this
place is full. It's wonderful.

725
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,198
♪ Chugging on to Gloryland ♪

726
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:03,896
- (Samuel) Yes, she is.

727
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:12,557
♪ If you're a prisoner ♪

728
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:14,559
♪ Or a preacher man ♪

729
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,474
- My dad always told me that

730
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:18,998
nothing can distance
you from God's love.

731
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:19,694
- (Audience) Mm.

732
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:22,697
- And boy, I tried.

733
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,617
Can I just speak from the heart?

734
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,358
You know, basically,
he says that

735
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:35,623
nothing can separate you
from the love of God.

736
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:37,625
- Yeah.
- Praise the Lord.

737
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:38,670
- No sin.

738
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:40,715
No failure.

739
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:42,891
Nothing.

740
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:46,852
Nothing can separate
you from that love.

741
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:53,162
(audience applauding)

742
00:41:57,776 --> 00:41:59,473
- And he, um,

743
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:04,173
well, he just moved us from
place to place about every year.

744
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:07,699
Well, I woulda been to
like 13 different schools

745
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:09,918
before I graduated two
years ago, and it's...

746
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:13,748
- It must've been hard for you.

747
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,750
- Yeah.

748
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,495
I mean, the hardest
part was just,

749
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,108
uh, never knowing which Daddy

750
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:28,067
was gonna walk through
the door at night,

751
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:30,330
the one that would, um,

752
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,029
show up drunk and beat us,

753
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:35,335
or the one he was

754
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,774
always saying how sorry he was?

755
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:41,646
- I'll never imagine
going through all that.

756
00:42:43,256 --> 00:42:44,562
Y'all seemed so happy.

757
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:51,090
- Well, Ray and I
were always happy.

758
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:52,657
(chuckles) We, um,

759
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,311
nah, no, we had
this, uh, this place.

760
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,488
We call it the Angels Trail.

761
00:42:58,663 --> 00:42:59,751
Yeah, and, um,

762
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,233
we would go there to
pray when it got bad.

763
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:08,107
And church was all we had, so.

764
00:43:10,457 --> 00:43:12,459
And I, (chuckles)

765
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:17,029
I've, I've never told
anyone else all this before.

766
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,774
- You're beautiful.

767
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:25,733
Inside and out.

768
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,650
- Oh.

769
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:31,826
Thank you.

770
00:43:34,437 --> 00:43:36,091
Uh...

771
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:38,267
I've never met someone like you.

772
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:47,799
(Samuel chuckles)

773
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:50,671
- You drank two milkshakes.

774
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:53,152
- Ah! You kept count?

775
00:43:53,326 --> 00:43:55,633
- I was just, I was nervous you
were gonna try and get mine.

776
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:57,635
So how am I gonna pay
for all these milkshakes?

777
00:43:59,245 --> 00:44:00,594
- Well, I think if
you pay for them,

778
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:02,248
then that would
make this a date.

779
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:04,424
- Is that a promise?

780
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:06,861
- (giggles) I think so.

781
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:09,864
- Ah, excuse me.

782
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:11,126
Can I get the,

783
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,653
the check?
(Julie laughs)

784
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:17,655
I'll keep that sticker
on my guitar 'cause

785
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:20,440
it reminded me of
the life I knew

786
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:22,050
I was supposed to be living.

787
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,706
I thought about you,

788
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,447
and I was certain
I lost the chance

789
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:28,970
to love someone
as special as you.

790
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,062
Julie, I wanna build
a life with you.

791
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:36,108
And we,

792
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:40,025
we could build a
different kinda church,

793
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,288
from scratch, our own.

794
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:43,419
Not about a bunch of

795
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:45,857
manmade rules.

796
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,688
One that reaches people
as lost as I was,

797
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:54,039
built on grace.

798
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:55,344
- That's a beautiful dream.

799
00:44:57,346 --> 00:44:58,260
But, um,

800
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:04,310
I mean, did I, did I miss a
question in there somewhere?

801
00:45:06,225 --> 00:45:07,443
- (Samuel) Yeah, maybe.

802
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:10,272
(both giggling)
(gentle music)

803
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:11,665
The last few years I,

804
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:16,365
(Samuel sighs)

805
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:18,933
I haven't been a good man, but

806
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:22,850
you make me wanna be.

807
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,986
And maybe when we
build that church,

808
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,901
you'd like to be by my side.

809
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:34,732
As my wife.

810
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:39,388
(gentle music continues)

811
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,090
(somber music)

812
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:47,440
- Well, my daddy, he...

813
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:49,355
- (Samuel) What about him?

814
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:53,707
(somber music continues)

815
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:55,535
- Sam, he won't let me
just start a life with you.

816
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:56,492
I mean,

817
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:58,756
God, he'd kill me.

818
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:02,411
He said that I can't just leave.

819
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:06,633
- He ain't gonna kill anybody.

820
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:12,160
Julie, look at me.

821
00:46:15,076 --> 00:46:16,774
Your best days are
in front of you.

822
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:20,125
And that man will
never touch you again.

823
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:27,132
- He's violent, Samuel, and
you're, you're so sweet,

824
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:28,437
but you just, you
don't know him.

825
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:29,656
- I know myself.

826
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,832
He'd have to kill me.

827
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:35,923
- You're serious?

828
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:38,752
- Do I look like I'm not?

829
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:49,067
- Well, the answer is yes.

830
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,678
(gentle music)

831
00:46:55,377 --> 00:46:57,336
(bright music)

832
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:02,210
- (Samuel) I guess I
owe you a ring, then.

833
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:04,778
- You know, I always knew
we'd get married someday.

834
00:47:06,736 --> 00:47:09,478
- I thought you were
gonna marry Jody Barnes.

835
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:10,915
- Well, yes. Him or you.

836
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:14,048
(both laughing)

837
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:17,486
(bright music continues)

838
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,580
(congregation applauding)

839
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:26,844
- Give the Lord a praise.

840
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:34,199
It's good to be here

841
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:35,983
in God's Church Sayre.

842
00:47:36,157 --> 00:47:37,985
- (Congregation) Amen.

843
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:39,944
- Brother Joe

844
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:44,078
has preached many fine
messages from this pulpit.

845
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:49,867
And I am sad that he
has chosen to retire.

846
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:56,047
But, uh, I do believe that
Brother Malachi from Louisiana

847
00:47:56,743 --> 00:47:58,397
has done a fine job

848
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,138
as a interim

849
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:01,704
pastor,

850
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,882
and I'm sure that he
will do a fine job

851
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:07,232
as a permanent pastor.

852
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:08,668
- All Right.
- Amen.

853
00:48:10,235 --> 00:48:13,629
- But not ever pastor is
like Brother Joe Allen.

854
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:17,329
He has remained faithful.

855
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:21,463
Now, I understand
that he doesn't

856
00:48:21,637 --> 00:48:23,465
want to come up here today.

857
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:25,380
I understand that.

858
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:27,774
But his son Samuel is here.

859
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:32,735
And boy, have I been
hearing some things

860
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,347
about this young man

861
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:36,870
and the call

862
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,351
that's on his life.

863
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:42,049
Samuel,

864
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:48,142
would you come up here and share
a little bit with us today?

865
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,058
- All right, preacher man.

866
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:58,109
(congregation applauding)

867
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,597
- If I can't hear my favorite
pastor, I wanna hear his son.

868
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:10,164
- (Congregation) Yeah.

869
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:14,081
- Thank you.
(congregation applauding)

870
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:15,213
Thanks.

871
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:17,955
A little over a year ago, um,

872
00:49:19,304 --> 00:49:22,089
I was in a motel room in
Charlotte after a show.

873
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:24,787
I was

874
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:25,963
high on cocaine.

875
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:29,183
I was

876
00:49:30,402 --> 00:49:31,969
with a woman I had just met.

877
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:37,452
$1,000 on the dresser.
Just cut my first record.

878
00:49:37,626 --> 00:49:38,976
But I was

879
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,934
dying inside.

880
00:49:42,457 --> 00:49:43,937
No, no, no, I know we don't,

881
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:45,417
we don't talk about this
kinda stuff in church.

882
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:48,115
But I don't know why.

883
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:55,209
I knew my life was broken. I
just didn't know how to fix it.

884
00:49:57,255 --> 00:49:58,082
So I tried everything.

885
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:03,652
The prodigal son.

886
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:08,440
Now, prodigal doesn't
mean wild and crazy.

887
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:12,313
It means wasteful.

888
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:15,012
- (Congregation) That's
right. That's right.

889
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:18,450
- But that was me, I was,
I was on this far-off land

890
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,411
just wasting every good
thing that God gave me.

891
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:28,590
I just need to remember that I
got a real dad that loves me.

892
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:30,549
- Yes.
- Amen.

893
00:50:32,986 --> 00:50:33,769
- But I'm,

894
00:50:35,336 --> 00:50:36,598
I'm blessed because

895
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:40,820
I have a Heavenly Father
that loves me even more.

896
00:50:40,994 --> 00:50:44,345
- Amen.
(congregation applauding)

897
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:50,047
- That, that is still
hard for me to comprehend.

898
00:50:50,221 --> 00:50:54,225
- Preach it. Preach it.
(congregation applauding)

899
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:59,839
- Don't waste the love
that God has given you.

900
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:02,711
Since he forgave me,

901
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:07,673
I'm positive that
he can forgive you.

902
00:51:07,847 --> 00:51:11,155
(congregation applauding)

903
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:17,596
Just surrender to his love.

(Barry panting)

926
00:52:52,604 --> 00:52:53,518
- Have a seat.

927
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:01,090
- Daddy, these
seats for children.

928
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:02,048
- Sit down, son.

929
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:10,622
Now, I understand that what
happened up there today

930
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:12,972
is not what we expected.

931
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:16,541
And Brother Malachi,
I wanna thank you

932
00:53:16,715 --> 00:53:19,239
for your willingness to
relocate from Shreveport.

933
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:22,373
But I have made a decision.

934
00:53:23,678 --> 00:53:27,639
Samuel will be the new
pastor of this church.

935
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:29,206
- Dad, come on.

936
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,990
- Now, I know he's
a little young.

937
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:34,907
- 1 Timothy says an elder
should not be a recent convert.

938
00:53:35,081 --> 00:53:36,343
- And it says in
the next chapter,

939
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:39,346
"Let no man despise thy youth."

940
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,000
(T.L. scoffs)

941
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:43,089
Brother Malachi has a church.

942
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:44,612
Now, I know he's your friend,

943
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:47,093
but he'll be fine.

944
00:53:49,182 --> 00:53:51,358
- Daddy, the boy's
got the devil in him.

945
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:53,665
Always has, always will.

946
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,538
- That young man has got
something on his life.

947
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:02,500
Now, what happened
up there, shoot,

948
00:54:02,674 --> 00:54:04,763
I almost went up there
and got saved myself.

949
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:07,679
It's a little edgy.

950
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:13,032
We might need a little edgy

951
00:54:13,206 --> 00:54:16,253
where we are in this
world right now.

952
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:22,041
How do you feel
about this, Samuel?

953
00:54:24,696 --> 00:54:26,306
- If you believe
in me, I'll do it.

954
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:32,921
- This is the GCO Handbook.

955
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:36,011
Memorize it. Learn the rules.

956
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:38,057
Without rules, there's no order,

957
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:41,843
and without order,
there is chaos.

958
00:54:42,017 --> 00:54:42,931
Stick to the rules.

959
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:47,849
- Yes, sir.
(gentle music)

960
00:54:48,023 --> 00:54:50,591
- Well, I don't think
anybody has left yet.

961
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:54,116
Everybody's still upstairs,
so let's go up and, um,

962
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,989
appoint the new pastor.

you know, thank you
for believing in me.

thank me. I always have.

- Charlene.

1026
01:00:12,043 --> 01:00:12,783
I can't.

- I, uh...

1029
01:00:20,573 --> 01:00:22,357
I- I shouldn't have
called you over here.

1030

- Well.

1037
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,689

1040
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:59,220

trying. I'm trying.

(camera shutter clicks)

1049
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:55,276
Why are you following
me and taking pictures?

1050
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:56,234
What you trying to do, huh?

1051
01:01:56,408 --> 01:01:57,888
- I got you now.

1052
01:01:58,062 --> 01:02:00,281
Pictures of that
going up to your room, huh?

1053
01:02:03,632 --> 01:02:05,809
(groans) Oh, and now the liquor.

1054
01:02:07,288 --> 01:02:10,161
Now a Black burnout assaulting
an upstanding citizen.

1055
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:14,687
Samuel's going down.
You too, Barry.

1056
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:18,386
- Get your stuff and get
outta here, you redneck.

1057
01:02:20,345 --> 01:02:21,041
Get outta here!

- Hello?

1062
01:02:53,595 --> 01:02:54,422
- It's me, brother.

1063
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:57,425
- Barry.

1064
01:02:58,426 --> 01:02:59,210
Barry, what is it?

1065
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:05,651
Oh, you know. Same old story.

1066
01:03:08,436 --> 01:03:10,134
- Um, hey, hold on.

1067
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:12,658
Where are you? Where are you at?

1068
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,399
- That's a deep question.

1069
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:21,449
At the bottom of a well.

1070
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:27,804
(sobs) I can see the light, but

1071
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:31,677
I just can't reach it.

1072
01:03:33,461 --> 01:03:34,767
It's too far away

1073
01:03:40,077 --> 01:03:43,123
T.L. Whittmore had
a goon following me,

1074
01:03:43,297 --> 01:03:44,124
taking pictures of me,

1075
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:48,476
drinking, and with a prostitute.

1076
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:51,044
But I ain't go through with it.

1077
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:53,786
I'm different now.

1078
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,269
But, uh,

1079
01:03:58,443 --> 01:04:00,488
I messed it up for you.

01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:06,059
They said they're
gonna take your church.

1082
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:07,844
- That doesn't matter
right now, Barry.

1083
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:12,065
- When I get sad, I drink.

1084
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:15,634
(ominous music continues)

1085
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:17,810
I can't fix it, brother.

1086
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,511
I love you, brother.

1087
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:29,213
- I love you too,
Barry. God loves you.

1088
01:04:29,387 --> 01:04:29,866
Um...

1089
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:34,044
(ominous music continues)

1090
01:04:34,218 --> 01:04:35,872
Look, um, we're just
gonna get through this.

1091
01:04:36,046 --> 01:04:37,612
I need you to tell me
where you are, Barry.

1092
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:40,006
You have to tell me, please.

1093
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,747
- I'm sorry. I let you down.

1094
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:44,489
- You didn't let me down, Barry.

1095
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:46,970
Barry.

1096
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:49,929
Barry?

1097
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:53,367
(gun cocking)

1098
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:54,325
Barry?

1099
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:01,419
(gunshot bangs)

1100
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:03,595
(sirens wailing)

1101
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:06,337
(brooding music)

1102
01:05:10,602 --> 01:05:13,039
(sirens wailing)

1103
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:23,920
(brooding music continues)

1104
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,924
(somber music)

1105
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:32,798
(thunder rumbling)

1106
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:42,590
(somber music continues)

1107
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:52,513
(somber music continues)

1108
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,083
- (Samuel) Mr. Whittmore.

1109
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:58,824
I thought that might be
you when I saw that car.

1110
01:05:58,998 --> 01:05:59,999
- (T.L.) Is that right?

1111
01:06:00,173 --> 01:06:01,740
- Hey, you and those Cadillacs.

1112
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,310
- Is there some
place we can talk?

1113
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:13,970
We got a problem.

1114
01:06:18,496 --> 01:06:21,716
(thunder rumbling)

1115
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:22,979
I've been watching you

1116
01:06:24,806 --> 01:06:28,419
over the years since your
so-called conversion.

1117
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:30,682
- So-called?

1118
01:06:30,856 --> 01:06:31,639
- Hmm.

1119
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:36,905
There ain't a thing sacred about
the way you do church, son.

1120
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,385
(thunder rumbling)

1121
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,257
Worldly music.

1122
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:41,388
Weirdos.

1123
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,000
It seems like you think,

1124
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:45,914
just 'cause you run
three services a Sunday,

1125
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:49,179
that somehow you're justified.

1126
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:51,137
- Everyone deserves
a second chance.

1127
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:52,660
- Shame Barry didn't get one.

1128
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:56,925
Drunk usher one day,
kills himself the next.

1129
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,449
- You don't get to bring him up.

1130
01:06:58,623 --> 01:07:00,364
You don't know
anything about Barry.

1131
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:02,670
- I know you refuse to
preach sanctification.

1132
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:05,412
Hmm?

1133
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:07,545
(T.L. sniggers)

1134
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:10,374
Your daddy was a grace
man. Look at him now.

1135
01:07:14,465 --> 01:07:16,989
- You want me to preach
that people lose the ability

1136
01:07:17,163 --> 01:07:19,035
to make a mistake after
they come to the Lord?

1137
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:20,601
- It's mighty close
to the line, son.

1138
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:22,168
- Matter of fact,
it's over the lie.

1139
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:24,170
- Oh, you made up the line.

1140
01:07:24,344 --> 01:07:25,737
You're gonna try and tell me
that, in 30 years of ministry,

1141
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:26,607
you've never made one mistake?

1142
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:27,695
- Not a one!

1143
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:32,091
Holiness.

1144
01:07:33,223 --> 01:07:33,919
Look it up.

1145
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:38,054
- That's the problem.

1146
01:07:42,232 --> 01:07:42,928
I have.

1147
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:46,540
- A sinner like you
wouldn't understand.

1148
01:07:46,714 --> 01:07:49,282
(thunder rumbling)

1149
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:55,375
- "I was shown mercy so that
in me, the worst of sinners,

1150
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:58,248
Christ Jesus might display
his immense patience."

1151
01:07:58,422 --> 01:08:01,338
- "And these shall go away
into everlasting punishment,

1152
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:04,645
but the righteous
into life eternal."

1153
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:07,431
- "He has not punished us as
we deserve for all our sins,

1154
01:08:07,605 --> 01:08:09,650
for his mercy toward those
who fear and honor him

1155
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:11,609
is as great as the height of
the heavens above the earth."

1156
01:08:11,783 --> 01:08:13,306
- "They that have done evil

1157
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,092
will come upon the
resurrection of damnation,

1158
01:08:17,397 --> 01:08:19,312
for the wages of sin is death."

1159
01:08:21,314 --> 01:08:22,228
- It's sad.

1160
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,058
You've clearly memorized it, but

1161
01:08:28,365 --> 01:08:30,149
you, you don't understand it.

1162
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:36,982
- You wanna hit me, boy?

1163
01:08:39,593 --> 01:08:41,421
Prove what I already
know about you.

1164
01:08:41,595 --> 01:08:44,120
(thunder rumbling)

1165
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:49,255
You're out!

1166
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:54,347
I believe the Pope calls
it excommunicated. Hmm.

1167
01:08:57,611 --> 01:08:59,787
No one from the GCO will
ever speak to you again.

1168
01:09:03,095 --> 01:09:06,054
Brother Malachi will
move into the parsonage

1169
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:08,274
and take over this
Saturday, all right?

1170
01:09:10,407 --> 01:09:11,582
You're finished.

1171
01:09:11,756 --> 01:09:14,367
(brooding music)

1172
01:09:15,803 --> 01:09:18,676
(thunder rumbling)

1173
01:09:22,593 --> 01:09:23,681
- Barry's death is on you.

1174
01:09:27,815 --> 01:09:28,947
- I wasn't his pastor.

1175
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,299
You were.

1176
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:37,477
(brooding music continues)

1177
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:40,176
(door slams)

1178
01:09:47,705 --> 01:09:49,097
- Daddy will just
be a minute, okay?

1179
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:50,490
He's saying goodbye to Poppa.

1180
01:09:50,664 --> 01:09:51,796
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1181
01:09:53,276 --> 01:09:55,191
- Hey, don't let
'em make you bitter.

1182
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:59,499
(melancholy music)

1183
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:00,413
- Yeah.

1184
01:10:01,936 --> 01:10:02,937
- You can only love
the Lord as much

1185
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:04,374
as the person you love least.

1186
01:10:06,506 --> 01:10:08,508
- Dad, they took our legacy.

1187
01:10:08,682 --> 01:10:09,205
- Your legacy?

1188
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:12,730
Your legacy's right here.

1189
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:18,214
It's right out
there in that car.

1190
01:10:18,388 --> 01:10:19,780
It's anywhere God leads you,

1191
01:10:19,954 --> 01:10:21,565
as long as you keep
your heart right.

1192
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:23,828
- We're, uh,

1193
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:28,311
we're gonna go to Florida.

1194
01:10:28,485 --> 01:10:30,748
We like it down there.
Disney World and everything.

1195
01:10:30,922 --> 01:10:33,316
- Yeah. That'll be good.

1196
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:35,927
- So we'll just start over.

1197
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:39,670
(melancholy music continues)

1198
01:10:42,499 --> 01:10:43,369
- Here's $5,000.

1199
01:10:43,543 --> 01:10:45,241
- Dad.
- Nope. Take it.

1200
01:10:45,415 --> 01:10:46,807
- Dad.

1201
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:47,634
It's just been waiting
on a rainy day.

1202
01:10:47,808 --> 01:10:48,461
It's yours.

1203
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:53,684
- Dad.

1204
01:10:54,902 --> 01:10:55,338
Thank you.

1205
01:10:56,904 --> 01:10:57,818
Come with us.

1206
01:10:57,992 --> 01:11:00,168
- Oh, I can't come with you.

1207
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:01,126
I belong here.

1208
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:04,695
Your mom and I built this place.

1209
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,133
It's your time.

1210
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:10,309
- I love you.

1211
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,486
- I love you too.

1212
01:11:15,358 --> 01:11:19,057
(melancholy music continues)

1213
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:26,804
(upbeat music)

1214
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,679
♪ It's a sort of magic from
the way that you love me ♪

1215
01:11:32,853 --> 01:11:36,814
♪ It's a sort of magic, hold
you steady down, steady down ♪

1221
01:11:58,618 --> 01:12:00,272
- Ah.

1222
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:02,666
Ladies and gentlemen, we're
gonna take a 15-minute break,

1223
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,842
and we'll be right back to play
some more of your requests.

1224
01:12:05,016 --> 01:12:07,323
(upbeat music)

1225
01:12:12,066 --> 01:12:14,765
- (Waitron) One water and
one cabernet. (laughs)

1226
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:16,462
- (Julie) Thanks.

1227
01:12:16,636 --> 01:12:17,811
- (Waitron) Can I get
you anything else?

1228
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:19,465
- No, thank you.

1229
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:21,380
- (Waitron) All right.

1230
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:27,343
(upbeat music continues)

1231
01:12:31,564 --> 01:12:32,565
- So what was that about?

1232
01:12:34,872 --> 01:12:37,483
- Dom Rivera there
just offered us a job.

1233
01:12:37,657 --> 01:12:38,397
- What?

1234
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:40,486
Who's Dom Rivera?

1235
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,227
Oh, he's a businessman.

1236
01:12:42,401 --> 01:12:43,837
He wants to become the main
act at his new nightclub,

1237
01:12:44,011 --> 01:12:47,232
but, ah, he wants a
one-year contract.

1238
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:52,280
- (chuckles) Oh, that's
good news, right?

1239
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:53,891
- You want me to take the job?

1240
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:02,247
I mean, I- I- I- I- I
thought this was temporary.

1241
01:13:02,421 --> 01:13:03,901
W- we have to start the church

1242
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:05,293
to prove to all the T.L.
Whittmores of the world

1243
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:06,904
that our way works, too.

1244
01:13:07,078 --> 01:13:08,775
- I'm sorry, Okay? I
just need a minute.

1245
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:09,689
- Hey!

1246
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:12,779
Julie.

1247
01:13:12,953 --> 01:13:13,737
Julie!

1248
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,569
Hey, you are causing a scene.

1249
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:21,527
Julie.

1250
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:25,618
Julie, what's going on with you?

1251
01:13:33,278 --> 01:13:35,846
(Julie sighs)

1252
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:38,370
- I saw my daddy at the
grocery store today.

1253
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:40,981
- Oh, baby, you know
that's not possible.

1254
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:42,418
- He was just standing there,

1255
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:44,942
(somber music)

1256
01:13:45,116 --> 01:13:46,291
staring at me

1257
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:50,643
like a ghost.

1258
01:13:53,603 --> 01:13:55,300
- Baby, there's no
such thing as ghosts.

1259
01:13:57,302 --> 01:14:00,566
(somber music continues)

1260
01:14:03,308 --> 01:14:05,615
Look, I'm fighting
for our dream.

1261
01:14:06,746 --> 01:14:09,009
I still want our own church.

1262
01:14:12,883 --> 01:14:14,450
- You...

1263
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:15,668
I don't know if I do.

1264
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,933
- Look, you might've
had too much wine.

1265
01:14:20,107 --> 01:14:20,673
- Don't do that.

1266
01:14:22,109 --> 01:14:23,676
Our life was stolen from us.

1267
01:14:25,722 --> 01:14:27,854
Oh, but th- th-
th- this is easy.

1268
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:31,118
We're playing music, we get
paid, we sing, we go home.

1269
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:32,816
Repeat, do it again,
no one judging.

1270
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:34,470
- Well, maybe it is,

1271
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:36,341
but you knew who I was
when you married me.

1272
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:39,692
- I know, I did, I did. I
just didn't know who I was.

1273
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:43,174
Samuel, I...

1274
01:14:43,348 --> 01:14:46,612
(somber music continues)

1275
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:55,491
(somber music continues)

1276
01:14:57,405 --> 01:14:58,798
I was only five years old

1277
01:14:58,972 --> 01:15:00,887
the first time that my
daddy crawled into my bed.

1278
01:15:05,588 --> 01:15:06,327
And I...

1279
01:15:13,204 --> 01:15:16,686
(somber music continues)

1280
01:15:19,036 --> 01:15:20,298
So don't tell me

1281
01:15:23,344 --> 01:15:25,564
that there's no such
thing as ghosts.

1282
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,745
(somber music continues)

1283
01:15:37,707 --> 01:15:40,536
(birds twittering)

1284
01:15:42,755 --> 01:15:44,975
(TV blaring)

1285
01:15:52,373 --> 01:15:55,594
(TV blaring continues)

1286
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:04,081
(TV blaring continues)

1287
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:06,562
(gentle music)

1288
01:16:12,045 --> 01:16:14,744
- (knocking) Julie?

1289
01:16:19,226 --> 01:16:20,488
(knocking) Julie?

1290
01:16:20,663 --> 01:16:23,361
(Julie sobbing)

1291
01:16:23,535 --> 01:16:26,059
- Can you please shut the door?

1292
01:16:26,233 --> 01:16:28,584
(somber music)

1293
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,898
- Baby, I'm worried about you.

1294
01:16:40,683 --> 01:16:42,641
You've been in here a week,
and you haven't eaten.

1295
01:16:46,123 --> 01:16:48,386
I d- I don't know what to do.

1296
01:16:49,474 --> 01:16:50,431
- I need some time.

1297
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,389
I just

1298
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:54,827
can't get everything
out of my head.

1299
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:58,570
- Look, if you don't
talk to me, then-

1300
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:00,224
- Samuel, I need you
to just leave me alone.

1301
01:17:00,398 --> 01:17:03,749
- Well, can you at least
just tell me what I can do?

1302
01:17:03,923 --> 01:17:07,057
(somber music continues)

1303
01:17:09,537 --> 01:17:11,278
- Can you rewrite history?

1304
01:17:16,327 --> 01:17:19,983
Can you undo what
my daddy did to me?

1305
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:21,854
Or can you give us
our old life back?

1306
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:30,994
(somber music continues)

1307
01:17:34,258 --> 01:17:35,041
- No.

1308
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:44,137
(somber music continues)

1309
01:17:44,311 --> 01:17:45,617
I can love you.

1310
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:49,621
I can pray for you.

1311
01:17:54,365 --> 01:17:55,888
- Then just do that.

1312
01:17:57,716 --> 01:18:00,893
(somber music continues)

1313
01:18:04,941 --> 01:18:07,813
(telephone ringing)

1314
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:16,779
- Hello?

1315
01:18:16,953 --> 01:18:18,171
- (Caller) Could I speak
with Samuel, please?

1316
01:18:18,345 --> 01:18:19,912
- Yeah, this is him.

1317
01:18:20,086 --> 01:18:23,046
- (Dr. Emmett) This is Dr.
Emmett from the hospital.

1318
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,700
I served in the war
with your father.

1319
01:18:26,963 --> 01:18:30,401
Son, your daddy
had a heart attack.

1320
01:18:30,575 --> 01:18:33,186
I'm sorry to tell you,
he didn't make it.

1321
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,840
- Uh-
- I'm sorry, son.

1322
01:18:36,233 --> 01:18:37,582
He was a good man.

1323
01:18:40,193 --> 01:18:43,370
(somber music continues)

1324
01:18:49,246 --> 01:18:52,510
(somber music continues)

1325
01:18:58,516 --> 01:19:01,737
(somber music continues)

1326
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:10,963
(somber music continues)

1327
01:19:13,966 --> 01:19:16,795
(birds twittering)

1328
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:21,931
(somber music)

1329
01:19:29,721 --> 01:19:31,679
- "Often I dream
of your kindness.

1330
01:19:31,854 --> 01:19:33,159
Daily I dream of your touch.

1331
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:36,206
Oceans won't quell my desire.

1332
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:38,121
My darling, I miss you so much."

1333
01:19:41,994 --> 01:19:43,648
Dad, you were a poet?

1334
01:19:45,432 --> 01:19:48,653
(somber music continues)

1335
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:57,967
(somber music continues)

1336
01:19:58,141 --> 01:19:59,533
- (Joe) Today my
boy got in trouble.

1337
01:19:59,707 --> 01:20:01,144
I got a call this morning,

1338
01:20:01,318 --> 01:20:02,406
not from the police
department in Weems,

1339
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:03,755
where he was arrested,

1340
01:20:04,669 --> 01:20:06,062
but from T.L. Whittmore.

1341
01:20:07,324 --> 01:20:09,021
He told me my son was
in a bit of trouble,

1342
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:12,372
and he wanted me to meet him
in a coffee shop in Weems.

1343
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:13,547
I wanted to help my son.

1344
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:15,593
He wanted to cut a deal.

1345
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:18,204
(Samuel gasps)

1346
01:20:19,336 --> 01:20:22,600
(somber music continues)

1347
01:20:26,691 --> 01:20:29,694
(suspenseful music)

1348
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:40,052
(suspenseful music continues)

1349
01:20:46,798 --> 01:20:50,236
(suspenseful music continues)

1350
01:20:52,021 --> 01:20:54,762
- Read September 29th,
1969. You're right.

1351
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:56,852
I can't rewrite history,
but I can change the future.

1352
01:20:57,026 --> 01:20:59,202
- Wait. Samuel, please,
where are you going?

1353
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:05,556
(suspenseful music continues)

1354
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:08,733
(engine starting)
Sammy!

1355
01:21:11,649 --> 01:21:12,432
Sam!

1356
01:21:14,565 --> 01:21:18,047
(suspenseful music continues)

1357
01:21:21,789 --> 01:21:25,271
(suspenseful music continues)

1358
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:35,107
(suspenseful music continues)

1359
01:21:41,635 --> 01:21:45,117
(suspenseful music continues)

1360
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:55,214
(suspenseful music continues)

1361
01:22:00,872 --> 01:22:04,049
- I'm coming. (coughs)

1362
01:22:04,223 --> 01:22:05,877
Lord Almighty, who...

1363
01:22:07,661 --> 01:22:08,445
Samuel.

1364
01:22:12,014 --> 01:22:14,842
- September 29th,

1365
01:22:15,017 --> 01:22:15,800
1969.

1366
01:22:17,845 --> 01:22:19,673
You made a deal with my dad.

1367
01:22:24,113 --> 01:22:26,289
Now you tell me what happened.
I just wanna hear you say it.

1368
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:32,817
Say it!

1369
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,126
- I told your daddy

1370
01:22:38,997 --> 01:22:40,825
that if he walked
away from the GCO,

1371
01:22:40,999 --> 01:22:42,479
I'd have your charges dropped.

1372
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:45,047
Judge in Weems is
my brother-in-law.

1373
01:22:46,831 --> 01:22:47,963
- Whats wrong with you?

1374
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:53,533
You took the one
thing from my father

1375
01:22:55,057 --> 01:22:57,276
that he loved more than
anything in the world.

1376
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:58,147
- No.

1377
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:00,410
You got that wrong.

1378
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,067
- Is that right?

1379
01:23:06,503 --> 01:23:07,286
- Yeah.

1380
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:10,289
He loved you more.

1381
01:23:10,463 --> 01:23:12,944
(gentle music)

1382
01:23:16,469 --> 01:23:17,209
Oh, uh...

1383
01:23:18,471 --> 01:23:19,733
(gentle music continues)

1384
01:23:19,907 --> 01:23:21,518
- Poppa, who is this?

1385
01:23:23,563 --> 01:23:27,089
- Um, hey, I'm just here to
talk to your grandpa for a,

1386
01:23:27,263 --> 01:23:28,003
for a minute.

1387
01:23:31,049 --> 01:23:31,832
- Yeah, run on.

1388
01:23:32,877 --> 01:23:36,141
(gentle music continues)

1389
01:23:36,315 --> 01:23:37,664
Go on back inside.

1390
01:23:39,362 --> 01:23:43,583
(clears throat)
He's my grandson.

1391
01:23:43,757 --> 01:23:47,413
After Babsie died, I
hadn't been doing so well.

1392
01:23:48,849 --> 01:23:51,026
My daughter's been
helping take care of me.

1393
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:53,593
I got a few months, I guess.

1394
01:23:55,247 --> 01:23:58,381
I'm gonna pay for
my debts, Samuel.

1395
01:23:58,555 --> 01:24:00,035
(somber music)

1396
01:24:00,209 --> 01:24:00,992
I will.

1397
01:24:01,775 --> 01:24:03,560
I already am.

1398
01:24:03,734 --> 01:24:04,778
I don't even...

1399
01:24:06,258 --> 01:24:07,999
I don't, I don't
deserve forgiveness.

1400
01:24:10,523 --> 01:24:12,090
I know that.

1401
01:24:12,264 --> 01:24:15,746
(somber music continues)

1402
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,227
- You never even asked for it.

1403
01:24:21,621 --> 01:24:24,276
(Samuel sighs)

1404
01:24:26,148 --> 01:24:29,412
(somber music continues)

1405
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:34,721
Look, no one
deserves forgiveness.

1406
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:42,294
It's just something we
receive, like a gift.

1407
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:49,432
T.L., I've been there.

1408
01:24:49,606 --> 01:24:52,652
- (scoffs) No.

1409
01:24:52,826 --> 01:24:57,004
No, I'm afraid not, son.
You haven't been here.

1410
01:24:57,179 --> 01:24:58,745
- Look, God forgave
me at my lowest.

1411
01:25:01,531 --> 01:25:03,010
My bitterness toward
you is no better

1412
01:25:03,185 --> 01:25:05,230
than the things you did to me.

1413
01:25:06,405 --> 01:25:08,842
(gentle music)

1414
01:25:15,806 --> 01:25:16,981
I forgive you.

1415
01:25:18,635 --> 01:25:21,899
(gentle music continues)

1416
01:25:27,296 --> 01:25:29,820
- I don't know what to say.

1417
01:25:29,994 --> 01:25:32,779
(gentle music continues)

1418
01:25:32,953 --> 01:25:35,739
(Samuel sniggers)

1419
01:25:37,871 --> 01:25:40,265
- Well, that's a first.

1420
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:44,226
(gentle music continues)

1421
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,576
- Yeah, yeah, I reckon it is.

1422
01:25:48,665 --> 01:25:51,885
(gentle music continues)

1423
01:25:59,241 --> 01:26:02,505
(gentle music continues)

1424
01:26:04,681 --> 01:26:08,163
- (Samuel) (knocking) Julie?

1425
01:26:08,337 --> 01:26:10,817
(somber music)

1426
01:26:17,998 --> 01:26:21,437
(somber music continues)

1427
01:26:21,611 --> 01:26:22,612
When I met you,

1428
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:27,617
you shone like a thousand stars.

1429
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:31,882
(somber music continues)

1430
01:26:32,056 --> 01:26:32,839
But

1431
01:26:37,017 --> 01:26:40,282
I never knew how much
you've been hurt.

1432
01:26:40,456 --> 01:26:43,633
(somber music continues)

1433
01:26:46,113 --> 01:26:49,943
I'm not gonna like you get
sucked under that current.

1434
01:26:50,117 --> 01:26:51,510
I'm holding onto you.

1435
01:26:53,512 --> 01:26:54,252
If you go,

1436
01:26:55,297 --> 01:26:56,472
I go.

1437
01:26:56,646 --> 01:26:59,866
(somber music continues)

1438
01:27:02,913 --> 01:27:04,436
I don't have a dream
without you in it.

1439
01:27:07,091 --> 01:27:07,874
So I,

1440
01:27:09,572 --> 01:27:12,227
I did take the, the job
at the club, and, um,

1441
01:27:16,622 --> 01:27:17,101
I also took a, took a side
job working on the railroad

1442
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:21,932
with Reyna's brother
to pay off our debt.

1443
01:27:22,106 --> 01:27:25,065
(somber music continues)

1444
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,763
Just know I'm here for you.

1445
01:27:28,852 --> 01:27:32,377
And I should've what
you were going through.

1446
01:27:33,944 --> 01:27:37,382
(somber music continues)

1447
01:27:37,556 --> 01:27:38,296
I'm sorry.

1448
01:27:44,346 --> 01:27:46,261
I'm still praying for you.

1449
01:27:50,656 --> 01:27:51,962
I love you.

1450
01:27:52,136 --> 01:27:55,357
(somber music continues)

1451
01:28:01,232 --> 01:28:03,800
(Julie sobbing)

1452
01:28:06,803 --> 01:28:10,067
(somber music continues)

1453
01:28:16,378 --> 01:28:19,598
(somber music continues)

1454
01:28:24,342 --> 01:28:26,736
- (Foreman) All right, guys.
We're gonna take a long break.

1455
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:29,304
(gentle music)

1456
01:28:31,871 --> 01:28:32,698
45 minutes.

1457
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:39,357
(gentle music continues)

1458
01:28:42,491 --> 01:28:44,884
- "For all the land
which thou seest,

1459
01:28:45,058 --> 01:28:48,932
to thee will I give it,
and to thy seed forever."

1460
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:53,371
(gentle music continues)

1461
01:28:57,419 --> 01:29:00,639
(gentle music continues)

1462
01:29:05,818 --> 01:29:07,820
Everything I see, huh?

1463
01:29:07,994 --> 01:29:09,692
Hey, boss!

1464
01:29:09,866 --> 01:29:12,390
- Allen, can't you
see I'm resting?

1465
01:29:12,564 --> 01:29:14,131
- Yeah, sorry, uh...

1466
01:29:16,176 --> 01:29:17,569
Hey, what if I told
you that the Lord said

1467
01:29:17,743 --> 01:29:19,745
he was gonna gimme
everything I see right now?

1468
01:29:22,879 --> 01:29:25,272
- Well, I say, as long as
you ain't looking at me,

1469
01:29:25,447 --> 01:29:28,232
you can have it.

1470
01:29:28,406 --> 01:29:29,451
- Where are we?

1471
01:29:31,104 --> 01:29:32,584
- (Foreman) St. Cloud.

1472
01:29:33,846 --> 01:29:35,282
- St. Cloud.

1473
01:29:35,457 --> 01:29:36,936
- Yeah.

1474
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:38,373

1480
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:05,617
- Uh, you scared me.

1481
01:30:06,923 --> 01:30:08,228
- Sorry.

1482
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:09,360
- It's okay. I
shoulda come to bed.

1483
01:30:11,231 --> 01:30:13,233
- No, it's okay. You
worked really hard.

1484
01:30:15,453 --> 01:30:17,281
- Yeah, it's, it's
harder than I thought.

1485
01:30:25,463 --> 01:30:27,073
- You know, my daddy,

1486
01:30:30,729 --> 01:30:32,601
my daddy said that no
one would ever love me

1487
01:30:32,775 --> 01:30:34,472
once they found out
what he'd done to me.

1488
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,824
And I wanted to tell you, but

1489
01:30:40,522 --> 01:30:43,089
I loved you and I got scared.

1490
01:30:47,746 --> 01:30:49,052
But you protected me.

1491
01:30:51,315 --> 01:30:52,447
You believed in me.

1492
01:31:01,891 --> 01:31:02,979
I, uh...

1493
01:31:06,199 --> 01:31:09,899
I read your daddy's journals.
(gentle music)

1494
01:31:10,073 --> 01:31:12,467
He called your destiny
his Promised Land.

1495
01:31:14,556 --> 01:31:16,688
Okay, he knew what he was
doing when he walked away.

1496
01:31:20,823 --> 01:31:23,521
(sighs) I got lost
somewhere along the way.

1497
01:31:26,785 --> 01:31:28,134
But you kept loving me.

1498
01:31:30,528 --> 01:31:31,703
And you said you prayed for me.

1499
01:31:34,619 --> 01:31:36,621
And this morning
I woke up and I,

1500
01:31:39,537 --> 01:31:42,540
(sighs) I felt hope.

1501
01:31:44,455 --> 01:31:46,022
And I prayed for us.

1502
01:31:50,287 --> 01:31:51,157
Samuel Allen,

1503
01:31:53,769 --> 01:31:55,684
It is time for me
to believe in you.

1504
01:31:58,121 --> 01:32:00,602
(rousing music)

1505
01:32:06,564 --> 01:32:09,611
- I don't wanna
do it without you.

1506
01:32:09,785 --> 01:32:13,136
(rousing music continues)

1507
01:32:14,398 --> 01:32:15,530
- You won't have to.

1508
01:32:17,183 --> 01:32:20,535
(rousing music continues)

1509
01:32:26,453 --> 01:32:29,544
(rousing music continues)

1510
01:32:36,289 --> 01:32:39,597
(rousing music continues)

1511
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:44,428
(birds twittering)

1512
01:32:48,214 --> 01:32:51,130
- Hey, Julie, did you get my
guitar picks off the table?

1513
01:32:51,304 --> 01:32:51,870
- Yeah, I got 'em.

1514
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:54,525
- (Samuel) All right,
sorry, I'm just, um,

1515
01:32:54,699 --> 01:32:55,657
I'm a little nervous.

1516
01:32:55,831 --> 01:32:57,354
- Dad, are, are we moving?

1517
01:32:57,528 --> 01:33:00,705
- Uh, well, son, we only
got invited to minister.

1518
01:33:00,879 --> 01:33:02,620
- If we move, can I
get a bigger room?

1519
01:33:02,794 --> 01:33:04,361
- Hey, I want a bigger room too!

1520
01:33:04,535 --> 01:33:07,494
- Kids, I don't know
that we're moving.

1521
01:33:07,669 --> 01:33:09,409
- Aw!

1522
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:10,976
- What exactly did the man say?

1523
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:14,589
- He's part of the
advisory board.

1524
01:33:14,763 --> 01:33:16,373
Their pastor left, and
they asked us to fill in

1525
01:33:16,547 --> 01:33:18,244
till decisions are
made on a new pastor.

1526
01:33:19,768 --> 01:33:20,725
- A pastor like you.

1527
01:33:21,987 --> 01:33:25,469
- We're the Allen
family, and, uh,

1528
01:33:25,643 --> 01:33:26,905
we're gonna sing a song for you.

1529

(birds twittering)

1530
01:33:37,524 --> 01:33:39,004
My, my friend wrote this song.

1531
01:33:44,053 --> 01:33:48,187
Uh, th- this wasn't planned,
but I'm gonna sing it.

- Wow! (laughs)

1559
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:14,769
I have never heard music that
good in church before, ever.

1560
01:36:17,032 --> 01:36:21,688
Our guests today have
come highly recommended.

1561
01:36:23,168 --> 01:36:25,083
Obviously they are
incredible musicians,

1562
01:36:25,257 --> 01:36:26,998
but they can preach, too.

1563
01:36:28,434 --> 01:36:30,523
Please welcome
Pastor Samuel Allen.

1564
01:36:30,697 --> 01:36:31,655
(congregation applauding)

1565
01:36:31,829 --> 01:36:33,962
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

1566
01:36:35,659 --> 01:36:37,922
Well, thank you.

1567
01:36:38,096 --> 01:36:38,923
Thank you.

1568
01:36:39,097 --> 01:36:39,837
You have

1569
01:36:41,099 --> 01:36:42,579
no idea what an honor it is

1570
01:36:42,753 --> 01:36:44,015
for us to be here
with you today.

1571
01:36:45,364 --> 01:36:46,452
My wife,

1572
01:36:46,626 --> 01:36:47,410
Julie,

1573
01:36:48,454 --> 01:36:50,630
my kids, Jesse, Mia,

1574
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,241
We appreciate you having us.

1575
01:36:54,156 --> 01:36:56,114
I just, I wanna
tell you something.

1576
01:37:00,945 --> 01:37:04,340
You may have been
pushed around, beat up,

1577
01:37:05,471 --> 01:37:06,342
run over,

1578
01:37:07,299 --> 01:37:08,648
cheated on.

1579
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,389
- (Congregant) Amen.

1580
01:37:10,563 --> 01:37:14,002
- Maybe you've done those
things to someone else.

1581
01:37:14,176 --> 01:37:18,006
I'm just here to say that
there is always hope.

1582
01:37:20,356 --> 01:37:22,010
And I'm not, I'm not
sure what your story is,

1583
01:37:22,184 --> 01:37:25,143
but today I am here
to say that you never

1584
01:37:25,317 --> 01:37:27,798
give up on the dream
that God has given you.

1585
01:37:30,105 --> 01:37:30,845
Trust in him.

1586
01:37:34,805 --> 01:37:37,025
Could y'all look at your,
look at your neighbor?

1587
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:41,029
Yeah, look at your
neighbor, and just say,

1588
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,032
"It's time to dream again."

1589
01:37:45,294 --> 01:37:48,645
(congregation chattering)

1590
01:37:49,733 --> 01:37:50,865
God bless you.
- Thank you.

1591
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:51,866
- (Samuel) Thank you.

1592
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:53,302
- (Julie) God bless.

1593
01:37:53,476 --> 01:37:55,043
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming.

1594
01:37:55,217 --> 01:37:57,872
- (Samuel) Yeah, thank
you so much. God bless.

1595
01:37:58,046 --> 01:37:59,395
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- I'm so proud of you.

1596
01:37:59,569 --> 01:38:01,266
- Thank you. Thanks.

1597
01:38:07,664 --> 01:38:08,447
Thank you.

1598
01:38:09,709 --> 01:38:10,493
God bless you.

1599
01:38:12,364 --> 01:38:16,107
- Well, Pastor Samuel, it has
been very nice to meet you.

1600
01:38:16,281 --> 01:38:18,980
I'm sold. You have
an incredible family.

1601
01:38:19,154 --> 01:38:21,243
Everyone here
obviously loves you.

1602
01:38:21,417 --> 01:38:23,898
You are gonna build
a great church here.

1603
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:29,033
- W- w- what do,
what do you mean?

1604
01:38:29,207 --> 01:38:30,817
- When the pastor
of this church left,

1605
01:38:30,992 --> 01:38:34,038
it was legally turned over
to our advisory board,

1606
01:38:34,212 --> 01:38:35,822
and someone of great influence,

1607
01:38:35,997 --> 01:38:38,651
who wished to remain unnamed,

1608
01:38:38,825 --> 01:38:40,610
paid the mortgage
off on this place

1609
01:38:40,784 --> 01:38:45,354
with the stipulation that you
must become our new pastor.

1610
01:38:46,572 --> 01:38:48,966
(gentle music)

1611
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,098
That's how we found you.

1612
01:38:53,101 --> 01:38:55,712
Somebody thinks
very highly of you,

1613
01:38:55,886 --> 01:38:56,843
so I'm gonna be here at 9:00 AM

1614
01:38:57,018 --> 01:38:58,367
to turn over all the paperwork.

1615
01:38:59,629 --> 01:39:00,108
If you want it,

1616
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:03,589
this place is yours.

1617
01:39:04,895 --> 01:39:06,157
- I can't believe it.

1618
01:39:08,855 --> 01:39:11,206
Um, I mean yes. Yes, of course.

1619
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:12,685
I mean, of course we want it,

1620
01:39:12,859 --> 01:39:14,035
more than anything in the world.

1621
01:39:15,819 --> 01:39:18,909
- You just preached a
wonderful sermon on dreams.

1622
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:20,302
I don't think you should
be surprised by this,

1623
01:39:20,476 --> 01:39:21,433
Pastor Samuel.

1624
01:39:21,607 --> 01:39:24,567
(gentle music)

1625
01:39:24,741 --> 01:39:25,524
Welcome.

1626
01:39:28,049 --> 01:39:29,789
- Never surrender the dream.

1627
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:31,356
- Never.

1628
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:33,228
- Thank you.

1629
01:39:33,402 --> 01:39:34,098
- Thank you.

1630
01:39:36,274 --> 01:39:39,016

(both laughing)

1632
01:39:41,236 --> 01:39:43,978

(gentle music continues)

1634
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:52,116

(gentle music continues)

1636
01:40:01,734 --> 01:40:03,127
- Win the world, son.

1637
01:40:05,608 --> 01:40:06,522
Win the world.

1638
01:40:06,696 --> 01:40:10,178

(somber music continues)

1647
01:41:13,284 --> 01:41:14,242
- Hey, baby.

1648
01:41:16,374 --> 01:41:19,290
The kids are in the
car. Are you ready?

1649
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,078
- Yeah, baby, I'm ready.

1650
01:41:25,557 --> 01:41:29,300
I just need to lock up.
Give me two minutes.

1651
01:41:29,474 --> 01:41:30,171
- All right.

1652
01:41:35,263 --> 01:41:38,483

(somber music continues)

1658
01:42:26,401 --> 01:42:29,534
- Gary the goose,
oh man, he's hungry.

1659
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:33,669
- Daddy, no! Please, no!
- He's hungry! He's hungry!

1660
01:42:33,843 --> 01:42:36,454
Think about the
deepest, highest,

1661
01:42:36,628 --> 01:42:39,805
strongest, and widest
thing there could ever be.

1662
01:42:39,979 --> 01:42:42,678

for you. Yes, sir.
