1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,674
Hello? What?

2
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,651
What is it?

3
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,778
Warren?

4
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,907
-What's going on?
-Katie, wake up.

5
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,538
-Yes, Uncle Warren?
-Get dressed. You're coming with me.

6
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,416
Get dressed.

7
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,009
Janine? Janine!

8
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,389
Get Isaac up right now.
I have to leave in two minutes.

9
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,933
We're leaving the Crick?
I'll pack a bag.

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,062
To hell with the bag,
tell Isaac to get the truck, now.

11
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,283
I'm taking Katie with me.
I want you to stay here.

12
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,244
But I'm your first wife. I have to come.

13
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,080
What's happening?

14
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,082
Where's Uncle Warren going?

15
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,552
-What do we tell the cops?
-Isaac, now. Go.

16
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,763
You can't leave me here, Warren.

17
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,228
I need you to stay and mind things here,
and, Janine, keep sweet for the Lord.

18
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,646
Go.

19
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,104
-Uncle Warren?
-Just drive. Drive normal.

20
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,108
<i>-We thank thee, oh, God for a prophet
-We thank thee, oh, God for a prophet</i>

21
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:57,570
<i>-To guide us in these latter days
-To guide us in these latter days</i>

22
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:03,868
<i>-We thank thee for sending the gospel

23
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,748

26
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,428

27
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,265
<i>-And love to obey thy command

28
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,397
-Hello, Warren.
-Oh, thanks.

29
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,526
-Is he in there?
-Yes, Uncle Warren, with Richard Alvey.

30
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:44,743
And now, Richard, you know
what we have to do with your boy.

31
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,204
Jesse was such a good kid
up until last year.

32
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:54,377
Obedience to God through his prophets
is first and most important.

33
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:59,966
Yes, sir. That's all I've ever taught him,
but then he got obsessed with that girl.

34
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:09,351
Richard, let's pray together
for his swift return to your house.

35
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,812
We'll give him one more chance.

36
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,192
Amen.

37
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,572
Thank you for your kindness, sir.

38
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,287
-What do you want?
-Is everything okay?

39
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,458
If I needed you, Warren,
I would have called.

40
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,880
Now, why don't you go and entertain
the guests with your little guitar?

41
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,010
Sorry to interrupt, Uncle Rulon.

42
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,221
They're waiting to cut the cake.

43
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:51,267
Well, come.
Help this old man to his feet.

44
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,829
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, everyone.

45
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,843
God bless you.

46
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:36,104
-How many wives is this, now?
-Fifty-six, I believe.

47
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:41,609
All the wives smile, please.
Eyes open. Right here.

48
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,224
God told Joseph Smith:

49
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,896
"If he have 10 virgins given unto him
by this law, he cannot commit adultery."

50
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,898
Thank you, Margaret.

51
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:24,152
And what is the highest honor
for a woman?

52
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:33,244
-Are we boring you, Elissa?
-No, Uncle Warren.

53
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,580
Let's see.

54
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:41,753
Why don't you tell the class
what the highest honor is for a woman?

55
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:49,010
-To be a mother?
-That's right! To be a heavenly mother.

56
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,554
Too bad she doesn't have a father.

57
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,724
Mind your tongue, Margaret.

58
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,978
-Sorry, Elissa.
-Okay.

59
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:03,441
Now, tonight,
I want you all to write an essay...

60
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,987
...about the importance of putting
ourselves in each other's shoes.

61
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,407
Three pages, single-spaced.

62
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,910
-Are we understood?
-Yes, Uncle Warren.

63
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,912
Class dismissed.

64
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,378
Hey, Lamont.

65
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,213
-Let me walk you home?
-Yes, sure.

66
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,341
-Elissa?
-Hey, let's go!

67
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,678
-I need to see you a minute.
-See you, Emily.

68
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,024
How long has this been going on?

69
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,445
I'm sorry. What, Uncle Warren?

70
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,074
The other kids. How long
have they been treating you like that?

71
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:02,459
Well, your dad runs off,
you're not much around here after that.

72
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,753
How are things in your new home?

73
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,924
Honestly? Not great.

74
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,347
Doesn't feel like we're part of his family.

75
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,768
I had 25 brothers and sisters
when I was your age.

76
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,897
It took me a long while
to figure out my place in this world.

77
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,735
Any of those kids give you trouble again,
you let me know. All right?

78
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,406
-Thanks, Uncle Warren.
-Okay.

79
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:42,290
And, Elissa,
mind the company you keep.

80
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,462
-Yes, Uncle Warren.
-That's all.

81
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:15,240
<i>There's a he, there's a she
The moon is right above</i>

82
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:19,911
<i>Here am I, the reason why
They should fall in love</i>

83
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,872
-Hello, ladies.
-Hello, Uncle Warren.

84
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,335
Mother Janet, Mother Carol.

85
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:35,218
Gentlemen, I hope you don't mind
but I need a word with my boy here.

86
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,721
-That's fine.
-Thank you.

87
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,806
-Hello, Warren.
-Hey.

88
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,808
Hi, George.

89
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,731
Sit down.

90
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,614
I had another dream last night.
We were raided.

91
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,576
The police came
and dragged me out of bed.

92
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,745
Dad, the raid was a long time ago.

93
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:06,541
You know, Warren,
you've never lived anywhere else.

94
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,587
You've never lived anywhere
but this community.

95
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:15,216
You don't see it. They hate us.

96
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,761
They think we're freaks and perverts.

97
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,347
-They want us gone.
-I'll talk to the marshals...

98
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,767
-...see if Bill Brady's heard anything.
-Forget Bill Brady.

99
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,895
God spoke to me. He will save us.

100
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,898
He will lift us up to heaven
before they destroy us.

101
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,275
The end is almost here, Warren.

102
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:37,322
Dad, this isn't the first time
you've seen the end in a dream.

103
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:41,076
-What?
-I'm just trying to be practical.

104
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,245
I just--

105
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:53,797
Do you dare question
what God has said to me?

106
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,216
No, Father.

107
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:07,227
-Do I need to doubt your faith?
-No, Father.

108
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,072
When is the day of reckoning?

109
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:24,285
Gather everyone in the field, June 12th.

110
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,749
Yes, sir.

111
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:57,068
It's past midnight, Dad.
It's not the 12th anymore.

112
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,404
I don't feel well.

113
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,950
Here. Talk to them.

114
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,077
What do I say?

115
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:11,249
-Go.
-Dad. Dad!

116
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,276
Good people?

117
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,322
Good people.

118
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,201
The Lord has spoken.

119
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:52,707
Just a moment ago, he told his servant,
our Prophet Rulon...

120
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:56,419
...that he has granted us a reprieve...

121
00:13:56,586 --> 00:14:02,217
...so that we may pray
that we'll be ready when he next calls.

122
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:15,772
This is God's word given to me
by our prophet, and you're not listening?

123
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,734
Obedience to him is as to God...

124
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:25,615
...and only those pure in heart
with absolute faith will be lifted up.

125
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,911
We know that the end
is almost upon us...

126
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,041
...and this may be our last chance
to show we're worthy.

127
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:40,547
All of the signs are out there,
just beyond the gates of this town...

128
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:46,845
...wickedness and evil, the forces
of Satan that want to destroy us...

129
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:53,601
...but God is coming for us,
and not for anybody else.

130
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,354
I know that...

131
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:01,568
...and I feel intense joy and pride
to be among the chosen...

132
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:05,071
...and that's what you all
should feel tonight.

133
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,950
Oh, Lord, how we should praise him.

134
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,953
-Praise to you, Warren.
-Amen.

135
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,093
Hello?

136
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,027
Warren.

137
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,779
Save your strength, Father.

138
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:52,369
Warren.
I need you to do something for me.

139
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:59,417
-Anything.
-Go see Noah Fielding.

140
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:04,255
I want him ordained an apostle now.

141
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,967
When I pass...

142
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,429
...Noah Fielding...

143
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:16,184
...will be the next prophet.

144
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,874
I don't understand.

145
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:48,341
-Mother always said that--
-Go tell Noah Fielding.

146
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,803
That's who God has chosen.

147
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,602
Have you told the priesthood council?

148
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,069
Father?

149
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,115
Father!

150
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,134
Take a seat, Warren. We're just dividing
areas of responsibility for the council.

151
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,804
Father's asked me to handle all his
day-to-day decisions for the time being.

152
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,474
We've all agreed
we should go see him together...

153
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,934
...to discuss the appointment
of his successor.

154
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,354
You all agreed?

155
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,607
When, exactly, did you have time
to agree on anything?

156
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,735
Look, we're just trying
to be practical here.

157
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,820
Of course.
You all just wanna relieve...

158
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,448
...a little of my family's burden
in our time of need.

159
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,450
That is exactly right, Warren.

160
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,580
Well, then, how could I be anything
but grateful?

161
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:07,337
-When dark uprisings threaten....
-Excuse me?

162
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,257
I have to tell our prophet
you've been convening in secret...

163
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,635
...to make decisions without him.

164
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:17,681
-That is what you just told me, isn't it?
-Oh, come on, Warren.

165
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,265
You're overreacting.

166
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,184
While I was at my father's bedside...

167
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:25,814
...while the prophet you all claim to love
and honor was lying in his sickbed...

168
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,024
...you guys met behind closed doors...

169
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:31,986
...to determine the fate of this community,
didn't you?

170
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:35,782
He's 92, Warren. It's a concern.
We need to be ready.

171
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,495
You're right. We do.

172
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:47,168
And at the appointed time, the Lord
will choose an appropriate successor.

173
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,045
We are the priesthood council.

174
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:53,383
-We should all submit candidates, and--
-It's in the hands of God.

175
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,386
All we can do is submit to his mercy.

176
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,230
Elissa?

177
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,025
What's wrong?

178
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:15,196
I was hoping I could maybe have a word
with Uncle Rulon.

179
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,783
Our prophet's real sick, Elissa.
Is there something I can help you with?

180
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,202
Who did this to you?

181
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:25,915
It's....

182
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,920
-It's my step-cousin, Allen.
-Allen Steed?

183
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:36,718
He's just mean to me.

184
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,387
It's because you're different.

185
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:45,894
You're quiet and you draw. You think.

186
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,564
And you've suffered enough.

187
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:53,651
I'll talk to Fred Jessop, make sure Allen
never lays another finger on you.

188
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,280
I will always protect you.

189
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,867
Thanks, Uncle Warren.

190
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,788
And, Elissa....

191
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,424
What happened?

192
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,679
I'm coming right now.

193
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,015
Are you gonna be our next prophet,
Uncle Warren?

194
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,603
Thank you.

195
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,623
Thank you.
You know how much he loves you.

196
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,691
The voice of God.

197
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:30,248
I will be the voice of God on Earth.

198
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:39,215
Anyone who won't hear it,
I will cast them out.

199
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,492
Who is that?

200
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,497
He's not even in his grave.

201
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,375
Look at them.

202
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:04,843
-When is the meeting?
-This evening in my father's office.

203
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,721
There's gonna be trouble.

204
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,902
As he lay dying...

205
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:29,534
...my father, Rulon,
asked me to make a solemn promise.

206
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,580
He said, "Warren...

207
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:41,254
...promise me that you will protect
the people of Short Creek.

208
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,634
Save them from the apostates...

209
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:52,265
...because they will come here
and try to take our children...

210
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,561
...destroy everything we have built...

211
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,065
...that's why they're sending their spies."

212
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:06,404
They are out there even now,
planning their next incursion.

213
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:13,578
And that's why
we have to be closer now to God...

214
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:17,707
...and to each other, than ever before.

215
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,294
Losing Uncle Rulon...

216
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,885
...has caused us all
such deep sadness and pain.

217
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:32,180
Sometimes I think
that sadness will swallow me up...

218
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:40,814
...but then I think about the promise
I made to my father, and to you all.

219
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:46,194
I will honor that promise.

220
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:49,406
I will grab his hand.

221
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:56,121
I will take all of your hands in mine,
and we will rise up together in glory.

222
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:05,880
Until God sees fit
to take me from this Earth...

223
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:09,217
...I will be the prophet you deserve.

224
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:49,549
Hey. Is your daddy home?

225
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,760
He's taken one of my moms
to the dentist.

226
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,637
Then he's gonna make us pancakes.

227
00:25:55,555 --> 00:26:01,561
Do you know who I am?
Don't worry, you will.

228
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,569
Hello?

229
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:55,115
Can I help you, Warren?

230
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,666
Warren.

231
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,504
I'm so very sorry for your loss.

232
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,465
Before he died,
Rulon asked me to come to you.

233
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,385
Come on. Let's talk inside.

234
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,931
What is it?

235
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,313
The Lord revealed your sins
to Uncle Rulon.

236
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,525
You're no longer welcome
in this community.

237
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,236
What?

238
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,576
You have 48 hours to leave Hildale.

239
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,996
Noah! Come quick!

240
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:47,000
-Emma?
-Look what he's done! It's horrible.

241
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,089
Oh, God.

242
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,566
Help me sweep over here.

243
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,570
-Girls, I need you inside, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

244
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,739
Let me know if you need help.

245
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,411
-Coming!
-All right, I'm almost done.

246
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,378
Lamont, careful.
We're gonna get caught.

247
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,088
No, we're not.

248
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,314
Simon, come here.

249
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,613
Hey, Mom.

250
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:06,329
-Are you mad at me? Because--
-Take a seat, Elissa.

251
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:10,917
Uncle Warren.

252
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:14,838
We have a place for you.

253
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,676
It's a great honor to be chosen.

254
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,887
I don't understand.

255
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:27,726
Your mother tells me that
you've been getting your monthly visitor.

256
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,022
That means you're ready.

257
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,067
God has spoken to Uncle Warren...

258
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:40,113
...and he's asked us to prepare you
to be placed.

259
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:48,246
Who am I to be placed with?

260
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,707
God will reveal that tonight.

261
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:53,585
-Tonight?
-Make sure she's ready.

262
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,462
Yes, Uncle Warren.

263
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,601
Come on, Elissa. Open the door, now!

264
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:20,111
No. Please, no.

265
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:23,698
I beg you, Mom.

266
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:28,495
I don't wanna get married.
I'll do anything.

267
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:33,041
I love you. Open the door.

268
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:38,380
-No.
-Come on, Lissie darling.

269
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:44,761
I want what's best for you.
You know that.

270
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,521
-No!
-Do as your mother says, right now.

271
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,240
Get in, Elissa.

272
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,288
There's nothing to be afraid of.

273
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,791
It's in God's hands now.

274
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:32,892
Uncle Warren,
she's as ready as she's gonna be.

275
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:03,214
Do you, Allen Glade Steed,
take sister, Elissa Wall Jessop...

276
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:07,052
...to be your wife,
for time and all eternity?

277
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:11,431
-I do.
-This is the way.

278
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:13,516
There is no other way.

279
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:17,604
No name given under God.

280
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:23,651
Do you, brother Allen....

281
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:27,364
Elissa!

282
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:31,493
I'm going to ask you once again.

283
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:35,747
Do you, sister Elissa Wall Jessop...

284
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:39,042
...take brother Allen Glade Steed...

285
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:43,296
...to be your husband,
for time and all eternity?

286
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:49,052
I....

287
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,929
I do.

288
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:53,139
You may kiss the bride.

289
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,476
Elissa, kiss your husband.

290
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:06,653
Now go forth,
multiply and replenish the Earth.

291
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:17,497
I need you, Janine, more than ever.
I need you.

292
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:20,041
I need your strength...

293
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:24,129
...and your kindness and your decency.

294
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:28,008
I need you to show these girls the way.

295
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:31,344
You can do that for me, can't you?

296
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,435
Whatever you think is best.

297
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,730
Nails.

298
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,359
Good. Next.

299
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:50,447
You will all have the honor
of becoming the wife of our new prophet.

300
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:54,701
Clean and orderly is not enough.
You must be immaculate.

301
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,914
This braid is not tight enough.

302
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,634
Your eyes are bloodshot, Rebecca.
You've been crying. What's wrong?

303
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:15,764
-I can't do this.
-It's Warren's bidding.

304
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,350
But it's against our faith.

305
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:21,811
Cursed is anyone
who sleeps with his father's wife...

306
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:26,149
...for he dishonors his father's bed.
It's wrong.

307
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:31,404
Leave us.

308
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,411
I'm sorry.

309
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,957
Janine, you're his first wife.

310
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,460
You can't want this any more than I do.

311
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:51,257
Ours is not to want,
or to question right or wrong...

312
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:53,760
...ours is to obey.

313
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:21,413
You look beautiful, ladies.

314
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:25,667
Please come
and stand in front of the prophet.

315
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:31,548
Now, let's see.
It's Katie Christianson, and Elsa--

316
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:36,553
-Alma, sir. Alma Mackert.
-Alma, right. Call me Uncle.

317
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,390
And, of course, the lovely Rebecca.

318
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,939
Rebecca, are you ready
to be placed in marriage?

319
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,483
I would not choose any of this, sir.

320
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:54,070
Are you refusing me?

321
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:59,075
I was married to your father, sir.
I honor that contract.

322
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:01,870
Please don't make me do this.

323
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,044
You've had too much freedom.

324
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:13,840
You need to learn
to be an obedient wife.

325
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,738
I'm going to ask you again.

326
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,866
Are you ready to be placed in marriage?

327
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,912
I won't do it.

328
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:52,420
-Brent, lock her in her room.
-Yes, sir.

329
00:36:56,383 --> 00:37:00,512
Only God decides
who you're placed with, not you.

330
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,725
Only God.

331
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:22,325
Where were we?

332
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,718
-Lamont.
-Uncle Warren?

333
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:42,178
You're coming with me, son.

334
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:53,857
When I was 12 years old,
I went to my father...

335
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:58,028
...and I told him my brother Lyle was
stealing quarters from his dresser drawer.

336
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:00,363
You know what my father said?

337
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:03,700
He told me not to snitch on my brother.

338
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,994
Said I needed to learn what loyalty was.

339
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,373
Threw me out of the house
with just the clothes on my back.

340
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:16,379
So I walked 30 miles across the desert,
nearly died of thirst.

341
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:21,593
I saw the outside world,
and I was disgusted by the perversity:

342
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,554
The blacks, the homosexuals...

343
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:29,726
...the fallen women,
all the warped priorities.

344
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,895
Get out.

345
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,189
Uncle Warren, where--

346
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:36,775
You're no longer welcome
in our community.

347
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:40,653
Go on. Get out.

348
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,028
You lost?

349
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,579
You think you know something about me,
don't you?

350
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:33,748
You think you can judge me.

351
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,043
You think you're the good guy
and I'm the bad guy.

352
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,753
-Is that what you think?
-Come on.

353
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,214
Take your hands off of me.

354
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:47,637
You're the one who's lost. You hear me?

355
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:51,182
You're the one who's lost.

356
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:35,435
Evening, sheriff.

357
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,399
-How do you feel?
-I feel good.

358
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:42,942
You feel good, Uncle Warren.

359
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:46,071
-Yes. Do you feel the same?
-Yes.

360
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:47,906
Yes.

361
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:50,158
-Can you feel the presence of the Lord?
-Yes.

362
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,535
-What do you feel?
-Happy. I feel God.

363
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:54,037
-What do you feel?
-Yes.

364
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:55,455
-What do you feel?
-I feel God!

365
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,749
-Do you feel the presence of the Lord?
-Yes.

366
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:00,460
-Tell me. You do.
-I feel God in you, Uncle Warren.

367
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:21,773
-I feel good. Yes.
-Do you feel good? What do you feel?

368
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,358
-Say it.
-It feels good.

369
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:25,694
Look in my eyes and tell me.
What do you feel?

370
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,028
I feel God in you.

371
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:44,504
Do you feel it?
Yes, yes, say it! I need to hear it!

372
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:47,257
Yes, I feel it, I feel it!

373
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:09,195
-Who is it?
-Me, Uncle Warren.

374
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,452
What do you want?

375
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:18,872
Losing Rulon's been so hard
on all of us.

376
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,541
And now you're grieving...

377
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:26,129
...just the same as me,
but you need to know something.

378
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,716
Rulon's not dead.

379
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:35,013
He's been restored. He's alive in me.

380
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:38,975
He wants you to feel him through me.

381
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:41,603
Please, Uncle Warren,
just leave me alone.

382
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:44,189
Come and pray with me.

383
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:48,902
-I want to help.
-No, no, don't do this.

384
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:55,158
-God wants me to place you in marriage.
-No.

385
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:59,537
I won't do it, Warren. I won't.

386
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:06,711
I am going to break you.

387
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:11,966
I am going to teach you
to be an obedient wife.

388
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:56,845
You have got to stop fighting this,
Rebecca.

389
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:58,805
I can't.

390
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:02,976
I was bound in marriage to Rulon,
just like you are to Warren.

391
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:05,645
You know it's wrong, Janine.

392
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:29,711
If you wanna leave,
you have to come now.

393
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:33,298
There's no one guarding
the other side of the house.

394
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:36,801
-Where's Warren?
-He's asleep.

395
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:41,890
Come with me.

396
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:47,395
You have to hurry.

397
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:00,492
Hey, Isaac. You're not sleeping?

398
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:04,412
Warren's got me keeping watch from 4,
so I figured it ain't hardly worth it.

399
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:07,707
How about I make you some coffee?
Come on down to the kitchen.

400
00:45:56,548 --> 00:45:58,466
Where's Rebecca?

401
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:00,802
Where the hell is she?

402
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:06,725
One of you bitches let her out,
didn't you?

403
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:40,717
Sorry, Isaac told me to wait
for you right--

404
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:42,093
What? What is it?

405
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,638
-Can we talk in private?
-Allen, spit it out.

406
00:46:45,805 --> 00:46:50,226
My wife, Elissa,
she won't fulfill her wifely duties.

407
00:46:51,102 --> 00:46:54,314
-You haven't had intercourse yet?
-She won't allow it.

408
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:57,067
It's not her place to allow you anything.

409
00:46:57,734 --> 00:47:00,195
But what can I do? She won't touch--

410
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,074
Women respond to authority, Allen.

411
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,245
-You're the man. Be forceful.
-Thank you, Uncle Warren. Thank you.

412
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,561
Hey.

413
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,484
Now you're a woman.

414
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:42,696
So, what do you say?

415
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,788
Thank you, Allen.

416
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,810
-Morning, Gary.
-Hey, Kim.

417
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:17,355
You moving in or what?

418
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:21,443
Well, my motel room
got broken into last night.

419
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:23,737
God, Gary. I'm sorry.

420
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:26,823
-They take much?
-Nothing as far as I can tell.

421
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,408
What were they looking for?

422
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:31,911
Oh, I reckon they were just trying
to make me feel welcome.

423
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:34,414
Not really trying to steal anything...

424
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:37,125
...so I figured
I didn't need to call Sheriff Brady.

425
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,127
We've got to get him decertified...

426
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:42,297
...him and his other polygamist buddies
in the police department.

427
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:44,883
Well, it's not just the marshals,
you know that.

428
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:50,638
It's everybody.
Judges, doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs.

429
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:54,642
All with multiple wives,
all living the FLDS dream.

430
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,479
Doing what the prophet
tells them to do.

431
00:48:57,645 --> 00:49:01,399
But this one,
this one's pissing some people off.

432
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:06,071
He's a lot more controlling
than his dad was, and he's not stable.

433
00:49:06,237 --> 00:49:08,239
I think he's gonna screw up.

434
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:14,079
Engels.

435
00:49:14,662 --> 00:49:17,957
Yes, sir. On the way.

436
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:28,635
<i>Now, Miss Musser,
you know if you go through with this...</i>

437
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:32,180
<i>...they will do everything they can
to ruin you.</i>

438
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:36,810
They'll discredit you,
drag your name through the mud.

439
00:49:37,977 --> 00:49:39,896
I know.

440
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,650
And you're okay with all that?

441
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:48,321
I left my little sister behind.

442
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:51,366
Elissa Wall.

443
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:55,328
-She's still at the Crick.
-Is she married?

444
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:58,498
Warren placed her
with her cousin Allen.

445
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,293
How old is she?

446
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:05,005
Fourteen.

447
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:12,303
<i>Gary Engels is the lead investigator
in the Warren Jeffs case...</i>

448
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,807
<i>...and, Gary, I've got to ask you:
Have you seen any signs...</i>

449
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:19,769
<i>...that Mr. Jeffs
is a danger to the public?</i>

450
00:50:19,936 --> 00:50:22,230
<i>What we have is an individual
who's using religion as an excuse...</i>

451
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:28,028
...to rape young girls, like the Taliban,
right here on American soil.

452
00:50:28,194 --> 00:50:33,158
The Taliban? Lies. Nothing but lies.

453
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:43,960
We are privileged to live and pray
on this hallowed ground, Zion...

454
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:49,132
...even though the whole wicked world
wants to destroy us.

455
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:53,470
But it seems that for some of us...

456
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,556
...Zion is not enough.

457
00:50:56,723 --> 00:51:02,312
God has revealed to me a conspiracy...

458
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:07,317
...between the apostates
and a few lost souls...

459
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:10,111
...right here
in our very own community.

460
00:51:10,653 --> 00:51:14,824
This conspiracy
involves branding us as criminals...

461
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:20,246
...for performing celestial marriages,
and so-called underage marriages.

462
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:24,626
I will not let this happen.

463
00:51:25,543 --> 00:51:31,966
God has delivered to me
a new set of laws to protect us...

464
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:34,803
...from the evil forces...

465
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:39,557
...that fester and propagate
in the outside world.

466
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:42,894
And by these laws, we shall live...

467
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:45,980
...and find happiness
in the kingdom of heaven.

468
00:51:46,147 --> 00:51:48,316
Amen.

469
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:52,904
First, the color red.

470
00:51:54,322 --> 00:52:00,161
<i>The color of Satan shall be banished
from within the community.</i>

471
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:06,668
<i>Swimming, basketball, baseball,
sports will no longer be allowed.</i>

472
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:12,966
<i>Instead, this time should be used
in study of prayer.</i>

473
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:21,307
All media, except radios,
will be expunged from the community.

474
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:24,978
<i>This includes TVs, movies...</i>

475
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:28,815
<i>...satellite dishes, computers,
the Internet...</i>

476
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:33,319
<i>...newspapers, books and magazines.</i>

477
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:39,993
There will be no dancing or music,
except for approved religious hymns.

478
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,540
And finally, there have been a number
of incendiary incidents involving dogs.

479
00:52:47,959 --> 00:52:52,589
<i>The canine is a direct descendant
of the wolf, the devil's mascot.</i>

480
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:55,967
<i>Colorado City
will no longer tolerate the presence...</i>

481
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:58,970
<i>...of these hellhounds
within its borders.</i>

482
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:02,307
<i>All dogs must be surrendered...</i>

483
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:05,894
<i>...and will be delivered to agencies
outside Colorado City.</i>

484
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:11,649
<i>Our community is sacred.</i>

485
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:17,364
<i>If it is to remain sacred,
God's words must be heeded.</i>

486
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:27,165
I do this out of love for our God.

487
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:32,212
I do this because I love you all.

488
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:36,174
The Lord has instructed me
to take another wife.

489
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:38,426
Amen.

490
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:50,814
Let us proceed to the altar...

491
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:55,318
...where we will celebrate the sacred rite
of celestial marriage.

492
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,494
What's he doing here?

493
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:07,497
Somebody let him into the compound.

494
00:54:13,169 --> 00:54:15,630
Get Bill Brady over here right away.

495
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:19,551
He was trying to serve this subpoena.

496
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:24,639
-That legally compels you to testify.
-About what?

497
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:28,643
-Child brides, statutory rape, you name it.
-Who's accusing me?

498
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,645
No way to know.

499
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:32,814
-Could be anyone.
-This is serious, Warren.

500
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:35,108
No kidding.
It's because of what you're doing.

501
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:38,069
It's because they've heard
you're marrying off younger girls.

502
00:54:38,236 --> 00:54:39,446
What are we gonna do?

503
00:54:40,655 --> 00:54:43,158
Follow the word of God.

504
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:46,453
He will speak to me and I will listen.

505
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:59,132
Jesse Brewer, stand up.

506
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,969
Nate Carter, stand up.

507
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:09,059
Joseph Alvey, Isaac Mathers,
up, all of you.

508
00:55:10,643 --> 00:55:14,147
Roy Hodges, on your feet.

509
00:55:18,651 --> 00:55:20,820
Look at these men.

510
00:55:22,822 --> 00:55:28,078
Remember their faces,
for they are all master deceivers.

511
00:55:28,244 --> 00:55:33,124
From this moment on, you are
excommunicated from Colorado City.

512
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:37,796
You are hereby divorced
from your wives.

513
00:55:37,962 --> 00:55:41,966
Your children will be placed
in the care of more faithful men.

514
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:53,478
Let us pray for these unfaithful...

515
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:57,148
...that they may one day
return to their families...

516
00:55:58,149 --> 00:56:01,236
...and be accepted back
into God's church.

517
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:07,283
Daddy, what the prophet said about us
being given to other families...

518
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,327
...that's not true, is it?

519
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:12,747
Get out!

520
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:16,084
-Please, just leave us alone.
-You heard the prophet.

521
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:22,132
-You'll be reassigned to Edson Hodges.
-Get out of my house.

522
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:51,327
Roy. What are you doing, Roy?

523
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:54,122
Roy.

524
00:57:18,646 --> 00:57:21,191
<i>I'm so sorry about your baby.</i>

525
00:57:21,816 --> 00:57:25,153
God's plan
isn't always easy to understand.

526
00:57:26,988 --> 00:57:31,326
I believe in you, Elissa. Always have.

527
00:57:32,535 --> 00:57:34,537
But the thing is...

528
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:38,458
...I need to know
that you believe in me too.

529
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:41,795
Your sister, Rebecca...

530
00:57:43,963 --> 00:57:46,132
...she disappointed me.

531
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:48,968
She's been disloyal.

532
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:53,473
And disloyalty is something
that I just can't tolerate.

533
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,016
I have to put a stop to it.

534
00:57:55,558 --> 00:57:59,062
I do believe in you, Uncle Warren.

535
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:01,064
I do.

536
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:03,983
Well, I'm really glad to hear that,
Elissa...

537
00:58:05,443 --> 00:58:09,656
...because your faith is the only thing
that truly protects you.

538
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:15,930
What is it?

539
00:59:16,097 --> 00:59:18,433
Warren, there's a real investigation
going on here.

540
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,144
-They're talking to Rebecca.
-It's all hearsay.

541
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:23,146
Mohave County
doesn't have any evidence.

542
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:24,981
It's more than just the subpoena.

543
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:28,485
That investigator, Engels, he's gathering
evidence about child brides.

544
00:59:28,651 --> 00:59:31,821
-Oh, God, no.
-What do you want me to do?

545
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:36,993
For God's sakes, Bill, you need to
run those rabble-rousers out on a rail.

546
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,996
This guy's appointed by the county
attorney. I can't make him disappear.

547
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,831
-You got a badge too.
-Damn it, Bill.

548
00:59:41,998 --> 00:59:43,833
-You must be able to do some--
-Enough!

549
00:59:47,128 --> 00:59:49,297
God has spoken to me.

550
00:59:50,131 --> 00:59:53,468
Greater glory awaits us
in the new Zion.

551
00:59:57,972 --> 01:00:00,350
It's time to leave the Crick.

552
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:13,154
How much land is available?

553
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:17,492
Tract R17 has 1700 acres.

554
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:21,663
-Neighbors?
-Not for miles.

555
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:27,752
-What's the asking price?
-It's cheap.

556
01:00:27,919 --> 01:00:29,921
Just under a million
for the whole parcel...

557
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:34,592
...but they wanna know
who they're selling to.

558
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:36,970
Offer them $700,000.

559
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:39,389
Do it through Allred's company...

560
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:43,893
...and tell the sellers that the land will be
used as a corporate hunting retreat.

561
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:47,313
Can we do that?

562
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,985
This is the new Zion, Joe.
We can do anything we want.

563
01:00:57,532 --> 01:00:59,576
Come on, come on, come on.

564
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:28,646
Please help me.

565
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:31,649
Please help me.

566
01:01:52,128 --> 01:01:55,548
Ladies, you need to concentrate
on the bond of oneness.

567
01:01:55,715 --> 01:01:59,135
I need you to assist each other.
No one just stands around.

568
01:01:59,302 --> 01:02:05,058
I want you to learn the heavenly gentle
touch that, when you touch someone...

569
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:08,978
...the fiery spirit of God
is felt by that person.

570
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:10,980
Now, look around.

571
01:02:12,148 --> 01:02:14,984
Do you see the light
in each other's eyes?

572
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:23,326
That's it, like Sister Katie's doing.
That's right.

573
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,831
Now, Sister Amelia, come here.

574
01:02:27,997 --> 01:02:29,791
Come here and revive me.

575
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:36,297
If you're not ready, you'll be sent out.

576
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:39,801
The work the Lord has for me to do
is too important...

577
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:44,222
...to allow fearful wives
or doubting wives.

578
01:02:45,473 --> 01:02:47,142
You must make sure...

579
01:02:47,308 --> 01:02:51,396
...that you're not holding on to any
of those little particles of selfish emotion.

580
01:02:53,481 --> 01:02:57,110
Katie, help her.

581
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:06,661
All of you, place your hands on us.

582
01:03:14,961 --> 01:03:17,047
And thus sayeth the Lord:

583
01:03:17,213 --> 01:03:20,967
"Forever sacrifice
all of your false traditions."

584
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:48,995
Thank you.

585
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:57,295
So, Elissa,
you know why we're here, right?

586
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:59,964
You understand
what we're talking about?

587
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:04,969
We're talking about accomplice
to rape...

588
01:04:05,136 --> 01:04:08,306
...conspiracy to commit sexual acts
with a minor.

589
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:11,976
These are very, very serious crimes.

590
01:04:12,477 --> 01:04:14,979
They're crimes that we need to stop.

591
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:20,276
And I believe,
with your testimony, we can.

592
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:25,365
-There would be a trial?
-Eventually, yes.

593
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:30,620
Just think of all the young girls,
just like you, that you can save.

594
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:35,375
I'm not sure if I'm ready for that.

595
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:41,464
I understand, but see,
I figure with Warren behind bars...

596
01:04:41,631 --> 01:04:44,134
...this whole thing
could just come tumbling down...

597
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:49,055
...and then you and your family,
well, you'd have some hope.

598
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,392
Will Uncle Warren know that it was me?

599
01:04:55,645 --> 01:05:00,233
-Hello?<i>
-Warren, they sprung this raid on us.</i>

600
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,068
-They what?<i>
-They're coming for you.</i>

601
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:05,739
You got five minutes to get out, max.

602
01:05:05,905 --> 01:05:09,492
We know there are approximately
80 adults on the compound.

603
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:13,496
The intel says that Warren Jeffs
will most likely be sleeping...

604
01:05:13,663 --> 01:05:16,041
...in the master bedroom right here.

605
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:27,469
What is it?

606
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,431
Warren?

607
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:01,044
Did that come from town?

608
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:03,963
It turned in from one of the side roads
back there.

609
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:06,716
Go, go, go.

610
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:08,885
-Watch out and clear the perimeter.
-All clear.

611
01:06:19,479 --> 01:06:23,733
Mohave County Sheriff's Department.
I have an arrest warrant for Warren Jeffs.

612
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,527
Is Warren Jeffs here?

613
01:06:27,696 --> 01:06:29,239
Identify yourself, ma'am.

614
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:34,160
My name is Janine Jeffs...

615
01:06:34,327 --> 01:06:39,791
...the wife of the one true prophet,
Warren Steed Jeffs.

616
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:50,427
<i>One of the nation's
most notorious polygamists...</i>

617
01:06:50,593 --> 01:06:52,971
<i>...is now the focus of an all-out manhunt
by U.S. law enforcement.</i>

618
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:57,976
<i>Well, tonight Warren Jeffs is a fugitive...</i>

619
01:06:58,143 --> 01:07:01,730
<i>...but to his followers,
he's still a prophet.</i>

620
01:07:02,897 --> 01:07:05,650
<i>Leads are pouring in,
according to authorities...</i>

621
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:08,611
<i>...but so far, no one can say
for sure where Warren Jeffs is.</i>

622
01:07:13,825 --> 01:07:16,494
<i>So why is law enforcement
having such a tough time...</i>

623
01:07:16,661 --> 01:07:19,956
<i>...catching fugitive polygamist
sect leader Warren Jeffs?</i>

624
01:07:20,415 --> 01:07:23,626
Like Jesus, I am persecuted.

625
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:25,462
Like Jesus, I shall return.

626
01:07:26,963 --> 01:07:29,466
For this, you will have no warning.

627
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:33,803
Prepare yourself to be worthy...

628
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:38,641
...for I will bring the wrath of God down
upon those who come against me.

629
01:07:38,808 --> 01:07:41,227
<i>We do not know where he is right now.</i>

630
01:07:41,394 --> 01:07:45,565
However, there are several locations
where we know that he has followers...

631
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:48,401
<i>...and we believe that he travels
between those locations.</i>

632
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:55,408
I didn't think you'd get here so quick.

633
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:04,959
You're not dressed appropriately.

634
01:08:05,126 --> 01:08:09,464
She was out getting groceries and trying
not to attract attention, like you said.

635
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:12,217
While I'm here,
women will be dressed appropriately.

636
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:13,968
Yes, sir.

637
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:18,765
-What about the money?
-That's here.

638
01:08:23,144 --> 01:08:25,146
It's 50,000.

639
01:08:25,313 --> 01:08:28,149
I withdrew it from six different banks,
just like you asked.

640
01:08:28,316 --> 01:08:30,694
-You're on TV.
-Turn it up.

641
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,821
<i>Warren Steed Jeffs,
now on the list...</i>

642
01:08:32,987 --> 01:08:36,324
<i>...alongside the likes of Osama bin Laden
and James "Whitey" Bulger...</i>

643
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:39,202
<i>...wanted on, among other things,
18 counts of murder.</i>

644
01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:42,497
<i>Today we're announcing
the addition of Warren Steed Jeffs...</i>

645
01:08:42,664 --> 01:08:44,708
<i>...to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.</i>

646
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:47,711
<i>This designation carries
with it a $100,000 reward...</i>

647
01:08:47,877 --> 01:08:50,964
<i>...for information
leading to the arrest of Mr. Jeffs.</i>

648
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:53,299
Ten Most Wanted list.

649
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:58,221
I'm gonna be bigger than bin Laden.

650
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:08,440
This is kind of out in public, isn't it?

651
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:13,153
It's called hiding in plain sight, Brent, and
Isaac wanted to pick up some supplies.

652
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:16,156
There's something you should know,
Warren.

653
01:09:16,322 --> 01:09:19,159
They got someone to testify
against you.

654
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:21,786
It's Elissa Wall.

655
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:30,962
They've got the marriage records,
Warren. Photos from the wedding.

656
01:09:31,129 --> 01:09:33,798
If she testifies, it's over.

657
01:09:39,804 --> 01:09:42,974
Elissa Wall has chosen the path
to perdition.

658
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:49,064
Blood atonement
is the only way for her now.

659
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:51,649
We know where she is.

660
01:09:51,816 --> 01:09:54,277
What do you wanna do
about the special investigator?

661
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,992
Let all those
who are against us be damned.

662
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:06,831
I wish we could just get something to eat.

663
01:10:07,707 --> 01:10:10,377
So we'll stop at a gas station.

664
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:13,963
But someone might recognize you.

665
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:16,883
Aren't you afraid of getting arrested?

666
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,552
Why would I be afraid?

667
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:22,347
God is never going to let that happen.

668
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:24,516
FBI!

669
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:49,457
Engels.

670
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:51,835
Where?

671
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:53,837
Got it. Thanks.

672
01:10:56,214 --> 01:10:59,384
Matt, we got a possible sighting
of Warren in Texas...

673
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:01,428
...just outside of Eldorado on the 190.

674
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:03,805
Gotta get a warning to the T.H.P.

675
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:05,974
Can you do that for me?

676
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:28,413
-Just ask for....
-Twenty on 10, please.

677
01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:49,559
I have to go.

678
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:55,815
-Can I have some candy?
-Don't touch that.

679
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:03,490
Thirty-one fifty-five.

680
01:12:04,574 --> 01:12:08,161
And one of those prepaid phone cards,
please.

681
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:10,663
These they're so good.

682
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:23,385
-Look what I got.
-What is that?

683
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:28,640
You're famous, Uncle Warren.

684
01:12:45,323 --> 01:12:46,866
State police.

685
01:12:50,995 --> 01:12:53,665
Pull over. Act normal.

686
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:18,148
What's the problem, officer?

687
01:13:18,314 --> 01:13:21,192
Your temp license is partially obscured
by the plate holder...

688
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:23,570
...so I can't see the plate.
That's a violation.

689
01:13:23,737 --> 01:13:26,656
-I'll get it fixed as--
-License and registration, sir.

690
01:13:39,794 --> 01:13:43,298
-The vehicle does not belong to you?
-No. It's my boss's car.

691
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:47,469
He let us borrow it. We're on vacation.
We're just heading back to Denver.

692
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:52,140
-And what is your name?
-It doesn't matter.

693
01:13:55,935 --> 01:13:58,313
You're making me nervous, mister.

694
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,858
-What's the name of your passenger?
-John Findley.

695
01:14:06,654 --> 01:14:10,116
S.P. 17.
I have a 10-38, requesting backup.

696
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:14,412
-You carrying a firearm?
-I was about to say that's--

697
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:15,580
Hands up on your head!

698
01:14:15,747 --> 01:14:17,540
-Out of the vehicle, now!
-It's registered--

699
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:22,712
On the ground. Get on the ground.

700
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:32,639
Put this one in the cruiser
and come back and search the vehicle.

701
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:38,812
-What do we do?
-Keep sweet.

702
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:51,825
Sarge, we got a lot of money here.

703
01:14:51,991 --> 01:14:55,328
Two 9-millimeters
and a bunch of cassette tapes.

704
01:14:58,331 --> 01:15:01,042
Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

705
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,962
What is your name?

706
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:09,300
Sir?

707
01:15:13,972 --> 01:15:15,473
Sir?

708
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:22,480
Warren Steed Jeffs.

709
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:30,655
You're as wrong about this
as my father was about me.

710
01:15:30,822 --> 01:15:33,324
You see, when I was born...

711
01:15:33,491 --> 01:15:36,327
...I was too weak to even cry...

712
01:15:36,494 --> 01:15:41,791
...and nothing I ever did, right from that
first breath, was ever good enough.

713
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:46,463
He took one look at me
and decided I'd never count for anything.

714
01:15:46,629 --> 01:15:48,840
But he was wrong.

715
01:15:49,382 --> 01:15:53,970
You think if I'm bound by iron bars,
that I am contained...

716
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:57,265
...but you can't contain God.

717
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,893
You're not of God, Warren.

718
01:16:00,393 --> 01:16:03,813
A man of God
would never harm a child.

719
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:11,237
We protect the children
from the evils of your apostate world.

720
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:14,157
I've got a sense about you.

721
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:20,330
I think that somewhere,
deep down inside you...

722
01:16:20,497 --> 01:16:26,294
...you still believe in God, the God
that we all believe in, not Warren Jeffs.

723
01:16:27,295 --> 01:16:29,422
And I think
you know you're going to hell.

724
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:39,641
Well, see you in court, Warren.

725
01:16:48,566 --> 01:16:51,069
Were you traumatized?
Are you traumatized?

726
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:54,155
Elissa. Elissa,
can you tell me in your own words...

727
01:16:54,322 --> 01:16:56,991
...what it was like to be
in the compound?

728
01:16:57,158 --> 01:16:59,327
-Did he try to--?
-Did he marry you?

729
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:03,957
He married you at the age of 14?
Are there other girls that are there?

730
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:23,578
Watch your back! Sick bastard.

731
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:26,664
Bow down to the prophet!

732
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:29,209
No wives in here, Warren.
You the wife!

733
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:31,044
Where's God now?

734
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:32,879
See you in the yard, <i>puto.</i>

735
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:34,089
Close 18.

736
01:18:34,255 --> 01:18:35,799
You got a lot of fans.

737
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:02,659
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

738
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:07,831
So about the other prosecutions, do you
think we're looking at more arrests?

739
01:19:07,997 --> 01:19:09,624
Maybe. Maybe.

740
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:12,210
Now that Jeffs is locked up,
there's a good chance...

741
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:15,714
...that some other people will wanna talk
about those underage brides.

742
01:19:59,966 --> 01:20:01,926
Tell the wives to leave.

743
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:17,984
Write this down.

744
01:20:19,819 --> 01:20:21,154
Okay.

745
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:24,949
I want to say farewell...

746
01:20:25,825 --> 01:20:29,662
...to all of you who were worthy of Zion...

747
01:20:32,957 --> 01:20:34,751
...for I will not be there.

748
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:37,629
Of course you will be.

749
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:42,008
The Lord came to my prison cell
two days ago...

750
01:20:42,175 --> 01:20:44,427
...and saw that I...

751
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:50,975
...would rather deny than obey him...

752
01:20:53,311 --> 01:20:56,314
...because of the weakness of my flesh.

753
01:20:59,818 --> 01:21:01,903
I have sinned, Isaac.

754
01:21:04,155 --> 01:21:05,907
I have sinned.

755
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:08,993
Anyone who wants to...

756
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,621
...may hear this message...

757
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:15,834
...so that they may know
that I am a liar...

758
01:21:19,337 --> 01:21:23,133
...and that the truth is not in me.

759
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:29,639
-The truth was never in me.
-No.

760
01:21:30,557 --> 01:21:32,684
This is something
that they're making you say.

761
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:34,853
Write this down.

762
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:37,063
Write it.

763
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,234
This...

764
01:21:43,987 --> 01:21:45,989
...is not a test.

765
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:50,493
I am not the prophet.

766
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,624
I never was the prophet.

767
01:22:30,575 --> 01:22:32,786
He told me that this was not a test.

768
01:22:33,411 --> 01:22:38,625
That he is not the prophet,
and that he never was.

769
01:22:44,297 --> 01:22:46,925
They're trying to kill him.

770
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:53,223
They're trying to kill our prophet.

771
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:09,906
That's why we must pray.

772
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:14,994
We must pray for the strength
of the prophet.

773
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:18,331
We can't let the apostates trick us.
That's what they want.

774
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:26,297
Yo, screw! Dumb-ass prophet
trying to off himself! Hey!

775
01:23:26,464 --> 01:23:30,468
Let us pray for Uncle Warren.

776
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:35,890
We beseech God...

777
01:23:37,142 --> 01:23:41,521
...to return the prophet Warren Jeffs
to his flock...

778
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:45,316
...for he is the one true prophet.

779
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:51,656
<i>As Warren Jeffs
serves out his life sentence...</i>

780
01:23:51,823 --> 01:23:55,035
<i>...police are continuing
their investigation...</i>

781
01:23:55,201 --> 01:23:58,580
<i>...of the isolated
Colorado City community...</i>

782
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:01,291
<i>...seeking out additional witnesses...</i>

783
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:04,294
<i>...in hopes of making more arrests.</i>

784
01:24:04,461 --> 01:24:06,296
<i>Police announced today--</i>

785
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:23,438
Did we pass, Uncle Warren?

786
01:24:34,574 --> 01:24:36,242
Anybody home?

787
01:24:40,997 --> 01:24:42,457
I believe we did.

788
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:46,127
Because the faithful,
we all knew that this was a test...

789
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:48,296
...even though you said it wasn't.

790
01:24:49,255 --> 01:24:55,053
We decided that you've been taken
from us because we're not worthy.

791
01:25:05,814 --> 01:25:08,483
How dare you come in here.

792
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:12,987
Get out of my house! Now! Get out!

793
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:56,781
You have passed this first test.

794
01:26:02,162 --> 01:26:04,497
Now listen to the revelation...

795
01:26:05,957 --> 01:26:09,294
...about what you all must do
to become worthy...
