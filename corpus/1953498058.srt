1
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:24,349
I could have sworn
I nailed him.

2
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:30,255
Did you see the rack
on that sucker?

3
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:34,293
You scared him,
but I hit him.

4
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:37,863
I know. I know.

5
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:38,897
You got him.

6
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:44,303
What?

7
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,237
I nailed the buck?

8
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,706
Dude, I knew it!

9
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:18,705
What?

10
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,915
You see him?

11
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,383
I don't see anything.

12
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,186
I don't see shit.
I just see the stump.

13
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:37,189
Past the stump.

14
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:43,195
It's your birthday.
I'm gmng him to you.

15
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,700
You still see him?

16
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,770
Had him a second ago.

17
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,642
You can have him.

18
00:02:56,644 --> 00:03:00,379
Being out here
with my big brother,

19
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:05,617
it's a pretty cool birthday.

20
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,290
Did you get him?

21
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,337
Oh, shit.

22
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,393
It's dick Cavanaugh.

23
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,029
You shot dick Cavanaugh.
Holy shit.

24
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,800
Just give me a second.
Let me think.

25
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:59,438
Is he dead?
Nate, what do we do?

26
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,406
Just give me a second
and let me think, okay?

27
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,876
Hey, dick,
you get that four-pointer,

28
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,546
you old son of a bitch?

29
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,881
This looks so bad, man.

30
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,483
I know.

31
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,689
Man, it's another beautiful
day here in guerneville.

32
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:21,560
77 degrees, from the back
of the post office here.

33
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,929
Looks like shorts
and t-shirt weather

34
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,766
is finally back
in the redwoods.

35
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,468
A reminder from pat Cavanaugh,

36
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,671
the annual Cavanaugh picnic
is coming up on the 23rd.

37
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:36,475
You can get your raffle tickets
at Cavanaugh's bait and tackle.

38
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,543
You don't want to miss out
on a chance

39
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,545
to light the Cavanaugh Cannon.

40
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,047
That sucker's loud.

41
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,950
Hey, Jamie.
Yip, yip, yip, yip.

42
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,719
- God damn.
- She's cute.

43
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,088
She's goddamn cute.

44
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,566
97.4 ktre, guerneville,

45
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:07,939
Rio nido, monte Rio,
where the river meets the trees.

46
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:13,612
Can't you shut the blinds?

47
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,948
Nope.

48
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,850
Okay...

49
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,389
Now, tell me again
what happened

50
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,624
after you shot the buck.

51
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,759
I was running, and...

52
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,828
- We were both...
- Skylar.

53
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,498
Let Nate tell it this time.

54
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,968
We were both running
after the deer.

55
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,038
He saw something and motioned
for me to stop.

56
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,076
And he got down on the ground,
and so did I.

57
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,777
Took aim and...

58
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,614
I didn't see what he saw, so...

59
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:53,385
He asked me what I saw.

60
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,556
Then he pulled the trigger.

61
00:05:57,558 --> 00:06:03,161
Skylar... you fired the shot

62
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,897
that killed dick Cavanaugh?

63
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,938
Yeah.

64
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,808
Yeah, I did.

65
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,684
Okay.

66
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:28,520
- It was an accident.
- I know.

67
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,122
You're acting like
you don't believe us.

68
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,656
Doesn't matter
what I believe.

69
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,958
He shot the mayor, he's dead.

70
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,961
But he's only 17.
They can't charge him.

71
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:42,000
Look, we have to do everything
by the book here.

72
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,609
Come on, kiddo.

73
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,148
This is bullshit!

74
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,884
Nate, this isn't
a family matter.

75
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,720
This is police business.
Just go home.

76
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:07,092
Go home. Go home!

77
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,057
You all right?

78
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,795
Yeah.

79
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,074
Hey, guys.

80
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,977
Hey, Jamie.
Is your mother home?

81
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,080
Uh, yeah.
She's on the computer.

82
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,748
My dad's not here.

83
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,286
Yeah, I know.

84
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,668
You okay?

85
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,031
It's Nate towne's truck.

86
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,167
Son of a bitch.

87
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:34,606
This... is for Uncle dick.

88
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,579
Oh, shit!

89
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,783
- Nate.
- What?

90
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:48,186
- That's my cousin.
- Yeah. He hit my truck.

91
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:52,757
He'll see us.

92
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,129
Nate!

93
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,865
Hey, it's the morning breeze

94
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,168
with your favorite
tree-hugging dj,

95
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:03,902
Mr. cool breeze.

96
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,605
That last one goes out
to all you cavanaughs

97
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,639
in your hard time.

98
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,708
My thoughts and prayers
are with you.

99
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,976
This one's for Eric Cavanaugh,

100
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,713
going out to his lady love,
marina, with a reminder...

101
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:20,285
Marina, baby, pick up some milk
on the way home.

102
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,655
Lloyd.

103
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,890
Jack.

104
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,204
Jack...

105
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:43,708
I am truly sorry
about your brother.

106
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,111
Brass tacks, bloom.

107
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,046
Melanie believes
there's motive.

108
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:51,049
Well,
with all due respect, Jack,

109
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,217
Melanie is in mourning.

110
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:56,254
Whole town's in mourning
for its mayor.

111
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,189
Yeah.

112
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,257
By the way...

113
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,260
I've noted that
skylar and Nate's deposition

114
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,196
was taken by their father.

115
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,266
Melanie is eager to see

116
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:12,037
that skylar is treated
as an adult.

117
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,174
He is 17 years old.

118
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:21,413
Everyone in this room knows
there's history here.

119
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:29,721
My boys know nothing
about that.

120
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:39,998
Dad? What's going on?

121
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,202
I brought you
some fresh clothes.

122
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,971
Are they... are they
charging me with something?

123
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,742
We've gotta let Jack
and Melanie do their thing.

124
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:54,746
Okay? We've gotta let things
cool down a little bit.

125
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:58,383
If you're innocent...
And I know that you are...

126
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:02,954
Everything's gonna be fine.

127
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,463
Hey, bloom. Food's almost up.

128
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,433
You want a cup of coffee
while you wait?

129
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,868
Sounds good.

130
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,073
You know, when there's
only one game in town,

131
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,475
sometimes it's best
just not to play.

132
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:02,046
It's taken me ten years
married to duffie Cavanaugh

133
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,816
to figure that one out.

134
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,820
I'll check on your food.

135
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:13,324
Would you like anything else?

136
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,998
Nate. Nate?

137
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,877
Where's skylar?

138
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,445
He's at the station.

139
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:39,017
They're gonna take him
to county at 4:00.

140
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:39,617
Why?

141
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,321
Because they want to try him
as an adult.

142
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,357
Try him for what?

143
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:51,162
They're gonna try him
for murder.

144
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,998
Can't you do something?

145
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,301
The last thing
skylar needs is for me

146
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,302
to be gumming everything up

147
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,103
by pulling strings
trying to get him out.

148
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,371
You think if the tables
were turned,

149
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,240
and it was a Cavanaugh
sitting in that cell...

150
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,408
- We're not cavanaughs!

151
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,442
How does that big thumb feel

152
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:09,013
pressing down on your head?

153
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:13,117
Eat your hamburger.

154
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,165
That too tight?

155
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,969
No. I'm okay.

156
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,676
You want to grab a beer?

157
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,678
I thought you were on duty.

158
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,582
Yeah.
I just figured I'd watch.

159
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,551
Well, I'm gonna
get home early,

160
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,621
so I can get out to Santa rosa
for the arraignment.

161
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:01,192
Here, sign this.

162
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:08,433
- It's your report.
- Yeah.

163
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,307
I was over
at Randy's house last night.

164
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,077
I'm five minutes late,
brought the wrong kind of beer.

165
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,144
He chewed me out
for 20 minutes.

166
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,681
Hey, this guy's pretty close.
He's on my ass.

167
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,317
- Shit, he rammed us!
- Watch out! Watch out!

168
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,485
He's coming around the side.

169
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,454
Watch the road, man! Stay left!

170
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,555
Watch that tree!
Hit the brakes!

171
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:34,125
Oh, shit, we're going over!

172
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,327
Oh, my God!

173
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,465
Don't move. Nobody move.

174
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,741
Oh. Hey, Lloyd.

175
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,343
- Tom, Guthrie.
- Officer.

176
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,046
Why don't you boys
drink your beer in the bar

177
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,714
like everybody else?

178
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:57,648
You know it's a ticket.

179
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,352
Well, it is a beautiful,
sunshiny day.

180
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,720
It is lovely outside
today, isn't it?

181
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:07,525
Plus, bloom usually
just gives us a warning, so...

182
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,361
You've already been warned.

183
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,663
Oh, come on.

184
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,199
What?

185
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,300
Hey, Lloyd, we got a report

186
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,269
of an accident
up by the rock quarry.

187
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,671
Can you go check it out?

188
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,606
All right, I'm on it.

189
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,241
Come on, Lloyd,
don't give us a ticket.

190
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:27,045
We're family, man.
The law's the law, tom.

191
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:32,183
Family doesn't change that.
Have a nice day.

192
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,651
Give me the fucking keys!

193
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:37,388
You're digging yourself
the deepest hole, kid.

194
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,424
You want to talk
about deep holes?

195
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:42,527
Look down.

196
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,297
- Come on!
- Okay, okay, here.

197
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,269
- Don't rock it.
- Come on, get out.

198
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,104
- Watch it.
- Come on, get out!

199
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,572
- Nate?
- Shh.

200
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,840
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

201
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,809
What the hell
are you doing, man?

202
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,844
Trust me,
you're already screwed.

203
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:03,381
- Just don't rock the van.
- Hey, shut up!

204
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,420
- Hold on.
- Wait!

205
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,190
Shit. No!

206
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:40,818
Run. Run. Come on!

207
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,592
Nate, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

208
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,227
A bunch of bullshit
is going down.

209
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:54,198
I had to do something.
Give me your hands.

210
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,370
Now what the fuck
are we gonna do?

211
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:02,140
We'll go to Uncle Mike's.

212
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:07,178
Easy. Easy.

213
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,314
The last thing I want to do
is hurt you boys.

214
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,150
You know that.

215
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,652
Skylar, I want you
to hand me that pistol...

216
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,288
By the barrel, real slow.

217
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,524
Take your mask off, Nate.

218
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:23,261
Take your mask off, Nate.

219
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,367
All right, what happened
to those two deputies?

220
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,702
They're gone.
They kept going.

221
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:36,574
Probably in Santa rosa
by now, dumb fucks.

222
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,611
All right, I want you
to put these on,

223
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:46,350
one on each of you.

224
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,594
Get out of the car.

225
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:57,828
What were you thinking?

226
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,633
Huh? You trying to convince
everybody you're guilty?

227
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,268
They're already convinced.

228
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,270
Not me. I've been trying
to give you boys

229
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,205
the benefit of the doubt.

230
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,674
But you're making it
really difficult.

231
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,476
Innocent people don't bust out
of a police van

232
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:18,216
before they've even been tried.

233
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,284
Nate!

234
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,380
Come on, we gotta jump.

235
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:53,951
Come on, sky, you can do it.

236
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,301
- Hello?
- Bloom...

237
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,903
We got a big problem.

238
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,001
Hey, Lloyd,

239
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,703
where the hell are you?

240
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:48,773
The phones are going nuts
down here.

241
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,784
Looks like he's home.

242
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:04,722
I don't know if this
is such a good idea.

243
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,691
What if he calls dad?

244
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:12,096
Mike doesn't have a phone.

245
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,704
Aah!

246
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,572
Looking for a 20

247
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:24,775
on Lloyd or bloom.

248
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,724
Oh, shit.

249
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,904
Come on, help me.

250
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,584
Ow!

251
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:09,153
- Unh!
- Ow! Ow.

252
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,596
It's open.

253
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,868
I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

254
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,169
What's the occasion?

255
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,938
It's not my birthday again,
is it?

256
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,806
Nope.

257
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,175
I'm looking for Nate
and skylar.

258
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,810
You seen 'em?

259
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,178
I haven't seen 'em,
but if I do,

260
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,417
I'll let 'em know
that you're looking for 'em.

261
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,751
If they're here, Mike,

262
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,889
it's important
that you tell me.

263
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:48,459
Dick Cavanaugh's dead.

264
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,831
Are they here?

265
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,900
How many you got out there?

266
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,001
Just Lloyd.

267
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:59,737
The man who knew too much.
What a fuck.

268
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:03,441
Well, that's all water
under the bridge now.

269
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,744
Maybe under your bridge,
bloom.

270
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:12,450
Sarah is still dead.

271
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,946
Come on up out of there.

272
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,996
You guys all right?

273
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:02,199
Yeah, we're fine.

274
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,271
Lloyd Cavanaugh.

275
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:12,610
Well... this is
certainly an honor.

276
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:13,544
Michael Spencer.

277
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:16,547
I see you're still
digging foxholes

278
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,982
out in your front yard.

279
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,683
Waiting for world war III?

280
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,185
Lloyd, I asked you
to stay in the car.

281
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:25,656
Yeah, I just wanted
to make sure everything's okay.

282
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,092
- I got this.
- Good.

283
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:31,562
Let's take these boys down
to the station, then, huh?

284
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:35,199
You're not taking anybody
anywhere.

285
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,269
Lloyd, just go wait
in the car.

286
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,738
I've got this under control.

287
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,743
YOU DON'T HAVE<i>ANYTHING</i>
UNDER CONTROL.

288
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:49,914
Look, Mike... I get it.

289
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:53,284
You're still pissed,
and you have every right to be.

290
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,052
Dad, what's he talking about?

291
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,254
Never mind, just, uh...
Go get in the car.

292
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,723
We'll talk about it
on the way back to town.

293
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,093
Boys, it's up to you.

294
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:08,032
Sometimes fighting
can put you in jail...

295
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,334
Sometimes it can keep you out.

296
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:13,237
We're not going to jail.

297
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,672
Look, I'm taking the boys
outside,

298
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,140
and I'll wait for you, okay?

299
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:19,677
Back off, Cavanaugh.

300
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,314
Lloyd, get outside!

301
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:25,916
Nate, skylar, run!

302
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,652
Mike!

303
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,975
Nate! Nate!

304
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,811
Skylar!

305
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,661
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

306
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:13,430
Put your seat belt back on.

307
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,335
I don't want to sound outside
the bounds of the law.

308
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:22,673
It's not as if I'm suggesting
a... a posse or something.

309
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:26,076
Getting a conviction
is not gonna be a problem.

310
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,078
I can hang a homicide
on both boys

311
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,946
for the deputies alone.

312
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:32,216
I'm not talking
about the courts anymore.

313
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:38,188
I think we both know why towne
might want to hurt dick.

314
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,926
I think justice needs
to be served for dick.

315
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,195
It's the situation with bloom...

316
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:48,165
- Bloom towne's not a problem.

317
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,734
Randy.

318
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,470
I'm so glad you're here.

319
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:57,941
Sit down. Good to see you.

320
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,743
Let me sit down there.

321
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:04,715
Now, bloom may be a fool,
but he knows his place.

322
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:09,153
And, Jack, we're gonna need
a little interference

323
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:11,955
down at the county courthouse.

324
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,291
It's not a problem.

325
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,492
Talked to Donald
a few minutes ago.

326
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,462
Said he's gonna try
to buy us a couple days.

327
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:22,199
This is a family issue now.

328
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,169
That's how we'll treat it.

329
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:31,742
It's not working.

330
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:33,811
What are you doing?

331
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,914
Gotta take a piss.

332
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,990
- Dude.
- Sorry.

333
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,001
What the hell
was Mike talking about?

334
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,938
What do you mean?

335
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,943
He was going on and on,
like Lloyd did something.

336
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,145
Hell if I know.

337
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:12,349
You know what Mike was like.

338
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,529
We gotta go back.

339
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:28,165
We gotta talk to dad.

340
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,067
Fuck that.

341
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:33,403
We gotta turn ourselves in.

342
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,440
What are we doing?
Where are we going?

343
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,276
What are... what are you gonna do
with that?

344
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,545
Remember mom's friend
jacylin?

345
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:43,514
The one in Canada?

346
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,949
She always said
she'd do anything for mom.

347
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,118
Canada's, like,
a thousand Miles from here.

348
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,555
Yeah, that's the point.
The farther the better.

349
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,390
Skylar, they were gonna
try you as an adult.

350
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:56,226
If I hadn't busted you out,
you'd be fucked now.

351
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:59,429
Totally fucked.
Just like Uncle Mike!

352
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,901
So what do we do?

353
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:08,071
We get to cloverdale,
hop a freight train to humboldt.

354
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,908
A freight train?

355
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,143
Okay... we steal a car.

356
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,913
Or, no.
What was that lady's name?

357
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,514
The one that dad did
a couple times,

358
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,817
with the big tits?

359
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:20,217
Susan?

360
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:23,187
Yeah. Remember, she took us
fishing on her boat?

361
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,288
400-mile range?

362
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,323
Boat, head up the coast
to Vancouver.

363
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,092
Stop for gas a couple times,
and boom, we're home free!

364
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:32,129
- Keys are in the flower pot.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you, Susan.

365
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:35,465
You'll find your boat
in Vancouver harbor.

366
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:41,405
- Hey, Jenny, anything yet?
- Nothing yet.

367
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:44,274
Thanks.

368
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,281
You get that filled out yet?

369
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:55,886
I'll take care of it.

370
00:30:55,888 --> 00:31:00,524
You don't need to stay, Randy.

371
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:06,630
Listen to me, bloom. Okay?

372
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:09,166
Okay.

373
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:12,402
I imagine you're wondering
what you can do

374
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,271
to help your boys.

375
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:17,374
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

376
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:21,245
But you've got a dilemma.

377
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:25,983
A conflict of interest.
Correct?

378
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:29,253
You know, I don't know
if I'd call it that.

379
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:33,690
You've got two cop killers
out there

380
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,159
that just happen to be
your sons.

381
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:39,263
The details are sketchy.

382
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:42,165
You've got
a serious conflict here.

383
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,166
You understand?

384
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,302
You know, you could
look at is as though

385
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:51,208
we both have
a serious conflict here.

386
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,545
- Really?
- Yeah.

387
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:04,988
You know, you've done
all right by us, bloom.

388
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:12,462
I'm sure you'll do
the right thing here.

389
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:18,702
Get me that report
by the end of the day.

390
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,237
Whoa!

391
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,412
What do we do?

392
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:07,551
Now. Go!

393
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:24,368
Shit. Is that Lloyd?

394
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:29,639
Hey, Nate, did I get you?

395
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,411
Joel? Is that you?

396
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,713
Yeah. It's me and Tony.

397
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,382
You gotta be kidding me.

398
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:40,017
It's Joel Cavanaugh.

399
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,351
What?

400
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,687
What's your problem, dude?

401
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,355
You guys killed my Uncle.

402
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,624
My dad says it's open season
on you two.

403
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:50,193
You know that your dad's
an asshole, right?

404
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,562
Hey, what about yours?
I don't see him out here

405
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:53,530
doing you any favors!

406
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,465
- Come here.
- What?

407
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,199
Take this.

408
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,736
So you thought
just you and Tony

409
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:02,372
could take us out alone?

410
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,573
You're high.

411
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:07,177
Who says we came alone?

412
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:11,381
They're bluffing.

413
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,716
You want to give up?

414
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:16,420
Yeah, right. Suck it!

415
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,829
Give me an arrow.

416
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,637
Are you fucking kidding me?

417
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:42,579
Bows and arrows?

418
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:43,180
Aah!

419
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:46,483
Get me back, you fucker!
Oh, God!

420
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:47,217
Son of a bitch!

421
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,652
I'm gonna kill you now!
Nice shot.

422
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,353
Dude! Dude,
what are you doing?

423
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:53,690
Where are you going?

424
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,592
You stupid pussy!

425
00:34:55,594 --> 00:35:00,397
I have the keys.

426
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,235
Hey, Nate?

427
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:05,869
Yeah.

428
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:11,241
I think I'm gonna die
if you leave me here.

429
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,381
You fucking assholes!

430
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,518
You shot first.

431
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Holy shit, Joel.

432
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:26,556
Where'd you get an m16?

433
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,258
My dad's.

434
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,261
And a grenade?

435
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:34,664
It's just tear gas.

436
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:41,204
Tony really stood by you.
Friends till the end, huh?

437
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,706
Carry me.

438
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,541
Carry me back.
Are you kidding?

439
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,910
How am I supposed to get back?
I can't fucking walk!

440
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,278
You should have thought
of that

441
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,446
before you came out here,
dipshit!

442
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:51,648
Let's get these things off.

443
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,519
One, two, three!

444
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:57,487
Aw, fuck!

445
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,955
You literally couldn't hit

446
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:01,491
a fuckin' elephant
at point blank.

447
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,227
Shut your face, Joel.

448
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:06,429
Retard.

449
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:09,533
You think I can't
hit you from here?

450
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:10,567
Okay.

451
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,736
I will blow your head
clean off!

452
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,504
Okay. Come on, dude,
I was just fucking with you.

453
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,439
One more dead Cavanaugh
doesn't mean shit to me!

454
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,709
Come on, man, I was just
fucking kidding with you.

455
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:20,610
Nate, come on.

456
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,779
Nate, come on.

457
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,447
Let's get the cuffs off.

458
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,424
Tony, I'm over here. Come on.

459
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,896
Nate, get the cuffs off.
Get 'em off.

460
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:40,530
Okay.

461
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,865
Here, let me do it this time.

462
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:42,966
- I got it.
- Let me do it.

463
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:46,937
I got it! Ready?

464
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:47,704
Yeah.

465
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,273
Turn your head away. Ready?

466
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:54,644
Oh... aw, shit, it's empty.

467
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,481
Nate! You shot Joel.

468
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:02,519
He's bleeding really bad, man.
That's fucked up.

469
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:05,488
Okay, take it easy, Tony.

470
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,990
Put the gun down.

471
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:09,292
Put the gun down, Tony.
You know I'll shoot.

472
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:13,797
Okay, all right,
we're gonna do it together.

473
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:16,833
Ready? On the count of three.

474
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,803
One, two...

475
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:23,406
Finger off the trigger.

476
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,976
Three.

477
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,915
Okay. Okay. Okay.

478
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,317
You guys are
in so much trouble.

479
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,520
Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,489
- Unh!
- Uhh!

481
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:45,662
Shit. Tony!

482
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:50,333
Tony, you all right?
Unh. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

483
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:46,890
This is Ronnie.

484
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:51,895
You got your ears on, Eric?

485
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,396
I just pissed away
the last of my beer.

486
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:59,069
You got anything to drink
in the shit bucket of yours?

487
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:01,438
Well, I'm gonna run into town
and grab something.

488
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,605
You want anything?

489
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:03,840
That's bullshit, dude.

490
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,475
Randy's gonna filet your balls.

491
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:10,613
He said don't move
till he tells us otherwise.

492
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,349
What are we even
doing out here, man?

493
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,918
I mean, you really think
Nate and skylar meant

494
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,154
to kill dick... on purpose?

495
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,789
Come on.

496
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:23,393
Two words... filet... balls.

497
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,024
What the fuck, man?

498
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,026
This is my Uncle's
fuckin' truck,

499
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,161
you fuckin' shithead!

500
00:39:58,163 --> 00:39:59,764
I return this thing
with a scratch on it,

501
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:03,566
he's gonna kick the shit
out of me.

502
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:12,909
All right, bitch.

503
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:21,551
Here ya go.

504
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,790
Damn it!

505
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,471
Damn, that dude's fast.

506
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:45,708
Shit.

507
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,579
That's Eric's truck.
That's Ronnie.

508
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:51,614
What are they doing?

509
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,816
All right, a sixer
of cold ones

510
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:54,484
if you can take the bottle
off my head.

511
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,686
Twelver for me if you can't.

512
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:59,556
You're on, dipshit.

513
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,696
Yeah!

514
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:07,597
Nice!

515
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,866
- Two out of three.
- No way, dude.

516
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:11,100
- Yeah, way.
- Get out there.

517
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,936
Ken, get that can on his head.

518
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:14,737
- No way.
- Rules are rules.

519
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:18,074
Two out of three.

520
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,042
You're a dick, man.

521
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:20,543
You aim low,
I'm seriously gonna

522
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,212
kick the shit our of you...
You know that, right?

523
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:23,246
Don't distract me, man.

524
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,915
How you gonna kick anybody's ass
if you don't have a head?

525
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:28,785
Hey, wait a second, wait,
wait, wait, Ronnie, turn around.

526
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:29,953
You're not getting out
of this.

527
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:33,056
- Keys! Keys! Keys!
- Nate and skylar.

528
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:34,224
Hey!

529
00:41:34,226 --> 00:41:35,225
Dude, that's my truck.

530
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:37,093
They're gonna steal it.

531
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:41,197
They're not goin' anywhere.

532
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,068
Aw, shit! Come on.

533
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:50,874
Who the hell is that?

534
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:54,644
Shit, dude.

535
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:57,146
My bad!

536
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,615
Did you see Larry go down?

537
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:02,051
- You think he's okay?
- Who cares?

538
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:44,594
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

539
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,746
20 on the towne boys
is 5 to 1.

540
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,316
Nah, 20 on Randy.

541
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:50,026
You were jackin' off,
God damn it!

542
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:50,994
You were jackin' off,

543
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:53,830
and those fuckin' towne
shitheads got away!

544
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:57,967
You, you dumb fuck, come here.

545
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,902
Look what the fuck
they did to Larry!

546
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,004
Look at him! Huh?

547
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,305
WHAT THE <i>FUCK</i>
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

548
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:05,274
What kind of shithead are you?

549
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,143
All of you.

550
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,713
They killed dick.
They killed two cops.

551
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:12,749
Now they fucked Larry up.
And what are you doing?

552
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,751
You're out here playing,
what, William tell?

553
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,753
You heard me at the house.

554
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:20,823
These boys do not need
to come back with us.

555
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:21,858
I thought I was clear.

556
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:28,431
We're not out here
to suck each other's cocks.

557
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:32,468
Fuck. Ronnie?

558
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,903
Don't worry, I got it.

559
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,838
Okay, that's better.

560
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,974
Now, you got
two teenage boys out there

561
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,410
making you all look
like a bunch of idiots.

562
00:44:40,412 --> 00:44:41,778
If they reach the county line,

563
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,946
<i>I'M</i> GONNA LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT!

564
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:45,114
You understand?

565
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:48,017
Well, stop looking at me.
Go get 'em, God damn it.

566
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:52,755
Hurry the fuck up!
Move! Do some-fuckin'-thing!

567
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:56,325
Jesus.

568
00:44:56,327 --> 00:45:00,229
Lloyd,
fuckin' get Larry some help.

569
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,130
In the paper today,

570
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:04,267
I see that Donald Cavanaugh's
gerrymandering case

571
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:05,835
came to a close yesterday,

572
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:08,504
which means we've got
a new congressman.

573
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:11,274
Congrats, Donald.
Fishing season is here,

574
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:14,110
so here's a reminder
from our chief of police,

575
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:15,311
bloomfield towne...

576
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:16,846
Fishing off our Bridges is...

577
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:19,082
- Hey, Travis, you still
up on sterrit hill?

578
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:21,284
- Yeah.
- You seen Ronnie?

579
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:22,151
I lost track of him.

580
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:24,053
They're headed west
along pocket canyon.

581
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,022
They're right behind
the towne boys.

582
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:28,091
- No shit.
- Yeah.

583
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,195
Randy says don't bother
bringing 'em back alive.

584
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:36,933
You wanna get a beer later?

585
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:04,220
If you could eat anything,

586
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:06,622
what would you have right now?

587
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:10,359
Mmm...

588
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:13,596
Mom's spaghetti.

589
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:12,388
This is Travis.
We're up at elephant Ridge.

590
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,290
The towne boys are down
below us in the canyon,

591
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:15,658
but we can't get down there
from here.

592
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,560
We gotta go around.
Anyone closer?

593
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:22,565
Uh, yeah.
I'm with Ronnie, we're on it.

594
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:08,110
How far do you think
we've got? Unh!

595
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:11,280
Maybe 12 Miles.

596
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:15,651
Boat had a bed underneath,
didn't it?

597
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,991
Yeah, and a little kitchen.
Hold up.

598
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,433
Dude, we gotta get going.

599
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:35,438
They're probably
right behind us.

600
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,639
It's all right.

601
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:41,010
It took us, like, 15 minutes
to cross that canyon.

602
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:45,514
What about the next Ridge?

603
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:52,655
What are we gonna do now?

604
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,791
We keep going.

605
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:58,227
Ow! Fuck!

606
00:49:58,229 --> 00:49:59,462
Oh, sorry, man.

607
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:07,470
Where the fuck is dad?

608
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,374
Dad's a pussy.

609
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:14,176
They could parade us around town
on a couple of spikes,

610
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:18,314
he still wouldn't give a shit.

611
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:23,652
How come he's such a pussy...
Since mom died?

612
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:28,491
What the fuck happened to him?

613
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:35,798
Come on,
we gotta get out of here.

614
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:40,436
You know what Uncle Mike
was talking about, don't you?

615
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:41,670
They're coming, dude.

616
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:45,708
I don't care. Tell me.

617
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,575
Fuck it.

618
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:50,613
It was dick that hit mom's car.

619
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:54,083
- What?
- He hit it with his car.

620
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:56,652
Drunk.
He passed out at the wheel.

621
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:57,853
Dad and Lloyd found the wreck.

622
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,255
There was no way
dick was gonna do time,

623
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:01,424
so dad filed it
as a hit and run.

624
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:04,126
Bullshit.

625
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:09,098
Why do you think dad
made chief so easily?

626
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:14,103
Dad covered up mom's killing,
so he could be chief?

627
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,441
Basically.

628
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:22,645
No. No fucking way.

629
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:28,317
Fuck.

630
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,653
Got it?
Come on, we gotta move.

631
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:33,189
Why didn't you tell me?

632
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:34,757
Uncle Mike made me promise
not to tell.

633
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:38,561
Uncle Mike told you,
and you weren't gonna tell me?

634
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:40,729
He was gonna do something.

635
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:45,401
He was gonna get dick back,
and then...

636
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:49,905
What? And then what, Nate?

637
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:51,807
He was gonna do it anyway.

638
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:55,845
Do what?
Just fucking tell me!

639
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:06,689
You knew it was him.

640
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:09,825
You knew it was dick
in the woods.

641
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:12,862
Oh, my God, you saw him.

642
00:52:12,864 --> 00:52:15,464
You let me tell everyone
I did it.

643
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,166
What the fuck, Nate?

644
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,734
I didn't plan it, skylar!

645
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,503
I saw him,
and I pulled the trigger.

646
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:21,804
I didn't even really
think about it.

647
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,172
You didn't think about it,

648
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:26,375
and you let me take the blame!

649
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,144
I told you not to.

650
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:30,779
That's why you busted me out,
because you felt guilty?

651
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:33,916
I busted you out
because neither of us deserves

652
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:36,752
to go to jail
for dick Cavanaugh!

653
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:39,421
I sure as hell don't!

654
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:41,524
Fuck this! I'm starving.

655
00:52:41,526 --> 00:52:43,526
Oh, skylar, do you even know
where you're going?

656
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:44,860
We have to stick to the plan,
remember?

657
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:46,395
We have to head west
to the coast.

658
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:47,897
You took me hunting
on my birthday

659
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:49,698
to use me as an alibi
for murder.

660
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,967
I swear to God, dude!

661
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,269
I thought it was a buck!

662
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:54,870
I got it in my sights,
saw it was dick,

663
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:55,971
and I pulled the trigger.

664
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:59,375
He killed mom,
and he got away with it!

665
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:02,945
What don't you
fucking understand?

666
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:06,649
Dude, nothing has changed.

667
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:11,253
We can still make it
to the boat.

668
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:20,229
- Oh, yeah.
- Here we go.

669
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:24,233
That's bloom.

670
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,772
Go talk to him.

671
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:30,906
Don't tell me what to do.

672
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,709
Yeah, you'll do it,
won't you?

673
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:34,310
Exactly.

674
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:35,945
I'll stick this bottle
up your ass, dude,

675
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:39,949
and you'll like it.

676
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,319
Hey, bloom, what's happening?

677
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,588
- You're happening, Guthrie.
- Thanks.

678
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,689
What's with the roadblock?

679
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:50,759
Oh, we're not supposed
to let you go by.

680
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:51,827
Yeah? Just me?

681
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:54,363
Yeah, um, pretty much.
No offense.

682
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:58,534
Randy told us, you know,
most likely you'd be coming by,

683
00:53:58,536 --> 00:54:00,536
and we're definitely
supposed to stop you.

684
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:01,804
You got room to turn around?

685
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:05,507
- Yeah, probably do.
- Okay, good.

686
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:08,010
- That's tom's Camaro.
- Uh-huh.

687
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:11,413
Yeah, that's his baby.
Randy specifically said

688
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,315
that we're supposed to stop you
from going past.

689
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:15,784
Hey, halt! Stop. Come on.

690
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:18,787
Stop! Whoa! Shit! God damn it.

691
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:20,522
Dude, what are you doing?

692
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:21,924
I mean, I would have
shot your tires out

693
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,759
if I could've got my stupid gun

694
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,694
out of my pants.

695
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:29,531
Well, I guess
I'll just go home.

696
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:31,834
You guys have
all the roads blocked, huh?

697
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:33,502
Yeah. You know,

698
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,671
we're just kinda circling
skylar and Nate

699
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:37,573
up on, uh, moscow road.

700
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:40,276
Got 'em...

701
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:42,411
- Okay.

702
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:43,479
Well, you stay warm, Guthrie.

703
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:46,649
And if you're gonna drive,
don't drink too much, okay?

704
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:49,318
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

705
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,486
Thanks, bloom.

706
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:51,787
Shit ain't funny, bloom!

707
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,522
- Later, bloom.
- Back it on up.

708
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:55,524
- What'd he say?
- Nothin' much. He's cool.

709
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:57,059
- Nothin' much?
- Yeah, he's cool.

710
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:59,728
Couldn't stop him...

711
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,599
My gun got stuck. You guys
could've done something.

712
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:07,403
Just chill out, man.
Everything's fine.

713
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,381
It's a nice day out.
Maybe he's gonna...

714
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:20,416
- Shut up.

715
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:24,486
What are you doing, bloom?

716
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,493
Huh?

717
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,095
I think he...
Think he's gotta pee.

718
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:35,964
Dude, he's definitely got...
He's peeing.

719
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:38,534
He's messing with us
is what he's doing.

720
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:44,139
Hey. Bloom?

721
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:45,808
Bloom?

722
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,010
Officer bloom?
You guys check over there.

723
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,778
- Yeah.
- I don't see him.

724
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,380
He's gotta be here.
Where else would he be?

725
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:53,749
I don't know, but Randy said
if some shit like this happens,

726
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:54,616
we gotta shoot him.

727
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:56,919
He's a fuckin' cop.
We're gonna shoot him?

728
00:55:56,921 --> 00:56:00,823
I'm pretty sure
Randy knows that.

729
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:07,663
Hey, skylar, you can't
just pull me around, man.

730
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:08,497
Bullshit.

731
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,766
You pulled me into this,
and I didn't know shit!

732
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:12,868
Now I'm gonna go get
some fucking food

733
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:17,539
and get
these fucking cuffs off!

734
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,444
COME <i>ON!</i>

735
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:30,085
What took you so long?
I'm starving.

736
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:32,554
Take it easy. Take it easy!

737
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,757
No!

738
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:36,125
We're not here to hurt you.

739
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:41,163
Just be cool, and everything
will be all right, okay?

740
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:46,034
They're in the old cerini
house up on greenwalt road.

741
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:47,536
We're outside.
What should we do?

742
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:50,139
Just don't let 'em go.
I'm on my way.

743
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:51,740
And stop saying where you are.

744
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,943
Radio silence from now on.
That goes for everybody.

745
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,687
Fuck!

746
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:07,656
What's your name?

747
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,691
Roroberta.

748
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:11,927
Roberta, why don't you have
any food?

749
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,228
Where's your food?

750
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,532
I'mi'm waiting
for my fiance.

751
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:17,466
He's getting pizza.

752
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:19,902
He'll be here any minute,
I swear.

753
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:22,805
Do you have a hacksaw
or an axe or anything?

754
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:23,906
No. I don't know.

755
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:25,707
Doesn't your boyfriend
have a toolbox?

756
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:26,975
Anything? Nothing?
You have nothing?

757
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:32,781
We don't live here.
It's just a vacation rental.

758
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:36,084
There's nothing.

759
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:40,656
Fuck this shit.
Let's get out of here.

760
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,161
Hey, we got the place
surrounded... they're inside.

761
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:49,064
No! No!

762
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:52,100
- Where are the car keys, lady?
- Nate, easy.

763
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,670
Where are the keys?
Where are the car keys?

764
00:57:54,672 --> 00:58:01,009
- What do we need keys for?
- We need a car, man.

765
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:03,545
- Where are they?
- On the sofa.

766
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:05,547
Lady, would you please,
just...

767
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:10,018
Oh, my... seriously?

768
00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:24,766
Go!

769
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:38,981
Go! Go, go, go, go!

770
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:43,118
Come on, skylar, come on!

771
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,934
Come on, sky.

772
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:14,650
Nate, grenade. The grenade.

773
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:17,619
Oh, shit.

774
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,291
Go to the right.
Go to the right.

775
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,084
Come on.

776
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:30,252
You can give 'em a head start,

777
01:01:30,254 --> 01:01:33,355
but you know
what's gonna happen.

778
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:35,957
Randy ain't gonna quit.

779
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:36,925
We'll find 'em.

780
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:38,193
I'm gonna turn around
now, Lloyd.

781
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,028
I don't believe you're gonna
shoot me in the back,

782
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:46,101
but if you feel you need to,
go ahead.

783
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,947
What the fuck you doing,
Lloyd?

784
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:00,916
It's bloom.

785
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:05,187
You have a shot?

786
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:11,460
You had a shot,
and you let towne go?

787
01:02:11,462 --> 01:02:13,829
All right, Eric,
you're drmng.

788
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:16,498
What's the next road down
from here?

789
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,866
- Fullam.
- All right.

790
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:19,501
Get the boys together.

791
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:22,070
I want fullam road covered.

792
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,806
You're a moron.

793
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,952
What's going on?

794
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:54,996
Let's take five.

795
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:58,466
Chopper will spot 'em
before we ever do anyway.

796
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:01,403
What is it, Saturday?

797
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:02,270
- Yep.
- Yep.

798
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:04,072
There goes
the fuckin' weekend, huh?

799
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:06,174
I wish somebody'd put these
fuckers out of their misery.

800
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,944
You know? That's the only way
this is gonna end.

801
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:11,213
Let's just get it
over with already.

802
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:14,316
I'd rather be out here
than at the gas station any day.

803
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:16,952
Get ahold
of those two little maggots

804
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:18,253
and rip their little heads off.

805
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:19,421
Give me one of those bagels.

806
01:04:19,423 --> 01:04:21,423
I'm gonna string 'em up
like mussolini,

807
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:22,157
by their balls.

808
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:25,260
Shave their bodies, strap 'em
to the hood of my car

809
01:04:25,262 --> 01:04:26,528
like a couple of trophies,

810
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,997
drive around town
till their bodies rot off.

811
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:34,636
That's fucked up.
Can I get a juice box?

812
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,406
Shit, skip,
you got any more bagels?

813
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:41,910
No, man, that's it.

814
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,249
Holy shit!

815
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:50,485
Get my gun! Get 'em!

816
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,021
Services begin at 11:00

817
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:53,922
and continue all day.

818
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:55,423
The spaghetti feed
in dick's honor...

819
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:57,993
Will be hosted
by dick's brother Randy

820
01:04:57,995 --> 01:04:59,961
at the town hall at 6:00.

821
01:04:59,963 --> 01:05:05,066
Okay, you're listening
to the morning breeze...

822
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:57,118
You're a fucking asshole, man.
I hope you know that.

823
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,253
If we ever get these cuffs off,

824
01:05:58,255 --> 01:05:59,521
I'm gonna kick
your fucking ass!

825
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:01,156
See,
that's why I didn't tell you.

826
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:02,490
You don't get it.
Get it-what?

827
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:06,494
You know what they did,
and you're still mad at me.

828
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:11,266
You're the asshole!

829
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:12,334
You're unbelievable, man.

830
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:14,436
You hate dad so much,
but you're just like him.

831
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:15,770
You let the cavanaughs
ruin your life.

832
01:06:15,772 --> 01:06:17,405
That's bullshit, skylar,
and you know it.

833
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:22,711
You're bullshit, and now
you're just as bad as them.

834
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:45,200
Easy. Get up.

835
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:48,570
Turn around real slowly.

836
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:52,374
Come on, towne.

837
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:03,485
You're sloppy, towne.

838
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:06,421
You're a sloppy cop
and a sloppy outlaw.

839
01:07:06,423 --> 01:07:08,490
That chopper spotted you
on the first pass.

840
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:13,061
I'm no outlaw.
I'm just here for my boys.

841
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:15,196
I'm gonna count to three...

842
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,631
And I want you
to drop your gun.

843
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:20,135
Randy, you know
I can't walk away from this.

844
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:25,106
You've done it before.
You're good at it.

845
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:26,508
Yeah.

846
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:30,311
One...

847
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:36,317
You punk. Three.

848
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,819
Aah!

849
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:01,643
Randy.

850
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,653
Fuck.

851
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,643
If you're having a hard time

852
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:37,879
hearing the breeze
this morning,

853
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:38,813
you are not alone.

854
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:43,852
We got a low-flying chopper
buzzing the neighborhood.

855
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:26,327
We're gonna have
to cross the river again.

856
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:27,595
No, fuck that.
They'll see us.

857
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:28,863
We gotta get to the barn.

858
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:31,332
No, fuck that, man.
We gotta keep going.

859
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,668
We can cross right there.

860
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,370
- We're not crossing the river.
- Skylar, come on.

861
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:36,471
There's someone over there.

862
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:37,705
We're not going over there.

863
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:38,606
Skylar, come on.

864
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:42,877
What the fuck is going on?
Who's over there?

865
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:45,280
Let's go, skylar.

866
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:48,683
Nate?

867
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:51,219
What is that?

868
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:53,922
Hey. Yeah, it's me.

869
01:09:53,924 --> 01:09:55,223
We're just across the river.

870
01:09:55,225 --> 01:10:00,461
We'll be there
in a minute, okay?

871
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:01,863
I can't believe
this is happening.

872
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:05,867
You had a fucking phone?

873
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:07,368
Jamie's coming with us.

874
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,771
- What?
- She loves me.

875
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:11,005
She wants to come.

876
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:12,507
No. Bullshit!

877
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:15,410
We're not going over there.
This is bullshit!

878
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:16,578
- Skylar.
- Nate!

879
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,579
Listen to me!

880
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:20,915
We're not going anywhere
if you don't cross that bridge.

881
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:26,020
I'll just sit down.

882
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:27,388
You fucker.

883
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,958
She's got a car.

884
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,927
Shit!

885
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,299
Damn it! Get down!

886
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,067
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

887
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:17,805
She screwed us, Nate.
She fuckin' screwed us.

888
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,311
Okay, sky, we're going over.
Come on, man.

889
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:25,880
- No! No!
- We're going over.

890
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:28,349
What the fuck are you doing?

891
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:31,519
- Put your arms up.
- What the fuck are you doing?

892
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:33,354
Fuck no!

893
01:11:33,356 --> 01:11:35,590
We are not gmng up!

894
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:37,558
I know you think
I fucked you over, man,

895
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,726
but you gotta trust me.

896
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:41,929
They're not gonna let us
off this bridge alive.

897
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:44,699
All right, wait here.

898
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:47,669
- Hey! I said hold your fire.
- Come on.

899
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:50,672
Come on, sky. You can do it.

900
01:11:50,674 --> 01:11:52,407
We have to.

901
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:57,345
Skylar, Nate, no!

902
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:04,385
We've got to, sky.
We don't have a choice, skylar.

903
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:22,737
Right here?

904
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:34,082
The truck's here.
Let's go, come on.

905
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:37,385
You see that?

906
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:45,393
Been down there a long time.

907
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,464
No way they made that.

908
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:53,668
Check the other side?
They're gone.

909
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,119
Look, there. Right there.

910
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:17,024
Come on, guys, let's go.
Come on.

911
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:28,202
Hey, this is tom.

912
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:30,738
I'm at the bottom
of caz highway.

913
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:31,773
Has anybody seen Randy?

914
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:36,144
He was supposed
to meet me here.

915
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,891
Aah! Oh, God!

916
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:56,164
Oh, that hurts.

917
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:59,467
Oh, my God, it hurts.

918
01:14:06,176 --> 01:14:10,077
Oh, please.

919
01:14:11,514 --> 01:14:15,082
Skylar? Oh, my God.

920
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,986
- Come here. Come here.
- Aah!

921
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:21,122
Shit.

922
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:22,857
I thought
you were coming alone.

923
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:24,892
I did. I swear.

924
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:26,227
I don't know what happened.

925
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:27,261
- Swear to God.
- Nate...

926
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:31,499
- Swear you didn't bring them.
- I swear.

927
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,635
Sky, you okay? Can you move?

928
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:38,206
Can you move?

929
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,759
What the fuck
are you doing here?

930
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:01,929
Oh, shit. Sky?

931
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:06,067
Jamie, I need your shirt.
Do you mind?

932
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:14,108
Cut the shirt in two.
We gotta stop this bleeding.

933
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:14,610
Nate...

934
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:19,547
Well, take the handcuffs off.

935
01:15:19,549 --> 01:15:22,750
You're no good
with one hand tied.

936
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:23,184
Here.

937
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:24,685
- Tie it around his leg.
- Yeah.

938
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:28,089
- Up above the...
- Okay. Okay.

939
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:30,157
That's good. That's good.

940
01:15:48,678 --> 01:15:50,578
Hold your fire.

941
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:55,750
Jamie's in there.

942
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:09,196
There are a lot of men
out there.

943
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:10,097
We got this far.

944
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,633
We need to start thinking
about an exit strategy.

945
01:16:12,635 --> 01:16:16,237
You came all this way
to tell us to quit?

946
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,205
You've wasted your time.

947
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:20,841
- Nate.
- What, skylar?

948
01:16:20,843 --> 01:16:24,178
I have a bullet in my leg.
I can't even walk.

949
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:27,748
Maybe he's right, Nate.

950
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,987
Bloom...

951
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:33,988
It's Lloyd.

952
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:38,793
Can you tell me
what you're doing in there?

953
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:43,764
I'm having a little talk
with my boys, Lloyd.

954
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,701
Now, we're gonna come walking
out of here in just a minute.

955
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:49,003
Why don't you
send Jamie out first?

956
01:16:49,005 --> 01:16:50,738
Say whatever you want, dad.

957
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,342
We're not walking out of here.

958
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:56,043
Why don't we just let her go?

959
01:16:56,045 --> 01:17:00,748
She came on her own.
I didn't force her to come.

960
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,618
Jamie, you wanna go?

961
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:07,688
Bloom, we don't have
a lot of time.

962
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:10,891
Now, if you and boys
are holding Jamie hostage...

963
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:12,693
- Hey, wait, Lloyd...

964
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:14,095
Lloyd, there's no hostage here.

965
01:17:14,097 --> 01:17:16,897
Jamie came in here
on her own, all right?

966
01:17:16,899 --> 01:17:19,767
You just... you have to give me
a minute or two.

967
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:23,371
All right,
you got two minutes.

968
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:28,943
You heard him, two minutes.
What's it gonna be?

969
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:32,747
Nate.

970
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:34,949
Fine. Why don't you
just turn yourself in?

971
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:40,087
You didn't do anything.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

972
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:42,390
Oh, what does it matter now?
I shot dick.

973
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:46,894
Skylar didn't do shit.

974
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,898
What? You hated him.

975
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:54,201
You wished he'd drink himself
to death. Remember?

976
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:56,704
Well...

977
01:17:56,706 --> 01:17:58,873
I didn't hate him.

978
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:01,308
They're gonna shoot us.

979
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,177
Yeah.
Yeah, they're gonna try.

980
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,312
They're gonna try
to fucking kill us.

981
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:06,113
- Nate!
- What?

982
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:10,284
It's true, dad,
and you know it.

983
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:12,386
You got one minute.

984
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:16,123
Jamie.

985
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:20,928
Jamie?

986
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:24,031
No. No.

987
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:25,966
Oh, fuck.

988
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:27,468
Jamie, sweetie, listen to me.

989
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:30,471
We're gonna walk out
of here, okay?

990
01:18:30,473 --> 01:18:33,274
Have Lloyd come in.

991
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:38,079
If he comes in here,
I'll go out with him.

992
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:47,988
- Hey, Lloyd.
- Yeah?

993
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:50,491
How would you feel
about coming in here

994
01:18:50,493 --> 01:18:54,395
and escorting us out?

995
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:55,029
Why?

996
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:59,900
You come in here,
and we'll go out with you.

997
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:05,372
The boys have already
killed two cops.

998
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:10,511
What's stopping them
from killing one more?

999
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:25,059
Me.

1000
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:41,375
All right, I'm coming in.

1001
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:46,981
Hey, Lloyd,
why don't you take off your gun,

1002
01:19:46,983 --> 01:19:53,020
so we don't have
another accident?

1003
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:56,223
Good.

1004
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:06,233
Shut the fucking door, Lloyd.

1005
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,340
Holy shit.

1006
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:16,844
Holy... oh, God.

1007
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:18,078
Jamie, are you okay?

1008
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,114
They didn't kidnap me.
I came on my own.

1009
01:20:20,116 --> 01:20:24,151
Yeah. I know. I followed you.

1010
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,853
Hey. Nate!

1011
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:27,321
- You cocksucker!
- Nate!

1012
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:31,325
- He killed Uncle Mike!
- Nate, it's over.

1013
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:36,263
Just let it go.
Let's get out of here.

1014
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:39,900
Is this
why you brought me in here?

1015
01:20:39,902 --> 01:20:43,604
To kill me?

1016
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:47,341
Nate, let's stick
with the plan.

1017
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:50,911
WE MADE A DEAL.
<i>YOU</i> MADE A DEAL!

1018
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:54,949
I know you're mad, Nate.

1019
01:20:54,951 --> 01:21:00,254
I know why you're mad.

1020
01:21:00,256 --> 01:21:03,958
But you brought this thing
to a fever pitch.

1021
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,059
You made it this way.

1022
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:09,129
Now you have a chance
to get out of here alive.

1023
01:21:09,131 --> 01:21:11,599
One chance.

1024
01:21:11,601 --> 01:21:13,267
So how about it?

1025
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:16,403
Do you want to live?

1026
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,651
You take Jamie out first.

1027
01:21:30,653 --> 01:21:33,387
Then dad and skylar and me.

1028
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,155
Wait, no, Nate, Nate,
you should go out with skylar.

1029
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:37,224
I'll go out with Jamie last.
Make sure you two...

1030
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:39,293
- No. No.
Lloyd takes Jamie out.

1031
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:41,362
- Nate...
- Dad, I'm not fucking around!

1032
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:45,266
Jamie goes with Lloyd.
Then, once they're out,

1033
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:47,234
you help skylar.

1034
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,036
What about you?

1035
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:52,640
I'm last.

1036
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:03,550
We're coming out,
me and Jamie.

1037
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:11,525
Go, go. Take her in your car.
Get her home.

1038
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:15,629
I got some bad news.

1039
01:22:15,631 --> 01:22:20,067
Randy's dead. Bloom shot him.

1040
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:42,589
What the fuck, man?
She was our ticket out of here.

1041
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:47,294
I didn't want her
to get hurt.

1042
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,101
These assholes
are gonna kill us.

1043
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:57,604
Right here, one way or another.

1044
01:22:57,606 --> 01:23:02,009
They're not taking us
back to town.

1045
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:07,314
Nate,
you better give me my gun.

1046
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:11,018
We don't have a choice.

1047
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,387
You don't have a choice!

1048
01:23:13,389 --> 01:23:16,056
We didn't sell our souls
to the cavanaughs!

1049
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:19,526
We don't have to do
what they say.

1050
01:23:19,528 --> 01:23:20,694
What choice do we have?

1051
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:25,099
Nate, they're gonna come in here
one way or the other.

1052
01:23:25,101 --> 01:23:28,702
How do we know
they're not gonna shoot us

1053
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:31,338
if we go out?

1054
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,141
Because Lloyd gave me
his word.

1055
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:38,512
LLOYD IS A<i>CAVANAUGH,</i>DAD!

1056
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:39,713
And you know as well as I do

1057
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:43,784
that this is gonna end
right here!

1058
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:45,552
You either go out there

1059
01:23:45,554 --> 01:23:50,357
