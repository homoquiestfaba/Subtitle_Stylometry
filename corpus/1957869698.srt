1
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,874
<i>Reo.</i>

2
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:38,251
You scared me.

3
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,555
<i>Did you get what I asked for?</i>

4
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:41,889
Yeah.

5
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:46,661
Hey, Dad.

6
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:49,530
I'm gonna beat you.

7
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,431
I'm gonna beat you at this game.

8
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:52,934
<i>All right. We'll see.</i>

9
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,198
<i>The number</i>
<i>of homicides and suicides</i>

10
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,601
<i>continues to climb</i>
<i>since the release</i>

11
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,369
<i>of the groundbreaking footage</i>
<i>of Reo Nakata</i>

12
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,939
<i>playing cards</i>
<i>with his dead father.</i>

13
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,176
<i>Dr. Stevensen</i>
<i>of the Life Beyond Institute</i>

14
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,812
<i>is live now to address</i>
<i>Congress's motion</i>

15
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,748
<i>to shut her study down.</i>
<i>Let's take a listen.</i>

16
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,316
<i>It is irrefutable.</i>

17
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,486
<i>Our consciousness continues</i>
<i>beyond our physical bodies.</i>

18
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,823
<i>Death is merely a transition</i>

19
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:50,525
<i>to another existence...</i>

20
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,160
<i>...one we can now see...</i>

21
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,493
<i>...track and record</i>

22
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,329
<i>due to the findings</i>
<i>of my Life Beyond research.</i>

23
00:04:57,165 --> 00:05:00,101
<i>At our institute, we now bridge</i>
<i>dozens of new participants</i>

24
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,636
<i>daily from this world</i>
<i>to the next,</i>

25
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:04,471
<i>which has led</i>
<i>to astounding breakthroughs.</i>

26
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,641
<i>Soon, we will</i>
<i>be able to comprehend</i>

27
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,076
<i>what was previously</i>
<i>the great unknown.</i>

28
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,546
<i>With countless possibilities</i>
<i>ahead of us,</i>

29
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:15,183
<i>it is imperative</i>
<i>we continue this research.</i>

30
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,952
<i>Much like many explorers</i>
<i>before us,</i>

31
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:20,054
<i>we have seen our world expand.</i>

32
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:23,291
<i>It is now our duty</i>
<i>to discover how far.</i>

33
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:26,060
<i>Contrary to recent news,</i>
<i>my Life Beyond study,</i>

34
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:28,029
<i>like all proper</i>
<i>research programs,</i>

35
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:29,764
<i>is strictly a</i>
<i>volunteer program.</i>

36
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:34,168
<i>It is a clinical,</i>
<i>not criminal enterprise.</i>

37
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,171
<i>Congress is attempting</i>
<i>to shut us down,</i>

38
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,506
<i>but their efforts only show</i>

39
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,541
<i>how much they fundamentally</i>
<i>misunderstand</i>

40
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,109
<i>the facts of our new reality...</i>

41
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,349
Hey, it's Chad.
I'm here for the TV.

42
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,750
You got the cash?

43
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:42,069
It works, right?

44
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,537
Yeah.

45
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,875
<i>What do you have to say</i>

46
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,310
<i>about the shootings</i>
<i>taking place?</i>

47
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:50,945
<i>Everyone needs to calm down.</i>

48
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,513
<i>Congress will sort out</i>
<i>the legislation</i>

49
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,814
<i>- but in the meantime...</i>
- All yours.

50
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:55,415
<i>...people are adding</i>
<i>to the chaos, all right?</i>

51
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,285
<i>We really need to know more</i>
<i>before any decision.</i>

52
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,020
Hello?

53
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,688
<i>Hello! This is James</i>

54
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,523
<i>from Dr. Stevensen's</i>
<i>Life Beyond study.</i>

55
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,091
<i>Can you please confirm</i>
<i>your password?</i>

56
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:08,195
Uh. Yeah. It's,
uh, 35 capital FML.

57
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,197
<i>Just checking to confirm,</i>

58
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:12,233
<i>you declined your flight</i>
<i>to San Francisco</i>

59
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,669
<i>- and requested a car?</i>
- Yeah.

60
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,370
They told me
that would be okay.

61
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,470
<i>Of course.</i>

62
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,407
<i>I'm sending your car rental</i>
<i>information now.</i>

63
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,042
<i>Pick-up is noon today.</i>

64
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:23,945
I'll be there.

65
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,247
<i>Everything is in order.</i>

66
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,249
<i>Have your confirmation</i>
<i>QR code when you arrive</i>

67
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,886
<i>- and we'll see you soon.</i>
- Okay, thanks. Bye.

68
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:37,158
So, are you one of those people?

69
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:41,662
That must be exciting to...
just let it all go.

70
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:43,564
I respect that.

71
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,870
Can I do anything else
for you before you go?

72
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,878
Let me help you with the TV.

73
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:04,685
Hey, I can get that.

74
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,254
Hey.

75
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:10,925
Hey!

76
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,999
Whoa, hey!
Give me back my money!

77
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,701
<i>Just give me the fucking money.</i>

78
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,672
<i>I'm gonna keep</i>
<i>standing out here.</i>

79
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:27,541
<i>Hello?</i>

80
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:32,947
<i>You crazy bitch!</i>

81
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:43,724
No, I got it.
Noon pick-up. I'll be there.

82
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:45,259
Great. Thank you.

83
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,228
Fuck yeah, Stanley!

84
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,164
Hey, I'm going to San Francisco.

85
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:51,966
What? You're one of them??

86
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:02,376
<i>That's right.</i>

87
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,745
<i>We're here live</i>
<i>in San Francisco.</i>

88
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,981
<i>Crowds have gathered</i>
<i>just outside Dr. Stevensen.</i>

89
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:08,849
I'm just eating breakfast.
Come in. Come in.

90
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,284
<i>The next round...</i>

91
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,119
What the hell's the dog
doing here?

92
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,222
<i>And they're coming out now.</i>

93
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:17,992
<i>They're taking their positions.</i>
<i>This is very exciting.</i>

94
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,329
<i>Here's Dr. Stevensen herself.</i>

95
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:24,598
Killing themselves
over this bull bunk.

96
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,334
They say robberies are down
because the robbers

97
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:29,437
can't get people to do
what they want anymore.

98
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,172
Like dying isn't dying.

99
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,875
Well, it's... it's been proven,
Milton. It's science now.

100
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:37,745
But science is supposed
to make ya smarter, not dumber.

101
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,849
Hey, look, Milton, um...

102
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:44,452
I've got to go.
I've got somewhere to be.

103
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,587
What? I put you
on the team for today.

104
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:48,923
You said you wanted this gig.
You can't do this.

105
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:52,326
I'm here for Stanley.
I'm... I'm leaving him to you.

106
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,964
<i>We're so</i>
<i>excited to be here to help see</i>

107
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:59,266
<i>and support</i>
<i>our brave new participants.</i>

108
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,535
<i>Let's give them</i>
<i>a round of applause.</i>

109
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,637
<i>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

110
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,509
It's not the fucking Oscars,
kid.

111
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,076
There's nothing to celebrate.

112
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,112
I'm going to San Francisco.

113
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,480
Teddy...

114
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,181
I'm not asking
for permission.

115
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,749
Teddy, you're...
you're young yet.

116
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,918
You don't know how much
you have to look forward to.

117
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:20,354
Come on.
We both know that's not true.

118
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:23,324
I mean, did...
did you see that Niko guy on TV?

119
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:24,593
I saw a bunch of people.

120
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:28,662
Every station, every newspaper.
Like him. Like me.

121
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,066
I mean, I'm on that list.
This way...

122
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,769
this way, I... I finally have
a shot at something.

123
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:39,240
You can't really think that.

124
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,915
You're gonna need some
of this for Stanley, all right?

125
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,352
So this is supposed
to be goodbye?

126
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:55,856
No. No. I'll... I'll come back
and haunt you.

127
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,661
Okay, listen,
they made me the reservation.

128
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,429
I don't understand why
I have to put a credit card down

129
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:04,465
- if it's already paid for.
- I'm sorry.

130
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:06,267
- But it's company policy.
- Right.

131
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,935
If you'd like,
I will call corporate

132
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,370
- and triple-check.
- Please. Do it.

133
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,971
Hello!
I can help you over here, sir.

134
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,373
Hey. Uh, yeah.
I have a car reserved for me

135
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:13,941
- for a noon pick-up.
- Great.

136
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,577
I just need your credit card
and driver's license.

137
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:18,513
Yeah. Ah... Here you go.

138
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:19,847
Perfect. Thank you.

139
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,849
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
This expires in a week.

140
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,250
I won't be needing
it past then.

141
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,985
You'll need
a valid driver's license

142
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,154
that doesn't expire for two
months in order to rent a car.

143
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,524
That makes no sense.
It's valid for when I need it.

144
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,458
Just so you know, Blossom...

145
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,459
Rose.

146
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:33,727
...you have to have
a credit card

147
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,429
if you want us
to rent you a car.

148
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:37,364
This is insane.
This is literally insane.

149
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,933
They made me the reservation.

150
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,036
- Just one second.
- Thanks.

151
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:48,075
All right?

152
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:50,311
Are you two together?

153
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,513
- Hey.
- Excuse me?

154
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,780
She should be
so lucky.

155
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:56,585
It seems the same company
has reserved both your cars.

156
00:11:56,685 --> 00:11:58,352
And they both have
the same destination.

157
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:00,721
When's your appointment?

158
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,991
- Um, seven days.
- Mine's in five.

159
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,259
You a serial killer?

160
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,895
Yeah, no. No, I say.
No, definitely not.

161
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,664
No. Promise.
Never killed anyone.

162
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:10,798
Shame.

163
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,466
Well, maybe
we could help each other.

164
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:13,635
In killing each other?

165
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,804
Well, uh, no.
Getting to Dr. Stevensen's.

166
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,406
- You're British, huh?
- Innit.

167
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,477
Do you have earbuds?

168
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,047
Awesome. So you, uh,

169
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,316
you want to take the first shift
and then we'll do a swap out?

170
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,152
- You can't drive.
- That's not true.

171
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:33,787
I can turn the wheel
and everything.

172
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,523
Can even stay
on the right side of the road.

173
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:36,991
Or is it the left?

174
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,259
I'm just kidding.

175
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:41,095
We just need to get away
from these rental fuckers.

176
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:45,199
Finally!

177
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:48,102
An adventure, right?

178
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,903
You know
what's at the end of this.

179
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,106
Yeah, everything
I've ever wanted.

180
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:53,774
You?

181
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,142
It's Blossom, right?

182
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:57,044
- Rose.
- Ah.

183
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,281
I go by my middle name.

184
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,484
Sweet.
So you prefer Rose or Rosie?

185
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:04,785
Rose.

186
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,655
By the way, uh, I'm Teddy.

187
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,424
- That's a pretty name.
- I'm not interested.

188
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,126
Excuse me?
I wasn't offering.

189
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,794
Can you, uh,
crack your window, please?

190
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:16,598
- It smells like smoke in here.
- Oh, that's actually not me.

191
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,800
Um, I, uh, I... I don't smoke.

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,604
Well, uh, I work with
some guys who do, and...

193
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,272
Yeah, when they're not
lifting stuff, they, uh...

194
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,174
they just light up.

195
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,177
So, and I don't see the point
in doing laundry anymore, so.

196
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,714
Oh. Please don't, uh.

197
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,982
- Ah.
- Seventeen missed calls.

198
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,690
<i>Oh, and thanks for the license.</i>

199
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:45,259
<i>Yeah, I, uh, can't be arsed</i>
<i>with that paperwork shit, so.</i>

200
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,428
<i>Yeah. Um...</i>

201
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,230
<i>so, what do you do?</i>

202
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,166
<i>Did? What... What did you do?</i>

203
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,436
<i>Um, what did you do?</i>
<i>You're a mover?</i>

204
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,304
<i>I actually, uh,</i>
<i>I used to have my own company.</i>

205
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:00,474
<i>Had a few, actually.</i>
<i>And, uh, you know...</i>

206
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:01,643
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

207
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,077
<i>Sometimes you need</i>
<i>the extra cash, right?</i>

208
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,912
<i>Do you want</i>
<i>to put those earbuds on?</i>

209
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,815
<i>Maybe you can</i>
<i>use the Bluetooth.</i>

210
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,718
<i>Hey, look,</i>
<i>there's an article about us.</i>

211
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:14,589
<i>Human Rights Activist</i>
<i>Maya Cam. Camp-yon.</i>

212
00:14:14,823 --> 00:14:15,824
<i>- Cam... Camp-yon.</i>
<i>- Campion.</i>

213
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,258
<i>Camp-yon... Campion</i>
<i>issued a formal statement</i>

214
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,395
<i>declaring that the right</i>
<i>to die is a civil liberty.</i>

215
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:23,565
<i>Damn straight.</i>

216
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,399
<i>And who the fuck</i>
<i>are these senators</i>

217
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,601
<i>who are trying to control us?</i>

218
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:30,170
<i>People who don't believe,</i>
<i>or don't want to believe.</i>

219
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,016
I got you chips.

220
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,022
How can you eat that shit?

221
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,291
What? Is there a better time?

222
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,562
I wonder if cows
get to be ghosts.

223
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:29,898
- Definitely not.
- How do you know?

224
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,466
Because there'd be
a whole bunch of mad angry cows

225
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:33,768
haunting the shit outta me.

226
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,069
Ah. Hopefully pigs make the cut.

227
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,406
Oh, it's an insult. I'm the pig.

228
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,141
- It's just a thought.
- Hmm. Hmm.

229
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,644
Just a thought.

230
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:44,411
Any other thoughts?

231
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,946
<i>Things have changed.</i>

232
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:49,517
<i>If you have something left</i>
<i>to say to someone who's passed,</i>

233
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:51,051
<i>we are here for you.</i>

234
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,788
<i>Our three mediums</i>
<i>are standing by...</i>

235
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:55,055
Hey, someone
really wants to chat.

236
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,156
<i>...deliver your</i>
<i>messages to your</i>

237
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,191
<i>loved ones on the other side.</i>

238
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,992
Ah. The mystery
continues, eh?

239
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,361
<i>- Retrial.</i>
<i>- Where are those earbuds?</i>

240
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:02,564
I haven't seen them yet.

241
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:08,368
- Willing driver.
- With no valid license.

242
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:11,104
- Only on a technicality.
- I'm not taking any risks.

243
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,674
Oh, right, yeah. Me driving.

244
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:14,241
That's the biggest risk
right now.

245
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,146
Did I tell you I also know
how to use the blinkers?

246
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,428
- King or queen for you folks?
- Two rooms, please.

247
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,098
- The further apart, the better.
- We're trying to conceive.

248
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:43,671
- Two rooms that we do have...
- Whatever two rooms you have.

249
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,442
Oh, um, if you find me
dead in the morning,

250
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:51,278
she did it. Yeah.
Be sure to thank her for me.

251
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:01,088
Oh.

252
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:06,861
- 6:00 a.m., you got it?
- Just so I know,

253
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:08,328
is it gonna be like this
the whole trip?

254
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,398
I need to be in San Francisco
in four days for my appointment.

255
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,002
That requires us
not fucking around. Okay?

256
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,837
Anyway, that's not
what I'm talking about.

257
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,971
What are you
talking about?

258
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,574
You don't have to be
an asshole the whole time.

259
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,209
Excuse me?

260
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,177
You heard.

261
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,113
Let me make something
really clear to you.

262
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,916
We're not buddies.
We're not pals.

263
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,384
We're not
in this together. Okay?

264
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:31,485
Bollocks.

265
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:34,087
How many people know what
it's like to be us right now?

266
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:38,492
6:00 a.m., the car leaves.
Be in it or don't.

267
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:40,795
- Sharp.
- Razor.

268
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:47,367
Oh, my God! Stop following me.
I don't want to be your friend!

269
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:50,738
What?

270
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:30,210
<i>Rose.</i>

271
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:56,470
<i>On the sector from Wall Street,</i>

272
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:58,305
<i>the blue chips fell victim</i>
<i>to a sell-off...</i>

273
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,396
<i>They are so easy...</i>

274
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,132
<i>...at</i>
<i>the first pitch and fouled it</i>

275
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,400
<i>deep back</i>
<i>into the stands behind...</i>

276
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,707
<i>Hi, is this the front desk?</i>

277
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,242
Is there anything good
to do around here?

278
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,679
<i>Hey there,</i>
<i>I don't want this in my house.</i>

279
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:41,149
<i>Sorry, but my grandmother...</i>

280
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,051
<i>...why</i>
<i>this study is so important.</i>

281
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,086
<i>So let's get to the question</i>

282
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,254
<i>that's on</i>
<i>everyone's mind, I think.</i>

283
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:51,092
<i>Are you asking people</i>
<i>to end their lives?</i>

284
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,629
<i>I'd say</i>
<i>this is a beginning for some.</i>

285
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:59,199
<i>So,</i>
<i>why can some people see ghosts?</i>

286
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,537
<i>I still can't! So,</i>
<i>how do you explain that?</i>

287
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,304
<i>Mm-hmm. That's right.</i>

288
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,941
<i>Uh. Some of our participants</i>
<i>have had experiences</i>

289
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:08,609
<i>with ghosts,</i>
<i>and others haven't.</i>

290
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:11,746
<i>Uh. What we do know is</i>
<i>that not everyone comes back,</i>

291
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,681
<i>and we have seen</i>
<i>that those who do come back</i>

292
00:20:13,948 --> 00:20:16,150
<i>have a strong connection</i>
<i>to Earth for a reason.</i>

293
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:20,054
<i>Like... like Niko did</i>
<i>with his young son Reo here?</i>

294
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,421
<i>Exactly. Uh, this is why</i>

295
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:22,990
<i>the participants</i>
<i>in this controlled study</i>

296
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,092
<i>are so important.</i>

297
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:27,327
<i>They're ushering us into the</i>
<i>next era of human existence.</i>

298
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:29,530
<i>These people are among</i>
<i>the bravest and most valiant</i>

299
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:32,299
<i>men and women</i>
<i>in all of history.</i>

300
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,068
<i>And it all started with</i>

301
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:36,838
<i>young Reo letting you know</i>
<i>about his father visiting him?</i>

302
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:38,271
<i>Yeah, that's right. Uh,</i>

303
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:40,742
<i>our first big breakthrough</i>
<i>began when Reo's mom</i>

304
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:43,644
<i>saw him playing a card game</i>
<i>that only his father knew.</i>

305
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:46,114
<i>The strong connection</i>
<i>between Reo and his father</i>

306
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,482
<i>brought them together</i>
<i>and the rest is, well,</i>

307
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:51,986
<i>history in the making.</i>

308
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:55,223
<i>Reo, how does it feel to be</i>

309
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:57,892
<i>a part of such</i>
<i>a world-changing event?</i>

310
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,094
<i>I just want to</i>
<i>see my dad again.</i>

311
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,232
<i>Aw.</i>

312
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:07,802
Kid's the biggest thing
in the world and he has no idea.

313
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:54,949
Rose!

314
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,584
Come on.

315
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:00,755
Rose!

316
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,493
6:00 a.m. sharp.

317
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:17,004
Hi, how you doing?
Um, I've locked myself out.

318
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,706
Do you mind just helping me?

319
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,744
Yeah. Dying for a piss,
you know.

320
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,081
- Thank you. Cheers.
- All right.

321
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:31,853
Rose?

322
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:35,590
Are you decent?

323
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:46,366
Rose?

324
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:54,909
Rose?

325
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,481
Rooo...

326
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:41,923
This is ridiculous.

327
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,596
Uh. Oh, fuck.

328
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,036
Oh, fuck.

329
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,074
Fuck!

330
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:22,096
Teddy!

331
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,797
- I knocked a lot.
- Can we go?

332
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:58,733
We're headed South, right?
Avoid the snow?

333
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:01,002
Oh, God.
I need a Tylenol.

334
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,471
You cool
if we miss New Mexico?

335
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,840
I'm cool
to make sure we get there.

336
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:08,843
Hmm. I think
I plotted us a good route.

337
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:11,779
Awesome, let's go take it.

338
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,895
I'm done. Let's go.

339
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:42,676
I got the keys, asshole.

340
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:45,012
<i>So you're saying</i>

341
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:47,081
<i>that this irrational rise</i>
<i>in suicides...</i>

342
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:49,016
<i>What's</i>
<i>irrational? People are in debt.</i>

343
00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:50,684
<i>Even if they do have</i>
<i>a job that pays,</i>

344
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:52,286
<i>it's still not enough</i>
<i>to own a home.</i>

345
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,954
<i>They can't support</i>
<i>their families.</i>

346
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,757
<i>If there's no end, why not</i>
<i>consider the other option?</i>

347
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:58,759
<i>It's easier than getting</i>
<i>Canadian citizenship.</i>

348
00:25:58,859 --> 00:25:59,927
<i>Uh.</i>

349
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:01,328
<i>Why are we</i>
<i>gettin' off the highway?</i>

350
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:06,700
Oh.

351
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:09,170
If only there was someone else
who could drive.

352
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:11,105
Such a shame.

353
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:16,277
Do you think this means
other things could be real?

354
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:17,478
Ghosts aren't enough?

355
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:19,613
Like fairies, or, uh, jackalope.

356
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:21,348
- That's stupid.
- Why's it stupid?

357
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,553
Because jackalopes aren't even
proper mythological animals.

358
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:26,887
Just invented
by a bored taxidermist.

359
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:28,557
I bet you loved
telling other kids at school

360
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:30,391
- Santa wasn't real either.
- Santa is real.

361
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:31,926
He's a drunk pedophile
letting little kids

362
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:33,594
sit on his lap
at the mall every year.

363
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,663
I supposed the tooth fairy
is a crack whore as well.

364
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:40,501
<i>So what made you want</i>
<i>to volunteer for the doc?</i>

365
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:41,669
<i>What made you?</i>

366
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,238
- You're good at that.
- Practice makes perfect.

367
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:48,275
I want my life
to mean something.

368
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,344
You know, to be a pioneer.

369
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:52,279
To finally have my shot
at making...

370
00:26:52,514 --> 00:26:53,447
Have you practiced that?

371
00:26:53,848 --> 00:26:55,649
You got like an Instagram
handle for the afterlife?

372
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:57,918
Oh, and your
reason's better, is it?

373
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:00,654
Yes.

374
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:03,592
- You're embarrassed.
- I'm not embarrassed.

375
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,659
Hey, hey. It's okay.

376
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,462
Is it pathetic?
Because mine is.

377
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:11,265
No family. No kids. No home.

378
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:13,767
You know, I was gonna come
to the States and make it big

379
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:17,304
and have this perfect wife,
and travel the world.

380
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:19,807
I've been here ten years,

381
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,143
and I've never even left
New York State.

382
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:25,446
And now?
Now, I finally get a chance

383
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,349
to go to California
and be a part of something.

384
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,352
Now that's fuckin'
beautifully pathetic.

385
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:35,289
- There is no beauty in this.
- What? Why isn't it beautiful?

386
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,259
I mean, it's not just the end,
it's the beginning.

387
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,760
And doing it because
you don't wanna answer

388
00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:41,162
your fucking phone
is more pathetic than mine.

389
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:44,198
- I lost everyone.
- So? I never even had anyone!

390
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:45,499
- But I did!
- So?

391
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,734
So why...
why are you doing this?

392
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,936
Because I can't even
kill myself.

393
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:50,605
I tried. I tried pills,

394
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:52,940
chased with vodka
and rubbing alcohol.

395
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,776
I was found three days later
in a pool of my own vomit

396
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:57,411
with half-digested pills
everywhere.

397
00:27:57,646 --> 00:27:59,780
Only thing that happened was
that my landlord yelled at me

398
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,583
for ruining his wood floors.

399
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:02,850
So fuck 'em.

400
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,152
I need someone to do it
for me because I can't.

401
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:07,755
All I know is that
this hurts all the time.

402
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:09,423
And I have tried
to fix it, but...

403
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:35,115
- Whoa!
- It's not my fault.

404
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:36,685
- Whoa!
- It's not my fault.

405
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:39,820
I mean, I... I didn't mean to.
Oh, fuck.

406
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:46,427
Fuck. I...
it was an accident. I...

407
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:48,295
It wasn't an accident.

408
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:50,565
Ye... yes, it was!

409
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,734
No, no, no. You didn't...
No, you didn't mean to.

410
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,736
This has been happening. Look.

411
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,677
What a douche.

412
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:07,381
I'm supposed to be fixing
my own shit, not other people's!

413
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:11,252
Well, now I know what he meant
about the wood floors.

414
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,786
Should we call the cops?

415
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:15,690
"Hey, we just helped
some guy kill himself,

416
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:19,059
but, uh, we're in a rush,
so can you give us a ride?"

417
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:20,928
No!

418
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,697
Come here.

419
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:24,832
- Wait.
- We got to fix the tire.

420
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:34,208
Okay.
This will work, yeah?

421
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:38,546
- Yeah.
- Okay, so get it on there.

422
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,850
Where's the jack?

423
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:46,920
- Balls!
- Yeah. Big fat hairy balls.

424
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:49,156
Did you see a garage
as we drove through?

425
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,158
I saw five burger joints.

426
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:54,828
So we walk or we wait.

427
00:29:57,766 --> 00:30:00,434
What do you think,
dead guy?

428
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:02,936
Joe. Dead Joe.

429
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:05,272
I feel like he's more of a Jack.

430
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:08,075
What do you think, Dead Jack?

431
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:19,887
Still no service?

432
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:26,427
Fuck!

433
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,129
Fuck! We have lost two hours.

434
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,800
- We'll be okay.
- Breakfast didn't help.

435
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:34,435
Neither did sleeping in
or Dead Joe.

436
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:37,905
- Dead Jack.
- Dead Jack, fine.

437
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,375
You want to walk over there
and see if we get some service?

438
00:30:41,743 --> 00:30:42,910
Do it.

439
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:47,348
You know of all the ways
I would have killed myself,

440
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:49,483
I never would have done
what Dead Jack did.

441
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:53,287
- He could have killed us.
- Missed opportunity.

442
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,128
What does rubbing alcohol
taste like?

443
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,030
When you drank it?

444
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:05,667
People always say, "That tastes
like rubbing alcohol."

445
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,335
I was just wondering
if they were right.

446
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:17,645
I was 11 when I first
tried to kill myself.

447
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:20,648
I tried to overdose
with a bottle of vitamins.

448
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:22,282
Yeah. It didn't work,

449
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:25,085
but it did give me the shits
for about a week.

450
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,623
Then about a few years ago,

451
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,625
I jumped off a subway platform,

452
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,027
but I mistimed it so I just
bounced off the subway car.

453
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:35,295
Bullshit.

454
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:41,135
When I was a kid, I tried to
slit my wrists with paperclips,

455
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:43,370
but my arm got too tired
so I just gave up.

456
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:46,674
That's a fucking cliché.

457
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:49,143
The vodka was warm and cheap.

458
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:51,145
It all tasted about the same.

459
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:54,081
- Next time you should try lime.
- Hmm.

460
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:03,023
Do you see that?

461
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:12,332
Is that?

462
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:19,339
Yeah.

463
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:22,510
- Let me see what I can do.
- Yes.

464
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:25,312
Thank you. Thank you.

465
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:29,617
We've, uh...

466
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:32,152
been calling him Jack.

467
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:37,257
That's funny.
That's my name.

468
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:41,094
Poor misguided soul.

469
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,263
Think they'll find a better way.

470
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:45,132
No shit.

471
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:47,569
I mean a better way to live.

472
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:52,941
Well, we're lucky
you came along.

473
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:55,275
Yeah. Well, I walk
this road twice a day.

474
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:58,613
We've had to cancel all
but two of our masses this week.

475
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:03,050
I'd say you're overdue
for a reformation.

476
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:04,686
It'd be nice to see
the Catholics

477
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:06,220
do away with a few things.

478
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,122
Like mortal sin,
condemning of birth control,

479
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:12,159
or the idea
that suicides are damned.

480
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:16,029
Yeah. Well...

481
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:19,366
I already got rid
of that one actually.

482
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:25,472
My little indulgence.

483
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,478
So you're walking this road
every day hoping...

484
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,248
What?
You'll end up finding Damascus?

485
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:36,751
Uh. What's Damascus?

486
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:38,385
Saint Paul.

487
00:33:38,887 --> 00:33:41,355
The risen Christ appeared
to him on the road to Damascus,

488
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:43,056
showed him the light.

489
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:48,095
Yeah, I guess
it's a little like that.

490
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:51,164
Scientific discoveries
and religious reformations

491
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:52,332
don't go hand in hand.

492
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,501
Oh, seems to me that
the two could help each other.

493
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:57,070
Then why did the Catholic Church
come out against Dr. Stevensen?

494
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,540
Because she is playing God

495
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,507
and hurting people.

496
00:33:59,707 --> 00:34:02,544
She's preying on the vulnerable.
Stealing His gift.

497
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:08,816
Let me, uh, focus on this
so I can get you going.

498
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:14,187
All right, we can do this.

499
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:17,357
- Lift this. Ready?
- Yeah.

500
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:19,961
Three, two, one.

501
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,530
Jesus fucking Christ!

502
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,098
Sorry.

503
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,234
Okay, okay. It's in.

504
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:30,004
Whoo!

505
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,172
Don't worry
about the other Jack.

506
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:33,708
I'll call it in.

507
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,712
Would you hear my confession?

508
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:34,869
Oh.

509
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,138
So?

510
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:40,340
Okay.

511
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:49,651
So I guess
he's not done walking.

512
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:07,935
Uh. Can you look up

513
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:09,871
how we, uh,
get back to the highway?

514
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:12,439
Mm. Yeah, straight ahead.
Route 90.

515
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:16,678
I asked Jack earlier.
Father Jack. Not Dead Jack.

516
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:17,812
Yeah.

517
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:25,452
- So you're Catholic.
- Yeah.

518
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:28,056
I've been confirmed
and everything.

519
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:29,524
Hmm.

520
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:32,292
So how many people do you think
breathed a sigh of relief

521
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:35,295
when they found out they weren't
going to hell for their sins?

522
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,303
Well, I've been
to a bar mitzvah.

523
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:48,241
I made confession in Italy.

524
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:51,512
I took a shit in a black cab.

525
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:59,721
<i>I lit my sister's prom dress</i>
<i>on fire when I was 14.</i>

526
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:00,888
<i>Why?</i>

527
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,824
<i>You would have too,</i>
<i>if you would have seen it.</i>

528
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:05,927
I kissed my grandma's friend.

529
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,061
Yeah.

530
00:37:07,862 --> 00:37:10,363
- I've been on a yacht.
- Oh. Fancypants.

531
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:12,365
I crossed the Thames
in an inflatable swan.

532
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,634
No, you didn't.

533
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:15,435
Yeah, I got arrested
and everything.

534
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:17,739
Okay. I, uh,

535
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:19,173
I... I've been to a cockfight.

536
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:22,009
That is disgusting.

537
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:25,479
- I've been to a rodeo.
- How is that not disgusting?

538
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,248
I ate our goldfish.

539
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,485
- Like, the family goldfish?
- Apparently, yeah.

540
00:37:31,753 --> 00:37:34,254
I've never been
to a baseball game.

541
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:35,857
I've been to dozens.

542
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:38,526
Wow, you really
love baseball.

543
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,096
I hate baseball.
It's the dumbest game ever.

544
00:37:42,597 --> 00:37:46,000
The entire sport is designed to
make everybody else do nothing.

545
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:49,904
The pitcher tries to throw the
ball so the batter can't hit it.

546
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:52,106
The batter tries to hit
the ball out of the park

547
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:53,608
so the catcher can't catch it.

548
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:56,677
And the basemen guard the bases
so the runners can't run.

549
00:37:57,545 --> 00:38:00,581
It's designed to make everybody
stand around and do fuck-all.

550
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,518
So why'd you go?

551
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:07,789
'Cause that's what you do.

552
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:10,525
<i>Okay, hold on. So,</i>

553
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:13,426
uh, just carry on straight
down the highway.

554
00:38:13,661 --> 00:38:15,696
I do like your British
accent better than Siri's.

555
00:38:15,797 --> 00:38:17,430
I thought you didn't
like the British accent.

556
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:19,534
But I like the way
you say the directions,

557
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:20,367
just that.

558
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:23,838
Continue down
this path for three days.

559
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:24,705
Ugh.

560
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:26,607
You can
just change regional.

561
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,441
We can do Indian one as well.

562
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:29,977
<i>You can.</i>
<i>You can put Indian Siri.</i>

563
00:38:30,077 --> 00:38:32,013
<i>- That's what I want.</i>
<i>- Turn left.</i>

564
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:33,413
<i>Turn right.</i>

565
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:40,922
Okay. Never have I ever
robbed a store.

566
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:48,129
- Really?
- What? You presumed I had?

567
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:49,597
Why? What gave you
the impression

568
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:51,331
- that I would have...
- No. You know what?

569
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:52,667
- ...robbed a store?
- I'm not gonna walk

570
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:54,401
- into this trap.
- What were you basing that on?

571
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:55,736
This is a trap.

572
00:38:56,137 --> 00:38:57,337
Um...

573
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:00,908
never have I ever
had sex for money.

574
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:11,018
No. Really?
Oh, I gotta hear this story.

575
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:12,954
Fuck, no.

576
00:39:13,221 --> 00:39:14,856
All right. Okay.
I'm going there.

577
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:15,857
Okay.

578
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:20,427
Never have I ever had
an affair of any kind.

579
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,767
Oh, you're bad.

580
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,036
Never have I ever
been caught masturbating.

581
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,241
Sorry.

582
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:36,143
We used to play this
to pass time on patrol

583
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:39,647
and, uh, guess
I was just playing along.

584
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:41,883
Feel for you, brother.

585
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,085
To cheeky wanks.

586
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,254
Okay. Wait, wait.
Okay. Me, me, me.

587
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:49,590
Mm-hmm.
- All right.

588
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:51,192
Never have I ever.

589
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:52,459
Never have I ever.

590
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,895
- Are you with me, brother?
- Are you okay?

591
00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:55,495
- He's okay.
- Here we go.

592
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:56,964
Never have I ever...

593
00:39:57,965 --> 00:39:59,200
peed my pants.

594
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:04,071
As an adult, post-high school,
post-high school. Amen.

595
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:06,707
Yeah. Of course.
Of course it's him.

596
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,178
I thought we was a team.

597
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:16,984
I fucking knew it.
I knew that was you.

598
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:19,020
All right. Let's see
what other commandments

599
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:21,454
we can break.

600
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:23,758
We've got what?

601
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:25,458
- Theft?
- Yes.

602
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:26,794
- Sodomy.
- Sodomy.

603
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:28,262
- Peeing.
- That's times two.

604
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:29,830
- Yeah.
- Peeing.

605
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:31,666
- You.
- Mm.

606
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:34,501
Never have I ever...

607
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:36,570
...killed a man.

608
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:40,841
- To Jack.
- Mm.

609
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:43,411
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Get the fuck out of here.

610
00:40:44,211 --> 00:40:47,048
Well...

611
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:54,255
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

612
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,112
Yikes. Yikes.

613
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:23,217
How many is that?

614
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:25,519
Four.

615
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:37,431
You shot five men?

616
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:41,535
Why do you always assume
we Texans are shooting people?

617
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:42,937
Don't answer that.

618
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:46,841
It was the sun.

619
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:50,011
Twenty miles
from the border. Yeah.

620
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:53,047
It was an accident.

621
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:57,385
Not that it makes
any difference.

622
00:41:57,752 --> 00:41:59,220
I know this is gonna sound corny

623
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,223
but I always wanted
to serve my country

624
00:42:02,556 --> 00:42:06,560
so I got asked to guard a wall.

625
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,965
Mostly just processing people.

626
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:14,268
So...
...these two,

627
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:16,537
their access
is denied, you know.

628
00:42:16,737 --> 00:42:18,472
And we were just
following procedure.

629
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:21,542
We've denied
this husband, wife access.

630
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,310
And he's pretty mad

631
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,713
but I don't speak Spanish
so I just...

632
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,949
I just showed him
where the nearest exit was.

633
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:30,384
Right?

634
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:34,388
So the next day,
I'm on patrol. Standard.

635
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:37,691
We see these two,

636
00:42:38,592 --> 00:42:40,161
and they're making a run for it.

637
00:42:40,428 --> 00:42:41,695
We go after them but...

638
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:45,166
...they're goin'
the wrong damn way.

639
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:49,737
And they, uh,

640
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:52,973
they run
into this shed, all right.

641
00:42:53,974 --> 00:42:55,943
Come up with a plan.

642
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:58,179
We're just gonna scare 'em.

643
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:00,648
All right. We slam the door,

644
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:04,218
you know, bang on the shed,
scream some shit.

645
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:10,791
We were in the middle
of the desert.

646
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:11,959
We knew...

647
00:43:13,494 --> 00:43:15,329
they weren't going nowhere.

648
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:19,500
Next day, we... we head back
to the shed

649
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:22,870
and, uh,
it was the afternoon by then.

650
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:27,908
When we slammed the door shut...

651
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:34,181
...it gets stuck.

652
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:38,185
So we had to get
a crowbar to open it.

653
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:42,857
And he's got
his arms wrapped around...

654
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:46,694
three small kids.

655
00:43:48,496 --> 00:43:49,697
These kids...

656
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:57,972
their bodies were empty.
Their faces were... melted.

657
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:05,646
It was 135 degrees inside.

658
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,017
We cooked them.

659
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,123
Can you see them?

660
00:44:20,728 --> 00:44:21,862
Right there.

661
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,440
That lady doctor...

662
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:37,344
she may be able to see 'em...

663
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:40,047
He's not okay.

664
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:43,884
But she ain't got it all right.

665
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,254
They're here to hurt us.

666
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:50,991
And she's fucking letting 'em.

667
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:54,728
I know how to solve it.

668
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:02,303
John, you're cut off,

669
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:03,404
- time to go.
- Sam.

670
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:06,740
- What the fuck, man!
- Dammit...

671
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:08,242
...not again, John!

672
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:09,810
You're paying for that!

673
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:10,844
Missed it.

674
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:12,681
Every freakin' night.

675
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,416
- Come on.
- Where's the gun?

676
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:18,419
Yeah. Where is the fucking gun?

677
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,589
Where's the gun?

678
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:22,189
It's right there.

679
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:26,794
Bottle?

680
00:45:27,696 --> 00:45:29,163
Don't make me ask twice.

681
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:31,465
Oh.

682
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:35,402
Time for you two to keep moving.

683
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:36,403
Yes, ma'am.

684
00:45:36,538 --> 00:45:37,539
Time to go home.

685
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:38,673
Give my gun.

686
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:40,140
No. You get it tomorrow.

687
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:43,777
Teddy. Hey.

688
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:45,846
Teddy, let's go back
to the room.

689
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,117
All right.

690
00:45:50,518 --> 00:45:52,086
Let's get you into your room.

691
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:54,888
That guy was insane.

692
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:59,159
He's just so scared.

693
00:45:59,994 --> 00:46:02,162
He held them
to the end. That dad.

694
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,365
Foot.

695
00:46:04,465 --> 00:46:05,432
You know, my dad,

696
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:08,536
he couldn't even wait
until I could ride a bike.

697
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:11,539
I was a super-fast learner.

698
00:46:12,707 --> 00:46:13,907
Other foot.

699
00:46:14,808 --> 00:46:17,311
How could he have known
what was wrong with me...

700
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:19,947
back then?

701
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:27,221
- You know, it's weird.
- Hmm.

702
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,957
I've never been so close to him.

703
00:46:32,026 --> 00:46:33,494
What do you mean, "close"?

704
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:37,831
New Mexico.

705
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:43,538
I always thought I was gonna,

706
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:46,273
you know, make it big.

707
00:46:46,874 --> 00:46:49,009
Drive west and show him.

708
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:52,179
You know, I got his address.

709
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,916
Snuck it from
my mom's purse years ago.

710
00:46:56,751 --> 00:46:58,319
He sent it all back.

711
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:02,423
All the letters I wrote...

712
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:09,263
photos, drawings, unopened.

713
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:14,968
He fucked off back to the States
where he came from

714
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:18,540
and pretended like
we never even happened to him.

715
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:37,291
You know, I coulda...

716
00:47:37,826 --> 00:47:39,960
college, I coulda worked.

717
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:43,397
A smart job. A real job.
You know?

718
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:49,336
If you saw your dad again,

719
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:52,906
what would you say to him
if you had the chance?

720
00:47:53,775 --> 00:47:57,177
First, I'd break
his fucking jaw.

721
00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:00,981
And then I'd tell him,

722
00:48:01,716 --> 00:48:05,553
"I'd rather kill myself
than live the life you gave me."

723
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:30,738
Oh, fuck.

724
00:49:44,853 --> 00:49:45,720
What?

725
00:49:49,757 --> 00:49:53,528
- What are you doing in my room?
- Oh, fuck.

726
00:49:55,462 --> 00:49:56,531
That's my bag.

727
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:00,167
Fuck.

728
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:03,003
Uh. I'm sorry.
What are you doing in my room?

729
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:05,673
Fuck. Leaving.

730
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,108
- Did you tuck me in?
- Fuck off.

731
00:50:08,308 --> 00:50:10,377
You did!

732
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:13,280
My underpants are missing.
I'm joking. They're still on.

733
00:50:18,753 --> 00:50:21,789
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:25,860
- Seriously, thank you.
- Yep.

735
00:50:28,997 --> 00:50:31,164
Okay, fine.
I'll drop it on one condition.

736
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:33,333
- I hate conditions.
- Of course you do.

737
00:50:33,601 --> 00:50:35,837
Let's try and have
some fun today, please.

738
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:37,104
You know how I feel about that.

739
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:40,008
I do, but I don't want to be
like that guy last night. Okay?

740
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,577
I don't want to hate life.
I want to embrace what's next.

741
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,580
You're not that guy.
That guy's got PTSD.

742
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:54,388
Okay, so what's fun?

743
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:09,336
- I did it! Go!
- Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive.

744
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:13,206
Whoo!

745
00:51:15,108 --> 00:51:18,178
You goddamn hooligans!

746
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:20,280
That was fifteen bucks.

747
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:23,383
<i>I'm still shaking.</i>

748
00:51:23,618 --> 00:51:25,687
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>ever picked up a hitchhiker?</i>

749
00:51:30,758 --> 00:51:32,794
- You need a ride?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

750
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:34,929
- I'm Karma.
- Oh, uh, Teddy. Rose.

751
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:36,064
- Hey.
- Hop in.

752
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:37,130
Where you guys headed?

753
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,198
- San Francis...
- California.

754
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:39,767
Uh. We're in a hurry.

755
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,537
I'm headed to Santa Fe,
that work for you?

756
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,973
Um, I don't mean to pry.

757
00:51:45,238 --> 00:51:47,709
But did you guys
just rob that place?

758
00:51:48,076 --> 00:51:49,978
Yep. It's part of a process

759
00:51:50,078 --> 00:51:51,278
that we're working on.

760
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:54,082
Do you mind shutting the door?
We... we really are in a hurry.

761
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:55,382
Yeah. I wanted to rob a bank,

762
00:51:55,516 --> 00:51:56,985
but we settled
on a case of beer.

763
00:51:57,085 --> 00:51:59,119
Ah. So where's the beer?

764
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,294
- So what's in Santa Fe?
- Oh, um,

765
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:10,031
my aunt lives just outside
the national forest near there.

766
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:13,968
She's a psychic,
healer, hippie chick.

767
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:15,803
I'm gonna go meet her
and her friends.

768
00:52:16,037 --> 00:52:17,505
Oh, cool. What for?

769
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:20,140
We're celebrating
a family ritual.

770
00:52:20,742 --> 00:52:24,045
- Sweet. Party in the desert.
- Yeah, kinda.

771
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:26,246
It's important to reconnect
in moments like these.

772
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:28,616
I mean, the universe,
there's so many shifts lately.

773
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:31,552
Shifts. Yeah. Totally.

774
00:52:32,987 --> 00:52:34,488
So, uh, uh,
what you celebrating?

775
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:35,923
The Quadrantids.

776
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:38,626
Better than any other
meteor shower you've ever seen.

777
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:41,095
It would be nice
to see some bright stars.

778
00:52:41,395 --> 00:52:43,397
They're not stars. No.

779
00:52:43,665 --> 00:52:46,734
It's, uh, it's dust, actually,
from the tail of a comet.

780
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:47,969
Just ice and dust

781
00:52:48,235 --> 00:52:50,705
that's been left behind
from hundreds of years ago.

782
00:52:50,972 --> 00:52:52,106
Ice. Okay.

783
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:55,308
- Sparkling cosmic leftovers.
- Shit. We need to get gas.

784
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,712
I love that.
Sparkling leftovers.

785
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:00,948
So you're going
to San Francisco?

786
00:53:01,314 --> 00:53:02,817
Are you two Participants?

787
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:04,986
- Oh, you mean...
- Actually,

788
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:06,888
it really depends
on what you mean.

789
00:53:07,088 --> 00:53:08,422
Dr. Stevensen's study.

790
00:53:08,723 --> 00:53:11,458
- I wouldn't do it.
- Well, you don't have to.

791
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:13,293
Well, just not yet.
The science isn't there.

792
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:14,829
It's being verified
more every day.

793
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:18,900
Just because we can see them
doesn't mean we understand them.

794
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,300
Over a hundred billion people

795
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,003
have lived and died
on this planet.

796
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:23,137
Where did they all go?

797
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,372
There would
be ghosts everywhere.

798
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:28,676
<i>You're talking about the</i>
<i>Earth as a closed system, but</i>

799
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:31,478
<i>as you said,</i>
<i>the universe is infinitely vast</i>

800
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:36,249
<i>and that's even if our rules of</i>
<i>time and space apply to theirs.</i>

801
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:39,554
<i>I get it.</i>

802
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,789
<i>I would just wait</i>
<i>till the science shakes out.</i>

803
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:44,525
<i>Did you guys see that?</i>
<i>Is that a meteor?</i>

804
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:46,828
<i>Oh, my God, you guys.</i>
<i>It's the Quadrantids.</i>

805
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,261
<i>Let's go find a good spot</i>

806
00:53:48,328 --> 00:53:49,664
<i>to see them</i>
<i>before it gets dark.</i>

807
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,467
Come on. Let's go look.

808
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:55,670
Okay.

809
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:01,475
She's not coming?

810
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,119
Are you sure
you don't want to come?

811
00:54:11,384 --> 00:54:13,253
Uh. I gotta get
something inside.

812
00:54:14,155 --> 00:54:16,524
- You sure?
- Yeah, you go ahead.

813
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:19,961
All right, I'll be back.

814
00:54:20,795 --> 00:54:21,796
Okay.

815
00:54:23,998 --> 00:54:24,799
Come on.

816
00:54:25,133 --> 00:54:27,201
Come see something worth seeing
before you end it all.

817
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:28,836
It's really fucking cold.

818
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:30,004
And windy.

819
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,357
What is it?

820
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:53,594
Oh, yeah.
I just realized I left my phone.

821
00:54:54,028 --> 00:54:56,798
Oh, it's okay.
You don't need your phone.

822
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:19,654
You know, no matter what,

823
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:23,490
what you do here still matters.

824
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:49,717
Oh.

825
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:52,385
It looks like I won't be
losing you two after all.

826
00:55:52,753 --> 00:55:55,723
A federal judge has denied
Dr. Stevensen's injunction.

827
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:58,559
They're saying it is likely
only a matter of days

828
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:02,395
before the trials
will be shut down. See?

829
00:56:07,235 --> 00:56:08,435
Don't tell Rose.

830
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:20,715
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi. I'm looking for someone.

831
00:56:20,948 --> 00:56:22,884
I'm not sure
if he still lives here.

832
00:56:28,455 --> 00:56:29,590
You coming?

833
00:56:30,858 --> 00:56:31,993
No.

834
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:35,129
I'm not that far.
They can come get me from here.

835
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:38,833
Enjoy the journey.

836
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:40,935
All right.

837
00:56:56,851 --> 00:57:00,187
- Where's Karma going?
- On a star mission.

838
00:57:03,824 --> 00:57:07,194
Fuck, it was amazing.
I wish you had been there.

839
00:57:17,939 --> 00:57:19,974
- Teddy, I found your father.
- Hey, would you...

840
00:58:13,527 --> 00:58:14,996
Uh. For the gas.

841
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,365
Um.

842
00:58:17,665 --> 00:58:20,101
Do you know anyone by
the name of Joe who works here?

843
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:21,302
Joe? Yeah.

844
00:58:21,435 --> 00:58:22,937
He's on his way down to Molly's.

845
00:58:23,437 --> 00:58:24,772
Down that way, you'll see him.

846
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:26,941
How do you know Joe?

847
00:58:27,775 --> 00:58:28,743
Family.

848
00:58:37,952 --> 00:58:39,787
Do you know
what you're gonna say?

849
00:58:43,257 --> 00:58:44,258
Yeah, um...

850
00:58:45,593 --> 00:58:46,961
No, I know exactly.

851
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:51,265
I mean, I thought...

852
00:58:51,766 --> 00:58:53,267
I thought
it'd be different, but...

853
00:58:55,336 --> 00:58:56,203
I'm ready.

854
00:58:58,172 --> 00:59:01,008
I'm ready to tell him
that he's not forgiven.

855
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,676
That he fucked up.

856
00:59:03,577 --> 00:59:05,012
That he's the reason.

857
00:59:08,649 --> 00:59:09,850
Okay.

858
00:59:10,951 --> 00:59:12,053
I'm gonna go in.

859
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,320
Get a seat.

860
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:15,856
Watch the fireworks.

861
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,759
Teddy...

862
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,861
enjoy this.

863
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,875
Mind if I sit here?

864
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:47,081
- Now you mention it.
- Do we have a fucking problem?

865
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:50,851
You tell me.

866
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,656
You don't recognize me, do you?

867
01:00:58,926 --> 01:01:00,928
I've waited over 30 years

868
01:01:01,262 --> 01:01:04,698
to say some things, so I suggest
you shut your mouth, Joe.

869
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:08,035
I'm Charlie.

870
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,305
Joe's in the corner.

871
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:15,342
Hope he breaks your nose.

872
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:50,044
What are you drinking?

873
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,713
Whiskey.

874
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:55,316
- Whiskey?
- Yeah.

875
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:57,718
Speak up.

876
01:02:16,837 --> 01:02:19,173
Paul! Paul!

877
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:23,844
- Oh, man. Royal flush.
- Holy shit.

878
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:26,514
- No way.
- No, I told you, man.

879
01:02:26,847 --> 01:02:27,848
Royal flush.

880
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:29,049
Yeah, that's great.

881
01:02:29,183 --> 01:02:30,518
I've never seen
one on there before.

882
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,419
- Joe, that's wonderful.
- Yes.

883
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:34,088
Congratulations, man.

884
01:02:36,323 --> 01:02:37,825
Four years they've had
these machines

885
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:40,261
and no one hit a royal flush
before. It's, uh...

886
01:02:40,461 --> 01:02:41,996
Whoa.

887
01:02:42,229 --> 01:02:45,899
Hey, Paul. I... I...
It's got me 5,000.

888
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:48,102
You know,
you can't use it for nothing.

889
01:02:48,335 --> 01:02:51,573
Still. You know...
give me another round,

890
01:02:51,706 --> 01:02:53,474
uh, to celebrate.

891
01:02:55,577 --> 01:02:57,278
And one for you too, Paul.

892
01:02:58,846 --> 01:03:01,015
And you,
what are you drinking, huh?

893
01:03:01,482 --> 01:03:02,850
What is that, whiskey?

894
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:07,254
Oh. And another one
for my young friend over here.

895
01:03:09,056 --> 01:03:12,326
Oh, haven't seen one of those.

896
01:03:13,695 --> 01:03:15,996
Just haven't seen one. Wow.

897
01:03:23,904 --> 01:03:27,174
Hey, what happened?

898
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:31,178
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- You had him.

899
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:33,314
It doesn't matter
where we're going.

900
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:34,448
Teddy.

901
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,856
You need to say it
as much as he needs to hear it.

902
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:46,226
Especially because you are dying
and he is the reason why.

903
01:04:02,544 --> 01:04:03,545
Where's Joe?

904
01:04:04,646 --> 01:04:06,413
End of the night.
Time to get out.

905
01:04:06,614 --> 01:04:09,283
- Where did he go?
- Couldn't say.

906
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:11,919
- Don't know, or couldn't say?
- Just who are you, friend?

907
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:14,388
Some piece of shit,
got a hard-on for Joe.

908
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:15,824
Who the fuck asked you?

909
01:04:16,023 --> 01:04:17,391
Boy,
it's time to move on.

910
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:19,226
Don't fucking call me boy.

911
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:21,495
- Yeah, that's right.
- Hey. Teddy...

912
01:04:21,663 --> 01:04:22,863
Go on and fucking hit me! Go on!

913
01:04:22,963 --> 01:04:24,198
- Hey!
- Fucking hit me!

914
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:26,233
Enough!

915
01:04:27,334 --> 01:04:28,268
He's leaving.

916
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:32,172
- Now!
- Ladies.

917
01:04:34,908 --> 01:04:37,612
Nice boyfriend. Tough guy, huh?

918
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,448
Get the fuck
out of here. Get out.

919
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,409
- Teddy, I didn't know...
- You wanted me to do that.

920
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:11,245
You wanted to see me...

921
01:05:11,546 --> 01:05:13,247
- ...fucking fail, didn't you?
- Hey. Hey, take a breath.

922
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:16,150
Don't tell me what to do.
I don't need your help.

923
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:24,191
I'm sorry.

924
01:05:24,592 --> 01:05:26,661
Okay? I thought that was
going to be good for you.

925
01:05:28,028 --> 01:05:29,196
Good for me?

926
01:05:30,899 --> 01:05:32,132
You thought that...

927
01:05:32,834 --> 01:05:34,034
was good for me?

928
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:36,571
What?

929
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:39,674
You got bored
with what, alienating me

930
01:05:39,874 --> 01:05:41,709
so you thought
you'd wind me up for fun

931
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:43,410
and see me wrestle
some daddy issues?

932
01:05:43,611 --> 01:05:44,712
You're fucking sick.

933
01:05:45,847 --> 01:05:50,451
Blossom, how do you make
suicide pretentious?

934
01:05:50,885 --> 01:05:53,688
- I don't know. Ask Blossom.
- Okay.

935
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:56,056
I'm so fucking tortured.

936
01:05:56,323 --> 01:05:57,892
I don't even know
what to do about it.

937
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,727
You are not even mad at me,
Teddy.

938
01:05:59,928 --> 01:06:01,995
- So don't act so stupid.
- Stupid?

939
01:06:02,229 --> 01:06:05,365
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me? Fuck me?

940
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,635
I didn't want you.

941
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:12,574
The worst day of my life was
finding out you were coming.

942
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:14,107
I almost hit your mother.

943
01:06:14,308 --> 01:06:16,511
- What are you doing?
- Why would I want you?

944
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:18,746
You fucking lifelong parasite.

945
01:06:19,112 --> 01:06:21,281
She'd say, "Oh, he's gonna be
something amazing."

946
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:24,786
But I knew better. I could
see it. You were nothing.

947
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:28,121
- Are you mental?
- I didn't want you,

948
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:32,961
you stupid, fucking, pathetic...
you worthless, pathetic...

949
01:06:33,227 --> 01:06:35,162
- I deserved a life!
- ...piece of shit!

950
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:36,898
- Fucking failure!
- I needed you.

951
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:38,098
She needed you!

952
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:40,434
She had to work
two jobs to keep us going.

953
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:44,539
I never saw her. I was alone.
You can't grow right

954
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:46,340
- when you're alone.
- You were a defect.

955
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:48,910
No. Nothing was wrong
with me back then.

956
01:06:49,176 --> 01:06:52,212
I was perfect.

957
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,782
You know, I spent so long...

958
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:58,485
trying to show you
that I was better than you.

959
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:02,524
I tried so hard to be perfect.
And I fucked it up.

960
01:07:05,793 --> 01:07:08,730
You know what?

961
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,602
I don't give a shit
about what you did.

962
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:19,039
I didn't need you then
and I don't need you now.

963
01:07:50,605 --> 01:07:51,739
<i>What about you?</i>

964
01:07:53,007 --> 01:07:55,643
<i>No. No daddy issues.</i>

965
01:07:56,911 --> 01:07:57,812
He's dead.

966
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,981
I'm sorry.

967
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,550
Hmm. It's okay.
I didn't know him.

968
01:08:03,017 --> 01:08:04,284
We didn't need him.

969
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:07,220
It was always just
my amazing mom...

970
01:08:08,455 --> 01:08:12,225
and her perfect daughter,
and what was left.

971
01:08:16,296 --> 01:08:18,432
I used to get into these fights.

972
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,135
My sister was always
bringing home awards, and...

973
01:08:23,071 --> 01:08:24,171
I was the one who got expelled

974
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:27,240
for busting a girl's cheek open
with a lunch tray.

975
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:31,378
So I'm not the only one
who pisses you off?

976
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:33,447
No. Sadly.

977
01:08:33,982 --> 01:08:35,850
I messed up
my college scholarship.

978
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:37,986
I was left
with a mountain of debt

979
01:08:38,185 --> 01:08:40,722
and then I... I missed it.

980
01:08:43,591 --> 01:08:45,827
She died. My mom.

981
01:08:48,763 --> 01:08:50,163
I didn't say goodbye.

982
01:08:54,035 --> 01:08:55,937
I was just so ashamed and...

983
01:08:56,871 --> 01:09:01,408
scared that they'd judge me
so I didn't pick up their calls.

984
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:05,178
I was so stupid. I...

985
01:09:14,555 --> 01:09:15,657
Do you see her?

986
01:09:19,459 --> 01:09:21,328
I just want
to make things right.

987
01:09:24,398 --> 01:09:26,400
It showed up
after your mom died?

988
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:34,174
After my mom,
I lost my jobs and my apartment.

989
01:09:35,475 --> 01:09:38,178
And she took me in.
My... My sister.

990
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,585
I hadn't seen her in years.
And, just like that,

991
01:09:44,786 --> 01:09:46,821
she gives me a room
in her house, this...

992
01:09:47,789 --> 01:09:48,923
gorgeous house.

993
01:09:50,457 --> 01:09:52,827
My sister and her husband,
Nick, they look like

994
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,630
a jeans commercial
for the perfect family,

995
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:58,365
complete with
their beautiful daughter.

996
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:01,301
And it was going well.

997
01:10:02,036 --> 01:10:03,203
Really well.

998
01:10:04,839 --> 01:10:05,873
And then this one week,

999
01:10:06,107 --> 01:10:08,475
Heather goes out of town
for business.

1000
01:10:08,676 --> 01:10:10,578
And... and Nick.

1001
01:10:14,115 --> 01:10:15,315
Suddenly this...

1002
01:10:16,617 --> 01:10:17,719
this shift.

1003
01:10:18,986 --> 01:10:20,888
<i>He starts letting off steam.</i>

1004
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:25,459
<i>Heather's always right</i>
<i>and he's always wrong.</i>

1005
01:10:26,194 --> 01:10:28,596
I get so pissed off at Heather

1006
01:10:28,796 --> 01:10:30,998
who ended up
with this perfect life

1007
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,365
and I just think,

1008
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,536
why can't I just have that,
even just for a night?

1009
01:10:36,336 --> 01:10:39,907
<i>And I lean into him.</i>

1010
01:10:43,544 --> 01:10:46,581
<i>I wake up</i>
<i>with a hole in my stomach</i>

1011
01:10:46,948 --> 01:10:48,348
and Nick is fine...

1012
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:51,018
like nothing happened.

1013
01:10:53,955 --> 01:10:55,623
And that's when I see it.

1014
01:10:57,058 --> 01:10:58,526
This darkness.

1015
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:00,795
Staring at me.

1016
01:11:01,896 --> 01:11:03,564
It... It knows.

1017
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:06,567
It knows I've got
a self-destruct button

1018
01:11:06,801 --> 01:11:07,902
in my heart...

1019
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:11,471
and it's fucking irresistible.

1020
01:11:15,475 --> 01:11:16,944
Oh, I can be happy...

1021
01:11:18,746 --> 01:11:19,847
for a minute,

1022
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:22,049
a day, maybe even a year...

1023
01:11:24,685 --> 01:11:27,021
but sooner or later,
I'm pushing that button.

1024
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,629
You never spoke
to your sister after that?

1025
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:38,331
No.

1026
01:11:41,602 --> 01:11:43,838
I kept waiting for that call.

1027
01:11:45,106 --> 01:11:47,307
But no, her calls are concerned.

1028
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:51,579
And that's worse somehow.

1029
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:00,655
I just don't want
to hurt anymore.

1030
01:12:22,243 --> 01:12:23,376
Hey.

1031
01:12:23,611 --> 01:12:27,815
Um, look, I, uh,
I need to say something to you.

1032
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:29,717
I don't want to talk
about that stuff anymore.

1033
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:32,119
No. No, no, no. I need
to tell you something else.

1034
01:12:32,452 --> 01:12:34,387
I don't wanna talk
about that stuff either.

1035
01:13:14,662 --> 01:13:15,663
<i>Hello?</i>

1036
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:18,866
Milton...
...you handsome bastard.

1037
01:13:19,367 --> 01:13:20,968
<i>I knew I'd hear from you.</i>

1038
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:23,704
Yeah, we're just
on our way to Arizona now.

1039
01:13:24,205 --> 01:13:25,539
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

1040
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:28,809
<i>Ah. Um,</i>

1041
01:13:29,442 --> 01:13:30,645
<i>I've met someone.</i>

1042
01:13:31,345 --> 01:13:33,147
<i>That's fantastic.</i>

1043
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:35,816
<i>But I think</i>
<i>you'd really like her. She's...</i>

1044
01:13:36,984 --> 01:13:37,985
<i>She's smart.</i>

1045
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:39,820
Real.

1046
01:13:40,288 --> 01:13:43,190
<i>That's wonderful. I told you.</i>
<i>You just never know.</i>

1047
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:48,029
<i>So are you two coming back?</i>

1048
01:13:50,631 --> 01:13:52,366
<i>Will I get to meet this girl?</i>

1049
01:13:52,465 --> 01:13:53,634
Hey, um, no. I've gotta go.

1050
01:13:53,801 --> 01:13:54,936
- Can you, uh, kiss...
- <i>Teddy!</i>

1051
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:57,470
- ...Stanley for me, okay?
<i>- Teddy.</i>

1052
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,509
- That's a choice.
- I feel like it's fitting.

1053
01:14:01,742 --> 01:14:04,078
Yeah. Oh, I'm glad.
Yeah, that's...

1054
01:14:04,312 --> 01:14:05,713
Oh, I've got one too. Fantastic.

1055
01:14:05,947 --> 01:14:06,681
- Twins.
- Yeah.

1056
01:14:06,814 --> 01:14:07,748
It's just what
I wanted actually.

1057
01:14:08,082 --> 01:14:09,550
Yeah. I was gonna ask you
when you were going in

1058
01:14:09,684 --> 01:14:10,885
could you grab me
a pair of these?

1059
01:14:10,952 --> 01:14:12,320
- Looks great on you.
- Perfect.

1060
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,654
<i>Yeah.</i>

1061
01:14:35,009 --> 01:14:38,145
Hey. Teddy, we're here.

1062
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,825
What?

1063
01:14:51,058 --> 01:14:52,093
Rose!

1064
01:14:52,526 --> 01:14:54,462
Rose!

1065
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:56,931
Hey!

1066
01:14:57,465 --> 01:14:59,166
What is this? Where are we?

1067
01:15:04,305 --> 01:15:05,206
Oh.

1068
01:15:06,707 --> 01:15:08,009
Who is it?

1069
01:15:10,311 --> 01:15:12,947
Oh, my God.

1070
01:15:13,681 --> 01:15:15,116
Oh, my God. It's you!

1071
01:15:15,316 --> 01:15:17,518
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

1072
01:15:18,252 --> 01:15:19,387
Come inside.

1073
01:15:19,687 --> 01:15:22,623
Steph, come downstairs.
Your Aunty Firefly is here.

1074
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:24,492
Come in. Hi.

1075
01:15:24,759 --> 01:15:26,927
Hi. Oh, my God.

1076
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:31,165
- Oh, look how big you are!
- Where have you been?

1077
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:32,533
She's here.

1078
01:15:32,767 --> 01:15:34,635
Oh, uh, can I get you guys
something to drink?

1079
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:37,204
- A coffee maybe?
- Hi, kiddo.

1080
01:15:37,605 --> 01:15:38,939
Oh, look at that.

1081
01:15:39,106 --> 01:15:39,807
Look at that.

1082
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:41,642
Um, maybe a glass of wine
would be good.

1083
01:15:41,742 --> 01:15:43,277
You have to see my room,
we changed it!

1084
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:44,645
- You have to see!
- Okay.

1085
01:15:44,779 --> 01:15:47,748
Bring her back. Mommy wants
to see her, too.

1086
01:15:48,115 --> 01:15:49,050
Whoo!

1087
01:15:54,822 --> 01:15:56,490
You know, I forgot my manners.

1088
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:58,059
- Heather. Hi.
- Oh. Teddy.

1089
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:58,926
- Teddy?
- Yes.

1090
01:15:59,126 --> 01:16:00,561
Sounds like
there's a story. Come inside.

1091
01:16:00,661 --> 01:16:02,229
Nick.

1092
01:16:02,496 --> 01:16:03,798
Okay.

1093
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:22,950
Hmm.

1094
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:25,286
How many
messages did we leave?

1095
01:16:25,554 --> 01:16:26,720
We left a lot.

1096
01:16:27,288 --> 01:16:29,223
Just wish you would
have let us know you were okay.

1097
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:30,291
That's all.

1098
01:16:30,424 --> 01:16:32,026
You owed us
more than that, Rosie.

1099
01:16:35,229 --> 01:16:37,131
You have an amazing house.

1100
01:16:37,566 --> 01:16:40,434
Amaz... Amazing house.
It's, um, amazing.

1101
01:16:40,668 --> 01:16:41,669
It was a steal.

1102
01:16:41,869 --> 01:16:44,004
They all are
up here in the desert.

1103
01:16:44,672 --> 01:16:46,273
Apparently, nobody
likes living this far.

1104
01:16:46,508 --> 01:16:48,008
But we think it's gorgeous.

1105
01:16:49,243 --> 01:16:50,644
You ever been to Arizona?

1106
01:16:51,712 --> 01:16:54,615
No. No. Fir... first time.

1107
01:16:55,049 --> 01:16:57,384
- More wine?
- Oh, uh, no.

1108
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,620
Well, it's an occasion.

1109
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,489
Of course it is.
I'm so happy to see you.

1110
01:17:01,722 --> 01:17:04,458
- It's... been too long.
- That's not what I meant.

1111
01:17:04,892 --> 01:17:07,128
- Well, do tell.
- Well, actually, uh,

1112
01:17:07,228 --> 01:17:08,829
Rose and I have
a lot of ground to cover

1113
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,131
- tonight...
- Mm-mm.

1114
01:17:10,364 --> 01:17:12,032
- You can't be serious.
- We've got time.

1115
01:17:12,266 --> 01:17:14,502
Well, no, no.
I've got stuff to do tonight.

1116
01:17:14,603 --> 01:17:15,970
And I don't...
I don't feel well.

1117
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,338
Yeah, well, suck it up.

1118
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:21,775
Big baby.

1119
01:17:21,976 --> 01:17:23,677
- Such a baby.
- Oh.

1120
01:17:23,878 --> 01:17:25,446
God, this is a story.

1121
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:26,947
Yeah, well,

1122
01:17:27,047 --> 01:17:28,883
it's a doozy
of a story how we met, huh?

1123
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:30,519
I don't know that
I could tell that right.

1124
01:17:30,619 --> 01:17:31,652
No, you can't so...

1125
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:33,988
No, no. I can. I can.
I can tell it right.

1126
01:17:34,088 --> 01:17:35,923
Um, so the...

1127
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:39,860
the thing is Teddy
and I are, uh, taking a trip.

1128
01:17:40,094 --> 01:17:41,028
And, um...

1129
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:46,200
I really needed to see you
before we go where we're going.

1130
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:49,103
- Where are you going?
- Rose...

1131
01:17:49,203 --> 01:17:52,473
It's difficult to say.
Um, I'm just gonna say it.

1132
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,876
- You know, I left the grill on.
- No, no, I'll be fast.

1133
01:17:57,945 --> 01:17:59,346
Where are you going?

1134
01:18:03,585 --> 01:18:04,718
Rose,
where are you going?

1135
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:07,021
Just, my God! Out with it.

1136
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:10,024
Rose!

1137
01:18:10,691 --> 01:18:11,926
We're eloping.

1138
01:18:14,728 --> 01:18:18,032
What? That's...
That's amazing.

1139
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:19,400
When?

1140
01:18:19,668 --> 01:18:22,903
Uh. We're going
to Vegas tonight.

1141
01:18:23,103 --> 01:18:24,772
Gonna do a drive-through
wedding thing.

1142
01:18:25,005 --> 01:18:26,508
Oh, my God, that's insane.

1143
01:18:26,641 --> 01:18:29,009
Yeah. We're selling the car.

1144
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:31,345
And, uh, then
we're gonna go to Europe.

1145
01:18:31,613 --> 01:18:33,047
Yeah, I've always
wanted to go to France.

1146
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,617
And then we're gonna go
to Oxford where Teddy's from.

1147
01:18:35,849 --> 01:18:39,086
Uh. London. London is where
Teddy's from.

1148
01:18:42,056 --> 01:18:43,924
We've known each other
less than a month.

1149
01:18:44,892 --> 01:18:46,927
- Holy shit, Rose.
- Yeah.

1150
01:18:47,194 --> 01:18:49,363
I didn't know at first.
I mean, how do you ever know?

1151
01:18:49,564 --> 01:18:50,532
Uh.

1152
01:18:50,998 --> 01:18:54,735
But this one night, he, uh,
told me his truth, and...

1153
01:18:55,836 --> 01:18:57,738
I told him
the worst thing about me,

1154
01:18:57,938 --> 01:19:01,041
and, uh, it was okay, so.

1155
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:03,277
You marry that person.

1156
01:19:08,382 --> 01:19:09,183
We don't have jobs there yet.

1157
01:19:09,517 --> 01:19:11,586
But, uh, we've got enough money
for about six months.

1158
01:19:11,785 --> 01:19:13,354
And I'm... I'm just gonna...

1159
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:15,690
...look for a teaching job.

1160
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:19,226
And Teddy's got this
brilliant idea for a startup,

1161
01:19:19,793 --> 01:19:21,428
so he's gonna get
that going there.

1162
01:19:22,096 --> 01:19:23,063
And, um...

1163
01:19:24,064 --> 01:19:26,200
we've been making these lists.

1164
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:29,470
Um, things we've always
wanted to do.

1165
01:19:30,004 --> 01:19:31,372
We've been doing that together.

1166
01:19:32,172 --> 01:19:34,908
For some reason, we've never
let ourselves do that before.

1167
01:19:39,146 --> 01:19:40,047
That's it.

1168
01:19:40,814 --> 01:19:43,551
That's why I wanted to see you.

1169
01:19:44,753 --> 01:19:45,754
Both.

1170
01:19:46,387 --> 01:19:49,290
I'm so happy for you.
It's crazy.

1171
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,960
It's not... not bad crazy.
It's just... it's amazing.

1172
01:19:53,327 --> 01:19:54,895
Yeah.

1173
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:56,497
Mm-hmm.

1174
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:08,876
Well, you, uh,

1175
01:20:09,076 --> 01:20:10,477
you take care of her now.
You promise.

1176
01:20:11,445 --> 01:20:12,479
I'll do my best.

1177
01:20:13,447 --> 01:20:14,549
It's nice to meet you, man.

1178
01:20:15,717 --> 01:20:16,950
Hey, Ladybug.

1179
01:20:22,022 --> 01:20:24,124
I just wanted to say, um...

1180
01:20:29,863 --> 01:20:32,066
You know
that every time you disappear,

1181
01:20:32,299 --> 01:20:34,234
another little piece
of my heart breaks.

1182
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:37,237
And when you used to do this,
I would call Mom.

1183
01:20:38,072 --> 01:20:41,075
Heather, um, I know
that I've made your life

1184
01:20:41,308 --> 01:20:44,612
a living hell most of the time
but I... I left last time.

1185
01:20:44,912 --> 01:20:46,447
- Nick and I, we...
- We're good.

1186
01:20:47,481 --> 01:20:48,717
- What?
- He's my husband.

1187
01:20:48,817 --> 01:20:50,184
This is my family.

1188
01:20:51,919 --> 01:20:53,454
Then I'm sorry. I thought
you should know that I...

1189
01:20:53,555 --> 01:20:55,255
You don't need to apologize
anymore. You've been

1190
01:20:55,456 --> 01:20:58,225
apologizing your whole life
and it doesn't help.

1191
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,229
I don't need you
to fix my problems.

1192
01:21:02,363 --> 01:21:04,431
I just want you
to take care of your own.

1193
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:08,435
Honey, we...

1194
01:21:09,303 --> 01:21:11,038
- we gotta get dinner for Steph.
- Oh,

1195
01:21:11,238 --> 01:21:13,340
of course. Yes.
Let me do that now.

1196
01:21:17,779 --> 01:21:19,279
You guys drive safe, okay?

1197
01:21:24,619 --> 01:21:25,553
Bye.

1198
01:22:01,455 --> 01:22:02,256
Hey, that was a...

1199
01:22:02,423 --> 01:22:03,892
that was a great thing
you did back there.

1200
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:06,026
It was the best thing, I think.

1201
01:22:13,668 --> 01:22:15,035
What did Heather say?

1202
01:22:16,738 --> 01:22:18,272
She wants me to sort my shit.

1203
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:20,307
Right.
That's good. Isn't it?

1204
01:22:23,511 --> 01:22:25,078
It'll never go away.

1205
01:22:28,148 --> 01:22:30,618
You know, what if... what if
we just stopped right now?

1206
01:22:33,053 --> 01:22:35,723
- I can't make it stop.
- No, look, pull over,

1207
01:22:35,956 --> 01:22:38,992
okay? Let's... Let's talk.
Let's take a break.

1208
01:22:40,662 --> 01:22:43,096
Did you go over there so
you wouldn't have to cross over?

1209
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:45,667
Was that the entire point?
The... The trip?

1210
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,267
Skipping the flight,
all of this?

1211
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:50,003
I felt something,
some force,

1212
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:52,740
- drove me there.
- No. You drove you there.

1213
01:22:53,106 --> 01:22:54,408
You can stop.

1214
01:22:58,479 --> 01:22:59,747
I have to keep going.

1215
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,066
This is it.

1216
01:24:01,074 --> 01:24:03,110
Too early
for protesting, I guess.

1217
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:16,658
You have your IDs?

1218
01:24:16,858 --> 01:24:17,759
Yeah.

1219
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:27,367
Give him your ID.

1220
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:41,081
Thanks.

1221
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:43,350
You'll need your QR codes
at the check-in desks.

1222
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:44,752
Follow the road
to the parking lot.

1223
01:25:19,821 --> 01:25:20,922
Welcome!

1224
01:25:21,388 --> 01:25:23,190
May I have
your QR codes, please?

1225
01:25:26,493 --> 01:25:27,427
Great.

1226
01:25:28,663 --> 01:25:29,831
And you, sir?

1227
01:25:30,932 --> 01:25:31,866
We can't have anyone

1228
01:25:32,033 --> 01:25:33,868
on the premises
who's not a Participant.

1229
01:25:36,571 --> 01:25:38,506
Thank you.

1230
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:39,974
All right.

1231
01:25:40,374 --> 01:25:42,877
- Great to have you, Blossom...
- Rose.

1232
01:25:43,578 --> 01:25:47,381
Yes, of course.
Blossom Rose and Theodore.

1233
01:25:48,082 --> 01:25:49,617
You're a little early,
which is great.

1234
01:25:49,851 --> 01:25:51,418
Dr. Stevensen is finishing up
a press conference

1235
01:25:51,519 --> 01:25:53,021
- but, um, she'll be...
- I'm ready

1236
01:25:53,153 --> 01:25:54,154
to do this now.

1237
01:25:54,354 --> 01:25:55,455
Well, uh,

1238
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,357
Dr. Stevensen
flew in just for it,

1239
01:25:57,457 --> 01:25:58,826
- but...
- I want to go now.

1240
01:26:00,928 --> 01:26:01,896
Nurse Ala?

1241
01:26:02,262 --> 01:26:05,332
Mm-hmm?
- Uh. Just one second.

1242
01:26:06,134 --> 01:26:11,839
Um.

1243
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:16,209
Okay,
so let's see what we can do. Um,

1244
01:26:16,511 --> 01:26:17,612
we'll start your paperwork

1245
01:26:17,912 --> 01:26:20,982
and there's a video for you
to watch before your journey

1246
01:26:21,415 --> 01:26:23,951
so we can get you started
there in a few minutes.

1247
01:26:24,052 --> 01:26:25,452
- Does that sound good?
- Yeah.

1248
01:26:26,154 --> 01:26:28,188
Okay. Follow me.

1249
01:26:30,892 --> 01:26:32,192
And, uh, you, sir.

1250
01:26:32,426 --> 01:26:34,762
Will you be coming back
for your appointment or...

1251
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:45,472
I thought this was
what you wanted.

1252
01:26:46,607 --> 01:26:47,608
Not anymore.

1253
01:26:50,377 --> 01:26:52,947
Okay, so
we are ready for you upstairs.

1254
01:26:55,016 --> 01:26:58,553
Um, would you like
to watch the video together?

1255
01:27:04,559 --> 01:27:05,960
<i>Congratulations!</i>

1256
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:07,394
<i>You are on your way to being</i>

1257
01:27:07,528 --> 01:27:09,797
<i>an imperative part</i>
<i>of our Life Beyond study.</i>

1258
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,465
<i>You are ready to step</i>

1259
01:27:11,699 --> 01:27:14,001
<i>into the next stage</i>
<i>of evolution with us.</i>

1260
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:17,939
<i>You are a pioneer</i>
<i>who will forever be remembered</i>

1261
01:27:18,172 --> 01:27:19,907
<i>for your bravery</i>
<i>in building branches</i>

1262
01:27:20,108 --> 01:27:22,510
<i>between this world</i>
<i>and the next.</i>

1263
01:27:26,848 --> 01:27:27,849
Is that it?

1264
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:34,589
Okay, we are all set up

1265
01:27:34,689 --> 01:27:36,389
to track and record
your journey.

1266
01:27:36,657 --> 01:27:39,259
I'll be there the whole time
to help you transition smoothly.

1267
01:27:39,493 --> 01:27:42,530
- Um, do you have any questions?
- Will it hurt?

1268
01:27:42,864 --> 01:27:44,832
The IV can
be a little uncomfortable

1269
01:27:44,966 --> 01:27:46,333
but we can numb the spot first.

1270
01:27:46,534 --> 01:27:48,536
We begin with a sedative
to help you relax.

1271
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,470
It's a lot like
going under for surgery.

1272
01:27:50,705 --> 01:27:52,206
Once you're in
a state of passing

1273
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:55,109
and we can see that you've
crossed on our tracking devices,

1274
01:27:55,342 --> 01:27:57,578
then we terminate
your physical form.

1275
01:27:58,345 --> 01:27:59,847
None of that will hurt.

1276
01:28:02,315 --> 01:28:03,483
Are you ready?

1277
01:28:06,554 --> 01:28:08,022
Yeah. Let's just do it. Yeah.

1278
01:28:08,222 --> 01:28:09,957
Absolutely.
So you can follow me

1279
01:28:10,191 --> 01:28:13,628
and we'll get you changed
and started in the Passing Room.

1280
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:16,463
Mm-hmm.

1281
01:28:21,235 --> 01:28:23,738
Sir, do you want to step
into the waiting room?

1282
01:28:24,005 --> 01:28:25,072
Can I stay?

1283
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:28,709
It is important
that you have a calm

1284
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:31,846
- and positive experience...
- He can stay.

1285
01:28:32,547 --> 01:28:35,683
Okay. Yeah. It's good.
Come on in.

1286
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:45,293
Okay.

1287
01:28:45,492 --> 01:28:47,427
Can I push this up? Yeah?

1288
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:52,133
All right. And let me have you
make a few fist pumps.

1289
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:56,804
Pump. Four,
three, two, one. Good.

1290
01:28:57,805 --> 01:28:59,807
Yeah.

1291
01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:07,849
Okay.

1292
01:29:12,987 --> 01:29:13,855
Okay.

1293
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:17,024
Okay. Here comes the needle.

1294
01:29:19,093 --> 01:29:20,761
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1295
01:29:21,229 --> 01:29:23,496
In three, two, one.

1296
01:29:24,464 --> 01:29:25,766
Is that okay?

1297
01:29:43,284 --> 01:29:44,652
Okay.
That feel comfortable?

1298
01:29:44,752 --> 01:29:45,653
Yes.

1299
01:29:49,757 --> 01:29:50,658
All right.

1300
01:29:52,093 --> 01:29:53,393
Shall we?

1301
01:30:00,768 --> 01:30:01,669
Okay.

1302
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:06,240
- No. Just one...
- Sir!

1303
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:07,541
- No. Sir. Sir.
- Just give me...

1304
01:30:07,675 --> 01:30:09,409
Hey, hey, hey.
Just give me one more day.

1305
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:11,178
- Sir.
- Teddy, what does it matter?

1306
01:30:11,312 --> 01:30:12,346
One hour.
Just give me that.

1307
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:13,581
What if I can't?

1308
01:30:13,814 --> 01:30:15,883
Ten... Ten minutes
to think about how you can.

1309
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:16,884
I don't deserve it.

1310
01:30:17,018 --> 01:30:19,620
Five minutes
to you realize that you do.

1311
01:30:21,289 --> 01:30:22,422
No, one minute.

1312
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:25,760
One minute to think
about what you did yesterday.

1313
01:30:26,794 --> 01:30:28,396
Not... Not what happened
in the past,

1314
01:30:28,663 --> 01:30:30,097
not what happened
when you were younger...

1315
01:30:30,831 --> 01:30:32,199
and not the things
you can't control

1316
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,466
or the mistakes you made.

1317
01:30:33,668 --> 01:30:36,370
Please. Just...
...one minute.

1318
01:30:36,737 --> 01:30:39,707
Just give me one more minute.

1319
01:30:41,309 --> 01:30:42,576
Wait.

1320
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:48,816
Rose.

1321
01:31:39,834 --> 01:31:41,902
Mom?

1322
01:31:43,938 --> 01:31:45,506
I'm sorry.

1323
01:31:46,707 --> 01:31:50,111
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1324
01:31:50,344 --> 01:31:54,682
I tried. I tried hard.
I couldn't. I... I...

1325
01:32:00,488 --> 01:32:01,622
No.

1326
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:19,260
<i>Rose!</i>

1327
01:34:20,562 --> 01:34:21,962
<i>She'll never know.</i>

1328
01:34:40,314 --> 01:34:42,716
<i>She will just disappear.</i>

1329
01:35:23,592 --> 01:35:26,827
She's dead.

1330
01:35:28,162 --> 01:35:29,363
Rose, it's Mom.

1331
01:35:31,432 --> 01:35:33,000
She's dead.

1332
01:35:33,801 --> 01:35:35,169
Where are you?

1333
01:35:35,402 --> 01:35:37,004
Where are you?

1334
01:35:42,276 --> 01:35:44,411
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

1335
01:35:45,112 --> 01:35:46,146
I'm here.

1336
01:35:47,248 --> 01:35:49,316
Heather. I'm here.

1337
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:52,152
Heather, I'm here.

1338
01:35:52,753 --> 01:35:55,956
- I'm here, Heather! I'm here.
- God damn it, Rose!

1339
01:36:13,307 --> 01:36:14,475
<i>I'm here.</i>

1340
01:37:24,912 --> 01:37:27,181
<i>You can do it. Come on.</i>

1341
01:37:37,124 --> 01:37:43,330
Just... Just
give me one minute, please.

1342
01:38:03,117 --> 01:38:04,184
Rose?

1343
01:38:08,489 --> 01:38:10,759
Wait.

1344
01:38:14,027 --> 01:38:17,398
- Hey.
- I can start with one minute.

1345
01:39:04,044 --> 01:39:05,412
So, what was it like?

1346
01:39:07,615 --> 01:39:10,984
It was like almost dying.

1347
01:39:15,489 --> 01:39:18,693
I don't know.
It was all of me all at once.

1348
01:39:19,894 --> 01:39:21,195
And it was okay.

1349
01:39:24,097 --> 01:39:25,499
I knew I wanted...

1350
01:39:28,903 --> 01:39:30,204
to keep trying.

1351
01:39:55,864 --> 01:39:58,365
You drive?

1352
01:40:00,902 --> 01:40:01,836
- Seriously?
- Yeah, you...

1353
01:40:02,069 --> 01:40:04,137
- You heard me right.
- Wow.

1354
01:40:08,843 --> 01:40:12,145
You want to die twice?

1355
01:45:28,196 --> 01:45:29,297
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1356
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:31,331
<i>The car's on my credit card.</i>

1357
01:45:31,866 --> 01:45:33,301
<i>Thank God it's not on mine.</i>

1358
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,368
<i>So,</i>
<i>we need to drop this off, too.</i>

1359
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:37,738
<i>No, let's just take it.</i>

1360
01:45:38,005 --> 01:45:40,274
<i>I need to go get my dog.</i>

1361
01:45:40,541 --> 01:45:42,475
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- What?</i>
