1
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,825
What are you wearing Portia?

2
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:38,446
Whatever Zay likes.

3
00:04:45,032 --> 00:04:46,032
Here you go!

4
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:47,584
What Jackie?

5
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:49,618
That man don't want you.

6
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:50,998
He doesn't know what he wants.

7
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:52,791
He knows he doesn't want you.

8
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:53,825
See.

9
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,998
How long have you
known Zay, Portia?

10
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:05,963
Oh, wow!

11
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:08,860
Come on man, come on. Crazy!

12
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:15,825
I don't want that man.

13
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,480
I'm not doing this with you.

14
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:18,549
Yeah. Come on, yes

15
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,515
I'm not doing this.

16
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:21,032
How long, tell me. Do it.

17
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:23,101
I'm not doing this with
you. I'm not doing this.

18
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:24,135
Do it.

19
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:26,860
Since middle school.

20
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,032
Okay, here we are
now in college,

21
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:34,549
and he hasn't asked you
on a date, kiss you,

22
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,377
said he saw he's
more than a friend.

23
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,998
I mean no, but like.

24
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:41,825
Okay, then my case
here is closed.

25
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:46,515
Oh, Portia!

26
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,146
I don't know what it is,
nobody like that girl.

27
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,963
What? She bad though.
Is she persistent?

28
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:52,135
Persistent.

29
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,525
Oh, that's what you
call her? Persistent?

30
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:56,377
Look man that girl love you.
Cool.

31
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:58,629
And no matter what you do she's still
here that's called loyalty my boy.

32
00:05:58,653 --> 00:05:59,653
Loyalty.

33
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,446
Man, whatever! Craig, what you
think? Tell me what you think?

34
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,756
I mean look she a little
high maintenance, but.

35
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,446
She good for you bro.

36
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,756
She ain't nothing too crazy
for you. Crazy about you.

37
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,446
What happened? Man.

38
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,032
I mean you look at it like
this, if you go to the league,

39
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,042
you ain't gotta worry about trying to
take your prayer because some momma got

40
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,756
mad money, bro.

41
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,008
See that's the point, right,
baba got bread but she don't.

42
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:23,722
But look she's always
been like fabulous,

43
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:25,525
man, would y'all want me
date my sister or something?

44
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:26,549
Yep.

45
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,894
Whatever man, let's go.

46
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:33,963
Like I said he doesn't
know what he wants.

47
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,929
You know you want Portia there.

48
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:44,653
Why are you talking about
her? Talk about some business.

49
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,584
I mean, man, if you feeling Portia,
you feeling Portia. Whatever man.

50
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,722
I know who I'm
feeling. She pretty.

51
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:51,032
Yeah, your mama pretty too.

52
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,204
Oh, he gotta go
with the mama jokes.

53
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,618
Oh, I believe so early anyway.

54
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:58,549
You already know why we leave me early,
so I get some of these new girls,

55
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,756
new girls.

56
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,801
And you know I'm surprised y'all
wanting to go to the trailer anyway.

57
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:03,929
What you mean?

58
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:04,963
What?

59
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,008
You know I mean the girls want to
be scared out there tonight. I know,

60
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:08,584
that's what I know.
Oh. That's what we went on a man

61
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:10,273
like me. Man, exactly.

62
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:12,584
And you want to keep
coming out to the Portia,

63
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:15,549
we ain't got no time for that.
Finally, said y'all boys agree on.

64
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:16,653
Of course.

65
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:17,825
Hold on.

66
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,135
I also said meet up at night.

67
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,618
Yes, sir, we are on for now.

68
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:28,584
Oh, we're going to attend.

69
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:29,687
It is.

70
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:32,687
Only on that free time.

71
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:35,687
Exactly. Let's not
forget your complexion.

72
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:39,618
Right. So, I'm supposed
to be walking some trail.

73
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:41,860
I told you a thousand
times, Jordan.

74
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,687
It's a haunted trail.

75
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:45,111
It's like a haunted house but
you're just going through the woods.

76
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:46,825
Bro, I bet that shit
ain't even scary.

77
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,135
Well, I'm tired of doing the
same damn things, alright.

78
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,525
If you don't want to come with us
and be a part of the Halloween spirit

79
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:53,204
then just stay your ass home.
Chill.

80
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,032
No, bruh! Cause you always got
something to complain about.

81
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:59,042
Bro, complain? Bro, I wasn't complaining.
I was working your mom's last night.

82
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,618
Shut up. Just shut up.
Hey, guys!

83
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:05,791
Bro, what the fuck!

84
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:07,791
Bro, you got problems man.

85
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:10,584
Well, I went on this trail
last year with some teammates

86
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:11,825
and it's actually really fun.

87
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,722
Bro whatever, Amy.

88
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,905
I'm serious. In fact, how'd
you even get us a reservation?

89
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:19,066
Last year, it took us like
hours. I know the owner's son.

90
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:21,308
Owner's son!

91
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:23,204
You know that man
winning and everything,

92
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,929
you'll never beat him in
there. Every single time.

93
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,066
And I want you to know,
I can't drive either.

94
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:30,170
Oh, me?

95
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:32,342
My butt, my head like messed up.

96
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,170
Greg?

97
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:35,032
He ain't got no car.
You know I ain't got no car.

98
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,066
Stupid fool. Alright.

99
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:38,929
Just know we hired
the whole ride.

100
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:39,722
Yeah.

101
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:41,101
That's five feet.

102
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:43,204
Y'all gonna be had.
Hook them away.

103
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,342
Hey, you think you can
spot when we get there.

104
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:48,584
Greg, I know mommy. Man, you
better spot your ass in this car.

105
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:49,860
Oh, man.

106
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:52,170
Oh my god.

107
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:07,791
Did you know we're gonna
be running around, right?

108
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:09,653
For what?

109
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:11,963
What do you mean for what?
It's a haunted trail.

110
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:13,387
People jump out of the
woods and chase you.

111
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,377
Chase you?

112
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:15,791
Yeah.

113
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:16,974
What did you think
was about to happen?

114
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:18,687
I don't know. I've
never done this before.

115
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:21,308
I did it last year and
you were running around.

116
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,929
I mean well, was
it actually scary?

117
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:26,756
Hell, yeah. It was scary.

118
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:30,204
Maybe Zay will hold my hand.

119
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,204
You need help.

120
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,204
No, I don't.

121
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,963
Change your shoes, Portia.

122
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:36,998
Why if I can run in them? Look
the heels are thick. I'm good.

123
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,860
Change your shoes.

124
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:40,377
Why if I can run in them.

125
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:41,101
Portia!

126
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:42,135
Jackie!

127
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:45,791
Fine. Do what you want.

128
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:46,939
Let's just go before we're late.

129
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:48,411
Oh, wait, you need to eat.

130
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:50,101
I'm not hungry.

131
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,077
Didn't you just say we're
gonna be running around.

132
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:54,239
If you go into diabetic
shock or something,

133
00:09:54,273 --> 00:09:55,825
that's not going to be on me.

134
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,135
Wow! You're such a great friend.

135
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,411
The best.

136
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,687
Oh, dope earrings.
Are they real?

137
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:04,411
Jackie, have I ever
worn anything fake?

138
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,273
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Come on.

139
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:08,791
When's the last time you actually
paid for a speeding ticket?

140
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,239
Mr.! My dad is a judge,
can get me out of anything.

141
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:13,963
Hold on. Hold on. It was
only two or three times.

142
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:17,239
About two or three times. But
let's try five in the past year.

143
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:18,894
But how many of those
did you pay for?

144
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:21,066
Oh, leave me alone.

145
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:23,239
Bruh, chill!
Also, we just playing a little.

146
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:24,653
Yeah whatever, man!

147
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:25,687
Gosh!

148
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,377
You're driving, right.

149
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:31,066
Don't I always drive?

150
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:32,756
Yeah. Okay.

151
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:56,101
Bitch, I got it. Bitch,
I get on my shit.

152
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:57,653
She gonna be strange or what?

153
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:01,032
Hold on. Hold on.

154
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:03,032
She's coming in with
a big bun. Big pops.

155
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,998
She gonna be like, yes, no.

156
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,722
Oh, man! Enough.

157
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:09,308
Bruh, what's wrong with you?

158
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:13,722
I've been a damn.

159
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,396
Man, you too have followed crazy stuff.
Bitch ain't got time for it.

160
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,032
Exactly. You fool.

161
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:20,480
You got the girl smoked up.

162
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:21,308
We here?

163
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:22,342
We here.

164
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:25,963
With the grace of me.

165
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:27,342
With the grace of nothing.

166
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,204
Yo! This place is
a little empty.

167
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,860
There were more
people here last time.

168
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:37,905
I thought you said it
was hard to get in here.

169
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,894
Well, I don't know,
maybe we're late.

170
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:43,032
Well, Mark said he gave us the last slide.
So, we should be fine.

171
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,342
This shit better be scary.

172
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:46,135
You come here for
the ladies, man.

173
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,687
But I still wanna be hang.

174
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:52,722
Okay, neither of you have been
here. So, I don't know what.

175
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:56,170
I mean yeah, it could be scary
but it ain't that bad I'm sure.

176
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:58,825
All I know is this shit
better be worth my money.

177
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,140
It's definitely worth the money.

178
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,929
We're paying people to scare us.
Yes.

179
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,560
But it's totally
worth it. It's fun.

180
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:07,411
It's about to be lit. Okay!

00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:47,170
You want me to leave this bag?

220
00:13:47,204 --> 00:13:47,618

Just a little.

234
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:15,939
I heard it's a little different than how
it was a couple years ago when we came,

235
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:17,663
but it doesn't seem like.
It's a lot of people here.

236
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,273
It don't.

237
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:21,215
Look man, hey look, Mark

238
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:24,308

a place to ourselves.

00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:25,584
Come on, y'all.

00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:27,584
You should be fun

00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,687
I mean about 15 minutes

00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,756
A monster with a
graduation suit on.

00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,170

They better not be late.
That's all I got to say.

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,077

00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:40,446
You do know you can't
overdose on weed, right?

265
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:43,618
I mean I get it properly.

266
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:45,722
I gotta stay. You

267
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:48,066
Shit be like that sometimes.

Man, you got problems.

269
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:55,239
That maybe true.

270
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:57,239
Well, you just need

271
00:15:57,273 --> 00:16:00,377

About to time.

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,629
I don't know why you got

280
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:24,032
Hey, you know
smoking cures cancer.

281
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:25,653
You ain't got cancer.

282
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,308
Exactly.

283
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:31,308

00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:38,170

We're trying that.

00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:23,480
Oh, except for you. You

Girls, boy! Man, I'm just saying I'm

322
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:57,618
Man, Zay got the juice.

Juice. Juice. Juice.

325
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:03,894
You know when you scoring touchdowns

326
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,032
Oh! Bro, let me pick something

That's my thing.

329
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:08,653
Austin partying y'all.

You know you're scared.

333
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:35,377
Oh, damn!

334
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:36,377
She was asleep.

335
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:38,894

Wait, there's only
seven of you here.

340
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:54,929
We need all nine

Okay. Well, I'm Sarah. Hi.

344
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,860
I'm going to go over some things
with you before you go in.

345
00:20:08,894 --> 00:20:11,756
First if you have
never been here before,

346
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,998
we don't allow
phones on the trail.

347
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:16,239
Oh, no, come on. Jackie,
you didn't tell me that.

348
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:18,239
Yeah, she.

349
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:20,633
You ain't saying none of that.
I honestly forgot about that.

350
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:22,342
Well, somebody tried to come
get it what we're gonna do.

351
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:24,687
I know it may seems
like a strange request.

352
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:25,894
Wow.

353
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:28,860
Kinda. Our customers
have the best experience

354
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,239
when they don't
bring their phones.

355
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:35,756
This way, you are fully present and
you can experience all of them real.

356
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,446
Oh, you just gonna
drop the hand.

357
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,722
So, you could all put
your phones in this tray.

358
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,377
I'm ready for this.

359
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,894
So, tray will be locked and
placed at the end of the trail,

360
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:51,618
just fine lock box laboratory.

361
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:59,480
And who want to keep the keys?

362
00:20:59,515 --> 00:21:03,032
Oh, do you? Thank you.

363
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:07,653
So, before we get started, I have
to ask you some weak questions.

364
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:08,480
Please.

365
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:10,791
Does anyone have asthma?

366
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:11,825
No.

367
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:14,584
Does anyone have heart disease?

368
00:21:14,618 --> 00:21:16,618
No. No. No. No.

369
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:18,066
Is anyone pregnant?

370
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:19,963
Not yet.

371
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:22,791
That's it. Okay, awesome.

372
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,791
So, once you get to the end of the
trail, don't forget to find your lock

373
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,963
box with all of
your cell phones.

374
00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:30,791
There will be also the signs to
lead you back to the parking lot.

375
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:33,411
Are you guys ready
to get started?

376
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:33,963
Yeah.

377
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:35,549
Yayyy!

378
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:37,963
Ooh!!

379
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:45,791
Here we go!

380
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:08,998
What the hell is wrong with her?
I don't know.

381
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,515
What is she doing?

382
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:16,687
You better get that ugly baby out
or I slap the shit out of you.

383
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:32,377
You need to help you.
You need to help my baby.

384
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:33,732
I don't know who's
thanked you or that baby.

385
00:22:33,756 --> 00:22:35,411
Please help, help.

386
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:37,066
Got a head like a tennis ball.

387
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:40,894
She always did that.
Motherfucker dead, alright.

388
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:43,480
Motherfucker dead.
The bitch is dead.

389
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:45,480
Who cares.

390
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:48,480
I don't know.

391
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:52,687
Help me please.

392
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:54,480
Yayyy! Come on, y'all.

393
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:56,515
I don't know who.

394
00:23:24,756 --> 00:23:26,732
She smells like empty pot.
You need to go girl. Great.

395
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:30,756
One more. Come on, y'all.

396
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:51,825
Oh, thank god.

397
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:03,101
Oh my gosh! Its' so scary.

398
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:05,284
This is going to be so amazing!

399
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:07,066
This is going to be so amazing!

400
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,170
Ohhh! Come on, man!

401
00:24:35,204 --> 00:24:38,618
Don't worry! Don't touch...
Don't you touch me like that!

402
00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:39,825
Hey! Hey!

403
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,273
Don't push me like
that! Stop! Hey! Hey!

404
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:54,515
Woah, woah, woah!

405
00:24:58,135 --> 00:25:02,170
Better back your ass
up! Back your ass up!

406
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:03,791
Open the elevator!

407
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:30,204
Okay, let's go. Let's go!

408
00:25:38,756 --> 00:25:40,308
Jackie! I'm right here, Portia.

409
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:41,860
Ow!

410
00:25:41,894 --> 00:25:43,860
Who's there?

411
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:46,239
What the hell?

412
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,204
That's me.

413
00:25:51,722 --> 00:25:53,204
I can't see.

414
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,032
What the hell is this?

415
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:59,204
Jackie! I'm right here, Portia.

416
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
My bad.

417
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:04,032
Shit.

418
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,032
Let's get out of here.

419
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,066
Shit.

420
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:29,687
Alright. Here.

421
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,653
Who is this? Back
up a little bit.

422
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:33,860
Okay.
Can everyone just stop moving?

423
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,929
Let's find the final wall.

424
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,687
We need to be finding the damn door.
Shit, forget this damn wall.

425
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:56,963
Oh, it's wet.

426
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:58,135
It's probably just water.

427
00:26:59,342 --> 00:27:03,894
Okay. Okay, everyone, just
grab a hand. Let's form a line.

428
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:05,066
Give me your hand, man.

429
00:27:17,273 --> 00:27:20,066
Casey, just keep going
until you find the door.

430
00:27:35,032 --> 00:27:37,135
Wait, Zay, are you there?

431
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,210
Don't worry about me. I'm back here, okay.
Look, finding the damn door please.

432
00:27:41,204 --> 00:27:43,411
I kiss you. I don't like this.

433
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:44,446
Casey!

434
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:46,377

435
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:57,894
Look, I don't know who fought it man
but that shit stink. Stinking ass.

436
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:18,515
Please find the
damn door. Please.

437
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:19,549
Shit.

438
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,239
Alright.

439
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,032
I'll stop saying, find the door.

440
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:31,411
Hello!

441
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:34,791
I'll stop saying, find the door.

442
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:41,377
Hey, buddy, what you doing?

443
00:28:41,411 --> 00:28:44,411
Come on. Don't do it.

444
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:47,929
Man, why your hand so strong?

445
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:57,204

00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:26,377
Ya'll that was crazy! You were scared! You were

450
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:28,101
You were definitely scared.

451
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,342
Yes, you were.

452
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:34,939
What the hell is wrong with y'all? Y'all leave
me back down screaming for my god damn life.

453
00:29:34,963 --> 00:29:39,032
Fuck. I didn't saw the motherfucking wall.
I was stuck. What the hell was that?

454
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:40,032
Zay.

455
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:41,066
Shut up. Just shut up.

456
00:29:43,204 --> 00:29:44,894
What the hell?

457
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:46,273
I don't give a fuck. Alright.

458
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:48,308
Not going with y'all.

459
00:29:50,308 --> 00:29:52,135
That's a clown house.

460
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,066
I don't do clowns.

461
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,273
Wait, you're the clown.

462
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:57,584
Yes sir, that was lit. Yes.

463
00:29:57,618 --> 00:29:58,618
Yes sir.

464
00:30:01,515 --> 00:30:02,239
This one.

465
00:30:02,273 --> 00:30:03,480
No. Yeah.

466
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:09,939
Y'all trynna suck the fuck out of everything.
I'll trynna suck the fun out of something.

467
00:30:09,963 --> 00:30:11,929
Yo what?

468
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:15,480
Get out of here.

469
00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:22,170
What's up with Zay and Portia?

470
00:30:22,204 --> 00:30:25,515
I don't know. He used to be like
her best friend a couple years ago.

471
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,111
What happened? I mean I've heard
bits and pieces of the story.

472
00:30:29,135 --> 00:30:31,618
Well, our senior
year, he was just

473
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:34,032
dating this chick that just

474
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,422
wasn't good for him and everybody knew
that Zay was gonna make it with football.

475
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:38,963
So, when Portia
tried to tell him,

476
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:42,529
he thought she couldn't
be happy for him.

477
00:30:48,032 --> 00:30:49,308
Calm down. Stop!

478
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:56,170
I mean like he knew
the chick wasn't right.

479
00:30:56,204 --> 00:31:00,894
And so, then like Portia just professed her
love and that's when things kind of went left.

480
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,525
But I mean how can
Zay not like Portia?

481
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:05,515
I think he just wants to
keep his options open.

482
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:06,549
So, it's complicated.

483
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:08,204
Exactly.

484
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,204
Hey. Oh, shit!

485
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:14,204
Holy shit!

486
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,204
Hey, I know you're
new to the groove

487
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:19,032
but I like you Casey.

488
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:20,170
I like you too, Jackie.

489
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:31,480
Get off me.

490
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:35,480
Damn! Look at his face.
How did that happen?

491
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:37,515
Shut up. Damn!

492
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:41,204
Alright. That feels great.

493
00:31:43,204 --> 00:31:44,998
Bruh, what about you?

494
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:47,008
You need to close your mouth.
I don't like the smell.

495
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:48,032
Crazy.

496
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:51,032
It's bullshit. Oh!

497
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:08,032
I think eventually they're going to hook up. I
mean I can see it. I'm just like not here for it.

498
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:09,422
Yeah that seemed
like a lot of drama.

499
00:32:09,446 --> 00:32:11,446
Woah! How was it?

500
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,135
Guys, it was scary.

501
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,135
No, so scary.

502
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,170
Yeah, it was so scary.

503
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,135
Ayo!

504
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,584
Oh god!

505
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:27,042
Hey, that's what we're talking
about. Merry Christmas!

506
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:29,687
What? Thank you,
Jesus. Merry Christmas

507
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:32,101
cause we see no excitement
all fucking days.

508
00:32:32,135 --> 00:32:34,284
Thank you. Let us even see
blood. Can we see blood, please?

509
00:32:34,308 --> 00:32:36,549
Hey, slice them up. Stop.

510
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:39,824
Playing with them. Hey. Hey, man, do something
to crank for a little bit of change.

511
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:43,273
Hey! Get the fuck off me.

512
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,101
I thought they weren't
allowed to touch us.

513
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:47,963
Oh, baby. Y'all went over this.
This is like excitement, look.

514
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,101
Hey, watch his fucking head off.

515
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:53,491
I thought they weren't
allowed to touch us.

516
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:55,273
Yeah, don't worry
about that, okay.

517
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:58,273
Come on. Let's
not talk about it.

518
00:32:58,308 --> 00:33:01,722
I wanna be scared like
a bitch. Kill him.

519
00:33:01,756 --> 00:33:05,515
Hey, look, watch me.
Watch me. Do this.

520
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:08,342
Get that motherfucking. Yeah.

521
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:11,515
Hey. Shut up. Let him do what he did
off of him. You act like a bitch.

522
00:33:15,722 --> 00:33:17,549
I don't think this is okay.

523
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:18,687
That's a real knife?

524
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:21,101
Shit. What the fuck! Oh, shit.

525
00:33:21,135 --> 00:33:23,549
Come. Come.

526
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:42,825
Jesus.

527
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,653
That was awesome. Oh, shit!

528
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:57,584
Guys, come help me.
Come, help me, guys.

529
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,584
I'm scared. Yeah.
It's too big for that.

530
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:03,446
I can't believe that's how you be
on the field too. Oh, yeah. Fuck.

531
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,653
He's, he's, he's a baby. He's a baby. I'm
telling him. Hey, bro, shut the fuck up.

532
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:10,456
Oh, now, you big man. Oh, you should have did
that when the man had you about your neck.

533
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,239
Like that.

534
00:34:11,273 --> 00:34:14,308
Get the fuck off me.

535
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:18,182
All I know is I need some more action. I got. Yeah,
yeah, come on baby. Y'all come up to you, lady,

536
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,422

levels. Come on, man. Od damn.

537
00:34:21,446 --> 00:34:23,411
Hey, guys, wait up.

538
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:12,446
You having fun?

539
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,756
Of course, and I'm with
you. I was kind of scared.

540
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:17,170
Yeah, I know you're scared.

541
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:18,767
But we're on a haunted trip, so I mean,
right. We're supposed to be scared here.

542
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,791
Alright, come on, we
gotta go. Come here.

543
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:25,377
What are you doing?

544
00:35:25,963 --> 00:35:26,963
What do you mean?

545
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,215
What do you mean what do I
mean? You know what I mean.

546
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,170
Bro, I am so tired
of Zay, bro, like.

547
00:35:33,204 --> 00:35:35,170
Bro, he honestly just
be messing with you bro.

548
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:37,515
That's what your ass thinks.
Bro, for real.

549
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,629
So, you think he was playing when
he took my damn receiver spot.

550
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:41,308
One day, you're all over me.

551
00:35:41,342 --> 00:35:43,318
The next day, you want to
act like I don't even exist.

552
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,308
Jackie is convinced you
want nothing to do with me.

553
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:48,308
Portia, baby, now I
feel about you. I don't.

554
00:35:49,687 --> 00:35:51,167
You really going to
do this right now.

555
00:35:51,722 --> 00:35:53,894
Where else would you
like me to do it, Zay?

556
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:56,929
I'm telling you, you're
always tripping like damn.

557
00:35:58,342 --> 00:36:00,515
Bro, hold up.

558
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:02,525
Listen your ankle mess up, bro,
what are you supposed to do?

559
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:03,963
Turn down the opportunity?

560
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:05,525
No, that's not what I said.
That's not what I said.

561
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:06,894
So, what is you saying?

562
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:09,239
I'm saying I need my
receiver spot back bro.

563
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:11,239
And my dad, bro, I know
you're gonna be tripping.

564
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:13,239
Bro, there you go with
your dad again bro.

565
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:15,239
We were best friends, Zay.

566
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,515
And we still are. No, we're not.

567
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:21,698
Your dad gonna cut you out regardless just
like he did last week during the game.

568
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:23,618
Coach shouldn't have took
me out the game, bro.

569
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:25,204
Mark overthrew me
and you know that.

570
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,722
Come on, man.
Bro, whatever you say, Austin.

571
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:31,037
Wait, hold on. What you trying
to say, Zay better than me?

572
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:33,465
Bro, I thought you
were Zay's biggest fan.

573
00:36:34,998 --> 00:36:37,042
Hell, nah! I'm just trying to
be a good teammate, that's it.

574
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:40,042
All I know is bro I'm trying to win that
national championship this year, bro.

575
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:42,239
It can't be nothing like
last year when we lost.

576
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:45,411
We could have won that man.

577
00:36:45,446 --> 00:36:47,894
Once marked through that interception
I knew, it was over, bro.

578
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:49,894
But don't worry about
it. Hey, this year,

579
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:54,791
this year. Yes, sir. Yes,
sir. Yes, sir. I like that.

580
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:56,549
That's that energy.

581
00:37:32,342 --> 00:37:34,480
Sometimes, things are weird.
Sometimes, they're not.

582
00:37:34,515 --> 00:37:36,825
Okay, damn, what do you
want me to do? Damn,

583
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,939
what you want me to get on my knee right
now? Ask you to marry me right now?

584
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:41,618
Nobody, like somebody please
give me a pastor right now,

585
00:37:41,653 --> 00:37:43,422
so I can marry this girl, like
damn what do you want me to do?

586
00:37:43,446 --> 00:37:45,584
I want you to make up your mind,

587
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,308
do you want me or do you not?

588
00:37:56,894 --> 00:38:00,756
Do you know how hard it is to always
see you entertain another female?

589
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,756
Yeah, forget it. Oh, come here.

590
00:38:12,756 --> 00:38:13,756
Okay, Portia, look

591
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:19,032
you remember seeing you in high school
you told me, a girl was just using me.

592
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:22,722
What else did you tell
me? What did you tell me?

593
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,722
That I loved you. Exactly.

594
00:38:29,411 --> 00:38:30,998
And that scared
the hell out of me

595
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,135
look

596
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:36,784
besides the fact that you're
annoying as hell sometimes,

597
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:38,584
you're low-key perfect.

598
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:41,946
You're the best girl that
I ever had in my life.

599
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,756
And it's just easier to keep you at
a distance than to just dive all in.

600
00:38:49,135 --> 00:38:50,963
And that's just me
keeping it real.

601
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:56,653
I can appreciate the honesty.

602
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:04,066
Thank you. Look, can we just enjoy
the rest of this night and just

603
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:06,722
leave this deep ass
conversation for tomorrow?

604
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:09,722
I guess.

605
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Thank you.

606
00:39:12,722 --> 00:39:13,929
Why you always doing it?

607
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:16,791
Come on, nurse,

608
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:20,584
why you always doing that?
Oh, Zay, stop. Oh my gosh.

609
00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:28,929
Doing all that baby stuff.
Everybody got tired.

610
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:33,584
Is that too damn?

611
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:35,584
Zay, okay. Where's Casey?

612
00:39:35,618 --> 00:39:36,584
Where's Casey?

613
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:37,480
I don't know man.

614
00:39:37,515 --> 00:39:38,998
We gotta go. Sure.

615
00:39:39,032 --> 00:39:41,584
That was fucking crazy,
bro. She's been real bro.

616
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:42,618
That's some bullshit.

617
00:39:53,618 --> 00:39:55,411
All these clowns, bruh.

618
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:02,929
Shit. Fucking crazy.

619
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:08,618
Oh.

620
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:11,204
Did you come here
to play with me?

621
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,204
Oh, I gotta come play
with your ass. Oh my god.

622
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:16,549
Come on. Darling,
you could stay alone.

623
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:18,998
Don't you. I'm not the one.
Alright.

624
00:40:25,618 --> 00:40:30,032
My girls, where we going?

625
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:39,032
Just stay with us. I'm
not staying with you.

626
00:40:50,204 --> 00:40:51,929
Hello!

627
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,101
Jackie?

628
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:55,963
Why do you want to leave?

629
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:58,598
Get away your ass that's why we
want to leave. Can you, please, go?

630
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:06,998
What the hell is wrong? Go.

631
00:41:15,032 --> 00:41:16,135
What the fuck!

632
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,135

00:41:26,308 --> 00:41:28,170
Hey, what's up?

Oh, why are we here? Why are we here? I

You need to tell her how they fucking get out

638
00:42:02,204 --> 00:42:03,929

No. No. No. Let's just think.

00:42:09,377 --> 00:42:11,929
We gotta get out of

00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,732
Where do we go back? I can't remember.
I can't remember how do we get out of here.

643
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:16,101
So, what do we do?

He's so funny. They're messing
with us for you. Are you sure? Yes.

690
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,446
They're football players with
nothing better to do. Okay.

691
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:10,101
Don't look back but I think
someone's following us.

00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:13,756
Bre, there's other people on this
trail besides us. Grace, I'm serious.

693
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,825
Nothing's back there. No, I
swear. Stop being paranoid.

694
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:25,239
And are we just gonna ignore the fact that
Zay Michaels just walked by like that, like.

01:04:36,101 --> 01:04:40,032
My friends are all dead. We're at
the end of the trail. Please come.

863
01:04:40,066 --> 01:04:40,963
Come on. You sure?

864
01:04:40,998 --> 01:04:42,584
I'm straight. I'm straight.

865
01:04:42,618 --> 01:04:46,066
Oh, everything was fun. Everything
was just fine a few hours ago.

866
01:04:46,101 --> 01:04:47,273
Everything was fun.

867
01:05:24,618 --> 01:05:25,618
So, it was you?

868
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,480
This was you the
whole fucking time?

869
01:05:31,687 --> 01:05:34,480
You always know how to
ruin something, Zay.

870
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:37,584
What the fuck are
you talking about?

871
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:40,584
That starter spot.

872
01:05:41,653 --> 01:05:43,101
It was never yours to have.

873
01:05:45,618 --> 01:05:46,618
What?

874
01:05:48,101 --> 01:05:50,756
Coach would switch stuff
around but that started spot

875
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:52,101
was always mine.

876
01:05:54,515 --> 01:05:57,963
So, you telling me you trying to kill
me cause you got fucking outplayed.

877
01:05:59,377 --> 01:06:01,239
I need to go to the league, Zay.

878
01:06:02,204 --> 01:06:03,342
I need this shit.

879
01:06:05,549 --> 01:06:07,032
This shit is all I got.

880
01:06:08,722 --> 01:06:12,239
Nobody ever fucking believed in
me, not even my fucking father.

881
01:06:15,446 --> 01:06:17,722
You killed all you
fucking friends.

882
01:06:17,756 --> 01:06:21,135
Your own fucking
friends! Fuck them.

883
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,825
Fuck you.

884
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,066
Fuck you and fuck them.
They were never my friends.

885
01:06:27,308 --> 01:06:28,308
Fuck you.

886
01:06:38,377 --> 01:06:41,170
You get this shit all
fucking planned one.

887
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:44,687
Bitch!

888
01:06:56,066 --> 01:06:57,066
Fuck.

889
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:06,791
So, who's the other killer?

890
01:07:07,377 --> 01:07:08,549
That don't even matter.

891
01:07:08,584 --> 01:07:10,791
Who wants it? Who wants it?

892
01:08:12,998 --> 01:08:13,998
Oh, man!

893
01:08:29,204 --> 01:08:30,204
I'm out.

894
01:08:32,618 --> 01:08:34,170
What you mean you out?

895
01:08:35,515 --> 01:08:36,875
I should never have
agreed to this.

896
01:08:38,998 --> 01:08:40,078
So, what you bailing on me?

897
01:08:41,515 --> 01:08:43,115
I ain't helping you
kill any more people.

898
01:08:43,894 --> 01:08:45,687
I mean I can't stand Zay either

899
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:48,377
but this isn't right.

900
01:08:56,894 --> 01:08:57,894
Not right.

901
01:09:02,342 --> 01:09:05,756
You really think I give a fuck
about what you think is right.

902
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:14,549
I own you.

903
01:09:16,756 --> 01:09:20,998
And you're gonna kill as many fucking
people that I tell you to kill.

904
01:09:25,998 --> 01:09:26,998
Mark,

905
01:09:28,411 --> 01:09:29,411
let's not forget

906
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:33,204
you were the one that threw
the national championship game.

907
01:09:35,273 --> 01:09:37,894
You wouldn't want millions of
fans to know that now, would you?

908
01:09:39,722 --> 01:09:41,894
I can't let you keep
holding that over my head.

909
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:44,722
Mark,

910
01:09:45,584 --> 01:09:46,584
think!

911
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:50,144
Think about what your
father was saying.

912
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:53,929
My star quarterback son

913
01:09:55,929 --> 01:09:59,549
is a punk-ass bitch cause he
don't give a fuck about his team.

914
01:10:05,963 --> 01:10:07,929
Oh, shit!

915
01:10:10,963 --> 01:10:13,411
You tell him, I'll kill you.

916
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:20,687
Where's my shit?

917
01:10:24,549 --> 01:10:25,549
Over there.

918
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:49,894
Not unless I kill you first.

919
01:11:25,446 --> 01:11:26,963
Oh, fuck!

920
01:11:28,204 --> 01:11:32,860
Casey laughed at me. Amy laughed
at me. Jordan laughed at me.

921
01:11:34,446 --> 01:11:35,963
Fuck you.

922
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:43,342
Ah fuck!

923
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:03,377
You can dream this is all
part of a fucking play, huh?

924
01:12:03,411 --> 01:12:05,101
Exactly.

925
01:12:05,135 --> 01:12:09,515
All I needed to do is get
your fucking ass here.

926
01:12:09,549 --> 01:12:12,653
I couldn't just kill you. I
had to make it look random.

927
01:12:22,998 --> 01:12:23,998
Come on.

928
01:12:58,549 --> 01:13:01,894
Help! Go, get him! Go, get him!

929
01:13:01,929 --> 01:13:05,101
Why would he do that?

930
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:06,756
Help!

931
01:13:12,618 --> 01:13:15,411
Help! We need help!

932
01:13:30,549 --> 01:13:33,894
Help! Help!

933
01:13:33,929 --> 01:13:35,101
Girl, look!

934
01:13:35,135 --> 01:13:37,687
We need help. We
need help please.

935
01:13:37,722 --> 01:13:40,082
This is the best haunted trial
I've ever been to in my life.

936
01:13:40,929 --> 01:13:44,066
We need help! Help!

937
01:14:08,998 --> 01:14:10,894
Help!

938
01:14:54,308 --> 01:14:55,308
Oh,

939
01:15:22,066 --> 01:15:24,791
so much fun.

940
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:27,791
Wasn't that fun, Austin?

941
01:15:28,377 --> 01:15:29,756
That was fun.

942
01:15:30,825 --> 01:15:33,170
I fucking spared his life.

943
01:15:36,653 --> 01:15:38,239
I could have killed him.

944
01:15:39,342 --> 01:15:41,791
I could have fucking killed him.

945
01:15:41,825 --> 01:15:44,066
I could've fucking killed him.

946
01:15:44,101 --> 01:15:48,170
Fuck you. Fuck you, Zay.
Fuck you, Zay. Fuck you.

947
01:15:48,204 --> 01:15:49,549
Fuck you.

948
01:15:53,756 --> 01:15:57,549
Oh, I'm gonna fucking kill
this. It's okay, Austin.

949
01:15:58,756 --> 01:16:01,204
You'll get her next.
