NORY: My mom used to say that everybody
has their something.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,721
A special thing that makes them,
well, them!

4
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,391
For some kids,
their something is sports.

Maybe not these kids, but, you know,
A for effort.

00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,832
When I was seven, Mom got sick, and...

11
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,335
then it was just me and Dad.

12
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,839
I thought I had lost everything.

13
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,928
But then, I found my something.

NORY: It turns out my something...

17
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,043
was magic.

Oh, no

19
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,466
What's going on here
The world has turned around

20
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,096
Okay! Tomorrow's a big day
and so today is a big deal!

21
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,308
Tomorrow, after waiting six long years,

22
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,228
I head off to Sage Academy.

23
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,733
Where super-awesome magic kids
like myself,

24
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,903
learn how to be super-awesomer
and magic-er.

25
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,447
Could be scary. Could be overwhelming.

26
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,284
Nah, it won't because
I'm not going on my own.

27
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,748

What? I'm practicing hyping you up.

32
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,805
I need to let that school know
they've got a superstar on their hands!

33
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:21,516
I'm just trying to make it
through the first semester in one piece.

34
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,185
Are you kidding? We're gonna be great.

35
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,895
Go ahead.

36
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,439
Show everyone how good you are
without any training.

(CHUCKLES) Okay. Okay, ready.

- Any requests?
- You know what I'm gonna say.

39
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,906
- You're gonna say "Sparkle Fireba..."
- Sparkle Fireball!

40
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,659
For sure, no doubt.
It's my favorite.

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,618
You say everything I do is your favorite.

42
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,456
Yeah, but Sparkle Fireball
is my favorite favorite.

43
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,877
It's a good one. But it's really hard.

It's we who are going to rock Sage
so hard. Me and you.

- Well, this is new.

I wish I just had a little more control
over the wacko-animals I turn into.

62
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,834
You're still magic.
That's what matters most.

63
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:15,131
Yeah, but like,
you just think about fire and... poof!

64
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:20,093
I think about a cat and I turn into
a terrifying abomination.

65
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,804
That's why we're going to Sage.

66
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:26,474
They're gonna teach you to be the best
abomination you can be.

67

Dad, are you sure we're in
the right place?

68
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,425
Is there supposed to be a bus
or something?

69
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,136
This is where they told us to go.

70
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,680
Are you okay?

71
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,767
- I... I might be a little nervous.
- That's natural.

72
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,103
Your mom said she was nervous, too.

73
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,483
She was? But she was so good at magic.

74
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,276
Of course she was nervous!
New things are scary!

75
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,819

Big whoop, I get it.

92

That's why you're going to magic school,
where you'll be up to your magical butts

for the next six magical years.

Okay, hello! Noisy, magic children,
please, keep your voices down,

98
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,000
as there are mystical creatures
and vicious monsterlings out there.

99

We don't want them jumping out
and tearing you all limb for limb.

Wow, that is really too easy.

Okay. Everyone chill, I'm kidding.
There are no mystical creatures.

102
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:11,055

are mystical.

he didn't mean any offense.

Hey! What'd I just say about not doing
magic right now?

I wasn't doing magic!
I was just...

talking to a skunk?

Hmm. What's up with emo-Joe over there?

111

Maybe you should try talking to him
and find out.

shake hands, kiss babies.

where you...

tell me I'm a flame-throwing rock star,
because this is a lot.

I am Ms. Knightslinger,
the headmaster of Sage Academy.

00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,545
You are here at Sage

143
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:15,134
because you display some measure
of innate magical talent.

144
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,470
All of you will need guidance

145
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,557
and instruction to develop
your magic correctly.

146
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:25,478
The right way. The only way,

Now!

Sage has five distinct schools,
based on the five types of talent.

150
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:45,372
Fuzzies, who communicate
with the animal kingdom.

151
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:50,126
Flickers, who can make an object come
to them with the flick of a hand.

152
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:54,255
Flares, who can harness the power of fire.

153
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,384
Flyers, who, well, fly.

154
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:03,724
And Fluxers, who have the power
to transform into any animal at will.

155
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,141
Yes! This girl right here!

156

00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:18,072
Sorry. I'm a Fluxer. But I´m done now.
Not done being a Fluxer,

00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,115
but done talking.
Reina, tell me to be quiet.

- Nory, be quiet.
- Okie-doke.

As I was saying,

162
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,249
you have a magical talent,
and that got you in the door.

163
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,918
And by now, you're probably very clear
what that talent is,

164
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,045

Moving on.

169
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,348
We require all new students
to take a placement test,

170
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,644
to see if you qualify

- For your magic to disappear.

it will wither away,

321

and eventually cease to work.

And then, we send you
back into the world,

or whatever it is people do.

326
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,081
What possible reason
could you have for taking

327
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:41,043
a bunch of perfectly good magic kids
and letting them go bad like,

Reginald Roberts.

333
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,070
Reginald was a Flare.

334
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:14,702
But he could only express his flame

335
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:18,164
through his basement furnace.

- (FARTS)
- (LAUGHS)

337
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:25,838
And yes, it was very funny to all.
But little did we know

338
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:31,260
that Reginald's upside-down magic
made him the perfect host for...

339
00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:33,387
Shadow magic.

340
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,018
The dark side to our magic.

341
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:46,192
Magic that exists solely to cause chaos
and anarchy.

that Reginald had become,

00:27:52,864 --> 00:27:54,199
but just barely.

(CROWS CAWING)

345
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:09,297
Shadow magic cannot work
without a human host.

346
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,177
And UDMs are its sole target.

347
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:16,847
Like, how a crack in a piece of fruit

348
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:19,809
allows the rot to seep in.

349
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:25,855
That's you.
You are that cracked fruit.

350
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,150
So. You will stay down here.

351
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:34,114
You will not practice magic.
And your magic will die.

352
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:41,871
But better it than all of us.

353
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,419
I suspect there are no further questions.

354
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:50,463
Thank you. Skriff. Skriff!

355
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:56,469
As you were.

356
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:05,187
Okay. Well then,

357
00:29:05,688 --> 00:29:08,774
let's begin with my inaugural lecture,

358
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,986
"How to deal with having all
of your dreams crushed

359
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:15,363
"by smushing your feelings into a ball
deep inside your stomach."

360
00:29:15,406 --> 00:29:17,700
Now. Write this down.

361
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:22,454
Step one, take your feelings
and smush them real good

362
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:25,123
into a tiny ball
deep inside your stomach.

363
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:26,499

367
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:47,438
Welcome to Honors Flare class.

368
00:29:48,188 --> 00:29:51,900
It's called "Honors"
because it is an honor to be here.

369
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:54,736
And, if any of you do not live up
to that honor,

370
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:56,738
you will be demoted immediately.

371
00:29:57,656 --> 00:30:00,159
Now, small piece of business
before we get started.

372
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:05,373
In a few weeks, Sage will hold
our Annual Founders´ Day,

373
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:09,251
a celebration of our distinguished alumni.

374
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:14,298
As part of the festivities,
there will be a student presentation.

375
00:30:14,756 --> 00:30:18,593
Each school will select its top two
first-year students.

376
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:23,890
Those students will compete
in a head to head battle we like to call

377
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:25,976
the Sage Match.

378
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:31,899
The winner from each school
gets to perform for the alumni,

379
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,693
and all of Sage,
in the Founders´ Day presentation.

380
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:37,904
Now. On to our studies.

381
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:42,992
Flaring is more than making fire.

382
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:48,207
Flaring is the modulated application
of heat.

383
00:30:49,624 --> 00:30:50,709
Reina!

384
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:55,380
You had a rather good evaluation,
didn't you?

385
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,468
Come down. You see, Reina,

386
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,181
even the most basic Flare
can light a candle.

387
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:07,392
But popcorn...

388
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:19,905
See, that requires just the right touch.

389
00:31:23,074 --> 00:31:24,534

(SIGHS) Reina, how do you think you did?

392
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:25,178
Terribly.

393
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:28,973
I'm sorry, Professor.

394
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,102

395
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:36,648
First day jitters? Okay. Sure.

396
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,486
Do you know how many
first days you get?

397
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,781
One. Sit.

398
00:32:45,073 --> 00:32:47,200
Now. Next victim.

Let's see if you can do better
than "terribly."

00:33:31,954 --> 00:33:33,205
Not that I care,

401
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:36,207
but will we be having like,
a class today?

402
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:39,794
Class? You kids would rather sit
in a classroom instead of getting out

403
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:41,087
for a big surprise?

404
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,466

- Well, that looked painful.
- Extremely.

00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:32,972
So, what did I do wrong?
How do you fly that thing?

413
00:34:33,014 --> 00:34:35,141
Um, you don't. You sweep with it.

414
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,811
It's not a flying broom,
it's a broom broom.

415
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:39,813
- For sweeping.
- I'm sorry?

416
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:43,900
What exactly was the surprise
part of this "surprise"?

417
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,363
I mean, Nory was surprised
when she fell on her butt.

418
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:50,281
- Up high.
- No.

419
00:34:51,617 --> 00:34:55,329
It's a surprise because
they're exciting brand-new brooms!

420
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,997
Look at that high-quality straw.

421
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:59,041
You think that's not expensive?
And, hey!

422
00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:01,543
If it doesn't fly,
it can still take you places.

423
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:03,838
Like, anywhere you see trash,

424
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:08,843
you can go there, now,
and you can sweep that trash.

fluxing is all in the preparation!

426

If you don't study an animal,
how can you expect to change into one?

427
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:24,525
So for your evaluation,
we asked you to flux

428
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:26,860
- into a grey tabby kitten.
- (CAT MEOWING)

429
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:29,112
But now, we have to go deeper.

430
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:31,698
And you have to learn how
to flux into

431
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,742
this exact kitten.

432
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:37,412
Once you've mastered that,
then and only then

can you advance to chickens.

434

that make her, her.

to the ovals on the pads of her paws.

443
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:14,825
Focus on them.

444
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:20,164
Take a mental picture and store it
deep in your consciousness.

00:58:39,928 --> 00:58:43,431
- after the worst day of my entire life!
- You got our hopes up, Nory.

687
00:58:43,683 --> 00:58:44,684
Not mine.

688
00:58:47,018 --> 00:58:50,147
Okay, mine. But I hated feeling hopeful.

689
00:58:50,522 --> 00:58:53,733
You told us we wouldn't have
to hide in a bunker

690
00:58:53,776 --> 00:58:56,529
- until we just ran out of magic.
- But you were wrong.

691
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:58,698
We're always gonna be upside down.

692
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:01,867
Yeah. At least until we're just nothing.

693
00:59:02,701 --> 00:59:05,412
- Just people.
- Accountants. Dog groomers.

694
00:59:05,955 --> 00:59:07,915
PEPPER: That's why the silent treatment.

695
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,959
Get used to it.

696
00:59:12,294 --> 00:59:14,212
I honestly thought
it was gonna work out.

697
00:59:14,254 --> 00:59:16,339
Because I always think things
are gonna work out.

698
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:19,509
Now I know they won't and...

699
00:59:20,761 --> 00:59:21,762
I´m sorry.

700
00:59:22,596 --> 00:59:24,931
- I'm sorry I let you down.
- Okay.

701
00:59:24,973 --> 00:59:26,808
- (THUDS)
- Butts outta seats!

702
00:59:27,393 --> 00:59:31,105
Come on!
Butts minus seats equals you.

703
00:59:31,814 --> 00:59:34,399
- Math!
- Where are we going?

704
00:59:34,942 --> 00:59:37,236
On a date with destiny.

705
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:46,120
Outside. We're just going outside.
It's nice out. Come on!

706
00:59:49,665 --> 00:59:52,585
Okay. So, Nory apologized to all of you,
right?

707
00:59:52,627 --> 00:59:54,962
But what exactly did she do wrong?

708
00:59:55,629 --> 00:59:58,089
Hmm? I'll tell ya.

709
00:59:59,466 --> 01:00:01,468
She dared to think she could be more

710
01:00:01,509 --> 01:00:04,430
than what Sage told her she was.
A UDM.

711
01:00:05,096 --> 01:00:06,848
A hard-luck case with broken magic.

712
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,643
A useless anomaly
to be forced into the darkness,

713
01:00:09,685 --> 01:00:11,395
never to be thought of again.

714
01:00:11,437 --> 01:00:14,357
And I sat there at my desk,
and I let her apologize to you.

715
01:00:14,899 --> 01:00:18,527
When, like, really,
I should have been the one apologizing.

716
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:21,322
- Why should you apologize?
- Yeah,

717
01:00:21,364 --> 01:00:23,324
- you're just doing your job.
- Sort of.

718
01:00:24,991 --> 01:00:26,076
My job...

719
01:00:27,035 --> 01:00:28,745
My job for years

720
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,500
has been to watch class after class
of UDMs come here,

721
01:00:32,959 --> 01:00:36,754
get their dreams squashed,
and leave here broken.

722
01:00:39,131 --> 01:00:41,926
And I have hated every second of it.

723
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:45,428
- But you kept doing it.
- I did.

724
01:00:46,138 --> 01:00:49,475
Because Sage made me feel like
I had nothing to offer.

725
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:52,520
But as long as I did what they said,
I could stay here.

726
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,522
But I can't do that anymore.

727
01:00:57,692 --> 01:00:59,110
That ends today.

728
01:01:00,027 --> 01:01:03,406
And that ends today because of Nory.

729
01:01:03,864 --> 01:01:08,119
For the first time in
a lot of years, Nory, you...

730
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:10,787
you made me a believer.

731
01:01:11,622 --> 01:01:14,375
You made me believe that UDMs

732
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:17,252
could be more than what Sage
tells them. So much more.

733
01:01:17,294 --> 01:01:19,171
How? With my stupid magic?

734
01:01:19,422 --> 01:01:22,341
Dude. There is nothing stupid
or upside down

735
01:01:22,382 --> 01:01:24,093
- about your magic.
- But Sage...

736
01:01:24,134 --> 01:01:28,221
Exactly, Sage. Sage told you
your magic is upside down.

737
01:01:28,263 --> 01:01:29,973
But do you actually think that?

738
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:34,645
Any of you. Nory,
when you first discovered your powers,

739
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:38,733
were you like, "Oh, nuts, I can do magic,
but it's wrong."

740
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:45,072
No! I thought, "I can do magic,
and that's cool as heck."

741
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:48,241
And I still think that.
Even if it's wonky.

742
01:01:48,283 --> 01:01:50,535
Even if it's upside down.
Even if it doesn't fit in with...

743
01:01:50,995 --> 01:01:54,080
- "The Sage way."
- ...the Sage way.

744
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,460
I'm never gonna be magic
the Sage way.

745
01:01:59,169 --> 01:02:02,756
Never ever.
None of us are. And you know what?

746
01:02:04,424 --> 01:02:06,760
I don't care.

747
01:02:07,594 --> 01:02:09,430
I can be magic my way.

748
01:02:09,471 --> 01:02:12,432
We all can!
We can all be magic our way.

749
01:02:12,475 --> 01:02:16,103
Yes! You guys all have amazing powers.

750
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:19,815
You just have to learn how to harness them
and master them.

751
01:02:19,857 --> 01:02:22,526
Yeah? And who's gonna teach us that?

752
01:02:22,942 --> 01:02:27,281
Well, I don't really see anyone else here,
so, I guess...

753
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:28,950
me?

754
01:02:30,743 --> 01:02:32,745
Sorry, um, you?

755
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:38,084
Yeah, I mean, you're great at raking

756
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,419
and letting us chew gum in class...

757
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,754
But what can you teach us
about magic?

758
01:02:44,172 --> 01:02:46,801
You know what?
Valid concerns, all of those.

759
01:02:48,843 --> 01:02:49,886
Let me show you something.

760
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,061
(SINGING) Calling all creatures

761
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:01,524
Feathered, fluffy, furry, fuzzy

762
01:03:01,564 --> 01:03:05,026
They all wanna meet ya

763
01:03:05,069 --> 01:03:07,989
Now we're talking, chirping, squawking

764
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:10,783
You see, I can teach y'all

765
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:16,455
And now you all know why

766
01:03:18,957 --> 01:03:21,418
Wait, you're a Fuzzy?

767
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:24,839
Uh. Correction. I'm an upside-down Fuzzy.

768
01:03:25,672 --> 01:03:28,633
Check it out.
Hey, dude, get off my shoulder.

769
01:03:31,928 --> 01:03:35,223
(SINGS) Get off my shoulder

770
01:03:35,265 --> 01:03:40,562
Now it's time to fly

771
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,984
See, the Sage way to be a Fuzzy
does not involve dope jams.

772
01:03:46,277 --> 01:03:50,156
But it is my way to be a Fuzzy,
and if I say so myself,

773
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:51,489
it is dynamite.

774
01:03:51,531 --> 01:03:54,035
Wait, so your magic
didn't fade after a year?

775
01:03:54,076 --> 01:03:57,038
Let me explain.
See, I came to Sage as an orphan.

776
01:03:57,538 --> 01:04:01,834
And knowing I had nobody to go home to,
Sage let me stay on and groundskeep.

777
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:06,339
Eventually they let me work with the UDMs,
'cause, you know,

778
01:04:06,379 --> 01:04:08,882
it takes a weirdo to teach a weirdo.
No offense, weirdos.

779
01:04:08,924 --> 01:04:10,176
None taken.

780
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:13,428
- But you didn't answer Nory´s question.
- Up high.

781
01:04:15,013 --> 01:04:18,517
- She gets one? Come on!
- You know what?

782
01:04:18,558 --> 01:04:21,853
Let's just say I manage
to practice my magic on the sly.

783
01:04:22,687 --> 01:04:25,607
It keeps me from fully losing
what few marbles I got left.

784
01:04:25,649 --> 01:04:27,942
Anyway, you guys
head back to the bunks,

785
01:04:28,361 --> 01:04:32,948
chill out and get some rest.
Tomorrow, we get to work.

786
01:04:39,788 --> 01:04:41,040
Hey, you okay?

787
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,876
Today started awful,
and then it got way better.

788
01:04:45,335 --> 01:04:47,296
- But...
- But?

789
01:04:47,672 --> 01:04:49,423
My best friend, Reina?

790
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:53,719
- Her magic was weird at the Sage Match.
- Weird how?

791
01:04:54,011 --> 01:04:56,180
Just, like different, more intense.

792
01:04:56,681 --> 01:04:58,099
- Oh, well, I'm sure...
- I mean,

793
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,893
she's probably been working
really hard to sharpen her powers.

794
01:05:01,227 --> 01:05:03,270
I guess they probably are different.

795
01:05:03,603 --> 01:05:06,357
- Yeah, totally.
- I could just go talk to her about it.

796
01:05:06,607 --> 01:05:08,109
- You could...
- I will.

797
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:11,569
Thanks for helping me out, Andres!
You give really good advice.

798
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:15,449
Glad I could help.

799
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:31,381
- (GASPS)
- Good evening.

800
01:05:32,382 --> 01:05:33,676
What are you doing here?

801
01:05:33,718 --> 01:05:35,844
I just wanted to offer my congratulations.

802
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:39,180
On winning the Sage Match,
and on the ensuing...

803
01:05:40,223 --> 01:05:41,225
fireworks.

804
01:05:42,685 --> 01:05:43,811
What was that?

805
01:05:45,353 --> 01:05:47,564
I could have killed my friend!

806
01:05:47,605 --> 01:05:51,192
Well, the thing about this particular book
of magic is it's not really an...

807
01:05:51,902 --> 01:05:53,279
"a la carte" situation.

808
01:05:55,448 --> 01:05:57,616
You can't pick just one thing from it.

809
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:00,453
Not without some...

810
01:06:01,203 --> 01:06:02,330
side effects.

811
01:06:08,377 --> 01:06:09,378
Get out!

812
01:06:11,129 --> 01:06:12,589
And take the book with you.

813
01:06:24,185 --> 01:06:25,436
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

814
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,814
I said take the book!

815
01:06:30,857 --> 01:06:34,152
You did. Just now. Real loud.

816
01:06:38,114 --> 01:06:40,700
Hey, hey, Reina!

817
01:06:41,618 --> 01:06:43,203
Wait, you're not supposed to be in here.

818
01:06:43,703 --> 01:06:46,707
I mean, technically I´m not supposed to be
anywhere.

819
01:06:46,748 --> 01:06:48,417
Okay, what's up? Can I come in?

820
01:06:49,919 --> 01:06:53,506
Uh, I'm tired. It's been a long day.
I need to sleep.

821
01:06:53,881 --> 01:06:55,549
We'll catch up later, I promise.

822
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:56,968
- But...
- Nory, go.

823
01:06:59,053 --> 01:07:01,388
- Please.
- Okay, but...

824
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,426
(GRUNTS)

825
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:27,305
So, in order to sharpen our magic
we need to turn ourselves into pretzels?

826
01:07:27,847 --> 01:07:30,517
Well, sort of. Here's the thing,

827
01:07:30,767 --> 01:07:33,646
I've been observing this school's
training techniques for years.

828
01:07:33,687 --> 01:07:36,982
And it's fine, for them.
But in my noggin,

829
01:07:37,274 --> 01:07:40,026
I´ve been coming up
with a counter-curriculum for UDMs.

830
01:07:41,403 --> 01:07:42,655
Stuff like this...

831
01:07:43,071 --> 01:07:46,117
- is a big part of it.
- Why?

832
01:07:46,158 --> 01:07:47,993
Because, we gotta focus all that

833
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:50,954
jiggety-jaggety puberty energy
you guys have.

834
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:54,249
Control your bodies, control your powers.

835
01:07:55,126 --> 01:07:56,209
Now...

836
01:07:56,627 --> 01:07:59,588
(INHALES, EXHALES)

837
01:08:01,256 --> 01:08:02,383
...focus on your power.

838
01:08:03,508 --> 01:08:05,260
Picture it in your mind's eye.

839
01:08:05,303 --> 01:08:08,888
And picture it doing exactly
what you want it to do.

840
01:08:10,515 --> 01:08:13,602
Elliot, what do you want your power
to do?

841
01:08:13,644 --> 01:08:16,396
I want to be able to shoot fire
like the other Flares.

842
01:08:16,646 --> 01:08:17,981
Okay, well, you can't.

843
01:08:18,024 --> 01:08:20,610
It's like asking an orange
to be a pickup truck.

844
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:22,611
It ain't gonna happen, right?
But...

845
01:08:22,986 --> 01:08:25,239
what do you want your power to do?

846
01:08:28,868 --> 01:08:32,913
I guess, I want to be able to control it.

847
01:08:33,497 --> 01:08:36,499
Like, make smoke go
where I want it to go?

848
01:08:36,542 --> 01:08:38,753
Yes! Fam, you see that?

849
01:08:38,793 --> 01:08:42,506
Don't focus on what you can't do.
Focus on what you can do.

850
01:08:42,547 --> 01:08:45,175
And do it as well as you possibly can.

851
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:47,093
Pepper.

852
01:08:48,095 --> 01:08:51,682
I wanna be able to push things away
from me when I wanna.

853
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:55,310
- Like you.
- Oh. Right.

854
01:08:55,727 --> 01:08:58,647
You know what? That's perfect.
We can do that.

855
01:08:59,105 --> 01:09:00,065
Nory.

856
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:02,818
I want to be able to choose what animal
I flux into.

857
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:06,614
- Oh, come on, animal?
- Sorry. Animals.

858
01:09:06,655 --> 01:09:07,781
Boom!

859
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:09,492
Andres.

860
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:13,120
My man!

861
01:09:13,995 --> 01:09:16,873
- I don't know.
- Okay. Well, you know what?

862
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:20,169
Be with that for now.
Embrace the uncertainty.

863
01:09:20,418 --> 01:09:24,089
Because I have got a plan for you.
I promise.

864
01:09:33,848 --> 01:09:37,727
This is your plan? A hose?
A hose is your plan?

865
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:41,232
It's a prelude to a plan.
Okay? Let me ask you this.

866
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:44,484
Have you ever just tried
to see how far up you go?

867
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:45,735
No.

868
01:09:45,778 --> 01:09:49,656
Look, my mom told me that if I didn't
have my bag, I´d just fly away into space,

869
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:51,951
and be gone forever,
and I'd get sucked into a black hole,

870
01:09:51,993 --> 01:09:55,870
- and my eyes would pop out of my head...
- Your mom has a really vivid imagination.

871
01:09:55,913 --> 01:09:58,833
Now. Hear me out.
Drop the bag.

872
01:10:00,543 --> 01:10:02,169
I... I can't.

873
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:05,881
Um, counterpoint, you totally can.

874
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:09,051
You got this.

875
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:10,928
Okay.

876
01:10:29,904 --> 01:10:32,157
(CHUCKLING)

877
01:10:32,908 --> 01:10:37,538
- Whoo! This is amazing!
- SKRIFF: Okay. I'm letting go.

878
01:10:42,501 --> 01:10:43,543
Hey!

879
01:10:46,087 --> 01:10:47,130
Whoo!

880
01:10:48,673 --> 01:10:51,092
I'm not in space!
My eyes are still in my head!

881
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,846
Yeah, they sure are!
And, hey, I hope you know!

882
01:10:53,887 --> 01:10:57,515
That's faster than any Flyer
can launch, Rocket-boy!

883
01:10:57,934 --> 01:10:59,101
I do now!

884
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:01,729
I love it! That's me! Rocket-boy!

885
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:04,856
Okay, so, the thing we're gonna work on
with you,

886
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:07,068
is controlling all that launch power.

887
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,403
- Sound good?
- Sounds great!

888
01:11:09,904 --> 01:11:13,366
- Uh, can you help me get down?
- Yeah, right.

889
01:11:29,214 --> 01:11:33,468
If I didn't know any better,
which I do, I´d say

890
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:36,513
you're making me rake while you
lean against that tree and do nothing.

891
01:11:36,555 --> 01:11:40,017
I mean, I would do it,
but you're real good with that rake.

892
01:11:40,059 --> 01:11:42,102
Like, you push the leaves with it,

893
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:45,481
and the leaves go
where you want them to go.

894
01:11:51,153 --> 01:11:53,030
I bet there's an easier way to do it.

895
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:06,543
(RUSTLING)

896
01:12:09,046 --> 01:12:10,172
No!

897
01:12:11,548 --> 01:12:13,466
Not quite there yet.

898
01:12:21,516 --> 01:12:25,061
Okay, they've been wanting me to get rid
of this beehive for, like, a minute.

899
01:12:25,104 --> 01:12:26,646
So, here's the plan.

900
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:29,691
I'm gonna knock it down,
and then you're gonna smoke 'em out.

901
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:33,195
- I am? When?
- Right about...

902
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:36,324
now!

903
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:42,413
- Oh, close. Really close.
- What about the bees?

904
01:12:44,623 --> 01:12:49,586
(SINGS) Bees, let me offer my apologies

905
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:52,173
But we need you

906
01:12:52,213 --> 01:12:56,927
To find another hive

907
01:12:56,968 --> 01:12:59,721
And we thank you in advance

908
01:12:59,763 --> 01:13:05,060
Bye-bye

909
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:24,997
Exactly how many of these things
do I have to do?

910
01:13:25,413 --> 01:13:28,917
- Um, like, a million zillion.
- But it's so boring.

911
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:30,711
OMG, I know.

912
01:13:30,753 --> 01:13:33,089
I mean, it's almost like you're learning
how to visualize

913
01:13:33,129 --> 01:13:36,467
and physically manifest
animal combinations.

914
01:13:38,427 --> 01:13:39,470
Touché.

915
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:42,431
Here, take a break.
The dritten can wait.

916
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:44,391
Wait, what's a dritten?

917
01:13:45,267 --> 01:13:48,354
A dragon-kitten, dritten.

918
01:13:49,271 --> 01:13:53,734
- Dritten. I like it.
- Yeah, this is a dritten.

919
01:13:54,193 --> 01:13:55,820
That's a kittiphant.

920
01:13:56,153 --> 01:13:57,780
That's a sharkitten,
and so on.

921
01:13:57,821 --> 01:14:01,367
Like, the more you can see
and know and name these things,

922
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:03,953
the more you can fully be them. Right?

923
01:14:04,829 --> 01:14:05,830
Right.

924
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:09,874
Dritten. Dritten. Dritten. Dritten.

925
01:14:10,418 --> 01:14:13,587
Oh, no
What's going on here

926
01:14:13,628 --> 01:14:16,506
My world is turned around
And I'm upside down

927
01:14:16,548 --> 01:14:19,510
Like, oh, oh, right out of nowhere...

928
01:14:19,552 --> 01:14:20,553
What?

929
01:14:20,595 --> 01:14:23,681
My feet are up off the ground
And I'm upside down...

930
01:14:23,722 --> 01:14:24,890
Nice!

931
01:14:24,931 --> 01:14:28,310
All of a sudden the bottom floor
Is the top floor

932
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:31,439
The top floor beneath my feet
And man it feels so low

933
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,775
Everything's changing
This situation's taking me on a ride

934
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:38,738
All over, around now, chasing me down
And I got no place to hide

935
01:14:38,779 --> 01:14:40,196
If everyone could walk...

936
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,824
Because you're wonky.

937
01:14:42,074 --> 01:14:45,828
The king of that world no one would dare
To knock on my door botherin' me

938
01:14:45,869 --> 01:14:49,372
I'm feelin' the speed
Been feeling this H-E-A-T

939
01:14:49,414 --> 01:14:53,252
Inevitable, it's out of control
Turning me inside out and upside down

940
01:14:53,502 --> 01:14:56,464
Oh, no
What's going on here

941
01:14:56,504 --> 01:14:59,633
My world has turned around
And I'm upside down

942
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:01,927
Like, oh, oh

943
01:15:01,968 --> 01:15:04,012
Right outta nowhere

944
01:15:04,055 --> 01:15:08,184
My feet are up off the ground
And I'm upside down now

945
01:15:08,225 --> 01:15:11,437
Knocked down, right down
Down, down, down

946
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:15,024
Smacked down, right down
Down, down, down

947
01:15:15,065 --> 01:15:18,443
Man down, man down
Down, down, down

948
01:15:18,485 --> 01:15:22,155
So, turn around right now
Down, down, down

949
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:24,825
My world's flipped inside and out
I've been in a cloud, but now

950
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:27,328
Instead of livin' it up
I'm livin' it down

951
01:15:27,578 --> 01:15:29,538
Looked as a clown
The frown I've caused

952
01:15:29,872 --> 01:15:31,582
Assume you're the king
Then do a few things

953
01:15:31,623 --> 01:15:32,958
Don't think there's a price to pay

954
01:15:32,999 --> 01:15:36,294
But look at me now, I've been in a cage
And put my life on delay

955
01:15:44,302 --> 01:15:45,637
- Meow!
- Meow!

956
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:54,397
Upside down now

957
01:15:54,437 --> 01:15:58,150
Knocked down, right down
Down, down, down

958
01:15:58,191 --> 01:16:01,611
Smacked down, right down
Down, down, down

959
01:16:01,654 --> 01:16:05,156
Man down, man down
Down, down, down...

960
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:08,703
So turn around right now
Down, down, down

961
01:16:17,962 --> 01:16:20,881
- You're better than all of them, you know.
- Go away.

962
01:16:20,922 --> 01:16:24,510
I'm afraid I can't do that.
You already used my book.

963
01:16:25,802 --> 01:16:29,265
You're stuck with me.
So why fight it?

964
01:16:32,142 --> 01:16:35,395
Just look at these fools
with their parlor tricks.

965
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:41,068
Writing their names. Popping corn.
Sparkly fireballs.

966
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,988
You team up with me...

967
01:16:45,489 --> 01:16:47,783
we can have real power.

968
01:16:49,702 --> 01:16:52,204
- Just say the word.
- No! I said go away!

969
01:16:53,163 --> 01:16:57,917
- Hey, Reina, are you okay?
- Chandra! She won't leave me alone!

970
01:16:58,336 --> 01:16:59,419
Who's Chandra?

971
01:16:59,462 --> 01:17:01,756
What do you mean, "Who's Chandra?"
She's right here!

972
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:05,885
- There's... There's nobody there.
- What?

973
01:17:06,385 --> 01:17:08,512
I forgot to tell you, Reina...

974
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,016
you're the only one who can see me.

975
01:17:20,315 --> 01:17:22,275
I'm gonna go.

976
01:17:45,591 --> 01:17:49,345
Stop! Stop running from your destiny.

977
01:17:49,387 --> 01:17:53,474
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to know your worth, Reina.

978
01:17:56,601 --> 01:17:58,729
You don't think you're good enough,
do you?

979
01:17:59,605 --> 01:18:04,318
You think everyone here is better than you
and you are wrong.

980
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:09,323
Reginald thought
he wasn't good enough either.

981
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:14,744
- Who?
- A former Flare. A former friend.

982
01:18:15,538 --> 01:18:20,126
He was very insecure,
but he was very powerful.

983
01:18:21,584 --> 01:18:26,214
You are even more insecure,
but even more powerful.

984
01:18:27,382 --> 01:18:31,636
He was good. But you, Reina...

985
01:18:33,513 --> 01:18:35,391
are perfect.

986
01:18:37,351 --> 01:18:42,607
Yes, good, smile,
revel in your perfection.

987
01:18:43,106 --> 01:18:45,359
Everyone will know of it soon.

988
01:18:50,196 --> 01:18:52,783
- What's happening?
- You are.

989
01:18:54,034 --> 01:18:55,952
Whether you know it or not,

990
01:18:55,994 --> 01:18:58,913
you are accepting the shadow magic
into you.

991
01:18:59,748 --> 01:19:05,295
You are tired of hiding in the shadows,
when you can be the shadow.

992
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:06,588
Say it.

993
01:19:07,672 --> 01:19:09,215
Say you're tired.

994
01:19:10,133 --> 01:19:13,346
- I'm tired!
- Then wake up.

995
01:19:20,144 --> 01:19:23,271
Hey! Sparkplugs!
Any of you seen Reina?

996
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:27,318
Well! If it isn't the UDM
who nearly destroyed the Founders Hall

997
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,196
by turning into some kind
of crazy monster.

998
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:35,158
(LAUGHS) Yeah, and I was in a good mood.
But now, I´m in a bad mood.

999
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:38,244
- She went that way.
- Thanks.

1000
01:19:50,591 --> 01:19:53,468
- We are awake.
- Reina!

1001
01:19:58,641 --> 01:20:00,810
We are not Reina.

1002
01:20:01,769 --> 01:20:06,440
We are the thing
that has been waiting all these years.

1003
01:20:07,732 --> 01:20:09,110
Shadow magic.

1004
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:12,613
- So you don't only prey on UDMs.
- Of course not.

1005
01:20:14,406 --> 01:20:17,827
But soon we will prey on everyone.

1006
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:22,539
We will bring this entire school
to its knees.

1007
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,293
But for now...

1008
01:20:26,668 --> 01:20:29,379
we will start with you!

1009
01:20:33,592 --> 01:20:38,180
- Reina, I'm gonna save you. I promise.
- We do not need saving!

1010
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:45,146
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

1011
01:20:49,065 --> 01:20:51,068
C'mon, dorks, tell me where she went.

1012
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:53,696
If anyone from the school
sees her out there after curfew,

1013
01:20:53,738 --> 01:20:54,905
we're all hosed.

1014
01:20:54,946 --> 01:20:57,783
- How'd you even know she snuck out?
- Um, a little bird told me.

1015
01:20:58,034 --> 01:21:00,786
Literally. His name's Todd.
Todd the little bird.

1016
01:21:00,828 --> 01:21:04,415
Skriff! Reina! Shadow magic, the school.

1017
01:21:04,457 --> 01:21:06,167
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

1018
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:09,337
My best friend Reina
has been acting weird,

1019
01:21:09,378 --> 01:21:13,090
and her magic wasn't hers.
But it's because the shadow magic got her.

1020
01:21:13,132 --> 01:21:15,635
And she said it's gonna bring
the entire school to its knees!

1021
01:21:17,802 --> 01:21:18,803

to Knightslinger right now and tell her.

You think she's gonna believe you,
after everything you've pulled?

1040

Then nobody will be able to help you.

- We can get some rest.

for anything tomorrow. Okay?

Okay. Well, I guess this is the part
where I should probably...

1047
01:23:08,163 --> 01:23:10,749
say something inspiring. So, um...

1048
01:23:13,209 --> 01:23:14,919
something inspiring.

1049
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:21,677
Did you mean to say that you believe
in each and every one of us,

1050
01:23:21,718 --> 01:23:24,430
and that as long as we have faith
in ourselves, and each other,

1051
01:23:24,471 --> 01:23:26,139
there's no evil we can't conquer?

01:23:27,391 --> 01:23:28,434
Maybe?

1053
01:23:29,226 --> 01:23:34,272
And that even though the school sees us
as a bunch of mess-ups and wackos,

1054
01:23:34,315 --> 01:23:37,568
we're gonna save them anyway
because that's the right thing to do.

1055
01:23:37,985 --> 01:23:39,278
Yeah, that's pretty...

1056
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,865
And no matter what happens,
no matter how today turns out,

1057
01:23:43,365 --> 01:23:47,619
we can say that we gave it our all
by doing the thing we do best,

1058
01:23:47,662 --> 01:23:49,372
