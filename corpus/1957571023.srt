- I don't believe it, either.

12
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,757
Why don't you go in
there and see?

Mommy, Jake's scaring me!

21
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:27,870
- [Seth] Hey, what's going on?

22
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:29,263
- [Daphne] Jake's scaring me.

23
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,742
- [Seth] What are you doing
with your sister, Jake?

24
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,527
- [Jake] Oh, I was only
playing around with her, Dad.

25
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,356
- I thought I told you guys
upstairs was off-limits.

26
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:36,096
Understand?

27
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:38,489
All right, I want you
to apologize

28
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,056
and take her downstairs for me.

29
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:43,581
- [Jake] I'm sorry, Daph.

30
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,148
- [Daphne] Just don't
scare me again.

31
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,238
- Exactly, so we're all
good here, okay?

32
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:49,109
Go back downstairs.

33

- [Grace] Did you find out
what was going on up there?

39
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:53,477
- [Seth] Jake was trying
to scare his sister.

40
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:56,045
- [Grace] I thought we said
the jail was off-limits.

41
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,046
- Well, I don't know honey.

42
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:58,352
I must've told 'em a
dozen times.

43
00:02:58,395 --> 00:02:59,962
- [Grace] Can you use a glass?

44
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,704
- What were they doing up there?

45
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:03,922
- Well, they're kids, you know.

46
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:06,142
Weren't you curious when
you were a kid?

47
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,709
- Yeah, but I didn't
live below a jail,

48
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,667
especially one where
inmates are gonna be housed.

49
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:10,755
- Come on now, Gracie.

50
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:14,890
I must've apologized to
you a hundred times, here.

51
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,197
All right, it wasn't supposed
to work out like this.

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,460
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:22,898
- [Grace] Seth, but
you knew that it could.

54
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,943
- Well, we've only been
here for three dang weeks.

55
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,728
Now, what are the chances?

56
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:28,295
Besides, I think the
Sheriff's been pretty generous

57
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:29,687
lettin' us stay here
free of charge,

58
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,776
at least until our
house is finished.

59
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,735
- [Grace] Seth, look at me.

60
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:37,217
I don't want myself or my
kids living below inmates.

61
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:41,090
- Well, what do you wanna do,
sweetheart?

62
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,874
You wanna go to your mama's?

63
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,833
- No, why can't the
town put us in a motel?

64
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:46,226
- Because I told you already.

65
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,228
There's no budget for that.

66
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:49,664
- The inmates aren't
even here yet

67
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,361
and the kids are already scared.

68
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:52,797
- Well, jails are scary.

69
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,365
Don't worry, I'll keep it
all locked up.

70
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,975
We're gonna be fine.

71
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,063
- Seth, we're gonna be living

72
00:03:58,107 --> 00:03:59,848
in the same place as criminals.

73
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,937
Has that registered with you,
yet?

74
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,854
- Sweetheart, I'm with
them 24 seven, okay?

75
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,072
You're gonna be safe.

76
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,424
- This whole idea is
ludicrous to me

77
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:13,296
and to think that the town
can't accommodate us is absurd.

78
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,039
- [Seth] Grace.

79
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:18,910
It's one of the stipulations

80
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:21,522
I agreed upon as Sheriff,
all right?

81
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:22,784
I'll take care of this.

82
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:25,787
- [Grace] Why here?

83
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,093

prison is overcrowded.

- [Sheriff] You guys doin' okay?

92
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,638
- Well, how long
exactly do you plan

93
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,075
on housing these
inmates here for?

94
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:54,903
- Should be a temporary thing.

95
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,165
- [Grace] How temporary?

96
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:59,124
- A month, max.

97
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:01,997
Just long enough for us to
get the jail up and running.

98
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,520
You got my word on that.

we're gonna be all right.

178
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:51,520
- [Jake] How do you know, Dad?

179
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:54,349
- Because I'm gonna make
sure, that's how I know.

180
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,394
- I wanna go to Mawmaw's.

181
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,744
- [Grace] We'll figure
something out, okay?

182
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:58,919
- A hotel?

183
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:01,312
- Would everybody just
stay calm, please?

184
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:02,444
We're gonna be fine.

185
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:04,054
- Listen to your daddy, kids.

186
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,447
He's right.

187
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,710
Everything's gonna be okay.

188
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,933
Seth, could I see ya?

189
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,370
- [Seth] I'll be right back.

190
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,899
- [Daphne] I wanna go
to Mawmaw's.

191
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:25,815
- [Sheriff] All right,
Deputy Clayton's

192
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:26,816
gonna have the day shifts.

193
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,687
You'll have the nights.

194
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,123
- [Seth] That's fine with me.

195
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,560
I'd just as soon be working
while my family's asleep.

196
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:32,430
- [Sheriff] Good.

197
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:37,305
- [Calvin] Seth, can I
have a word with you?

198
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:38,349
- 'Scuse me, Sheriff.

199
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,137
How's it goin', Calvin?

200
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,268
- Hey, listen.

201
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:45,443
Little news.

202
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,054
We're running a little
behind schedule

203
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:48,577
on the renovations of
your new home.

204
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:50,579
- [Seth] Listen, I don't
know if you've heard,

205
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:51,188
but we're--

206
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:52,363
- [Calvin] I know.

207
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,148
I know, I read the
paper this morning.

208
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,497
Look, we're doing
everything we can.

209
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,846
We're working at breakneck speed

210
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,065
to get you in before
the holidays.

211
00:11:58,108 --> 00:11:59,675
- [Seth] I appreciate that.

212
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,939
Look, just do whatever it takes
to speed things up, please.

213
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,158
- Man, we're trying.

214
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,202
- [Seth] All right, thank you.

215
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:06,073
- Right.

216
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:11,774
- [Sheriff] What's up, uh, you
must really want outta here.

217
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,254
- Can you blame me?

218
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:16,170
I mean, my wife's not too
thrilled about this situation.

219
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,519
- [Sheriff] I told you
before that no one

220
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,695
downstairs is gonna be bothered.

221
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,218
The jail is soundproofed.

222
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,918
I'll be back in the morning
to check on the inmates.

223
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:25,788
- [Seth] Yes, sir.

224
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:28,704
- [Clayton] Soundproof.

225
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,537
[tense eerie music]

226
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,474
[scratching]

227
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,195
- [Stark] What are you lookin'
at, Pablo?

228
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:29,156
- [Pablo] The stars, Stark.

229
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:32,202
Stars.

230
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:54,572
- [Stark] Still awake?

231
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,880
- [Maddy] Like I could
sleep in this shithole.

232
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:00,752
- [Stark] I know.

233
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:01,710
Kinda creepy, huh?

234
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,104
- Kinda.

235
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,020
I'm scared outta my mind.

236
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:09,805
- What did you do?

237
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:18,858
- Writing bad checks
like your boy over there.

238
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,955
[Pablo ululating]

239
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,440
- [Stark] He's a character.

240
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:42,533
[popping]
[ululating]

241
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:45,667
So, what'd you do?

242
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,848
- [Maddy] I got caught
up in this drug thing.

243
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,156
- [Stark] Drug thing?

244
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:00,551
- Yeah, boyfriend, long story.

245
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:01,422
What about you?

246
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:04,599
- DUI.

247
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,516
- A DUI and you're stuck
in this place?

248
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,998
- Yeah, time has never
been on my side.

249
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,957
I had some trouble before
and they set bail too high.

250
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,003
You know how that goes.

251
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,093
- [Maddy] Sorry.

252
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,268
- That's all right.

253
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:22,443
I'll be out by tomorrow.

254
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:24,575
- Good luck.

255
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,100
Enjoy this place while you can.

256
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,450
- Yeah.

257
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,974
- At least you're not
the only female.

258
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,543
- [Stark] It's kinda weird
you're in here with us.

259
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,764
- What do you expect from
a small town like Colton?

260
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,332
- [Donnie] Colton's not so bad.

261
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:44,421
This jail.

262
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,642
Worst part about this
place is this big old

263
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,992
piece of steel between
me and a beautiful lady.

264
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:54,083
- [Maddy] Hey, nobody's
talking to you.

265
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:56,390
- [Stark] Don't worry about him.

266
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,304
- [Maddy] Creep.

267
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:58,218
- I heard that.

268
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:58,870
- [Maddy] Good.

269
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,004
- [Stark] Hey, it's
gonna be all right.

270
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,184
- All right, I'm tired.

271
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,446
Goodnight.

272
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,795
- Goodnight.

273
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,536
- [Donnie] Goodnight.

274
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,061
[tense music]

275
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:42,088
- [Stark] Shoulda left a
long time ago.

276
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:45,091
[tense eerie music]

277
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,269
That was amazing.

278
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:51,532
[mumbling]

279
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:59,192
- [Jilian] I'm driving.

280
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,020
- [Stark] I mean, seriously,
that was a great night.

281
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,718
I mean, you won like, nine
straight games of pool.

282
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,981
[mumbling]

283
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,897
You're shocking and
I'm starving.

284
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,595
- [Jilian] No, you're
drunk is what you are.

285
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:14,076
[tense music]

286
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:23,390
[birds chirping]

287
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,260
- Wow.

288
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:27,133
Look at you.

289
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:33,226
Look at you.

290
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,924
You're more beautiful than ever,
baby.

291
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,186
More beautiful than ever.

292
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,799
I really missed you, you know.

293
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:46,152
So much, and I understand

294
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,024
if you don't wanna talk
to me anymore.

295
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,286
I understand that,

296
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:52,897
and,

297
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:54,595
I understand if
you're mad at me.

298
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,598
I just miss you so much.

299
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:05,475
[weeping]

300
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,346
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:09,740
I'm so sorry.

302
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,788
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

303
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,922
I'm sorry, I love you.

304
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:21,012
- [Clayton] Waylen.

305
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,936
- [Waylen] What are you lookin'
at?

306
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:36,332
What the fuck are you lookin'
at?

307
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:40,945
[screaming]
[thudding]

308
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:55,134
- [Clayton] Crazy bastard.

309
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:13,674
[Pablo ululating]

310
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:29,472
- Up and at 'em, people.

311
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:31,170
It's breakfast.

312
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,302
Stay away from the door
'til I call your name.

313
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:42,572
Stark.

314
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,316
Cash.

315
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,017
Pablo.

316
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:00,503
Maddy.

317
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:03,550
Donnie.

318
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,731
- [Dispatcher] 10-54 in progress
at 913 Pine Grove Drive.

319
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:13,342
We need all available
units to come immediately.

320
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:14,169
- [Clayton] 10-4,
this is unit two.

321
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,039
I'm on the way.

322
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:20,958
[clanging]

323
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:28,966
- [Cash] Pablo.

324
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,585
- [Pablo] Well, don't
mind if I do.

325
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:49,552
Yeah, uh huh.

326
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:55,819
- [Clayton] I gotta
go on a 10-54.

327
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,821
- [Seth] Wait a second,
what is it?

328
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:59,170
- [Clayton] I don't know,
but the Sheriff said

329
00:20:59,214 --> 00:20:59,997
you had to cover for me.

330
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,911
- [Seth] What do you mean--

331
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:02,130
- [Clayton] I'll see ya later.

332
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:08,484
[siren blaring]

333
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:25,719
- [Maddy] Seat taken?

334
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:29,549
- [Stark] Who'd they let
out of the cage?

335
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:31,551
- [Maddy] I know, right?

336
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:36,991
- [Stark] How'd you sleep?

337
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,342
- Aw, my neck and back
are killing me.

338
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,909
Probably got like, three hours.

339
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,652
'Bout you?

340
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,438
- [Stark] How could anyone
sleep in this place?

341
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:50,657
Pablo was right.

342
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,746
This place smells of death
and bad dreams.

343
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:55,314
- [Maddy] What, you
dreamed of something worse

344
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,315
than this place?

345
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:58,839
- Am I awake?

346
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,275
Please tell me I'm dreaming.

347
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:04,235
- You need me to pinch you?

348
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,106
- Might have to.

349
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,717
It's all right.

350
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:09,153
I'm gettin' out today.

351
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:14,071
- Oh, yeah, you'd leave me in
here with these animals, huh?

352
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:16,944
- I can make a call once I get
to the outside if you want.

353
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,864
[tense music]

354

360
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,827
Down here, we need your help!

361
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,656

[frantic mumbling]

365
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:29,277
- Break it up.

366
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,715
[yelling]

367
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,678
Break it up.

Break it up.

[thudding]

374
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,359
Break it the fuck up!

375
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,191
The next one that throws
a Goddamn punch,

376
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:16,803
gets the pipe upside
his fucking head.

377
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,718
Am I clear?

378
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,415
Now, settle your asses down,

379
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:23,287

Seth!

387
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,551
Seth, what are you doing?

[tense eerie music]

389
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:00,471

the kids in bed?

390
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:03,518
- [Grace] Yeah.

391
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:07,957

[frantic mumbling]

397
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:22,815
- Hit the man, Mick.

398
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:24,991
- [Man] Get him, get him.

399
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:27,733
- [Man] Hit the nigger!

400

[thudding]

401

[thudding]
[grunting]

405
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:48,928
- [Grace] You passed out.

406
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,190
What's wrong?

407
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,321
I mean, I've known you forever

408
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:54,063
and I've never seen
you pass out.

409
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:56,326
- [Seth] God, I must
have ate something bad.

410
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,371
- I'm gonna take you to
the hospital.

411
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,982
- [Seth] No, no, no hospitals.

412
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:01,505
I'm gonna be fine.

413
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:07,120
- I don't deserve to
be here behind

414
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,730
these kind of bars.

415
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:13,822
I deserve to be in a better
bar where I can have a drink.

416
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:19,872
But they uh, all I did was
write a couple of bad checks.

417
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:23,963
My wife comes home one day with
two sealpoint Siamese cats.

418
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:25,442
They were twins.

419
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:29,185
And she wanted me to go out
and get this special diet.

420
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:31,579
And all I had was rent money,

421
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,494
but she said she was
gonna leave me

422
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:36,932
if I didn't feed these cats.

423
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,586
- [Cash] Pablo, what
are you doing?

424
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,809
- [Pablo] I don't know
what I'm doing.

425
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:48,727
- [Cash] I guess
everybody's a little nuts.

426
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:53,166
- Or they're nuts.

427
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:57,431
[chuckling]

428
00:28:57,474 --> 00:29:00,564
- Yeah, that'd be great.

429
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:02,001
That sounds like a lot of fun,
too.

430
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:06,788
Maybe, maybe all three
of us could go, huh?

431
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:09,051
Little walk down the beach.

432
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:12,185
Maybe a glass of wine
or two after.

433
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,362
Who knows what'll happen, right?

434
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:17,233
[chuckling]

435
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:19,322
Oh really, Renee?

436
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:20,193
What now, huh?

437
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,239
What now, Renee?

438
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:27,635
Well, of course you're jealous.

439
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:30,246
Now you know how I felt when
you were lookin' at him.

440
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:34,033
You watch your goddamn mouth.

441
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:35,774
Watch your goddamn mouth.

442
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:39,212
Can I help you?

443
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:43,042

447
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:32,918
Son of a bitch.

00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:33,919
Get off her.

[grunting]

459
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:01,120
- [Donnie] Why don't we all
just get a piece of that?

460
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:02,425
- [Stark] Sick fuck.

461
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:04,297

Just make sure that fuckin'

- How long could it be?

515
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:12,137

00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:49,783
- [Seth] I'm sorry.

536
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,611
These inmates got me runnin'
ragged.

537
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:53,613
I don't even know
which way's up.

538
00:34:53,656 --> 00:34:56,094
Shoulda just woke me up earlier.

539
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,139
- [Grace] I tried and
you didn't move.

540
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,750
What's this?

541
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:03,797
[clanking]

542
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,624
- [Donnie] This ain't right.

543
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,278
I ain't no animal.

544
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,106
- [Clayton] I guess
you are for now.

545
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:13,198
- [Maddy] Get him
away from there!

546
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,069
- [Clayton] So sorry this
happened, but just hang tight

547
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,549
and I'm gonna take care
of this, all right?

548
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:17,463
I promise.

549
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:23,643
- [Stark] Deputy.

550
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:26,472
I thought I made bail.

551
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:27,908
- [Clayton] Well, you're
still in here, ain't ya?

552
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:29,605
- [Stark] I guess I gotta
call my lawyer, right?

553
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:31,085
- [Clayton] I guess you do.

554
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,869
- [Stark] Can you make
that happen for me?

555
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:34,697
- [Clayton] Yeah, I'll
get right on that.

556
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,483
- Thanks Deputy.

[groaning]

558
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:44,446
- [Cash] No, Pablo, come on man.

559
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,100
- [Pablo] You gotta go,
you gotta go.

560

[grunting]

561
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:49,669
- [Cash] You couldn't
wait five minutes?

562
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,149
- [Pable] Five minutes?

563
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,019
Take a dump like this?

564
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:53,542
That's like, five years, dude.

565
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:54,717
What are you talking about?

566
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:55,892
[stammering]

567
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:57,111
- [Cash] Why do you
smell like that?

568
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,809
We're all eating the same food.

569
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:01,376
Smell like Dr. Frankenstein.

570
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,377
- [Pablo] What do you
want me to smell like?

571
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:03,726
- Shouldn't exercise as much.

572
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,685
You're waking up with a
monster in your belly's

573
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:06,773
what you're doing.

574
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,340
[clunking]

575
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:09,167

[grunting]

577
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:15,347
- [Seth] Something I
found upstairs.

578
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,435
Been looking for that.

579
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:20,743

[faint mellow music]

581
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,008
What's wrong with you?

582
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,713
- No, Sheriff, I don't
know what happened.

583
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:37,717
Yeah, Donnie and Maddy's
cells were left open.

584
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,938
Well no, but he tried
to rape her.

585
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:45,725
She's okay, but they
don't want me

586
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:47,205
to let Donnie out of his cell.

587
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,297
Yeah, I'll say something
to Seth about it.

588
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:54,647
Will do.

589
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,170

bein' in here one day, huh?

I don't wanna bore you
with the details.

608
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:04,978

but time.

And I'm all ears.

610
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:15,336

young and my mom

basically drank herself to death

612
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:19,949

my sister, car accident.

[Donnie chuckling]

614
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:22,343
She picked her up from school

615
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:25,477
after having her
afternoon cocktails.

616
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,610
They drove off and
she lost control

617
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:30,046
of the wheel and hit a car.

618
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:32,222
My sister died instantly.

619
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:34,964
My mom died a year after.

What about you?

621
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,014
I mean, where's your family?

622
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:46,411

00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:49,022
- [Stark] Why is that?

624
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:49,849
- I don't know.

625
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:50,719
I just don't.

626
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:54,984
We had a falling out, I guess.

627
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:59,554
My boyfriend, who was
the one growing the drugs

628

in the first place doesn't

629
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:05,038
seem to be making it a big
priority to come bail me out.

630
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:07,345
- [Stark] Wait, he didn't
get locked up?

631
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:10,130
- No, should of, but he didn't.

632
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:14,177
- Wow, your luck is as
good as mine.

633
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:15,570
We should get Deputy
Clayton down there

your girlfriend?

638

no one lets me use the phone.

00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:35,024
It's kinda weird.

640
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:38,071
They leave us up here all alone.

641
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:40,726
Don't even check up on us.

642
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:42,554
I mean, one of us could be dead,

643
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,469
they wouldn't even know it.

Seth, isn't that great?

- [Jake] Dad, are you okay?

650
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,301
I helped Mom cook that chicken

651
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:35,607
and it's just sittin'
on your plate.

a lot on his mind right now.

May I be excused?

do you think you're going?

project to do.

He has a school

[footsteps clacking]

716
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:56,623
- [Sheriff] Hey, long night?

717
00:45:58,712 --> 00:45:59,800
- [Seth] Hey, Sheriff.

718
00:46:02,368 --> 00:46:04,500
- [Sheriff] Long night
undercover, Deputy?

719
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:06,502
- [Seth] Why you say that?

720
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:08,678
- Well, it's a little
past six in the morning

721
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:11,594
and you're asleep on
your back porch.

722
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:13,771
Why don't you get back in
there with your wife, kids?

723
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:15,511
I'm gonna go check on
the inmates.

724
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:29,395
Nice and quiet.

725
00:46:35,183 --> 00:46:38,273
[footsteps clacking]

726
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:07,999
- [Grace] We need to talk.

727
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,784
- [Seth] What about?

728
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:16,268
- Last night.

729
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,448
We're gonna leave.

730
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:26,408
It's just temporary until
you figure things out

731
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:27,670
here with yourself.

732
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:33,198
- [Seth] But I ain't
gonna be that much longer.

733
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:35,635
- Yeah, you don't know that.

734
00:47:38,464 --> 00:47:40,335
- Where you goin'?

735
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:41,380
- To my mom's.

736
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:47,734
- [Seth] Well, it's
probably for the best.

737
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,432
- [Grace] Come on, kids.

738
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:54,828
[melancholy music]

739
00:47:58,527 --> 00:47:59,354
- [Seth] Jake.

740
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:13,151
- [Daphne] Love you, Daddy.

741
00:48:16,284 --> 00:48:18,765
- [Seth] I love you, too,
sweetheart.

742
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:20,506
You be a good girl, okay?

743
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:22,116
- [Daphne] Okay.

744
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,857
- [Seth] Come on, I'll
walk you out.

745
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:40,047
- [Sheriff] Not pleasure,
not glory, not power.

746
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:40,874
Freedom.

747
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:42,963
Only freedom.

748
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:46,358
- [Stark] Book of Disquiet.

749
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:46,880
Familiar with it.

750
00:48:48,229 --> 00:48:49,970
- [Sheriff] They say he
was ahead of its time.

751
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:52,842
- [Stark] Yeah, he was.

752
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:55,715
- [Sheriff] How you
holding up in here?

753
00:48:57,325 --> 00:49:00,372
- Well, the food is terrible
and the room service sucks,

754
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,504
but other than that, it's great.

755
00:49:02,548 --> 00:49:03,375
- Really?

756
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:05,464
- No, it's not great.

757
00:49:05,507 --> 00:49:06,944
Nothing great about this place.

758
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:09,468
- [Sheriff] We'll get you
outta here soon.

759
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:12,471
Hang in there.

760
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:15,256
- Thanks, Sheriff.

761
00:49:17,563 --> 00:49:20,522

[dog barking]

763
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:56,602
- [Grace] I put some food
in the fridge for you.

764
00:49:57,951 --> 00:49:58,734
Seth.

765
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,867
Seth?

766
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:05,002
- [Seth] What?

767
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:09,876
- [Grace] Never mind.

768
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:16,535
[tense music]

769
00:50:37,686 --> 00:50:39,340

770
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:40,472
Hey, git!

[dog whimpering]

772
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:42,430
Go on, git, git!

773
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:44,954
[tense music]

774
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,419
- [Sheriff] You doin'
any better?

775
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,989
I guess not if we're
drinkin' at 10 a.m., Seth.

776
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:21,295
- You know,

777
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,819
I gotta be honest with ya,
Sheriff.

778
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:25,647
I'm not so sure this
was a good idea.

779
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:28,781
My wife and kids just left me.

780
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:30,043
This isn't workin' out.

781
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,871
- [Sheriff] I'm sorry to
hear about that.

782
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:33,960
- [Seth] I didn't sign up
for any of this.

783
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:37,529
- I wouldn't have hired
you as my deputy

784
00:51:37,572 --> 00:51:41,010
if I didn't think you could
handle this pressure, Seth.

785
00:51:41,054 --> 00:51:43,709
Now, I'm gonna have these
guys outta here soon enough.

786
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:47,582
All right?

787
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:49,802
Lay off that stuff.

788
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:00,378
- [Seth] Dammit.

789
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:03,685
Wish I never said I'd
stay in this place.

790
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,389
- [Pablo] Got any sevens?

791

795
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:31,060
- [Pablo] I don't have a three.

796
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:32,671
You must go fish.

797
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:33,541
Fish.

798
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:42,985
- [Maddy] Stark.

799
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:43,899
Stark.

800
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:45,901
Come here.

- [Stark] Lemme go make
you some bacon and eggs.

804
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:02,962

have any crackers

805
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:04,703
or anything to snack on?

806
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:06,095
- [Stark] I don't have anything.

807
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:08,141
- [Maddy] Guess they
want us to eat

808
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,447
our roommates then, huh?

809
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,231
- [Stark] Our roommates?

810
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:13,799
- Our roommates, the roaches.

811
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:15,192
- [Stark] Oh, I wouldn't--

812
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:17,455

813
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:22,199

You like paintin', shitbag?

You wanna clean some fuckin'

It's gonna be good times.

820
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:54,970
Get your ass up, we're
going on a field trip.

821
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:57,321
- [Cash] Field trip?

822
00:53:57,364 --> 00:53:59,497
- Did I stutter, mother fucker?

823
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,889
Get your black ass up.

824
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:08,288
Don't eyeball me, mother fucker.

825
00:54:13,206 --> 00:54:16,644
You just keep your fuckin'

Let's go, now!

827

Oh,

You better think fuckin' twice,

831
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:40,233
or I'll cut your grass.

832
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,125
- [Maddy] You are not serious.

833
00:55:03,169 --> 00:55:04,910
- [Seth] It's pretty
self-explanatory.

834
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,826
Gonna do ourselves a

00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:13,310
- You're full of all kinds
of questions, ain't ya?

837
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:16,008
You keep that up, and I got
some answers for your ass.

838
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:20,708
Get to work.

- [Cash] This is unbelievable.

841
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:29,500
- [Stark] Could be worse.

842
00:55:30,718 --> 00:55:31,719
- [Maddy] All right, Picasso.

843
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:32,503

- [Seth] Surprise, surprise.

848

- [Pablo] What do you
want from me?

849
00:55:54,307 --> 00:55:56,135
- [Seth] I want you on
your hands and knees,

850
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:57,354
barkin' like a dog.

851
00:55:58,442 --> 00:55:59,660

know how to bark.

852
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:00,835
I don't know how to bark.

- You don't say a goddamn word.

861
00:56:13,848 --> 00:56:15,981
- [Clayton] Everybody
back away from the door.

862
00:56:19,941 --> 00:56:21,421
Pablo, what's goin' on, man?

863
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:22,901
- [Pablo] I don't know
what's goin' on?

864
00:56:22,944 --> 00:56:24,424
- [Clayton] Pablo, I
asked you a damn question.

865
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:25,556
What the hell's going
on around here?

866
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,122

00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,602
I know where everybody is.

868

man?

00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:33,694
Pablo.

872
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:39,657
Don't do it man.

I got a wife and kids!

874
00:56:40,527 --> 00:56:42,007
Please, Pablo, please.

Bunch of goddamn Jerry's Kids.

893
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,421
Let's go!

894
00:58:47,262 --> 00:58:48,437
Come on, princess.

895
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:51,658
Get in your cell.

896
00:58:51,702 --> 00:58:52,529
Let's go.

897
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,405
You mind your own
goddamn business.

898
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:07,152
Your food's on the cot.

899
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:11,330
You clean your plate.

900
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:14,899
- [Cash] Where's Pablo?

901
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:16,770
Where's Pablo?

902
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:24,082
- [Seth] I don't know.

903
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:26,998
He must have made bail.

904
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:34,005
[laughing]

905
00:59:40,185 --> 00:59:41,752

906
00:59:41,795 --> 00:59:45,712
♪ Makes the medicine go down ♪

907
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:46,844
Really fuckin' stupid.

908
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:50,021
Yeah.

909
00:59:57,942 --> 00:59:58,986
Mmm hmm.

910
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,293
[knocking]

911
01:00:02,163 --> 01:00:02,990
Who is it?

912
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:06,690
Goddammit.

913
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:13,914
Oh, Sheriff, hey.

914
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:17,222
- [Sheriff] You okay?

915
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:18,397
- [Seth] I'm fine, you?

916
01:00:19,746 --> 01:00:21,356
- [Sheriff] I'm fine.

917
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,836
Have you seen Deputy Clayton?

918
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,316
- Not since earlier.

919
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:26,361
Came by and mention something
about his wife and kids

920
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:28,581
and I don't know, took off, why?

921
01:00:30,017 --> 01:00:30,801
- May I come in?

922
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:33,760
- Now's not a good time, no.

923
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:36,067
Place is a mess.

924
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:39,374
- [Sheriff] You're actin' odd,
Seth.

925
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:41,899
- I am?

926
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:44,510
I'm sorry, Sheriff, you know,

927
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:48,209
I'm just not myself with
my wife gone, you know.

928
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:53,127
- [Sheriff] Well if
you see Deputy Clayton,

929
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:54,781
you have him call me.

930
01:00:54,825 --> 01:00:55,608
- You got it.

931
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,479
- [Sheriff] All right?

932
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,662
[knocking]

933
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,272
- [Seth] Goddammit.

934
01:01:10,231 --> 01:01:11,015
What?

935
01:01:11,058 --> 01:01:11,929
Hey.

936
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:12,451
- [Calvin] Good evening, Seth.

937
01:01:12,494 --> 01:01:13,670
- [Seth] Calvin.

938
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:14,845
- [Calvin] Thought I'd
stop by and give you

939
01:01:14,888 --> 01:01:17,804
an update on the progress
of your new home.

940
01:01:17,848 --> 01:01:19,284
- [Seth] Last time we
spoke Calvin,

941
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:21,373
you said you were workin'
at breakneck speed

942
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:22,591
on that son of a bitch.

943
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:25,464
- [Calvin] We are.

944
01:01:25,507 --> 01:01:26,987
- Well, you just keep that up.

945
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:29,207
- [Calvin] Well, Seth, Seth.

946
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,861
I mean, it's only been a
couple of days.

947
01:01:30,904 --> 01:01:34,386
- Yeah, if I was you,
I'd get your little ass

948
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:35,953
in that fancy little
car of yours

949
01:01:35,996 --> 01:01:37,345
and get off my property,

950
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:39,347
pronto.

951
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,395
- [Calvin] You know, it's only
been a couple of days, and--

952
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:45,745
it's not your property.

953
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:48,313
- All right boys, here you go.

954
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:06,418
- [Stark] Something's not right.

955
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:08,028
- [Maddy] You think?

956
01:02:08,072 --> 01:02:10,117
- [Stark] Where's
that guy Donnie?

957
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:11,553
- I don't know, I don't care.

958
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:13,468
- [Stark] That's understandable.

959
01:02:13,512 --> 01:02:15,819
But he hasn't been around
in the last couple of days.

960
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:17,255
Then old man Pablo, him makin'
bail?

961
01:02:17,298 --> 01:02:18,125
I mean, come on.

962
01:02:18,169 --> 01:02:19,779
That doesn't make sense.

963
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:21,650
- [Maddy] He does
nothing but work out.

964
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:24,871
- [Stark] I know.

965
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,397
- [Maddy] [mumbling]
fight with Donnie.

966
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:31,660
[clanking]

967
01:02:43,585 --> 01:02:44,717
- [Seth] Who's thirsty?

968
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:49,461
Brought y'all some refreshments.

969
01:02:49,504 --> 01:02:50,810
- [Cash] What is this?

970
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:51,898
Red punch?

971
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:54,031
I don't drink this stuff.

972
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:55,249
- Oh, I'm sorry.

973
01:02:55,293 --> 01:02:56,163
That's my bad.

974
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:01,386
You got a problem
with your drink?

975
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,042
- [Stark] Ah.

976
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:07,131
- [Seth] You see, that
wasn't so tough was it?

977
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,612
Dumbass.

978
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:18,490
[clanking]

979
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:20,579
Y'all need anything else,
you just holler.

980
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:24,801
[laughing]

981
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:45,647
[tense eerie music]

982
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:50,870
- [Stark] So, you're
an accountant?

983
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:51,740
Wow.

984
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:58,878
- Numbers, you know,
they're like people.

985
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:03,535
They all have their own
little world,

986
01:04:03,578 --> 01:04:07,147
Their positive and
negative sides.

987
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:10,411
Full of possibility.

988
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:16,200
Indivisibles, their variables,
squares.

989
01:04:17,505 --> 01:04:18,332
Roots.

990
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,644
Freedom isn't where you live.

991
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:26,558
It's not your job.

992
01:04:28,473 --> 01:04:31,302
Hey, hey, hey, you all right?

993
01:04:31,345 --> 01:04:33,652
Woo, woo, not lookin' too good,
buddy.

994
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:36,002
- [Stark] Hell if I--

995
01:04:36,046 --> 01:04:37,003
- Are you sure?

996
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:38,178
Woo, woo, woo.

997
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:00,461

998
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:05,902

[groaning]

1005
01:07:30,307 --> 01:07:31,090
- Maddy.

1006
01:07:33,832 --> 01:07:34,659
Maddy.

1007
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:39,055
Maddy, wake up.

1008
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:50,153
- [Seth] Breakfast of champions.

1009
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,213
- [Maddy] Stark.

1010
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:10,086
Stark, is that you?

1011
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:15,091
- [Stark] Yeah.

1012
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:16,918
Why are you whispering?

1013
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:17,876
- [Maddy] I don't know.

1014
01:08:17,919 --> 01:08:19,312
Trying not to wake anyone up.

1015
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,837
- I don't think no one
else is here.

1016
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:25,449
Hey, is your head hurting?

1017
01:08:25,492 --> 01:08:27,712
- Yeah, I feel like I
got hammered last night.

1018
01:08:27,755 --> 01:08:28,713
What do you mean nobody
else is here?

1019
01:08:28,756 --> 01:08:29,583
Where's Cash?

1020
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:31,063
- I don't know.

1021
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,369
I guess he made bail, too.

1022
01:08:34,327 --> 01:08:35,633
Hey, do you smell that?

1023
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:37,765
[screeching]

1024
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:39,376
- [Maddy] Yeah, I smell it.

1025
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:41,552
- Because the deputy downstairs,

1026
01:08:41,595 --> 01:08:44,511
I think he put something
in our drinks last night.

1027
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:46,252
- [Maddy] I think so, too.

1028
01:08:46,296 --> 01:08:48,472
- Yeah, I mean come
on, red punch for Cash?

1029
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,955
- You're so smart, you
should be a detective.

1030
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:54,826
- Funny.

1031
01:08:56,436 --> 01:08:57,307
How's your cage?

1032
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:01,485
- It's fantastic.

1033
01:09:01,528 --> 01:09:03,574
- [Stark] I like what
you've done with the place.

1034
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:05,793
- [Maddy] Yeah, just
call me Martha Stewart.

1035
01:09:09,101 --> 01:09:10,494
- [Stark] It's gonna
be all right.

1036
01:09:11,886 --> 01:09:14,150
[clanking]

1037
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:25,552
- [Seth] Sorry to break up
this little jailhouse romance,

1038
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:27,598
but I got plans for your ass.

1039
01:09:30,122 --> 01:09:31,950
- [Maddy] More painting?

1040
01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:35,562
- Not quite, but just
as exciting.

1041
01:09:35,606 --> 01:09:36,433
Let's go.

1042
01:09:40,132 --> 01:09:41,351
Not so fast, turbo.

1043
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:42,178
- [Stark] You said let's go.

1044
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:43,744
- I was talking to the lady.

1045
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:47,966
- [Stark] What's that?

1046
01:09:48,009 --> 01:09:49,489
- That's your new best friend.

1047
01:09:52,536 --> 01:09:54,668
The two of you gonna
shine up them toilets.

1048
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:57,454
And I do mean shine.

1049
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,467
[clanking]

1050
01:10:27,353 --> 01:10:28,485
Right in here.

1051
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,140
- [Maddy] What's the new plan?

1052
01:10:32,184 --> 01:10:33,794
You gonna have your way with me?

1053
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:41,411
- [Seth] Let's start
with a little breakfast.

1054
01:10:44,152 --> 01:10:46,198
- [Maddy] You want me to cook?

1055
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,460
- [Seth] That's the plan.

1056
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,463
- [Maddy] Bacon and eggs?

1057
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,903
- [Seth] Or whatever your
little heart desires.

1058
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:01,953
- [Maddy] Is this a joke?

1059
01:11:01,996 --> 01:11:03,041
- Joke?

1060
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:04,912
[tense music]

1061
01:11:04,956 --> 01:11:06,523
You see anybody fuckin'
laughing, huh?

1062
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:07,698
- No.

1063
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:09,177
- Now, you make me some
bacon or I'll fry

1064
01:11:09,221 --> 01:11:10,048
your goddamn face.

1065
01:11:10,091 --> 01:11:12,268
- [Maddy] Okay, sorry.

1066
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:13,399
Sorry.

1067
01:11:13,443 --> 01:11:15,967
I was just asking a question.

1068
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:17,403
- Bacon and eggs.

1069
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:29,894
- [Maddy] Oh, shit.

1070
01:11:45,213 --> 01:11:47,433
[scraping]

1071
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:06,931
