Are you proud of yourself for saving him?

11
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,750
You’d better mind your own business.

12
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,417
You thought you could get this note out?

13

Kiyoshi says we should offer you a job.

We have a problem
with one of your fellow Americans.

85

We have tried to reason with him
for a while now.

you could help us with that.

Can’t believe you punched that guy.

-[in English] See the way he looked at me?
-He was a little out of line.

112

-Right.
-[man] Let’s make some money.

113
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,208
All right.

Mr. Panetti?

123
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,917
I got a guy out here,
says he’s here about a contract.

124
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:21,000
Just give him a minute.

125
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,583
Look,
I’m sure you got respect for these people

126
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,042
because they wear silk pajamas

127
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:44,000
and they bow like you’re the fuckin’
sun god when they pour the coffee.

128
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,792
Frankly, I don’t give a shit
about their rules or their traditions

129
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,958
or whatever the fuck it is
that you’re here to try to explain to me.

130
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,458
We won!

131
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:55,792
What’s the point in winning a war

132
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,375
if now you gotta worry
about steppin’ on Japs’ toes?

133
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,125
-I wouldn’t call ’em Japs.
-Okay.

134
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,917
-So you’re one of those.
-One of what?

135
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,875
I got a deal with the United States Army.

136
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,667
Your fuckin’ country gives me metal
at two cents a cubic yard.

137
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,583
Do you know
where they get this metal from?

138
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,750
Any idea?

139
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:20,667
They get it
from breaking down war machines

140
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,167
that these fucking Nips built
to sneak attack us.

141
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:29,583
So excuse me
if they gotta buy it back from me cheap.

142
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:34,250
Now, I don’t know
if you’re bangin’ some slanty-eyed broad

143
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,958
and you’re gettin’ all gooked-out
and sympathetic,

144
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,375
but that’s the way it is.

145
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,583
-That’s the way it is?
-That’s the way it is.

146
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,458
And now,
you can get the fuck outta my office.

[sighs]

151
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,333
[in English] Did you kill him?

152
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:24,917
He’ll live.

153
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:27,708
[in Japanese] Let’s go.

[up-tempo jazz playing]

155
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,667
Brother,
recently I’ve been doing some impressions.

156
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,333
-Let me see.
-May I?

157
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,750
It’s a worm.

158
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,500
And now… two worms.

159
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:26,375
-[laughing]
-[Kiyoshi] That’s not funny.

160
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,583
[big man] You can’t say it’s not funny.

161
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,875
[in English] Nick. Your turn.

162
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,750
A penguin walks into a bar.

163
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,583
Says to the bartender…

164
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,375
“Hey, have you seen my brother?”

165
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:53,125
Bartender looks at the penguin and says…

166
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:57,875
“What’s he look like?”

167
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,333
[laughing]

168
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:09,000
[in Japanese] A penguin walks into a bar
and asks the bartender,

169
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,208
“Have you seen my brother?”

170
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:14,125
“What’s he look like?”
“A penguin, of course.”

171
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,375
Everyone, laugh.

172
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,000
Laugh. Whatever it means, laugh.

173
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,250
[man] Laugh, laugh.

174
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,750
Shit, it’s them.

175
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,208
It’s the Seizu family.

176
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,792
[man] They’d better go back to Kobe.
This is our city.

177
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,417
Hey, you, calm down. Sit down.

178
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,625
[Kiyoshi] What do you want?

179
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,792
Smart move.

180
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,958
This is our territory. Go home.

181
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,542
The Yankee warehouse,
think you can get away with it?

182
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:50,208
We made a deal with the GIs, not you.

183
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:51,750
The warehouses are ours now.

184
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,083
Hey, handsome, listen up.

185
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:57,750
You came in here and talked to us,
like your boss told you to.

186
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,375
That’s impressive.

187
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:03,292
We’ll pass it on, if we don’t forget.

188
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:08,458
[Kiyoshi] I hear your family made a deal
with the Americans,

189
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:11,708
but that won’t make this port yours.

190
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:12,833
Get it?

191
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,958
You expect me to take you seriously

192
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:18,292
with this little white kitten
at your table?

193
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:24,208
Oh, ho! You have a cute face.

194
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,333
Then why don’t you take him home
and pet him?

195
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,083
No, you keep her.

196
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,375
You haven’t heard the news in town?

197
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:35,708
The name Shiromatsu means nothing anymore.

198
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,458
Your boss is half-retired.

199
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,833
He’s blind to what’s coming.

200
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:42,958
Shut up.

201
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,250
[Kentaro chuckles] It’s true.

202
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,958
If your boss and our previous boss weren’t
on good terms,

203
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,292
I would destroy your family.

204
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It’s the other way around, idiot.

205
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:54,917
Next, we will take your women.

206
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:56,375
[Kiyoshi] Go home.

207
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:00,333
[Kentaro] We’ll take your dirty balls
while we’re at it.

208
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:03,833
Just like we took your port
before you knew it.

209
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Go home.

210
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,750
-[woman screams]
-[Nick grunts]

211
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,458
[Orochi] Go back to Kobe.

212
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:22,542
Let them go.

213
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,875
[Orochi] Get lost!

214
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,042
Don’t come back, fool.

215
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,125
I’m going.

216
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,292
Where are the dancers?

217
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,375
Dance!

218
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:54,458
[man] Dance! Let’s start drinking again.

219
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,625
Cheers.

220
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Cheers.

[women chattering]

228
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,417
Whose place is this?

229
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,750
Yours, if you want it.

230
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,625
It’s nice.

231
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:20,500
[key clatters]

232
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,250
Think about it.

233
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,833
There’s a suit in the closet.
Should fit you.

234
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,542
[men laughing and chattering]

235

[shouting continues]

237
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,667
Let me join you.

238
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,958
[shouting stops]

239
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,042
How much?

240
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,542
Why isn’t anyone saying anything?

241
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,833
-Who is in charge? You?
-[man] No.

242
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,083
I’m asking who’s in charge.

243
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:35,833
You?

244
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:38,417
Is it him?

245
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,500
What’s your name?

246
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,167
Kimura.

247
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,958
So you’re Kimura.

248
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,042
Nick. Kimura.

249
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,083
I want to ask you.

250
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:00,917
If my friend Nick was looking
to play cards in Osaka,

251
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,542
should he ask you?

252
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:06,208
I don’t work with Americans.

253
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,458
[Kiyoshi] Don’t be bossy.

254
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:10,417
Who are you?

255
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,042
You have a family in the Osaka docks?
Are you the boss?

256
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,375
I don’t know.

257
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,792
Who owns Osaka?

258
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,375
I’m asking you. Who owns Osaka?

259
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,167
I wanna hear it.

260
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,375
Who is it?

261
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,958
Who owns Osaka?

262
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,792
The Shiromatsu.

263
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:41,542
Say it again.

264
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:44,375
-Shiromatsu.
-Wrong. Say it once more.

265
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:45,500
Shiromatsu.

266
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,042
It’s “Mr. Shiromatsu.”

267
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,333
Stand up.

268
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,583
Sato let me use this place.

269
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,667
We’ve been friends with Sato
since the old days.

270
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,875
I hear you threatened to tell his wife
that he’d slept with one of his actresses.

271
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:07,125
He got her pregnant.

272
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,917
It’s your child.

273
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,042
She says you raped her.

274
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,625
Hey. It’s over for today. Off you go.

275
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:20,042
If you have any debts,
pay them to Akihiro Shiromatsu.

276
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:22,667
Never play in Osaka without paying.

277
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,000
Hurry up and get out.

278
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,083
[gamblers murmuring]

279
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,583
Now.

280
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,792
-I’ll pay if you want money.
-Pay.

281
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:37,792
How much is the Shiromatsu’s usual cut?
I’ll pay double.

282
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,875
Okay, pay.

283
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,750
[in English]
He wants to know what Shiromatsu’s cut is.

284
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:47,042
Can’t you even negotiate
without permission from your white dog?

[gagging]

286
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:55,625
[Kiyoshi] Are you okay?

287
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,333
Don’t make such a fuss.

288
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,542
Aren’t you being dramatic?

289
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:06,792
Don’t weep.

290
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:10,083
This is what happens
when you resist the Shiromatsu.

[people laughing]

295
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:00,083
Why is he still hanging around here?

296
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,167
What do you mean?

297
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,917
That <i>gaijin</i> has already served
his purpose, hasn’t he?

298
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:09,333
Why? He doesn’t mean shit to me.

299
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,417
You sure?

300
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,458
Don’t worry. It’s fine.

301
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:17,250
What’s fine?
I’m asking you if you owe him a debt.

302
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,917
And I said no.

303
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,625
Listen, Kiyoshi.

304
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:24,333
He doesn’t care about you or this family.

305
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,833
Send him away.

306
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:30,125
Okay?

307
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:38,583
He doesn’t like me very much, does he?

308
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:42,917
What’s the story with his fingers?

309
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:48,917
[in English] When you dishonor your boss
and you want to show remorse,

310
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,250
you give your finger.

311
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,667
It’s called <i>otoshimae</i>.

312
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,833
I see you’ve got all your fingers.

313
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,000

[woman] What?

320
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:51,708
[Kiyoshi] That’s enough.

What does it look like? I’m dancing.

325
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,458
-I told you not to come here.
-Why? What’s wrong?

326
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,792
-No reason. Just go home.
-No.

327
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,708
Don’t test me.

328
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:20,250
What would you do if the Seizu men
walked in with guns in their hands?

329
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,000
Why would they come? Where are they?

330
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,833
I’m saying what if they came?

332
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:30,125
[in English]
Take my sister home. She’s drunk.

333
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,333
[in Japanese]
That’s enough. He’s taking you home.

334
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,750
Go home.

335
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:50,917
[in English] Thank you for taking me home.

336
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:52,833
Yeah.

[chuckles] Um…

338
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:00,333
I’m gonna close the door now.

339
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,125
You’re very beautiful.

340
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,208
Thank you.

341
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,833
You’re welcome.

00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,792
-You want to come inside?
-Yes.

00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,458
Morning.

[thunder rumbling]

348
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:08,708
I should go.

349
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:12,292
You should.

[clears throat]

352
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:07,625
Orochi says the US Army is shipping guns
back to the States.

353
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:10,792
Their plan is to sell some of it
before it leaves the port.

354
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:16,125
The US Army cannot know
that the Shiromatsu is involved.

355
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,417
Makes sense.

356
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:21,042
You will have to do this on your own.

357
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:24,333
I understand if you won’t do this,

358
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,417
but if it goes right,
everything will change.

359
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,458
And if it goes wrong?

360
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:35,125
It will come down on you and no one else.

361
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:37,792
Sounds like fun.

362
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:09,917

He is no different from the Seizu.

in this investment.

543
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
Are we in Kobe?

544
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:39,125
I will not come under the command
of Hiromitsu Seizu.

545
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:41,500
He doesn’t have the guts to pay me…

546
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:45,625
but he sends me this college grad boy…

547
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:51,083
to beg for my money.
Not to a man like that.

548
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:55,792
I’m just saying
this sounds like a smart investment.

549
01:06:56,375 --> 01:07:00,167
Let’s have the non-Japanese
leave the room. You, leave.

550
01:07:01,792 --> 01:07:03,375
[in English] Nick, get out.

551
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,958
[Kiyoshi] You should go home, brother.

552
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:15,292
Why? You know I’m right.

553
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:17,250
It’s not for us to decide.

554
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:20,458
[Orochi]
Father doesn’t want a war against Seizu.

555
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,250
He’ll bow to him all day long.

556
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,958
He’ll offer our fingers,

557
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:30,000
but then he spits at Seizu’s money
for his honor.

558
01:07:30,792 --> 01:07:34,083
He’s stuck in the old ways.

559
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:38,292
You really think
he should share investments with Seizu?

560
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,833
He would rather die.

561
01:07:40,917 --> 01:07:43,333
If you don’t take it, someone else does.

562
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:45,208
You’re too drunk.

563
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:48,000
Yeah, I’m drunk. So what?

564
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:51,375
My head still works fine.

565
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:54,167
[in English] Stay, brother.

566
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:57,375
You and I never really talked.

567
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:00,125
You see that guy?

568
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:05,250
When I was little, I didn’t go to school.

569
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:07,583
I worked.

570
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:11,708
One day, I walk home…

571
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:17,458
and a <i>chinpira</i>, a wannabe gangster,
puts a knife at my throat.

572
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:20,958
He takes my money, 200 yen.

573
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:23,875
I go home to my father.

574
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:27,167
He’s drunk. Angry.

575
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:29,667
He takes his glass.

576
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:35,333
I bleed every fucking place.

577
01:08:35,917 --> 01:08:36,958
I run.

578
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:40,667
I run all the way to the river, crying.

579
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:43,792
A boy comes to me.

580
01:08:44,292 --> 01:08:47,500
He says his name is Kiyoshi.

581
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,833
He walks with me
back to my father’s house.

582
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:54,333
He takes a metal pipe.

583
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:57,417
He breaks my father’s head.

584
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:01,292
From that day, I am <i>yakuza</i>.

585
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,042
And Kiyoshi,

586
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:05,167
he is my brother.

587
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,250
And now…

588
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,667
You understand?

589
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:17,083
<i>Gaijin</i>.

590
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:21,625
You understand my English?

591
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:24,292
Huh?

592
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,083
[Kiyoshi clears throat]

593
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:30,250
That’s enough. Go home.

594
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:36,708
Whatever you say, brother.

595
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:42,958
[clears throat]

596
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:53,750
Sorry, he’s busy.

597
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:55,667
-[Orochi in Japanese] Move aside.
-He’s busy.

598
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:22,833
[Orochi]
You’ve turned into a beautiful woman.

599
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:30,375
To whom do you owe becoming such a beauty?

600
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:35,667
Hmm?

601
01:10:42,042 --> 01:10:43,875
-What’s this?
-Don’t touch me.

602
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,792
-Try and stop me.
-Stop it.

603
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,875
I’m not the same person I used to be.

604
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:52,833
Me neither.

605
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:58,208
What are you doing here?

606
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:04,375
I missed our times together.

607
01:11:04,917 --> 01:11:06,292
[laughs]

608
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:09,833
We were over a long time ago.

609
01:11:13,042 --> 01:11:14,083
I know.

610
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,208
Lonely, aren’t you?

611
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:28,542
You can’t hide what’s inside your heart.

612
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:32,500
You…

613
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:36,125
-You still care about me.
-Stop it.

614
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,667
Why do you tell me to stop? You like this…

615
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:40,833
No.

616
01:11:41,792 --> 01:11:42,625
Stop.

617
01:11:46,417 --> 01:11:48,250
You wanna be a whore?

618
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,583
That white bastard’s whore?

619
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:56,542
Why do you like him? Tell me.

620
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,667
Huh?

621
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,250
What does he have that I don’t?

622
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,125
Tell me!

623
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:02,042
[Miyu gasps]

624
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:07,042
You think he’s going to protect you?

625
01:12:08,417 --> 01:12:10,125
Is that what you really think?

626
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:15,292
If that’s the case,
I will make you a whore.

627
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:18,542
Like every bitch around here.

628
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:24,167
No, no, stop it! Let me go!

629
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,000
[screaming]

630
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:31,083
[sobbing]

631
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:40,542
[Orochi] Sorry.

632
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:44,458
Sorry.

633
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,208
[muffled introduction]

634
01:13:06,292 --> 01:13:08,750
[muffled cheering]

635
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:42,750
[muffled cheering]

636
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:56,250
[crowd cheering]

637
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:16,958
[drumbeats]

638
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:18,708
[referee shouts]

639
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:43,667
[cheering]

640
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,500
[speaking Japanese]

641
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:55,375
[crowd cheering]

642
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:58,125
It’s the Shiromatsu.

643
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:39,208
I heard you were insulted
by my representative’s offer.

644
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:43,833
I was insulted by you.

645
01:15:44,917 --> 01:15:46,792
You think I have no respect.

646
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:50,708
I respect you more than you think.

647
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:53,417
Let me speak with respect.

648
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:59,333
I’m offering to build a fence around you…

649
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:04,500
to invite you into my garden.

650
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,875
There, you can retire…

651
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:09,167
and live for years.

652
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:12,625
What about my family members?

653
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:15,917
They can join my family.

654
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,583
They can do as they please.

655
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:24,167
As long as they do not form
any new family in Osaka.

656
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:31,208
You call this…

657
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,833
an offer of respect?

658
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:41,167
You understand nothing
about your father’s generation.

659
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:46,000
We are wolves.

660
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:48,375
We’re not dogs.

661
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:52,958
Can you keep wolves inside a fence?

662
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:56,000
[cheering]

663
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:08,667
Careful on your way back to Kobe.

664
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:50,750
[man] Nick?

665
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,792
Nick fuckin’ Lowell?

666
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,292
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

667
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:03,375
-Wow.
-You look fuckin’ good for a dead man.

668
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:05,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

669
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:08,792
Hey, it’s me. It’s Paulie.
Just on weekend leave.

670
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,000
[Paulie] Let me buy you a drink.

671
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:15,083
You got somewhere you need to be?

672
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:19,000
Or you got five minutes for an old friend,
Captain?

673
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:32,458
Congratulations.

674
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,500
It’s bullshit.

675
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:37,458
Three years in Okinawa.

676
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:40,417
There’s no one fighting anymore,
so what’s the point of this?

677
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:43,167
I don’t know.

678
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,875
You ever go out there?
Where they dropped the first one?

679
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:47,000
No.

680
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:49,125
I did.

681
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:53,417
The fuckin’ rats
almost built it all up again.

682
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:57,625
Look at you.

683
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,750
Looks like made
a good fuckin’ life for yourself,

684
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,667
dressed up like a lounge singer.

685
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:08,333
You live here? Osaka?

686
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,167
I got a little place.

687
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:15,667
[chuckles]

688
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:19,333
You weren’t always so calm and quiet.
You know that?

689
01:20:21,292 --> 01:20:23,542
Maybe you just didn’t know me so well.

690
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:26,500
No, I guess not.

691
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:31,833
I got leave for another day.
I should come by, see your place.

692
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:37,542
No.

693
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:40,417
-No?
-No.

694
01:20:43,292 --> 01:20:44,542
Your five minutes is up.

695
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:49,750
-Is that how it is, huh?
-Yeah.

696
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:52,417
Can’t drink with a guy
from your own fuckin’ unit.

697
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,625
Congrats on your stripes.

698
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:04,917
Yeah? Hey, fuck you.

699
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:09,833
If I didn’t know better,
I’d say you were dodging court-martial.

700
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:14,250
Can’t wait to hear what the guys are gonna
say when I tell them who I bumped into.

701
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:17,083
I’m sure someone would love
to come pay you a visit.

702
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,583
No, you know what? I’m sorry.

703
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:24,708
Wow.

704
01:21:31,292 --> 01:21:33,500
Why don’t you come back
and have a drink with me?

705
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:36,833
Old times.

706
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,792
You can see half of Osaka from here.

707
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:51,750
Not bad, huh?

708
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,125
Americans.

709
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,875
I still got a couple contacts.

710
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:05,375
Cheers.

711
01:22:06,042 --> 01:22:07,250
Old times’ sake.

712
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:08,417
Old times’ sake.

713
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:15,208
Listen.

714
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:17,667
I know you’re not in the army anymore,

715
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,375
and I can see you got
a good thing going here.

716
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25,542
Man, I always liked you.

717
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:31,250
Don’t worry. Okay?
Your secret’s safe with me.

718
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:33,042
Thank you. I appreciate that.

719
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:35,875
All right.

720
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:42,417
Jesus, man.

721
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:43,917
I mean…

722
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:47,375
Yeah.

723
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,250
You like whiskey?

724
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:53,125
Yeah.

725
01:22:54,042 --> 01:22:55,958
I have got a surprise for you.

726
01:22:57,917 --> 01:22:59,167
Do your best.

727
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,667
-I’m sorry.
-What?

728
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:22,792
[gasps, gurgles]

729
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:10,167
[Nick] Miyu.

730
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:13,958
[knocking]

731
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:21,625
Miyu?

732
01:24:39,542 --> 01:24:41,708
-Are you okay? Hey.
-[whimpers]

733
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,125
-Hey.
-Just…

734
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:51,250
Who did this to you?

735
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,833
-Just go.
-Who did this to you?

736
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,125
There’s a baby in me.

737
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,167
There’s a baby in me.

738
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:17,750
It’s ours.

739
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:22,625
Who hurt you?

740
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:29,833
[in Japanese]
It doesn’t matter who did this to me.

741
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,042
Just leave it.

742
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:39,708
Maybe you want to protect me…

743
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:43,833
but I don’t want that.

744
01:25:49,917 --> 01:25:50,958
Do you get it?

745
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:56,375
I’ve been fine my whole life.

746
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:01,542
I’m fine with it.

747
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:51,000
[knocking]

748
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,083
Who’s there?

749
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,583
Who’s there?

750
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:02,583
Nick.

751
01:27:05,875 --> 01:27:07,083
I betrayed you.

752
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:14,833
She’s gonna have a kid.

753
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:23,333
You want me to leave? I’ll leave.

754
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:26,500
You say the word.

755
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:31,333
You leave my sister…

756
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:33,792
with your child?

757
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:35,958
Is that who you are?

758
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,500
I don’t know.

759
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:47,292
Get inside.

760
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:51,958
[in Japanese] Hang on.

761
01:29:09,417 --> 01:29:11,125
[in English] You know what these are?

762
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:17,875
They were my father’s.

763
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:20,292
He left our home when I was young.

764
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:22,333
My sister was a baby.

765
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:25,708
The day he left, he was drunk,

766
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:29,333
and he came to me in the night with these.

767
01:29:31,417 --> 01:29:32,542
And he said,

768
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:34,958
“This is <i>daisho</i>.

769
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:37,250
One for war, one for honor.

770
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:40,083
One to kill, one to decapitate.

771
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:43,167
One for murder, one for suicide.”

772
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,042
<i>Katana</i> and <i>wakizashi</i>.

773
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:51,542
This never left a warrior’s side,
even in his sleep.

774
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:53,542
It was his honor.

775
01:29:55,042 --> 01:29:57,958
My father told me the <i>daisho</i> was mine now.

776
01:29:58,458 --> 01:30:01,833
Because I was the one
with a family to look after. My sister.

777
01:30:16,167 --> 01:30:18,667
She’s yours to protect now.

778
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,375
You understand?

779
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,125
If you are my brother, take them.

780
01:30:40,792 --> 01:30:41,708
What?

781
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:45,167
There’s just one other thing.

782
01:30:46,417 --> 01:30:47,417
What is it?

783
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:52,667
[panting]

784
01:30:56,542 --> 01:30:57,375
That will do.

785
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:06,667
Okay.

786
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:12,167
[Kiyoshi grunts]

787
01:31:16,583 --> 01:31:18,958
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome, brother.

788
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,875
Thanks to you, I’m now in a conflict
with my father’s childhood friend.

789
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:36,167
Do you know what the other families think?

790
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:40,208
Does it look like I’m in control?

791
01:31:41,875 --> 01:31:45,208
Hey. I’m talking to you. Look at me.

792
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:53,750
The Shiromatsu family is broken.
They pose no threat.

793
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:57,958
Trust me.

794
01:31:59,833 --> 01:32:02,125
You don’t need to get your hands dirty.

795
01:32:04,667 --> 01:32:08,250
[giggling]

796
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:36,083
[man] Welcome, Mr. Shiromatsu.

797
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:39,208
I’m all yours.

798
01:32:39,292 --> 01:32:40,625
[man] Please come in.

799
01:33:14,417 --> 01:33:15,625
It’s a beautiful day.

800
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:19,250
Beautiful day.

801
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:43,583
[choking]

802
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:51,250
-[gunshot]
-[Akihiro gasping]

803
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:05,208
[Kiyoshi] Father.

804
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:08,500
[in Japanese] Get in, Nick.

805
01:34:12,042 --> 01:34:14,708
What’s going on? Where is Orochi?

806
01:34:15,292 --> 01:34:16,500
What the hell?

807
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,917
We will circle the streets
until we find them.

808
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,000
Please duck down.

809
01:34:22,083 --> 01:34:23,375
Fuck.

810
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:31,958
[Nick] Are you okay?

811
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:34,667
[tires squealing]

812
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,500
Kiyoshi.

813
01:34:39,458 --> 01:34:41,458
Kiyoshi. Kiyoshi.

814
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:44,208
-No. Oh, jeez.
-[moaning]

815
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:54,208
[in Japanese] Brother.

816
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:02,417
[in English] It’s okay.

817
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:06,167
It’s okay.

818
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:42,000
[man] Orochi, Yasushi, Banjo, Shuichi,

819
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:46,250
Ryuhei, Taro, Ichiro,

820
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:50,167
Kazuo, Yuta, Eiichi.

821
01:35:52,667 --> 01:35:58,083
That car was full of Seizu,
not our people.

822
01:35:58,167 --> 01:35:59,583
[man] Orochi!

823
01:35:59,667 --> 01:36:01,708
You can’t be sure.

824
01:36:06,292 --> 01:36:08,500
A fifth of our men have betrayed us.

825
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:13,333
We cannot go to war with Seizu.

826
01:36:14,333 --> 01:36:16,083
We cannot win this!

827
01:36:16,833 --> 01:36:18,625
[in Japanese] It doesn’t matter who wins.

828
01:36:21,792 --> 01:36:24,375
You should care who wins.

829
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:33,125
They will send the killers into hiding
in Kyoto, Nara, Tokyo.

830
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,375
Now is not the time.

831
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:38,917
Then…

832
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,250
when is the time?

833
01:36:43,375 --> 01:36:47,292
This is for your sake too.
Don’t you get it?

834
01:36:52,417 --> 01:36:53,750
Is this war?

835
01:36:58,333 --> 01:36:59,833
Is this war?

836
01:37:02,792 --> 01:37:04,250
Is this war?

837
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:07,625
Nick.

838
01:37:07,708 --> 01:37:09,750
Miyu is outside. You should go to her.

839
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,250
[no audible dialogue]

840
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:41,375
[screaming]

841
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:27,542
[Kentaro] You’re making me hard.

842
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:30,208
[woman]
You like this kind of thing, right?

843
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:32,375
[Kentaro] Where are you going?

844
01:38:37,292 --> 01:38:39,042
You fucking <i>gaijin</i>.

845
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:40,250
That’s right.

846
01:39:13,958 --> 01:39:15,000
[man] Hey, stop.

847
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:41,000
[Akihiro] What is it?

848
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:49,833
-I have a message from the Seizu's boss.
-[grunts]

849
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:54,417
Please come tomorrow to the port factory,
which is neutral territory,

850
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:55,833
with no guns.

851
01:39:56,333 --> 01:39:58,375
He said he wants to end the war.

852
01:40:00,167 --> 01:40:05,375
He sent you here to tell me this?

853
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:07,292
Yes.

854
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:08,875
Thank you.

855
01:40:10,125 --> 01:40:11,292
You can leave now.

856
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,167
He told me to bring back your response.

857
01:40:15,292 --> 01:40:17,167
Right now?

858
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:18,875
Yes.

859
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,667
Understood.

860
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,250
I will meet him.

861
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:35,833
[man] Father.

862
01:41:36,083 --> 01:41:37,875
I know you are here!

863
01:41:39,042 --> 01:41:42,250
Get out here now
and show me your dirty face.

864
01:41:48,917 --> 01:41:50,417
What are you doing?

865
01:41:52,125 --> 01:41:53,625
I’m here!

866
01:41:55,417 --> 01:41:56,542
Here!

867
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:02,500
[Hiromitsu] You are a stubborn old man.

868
01:42:02,958 --> 01:42:04,208
A tough one.

869
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:06,250
I’ll give you that.

870
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,083
You killed many of my most important men.

871
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:13,083
What do you want?

872
01:42:13,167 --> 01:42:16,000
I don’t want anything from you.

873
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:20,333
But I have someone here who might.

874
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,833
Orochi.

875
01:43:05,917 --> 01:43:08,208
You are my son.

876
01:43:09,958 --> 01:43:11,750
It’s not too late.

877
01:43:13,458 --> 01:43:14,750
Come back.

878
01:43:38,208 --> 01:43:39,667
I wanted to.

879
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:48,125
[all shouting]

880
01:44:05,083 --> 01:44:06,542
My son.

881
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:31,333
The Shiromatsu family no longer exists.

882
01:44:32,917 --> 01:44:35,417
The head of the Seizu is a generous man.

883
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,375
He wants all of you to live.

884
01:44:39,167 --> 01:44:40,417
[in English] For you…

885
01:44:41,167 --> 01:44:45,458
I can offer you peace if you leave Osaka
and your woman behind.

886
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:49,500
We make no promises for her safety
if you stay.

887
01:44:54,542 --> 01:44:57,000
[in Japanese] Do you accept?

888
01:45:01,167 --> 01:45:03,083
[in English] You’re all idiots.

889
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:08,500
[Takeshi] You are a traitor.

890
01:45:09,083 --> 01:45:10,583
-Fight me.
-Takeshi.

891
01:45:11,125 --> 01:45:11,958
Fight me.

892
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:14,083
Fight me!

893
01:45:14,167 --> 01:45:15,625
Orochi!

894
01:45:19,375 --> 01:45:20,333
[gunshot]

895
01:45:23,458 --> 01:45:25,792
[winces, groans]

896
01:45:58,917 --> 01:46:00,500
[Nick shouts]

897
01:46:10,292 --> 01:46:12,417
-Get out!
-[crowd murmuring]

898
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:21,250
[officer yelling]

899
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:04,708
What--

900
01:47:06,833 --> 01:47:08,208
Shh.

901
01:47:11,667 --> 01:47:12,958
Akihiro.

902
01:47:15,042 --> 01:47:16,042
He’s dead. He’s gone.

903
01:47:18,542 --> 01:47:21,167
Orochi, he killed him.

904
01:47:22,333 --> 01:47:25,833
Now, you pack a bag and we go together.

905
01:47:26,458 --> 01:47:27,292
Yes?

906
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,500
-Yes.
-Okay.

907
01:47:30,583 --> 01:47:33,833
Now get your things, and we leave.

908
01:47:33,917 --> 01:47:35,667
Now. Now.

909
01:47:43,625 --> 01:47:46,625
[phone ringing]

910
01:47:57,125 --> 01:48:00,000
[ringing continues]

911
01:48:04,167 --> 01:48:05,167
Hello?

917
01:50:26,417 --> 01:50:29,917
-You!

918
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,542
[all yelling, grunting]

919
01:50:43,208 --> 01:50:46,208
[panting]

920
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,375
[Hiromitsu] Look at me.

921
01:50:58,958 --> 01:51:00,292
[in English] What do you want?

922
01:51:04,542 --> 01:51:07,167
[in English] I want you to allow me…

923
01:51:08,875 --> 01:51:09,792
to kill him.

924
01:51:14,875 --> 01:51:16,125
Give this warrior a weapon

925
01:51:16,208 --> 01:51:20,708
and let him show us
how strong and brave he really is.

926
01:51:24,375 --> 01:51:26,167
What do you have to fear...

927
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,458
[in Japanese] brother?

928
01:51:41,625 --> 01:51:43,625
[in English] You walk into my home.

929
01:51:44,625 --> 01:51:48,167
You take my brother,
you poison my father’s mind.

930
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:50,250
Poison him against me.

931
01:51:50,792 --> 01:51:53,417
Someone has to put out the fire.

932
01:51:56,292 --> 01:51:59,292
You think you are a <i>yakuza</i> with this?

933
01:52:00,375 --> 01:52:02,000
You aren’t a <i>yakuza</i>.

934
01:52:02,542 --> 01:52:05,792
You are a <i>gaijin</i>. Outsider.

935
01:52:05,875 --> 01:52:08,500
You are just the way my brother found you.

936
01:52:10,583 --> 01:52:11,417
Get up.

937
01:52:15,208 --> 01:52:16,208
Get up!

938
01:52:23,625 --> 01:52:26,500
No. I won’t fight you.

939
01:52:36,958 --> 01:52:38,583
[shouting]

940
01:52:38,667 --> 01:52:40,042
