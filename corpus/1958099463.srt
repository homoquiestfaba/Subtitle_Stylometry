1
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,500
(ominous music)

2
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,208
Thanks.

3
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,750
Thanks for waiting.

4
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,583
(car faintly honks)

5
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:15,208
My therapist thinks that I
should stop talking to you.

6
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:22,999
Which is confusing because she's the one

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,125
who suggested I start talking
to you in the first place.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,583
She thinks that I can't move on.

9
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,333
I need you.

10
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,500
And I know that you need me.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So...

12
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,416
I'm just gonna have to
find another therapist.

13
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,416
(car beeps)

14
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,666
Ready?

15
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,041
Um, he was apparently dating
some girl at the time who,

16
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,125
whenever they would get in
an argument, she'd be like,

17
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,208
"Well, you've never even seen Casablanca"

18
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,416
As if that was some sort
of like a pre-requisite

19
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,291
for being in a relationship.

20
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,291
And I was just there that day

21
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,583
because I had family in town

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,250
and I needed to escape for a few hours.

23
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,642
But every time we would get in a fight

24
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,083
he would just look at me and go,

25
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,791
"Here's looking at you, kid."

26
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,375
(calming choral music)

27
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,017
[Emory] And listen, I know
you haven't felt up to it,

28
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,583
but it is so important that
you keep your audience engaged.

29
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,125
They're worried about you.

30
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,458
You need to share your process.

31
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,833
Remember who you are.

32
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:08,666
[Faye] Mhm.

33
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,208
[Emory] You're Faye fuckin' Ryan.

34
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,125
Say it with me, you invented the new TLC.

35
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,500
TL-

36
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,458
- TLSC.

37
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,625
[Emory] Tender-

38
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,333
- Tender Love and Self Care.

39
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,708
(Faye chuckles)

40
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,875
T-L-S-C.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,875
(Faye laughs)

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,392
[Emory] I hate to do this to you.

43
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,976
You know we all love
you here at Lighthouse,

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,500
and we really want to
continue publishing your work.

45
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,458
But sweetie, if you can't
get me a first draft

46
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,125
or at least the first three chapters

47
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
by the end of the month,

48
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,541
then I'm afraid we're
gonna have to drop you.

49
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,500
Wow, okay.

50
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,291
I thought I had 'til March.

51
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,750
[Emory] I know what we should do.

52
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,625
I have a plan.

53
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,041
Look, I have a family cabin

54
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,606
that we never use this time of year,

55
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,458
it's in Louisiana, on the bayou.

56
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,250
It has everything you need.

57
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,935
I'll make sure it's stocked for a week.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What do you say?

59
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,916
Faye, you need to get out of town!

60
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,208
I used to love driving.

61
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:09,875
Every Saturday morning, when
Jacob and I first got married,

62
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,083
we would go golfing,

63
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,875
and I would just take a drive.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,166
It honestly didn't even
matter where I was going,

65
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,041
I could be aimless.

66
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,333
I would roll down the windows

67
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,958
and blare my favorite music

68
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,916
that Jacob thought was
obnoxious, but that I loved.

69
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,666
I would stop at a fast food restaurant

70
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,416
and get french fries and just drive.

71
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,041
I loved it.

72
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,500
Now I hate it.

73
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,458
(Faye vomits)

74
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,583
(plucky country music)

75
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,708
Hey, everybody.

76
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,375
You know, I've been pretty quiet on here,

77
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,083
but I just wanted to tell you that

78
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,541
I really appreciate all of your messages

79
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,125
and I'm still here.

80
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:32,125
And I just got to this amazing place,

81
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,916
'cause I'm going to be getting
back to writing this week,

82
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,583
so stay tuned.

83
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,166
Oh.

84
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,333
Score!

85
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,375
And I have a porch swing, so,

86
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,708
everything's gonna be fine.

87
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,583
(plucky country music)

88
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:08,958
(construction tools buzzing)

89
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,458
Cool.

90
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,875
Hey, guys.

91
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,166
Oh, hey, Joe, Randy.

92
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:25,625
Thanks for coming to my
peaceful writing retreat.

93
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,750
Come over for dinner, I'm makin' gumbo.

94
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,625
Just kidding, I don't know how to cook.

95
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,000
(door creaks)

96
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,208
Wow.

97
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,500
Ugh.

98
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,541
Oh, Lord.

99
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,625
(catchy dark music)

100
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,666
So, when I was 10 years old,

101
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,166
I was sitting in church with my family,

102
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,874
and when the entire congregation

103
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,500
bowed their heads to
pray, I remember thinking,

104
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:03,832
"Why are we looking down when we pray?

105
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,125
Like, isn't that where the devil lives?"

106
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,666
What the fuck?

107
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,125
I mean, it's kinda cool, but why?

108
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay, Emory.

109
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,208
Don't have any of my other books. Cool.

110
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:34,208
It's not like I've been a
best seller three times.

111
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,125
No thanks.

112
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,458
(lawnmower revs)

113
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,083
Wow, guys.

114
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,958
Really going to town over there.

115
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,833
If we're talking to God, why
aren't we looking up at him?

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,375
So then, I made this agreement

117
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,708
that every time I closed my eye,

118
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,666
or like I blinked, I would look up at God.

119
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,457
It would be like I was, you know saying

120
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,166
all of these little miniature
prayers throughout the day.

121
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:14,374
So, yeah, every time I
blinked, I'd look up at God,

122
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:18,125
and it turns out you blink
a lot during the day.

123
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,125
So then I was like okay,

124
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,083
I'm going to make this easier on myself.

125
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,541
Every time I blink and
swallow at the same time,

126
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,291
that's when I look up at God.

127
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:31,458
So then it became this thing,

128
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,625
and I developed a tic,

129
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,833
and then my mom told me
that I was making people

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,517
feel uncomfortable when I was doing it

131
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,208
and also she told me it wasn't pretty.

132
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,375
So, she obviously didn't know

133
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,541
I was trying to ensure my salvation.

134
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,916
(catchy dark music)

135
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,625
You're just a bitch.

136
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,000
You're a hateful bitch.

137
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,083
I have OCD.

138
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,875
(calming music)

139
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,041
Chapter...

140
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,250
One.

141
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:53,416
♪ What you mean to me, to me ♪

142
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,375
♪ But it's not that easy ♪

143
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,750
Remember that time that
we went to the Everglades?

144
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,875
Yeah, that was fun.

145
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,791
This place kinda reminds me
of that, don't you think?

146
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,750
Do we have a ghost?

147
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,875
Piece of shit.

148
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,041
(phone buzzes)

149
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,458
Sorry, babe, it's my mom.

150
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,000
Hey, mom.

151
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:40,958
[Mom] Sweetheart, where are you?

152
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,333
We had dinner plans.

153
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,666
Ugh, um, shit, sorry.

154
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,892
[Mom] Are you coming still?

155
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,101
You want Bobby to come pick you up?

156
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,291
No, I actually can't make it tonight,

157
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,958
I'm not in town.

158
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:52,916
[Mom] Where are you?

159
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,291
I'm in Louisiana.

160
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,166
[Mom] Louisiana?

161
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,208
At Emory's cabin for the week.

162
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,333
I have to write.

163
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,000
[Mom] Oh, okay.

164
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,809
How did you get there, did you fly?

165
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,916
Uh, I drove.

166
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,375
♪ But it's not that easy ♪

167
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,541
Mom?

168
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,541
[Mom] Well, your brother's here.

169
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,833
You tell him you're not coming.

170
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,184
[Bobby] You know I can't make it

171
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,166
through these family dinners without you.

172
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,291
Hi, Bobby.

173
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:25,958
Sorry to disappoint.

174
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,625
[Bobby] Calm down, I forgive you.

175
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,375
Hey, can I ask you a real question?

176
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,791
Nope, only a fake one.

177
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:33,750
[Bobby] Ha, ha, ha.

178
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,166
Hey, is Ellie there?

179
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,851
[Bobby] Don't you get
contractual bereavement?

180
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,208
Yeah, it's up.

181
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,625
[Bobby] Who decides
how much time that is?

182
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,791
That's bullshit.

183
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,041
El, honey.

184
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:44,833
[Ellie] Fifi!

185
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,500
Hi, babygirl.

186
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,916
[Ellie] Fifi, are you coming?

187
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,166
No, I'm sorry.

188
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,082
It'll have to be next time, okay?

189
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:52,583
[Ellie] Okay.

190
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:54,375
Hey, I heard you
started swimming lessons.

191
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,666
Do you like them?

192
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,208
[Ellie] Yeah.

193
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,125
But sometimes the other kids are mean.

194
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,541
Do you want me to kill them?

195
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,083
(Ellie laughs)

196
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,083
No, don't ever kill
anyone, that's not funny.

197
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,583
Fifi has had too much juice.

198
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,375
Don't tell your dad I said that?

199
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,541
(Ellie laughs)

200
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,666
Okay, I gotta go.

201
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,125
[Ellie] Why?

202
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,500
But Fifi loves you
so, so much, babygirl.

203
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,666
[Ellie] Love you.

204
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,333
Okay, can you put Gam back on?

205
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,625
[Ellie] Okay.

206
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,833
Gam!

207
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,333
[Mom] Hey, hun.

208
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,458
Hey, Mom.

209
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,375
I gotta...

210
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,125
[Mom] Faye?

211
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,958
(eerie music)

212
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,666
Faye, you okay?

213
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,291
Yeah, hey, tell dad I love
you guys, but I gotta go.

214
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,541
[Mom] Okay.

215
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:49,416
What?

216
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,791
The way Jacob and I met was
straight out of a rom-com movie.

217
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,333
It was...

218
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,333
We were the only two people
in this movie theater

219
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,958
for a matinee showing of Casablanca,

220
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,833
which if you've ever seen
that movie, you know,

221
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,000
doesn't really garner laughter.

222
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,708
But I was, and still am to a degree,

223
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,415
so uncomfortable with,
like, super romantic things

224
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:25,125
that I would just laugh, I
would uncontrollably laugh

225
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,875
throughout the entire movie.

226
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,184
Anyways, at the end of the movie

227
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,583
when the credits were rolling,

228
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,041
I just heard him yell from
the back of the theater,

229
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,083
"Well, that was the dumbest
piece of shit I've ever seen!"

230
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:44,416
And yeah, we walked out together,
and the rest was history.

231
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,583
How rude.

232
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,041
I bet it was you.

233
00:14:55,166 --> 00:15:00,250
You seemed sketch since
the moment I saw you.

234
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,791
Babe!

235
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,666
Let's dance.

236
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,791
Hm?

237
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,541
Whoa.

238
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,916
(Faye chuckles)

239
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,166
Come on.

240
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,166
Come on!

241
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,375
Get up.

242
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,625
Fifi's had...

243
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,791
A lot of juice, you're
gonna have to hold me up.

244
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,041
Come on, come on.

245
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,250
Oh!

246
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,375
Mm.

247
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,541
(calming music)

248
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,875
Okay.

249
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,041
(Faye chuckles)

250
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,750
Babe?

251
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,333
Babe, let's go to bed.

252
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,750
Come on.

253
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,916
(Faye laughs)

254
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,166
Babe!

255
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,041
(Faye chuckles)

256
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:31,916
Babe.

257
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,666
(Faye laughs)

258
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,458
Stop!

259
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,000
(Faye chuckles)

260
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,041
(ominous music)

261
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:51,833
(Slap)

262
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,666
(jarring music)

263
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,541
(Faye breathes heavily)

264
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,375
Okay.

265
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,833
Okay.

266
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,375
(Faye laughs)

267
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,708
Okay, you did that.

268
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,416
(Faye breathes heavily)

269
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,541
No.

270
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,625
Fuck.

271
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,041
(eerie music)

272
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,583
Oh my God.

273
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,333
(tense music)

274
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,041
Ah.

275
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,291
Oh my God.

276
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,041
Ah.

277
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,750
(Faye groans)

278
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,708
(Faye sighs)

279
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,500
(mysterious music)

280
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,750
Why?

281
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,416
Why?

282
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,833
Ah.

283
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,041
What the fuck?

284
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,541
Oh my God.

285
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,916
What the fuck is that?

286
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:30,958
What?

287
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,250
Ugh.

288
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:42,916
Wow, Faye.

289
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,791
You're an alcoholic.

290
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,041
Hey!

291
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,325
[Emory] Yesterday was great.

292
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,916
I wanted to tell you that I thik

293
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,416
you should post a few more
videos today for your followers.

294
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,750
Just remember to let them in on...

295
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,750
Emory?

296
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,500
I hope there's another one of these.

297
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,541
You know what's funny?

298
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,000
I've always been advised
by people in the industry

299
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,541
to be authentic.

300
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,916
You know, to share my truth.

301
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,500
Because they think that audiences somehow

302
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,583
can detect when somebody's being honest,

303
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,833
and if they're being honest,

304
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,166
then they'll be more attracted.

305
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,083
You know, I'll sell more
books, I'll be more popular.

306
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,541
Bullshit.

307
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,625
Why so sad?

308
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,500
I'll give you some water
after I go tell my fans

309
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,416
about my process.

310
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,416
What?

311
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,208
People hear what they want to hear.

312
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,500
Hey, everyone.

313
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,541
It is absolutely beautiful out here,

314
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,416
I wish you guys could
all see it in person.

315
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,601
But I just wanted to pop back in

316
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,708
and say that the book is going great.

317
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,375
I cannot wait for the day

318
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,041
that I get to share it with you.

319
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,750
Leave me a comment below,

320
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,500
and let me know what you're
excited about this week,

321
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:22,125
and I'm gonna go start a new chapter.

322
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,041
I'm gonna go start a new chapter.

323
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,916
(calming music)

324
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,750
Hey, babe?

325
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,416
(insects chirping)

326
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,958
Um, hey, I'm gonna go
take a walk really quick

327
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,583
if that's okay?

328
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,916
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

329
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,916
Babe, I promise, I'm fine.

330
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,625
Go start dinner, I'll
be there in a second.

331
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:46,083
(Faye breathes heavily)

332
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,625
You're fine, you're fine.

333
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,625
Okay.

334
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,583
(eerie music)

335
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:08,208
(Faye breathes heavily)

336
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:24,791
Okay.

337
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,083
Faye, you're okay.

338
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,125
You're okay.

339
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,583
Okay.

340
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,750
Okay.

341
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,500
Okay.

342
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,041
When I was in 4th grade, Rachel Schaefer

343
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,916
invited me to one of her slumber parties.

344
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,666
I didn't have very many
friends when I was younger,

345
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,666
so I was super excited about it.

346
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:09,208
Anyways, when Rachel's parents
went up to go to sleep,

347
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,708
Rachel snuck upstairs and
grabbed the movie Halloween.

348
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,875
I remember trying my hardest

349
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,375
to act like I wasn't scared.

350
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:23,708
I thought maybe that would
make them all like me.

351
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:29,875
I woke up the next morning
covered in my own piss.

352
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,458
I found out years later
that they had dipped my hand

353
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,625
in warm water while I was sleeping.

354
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,750
Yeah, I fucking hate Rachel Shaefer.

355
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,791
Should we have kids?

356
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,875
I know I said I didn't
want them, but maybe.

357
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,833
Are you sure you're not hungry?

358
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,125
I know, I know.

359
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,916
All work and no play makes Faye...

360
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,791
so tired.

361
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:21,666
You don't want to be here, do you?

362
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,083
It's okay, I can tell.

363
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,666
Should I just call Emory?

364
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,666
I should just call.

365
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,250
I should just call and say I'm done.

366
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:49,375
Let's just take the year off and travel.

367
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,740
I mean, we missed our honeymoon

368
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,708
because I was doing this shit.

369
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:56,333
Let's go live out your
Bizarre Foods fantasy.

370
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,291
What do you say?

371
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,708
I don't want this.

372
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,750
I want you.

373
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,291
Do you think I'm a good writer?

374
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,166
Be honest, do you really?

375
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:24,000
(ominous music)

376
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:26,666
What was that?

377
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:30,208
(lights buzzing)

378
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,875
What was that?

379
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,375
What was that?

380
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:38,875
Did you hear that?

381
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:40,583
Did you hear that?

382
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,125
Say something!

383
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,666
Sorry, I'm sorry.

384
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,291
(Faye sobs)

385
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,750
Okay, I'm just gonna see what it is.

386
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,958
Okay, okay.

387
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,750
(Faye sobs)

388
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,916
(ominous music)

389
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:27,500
What is in this-who the
hell is in this house?

390
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,458
Get out, please, leave me alone.

391
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,166
Am I going crazy?

392
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:37,375
(ominous music)

393
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,791
I'm gonna go check upstairs.

394
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,916
(ominous music)

395
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:35,416
Hey, Jacob.

396
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:39,541
(ominous music)

397
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:08,083
(Faye groaning)

398
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:12,125
[Jacob] If you do this...

399
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:18,916
[Faye] You know this
night is important to me...

400
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,291
(heart faintly beating)

401
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:49,958
Get in the closet, we'll just wait.

402
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:53,541
(ominous music)

403
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,125
The movie Halloween was
super terrifying though.

404
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,208
For years I couldn't walk home from school

405
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,208
without looking over my shoulder

406
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,853
thinking that there was gonna be a man

407
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,666
in a white mask following me.

408
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,291
I don't know.

409
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,125
He was so calm.

410
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,875
You know, and he walked so slow,

411
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,333
I think that's what made it so terrifying,

412
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
he was gonna get what he wanted.

413
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,333
And I always thought it was so annoying

414
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:52,541
how everybody loved Jamie
Lee Curtis's character

415
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,333
because she survived.

416
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:58,083
You know, she like hides in
the closet and still survives.

417
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,250
I just wanted to scream
at people and be like,

418
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:04,458
"Surviving isn't fun!"

419
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:12,041
Like honestly, I'd rather be
the one that gets murdered.

420
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,625
(lights buzzing)

421
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,416
(Faye screams)

422
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:20,333
(ominous music)

423
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:30,541
Holy shit.

424
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:39,541
(birds chirping)

425
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,041
Ah.

426
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:14,416
(mysterious music)

427
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,791
And this from the Times Book Review.

428
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,833
"Faye Ryan is what we
would get if Brené Brown

429
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,875
and Amy Schumer had a
semi-cynical little sister

430
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,083
who is simply wise beyond her years.

431
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,708
This time, Faye puts the grieving process

432
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:42,791
into a new perspective.

433
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,791
Both personal and heartbreaking,

434
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,625
Faye peppers the prose with
her signature dark humor,

435
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,666
albeit a little darker
than usual this go around.

436
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:56,500
We could all learn a lesson
in the dangers of loneliness,

437
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,791
as Faye writes like she's texting

438
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,416
her best friend late at night

439
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:05,750
in what is her most vulnerable
and raw work to date."

440
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:15,541
I actually kinda like that one.

441
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,208
[Emory] Faye, guess what?

442
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,791
You're back up on the
Times Best Seller list.

443
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:23,583
Really?

444
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:24,708
[Emory] Yes!

445
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,125
Why?

446
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,517
[Emory] Because you're
engaging your audience, Faye.

447
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,083
They know you're writing again.

448
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,625
Everybody wants to get a head
start before the next one.

449
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,958
Keep it up!

450
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,041
So, how far along are we?

451
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:39,791
Um, it looks like two chapters.

452
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:41,000
[Emory] Excellent.

453
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,142
Was the fridge stocked? Are you eating?

454
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,333
Is everything good up there?

455
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,875
Uh, yes, yeah.

456
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,541
Thank you again for that.

457
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:51,125
[Emory] Okay, I'll check in tomorrow.

458
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,041
Hey, Em.

459
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:53,083
[Emory] Yup?

460
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,291
Um...

461
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:02,791
Have you ever experienced
anything, like, paranormal here?

462
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,958
[Emory] Oh, yeah,
there's a ghost for sure.

463
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,458
His name's Randy.

464
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,083
He's totally friendly.

465
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:10,958
Really?

466
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:11,833
[Emory] What?

467
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:12,958
No!

468
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,017
It's just quiet out there.

469
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,875
You can hear the wind at night.

470
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,833
(Emory laughs)

471
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:17,958
Hey, take it easy, Faye.

472
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:18,833
Okay, babe?

473
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,000
Okay, bye, Em.

474
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,208
[Emory] Bye.

475
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:27,250
(mysterious music)

476
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,916
(lock turns)

477
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:01,958
Okay.

478
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:04,291
Okay!

479
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,750
(Faye chuckles)

480
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:08,875
You got me!

481
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:11,958
You got me.

482
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,416
Come out!

483
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,833
Come on out!

484
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:24,708
Come out, come out, wherever yo!

485
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:28,791
(Faye chuckles)

486
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:31,708
Okay.

487
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,833
Well, if you're not gonna let me out,

488
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:39,791
then why don't you join
me for breakfast, huh?

489
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:42,916
Yeah, come on.

490
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:46,708
You think this is funny, right?

491
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:50,166
I could use a laugh.

492
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:51,333
(Faye laughs)

493
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:56,000
So, why don't you tell me a joke?

494
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,166
Yeah.

495
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,375
Come on.

496
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,166
I'm waiting!

497
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,708
No.

498
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:19,791
You know what would be
better than breakfast?

499
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,250
You're gonna like this.

500
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,541
(Faye chuckles)

501
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,333
You want a drink?

502
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:29,500
Hm?

503
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:30,708
'Cause I do.

504
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:34,291
Yeah.

505
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:38,625
Let's have a drink, why don't
you come join me at the table?

506
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,416
Let's drink like a family.

507
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:49,125
I'm still waiting on my joke.

508
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,041
Okay.

509
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,791
Okay.

510
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,166
I'll start.

511
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,333
I'll start.

512
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,000
You ready for this one?

513
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,083
This is hilarious.

514
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:09,208
(Faye chuckles)

515
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:13,916
My husband was a saint.

516
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:22,250
And he fuckin' died in a
car crash because of me!

517
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,125
Yeah, I know!

518
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,291
Because I just had to go to another event

519
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:33,166
to win some dumb award for
another book that I wrote,

520
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:37,250
a book that I pulled
right on out of my ass.

521
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,791
(Faye laughs)

522
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:40,916
Mm.

523
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,458
He didn't even want to go.

524
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,583
Huh-uh.

525
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:54,041
He probably didn't want to go
to any of them, but he did.

526
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,416
For me.

527
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,625
For me.

528
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,583
(Faye laughs)

529
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:05,833
Now here I am, alive.

530
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,333
So alive!

531
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,916
(Faye laughs)

532
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:16,541
Isn't that funny?

533
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,541
So, what do you do around here?

534
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,750
Just like, hang out?

535
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,791
Knock shit over?

536
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:31,375
You just go around slapping other people's

537
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,083
upper pussy area, you fuckin' dick?

538
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:36,791
That was my me time.

539
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,875
Oh, wow.

540
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,208
Oh.

541
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
What's behind door number two?

542
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:49,041
Mm.

543
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,166
Oh.

544
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,916
(ominous music)

545
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,666
(Faye laughs)

546
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,208
That's good.

547
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:04,291
Okay!

548
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:06,250
(Faye chuckles)

549
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,833
I get it.

550
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,541
That's good, that's so funny!

551
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:15,250
You are so, okay.

552
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:24,874
A disturbed, young, self-help
author slash recent widow

553
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:29,083
finds a Ouija board and
dies in a cabin in the woods

554
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,916
while she's trying to
contact her dead husband!

555
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:34,708
(Faye chuckles)

556
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:38,291
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

557
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,750
That's rich.

558
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,291
Listen, Captain Howdy.

559
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,583
I don't write fiction.

560
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:59,708
I write things that are
loosely based on the truth.

561
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,750
Sometimes I wonder if I'm a narcissist

562
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:04,333
because I make everything about me,

563
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:09,541
but then other times I think
I can't be a narcissist

564
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:12,625
because I am literally the last person

565
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,166
that I want to be around.

566
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,291
Hey.

567
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:18,125
Hey, do you follow me on social?

568
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,333
How am I doing?

569
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,041
Did I tell you I'm a best seller?

570
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,833
Mhm, whoop-dee!

571
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:31,375
But we all know that success
doesn't mean anything

572
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:34,708
unless we have somebody to
share it with, right babe?

573
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,250
I got you, babe.

574
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:44,708
I got my baby and he is smokin' hot.

575
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:47,625
Mm.

576
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,666
Oh my God.

577
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:54,041
Let's take this shit-show live!

578
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:57,833
(Faye chuckles)

579
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,791
Hey, everybody.

580
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,208
I got a little writer's
retreat tip for you.

581
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:13,250
For one for your checklist.

582
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:15,958
Sometimes...

583
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:25,666
(Faye laughs)

584
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,666
I forgot what I was gonna say.

585
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,208
Oh, yeah.

586
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:36,375
Sometimes you have to get your
inspiration from the beyond!

587
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:45,916
Remember when every 12 year
old girl watched The Craft

588
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:49,375
and then played light as a
feather, stiff as a board?

589
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:54,625
We were all low-key in a coven.

590
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:56,916
So fucked up!

591
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:03,750
I'm at my publisher's cabin,

592
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:11,125
and it turns out she made
a deal with the devil.

593
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:14,416
(Faye chuckles)

594
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,916
So, leave a comment below
if you's a witchy hoe.

595
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:26,125
(catchy music)

596
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:31,125
(phone buzzes)

597
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,250
Oh.

598
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:35,166
Emory!

599
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:37,726
[Emory] What the fuck are
you doing, are you drunk?

600
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,000
(Faye laughs)

601
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:43,208
No, I'm enlightened.

602
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,916
[Emory] Faye, so help me
God, take down that last post.

603
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:48,750
Sober up, get yourself together.

604
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,666
If I didn't care for you as much as I do,

605
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:52,375
I would fire your ass right now.

606
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,250
Do it.

607
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:54,125
[Emory] Faye!

608
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,625
Do it!

609
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,642
[Emory] Faye, you're on such
fucking thin ice right now,

610
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,517
I will come down there if you
don't remove the last post,

611
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,101
and we will have to let you
go if you can't stop acting-

612
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,125
- You know, Emory-

613
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,406
- [Emory] Like a five year old.

614
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,833
I got a deal for you.

615
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:10,833
How about I don't write this book.

616
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,416
How 'bout dat?

617
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,250
[Emory] What the fuck are you doing?

618
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,458
How 'bout dat?

619
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,041
[Emory] Faye?

620
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:20,059
I understand that you're
having a rough day, okay?

621
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:23,416
Okay, I get that you're
re-living everything

622
00:45:23,541 --> 00:45:24,541
to write this book.

623
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,583
You don't know shit, Emory.

624
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,833
[Emory] Faye-

625
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:31,125
- Stop acting like you know what happened.

626
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:33,708
[Emory] You're right,
I don't know, but you do.

627
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,226
And it's up to you to help other people

628
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,730
who are going through the same thing.

629
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,208
Let them know they're not alone.

630
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:39,666
Mhm.

631
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:43,375
Except for they are alone.

632
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:46,875
I'm alone.

633
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:48,833
[Emory] You are not alone, Faye.

634
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:50,833
"You are not alone."

635
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:56,625
Remember when Michael Jackson
sang that song to Lisa Marie

636
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:01,041
and then they got a divorce,
and then she was alone?

637
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,791
(Faye chuckles)

638
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:06,458
Ah, and he got to keep Bubbles.

639
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:11,958
Those little boys, that was so fucked up.

640
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:13,500
[Emory] Faye.

641
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:16,833
Oh my God, I did love
that Free Willy song though.

642
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:18,375
[Emory] Faye!

643
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:20,000
What?

644
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,642
[Emory] I don't want to
stop you in your process,

645
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:23,791
but you cannot pull shit like this.

646
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:26,916
You'll be on TMZ tomorrow,
and your career will be over.

647
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:29,416
Oh no, that would be the worst!

648
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,375
Why don't you just take it down?

649
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,041
Hey, you take it down,
I'll give you my password.

650
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:39,458
Get a pen, get a paper, get your family,

651
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:43,291
get your husband, get your
things, write this down.

652
00:46:43,416 --> 00:46:46,833
My password is "imapieceofshit123”.

653
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:48,916
(Faye laughs)

654
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,666
[Emory] Okay, that's it.

655
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:51,500
I'm coming down there.

656
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:52,458
No!

657
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:53,625
No, no, no, no, no, no.

658
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:59,500
No, don't worry about it,
I'll take it down, I promise.

659
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:03,958
Just, God, take a joke.

660
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:06,041
[Emory] I'm not kidding, sober up.

661
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:08,833
Take a cold shower, and call me!

662
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:10,083
Okay.

663
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:20,125
Somebody has their panties in a wad.

664
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:23,000
Oh, okay.

665
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:26,500
Look at all you little witchy hoes.

666
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:30,916
I have to delete it, I'm sorry.

667
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:37,666
Hey.

668
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:39,916
Hey.

669
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:44,083
You want to play a game?

670
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:47,583
Yeah?

671
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:48,958
Okay.

672
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,666
Okay.

673
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:52,958
I just have to pee first.

674
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,458
Don't start without me.

675
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,500
I started writing when I was 9.

676
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,333
Yeah.

677
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:05,125
Every night before bed I
would write in my journal.

678
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:08,833
Felt like such an adult thing to do.

679
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:12,000
They're actually kind of cute
to look back and read now.

680
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:16,500
The problems I had back then were cute.

681
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:32,708
(mysterious music)

682
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,625
Did you wilt my flowers?

683
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:47,916
Rude.

684
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:06,541
Who are you?

685
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,541
Do I know you?

686
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,375
(tense music)

687
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,208
Jacob?

688
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,416
Is this Jacob?

689
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,500
Are you with him?

690
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,875
(ominous music)

691
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,500
(Faye breathes heavily)

692
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,083
(phone rings)

693
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,583
Please answer.

694
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:28,708
Please answer.

695
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,750
[Mom] Hey, hun.

696
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:32,875
Mom?

697
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:34,208
[Mom] Faye, what's wrong?

698
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:37,000
Did I make this happen?

699
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:38,333
[Mom] What?

700
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,458
Honey, what are you talking abo?

701
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,333
Was I a bad kid or something?

702
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,833
What did I do, I don't understand!

703
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:49,791
[Mom] Okay, calm down, just breathe.

704
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:50,958
I can't.

705
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,458
[Mom] Yes, you can.

706
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,208
Just breathe.

707
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,458
You have to do that, okay?

708
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:56,708
Okay, Mom.

709
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:57,833
[Mom] You're okay.

710
00:50:57,916 --> 00:50:58,916
I'm scared.

711
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,083
[Mom] Okay.

712
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,083
What are you scared of?

713
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:04,541
I don't know, I don't know, I-

714
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,750
- [Mom] Okay, all right, it's okay.

715
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:07,875
Just breathe.

716
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:10,000
Okay, you're okay.

717
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:15,166
Everything is just so messed up.

718
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,333
[Mom] You're okay.

719
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,875
It's not supposed to be like this,

720
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:22,250
I'm not supposed to be like this.

721
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:23,458
[Mom] Faye?

722
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,875
What do you mean, baby?

723
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:30,125
He's suppose to be here.

724
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,750
[Mom] Faye, honey, I know it hurts.

725
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:38,625
It hurts so fucking bad.

726
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,375
And it's my fault.

727
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,333
[Mom] Uh-uh, no, it
it is not your fault.

728
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:49,500
But if I just would've skipped the event

729
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:52,875
like he wanted to do,
then he would be here,

730
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,333
he would be here with me right now.

731
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:58,791
[Mom] All right, Faye,
I'm gonna come get you.

732
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,041
No, no.

733
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,309
[Mom] What's the address, where are you?

734
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:02,875
I need to finish.

735
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,833
[Mom] Tell me how to find
you, you need to come home.

736
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:11,583
Honey, baby, you cannot
keep blaming yourself.

737
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:14,583
Only God knows why it happened.

738
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:15,291
Mom.

739
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:16,583
[Mom] What, baby?

740
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:19,958
Faye?

741
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,125
I gotta go.

742
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,708
[Mom] No, Faye, no.

743
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:24,791
I love you.

744
00:52:24,916 --> 00:52:26,625
[Mom] Faye, do...

745
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:32,208
(lights buzz)
(Faye shrieks)

746
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:35,291
(ominous music)

747
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:45,625
Is this my punishment?

748
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,750
If you're gonna kill me, just do it!

749
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,791
No need to drag it out.

750
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,333
(tense music)

751
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:06,875
I already don't want
to be here, just do it!

752
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:08,916
Come on!

753
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,541
(dramatic music)

754
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,291
What are you?

755
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:18,750
Say something.

756
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,250
Fucking say something!

757
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:26,125
(ominous music)
(Faye screams)

758
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:31,666
No, no, no, please, please,
please, please, please.

759
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:35,166
Oh God, God.

760
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:37,958
God, why? Why? Please!

761
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:40,875
(ominous music)

762
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:48,833
Please, please!

763
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:51,958
Stop!

764
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:56,291
Stop!

765
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,333
(intense music)

766
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:04,666
Stop!

767
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:08,625
(Faye shrieks)

768
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:16,416
Please, please, please stop.

769
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:18,291
Go away, go away!

770
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:21,708
Stop, stop.

771
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,416
Stop, stop.

772
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:29,833
(Faye sobs)

773
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,875
Oh God, God, God, God.

774
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:36,083
Please, please, please stop.

775
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:38,750
(Faye yells)

776
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:40,708
Please!

777
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:45,208
Go away, go away, go away!

778
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:48,416
(dramatic music)

779
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:01,625
When I was younger, I mean like,

780
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,791
when I was really young,

781
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:06,000
I used to beg my parents to put a lock

782
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:09,500
on the outside of my bedroom door

783
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:14,166
because I was terrified
that I would sleepwalk

784
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:15,833
in the middle of the night,

785
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:19,166
and because I knew where all
the knives were in the home,

786
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:21,416
that maybe I would get them

787
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:24,333
and then I would murder my whole family.

788
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:29,540
It sounds weird when I say it out loud,

789
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:33,791
but I was terrified as a
little kid, I was so scared.

790
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:37,625
I was scared that maybe
subconsciously I was evil,

791
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,375
or there was something wrong with me,

792
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:43,416
or maybe I had impulses that
I didn't even know that I had,

793
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:44,833
and if I were sleeping,

794
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,559
I wouldn't be able to
control those impulses,

795
00:55:46,583 --> 00:55:47,708
and I just...

796
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:51,875
Oh my God, I just remember
being so terrified

797
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:54,333
that maybe in the middle of
the night I could do that,

798
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:56,833
and I didn't want to.

799
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:58,892
Obviously it wasn't something
that I wanted to do,

800
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:01,583
I was just really scared of myself.

801
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,916
I think I'm still really scared.

802
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,708
(Faye sobs)

803
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:23,791
Please.

804
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:37,041
(tense music)

805
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,375
(Faye gasps)

806
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,166
(Faye vomits)

807
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:00,083
God, if you're listening...

808
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:07,166
I need a miracle.

809
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:11,291
I'm sorry.

810
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:16,458
I'm so sorry, Jake.

811
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:18,541
I'm so sorry, baby.

812
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:23,666
Give me one more chance, and I swear,

813
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,625
I swear I won't fuck it up.

814
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:30,208
I'll do anything, I will.

815
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:35,208
Can we just start over?

816
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,750
Can we please...

817
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,500
Just start over.

818
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:52,166
(tense music)

819
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:18,291
No, no.

820
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:28,375
Why?

821
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,583
Ah.

822
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:50,958
(Faye groans)

823
00:58:56,166 --> 00:59:00,916
You want to know what
absolutely blows my mind?

824
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:05,625
Like sometimes I spend so
much time thinking about this.

825
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:09,750
Time doesn't exist.

826
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:16,583
It doesn't exist, it doesn't
exist in this linear way

827
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:17,750
that we experience it.

828
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:21,750
Like, everything is happening now.

829
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,750
Everything, every version of
myself that has ever existed

830
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:28,125
is happening right now.

831
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:34,000
But then that makes me really sad,

832
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:38,916
because then I wonder, well
then, do I always have Jacob?

833
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:47,041
Or have I never had him?

834
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:52,083
I don't know if that makes sense.

835
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:10,625
(eerie music)

836
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:31,458
Okay.

837
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:35,625
(eerie music)

838
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:41,833
That morning...

839
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:48,125
He turned off my alarm clock.

840
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:56,125
He knew that I couldn't sleep
in, I could never sleep in.

841
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,958
That wasn't an option for me.

842
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:04,083
My day was planned down to the minute,

843
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,083
but he turned off my alarm
and he let me sleep in

844
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:09,250
because he knew that I needed it.

845
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:17,375
And I was so mad at him.

846
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:23,166
I was so mad at him, I was so mad!

847
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:27,833
Why?

848
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,250
I was always so tired.

849
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:35,291
Remember?

850
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:38,833
You do.

851
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:41,625
I mean, if I would've known that

852
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,958
was his last morning, maybe...

853
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:49,125
I don't know, maybe I would've nicer?

854
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,291
But I'm not nice.

855
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,375
I'm not nice.

856
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:11,500
(Faye sighs)

857
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,291
I don't have any friends.

858
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,041
I used to.

859
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:27,125
Jacob married me when I had
no money, but I had friends.

860
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,541
He married me before I was anyone.

861
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:36,958
And we would laugh.

862
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:42,125
Ugh, we would laugh about everything.

863
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:50,583
Like, if he was gonna die,
he should've died laughing.

864
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:56,166
But I took that away from him.

865
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:03,875
Was this the last thing
he saw before he died?

866
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:13,208
At least my outside matched my inside.

867
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:17,875
(tense music)

868
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:43,333
That's gonna leave a scar.

869
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:47,125
(ominous music)

870
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:54,625
(knocking)

871
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:55,666
[Mom] Faye?

872
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,416
Mom, please, no, please.

873
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:01,125
Don't come in, I'm fine, I'm fine.

874
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:03,125
Mom.

875
01:05:07,916 --> 01:05:08,750
[Mom] Faye, it's okay.

876
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:11,708
Mom, please just go.

877
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:12,666
I'm fine.

878
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:13,791
[Mom] Unlock the door.

879
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:20,541
(Faye groans)

880
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:28,000
Baby, unlock the door, let me h.

881
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:32,625
(Faye groans)

882
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:36,666
(ominous music)

883
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:12,541
I was supposed to have a baby.

884
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,458
We were gonna have a baby.

885
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:26,375
I didn't want it...

886
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:30,958
until I did.

887
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:34,416
But then it was too late.

888
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,958
(Faye sobs)

889
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:38,166
I just...

890
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,125
Be careful what you wish for, Faye.

891
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,208
(ominous music)

892
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:01,000
[Emory] Faye, it's Em.

893
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:01,958
This isn't funny.

894
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,083
Where are my chapters?

895
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:08,250
(phone buzzes)

896
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:09,416
Faye, it's Em.

897
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:11,957
Why aren't you answering, where are you?

898
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:14,083
Call me back as soon as
you get this message.

899
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,833
[Faye] I know what I have to.

900
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:24,166
Stop!

901
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,666
(Faye chuckles)

902
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,559
[Jacob] You've just
finished your first book,

903
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:28,416
how do you feel?

904
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:31,416
[Faye] Uh, you really want to?

905
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:34,208
[Jacob] I know how I feel,
I've never been more proud.

906
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:36,750
[Faye] Aw, babe,
you're gonna make me cry.

907
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:37,958
[Jacob] What now?

908
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:39,083
What's the dream?

909
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,208
What does Faye L. Ryan want now

910
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:44,500
she's about to unleash
her words into the world.

911
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:45,291
(Faye chuckles)

912
01:07:45,416 --> 01:07:47,916
[Faye] You're so dumb.

913
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:49,125
Honestly?

914
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,291
[Jacob] Tell me.

915
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:51,851
[Faye] I don't know what happens next,

916
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:56,666
but what I want is to
just make a difference.

917
01:07:58,125 --> 01:08:01,625
If this book helps one person,
seriously, just one person,

918
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,375
then I'll know I've done
something worthwhile.

919
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,684
[Jacob] You heard it here
first, ladies and gentlemen.

920
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,333
[Faye] Stop!

921
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:09,250
[Jacob] I love you.

922
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:10,958
[Faye] Love you.

923
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:12,208
[Jacob] Hey, babe.

924
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:13,750
I know you're having a hard day,

925
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:16,625
so I'm picking up Indian
food, and I'm at Martin's now.

926
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,625
I can't remember which one
it is that you like better.

927
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,125
Is it the Prisoner or the Pessimist?

928
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,125
These are terrible names.

929
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,208
'Cause a pessimist is never disappointed.

930
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:31,833
That's actually good marketing.

931
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:37,875
Hey, babe.

932
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,500
I know you're having a hard day,

933
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:42,083
so I'm picking up Indian
food and I'm at Martin's now.

934
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:45,291
I can't remember which one
it is that you like better.

935
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:47,625
Is it the Prisoner or the-

936
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:53,208
- Hi everyone, this is a public
apology for lying to you.

937
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:00,500
I used to mean everything I said,

938
01:09:01,291 --> 01:09:04,250
but somewhere along the
way I started to say

939
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,166
what people wanted to hear.

940
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:12,416
The version of me you see is...

941
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:18,416
Strong, put together, kind,

942
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:22,750
compassionate, a teacher, a healer.

943
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:24,791
All that.

944
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,500
And I was that.

945
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,416
I was.

946
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,125
When my book started getting popular,

947
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:37,375
people would tell me that I
had turned their lives around,

948
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,416
and I started feeling
responsible for a lot.

949
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:45,708
A lot of hearts.

950
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:49,041
And I felt like I couldn't make a mistake.

951
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,791
And there were so many people

952
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:54,375
telling me what to do all the time

953
01:09:55,375 --> 01:10:00,583
that I forgot the sound of my own voice.

954
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:01,750
I was miserable.

955
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:10,208
And I took my misery out on
the people closest to me.

956
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:14,458
I pushed all of my real friends.

957
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:18,708
I pushed my husband away.

958
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:22,833
I was fighting with him

959
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:29,000
when I ran a red light

960
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:34,083
that caused the accident that killed him.

961
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:47,333
The truth is...

962
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:53,375
I'm a failure.

963
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,083
I'm supposed to be writing a book

964
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,583
about healing right now and...

965
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:09,875
I've come to realize that you
can only heal if you want to.

966
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:19,500
I don't want to, because
I don't deserve it.

967
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:26,833
I'm sorry I let you down.

968
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:52,666
Oh, Char.

969
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:58,500
(ominous music)

970
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:27,708
Are you ever aware of when
you're taking something too far?

971
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:29,708
You know, like with anything.

972
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:31,809
It could be you're having
an argument with somebody

973
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:35,208
and you know that if you
just say that one thing,

974
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:37,083
that one thing...

975
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:41,458
That you could lose them forever.

976
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:45,541
(ominous music)

977
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:44,208
Or if you just have one more
pill, just one more pill

978
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:47,000
or one more drink, you might not wake up.

979
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:51,541
(tense music)

980
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:09,625
I would never write this in
a book because quite frankly,

981
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:12,208
I wouldn't have a career if I did.

982
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:17,250
But I fucking live for those moments.

983
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:20,791
(tense music)

984
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:56,583
(eerie music)

985
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:18,000
(Faye coughs)

986
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,041
(Faye gasps)

987
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:13,000
This is another excerpt from the book.

988
01:17:13,125 --> 01:17:16,458
"I have scars all over my body.

989
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:20,166
My healed wounds, my reminders.

990
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:22,375
I can't help but think
about that scene in Jaws

991
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,916
where Hooper, Quint, and Brody
sit around comparing scars.

992
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:30,708
This was a shark, this was a fight.

993
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:32,958
This one, she broke my heart.

994
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,208
And they laughed.

995
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:39,750
They laughed over old wounds together,

996
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:43,500
while the monster still lurks
in the depths of the ocean

997
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,125
right beneath their boat."

998
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,875
(phone rings)

999
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:55,291
[Mom] Hey.

1000
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:56,416
Hey, Mom.

1001
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:57,642
[Mom] Are you still in Louisiana?

1002
01:17:57,666 --> 01:17:59,875
I'm sorry I haven't gotten back.

1003
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,708
I'm actually just about to leave.

1004
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:03,708
[Mom] You finished up?

1005
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:04,541
Mhm.

1006
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:05,416
[Mom] Really?

1007
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:06,625
That's great.

1008
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,110
Why don't you stop by on your way?

1009
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:10,291
Yeah, that's actually...

1010
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:13,583
That's actually why I'm calling.

1011
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:18,750
I was wondering if maybe
I could come stay with you

1012
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:21,958
for a little while.

1013
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:24,083
[Mom] I would love that.

1014
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:26,416
Nothing would make me happier.

1015
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:28,958
Yeah.

1016
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:34,500
It's just, I could really use the company.

1017
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,083
[Mom] Come home, sweetheart.

1018
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:40,916
I'll get your room ready.

1019
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:42,750
Mhm.

1020
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:44,625
Thank you.

1021
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:45,750
[Mom] Okay.

1022
01:18:45,791 --> 01:18:46,666
I love you.

1023
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:47,958
Love you.

1024
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,458
[Mom] Bye, babe.

1025
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:50,583
Bye.

1026
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:58,041
"Life isn't easy,

1027
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,291
and we're just bobbing
in the ebb and flow.

1028
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:05,250
The cycle never ends,
but it's all important.

1029
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:06,500
It all belongs.

1030
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:12,541
The wins, the losses,
the fear, the laughter,

1031
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:15,666
the pain, the heartbreak.

1032
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:19,458
I've spent the last 6 months
talking to my dead husband,

1033
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:23,833
pretending he was still
alive, like nothing happened.

1034
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:27,125
But something did happen.

1035
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:29,958
A tragedy happened.

1036
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:37,291
The kind of story I've read
too many times to count,

1037
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:40,083
but not one I could accept as my own.

1038
01:19:40,916 --> 01:19:42,041
I didn't want to heal,

1039
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:45,291
because healing would mean
that I had to acknowledge

1040
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:46,416
that I was broken.

1041
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:48,541
And when something heals,

1042
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:51,000
it doesn't mean it goes
back to its original state.

1043
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:53,916
Jacob is never coming back.

1044
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,791
My life will never be the same.

1045
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,916
Grief is terrifying.

1046
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:09,250
And it's never been
defeated by a one man army.

1047
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,500
But, what if it's not
supposed to be a fight?"

1048
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:25,583
That's it.

1049
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:28,916
Are we...

1050
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:30,250
Are we done?

1051
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:34,541
Okay, thank you.

1052
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:46,541
(catchy music)
