00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,470
Since its debut,
True TV has brought you...

2
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:03,626
the finest in documentary
and informational programming.

3
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:06,103
You've counted on us,
and we've taken you there.

4
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:08,788
From the edge of the world
to the edge of your seat,

5
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:11,587
from the streets of L.A.
to the Serengeti Plain,

6
00:01:11,674 --> 00:01:14,029
from inner peace to outer space,

7
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:17,026
your funniest moments
and most tragic times.

8
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:20,550
You've laughed, you've cried,
you've almost died.

9
00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:23,194
But now we'll take you
where you've never been before.

10
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:26,903
No script, no actors, no editing.

11
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:29,428
All day, all night, all true.

12
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:32,586
Every second is true on True TV...

13
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:34,824
this spring.

14
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:39,902
So, any questions ?

15
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,626
Yes ?

16
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:45,512
l think we get that it's true,
but what is it ?

17
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:48,062
Cynthia, why don't you come up here ?
This is your moment.

18
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:51,351
Folks, this is Cynthia Topping.
She's the program director at True TV.

19
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:55,586
She's the one that's gonna be strapped
to a Scud missile if this doesn't work.

20
00:01:55,674 --> 00:02:00,873
Thank you, Mr. Whitaker.
l've always wanted to travel.

21
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:05,709
- Yes ?
- lsn't this show similar to
a show P.B.S. had in the '70s ?

22
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:09,070
- The Loud Family ?
- No, no, this is completely different.

23
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:11,952
We are gonna--
We're gonna pick one person,

24
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:15,390
one, one normal person,

25
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:17,624
not like you folks.

26
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:23,186
And we're gonna put that person's life
on television all day long, live.

27
00:02:23,274 --> 00:02:25,549
lt's not P.B.S.,
it's not Real World.

28
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:27,829
We're not gonna film it
and then edit it later.

29
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,633
ls that how l sound ?
l don't sound like that, do l ?

30
00:02:30,714 --> 00:02:32,591
- More or less.
- On a good day.

31
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:34,426
You never said anything ?

32
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:37,711
- l don't mean to be negative here.
- Ooh !

33
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:39,989
Hey !

34
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:44,272
l know this was your idea, but doesn't
this have a great chance of being--

35
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:46,584
A big, smelly bomb ?
Oh, you betcha ! Yeah.

36
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:50,349
And wouldn't that be,
you know, a bad thing ?

37
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:53,904
Keith, we're getting our butts kicked
by the Gardening Channel.

38
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:55,825
People would rather watch soil.

39
00:02:55,914 --> 00:03:00,669
We are this close to having
chalk outlines around our careers.

40
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:03,473
l love that we're doing this,
and l love that it's risky.

41
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:06,352
All anyone every does
in this business is follow the pack.

42
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:10,871
Hell, if people tune into this twice
a day for five minutes, we're a hit.

43
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:13,149
You know what finally
convinced me that this could work ?

44
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,270
Half a dozen wine coolers ?

45
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:18,073
When l realized that
the person we pick,

46
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:21,430
the guy that's on TV
all day long, doesn't have to be good.

47
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:25,587
- lf he's good, great,
but if he's bad, even better.
- Bad is better ?

48
00:03:25,674 --> 00:03:29,349
People can't turn away from an accident.
You drive by and say,

49
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:32,107
"Ooh, l hope there's not
a head in the road. That would be--"

50
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:34,389
But then you look.
You don't wanna miss it.

51
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:37,352
So we put a guy on TV,
and we sit and wait and see...

52
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,232
if that head starts rollin'
down the highway.

53
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:42,270
Now that's fun
for the whole family.

54
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:47,951
- So, what's our next step ?
- We find ourselves
a big, fat rolling head.

55
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:52,472
Are you seeing this ?
Are you looking around you ?

56
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:55,546
God, you know what this is ?

57
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:58,910
This is a horror show.

58
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:01,269
- What are you going off
about now, John Boy ?
- This doesn't bug you ?

59
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:04,027
All our friends and
everybody getting married,

60
00:04:04,114 --> 00:04:06,309
and are having kids
and their careers.

61
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:10,069
- Their kids are having careers.
lt's a mess.
- Why would that bug me ?

62
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:12,873
Look at us, right ?
We are doin' fine.

63
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:16,913
Oh. Okay.
You have a beer around your neck.

64
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:19,633
- Okay ?
- That's my point !

65
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,670
- Your brother's here.
- Hey, go long, man.

66
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:25,624
l'm gonna go say hi to Kim.

67
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:30,071
Yeah. Listen, that was great
tonight. l loved it. Oh, man !

68
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:32,031
- lnsane, Ray.
- What's goin' on ?

69
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:34,105
l'm tellin' ya, it's weird.

70
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:38,233
We meet, we go out and bing-bang-boom,
she's got me meetin' her parents.

71
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:40,384
What do you mean,
bing-bang-boom, buddy ?

72
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:43,352
You've been goin' out with her
for six months.

73
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,231
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:45,314 --> 00:04:48,067
l suddenly feel like
the walls are closing in on me.

75
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:53,069
You know ? The father is sittin' there
askin' me about my career prospects.

76
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,985
- What was l saying ?
- Can you believe that ?

77
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:57,349
Oh, at dinner,

78
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:00,028
the dog is sniffing my balls.

79
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:02,309
At least l hope it was the dog,

80
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:05,352
because her mother
disappeared for a while.

81
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:12,464
- What's goin' on over there ?
- They're doin' audition tapes
for that True TV thing.

82
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:14,863
People are sendin' 'em in
from all over the place.

83
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:18,185
- Oh, yeah ? That's cool !
- What's cool ?

84
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:21,744
- To be that guy,
that guy they watch all day.
- Get outta here.

85
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:25,383
Mark my words.
That guy is gonna be famous.

86
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:28,864
He'll be able to get
whatever he wants, whoever he wants.

87
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,945
Hey, trust me.
This is my business.

88
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:33,594
- What is ?
- Show business.

89
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:37,064
- You in show business now ?
- Yeah, l service video equipment.

90
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:42,672
That's like saying
those people stitchin' Nikes
in Panama are in the N.B.A.

91
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:45,268
Hello ?

92
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:47,106
- Bed-wetter.
- Thumb-sucker.

93
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:51,028
- You know what ?
l'm gonna go make a tape.
- You know what ?

94
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:53,502
l'm excited.

95
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:56,472
l know that l can do this.

96
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:58,385
lt's my turn.
l'm next, l'm next.

97
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:02,262
- Buzz, can l get one more ?
- You got it.

98
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:04,663
Hello there.

99
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:06,824
So Ray met the family, huh ?

100
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:09,269
Oh, yeah.

101
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,345
l heard the dog really liked him.

102
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:14,551
Yeah. The whole family loved him.

103
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:18,229
But of course, my whole family really
loved the last guy l went out with,

104
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:20,782
and he strung me along
for a year and then dumped me.

105
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,865
- Yeah ?
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:06:25,354 --> 00:06:30,223
And, you know, every guy
l ever broke up with,

107
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:33,306
the minute it's over,
l could tell you what went wrong.

108
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:37,307
How it went wrong.
Why it had to go wrong.

109
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,385
But when l'm in it,

110
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:41,590
lost.

111
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:44,188
l'm like a love coroner !

112
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:47,505
Bring me the corpse,
l'll tell you what killed it.

113
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:50,347
But how to prevent it ? Lost.

114
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:56,463
Hi ! l'm Ray Pekurny !

115
00:06:56,554 --> 00:07:02,186
l'm from here in San Francisco,
the greatest city in the world.

116
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:04,583
- Are you with me ?
- Yeah !

117
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,825
Go, Niners !

118
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:09,506
How are things goin' ?

119
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:12,586
Okay, l want to introduce you
to my girlfriend.

120
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:16,189
She's really cute, she's really cool,

121
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:19,186
and she's... really strong.

122
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:22,391
She's a U.P.S. person.
She lifts packages. Not beefy.

123
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:26,990
She told me this joke. What do you get
when you cross U.P.S. with Fed Ex ?

124
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:30,350
Fed up ! lt's her joke.

125
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:33,506
Oh, my brother, my brother.
Ed, yeah, come on.

126
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:39,584
- Say somethin', Ed.
- Asshole !

127
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:43,189
- Come on, man. Say somethin'.
- All right.

128
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:46,903
l don't know about this whole 24-hour
TV thing y'all got goin',

129
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:50,828
- but if you are gonna go forward
with it, this is your man.
- Smart guy.

130
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:53,109
The Ray-man here.
This guy's got stories.

131
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:55,947
- This guy has lived.
- l've got stories. l've lived !

132
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:58,594
- Tell 'em about that dog grooming
business you started.
- No, not that story.

133
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:02,064
- You gotta tell 'em about that.
- No, l don't really wanna--

134
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:03,985
l'm telling. Here we go.

135
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:06,144
- This guy ?
- Yeah, take a look at this kid.

136
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:08,350
He was gonna start up a mobile
dog groomin' business.

137
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:11,471
- He's cute. Yes !
- Really ?

138
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:13,704
- He doesn't wanna be
like everybody else.
- No.

139
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,673
He doesn't start it in a van or a pickup
truck or something like that.

140
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:22,874
- The Ray-man, he starts it in a Camry !
- Camry !

141
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:26,663
- Camry ! Two door.
- Camry.

142
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:28,585
So he gets a tub,
and he puts it in the trunk.

143
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,063
He throws the dogs in the tub, slams
the trunk and starts drivin' around.

144
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:35,830
Speeds up, stops real quick,
turns left, turns right
to get the dogs all sudded up.

145
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:40,385
Pretty smart, right ? Now, guess
how he dries 'em off. Guess.

146
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:41,907
With the exhaust !

147
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:47,109
What do you say ? We bring him in,
can't hurt. Just talk to him ?

148
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:51,346
Well, l'm from east Texas. Yep.

149
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:54,073
And when l was like 13,

150
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:58,591
my mom got remarried to my stepfather
who was a traveling salesman.

151
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:03,111
He got transferred up here to
San Francisco, so we all came along.

152
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:07,233
- Here we are, here l am.
- Mm-hmm. Terrific.

153
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:10,192
- Did you go to college or--
- l had a year of junior college.

154
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:13,346
Home of the Bear Cats.

155
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:17,063
Oh, scary. What did you study ?

156
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:22,353
Studyin' ? Geez, that'd have been
a big help. Where were you then ?

157
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,584
That's cute.

158
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:27,746
- Straight ahead.
- What ? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,509
And as you see, l can get rid
of the Texas accent whenever l want.

160
00:09:31,594 --> 00:09:34,950
Or l can just slide...

161
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:38,265
real deep on into it like this.

162
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:41,266
How do you decide ?

163
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:45,632
To tell you the truth,
l find this accent here...

164
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:48,353
don't do me no harm
with the ladies.

165
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:53,034
Know what l mean, darlin' ?

166
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:57,904
Yeah.

167
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:00,303
No, never been married.

168
00:10:00,394 --> 00:10:01,986
Um,

169
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:05,304
l've been burned
a couple times, though.

170
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:08,192
My father ?

171
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:14,544
Um, well, let's see. When l was 12,
my mom got a hysterectomy.

172
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:18,024
He ran off with her nurse,
and l haven't seen him since.

173
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:22,710
That's my dad, Hank Pekurny.

174
00:10:22,794 --> 00:10:24,750
Next question ?

175
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:28,873
Like one time l was playin'
pee-wee football back in Texas, right ?

176
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:30,785
And l dislocated my finger.

177
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:32,785
My mom comes rollin' out of
the bleachers now...

178
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:34,751
and busts through this little
group of kids, grabs my finger.

179
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,870
Whack !
Pops it back into place.

180
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:41,106
Runs up, slaps the coach upside the head
and says, "Let's get the game on !"

181
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:43,230
That's Mom.

182
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:48,463
Well, l still can't really
bend this finger, though.

183
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:50,385
Well.

184
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:53,266
Oh.

185
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:56,505
Uh, a dream ?
Oh, yeah, man, l got a dream.

186
00:10:56,594 --> 00:11:00,382
l, uh, just don't know
what it is yet, you know ?

187
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:21,988
Did you test him ?
Did you do any research ?

188
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:23,905
Research ?

189
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:26,383
We don't even have money in
our budget for coffee filters.

190
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:28,351
We're using a yarmulke.

191
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:31,391
But this is who you want ?

192
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:37,029
l'm going based on something you once
said at a broadcaster's dinner.

193
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,105
l love it. l love it !

194
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:41,025
You see what she does ?

195
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:44,902
See what she does ?
She attaches me to her choice.

196
00:11:44,994 --> 00:11:46,950
Thereby fueling my massive ego...

197
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:48,865
and forcing me to like it.

198
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:51,627
You're great !
How come you never doodle my name ?

199
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:54,228
- l-l do.
- l'm joking.

200
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,145
l'm joking.

201
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:58,384
Once again.

202
00:11:58,474 --> 00:12:00,829
This is the guy
you want to go with ?

203
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:07,751
Yes.

204
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:14,103
What happens when you go to
the bathroom ? Do they go in with ya ?

205
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:16,947
No, Al !
l mean, the bathroom's out of bounds.

206
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:18,706
Dinner's gettin' cold !

207
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:21,627
My life is not so great
that l want it shown on television.

208
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:23,545
And neither is yours, Ed.

209
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:27,343
- That's the whole point.
This could change all that.
- How ?

210
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:32,269
- Huh. Ha. l'm glad you asked.
l want to open a gym.
- A gymnasium ?

211
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:36,632
No. A gymnasium is an old, white guy
shootin' free throws like this.

212
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,670
l'm talkin' a modern-day
fitness center.

213
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:40,392
What does this have
to do with Ed ?

214
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:43,864
lf Ed is on TV for a month,
he gets a balloon payment.

215
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:45,512
That's big money.

216
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:48,791
l'd borrow against that right now
at the bank, l'd buy the gym,

217
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:50,785
l make Ed a silent partner,

218
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:54,310
and l cut all you in for a slice
because you signed the releases.

219
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:57,909
- This is gonna cost us.
- lt's not gonna-- Hey, look.

220
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:01,066
Open your eyes instead of your mouth
for once. This is a no-brainer.

221
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:05,386
The whole time l'm gonna
be promoting the gym on TV.

222
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:07,305
lt's free advertising.

223
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:09,908
l mean--
Does anyone else see this ?

224
00:13:09,994 --> 00:13:12,383
How 'bout sex ?

225
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:16,947
Sorry, Al, but
l'm gonna have to pass.

226
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:19,867
And it's not an age thing,
'cause you are still a handsome man.

227
00:13:19,954 --> 00:13:23,549
No ! Do they show you having sex ?

228
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:27,343
No, Al.
Look, kissin' and huggin'.

229
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:29,504
- Nudity ?
- Ed, you're not gonna be nude.

230
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:33,428
- Why would l be nude, Ma ?
- What kind of a show is this ?
lt's a filthy show !

231
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:36,631
-lt is not a filthy show.
-Have you even read the whole contract ?

232
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:39,786
- Do you even know what's in it ?
- Miss Cautious all of a sudden.

233
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:42,263
She meets a guy in a bar,
she's married an hour later.

234
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:46,632
- We didn't get married, we
just thought we were married.
- Marcia, calm down, honey.

235
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:49,592
He's pickin' on me, and he's
bringin' up all kinds of issues.

236
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:53,667
- Married is married is married.
- Maybe this isn't a good idea.

237
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:55,506
What isn't ?

238
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:59,587
The whole thing. Maybe l'll just
get out now before it gets complicated.

239
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:03,872
- No harm, no foul.
- Great. They had to pick you.
They couldn't pick me.

240
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:05,945
lf he doesn't want to do it--

241
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:10,744
lf he doesn't want to do it ? He's 31
years old, he's a video store clerk !

242
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,904
What is his grand master plan here ?

243
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:15,269
What, is he gonna spend
the rest of his life...

244
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,231
rearranging Ernest movies ?

245
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,272
Everyone who works there
is 12 years old.

246
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:23,664
They go through college, they graduate,
and then they stop working there.

247
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:27,542
Except for him ! He stays to welcome
the next batch of 12-year-olds.

248
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,909
lt's a job for retards !

249
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,064
Ray, stop that !

250
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:34,588
- Was l being insultin' ?
- Uh-huh.

251
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,711
- Tch !
- Yeah, kinda.

252
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,672
- As usual.
- A fella can't--

253
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,746
All right, look, look. Hey.

254
00:14:45,314 --> 00:14:47,953
- You don't have to be scared.
- l'm not scared.

255
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:51,947
- Don't be scared. You're scared, man.
- l'm not scared.

256
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:56,312
- l am not scared, Ray.
- l know you got that
doe-in-the-headlights look.

257
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:59,431
You're mixing your proteins
and starches, and you can't--

258
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:03,826
l'll tell you what. You don't
have to worry about anything.
You know why ? Huh ?

259
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:07,702
- No, why ?
- Because big brother's riding shotgun.

260
00:15:07,794 --> 00:15:10,308
l've got your back.

261
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:13,750
Did anything ever happen to you when you
were a kid ? Anyone ever bother you ?

262
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:17,383
- Just you.
- Just-- Just me.

263
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:19,829
You bring those cameras over
to big brother, and l promise you...

264
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:22,747
l will make something happen
for both of us, for all of us !

265
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:36,750
You know, how many chances
do guys like you and l get ?

266
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:40,834
- l don't know.
- Yeah, that's right, you don't know.

267
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:54,592
Guys, when am l gonna get my on-air
feed ? All l'm gettin' are color bars.

268
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:58,303
Mike, loosen up a little bit.
Stand by to lose laser. Yeah, good.

269
00:15:58,394 --> 00:16:00,225
T.O.C., we're ready to feed.

270
00:16:00,314 --> 00:16:02,748
Carlos, show me where
you're gonna be when we go live.

271
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:07,225
There you go, right there. Go back up
a little bit. Okay, right there.

272
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:21,789
Guys, we're gonna go in ten, nine--

273
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,705
- Hold on, l'm coming.
- Has it started ?

274
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:26,149
- Good morning.
- Sorry.

275
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:30,512
Four, three, two,

276
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:32,664
and ready one, take one.

277
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:34,346
Shh.

278
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,868
There he is !

279
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:40,829
Not the best angle.

280
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:53,990
This is exciting.

281
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:56,713
Oh, my God,
is that what l think it is ?

282
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:59,308
- l think so.
- A little morning chubby.

283
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,624
Damn.

284
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:09,948
Oh, no.

285
00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:21,545
Oh, honey.

286
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:24,990
- Don't do that.
- Pull it out, pull it out.

287
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:31,028
Well, that's embarrassing.

288
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:32,991
Morning.

289
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:41,705
- Microphone.
- Mm. Microphone.

290
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,623
Turn on the TV.

291
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:53,223
Morning.

292
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:55,145
l'm Ed.

293
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:57,065
There's that smile !

294
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:13,786
- Ow, ow, ow ! Hot !
- Whoa, an action sequence.

295
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,705
l kind of pieced this stereo
together, a homemade job.

296
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:21,548
This is my wall of chrome.

297
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,751
l've been collecting those
since, like, 1973.

298
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:34,985
Oh, wow.

299
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:40,947
- What'd l miss ?
- He's checking out his own ass.

300
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:43,867
You gotta see this.
Oh, my--

301
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:47,071
Oh, my God !

302
00:18:47,154 --> 00:18:49,349
Ohh !

303
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,946
Yeah

304
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:06,312
Hey !

305
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,784
All right

306
00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:16,867
Come on, man, hop in.

307
00:19:16,954 --> 00:19:19,388
Let's go !

308
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:23,945
l need a little time
to believe what's true

309
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:26,628
l don't know what's going on

310
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:29,630
Some days l'm stayin'

311
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:31,864
Some days l'm like a rollin' stone

312
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:34,388
The mast is down.

313
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,863
Let's go, Sam, let's go !

314
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,503
l can't take it

315
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:49,065
l'm thinkin' back so many faces

316
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,430
- My heart, my love--
- Hey, Ed ! Ed, up here !

317
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:55,586
Guys, film me. Yeah, hi !
Ed, up here !

318
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:58,029
Yeah !

319
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,991
Hey ! Hey !

320
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,986
Act like everything is normal.

321
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:04,712
Go, go !

322
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:14,110
What's up, Ed ?

323
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:20,227
- Guys.
- Welcome to work, Ed.

324
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:25,788
lt's good to be at work... Lou.

325
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:27,990
l've got just what you need, boys.

326
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:32,670
The best tape in the whole damn store.
Smokey and the Bandit. Huh ?

327
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:35,143
- Who's in that ?
- Who ?

328
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,670
Burton Leon Reynolds, Jr.,
is in that, boys.

329
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:41,746
- Who ?
- Burton Leon Reynolds, Jr.

330
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,506
Get out.

331
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:45,869
You can't have this tape.
G-Go home !

332
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,309
Get your raggedy little
Steven Segal-lovin' asses outta here.

333
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:50,783
"Who is this ?"
lt's Burt Reynolds !

334
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:58,023
Burt. Burt rules.

335
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:00,150
Alice, why are we watching this ?

336
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:02,111
No reason,
l just wanna see what happens.

337
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:06,551
Let me spare you the suspense. Nothing's
gonna happen. Trust me on this.

338
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:11,025
Which one of these albums
would you recommend ?

339
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:13,947
l gotta go with that. Yeah.

340
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,309
That's a good choice.
That's their first album.

341
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:19,352
- l think he's cute.
- Can't go wrong with the first album.

342
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:22,824
lt's like before they learned how to.

343
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,984
No, no, no.

344
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:28,066
You look at your husband, okay ?
l'm gonna make you say
my name tonight, woman.

345
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,714
Most people like to hurry
through a toenail clippin' session.

346
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:33,870
Just clip and git.

347
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:35,910
Not me.

348
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:39,225
l like to take my time.

349
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:43,193
l'm meticulous, you know ?

350
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:45,151
l like to do it.

351
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:47,065
Yeah.

352
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:50,032
lf this guy collects
his toe cheese, l'm outta here.

353
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:53,709
Some guys start here, then down
to the little toe. That ain't me.

354
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:57,912
l save the big one...

355
00:21:57,994 --> 00:21:59,985
for last.

356
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:04,272
'Cause it's bigger. You gotta do
some work, you gotta be an artiste.

357
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:07,270
Look at that.

358
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:10,590
Oh !

359
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:13,950
No. No, l haven't seen
the spot ratings.

360
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:17,504
You know how you're watching the big
game and you gotta do your business ?

361
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:19,505
Right ?
The worst time to do it.

362
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:24,668
Yeah. That's a number that, hopefully,
we can obvi-- we'll build from.

363
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:28,827
l don't have to anymore.
Check that out. l designed this.

364
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:33,590
No, l disagree. l don't think
it's time to pull the plug.

365
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:36,313
Yes, Mr. Whitaker,
l know they shoot horses.

366
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:38,828
What do you see ?
What is that ?

367
00:22:38,914 --> 00:22:41,792
That is the TV.
And where am l ?

368
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:45,469
l am on the can.
At the same time l am on the can,

369
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:47,385
but yet l am still a fan.

370
00:22:47,474 --> 00:22:49,749
You know, it's been one day.

371
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:54,350
Can you give me a week with this guy,
and then you fly up my nose ? Hello ?

372
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:58,950
Somebody smart said,
"Practicality wins out."

373
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:02,947
So, in this bathroom
l'm a... winner.

374
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:06,225
Yeah.

375
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:08,789
Five.

376
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:12,947
Six. Seven.

377
00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:16,390
Eight. Nine !

378
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:19,432
Come on, Ray, she's not that heavy.

379
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:24,230
Yeah, yeah !

380
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:27,424
You shifted your weight.

381
00:23:27,514 --> 00:23:30,074
l'm not hurt, l'm not hurt.
l'm okay.

382
00:23:30,154 --> 00:23:33,430
Ray's Gym !
Now accepting applications !

383
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:37,223
- We want your body ! Ray's !
- Look what he did for me. Huh ? Huh ?

384
00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:39,953
All right ! Oh, God !

385
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:42,070
Hey, John Boy !

386
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,544
What do you like about it ?
l don't understand.

387
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:50,344
l don't know. lt's just that--
Well-- Just let me watch.

388
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:52,664
You're gonna love this.
This is a great story.

389
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:56,747
l got a great story. You remember
Marcia ? Of course, she's our sister.

390
00:23:56,834 --> 00:24:00,463
She's goin' out with this new guy.

391
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:03,990
- They're livin' together.
- You want to save this till later ?

392
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:06,110
No, no, now's the perfect time.

393
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:10,312
He's a singer in a piano bar.
Sings, plays the piano.
And that's how they met.

394
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:13,704
- He sang to her and they fell in love.
- Not even, Buzz.

395
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:18,151
No. Get this. Some drunk hit him
in the head with a snifter.

396
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:20,304
One of those things
you keep on the bar for tips ?

397
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:22,430
You don't know, Buzz,
'cause you never get tips.

398
00:24:22,514 --> 00:24:25,472
He hit him over the head 'cause he's
terrible, he's wretched, he's awful.

399
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:28,546
He's dreadful, he sucks,
l'm tellin' ya, right ?

400
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,547
That's what happened. She's pullin'
a chunk of glass out of his skull,

401
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:35,512
and he bleeds on her,
and that's all she needs !

402
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:37,630
Bing ! lt's amore, right ?

403
00:24:37,714 --> 00:24:40,353
The question l'm askin' is:

404
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:44,791
What's she doin' in a bar ?
She's an alcoholic for Christ's sakes !

405
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:48,025
No, Ray, buddy, not here.

406
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:51,106
l gotta pee, l gotta pee.

407
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:56,348
Hey, what, are you hidin'
from the police or somethin' ?

408
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:59,904
Come on, show yourself.
Look, is she beautiful ?

409
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:02,303
She's beautiful, right ?
That's my girl.

410
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:05,830
While l'm gone, Edward, tell
'em about that time we lied to Mom...

411
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:08,109
and then went to Tijuana
to find the donkey show.

412
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:13,347
l got her, l got her.

413
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,473
- You are, though.
- What ?

414
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:22,193
Beautiful.

415
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:30,506
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Yeah, bud ?

416
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:35,668
l'm taking a poll on whether or not
l should shave my head.

417
00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:38,222
l've had about 19 beers,
so take that into account.

418
00:25:38,314 --> 00:25:40,908
- Barry, did you see that ?
- What ?

419
00:25:40,994 --> 00:25:43,986
- The girl. The look.
- Yeah.

420
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:47,350
She likes the Ed guy better
than she likes the brother.

421
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:49,868
l don't think l like it.
l don't think it's nice.

422
00:25:49,954 --> 00:25:51,945
lt's a good set of hair
you got on your head now.

423
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:55,026
l've had about enough of this.
Give me the remote.

424
00:25:55,114 --> 00:25:57,833
Just a few more minutes.
Read your book.

425
00:26:13,194 --> 00:26:16,869
l wanna tell you a story

426
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:19,866
l wanna tell you about my town

427
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,742
l wanna tell you a story about people

428
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,304
Not this morning. Uh-uh.

429
00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:34,466
Let's change topics. Does anybody
have an opinion, a viewpoint...

430
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:37,307
on something going on now
called Ed TV ?

431
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:41,387
Oh ! This is a new low point
in American culture.

432
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,113
You're being kind.
You're being way too kind.

433
00:26:59,114 --> 00:27:01,628
Brushin' my teeth.

434
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:04,831
They never bothered
to pick a guy with any talent.

435
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,870
Or even anything to say.

436
00:27:06,954 --> 00:27:10,026
They seem to celebrate
the fact that the guy's a boob.

437
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:13,231
Sort of a joyous celebration
of boobery. That's what it is.

438
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:16,192
Take it easy.

439
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:22,391
- Hey, Ed, your show stinks.
- What a loser !

440
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,068
Hey, Ed, you want my autograph ?

441
00:27:25,754 --> 00:27:27,790
Okeydokey.

442
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,065
Ten dollars ?

443
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:44,389
Listen, we had a deal,
you little eight-year-old bastard.

444
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:46,544
l'll tell you what.
Keep the dog.

445
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,709
Who is it ?

446
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:54,388
- Who is it ?
- lt's me, Ed, buddy.

447
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:57,750
Ed ? Just kiddin'. How you doin' ?

448
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:59,745
Good. You ready to watch the game ?

449
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:04,225
Actually, no. l'm a little bit sleepy.
l'm tired, exhausted--

450
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:06,669
What are you talkin' about being
sleepy ? Five minutes to tip-off.

451
00:28:06,754 --> 00:28:08,949
lt's time for Rocket ball !

452
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:11,025
Ray, where do you keep
the glasses ?

453
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:16,427
Oh, Shari's here.
Why didn't you just say so, huh ?

454
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:19,392
- Hi, Shari.
- Who's Shari ?

455
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:21,351
Who's that ?

456
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:26,345
Okay. Oh, God, oh, God.

457
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:29,107
- Want me to get that ?
- No, l got it. Ed, don't go, l--

458
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:32,231
Whoa, whoa ! Look at that !
Get in on that !

459
00:28:32,314 --> 00:28:34,191
Oh, man !

460
00:28:34,274 --> 00:28:36,947
You're being misled by
a manipulating medium called television.

461
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:41,266
- Let's get out.
- No, she's a homeless girl.
Ed, don't leave.

462
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:43,231
She was out on the street, so l--

463
00:28:43,314 --> 00:28:47,944
She didn't have any clothes
or a place to stay, and l--
Honey ? Oh, shit ! Ed ?

464
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:51,026
What do you mean homeless ?
My place is better than this dump.

465
00:28:51,114 --> 00:28:52,786
Dump ?

466
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:56,184
- What ?
- That was Shari on the phone.
She saw the whole thing on TV.

467
00:28:56,274 --> 00:29:00,108
- l gotta tell ya, she's pissed.
- No shit, Ray. Who's the girl ?

468
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:03,869
The-- Come here a second.

469
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:06,752
She's the receptionist at the place
where l buy that gym equipment.

470
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:10,543
And she's a real knockout and a redhead
to boot, which l've never had.

471
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:12,511
And she's never given me
the time of day.

472
00:29:12,594 --> 00:29:16,303
Suddenly, today she's all, "Hey,
l saw you on TV, and you were great."

473
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:20,706
And l'm all, "You know, l just made some
gingerroot gazpacho, come on over."

474
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:22,625
The next thing you know,
ba-da-bing !

475
00:29:22,714 --> 00:29:25,751
- l mean, l'm human.
- What do you mean? Why didn't you stop?

476
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:27,267
Stop ?

477
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:31,029
- Why didn't you stop ?
- l'm the guy. l don't stop !

478
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:33,912
That's the woman's job.
We're the gas, they're the brakes.

479
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:41,504
- Go talk to Shari.
Honey, let him come talk to you.
- Why ? Why me ?

480
00:29:41,594 --> 00:29:45,223
- Because you brought the cameras here.
- You brought the girl.

481
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:50,707
ls that the way it is ? You can't do me
that one little, simple favor ? Great.

482
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:52,989
Okay, l don't need
any favors from you !

483
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:55,747
Matter of fact,
P.S., go to hell !

484
00:29:58,794 --> 00:30:00,625
Friggin' out of his gourd.

485
00:30:00,714 --> 00:30:04,104
Ed, man, come on, you know
l really need this. l need this !

486
00:30:04,194 --> 00:30:06,230
lf l go over there,
you know they're coming with me.

487
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:10,227
lf l go over, she's gonna put
my balls in a blender.
You know you would, honey.

488
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:14,193
All l'm askin' is just go talk to her
and beg her. Beg her if you have--

489
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:19,632
Actually, honey, just let him

- You owe me.

492
00:30:23,754 --> 00:30:26,552
Yes, go !

493
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:30,593
l can't go on about this.
"l owe you, you owe me."

494
00:30:30,674 --> 00:30:35,384
Look, l have a guest. l'm bein' rude,
all right ? l'll talk to you.

495
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:37,192
Thanks, honey. Okay.

496
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,908
Yeah, yeah, Phil,
are you watchin' this ?

497
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:48,827
- Friggin' out of his gourd.
- You might wanna take a look.

498
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:51,553
- Jack, let's go. We're gonna be late.
- Shush.

499
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:54,671
- Don't shush me. Oh, shush.
- Shush ! Shush !

500
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:01,104
Hi !

501
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,754
Hi, l'm Rita.
l'm Shari's roommate.

502
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:05,665
Hey, Rita, l'm Ed.

503
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:09,144
- Shari knew you were
coming over because she saw.
- The cameras, yeah.

504
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,987
She really doesn't want you
and the cameras up here now.

505
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:16,590
Right. Ah, well, at least--
How is she doin' ?

506
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,108
l--

507
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:21,424
l gave her a drink.
l thought--

508
00:31:21,514 --> 00:31:24,153
But she's not much of a drinker,
so it's made her a little...

509
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:26,748
- What do you want ?
- belligerent.

510
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:28,586
Hey, Shari.

511
00:31:28,674 --> 00:31:31,188
Listen, l'm real sorry about all this.

512
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:33,469
Can l come up ?

513
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:35,749
Come on, Shari.

514
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:40,703
l know it's real awkward with the
cameras, but let me come say two words.

515
00:31:40,794 --> 00:31:43,069
Shari, come on, would ya ?

516
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:45,543
l'm gettin' really wet down here.
Can l come up ?

517
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:49,906
All right, here we go, Carlos.

518
00:31:49,994 --> 00:31:52,462
Just stay with him.
Stay with him.

519
00:31:52,554 --> 00:31:54,385
Hang on, Mike.

520
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:57,068
- Ken, am l set ?
- You're hard-wired, Mike.

521
00:32:01,554 --> 00:32:03,465
- Hi.
- Hey.

522
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,510
- Thanks for lettin' me up.
- Sure.

523
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:09,183
Hey, Shari.

524
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:12,584
- l'm gonna go to bed. Good night.
- Did l miss anything ?

525
00:32:12,674 --> 00:32:14,710
Good night.

526
00:32:14,794 --> 00:32:17,069
Hi, Mom.

527
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,946
Ray feels--

528
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:27,106
Don't defend
that horse's ass to me !

529
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:30,709
l'm not. l'm not
defending him, Shari.

530
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:34,389
l'm just sayin',
maybe this is a good thing.

531
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:36,908
He got it out of his system, right ?

532
00:32:36,994 --> 00:32:38,905
He knows it's not worth it.

533
00:32:38,994 --> 00:32:43,033
- So one day if you two
decide to get married--
- Ha !

534
00:32:43,114 --> 00:32:45,912
l've got news for you.

535
00:32:45,994 --> 00:32:50,112
l never intended to marry him.

536
00:32:50,194 --> 00:32:52,264
Why ?

537
00:32:52,354 --> 00:32:54,914
Well, for one thing...

538
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:58,311
he's a bad lay.

539
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,548
l mean bad !

540
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:08,867
Oh !

541
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,263
You tell him !

542
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:14,824
Ah, you know that's terrible.

543
00:33:14,914 --> 00:33:17,109
Oh, shit.

544
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:20,150
Hey, Shari--

545
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:22,065
You happy now, Ray ?

546
00:33:22,154 --> 00:33:25,066
Listen, l think you're pissed-off
at him, and you're hurt.

547
00:33:25,154 --> 00:33:27,463
And you're trying
to get back at Ray.

548
00:33:27,554 --> 00:33:29,510
Don't you think ?

549
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:33,911
Yep, you're right. lt's me.

550
00:33:33,994 --> 00:33:36,747
lt's me ! lt's always me !

551
00:33:38,194 --> 00:33:42,312
l-- l go out with
all different kinds of guys,

552
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:45,431
and the same thing
keeps happening !

553
00:33:45,514 --> 00:33:47,391
Look. You know what ?
See these magazines ?

554
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:51,149
l take these quizzes.
"How Are You At Relationships ?"

555
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:58,626
l cheat, okay ?
l look in the back for the answers.

556
00:33:58,714 --> 00:34:01,751
Rita says men suck
and they should all die.

557
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:06,271
Then she eats a pound cake.
She's crazy, but she's not confused.

558
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:12,666
Me, l examine every little thing.

559
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:15,109
l'm just like this.

560
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:19,550
- Shari.
- What ?

561
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:24,264
You're way too terrific of a person
to be doin' this to yourself. You are.

562
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:30,428
l mean, hey, l've told Ray
a couple of times...

563
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:34,473
l think you are one
of the best and smartest...

564
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:37,466
and most attractive women
that l have ever met.

565
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:39,465
l mean that.

566
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:47,069
- Really ?
- Yeah, really.

567
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:49,190
Really.

568
00:34:49,274 --> 00:34:52,823
There is nothin' wrong with you.

569
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:55,747
Uh-oh.

570
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:06,630
Kiss him. Kiss him !

571
00:35:06,714 --> 00:35:08,705
Don't do it, Ed.

572
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:12,985
Don't you kiss her.
Don't you kiss her.

573
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:19,113
God !

574
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:23,268
l'm nuts, huh ?
Hah ! l told him.

575
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,946
Yes ! Yes, l win !

576
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:29,186
Oh, Whitaker, you schmuck,
l am the golden goddess of television !

577
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:39,743
Oh, my God.

578
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:47,351
Yes, yes, you're on television.
You're on television !

579
00:35:47,434 --> 00:35:50,312
Oh, my God.

580
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:53,067
Oh, God !

581
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:56,025
Oh, wow.

582
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:58,753
Listen, Shari ?
lt's okay.

583
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:02,543
l just kissed my boyfriend's brother
on television ! How is that okay ?

584
00:36:02,634 --> 00:36:04,829
When you put it that way,
no, it's not ideal.

585
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,666
- Please go. Go !
- Let's talk.

586
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:09,905
All right. We're outta here, guys.
Come on, she's right.

587
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:13,031
Son of a bitch.
What the hell just happened ?

588
00:36:13,114 --> 00:36:14,945
Hey, hey !

589
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:18,993
- Ed, you can't do this to me !
- We're locked out !

590
00:36:25,954 --> 00:36:29,629
No, Carlos, you're killing me !
Just shoot the door.
l got Mike up on the roof.

591
00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:31,466

592
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:36,229
What are we doing ?

593
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,783
- l've got to tell you something.
- What ?

594
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:45,503
- l've had a big thing for you
for months.
- Really ?

595
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:49,633
Yeah. l've been seeing you going out
with Ray and you bein' his girlfriend,

596
00:36:49,714 --> 00:36:52,467
and the whole time l was wishing
you were my girlfriend.

597
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:54,624
See, me, too !

598
00:36:54,714 --> 00:37:00,232
l am going out with Ray,
and all l can think about is you.

599
00:37:08,274 --> 00:37:10,549
l treated you like a princess !

600
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:13,626
- This is so weird.
- Yeah, it is weird.

601
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,985
Oh, l gotta go.

602
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:39,270
 Uno mas ?

603
00:37:57,794 --> 00:37:59,989

00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:02,542
- ls he around ?
- l'm on television !

605
00:38:02,634 --> 00:38:05,990
Ray was here, but he left when
he saw you were comin' over.

606
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:08,668
- Shit.
- That was some night last night, huh ?

607
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:11,473
Yeah, it damn sure was, Al.

608
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:13,465
All right, how about Mom ?
ls she around ?

609
00:38:13,554 --> 00:38:17,627
She's here in the bedroom.
l'd yell for her, but l'd die.

610
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,069
Don't do that. Mom !

611
00:38:20,154 --> 00:38:25,467
l'm here, darlin'. No need to shout.
That's not how you were brought up.

612
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:28,148
Mom, what are you doin'.

613
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:31,465
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to my home.

614
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:33,670
- Blanche DuBois lives.
- Mom, Mom.

615
00:38:33,754 --> 00:38:37,383
l'm looking for Ray. l've been calling
him. He won't call me back.

616
00:38:37,474 --> 00:38:39,908
How could you do something like that ?
Your own brother's girlfriend.

617
00:38:39,994 --> 00:38:42,110
lt's not all my fault.
He cheated on her.

618
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:46,506
- lt was a mistake.
- Yes, it was a mistake.
Do you know where he is ?

619
00:38:46,594 --> 00:38:49,267
No. Maybe he's watching.

620
00:38:49,354 --> 00:38:52,312
Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you
will stay away from that girl.

621
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:55,227
No, Ma ! And that girl
has a name, okay ?

622
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:58,704
What, do you love her
or something ?

623
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,024
- Come on, Al.
- Look at that red face.

624
00:39:01,114 --> 00:39:03,105
l had a car that color.
A Buick !

625
00:39:03,194 --> 00:39:05,025
Aren't you excited ?

626
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:07,867
- He practically said
he loved you on television !
- l know.

627
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:11,105
Hi, girls. Hi.

You understand that ?

630
00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:28,872

00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:32,549
Here we go, girls.

632
00:39:32,634 --> 00:39:35,512
Yeah, Doc,

633
00:39:35,594 --> 00:39:37,903
You gave me doll hair !

634
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:39,871

635
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:46,393
-Okay, now l'll tell you something else.
-Yeah.

636
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:50,513
- The old guy in the wheelchair,
the stepfather ?
- Yeah.

637
00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:53,062
They're gonna have him die.

638
00:39:54,314 --> 00:39:57,192
That was Whitaker on the phone.

639
00:39:57,274 --> 00:40:01,825
l'm gonna have to scrub my ass
because he's on his way over to kiss it.

640
00:40:03,354 --> 00:40:05,788
Ed, bring it on in, buddy.

641
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:08,752
That's right, come on.

642
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:13,265
A little further. Come on.
All right, perfect, man.

643
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:17,671
- l got my own parking spot now ?
- lt's all for you, Ed.

644
00:40:17,754 --> 00:40:20,632
- How's it going, man ?
- Good, Mark, how are you ?

645
00:40:20,714 --> 00:40:23,706
- Thanks, man.
- Ed, you're the best, man.

646
00:40:23,794 --> 00:40:25,750
-Hi, Mom.
-Saw you last night. Lookin' good, man.

647
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:27,984
Hi, Ed.

648
00:40:28,074 --> 00:40:30,542
Ray ! Man, l've been
lookin' all over for you.

649
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:33,387
Listen, l know l got
some explaining to do.

650
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,908
Just let me do
what l came here to do.

651
00:40:35,994 --> 00:40:37,871
What, do you want to fight ?

652
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:42,507
Cassie. Cassie, come on.

653
00:40:42,594 --> 00:40:44,903
- This is really hard.
- You promised.

654
00:40:44,994 --> 00:40:49,112
- What are you doing, Ray ?
- Go ahead.

655
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:53,312
l went out with Ray
a few years ago...

656
00:40:53,394 --> 00:40:55,350
for a couple of months,

657
00:40:55,434 --> 00:40:57,948
and we were intimate.

658
00:40:59,354 --> 00:41:04,303
And... he's really not as bad
as that girl said he was.

659
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:07,591
- l mean, l've definitely had worse.
- That's enough.

660
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,507
l think we did what we came here for.

661
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:13,825
- Good-bye, brother.
- No, no, come on, Ray !

662
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:15,233
Vindicated !

663
00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:18,784
Ray, what are you--

664
00:41:18,874 --> 00:41:20,751
l'm in the bathroom. Go ahead.

665
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:22,790
Sorry we're calling so late.

666
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:26,753
- lt's this is the only time we
get to talk to you off camera.
- lt's cool, Cynthia, l was up.

667
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:29,064
Ed, why didn't you go
see Shari today, man ?

668
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:32,908
- That's what everybody
was hoping you'd do.
- l wanted to, but--

669
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:37,192
ls it about Ray ? Because Ray is
not a problem. He cheated on Shari.

670
00:41:37,274 --> 00:41:40,744
That's right, Ed. Viewers don't like
Ray. The research says females--

671
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:44,224
No, hey, guys,
it's not Ray. Okay ?

672
00:41:44,314 --> 00:41:47,670
- Cynthia ?
- Yes, Ed ?

673
00:41:47,754 --> 00:41:50,712
You got a second ?
Can l talk to you alone for a second ?

674
00:41:50,794 --> 00:41:54,867
Absolutely, yeah. Why don't you guys
take off ? l'll see you in the morning.

675
00:41:54,954 --> 00:41:57,787
- Okay, see you later.
- All right, l'll see you later.

676
00:41:57,874 --> 00:42:00,707
Good-bye. All right.
See you later.

677
00:42:02,114 --> 00:42:03,991
Ed, how's it goin' ?

678
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:08,784
l'm good, you know ? l'm, l'm good.
Everything's-- Everything's cool.

679
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:11,593
Did you decide you don't
really like Shari that much ?

680
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:15,030
No ! N-N-N-No !
Listen, that's not it at all.

681
00:42:15,114 --> 00:42:18,629
l like Shari plenty.
Shari is-- Oh, man.

682
00:42:18,714 --> 00:42:21,831
- Shari's great.
- Yeah ?

683
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:26,708
Look, Cynthia,
how's this gonna work ?

684
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,912
What, are we gonna date on TV ?
She's not gonna like that.

685
00:42:30,994 --> 00:42:34,623
- lf you don't call her, you're
not really giving her a choice.
- Okay.

686
00:42:34,714 --> 00:42:36,830
- Ed ?
- What ?

687
00:42:36,914 --> 00:42:41,271
- Can l give you some advice
about women ?
- Sure.

688
00:42:41,354 --> 00:42:44,551
Women want to be pursued.

689
00:42:44,634 --> 00:42:46,625
Yes, but--

690
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:48,705
- Ed ?
- Huh ?

691
00:42:48,794 --> 00:42:51,103
What would Burt do ?

692
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:08,832
This is so exciting.
A real celebrity delivering my figs.

693
00:43:08,914 --> 00:43:11,587
Yeah. Okay, if you would
just sign right here, please.

694
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:15,747
Ray's a pig. That Ed is a doll.
Latch onto him, honey.

695
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:18,189
Okay. Just sign right there
in the black area, please.

696
00:43:18,274 --> 00:43:22,711
lt wouldn't kill you to use more makeup
on television. You look washed out.

697
00:43:22,794 --> 00:43:25,706
- What would l actually have to do
do get you to sign this ?
- Uh-huh.

698
00:43:25,794 --> 00:43:29,423
On television a minute,
and already you got an attitude.

699
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,385
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

700
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:36,866
Hi.

701
00:43:36,954 --> 00:43:41,106
- What are you doing ?
- l missed you.

702
00:43:41,194 --> 00:43:43,424
Really ?

703
00:43:43,514 --> 00:43:45,550
l--

704
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:53,868
Wow. l've never seen you
in uniform before.

705
00:43:53,954 --> 00:43:55,785
Yeah, well--

706
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:59,389
lt's really quite a turnoff.

707
00:43:59,474 --> 00:44:01,112
Thank you.

708
00:44:01,194 --> 00:44:04,903
Listen, Sunday night
at the Sharks game,

709
00:44:04,994 --> 00:44:06,871
l'm gonna be driving the Zamboni.

710
00:44:06,954 --> 00:44:09,514
- The what ?
- That big machine that cleans
the ice, you know ?

711
00:44:09,594 --> 00:44:14,304
lt's quite an honor.
Will you go with me ?

712
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:23,825
Say, look, l know
this is weird, Shari,

713
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:27,509
but l don't want to wait.

714
00:44:27,594 --> 00:44:29,425
l don't.

715
00:44:29,514 --> 00:44:32,392
l really think we might
have something here.

716
00:44:33,394 --> 00:44:35,271
Don't you ?

717
00:44:41,434 --> 00:44:44,392
- Oh, these are for you.
- Thank you.

718
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:48,545
So will you be my Zamboni date ?

719
00:44:48,634 --> 00:44:50,784
Huh ?

720
00:44:51,634 --> 00:44:53,943
- Yes.
- All right.

721
00:44:59,274 --> 00:45:03,950
- Cynthia, this is great.
This is incredible !
- lt's perfect.

722
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,831
Yeah, well.

723
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:12,633
Ladies and gentlemen, Ed Pekurny !

724
00:45:12,714 --> 00:45:14,625
Whoo !

725
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:16,705
Whoo !

726
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:22,750
Where's my girl ? Where's my girl ?
There she is !

727
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:24,870
Shari !

728
00:45:26,794 --> 00:45:30,309
Let's go, Ed !
Let's go, Ed !

729
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:42,865
There are girls

730
00:45:42,954 --> 00:45:45,070
Just ripe for some kissin'

731
00:45:45,154 --> 00:45:46,985
And l mean

732
00:45:47,074 --> 00:45:49,508
To kiss me a few

733
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:53,792
Man, those chicks don't know
what they're missing

734
00:45:53,874 --> 00:45:56,263
- Ow ! Don't kick me in the shin.
- Don't make fun of him !

735
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:58,345
Living to do

736
00:45:58,434 --> 00:46:01,506
Sizzlin' steaks all ready

737
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:03,346
For tastin'

738
00:46:03,434 --> 00:46:07,871
And those Cadillacs
all shiny and new

739
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:11,908
Oh, my God, Ed, look !

740
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:16,150
Got a lot of living to do

741
00:46:18,474 --> 00:46:20,351
Hey, it's Ed !

742
00:46:22,674 --> 00:46:25,188
Good evening, Ken.
How's it goin' ?

743
00:46:25,274 --> 00:46:29,904
How's it goin' ? The girl l'm seeing
is dancing with that guy right there.

744
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:31,871
Good night.

745
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:34,548
Oh, my God, it's Ed !

746
00:46:34,634 --> 00:46:36,989
- Eddie !
- You're the man, Ed !

747
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:39,463
My man Ed ! Ed !

748
00:46:39,554 --> 00:46:41,431
Look at this.
How cool is this ?

749
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:45,268
He's a Beatle. Well, he's not
a Beatle, but he's a Spice Girl,

750
00:46:45,354 --> 00:46:47,151
or a Beanie Baby.

751
00:46:47,234 --> 00:46:49,987
He's Menudo !

752
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:53,225
Hey, Shari, lucky lady !
l want to be on TV with you.

753
00:46:53,314 --> 00:46:55,748
Look over there at that monitor.

754
00:46:55,834 --> 00:46:57,825
- Stop it !
- Who do you think you are ?
Just take a picture.

755
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:03,473
Shari !

756
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,227
Move, move, get out of the goddamn way !
Come here ! Come here !

757
00:47:06,314 --> 00:47:09,067
Shari !

758
00:47:09,154 --> 00:47:11,622
Hold on, l got you. Back off !

759
00:47:11,714 --> 00:47:15,707
l got you. Back, back !

760
00:47:15,794 --> 00:47:17,671
You okay, baby ?

761
00:47:19,474 --> 00:47:20,463
Okay, we're gonna take a break now.
Just take five.

762
00:47:27,314 --> 00:47:29,703
Are you okay ?

763
00:47:29,794 --> 00:47:32,024
Oh, wow. You went down.

764
00:47:32,114 --> 00:47:34,389
l lost an earring.

765
00:47:34,474 --> 00:47:36,988
You think you can go out
and get it ?

766
00:47:37,074 --> 00:47:41,226
- Yeah, l'll get it.
- No, l'm just kidding.

767
00:47:41,314 --> 00:47:44,704
-You're kiddin'?
-Just kidding. Would you really do that?

768
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:48,469
Yeah, l'd do that.
l mean, if you wanted... your earring.

769
00:47:48,554 --> 00:47:53,582
l didn't wanna make a scene

770
00:47:55,274 --> 00:47:58,505
But you were there

771
00:47:58,594 --> 00:48:01,984
l saw you slip away

772
00:48:02,074 --> 00:48:05,350
You were everything good to me

773
00:48:08,994 --> 00:48:11,588
l saw you slip away

774
00:48:11,674 --> 00:48:15,553
You were everything good to me

775
00:48:15,634 --> 00:48:18,706
Oh, wow, that's
the new camera truck, huh ?

776
00:48:18,794 --> 00:48:21,354
Look at my enormous head.

777
00:48:21,594 --> 00:48:24,392
Anyway, Cynthia,
last night, that was scary.

778
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:27,864
Don't worry about that.
That won't happen again.
We're getting you security.

779
00:48:27,954 --> 00:48:30,593
- Good.
- l have some news for you.

780
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:35,702
- What's that ?
- We're picking up Ed TV
for another month.

781
00:48:35,794 --> 00:48:37,591
Say that again.

782
00:48:37,674 --> 00:48:39,426
We're picking you up
for another month.

783
00:48:39,514 --> 00:48:42,506
That means a balloon payment
and a big raise next month.

784
00:48:42,594 --> 00:48:45,062
Are you tellin' me
that the balloon payment,

785
00:48:45,154 --> 00:48:47,190
- l'm gonna get that ?
- Yeah.

786
00:48:47,274 --> 00:48:49,151
Oh !

787
00:48:50,514 --> 00:48:52,391
Here we go.

788
00:48:54,194 --> 00:48:56,788
Thank you ! Oh, man,
this is incredible.

789
00:48:56,874 --> 00:48:58,865
This is amazing !

790
00:48:58,954 --> 00:49:01,912
Yes ! Another month
and a balloon payment !

791
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:03,871
Ray, if you're watching--

792
00:49:03,954 --> 00:49:06,149
- Who the hell'd be watching this.
- Did you hear this ?

793
00:49:06,714 --> 00:49:10,070
l got the payment, buddy. This money's
for you ! To pay back that loan !

794
00:49:10,154 --> 00:49:12,463
lt's for you, brother ! Come on.

795
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:16,593
What do we do when we're happy ?
Chicken dance, baby.

796
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:20,794
Come on, l know you're doin' it
wherever you are.

797
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,910
lf l was doin' it,
l wouldn't do it like that.

798
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:25,633
l'm on for another month

799
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:31,589
Faster

800
00:49:32,754 --> 00:49:35,314
Fingers start shakin'

801
00:49:38,314 --> 00:49:40,828
Everybody back up, please.

802
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:46,664
Please, clear a path to the car.

803
00:49:46,754 --> 00:49:48,392
Get off, man.

804
00:49:55,594 --> 00:49:58,984
Four weeks ago, no one in America
had ever heard of Ed Pekurny.

805
00:49:59,074 --> 00:50:01,429
Today this 31-year-old
video store clerk...

806
00:50:01,514 --> 00:50:05,905
has become something of an American
icon, a national obsession.

807
00:50:05,994 --> 00:50:08,224
Honestly ?

808
00:50:08,314 --> 00:50:11,624
l try not to go to the bathroom
until Ed goes to the bathroom...

809
00:50:11,714 --> 00:50:13,750
so l don't miss anything.

810
00:50:13,834 --> 00:50:18,749
- The idea just came to me.
- Sure, it came to you
because l brought it to you.

811
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:22,622
l'm not a-- l'm not a guy who works
by committee. l'm a one-man show.

812
00:50:22,714 --> 00:50:24,750
What do you guys
think about Shari ?

813
00:50:24,834 --> 00:50:26,665
She's needy !
l don't like her.

814
00:50:26,754 --> 00:50:29,188
She's too tall.
lt's, like, abnormal.

815
00:50:29,274 --> 00:50:33,028
Yeah. She creeps me out.
She's always, "Get away !"

816
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:34,945
l mean,
who does she think she is ?

817
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:37,070
l know !
And she's so bony !

818
00:50:37,154 --> 00:50:40,271
Like to me, this Shari's
like nothing, right ?

819
00:50:40,354 --> 00:50:43,346
She's not even hot.
l mean, Ed's a celebrity.

820
00:50:43,434 --> 00:50:45,789
lf that was me,
l'd be dating the goods.

821
00:50:45,874 --> 00:50:49,071
There's like something wrong with her.
She's definitely not hot.

822
00:50:49,154 --> 00:50:51,145
Not hot, not hot. No way.

823

- l'm gonna go get ready.
- Baby ! Hey, is everything all right ?

843
00:51:58,154 --> 00:52:01,226
My truck broke down,
and l got stuck in the rain.

844
00:52:01,314 --> 00:52:04,624
l called the company,
and no one came to get me.

845
00:52:04,714 --> 00:52:06,545
- Rita !
- Just a second.

846
00:52:06,634 --> 00:52:11,754
- Don't they give you a hat ?
- Some dorky kid stole it as a souvenir.

847
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:14,064
That sucks.

848
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:18,432
l'm kinda glad that he did,
'cause, goddamn, you look sexy.

849
00:52:20,914 --> 00:52:23,587
Ed, l don't wanna be
on television anymore.

850
00:52:26,794 --> 00:52:28,546
Shari, how's that gonna work ?

851
00:52:28,634 --> 00:52:30,704
l have been trying, okay ?

852
00:52:34,794 --> 00:52:38,070
But maybe we should just
hold off on seeing each other...

853
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:42,909
until you are done
with all of this.

854
00:52:46,354 --> 00:52:48,584
You're outta there, baby !
All right ? Yeah !

855
00:52:48,674 --> 00:52:50,744

856
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,712
- That's a little extreme, isn't it ?
- l can't take it anymore.

857
00:52:53,794 --> 00:52:57,753
- l have no privacy.
- Oh, boo-hoo.

858
00:52:57,834 --> 00:53:01,110
Even now l'm crying, and l can't stop,
and they won't leave.

859
00:53:01,194 --> 00:53:03,230
And now it's gonna be

- Everybody, this is Hank, my dad.
- This just keeps getting better.

969
00:59:16,394 --> 00:59:19,192
What you're sayin', Ma, is that

00:59:19,274 --> 00:59:22,584
- was a lie.
- Yes... practically.

971
00:59:25,314 --> 00:59:27,270
What do you mean,
"practically" ?

972
00:59:27,354 --> 00:59:30,152
Either you threw him out
or he ran away. Which one is it ?

973
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,065
l need to replace the coil.

974
00:59:32,154 --> 00:59:34,543
He ran away after l threw him out.

975
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:37,273
- How much is one of those new coils ?
- A hundred fifty bucks.

976
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:39,231
- He was telling the truth.
- Should l go ahead ?

977
00:59:39,314 --> 00:59:42,431
- Yes.
- Yes to me, or yes to the coil ?

978
00:59:42,514 --> 00:59:45,472
- Both.
- Oh, shit.

979
00:59:45,554 --> 00:59:49,752
- Look, he had girlfriends.
- He told me he had this one girl.

980
00:59:49,834 --> 00:59:53,907
l really do not need to relive this on
national television. l am your mother.

981
00:59:53,994 --> 00:59:56,303
- Yes, you are my mother.
- Do not humiliate me like this !

982
00:59:56,394 --> 00:59:59,386
- l'm not trying to humiliate you.
- l don't need this ! Go away !

983
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:01,351
Eddie ?

984
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:06,349
Make this out to Dr. Rumpley.
Maybe the son of a bitch won't
keep me waiting for an hour.

985
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:08,789
Damn neurologists think
they run the world.

986
01:00:08,874 --> 01:00:11,672
She does this every time.

987
01:00:11,754 --> 01:00:14,791
- All right, do you want
to know the truth ?
- Yeah.

988
01:00:14,874 --> 01:00:19,231
l took you, Ray and Marcia to my
sister's on the train for the weekend.

989
01:00:19,314 --> 01:00:23,990
You all came down with chicken pox,
so l took you home a day early.

990
01:00:24,074 --> 01:00:26,542
And l walked in,
and there was your father...

991
01:00:26,634 --> 01:00:29,432
with another women
in our bed, okay.

992
01:00:29,514 --> 01:00:32,904
Chicken pox.
l was six when l had chicken pox,

993
01:00:32,994 --> 01:00:37,112
- and Dad didn't leave until l was 12.
- Well, he apologized.

994
01:00:37,194 --> 01:00:40,106
- What do you mean, he apologized ?
- He begged me.

995
01:00:40,194 --> 01:00:42,264
He got down on his knees
and he begged me.

996
01:00:42,354 --> 01:00:44,868
But, Mom, you told me
that you had a hysterectomy,

997
01:00:44,954 --> 01:00:47,593
and that he ran off
with your nurse.

998
01:00:48,714 --> 01:00:50,625
She could've been a nurse.

999
01:00:50,714 --> 01:00:53,751
- What do you mean,
could've been a nurse ?
- She had white shoes.

1000
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:57,190
So does Grandma !
So does Shaquille O'Neal !

1001
01:00:58,314 --> 01:01:00,191
- That's good.
- What's the difference ?

1002
01:01:00,274 --> 01:01:03,072
The difference is that for 20 years
l've been thinking one thing,

1003
01:01:03,154 --> 01:01:06,749
- and now it's turned out
to be a whole different thing !
- Eddie.

1004
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:11,032
He was no good to me.
Don't you remember the way it was ?

1005
01:01:11,114 --> 01:01:14,231
Don't you remember the way
he used to scream at me ?

1006
01:01:14,314 --> 01:01:16,874
And then no job was ever
good enough for him.

1007
01:01:16,954 --> 01:01:20,708
"Small potatoes."
You remember, Al ?

1008
01:01:22,954 --> 01:01:25,752
Al ?

1009
01:01:31,274 --> 01:01:33,105
Mom,

1010
01:01:33,194 --> 01:01:37,107
you told me you didn't know Al
until after Dad left.

1011
01:01:40,394 --> 01:01:42,464
Holy shit.

1012
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,070
You and Al were--

1013
01:01:48,274 --> 01:01:51,983
And that's why you threw Dad out.
There it is !

1014
01:01:52,074 --> 01:01:55,191
Finally the truth
after 20 goddamn years, Mom ?

1015
01:01:55,274 --> 01:01:57,742
He had another woman
in my bed, Eddie !

1016
01:01:57,834 --> 01:02:02,589
And how dare you call him "dad"
in front of Al. Al is your father.

1017
01:02:02,674 --> 01:02:05,825
This is the one who was there for you
when you really needed someone.

1018
01:02:05,914 --> 01:02:08,826
Ow ! You're hurting me.

1019
01:02:08,914 --> 01:02:11,030
Oh, Jeanette.

1020
01:02:11,114 --> 01:02:12,991
Oh, Mom.

1021
01:02:15,114 --> 01:02:19,187
Don't blame your mother.
l was irresistible.

1022
01:02:29,314 --> 01:02:31,145
Well, come on in.

1023
01:02:31,234 --> 01:02:33,350
How are you doin' ?

1024
01:02:33,434 --> 01:02:36,426
- All right.
- All right. Well--

1025
01:02:36,514 --> 01:02:40,189
- You ?
- Yeah, yeah. l'm, l'm fine.

1026
01:02:41,994 --> 01:02:44,554
l guess you came up here
to check on your inheritance.

1027
01:02:44,634 --> 01:02:46,704
Did ya ?

1028
01:02:48,194 --> 01:02:51,470
Come right over here.
You sit right down there.

1029
01:02:51,554 --> 01:02:53,431
There you go.

1030
01:02:53,514 --> 01:02:56,392
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1031
01:02:56,474 --> 01:03:01,753
This is, uh,
quite a shithole, ain't it ?

1032
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:04,473
Well, it could be...
if you fixed it up.

1033
01:03:06,634 --> 01:03:09,432
- Jeanette, you better
take a look at this.
- Okay.

1034
01:03:09,514 --> 01:03:12,711
- Oh, boy.
- You know, it is really nice of you...

1035
01:03:12,794 --> 01:03:15,433
to come up here.

1036
01:03:15,514 --> 01:03:19,223
A million times l wanted
to see you kids, but, uh, well--

1037
01:03:19,314 --> 01:03:23,193
l mean, your mom,
she told me to stay away.

1038
01:03:23,274 --> 01:03:26,232
And l had to respect
her wishes.

1039
01:03:28,314 --> 01:03:31,465
- Can l ask you somethin' ?
- Anything.

1040
01:03:35,714 --> 01:03:40,026
What happened, Pop ?
l mean, how'd you end up...

1041
01:03:40,114 --> 01:03:44,073
- like this ?
- You know, life is funny. That's all.

1042
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,827
l can't tell you
how many times if...

1043
01:03:46,914 --> 01:03:49,747
just one little thing
that l needed would've happened,

1044
01:03:49,834 --> 01:03:52,632
why, everything would've changed,
l'll tell you that.

1045
01:03:52,714 --> 01:03:54,545
But l don't make excuses.

1046
01:03:54,634 --> 01:03:56,943
And l don't hold grudges.

1047
01:03:57,034 --> 01:04:00,185
You and me, we had some good times
together, didn't we ? Huh ?

1048
01:04:03,194 --> 01:04:06,550
Remember the time we drove
down to Houston for the weekend,

1049
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,194
and we saw the Astros
and the Dodgers play ?

1050
01:04:09,274 --> 01:04:12,471
We stayed in a motel.
lt was just you and me.

1051
01:04:12,554 --> 01:04:15,671
You hopped from bed to bed.

1052
01:04:15,754 --> 01:04:18,826
l remember that
just like it was yesterday.

1053
01:04:18,914 --> 01:04:22,748
l remember everything you said
and everything you did.

1054
01:04:24,154 --> 01:04:26,543
- That was Ray, Pop.
- Hmm ?

1055
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:29,273
You took Ray to Houston.

1056
01:04:29,354 --> 01:04:33,188
lt wasn't me. l had to stay home...
with Mom and Marcia.

1057
01:04:36,674 --> 01:04:38,710
That's right. Ray.

1058
01:04:38,794 --> 01:04:41,103
Ray was the older one.

1059
01:04:41,194 --> 01:04:43,105
Still is.

1060
01:04:45,394 --> 01:04:47,225
Yeah.

1061
01:04:47,314 --> 01:04:50,465
Well,

1062
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:52,909
isn't that something ?

1063
01:04:52,994 --> 01:04:55,189
Damn the mind !

1064
01:04:55,274 --> 01:04:57,105
l gotta go, Pop.

1065
01:04:57,194 --> 01:05:00,982
- l got a thing across town
l gotta get to.
- Sure, son, sure.

1066
01:05:05,194 --> 01:05:07,344
You know what ?

1067
01:05:07,434 --> 01:05:09,994
Listen up.
This is my pop. All right ?

1068
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:12,383
lf there's anybody out there
that can help him out--

1069
01:05:12,474 --> 01:05:16,308
- Get him a job or something--
- l drove a limo for a while.

1070
01:05:16,394 --> 01:05:18,862
l'll help you out.
l'll mention your business on the air--

1071
01:05:18,954 --> 01:05:20,785
l don't have a valid license.

1072
01:05:20,874 --> 01:05:24,071
We'll figure something out,
all right ?

1073
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:27,711
- All right.
- Ed.

1074
01:05:29,034 --> 01:05:31,594
Yeah.

1075
01:05:31,674 --> 01:05:34,063
l am truly sorry.

1076
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,505
That's good, Pop.
Sorry's good.

1077
01:06:30,474 --> 01:06:34,865
As soon as we're perpendicular to
the Earth, l'll start the engines again.

1078
01:06:34,954 --> 01:06:36,945
What about the disk ?

1079
01:06:44,154 --> 01:06:47,271
Oh, God. Boy, oh, boy.

1080
01:06:54,474 --> 01:06:57,432
Hi.

1081
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:59,391
Hey.

1082
01:07:00,714 --> 01:07:03,831
- They're not here.
- How's that ?

1083
01:07:03,914 --> 01:07:06,553
l snuck out.

1084
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:12,310
You wanna take a drive ?

1085
01:07:12,394 --> 01:07:14,783
- Sure.
- Okay.

1086
01:07:15,554 --> 01:07:17,545
Now Pop's hustling me for a job.

1087
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:21,752
lt's like my entire family, Shari.
lt's like they're from
their own little galaxy.

1088
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:24,473
Every family's crazy.

1089
01:07:24,554 --> 01:07:27,193
- Yeah, but my--
- No, l mean,

1090
01:07:27,274 --> 01:07:31,187
if it was my family on TV,

1091
01:07:31,274 --> 01:07:34,630
oh, my God, l'd have
to kill myself !

1092
01:07:47,154 --> 01:07:51,830
How about us ?
We're doing all right, aren't we ?

1093
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:58,749
l saw that girl come on to you
at The Tonight Show.

1094
01:07:58,834 --> 01:08:01,143
- Wh-- What girl ?
- That model.

1095
01:08:04,154 --> 01:08:06,588
Oh, wait a minute.
Shari, that was nothin'.

1096
01:08:06,674 --> 01:08:09,666
l was leaving, she needed
a ride to the airport,

1097
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:13,383
so l offered her a ride.

1098
01:08:13,474 --> 01:08:15,942
Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

1099
01:08:20,834 --> 01:08:24,713
l want you... Shari.

1100
01:08:24,794 --> 01:08:27,706
l don't want anybody else.

1101
01:08:29,554 --> 01:08:31,385
Really ?

1102
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:34,113
Yeah.

1103
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:36,071
lt's you l want.

1104
01:08:44,074 --> 01:08:46,508
lf you call

1105
01:08:46,594 --> 01:08:49,108
l will answer

1106
01:08:49,194 --> 01:08:51,185
lf you call

1107
01:08:54,954 --> 01:08:56,785
lf you court

1108
01:08:56,874 --> 01:09:00,230
This disaster

1109
01:09:13,994 --> 01:09:16,030
Dude ! Breasts !

1110
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:18,070
Huh ? Where ?

1111
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,793
Ed, help !

1112
01:09:20,874 --> 01:09:23,513
Come on, guys.
Don't, don't, don't.

1113
01:09:23,594 --> 01:09:24,993
Come on !

1114
01:09:26,794 --> 01:09:28,625
She left ?

1115
01:09:28,714 --> 01:09:33,344
Yeah. She asked for a transfer
to another city, and she left.

1116
01:09:33,434 --> 01:09:36,312
l mean, someone put her breasts
on the lnternet.

1117
01:09:36,394 --> 01:09:38,624
- Oh, Christ !
- She couldn't take it anymore.

1118
01:09:38,714 --> 01:09:43,663
We have people living in our hallway,
going through our trash, reporters.

1119
01:09:43,754 --> 01:09:47,906
So, she--
Not even good-bye. Nothin'.

1120
01:09:47,994 --> 01:09:50,224
Boy, you know,

1121
01:09:50,314 --> 01:09:54,148
when it starts to go wrong,
there's nothing you can do to stop it.

1122
01:09:54,234 --> 01:09:58,910
Because l don't think
l could've tried any harder.

1123
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:01,383
l don't.

1124
01:10:01,474 --> 01:10:03,430
Do you ?

1125
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:10,385
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1126
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:13,034
Uh-huh. Huh ?
You see ? You see ?

1127
01:10:13,114 --> 01:10:15,582
See that ?

1128
01:10:19,914 --> 01:10:22,064
- Oh, honey, hi.
- What are you doin' ?

1129
01:10:22,154 --> 01:10:24,952
- l know this might seem unusual.
- How'd you get in my apartment ?

1130
01:10:25,034 --> 01:10:27,468
l had to be stealthy
about the whole thing.

1131
01:10:27,554 --> 01:10:30,785
- What is she holding ?
- Ed's underwear.

1132
01:10:30,874 --> 01:10:33,104
- Get out of my house.
- l can explain everything.

1133
01:10:33,194 --> 01:10:35,867
Just get !
That's my underwear !

1134
01:10:35,954 --> 01:10:39,390
l love you, and l want
to marry you, Ed.

1135
01:10:39,474 --> 01:10:43,069
Watch his face. See ?
Now, that's television. Huh ?

1136
01:10:43,154 --> 01:10:45,145
All right.

1137
01:10:45,234 --> 01:10:48,306
Now, where do we go from here ?
Didn't we order lunch an hour ago ?

1138
01:10:48,394 --> 01:10:50,271
- Yes, Chinese.
- Good, good.

1139
01:10:50,354 --> 01:10:53,152
What do we have Ed do next ?
Springboards, ideas.

1140
01:10:53,234 --> 01:10:55,907
- Notions ! Cynthia ?
- We could help him find Shari.

1141
01:10:55,994 --> 01:10:59,543
No, no, no. Enough of her.
l hate her, audiences hate her.

1142
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:02,592
Let's bury her and move on.
Tell him l'll call him back.

1143
01:11:02,674 --> 01:11:06,553
Excuse me. Do you know, the audience is
requesting a lot of that girl Jill...

1144
01:11:06,634 --> 01:11:08,989
that he met on The Tonight Show;
she really scored.

1145
01:11:09,074 --> 01:11:11,713
Let's get her, let's make this happen.
What are we cocking around here for ?

1146
01:11:11,794 --> 01:11:13,625
Cynthia, do something.
Get on the phone.

1147
01:11:13,714 --> 01:11:16,182
ls lunch literally coming from China ?
l don't understand it.

1148
01:11:16,274 --> 01:11:21,268
Remember when you were interviewin' me
and asked me if l had a dream ?

1149
01:11:21,354 --> 01:11:24,790
And l said, "Sure, l've got a dream.
l just don't know what it is yet."

1150
01:11:24,874 --> 01:11:29,186
Yeah. Yeah, great line.
Try to work that into the show.

1151
01:11:30,474 --> 01:11:33,034
Wh-- What if Shari's the dream ?

1152
01:11:33,114 --> 01:11:37,505
Come on, Ed. You're beating yourself up
for nothing. You knew her history.

1153
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:41,633
When the going gets tough,
Shari gets going...

1154
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,148
as far away as possible.

1155
01:11:44,234 --> 01:11:47,351
She's one of those "l'll dump you
before you dump me" chicks.

1156
01:11:47,434 --> 01:11:50,824
Yeah. But what if we could get U.P.S.
to tell us where they sent her ?

1157
01:11:50,914 --> 01:11:55,590
Then l could go visit her, and we could
even move the show there for a while.

1158
01:11:55,674 --> 01:11:58,268
lf you want this thing
to work with her,

1159
01:11:58,354 --> 01:12:02,905
the best thing you can do right now
is to give her some space.

1160
01:12:02,994 --> 01:12:06,066
Maybe even, uh, see other people.

1161
01:12:06,154 --> 01:12:09,351
Whoa ! What do you mean ?
Like right away ? No.

1162
01:12:09,434 --> 01:12:12,631
- No, no, l--
- Ed, you're a star.

1163
01:12:12,714 --> 01:12:15,706
But celebrities like you...

1164
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:18,388
or Tom Cruise or whoever,
you have a responsibility.

1165
01:12:18,474 --> 01:12:23,389
l don't think your fans are gonna be too
thrilled sitting around watching you...

1166
01:12:23,474 --> 01:12:25,385
have a major case
of the "mopeys."

1167
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,590
They've got 200 channels
to choose from.

1168
01:12:27,674 --> 01:12:31,269
Ed, it's not like
you're giving up Shari.

1169
01:12:31,354 --> 01:12:33,743
My sister was going
with a guy.

1170
01:12:33,834 --> 01:12:37,668
They hit a little rough spot,
started seeing other people,
they got back together.

1171
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:42,225
Last month they had their third child,
for what it's worth.

1172
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:47,391
Twenty-two !
Thirty-two !

1173
01:12:47,474 --> 01:12:51,149
Two, stay with the quarterback.
One, you got the iso on Ed.

1174
01:12:52,554 --> 01:12:57,309
He breaks to the inside. Oh, gosh !
l think he's got a step on him !

1175
01:12:57,394 --> 01:12:59,589
Shecky, have you lost the feed ?

1176
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:03,349
- Ed ! Hey, Ed !
- Get up ! You lost the feed !

1177
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:09,104
- Hey, Jill. Ow !
- Ooh !

1178
01:13:09,194 --> 01:13:11,344
What are you doin' to me ?
Look alive !

1179
01:13:11,434 --> 01:13:14,073
You guys go ahead.
l'll be back... sometime.

1180
01:13:14,154 --> 01:13:16,384
Ed, where you goin' ?
Let's get the game goin' !

1181
01:13:16,474 --> 01:13:18,624
- No, it's not.
- lt's a setup.

1182
01:13:18,714 --> 01:13:20,545
l'm gonna ask Cynthia.

1183
01:13:20,634 --> 01:13:23,307
Come on ! lt's such a setup.

1184
01:13:23,394 --> 01:13:26,784
- Did you arrange this ?
- Whose dog is that ?

1185
01:13:26,874 --> 01:13:29,263
- Out for a walk.
- Walkin' your dog ?

1186
01:13:29,354 --> 01:13:31,345
- That's your dog.
- What's your dog's name ?

1187
01:13:31,434 --> 01:13:34,471
Um, Ginger.

1188
01:13:34,554 --> 01:13:37,114
- Nielsen looks pretty good on TV, huh ?
- Yeah.

1189
01:13:37,194 --> 01:13:39,025
Hey, man !
Way to go, Ed !

1190
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:41,912
- Picture's worth a thousand bucks.
- Oh, yeah !

1191
01:13:41,994 --> 01:13:44,588
Way to... baboom !

1192
01:13:44,674 --> 01:13:47,234
Ooh, that's delicious.

1193
01:13:54,074 --> 01:13:56,383
Smile, baby !

1194
01:13:58,314 --> 01:14:01,511
- Do you think she likes him ?
- She doesn't give a crap about him.

1195
01:14:08,114 --> 01:14:10,469
You want us to kiss ? Ed.

1196
01:14:13,674 --> 01:14:16,142
He should be a model or something.

1197
01:14:16,234 --> 01:14:18,065
He's gorgeous.

1198
01:14:27,034 --> 01:14:30,026
Hey, listen, should we, um--

1199
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:36,868
Ooh.

1200
01:14:36,954 --> 01:14:41,152
Oh, geez, it's, uh--

1201
01:14:41,234 --> 01:14:44,032
Listen, Jill, it's gettin'
kinda late, you know ?

1202
01:14:44,114 --> 01:14:45,945
- l mean--
- ls he kidding ?

1203
01:14:46,034 --> 01:14:48,264
What are you doing tomorrow night ?

1204
01:14:48,354 --> 01:14:51,346
Mm, tomorrow night.
l, um, l got a--

1205
01:14:51,434 --> 01:14:54,983
l got a thing l gotta--
No, that's not tomorrow night.

1206
01:14:56,874 --> 01:15:01,743
Well, listen. Why don't you
come around here, and, um...

1207
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:05,463
l can make you dinner, and maybe you
could bring a video, and, um--

1208
01:15:05,554 --> 01:15:09,263
Well, you know,
we can make a night of it. Hmm ?

1209
01:15:20,154 --> 01:15:21,587
Stay behind the barricade, folks.

1210
01:15:21,674 --> 01:15:23,585
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

1211
01:15:23,674 --> 01:15:25,551
Stay behind the barricade.

1212
01:15:25,634 --> 01:15:27,545
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

1213
01:15:27,634 --> 01:15:30,944
- Go, go, go, go, go, go
- Holy shit !

1214
01:15:40,074 --> 01:15:42,952
l'm startin' to feel
a little pressure.

1215
01:15:43,034 --> 01:15:45,184
- Think he's gonna do it ?
- Hell, yeah.

1216
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:49,313
- The guy hasn't had sex in six weeks.
- What, like we have ?

1217
01:15:49,394 --> 01:15:51,271
- Here we go. Yeah.
- Smile ! Smile !

1218
01:15:51,354 --> 01:15:54,391
- Great. Let me try them on.
- Sure, sure, sure.

1219
01:16:01,834 --> 01:16:04,712
We'll park your car for you, Ed.
Save your strength.

1220
01:16:08,434 --> 01:16:11,870
Go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go,

1221
01:16:26,034 --> 01:16:28,867
Get out of the way.
Clear the way.

1222
01:16:42,074 --> 01:16:44,827
Ed ! Ed ! Ed ! Ed !

1223
01:16:46,314 --> 01:16:48,953
- Hi.
- Hi.

1224
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:54,748
Jill ! Jill ! Jill !

1225
01:16:55,754 --> 01:16:58,632
- Come on in.
- Oh, wow.

1226
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,831
- Look at you !
- Oh, thanks.

1227
01:17:01,914 --> 01:17:03,745
Those boobs are so fake.

1228
01:17:03,834 --> 01:17:06,394
- She's such a slut.
- Total slut.

1229
01:17:14,674 --> 01:17:17,108
Big, big crowd tonight.

1230
01:17:17,194 --> 01:17:19,583
l know.
They've been there for hours.

1231
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:27,834
- Ed ? Do you want to come
and have a little nibble ?
- Yeah ?

1232
01:17:27,914 --> 01:17:30,792
Wha--

1233
01:17:30,874 --> 01:17:32,785
Oh.

1234
01:17:32,874 --> 01:17:35,229
Yeah. Sure.

1235
01:17:35,314 --> 01:17:37,191
Hey.

1236
01:17:37,274 --> 01:17:39,993
Here, baby.

1237
01:17:40,074 --> 01:17:42,588
- Thought you had a dog.
- Huh ?

1238
01:17:42,674 --> 01:17:45,586
Oh, no, that was a friend's.
l've just got lovely lsabella.

1239
01:17:45,674 --> 01:17:49,633
Hey, baby. Yes, good girl.
Down you go.

1240
01:17:49,714 --> 01:17:51,750
Good girl.

1241
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:54,064
A deeper shade of red

1242
01:17:54,154 --> 01:17:56,384
On your lips

1243
01:17:56,474 --> 01:17:59,705
Tryin' to find a way to be loved

1244
01:17:59,794 --> 01:18:04,914
Without ever givin' in

1245
01:18:09,234 --> 01:18:11,702
- Wow !
- Oh-ho !

1246
01:18:16,874 --> 01:18:19,707
- Good ?
- Mmm.

1247
01:18:19,794 --> 01:18:21,671
Mm-hmm.

1248
01:18:23,834 --> 01:18:26,985
Careful what you wish for

1249
01:18:27,074 --> 01:18:29,588
lt just might come true

1250
01:18:29,674 --> 01:18:32,472
Might come true

1251
01:18:32,554 --> 01:18:34,749
Uh, Mr. President ?

1252
01:18:38,154 --> 01:18:42,511
- lsn't this what you always wanted
- l love her !

1253
01:18:42,594 --> 01:18:45,154
- Get out of the way !
- l love her ! l love her !

1254
01:19:39,794 --> 01:19:42,103
Wow !

1255
01:19:46,474 --> 01:19:50,069
Hot damn !
We are go for sex, people.

1256
01:20:03,314 --> 01:20:06,863
l love this show, bro.

1257
01:20:06,954 --> 01:20:10,310
- ls this okay, Cynthia ?
- Don't leave yet.
This is cable. Stay with him.

1258
01:20:10,474 --> 01:20:13,432
Cynthia, Cynthia !
Will you get over there !

1259
01:20:23,114 --> 01:20:25,105
Oh, my.

1260
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:40,465
Ahh !

1261
01:20:40,554 --> 01:20:42,272
Oh ! What's he doing ?

1262
01:20:43,794 --> 01:20:46,433
Ed, you okay ?

1263
01:20:46,514 --> 01:20:49,267
Ohh, something broke my fall.

1264
01:20:49,354 --> 01:20:51,709
Ooh !

1265
01:20:51,794 --> 01:20:54,627
Ooh !

1266
01:20:56,914 --> 01:20:59,303
Please, let me through.

1267
01:20:59,394 --> 01:21:02,067
ls it bad ?
ls it bad ?

1268
01:21:02,154 --> 01:21:04,065
l think she just broke her leg.

1269
01:21:06,314 --> 01:21:09,545
- Excuse me.
- My back's a little sore.
l didn't break it.

1270
01:21:09,634 --> 01:21:12,467
- l can walk.
- We're just taking you in for an X ray.

1271
01:21:12,554 --> 01:21:16,513
The thing got the highest ratings.
Higher than the Super Bowl.

1272
01:21:16,594 --> 01:21:21,668
lt's kind of the same thing.
A big buildup, and then one team
just can't perform.

1273
01:21:21,754 --> 01:21:25,463
All that boy did was hurt
that little girl's pussy.

1274
01:21:25,554 --> 01:21:29,627
- Ooh !
- l'm talkin' about her cat.

1275
01:21:29,714 --> 01:21:34,947
lf Ed had been a stud, if he had
given a terrific performance that night,

1276
01:21:35,034 --> 01:21:37,707
the American people
would have loved him, but he failed us.

1277
01:21:37,794 --> 01:21:40,627
- No, l don't agree.
- He failed us as a man.

1278
01:21:41,434 --> 01:21:43,823
Look at this.

1279
01:21:43,914 --> 01:21:48,544
She did not--
She did not break my heart.

1280
01:21:48,634 --> 01:21:52,832
Look, l understand that l'm
fair game, but just tell it like it is.

1281
01:21:52,914 --> 01:21:56,509
She was a hot-lookin' chick.
l get that. l knew the score.

1282
01:21:56,594 --> 01:21:59,631
"Broke my heart."
No, you know what Jill did ?

1283
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:03,389
Jill went out to L.A. and got one of
those scandal agents that handle...

1284
01:22:03,474 --> 01:22:08,707
like Joey Buttafuoco,
Kato Kaelin and Gennifer Flowers--

1285
01:22:17,834 --> 01:22:21,110
Oh, my God, he wrote a book.

1286
01:22:26,754 --> 01:22:29,507
l mean, he never even
read a book, man.

1287
01:22:29,594 --> 01:22:34,224
What's your feeling about the meaning,
if any, of Ed TV ?

1288
01:22:34,314 --> 01:22:38,102
Well, Harry, l-l feel that
Ed is the apotheosis...

1289
01:22:38,194 --> 01:22:40,344
of a prevailing
American syndrome.

1290
01:22:40,434 --> 01:22:43,312
lt used to be that people
were famous for being special.

1291
01:22:43,394 --> 01:22:46,545
Now they're considered special,
uh, merely for being famous.

1292
01:22:46,634 --> 01:22:49,512
Fame has become a moral good...

1293
01:22:49,594 --> 01:22:52,552
in this country:
lt's its own virtue.

1294
01:22:57,994 --> 01:23:02,545
We thought since we had
Ray Pekurny on the panel today,
we'd talk about his book.

1295
01:23:02,634 --> 01:23:05,592
lt is called
"My Brother Pissed On Me."

1296
01:23:07,594 --> 01:23:11,064
ls that a metaphorical title, or did
your brother actually piss on you ?

1297
01:23:11,154 --> 01:23:13,793
l put-- l put everything in the book.

1298
01:23:13,874 --> 01:23:17,105
Everything.
All this is in the book.

1299
01:23:17,194 --> 01:23:21,107
l'll be honest, l have not read
the book because it looks stupid.

1300
01:23:23,634 --> 01:23:26,228
What ?

1301
01:23:26,314 --> 01:23:30,751
l'm just saying maybe we
should start thinking about when
we want to take him off the air.

1302
01:23:30,834 --> 01:23:33,906
Why ? What are you talking
about, take him off the air ?
He just got out of the hospital.

1303
01:23:33,994 --> 01:23:35,825
He's fine. The cat's fine.

1304
01:23:35,914 --> 01:23:38,348
- The ratings are higher than ever.
- Well, you know,

1305
01:23:38,434 --> 01:23:40,629
it's like when you're chewing
gum and blowing a bubble.

1306
01:23:40,714 --> 01:23:42,227
- Good, a metaphor.
- Right.

1307
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:45,863
And the bubble keeps getting bigger
and bigger and you've got to decide.

1308
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:50,948
When do you suck it in ?
Or if you don't, it explodes
and then you've got gum face.

1309
01:23:52,354 --> 01:23:55,664
Cynthia, l started out
as an associate producer...

1310
01:23:55,754 --> 01:23:57,904
on Good Morning Fresno.

1311
01:23:57,994 --> 01:24:02,590
And l didn't get from there to here by
worrying about getting gum in my face.

1312
01:24:04,634 --> 01:24:06,943
All l'm saying is,
l think we've peaked.

1313
01:24:07,034 --> 01:24:10,709
And all l'm saying is, you don't know
your ass from a toboggan.

1314
01:24:10,794 --> 01:24:13,433
We're gonna stay with
the boy for another month.

1315
01:24:13,514 --> 01:24:15,584
- You know how l know l'm right ?
- Mm.

1316
01:24:15,674 --> 01:24:20,031
Because l'm driving the big car,
and you're driving the little car.

1317
01:24:27,034 --> 01:24:30,231
Look, Ed, you put anybody
on television 16 hours a day,

1318
01:24:30,314 --> 01:24:34,023
at some point they're going to wind up
rolling off a table and squashing a cat.

1319
01:24:34,114 --> 01:24:36,947
- Oh, man, that's not my point.
- All right, look.

1320
01:24:37,034 --> 01:24:40,344
With no privacy, there is no dignity.
Capisce ?

1321
01:24:40,434 --> 01:24:43,187
Oh, yeah, nice.

1322
01:24:43,274 --> 01:24:48,473
- Hello. Hello, Mom ?
- Eddie, it's Mom.

1323
01:24:48,554 --> 01:24:51,193
Eddie, l'm in the hospital.

1324
01:24:51,274 --> 01:24:53,424
Mom, Mom, what happened ?

1325
01:24:53,514 --> 01:24:56,074
Eddie, he's dead.

1326
01:24:56,154 --> 01:24:58,588
He's dead.
He had a heart attack.

1327
01:25:02,634 --> 01:25:06,388
Did l tell ya he was gonna die ?
Did l say ? Huh ? Come on.

1328
01:25:10,434 --> 01:25:14,222
Excuse me. l'm looking for my mother.
My name's Ed Pekurny.

1329
01:25:14,314 --> 01:25:18,068
- Mr. Pekurny, l'm Dr. Geller.
- Hi.

1330
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:21,749
Your mother's lying down for a minute.
We gave her something to calm her down.

1331
01:25:21,834 --> 01:25:23,825
Thank you.
Can l see her ?

1332
01:25:23,914 --> 01:25:26,667
Uh, why don't you just give her
a minute ? She'll be right out.

1333
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:29,746
Why don't you sit over here
for a second ?

1334
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:33,588
What happened to him ?
Did he--

1335
01:25:33,674 --> 01:25:35,983
Did he suffer any,
or was it quick ?

1336
01:25:36,074 --> 01:25:37,951
Yeah, it was very quick.

1337
01:25:38,034 --> 01:25:40,468
Between you and me,
it's not a bad way to go.

1338
01:25:40,554 --> 01:25:43,705
- How's that ?
- Making love to your wife.

1339
01:25:43,794 --> 01:25:46,262
lt's very sweet.

1340
01:25:46,354 --> 01:25:50,108
- They were making love
when he had a heart attack ?
- According to your mother.

1341
01:25:50,194 --> 01:25:53,664
Eddie, thank God you're here.

1342
01:25:53,754 --> 01:25:55,984
- How's your mother ?
- Al !

1343
01:25:56,074 --> 01:25:59,510
-What's going on ? Thought he was dead.
-How'd you get here ?

1344
01:25:59,594 --> 01:26:02,154
The neighbors drove me over.
The worst goddamn driver--

1345
01:26:02,234 --> 01:26:04,065
What are you doing here ?

1346
01:26:04,154 --> 01:26:06,793
- Where's Jeanette ?
- l thought you said he was dead ?

1347
01:26:06,874 --> 01:26:08,705
- Who ?
- Al !

1348
01:26:08,794 --> 01:26:12,184
No, no.
The deceased is Henry Pekurny.

1349
01:26:13,834 --> 01:26:15,904
Good twist.

1350
01:26:15,994 --> 01:26:18,030
- This is beautiful. l love this !
- What ?

1351
01:26:18,114 --> 01:26:21,151
Don't you get it ? The mother was
shtupping the ex-husband.

1352
01:26:23,034 --> 01:26:25,150
You thought it was me ?

1353
01:26:25,234 --> 01:26:27,065
Yeah, Al.

1354
01:26:27,154 --> 01:26:29,270
lt was your father, Hank.

1355
01:26:29,354 --> 01:26:34,792
Your mother went to see him, and he
suddenly dropped dead of a heart attack.

1356
01:26:34,874 --> 01:26:37,547
Dr. Geller, Dr. Stack
wants to see you.

1357
01:26:37,634 --> 01:26:40,512
Oh, excuse me.

1358
01:26:43,914 --> 01:26:47,065
Could l have your autograph ?
lt's for my niece.

1359
01:26:49,714 --> 01:26:52,353
Al. How did you, uh--

1360
01:26:52,434 --> 01:26:54,311
The Burkharts drove me over.

1361
01:26:56,434 --> 01:27:00,313
- Are you all right ?
- l'm fine, l--

1362
01:27:00,394 --> 01:27:02,828
Good. l gotta pee.

1363
01:27:02,914 --> 01:27:05,474
Wish me luck.

1364
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:09,786
Hey. Hey, uh-- Oh--

1365
01:27:09,874 --> 01:27:12,069
Mom.

1366
01:27:18,154 --> 01:27:21,305
Geez. What happened, Mom ?

1367
01:27:21,394 --> 01:27:23,225
Eddie, it was horrible.

1368
01:27:23,314 --> 01:27:25,145
- He called me up.
- Who ?

1369
01:27:25,234 --> 01:27:30,388
Hank. He said he wanted to talk to me.
He wanted to apologize for everything.

1370
01:27:30,474 --> 01:27:33,989
l went over to this horrible place
where he was staying, and l--

1371
01:27:34,074 --> 01:27:36,144
l just felt so sorry for him.

1372
01:27:36,234 --> 01:27:40,546
- So you had sex with him ?
- What ?

1373
01:27:40,634 --> 01:27:44,388
The doctor told me you were
having sex. He told me.

1374
01:27:44,474 --> 01:27:46,624
- To you in front of them ?
- Yeah, Mom.

1375
01:27:46,714 --> 01:27:50,150
He assumed Hank was your husband.
You know, common sense.

1376
01:27:50,234 --> 01:27:53,271
- My God ! On TV !
- Mom, why ? How ?

1377
01:27:53,354 --> 01:27:56,187
One thing led to another.

1378
01:27:56,274 --> 01:27:58,868
- He was my husband once.
- But Al is your husband now.

1379
01:27:58,954 --> 01:28:01,422
You think it's been easy
for me all these years ?

1380
01:28:01,514 --> 01:28:03,345
Al can't have sex !

1381
01:28:03,434 --> 01:28:07,393
Apparently neither can Hank, Mom.

1382
01:28:07,474 --> 01:28:11,149
Let's recap this whole thing.
The mother's too good at it, right ?

1383
01:28:11,234 --> 01:28:13,225
Both brothers stink at it.

1384
01:28:13,314 --> 01:28:16,624
The stepfather can't do it at all. And
the father did it, but it killed him.

1385
01:28:16,714 --> 01:28:19,069
How the hell did
this family reproduce ?

1386
01:28:19,154 --> 01:28:22,226
How did they even get here ?

1387
01:28:22,314 --> 01:28:25,784
This is worse than all the daily
tabloid television that exists.

1388
01:28:25,874 --> 01:28:28,547
lsn't the appeal of this show now...

1389
01:28:28,634 --> 01:28:30,943
that everybody's
got a skeleton in their closet ?

1390
01:28:31,034 --> 01:28:32,865
But how many skeletons
can one family have ?

1391
01:28:32,954 --> 01:28:35,184
No, l think our country's saying
we've had enough of this.

1392
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:38,584
Let's get back to the way
TV used to be.

1393
01:28:59,754 --> 01:29:01,631
We are gathered today--

1394
01:29:11,154 --> 01:29:13,031
How ya doin', boy ?

1395
01:29:17,034 --> 01:29:19,867
- How was the service ?
- lt was all right.

1396
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:23,185
His parole officer said
some lovely words,

1397
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:26,072
and once again l was reminded
the end is near.

1398
01:29:26,154 --> 01:29:29,191
Sorry you couldn't
come in, kiddo,

1399
01:29:29,274 --> 01:29:34,587
but for some reason, the family feels
they're not comin' off so well on TV.

1400
01:29:37,034 --> 01:29:41,664
Well... you and Mom are gonna
work things out, aren't ya ?

1401
01:29:41,754 --> 01:29:44,712
l'm movin' out.

1402
01:29:44,794 --> 01:29:48,070
- No, Al. What do you mean,
you're moving out ?
- l'm gonna live with my brother.

1403
01:29:48,154 --> 01:29:52,830
He's not in such good shape as me,
but l'm looking forward
to the pillow fights.

1404
01:29:53,834 --> 01:29:56,632
Hank.

1405
01:29:56,714 --> 01:29:59,023
Hank was always good
with the ladies.

1406
01:29:59,114 --> 01:30:01,105
Always good-lookin'.

1407
01:30:01,194 --> 01:30:04,550
Hell, he's been dead for two days,
he still looks better than me.

1408
01:30:04,634 --> 01:30:09,424
l wanna tell you something, Al.

1409
01:30:09,514 --> 01:30:12,153
You know, Hank, he--

1410
01:30:17,994 --> 01:30:21,031
You're my father, Al.

1411
01:30:45,874 --> 01:30:48,593
Take care of yourself, huh ?

1412
01:30:48,674 --> 01:30:50,949
You know l will.

1413
01:30:59,114 --> 01:31:03,983
l guess it's when...
you know the head, it's, uh,

1414
01:31:04,074 --> 01:31:05,905
different.

1415
01:31:09,554 --> 01:31:12,307
You have done it !
l've had it !

1416
01:31:12,394 --> 01:31:14,624
Hey, Crockett.
Ease up, man.

1417
01:31:14,714 --> 01:31:17,592
Ease up ? He just devoured
my entire Buddy Holly collection !

1418
01:31:17,674 --> 01:31:19,630
What is it with you ?

1419
01:31:19,714 --> 01:31:23,104
How would you like it if somebody
chewed up your personal belongings ?

1420
01:31:23,194 --> 01:31:25,992
See this blanket ?
You see this ?

1421
01:31:26,074 --> 01:31:28,542
Elvis loves this blanket. lt's
his most favorite thing in the whole--

1422
01:31:33,714 --> 01:31:36,626
- Three more months ?
- Yeah, absolutely.

1423
01:31:36,714 --> 01:31:40,707
Ed TV's more popular than ever. The
resurgence in interest is astounding.

1424
01:31:40,794 --> 01:31:43,513
Of course, this means
another big bonus payment for you.

1425
01:31:43,594 --> 01:31:45,903
Yeah ! Whoo-hoo !

1426
01:31:45,994 --> 01:31:49,987
Ed, have you thought about
moving in with your mother ?

1427
01:31:50,074 --> 01:31:54,431
l mean, she's all alone now.
l'm sure she could use your support.

1428
01:32:01,074 --> 01:32:05,113
We're not as dumb
as you people think we are.

1429
01:32:13,034 --> 01:32:17,550
l'm takin' what little dignity
there is left,

1430
01:32:17,634 --> 01:32:19,750
and l quit.

1431
01:32:21,754 --> 01:32:25,110
Yeah. Can somebody
validate my parking ?

1432
01:32:25,194 --> 01:32:27,662
l'm afraid that
that's not possible.

1433
01:32:27,754 --> 01:32:30,222
- Okay, Mr. Big Network.
l'll pay for it myself.
- No.

1434
01:32:30,314 --> 01:32:32,225
l mean, you can't quit.

1435
01:32:32,314 --> 01:32:35,829
The hell l can't.
Look, l just did.

1436
01:32:35,914 --> 01:32:38,951
l know, Ed. But, you see,

1437
01:32:39,034 --> 01:32:42,071
you agreed to stay on the air
as long as we asked you to.

1438
01:32:42,154 --> 01:32:45,112
The station entered into this
with that understanding.

1439
01:32:45,194 --> 01:32:48,743
Now, if you had refused
up front,

1440
01:32:48,834 --> 01:32:51,507
well, we would have done this
with somebody else.

1441
01:32:51,594 --> 01:32:55,667
You can't just change the rules
in the middle of the game, son.

1442
01:32:55,754 --> 01:32:57,585
lt's just not fair.

1443
01:32:57,674 --> 01:33:00,711
Listen, if you don't
let me out of this now,

1444
01:33:00,794 --> 01:33:04,309
l-l-l'm gonna go home,
stick my thumb up my butt,

1445
01:33:04,394 --> 01:33:06,624
sit on my ass
and not do a damn thing.

1446
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:09,069
l won't go anywhere.

1447
01:33:09,154 --> 01:33:12,032
- What kind of show
does that sound like ?
- Uh, not too good.

1448
01:33:12,114 --> 01:33:16,790
- No, not too good.
- That's why it states very
specifically in your contract...

1449
01:33:16,874 --> 01:33:20,389
that if you don't continue
to live a normal life,

1450
01:33:20,474 --> 01:33:24,308
well, then,
you're in breach, see ?

1451
01:33:24,394 --> 01:33:30,071
And you're liable for all the station's
financial losses.

1452
01:34:00,794 --> 01:34:02,785
l'll get this.

1453
01:34:15,994 --> 01:34:17,825
Autograph, please ?

1454
01:34:51,754 --> 01:34:53,949
Ed, come on out !

1455
01:35:02,314 --> 01:35:04,145
Shari.

1456
01:35:04,234 --> 01:35:06,873
Oh, my God.
Move ! Excuse me !

1457
01:35:07,154 --> 01:35:10,783
Whoa, whoa !
Shari ! Shari !

1458
01:35:12,154 --> 01:35:14,384
Watch it. Watch it !

1459
01:35:14,474 --> 01:35:16,942
Who's got the shot ?
Who's got the shot ?

1460
01:35:17,034 --> 01:35:19,594
Just give it to me.
Come on, come on.

1461
01:35:19,674 --> 01:35:22,063
- Come on, he's on the move !
- Go, go, go !

1462
01:35:29,434 --> 01:35:31,265
We got him ! We got him !

1463
01:35:31,354 --> 01:35:33,185
Fire it up.
We're rolling.

1464
01:35:41,594 --> 01:35:43,824
Keep the microwave high, Shecky.

1465
01:35:48,874 --> 01:35:51,024
- Ahh !
- Come on, Carlos !

1466
01:35:51,114 --> 01:35:54,868
- Get up ! Get up !
- Come on, he's getting away.

1467
01:36:11,994 --> 01:36:13,825
Hi. One, please.

1468
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:22,065
Excuse me.

1469
01:36:22,154 --> 01:36:24,304
Hey ! Give me one.

1470
01:36:25,514 --> 01:36:28,233
- l'm looking for a girl, tall--
- Bad wig ?

1471
01:36:28,314 --> 01:36:31,112
- Yeah.
- Theater three. Your ticket.

1472
01:36:36,394 --> 01:36:39,192
- Ohh !
- Watch it ! Watch it !

1473
01:36:41,194 --> 01:36:43,708
Ohh !

1474
01:36:43,794 --> 01:36:46,228
Shari, are you okay ?
l'm sorry. Let me see.

1475
01:36:46,314 --> 01:36:48,032
You okay ?

1476
01:36:48,114 --> 01:36:50,105
Shari !

1477
01:36:59,434 --> 01:37:01,390
Shari ?

1478
01:37:02,714 --> 01:37:05,547
- Shari. lt sounds like you.
- lt's not me.

1479
01:37:05,714 --> 01:37:08,512
- Well, it's not. Now, go away.
- l thought you moved.

1480
01:37:08,594 --> 01:37:11,347
l just came
for my brother's birthday.

1481
01:37:11,434 --> 01:37:15,552
- ln a disguise ?
- l wanted to see you, but l
didn't want you to see me.

1482
01:37:15,634 --> 01:37:19,547
Listen to me.
l know why you left.

1483
01:37:19,634 --> 01:37:21,670
Everyone knows why, Ed.
l told you why.

1484
01:37:21,754 --> 01:37:25,747
No, you said it was because
of the TV, but l don't believe that.

1485
01:37:25,834 --> 01:37:31,431
Look at us. We've been with people
before, and it didn't work out.

1486
01:37:31,514 --> 01:37:34,551
And none of it
was on TV, Shari.

1487
01:37:34,634 --> 01:37:36,465
None of it.

1488
01:37:38,314 --> 01:37:41,192
You and me,

1489
01:37:41,274 --> 01:37:43,310
we've been burned.

1490
01:37:43,394 --> 01:37:46,227
And we're scared.

1491
01:37:48,034 --> 01:37:50,787
That's why you left.

1492
01:37:50,874 --> 01:37:54,150
And that's why...

1493
01:37:55,594 --> 01:37:59,109
l didn't do a damn thing
to stop ya.

1494
01:38:04,554 --> 01:38:06,385
Shari ?

1495
01:38:14,794 --> 01:38:16,705
All right.

1496
01:38:49,194 --> 01:38:52,072
- Ooh ! Ooh !
- l'm sorry.

1497
01:39:14,474 --> 01:39:16,465
- Oh, wow.
- Mm.

1498
01:39:18,314 --> 01:39:21,272
All right, listen.
You stay here.

1499
01:39:21,354 --> 01:39:23,504
l'm leaving.
These guys are coming with me.

1500
01:39:23,594 --> 01:39:26,347
l don't know what l'm gonna do,
but l'm gonna figure something out
so we can be together.

1501
01:39:26,434 --> 01:39:28,709
- Okay ?
- Okay.

1502
01:39:39,034 --> 01:39:40,945
Let's go, guys.

1503
01:39:41,034 --> 01:39:43,423
No, Mike. Follow Shari.

1504
01:39:44,914 --> 01:39:46,791
Mike, Shecky, come on.

1505
01:39:48,394 --> 01:39:52,387
Mike, Shecky, l'm leaving.
You're supposed to follow me. Let's go.

1506
01:40:02,794 --> 01:40:05,672
Give him room, people.
Give him room.

1507
01:40:07,274 --> 01:40:10,744
- Hi, Ed.
- Why the hell are they
still followin' Shari ?

1508
01:40:10,834 --> 01:40:13,348
lt's their new concept.
Since--

1509
01:40:13,434 --> 01:40:15,823
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1510
01:40:15,914 --> 01:40:18,712
What's going on ?
Why is my family on TV ?

1511
01:40:18,794 --> 01:40:21,262
Like l was saying,
it's a new concept.

1512
01:40:21,354 --> 01:40:24,073
Since Shari and your family
all signed releases,

1513
01:40:24,154 --> 01:40:26,748
we're allowed to follow them on camera
even though you're not with them.

1514
01:40:26,834 --> 01:40:31,510
So we go with whoever's the most
exciting. And right now, look.

1515
01:40:31,594 --> 01:40:35,985
See, it's you and--
Oh, me.

1516
01:40:36,074 --> 01:40:38,747
- You can't do this.
- l'm not a lawyer.

1517
01:40:38,834 --> 01:40:41,189
l'm just a guy who eats
three meals a day in this truck.

1518
01:40:41,274 --> 01:40:43,788
We gotta get them off the air.
This is not part of the deal.

1519
01:40:43,874 --> 01:40:46,991
l don't give a goddamn.
Make the call, man.

1520
01:40:47,074 --> 01:40:52,228
- Make the call. Get 'em off.
- Look, Ed, this is--

1521
01:40:54,954 --> 01:40:58,549
- Ed ! Ed, come on !
- Ed, if you break the truck--

1522
01:40:58,634 --> 01:41:02,866
lf you break the truck, they'll
charge you for it. They'll have
a new one here in 15 minutes.

1523
01:41:02,954 --> 01:41:05,673
Ten.

1524
01:41:05,754 --> 01:41:08,393
Come on, Ed.
This is crazy.

1525
01:41:08,474 --> 01:41:12,626
Hey, hey.
They got ya, man.

1526
01:41:12,714 --> 01:41:14,864
Just... go home.

1527
01:41:14,954 --> 01:41:17,309
Go home, Gomer !

1528
01:41:18,874 --> 01:41:21,024
Ed, this is crazy.
Come on.

1529
01:41:31,674 --> 01:41:33,505
You know what ?

1530
01:41:38,354 --> 01:41:40,231
They're right.

1531
01:41:41,994 --> 01:41:43,825
This is a great idea.

1532
01:41:43,914 --> 01:41:46,553
My family is interesting.

1533
01:41:46,634 --> 01:41:48,511
Hell, look at 'em.

1534
01:41:50,194 --> 01:41:53,470
But everybody's interesting, right ?

1535
01:41:53,554 --> 01:41:58,344
l bet you that wacky little group
that owns this network...

1536
01:41:58,434 --> 01:42:00,265
that l had the meeting with,

1537
01:42:00,354 --> 01:42:03,426
l bet they're pretty goddamn interesting
too, don't you think ?

1538
01:42:03,514 --> 01:42:07,029
Huh ? l'll bet they are.

1539
01:42:13,554 --> 01:42:18,708
Yeah. l oughta loosen up
a little bit, shouldn't l ?

1540
01:42:18,794 --> 01:42:21,831
Let's have a little fun
with this thing.

1541
01:42:21,914 --> 01:42:26,704
Let's really blow it out. Let's, let's
have-- Let's have a contest.

1542
01:42:26,794 --> 01:42:29,103
Who can dig up...

1543
01:42:29,194 --> 01:42:32,072
the most embarrassing and humiliating
information on any of the executives...

1544
01:42:32,154 --> 01:42:36,386
of the Northwest Broadcast Company,
which owns this station, True TV.

1545
01:42:36,474 --> 01:42:39,034
After all, why should anyone...

1546
01:42:39,114 --> 01:42:40,991
have any privacy, right ?

1547
01:42:41,074 --> 01:42:43,269
So l want anything...

1548
01:42:43,354 --> 01:42:46,073
from their past, their present,
business, personal, you name it.

1549
01:42:46,154 --> 01:42:47,985
lf it's dirty and true,
we want it.

1550
01:42:48,074 --> 01:42:50,907
Whoever brings the sleaziest
and most degrading...

1551
01:42:50,994 --> 01:42:54,703
material to me,
l'm gonna pay you...

1552
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:57,262
$10,000.

1553
01:42:57,354 --> 01:42:59,868
Yeah, Eddie !
l love this guy !

1554
01:42:59,954 --> 01:43:02,229
And tonight at 9:00,
l'll announce...

1555
01:43:02,314 --> 01:43:04,305
the big winner, all right ?

1556
01:43:04,394 --> 01:43:07,113
Now, you're gonna need
my home number.

1557
01:43:07,194 --> 01:43:09,583
Call me anytime.

1558
01:43:09,674 --> 01:43:12,393
And if you get in right now,
l'm gonna throw in a bonus.

1559
01:43:12,474 --> 01:43:14,829
You're gonna get a free book
by author Ray Pekurny...

1560
01:43:14,914 --> 01:43:17,906
titled "My Brother
Pissed on Me."

1561
01:43:17,994 --> 01:43:20,554
All right, America.
Come on, baby. Let's start diggin'.

1562
01:43:20,634 --> 01:43:23,831
- This is ridiculous.
- How can this be legal ?

1563
01:43:23,914 --> 01:43:26,747
- lt's defamation. lt's slander.
- Not technically,

1564
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:29,632
because he is not showing
reckless disregard for the truth.

1565
01:43:29,714 --> 01:43:31,830
- Oh, come on !
- What are you saying ?

1566
01:43:31,914 --> 01:43:34,826
- At 9:00 he can say
whatever he wants about us ?
- That is ridiculous.

1567
01:43:34,914 --> 01:43:37,428
There has got to be some way
we can shut this hillbilly up.

1568
01:43:37,514 --> 01:43:40,028
- Hey, l've got a idea.
- What ?

1569
01:43:40,114 --> 01:43:42,150
Let's not shut him up.

1570
01:43:42,234 --> 01:43:45,112
Let's get him to push it to Sunday
when the audience is bigger,

1571
01:43:45,194 --> 01:43:48,948
promote it for the next
five days, really hype it
because it's a rating's grabber,

1572
01:43:49,034 --> 01:43:51,594
which is all that counts,
so run with it.

1573
01:43:51,674 --> 01:43:54,142
You were right, l was wrong.

1574
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:56,668
See, Ed TV is going
to be bigger than ever.

1575
01:43:56,754 --> 01:43:59,826
Cynthia, another word
and you may consider yourself fired.

1576
01:43:59,914 --> 01:44:02,474
Uh-oh.
Can you give me a hint ?

1577
01:44:02,554 --> 01:44:04,943
What word ?
Um, "asshole" ?

1578
01:44:06,474 --> 01:44:09,989
"Shithead" ? l bet that--
ls that one word or two ?

1579
01:44:10,074 --> 01:44:12,542
l never can remember that.

1580
01:44:12,634 --> 01:44:14,465
"Shithead." Anyway, listen.

1581
01:44:14,554 --> 01:44:18,866
lt has been a real pleasure
workin' for ya. l have loved it.

1582
01:44:18,954 --> 01:44:21,752
Loved it, loved it,
loved it, loved it, loved it.

1583
01:44:21,834 --> 01:44:23,267
Loved it !

1584
01:44:23,354 --> 01:44:27,427
He didn't tip you ?
Maybe you're not hot.

1585
01:44:27,514 --> 01:44:29,630
Yeah. Uh--

1586
01:44:29,714 --> 01:44:32,353
l gotta go.
My brother's here.

1587
01:44:41,114 --> 01:44:45,949
Look, we gotta settle this.

1588
01:44:49,194 --> 01:44:52,391
Well, all right, man.

1589
01:44:54,514 --> 01:44:59,269
- They're gonna fight.
- Maybe they'll kill each other.
That's at least an ending.

1590
01:45:08,274 --> 01:45:10,549
Okay, settled.

1591
01:45:10,634 --> 01:45:12,670
Yeah, great.

1592
01:45:12,754 --> 01:45:15,587
- Oh, that's it ?
- What was that ?

1593
01:45:15,674 --> 01:45:20,225
Some kind of brotherly--
Southern brotherly thing.

1594
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:23,112
Here you go. You weren't gonna swing,
were ya ? Were you ready to swing ?

1595
01:45:23,194 --> 01:45:25,025
l was ready to throw there.

1596
01:45:25,114 --> 01:45:27,833
You know, good thing l was here.

1597
01:45:27,914 --> 01:45:30,064
You got all kinds of calls.

1598
01:45:33,994 --> 01:45:37,111
This is not good.
This is not a good thing.

1599
01:45:37,194 --> 01:45:39,754
Would 40 of these kill me ?

1600
01:45:42,514 --> 01:45:45,631
What if we compromised ?
Asked him to stay on two more weeks,

1601
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:48,467
and then kick him off.

1602
01:45:48,554 --> 01:45:50,545
Ah, phone.

1603
01:45:50,634 --> 01:45:54,263
Here we go. Hello.

1604
01:45:54,354 --> 01:45:56,788
- ls this Ed ?
- Yes, it is. Who's this ?

1605
01:45:56,874 --> 01:46:00,025
l've got some information for you.
Better than anything you've got.

1606
01:46:00,114 --> 01:46:01,593
Okay, l'm here.

1607
01:46:01,674 --> 01:46:06,065
l got this from one of the secretaries
that works at the network.

1608
01:46:06,154 --> 01:46:08,827
Got a little blitzed
at the Christmas party.

1609
01:46:08,914 --> 01:46:12,589
Listen carefully.
l'm only gonna say this once...

1610
01:46:12,674 --> 01:46:15,586
'cause talking this way
is really hurting my throat.

1611
01:46:15,674 --> 01:46:18,791
Can anyone see
what he's writing ?

1612
01:46:18,874 --> 01:46:24,073
"Duck" ? Did anybody do anything
with a duck ?

1613
01:46:24,154 --> 01:46:27,510
Jesus ! l'd hate to be stuck
in a foxhole with this group.

1614
01:46:27,594 --> 01:46:30,870
- There's not a full-grown
pair of testicles among you.
- Uh, sir, l--

1615
01:46:30,954 --> 01:46:34,424
Whatever little embarrassments
he comes up with, we'll spin it.

1616
01:46:34,514 --> 01:46:38,393
This guy is gonna stay on TV
until he dies.

1617
01:46:38,474 --> 01:46:41,113
Relax !

1618
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:47,353
Okay. Yes, l got it.
Thank you.

1619
01:46:49,274 --> 01:46:52,311
- Well ?
- l think we've got a winner.

1620
01:46:52,394 --> 01:46:54,271
- Uh, Rayford ?
- Ho !

1621
01:46:54,354 --> 01:46:56,948
- Well, 9:00 yet ?
- 9:01.

1622
01:46:57,034 --> 01:46:59,753
9:01. Got it. Okay.

1623
01:46:59,834 --> 01:47:03,190
l don't know how many of you out there
are paying attention right now,

1624
01:47:03,274 --> 01:47:06,232
but for those of you who are,
l think we just got the winner.

1625
01:47:06,314 --> 01:47:09,511
Whoo !

1626
01:47:12,994 --> 01:47:15,349
How many of you know...

1627
01:47:15,434 --> 01:47:18,073
what a penile implant is ?

1628
01:47:25,194 --> 01:47:28,743
As it's explained to me, what happens
is you got two cylinders: one, two.

1629
01:47:28,834 --> 01:47:32,622
And they are inserted
into the shaft.

1630
01:47:32,714 --> 01:47:34,784
Oh !

1631
01:47:34,874 --> 01:47:38,230
Now, to get an erection,
what this man does is...

1632
01:47:38,314 --> 01:47:41,431
he squeezes his pump,
and it forces a fluid...

1633
01:47:41,514 --> 01:47:44,074
that goes in the cylinders
into the shaft.

1634
01:47:46,634 --> 01:47:48,590
Voila, you've got your stiffie.

1635
01:47:49,914 --> 01:47:53,270
You're good to go.
So, who's this lucky guy ?

1636
01:47:53,354 --> 01:47:57,188
l mean, who is this true
TV executive who can now get
his Johnson to head north...

1637
01:47:57,274 --> 01:47:58,946
anytime he wants ?

1638
01:47:59,034 --> 01:48:00,945
l'm gonna tell you
who the lucky man is right now.

1639
01:48:01,034 --> 01:48:02,831
- Tell us, brother !
- All right.

1640
01:48:03,874 --> 01:48:05,592
Here we go.

1641
01:48:05,674 --> 01:48:07,790
The man of the hour is Mr.--

1642
01:48:09,594 --> 01:48:11,824
Whoo !

1643
01:48:12,554 --> 01:48:14,863
True TV regrets to inform
our audience that...

1644
01:48:14,954 --> 01:48:19,311
due to circumstances beyond our control,
Ed TV will no longer be presented.

1645
01:48:19,394 --> 01:48:21,464
Whoo !

1646
01:48:23,834 --> 01:48:26,064
Yeah ! Oh, yeah !

1647
01:48:26,154 --> 01:48:30,227
- Who's the guy with the phony--
- What do they expect us to do now ?

1648
01:48:34,514 --> 01:48:37,586
Look, l don't know who
he was talkin' about.

1649
01:48:37,674 --> 01:48:40,313
l don't even know
whether or not it was true.

1650
01:48:40,394 --> 01:48:44,387
But he was about to name
one of you, and l'll be damned...

1651
01:48:44,474 --> 01:48:47,546
if l'll have one of my people
humiliated on public--

1652
01:48:47,634 --> 01:48:51,627
l mean, not that there's anything to be
embarrassed about, if it's true.

1653
01:48:51,714 --> 01:48:56,993
The point is, it's a normal
medical-- What the hell are you
lookin' at, you redheaded putz ?

1654
01:49:00,154 --> 01:49:03,351
Pack it up and go on home now.
Leave me in peace.

1655
01:49:05,514 --> 01:49:06,708
Don't come back now, you hear ?

1656
01:49:06,794 --> 01:49:09,308
Well...

1657
01:49:09,394 --> 01:49:12,625
back to infomercials.

1658
01:49:12,714 --> 01:49:15,831
- Hey, l'm on TV ! Look at me !
- Hi, Mom !

1659
01:49:23,914 --> 01:49:27,589
So Ed is no longer on TV.
Sam, how did he make out ?

1660
01:49:27,674 --> 01:49:31,349
Ed made out like a bandit.
A spokesperson for True TV...

1661
01:49:31,434 --> 01:49:33,994
announced that Ed received a check
covering his four months on the air,

1662
01:49:34,074 --> 01:49:37,749
his balloon payment,
and an additional bonus...

1663
01:49:37,834 --> 01:49:41,588
to show the network's
appreciation for all his, quote,

1664
01:49:41,674 --> 01:49:45,189
"hard work and loyalty," unquote.

1665
01:49:45,274 --> 01:49:48,789
When asked exactly what happened,
a True TV spokesperson said,

1666
01:49:48,874 --> 01:49:53,072
they had no official comment,
but that things had been worked out.

1667
01:50:12,234 --> 01:50:17,388
Okay, let's do a final, uh--
Perhaps say good-bye here to Ed TV.

1668
01:50:17,474 --> 01:50:20,625
- Have we seen the last of Ed,
do you think ?
- l would think so.

1669
01:50:20,714 --> 01:50:22,545
Five years, no one
will remember who he is.

1670
01:50:22,634 --> 01:50:26,912
- Five years ? Six months.
He's a macarena.
- lt's Ed Free TV now.
