1
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:18,900
Sprits who around us dwell,

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,203
neither in heaven, nor in hell,

3
00:00:22,304 --> 00:00:25,975
I beseech you, show yourself,

4
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:28,678
but let me introduce myself.

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,315
Okay, I got some
low-frequency recordings already.

6
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:34,418
Okay. Oh, it's cold down here.

7
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:35,629
It's very cold.

8
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:36,721
Sasquatch weather.

9
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:38,456
It's not sasquatch weather.

10
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:40,892
We are
ascending the stairs

11
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:44,430
of the Publooski-
Pallooski... house.

12
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:47,065
This is very haunted.

13
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,868
There's a lot of energy
around here.

14
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:53,240
I am the Medium
Madame Lidnar the medium!

15
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:57,678
Not some sweatsuit punk
with techie tedium!

16
00:00:57,778 --> 00:00:59,548
Are your headphones too small?
Do they fit?

17
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,559
- Mine are... a little tight.
- Um, yeah, they're snug.

18
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,151
- Comfortable.
- Oh, my gosh.

19
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:06,589
Okay. Did you hear that?

20
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,289
That sounded like that
could be a spirit.

21
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:10,427
Is, uh, is anybody here?

22
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:11,795
I'm here!

23
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:13,764
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
There's someone here!

24
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:15,065
That was definitely a spirit!

25
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:16,800
Oh, my gosh.

26
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,503
This is intense stuff, Kourtney.

27
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:19,938
If you need to, you can hold me.

28
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:20,939
It's okay.

29
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,940
Um, I'm fine. Thanks.

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,976
I have no reservations

31
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:26,045
chanting incantations!

32
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:29,115
Like Kissinger,
I wow the nations!

33
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,885
Like David Bowie,
go Station to Station!

34
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,321
- Sounds like a sasquatch!
- It's not a sasquatch!

35
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:37,024
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

36
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:38,135
Okay, guy! Guys!

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,828
Ignore the hucksters,

38
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:43,098
and the girl

39
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:46,134
speak to us
from the spirit world.

40
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:48,448
There's something here.
That was definitely a spirit.

41
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:52,976
Guys, hold it together.

42
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:54,244
Okay, if you're here,

43
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:56,280
just, you know,
speak up, or something.

44
00:01:57,715 --> 00:01:58,883
What are you doing?!

45
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,762
You could
be a little more professional.

46
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,320
I'm gonna go downstairs.

47
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:04,122
Don't tell the guys.

48
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:07,694
Get out of my house!

49
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,156
That was definitely a spirit!
Definitely a spirit!

50
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,466
Where's the lights?!

51
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,814
- Hey!
- I can't even hear my music, Mom.

52
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:25,948
Be the grown-up.

53
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:27,058
If you guys
aren't gonna talk with me,

54
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:28,317
I get to play my music.

55
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:31,330
I still don't see why
you couldn't've gotten a job

56
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:32,354
in Spring Lake.

57
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:34,691
I looked for six months.
The market...

58
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,894
- Take off your earphones!
- Whatever!

59
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:39,997
Did you know that Chicago was
the birthplace of the skyscraper?

60
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:41,943
I'm not gonna know anyone
at Oak Park High School.

61
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:45,170
The proper name is Oak
Park and River Forest High School.

62
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,373
Its graduates
include Ernest Hemingway,

63
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:49,576
and TV personality,
Thomas Lennon.

64
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:52,111
Amanda, this is an opportunity,
not a punishment.

65
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:53,881
You're really
gonna like Oak Park.

66
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:56,216
A few miles west in...
Oak Park,

67
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:59,078
Frank Lloyd Wright was inventing
the Prairie School of Architecture...

It's "see ya later."

You have to come back

00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:12,269
Amanda!

74
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,139
Mother, Amanda is at a crucial
point of teenage vulnerability.

75
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,076
The handsome
quarterback boyfriend,

00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:21,379
the endless drama among
members of the cheer squad...

This is her whole world.

Oak Park may as well
be a new planet.

79
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:26,919
Amanda's trepidation
is quite real

80
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,988
and probably justified.

81
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:32,058
Not sure whether to thank you
or tell you to shut up, Adam.

82
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,038
Your brother's just
lookin' out for you, Amanda.

83
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:37,064
And Amanda, be
mindful of Mom's predicament.

84
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:39,044
She searched for suitable work
in West Michigan,

85
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,768
but found no marketing positions

00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,749

their joint checking account,

00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:52,115
Mother wisely did not see

92
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:54,384
Walmart greeter
as a long-term option.

93
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,130
So it's perfectly sensible

94
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,923
for her to resort
to taking a job

95
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:00,892

all the best local stores,

123
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,756
grocers, hardware...

00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,758
Honey, I think they know
how to read.

00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,429
Right, well...

126
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,764
Second...

127
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,266
I have a can of beans.

128
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,202
An organic squash.

What did you do?

00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:15,923
You know, they say many

are haunted...

175
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,328
You knock on my window,
then you mess with my stuff,

176
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,730
then you come in here
tryin' to act all innocent...

00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,902
- What?
- A strange visage in the window!

179
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,505
A face! I swear to you,
I'm not making this up!

180
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:31,607
I don't see a face,
you little liar.

181
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:32,907
I don't know how you did that,

182
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:35,847
but quit trying to mess with me!

183
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:07,249
Adam, why'd you
move my picture of Taylor?

184
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:08,349
Huh?

185
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:10,562
My picture of Taylor.
You turned it face-down.

186
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:12,122
I did nothing of the sort.

187
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:13,456
Perhaps it fell.

188
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,893
Just don't touch my stuff!

189
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:27,639
♪

190
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:45,060
♪

191
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,588
So, what was
the primary motivation

192
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:11,758
for the US to go to war
with Great Britain

193
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,093
in 1812?

194
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:17,031
It had to do with the British
support of he Native Americans.

195
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:19,233
What would Andrew Jackson
have to say?

196
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,701
"This is not acceptable."

197
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:23,939
Why would anyone
fight over Ohio?

198
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,741
Two words, "Cedar Point."

199
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:56,176
Hi.

200
00:10:57,044 --> 00:10:58,044
Hi.

201
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,495
Here it is, B-105.

202
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,163
Thank you, Isabelle.

203
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:16,099
So kindly of you
to show me to my classroom.

204
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,701
Shall I see you at lunch, then?

205
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,037
I guess so.

206
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,371
See ya.

207
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:44,166
Don't forget
there's a quiz Tuesday,

208
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:47,203
so please continue Chapter Four!

209
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:51,174
Hey, you're that new girl
from Michigan, right?

210
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:52,508
- Yeah.
- This is Dominic.

211
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,978
- Hey.
- My name's Edgar, but everyone calls me Squatchie.

212
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,680
Wanna hang out with us
after school?

213
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,517
Um... sorry,
everyone calls you what?

214
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:00,651
Squatchie.

215
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,164
This is my third year taking
a class with Miss Mercer,

216
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:04,365
so I know all her quirks
and stuff, so

217
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,593
if you ever need help
solving her, I'm here for you.

218
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,495
So, you wanna hang out today
after school?

219
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,897
Um...

220
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,432
I-I'm sorry, I can't.

221
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,434
I-I mean, I can't
hang out with you.

222
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,169
I mean, no... God, sorry...

223
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,905
Uh... I just...
I don't know you.

224
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,840
No problem, Mandy. Another time.

225
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:33,089
Missing everything
by The Clash and The Ramones.

226
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:35,092
I can't find In the City
by The Jam, either.

227
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:37,528
What are you talking about?
I listen to music on my phone.

228
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:38,895
Who did this?!

229
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:40,808
I don't care how well you're
doing at school, young man,

230
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:42,434
no more pranks.

231
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:43,701
What the...

232
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:45,103
Did you guys do this?

233
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,240
I didn't do this.

234
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,707
All right, uh...

235
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:49,807
Back up.

236
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,646
Back up. Let's get out of here.

237
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:02,990
We searched the whole house.

238
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,661
Uh, no sign
of forced entry anywhere.,

239
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:06,928
no intruders present,

240
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:09,165
and nothing obviously missing.

241
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:10,600
Thanks, Dave.

242
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,901
Ma'am, again,

243
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,679
it looks like some teenagers
got into your house

244
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:15,104
and they had themselves
some fun.

245
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:17,808
All right, ma'am, did you go
to Oak Park High School?

246
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:19,843
No, I'm not from here. Why?

247
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,180
Is this your old yearbook?

248
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,082
- No.
- Hmm.

249
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:25,484
No prints on it.

250
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:26,485
None.

251
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:28,554
I can't find prints
on any of this mess.

252
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,055
So, what does that mean?

253
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,692
Teenage vandals wore gloves
so as not to leave prints

254
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,661
an my beer bottles
and old records?

255
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:36,363
That seems far-fetched.

256
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:38,399
I agree with you, ma'am.

257
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,935
Here's something else
that's a bit off.

258
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:43,271
I found this pipe
with all the cigarette butts.

259
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:45,773
- Marijuana pipe?
- No, Sir.

260
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:47,976
The residue is tobacco,
not marijuana,

261
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:49,645
and I don't know
any teenage pothead

262
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,483
who smokes from
a 1914 Romanic Model 11.

263
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,453
Ma'am, is this
a family heirloom?

264
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:59,357
No, I-I've never seen a...

265
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:01,792
Adam, have you ever seen
a pipe like this before?

266
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:02,993
No.

267
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,297
Well, unless it's
a very clever fake,

268
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:07,799
this was made
by the Romanic Pipe Company

269
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,301
in Johnstown, Pennsylvania,

270
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:12,239
between 1898 and 1919.

271
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,873
If I had to bet

272
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:15,442
it's a 1914.

273
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:17,410
So, what are you sayin'?

274
00:14:18,346 --> 00:14:19,213
It was someone
from the Antiques Roadshow

275
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:22,115
broke in and drank
Mrs. Pallooski's liquor?

276
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:23,385
Poplawski.

277
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:24,786
Sorry, Poplawski.

278
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:26,521
But I'm thinkin'
of going back to Jensen.

279
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:27,689
I don't know.

280
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,759
No fingerprints on anything,

281
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:32,161
a vintage pipe
no one's seen before...

282
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,264
So, again, ma'am,
we'll check back with you.

283
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:35,466
Okay?

284
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:37,468
In the mean time,
here's my card.

285
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:38,848
Let us know if anything happens,

286
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:41,573
or if you wanna talk about
the community, or whatever,

287
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:42,774
give me a call.

288
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:44,175
Thank you.

289
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:45,276
Come on.

290
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,112
Take care, little pal.

Not today.

Oh...

300

You'll find the Rico in South 2B

301
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,469
is friendlier about paper jams.

302
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:37,103
This baby's temperamental.

303
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,081
She likes me, though.
I'll take care of this for ya.

Used to be Carol Jensen

Hey, cousy-girl?

00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:00,831
Uh, marketing.
Actually, I'm in marketing.

316
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:04,001
Right, marketing, sales,
whatev-skis!

317
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:06,171
You generate some buckage,

318
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:08,674
and my crew in AR will
collect it and count it, baby

Pow!

I got this, Carolicious!

322
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,554
Squatchie?

323
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:21,655
For real?

324
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,792
His real name's like Egbert,
or something,

325
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:26,361
but he was like, "Yeah,
everyone calls me Squatchie."

326
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:28,029
And he's really hairy.

327
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,533
- Weird.
- So where's Taylor and Cody?

328
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:32,835
I thought we were all gonna
hang out together on Skype.

329
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:36,339
Um... I dunno.

330
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,942
Cody's, like, pissed at me,
or something, so...

331
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,912
Anyway, I told him,
"Don't bother."

332
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:43,347
Then Taylor, um...

333
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:44,982
Taylor, yeah.

334
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:46,552
I saw him at school,

335
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:49,087
and he was like, "Yeah,
I have football real late."

336
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:50,789
Or something.

337
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:52,358
Is someone there with you?

338
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:53,560
What? No.

339
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:56,996
Okay, uh... Tell me about cheer.

340
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:59,066
Emma's totally
drama queen of the week.

341
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,206
So we were in gym, right,
and Mr. Majors' just like,

342
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:03,904
"Okay, badminton."
and then he pairs us all off.

343
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:05,574
Well, so we're all like,
"Whatever."

344
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:07,609
But then, Emma's just like...

345
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:25,864
Amanda?

346
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:27,699
Adam?

347
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:32,237
Adam, stop bangin' around!

348
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,719
I'm right here, Mother.

349
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:46,120
How did you...

350
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,690
Were you in the basement
just now?

351
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,625
No, I came
from the second floor.

352
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:50,725
Is dinner ready?

353
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:52,361
Where's your sister?

354
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:54,564
Second floor,
if I'm not mistaken.

more to do with spirits

- Haunted?

- Her yogurt was beyond the expiration date.

483
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,620

484
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,556
Oh, I didn't say "goose ghost"

485
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:01,658

You know?

486
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:04,162

Well, it doesn't matter
what your mommy's considering,

517
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,090
because this
is the Ecto-bagger X.

518
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,261
What is the X for?

519
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,462
Well, you see, you put an X

520
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,664
on anything
you want to sound cooler.

521
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:33,966

522
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:37,803
Would you rather get your
molars rayed or X-rayed?

523
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,807
Do you wanna post embarrassing
videos of your boyfriend

524
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,177
or your ex-boyfriend?

525
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:45,379
Do you wanna be a convict
or an ex-convict?

526
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:48,516
Okay, so the X
is to enhance the name,

527
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:52,988
but what, precisely,
is an Ecto-bagger?

528
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:55,024
How perceptive, little man.

529
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:56,759
These are phony punks

530
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:00,130
with useless gizmos
and goofy gadgets.

531
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,441
How much of your money
have they taken?

532
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:02,632
Maybe closing your eyes

533
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:04,435
and whispering random gibberish
to yourself

534
00:26:04,535 --> 00:26:06,104
works for you, Madame Lidnar,

535
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:07,414
but we'll take
our state-of-the-art

536
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:10,042
paranormal detection technology
any day of the week.

537
00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:11,743
We are ectoplasmic...

538
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:12,644
Scientists.

539
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:13,645
Okay...

540
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:16,316
Yeah, we're not stuck
in the'70s.

541
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:17,484
Where did you come from?

542
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:20,187
A Stevie Nicks
look-alike contest?

543
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,356
So you guys know each other.

544
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,358
Oh, we go way back.

545
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,495
I still haven't recovered
from the Lincoln Park séance

546
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:30,299
where these idiots
unleashed a poltergeist

547
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:33,903
that scared that woman's
Aunt Mildred to the Other Side.

548
00:26:34,003 --> 00:26:35,871
Your ouija board
broke my camcorder.

549
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,308
Yeah, and your sweaty
crystal ball

550
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:40,577
- gave Z-Dog a concussion!
- Ow!

551
00:26:40,677 --> 00:26:42,713
And it wasn't enough
that they had to interfere

552
00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:44,014
with my life's work

553
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:46,518
and steal my customers,

554
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:49,287
but they stole the best
intern I ever had.

555
00:26:53,326 --> 00:26:54,693
Madame Lidnar?

556
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:57,062
You've taught me so much,

557
00:26:57,163 --> 00:26:59,666
but it's time for me
to take on new challenges.

558
00:26:59,766 --> 00:27:02,302
Plus, I'm trying to save money
for grad school,

559
00:27:02,402 --> 00:27:04,672
and you don't pay me.

560
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:06,807
My dear sweet Kourtney

561
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:08,276
you're such a bright talent!

562
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,446
With a few more years
of apprenticeship

563
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,414
you could become my equal!

564
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:15,251
Medium Madame Kourtney
the Medium.

565
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:16,853
Well, I'm resigning

566
00:27:16,953 --> 00:27:19,856
and joining the Super
Paranormal Investigation Team.

567
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:21,591
They already gave me
this warm-up jacket.

568
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:23,727
Seriously, sorry you guys
don't get along,

569
00:27:23,827 --> 00:27:26,464
but is anyone going to deal
with our ghost problems?

570
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:27,798
We're already on it.

571
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:30,335
Madame Lidnar, since you are
already on the first floor,

572
00:27:30,435 --> 00:27:32,304
you can stay here and do

573
00:27:32,404 --> 00:27:34,374
whatever it is that you do.

574
00:27:34,474 --> 00:27:35,941
That leaves us the other two.

575
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,977
We get the top floor
and the basement,

576
00:27:38,077 --> 00:27:41,448
where our clients
already reported activity.

577
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:42,983
Zak, Zeke, Z-Dog,

578
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,618
you guys get the basement.

579
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:47,889
Kourtney and I
will take the top floor.

580
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:49,991
- Okay.
- Great.

581
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:51,927
- Yeah. Great.
- All right.

582
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:53,128
Headsets on.

583
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:54,697
Headsets on.

584
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,265
ACRX on.

585
00:27:56,365 --> 00:27:58,368
Audio Recorder X on.

586
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,536
CCRX on.

587
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,804
Camcorder X on.

588
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:04,442
And the EBX is still on as it
has been on this entire time,

589
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:07,011
because I don't know
how to turn it off.

590
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:09,347
SPIT Team, are you ready?

591
00:28:11,082 --> 00:28:13,051
I suspect these fellows
are frauds.

592
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:14,920
I must keep an eye on them.

593
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:19,459
Now, we wanna
make the environment more welcoming

594
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,763
so the spirits will feel
comfortable chatting with us.

595
00:28:22,863 --> 00:28:26,300
Let's light some candles
and put on some soothing music.

596
00:28:31,306 --> 00:28:34,477
I am receiving strong vibrations

597
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:36,679
of a spirit presence.

598
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,314
I'm getting...

599
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:39,816
There's someone here.

600
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:43,987
Get out of my house!

601
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,067
You could be
a little more professional.

602
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:49,126
- I'm gonna go downstairs.
- Okay... um...

603
00:28:50,194 --> 00:28:51,596
Don't tell the guys.

604
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,193
Okay, well let's go then.
Let's just go!

605
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:05,112
So, Carolicious,

606
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:06,881
it's been delightful

607
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:09,116
learning all about Spring Lake
and your kids,

608
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:11,320
and your mean old ex-husband...

609
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,701
But I gotta say the whole thing
about you carrying a torch

610
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:17,093
all these years for a kid
you new in summer camp...

611
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:20,129
That kinda creeps me out.

612
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:21,364
Last thing I need

613
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:24,101
is another psycho chick
sayin' some other dude's name.

614
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:25,503
You know?

615
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:26,870
No offense, but

616
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,408
there'll be no tour
of Crib à la Barry

617
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:30,609
esta noche.

618
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:31,776
What?

619
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:33,989
There was no way I was goin'
to your apartment tonight.

620
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:35,481
Right.

621
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:36,949
Whatev-skis.

622
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:40,086
This ten spot oughtta cover me.

623
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:42,188
See ya at work. Pow.

624
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:53,369
I felt strong spirit vibrations,

625
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:56,372
but I wasn't actually able
to have a chat.

626
00:29:56,472 --> 00:29:58,141
It was like the spirit
said to me,

627
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:00,344
"Medium Madame Lidnar,

628
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:03,781
I would like nothing more
than to have a nice chatty-chat,

629
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:07,518
but we can't because there are
too many people buzzing about!

630
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:09,888
Was the spirit actually
saying this to you?

631
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:12,824
Well, we wed never able
to actually have the chat,

632
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,293
you know, because there was
all this activity going on.

633
00:30:15,394 --> 00:30:17,964
My basement crew picked up
some actual readings

634
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:20,800
with our GED and the ACRX.

635
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,470
Z-Dog, roll the tape.

636
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,947
Is anybody there?

637
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:24,605
Kaboom.

638
00:30:24,705 --> 00:30:26,106
I'm here!

639
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:27,709
- - Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!
- Definitely a spirit!

640
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:31,489
That's our ghost!
That's a ghost!

641
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:34,283
That's a real live
dead sassa-frassa ghost!

642
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:35,785
We got a ghost!

643
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:37,319
- - Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!
- Definitely a spirit!

644
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,292
"Diss Cossack spunk rules"?

645
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:46,197
"This Cossack's bunk rules."

646
00:30:46,297 --> 00:30:48,366
Uh, your ghost is a Cossack?

647
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:50,735
Or a sasquatch.
Seriously, you guys.

648
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:53,572
I-I think the ghost said...

649
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:56,809
"Disco sucks... punk rules."

650
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:58,153
- Now that's just ridiculous.
- I don't think so.

651
00:30:58,177 --> 00:30:59,617
You know what, people?
I've got this.

652
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:01,548
I've got this.

653
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:03,349
Give us a sign!

654
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,219
Wait! Wait!
There's a sign on your back.

655
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:09,730
Will you please turn that down?

656
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:11,202
We're trying to figure out
this sign thing.

657
00:31:11,226 --> 00:31:12,694
I did not touch the stereo!

658
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,162
I-I was across the room!

659
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:16,599
- Where's the remote?
- I dunno where the remote is!

660
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:25,108
Get out of my house!

661
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,285
Okay, not all of you.

662
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:30,615
Those of you who live here
can stay.

663
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:34,086
What about me?

664
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:35,588
Can I stay?

665
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:37,823
And my crew?

666
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:43,063
Get out of my house!

667
00:31:46,634 --> 00:31:48,903
What does it want from us?
Should we leave?

668
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:50,972
I feel like he wants us to stay.

669
00:31:51,072 --> 00:31:52,875
Ghost guy? Who are you?

670
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:54,810
Do you want us to stay here?

671
00:31:55,678 --> 00:31:56,845
I think we should leave.

672
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,357
Let's go to Steve
and Stevie's house next door!

673
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:01,117
It's Monday, they'll be
at haiku and limerick night.

674
00:32:01,217 --> 00:32:03,921
Then-then-then we should
just wait on the front porch

675
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:05,523
until Mom gets home.

676
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,325
I like when you're scared.
You're less condescending.

677
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:18,805
Pretty cool
Halloween decoration, 'ey?

678
00:32:18,905 --> 00:32:21,040
Anything go on around here?

679
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,886
So then they all
just go, like, running out of there,

680
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,478
and two minutes later,
my mom comes home

681
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:26,079
carrying some
Halloween decorations,

682
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:28,416
completely oblivious, as usual.

683
00:32:28,517 --> 00:32:32,053
So, I'm serious.
I think we have an actual ghost.

684
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:33,956
- Weird.
- Are you even listening?

685
00:32:34,056 --> 00:32:35,324
Did you hear what I just said?

686
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:37,092
Yeah, no, totally, um...

687
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:38,336
You have, like, a weird ghost

688
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,163
and then there are people
that just left.

689
00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:41,263
Yeah.

690
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:43,399
Is someone there with you?

691
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:47,605
Um... we gotta talk.

692
00:32:47,705 --> 00:32:49,206
Who's we?

693
00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:50,775
You get over here.

694
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:54,479
Hey, Taylor sailor!

695
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,549
Hey, Amandy candy!

696
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:58,818
Um...

697
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:01,320
O-okay, so, we...

698
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,625
Carly was talkin' to me about
we needed to tell you this,

699
00:33:04,725 --> 00:33:08,362
and, well, we...
Carly and I waned to...

700
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:10,999
Taylor and I are a thing now.

701
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:13,501
I was gonna tell you earlier,
but...

702
00:33:13,602 --> 00:33:15,638
I dunno, um...

703
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:18,307
Yeah, sorry.

704
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:19,876
Are you kidding me?

705
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:22,012
Are you kidding me?!

706
00:33:22,846 --> 00:33:25,983
God!
You guys are both so stupid!

707
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:34,794
I know you
had to work late last night,

708
00:33:34,894 --> 00:33:36,896
but things were so weird.

709
00:33:36,996 --> 00:33:38,864
Aw, I've been there, sweetie.

710
00:33:38,964 --> 00:33:40,366
Hurts like hell, doesn't it?

711
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:43,203
I can't believe
that Taylor and Carly are...

712
00:33:43,303 --> 00:33:44,838
God!

713
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,242
When I was a teenager,
there was this boy.

714
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:50,544
We had so much fun together.

715
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:52,414
He was like my soulmate.
You know?

716
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:53,816
And then he...

717
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:55,417
Well...

718
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,252
Then he just...

719
00:33:57,352 --> 00:34:00,256
Mom... this is not about you.

720
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:01,591
I have to go to school.

721
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:12,437
So, it's late at night,

722
00:34:12,537 --> 00:34:15,708
and Hamlet's compatriots
are outside the castle,

723
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:18,044
looking for an apparition.

724
00:34:18,144 --> 00:34:19,144
A ghost.

725
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:23,617
Marcellus wants Horatio to see
the ghost for himself,

726
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:26,453
but Horatio is skeptical.

727
00:34:26,553 --> 00:34:29,390
"Tush, tush," he says.
"'Twill-'twill not appear!"

728
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:32,694
But the ghost does appear,

729
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:35,898
and Horatio goes from skeptical

730
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:37,767
to scared.

731
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,971
And he asks the ghost
if he is the deceased king.

732
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,107
The ghost says nothing

733
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,343
he just stalks off.

734
00:34:46,443 --> 00:34:47,544
So now...

735
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:50,247
Horatio shouts at the ghost,
saying, "Stay!

736
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:54,419
Speak! Speak, I charge thee!
Speak!"

737
00:35:16,278 --> 00:35:17,546
Ghost?

738
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,416
Are you there, ghost?

739
00:35:22,385 --> 00:35:23,887
If you're there

740
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,124
speak, I charge thee!

741
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,029
I guess there isn't
a ghost here.

742
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:36,535
♪ I haunt
your house, I haunt your mind ♪

743
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,505
♪ and despite all the clues
I leave for you to find ♪

744
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:42,809
♪ you don't know me,
but I know you ♪

745
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:45,579
♪ Who am I?
You don't have a clue ♪

746
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:49,316
Who are you?
Just reveal yourself!

747
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,052
I kind of liked your song,

748
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:53,722
even though it was
seriously insulting.

749
00:35:55,423 --> 00:35:56,859
Maybe we could be friends.

750
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,494
You could use one. Couldn't you?

751
00:35:58,594 --> 00:36:01,064
Holy crap! Whoa re you?

752
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:02,598
Brian Flynn!

753
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:04,969
You're the kid
from the old year book!

754
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:06,436
Where did you come from?

755
00:36:06,536 --> 00:36:08,505
- From here.
- From where?

756
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:11,276
Here. This is my house.

757
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:14,179
You're the one that chased all
those weirdos out last night.

758
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:16,983
And you moved my mom's
old crate of records?

759
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,518
- They're good!
- And you play guitar when it rains.

760
00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:20,719
Do you like it?

761
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,890
It sounds like
my mom's crappy music,

762
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,925
but it's creepy!

763
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:27,094
But... did you knock
on my window?

764
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:29,798
Actually, your little brother
knocked on your window,

765
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:32,266
and then I knocked on it.
But that was to scare him.

766
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,403
He's pretty funny,
but he's kinda mean to you.

767
00:36:34,503 --> 00:36:36,014
What about the mess
in the living room?

768
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:38,040
My friends and I
like to play cards.

769
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,819
We were gonna clean it up
but then you guys came home

770
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:41,244
so my friends all split.

771
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,779
Speaking of which, I gotta go.

772
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:43,713
Wait!

773
00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:45,291
Brian, I still
have questions for you!

774
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:46,851
Where did you go?

775
00:36:47,651 --> 00:36:48,719
Where did he go?

776
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:52,024
Poker game. See ya later.

777
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:57,763
Well, we
were discussing Hamlet.

778
00:36:57,864 --> 00:37:00,733
Now, Horatio does not
believe in ghosts,

779
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,770
but then he and Bernardo
encounter an apparition

780
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:06,140
that looks like the dead king.

781
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,544
So...
Bernardo calls out Horatio.

782
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,613
"How now, Horatio!

783
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:14,983
You tremble and look pale.

784
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,219
Is not this something more
than fantasy?

785
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,188
What think you on't?"

786
00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:20,722
So.

787
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:24,594
What think you on it, class?

788
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:26,363
Is this ghost real?

789
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:29,400
I think the ghost
is only real in that...

790
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,003
Bernardo and Horatio
think that they can see it.

791
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:34,439
The audience doesn't need
to care if it's real or not.

792
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:35,640
I think it's real.

793
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,676
Horatio's a skeptic,
and yet he still sees it.

794
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:38,844
Right, but

795
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:41,723
the ghost is only meant to be
a story advancing device.

796
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:43,827
I don't think Shakespeare
actually believed in ghosts

797
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:46,387
or expect his audience
to believe in ghosts.

798
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:49,556
Then why does he put ghosts
in, like, four different plays?

799
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:52,627
Maybe Shakespeare
thought ghosts were real.

800
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:55,363
Amanda?

801
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:57,165
I think that
Shakespeare actually

802
00:37:57,265 --> 00:37:58,834
transcends time and culture,

803
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:02,438
and the reason why he works
so well in the 21st century

804
00:38:02,538 --> 00:38:04,574
is because his characters
are so real.

805
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:06,343
- Okay?
- And...

806
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:08,145
I think that ghosts are real.

807
00:38:09,447 --> 00:38:11,149
I-I know they are.

808
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:13,351
Right! Me too.

809
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:16,255
Ooh! I see dead people.

810
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:19,658
Well, some people do.

811
00:38:24,164 --> 00:38:26,466
Yes, Tuesday's perfect.

812
00:38:26,566 --> 00:38:28,327
You know, I think you're
really going to like

813
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:31,115
what Peterson and Cousins can
do for Schwinky Industries.

814
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:32,941
Okay. You, too.

815
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,376
Yeah. Talk to you soon.

816
00:38:34,476 --> 00:38:38,080
Hey, Nancy, you remind me
of an overdue library book.

817
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,550
'Cause you got "fine"
written all over you.

818
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,952
Barry, go away.

819
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:44,687
Hey, Liz.

820
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:47,658
I just got us a meeting
with Schwinky Industries.

821
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,027
Woohoo! High five!

822
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,897
And so the bear says, "What?
I'm not even a farmer."

823
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,072
Check mate, my friend.
Check mate.

824
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:00,773
No way.

825
00:39:00,873 --> 00:39:04,678
Check mate. Apologies, old
chap, but check-flippin'-mate!

826
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:06,213
Adam, can you guys be quiet?

827
00:39:06,313 --> 00:39:08,448
I have, like,
hella homework here.

828
00:39:08,548 --> 00:39:10,318
I'm sure it's
hard to concentrate

829
00:39:10,418 --> 00:39:13,955
when my new chum, Alex, and I
are waging epic chess.

830
00:39:14,055 --> 00:39:16,392
Perhaps you need to take
your hella homework

831
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:18,327
to more quieter surroundings,

832
00:39:18,427 --> 00:39:20,762
such as your own
private bedchamber.

833
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:23,000
Adam, man, you talk so cool.

834
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,501
Bedchamber...

835
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:28,606
Rematch?

836
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,775
I like to just
hang out up here and

837
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:33,445
what the 3Ds go by.

838
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:35,114
- 3Ds?
- Yeah, you know.

839
00:39:35,214 --> 00:39:38,183
Three-dimensional, living,
breathing human beings,

840
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:40,420
like you, or your mom,
or your brother.

841
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,324
People... with jobs, cars

842
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,193
credit cards...

843
00:39:46,293 --> 00:39:49,330
So, you can see the 3Ds,
but can they see you?

844
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,797
I think maybe sometimes.

845
00:39:50,897 --> 00:39:52,410
Pretty sure your brother saw me
through the window

846
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:54,469
the first night
you guys were here.

847
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:57,606
But usually when people see me
they get really scared,

848
00:39:57,706 --> 00:39:59,542
and he just seemed semi-freaked.

849
00:39:59,642 --> 00:40:00,643
Semi-freaked?

850
00:40:00,743 --> 00:40:02,423
That usually only happens
with little kids.

851
00:40:02,511 --> 00:40:04,324
They see you and they don't know
they're not supposed to see you,

852
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:06,192
so they just talk to you
like you're a normal 3D,

853
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:09,354
but usually,
anybody over nine, ten,

854
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:11,089
can't see you at all.

855
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:13,024
So, do they just
look right through you?

856
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,701
Sometimes they even walk
right through you.

857
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:16,228
No way. Does it hurt?

858
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:19,431
No, it doesn't hurt exactly,
but...

859
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:20,866
Well

860
00:40:22,302 --> 00:40:22,835
if you're just standing there trying
to communicate with somebody

861
00:40:22,935 --> 00:40:24,471
and they kinda just

862
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:26,239
walk right through you,
it can be

863
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:27,475
emotionally scarring.

864
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:29,777
Well, okay, so,
the first night we moved in...

865
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:31,821
Yeah, I wanted you and your
brother to see me through the window,

866
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:34,049
so you guys would get scared,
and, well,

867
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:35,917
go back
to wherever you came from.

868
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,686
Why? That's so mean?

869
00:40:37,786 --> 00:40:39,855
Yeah, well,
how would you feel if

870
00:40:39,955 --> 00:40:41,957
three strangers just showed
up at your house

871
00:40:42,058 --> 00:40:43,293
and took up residence?

872
00:40:43,393 --> 00:40:45,434
Okay, so if you wanted
to scare us back to Michigan,

873
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:47,198
why are we hangin' out now?

874
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:48,699
I don't know.

875
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:50,301
I figure we could be friends.

876
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:51,603
Okay.

877
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:53,505
I mean, I guess
you don't really have any.

878
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:55,907
Yeah, I do.
There's Earl right there.

879
00:40:56,007 --> 00:40:57,008
I don't see him.

880
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:58,877
Yeah, right there. See?

881
00:40:58,977 --> 00:41:00,846
He's always
pushin' that tire around.

882
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:02,148
I do see him.

883
00:41:02,248 --> 00:41:04,084
Hey, Earl, how's it goin'?

884
00:41:04,184 --> 00:41:06,120
Oh, hey, Bryan. Swell, swell.

885
00:41:07,554 --> 00:41:08,955
Can the girl see us?

886
00:41:09,055 --> 00:41:10,158
Hi, Earl!

887
00:41:10,825 --> 00:41:12,960
Oh, I guess she can. Uh...

888
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,395
Hey, Amanda.

889
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:15,731
Brian's told us all about you.

890
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:17,699
Really? What'd he say?

891
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,501
Um...

892
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:21,938
Uh, so long.

893
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,043
So, Earl's a ghost.

894
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:28,312
A haunter, yeah.

895
00:41:28,412 --> 00:41:29,789
He grew up on this block
in the '50s.

896
00:41:29,813 --> 00:41:32,183
Got hit by a car in 1957.

897
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:34,619
Sometimes he still kinda thinks
its 1957,

898
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,955
and stuff freaks him out
a little bit.

899
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:39,825
Nice kid, though.
Pretty decent poker player.

900
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:41,026
Wow!

901
00:41:42,228 --> 00:41:43,739
So you hang out with other
ghosts from the neighborhood?

902
00:41:43,763 --> 00:41:45,766
Yep, our normal poker game
is me, Earl,

903
00:41:45,866 --> 00:41:48,569
Hal, Zebulon, Goose Hair
and Suzy Q.

904
00:41:48,669 --> 00:41:49,936
Zebulon's a farm boy.

905
00:41:50,036 --> 00:41:52,474
When he was growin' up
around here in the 1860s,

906
00:41:52,574 --> 00:41:55,177
this was all forests
and prairies,

907
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:56,911
and farmlands.

908
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:59,215
Hal lived on this block
when it was still pretty new.

909
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:02,050
I think he went to high school
at OPRF with Ernest Hemingway.

910
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:03,287
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

911
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,422
So these guys just walk around

912
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:07,757
thinking it's the '50s
or the 1800s?

913
00:42:07,857 --> 00:42:09,794
Well, some days
they're pretty lucid,

914
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:13,298
but a lot of the times they think
too hard about time movin' along,

915
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:14,765
and it kinda freaks 'em out.

916
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:17,203
Any girls?

917
00:42:17,303 --> 00:42:18,980
My friends used to hang out
with this one haunter

918
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:20,004
called Dance Hall Mary,

919
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,808
but they haven't seen her
in years.

920
00:42:21,908 --> 00:42:23,943
Other than that, just Suzy Q.

921
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:27,114
Suzy Q's always
strummin' her guitar,

922
00:42:27,215 --> 00:42:30,017
and talkin' about peace
and the ecology.

923
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:32,286
So, there was another one
with a weird name.

924
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:33,822
- Goose hair.
- Goose hair?

925
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:36,625
Yep. He's the lovechild
of a French fur trapper

926
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:37,726
and a Chippewa Indian.

927
00:42:37,826 --> 00:42:39,128
Well, Native America.

928
00:42:39,229 --> 00:42:40,430
Okay.

929
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,632
Anyway, he's been walkin'
around this area

930
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:45,302
since the 1700s.
Seen quite a bit of changes.

931
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:47,438
Doesn't really accept it all.

932
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:48,972
Quiet as a breeze.

933
00:42:49,072 --> 00:42:50,774
So, can all the ghosts
see each other?

934
00:42:50,874 --> 00:42:52,143
As far as I can tell, yeah.

935
00:42:52,244 --> 00:42:54,479
Most of us can talk
to each other too, though

936
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:55,979
you wouldn't really want to talk

937
00:42:56,614 --> 00:42:56,848
to most of the ghosts
in this neighborhood.

938
00:42:57,182 --> 00:42:58,182
How come?

939
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,085
Well, a lot of them
are older guys

940
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:01,887
that have kind of
a lot of anger.

941
00:43:01,987 --> 00:43:03,156
You know?

942
00:43:03,257 --> 00:43:05,492
Uh, there's this one guy,
Vladimir.

943
00:43:05,592 --> 00:43:06,693
We call him Vlad the Bad.

944
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:07,993
Everybody stays away from him.

945
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:10,197
Some people say he's not even
like a regular haunter.

946
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:11,332
Really?

947
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,610
There's also a lot of women
kinda float in' around,

948
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:15,271
wearin' tattered dresses.

949
00:43:15,371 --> 00:43:17,739
They're really strange
and really creepy,

950
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,141
so I avoid them
as much as I can.

951
00:43:21,077 --> 00:43:23,446
Yeah, now that you can see
me and Earl,

952
00:43:23,546 --> 00:43:25,824
you might start seein' a lot of
other ghosts around here, too.

953
00:43:25,848 --> 00:43:28,452
- Really?
- I mean, I don't know.

954
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:30,120
I don't know
why you can see me now,

955
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,660
or see Earl
when you couldn't before,

956
00:43:31,722 --> 00:43:34,459
and apparently
some people still can't.

957
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:35,860
I want to meet your friends.

958
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,262
Amanda!

959
00:43:37,796 --> 00:43:38,863
Amanda!

960
00:43:39,765 --> 00:43:41,367
It's fine.
She probably can't see me.

961
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:43,736
I'll bet you money
she can't hear me either.

962
00:43:43,836 --> 00:43:45,005
Hey!

963
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:47,173
Amanda's ma!

964
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,843
I'm a dead ghostly punk

965
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:51,946
and I'm getting to second base
with your daughter!

966
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,448
You rat.

967
00:43:54,482 --> 00:43:55,583
Amanda!

968
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,254
Amanda, did you hear me?

969
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:00,389
Were you on your phone?

970
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:05,228
Oh, uh, trying to sort things
out back in Spring Lake, huh?

971
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:08,131
Okay, well you be careful
out here.

972
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:15,441
That was pretty good.

973
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:25,284
Hey.

974
00:44:25,385 --> 00:44:27,555
I like what you said in English
the other day.

975
00:44:27,655 --> 00:44:28,789
Oh, thanks. You, too.

976
00:44:28,889 --> 00:44:30,090
Thanks for backing me up.

977
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,510
- I'm Jasmine.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

978
00:44:31,592 --> 00:44:33,662
Er, I know your name from class.

979
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:37,265
Is it true your cheer squad was
state runner-up in Michigan last year?

980
00:44:37,366 --> 00:44:40,135
- Yeah.
- And is it true you were the captain?

981
00:44:40,235 --> 00:44:41,971
Well, I was elected
to be captain this year,

982
00:44:42,071 --> 00:44:43,539
but we moved here instead.

983
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,008
How do you know all this?

984
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:46,176
I'm gonna talk to Coach.

985
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:48,044
I'm gonna see if we can
find a spot for you.

986
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,514
Hey, Jasmine!
Give me an O, baby!

987
00:44:50,614 --> 00:44:52,216
O, Squatchie!

988
00:44:52,316 --> 00:44:54,151
Thanks for the O.
Hey man, how's it goin'?

989
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:55,251
Hi.

990
00:44:55,587 --> 00:44:56,488
You know him?

991
00:44:57,623 --> 00:44:58,903
Yeah, everybody knows Squatchie.

992
00:44:58,957 --> 00:45:01,259
His hair has its own website.

993
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:03,296
So, do you get it?

994
00:45:03,397 --> 00:45:04,531
I just downloaded that song

995
00:45:04,631 --> 00:45:06,900
onto my phone
and onto my laptop.

996
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,668
You listen to music
on your phone?

997
00:45:08,768 --> 00:45:10,671
Yeah, everyone does.

998
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:11,972
And more importantly,

999
00:45:12,072 --> 00:45:14,442
if you're just grabbing,
like, one song here and there,

1000
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:16,421
does that mean you never really
listen to a whole album?

1001
00:45:16,445 --> 00:45:17,779
Exactly. You don't have to.

1002
00:45:17,879 --> 00:45:19,548
You don't have to have
all these CDs

1003
00:45:19,648 --> 00:45:22,151
lying around like my mom
used to do, or, like,

1004
00:45:22,251 --> 00:45:23,653
records, or whatever.

1005
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:25,955
Plus, you don't have to listen
to the crappy songs

1006
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:28,358
they put in between
the good songs on CDs.

1007
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,428
So, like, every song I
downloaded onto my phone

1008
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:31,762
is a good song.

1009
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,198
So it's like a giant mix tape.

1010
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,367
- Yeah, I guess.
- Okay.

1011
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:38,169
See, there's, like,
a time and a place

1012
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,405
for a mix tape,

1013
00:45:39,505 --> 00:45:40,749
but you're missing out
on albums.

1014
00:45:40,773 --> 00:45:43,108
That means you're missing out
on some great music.

1015
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,710
Like, what would
London Calling be

1016
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,613
if you didn't listen
to the whole album?

1017
00:45:46,713 --> 00:45:48,582
Just "Train in Vain"?

1018
00:45:48,682 --> 00:45:50,584
The Clash made London Calling

1019
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:55,222
as a whole two-record,
four-sided album of meaning,

1020
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:58,193
and its got all these
different topics and styles,

1021
00:45:58,293 --> 00:46:00,295
and together it's incredible!

1022
00:46:00,395 --> 00:46:02,565
Like, "Spanish Bombs"
and "Death or Glory"

1023
00:46:02,665 --> 00:46:03,833
changed everything for me,

1024
00:46:03,933 --> 00:46:05,853
but I probably wouldn't've
even heard those songs

1025
00:46:05,935 --> 00:46:08,137
if I could've just put
"Train in Vain" on my phone.

1026
00:46:08,237 --> 00:46:10,475
Wait, is "Train in Vain"
the one that's like,

1027
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:12,109
"You don't stand by me..."

1028
00:46:12,209 --> 00:46:13,778
No, okay, but, like,

1029
00:46:13,878 --> 00:46:15,623
except for that, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1030
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,382
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1031
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,784
You listen to music
on your phone

1032
00:46:18,884 --> 00:46:21,788
when you have some great albums
right downstairs.

1033
00:46:21,888 --> 00:46:23,623
You mean my mom's crate
of old records?

1034
00:46:23,723 --> 00:46:25,458
You got, like, The Ramones,

1035
00:46:25,558 --> 00:46:28,228
The Sex Pistols, The Jam.

1036
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,806
You gotta let me teach you
about good music.

1037
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,700
I'd rather have you teach me
about other stuff.

1038
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,068
Other stuff?

1039
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:37,005
Yeah, like, you said all your
friends are from around here

1040
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:38,840
but they're from
different time periods.

1041
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:41,110
So teach me about what Oak Park
was like in the 1970s,

1042
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:44,379
in the 1870s and the 1770s.

1043
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,149
Crap, I think I hear
my brother coming.

1044
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:50,988
Mother wants to know whether
you need a ride to school tomorrow...

1045
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:52,590
Are you...

1046
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,325
Were you talking to someone?

1047
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:55,627
No.

1048
00:46:55,727 --> 00:46:57,496
No, you're declining
the ride to school,

1049
00:46:57,596 --> 00:47:00,599
or no, you weren't talking
with anyone?

1050
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:03,770
Ah, parlor tricks
calculated to frighten me!

1051
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,540
Well done,
lovely sleight of hand!

1052
00:47:07,507 --> 00:47:10,210
Or, are you in cahoots
with our spirit?

1053
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,813
Entertaining a specter
in your bedroom?

1054
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,114
Ah!

1055
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:17,252
That was great.

1056
00:47:17,352 --> 00:47:18,419
Happy to help.

1057
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,756
Come on, let's go show
each other around Oak Park.

1058
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:22,892

Well, I mean, no cheerleaders
or honor students, but

1074
00:49:14,088 --> 00:49:16,457
well, I was a dark, cynical
outsider with a guitar,

1075
00:49:16,557 --> 00:49:17,702
so yeah, yeah,
I had girlfriends.

1076
00:49:17,726 --> 00:49:18,426
Tell me about your girlfriends.

1077
00:49:18,526 --> 00:49:19,726
No, no, I don't wanna do that.

1078
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,641
Come on! You know everything
about my idiot ex-boyfriend!

1079
00:49:22,665 --> 00:49:23,665
Fine.

1080
00:49:24,901 --> 00:49:25,802
Well, there's only one that was
really worth talking about.

1081
00:49:25,902 --> 00:49:27,905
This girl I knew one summer.

1082
00:49:28,005 --> 00:49:29,306
I taught her to play guitar,

1083
00:49:29,406 --> 00:49:30,507
she taught me about reggae.

1084
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:32,275
What about punk?

1085
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:35,479
Well, I started out playing, like,
Genesis and Pink Floyd covers,

1086
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:36,791
and then she came to me
and she's like,

1087
00:49:36,815 --> 00:49:38,482
"Teach me to play
"No Woman No Cry."

1088
00:49:38,582 --> 00:49:40,295
So then I started listening
to Bob Marley reggae

1089
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,454
so I could teach her,
you know, and then,

1090
00:49:42,554 --> 00:49:43,956
and then she came to me one day,

1091
00:49:44,056 --> 00:49:45,434
with this-this song,
and she's like,

1092
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:48,461
"I really dig this track.
I really wanna learn this."

1093
00:49:48,561 --> 00:49:49,830
So I listened to it,

1094
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:53,835
and it was "I'm So Bored
with the USA" by The Clash.

1095
00:49:53,935 --> 00:49:55,136
And that was it!

1096
00:49:55,236 --> 00:49:56,705
I was a punk!

1097
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:01,643
So Hemingway was an innovator.

1098
00:50:01,744 --> 00:50:03,312
Basically a punk rocker.

1099
00:50:03,947 --> 00:50:05,314
Amanda...

1100
00:50:06,115 --> 00:50:07,717
You have something to share?

1101
00:50:08,753 --> 00:50:10,054
Well...

1102
00:50:10,154 --> 00:50:11,856
Hemingway was

1103
00:50:11,956 --> 00:50:13,791
to 1920s literature

1104
00:50:13,891 --> 00:50:15,660
what The Clash
and The Ramones were

1105
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:17,428
to 1970s rock and roll.

1106
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:20,031
I mean, Hemingway's stripped-
down writing style was

1107
00:50:20,131 --> 00:50:22,234
almost a reaction to
the overwrought writing style

1108
00:50:22,334 --> 00:50:23,235
of the Victorian age.

1109
00:50:23,335 --> 00:50:24,536
Okay.

1110
00:50:24,636 --> 00:50:27,407
So, the punkers rejected this

1111
00:50:27,507 --> 00:50:30,210
overwrought guitar solo
and synthesizer

1112
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,645
mainstream rock of the 1970s.

1113
00:50:32,747 --> 00:50:35,283
They stripped rock and roll
down to its essence.

1114
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:37,685
Hemingway said more with less.

1115
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:38,888
So did The Clash.

1116
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:41,833
My friend Hal actually
knew Ernest Hemingway

1117
00:50:41,857 --> 00:50:42,892
from the neighborhood.

1118
00:50:42,992 --> 00:50:45,361
He was, like,
totally obsessed with death.

1119
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:47,764
In all his stories, the
protagonist always has to,

1120
00:50:47,864 --> 00:50:49,833
like, confront death. You know?

1121
00:50:49,933 --> 00:50:51,774
And for Hemingway,
once you're dead, that's it,

1122
00:50:51,803 --> 00:50:53,938
I mean, you're done,
it's lights out, so,

1123
00:50:54,038 --> 00:50:55,773
so you have to face it,

1124
00:50:55,873 --> 00:50:57,275
but you also have to accept it,

1125
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:58,552
and the only way to do that
is kinda like

1126
00:50:58,576 --> 00:51:00,145
to live life
without fear of dying.

1127
00:51:00,245 --> 00:51:02,280
With gusto, you know.

1128
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,950
Brian, how did you die?

1129
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:08,221
Well, what do you mean?
I mean, I'm not...

1130
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:09,689
I mean, I'm talking to you.

1131
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:12,759
But, like, you're not a 3D,
you're a haunter.

1132
00:51:14,695 --> 00:51:15,831
Lemme put it like this.

1133
00:51:15,931 --> 00:51:18,066
How did you get to be
the way that you are now?

1134
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,970
Like, no one can

1135
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:23,472
hear you or see you,

1136
00:51:23,572 --> 00:51:26,910
except for other ghosts and me.

1137
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,912
♪

1138
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:32,049
I'm sorry.

1139
00:51:32,984 --> 00:51:34,252
No.

1140
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:36,020
No, I understand the question...

1141
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,690
I mean, it's-
it's a legitimate question.

1142
00:51:40,425 --> 00:51:42,361
I was playing my guitar
on the roof.

1143
00:51:42,461 --> 00:51:43,872
I used to love
playing my guitar on the roof.

1144
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:45,417
I would just go up there.
It was, uh...

1145
00:51:45,465 --> 00:51:47,300
It was like my place. You know?

1146
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,003
Like I could just get away
from all the attacks and stuff,

1147
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:51,873
and just play my guitar.

1148
00:51:51,973 --> 00:51:53,240
Did you fall off?

1149
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,476
No, I was jamming
and it started to rain,

1150
00:51:55,576 --> 00:51:57,455
and, I dunno, I didn't wanna
go back in, so I kept playing.

1151
00:51:58,546 --> 00:51:59,858
And then it started
raining harder,

1152
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:01,893
and then there was thunder
and lightning, and I dunno,

1153
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:04,087
everything was just
so beautiful and wet,

1154
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,355
and I just felt so alive.

1155
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:08,893
Like I could just play any lick,

1156
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,560
or write any song,
or do anything.

1157
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,672
I wasn't scared of falling,
I wasn't scared of dying,

1158
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,699
I wasn't scared of anything,
and then bam!

1159
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,368
Lightning strike.

1160
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,469
Wow.

1161
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:19,770
And that was that.

1162
00:52:19,871 --> 00:52:22,574
So why do you always still
play guitar in the rain?

1163
00:52:24,877 --> 00:52:26,312
Because I can.

1164
00:52:26,412 --> 00:52:29,016
I love playing my guitar
in the rain and, well

1165
00:52:29,116 --> 00:52:30,717
can't kill me now, can it?

1166
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:35,789
Okay, so you don't really
need a date for Homecoming.

1167
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:38,292
I mean, a lot of people go
with groups of friends.

1168
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:39,394
I'm goin' with Dominic

1169
00:52:40,495 --> 00:52:42,107
and it'll be real fun
if you went with Squatchie.

1170
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:43,899
I think I have someone else
in mind.

1171
00:52:43,999 --> 00:52:45,035
Not Squatchie?

1172
00:52:45,135 --> 00:52:47,203
I mean, 'cause I could
totally make that happen.

1173
00:52:47,303 --> 00:52:49,572
No, no, you don't know him.

1174
00:52:49,672 --> 00:52:51,842
I don't even know if he can go.

1175
00:52:51,943 --> 00:52:53,386
Okay, I know
you're not thinkin' about

1176
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:57,082
asking your old cheatin'
boyfriend from back in Michigan.

1177
00:52:57,182 --> 00:53:00,252
You know, Evelyn, you remind me
of a wide receiver,

1178
00:53:00,352 --> 00:53:02,396
'cause every time I see you,
I wanna make a pass at you.

1179
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,421
Excuse me.

1180
00:53:03,456 --> 00:53:05,758
Barry, I think I hear
your mother calling you.

1181
00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:06,868
Go ahead, Liz. You were saying?

1182
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,927
Nancy,

1183
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:10,064
you remind me
of a jigsaw puzzle,

1184
00:53:10,164 --> 00:53:11,807
'cause I just wanna
put you in my bedroom closet

1185
00:53:11,831 --> 00:53:13,067
and save you for a rainy day.

1186
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:14,936
Perfect, okay.
See you at lunch.

1187
00:53:15,036 --> 00:53:17,305
And on that rainy day,
I'd take you out of the closet,

1188
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:19,085
spread you all over the floor,
and, like...

1189
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,542
Barry, you gotta stop.

1190
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:22,444
Nobody wants to hear your crap.

1191
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:24,446
Pow.

1192
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:30,020
Come on,
go to Homecoming with me.

1193
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,530
You wanna take a dead guy
to Homecoming?

1194
00:53:31,554 --> 00:53:32,756
That is twisted.

1195
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:34,096
You don't act like you're dead.

1196
00:53:34,192 --> 00:53:35,526
Yeah, but...

1197
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,029
You said I was,
and you're right.

1198
00:53:38,129 --> 00:53:39,598
I'm dead. I'm a haunter.

1199
00:53:39,698 --> 00:53:43,635
Yeah, but you're
funny, and sweet, and...

1200
00:53:43,735 --> 00:53:45,838
I need you to be my...

1201
00:53:45,938 --> 00:53:46,938
Ugh...

1202
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,308
Ugh?!

1203
00:53:49,742 --> 00:53:52,446
Look, I haunt this house, and
anyway, I always hated school dances,

1204
00:53:52,546 --> 00:53:53,690
except for the time
that we played one.

1205
00:53:53,714 --> 00:53:54,915
That was hilarious.

1206
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:07,196
But apart from that, no.

1207
00:54:07,296 --> 00:54:08,565
I'm not goin' to a school dance

1208
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,400
with Little Miss
Popular Cheerleader.

1209
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,470
Fine! I'm the closest thing
you've had to a girlfriend in

1210
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,216
forever, and you won't go
to a school dance with me.

1211
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,240
That's fine.

1212
00:54:16,274 --> 00:54:17,908
Just go and disappear
back into the wall,

1213
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:19,510
or wherever you go
when you disappear.

1214
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:21,013
- Amanda!
- No!

1215
00:54:21,113 --> 00:54:24,416
I have calculus to do, and
cheesy boy bands to listen to.

1216
00:54:24,516 --> 00:54:26,686
Fade out, dude.
Go haunt someone else.

1217
00:54:29,822 --> 00:54:33,361
So, Schwinky Industries
was ready to order 5,000 units?

1218
00:54:33,461 --> 00:54:35,663
Yeah, until Barry
told Kathy Schwinky

1219
00:54:35,763 --> 00:54:38,867
that she reminded him
of a fire at a tire factory.

1220
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:40,369
She was really smokin'.

1221
00:54:42,504 --> 00:54:43,305
So Barry killed the whole
Schwinky Industries deal?

1222
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,740
Yep.

1223
00:54:46,842 --> 00:54:49,079
Five, six, seven, eight!

1224
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:52,049
Hey, kids! Check us out!

1225
00:54:52,149 --> 00:54:53,484
The mighty Huskies

1226
00:54:53,584 --> 00:54:57,355
going to rock da,
rock da, rock da house!

1227
00:54:57,455 --> 00:54:59,791
New girl, if you're gonna
be on our squad,

1228
00:54:59,891 --> 00:55:01,226
you gotta bring it.

1229
00:55:01,326 --> 00:55:04,330
O-A-K P-A-R-K!

1230
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:06,199
Go Oak Park!

1231
00:55:06,299 --> 00:55:09,002
O-A-K P-A-R-K!

1232
00:55:09,103 --> 00:55:10,103
All right. See ya later.

1233
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,238
All right, bye.

1234
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:12,606
- Hey.
- Hey.

1235
00:55:12,706 --> 00:55:14,040
So...

1236
00:55:14,141 --> 00:55:15,510
What'd Amanda say
about Homecoming?

1237
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:16,677
Um, not much.

1238
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:18,546
She said she had someone
in mind, but...

1239
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:19,514
I don't know who it is.

1240
00:55:19,614 --> 00:55:20,916
Aw, man.

1241
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,752
How can that be?
You know everyone!

1242
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:25,087
I'm gonna ask her anyway.

1243
00:55:25,187 --> 00:55:26,789
We're gonna have
such a good time.

1244
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,195
Hey, Amanda!

1245
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,297
Oh, hey, Squatchie.

1246
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:34,698
Hey, um...

1247
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,243
I've been meaning
to ask you something,

1248
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:38,068
and I didn't quite know
how to do it.

1249
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,705
So, I made you this sign,

1250
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:43,808
and, um, this shirt.

1251
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:45,778
With?

1252
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,849
Oh, Squatchie, is that for me?

1253
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:55,956
I'm sorry... we never really...

1254
00:55:56,056 --> 00:55:57,525
I kind of have, um...

1255
00:55:58,326 --> 00:55:59,427
There's this guy

1256
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:01,829
that I'm kinda of planning on
going to Homecoming with.

1257
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:05,201
But I shaved my Squatchie fur...

1258
00:56:05,301 --> 00:56:07,102
I know, and it's really

1259
00:56:07,203 --> 00:56:08,638
sweet...

1260
00:56:08,738 --> 00:56:11,975
Look, the "me" still works
on your torso and,

1261
00:56:12,075 --> 00:56:13,410
and the shirt works, too.

1262
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:17,081
All you have to do is
change the name on the sign.

1263
00:56:17,182 --> 00:56:18,616
We woulda had so much fun.

1264
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:21,953
I know. I'm sorry.
There's just another guy.

1265
00:56:29,229 --> 00:56:31,398
Look, I'm not taking her
to Homecoming.

1266
00:56:31,498 --> 00:56:33,133
I already told her that.

1267
00:56:33,234 --> 00:56:35,603
I don't get it.
She's a swell dame.

1268
00:56:35,703 --> 00:56:37,505
I'll take her to the dance,
ya knucklehead.

1269
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:40,442
I'll do-si-do and allemande
riot with Miss Amanda.

1270
00:56:40,542 --> 00:56:43,011
She is as pretty as a daffodil.

1271
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:45,080
Can she waltz?

1272
00:56:45,181 --> 00:56:46,849
I'd show her
an enchanting evening.

1273
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:48,360
Well, that's really kind
of you guys,

1274
00:56:48,384 --> 00:56:49,652
but she didn't ask any of you.

1275
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:52,189
So what, Ace?
Maybe I'll ask her!

1276
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:53,857
Fantastic meal, Mother!

1277
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:56,894
The expatriates of Thailand
certainly know their curry!

1278
00:56:56,994 --> 00:56:58,739
Well, thank you guys
for celebrating with me.

1279
00:56:58,763 --> 00:57:01,699
I really feel like I'm starting
to do okay at work.

1280
00:57:03,135 --> 00:57:05,471
Someone broke in again!
Let's call the police.

1281
00:57:05,571 --> 00:57:08,173
Perhaps it was
our resident spirit.

1282
00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:10,510
Come on, Brian. Really?

1283
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:11,711
What did you say?

1284
00:57:11,811 --> 00:57:13,213
Nothing.

1285
00:57:13,313 --> 00:57:15,226
It was probably one of
those pranks that Adam pulls

1286
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,884
to scare you and me, or

1287
00:57:16,984 --> 00:57:18,061
it might've been
the cheer squad.

1288
00:57:18,085 --> 00:57:19,085
I'll call Jasmine.

1289
00:57:19,153 --> 00:57:20,288
Well, I'd feel a lot safer

1290
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:21,866
if we had the police
search the place.

1291
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,360
Make sure there's
no creepsters in here.

1292
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,694
Look at that crap.

1293
00:57:25,794 --> 00:57:27,830
Who breaks in and plays cards?

1294
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,566
Hey, did you and the cheer squad

1295
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,768
break in
and trash our front room?

1296
00:57:32,803 --> 00:57:33,837
I knew it was you guys.

1297
00:57:33,937 --> 00:57:35,873
You guys are so bad.

1298
00:57:35,973 --> 00:57:37,251
Yeah, now I have to
clean it all up.

1299
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:38,843
Okay. Okay, thanks, Jasmine.

1300
00:57:38,943 --> 00:57:39,943
Bye.

1301
00:57:40,011 --> 00:57:41,846
Yeah, Jasmine
and the cheer squad did it.

1302
00:57:41,946 --> 00:57:42,946
I'm sorry. They...

1303
00:57:43,915 --> 00:57:45,394
I told them we were going out
to dinner, and

1304
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:46,428
they know where I hide
the spare key.

1305
00:57:46,452 --> 00:57:47,553
Weird girls.

1306
00:57:47,653 --> 00:57:50,424
Whatever happened to just
toilet papering trees?

1307
00:57:50,524 --> 00:57:51,964
Anyway, you're cleaning up
this mess.

1308
00:57:52,058 --> 00:57:53,627
Already on it, Mom.

1309
00:57:53,727 --> 00:57:54,728
Come on, Adam,

1310
00:57:54,828 --> 00:57:57,031
let's go find something trashy
to watch on TV.

1311
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:59,200
That shouldn't be difficult.

1312
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:06,041
Brian?

1313
00:58:08,412 --> 00:58:09,779
Brian!

1314
00:58:11,648 --> 00:58:13,517
- Brian!
- We were gonna clean it up.

1315
00:58:13,617 --> 00:58:15,820
You guys came home
earlier than we expected.

1316
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,622
So you can party in my house,

1317
00:58:17,722 --> 00:58:19,256
but you can't take me
to Homecoming.

1318
00:58:19,357 --> 00:58:20,659
It's my house, too,

1319
00:58:20,759 --> 00:58:22,894
and we were gonna clean it up.

1320
00:58:22,994 --> 00:58:24,796
Well, you better still
clean it up.

1321
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:27,800
Are your messy friends
still here?

1322
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,768
Yeah.

1323
00:58:28,868 --> 00:58:30,136
Lovely to see you, Amanda.

1324
00:58:30,236 --> 00:58:31,738
Terribly sorry about this mess.

1325
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:33,607
It's fine, Hal. Hey, Earl.

1326
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:35,476
Hey, Amanda.
Sorry about the mess,

1327
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:38,613
but we had a really far-out
happening in your groovy pad.

1328
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:41,225
Brian talked about you
the whole time we played cards,

1329
00:58:41,249 --> 00:58:42,517
and he ain't wrong.

1330
00:58:42,617 --> 00:58:45,054
You are as pretty as a daisy.

1331
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,589
Well, thank you, Zebulon.

1332
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,923
Hey, Goose Hair.

1333
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,928
Thank you, everyone,

1334
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,039
but I'm still mad at you,

1335
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:54,798
and I don't wanna see you.

1336
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,168
Amanda, who're you talking to?

1337
00:58:57,268 --> 00:58:59,804
No one! I'm on the phone!

1338
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:02,475
Well, since Brian won't take
you to the dance, I'd like to...

1339
00:59:02,575 --> 00:59:06,612
Pay him no heed. Why...
Earl here is a grease monkey,

1340
00:59:06,712 --> 00:59:09,916
but I'm a classroom scholar
and gridiron stalwart!

1341
00:59:10,016 --> 00:59:13,286
I intend to play halfback
at Dartmouth!

1342
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:15,122
Allow me to escort you
to the dance.

1343
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:17,558
I'll escort you to the dance,
Miss Amanda.

1344
00:59:17,658 --> 00:59:20,194
You're as pretty as a bouquet
of blue bonnets.

1345
00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:21,397
Well, thank you guys.

1346
00:59:21,497 --> 00:59:23,965
You definitely know how to
make a girl feel special.

1347
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:26,403
That's three gentlemen who'd
love to take me to Homecoming.

1348
00:59:26,503 --> 00:59:27,670
Four.

1349
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,639
Plus Goose Hair, equals four.

1350
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:31,541
Look, you overeager
pack of weasels.

1351
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:33,811
None of us can take Amanda
to Homecoming.

1352
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:35,789
They won't even be able to
see us over at the high school.

1353
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:37,981
We're haunters, remember?

1354
00:59:38,081 --> 00:59:39,651
We haunt this block.

1355
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,287
I have a song.

1356
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:57,672

00:59:57,772 --> 00:59:58,873

I forgive you,
you seer ghostly punk.

1372
01:00:35,516 --> 01:00:38,118
But, you guys, I did ask Brian
to Homecoming,

1373
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:40,188
but I'd love to dance
with every one of you.

1374
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:41,389
You heard him.

1375
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:43,492
We're not going to the dance.

1376
01:00:43,592 --> 01:00:44,494
We're haunters.

1377
01:00:44,594 --> 01:00:46,061
We'll be invisible.

1378
01:00:47,162 --> 01:00:49,465
Your song gave me an idea.

1379
01:00:49,565 --> 01:00:51,568
You will meet my friends
and they will all meet you

1380
01:00:51,668 --> 01:00:53,704
and we will all dance.

1381
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:57,642
Jasmine? Hey.

1382
01:00:57,742 --> 01:00:58,776
Hear that, fellas?

1383
01:00:59,911 --> 01:01:01,154
We're gonna do-so-do with
Miss Amanda and her friends!

1384
01:01:01,178 --> 01:01:03,381
Don't hold your breath, Zeb,
if you have any.

1385
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:05,684
Brian's right.

1386
01:01:06,384 --> 01:01:08,154
We ain't goin' to no dance.

1387
01:01:08,254 --> 01:01:09,923
We're doomed
to haunt this block.

1388
01:01:10,023 --> 01:01:11,057
We're trapped here.

1389
01:01:11,157 --> 01:01:12,157
Trapped.

1390
01:01:12,659 --> 01:01:14,228
That explains so much.

1391
01:01:15,162 --> 01:01:17,164
Fellas, we ain't trapped.

1392
01:01:17,264 --> 01:01:19,199
We just don't wanna move along.

1393
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:27,108
Mom...

1394
01:01:27,777 --> 01:01:29,345
I have a confession to make.

1395
01:01:30,379 --> 01:01:32,516
That mess wasn't
a cheerleading prank, was it?

1396
01:01:32,616 --> 01:01:33,617
No.

1397
01:01:34,451 --> 01:01:35,695
Look, I know
you miss Spring Lake

1398
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:37,120
and all your friends there,

1399
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,891
and I know you want desperately
to fit in here.

1400
01:01:39,991 --> 01:01:42,794
When I was your age,
I was no perfect angel.

1401
01:01:42,894 --> 01:01:45,598
But you cannot be hosting
wild parties in this house.

1402
01:01:45,698 --> 01:01:47,266
What? I didn't.

1403
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:49,144
The first time it happened,
it hardly occurred to me

1404
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:50,537
that you'd host a party.

1405
01:01:50,637 --> 01:01:52,806
I mean, you didn't even
know anyone here.

1406
01:01:52,906 --> 01:01:54,507
But I misjudged.

1407
01:01:54,608 --> 01:01:56,253
You know, maybe you're having
a harder time adjusting

1408
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:57,511
than I thought.

1409
01:01:57,612 --> 01:01:59,647
But now I'm here to be
the good mom I need to be.

1410
01:01:59,747 --> 01:02:01,683
Mom, that's great,
but I didn't have a party.

1411
01:02:01,783 --> 01:02:03,227
And even though
I'm a sympathetic mom,

1412
01:02:03,251 --> 01:02:04,519
you are grounded.

1413
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,254
You're grounded for a week.

1414
01:02:06,354 --> 01:02:08,200
And if we need to get you
some alcohol education...

1415
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,159
I don't drink!
I didn't have a party!

1416
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,729
- Then who did?
- Some guys I know!

1417
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:16,400
- Dead guys.
- I knew it.

1418
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,535
Mom, we do
have a ghost in this house,

1419
01:02:18,636 --> 01:02:20,338
and he's really cute, and

1420
01:02:20,438 --> 01:02:22,249
even though he won't
go to Homecoming with me,

1421
01:02:22,273 --> 01:02:24,075
he's really sweet.

1422
01:02:24,976 --> 01:02:27,479
Is this one of
those internet scams?

1423
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,915
Those idiots back in Spring Lake

1424
01:02:29,015 --> 01:02:31,183
make up some fake
online boyfriend for you?

1425
01:02:31,283 --> 01:02:32,886
- I swear, I...
- Fake online boyfriend?

1426
01:02:32,986 --> 01:02:35,956
He's real!
He and his friends cleaned up the mess.

1427
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:37,758
Go in there and look!
It's spotless!

1428
01:02:37,858 --> 01:02:39,293
You know
I'm a crappy cleaner-upper.

1429
01:02:39,393 --> 01:02:41,596
Honey, this is worse
than I thought.

1430
01:02:41,696 --> 01:02:43,473
You must miss your
Spring Lake friends so much

1431
01:02:43,497 --> 01:02:46,068
that you're makin' up
imaginary ones.

1432
01:02:46,168 --> 01:02:47,369
And you miss Taylor,

1433
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:50,974
so you've conjured up
an imaginary boyfriend!

1434
01:02:51,074 --> 01:02:52,551
Listen, I can get you
into counseling.

1435
01:02:52,575 --> 01:02:54,811
I should've known
you wouldn't understand.

1436
01:02:54,911 --> 01:02:57,114
Mom, I am making
real friends here,

1437
01:02:57,214 --> 01:02:59,016
and I like a real guy,

1438
01:02:59,116 --> 01:03:00,818
and it's more than a crush.

1439
01:03:00,918 --> 01:03:02,520
I actually know him, and

1440
01:03:02,621 --> 01:03:07,192
we have these super long
interesting conversations, and

1441
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:09,262
he's like my soulmate,

1442
01:03:09,362 --> 01:03:10,830
but it's complicated.

1443
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,265
I get it.

1444
01:03:12,365 --> 01:03:15,703
It's natural to fantasize about
a boy who doesn't really exist.

1445
01:03:15,803 --> 01:03:16,843
Who you can't really have.

1446
01:03:16,904 --> 01:03:18,172
That's not what this is!

1447
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:20,275
Ever since your dad and I
started to unravel,

1448
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:23,111
I keep going back to when I was
even younger than you.

1449
01:03:23,211 --> 01:03:26,115
I keep thinking about this boy
I met at summer camp.

1450
01:03:26,215 --> 01:03:27,655
He was a counselor
on the boy's side,

1451
01:03:27,717 --> 01:03:28,885
and I was on the girl's side.

1452
01:03:28,985 --> 01:03:30,286
Maybe you need the counseling.

1453
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:31,821
He was kind of a bad boy,

1454
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:34,200
but one of those bad boys who's
actually smart and sensitive.

1455
01:03:34,224 --> 01:03:35,358
You know?

1456
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:38,129
I never saw him again
after I was 15.

1457
01:03:38,229 --> 01:03:39,998
I thought about him
all through college,

1458
01:03:40,098 --> 01:03:41,108
in high school, and even...

1459
01:03:41,132 --> 01:03:42,934
Mom, you don't get it!

1460
01:03:43,034 --> 01:03:44,503
I'm talking about a guy

1461
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:46,939
who I actually see every day,
and

1462
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,974
you're pining for some

1463
01:03:49,074 --> 01:03:51,111
guy from when you were 15.

1464
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:53,113
You're middle aged!

1465
01:03:53,847 --> 01:03:56,017
I mean, I'm sad Dad left, too.

1466
01:03:56,117 --> 01:03:58,052
You're the one with
the imaginary boyfriend.

1467
01:03:58,152 --> 01:03:59,453
He's not imaginary!

1468
01:03:59,553 --> 01:04:00,855
Then when can I meet him?

1469
01:04:00,955 --> 01:04:01,955
You can't!

1470
01:04:02,991 --> 01:04:06,729
I mean, you can't even see him.
Most people can't.

1471
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:09,265
I'm callin' in the morning
to get you into counseling.

1472
01:04:11,067 --> 01:04:14,004
So, I need you to reveal
yourself to my mom.

1473
01:04:14,104 --> 01:04:15,716
I thought you were
gonna tell her about me.

1474
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:17,574
She thinks I made you up.

1475
01:04:17,674 --> 01:04:19,143
So?

1476
01:04:19,243 --> 01:04:22,848
So, she's so intense, and...
I dunno...

1477
01:04:22,948 --> 01:04:25,150
She's selfish and insensitive.

1478
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,385
Can't you see that?

1479
01:04:26,485 --> 01:04:28,788
I guess I don't really pay
that much attention to her.

1480
01:04:28,888 --> 01:04:29,922
Why not?

1481
01:04:30,022 --> 01:04:31,891
I dunno.
I mean, she's a grown-up.

1482
01:04:31,992 --> 01:04:34,995
I like hanging out with you.
We're the same age.

1483

Are we?

1484
01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:38,366
Yeah, I'm 17 and you're 16.

1485
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:40,334
Yeah, but if you hadn't...

1486
01:04:40,434 --> 01:04:41,870

Oh, my God, I never
thought about that before.

1491
01:04:53,149 --> 01:04:55,589

01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:56,233
and an old man came, and said,

1572
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,402
"Where did you get that scarf?!"

1573
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:01,505
That scarf belonged
to me daughter, Vicky...

1574
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:03,175
She died ten years ago

1575
01:09:03,275 --> 01:09:05,310
on Halloween Night.

1576
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,946
- Oh, my God!
- Tell us another one, Adam!

1577
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:11,117
Keepin' an eye out for bad guys
dressed as 12-year-old kids,

1578
01:09:11,217 --> 01:09:13,052
dressed as monsters, Detective?

1579
01:09:13,152 --> 01:09:16,190
Mrs. Papalooski!

1580
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:18,692
Poplawski!

1581
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:20,095
Or Jensen...

1582
01:09:20,195 --> 01:09:22,097
Better yet, just Carol.

1583
01:09:22,197 --> 01:09:23,564
Carol it is, then.

1584
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:24,664
Pete.

1585
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:29,271
Z-Dog, what kind of readings
are you getting on the PEX?

1586
01:09:29,371 --> 01:09:31,507
Big readings, Billy.
Big readings.

1587
01:09:31,607 --> 01:09:34,344
Either we've just found
a big convergence of ghosts,

1588
01:09:34,444 --> 01:09:36,513
or we finally found
the one they call...

1589
01:09:36,613 --> 01:09:37,915
Vladimir.

1590
01:09:42,286 --> 01:09:43,621
Oh, dude!

1591
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:45,724
That costume's outrageous, man!

1592
01:09:45,824 --> 01:09:48,560
You look like an actual
dead evil badass, dude!

1593
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,096
It is not a costume.

1594
01:09:50,196 --> 01:09:51,764
Oh, I respect that, man.

1595
01:09:51,864 --> 01:09:53,266
That's cool.
Stayin' in character.

1596
01:09:53,366 --> 01:09:55,702
I like it! I'm Squatchie!

1597
01:09:55,802 --> 01:09:57,070
I am Vladimir.

1598
01:09:59,973 --> 01:10:02,110
These PEX readings
are off the charts.

1599
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,045
Madame Lidnar always
talked about this.

1600
01:10:04,146 --> 01:10:06,148
We may be stumbling onto an HCH.

1601
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:07,282
An HCH?

1602
01:10:07,382 --> 01:10:09,385
A Halloween Convergence
of Haunters.

1603
01:10:09,485 --> 01:10:12,188
If only Zak were here
to see this.

1604
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:15,958
You guys!

1605
01:10:16,726 --> 01:10:19,730
Maybe this is the year
that we encounter.

1606
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:23,401
Chicagoland's most legendary
evil ghost,

1607
01:10:23,501 --> 01:10:24,835
Vlad the Bad.

1608
01:10:25,636 --> 01:10:27,506
- Let's go around back.
- Okay.

1609
01:10:29,408 --> 01:10:31,377
So, a lot of these parents,

1610
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,614
they like it when their kids
are watched by a cop, right?

1611
01:10:34,714 --> 01:10:37,317
So, they go downtown
to their trendy restaurants,

1612
01:10:37,417 --> 01:10:38,519
and stuff,

1613
01:10:38,619 --> 01:10:39,987
and I take the kids

1614
01:10:40,087 --> 01:10:42,022
to the soccer game

1615
01:10:42,122 --> 01:10:44,293
to the batting cages

1616
01:10:44,393 --> 01:10:46,094
to the Halloween party.

1617
01:10:46,195 --> 01:10:50,132
Well, you know, this
Halloween party isn't all kids.

1618
01:10:50,233 --> 01:10:52,802
It's not exactly crawlin'
with single women

1619
01:10:52,902 --> 01:10:55,371
in sexy witch costumes, either.

1620
01:10:55,471 --> 01:10:57,374
Are you prowlin'
this Halloween party for dates?

1621
01:10:57,474 --> 01:10:59,109
I mean,
I thought you were married.

1622
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,911
Uh, no, ma'am. No, ma'am.

1623
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:02,180
Not married.

1624
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,715
Used to be.

1625
01:11:03,815 --> 01:11:05,983
That worked out about as well
as my last diet.

1626
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:07,786
It was great for a week.

1627
01:11:10,256 --> 01:11:13,125
You have any trouble with
juvenile delinquents lately?

1628
01:11:13,226 --> 01:11:14,628
Or ghosts?

1629
01:11:15,662 --> 01:11:18,198
Funny, uh, no, actually.

1630
01:11:18,298 --> 01:11:21,101
My daughter's havin' a little
trouble adjusting here, but...

1631
01:11:21,202 --> 01:11:23,838
I can tell you there's no
ghosts or partying teenagers

1632
01:11:23,938 --> 01:11:25,240
in my house.

1633
01:11:32,949 --> 01:11:35,385
Oh, sprits,
on this hallowed night,

1634
01:11:35,485 --> 01:11:38,055
let me hear and see you, too.

1635
01:11:38,155 --> 01:11:40,891
Give me access, take no flight!

1636
01:11:40,991 --> 01:11:42,926
Let me sit and chat with you!

1637
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:49,334
♪

1638
01:11:53,606 --> 01:11:57,043
I am sensing
many strong spirit presences.

1639
01:11:57,143 --> 01:11:59,313
Have either of you noticed
any ghosts here tonight?

1640
01:11:59,413 --> 01:12:01,348
There's ghosts everywhere!

1641
01:12:01,448 --> 01:12:03,585
And monsters, and witches,

1642
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:05,887
and scary clowns. It's awesome!

1643
01:12:05,987 --> 01:12:07,890
Hey, great weird
old lady costume!

1644
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,325
Real lifelike.

1645
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,928
I am merely a neighbor

1646
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,865
chaperoning this gathering
of souls.

1647
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:17,834
I'm looking to connect
with some spirits,

1648
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:20,204
and I sense
there are spirits about.

1649
01:12:20,305 --> 01:12:22,039
Have you seen
anything unusual tonight?

1650
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:24,742
Ladies and gentlemen!

1651
01:12:26,545 --> 01:12:27,746
Please be quiet.

1652
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:29,557
Dude, we
were listenin' to that song!

1653
01:12:29,581 --> 01:12:31,249
Chill out, sasquatch!

1654
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:33,720
Squatch? I knew it!

1655
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:36,022
We are the men and hot woman
of SPIT,

1656
01:12:36,122 --> 01:12:38,125
the Super Paranormal
Investigation Team.

1657
01:12:38,225 --> 01:12:41,895
Chicagoland's paramount
paranormal investigators!

1658
01:12:41,995 --> 01:12:43,898
Ugh. Not again.

1659
01:12:43,998 --> 01:12:45,718
We're here because
we have reason to believe

1660
01:12:45,767 --> 01:12:48,770
that this party is a Halloween
Convergence of Haunters.

1661
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,740
Right on!
It's a Halloween party, dude!

1662
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,542
And we were having a good time

1663
01:12:52,642 --> 01:12:55,144
until you fools came in here
and turned off the music!

1664
01:12:55,244 --> 01:12:58,281
Uh, don't you have to go hang
out with some other old people?

1665
01:12:58,382 --> 01:12:59,862
We already threw you
out of here once,

1666
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:01,390
and nobody invited you
to this party.

1667
01:13:01,485 --> 01:13:02,486
Don't worry.

1668
01:13:02,554 --> 01:13:05,056
We won't charge you a dime
for our work.

1669
01:13:05,156 --> 01:13:08,427
We're just here to capture
all of your haunters

1670
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:09,628
on the house.

1671
01:13:09,728 --> 01:13:11,464
I told you guys before,

1672
01:13:11,564 --> 01:13:12,965
get out of here!

1673
01:13:13,065 --> 01:13:14,133
That voice!

1674
01:13:15,301 --> 01:13:17,179
That's the same haunter
that kicked us out last time!

1675
01:13:17,203 --> 01:13:18,472
Should I nail him, Billy?!

1676
01:13:18,572 --> 01:13:19,840
Bag this paranormal punk.

1677
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,609
You'll bag nothing.

1678
01:13:23,478 --> 01:13:26,314
We're the Super Paranormal
Investigation Team...

1679
01:13:26,415 --> 01:13:28,417
Who are you,
lame Halloween costume guy?

1680
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:30,386
I am Vladimir Cadeaux,

1681
01:13:30,486 --> 01:13:33,790
founder and protector
of the Halloween Convergence,

1682
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:36,993
and you buffoons will leave now,

1683
01:13:37,093 --> 01:13:38,996
or feel the wrath
of the haunters.

1684
01:13:39,096 --> 01:13:40,263
I knew it.

1685
01:13:40,364 --> 01:13:41,499
These dudes are awesome!

1686
01:13:41,599 --> 01:13:44,035
This is the coolest
Halloween party ever!

1687
01:13:44,135 --> 01:13:46,270
Mr. Vladimir... Hi!

1688
01:13:46,371 --> 01:13:49,007
We-we're actually here
to see you,

1689
01:13:49,107 --> 01:13:52,645
uh, and observe
your convergence.

1690
01:13:52,745 --> 01:13:54,380
And, uh... Bag him, Zeke!

1691
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,816
Whoa! Whoa!

1692
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:57,551
No need to bag any ghosts, man!

1693
01:13:57,651 --> 01:13:59,185
These haunters mean you no harm.

1694
01:13:59,285 --> 01:14:01,054
I have had enough of your crap,

1695
01:14:01,154 --> 01:14:02,990
you teenage ghost punk!

1696
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:05,493
I'm gonna bag me a sasquatch!

1697
01:14:05,593 --> 01:14:06,994
Ah! Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

1698
01:14:07,094 --> 01:14:09,097
- You're mine, you squatch!
- What are you doing?!

1699
01:14:09,197 --> 01:14:10,599
You idiots!

1700
01:14:10,699 --> 01:14:11,600
You don't go around
attacking people

1701
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,402
just because they're different!

1702
01:14:13,503 --> 01:14:15,405
These haunters
only wanna coexist!

1703
01:14:15,505 --> 01:14:17,741
Tonight, these haunter hunters

1704
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:21,311
are going to have to coexist
in captivity.

1705
01:14:21,412 --> 01:14:23,881
Rope them, haunters!

1706
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:25,261
Oh!
That's what he meant by rope!

1707
01:14:25,315 --> 01:14:27,495
That's what he meant by rope!
That's what he meant by rope!

1708
01:14:30,456 --> 01:14:32,525
All right, let's get the party
back on!

1709
01:14:36,028 --> 01:14:41,101
You are brave and wise
multi-dimensional woman.

1710
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:46,274
And you are one sexy,
handsome haunter.

1711
01:14:49,043 --> 01:14:51,313
♪

1712
01:14:52,147 --> 01:14:55,117
I am Goose Hair.
What is your name?

1713
01:14:55,217 --> 01:14:56,419
Kourtney.

1714
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,387
Hi.

1715
01:14:57,488 --> 01:14:58,655
Hey, look.

1716
01:14:59,923 --> 01:15:01,167
She's a little tied up at the
moment right now, buddy, okay?

1717
01:15:01,191 --> 01:15:03,695
So, why don't you just...
You know?

1718
01:15:15,609 --> 01:15:19,112
Out! Everyone out now!

1719
01:15:19,212 --> 01:15:20,648
Who's that lady?

1720
01:15:20,748 --> 01:15:22,016
Who said "lady"?

1721
01:15:22,116 --> 01:15:23,017
Who said that?!

1722
01:15:23,117 --> 01:15:25,754
I live here! This is my house!

1723
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,757
And I say everyone out now!

1724
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,358
And I say it, too.

1725
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:31,861
And I'm the police.

1726
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:35,131
I know you. I know your parents.

1727
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:36,866
I know you.
Who the hell was that?

1728
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:38,335
I know you.

1729
01:15:38,435 --> 01:15:40,671
Who's that? I know your parents.

1730
01:15:52,184 --> 01:15:53,719
Carol, you want alex and me
to stay

1731
01:15:53,819 --> 01:15:55,622
and help clean up this mess?

1732
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:58,291
Wow, full service police backup.

1733
01:15:58,391 --> 01:15:59,960
The OPPD will not only break up

1734
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,763
your wild, illegal
teenage party,

1735
01:16:01,863 --> 01:16:03,865
they'll clean it up, too.

1736
01:16:03,965 --> 01:16:05,900
I'm just tryin' to help, Carol.

1737
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,737
Very sweet, Pete, but I think
you better go.

1738
01:16:08,837 --> 01:16:10,114
Can't have
the Chief of Detectives

1739
01:16:10,138 --> 01:16:12,975
be a witness
when I strangle my daughter.

1740
01:16:13,075 --> 01:16:14,878
Well, maybe anyway,
this explains the

1741
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:17,346
beer bottles,
and the cigarettes, and the...

1742
01:16:17,446 --> 01:16:18,481
Anyway.

1743
01:16:18,582 --> 01:16:21,185
Uh, you still have my card
if I can be helpful.

1744
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:24,655
Yeah, the one with your home
number scribbled on the back.

1745
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:29,027
All right, all right.

1746
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,062
Hap-happy Halloween.

1747
01:16:32,932 --> 01:16:34,200
Good luck.

1748
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:35,802
Take care.

1749
01:16:41,809 --> 01:16:44,979
Amanda Louise Poplawski,
you are in so much trouble!

1750
01:16:45,079 --> 01:16:47,181
Okay, I can explain.
You know the guy that I said...

1751
01:16:47,281 --> 01:16:48,349
I don't wanna hear it!

1752
01:16:48,449 --> 01:16:50,953
I can't even stand
to hear you talk right now!

1753
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:53,188
Everything was finally
starting to go okay,

1754
01:16:53,288 --> 01:16:55,124
and then you pull this,
and you lie to me,

1755
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:56,259
and you embarrass me

1756
01:16:56,359 --> 01:16:58,528
in front of the guy I li...
The cops!

1757
01:16:58,629 --> 01:17:00,230
This was the only opportunity
I had

1758
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:02,399
for my haunter friends
to meet my 3D friends.

1759
01:17:02,499 --> 01:17:04,769
I knew it!
She was cavorting with ghosts!

1760
01:17:04,869 --> 01:17:06,570
Amanda, get upstairs!

1761
01:17:06,671 --> 01:17:08,073
Go to your room now!

1762
01:17:08,173 --> 01:17:10,075
I don't even want you
in the same room with me!

1763
01:17:10,175 --> 01:17:11,452
Don't you want me
to help clean up?

1764
01:17:11,476 --> 01:17:13,036
Oh, you'll clean it up tomorrow
all day.

1765
01:17:13,111 --> 01:17:15,014
You're gonna be grounded
for life!

1766
01:17:15,114 --> 01:17:16,754
But Mother,
she was cavorting with ghosts!

1767
01:17:16,816 --> 01:17:18,217
You get upstairs, too!

1768
01:17:31,099 --> 01:17:33,202
Oh, I've got a ghost boyfriend.

1769
01:17:33,302 --> 01:17:35,805
I can't go to the Halloween
party with you and Adam.

1770
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:37,607
I'm gonna go
to the cheerleading party

1771
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,710
at Jasmine's house. Ugh.

1772
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:42,179
Well, she wasn't lying
about the ghost boyfriend.

1773
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:43,481
Who are...

1774
01:17:44,515 --> 01:17:46,450
Kid, I-I-I don't know
who you are, but...

1775
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:48,452
I just threw everybody out,
and...

1776
01:17:48,552 --> 01:17:49,833
Detective McGarry's my friend.

1777
01:17:49,922 --> 01:17:52,191
Yeah, but I live here.

1778
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:53,458
I don't care where you live!

1779
01:17:53,558 --> 01:17:55,060
I'm callin' the cops!

1780
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,331
Yeah, but I live here
in this house.

1781
01:17:58,431 --> 01:17:59,431
Right.

1782
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:00,801
I'm callin' 'em right now.

1783
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:03,504
Look, Mrs. Poplawski,

1784
01:18:03,604 --> 01:18:05,206
I'm Amanda's boyfriend,

1785
01:18:06,073 --> 01:18:07,776
and I'm a ghost.

1786
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:09,644
Brian Flynn.

1787
01:18:09,745 --> 01:18:11,113
But I'm not gonna hurt you.

1788
01:18:11,213 --> 01:18:12,614
You're Brian Flynn.

1789
01:18:14,851 --> 01:18:17,186
Did Amanda tell you my name?

1790
01:18:18,254 --> 01:18:19,757
You don't remember me?

1791
01:18:21,191 --> 01:18:22,192
Well...

1792
01:18:23,493 --> 01:18:25,934
I've seen you around the house
since you guys moved in, but...

1793
01:18:27,098 --> 01:18:28,599
You're Amanda's mom.

1794
01:18:29,234 --> 01:18:31,670
Do I look that different?

1795
01:18:31,771 --> 01:18:32,805
Or is it just that

1796
01:18:32,905 --> 01:18:35,441
I wasn't as big a deal to you
as you were to me?

1797
01:18:36,876 --> 01:18:39,713
Dude, I'm Carol Jensen!

1798
01:18:39,813 --> 01:18:41,681
You taught me to play guitar!

1799
01:18:41,782 --> 01:18:44,185
You taught me
about music and life!

1800
01:18:44,285 --> 01:18:45,965
Because of you,
I was the only ninth grader

1801
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,356
in Spring Lake, Michigan,
who walked around to parties

1802
01:18:48,456 --> 01:18:52,527
carrying London Calling
and Rocket to Russia!

1803
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,563
You're reggae Carol?

1804
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:58,869
You look so diff...

1805
01:18:58,969 --> 01:18:59,870
Are you kidding?

1806
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:01,438
You're making out
with my boyfriend?!

1807
01:19:01,538 --> 01:19:03,140
Amanda, it's not like that!

1808
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,877
Why were you making out
with my mother, you liar?!

1809
01:19:05,977 --> 01:19:09,915
All that about music,
and-and how I'm special,

1810
01:19:10,015 --> 01:19:12,384
and how Taylor
shouldn't have hurt me!

1811
01:19:12,484 --> 01:19:13,996
I have no idea
what you're talking about!

1812
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,297
You don't know
what you're talking about!

1813
01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:16,923
I'm trying to tell you...

1814
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:19,359
Wait, where's Brian?

1815
01:19:19,459 --> 01:19:21,228
- Brian?
- Brian!

1816
01:19:21,328 --> 01:19:23,463
- Brian?
- Brian!

1817
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:25,065
Brian?

1818
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:41,718
Hey.

1819
01:19:51,496 --> 01:19:53,398
I get why you're mad.

1820
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:56,369
- Mom.
- I totally get how you feel about Brian.

1821
01:19:56,469 --> 01:19:58,438
For so many years,
I've hated myself

1822
01:19:58,538 --> 01:20:00,473
for all the things I didn't do.

1823
01:20:02,309 --> 01:20:03,710
You raised Adam and me.

1824
01:20:03,811 --> 01:20:05,412
I mean, I know
we're not perfect, but

1825
01:20:05,512 --> 01:20:06,623
if it hadn't been for you

1826
01:20:06,647 --> 01:20:08,150
we wouldn't even be pretty good.

1827
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,318
Oh, you and Adam are the best.

1828
01:20:10,418 --> 01:20:12,921
I love you both so much.

1829
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:14,723
But it's easier
to be jealous of your kids,

1830
01:20:14,824 --> 01:20:16,325
or-or resent your husband,

1831
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:17,769
than it is to admit
that there's stuff

1832
01:20:17,793 --> 01:20:19,629
that you could've
done differently, and,

1833
01:20:19,729 --> 01:20:22,132
and it's nobody's fault
but your own.

1834
01:20:22,232 --> 01:20:23,567
My own.

1835
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:26,271
So you kinda compared Dad
to Brian?

1836
01:20:26,371 --> 01:20:27,372
Yeah.

1837
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:29,607
How unfair is that?

1838
01:20:29,707 --> 01:20:31,310
I was married to a real person,

1839
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,880
and all I could do was compare
him to a sweet bad boy

1840
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,882
I knew for two months
when I was 15.

1841
01:20:35,982 --> 01:20:37,550
Doesn't justify what Dad did.

1842
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:41,221
No, but in the beginning,
he tried to be a good husband.

1843
01:20:41,321 --> 01:20:44,325
Oh, you did what any girl
in love would do.

1844
01:20:44,425 --> 01:20:46,294
I'm surprised you didn't hit me.

1845
01:20:47,495 --> 01:20:49,364
Want me to hit you now?

1846
01:20:50,065 --> 01:20:51,633
A hug, instead.

1847
01:20:59,876 --> 01:21:02,179
You think we'll ever
see him again?

1848
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:03,380
I don't know.

1849
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,550
Uh, he usually appears
when I call for him, which...

1850
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:08,853
I did like a hundred times
last night.

1851
01:21:08,954 --> 01:21:10,288
No response.

1852
01:21:10,388 --> 01:21:12,424
- Nope.
- Hi.

1853
01:21:13,759 --> 01:21:15,128
Have you been
standing there long?

1854
01:21:15,228 --> 01:21:18,231
No, I just got here.
I was over at Hal's.

1855
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:19,900
We weren't sure
you were coming back.

1856
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,801
Yeah, neither was I,

1857
01:21:21,902 --> 01:21:24,104
but I had to see
that you guys were both okay.

1858
01:21:24,204 --> 01:21:25,582
Well, you can just
hang out with me.

1859
01:21:25,606 --> 01:21:26,807
We're the same age.

1860
01:21:26,908 --> 01:21:29,210
Yeah, but... Amanda

1861
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,313
to do that, I have to stay here

1862
01:21:31,413 --> 01:21:32,614
and keep haunting this house,

1863
01:21:32,714 --> 01:21:35,451
and playing cards with
my haunter friends, but...

1864
01:21:35,551 --> 01:21:37,019
You have to grow up,

1865
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,423
and move on,
and go to college, and

1866
01:21:40,523 --> 01:21:42,492
have an actual life.

1867
01:21:44,662 --> 01:21:47,431
You're a really cool girl,
Amanda,

1868
01:21:47,531 --> 01:21:51,770
and you're gonna be a really
cool grown-up 3D woman.

1869
01:21:55,175 --> 01:21:57,677
It's... probably my friends.

1870
01:21:58,444 --> 01:21:59,912
Hello!

1871
01:22:00,013 --> 01:22:03,384
Amanda, Mrs. Pallapalooski...

1872
01:22:03,484 --> 01:22:06,153
We want to extend our thanks
for last night's soirée.

1873
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:08,890
I know we can all agree
that last night's party

1874
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:10,959
was the greatest party
we've ever attended.

1875
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:12,694
Who's at the door?

1876
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,364
Why, what have we here?

1877
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:18,067
Teen ruffians
still clad in costume.

1878
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:19,403
Too late!

1879
01:22:19,503 --> 01:22:21,538
My delinquent sister
already cleaned up the mess

1880
01:22:21,638 --> 01:22:23,073
you hooligans made.

1881
01:22:23,173 --> 01:22:24,474
Hello, Adam.

1882
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:26,777
Do I know you?

1883
01:22:26,877 --> 01:22:28,613
I don't recall meeting,

1884
01:22:28,713 --> 01:22:31,183
but your face seems familiar.

1885
01:22:31,283 --> 01:22:32,418
Adam, this is Brian.

1886
01:22:32,518 --> 01:22:34,486
He's the ghost
that haunts our house.

1887
01:22:34,586 --> 01:22:36,722
The nocturnal guitarist!
I knew it!

1888
01:22:36,822 --> 01:22:38,125
And these are my friends,

1889
01:22:38,225 --> 01:22:41,461
Hal, Suzy Q, Goose Hair,
Earl, Zebulon.

1890
01:22:41,561 --> 01:22:43,030
They're not wearing costumes,
either.

1891
01:22:43,131 --> 01:22:45,066
Neptune's trident!

1892
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:47,206
I was suspecting that you
were cavorting with, uh

1893
01:22:47,268 --> 01:22:50,939
a netherworld punk, but we're
overrun with specters!

1894
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,307
Brian, we talked.

1895
01:22:52,407 --> 01:22:54,276
We're all gonna do it.

1896
01:22:54,376 --> 01:22:56,046
You guys are the best.

1897
01:22:56,146 --> 01:22:58,714
- Let's hop it works.
- What? Do what?

1898
01:22:59,882 --> 01:23:02,186
We're gonna try to leave.

1899
01:23:02,286 --> 01:23:03,587
Leave where?

1900
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:06,290
Hal and Zebulon and Goose Hair
used to know a haunter,

1901
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:08,526
back around 1930.

1902
01:23:08,626 --> 01:23:09,626
She left.

1903
01:23:10,562 --> 01:23:12,664
She used to hang an old
dance hall that's long gone.

1904
01:23:12,764 --> 01:23:13,999
Her name was Mary,

1905
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,502
and she was as pretty
as a petunia.

1906
01:23:16,602 --> 01:23:18,337
She was
always tryin' to leave.

1907
01:23:18,437 --> 01:23:20,107
She didn't wanna be a haunter.

1908
01:23:20,207 --> 01:23:22,809
She'd always stand out
on Oak Park Avenue,

1909
01:23:22,909 --> 01:23:26,081
and bum rides off of 3Ds
that could see her.

1910
01:23:26,181 --> 01:23:29,650
But she'd always
end up back at the dance hall.

1911
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,153
Then, one year,
there was a party

1912
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:33,622
at the dance hall
for Halloween, and

1913
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:35,357
everyone could see her.

1914
01:23:35,457 --> 01:23:39,496
Mary must've danced with
a dozen fellows that night.

1915
01:23:39,596 --> 01:23:41,798
And the next day,
on All Saint's Day

1916
01:23:42,732 --> 01:23:44,768
all the 3Ds could still see her.

1917
01:23:44,868 --> 01:23:46,904
Just like you can see us now.

1918
01:23:47,004 --> 01:23:48,582
Apparently one of the guys
came back to the dance hall

1919
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,375
and took Mary out for a date.

1920
01:23:50,475 --> 01:23:53,878
After lunch, old Mary
and this 3D fellow

1921
01:23:53,978 --> 01:23:56,682
went to a field behind
the big new movie house,

1922
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,518
and there...

1923
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:00,720
Vladimir was lurking about.

1924
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:02,389
And I said, "Jeepers!

1925
01:24:02,489 --> 01:24:04,991
Don't go near Vlad the Bad!"

1926
01:24:05,092 --> 01:24:07,729
And then, she looks at Vlad,

1927
01:24:07,829 --> 01:24:09,597
and then she said
she's moving on,

1928
01:24:09,697 --> 01:24:11,366
and said goodbye.

1929
01:24:12,334 --> 01:24:14,637
Then, she disappeared.

1930
01:24:14,737 --> 01:24:16,405
We never seen

1931
01:24:16,505 --> 01:24:18,774
old Dance Hall Mary ever again.

1932
01:24:18,874 --> 01:24:21,411
Well, where did she go?

1933
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:22,779
The next place, kid.

1934
01:24:22,879 --> 01:24:25,850
Wherever people go when they
finally leave this place.

1935
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:29,754
A bit later, a post card was
sent to our house, addressed to...

1936
01:24:29,854 --> 01:24:31,790
Zebulon and me.

1937
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:33,125
What did it say?

1938
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:35,427
"Dear Hal and Zebulon...

1939
01:24:35,527 --> 01:24:37,130
It's heavenly here.

1940
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:38,965
See you around.

1941
01:24:39,065 --> 01:24:40,500
Love, Mary."

1942
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,601
So...

1943
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:45,072
We're all gonna try to do
what Dance Hall Mary did.

1944
01:24:45,173 --> 01:24:47,074
What?
You're just gonna disappear?

1945
01:24:47,175 --> 01:24:49,844
But, y...
I mean, you and I are in...

1946
01:24:49,944 --> 01:24:52,914
You like it here.
You get to play your guitar in the rain.

1947
01:24:53,014 --> 01:24:54,014
Amanda, I was wrong.

1948
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:56,662
I don't stay here and play
my guitar in the rain

1949
01:24:56,686 --> 01:24:57,686
because I love it.

1950
01:24:58,521 --> 01:24:59,865
I do it because
I'm reenacting that night,

1951
01:24:59,889 --> 01:25:01,033
because I wish I didn't do that.

1952
01:25:01,057 --> 01:25:04,161
I wish it didn't happen like that.
I wish...

1953
01:25:04,261 --> 01:25:06,096
Maybe I just wish
it was still 1986,

1954
01:25:06,197 --> 01:25:08,800
and I was 17, and I was
just riding my skateboard

1955
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,602
and playing guitar, but...

1956
01:25:11,536 --> 01:25:14,173
But it's not. It's not 1986.

1957
01:25:14,273 --> 01:25:15,441
It's not gonna be today,

1958
01:25:15,541 --> 01:25:17,576
and it's not
gonna be 1986 tomorrow,

1959
01:25:17,676 --> 01:25:20,847
and it's never gonna be 1986
ever again, and...

1960
01:25:22,416 --> 01:25:23,850
And, I don't know, um...

1961
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:26,687
I'm really sorry

1962
01:25:28,789 --> 01:25:30,157
but,

1963
01:25:30,926 --> 01:25:31,927
but it's time.

1964
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:34,696
How do you guys know
this is gonna work?

1965
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,865
- We don't, but...
- But we all agree.

1966
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:38,335
We gotta try.

1967
01:25:38,435 --> 01:25:41,538
We found out let night
that Vlad the Bad is

1968
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:42,739
good.

1969
01:25:42,839 --> 01:25:44,308
He's the portal keeper.

1970
01:25:44,408 --> 01:25:46,710
He guards a special spot
that helps haunters move on.

1971
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:48,850
If you do disappear,
you don't know where you'll go.

1972
01:25:48,913 --> 01:25:50,315
I mean, that's crazy.

1973
01:25:50,415 --> 01:25:52,517
Uh, no offense, Amanda,
but you know what's crazy?

1974
01:25:52,617 --> 01:25:54,887
Rolling a tire
up and down the block all day.

1975
01:25:54,987 --> 01:25:57,857
Day after day...
year after year.

1976
01:25:57,957 --> 01:25:59,091
You know what's crazy?

1977
01:25:59,725 --> 01:26:01,595
Being in love.

Aw!

Adam, you don't get the floor
all night!

2012
01:28:01,768 --> 01:28:05,872
Come on, toastmaster.
Pick one and go with it.

2013
01:28:05,972 --> 01:28:07,308
To Oak Park,

2014
01:28:07,409 --> 01:28:08,943

Well done. Nice.

2019
01:28:16,952 --> 01:28:18,855
Amanda, did you wanna
make a toast?

2020
01:28:18,955 --> 01:28:21,991
I do, but I'm waiting
for you-know-who.

2021
01:28:22,091 --> 01:28:23,627
Honey, that could be
a very long wait.

2022
01:28:23,727 --> 01:28:25,563
- Are you sure he's coming?
- I know he will.

2023
01:28:25,663 --> 01:28:27,932
Are you certain
he'll show up tonight?

2024
01:28:28,032 --> 01:28:30,200
I'm sure he will.

2025
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,070
It's pretty snowy out the, kid.

2026
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:34,039
A little snow
isn't gonna stop him.

2027
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:36,579
Well, you can't be disappointed
if he doesn't make it tonight.

2028
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:38,545
Okay

2029
01:28:38,645 --> 01:28:39,812
There he is.

2030
01:28:42,482 --> 01:28:43,984

- Hey!

Squatchie, I'm
so glad you made it!

2034
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:52,360
- How's college?
- It's amazing.

How's it goin'?

Yeah.

2038
01:28:58,367 --> 01:28:59,945
So, what's in the box?
Did you bring us something?

2039
01:28:59,969 --> 01:29:01,572
Oh, I actually found this
on the porch.

2040
01:29:01,672 --> 01:29:03,440
I just figured I should
bring it in.

2041
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:04,775

- A card? You got that?
