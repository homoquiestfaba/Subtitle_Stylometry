1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,219
Ladies, gentlemen, and everybody,
put your hands together.

2
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,305
Please welcome to the stage Ali Wong!

3
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,289
Hi, everybody!

4
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,669
We love you, Ali!

5
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,714
Thank you.

6
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:58,516
You know, I'm very jealous and bitter

7
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,686
that when a man finds

8
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,649
any ounce of mainstream success in comedy,

9
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,028
they get to date models,

10
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,908
actresses, and pop singers.

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,955
One of my dear friends is arguably
one of the top stand-up comics

12
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,500
in the world.

13
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,127
And for the past year and a half,

14
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,670
she's been dating

15
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,715
a magician.

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,519
I was like, "Okay,
you know, no judgment, girl,

17
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,898
but is he at least,
like, a good magician?"

18
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,111
"Is he, like, the best magician

19
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,697
like how you are one of
the best stand-up comedians?"

20
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,868
I looked that dude up on Yelp,
he got two stars.

21
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,667
That's what being one of the best
female stand-up comics will achieve you.

22
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,086
A "ain't shit" magician.

23
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:14,717
See, because when you are
a woman with money, power, and respect,

24
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,179
your romantic options do not expand.

25
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,516
They decline!

26
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,230
Now, I am told
it's because men are threatened

27
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,900
by women with money, power, and respect.

28
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,444
What do you think
is going to happen to you, huh?

29
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,824
You think your dick is gonna
get acquired in a hostile takeover?

30
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,288
I bet most men in this theater

31
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,166
have never, ever had your dick sucked

32
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,253
by a woman that makes
a lot more money than you.

33
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,838
And let me tell you something.

34
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,674
It is spectacular, okay?

35
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,633
It is.

36
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,178
It is.

37
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,725
Why wouldn't it be?

38
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,146
If she got the skills
to earn money, power, and respect,

39
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,149
you don't think she got
good pattern recognition?

40
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,153
Those skills transfer.

41
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,950
You should feel so lucky,

42
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,120
so flattered,
so blessed and highly favored,

43
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,124
if you ever had the opportunity
to get your dick sucked

44
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,962
by a woman that makes
a lot more money than you.

45
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,006
Because out of all the things

46
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:39,260
this important woman
could be doing with her valuable time…

47
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,058
Yeah.

48
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,896
All of her responsibilities,

49
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,317
all the interesting opportunities
and deals knocking at her door,

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,360
but no.

51
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,029
She chose to get on her knees

52
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:02,116
and stick your
$40,000-a-year dick in her mouth…

53
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,916
in your Toyota Yaris.

54
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,008
But no. None of you,

55
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,346
not a single man in here
knows what it's like

56
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,599
to cum on the face of a millionaire.

57
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,063
Sure, you've gotten head.

58
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:36,025
But have you ejaculated
onto a great American mind?

59
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:44,158
Has your sperm swam
in the eyes of an icon?

60
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,791
Have you been deep-throated
by a voice of a generation?

61
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,293
I don't think so!

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,803
It's highly unlikely that any man in here…

63
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,556
Well, any straight man in here,

64
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:12,395
knows what it's like
to cum on the face of a millionaire.

65
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:18,651
First of all, how many female, self-made
millionaires are there to begin with?

66
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,570
And then out of that pool,

67
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,698
how many of them
gonna let you cum on their face?

68
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,491
There's three of us, okay?

69
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,704
Yeah, I don't even know
who the other two are.

70
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,457
You think Ellen gonna
let you cum on her face?

71
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,337
You think Oprah gonna let you go to
Montecito and stomp on all her vegetables?

72
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,765
I love

73
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,518
to get cummed on, on the face.

74
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,939
I do.

75
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,318
Because it's so nasty

76
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,653
and is so easy.

77
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:07,742
It is so easy, especially when
you compare it to sucking dick,

78
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,912
which is so physically taxing.

79
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,665
The choking, the eyes watering.

80
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:19,045
And if you really want to keep it 100,
you got to add the pepper grinding.

81
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,922
A lot, you know?

82
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:39,023
Whenever I get a deep tissue massage,
the masseuse is always like,

83
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,611
"Do you sit and work
at a computer all day?"

84
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,783
I'm like, "No, I sucked dick last night."

85
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,743
"Now I can't look to the left."

86
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,964
So in addition to all of that labor,

87
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,929
when you suck dick, there is all of
this performing and pretending involved.

88
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,015
You have to tell all of these lies.

89
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,644
"This is the biggest dick
I've ever had in my mouth."

90
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,273
"I love sucking your cock.
It makes my pussy so wet."

91
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,192
"Yummy!"

92
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,416
But you have to tell the lies

93
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,377
to make the man cum faster.

94
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,848
The lies will set you free!

95
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,152
But then when you get cummed on
on the face,

96
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,821
your only job as the woman

97
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,074
is to make an enthusiastic expression.

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,120
And then your other assignment

99
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,332
is to not laugh…

100
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:27,256
while this grown-ass man
is straddling your rib cage,

101
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,551
he looking down at you,
you looking up at him,

102
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,804
and you see him
from this very unflattering angle

103
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:38,100
where he got
that Jabba the Hutt double chin, you know?

104
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,230
He all possessed by the Holy Spirit.

105
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:48,027
"Look at me, Mommy, watch me,
pay attention, look at me!"

106
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,968
Young men in particular,

107
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:16,138
they don't like women
with money, power, and respect,

108
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:21,185
because they know you can't
tell that kind of woman what to do.

109
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:29,151
Young men want a woman that's chill.

110
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:34,365
That's a quality in a partner
that they seek out and brag about.

111
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,826
"Bro, I'm dating this new chick."

112
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,911
"She's so chill."

113
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,665
"She doesn't give a fuck
about what I do 'cause she's chill."

114
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,086
"She lets me do whatever I want
'cause she's dead inside."

115
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,379
"She's chill."

116
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,799
"She's like a corpse with tits.
It's awesome."

117
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,384
"She's chill."

118
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:02,810
I have never, ever wanted
to date a man that was chill.

119
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:08,232
'Cause chill don't pay the bills.

120
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:19,243
My nephew is 25 years old,
and he is dating this architect.

121
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:24,165
My goodness,
she is so smart and interesting,

122
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,043
successful, and charismatic,

123
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,463
and we all hope
that he marries her one day.

124
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,717
But he called me up earlier this week
and he was like, "You know, Auntie Ali,

125
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,761
I think I'mma break up with her."

126
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,680
"Yeah, because she's a boss at work,

127
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:44,685
and so she thinks it's okay
to come home and boss me around."

128
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,814
I was like, "Oh."

129
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,859
"Well,

130
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,072
that shit's gonna happen to you
no matter what."

131
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,249
"Whether she a boss,
whether she employed or unemployed,

132
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,127
once you get married and have kids,

133
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,588
your wife gonna boss you around."

134
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,802
"And you would know that
if you watched House Hunters."

135
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,851
House Hunters is a show on HGTV

136
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,895
where a couple

137
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,565
pretends that there's
a decision to be made together.

138
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:41,742
And they go on this fake-ass journey
looking at three different houses,

139
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,870
and the audience is
meant to be left in suspense.

140
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,207
"Which house are they gonna choose?"

141
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:55,005
It's whichever one
Barbara wanted in the first place, okay?

142
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,886
And Barbara, who lives in Boise, Idaho,

143
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,349
or wherever the fuck
these HGTV shows are filmed

144
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,811
where houses cost $5,000 an acre…

145
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,945
Barbara, she don't got
money, power, or respect.

146
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,364
But Barbara is a woman,

147
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,993
and all women are very good

148
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,288
at being extremely unpleasant…

149
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,044
and holding your happiness
and self-esteem hostage

150
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,339
until we get
what we fucking deserve, okay?

151
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,924
Yes.

152
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,848
That is a superpower that we evolved

153
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,268
to compensate for
our lack of earning potential.

154
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,482
You can't tell any woman what to do,

155
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:59,111
so you might as well pick the bitch
that will give you health insurance, okay?

156
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,829
I know exactly why

157
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:13,793
there's a disproportionate amount
of men that do stand-up.

158
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,339
It's all because of fan pussy.

159
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,967
We call them chuckle fuckers.

160
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:33,270
These poor, naive women
who get dickmatized when they laugh.

161
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,151
And fan pussy is so motivating

162
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:44,490
because fan pussy is
young and sexy and exciting.

163
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:51,205
Fan pussy is a great reward
for doing stand-up comedy.

164
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,668
And fan dick

165
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,753
is frightening.

166
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:09,849
Any man watching me,
listening to what I have to say,

167
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,394
and thinking to themselves,
"I want to fuck her…"

168
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,482
is a raging psychopath.

169
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,491
And has extremely good taste.

170
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:35,291
Fan dick is not interested
in showing me a good time.

171
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,918
Fan dick wants to trim my pubes

172
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,881
and sew them into wigs
for his antique doll collection.

173
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,722
That's why I don't see
more women doing stand-up.

174
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,266
There is no reward,

175
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,477
only danger and punishment.

176
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,861
Lot of my male stand-up comic friends
be hooking up with women,

177
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:09,241
beautiful, gorgeous women,
through the DMs.

178
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,494
Direct messaging.

179
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,082
I never check my DMs.

180
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,422
And when I do, it's only to see
if Sanrio, the owners of Hello Kitty,

181
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,550
have finally contacted me
to offer sponsorship.

182
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,218
Yeah.

183
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,554
Come on!

184
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,183
I think I'd be a great fit,
and I want all of that shit.

185
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,393
I want the Gudetama pajamas.

186
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,898
I want the erasers
that smell like the gum.

187
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,319
And I want the gum
that tastes like the erasers.

188
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,904
I want all of that shit.

189
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,035
But no.

190
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,703
My DMs are full of

191
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,749
these Silence of the Lambs motherfuckers.

192
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:05,005
It's these dudes
who always have zero followers.

193
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,258
Do you know anybody
who doesn't know anybody?

194
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,892
They don't even offer
to take me out to dinner

195
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,602
or lick my pussy.

196
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:23,983
They just threaten to decapitate me
if I don't let them smell my feet.

197
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,946
And it's a shame, you know?

198
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,158
It's very disturbing,
this disparity in quality

199
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,412
between fan pussy and fan dick.

200
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,497
It is so upsetting

201
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,499
to a person like me.

202
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,043
Because I think

203
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,006
about cheating on my husband…

204
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,136
every five minutes.

205
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,183
I haven't done it yet.

206
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,895
Not because I'm a good person,

207
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:07,276
only because no worthy opportunity
has presented itself.

208
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,490
My mom doesn't understand,
she can't relate

209
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:18,162
to these feelings of wanting
to fool around outside of your marriage,

210
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:22,791
because she's an immigrant woman
who was born in 1940.

211
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,003
Her world is a lot smaller than mine.

212
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:30,716
The only men my mother has
ever had an actual conversation with

213
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,510
are my brother and my dad. That's it.

214
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,513
I, on the other hand,

215
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,309
have met the entire cast of The Avengers.

216
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,863
And I want all of them to cum on my face.

217
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,090
I think I'm going
through a mid-life crisis.

218
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,223
Having two C-sections
and being the breadwinner of my family

219
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,142
has turned me into a 50-year-old man.

220
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,065
I had a colonoscopy a couple years ago.

221
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,943
That is some
50-year-old man shit right there.

222
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,279
What had happened was

223
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:40,077
I, all of a sudden, got extremely bloated
over a very short period of time.

224
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,125
And it was so extreme to the point
where I thought I was pregnant again.

225
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,170
And I took a test, and it was negative.

226
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,674
And then my OBGYN became very concerned

227
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,010
that I was showing
symptoms of ovarian cancer,

228
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,012
because it runs in my family.

229
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:04,059
And so then she ordered a CT scan,
and the results came back.

230
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,352
And she said to me,

231
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,771
"Okay, Ali."

232
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,900
"Well, you know, the good news is that

233
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,821
you don't have ovarian cancer, okay?
And then…"

234
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,242
"The bad news is that, Ali,

235
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,371
you are full of shit."

236
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,128
"Stop giggling, Ali, stop it.
This is serious, okay?"

237
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,298
On the report, the radiologist wrote,

238
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,134
"The results are remarkable."

239
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,102
Which, to me, seems like
the radiologist gave me an A++.

240
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,940
She was like, "No, that's bad."

241
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:56,236
When the radiologist writes
"The results are remarkable,"

242
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,363
what that translates to is,

243
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,656
"Oh my goodness,

244
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,619
I don't understand
how this tiny Vietnamese mom

245
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,164
fit this football field of doo-doo
inside of her body."

246
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,460
"I have never seen this
in my 30 years as a radiologist,

247
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:16,173
and I cannot wait to text screenshots
of this to all my radiologist friends."

248
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,099
So then a GI specialist was called in,

249
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,312
and I saw her look at the results,

250
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,772
and she went like this.

251
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,445
And then she turns to me and says,

252
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:43,367
"Miss Wong, I am so sorry
that I gasped in front of your face."

253
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,078
"That was so unprofessional of me."

254
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,580
"I know exactly who you are."

255
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,334
"Please do not talk about
how I just did that on stage."

256
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:04,012
"But, you know, I have to admit that
I'm clearly alarmed by what I see here."

257
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:08,058
"You are backed up
well into your small intestine,

258
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:12,312
and I'm almost certain that
there is some sort of mass,

259
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:16,358
and most likely a tumor
that's causing all of this blockage."

260
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,903
"So we're going to have
to perform a colonoscopy

261
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,114
to see what's going on in there."

262
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,409
I was like, "Why?
You guys just did a CT scan."

263
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,660
And she was like, "Yes,

264
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:32,916
it is true that the whole point of
a CT scan is to see inside of your body,

265
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,588
but the lasers couldn't penetrate
the Great Wall of Shit that's inside you."

266
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,843
"And they just ricocheted
and bounced back into the machine,

267
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,928
and now the machine is shook, so…

268
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,057
we're going to have to stick a camera

269
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,518
up your ass."

270
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,521
And I was so nervous.

271
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:58,525
But what I didn't know was that
right before the procedure,

272
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,694
they give you propofol.

273
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:06,074
And I have to say that
as a working mother of two…

274
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,872
getting to take
a drug-induced nap for an hour…

275
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,919
was well worth
having a news crew up my butt.

276
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,302
It was luxurious.

277
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,806
When I woke up from the colonoscopy,
I was like,

278
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,892
"I want another colonoscopy."

279
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,399
And then it turned out that
my colon was perfectly healthy,

280
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:44,071
and I figured out that
what caused that huge traffic jam was

281
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:48,116
the summer before, I was shooting
this movie called Always Be My Maybe.

282
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,161
Oh, thank you.

283
00:22:54,081 --> 00:23:00,253
Yeah, it was a big-ass deal because it was
the first movie I had ever co-written

284
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,672
and starred in as the lead.

285
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:06,051
And I worked on it for 12 hours a day,

286
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:11,014
every day for six weeks straight,
and I was so busy

287
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,601
that I forgot to take a shit…

288
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,688
for six weeks.

289
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,401
The movie shot
in Vancouver and in San Francisco,

290
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:27,697
and I have no recollection of shitting
in Vancouver or in San Francisco.

291
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,452
I just straight up forgot.

292
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,082
Something like that
would never happen to a man.

293
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:43,046
Men, you never forget to take a shit ever.

294
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,632
Ever.

295
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:53,056
How could you, when you sit
on the toilet and have your sacred ritual

296
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,351
every morning to summon the shit?

297
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,938
You sit there from 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.

298
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,567
You sit there
with all of your reading materials,

299
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,988
your iPad battery just
burning up the sperm in your balls.

300
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:12,242
You sit there
at the most crucial time of the day,

301
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:16,329
when your wife and kids
need you and the bathroom the most.

302
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:23,170
You sit there to avoid reality
and all of your responsibility in life.

303
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,215
You're too scared
to ask your wife for alone time,

304
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,886
so instead you just
passively-aggressively take it

305
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,930
by chasing your wife and kids
out of the bathroom

306
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,975
with the stank of your selfish-ass shit!

307
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,483
Women, we don't do that, okay?

308
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,569
We have too much guilt and shame

309
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:53,992
to sit there every morning
at the same time to summon the shit.

310
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,120
Instead, the shit comes to us

311
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,166
at the most inconvenient time of the day.

312
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:08,173
When we're in the middle of a meeting, or

313
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:13,094
onstage taping our third Netflix special.

314
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,023
But when you feel
that first turtle head peek out,

315
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,817
you gotta squeeze your butt cheeks in,

316
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,569
suck the poo-poo back up

317
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,864
into your generous,
loving, self-sacrificing soul.

318
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,372
But then at some point, you gots to go,

319
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,499
and then it's an emergency.

320
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:48,255
It's always an emergency
when a woman finally takes a shit,

321
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,675
and that's why
every woman's public restroom

322
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,011
looks like a post-apocalyptic
zombie nightmare,

323
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,600
where there is blood on the walls
and pizza on the record player.

324
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:16,700
My life has changed dramatically
in the past seven years.

325
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:23,415
Seven years ago, I pressured the shit
out of my then-boyfriend to propose to me.

326
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,959
Every day, I was in his ear…

327
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,336
"When you going to ask me to marry you?"

328
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,173
"I'm not gonna wait forever!"

329
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,467
"Everybody wants this pussy."

330
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,595
Nobody else wanted this pussy,

331
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,598
but I had to make up these fairy tales

332
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,642
to add pizzazz to the ultimatum, you know?

333
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,858
It was crazy, but my wish came true.

334
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,235
He proposed, we got married.

335
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,238
We bought a house, had two kids.

336
00:26:55,322 --> 00:27:00,160
Fast-forward to seven years later,
present day, I'm like,

337
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,037
"I don't know why I did that."

338
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,420
I think that what happened was
at the time,

339
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:16,635
my future in comedy
was looking very uncertain, you know?

340
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,721
I was really struggling.

341
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,349
Like, I was eating
cough drops for dessert.

342
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,600
It was so sad.

343
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:30,190
And I panicked. I was like, "I don't know
if I can make it in this world on my own."

344
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:35,403
"So I better trap this dude
who graduated from Harvard Business School

345
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,906
so that I don't end up homeless."

346
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,910
But now,

347
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,664
I know that I can make it on my own.

348
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,218
So I kind of want to just be on my own.

349
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,934
Only other married people
with kids can empathize

350
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:11,314
with the deep envy I feel
towards you single people, okay?

351
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,192
You don't know how free you are.

352
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,986
You can eat an edible at 2:00 p.m.,

353
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:24,160
go to the aquarium and
watch the jellyfish go back and forth.

354
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:31,126
You don't gotta bring a giant bag
with little Ziploc baggies of Goldfish,

355
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,460
and toy cellphones.

356
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,547
You can just go
with what's in your pockets.

357
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,304
You single people,
you don't know what it's like

358
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,932
to eat a cold quesadilla

359
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,894
that your toddler threw on the floor,

360
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,315
because it's easier
to put it in your mouth

361
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,444
than travel to the trash,

362
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,906
while you repeat to yourself
over and over that

363
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,451
child abuse is illegal!

364
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:17,422
You single people, if you're
romantically involved with somebody,

365
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,882
and then all of a sudden,

366
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:23,845
that somebody reveals
a personality trait that you don't like,

367
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,432
you could just leave.

368
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:35,857
Move to another city
and never see their stupid face again.

369
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,986
Because you didn't make a promise

370
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:44,240
in front of your grandma
and all your coworkers

371
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,619
and ask your friends
to buy you an Instant Pot.

372
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:56,795
You didn't fuse your DNA to create
human life that will forever ask you,

373
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,131
"Where's Daddy?"

374
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:10,433
You single people,
you don't have to go on a playdate,

375
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:16,731
which is basically a blind date
that your toddler sets you up on…

376
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,904
with some bitch
you have zero chemistry with.

377
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:34,332
You single people,
you don't have to be nice to your mother

378
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:38,253
because you need her for babysitting.

379
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,344
You don't have to smile

380
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,682
and listen to all of this
unsolicited parenting advice

381
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,185
from this woman
who neglected the shit out of you…

382
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:03,278
because you want time to yourself
to binge Bridgerton to feel alive again.

383
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,955
Like you single people,
I, too, was once free, okay?

384
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,545
And then like an idiot, I asked this dude
to ask me to go to prison.

385
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,638
And now I'm in monogamy jail,
and I don't know how to get out.

386
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:38,479
Monogamy made sense
when we lived until we were 40 years old.

387
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,649
Yeah, I'm 39 right now,

388
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,486
so if you told me that
I had to do this shit for another year,

389
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,864
I'd be like, "Yeah, I could do that."

390
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,660
"I can rub it out to Aquaman
for another year, it's fine."

391
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,037
"It's no big deal."

392
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,882
But as an Asian woman, I'm gonna live

393
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,426
until I'm 95 years old.

394
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,433
That's not even a joke, okay?

395
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,852
that is statistically probable.

396
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,148
My husband and I are the same age.

397
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,234
He'll most likely die when he's 85.

398
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,071
So between 85 and 95 is

399
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,574
when I'm morally allowed
to fuck other people again.

400
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,867
It's too late.

401
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,996
'Cause at the age of 75
is when Asian women

402
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,165
finally turn into an owl.

403
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,881
You know what I'm talking about.

404
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,676
Their tattooed eyebrows
turn green and shit.

405
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,473
They go bald, and then the few strands
that are left, they perm the shit out of

406
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,809
to make it more Jhirmack "bounce back."

407
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,522
And then they become
obsessed with dried jujubes

408
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:06,317
and just walk around
in down jackets all day like this.

409
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,921
I want to fuck other people now…

410
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:33,678
before I metamorphosize
into a nut sack with a visor.

411
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,772
You want to cheat with me?

412
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,858
You want to fuck around with me?

413
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,111
You better give me
two weeks' notice, okay?

414
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,115
'Cause you gotta
give me time to go shopping

415
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,950
for new underwear.

416
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,998
I've been with the same dude
for the last 10 years.

417
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:06,794
So all my underwear looks like
it's been snacked on by rats.

418
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,723
Just looks like wardrobe
from Les Miserables, okay?

419
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,976
Like a tattered sail of a pirate ship.

420
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,856
The elastic? Gone.

421
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:31,235
So the crotch area hangs
about five inches below my actual pussy,

422
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,863
like a Indiana Jones suspension bridge,

423
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,116
like a hammock in the Blue Bayou, okay?

424
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,954
You want to fuck around with me?
Let me know,

425
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:47,668
so I got time to go to Target and get that
sweet five-for-20 Xhilaration panty deal.

426
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,675
Merona, whatever's on sale.

427
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,144
In our society,

428
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:09,190
there is no word for a male mistress.

429
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:15,446
That's how taboo it is
for women to cheat on their husbands.

430
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,075
The only word I've ever heard is sancho,

431
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,579
yes, because Mexican women
cheat on their husbands,

432
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:28,084
because their culture is mucho más mejor.

433
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,628
Es la verdad, okay? It is.

434
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:37,635
I've been saying this about Mexican people
and Mexican culture for a long time.

435
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,262
I'm like the Little Mermaid.

436
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,723
I want to be part of your Telemundo, okay?

437
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:47,270
Yes. Si se puede, con permiso,
let me in. Come on.

438
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,898
I like Fabuloso, okay?

439
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,694
I like storing my pots and pans
in the oven. Yeah.

440
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,489
I like squeezing lime juice on everything.

441
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,742
I like hickeys. I love hickeys.

442
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:11,127
Generally, our society is very unforgiving

443
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,130
of women who cheat on their husbands,

444
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:20,511
and at the same time, it's so forgiving
of men who cheat on their wives.

445
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:27,435
Somehow money, power, and respect
will earn a man the right to cheat.

446
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,521
People will come to his defense and say,

447
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:36,777
"Oh, how could he be expected
to resist all of that fan pussy?"

448
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,698
"He is so awesome, he deserves to cheat."

449
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:47,830
For women, no matter how much
money, power, or respect you earn,

450
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:53,169
you are never allowed
to behave badly and get away with it.

451
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,548
But that's all I want to do.

452
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,386
I want to have it all.

453
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:07,141
I want to have a family, a career,

454
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,227
and a side piece.

455
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:21,572
The greatest trick women ever played
on ourselves was making us believe

456
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:27,286
that having it all was limited
to having a family and a career.

457
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,038
I got both of those things.

458
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,374
Newsflash, it's not enough.

459
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,543
Necesito más.

460
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,048
I don't just want equal pay,

461
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,425
I want equal pleasure.

462
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,096
But it would be very threatening

463
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:49,600
if all women wanted
and felt like they deserved that,

464
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,354
because then a bunch of women
wouldn't be available

465
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:58,526
to helping their husbands
make their lives as easy as possible.

466
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,447
Do you know how much more
successful I would be if I had a wife?

467
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,627
Some loving, devoted woman by my side

468
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,131
who bought a bunch of fruit
besides bananas?

469
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,052
And put the duvet cover on the duvet?

470
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,851
People don't like it
when women cheat, you know,

471
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,604
and they'll really turn on you
because they feel betrayed,

472
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,107
especially if you're a mom.

473
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,528
It's too contrary
to your wholesome, loving image.

474
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:47,616
And that's why
I'm trying to let all of you know now…

475
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,290
that I'm a real piece of shit, okay?

476
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:01,756
I want you to really listen to me
and understand this and believe me,

477
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,343
so that you're not shocked or surprised,

478
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,803
so that you don't abandon me

479
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:14,352
when you see the TMZ video of my face
getting fire-hosed by Michael B. Jordan…

480
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,449
while I chant, "Wakanda forever!"

481
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:48,052
I think another reason why
a lot of women are hesitant to cheat

482
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:51,472
is because it's too high stakes

483
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,559
to put your family, your reputation,

484
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,270
your life as you know it on the line,

485
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:02,066
all for the probability
that you most likely

486
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,902
will not have an orgasm.

487
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:14,870
Very difficult to make a woman,
especially a new woman, cum.

488
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,872
It's so annoying.

489
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,749
It's a design flaw.

490
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,793
There's too many factors.

491
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:24,171
There's too much shit that has to align.

492
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,673
The lighting,

493
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,383
the temperature,

494
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,677
the news.

495
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,266
You can't be all up in your head about
the global supply chain being backed up.

496
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:40,396
I don't deserve to cum
when the Dow Jones is down 500 points

497
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,441
and I still don't understand
what cryptocurrency is.

498
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,360
Who can cum in times like these?

499
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:55,786
So in order for a woman to cum,
all this shit has to align, right?

500
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:00,958
And then on top of that,
the dude got to have skills.

501
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,296
He gotta have great timing.

502
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:12,761
He gotta know
how to come in real slow and soft

503
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,348
and romantic and tenderoni
in the beginning…

504
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,856
and then get real rapey by the end.

505
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,911
In, like, a consensual way, of course.

506
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,792
But a lot of dudes,
they fuck that timing up, right?

507
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,212
They come out the gates guns blazing,

508
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,380
like Braveheart
coming over the hill, just…

509
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,258
"Mortal Kombat!"

510
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,969
And you're like, "Okay, I'm bleeding and…

511
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,266
think you rubbed my clit off
onto the floor,

512
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,727
and now it's lost with the dust bunnies."

513
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,987
And then some dudes,
they do the opposite, right?

514
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:16,992
They maintain this whole, like,
candlelit, walk-on-the-beach energy…

515
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,663
Close your eyes
Make a wish

516
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,791
…throughout the entire course of the sex,
and it's like,

517
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,961
"Nah, dude. In the last 30 seconds,

518
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,755
I need you to put me in a headlock

519
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,174
and say racist shit to me. Okay?"

520
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,968
"Yeah."

521
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,221
"Yeah, I want my eyebrows
to fly off my face,

522
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:42,977
and I want you to degrade me until
I go deaf and mute at the same time."

523
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,607
"You gotta shape-shift, bro."

524
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,737
Nothing more satisfying to a woman

525
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:58,450
then when a man goes through
a sudden and extreme transformation

526
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,370
that she is responsible for.

527
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,585
You know,

528
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:12,965
would be such a shame
to go through all that trouble of cheating

529
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,386
to end up having to fake an orgasm.

530
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:24,935
In fact, I don't think any of us women
should be faking orgasms anymore.

531
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,854
Yeah.

532
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,398
No more faking orgasms.

533
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:37,781
I mean, you really think about it,
that is some nutty-ass shit

534
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,742
that we women do.

535
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,869
That's a skill that you taught yourself.

536
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,538
That wasn't passed down to you
from your mother.

537
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,708
You taught yourself
to do that shit out of survival.

538
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:54,340
And it is wildly indicative
of how terrified we women are

539
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,717
of offending a man,

540
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,305
that we would rather
fake an orgasm than simply say…

541
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,603
"Hey, I just want to go home."

542
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,531
"This is so not awesome."

543
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,328
"And I feel like I've really tried
to tell you where to put it,

544
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,873
where not to put it,
how fast, how slow, and

545
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,877
you straight up just don't listen,
you know, so…

546
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:39,635
I'd really like to just go back
to my house and fold clothes."

547
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:50,604
Men are so much more
incentivized to cheat because

548
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,107
you're going to cum no matter what.

549
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,318
It's so easy for a man to cum.

550
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,029
All you need is a wet hole.

551
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,656
You don't even need that!

552
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,827
Men love to jerk off
in front of women all the time.

553
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,038
I've seen, like, 70 men
jack off in my lifetime.

554
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,376
Men love to show you
their masturbation practice.

555
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,962
But for me, you know,

556
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:20,592
if a man is not performing
at the caliber I need him to perform at,

557
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:24,221
I'm not all of a sudden
going to leap onto his neck

558
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:27,599
and start fingering myself
over his face, you know?

559
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,520
Like, "Oh, you have erectile dysfunction?"

560
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,021
"No problem. I got it."

561
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,442
"Let me just dangle my pubes,

562
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,195
my long-ass pandemic pubes
over your forehead

563
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,823
and squirt into your nose hole.
You don't like it?"

564
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:47,703
"Who cares? Who's gonna believe you,
you young, powerless boy?"

565
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,625
I'd be like, "What the fuck am I doing?"

566
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:12,644
So if you haven't seen the movie,
it's a romantic comedy…

567
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:21,403
where I play a celebrity chef who falls
back in love with her childhood friend.

568
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,155
And in the movie,

569
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:28,744
my character hooks up
with three different, very good-looking,

570
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,329
very iconic,

571
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,373
very sexy Asian American men.

572
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,668
I know, it's like,
who wrote this thing, right? Like…

573
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,297
Whose idea was this?

574
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:47,971
And while shooting,
all of my girlfriends kept on asking me,

575
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,973
"Okay, Ali, on the DL,

576
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:54,186
you gonna hook up
with one of your costars?"

577
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,858
You know, I came this close…

578
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,612
to fucking the food consultant.

579
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:15,040
It was this 29-year-old Persian dude
who had tattoos all over his arms

580
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,126
and his chest,
and when the wind blew, oh my God,

581
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,170
he was so ripped,
you could see everything.

582
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,548
You could see the King's Hawaiian,

583
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:28,136
you could see the cum gutters pointing you
straight to the kingdom of heaven.

584
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,097
You could see it all, you know?

585
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,938
And we spent one Sunday morning

586
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,108
butchering 18 raw chickens.

587
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,947
That shit was like
the "Unchained Melody" scene from Ghost…

588
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,869
but with salmonella.

589
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,249
He had his arms wrapped around me,

590
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,084
and I almost sliced my hand off,

591
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:05,966
because I could feel his 29-year old dick
getting hard up against my spine.

592
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,926
Yeah.

593
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:12,014
See, the pussy can fake a orgasm,
but the dick don't lie.

594
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:17,561
I felt that biology and that truth
right up against my back.

595
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,815
I did not feel violated.

596
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,987
I felt victorious.

597
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,365
I did.

598
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,332
As, like, a 39-year-old woman
with two C-section scars,

599
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,876
I was like, "Oh my God, I am so powerful."

600
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,629
"I changed density, motherfucker, what!"

601
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,884
"I am a wizard!
I'm a blood bender! I could be in Avatar."

602
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:53,639
"Let's go, Appa. Let's go
find Zuko and make out! Let's go!"

603
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,147
And I went back to my hotel that afternoon

604
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,857
and I pull down my pants,

605
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,360
and my underwear…

606
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,281
looked like the bottom of a bird cage.

607
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:36,640
It's a mystery to me why Hello Kitty
hasn't contacted me yet, you know?

608
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,644
It's like,

609
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,729
come on, what's up?

610
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,404
When I saw that in my underwear,
when I saw those loogies,

611
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:54,992
I was like, "Oh my God, I still got it!"

612
00:49:55,617 --> 00:50:00,580
There is still supply,
given that there is fresh demand, okay?

613
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:07,254
If you don't understand
the supply and demand metaphor,

614
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:11,633
what I'm trying to tell you is my body
still produces pussy juice, people.

615
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,094
Okay? And it was good pussy juice too.

616
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,638
It was sparkly and glistening.

617
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,850
Viscous but not too pasty.

618
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,102
Pungent but not too dank, it was…

619
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,854
It was.

620
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,191
I took a little fun dip in there,

621
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,361
that shit tasted
like LaCroix Pamplemousse.

622
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,114
It was quality.

623
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:38,827
It could've sealed up all the holes
in my underwear like Gorilla Glue, it was…

624
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:55,135
You know, as much as
I would love to cheat on my husband,

625
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,097
I cannot afford to get a divorce.

626
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,892
I can't, you know?

627
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:08,148
The reality is, I need my husband
way more than he needs me.

628
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,902
It is ten times harder
to find a decent husband

629
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,738
than it is to find a great wife.

630
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,532
It's so fucking annoying, you know?

631
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:24,122
I'm almost 40, so I have all these, like,
acquaintances getting divorced right now.

632
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,541
All these women,
they keep coming up to me…

633
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:32,923
"Ali, it is so difficult
dating out there for a divorced woman."

634
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:37,302
"None of these men can handle me,
a strong woman."

635
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:40,722
"None of these men want a strong woman."

636
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,350
I'm like, "You're an annoying woman, but…"

637
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:49,189
I do believe that
it's slim pickings out there, you know?

638
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:54,694
And then these women,
they keep telling me about their battle

639
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:59,574
and how ugly it is, how they're
fighting for full custody of their kids.

640
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,076
I'm like, "Why?"

641
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:10,794
Even half custody sounds like
American Horror Story.

642
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,009
I can't let go of my husband, you know?

643
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:22,597
He's very handsome, he's very sexy,
he's very much my type.

644
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,391
I have a very specific type.

645
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:29,396
I like dudes who look
as close to Keanu Reeves as possible.

646
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:31,773
Yeah.

647
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,735
And that's my husband, straight up.

648
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,488
He's so good-looking, he's so interesting.

649
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,615
He speaks three different languages.

650
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:44,536
He introduced me
to mushrooms and ayahuasca,

651
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,037
changed my life.

652
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,540
So in addition to being my husband,

653
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,333
he's also my drug dealer.

654
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,338
I can't lose
that Shaman connect, you know?

655
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,802
My husband's so smart.

656
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,470
He went to Carnegie Mellon,

657
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,972
Harvard Business School.

658
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,849
He's a Fulbright scholar.

659
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:10,437
He was smart enough to choose me,
to invest in me,

660
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,647
when I was 20 pounds heavier,

661
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,901
had chronic acne and no money.

662
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,864
He bought low.

663
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,296
And if we get divorced,
he going to sell high.

664
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,302
I can't let him get away with that!

665
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:48,099
So my husband,
he's all of these wonderful things, right?

666
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,978
But most importantly,
he gives me permission

667
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,397
to be myself.

668
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:04,616
Which perhaps,
for a wild, untamable spirit,

669
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:08,870
is the most important quality
to find in a man.

670
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,706
But people think
it's so difficult for my husband

671
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:17,337
to do something so simple as
giving me permission to be myself.

672
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,965
They always ask him, "Oh my God,

673
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:25,262
how do you feel about
your wife Ali going up on stage

674
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,722
in front of all of these strangers,

675
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,226
talking about how much
she wants to cheat on you?"

676
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:41,820
You know, right now while we're all here,

677
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:47,409
my husband is at home
in the house that I bought…

678
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:54,916
telling time on the Rolex
I got him for Father's Day…

679
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,385
jacking off to porn that he streams

680
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:09,306
on the high-speed internet
I pay for every month.

681
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,482
So, he always tells me…

682
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,446
"Yeah, you go ahead, you know you…"

683
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:36,583
He doesn't give a shit
about what I say on stage

684
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,461
because he's too busy

685
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:43,089
living the life I wanted for myself.

686
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:57,854
I'm the one leaning in
while he is lying down.

687
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,361
And now that I'm the clear breadwinner,

688
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,863
he don't choke me like he used to.

689
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,786
It's too high stakes if I die.

690
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,877
I'll be like, "Harder, come on, harder!"

691
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,297
And he'll be like,
"But I really want a PS5."

692
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,928
"It's all sold out, and
the waitlists and the ports are all full."

693
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:42,607
People like to assume that
because my husband is very spiritual

694
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:47,654
and because he's Asian American,
that he's some kind of softy,

695
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:53,535
when the truth is he got
this backbone made of pure, solid steel.

696
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,453
He is a motherfucker.

697
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,415
And whenever we get into an argument

698
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,708
and I raise my voice,

699
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,336
he'll look me in the eye and say to me,

700
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,881
"Oh, you don't talk to me like that."

701
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,801
And then I'll be like…

702
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,103
"I'mma suck your dick."

703
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,654
"You put me in my place again."

704
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,659
"And then you give me
permission to be myself,

705
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,078
and then you tell me what to do,

706
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,205
and then you celebrate me."

707
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,960
And that, single people, is
what a healthy marriage looks like, okay?

708
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:47,714
I've been Ali Wong,
have a good night, everybody. Thank you!
