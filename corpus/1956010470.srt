(rhythmic and pleasant

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,840
- What are you doing?

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,281
- Yes, wait, wait, wait, wait!

6
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,280
Wait!

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,681
- Can I open them yet?

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,681
- Yes.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,720
(both chuckling over waiter
speaking foreign language)

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,320
Cheers.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,920
- Cheers.

45
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:15,398
She's such a darling,
but remodeling her house

46
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:17,358
will take longer
than reconstruction.

47
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,958

before Mexico, Jesus Christ!

48
00:02:19,998 --> 00:02:22,558
That's my birthday, that's
incredible, look at that!

00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:24,438

like to go with you?

50
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:28,197
(sighs) You remember Mexico?

51
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:31,197
Chichen Itza, that,
uh, El Castillo,

52
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:32,518
that pyramid in the middle.

00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:33,797

58
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:50,077
There is so much work
to do, you have no idea!

59
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:55,637
I'll be back for the party.

hey, I'll tell you

69
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:22,435
what I told Travolta,
not in the face!

70
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,875
- Nobody drinks anymore,
it's all about G.

71
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:26,155
- Yeah, but like, can't you die?

72
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:27,514
- Only if you do too much.

73
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:28,954
- Happy birthday!
(slap cracking)

74
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:30,394
- [Partygoer] Henry!

75
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:34,475
(partygoers chattering
over throbbing EDM music)

76
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:37,715
- Hey, hey, uh, Dennis.

77
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:42,115
- (gasps) All I can taste is
whiskey, where's the sour?

78
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,635
- Right, you know
how Daddy likes it,

79
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:50,074
Dennis, careful, he's in a mood.

80
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:54,075
I mean, remember last time?

81
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:56,194
I'm not getting fired again!

82
00:04:57,434 --> 00:04:59,073
- High kick!
(Javi groans)

83
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:01,794
- Ah, yeah, not now (sighs).

84
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,834
You're good to go, thanks.

85
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:04,394
- Well, the ratings
are down everywhere,

86
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,634
I mean, the only thing that's
not going down on it is him.

87
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,274
- Listen, we need a gimmick,
we need a sensation,

88
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:10,713
something to trigger the show.

89
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:12,353
Something to survive
the next season--

90
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:13,913
- I've got a good idea,
have another angioplasty,

91
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:15,434
or better yet, become
a transsexual--

92
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:16,193
- Oh, stop!

93
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,754
- No, no, seriously!

94
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:19,393
- A brain tumor would get us
at least two more seasons.

95
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:20,593
- [Farleigh] Guys, I'm serious.

96
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:21,914
- [Tod] Get two
seasons out of that.

97
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:25,594
- I'm in perfect health, I've
never been in better shape,

98
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:28,553
'cause when I was sick, you
always stood at my side.

99
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:31,113
That really showed
me that you loved me.

100
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:32,433
- Yeah, but that's,
no, no no no.

101
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:34,833
We, we, we care
about your health,

102
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:36,832
and we have every
confidence in you,

103
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:39,273
so why don't we just
take a moment and, uh,

104
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:40,832
look at some of your new
sketches for the restaurants--

105
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,033
- There isn't much to see, that,

106
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:43,633
that's the fuckin'
problem (sighs).

107
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:45,353
- Look, we design interiors,
not stunts for the show.

108
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:46,233
That's your job.

109
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:47,992
- Wh-what did you just say?

110
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:49,593
We do?

111
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,553
So we do wait for the
order of the next season,

112
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:55,633
and we do pay for all your
nice and pretty things.

113
00:05:58,032 --> 00:05:59,671
- I'll get you
another whiskey sour.

114
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:00,671
- Yes.

115
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,192
Double!

116
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:06,513
- You know, we could, uh, up
the flesh factor on the show.

117
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:07,993
- [Michael] Hey!

118
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:11,153
(throbbing EDM music)

119
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:12,312
- What are you doing?

120
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:13,353
- [Man In White Trunks] Eating.

121
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:14,552
- Are you new or something?

122
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:16,232
You don't eat in
front of gay people!

123
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:18,632
I haven't had chips
since I came out!

124
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:20,112
You're welcome.

125
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:22,551
- No-no, you left a
drifter with crotch rot

126
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:24,071
stick one in?

127
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:26,232
- No, fucker, I didn't
know he was homeless, OK?

128
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:28,992
I thought he was from Echo Park!

129
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:29,951
- Wasn't there a smell?

130
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:31,911
- No, he had really
nice shoes, OK?

131
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,632
(man on left laughs)

132
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:36,151
(bag crinkling)

133
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:49,111
(vaguely ominous
electronic music)

134
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:59,871
(water splashing)

135
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:03,711
- How long have you
been standing there?

136
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:06,391
Uh (clears throat).

137
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,110
(partygoers laughing)

138
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:22,390
(rhythmic funk music)

139
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:23,270
(water splashing)

140
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:26,190
(partygoers gasping and hooting)

141
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,671
Farleigh, Farleigh?

142
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:32,430
(rhythmic funk music)

143
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,910
Hey, Farleigh!

144
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,790
Farleigh!
(Farleigh groans)

145
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,790
(glass clinking to floor)

146
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,710
(Farleigh sighs)

147
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,790
Thank God, you gave me a scare.

148
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,990
(groans) I'm just
exhausted (groans).

149
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,230
- [Dennis] Oh, come on!

150
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,350
(rhythmic funk music)

151
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,428
(Farleigh sighs)

152
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,069
- You know, let's
just go to sleep,

153
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,109
I, I have, I have a
really early morning, OK?

154
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,909
(muffled funk music)

155
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,549
- Church?

156
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,069
- [Farleigh]
(chuckles) Yes, church.

157
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:16,268
No, I'm serious, I
really should sleep.

158
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:19,988
Good night.

159
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:22,549
Uh, before I forget it, um,

160
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:25,469
could you take the Porsche
tomorrow to a car wash?

161
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:26,629
Thank you.

162
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:28,988
- I just got it waxed
like a week ago.

163
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:31,989
- [Farleigh] Yeah, but
it needs to look perfect.

164
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:35,748
I got somebody who comes by
tomorrow to take a look at it.

165
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,789
- Why?

166
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:41,787
- (sighs) Because I
agreed to sell it,

167
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:43,949
and I think I found a buyer.

168
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:46,468
- [Dennis] Sell it, the Porsche?

169
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:51,267
- I need to liquidate
some assets, Dennis.

170
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:53,107
- But what will I drive?

171
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,868
(muffled funk music)

172
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,908
(Farleigh sighs)

173
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:09,188
- Has it ever occurred
to you to get a job?

174
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:10,188
- A job?

175
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,587
- [Farleigh] Yeah.

176
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:14,108
- You're joking.

177
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:15,107
- No,

178
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,307
no.

179
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:23,507
(sighs) You live a very
costly lifestyle, my boy.

180
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:29,188
- Like what kind of job?

181
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,867
- Well, what are you good at,

182
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:35,187
besides swilling champagne
and going to the gym?

183
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:38,268
Which, by the way, it lately
seems you've been doing

184
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:40,227
more of the former and
less of the latter.

185
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:44,307
(distant partygoers laughing
over muffled funk music)

186
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,866
Why does it have to be so loud?

187
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,707
Can you turn on
the lights, please?

188
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:57,306
(partygoers shouting)

189
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,866
(pole cracking and rattling)

190
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:12,027
(water bubbling)

191
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:16,346
(Jasper sighs)

192
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:19,346
(pleasant piano music)

193
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:25,626
(water splashing)

194
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,026
(Jasper gasps)

195
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:36,706
(pleasant soft rock music)

196
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:39,064
(Jasper gasps)

197
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:46,426
(melody jingling from cellphone)

198
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,225
- [Paulette] Meet
me in the War Room

199
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:53,546
in a half an hour and
bring me a Xanax or five.

200
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:56,345
(cellphone beeps)

201
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:59,346
- Spanker of the
House again or wife?

202
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:00,585
- The missus has been so good

203
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,825
about staying out
of the picture,

204
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:04,545
well, she decided to
steal my congressman back.

205
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:06,265
- How is she
planning to do this?

206
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:07,385
- Convince him to run
for a second term.

207
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:09,225
- What, they live
up in Pasadena.

208
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:10,345
- Well, she wants him
back in Washington

209
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:12,305
for the next six years.

210
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:13,545
- Lonnie, do you think
I have crow's feet?

211
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,105
- Dennis, what is with
the fucking crow's feet?

212
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:16,985
What is wrong with you?

213
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:21,705
- What about a new someone,
like a new Spanker.

214
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:24,225
- Are you outta your
goddamn, corn-fed mind?

215
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:25,824
I'm no spring chicken!

216
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:28,385
I invested the best years
of my life in that dickwad!

217
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,425
No, it is time to dividend
collecting, my friend,

218
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:31,744
and it's the same
reason you had to fight

219
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:35,464
for Diedre fucking
Diamond's aging pussy!

220
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:37,424
We are not 22 years old anymore,

221
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:39,144
with the world at our fingertips

222
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:42,024
and people beating down
our door trying to fuck us!

223
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:42,903
- Speak for yourself.

224
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:44,944
- Face facts, wild one.

225
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:48,104
We made our beds and it's
about time we lied in 'em,

226
00:11:48,144 --> 00:11:50,824
'til our geezers die,
we get their money,

227
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:53,504
and then we start this
whole cycle all over again

228
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:55,264
except this time, we're the ones

229
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:58,264
who get to fuck that hard cock.

230
00:11:58,304 --> 00:11:59,824
Or a tail in your place, Lonnie.

231
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:03,864
My point is, there's
no guarantee I'll
find another speaker

232
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:06,543
and even if I do, he'll
probably wanna get married

233
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,463
or have children or
something awful like that.

234
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:11,383
You may think you look
like you did 10 years ago,

235
00:12:11,423 --> 00:12:13,944
but women, when they
meet men at age 30,

236
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,704
want them to have fucking
careers, not a resume

237
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:20,063
filled with one-night
stands and party-attending!

238
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:21,103
- Meow.

239
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:22,423
- Truth hurts, Gugana.

240
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:24,104
- You two, queerty,
last time I checked,

241
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,463
the sell by date on
chicken of the twink ass,

242
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:29,303
it expired around age
24 and you, my friend,

243
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:31,783
are well past that sell by date.

244
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:33,463
Crow's feet don't lie.

245
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,503
- Bartender, another
round, please!

246
00:12:36,543 --> 00:12:38,743
- Honestly, I don't give a fuck
if he goes back to Arizona.

247
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,143
I just want my rent and
my Barney's card paid.

248
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:44,462
- Well, tell him you love him.

249
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:48,103
- That sounds hard.

250
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,462
- Tell him he doesn't
have to be a congressman

251
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:53,143
to make you happy, that
you'd rather him retire

252
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:56,542
and live on a congressman's
small pension to be with him.

253
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,702
- True love, that's
playin' dirty.

254
00:12:58,742 --> 00:12:59,702
- Well, so does he,

255
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:02,062
if Paulette's stories
are even half true.

256
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:05,383
He'll respect the hardball
tactic and be flattered

257
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:09,342
that she's the only woman who
loves him for his real self.

258
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:13,182
- Dennis, that is either
stupid or fucking brilliant.

259
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:17,302
Thank you, drinks are on me.

260
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:22,302
(relaxed
singer-songwriter music)

261
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,862
(siren blaring)

262
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,701
- Farleigh's punishing
you for getting old.

263
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:28,302
You're not old.

264
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,501
- Oh, no, then why's he taking
the Porsche away from me?

265
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,182
- Maybe he needs to
free up some cash.

266
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:36,902
- No, bullshit, he's
richer than Zuckerberg.

267
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,822
- So you need a job?

268
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:40,260
Is there anything you can do?

269
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:42,941
- I thought boy toy
was gonna be it.

270
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:46,262
If only I'd gone to
college like you.

271
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:48,182
Everything that seems
mildly interesting

272
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:51,861
or even tolerable says
college degree required.

273
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,620
- I thought you went to college?

274
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:57,261
- Four months at Bard,
then I met Farleigh.

275
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:59,580
It's been Dicklick
Manor ever since.

276
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,341
- I think you're overreacting.

277
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,101
- No, I don't think I am.

278
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:06,060
The only job I've ever
had was a swimsuit model.

279
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:09,380
Two weeks in a banana hammock
qualifies me for nothing.

280
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,781
Call boy seems to be about it.

281
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,540
- Ya fuck for things, not money.

282
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,979
If you fuck for money,
it makes you a whore.

283
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,700
(traffic humming)

284
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:26,181
- You know what?

285
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,180
- [Lonnie] Hmm?

286
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,460
- Maybe all I need to
do is convince Farleigh

287
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,981
that I'm just as
desirable as ever.

288
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,180
- How you gonna do that?

289
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,259
- Are you free tonight?
(Lonnie chuckles)

290
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,900
- Hello, anyone home?

291
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,540
Where's Javi?

292
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,819
- A long day?

293
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,459
- Where's Javi?

294
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:56,299
- I gave him the night off.

295
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,860
- Why, I'm starving!

296
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,700
- Because I thought my
guy needed pizza tonight.

297
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:05,299
- Pizza, Javi won't let
me eat pizza anymore.

298
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,219
- I know, that's why I
gave him the night off.

299
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:09,100
- Good boy.

300
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,419
- Seemed like you could use
a little more comfort food

301
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:14,379
and a little less tofu stir fry.

302
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,379
- Would you like some verve,
we're also celebrating.

303
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,699
- [Farleigh] Celebrating what?

304
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,099
- I got a job.

305
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,979
- [Farleigh] Really, where?

306
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,338
- At a travel agency.

307
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:31,458
- They still have those?

308
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:32,458
- Yes.

309
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:39,259
- Are you qualified?

310
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:42,019
(doorbell rings)

311
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:43,498
- Not yet.

312
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:44,978
Dinner first.

313
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,177
- I'm not hungry--

314
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:48,218
- Oh, lies, you just
said you were starving!

315
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:50,858
(doorbell rings)

316
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,498
(door rattling)

317
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,498
(scoffs) What in the hell
kind of hot mess are you?

318
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,258
- What, fuck face, you said
Farleigh likes 'em young,

319
00:15:59,298 --> 00:16:01,338
so this is what all
those fags are wearin'!

320
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,297
- That's perfect (laughs)!

321
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,058
My God, it's just
very convincing.

322
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,978
- Can it, homo, your
pizza's gettin' cold.

323
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:08,738
- Your dream, I'll
be right back.

324
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:09,777
- Yeah.

325
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,817
- Do you have a few
singles for a tip?

326
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:14,817
- Yes, sure.

327
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:16,297
- He's so cute, he
deserves a big one.

328
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,218
- Why, uh, I take it, I take it.

329
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,058
- [Dennis] Listen, you
had it, you had it--

330
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:19,978
- No, no, lemme get--

331
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:20,737
- He's cute.

332
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:23,457
(both chattering)

333
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:25,017
Whoa!
(Farleigh slams to floor)

334
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,376
What the holy hell's
going on here?

335
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,577
- Hey man, uh, who's this?

336
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:30,656
- This is my boyfriend,

337
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:31,857
just what is going on here?

338
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:34,177
- I'm sorry, I, I
thought you were alone.

339
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:35,897
- You must be kidding, I
leave you alone for a minute

340
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:37,137
to go and get change and you--

341
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,296
- I thought you said you
were gonna get changed

342
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:39,696
into something more comfortable.

343
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:40,976
- I'm quite
comfortable as it is,

344
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:42,577
thank you very much.

345
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:45,135
- I, I'm sorry, I thought, we
had a connection at the door.

346
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:46,697
Um, you're just, you're very--

347
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:47,615
- [Dennis] Very what?

348
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:50,137
- You're very fuckable.

349
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,576
Look, please don't tell
my boss about this!

350
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:53,897
- [Farleigh] Uh,
wait, wait, wait!

351
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:55,056
Your tip.
- Yeah.

352
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,297
(door rattling)

353
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:03,617
- Does that happen often?

354
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,976
- What can I say, I'm fuckable.

355
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:16,216
(Farleigh chuckles)

356
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:18,976
(Farleigh groans)

357
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:20,496
- [Dennis] Jesus Christ!

358
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:22,976
- [Farleigh] (groans) My
ankle, I think it's broken!

359
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,255
(Farleigh groans)

360
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:26,616
- Oh my God, are you OK?
(Farleigh sighs)

361
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:29,295
- No, I am fucking not OK,
what does it look like?

362
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:33,135
(panting) You are
your stupid candles!

363
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:35,815
(groans) Take me
to the hospital!

364
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,336
(Farleigh groaning over
dramatic electronic music)

365
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,494
- I'm sorry.

366
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:40,896
- [Javi] Now,
Farleigh, slow down.

367
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,016
I have something for ya.

368
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:42,934
- Oh, really?

369
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:44,056
- It's been in my
family for generations.

370
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,374
It's not antique, it's vintage!

371
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:49,815
- First day at work!

372
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:54,095
Well, aren't you
gonna wish me luck?

373
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:56,055
- Let's see how long it lasts.

374
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:58,575
(cane thunking)

375
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:03,174
Javi, have the impression that
this cane looks from Kohl's.

376
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,695
- [Javi]
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!

377
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:12,574
- I'm so sorry, we only
hire PhDs and higher,

378
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,294
including me, as a
doctor of philosophy--

379
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:16,415
- You know, I'm just bored,

380
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:18,414
and walking's kind of my gift.

381
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:21,495
- Absolutely, you're a
legend around here (scoffs).

382
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:24,094
Wonderkid at 17,
scores sugar daddy

383
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:25,973
at his first Fashion Week.

384
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,974
- I'm here to get my
car, but I don't see it.

385
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:34,453
You know where it might be?

386
00:18:34,494 --> 00:18:36,294
- [Man With Glasses] Is
every OK with Farleigh?

387
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:39,974
- Sure, why would nothing
be OK with Farleigh?

388
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:42,574
Wow!

389
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,534
Was I supposed to track that?

390
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:49,854
- It'd be nice if you
knew where it was.

391
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:55,014
♪ What lies in store ♪

392
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:58,172
♪ Something that is lost ♪

393
00:19:02,694 --> 00:19:04,413
- If you need money, you know,

394
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:07,813
I heard the accounting
department is
looking for people.

395
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:09,414
- You know, we do have

does pay for your college

so that's something you can
find out on the website.

398
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:16,093
Do you have the card?

399
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:17,653

403
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:33,933
(Dennis exhales heavily)

404
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,652
(customers chattering)

405
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:36,973
- Hey.

406
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:38,213
- Dude, what--

407
00:19:38,252 --> 00:19:39,132
- I've been lookin'
all over for you.

408
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:40,332
- Aren't you supposed to be

409
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:42,853
at a travel agency
or something'?

410
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:43,852
- I need to borrow some money.

411
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,452
- [Javi] (sniffs)
Are you stoned?

412
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:48,452
What about this job of yours?

413
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:49,812
- There is no job.

414
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:53,812
- You've been lyin' to Farleigh
for the last three weeks?

415
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:55,132
Oh my God, Dennis.

416
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:56,372
- [Dennis] Please,
it's just a loan.

417
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,731
- Does it look like
I got any money?

418
00:19:57,772 --> 00:19:58,732
- I'm up shit creek!

419
00:19:58,772 --> 00:19:59,651
- [Javi] Then why don't you hock

420
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:01,252
some of that jewelry you got?

421
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,772
- But these were gifts.

422
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:07,892
- Gifts?

423
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:09,811
Wow, true story,

424
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:15,691
Farleigh was designing a
Standard Hotel on Sunset,

425
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:17,572
I was takin' a course
to become a life coach.

426
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:18,811
The Vanity Fair
party was comin' up

427
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,371
and you know that's
everything to me.

428
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:23,371
And then all of a
sudden, Farleigh

429
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,932
and by what, you ask?

430
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:32,291
A boy, do you know who
that boy was, Dennis?

431
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,251
That boy was you, everything I
thought I built with Farleigh

432
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,331
was taken away from me, just
like that watch and that ring!

433
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,731
- [Dennis] These
used to be yours?

434
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,611
- Oh, oh, and that $40,000

435
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:44,611
Tiffany love bracelet,
the one that you leave

436
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,571
layin' around like
fuckin' costume jewelry?

437
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:48,131
Yeah, that one, too.

438
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:50,090
- [Dennis] I had no idea--

439
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:51,371
- Oh, eh-eh, all of a sudden,

440
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:53,051
I was bein' asked if
I wanted to stay on

441
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:54,731
as the in-house chef.

442
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:01,971
- I was your replacement.

443
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,931
You never said anything.

444
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,291
- 'Cause I got class, bitch.

445
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,891
- Do you think
there's someone else?

446
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,770
Some little skater
dude from Venice

447
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:16,011
with second-grade highlight
and low-riding shorts

448
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,010
that lets his ass whisper,

449
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,929
andquot;Come ride the
innocence out of me?andquot;

450
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,570
- Dennis, you never pay
much attention to his work.

451
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,050
I think he's shootin' today,

452
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,690
why don't you go surprise
him, wish him luck?

453
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,570
- I hate being
around those cameras!

454
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,370
- Dennis, you peacock
around all day anyway,

455
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,530
I don't understand,
what's the problem?

456
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,729
(customers chattering)

457
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:39,570
- Wait, I need gas money.

458
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:41,650
- Really, Dennis, really?

459
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,570
(scoffs) God, you're,

460
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,649
here, go, go, bye, bye, bye.
- Thank you.

461
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,170
(Javi sighs)

462
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:55,889
(traffic humming)

463
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:03,528
- [Director] Action!

464
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,489
- [Farleigh] And as we all
know, it's been rumored

465
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:08,609
that she has had affairs with
all of her husband's generals,

466
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:10,529
quite a party girl.

467
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,689
- Look, Farleigh, this
is a common perception

468
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:13,608
of Pauline Bonaparte.

469
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,169
What Pauline Bonaparte
is trying to do,

470
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,249
she's just trying to say up
yours to the French nobility.

471
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:18,529
She's not trying
to act like a pute,

472
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:21,529
she's trying to be a
revolutionary, you see?

473
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,449
- Yes, I, I, um,
I'm just impressed.

474
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:28,208
But well, that is when street--

475
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:29,328
- Meets chic.

476
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:30,329
- Oh my.

477
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:33,889
Dennis?

478
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:35,088
- [Dennis] For you.

479
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:37,248
- Uh, well, what
are you doing here?

480
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:38,448
- [Dennis] I just
wanted to wish you luck,

481
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:39,768
is that so unusual?

482
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,848
- Um, no no no, um, c-can we
take a break here, please?

483
00:22:41,888 --> 00:22:42,848
Can we take?

484
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:46,128
Oh, well, Dennis, uh, join us!

485
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:49,328
I would like for
you to meet Jasper.

486
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,207
- [Dennis] The pool boy?

487
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:52,968
- Yes, uh, Jasper
has been working

488
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:55,008
in a pool-related capacity.

489
00:22:56,048 --> 00:22:58,248
- What's he doing here?

490
00:22:58,288 --> 00:22:59,528
- (clears throat) I made him

491
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:01,087
the lead designer
of this project.

492
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:02,408
- What?

493
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,567
Is this restaurant underwater?

494
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:06,648
- (chuckles) I love
your sense of humor!

495
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:08,527
No, I am mentoring him.

496
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:13,487
- Mentor this, Mr. Chips.

497
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:16,288
(glass shattering)

498
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:21,368
- Quite a party, what, what
is the most impressive thing

499
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:23,246
that you would chose,

500
00:23:23,287 --> 00:23:26,647
that would occur to you
here at this sculpture?

501
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:30,047
- Um, well, this, this is a,

502
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:34,247
uh, it's a naked woman
and a, and a child.

503
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:36,167
Eh.

504
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:43,807
- [Dennis] I caught
Farleigh with the pool boy.

505
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,646
- What, what pool boy?

506
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:47,486
- The little Latin shit who
picks leaves out of our pool

507
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,327
is Farleigh's new designer.

508
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:53,126
- The one you called the
Colombian Keane painting?

509
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,286
Oh, you caught them fucking?

510
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:58,006
- No, not fucking, designing.

511
00:23:58,046 --> 00:23:59,926
- Well, that's
probably all it is.

512
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:01,567
- He's on the show.

513
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,765
- Ooh, yeah, that's not good.

514
00:24:03,806 --> 00:24:05,726
- [Diedre] Darling,
I need some help.

515
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:07,686
- I'm in the foyer!

516
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:10,726
- And who, pray
tell, is our visitor?

517
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,365
- Uh, it's a buddy
of mine from the gym.

518
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:17,166
- Hello, ma'am, I'm
Dennis, it's a pleasure.

519
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,566
I've read your column ever
since I was a little boy.

520
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:22,806
- You're much too kind.

521
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:26,886
- Eh, Dennis got into a
fight with his boyfriend.

522
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:31,006
- (gasps) How could
anyone possibly fight

523
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:33,926
with a young man so
handsome and divine?

524
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:37,525
Lonnie, darling, let's
get this one a drink.

525
00:24:37,565 --> 00:24:38,645
Perhaps an Arnold Palmer,

526
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,604
they could be so
refreshing in this heat.

527
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,445
- [Lonnie] Sure.

528
00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:47,005
- Of course.

529
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:51,125
- You know (sighs), men,
especially the powerful ones

530
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:54,885
with fragile egos, can be
so difficult sometimes.

531
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:58,885
Eh, Hilary, Clinton
that is, once told me

532
00:24:58,924 --> 00:25:01,605
after a beau and had
a legendary spat,

533
00:25:01,644 --> 00:25:03,685
andquot;You just need to get
back in the saddle

534
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:06,604
andquot;and ride them to
the finish line!andquot;

535
00:25:06,645 --> 00:25:08,885
- I'll remember that.
(Diedre chuckles)

536
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,004
I'm very sorry to have
stopped by unannounced.

537
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:14,245
Clearly, you two are off
to some kind of engagement.

538
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:17,884
- Oh, it's just some silly gala
raising money for something.

539
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:20,524
I have won an
award, I do believe.

540
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:22,964
That's how they force
ya to attend (laughs).

541
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:27,044
Oh, Lonnie, darling, I
am in dire need of a Kir.

542
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:29,604
- I should go, I can
talk to Lonnie later.

543
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:31,644
- Oh, I wouldn't
hear of such a thing!

544
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:33,684
I do not allow
wounded little birds

545
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:37,284
back into the wild to be
devoured by the alley cats,

546
00:25:37,323 --> 00:25:40,202
and certainly not one
as adorable as you.

547
00:25:40,244 --> 00:25:41,842
- Oh, I'll be fine.

548
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:44,043
- You should join
us at the gala.

549
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,163
- I couldn't impose,
besides, I'm hardly dressed.

550
00:25:47,203 --> 00:25:49,683
- That is easily
fixed, you appear to be

551
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:51,723
about my Lonnie's size.

552
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:54,042
I'm sure we will
find him something.

553
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,603
Lonnie, darling, we have
a third at the gala!

554
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:02,563
(crowd chattering over
pleasant piano music)

555
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,483
- [Morley] Did Diedre commit
to posting this story?

556
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:08,603
- [Betsy] Nope, no such
thing as free press, darling.

557
00:26:09,763 --> 00:26:10,923
- [Morley] The money
goes to a good cause.

558
00:26:10,963 --> 00:26:12,442
It's her boy toy
that's insufferable.

559
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:15,763
- [Betsy] (scoffs) They
say he's Ivy League.

560
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:19,243
- [Morley] Ocean League is
more like it (chuckles).

561
00:26:19,282 --> 00:26:21,323
- Diedre says his
cock is huge, oh,

562
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:23,282
and that other boy, Ethan--
(Morley gasping)

563
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:26,282
- Did sitting wars
at the charity table
become fashionable?

564
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:29,482
- (laughs) Paying
for sex, I applaud.

565
00:26:29,523 --> 00:26:33,562
Paying for love,
tragic (chuckles)!

566
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:35,723
- Excuse me,

567
00:26:38,282 --> 00:26:40,121
like you think
you're so important

568
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:44,202
because you're ran Fox for
three months in the 1990s.

569
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:47,162
Who cares, who fucking cares?

570
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:52,202
I know this guy, and
you're full of shit.

571
00:26:52,242 --> 00:26:53,642
- Let's get outta here.

572
00:26:53,682 --> 00:26:54,402
- What about Diedre?

573
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:55,881
- [Lonnie] Let's go!

574
00:26:57,442 --> 00:27:01,002
I just can't do this anymore,
like I really do love Diedre!

575
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:02,281
- [Dennis] I know that.

576
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:03,562
- I'd give anything to
have an Arnold Palmer

577
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:07,122
and my Kindle in the Adirondack
chair in the backyard.

578
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,761
- [Lonnie] Do we, wanna cut out?

579
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:17,282
- [Dennis] I don't
wanna go home.

580
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:20,601
- [Lonnie] Me either, I've got
Diedre's Amex in my pocket.

581
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:21,961
I think we should go
all out and get a suite.

582
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:24,801
- [Dennis] Ooh, money bags!

583
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:27,281
- How the fuck am I supposed
to run this household

584
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:30,641
if he's runnin' off with my
staff and not tellin' me!

585
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:32,121
(Javi grunts)

586
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:34,321
- Isn't it the issue
that he isn't telling me?

587
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:38,200
- No, no no no, don't
you dare feel defeated!

588
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,241
And don't you dare give up.

589
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:43,961
Farleigh is your man,
you fight for him!

590
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:44,841
- You didn't.

591
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:48,719
- Yeah, well, I didn't
love him, did I?

592
00:27:48,761 --> 00:27:49,881
Not like you do.

593
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,360
(Javi grunts)

594
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,401
He loves you, you have history.

595
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,680
- He does?

596
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:05,919
- He left you a note.

597
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,720
(water bubbling from faucet)

598
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,440
(paper rustling)

599
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,760
- Why are you helping me?

600
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,920
- Because we have history.

601
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,560
Go take a nap, you
look like shit!

602
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,598
- [Maitre D] Good
evening, darling.

603
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,679
- Good evening, how are you?

604
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,399
- [Maitre D] Specialty,
always on us.

605
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,679
- Thank you, sir.

606
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:37,679
- [Maitre D] I think
you'll care to love.

607
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:39,720
- Well, I should
be seeing as I do.

608
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,080
Good evening, how are you?

609
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:41,920
- [Man With Glasses] Good.
- How are you?

610
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,479
- Excuse me, thank you.

611
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,358
(patrons chattering over
rhythmic blues music)

612
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,479
- [Farleigh] You
know, and do you see?

613
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,719
- It's classy.

614
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,519
- And do you see the
reflection of the moon

615
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,079
on, on, on the roof?

616
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,519
(Jasper snickers)

617
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,318
Dennis, you remember Jasper?

618
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,679
- Yes, of course.

619
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,239
- Yes, of course.

620
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,359
- So, it's time for you boys
to get to know each other.

621
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:13,599
Jasper is the one who is
going to be the breakout star

622
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:15,879
of Hard Nock Design and you,

623
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,398
you are and you always
will be, my muse,

624
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:22,998
so it is imperative to
me that you get along.

625
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,239
- Dennis, I hope you don't mind,

626
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:26,838
we, uh, we already
ordered the wine.

627
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:29,397
I hate red and they have,
what, two bottles of French?

628
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:30,558
Farleigh, here, can't live

629
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,918
without the Marlborough
Sauvignon Blanc.

630
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,118
- Yes, I know.

631
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:39,558
- What's your, uh, what's
your story, Dennis?

632
00:29:39,598 --> 00:29:42,838
- I went to college and never
finished, how about you?

633
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:46,116
- I tried to convince him to
continue it and finish, but--

634
00:29:46,158 --> 00:29:47,917
- The point of going to
Santa Monica City is, what,

635
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,837
to be an assistant accountant?

636
00:29:49,878 --> 00:29:52,798
Can't do anything
important there.

637
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:55,357
- Where does one do
something important, Dennis?

638
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:56,397
- I don't know.

639
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:00,878
One of the Ivys, Brown maybe.

640
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:01,998
- No, I think we're going to go

641
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:03,837
with the Sonoma
Sauvignon Blanc, please?

642
00:30:03,877 --> 00:30:05,597
- Good choice.
- Thank you.

643
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,957
- You seem very precocious
for a barrio boy.

644
00:30:07,997 --> 00:30:11,077
- Dennis, that was both
racist and class-elitist.

645
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:12,797
- No, it's OK, I don't mind.

646
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:16,117
It's, uh, I'm very
proud of my background.

647
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:18,477
It may not be what you
value, but it's real.

648
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:19,957
That's enough for me.

649
00:30:19,997 --> 00:30:21,437
- (snickers) Oh,
you're so generous.

650
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:23,277
- So tell me again, how did, um,

651
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:25,917
Jasper show you
his authenticity?

652
00:30:28,037 --> 00:30:30,637
- Well, it was
actually at the pool.

653
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:34,197
- Ah, your favorite spot
to display your talent.

654
00:30:34,237 --> 00:30:35,757
- Well, Farleigh, here,
was having a little trouble

655
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:37,237
with the entrance and, uh--

656
00:30:37,276 --> 00:30:39,236
- That's never been
your problem with me!

657
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:41,797
- The entrance of the
restaurant, come on!

658
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:43,397
(Jasper laughing)

659
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:44,716
The stone, the stone wall,

660
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:46,516
the facade was just
too oppressive!

661
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,357
- It's true, yeah, he through
a pencil into the pool.

662
00:30:48,396 --> 00:30:49,916
I've never seen him so riled up.

663
00:30:49,956 --> 00:30:52,596
- (chuckles) And he fished
it out and started to sketch,

664
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:55,796
and he, he brought that, that,

665
00:30:55,836 --> 00:30:59,636
that creativity that he changed
the, the rhythm of the stone

666
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,676
that made it weightless,
and that was the moment.

667
00:31:02,716 --> 00:31:05,756
That was the moment when I
realized it would be a crime

668
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:09,155
not to take the boy out of
the hood and into my show.

669
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:11,916
- So where did you develop
this talent, Jasper?

670
00:31:11,956 --> 00:31:14,714
Your parents still
live in East LA?

671
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:18,076
- Uh, no, I never, never
met my parents, actually.

672
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:19,794
They died when I
was very young, so.

673
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:21,715
- I'm sorry for your loss.

674
00:31:23,835 --> 00:31:25,956
- It's OK, it happens, eh?

675
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:30,315
- You always tell me
that I inspire you,

676
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:34,075
but I know that I could never
be your creative partner.

677
00:31:34,115 --> 00:31:36,915
It's, pff, I can't
create anything.

678
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:40,955
You're talented and smart.

679
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:49,075
no matter the cost.

680
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:54,155
- Sometimes I realize
why I love you, Dennis.

681
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:57,355
- That's sweet (laughs).

682
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:01,834
Who's ready to order, huh?

683
00:32:03,274 --> 00:32:04,994
- [Farleigh] So, did
you like the food?

684
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:06,594
- [Jasper] Si, it's fantastic.

685
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:07,994
- Yes, it was excellent.

686
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:10,235
Oh, there he is, all right.

687
00:32:10,274 --> 00:32:12,754
(engine idling)

688
00:32:19,514 --> 00:32:21,394
I'll give Jasper a lift.

689
00:32:21,434 --> 00:32:22,754
Jasper, you drive?

690
00:32:24,154 --> 00:32:25,314
- [Jasper] Nice
seeing you, Dennis.

691
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:27,553
Hope to see you again
soon sometime, eh?

692
00:32:27,594 --> 00:32:30,674
- No worries, I'll
be right back home.

693
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:36,233
(engine rumbles away)

694
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:40,834
(moody indie rock music)

695
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:55,312
(birds chirping)

696
00:32:58,954 --> 00:33:01,993
(cane tapping on floor)

697
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:06,353
- [Dennis] Got Jasper home safe?

698
00:33:07,392 --> 00:33:09,032
- [Farleigh] I did.

699
00:33:11,192 --> 00:33:12,193
- It's six a.m.

700
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,712
Do you love me?

701
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:28,231
- Dennis, um--

702
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,312
- I love you.

703
00:33:31,072 --> 00:33:34,832
(birds chirping and whistling)

704
00:33:50,352 --> 00:33:53,472
(uneasy whooshing tones)

705
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:05,631
(expressive rock music)

706
00:34:20,471 --> 00:34:21,671
- [Lonnie] Somebody got married!

707
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:24,430
- Get the fuck outta
here, how did that happen?

708
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:25,671
- Well, I didn't come home,

709
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:27,391
and yesterday morning
when I stumbled in,

710
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,831
Diedre was out of
her mind with worry.

711
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:30,151
She thought I left
her after her friends

712
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:32,110
treated me like shit, anyhow,

713
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:34,231
she was so relieved that
I got back that she, uh,

714
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:35,631
immediately proposed marriage,

715
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,351
and, yeah, we did
it at the Caesars.

716
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:39,110
- All right, man,
congratulations!

717
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:39,871
- Thanks.

718
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,470
- You need a houseboy?

719
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:43,070
- [Lonnie] What are
you talkin' about?

720
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,910
- My days are numbered.

721
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:48,231
Farleigh's fucking the pool
boy, a.k.a. the lead designer

722
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:50,191
on the new cycle of his TV show.

723
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,150
- Honey, we have to get
Farleigh out of the house,

724
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,551
you can work him a lot better
without that pool slut around.

725
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,710
- That's not a bad idea.

726
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,950
- They are shutting
down next week

727
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,110
while they wait on
building inspectors.

728
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,390
- Perfect, give him a gift.

729
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,630
- A romantic getaway.

730
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,990
- You'll have to leave
that pool slut in charge

731
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,949
for a little while, you don't
need much time with Farleigh.

732
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,190
You got this!

733
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,630
- I think I'm losing.

734
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,110
- Dennis, you're one
hot piece of ass,

735
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,390
and you're charming
as all get out.

736
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,350
- Damn straight!

737
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,269
- Farleigh loves you,
seduce him again.

738
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,830
- There's just one problem.

739
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,229
- Aw, baby, those crow's feet
are barely even noticeable!

740
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,910
- That's not what I'm
talking about, bitch,

741
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,909
my problem is I'm broke.

742
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:22,829
I don't have any
money to be able

743
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:24,150
to book a romantic getaway.

744
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,749
- OK, well, we got ya covered.

745
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,550
- Farleigh knows I
don't have any money.

746
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,269
- How 'bout that travel
agency ruse you pulled?

747
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:32,189
Just tell him you gotta
go look at a property.

748
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:33,069
- Where?

749
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,029
- [Paulette] Yeah, where?

750
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,629
- My wife and I,
we have a place.

751
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:41,389
(chuckles) It's gonna
be all right, darling.

752
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:45,469
(plane engines roaring
over pleasant Latin guitar)

753
00:35:49,588 --> 00:35:53,389
(pleasant Latin guitar
over cars honking)

754
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:03,269
- Excellent,
already medium rare.

755
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:07,789
- I need a boat.

756
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:08,509
(boatman speaking
foreign language)

757
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:09,788
Uh, yes, now, please.

758
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:13,588
(boatman speaking
foreign language)

759
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:16,228
- [Javi] That's like two hours!

760
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:17,868
- Javi, I have this, thank you.

761
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:20,308
- I told you to let me
handle the arrangements!

762
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:24,388
(boatman speaking
foreign language)

763
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:29,948
(women chattering)

764
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:30,988
- I'm going in.

765
00:36:32,748 --> 00:36:35,748
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa,
I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.

766
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:37,747
Looks like you two
ladies could use a hand.

767
00:36:37,788 --> 00:36:40,787
- Why, yes, I think we could.
(Heather chuckles)

768
00:36:40,828 --> 00:36:42,787
- Baggage, huh, who needs it?

769
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:44,747
- So, are you coming or going?

770
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:45,628
- Uh, coming.

771
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:48,626
- Oh, good, us, too (giggles)!

772
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:50,387
- I hear you got the last boat.

773
00:36:50,428 --> 00:36:52,747
- Yeah, you looking for a ride?

774
00:36:52,788 --> 00:36:55,907
(Heather laughs)

775
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:59,547
So I work in social media
and Wall Street Journal,

776
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:00,827
and I got it basically--

777
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:02,827
- [Heather] Amazing,
so I have to talk

778
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:04,347
about it a little bit.

779
00:37:04,387 --> 00:37:06,067
- [Brittny] And then drunk
shopping is basically

780
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:07,067
number one destination.

781
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:08,667
- [Heather] Oh my God, totally!

782
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:11,067
- [Brittny] I set out an
entirely separate budget

783
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:13,386
and set up a different bank
account just for this trip.

784
00:37:13,427 --> 00:37:14,987
- [Farleigh] Thank you,
ladies, for the ride.

785
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:16,227
- [Brittny] Girl,
blow the fuck off!

786
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:17,466
- [Heather] I am!

787
00:37:17,506 --> 00:37:18,307
- [Farleigh] Thank
you, thank you.

788
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:19,827
- [Dennis] Hey, come on.

789
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:21,547
(women laughing)

790
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:23,347
You have it, your bags?
- I'm good.

791
00:37:23,387 --> 00:37:24,546
- I have a twisted
ankle, I'm not dead.

792
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:25,746
- [Dennis] Keep
that still, please.

793
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,307
Gentlemen, can we have
someone help this guy, please?

794
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,306
You OK?

795
00:37:30,787 --> 00:37:31,945
One more.

796
00:37:31,987 --> 00:37:34,186
- [Javi] Let's get
this bag off the boat.

797
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:36,386
- [Dennis] Thank you.

798
00:37:36,427 --> 00:37:40,466
- [Javi] Tell me we're gonna
have more service here!

799
00:37:51,826 --> 00:37:53,066
(door rattling)

800
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:55,505
- Can't be less worse,
this better be Xanadu.

801
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:06,306
Oh my Lord, is this the house
of that shrew Diedre Diamond?

802
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:09,745
- I don't know,
she must've rented

803
00:38:09,785 --> 00:38:12,264
this place out
through my agency.

804
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:15,385
- If it was, I don't
know what to say.

805
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:20,825
A weekend spent in this
debris of a storied career!

806
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:26,025
This is camp heaven,
will you look at this?

807
00:38:26,065 --> 00:38:30,025
Diedre Diamond with the stars
of yesteryear, there's, uh--

808
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:31,905
- Looks like you're happy
I stole him away from LA.

809
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:35,745
- Jack Lemmon (laughs),
Tony Danza, Tony Dana.

810
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:38,905
Oh, Bill Clinton,
yeah, of course!

811
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:40,744
- Should we find the
liquor and go step outside?

812
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:42,225
- I could look at these forever!

813
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:44,064
- You know I hear the
beach is clothing optional.

814
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:47,104

(Farleigh muttering)

836
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:16,462
- I understand, but whose idea

837
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:19,542
was that freestanding
oyster soleil bar?

838
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:21,462
And where is Jasper now,

839
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,222
then go find that little fuck!

840
00:40:23,262 --> 00:40:25,221
(phone beeps)

841
00:40:25,263 --> 00:40:27,622
- Something the matter?

842
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:31,462
- Yes, something's
the matter (scoffs)!

843
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:34,142
Gordon told Jasper that he
wanted that oyster soleil,

844
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,701
fucking Jasper thought
it was a brilliant idea

845
00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:38,542
to change all plans and
install a freestanding bar,

846
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:39,582
which, of course, had to fail

847
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:41,662
the final inspection of the ADA!

848
00:40:41,702 --> 00:40:43,422
- ADA?

849
00:40:43,462 --> 00:40:45,142
- Americans with
Disabilities Act,

850
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:46,942
'cause in this country,
even if you are crippled,

851
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:49,461
it is your God-given
right to sit

852
00:40:49,502 --> 00:40:51,582
at the oyster bar.

853
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:53,860
(Farleigh grunts)

854
00:40:53,902 --> 00:40:55,262
Fuckin' Jasper!

855
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:59,341
- Well, what does this
have to do with Jasper?

856
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:02,022
- Gordon Ramsey's gonna have
a fit when he's been told

857
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:04,062
that his celebrity opening
has been postponed,

858
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:07,141
and we don't have anyone
to tell him on camera!

859
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:10,181
I'm here and fuckin' Jasper
has gone missing, vanished!

860
00:41:10,221 --> 00:41:12,061
God knows where!

861
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:15,060
Christ, I should have
never allowed him

862
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,500
to take so much responsibility!

863
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:22,741
(breathing heavily) Dennis,

864
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:26,981
this season has to be the best.

865
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:28,861
If not,

866
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:36,660
(sighs) the show is what runs
my business, you understand?

867
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:41,300
Even if I make it
back in time, I, I, I,

868
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,220
I don't know if I can
reassemble the crew.

869
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,780
- Can you call a
friend to go on camera?

870
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,780
Nate Berkus?

871
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,780
- That ugly queen?

872
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,580
Over my dead body!

873
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,180
Javi, get me back on the next
flight to America, wherever!

874
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,340
- But what about our trip?

875
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,900
- Do, uh, excuse me?

876
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,260
Haven't you heard, you are
not the Queen of England,

877
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,020
and unless you
have a private jet,

878
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,019
the next available flight
is the day after tomorrow.

879
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,460
Now, you need some sunscreen.

880
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,258
(rhythmic Latin jazz music)

881
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:17,098
- [Farleigh] OK, OK,
what's the update?

882
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,380
- [Man On Phone]
So we weren't able

883
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,859
to get Gordon with
the camera team--

884
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,300
- No, the camera
team is not enough.

885
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:23,859
If Gordon Ramsey, if
Gordon Ramsey yells

886
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,179
and there's no one
there to be humiliated,

887
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,459
how can this be reality TV?

888
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:31,699
No, I'm, I'm in the
middle of a swamp!

889
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:32,819
- [Boatman] You
like my boat, huh?

890
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:35,179
- I've been eaten by snakes!

891
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:36,899
(phone beeping)

892
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:40,859
(sighs) Very nice here.

893
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:43,619
- Dennis, oh my fucking God!

894
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:44,859
(Heather chuckles)

895
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:46,099
- Hello, ladies!

896
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:48,138
- You guys have to join
us, we just got here.

897
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:49,419
- Brit, they're busy!

898
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:51,698
Their dad's not gonna
wanna take shots with us!

899
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:53,659
(Farleigh slaps table)

900
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:54,658
- Rubbish!

901
00:42:56,058 --> 00:42:57,499
Look, Brittny,
maybe you're right.

902
00:43:02,738 --> 00:43:05,618
So, what do you say,
let the adventures start

903
00:43:05,658 --> 00:43:06,738
and order some margaritas!

904
00:43:06,778 --> 00:43:07,498
(Heather laughs)

905
00:43:07,538 --> 00:43:09,299
- Yes, oh my God!

906
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:11,779
- I know we gonna have
some talk up there!

907
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:15,778
(all chattering over
pleasant Latin guitar)

908
00:43:17,018 --> 00:43:19,058
- [Brittny] OK, so he's
here visiting family.

909
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:20,738
- No, girl, he's here for work.

910
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:23,498
- OK, yeah, we meet
him at the ATM.

911
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:25,578
- [Heather] Oh my
God, he's so hot!

912
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:27,378
- Uh-huh, oh my God!

913
00:43:28,578 --> 00:43:29,617
He's here, he said
he might join us!

914
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:31,218
- (scoffs) Yes!

915
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:33,298
I think he might be from,
like, Europe or something.

916
00:43:33,337 --> 00:43:34,658
- Oh, now I'm even
more intrigued!

917
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:36,297
I love playing gay European.

918
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:37,857
- [Farleigh] I'd
love to see him, too.

919
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:40,057
- He's not European, he's
like a Colombia person.

920
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:42,177
- Well it doesn't, ooh!
- Oh!

921
00:43:48,777 --> 00:43:49,737
- Jasper?

922
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,337
wait!

923
00:43:54,377 --> 00:43:55,617
- I'll handle this, excuse me.

924
00:43:55,657 --> 00:43:56,817
- You know him?

925
00:43:56,857 --> 00:43:58,816
- This is so twisted,
did he follow us?

926
00:43:58,857 --> 00:44:00,297
- Will you explain
what's going on?

927
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,417
- That pool boy
is a homewrecker.

928
00:44:02,457 --> 00:44:05,415
- (scoffs) I told
you he was a mo.

929
00:44:05,457 --> 00:44:07,896
Wait, and what are you
doing cheating on Dennis?

930
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,897
- I'm not, that's
Dennis' boyfriend.

931
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:12,257
- Your dad?

932
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:14,496
- Oh my God, should we leave?

933
00:44:15,937 --> 00:44:17,577
No, no no, you can't.

934
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:21,417
Brit, phones down.

935
00:44:22,817 --> 00:44:24,776
OK, here's the deal.

936
00:44:24,816 --> 00:44:28,857
We all love chasing men
who don't want us, right?

937
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:33,496
I mean, it makes the
indifference that much sexier.

938
00:44:34,376 --> 00:44:35,216
Listen, you have
to give Farleigh

939
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,256
a chance to come chase you!

940
00:44:37,296 --> 00:44:40,616
I mean, you have to trust
that he's gonna come back.

941
00:44:40,656 --> 00:44:43,576
(relaxed Latin guitar)

942
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:55,095
(quietly tense and
uneasy ambient music)

943
00:45:08,295 --> 00:45:10,015
- Come on, let's go in.

944
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:17,015
(cane crunching into sand)

945
00:45:17,055 --> 00:45:18,815
- So are you planning on
telling me what's going on?

946
00:45:18,855 --> 00:45:20,934
- Ah, it all seems
rather complicated.

947
00:45:20,975 --> 00:45:21,895
- No doubt.

948
00:45:21,935 --> 00:45:24,134
- He said he freaked out.

949
00:45:24,175 --> 00:45:25,415
- About what?

950
00:45:25,455 --> 00:45:28,054
- The job, the show,
what it would mean,

951
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:30,614
and when he screwed up
that oyster bar inspection,

952
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:32,335
it seems to have
hit him all at once.

953
00:45:32,374 --> 00:45:33,855
- So he followed us down here?

954
00:45:33,894 --> 00:45:37,054
- No, his uncle lives
right outside of Cartagena.

955
00:45:37,095 --> 00:45:38,054
- What?

956
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:42,054
- His uncle, uh,
wanted to see him,

957
00:45:42,095 --> 00:45:44,774
and with the pretext of
a long-overdue visit,

958
00:45:44,815 --> 00:45:47,734
he's got an airline
ticket from him.

959
00:45:47,774 --> 00:45:51,814
- Bullshit, that's about as
real as your reality TV show.

960
00:45:55,094 --> 00:45:58,053
- Dennis, Javi got us tickets
to the next available flight.

961
00:45:58,094 --> 00:46:01,534
We'll be back in Los
Angeles day after tomorrow.

962
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:03,214
Set my chair up here.

963
00:46:04,774 --> 00:46:07,174
(objects thunk to the ground)

964
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:08,774
- I'm not your manservant.

965
00:46:13,094 --> 00:46:14,454
For fuck's sake!

966
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:18,373
(chair slams into sand)

967
00:46:18,414 --> 00:46:19,374
There.

968
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:24,373
(uneasy acoustic guitar over
ambient electronic music)

969
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:50,413
(water splashing)

970
00:47:11,172 --> 00:47:13,692
- [Jasper] Can I have a smoke?

971
00:47:16,452 --> 00:47:20,492
- Come on, Dennis, we can
make this work, can't we?

972
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:26,852
I have some questions I'd
like to ask him about you.

973
00:47:26,892 --> 00:47:29,012
- Don't, don't worry
about my uncle, please.

974
00:47:29,052 --> 00:47:32,212
(Dennis chuckles)

975
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:35,332
- (sighs) You're
hiding something.

976
00:47:35,372 --> 00:47:38,492
(crickets chirping)

977
00:47:41,211 --> 00:47:42,691
- Dennis, I'm not
hiding anything,

978
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:44,611
I just have to make things
right with Farleigh, you know?

979
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:45,690
- Mm, I'll say!

980
00:47:47,852 --> 00:47:51,651
I've never seen him
so worked up (scoffs)!

981
00:47:52,851 --> 00:47:56,211
You're good for him,
much better than me.

982
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:01,171
Did you check on him
when he got back?

983
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,571
- You've been drinking, Dennis.

984
00:48:02,611 --> 00:48:04,891
- Answer the fucking question!

985
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,530
- No, no, I didn't check on him.

986
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:13,651
- He depends on you,
and when you leave him

987
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,371
to fester like
that, it torches--

988
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:17,571
- What?

989
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:20,529
- If you hurt Farleigh
in any way at all,

990
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:21,930
I will kill you.

991
00:48:27,331 --> 00:48:29,050
- [Jasper] Good night,
Dennis (grunts).

992
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:32,451
(water splashing)

993
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:35,090
(Jasper gasping)

994
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:42,730
(slightly uneasy
electronic music)

995
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,530
(door rattling)

996
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:04,209
- I thought we might all go
see Jasper's uncle today.

997
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,569
(clears throat)
It's beautiful out,

998
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,369
good day for a visit,
don'tcha think?

999
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:14,568
- What do you think
you are doing, Dennis?

1000
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:15,569
- Me?

1001
00:49:17,009 --> 00:49:18,250
- He's taken ill.

1002
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:20,889
- Really.

1003
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:23,449
- Yes, pushing him in
the pool, excuse me!

1004
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:25,769
(Jasper sighs)

1005
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:32,169
How do you feel, my boy?

1006
00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:34,768
- (groans) I didn't mean,

1007
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:37,249
(groans) didn't
mean to get so sick.

1008
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:39,049
I'm sorry if I ruined your day.

1009
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:41,048
- [Farleigh] It's
not your fault.

1010
00:49:41,088 --> 00:49:43,369
We need to play it
very easy and slow,

1011
00:49:43,408 --> 00:49:44,648
so we have you back on set

1012
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:46,728
as a normal,
functioning human being.

1013
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:47,928
- [Jasper] Yes, thank you.

1014
00:49:47,968 --> 00:49:49,328
- [Farleigh] Yes.

1015
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:50,329
- Wow!

1016
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:53,808
(Jasper sighs)

1017
00:49:57,528 --> 00:50:00,089
Well, someone ought
to enjoy the day.

1018
00:50:00,128 --> 00:50:03,448
(rhythmic acoustic guitar)

1019
00:50:14,088 --> 00:50:18,128
(Dennis speaking
foreign language)

1020
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,886
(Dennis sighs)

1021
00:50:33,487 --> 00:50:34,207
(Dennis speaking
foreign language)

1022
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:35,127
- Allow me.

1023
00:50:37,727 --> 00:50:40,688
My name is Peter,
care for a cigarette?

1024
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:44,207
- Gracias.

1025
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:47,527
(lighter flicking)

1026
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:50,046
(Dennis grunts)

1027
00:50:51,287 --> 00:50:53,567
How did you know this
is just what I needed?

1028
00:50:53,606 --> 00:50:55,167
- I've spent enough
time in Tangiers to know

1029
00:50:55,207 --> 00:50:58,207
the look of a man
who needs tobacco.

1030
00:50:58,247 --> 00:51:00,766
(Dennis laughs)

1031
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,727
- [Dennis] You spent
time in Tangiers?

1032
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:04,527
- That's one of those
places, you know?

1033
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:05,487
Hard to avoid.

1034
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:08,647
- Do you live around here?

1035
00:51:08,686 --> 00:51:12,726
- Here, (clicks tongue)
I am just visiting.

1036
00:51:21,726 --> 00:51:23,246
Do you have a lover?

1037
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,486
- I'm not sure anymore.

1038
00:51:26,526 --> 00:51:29,686
- How's it that you aren't
sure you have a lover?

1039
00:51:29,726 --> 00:51:32,166
One tends to have one or not.

1040
00:51:34,686 --> 00:51:36,726
- Affairs of the heart.

1041
00:51:36,766 --> 00:51:39,565
- This person is,
no doubt, a fool.

1042
00:51:41,926 --> 00:51:43,726
- I think I'm the fool.

1043
00:51:46,926 --> 00:51:48,286
- Life is cruel.

1044
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,085
- [Dennis] Hmm.

1045
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:54,765
- Hey, would you like to
see where I'm staying?

1046
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,206
- I would.

1047
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,126
- [Peter] It's a
delight to play host.

1048
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:05,005
- So, is this your place?

1049
00:52:05,046 --> 00:52:06,485
- [Peter] In a way.

1050
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,565
- Why are you so vague?

1051
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:12,724
- [Peter] You're a charming guy,

1052
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:14,645
but I want to present
myself carefully.

1053
00:52:14,685 --> 00:52:17,085
I would find it gross
to flaunt wealth

1054
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:19,085
or possessions in front of you.

1055
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:22,203
- I'm from Los Angeles where
that's a ritual mating call.

1056
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:25,285
- Wealth is so unimportant
in the long run.

1057
00:52:25,325 --> 00:52:27,284
That's why I don't
want to play that game.

1058
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:30,044
- Only rich people say that.

1059
00:52:30,084 --> 00:52:33,884
- (scoffs) Yeah, but maybe
they know it to be true.

1060
00:52:35,004 --> 00:52:38,044
- And what, pray tell,
is more important?

1061
00:52:38,765 --> 00:52:39,725
- Beauty,

1062
00:52:40,684 --> 00:52:43,325
perhaps, if there is
such a thing, love.

1063
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:45,044
- You don't believe in love?

1064
00:52:45,084 --> 00:52:47,763
- I think it's a bit like God.

1065
00:52:47,804 --> 00:52:49,724
You'll never really know
he's real until you know.

1066
00:52:49,764 --> 00:52:51,884
- And how do you know?

1067
00:52:51,924 --> 00:52:52,924
- You meet him.

1068
00:52:56,604 --> 00:52:59,284
(water splashing)

1069
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:03,844
(Dennis coughs)

1070
00:53:04,964 --> 00:53:07,923
(tableware clanking)

1071
00:53:10,923 --> 00:53:14,203
(Dennis sighs)

1072
00:53:14,243 --> 00:53:18,043
I'd like you to stay, and
not just for the night.

1073
00:53:19,124 --> 00:53:20,803
The one who is waiting,
does he love you?

1074
00:53:25,043 --> 00:53:26,883
- I don't know anymore.

1075
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:31,323
- I could love you.

1076
00:53:33,683 --> 00:53:34,723
Stay with me.

1077
00:53:36,243 --> 00:53:38,283
Tomorrow, I have to take
care of some personal things

1078
00:53:38,323 --> 00:53:42,363
in Cartagena, but after that,
we can stay here forever.

1079
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:50,562
but I can't.

1080
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:58,962
- Well, because
I still love him.

1081
00:54:05,402 --> 00:54:09,442
(pleasant guitar over
dreamy electronic music)

1082
00:54:22,081 --> 00:54:25,121
(waves gently crashing)

1083
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:38,401
(crickets chirping)

1084
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:41,761
- You back?

1085
00:54:41,802 --> 00:54:43,161
- [Dennis] I am.

1086
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:46,281
Where is everybody?

1087
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:48,002
- Asleep, we'll all be going

1088
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:50,801
to Jasper's uncle
tomorrow morning.

1089
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,001
- We are?

1090
00:54:57,321 --> 00:54:58,281
- Yes.

1091
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:02,680
He just wanted to cancel it,

1092
00:55:02,721 --> 00:55:05,601
but I told him he can't do
that, that's very impolite.

1093
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:09,680
His uncle wouldn't stand for
such a thing, and me neither.

1094
00:55:10,881 --> 00:55:13,280
- Sounds good, I'll
make sure to shave.

1095
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:23,599
(Farleigh sighs)

1096
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,319
(lips smacking)

1097
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:00,319
- You better go to sleep,

1098
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,919
- Aren't you coming?

1099
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:11,399
- Perhaps in a bit, I,

1100
00:56:11,439 --> 00:56:13,639
I still have some work to do.

1101
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,999
(Dennis sighs)

1102
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:25,759
(distant siren blaring
over humming traffic)

1103
00:56:28,479 --> 00:56:30,559
- [Javi] Are you sure this
is your uncle's neighborhood?

1104
00:56:30,598 --> 00:56:32,919
- (sighs) I should've never
brought you guys here.

1105
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:34,438
I should've come on my own.

1106
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:35,639
- Under no circumstances

1107
00:56:35,678 --> 00:56:37,039
would I have allowed
you to come here alone.

1108
00:56:37,078 --> 00:56:39,398
- I would've been fine.

1109
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:41,518
- You would've been abducted!

1110
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:42,519
- If only!

1111
00:56:49,438 --> 00:56:50,759
- [Farleigh] Here we go.

1112
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:53,798
- Does anybody see
this long-ass gun?

1113
00:56:56,238 --> 00:56:59,758
(Enrique speaking
foreign language)

1114
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:02,678
(Farleigh speaking
foreign language)

1115
00:57:02,718 --> 00:57:03,558
- Wh-what's his name?

1116
00:57:03,598 --> 00:57:06,518
- Enrique, it's me, Jasper.

1117
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:10,198
(Enrique speaking
foreign language)

1118
00:57:10,237 --> 00:57:12,757
- [Farleigh] So can we go, OK.

1119
00:57:15,118 --> 00:57:16,798
(Enrique speaking
foreign language)

1120
00:57:22,117 --> 00:57:23,437
- [Jasper] I want to, uh,
introduce you to my friends.

1121
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:25,637
This is Farleigh, Javi.
(group chattering)

1122
00:57:25,677 --> 00:57:26,637
In the back is Dennis.

1123
00:57:26,678 --> 00:57:27,518
- [Uncle] Have a seat.

1124
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:28,557
- [Farleigh] Thank you, gracias.

1125
00:57:28,598 --> 00:57:29,957
- I didn't know you were
traveling with friends!

1126
00:57:29,997 --> 00:57:31,317
- [Jasper] Si, si.

1127
00:57:32,837 --> 00:57:36,117
- [Dennis] (clears throat) Hola.

1128
00:57:36,157 --> 00:57:39,356
- [Peter] And I
welcome the unexpected.

1129
00:57:41,677 --> 00:57:43,797
Please excuse the
dramatic arrival,

1130
00:57:43,837 --> 00:57:47,677
but these days, one must
take extra precautions.

1131
00:57:49,317 --> 00:57:51,237
- You're Peter Cardones.

1132
00:57:53,397 --> 00:57:55,477
I recognize him from his work.

1133
00:57:55,516 --> 00:57:57,316
He's one of the most influential
South American artists

1134
00:57:57,357 --> 00:58:00,437
to have emerged since the 1990s.

1135
00:58:00,476 --> 00:58:02,197
- You have quite
an educated eye.

1136
00:58:02,236 --> 00:58:03,876
- His sculptures
and installations

1137
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:06,197
draw on architecture
and geography to explore

1138
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,517
the psychological, biological,

1139
00:58:08,556 --> 00:58:11,596
and economic aspects
of urban oppression.

1140
00:58:11,636 --> 00:58:13,556
- [Peter] Yeah, that's right.

1141
00:58:13,597 --> 00:58:15,396
- [Farleigh] Well, he's
been to every major museum

1142
00:58:15,436 --> 00:58:16,476
in the world, and so--

1143
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:19,476
- [Peter] So, what have
you been up to, my boy?

1144
00:58:19,516 --> 00:58:21,356
- Ah, the question of the hour.

1145
00:58:21,396 --> 00:58:22,636
- I, I've been designing.

1146
00:58:22,676 --> 00:58:26,195
I'm even, uh, even going
to be on his TV show.

1147
00:58:26,235 --> 00:58:27,675
- Hard Nock Design?

1148
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:29,596
- (chuckles) Well, uh,
didn't know I had a following

1149
00:58:29,636 --> 00:58:32,196
in Colombia, thank
you, I'm flattered.

1150
00:58:32,236 --> 00:58:36,195
- I don't think, uh, a
reality show is a great idea.

1151
00:58:37,676 --> 00:58:40,756
- Oh, we are very excited
to have Jasper on board,

1152
00:58:40,795 --> 00:58:42,956
to have him take the lead
on all of our project.

1153
00:58:42,995 --> 00:58:45,115
- It's true, Tio, I mean, this,

1154
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:48,195
this show can change
my whole career.

1155
00:58:48,235 --> 00:58:50,395
Eh, it's, the
exposure from a show

1156
00:58:50,435 --> 00:58:52,276
like this, it's, it's priceless.

1157
00:58:52,315 --> 00:58:54,955
- But you won that
big award at college!

1158
00:58:54,995 --> 00:58:56,755
What was it called again?

1159
00:58:56,795 --> 00:58:58,275
- You went to college?

1160
00:58:58,315 --> 00:58:59,474
- I, I think that college

1161
00:58:59,515 --> 00:59:00,835
might be overstating
it a little bit.

1162
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,355
- Overstating it?

1163
00:59:03,635 --> 00:59:07,395
Jasper is a graduate from the
Rhode Island School of Design.

1164
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:11,475
- You went to RISD?

1165
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:14,035
- So you haven't
answered my questions.

1166
00:59:14,075 --> 00:59:16,554
Why do you need to be on TV?

1167
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,794
- I want access to
a bigger clientele.

1168
00:59:18,835 --> 00:59:22,474
A TV show is like, it's
like a big commercial.

1169
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:24,994
- Or a soap opera?

1170
00:59:25,035 --> 00:59:29,035
- (chuckles) Sir, I
take offense on that.

1171
00:59:30,594 --> 00:59:33,155
My TV show is as authentic
and artistic as your work,

1172
00:59:33,794 --> 00:59:35,274
just in a different way.

1173
00:59:35,314 --> 00:59:37,194
- I mean, Tio, I've tried
many avenues of work,

1174
00:59:37,234 --> 00:59:39,754
but it's (sighs), I mean,
you know how difficult it is

1175
00:59:39,794 --> 00:59:41,354
to get your material recognized.

1176
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:44,034
- Now that's the trouble
with your generation.

1177
00:59:44,074 --> 00:59:47,153
You wanted instant
applause, instant approval.

1178
00:59:47,194 --> 00:59:49,193
- Tio, it's like you and
your privileged friends

1179
00:59:49,234 --> 00:59:51,193
worked very long before
you found success.

1180
00:59:51,234 --> 00:59:53,753
- We changed this country.

1181
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:54,914
We showed passion--

1182
00:59:54,954 --> 00:59:56,434
- But that's a luxury
where there is--

1183
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:59,434
- You have to show passion,
aggression, revolution!

1184
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:00,394
You are an artist!

1185
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:02,234
- If the world were upholstery,

1186
01:00:02,273 --> 01:00:04,993
I'm just an interior
designer, that's it!

1187
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:06,593
(slap cracking)

1188
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:08,273
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

1189
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,874
I must insist that you do
not put your hands on him.

1190
01:00:10,913 --> 01:00:14,953
(tense and uneasy
electronic music)

1191
01:00:40,193 --> 01:00:42,592
- You are being extremely rude!

1192
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:46,913
- You make my boy think he
can fuck his way to greatness?

1193
01:00:46,952 --> 01:00:48,993
You are pathetic,
that's what you are!

1194
01:00:49,032 --> 01:00:52,072
To fuck an old man is to
trade youth for possession,

1195
01:00:57,192 --> 01:01:00,152
- I don't have to listen
to you, you are pathetic!

1196
01:01:00,192 --> 01:01:01,152
You are

1197
01:01:02,552 --> 01:01:03,992
an outdated cabron!

1198
01:01:06,832 --> 01:01:10,232
- Not good enough for your
nephew, but good enough for me?

1199
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:14,072
(tense and uneasy
electronic music)

1200
01:01:19,112 --> 01:01:21,791
- Because you are damaged,
you will never grow

1201
01:01:21,831 --> 01:01:23,071
or know what love is.

1202
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,792
- Beg your pardon?

1203
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:27,672
- I won't let my Jasper
get involved into this!

1204
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:29,592
He will not sleep
his way to the top!

1205
01:01:29,631 --> 01:01:31,870
That's for whores,
that's for actors!

1206
01:01:31,912 --> 01:01:33,871
- Javi, let's go.

1207
01:01:33,911 --> 01:01:36,751
- Tio, you think you love
me, but you obviously don't.

1208
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:37,951
We have to go, Dennis.

1209
01:01:37,991 --> 01:01:38,911
- Of course, I love you!

1210
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:40,830
- No, it's time to go, Dennis.

1211
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:43,351
- Listen, I gave up
my life to raise you.

1212
01:01:43,391 --> 01:01:44,991
I let you fulfill your dreams!

1213
01:01:45,031 --> 01:01:46,511
I let you go to America!

1214
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:47,271
- [Jasper] You let me?

1215
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:48,711
- Si, I let you!

1216
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:50,551
(shove thudding)

1217
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:53,271
(punch thwacking)

1218
01:01:55,431 --> 01:01:59,471
(men grunting over tense
and uneasy acoustic guitar)

1219
01:02:00,831 --> 01:02:01,671
- Let's go!

1220
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,670
(gun cocking)

1221
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:09,590
- Get your faggot
asses out of here!

1222
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:18,630
- [Farleigh] It's a
Philippe Starck lamp!

1223
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:20,390
- [All] Go, go, go, go!

1224
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,870
- [Javi] Run (groans).

1225
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:24,229
- [Farleigh] It's a piece
of art, don't shoot!

1226
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:26,750
(men chattering in
foreign language)

1227
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:29,430
- [Dennis] This
is nuts (groans)!

1228
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:30,950
(taxi driver speaking
in foreign language)

1229
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,230
- [Javi] Go, go, go!

1230
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,870
(all chattering over
tense acoustic guitar)

1231
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:35,869
- Let's go, let's go, come on!

1232
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,310
- What in goddamn hell was that?

1233
01:02:38,349 --> 01:02:39,630
What in goddamn hell was that,

1234
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:40,470
you could've gotten us killed!

1235
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:41,750
- I know, I'm sorry!

1236
01:02:41,789 --> 01:02:43,510
- And not only did you
put us all in danger,

1237
01:02:43,549 --> 01:02:44,470
you're a liar!

1238
01:02:44,509 --> 01:02:46,790
- I know, I'm a complete shit.

1239
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,229
- Why deny your past,

1240
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:50,230
there's nothing to
be embarrassed of.

1241
01:02:50,269 --> 01:02:52,029
- I didn't deny anything!

1242
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,469
I came in here in
street clothes,

1243
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:54,910
and you start
speaking Spanish to me

1244
01:02:54,949 --> 01:02:56,150
and creating this story, OK?

1245
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,909
I just didn't correct you!

1246
01:02:57,949 --> 01:02:59,629
- I didn't need a story.

1247
01:02:59,669 --> 01:03:02,469
- [Jasper] You wouldn't have
let me on TV without a story.

1248
01:03:02,509 --> 01:03:03,509
- I would have.

1249
01:03:03,549 --> 01:03:05,949
- [Jasper] But the
producers wouldn't have.

1250
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:10,029
(Jasper sighing and gasping)

1251
01:03:10,669 --> 01:03:11,669
- Come on, my boy.

1252
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:15,989
I know it's not
your fault, I know.

1253
01:03:16,029 --> 01:03:18,268
Everything will be fine now.

1254
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:20,949
He can't hurt you anymore, huh?

1255
01:03:20,988 --> 01:03:23,748
Huh?
(Jasper groaning)

1256
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:34,269
- I can't believe this happened!

1257
01:03:34,308 --> 01:03:36,189
Have your bags
packed by seven a.m.,

1258
01:03:36,228 --> 01:03:37,588
the water boat will be here,

1259
01:03:37,628 --> 01:03:39,708
and if you're not down
at breakfast by six,

1260
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:41,588
you do not get a fruit cup!

1261
01:03:41,628 --> 01:03:44,187
(dramatic piano)

1262
01:04:04,148 --> 01:04:06,747
(cane tapping)

1263
01:04:23,347 --> 01:04:24,187
(picture cracks on counter)

1264
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:28,267
(motorbike engine sputtering)

1265
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:30,067
(dog yawning)

1266
01:04:30,106 --> 01:04:33,747
(expressive but
pleasant ambient music)

1267
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:41,506
- How's the eye?

1268
01:04:41,547 --> 01:04:43,787
- (sighs) It's fine.

1269
01:04:43,826 --> 01:04:44,786
Jerk.

1270
01:04:45,587 --> 01:04:46,547
- Excuse me?

1271
01:04:48,906 --> 01:04:51,946
- I saw you laugh
when I got punched.

1272
01:04:51,986 --> 01:04:53,986
- It was funny,

1273
01:04:54,026 --> 01:04:55,426
and long overdue.

1274
01:04:55,467 --> 01:04:56,987
- It was your fault.

1275
01:05:01,706 --> 01:05:04,265
(couch creaking)

1276
01:05:10,946 --> 01:05:13,546
(urine bubbling)

1277
01:05:17,066 --> 01:05:20,546
(expressive acoustic guitar)

1278
01:05:23,026 --> 01:05:26,225
- I'm gonna shower,
wash off the grime.

1279
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:31,106
(rhythmic electronic music)

1280
01:05:33,585 --> 01:05:36,425
- Brittny, hi, it's Dennis.

1281
01:05:36,466 --> 01:05:39,465
I need to borrow your
hotel room at 6:30.

1282
01:05:39,506 --> 01:05:41,105
No, you guys can't be there.

1283
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:45,185
I need to show Farleigh the
parasite that Jasper really is.

1284
01:05:47,264 --> 01:05:48,665
He hasn't seen what I've seen.

1285
01:05:48,705 --> 01:05:51,505
(shower hissing)

1286
01:05:51,545 --> 01:05:52,505
Hey.

1287
01:05:56,505 --> 01:05:59,705
I called Nate Berkus, he's gonna
cover the show with Gordon.

1288
01:05:59,744 --> 01:06:01,985
- [Farleigh] Ah,
no, not him (sighs).

1289
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,024
- Don't be mad.

1290
01:06:04,265 --> 01:06:07,145
The girls invited
us to their hotel.

1291
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:12,304
Jasper and I are gonna meet
them for a sunset cocktail.

1292
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,704
I don't care if I
lose everything,

1293
01:06:14,745 --> 01:06:16,225
I don't care if I lose Farleigh,

1294
01:06:21,984 --> 01:06:23,704
I'm not gonna see Farleigh hurt.

1295
01:06:23,744 --> 01:06:25,064
- [Farleigh] You're
going with Jasper?

1296
01:06:25,104 --> 01:06:27,024
- I'm trying to be nice.

1297
01:06:29,584 --> 01:06:31,184
- [Farleigh] It becomes you.

1298
01:06:31,224 --> 01:06:33,224
- And leave us some tequila.

1299
01:06:33,264 --> 01:06:34,983
Remember, seven sharp!

1300
01:06:38,664 --> 01:06:42,703
Ready to go, I told the
girls I'd meet them early.

1301
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,143
- What about Farleigh?

1302
01:06:47,184 --> 01:06:48,744
- They'll meet us.

1303
01:06:57,743 --> 01:06:58,703
(rapping on door)

1304
01:06:58,743 --> 01:06:59,984
Brittny, Heather?

1305
01:07:05,983 --> 01:07:08,903
(door rattling)

1306
01:07:08,943 --> 01:07:11,143
Guess they're running late.

1307
01:07:11,183 --> 01:07:12,782
- Should we go
back to the lobby?

1308
01:07:12,823 --> 01:07:14,343
- Oh, look, tequila!

1309
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,343
(Jasper sighs)

1310
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,743
They said meet 'em for a drink.

1311
01:07:32,262 --> 01:07:35,582
- I, I don't know I should
be drinking their tequila.

1312
01:07:36,662 --> 01:07:39,783
(liquid sloshing)

1313
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,902
(Jasper snickers)

1314
01:07:42,943 --> 01:07:45,902
(Jasper gasps and coughs)

1315
01:07:45,942 --> 01:07:48,302
It's good, it's strong.

1316
01:07:48,342 --> 01:07:52,102
(quiet and airy ambient music)

1317
01:07:56,582 --> 01:07:57,982
- Since we've found
ourselves alone,

1318
01:07:58,022 --> 01:08:00,101
I suppose I'll say my piece.

1319
01:08:03,182 --> 01:08:06,981
(clicks tongue) I want
to ask your forgiveness.

1320
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:09,782
- Excuse me.

1321
01:08:09,822 --> 01:08:12,102
- I've treated you horribly.

1322
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:16,542
- I, I, I wouldn't say that
you've treated me horribly.

1323
01:08:16,581 --> 01:08:18,862
- I have, it's just, you know,

1324
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:24,021
I'm jealous (chuckles).

1325
01:08:24,061 --> 01:08:26,142
- Y-you're jealous of me?

1326
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:28,461
- Your beauty,
your intelligence.

1327
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:32,301
- Um, well, Dennis, this
stuff about RISD, I--

1328
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:35,861
- Hey, I think that's
cool, it sounds fun.

1329
01:08:35,901 --> 01:08:38,701
Wish I did college (scoffs).

1330
01:08:38,741 --> 01:08:40,261
Maybe then Farleigh
and I could communicate

1331
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,581
the way you two do.

1332
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:44,581
(distant chattering)

1333
01:08:49,261 --> 01:08:51,700
Woo (scoffs),

1334
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,540
Don't wanna ruin my
shirt before dinner.

1335
01:09:07,701 --> 01:09:11,300
- Yeah, it's nice
(clears throat).

1336
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,420
- I suppose I should just
come out with it already.

1337
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,860
I'm stepping aside.

1338
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:29,419
Farleigh clearly loves
you, and you him.

1339
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,699
- I, I don't think that you,
that you understand, Dennis.

1340
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:35,699
- No, I do, I do, it's fine.

1341
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:38,140
Seriously, it's fine.

1342
01:09:38,179 --> 01:09:40,579
Farleigh and I had a great run.

1343
01:09:42,499 --> 01:09:46,539
(laughs) What's funny is
it's just I'm beginning

1344
01:09:47,659 --> 01:09:49,699
to understand what
Farleigh sees in you.

1345
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:51,859
I can't help but
see it for myself.

1346
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:55,939
(rhythmic, quietly
tense percussion)

1347
01:09:58,539 --> 01:10:01,539
I suppose after all
this time, I'm...

1348
01:10:03,138 --> 01:10:04,859
a little bit in
love with you, too.

1349
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:12,618
- I can't believe
you just said that.

1350
01:10:13,698 --> 01:10:16,379
What time is
Farleigh coming back?

1351
01:10:17,578 --> 01:10:18,538
- 7:30.

1352
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:25,418
(Jasper panting)

1353
01:10:27,418 --> 01:10:31,258
(energetic thumping percussion)

1354
01:10:38,938 --> 01:10:41,537
(belts jingling)

1355
01:10:45,578 --> 01:10:48,058
(lips smacking)

1356
01:10:49,937 --> 01:10:52,858
(Jasper panting)

1357
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:02,697
(lips smacking)

1358
01:11:04,018 --> 01:11:05,577
Slow down, slow down!

1359
01:11:05,617 --> 01:11:07,978
Slow down, slow down!
- Why, why?

1360
01:11:08,017 --> 01:11:09,337
- Slow down!

1361
01:11:09,377 --> 01:11:10,458
- I don't wanna slow down.

1362
01:11:10,497 --> 01:11:13,577
(rhythmic percussion)

1363
01:11:18,297 --> 01:11:22,336
(both moaning over
energetic hand claps)

1364
01:11:39,176 --> 01:11:41,696
(lips smacking)

1365
01:11:55,096 --> 01:11:58,256
(expressive vocal choir)

1366
01:12:11,135 --> 01:12:13,696
(Jasper sighing)

1367
01:12:18,616 --> 01:12:20,735
- This is, um, unexpected.

1368
01:12:21,975 --> 01:12:25,935
- (chuckles) You could say that.

1369
01:12:28,055 --> 01:12:29,775
- What about Farleigh?

1370
01:12:30,855 --> 01:12:32,855
- What about Farleigh?

1371
01:12:32,896 --> 01:12:34,495
- You were after him.

1372
01:12:35,855 --> 01:12:38,095
- Farleigh has to be,
what, 50 years old?

1373
01:12:38,135 --> 01:12:40,495
I'm not after Farleigh.

1374
01:12:40,535 --> 01:12:42,775
- But that night,
after the party,

1375
01:12:42,815 --> 01:12:44,855
Farleigh spent the night.

1376
01:12:46,214 --> 01:12:50,095
- He spent the night, it's
not like he didn't try, but,

1377
01:12:54,054 --> 01:12:54,975
- I'm the one you want?

1378
01:12:55,014 --> 01:12:55,935
- Yes.

1379
01:12:55,974 --> 01:12:56,934
- Why?

1380
01:12:58,854 --> 01:13:02,655
- Because every time I'm with
you, my heart goes crazy.

1381
01:13:05,734 --> 01:13:07,855
- My plan was to ruin you.

1382
01:13:11,094 --> 01:13:13,495
(Jasper sighs)

1383
01:13:17,094 --> 01:13:19,214
Get dressed, get dressed.

1384
01:13:19,254 --> 01:13:20,254
- What?

1385
01:13:21,174 --> 01:13:24,574
- Farleigh's gonna
be here any minute.

1386
01:13:24,614 --> 01:13:28,654
(water bubbling over
pleasant ambient music)

1387
01:13:55,773 --> 01:13:56,613
Jasper and I--

1388
01:14:02,413 --> 01:14:03,892
- Why?

1389
01:14:03,933 --> 01:14:06,333
- Because I did it to hurt you.

1390
01:14:14,653 --> 01:14:15,613
- Jealous.

1391
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:19,013
- I wish you had
ever looked at me

1392
01:14:19,053 --> 01:14:22,333
the way I've seen
you look at him.

1393
01:14:22,372 --> 01:14:24,492
- But I don't love Jasper.

1394
01:14:26,252 --> 01:14:27,413
- The first time he
came to our place,

1395
01:14:27,452 --> 01:14:29,812
I knew I would lose you to him.

1396
01:14:31,612 --> 01:14:33,692
- Then why did you hire him?

1397
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:40,212
- Because I thought I
could still have him first.

1398
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:43,372
- I'm not ready to leave you.

1399
01:14:45,452 --> 01:14:46,292
I love you.

1400
01:14:49,172 --> 01:14:51,292
- I know, and I loved you.

1401
01:14:55,332 --> 01:14:56,492
I do love you.

1402
01:14:58,731 --> 01:14:59,691
You know,

1403
01:15:05,412 --> 01:15:09,252
(scoffs) people
always told me that

1404
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:11,331
I was a fool to keep you.

1405
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:17,971
But, um, I was the young boy

1406
01:15:18,011 --> 01:15:19,931
who could not grow up, I

1407
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:29,971
(Farleigh laughs)

1408
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:34,330
(water splashing)

1409
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:38,411
(unsettling and ominous
electronic music)

1410
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:41,851
(slaps cracking)

1411
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:46,490
Hey!

1412
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:51,371
(unsettling and ominous
electronic music)

1413
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:54,490
Javi, can you call,
uh, 911, please?

1414
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:58,570
(uneasy pulsing
electronic tones)

1415
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:14,650
(pleasant but vaguely
uneasy ambient music)

1416
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:21,890
- What you wanna hit, is
desire, in season six--

1417
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:25,689
(voices become muffled and airy)

1418
01:16:25,729 --> 01:16:27,850
Shut, shut the fuck
up for a second.

1419
01:16:27,889 --> 01:16:29,929
Remember that it's
designed for life

1420
01:16:29,969 --> 01:16:31,889
and no, this isn't art.

1421
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:35,449
I cared about Farleigh
as much as anybody,

1422
01:16:35,489 --> 01:16:38,729
so just give me a
smile, something to, OK.

1423
01:16:42,489 --> 01:16:43,449
You good?

1424
01:16:43,489 --> 01:16:44,289
- Si.

1425
01:16:44,329 --> 01:16:45,409
(door alarm beeping)

1426
01:16:45,449 --> 01:16:46,409
- Here we go.

1427
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:50,289
(crowd chattering)

1428
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:52,529
I don't know why they have,

1429
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:55,889
this has happened so many times.

1430
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,409
I beg your pardon.

1431
01:17:02,568 --> 01:17:06,209
(crowd chattering over
uneasy acoustic guitar)

1432
01:17:29,368 --> 01:17:30,448
- Been inside?

1433
01:17:30,488 --> 01:17:32,607
- I have, it's a madhouse.

1434
01:17:34,328 --> 01:17:36,408
I hear they're giving
your boy Jasper the show.

1435
01:17:36,447 --> 01:17:39,128
Out with the old,
in with the new.

1436
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:41,648
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

1437
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:43,768
(horns honking)

1438
01:17:43,808 --> 01:17:45,687
So how's life in probate?

1439
01:17:45,728 --> 01:17:48,208
- I have to find a
new place to live.

1440
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:50,207
- [Paulette] I thought
he left you everything?

1441
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,566
- Farleigh was up to
his eyeballs in debt.

1442
01:17:52,608 --> 01:17:55,287
It's no wonder he was
wanting me to get a job.

1443
01:17:55,328 --> 01:17:57,288
- Did you get anything?

1444
01:17:57,327 --> 01:17:59,527
- Couple hundred thousand.

1445
01:17:59,567 --> 01:18:02,247
Stashed it away in
some sort of trust.

1446
01:18:02,287 --> 01:18:04,127
- See, he did love you!

1447
01:18:09,847 --> 01:18:11,647
What are you going
to do with it?

1448
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:15,487
- I applied to college, I
wanna teach art history.

1449
01:18:16,887 --> 01:18:19,607
- Good for you, you
always were the smart one.

1450
01:18:19,646 --> 01:18:22,887
(horns honking)

1451
01:18:22,927 --> 01:18:24,445
How's the kid doing?

1452
01:18:24,486 --> 01:18:26,806
- He keeps leaving messages.

1453
01:18:28,046 --> 01:18:30,727
I can't return the calls,

1454
01:18:30,766 --> 01:18:34,686
but I can't just seem to
delete the messages, either.

1455
01:18:34,727 --> 01:18:37,286
- You are smitten, I can tell.

1456
01:18:37,327 --> 01:18:39,566
- Don't tell Lonnie, OK?

1457
01:18:39,606 --> 01:18:41,486
He thinks I love him.

1458
01:18:41,526 --> 01:18:44,406
(Paulette chuckles)

1459
01:18:44,446 --> 01:18:47,326
- [Paulette] Come
on, it's starting.

1460
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:53,886
Hey, you don't have to do this.

1461
01:18:57,086 --> 01:18:59,526
Come on, lemme take you home.

1462
01:19:04,766 --> 01:19:07,245
- [Javi] Damn, the fuck is this?

1463
01:19:09,085 --> 01:19:12,126
- I've watched you
do this for 10 years.

1464
01:19:13,845 --> 01:19:14,925
Trust me.

1465
01:19:14,965 --> 01:19:18,326
(pleasant acoustic guitar)

1466
01:19:25,325 --> 01:19:27,805
I can't help but feeling guilty.

1467
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:37,045
- We've been through this,
it wasn't your fault.

1468
01:19:37,085 --> 01:19:40,285
- I didn't want all
this, not without him,

1469
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:43,845
and yet, here I am.

1470
01:19:49,165 --> 01:19:52,045
(envelope rustling)

1471
01:19:59,244 --> 01:20:02,564
(pleasant acoustic guitar)

1472
01:20:03,804 --> 01:20:06,284
- Farleigh left me the,
the deed to the house?

1473
01:20:06,324 --> 01:20:08,524
- No, I'm giving it to you.

1474
01:20:10,124 --> 01:20:12,004
- You don't want it?

1475
01:20:12,044 --> 01:20:15,963
- It's a mausoleum now,
it was always Farleigh's.

1476
01:20:20,804 --> 01:20:22,044
I know you want it,

1477
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:25,924
you and Farleigh built
this house together.

1478
01:20:30,963 --> 01:20:32,723
- [Javi] We have
history you know.

1479
01:20:32,764 --> 01:20:36,123
(pleasant acoustic guitar)

1480
01:20:44,283 --> 01:20:45,363
(Javi gasps)

1481
01:20:45,403 --> 01:20:48,803
(pleasant ambient music)

1482
01:21:02,403 --> 01:21:05,082
(Dennis sniffles)

1483
01:21:06,882 --> 01:21:09,843
(footsteps clacking)

1484
01:21:15,962 --> 01:21:19,762
(water bubbling over
relaxed folk rock music)

1485
01:21:32,002 --> 01:21:33,042
- I miss you.

1486
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:37,722
(wine bubbling)

1487
01:21:37,762 --> 01:21:41,000
(relaxed folk rock music)

1488
01:21:48,681 --> 01:21:50,722
- [Jasper] There you are.

1489
01:21:53,602 --> 01:21:57,521
I was hoping I'd at least
get to see you tonight.

1490
01:21:59,202 --> 01:22:00,842
- I'm sorry I left.

1491
01:22:03,482 --> 01:22:06,681
- Well, meanwhile, the network
wants to replace Farleigh

1492
01:22:10,681 --> 01:22:13,761
- Javi's looking
for a new pool boy.

1493
01:22:16,481 --> 01:22:20,281
- You know, Dennis, you weren't
the only one that loved him.

1494
01:22:32,921 --> 01:22:34,601
- I got you something,

1495
01:22:44,201 --> 01:22:46,880
(water splashing)

1496
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,640
- What?

1497
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,840
- A job, I convinced
the producers

1498
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:05,560
to keep you on as
Nate's assistant.

1499
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,520
It's not much, but it's
better than pool boy wages.

1500
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,520
- Dennis.

1501
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,160
- Yes.

1502
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,399
- (sighs) I love you.

1503
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:22,439
- You don't understand love.

1504
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,879
- I, but I mean it.

1505
01:23:28,559 --> 01:23:30,199
- Hold your breath.

1506
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:32,999
