00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,668
(planet humming)
(graphic chiming)

2
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:06,576
(birds chirping)

3
00:00:06,626 --> 00:00:09,470
- [Nora] This is my favorite poem.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,353
Do you like it?

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:12,780
- I don't know.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,910
I don't know it.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,500
- It's called, "Bursting Embers".

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,620
It's special to me.

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,920
- I don't remember that one.

10
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,510
Did that Walt Whitman guy write it?

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,070
- No, silly.

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,180
That poetry teacher it looks
like I should be subbing more.

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,500
- I like it when you sub.

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,660
- So do I.

15
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,560
Mr. Marciello, he's never around.

16
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,620
He wants me home with the children more.

17
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,450
- Yeah, where are they?

18
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,040
- Nikko and Nora,
they're playing upstairs.

19
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,540
They're a good team together.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,220
I wanna share this poem with you.

21
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,220
May I?

22
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,570
- Yeah, I like it when you read.

23
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,700
Should I close my eyes like before?

24
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,703
- Yeah, sit back.

25
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,763
Feel the energy.

26
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,280
The red of passion has pulled
below surging, coursing,

27
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:03,330
flowing through, a tender
face, skin so white as.

28
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:07,360
- What's the matter?

29
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,193
Do you hear something?

30
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:09,650
- Nah, it's just hard to focus in here.

31
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,607
It's very stuffy in here.

32
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:13,990
The lighting's better and softer upstairs.

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,943
- Nah, I don't think I should.

34
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:17,300
- Shh, shh, shh, relax.

35
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,133
It's okay.

36
00:01:18,183 --> 00:01:19,440
It's just poetry.

37
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,840
- What about Mr. Marciello?

38
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,110
- He won't be home for hours.

39
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,403
You know, college president.

40
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,060
He's never home anymore.

41
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,326
It's just me, the children, and poetry.

42
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:32,159
- I don't know.

43
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,180
I don't wanna get in trouble.

44
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,560
Just a freshman here.

45
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,410
- No, Donny, don't be
silly, nothing will happen.

46
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,970
Besides I'm the wife of
the college president,

47
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,650
doesn't that give me any clout?

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,430
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

49
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,750
- Yeah.

50
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,380
Okay, take my hand.

51
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,019
Let's bring the energy with us.

52
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,902
- Okay.

53
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,533
- Here, sit here.

54
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,940
Take your shoes and socks off.

55
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,323
The red of passion has pulled below,

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,060
surging, coursing flowing through.

57
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,733
A tender face, skin so white,

58
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,250
would flush with passion's glow.

59
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,133
- Feels nice.

60
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,740
- [Nora] The glow is so
fine and delicate threads

61
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,130
has spread beyond the plain.

62
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,630
It lies and waits for passion barb

63
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,590
to drive its master home.

64
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,473
- Oh, yeah.

65
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:59,780
- Wait, can you feel what the energy is?

66
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,643
This poem it's moving you, I can tell.

67
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,160
Let me finish my poem.

68
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,130
Once home the master must wait

69
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,423
for all is not at once.

70
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,363
To savor.

71
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,123
Sip.

72
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,577
Taste the fruit.

73
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,403
There's joy once held by all.

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,163
But now the day when passion begs.

75
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,143
To shed its needful way.

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,683
The powers to beg, to use,
to find our hidden stay.

77
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:51,402
(birds chirping)

78
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:54,035
(sultry music)

79
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,967
(birds chirping)

80
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:02,600
(sultry music)

81
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:08,980
(birds chirping)

82
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,613

83

84
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:21,723
(door clicks)

85
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:25,634
(door bangs)

86
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,600
- Nora, it's the middle of the day, what?

87
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,940
- Oh, god, Frank.

88
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,530
Thank god, you're home.

89
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,090
He asked me to help him with poetry.

90
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,701
- What the hell is this?

91
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:39,534
Huh?

92
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:40,720
What the fuck is this?

93
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,760
- He asked me to help him.

94
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,180
- Who you think you are
you little fucking prick?

95
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,830
- Hey, man, she told me to come up here.

96
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,210
- Frank, he's lying.

97
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,649
- Shut up!

98
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,251
(body thuds)

99
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:52,240
- [Donny] I ain't see nothing, man.

100
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,100
I ain't do nothing.

101
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,003
- You ain't doing nowhere.

102
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:55,757
Where you going boy, huh?

103
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:56,590
You going somewhere?

104
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,980
You in a hurry, huh?

105
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,813
You in a hurry?

106
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,301
You come in all of 30 seconds.

107
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,134
(body thuds)

108
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,282
Come on, boy, come on.

109
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,263
You weren't in a hurry when
you were fucking my wife.

110
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:05,402
- Stop it, Frank!

111
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,103
- Come on, man!

112
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:09,300
You fuck my wife on my bed

113
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,550
and you wanna leave so quickly.

114
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,358
Get up, 'cause I'm gonna kill you.

115
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:13,271
And you look at me.
- Stop it, Frank.

116
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:14,200
- You look at me you're fucking that guy!

117
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,750
- Frank, stop it!

118
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:17,985
(Donny groaning)

119
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,270
(Frank laughing)

120
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,403
- Shut up, 'cause you're fucking next!

121
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,411
Come on!

122
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:24,450
Where you going, boy?

123
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,319
How's that feel?

124
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:26,577
A little rough, doesn't it?

125
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:27,410
Faggot.

126
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,243
Huh?

127
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:29,809
You like fucking my wife, huh?

128
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:30,642
You like her big titties?

129
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:32,760
You like 'em, huh?

130
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,887
Come on, say something now!

131
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:38,457
(Frank grunting)

132
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:41,257
(Frank grunting)

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,052
Jesus Christ.

135
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:49,014

(Frank screaming)

137
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,560
- Nikko, Nora.

138
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,507
Oh my god.

139
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:03,810

140
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,610

- Last night, man, what
about this morning?

158
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,615
A little sunrise special?

159

(group laughing)

160
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,720
- I didn't really like her.

161
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,447
She was so forward.

162
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:49,210
Look buddy, forward's
better than backwards.

163
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,630
You know what I'm saying?

164
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,677
- Hey, my roommate said,

165
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:54,470
"He saw that new poetry
teacher, Ms. Crane."

166
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,690
He said, "She is hot."

167
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,530
- Right, man.

168
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,750
Give me a fucking break,
a hot English professor?

169
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,110
Shit ain't gonna happen. Walter.

170
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,080
- Get a life, Walter.

171
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,860
English teachers come
in one of two versions,

172
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,100
if they're men they're gay
guys in tweedy jackets.

173
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,590
And if the woman they're old

174
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,500
and pinched up with that library smell.

175
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,990
- Dude, what the hell's a library smell?

176
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,240
- You know, man, when you were a kid,

177
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,620
you used to spend time
hiding out in the library,

178
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,093
sniffing the insides of
the bindings of books.

179
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,040
Well, that's what it smells like.

180
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,820
- Yeah, that's, that's a little more

181
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,390
than we needed to know, man.

182
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,700
- Nah, man, I heard it too.

183
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,480
She's supposed to be quite a package.

184
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,113
Nice tits and a great ass.

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,016
- What the fuck is up with you guys?

186
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,490
- [Jason] Whoa, someone's pissed.

187
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,460
- [Justin] Look out, Jason,
it'll be heading your way.

188
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,293
- Screw you.

189
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:42,910
You're acting like a bunch of adolescents.

190
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,430
- Ah. (blows raspberry)

191
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,350
No, you're an adolescent.

192
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
- Someone's upset that
she's losing her title

193
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,479
of whore du jour.

194
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,640
- Ooh, ooh.

195
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,720
- Oh really?

196
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,350
Why don't you and your
wrestling bud go fuck yourselves

197
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,250
since that's what you do anyway isn't?

198
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,740
- I think she misses the finer points

199
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,060
of the ancient sport.

200
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,540
- All right, Josh, give it
a fucking rest, all right?

201
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,520
- I'll tell you guys,

202
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,930
I saw her down in the president's
office, she's fat man.

203
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,551
- No, my roommate said,
"She's really slender."

204
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:12,140
(group laughing)

205
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,070
- Oh Walter, we can always
count on you to keep it real.

206
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
- It's not like you guys haven't
seen a pretty girl before,

207
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,410
so why do you have to
be so gross about it?

208
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,200
- We're not being gross, we're being guys.

209
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,540
- Seems to me, the only person

210
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,810
who's acting like a man
around here is Walter.

211
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,850
- Ah.

212
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,500
Well, you know, I guess standards

213
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,020
just ain't what they used to be.

214
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,320
- Well, I heard she transferred
from another college.

215
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,280
- Whoa, okay, who let the freshman speak?

216
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,779
- Permission was not granted.

217
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:39,612
(Brad laughs)

218
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,445
(paper thudding)

219
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:41,278
- I just assumed-

220
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:43,640
- Ouch, violation number two.

221
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,170
- Pledge, refrain from
vocalizing without permission.

222
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,277
- Yeah, shut up.

223
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:50,190
(group laughing)

224
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,110
- Were they always like this?

225
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,113
- Always.

226
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,990
- Hey, can we get back
to talking about her ass?

227
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,440
- The day we have a poetry
teacher with a nice ass

228
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,790
is the day that.

229
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,670
- A nice ass?

230
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,570
Well, I hope I can be more than that.

231
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,200
Good morning.

232
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,200
I'd like to introduce myself.

233
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,580
My name is Ms. Nora Crane.

234
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,760
I will be your instructor here

235
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,510
for the remainder of the semester.

236
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,550
I'm glad to join the
faculty here at Omega Prep,

237
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,193
and I look forward to our
time together this year.

238
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,220
Poetry has been a chief
love of mine for many years.

239
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,040
The words, the rhythm,
the energy of poetry

240
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,623
can do amazing things.

241
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,280
I hope to bring the joy of poetry

242
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,033
into each and every one of you.

243
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,670
I want us to develop a relationship

244
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,973
that is powerful and intimate.

245
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,870
- [Walter] Excuse me, Ms. Crane.

246
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,900
- Yes.

247
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,130
- Will there be a midterm?

248
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,140
- Walter, shut up.

249
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,105
What the fuck?

250
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:50,080
- (scoffs) Idiot.

251
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,720
- What's your name?

252
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,000
- Walter, Walter Merrick.

253
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,550
- Well, Walter, assessment
of learning is crucial,

254
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,650
but I hope to find much more
creative ways of finding out

255
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,550
what you know and what you're able to do.

256
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,310
- Uh, Ms. Crane, you'll find the guys here

257
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,520
at Omega Prep do really good creative.

258
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,530
(group laughing)

259
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,423
- I can tell that already.

260
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,930
At my last school, I was able to involve

261
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,780
many of my best students
in a poet society.

262
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,550
The purpose of our group
was to gather like minds,

263
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,720
to think and share the power of verse.

264
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,020
We met as often as we could
to enlarge our horizons

265
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,010
and swell our minds.

266
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,833
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

267
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,810
- If there is interest here,
as I suspect there will be,

268
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,030
I've planned to pull
together a poet society here

269
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,433
at Omega right away.

270
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,390
It seems we have a unique location

271
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,270
already designed for our meetings.

272
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,415
- The Lambda Chi house, yeah.

273
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:47,050
- Yeah!

274
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,740
- Not exactly.

275
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,080
It seems the ancestral caves

276
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,604
of the local Passamasoute
Tribe are close to campus.

277
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:58,600
The Passamasoute actually used those caves

278
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,150
for sacred and secret ceremonies

279
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,370
involving the retelling of tribal verse

280
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,940
and manly rights of passage.

281
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,663
- Uh, no pledges allowed, right?

282
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,890
- Well, the poets society
will be what we make of it.

283
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,293
It's up to all of you
how intimate it becomes.

284
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,230
Let's begin today's lecture.

285
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,150
Those interested in the poet society

286
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,470
come see me after class.

287
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,380
Open your anthologies to page 443,

288
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,162
the poem titled, "Stiff Wooden Soldier".

289
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:31,962
(group laughing)

290
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,760
It worked perfectly.

291
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,580
It was easier than the last school.

292
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,008
I talked about the poet society

293
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:42,600
and their eager little eyes just lit up.

294
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,440
I think it's safe to say as men,

295
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,183
they rose to the occasion.

296
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:51,840
- Gee, Nora, you're a funny sister,

297
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,540
and you're so smart too.

298
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,430
- Thanks, Nikko.

299
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,883
With the two of us this
always works out fine.

300
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,310
Must say I like this
garden getup much better

301
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,770
than that food service
geek you were last time.

302
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,410
- Uh, thanks, Nora.

303
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,370
I like it better too,

304
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,790
because it gives me more
time to be on outside

305
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,660
with the birds and the grass.

306
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,094
- Don't go soft on me now!

307
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:13,190
We have plenty of work to do.

308
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,310
My class is full of 'em.

309
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,310
- Really, Nora, full of 'em?

310
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,920
- Lots, and they're ready to go.

311
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,753
- Ooh.

312
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:21,250
Do you think there are any nice ones?

313
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,910
- Nikko, don't be stupid!

314
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,901
There aren't any nice ones!

315
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:26,430
- No, I just thought I
could have a friend, Nora.

316
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,250
- No, you can't have a friend!

317
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,640
God, Nikko, why do I have to
go over this so many times?

318
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,473
They're all bad.

319
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:33,090
They're all dirty.

320
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,760
All they talk about is sex.

321
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,590
All they think about is getting some

322
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,400
and I'm gonna give 'em some!

323
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,520
- I just want a friend who-

324
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,620
- When you talk like this

325
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,140
you're totally disrespecting
our mother and father!

326
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,160
You know what happened.

327
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,440
You know what those guys did.

328
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,510
They're all dirty.

329
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,003
They all will pay!

330
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,300
(Nora sighs)

331
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,303
Anyways, Nikko, I'm your friend.

332
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,423
I'll take care of you.

333
00:13:56,907 --> 00:13:58,890
- I know you're right,
Nora, it's just that-

334
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,080
- Quick, one of my students is coming.

335
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,180
Go rake or something.

336
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:16,240
- Uh, excuse me, Ms. Crane.

337
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,073
- Yes.

338
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,690
- Um, I was just wondering-

339
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,440
- You're in my poetry class, aren't you?

340
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,273
- Yeah.

341
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:23,650
Why you remember me?

342
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,410
- How could I forget a face like that?

343
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,040
What's your name?

344
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,026
- Jimmy.

345
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,750
Jimmy Sparks.

346
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,403
- Well, hello, Mr. Sparks.

347
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,760
- Um, you can call me Jimmy.

348
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,633
- Well, then you just call me Nora.

349
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,883
- Okay.

350
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,943
- Jimmy, come sit with me for a moment.

351
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:49,320
- You, you know, I, I, I wanted to ask you

352
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,720
about poet society at your last school.

353
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,910
- My last school?

354
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,040
- Yeah, the guys, I mean your students

355
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,890
must have been really
lucky to have something,

356
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,723
you know that great.

357
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,800
- Oh, yes, they got a lot out of it.

358
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,770
- Yeah, it's great you wanna
start one here and all too.

359
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,880
- Really?

360
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,030
- Yeah.

361
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,597
Guys would be dying to get in it.

362
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:10,465
- You think so?

363
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:11,963
- I would.

364
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,920
- You're sweet, and also very handsome.

365
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,590
Let me tell you something,

366
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,499
get the feeling that
you really like poetry.

367
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:24,350
- I, I do.

368
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,120
- And that you really understand

369
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,623
what this poet society's all about.

370
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,700
- Definitely.

371
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,400
- Why don't you join me for
the first meeting tonight?

372
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,330
- Really?

373
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,740
Me?

374
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,090
I don't know, I'm, I'm just a freshman.

375
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,790
- All the better you have
that spark, that energy.

376
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,393
The society needs you.

377
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:47,350
- Um, wouldn't the other guys
get a little angry though?

378
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,150
- Jimmy, I'll take care of the other guys.

379
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,360
You don't worry.

380
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,003
You just bring your sharp
mind and your smiling face.

381
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,260
- Awesome.

382
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,490
Um, what time?

383
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,410
Where?

384
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,243
- After dusk.

385
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,020
You know the woods behind the stadium?

386
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,813
- Yeah.

387
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:04,340
- Follow the trail up over the hill.

388
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,240
Off to the right is the
entrance to the cave.

389
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,790
We'll be in there.

390
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,750
- Wow.

391
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,410
Thanks, miss, I mean Nora.

392
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,243
Um.

393
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:13,310
- Don't thank me.

394
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,180
It's your own wonderful qualities

395
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,750
that have brought us together.

396
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,248
I want this to be very special.

397
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:20,535
- I gotta go.

398
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:22,540
I'm gonna be late for class.

399
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,490
Um, thanks, thanks a lot.

400
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,390
Um, I'll, I'll see you tomorrow.

401
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,623
- See you tonight, Sparky.

402
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,438
Sometimes this is just too easy.

403
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:36,600
(ominous music)

404
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,050
- [Jimmy] Ms. Crane, are you in there?

405
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,883
- Right this way, Jimmy.

406
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:40,773
Come sit down.

407
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:43,887
- Uh, this place is really,

408
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:47,743
oh, I, I mean, hi, how
you doing. Ms. Crane?

409
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:48,760
- Didn't we cover this before?

410
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,663
It's Nora.

411
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,580
The artifacts reflect the ancient people

412
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,530
who once used this cave
as a sacred meeting place.

413
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,490
- Really?

414
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,323
- Yes.

415
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:59,340
Young men of the tribe
used to come to this cave

416
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,140
to come of age.

417
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,023
- Awesome.

418
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,710
Where are the other guys?

419
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,590
- Didn't I tell you to take care of them?

420
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,803
They'll be here later.

421
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,280
Why don't you take off
your shoes and socks?

422
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,461
- What?

423
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:14,483
Uh, why?

424
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,520
- Well, this technique always works.

425
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,723
The ancients used it, trust me.

426
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,970
Now relax.

427
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,193
Close your eyes.

428
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,480
Through ancient ways in nature's layer.

429
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,710
Pull from the man the struggle thoughts.

430
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,702
Just breathe.

431
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,585
Just look.

432
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,513
Just love.

433
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:43,890
- Oh, Nora, I never had a
teacher like you before.

434
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,160
- You're such a charmer.

435
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,670
Now let's get down to business.

436
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,970
I wanna start your initiation

437
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,900
into the poet society right away.

438
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,980
- Already?

439
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,020
- Well, that way you'll be on the way

440
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,521
before the other boys arrive.

441
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:57,654
- Oh, well, I don't know.

442
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,943
Whatever you say.

443
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,780
- Take off your shirt.

444
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,230
- What?

445
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,576
- For the initiation, silly.

446
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:07,653
- Okay.

447
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
- Now there, come a little closer to me.

448
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,063
Relax and breathe deeply.

449
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,233
Give me your hands.

450
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,623
Close your eyes.

451
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,253
Repeat after me.

452
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,770
The poet's pen I love to hold.

453
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,913
- The poet's pen and I love to hold.

454
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,020
- Yet sacred more the words he molds.

455
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,430
- It's sacred more the words he molds.

456
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,850
- To prove my love for bard's own verse.

457
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,160
- [Jimmy] To prove my
love for bard's own verse

458
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,250
- I share his pain,
quick, taut, and terse.

459
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,729
- Share his pain, quick, taut, and terse.

460
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:57,612
Ah, ah.

461
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,353
- It's okay, it's just a pen prick.

462
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,399
Let me see.

463
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:04,322
(lips smack)

464
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:06,640
Just like when you're a boy at camp.

465
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,273
- I didn't go to camp.

466
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,283
- Let me see.

467
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,463
There's my poetic warrior.

468
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,493
- Oh, if you say so.

469
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,400
- Now just relax.

470
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,280
You finished the first part.

471
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,163
- [Jimmy] I did.

472
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,855
- Yeah, come sit over
here with your back to me.

473
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:32,738
- Huh?

474
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,653
- Now just relax and breathe deeply.

475
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,820
Oh, Eros' wings take flight.

476
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,500
Take flight.

477
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,083
Help us all to allude the night.

478
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,560
The night of darkness we fear so well,

479
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,747
they cannot escape the lover's bell.

480
00:19:56,797 --> 00:20:01,403
The bell that rings for souls so pure.

481
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,412
- Wow.

482
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:08,850
- So innocent, so free.

483
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,713
So mindful, so sure.

484
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,433
The not expecting the final cure.

485
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:19,280
(Jimmy groaning)

486
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,369
- What are you doing?

487
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,490
No, I can't-
- Cure that is swift and true.

488
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,260
- I, I can't breathe.

489
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,927
- Given to those who just deserve.

490
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,840
- Lord, my god, I can't breathe.

491
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,197
(Jimmy groaning)

492
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:37,172
(groans) Let go.

493
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:40,800
(groaning) Let go.

494
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,313
I don't wanna be in this
poet society anymore.

495
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:45,658
(suspenseful music)
(Jimmy groaning)

496
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:50,708
(Jimmy coughing)
(ominous music)

497
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:52,902
(suspenseful music)

498
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,702
(Jimmy coughing)

499
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,850
- Do him like Daddy did.

500
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:06,952
(Jimmy groaning)

501
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:09,752
(Jimmy groaning)

502
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,020
(Jimmy gurgling)

503
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,820
(Jimmy coughing)

504
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:27,639
(Jimmy gasping)

505
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:30,439
(Jimmy groaning)

506
00:21:40,857 --> 00:21:43,524
(ominous music)

507
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,213
Good work, Nikko.

508
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,490
Our father would've been proud.

509
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,760
- [Nikko] Thanks, Nora.

510
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,770
You got everything ready though?

511
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,050
- Yeah, well, whatever.

512
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,310
Will you take care of this one, will ya?

513
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,673
This little shit wore me out.

514
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,853
I'm gonna go lie down.

515
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,760
- Okay, Nora.

516
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,910
- [Nora] Well, see ya.

517
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,063
- Bye, Nora.

518
00:22:12,283 --> 00:22:14,134
(brooding music)

519
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:17,101
(group vocalizing)

520
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:37,898
(group vocalizing)

521
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:48,651
(group vocalizing)

522
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:56,715
(group vocalizing)

523
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,500
- Dude, why is it taking
him six years to graduate?

524
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,118
- 'Cause I did a year abroad.

525
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:03,820
- Shithead, south Jersey-

526
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,490
- Living in your grandmother's trailer-

527
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,290
- Is not abroad. (laughs)

528
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,870
- Fuck you.

529
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,410
- Hey, speaking of a broad.

530
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,520
- Ain't she though.

531
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,990
I think that Ms. Nora kind of adds

532
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,620
a little something special
to this learning shit.

533
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,640
- I think this takes college
education to a whole new level.

534
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,354
- Yeah, my old man, I had no
idea he was paying for this.

535
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:23,380
(group laughing)

536
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,300
- Hey, you think I could use porn

537
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,150
on my scholarship on Trojans?

538
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,433
- Yeah, and call 'em study aids.

539
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:29,630
(Danny laughing)

540
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,233
- Hey, uh, where's our
little, uh, pledge Jimmy?

541
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,680
- You're right.

542
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,563
Where is he?

543
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:39,870
I didn't even notice he was gone.

544
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,020
- He told me, "He was going
to that cave last night."

545
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,220
- What the fuck?

546
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,740
Did we get shown up by that kid?

547
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,250
- Justin, man, don't even worry about it.

548
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,030
He didn't come to class because it was,

549
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,920
it was over his head.

550
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,650
He didn't wanna show up and
embarrass himself today.

551
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,070
- Yeah, and besides she's
not gonna waste her time

552
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,620
with a freshman.

553
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,700
- Well, if we're smart,

554
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,250
we're not gonna waste any time either.

555
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,370
Let a fucking pledge beat us to the punch.

556
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,640
I'm signing up today.

557
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,500
Are you in bro?

558
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,750
- You know I'm there,
just don't tell Kathy.

559
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,770
- Oh, so now you're all
big fucking fans of poetry.

560
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,040
You don't even know the difference

561
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,103
between a simile and a metaphor.

562
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,230
- Don't try to trick me.

563
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,201
We don't study those
countries in this class.

564
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,200
(Donna and Jason laughing)

565
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,010
- I don't know what's
going on with you guys.

566
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,963
It's like you're not the same at all.

567
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,320
- I still think you're pretty, Donna.

568
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,890
- Thank you, Walter.

569
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,700
- But I still wanna join
the poet society though.

570
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,050
I think I'd learn a lot.

571
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,780
- Gee, Walter, maybe you can carry

572
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,580
the flashlight for Adam and Josh.

573
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,783
- Hey, Jonathan, wake up!

574
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,870
- Oh yeah, sounds, uh, real cool guys,

575
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,530
but, uh, it's really not for me.

576
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,530
Besides I got a good thing going

577
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,920
with Shelly and I don't wanna mess it up.

578
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,300
- [Evan] Suit yourself, man.

579
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,407
- You're gonna miss out
on some major action.

580
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:53,124
(ominous music)

581
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,863
- [Nora] Hey, Nikko, over here now!

582
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,730
- Hi, Nora.

583
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,130
How was class today?

584
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,690
- Doesn't change much, Nikko.

585
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,380
So little time, so much pent-up hatred

586
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,218
to spew forth on the world.

587
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:09,101
- Oh.

588
00:25:11,024 --> 00:25:14,650
- (sighs) There's more work
at this place than I thought.

589
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,180
This one at a time shit ain't gonna fly.

590
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,299
We need to start increasing
volume and I mean soon.

591
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:21,600
- Sure. Nora, whatever you say.

592
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,940
- Great, 'cause I got three
of 'em showing up to tonight,

593
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,192
and I'm gonna need your help.

594
00:25:25,242 --> 00:25:26,950
- Really, Nora, three?

595
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,800
- Yeah, and two of them

596
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,712
are the captains of the wrestling team.

597
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,570
- Oh boy, wrestlers.

598
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,534
Oh, can I think of
something special, Nora?

599
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:36,450
- (sighs) Sure, you can
think of something special.

600
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,360
- Oh great, I have lots of good ideas.

601
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,840
Um, first, we can have 'em-

602
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,030
- Nikko, zip it!

603
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,863
I'm in a rush.

604
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:42,800
You can tell me later.

605
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,160
- Okay, Nora.

606
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,780
Um, do you think I can have
one of my own this time?

607
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,800
- You know, I promised you.

608
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,760
You just need to be a little patient.

609
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,603
Be plenty for both of us.

610
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,300
Can you be patient a little more for me?

611
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,133
- Okay, Nora.

612
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,700
Whatever you say.

613
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,000
- Good, 'cause I gotta
go run to get ready.

614
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:03,960
We need to start thinking about

615
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,510
how we're gonna start increasing volume.

616
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,630
We need to plan and we need it soon.

617
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,490
- Okay, Nora.

618
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,016
Um, I'll start thinking
about it real hard.

619
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:11,899
- Great.

620
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,083
Nikko.

621
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:14,950
- Yeah, Nora.

622
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,900
- [Nora] Missed weed over there.

623
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,106
- Thanks, Nora.

624
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:18,989
Bye.

625
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,190
(ominous music)

626
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,840
- Oh, noble hearts bleed no more.

627
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,593
The warrior must find his sacred home.

628
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,300
The caves of King
Passamasoute must be cleansed

629
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,600
with the blood of those who become men.

630
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,250
- Wow, powerful.

631
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,663
- You think so?
- Yeah.

632
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,423
- Hey, Josh, you try.

633
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:52,130
- Men step, step forward
and remove your shield.

634
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,030
The, the, the way is
clear to sow the field.

635
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,433
Oh, (chuckles) sow the field.

636
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,670
With each man's seed to
plant the fruit in each with.

637
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,630
- Speed.
- Speed.

638
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,663
- I like how this sounds.

639
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,180
- Look not upon another, another's mate.

640
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:29,230
King Pass, Passamasoute
will seal his fate.

641
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,313
Oh, fate.

642
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,850
With bloody vengeance will come the day

643
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,900
that men who still act
boy will surely pay.

644
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,990
- Awesome.

645
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,170
- It's awfully bloody and violent.

646
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,330
- Actually the Passamasoute were known

647
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,120
for their strict code of male behavior.

648
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,310
Many of these translated poems

649
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,880
grew out of rituals performed
in caves just like these.

650
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,800
These rituals confronted and challenged

651
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,120
the young men of the tribe

652
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:03,250
to uphold tribal laws of honor, conduct,

653
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,970
and respect for women.

654
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,370
- Like on "Jerry Springer"?

655
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,000
- Let me read you an example.

656
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:13,889
(ominous music)

657
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:16,370
They had taken more wife than one

658
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,813
in spite tribal please.

659
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,010
Brought here before the sacred pyre

660
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,163
were tied the evil three.

661
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,320
Tied as one, they were told to fight

662
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,393
until but one could breathe.

663
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,960
The evil three fought
with ropes like warriors,

664
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,740
true to heart until the
cave ran red with blood.

665
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,600
- They had to kill each other?

666
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,230
- Death was their punishment

667
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,418
for lying, cheating, and screwing around.

668
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:49,640
- Man, I'd be fucked back in those days.

669
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,052
- Yeah.

670
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:52,250
- (sighs) Well, I think y'all are ready

671
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,260
to move on to a deeper level.

672
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,093
Take off your shirts.

673
00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:55,976
- What?

674
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,450
- It's part of the ancient process.

675
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,340
Will help us get in touch

676
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,853
with the natural energy of these caves.

677
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,490
- I gotta go.

678
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,890
I just remembered this test.

679
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,240
Um, the library.

680
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,690
I, I gotta go.

681
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,523
- You sure?

682
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:11,563
It's the best part.

683
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,100
Bye.

684
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,647
What's wrong with him?

685
00:29:15,697 --> 00:29:18,083
- (chuckles) You don't even wanna know.

686
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:21,133
(suspenseful music)

687
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,830
- Relax, oh, restful stallion,
your toil has made you weak.

688
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,973
The sweat, the tears, the furrowed brow.

689
00:29:57,657 --> 00:30:00,723
You know, you two are so advanced,

690
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:04,750
I'd really like to take
this to a deeper level.

691
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,943
Take off your pants.

692
00:30:42,313 --> 00:30:45,896
There now, my two
warriors, you just relax.

693
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,570
Here it is just like you wanted.

694
00:30:54,157 --> 00:30:56,824
(Josh groaning)

695
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,940
Nikko!

696
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,823
Nikko!

697
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,013
- [Nikko] Nora.

698
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,017
Remember, like I said before.

699
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:12,193
- Didn't you hear that poem I used?

700
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,210
You should grow up.

701
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,732
- [Nikko] We can do that
special thing now, Nora?

702
00:31:15,782 --> 00:31:16,615
- Yes.

703
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:46,123
(foot thuds)

704
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:47,160
- Holy shit.

705
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:47,993
- What happened?

706
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:49,596
- I call it the advanced level.

707
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:52,669
(Nikko giggling)

708
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:54,420
The rules are simple.

709
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,510
The ancient Passamasoute
were not complicated.

710
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,860
Fight to the death for my honor.

711
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,440
We know at least one of
you cheats on their woman.

712
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,540
Will have the winner as my own,

713
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,053
and I will reward him greatly.

714
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,820
Nikko and I will stand to watch.

715
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,420
- Who the fuck is Nikko?

716
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,833
- I'm the local tribal elder. (giggling)

717
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,610
- [Nora] Let the games begin.

718
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,566
- What games?
- Come on.

719
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:20,399
- You guys are-
- Come on.

720
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:21,390
- Fucking crazy.
- Come on fight.

721
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,929
- Come on.
- Come on fight.

722
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:24,420
- Fight, fight!

723
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,720
- Fight.
- Listen, these people

724
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,670
are fucking crazy.

725
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,610
Pretend to choke me out.

726
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,882
- [Josh] What?

727
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:31,930
- Pretend to choke me out.

728
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,763
I'll pretend to dead.

729
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:33,847
And then I'll grab Nikko with the knife.

730
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:34,680
- Yeah, but what if-

731
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,813
- Just do it.

732
00:32:39,473 --> 00:32:42,140
(Adam groaning)

733
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:46,846
(Adam groaning)

734
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:52,541
(fist thuds)

735
00:32:52,591 --> 00:32:55,008
(fist thuds)

736
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,824
(fist thuds)

737
00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:01,742
(fist thuds)

738
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:04,460
(fist thuds)

739
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,553
(fist thuds)

740
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:08,270
(Adam grunting)

741
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:12,287
(hand thuds)

742
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:13,120
(Josh groaning)

743
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,026
(hands slap)

744
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:18,826
(hands slapping)

745
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:23,290
(Josh groaning)

746
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,773
(Josh grunting)

747
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:29,633
(Adam groaning)

748
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:31,027
What are you doing?

749
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:32,680
Stop!

750
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,483
I can't breathe. (groaning)

751
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,228
Stop.

752
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:42,861
(Adam groaning)

753
00:33:42,911 --> 00:33:45,411
(Josh grunts)

754
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:49,298
(Adam groans)

755
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,253
- My warrior is victorious.

756
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,698
- Fucker!

757
00:33:55,748 --> 00:33:57,155
(Nora groaning)

758
00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:58,707
- Nikko, Nikko!

759
00:33:58,757 --> 00:34:02,172
(Nora grunting)

760
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:03,680
(Nora coughing)

761
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,138
(Josh groaning)

762
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:08,749
(Josh groaning)

763
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:11,050
(suspenseful music)

764
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,347
Jocks are so stupid!

765
00:34:14,564 --> 00:34:17,231
(Josh groaning)

766
00:34:21,388 --> 00:34:24,055
(Josh groaning)

767
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:41,297
(body thuds)

768
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:44,053
Come on, Nikko, let's go back to campus.

769
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,909
(Nikko giggling)

770
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:54,360
(Adam coughing)

771
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,243
- Josh.

772
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,120
Josh.

773
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,720
Josh, get the fuck off me, man.

774
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,193
Josh.

775
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,773
Josh.

776
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,297
Stupid ass.

777
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:22,865
What the fuck did you do?

778
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,423
Stupid shit.

779
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,520
Fuck, fuck!

780
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,010
Fuck!

781
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,604
That wasn't the plan.

782
00:35:30,654 --> 00:35:31,887
- Well, this is!

783
00:35:31,937 --> 00:35:33,940
(suspenseful music)

784
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,657
(Adam coughing)

785
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,356
Now that's what I call a sporting event.

786
00:35:46,406 --> 00:35:47,250
(Nikko laughs)

787
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,550
Come on, Nikko, let's go.

788
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,187
(ominous music)

789
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,502
(ominous music)

790
00:36:08,552 --> 00:36:09,900
Where are they now?

791
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,810
We hear the cry.

792
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,350
Our missing souls escape the sigh.

793
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,010
The pain of loss so hard to bear.

794
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,550
Ask not, but why?

795
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,750
But who, but when?

796
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,763
But where?

797
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,640
Well, that's enough for today class.

798
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,530
Remember that the exam is Monday,

799
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,180
and that I want you to be ready.

800
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,750
I know that many of you
have been working very hard,

801
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,050
much of it on your own time.

802
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,410
Many have taken advantage
of the poet society meetings

803
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,640
to go deeper into the work.

804
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,313
- Yeah, where are they now?

805
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,460
- Kathy said, "That Adam
never called her last night."

806
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,780
- [Nora] Simply attending the occasional

807
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,830
poet society meeting may not be enough.

808
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,560
- Or it may be too much.

809
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,580
- Walter, will you shut up?

810
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,540
- So I wanna make it clear.
- I'm trying to learn.

811
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,760
- That is important to me

812
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,370
that I give each and every one of you

813
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,943
the extra help and assistance you need.

814
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,090
I'll be happy to make myself available

815
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,843
for individual tutoring appointments.

816
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,200
That way those who need careful

817
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,802
one-on-one attention can get it.

818
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:19,100
- [Jason] (sighs) Just what I want.

819
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,463
Ugh, Donna's gonna kill me.

820
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,463
Fuck it, I'll live.

821
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,130
- [Kevin] Oh yeah, baby.

822
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,773
Right after practice.

823
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,430
- [Danny] Cool, I could be ready by eight.

824
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,263
She's gonna love my hair.

825
00:37:38,978 --> 00:37:40,853
- [Walter] I think I'm gonna throw up.

826
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:43,010
- I've always believed
in this kind of tutoring

827
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,803
can make a difference
and I've seen results.

828
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,990
I want you to know as my students

829
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,090
that you're gonna get what you deserve.

830
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,360
- I like the sound of that.
- Yeah.

831
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,820
- Those who are interested

832
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,470
come to the front of
the class and sign up.

833
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,063
Class dismissed.

834
00:38:02,494 --> 00:38:05,145
- [Danny] Where do I sigh?

835
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:07,450
- But what about the poet society?

836
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,717
They told me, "That's
where they were going."

837
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,130
- Look, little wannabe frat bro,

838
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,560
I appreciate your concern,
but you got it ass backwards.

839
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,393
Nora's looking for something
good from those guys.

840
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:18,690
It ain't what you think.

841
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,718
- What's up?
- What's going on?

842
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:20,551
- I was there.
- What are you talking about?

843
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:21,384
- It's Walter, man-

844
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:22,217
- I know she did it.
- Pretending he's

845
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,455
on the "X Files"

846
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:25,420
- She takes them to the
caves, seduces them,

847
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,113
and then kills them.

848
00:38:27,994 --> 00:38:30,423
No, no, I didn't see it.

849
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:37,789
I ran off when she started
getting, you know, was sexual.

850
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,850
(both laughing)

851
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,010
- Give it up, Agent Scully. (chuckles)

852
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,310
- Besides she's coming over
to the frat house tonight,

853
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,000
to hold individual appointments.

854
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,720
The guys are all signed up.

855
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,870
So that proves your theory's full of shit.

856
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,640
Oh, I see.

857
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,599
She's, she's planning
her, her big finale there.

858
00:38:56,649 --> 00:38:57,432
(both laughing)

859
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,980
Yeah, well, it's been a real
sweet moment, but we gotta go.

860
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,980
Stay real, little one.

861
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,813
- Later.
- Ah, man.

862
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:02,740
- Frickin' Walter, man.

863
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,623
- Fucking idiot.

864
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,250
- Hello?

865
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,563
Hello?

866
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,210
Those idiots hung up.

867
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,030
(phone bangs)

868
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,707
No one will fucking believe me.

869
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:18,751
- [Nikko] Hello.

870
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,413
- Hello.

871
00:39:21,463 --> 00:39:22,296
- What's up?

872
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,630
- You have no idea.

873
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,450
Do you know what it's like

874
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,790
to not have anybody listen to you?

875
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,000
To be ordered around?

876
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,440
To have to do all the dirty work?

877
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,273
Shit!

878
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:35,350
- No, I do know.

879
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,233
I do know.

880
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,563
My sister, she treats
me real bad sometimes,

881
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,433
but I guess it's because
she cares about me so much.

882
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,243
It really sucks, huh?

883
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,120
You look pretty upset.

884
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,530
Do you need my help?

885
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,413
- I don't.

886
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,940
It's that new poetry teacher, Nora Crane,

887
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,310
she's evil, I know it.

888
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,520
She's got this poet society thing.

889
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,110
She invites guys to the group
and then they disappear.

890
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,180
It, it's in this cave off campus.

891
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,363
I've been there.

892
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:16,573
I know, I didn't see it,
but I know it's the truth.

893
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,020
You don't believe me, do you?

894
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,173
- No, I do believe you.

895
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,593
- You do?

896
00:40:23,643 --> 00:40:24,940
- Yeah.

897
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,480
- How come?

898
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,363
- I just do.

899
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,440
- Will you help me get at the truth?

900
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,610
I just need some evidence.

901
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,890
I wanna go to the cave
tonight to check it out,

902
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,393
but I'm too scared to go alone.

903
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,290
- I'll go with you.

904
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,243
I know that cave.

905
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,893
I'll make sure it all works out.

906
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,110
- I can't believe it.

907
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,120
Why would you believe me?

908
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,053
- Well, I just have a feeling that's all.

909
00:40:55,637 --> 00:40:58,657
And, and you seem nice and smart.

910
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,213
I'll be there if you want me to.

911
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,449
- All right. I, I, I gotta go.

912
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:09,110
I, I guess I'll see you
there sometime after dark.

913
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,020
- Okay.

914
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,153
- [Walter] I gotta go.

915
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,923
- Oh, he's gonna make a nice friend.

916
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,700
- Donna, you know that poetry teacher

917
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,150
doesn't mean anything to me.

918
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,670
- It's not how you act in poetry class.

919
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,930
- Well, it's 'cause I'm
around all the brothers.

920
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,883
You have to.

921
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,023
- You don't have to.

922
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,023
- I know what you mean,
but it's a guy thing.

923
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,293
Anyways, you're my girlfriend.

924
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,997
- Okay, I'm sorry.

925
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:45,710
Are we gonna study tonight?

926
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,910
- Sure, we are.

927
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,793
- What time?

928
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,593
- I don't know, I'll call you.

929
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,900
- Okay, but you better
not forget like last time.

930
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,991
- I won't.

931
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,041
- All right.

932
00:42:03,798 --> 00:42:06,880
♪ Do-be-do-be-do ♪

933
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:10,650
♪ You look so beautiful ♪

934
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,700
♪ To me ♪

935
00:42:14,696 --> 00:42:17,860
- (laughs) You wish you
were first, asshole.

936
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,693
- Fuck you.

937
00:42:18,743 --> 00:42:20,190
Yeah, I, I wasn't about to run up to her

938
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,410
like a little puppy dog.

939
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,980
- Oh, you would have if you could have.

940
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,860
7:00 pm and I'm number one, baby.

941
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,880
- Yeah, well, it's good she
gets you out of the way first.

942
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,973
I deserve to be savored like a fine wine.

943
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,050
- Man, you guys make me
wanna puke sometimes.

944
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,810
- Hey, hey, I thought the
agreement was I get some privacy.

945
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,380
It's already 6:45.

946
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,680
- Relax, guido, I'm outta here

947
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,520
as soon as Danny girl
gets out of the shower!

948
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,860
- Hey, hold on a minute man, all right?

949
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,890
I got a date with Shelly.

950
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,874
I have the shower next.

951
00:42:46,924 --> 00:42:50,210
- Whoa, hey, my tutoring
session starts at eight,

952
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,043
I gotta be ready.

953
00:42:51,093 --> 00:42:52,090
- Shit, the amount of time

954
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,140
you spend in that fucking
bathroom getting ready,

955
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,220
you should have started two hours ago.

956
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,670
- When are you gonna
start writing for Leno?

957
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,850
You're so damn funny.

958
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,180
- As long as you can get out of the shower

959
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,107
by 7:30 it's fine, it's great.

960
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:05,520
- It all depends on Danny.

961
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,980
You know, it's his hair,
you know, it takes time.

962
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,813
Ouch.

963
00:43:08,863 --> 00:43:10,040
You know?
- Yeah, well it's time

964
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,590
for you girls to get outta here.

965
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,290
Nora's gonna be here any
minute and I wanna be alone.

966
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,120
- Okay.

967
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,410
- No problem.

968
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,630
I don't wanna be the one accused

969
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,140
of giving you performance anxiety.

970
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,360
- Oh, yeah, might as well see

971
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,670
if we can get Keanu outta the shower.

972
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,580
- Hey, hey, I'll be sure
not to tire her out for you.

973
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,300
- Yeah, I hope that Viagra PowerBar

974
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:30,153
does it's job. (chuckles)

975
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,080
- [Nikko] Look, Nora.

976
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,790
Shouldn't we go to the back?

977
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,980
- Don't be stupid, Nikko.

978
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,300
You wait here.

979
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,250
I'm gonna go in.

980
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,741
I'll come and get you in a minute.

981
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:43,574
(knuckles tapping)

982
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:44,457
- Okay, Nora.

983
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:50,714
(Nikko sighs)

984
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,380
- Damn, she's early.

985
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,630
- Good evening, Jason.

986
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,940
- Hi.

987
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,161
You look great.

988
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:07,994
- Thanks.

989
00:44:08,044 --> 00:44:09,280
Are we alone?

990
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,450
- Oh, yeah, just you and me.

991
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,790
- Excellent.

992
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,770
Let's sit down on the couch.

993
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,830
I wanna get started.

994
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,560
- Great, I think I need some
help with the, uh, love poems.

995
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,830
- Oh, love, what a perfect place to start.

996
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,530
- [Jason] Well, sounds good to me.

997
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,363
- How long is it?

998
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:25,700
- Well, uh, well, actually-

999
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,600
- The love poem, how long is it?

1000
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,053
- Oh, uh, it's about 15 lines.

1001
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,690
- Well, you need to relax first.

1002
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,713
Give me your hands.

1003
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:35,960
Hmm.

1004
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,050
You're so strong.

1005
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,210
You're such a man.

1006
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,893
- Yeah, well I use 'em a lot.

1007
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,390
- [Nora] I'm sure you do.

1008
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,710
Take off that shirt, it's distracting me.

1009
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,830
- Are we even gonna read a poem first?

1010
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,509
- No, suge, we're gonna make the poetry.

1011
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:57,400
(phone ringing)

1012
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,883
- Oh, uh, sorry.

1013
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,033
I, I gotta.

1014
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,823
Hello?

1015
00:45:02,873 --> 00:45:04,850
- Hi, Jake, what's up?

1016
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,770
- Me?

1017
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,603
Nothing.

1018
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:08,253
No, not, not, not a thing.

1019
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,300
- God, you sound weird.

1020
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:12,057
Are you feeling alright?

1021
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,243
- Uh, me?

1022
00:45:14,293 --> 00:45:15,360
Yeah, yeah, fine, fine.

1023
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,190
Uh, never felt better.

1024
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,813
- What about our date?

1025
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,954
Are we still gonna study together tonight?

1026
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:23,171
- Oh, tonight?

1027
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,113
You know.

1028
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,990
- Jason, what's wrong?

1029
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,090
- Well, Donna, I'm totally sorry,

1030
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,870
but I, I just totally forgot.

1031
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,020
I, I have this thing
with the brothers tonight

1032
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,170
for the new pledges.

1033
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,360
- But you told me tonight.

1034
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:42,313
- I, I know, it's just, I
can't let the brothers down.

1035
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,930
Donna, don't start.

1036
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,190
- I'm used to this.

1037
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,180
I mean, it's always something.

1038
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:54,833
It's always the brothers
or the poetry teacher.

1039
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,200
Or she's not there is she?

1040
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,033
- Who?

1041
00:45:59,083 --> 00:45:59,866
- [Donna] Nora Crane.

1042
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:01,225
You know who.

1043
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:02,058
- [Jason] Me?

1044
00:46:02,108 --> 00:46:03,600
Come on, you know me better than that.

1045
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:04,972
I love you, babe.

1046
00:46:05,022 --> 00:46:07,400
- Yeah, well I hope so.

1047
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:11,563
That poetry teacher's bad
news, Walter's been telling me.

1048
00:46:12,548 --> 00:46:14,000
You better keep her out of your hair

1049
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,710
if you know what's good for you.

1050
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,110
- I will.

1051
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,600
Look, uh, the action's about
to start here, I gotta run.

1052
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,130
- Well, call me when you're done.

1053
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,413
- Okay.

1054
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:25,870
(Donna giggles)

1055
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,273
- Remember what I told you?

1056
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,270
Poetry teacher evil.

1057
00:46:31,744 --> 00:46:33,240
Bad.

1058
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,900
No good.

1059
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,213
- Okay, all right.

1060
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,609
Got it.

1061
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:39,492
- Bye.

1062
00:46:41,054 --> 00:46:43,060
(phone clicks)

1063
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,980
- She's gonna kill me.

1064
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,182
- Not if I can help it.

1065
00:46:46,232 --> 00:46:48,982
(Jason groaning)

1066
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:52,625
- No!

1067
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:53,974
Stop!

1068
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:55,507
No!

1069
00:46:55,557 --> 00:46:58,307
(Jason groaning)

1070
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:03,586
(Jason groaning)

1071
00:47:09,845 --> 00:47:13,510
- Brad, help me, she's killing me.

1072
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,653
- I'm just gonna leave you two alone.

1073
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:20,458
What the hell? (groaning)

1074
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:21,291
What is this?

1075
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:22,973
A crazy man on crack?

1076
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,789
- Nikko, take care of that one will you?

1077
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:29,506
(Brad groaning)

1078
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,786
(Brad groaning)

1079
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,950
(Jason groaning)

1080
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:52,104
(body thuds)
(Jason groaning)

1081
00:47:56,746 --> 00:47:59,079
(arm thuds)

1082
00:48:03,822 --> 00:48:04,984
(arm thuds)

1083
00:48:05,034 --> 00:48:05,900
Nikko, what are you doing?

1084
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,200
Stop it!

1085
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,870
- [Nikko] Nora, Nora, I have
to tell you what happened.

1086
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,160
- I know what happened,
you crushed his throat,

1087
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,540
you felt bad, you wanted
to start talking to him.

1088
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:15,480
- No, no.

1089
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,230
This afternoon on campus that kid.

1090
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,063
- What kid?

1091
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:21,150
- The one I ran into at the cave.

1092
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,800
You said, "He's in your class."

1093
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,450
He seems smart and nice.

1094
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,707
- Walter!
- Yeah, and nice.

1095
00:48:25,757 --> 00:48:28,170
And well, he told me,
"He figured it all out."

1096
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,578
He knows everything that you're doing.

1097
00:48:29,628 --> 00:48:30,580
(hand slaps)

1098
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:31,860
Everything that we're doing.

1099
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,910
And well, he knows about the cave,

1100
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,080
and the guys, and everything.

1101
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,410
- Nikko, don't go panicking on me now.

1102
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,780
It's nothing.

1103
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,100
That kid's a little milquetoast prick.

1104
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,530
No one's gonna listen to his shit.

1105
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,060
- I don't know, he seems smart and nice.

1106
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,510
- Nikko, give it a rest.

1107
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,410
I know how this college
frat boy world works.

1108
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,080
The Walter kid is nobody.

1109
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,870
If you and I stay focused,
things will go smooth as usual.

1110
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,132
Don't go as spastic on me now.

1111
00:48:59,182 --> 00:49:00,281
- Oh, okay.

1112
00:49:00,331 --> 00:49:02,125
I'm sorry, Nora.

1113
00:49:02,175 --> 00:49:05,780
- (sighs) Nikko, do your
job and clean up in here.

1114
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,320
I've got three more appointments tonight.

1115
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,510
I need to stay on schedule,

1116
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,530
which means you need to stay on schedule.

1117
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,010
I've got a lot of work to do.

1118
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,327
Gotta get this room organized and,

1119
00:49:14,377 --> 00:49:15,720
(knuckles tapping)

1120
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,312
shit!

1121
00:49:17,362 --> 00:49:18,300
It's that jock.

1122
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,810
Nikko, clean up in here.

1123
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,264
I gonna go to the kitchen
and take care of him.

1124
00:49:22,314 --> 00:49:23,147
Hurry!

1125
00:49:34,229 --> 00:49:37,180
(gentle sultry music)

1126
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:39,560
- Whoa, hey, you're already here.

1127
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,880
I thought we were gonna.

1128
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:41,910
- I'm sorry, Kevin.

1129
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,310
I was a little early.

1130
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,160
The door was open.

1131
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,900
I guess I just made myself at home.

1132
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,060
- Oh, hey, that's, that's totally cool.

1133
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,780
I'm just sorry I wasn't here.

1134
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,860
- Oh, please don't worry.

1135
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:53,380
I keep myself busy while I was waiting.

1136
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:54,780
I'm glad you're here now though.

1137
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:55,930
- Well, thanks.

1138
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,813
Me too.

1139
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,220
Uh, you know before we study
and all that, you wanna eat?

1140
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:02,490
- I'd love to.

1141
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,960
- Oh, great, I was like totally starved

1142
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:04,793
on my way over here.

1143
00:50:04,843 --> 00:50:05,626
Want some pizza?

1144
00:50:05,676 --> 00:50:08,090
- Mm, yes, that'd be nice.

1145
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:08,923
- Oh, great.

1146
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:10,510
Um, you eat sausage?

1147
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,458
Um, I mean, uh, you want beef?

1148
00:50:13,508 --> 00:50:16,360
I'm sorry, I, I mean, what
would you like on your pizza?

1149
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:17,916
- Just you.

1150
00:50:17,966 --> 00:50:18,749
- What?

1151
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:21,260
- Um, um, um, it's up to you.

1152
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,730
Excuse me, I need to fresh it up.

1153
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,563
- Oh, yeah, cool.

1154
00:50:24,613 --> 00:50:25,473
Go right ahead.

1155
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:31,125
(liquid splashing)

1156
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,520
- Don't let me stop you.

1157
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,313
- Oh, yeah, right, sorry.

1158
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,173
- Noble spines of men
support their angered souls.

1159
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,753
The shoulders heave with
the cares of the old.

1160
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:04,070
Achilles's arms hold forth
the rage leading to fingers

1161
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,905
smooth by lover's touch.

1162
00:51:08,955 --> 00:51:09,872
- Oh, Nora.

1163
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,710
- Standing straight like Troy's sentinels

1164
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,963
harms the lover's ache.

1165
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:22,890
Lay down upon my sacred peer
and rest that needful heart.

1166
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,594
- I think we should,
you know, go out there.

1167
00:51:26,644 --> 00:51:27,427
Oh, god.

1168
00:51:27,477 --> 00:51:29,584
(plastic rattling)

1169
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:30,565
(Kevin grunts)

1170
00:51:30,615 --> 00:51:34,400
- Close thine eyes, oh, noble warrior.

1171
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,434
You have toiled the day.

1172
00:51:36,484 --> 00:51:37,267
- Oh, god.

1173
00:51:37,317 --> 00:51:39,531
- You think only of love.

1174
00:51:39,581 --> 00:51:43,374
You think of love, you dream of love.

1175
00:51:43,424 --> 00:51:44,733
And you shall have it.

1176
00:51:46,592 --> 00:51:47,375
(Kevin groaning)

1177
00:51:47,425 --> 00:51:50,327
Fight not, young boy with what you desire

1178
00:51:50,377 --> 00:51:52,207
more than all else.

1179
00:51:52,257 --> 00:51:55,007
(Kevin groaning)

1180
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,623
Look at him, what a fucker.

1181
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:18,663
Shit.

1182
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,563
Just have to make time.

1183
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,015
(ominous music)

1184
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:36,379
There's so much better when
they're quiet like this.

1185
00:52:36,429 --> 00:52:39,179
(Kevin coughing)

1186
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:45,060
- Oh, Nora, you're so fucking hot.

1187
00:52:46,014 --> 00:52:47,883
I didn't know what the
fuck you were doing.

1188
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,410
This is hot.

1189
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,320
Oh, god, you are so beautiful.

1190
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,203
Oh, Nora.

1191
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,290
I'm yours baby.

1192
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,983
Do what you will, I can take it.

1193
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,380
- I know you can.

1194
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,507
- What are you doing with that?

1195
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:06,350
(Kevin grunts)

1196
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,960
- The spartan knew who
was man and who was boy.

1197
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:14,633
The test of will proved the lie.

1198
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:20,213
The test is sharp, warm.

1199
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:22,579
Now.

1200
00:53:22,629 --> 00:53:24,750
(Frank groaning)

1201
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,830
- Oh, that's kinky.

1202
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,713
That's kinky.

1203
00:53:28,265 --> 00:53:30,790
(groaning) All right please.

1204
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,100
Okay, that's enough, please stop.

1205
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,430
Please stop, please.

1206
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,881
Well, this, this is too
much that I can take.

1207
00:53:38,931 --> 00:53:40,609
You're not like any of the Delta Gammas.

1208
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:42,687
- Fuck the Delta Gammas!

1209
00:53:42,737 --> 00:53:45,821
(Kevin groaning)

1210
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:47,021
- Okay, oh.

1211
00:53:47,071 --> 00:53:49,476
- Do the Delta Gammas know how to do this?

1212
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:50,593
- Oh, yeah.

1213
00:53:50,643 --> 00:53:52,100
Oh, god.

1214
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:55,600
Oh, oh, Nora, this is so fucking hot.

1215
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:00,650
- The staff of life so bold,
so strong remains the prize.

1216
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,500
We hold so long.

1217
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,769
- Oh, yeah.

1218
00:54:03,819 --> 00:54:04,920
Oh, god.

1219
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:08,357
Oh, shit, you cut me. (groaning)

1220
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:13,439
- The stalk was hanging dizzying height.

1221
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:16,239
(Kevin groaning)

1222
00:54:17,479 --> 00:54:20,049
To bring upon the many nights.

(Kevin coughing)

1226
00:54:59,126 --> 00:55:01,293
- I never did that before.

1227
00:55:10,022 --> 00:55:11,855
Never did that before.

1228
00:55:13,964 --> 00:55:16,112
That was really hot and everything,

1229
00:55:16,162 --> 00:55:19,162
but please don't choke me this time.

1230
00:55:21,578 --> 00:55:22,466
I don't want my girlfriend

1231
00:55:22,516 --> 00:55:25,930
to notice any marks
around my neck, you know?

1232
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,083
- Of course not.

1233
00:55:27,971 --> 00:55:30,270
I won't choke you anymore.

1234
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,153
- Thanks.

1235
00:55:32,084 --> 00:55:33,401
You're beautiful.

1236

1238
00:55:35,427 --> 00:55:36,809
- A foe.

- You bitch!

1241

1242
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:07,900
- Nora, I, I just, I-

1243
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:08,970
- You just what?

1244
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,970
You're just wasting
fucking time that's what!

1245
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,520
I'm in there working my ass off,

1246
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,170
and you're screwing around in here.

1247
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,190
- Nora, I'm sorry.

1248
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,200
I was just-

1249
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,050
- Nikko, forget the excuses!

1250
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,850
Stop wasting time!

1251
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,517

What the fuck did you kill her for?

1393
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:50,240
She was like innocent girl
who didn't hurt anyone.

1394
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:54,090
And then you, I can't even talk about it.

1395

- Um, Nora, can I take
a couple back friends?

1440
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,999

the fucking door open?

1444
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:27,800
- [Evan] Hey, yo, Brad,
Kevin, where are you guys?

1445
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:29,380
- They probably decided
to make it a threesome

1446
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:30,213
and took it to the cave.

1447
01:08:30,263 --> 01:08:31,046
- Man, don't be sick.

1448
01:08:31,096 --> 01:08:32,480
You're always talking about sex.

1449
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:33,870
- Hey, Jason, what the fuck man?

1450
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,420
- Come on, Jason, man, ha, ha, ha.

1451
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:36,990
What are you doing?

1452
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,440
Jason.

1453
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,273
- Man you're fucking lying, right?

1454
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:40,106
- Fuck, holy shit.

1455
01:08:40,156 --> 01:08:41,990
No, man, he's fucking jacked.

1456
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,120
- Oh, shit.

1457
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:44,347
- Dude.
- Dave O, Kevin, Brad!

1458
01:08:44,397 --> 01:08:46,816
- Shh, dude, whoever did this
might still be here, man.

1459
01:08:46,866 --> 01:08:47,663
Shut up.

1460
01:08:47,713 --> 01:08:50,500
- Oh, man, it's like Walter said, man.

1461
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:52,250
- No, no, no, she didn't do this, man.

1462
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,083
She couldn't have done this.

1463
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:55,164
- They're not fucking answering us.

1464
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:55,997
You, you don't think?

1465
01:08:56,047 --> 01:08:56,830
- No, I don't think.

1466
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,390
Now come on, stop being such
a fucking girl, all right?

1467
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,710
Look, dude, we gotta go
check the other rooms.

1468
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,520
The other guys might
still be here, all right?

1469
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:03,390
Come on.

1470
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,337
Go check 'em.

1471
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:07,870
Hey yo, Dave, you in there?

1472
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,200
- [Justin] Aw, Kevin man.

1473
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,450
- Holy shit.
- That's fucking Kevin!

1474
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,500
- Oh, fuck, man, Walter was right, man.

1475
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,777
- Oh, shit, man, she fucking
hunted them like animals.

1476
01:09:15,827 --> 01:09:17,703
- Dude, she got 'em all.

1477
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:19,763
- Oh, fuck.

1478
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:21,680
- We didn't listen, man.

1479
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:23,280
We fucking didn't listen, dude.

1480
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,857
- Walter, he's going to the cave tonight,

1481
01:09:26,907 --> 01:09:28,580
and that bitch will be there.

1482
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:30,000
- Fuck, you're right.

1483
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:30,980
- We gotta get the police.

1484
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:32,220
- No, no, no, no.

1485
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:33,950
We're gonna go there and
do it ourselves, man.

1486
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,144
Screw the police, okay?

1487
01:09:35,194 --> 01:09:35,977
- What you talking about?

1488
01:09:36,027 --> 01:09:37,360
- Dude, first we're
gonna save Walter's ass,

1489
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:38,550
then we're gonna toast hers.

1490
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,383
- Did you see how many fucking guys she-

1491
01:09:39,433 --> 01:09:41,340
- Dude, there's one of
her and two of us, man.

1492
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,190
What's your problem?

1493
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,230
- We're not fucking ninjas, man.

1494
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,390
- Dude, where's your
fucking loyalty, all right?

1495
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,880
Would you be there if I was there, huh?

1496
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:47,930
Would you come save me?
- Look at that fucking guy!

1497
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,880
- Would you come save me if it was me?

1498
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:50,713
Would you?

1499
01:09:50,763 --> 01:09:51,546
- Yeah.

1500
01:09:51,596 --> 01:09:53,490
- So come on, strap a set on and let's go.

1501
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:54,373
- Oh, shit.

1502
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,563
- Let's go.

1503
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:11,185
- I knew it.

1504
01:10:11,235 --> 01:10:12,870
I knew it.

1505
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,040
I gotta call my dad.

1506
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,490
The police will believe
me now, I have evidence.

1507
01:10:27,152 --> 01:10:29,819
(phone ringing)

1508
01:10:31,164 --> 01:10:33,630
(Stuart clears throat)

1509
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,853
- Hardwick Police.

1510
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,900
Stuart Merrick speaking.

1511
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:40,830
- Dad, there's been a bunch of murders.

1512
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,190
- Hey, is this Wally?

1513
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,910
- Don't call me Wally.

1514
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:45,972
It's Walter.

1515
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:51,022
- Listen, I'll call you
whatever I damn please.

1516
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:54,400
- Look, Dad, there's
been a bunch of murders.

1517
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,100
There's this psycho teacher on campus.

1518
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:56,933
- Yeah?

1519
01:10:56,983 --> 01:10:59,350
- It's that new poetry teacher
Nora Crane, she's evil.

1520
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,183
I know it.

1521
01:11:00,233 --> 01:11:01,340
She has this poet society thing.

1522
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,740
She takes these guys to the
cave and then they disappear.

1523
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:05,430
It's in this cave off campus.

1524
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,583
- Wait, wait.

1525
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:10,750
Did you see her do it?

1526
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,530
- No, I didn't see it, but
Dad, it doesn't matter.

1527
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:14,577
I'm here at the frat house right now,

1528
01:11:14,627 --> 01:11:16,915
and a bunch of the guys are dead.

1529
01:11:16,965 --> 01:11:20,570
- I thought you said it was
a cave or, or something.

1530
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:23,050
- It's in the cave and the frat house.

1531
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:28,100
- Wally, it's always the same with you.

1532
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:33,163
You're letting your
imagination run over time.

1533
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:42,621
I think what you should do

1534
01:11:42,671 --> 01:11:46,953
is spend some more time looking for girls.

1535
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:50,803
Perhaps get yourself a girlfriend,

1536
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:58,340
Incidentally that will
eliminate your makeup crimes.

1537
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,870
- The bodies are right here.

1538
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:00,753
- Bullshit!

1539
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,543
I'm your father, buddy.

1540
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:10,510
And I know I don't want
you to call your mother

1541
01:12:11,733 --> 01:12:14,053
and worry her about this.

1542
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,523
Especially when you're
under this condition.

1543
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:24,250
And besides I want you to get
your ass over here this week,

1544
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:30,130
and clean that yard because
it looks like bullshit.

1545
01:12:34,724 --> 01:12:37,208
(phone thuds)

1546
01:12:37,258 --> 01:12:41,841
(chuckles) Man, did I raised a weirdo.

1547
01:12:45,413 --> 01:12:47,295
(Stuart grunts)

1548
01:12:47,345 --> 01:12:49,595
Oh, man, I had it with him.

1549
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,383
(dial tone ringing)

1550
01:12:55,433 --> 01:12:57,373
- Dad, Dad?

1551
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:00,713
Shit, he hung up!

1552
01:13:03,155 --> 01:13:04,105
What am I gonna do?

1553
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:08,217
Donna, Donna, she'll help.

1554
01:13:11,573 --> 01:13:12,356
(phone ringing)

1555
01:13:12,406 --> 01:13:14,116
(water splashing)

1556
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:16,749
(sultry music)

1557
01:13:29,237 --> 01:13:30,190
(answer machine beeps)

1558
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,606
- [Donna] Hi, this is Donna.

1559
01:13:31,656 --> 01:13:33,459
Can't come to the phone right now.

1560
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:36,936
But if you leave your name and
number, I will call you back.

1561
01:13:36,986 --> 01:13:37,820
Love you.

1562
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:38,703
Bye.

1563
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:41,359
(answer machine beeps)

1564
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:42,842
- Donna.

1565
01:13:42,892 --> 01:13:44,903
Donna, are you there?

1566
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,083
Pick up, pick up.

1567
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:50,510
Goddammit.

1568
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,170
Donna, this is Walter.

1569
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:55,920
Look, everything we suspected is true.

1570
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,670
That Nora bitch is a psycho.

1571
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,197
We have to stop her.

1572
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:01,390
Look, I'm at the frat house right now,

1573
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,440
and things are much
worse than we expected.

1574
01:14:06,587 --> 01:14:08,340
And my dad totally blew me off.

1575
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:09,180
I need your help.

1576
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:10,890
Look as soon as you get a chance,

1577
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:13,810
don't come to the Lambda Chi house.

1578
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,550
Uh, I've gotta go back to
that cave or something.

1579
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,260
That gardener guy I met
said, he'll be there,

1580
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:21,220
but I guess I'll be all right.

1581
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:24,790
Look, if you get a chance, meet
me at the cave or something.

1582
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:29,160
Alright, thanks for listening, Donna.

1583
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:30,043
I gotta go.

1584
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:31,963
This is Walter.

1585
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:37,850
- Can't count as many times I've told you,

1586
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,420
but you never fucking listen.

1587
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:40,310
This is the result of you

1588
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,350
following your own selfish pleasures!

1589
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,110
We just got here, and we're
gonna have to move on!

1590
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,780
I hope you're happy!

1591
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:47,090
- You mean leave, Nora?

1592
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:48,680
- We've killed as many as we can.

1593
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:49,887
We've gotta go on!

1594
01:14:49,937 --> 01:14:51,680
- [Nikko] But we just got here.

1595
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:53,813
- [Nora] Sorry, see what
your fuckups lead to?

1596
01:14:54,688 --> 01:14:56,360
- [Nikko] But what about that Walter guy?

1597
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:58,160
He said, "He's gonna come and meet me."

1598
01:14:58,210 --> 01:14:58,993
- Yeah, right!

1599
01:14:59,043 --> 01:14:59,826
No one's here!

1600
01:14:59,876 --> 01:15:00,659
No one's gonna show!

1601
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:02,500
I want you to stay put.

1602
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:03,620
Listen, I'm gonna go to campus,

1603
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,080
collect what cash we do have.

1604
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:07,820
I don't want any more problems
from you, do you understand?

1605
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,520
Don't move from this cave!

1606
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:11,680
- But Nora, what if my
friend Walter comes-

1607
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:12,664
- Stop it!

1608
01:15:12,714 --> 01:15:14,700
You have no friends!

1609
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:15,823
They're all enemy.

1610
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:19,510
Listen, I don't have time for this.

1611
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,430
I want your ass right
here when I get back.

1612
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,180
Don't screw up!

1613
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:24,474
- I won't, Nora.

1614
01:15:24,524 --> 01:15:25,820
(suspenseful music)

1615
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:27,080
You came.

1616
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,430
I knew you'd come.

1617
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,329
- I was late.

1618
01:15:29,379 --> 01:15:31,380
I had to get a flashlight.

1619
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:32,970
- I knew you'd come.

1620
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,800
You're gonna make a great friend.

1621
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:37,472
- Yeah, well, I've seen enough.

1622
01:15:37,522 --> 01:15:39,180
I, I guess there's nothing here.

1623
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,850
I, I was all wrong.

1624
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,683
I should go.

1625
01:15:41,733 --> 01:15:43,610
- No, no, no, you can't go.

1626
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:46,380
I mean, um, you have to stay.

1627
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:47,213
You have to help stop this.

1628
01:15:47,263 --> 01:15:48,800
- I can't stop it.

1629
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:50,770
I mean stop what?

1630
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:51,603
- You figured it out.

1631
01:15:51,653 --> 01:15:53,320
My sister, the poetry teacher.

1632
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:58,370
She's like mad all the
time at all her students,

1633
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,023
all those guys thinking of, looking at,

1634
01:16:00,073 --> 01:16:01,590
looking at her that way.

1635
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,680
It's, they're so dirty,
and I have to help her.

1636
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:09,970
Please, I, I try to make friends,

1637
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,760
but they don't want to
talk to me like you.

1638
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:12,700
You're different, I think.

1639
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,790
Please stay.

1640
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,193
Here, let me show you.

1641
01:16:46,219 --> 01:16:47,886
- Let's go this way.

1642
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,843
- See, these are some of my old friends.

1643
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,120
They were real bad.

1644
01:16:57,170 --> 01:17:00,090
They were thinking about
dirty stuff all the time.

1645
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,823
They hurt my parents real bad.

1646
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,783
- [Walter] I gotta go.

1647
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:05,710
- No, no, no, you can't go.

1648
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,760
You're the first friend that talks to me.

1649
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:08,593
I want you to stay here,

1650
01:17:08,643 --> 01:17:10,503
help, help me figure out what to do.

1651
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:14,230
Please, it's been such a long
time since I had a friend,

1652
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,610
a talking one.

1653
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:19,810
Look my sister's gonna be
back soon, what do I say?

1654
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:20,780
What do I do?

1655
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:22,880
- [Justin] Hey Walter, hold on.

1656
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,130
- [Evan] Is Nora with you?

1657
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:25,870
I'm gonna make that bitch pay.

1658
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,500
- It's more those bad guys.

1659
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:29,350
Call my sister a dirty name.

1660
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,494
- This way, I'm over here!

1661
01:17:30,544 --> 01:17:32,357
(suspenseful music)

1662
01:17:32,407 --> 01:17:34,220
- You're just like them.

1663
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:35,720
You don't wanna be my friend.

1664
01:17:37,752 --> 01:17:39,813
My sister was right, you're all the same.

1665
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,337
All you think about is sex.

1666
01:17:42,387 --> 01:17:43,450
All you think about is getting some.

1667
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,318
I'm gonna give you some.

1668
01:17:45,368 --> 01:17:46,151
All of you.

1669
01:17:46,201 --> 01:17:48,050
What you did to my parents.

1670
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:50,537
How could I even think that
you wanna be my friend.

1671
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:51,850
I'm so stupid.

1672
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,140
No wonder Nora always yells at me.

1673
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:55,320
(Walter groaning)

1674
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,450
It's gonna be different this time.

1675
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,230
I'm gonna be in charge of these guys.

1676
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,680
I'll show 'em what I can do.

1677
01:18:04,396 --> 01:18:07,229
(Walter groaning)

1678
01:18:11,697 --> 01:18:15,114
I'm gonna show her exactly what I can do.

1679
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,700
- This is weird, man.

1680
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,083
I've never been here before.

1681
01:18:22,004 --> 01:18:22,787
- Did you hear that?

1682
01:18:22,837 --> 01:18:23,771
- What?

1683
01:18:23,821 --> 01:18:26,418
- Sounded like some panting or something.

1684
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:27,301
Careful.

1685
01:18:29,989 --> 01:18:32,597
Holy shit, man, it's that freshman.

1686
01:18:32,647 --> 01:18:35,520
- Oh, god, man, it's Adam,
and Josh, and Brad too.

1687
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:37,590
- [Evan] Oh, fuck, man,
look, it's Walter, man.

1688
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,473
We're too late.

1689
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:40,890
- Oh, fuck.
- Let's get outta here.

1690
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:44,852
- Oh, fuck.

1691
01:18:44,902 --> 01:18:46,452
(suspenseful music)
(Evan groaning)

1692
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:47,492
Fucking.

1693
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:48,542
Jesus, fuck!

1694
01:18:51,282 --> 01:18:53,490
(Justin and Evan groaning)

1695
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,450
- Yeah, just like the
rest, you're all gonna pay.

1696
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,573
Sister's gonna be real proud
when she seen what I done.

1697
01:19:00,464 --> 01:19:04,410
(Nikko grunts)
(Justin coughing)

1698
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,050
- Fuck. (groaning)

1699
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,000
Evan, man, can you help me out here?

1700
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:08,833
- Coming man, hang on!

1701
01:19:08,883 --> 01:19:11,465
(Justin groaning)

1702
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:15,377
(Nikko groaning)

1703
01:19:16,871 --> 01:19:19,920
(Evan grunting)

1704
01:19:19,970 --> 01:19:22,091
- Fucker, can you feel that, huh?

1705
01:19:22,141 --> 01:19:22,924
(Nikko groaning)

1706
01:19:22,974 --> 01:19:24,063
Evan, man, fucking help me here!

1707
01:19:24,113 --> 01:19:25,413
- [Evan] Hang on, hang on.

1708
01:19:26,401 --> 01:19:28,650
- Fucking guy's huge!

1709
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,164
(knife thudding)

1710
01:19:30,214 --> 01:19:31,297
Jesus Christ.

1711
01:19:32,365 --> 01:19:34,216
(head thuds)
(Justin groan)

1712
01:19:34,266 --> 01:19:36,820
(Evan groaning)

1713
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:37,839
(knife thuds)

1714
01:19:37,889 --> 01:19:38,740
(fist thuds)
(Evan groans)

1715
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:40,494
(body thuds)

1716
01:19:40,544 --> 01:19:43,153
(fist thuds)
(Nikko groans)

1717
01:19:43,203 --> 01:19:44,261
(Justin grunting)

1718
01:19:44,311 --> 01:19:46,644
- [Evan] Jesus, Justin, man.

1719
01:19:49,698 --> 01:19:53,058
(knife thudding)

1720
01:19:53,108 --> 01:19:55,417
Now you're gonna fucking die!

1721
01:19:55,467 --> 01:19:57,262
(Justin grunting)

1722
01:19:57,312 --> 01:19:58,887
- [Justin] Keep on doing it.

1723
01:19:58,937 --> 01:20:00,259
- [Evan] What's this guy made of?

1724
01:20:00,309 --> 01:20:03,468
(knife thuds)

1725
01:20:03,518 --> 01:20:05,964
(Evan grunting)
(knife thuds)

1726
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:06,847
Die!

1727
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:09,050
Hold on, man, hold on.

1728
01:20:09,913 --> 01:20:11,823
- [Justin] What the fuck is this thing?

1729
01:20:13,106 --> 01:20:14,843
(knife thuds)
(Nikko groaning)

1730
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,393
(knife thuds)

1731
01:20:19,076 --> 01:20:23,260
(knife thuds)
(Evan grunts)

1732
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:25,390
Evan, man, can you get off me?

1733
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,000
I'm getting fucking crushed down here.

1734
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:28,859
- I'm sorry, dude.

1735
01:20:28,909 --> 01:20:30,823
- Oh, god, fuck.

1736
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,326
(Justin groans)

1737
01:20:35,376 --> 01:20:36,459
Motherfucker.

1738
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,650
- Dude.
- Shit.

1739
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,403
- [Justin and Evan] We killed Fabio.

1740
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:45,673
- Man, you were fucking awesome, man.

1741
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,050
- Guy was a fucking yeti, man.

1742
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:50,350
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1743
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,183
- Yeah.

1744
01:20:51,233 --> 01:20:52,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1745
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:55,240
He said his sister was coming back, right?

1746
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:56,790
- Yeah.

1747
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,280
You're right.

1748
01:20:58,330 --> 01:20:59,713
Uh, let's, let's hide in the corner.

1749
01:20:59,763 --> 01:21:01,442
- No, no, no, better yet dude,

1750
01:21:01,492 --> 01:21:03,980
we'll, we'll act like a couple of corpses,

1751
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:06,720
and when she comes in on my
cue, we'll both attack her.

1752
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:07,553
Okay?
- You're right.

1753
01:21:07,603 --> 01:21:08,580
- Okay, come on.
- Okay.

1754
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,090
- [Evan] You lie down
on top of me, all right?

1755
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:11,480
- [Justin] Why do I have to be on top?

1756
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,580
- Dude, does it always
have to be sexual with you?

1757
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:14,603
- [Justin] Oh, shit.

1758
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:17,270
- [Evan] Just shut up, all right?

1759
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:26,600
- Nikko, you little fuck,
I told you not to move.

1760
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:30,790
Holy shit.

1761
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:31,753
Fucking Nikko!

1762
01:21:32,811 --> 01:21:33,644
Goddammit!

1763
01:21:34,586 --> 01:21:36,075
(Nora sighs)

1764
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:38,542
(Nora yells)

1765
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,373
Well, at least you accomplished
something while I was gone.

1766
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:56,659
(hand thuds)

1767
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:03,952
(suspenseful music)

1768
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,189
(knife thuds)
(Evan screaming)

1769
01:22:05,239 --> 01:22:06,206
- What the fuck man?

1770
01:22:06,256 --> 01:22:07,239
- Fucking little bitch!

1771
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,531
(knife thudding)
(Justin screaming)

1772
01:22:09,581 --> 01:22:11,601
(knife thudding)
(Justin screaming)

1773
01:22:11,651 --> 01:22:12,926
Goddammit!

1774
01:22:12,976 --> 01:22:14,230
- Stupid little fucks-
- Bitch!

1775
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,257
- You think I didn't notice you there?

1776
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:18,507
- Why did you fucking stab me, man?

1777
01:22:18,557 --> 01:22:19,686
- You killed my brother!

1778
01:22:19,736 --> 01:22:22,403
(Evan groaning)

1779
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,219
(Justin groaning)

1780
01:22:27,269 --> 01:22:28,223
Vengeance is eternal.

1781
01:22:28,273 --> 01:22:31,423
It builds the soul and molds the heart.

1782
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:36,207
Buy their time, 'til the
day when all is theirs.

1783
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,670
Teach the wrongdoers of their evil ways.

1784
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,740
Die slow evil ones.

1785
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,800
Pay for the pain that you have caused.

1786
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:46,820
Pay for the pain in all men's hearts.

1787
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:49,833
Pay for the pain that's
yours and yours alone.

1788
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,200
Those two were for you, Nikko.

1789
01:22:58,126 --> 01:23:00,333
- Walter, Walter.

1790
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:05,710
Oh, my god.

1791
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:08,468
Walter.

1792
01:23:08,518 --> 01:23:09,301
(ominous music)

1793
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:10,518
Oh, god, Adam.

1794
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:13,855
(Donna crying)

1795
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:14,738
No.

1796
01:23:16,144 --> 01:23:16,977
Jimmy.

1797
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:21,661
(Donna crying)

1798
01:23:22,499 --> 01:23:23,416
Oh, my god.

1799
01:23:24,418 --> 01:23:26,019
(Donna crying)

1800
01:23:26,069 --> 01:23:26,902
No.

1801
01:23:30,404 --> 01:23:33,598
(Donna crying)

1802
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:34,565
Oh, my god.

1803
01:23:40,906 --> 01:23:41,817
(suspenseful music)

1804
01:23:41,867 --> 01:23:44,617
(Donna gurgling)

1805
01:23:46,575 --> 01:23:49,325
(Donna coughing)

1806
01:23:51,085 --> 01:23:53,895
(Donna groaning)

1807
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:54,778
- Shit.

1808
01:23:55,808 --> 01:23:56,641
Donna.

1809
01:23:58,438 --> 01:24:00,855
(body thuds)

1810
01:24:06,322 --> 01:24:08,989
(ominous music)

1811
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:29,744
Fucking whore.

1812
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,863
Justice never flinches from the task.

1813
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:43,450
Although in battle we
may lose our comrades.

1814
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,623
Our friends, our brothers
fallen by the road.

1815
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:52,763
We must find comfort in
justice of what is right.

1816
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,950
The evildoers who darken the night

1817
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,360
have been removed from the fray.

1818
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:01,593
Their evil hearts beat no more.

1819
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:06,283
For this we gladly pay.

1820
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:17,880
Rot in hell you unholy cunt.

1821
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,263
- Piece of trash!

1822
01:25:20,313 --> 01:25:23,247
(Walter groaning)

1823
01:25:23,297 --> 01:25:26,281
I'll tell you what's a piece of trash!

1824
01:25:26,331 --> 01:25:28,123
Trash is all you fucking
little frat boys with hard-ons!

1825
01:25:29,816 --> 01:25:31,312
Killed my father!

1826
01:25:31,362 --> 01:25:32,267
My mother!

1827
01:25:32,317 --> 01:25:34,969
Now my poor pathetic brother Nikko!

1828
01:25:35,019 --> 01:25:35,907
- Help! (groaning)

1829
01:25:35,957 --> 01:25:37,843
- There's no help for you pervs!

1830
01:25:41,792 --> 01:25:44,542
(Walter choking)

1831
01:25:55,876 --> 01:25:58,543
(ominous music)

1832
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:02,744
(Nora sighs)
(group vocalizing)

1833
01:26:02,794 --> 01:26:06,860
(sighs) Calm wind blows across the plain.

1834
01:26:08,118 --> 01:26:10,951
What is wrong has been made right.

1835
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:15,334
But we are not done with our noble quest.

1836
01:26:16,423 --> 01:26:20,003
We must fight on to cleanse the rest.

1837
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:30,332
(group vocalizing)

1838
01:26:30,382 --> 01:26:33,215
(water splashing)

1839
01:26:45,983 --> 01:26:48,900
(group vocalizing)

1840
01:26:55,976 --> 01:26:58,893
(group vocalizing)

1841
01:27:05,049 --> 01:27:07,966
(group vocalizing)

1842
01:27:13,889 --> 01:27:17,330
(group vocalizing)

1843
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:18,210
Good morning.

1844
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,993
My name is Ms. Nora Crane.

1845
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:21,990
I will be your instructor here

1846
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,310
for the remainder of the semester.

1847
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,520
I'm glad to join the faculty here.

1848
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:29,173
And I look forward to our
time together this year.

1849
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:34,920
Poetry has been a chief
love of mine for many years.

1850
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:39,970
The words, the rhythm, the
energy can do amazing things.

1851
01:27:41,529 --> 01:27:45,417
I hope to bring the joy of
poetry into each of you.

1852
01:27:45,467 --> 01:27:47,361
I want us to develop a relationship

1853
01:27:47,411 --> 01:27:49,911
that is intimate and powerful.

1854
01:28:01,045 --> 01:28:04,045
(heavy metal music)
