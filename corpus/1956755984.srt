1
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:25,159
(upbeat marching music)

2
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,467
* Storm is headed to this town injustice, greed and pride

3
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,836
* The innocent will bear the brunt

4
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,505
* Can no one turn this tied

5
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:15,876
* Battle is of light and dark will good or evil reign

6
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,679
* The railroad or the widow

7
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:22,750
* Her loss will be their pain

8
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:28,756
* What will she do does no one seen tragedy, tragedy

9
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,891
* Who will turn this wrong to right

10
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,594
* God is watching day and night

11
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:38,599
* He will win this fight

12
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:43,571
* He's the widow's might

13
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:07,628
* A faithful little woman

14
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,264
* The widow prays for strength

15
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,466
* The sheriff wants the railroad

16
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,935
* He'll go to any lane

17
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,937
* She'll pray for our defender

18
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,907
* For the self and for her land

19
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,243
* Send dangers to protect her

20
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:27,381
* God show your mighty hand

21
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:32,286
* What will she do does no one see tragedy, tragedy

22
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,722
* Who will turn this wrong to right

23
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,258
* God is watching day and night

24
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,962
* He will win this fight

25
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,667
* Because he's the widows might

26
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,205
(upbeat marching music)

27
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,164
- Hi there.

28
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,300
- Gator, what are you doing here?

29
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,869
- Whoa. Uh.

30
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,003
Excuse me. Whoa.

31
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:28,242
(door crashing)

32
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:32,613
- Cut.

33
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:39,987
(slow ominous music)

34
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,368
- John, we're running out of time.

35
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,236
We need to shoot this last scene.

36
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,006
- Let's do it.

37
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,282
Hi.

38
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:09,483
My name is John Moore.

39
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,018
I live here in Ringer County.

40
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,587
And my friends and I produce the film you're watching now.

41
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,757
When we first started,

42
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,992
we didn't realize how big this would all become.

43
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:25,032
This thing began when Jim Morton decided to ...

44
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,602
... nah, just.

45
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,439
- Tell it from the beginning.

46
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,411
- It all began about two months ago,

47
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,447
in your average Tuesday afternoon.

48
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,684
Hi there.

49
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,052
John here, on your average Tuesday afternoon.

50
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,455
Cameron is behind the camera this time.

51
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,923
I'm here to introduce you to our families.

52
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,559
So, you've seen a lot of us in different videos

53
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,027
but you don't really know who is who.

54
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,063
This is my youngest brother Gator.

55
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,398
- Hi.

56
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,332
- You may be wondering why

57
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:00,067
a 10-year-old is wearing an eye patch.

58
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,970
But it's due to a little known thing called refracto,

59
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,872
reflecto--

60
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,774
- Refractive Amblyopia.

61
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,708
- Exactly.

62
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,678
Which basically means severe lazy eye.

63
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,446
- The patch is covering my good eye

64
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,383
and forces my lazy eye to get back to work.

65
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,550
This ain't no union head.

66
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:20,053
(water splashing)

67
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:25,025
- And that's Jack and David,

68
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,094
two of my other brothers.

69
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,797
They're very helpful sometimes.

70
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:32,933
Cut it.

71
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,637
* These are the only words

72
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,140
* Until I write the rhyme

73
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,811
* These words are for my song

74
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:48,849
* Just 60 seconds long

75
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,718
- That's beautiful.

76
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,119
- Thank you.

77
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:56,390
- Well, that story may have been a little off topic

78
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,458
but we had to know.

79
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,826
- Had to know what?

80
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,394
- If they could walk on water

81
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,463
by putting Jell-O in the swimming pool.

82
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,431
- Well I remember that.

83
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,599
The chlorine ruin the flavor though.

84
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,635
- This is my sweet sister Reagan.

85
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,137
She loves music, and especially singing,

86
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,139
much like Cameron's sister, Angela.

87
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,444
Cut.

88
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,145
Angela, I'm telling you.

89
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,813
- And I'm telling you too.

90
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,515
Wait, what do we tell her?

91
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,083
- Learn to love the camera.

92
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,184
It's your friend.

93
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,019
- Breakfast is about done everyone.

94
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,421
Wash up.

95
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,624
- So, what do you guys working on now?

96
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,660
- That's a short film for the blog.

97
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,195
The idea is to introduce our family to the fans.

98
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,630
- The fans?

99
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:38,899
- Well, whoever watches our films.

100
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,167
- Yeah.

101
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,470
This project really doesn't have a point.

102
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,171
- But people will watch it.

103
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,674
See, they think our short productions are good.

104
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,709
- Especially our latest one.

105
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,977
- Should we tell them?

106
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,778
- What?

107
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:54,648
(soft calm music)

108
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,850
- Dear Cinema Blog Productions,

109
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,119
concerning your submission to the first stage

110
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,655
of the American View Finer Film Festival,

111
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,190
we have reviewed your film

112
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,992
and are pleased to inform you

113
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,694
that your film is a semifinalist.

114
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,061
(family applauding)

115
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,498
And, and, and!

116
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,467
And it will be screened at the Royal Oak Star Cinema

117
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,002
in Dallas, Texas.

118
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,771
Finalists in the local level competition

119
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,473
will then produce a new film

120
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,575
for the state level competition.

121
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:22,643
Congratulations.

122
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,645
We look forward to seeing you at the festival.

123
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,213
- Well, congratulations.

124
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,815
- Hey, good job, guys.

125
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,049
- Hey, who knows,

126
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,951
this could be our big break.

127
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,220
- There's a lot of history in Ringer.

128
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,222
And with recent surges of industry combined

129
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,725
with how a construction and development,

130
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:41,495
it would likely continue its record setting pace of growth.

131
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,764
Who knows what the future may hold for the citizens

132
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,998
of Ringer County?

133
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,537
(crowd applauding)

134
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,971
- And now ladies and gentlemen,

135
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,574
the producer of the film, Vince Warner.

136
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:58,278
(crowd applauding)

137
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,048
And now for our last contestant,

138
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,016
Cinema Blog Productions.

139
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,087
- Here we go.

140
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,591
(upbeat music)

141
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:11,692
- Hello?

142
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,262
- How can I help you, young lady?

143
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,566
- Well, I have a mystery.

144
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,539
* We park in our driveways

145
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:28,241
* We drive in our parkways

146
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,943
* Whoever thought of that

147
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:33,881
* What were they thinking

148
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:38,185
* What we're they drinking

149
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,320
* Did you see the Braille sign

150
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,123
* driving through the drive-through

151
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,225
* Whoever thought of that

152
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:49,597
* What were they thinking

153
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,667
* What were they drinking

154
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,904
* Somehow it seems this world is confused

155
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,939
* By the names that they give

156
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,974
* And the turns that they use

157
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,812
* Through one lazy eye, it appears that they see

158
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,616
* A world of their own that is different indeed

159
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,620
* What will the answer be

160
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:16,890
* Who would solve the mystery

161
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,633
* Let's look at apartments

162
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,636
* They should be apart but built so closely

163
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,370
* Whoever thought of that

164
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,074
* What were they thinking

165
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:38,646
* What were they drinking

166
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,682
* And there's a ship where there's cargo in the car

167
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,217
* With the shipment

168
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,186
* Whoever thought of that

169
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,389
* What were they thinking

170
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,927
* What were they drinking

171
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:58,198
* Somehow it seems this world is confused by the names

172
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,635
* That they give and the terms that they use

173
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,103
* Through one lazy eye

174
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,272
* It appears that they see

175
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:09,142
* A world on their own that is different indeed

176
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:13,814
* What will the answer be

177
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:18,852
* Who will solve the mystery

178
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:24,191
(crowd cheering)

179
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,097
- Well?

180
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,704
- I'll take the case.

181
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:37,437
- Thank you.

182
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,872
I knew you would understand.

183
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,141
(crowd applauding)

184
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,910
- And now the creators of "Lazy Eye",

185
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,312
Mr. John Moore and Cameron Cavillo.

186
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:49,683
(crowd applause)

187
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,156
Gentlemen, that was fantastic.

188
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,457
- Thank you. - Thanks.

189
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,027
- So tell me, how long have you been on film?

190
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,162
- Well, it's been a hobby of ours for a few years now,

191
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,164
mostly short films for the internet.

192
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,966
You can do a lot with scotch tape and glue.

193
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,701
(crowd laughing)

194
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,236
- Well, you gentlemen are doing a great job.

195
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,437
- Thank you. - So, keep it up.

196
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,107
(crowd applauding)

197
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,713
- Good morning. How are you today?

198
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:20,948
- Hey Wally, how are you?

199
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,215
- Good. Very good.

200
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,752
Oh, it looks like it's time for a break.

201
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,820
So, I heard you did well last night.

202
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:27,955
- We sure did.

203
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,858
Wait, how did you know?

204
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,861
- Oh, you guys, you're just very talented.

205
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,764
And I saw you cheering through the window.

206
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,465
I promise, I don't read your mail.

207
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,033
I use logic.

208
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,168
- Hi, Wally.

209
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,836
Any news from the Mortons?

210
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,771
- I just talked to them.

211
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,938
They're just settling in.

212
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,173
Did you hear about Widow Jackson?

213
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,207
- Nerd.

214
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,175
- No?

215
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,042
It's terrible, I'll tell you.

216
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,243
Absolutely terrible.

217
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:51,912
That poor helpless woman.

218
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,181
She's gonna lose her home through ties for closure

219
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,449
because she can't pay her taxes.

220
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,451
- You don't mean Grace Jackson,

221
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,820
Robbie Jackson's wife?

222
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:00,821
- Yeah, Grace Jackson.

223
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,990
I deliver over there from Scott's Bessy.

224
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,792
- She's not really gonna lose her home now?

225
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:07,527
I mean, somebody is doing something about this, right?

226
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,362
- Well, not that I know about.

227
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,265
Well, I got to go, guys.

228
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,233
It was good talking to you.

229
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,267
See you.

230
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:16,970
- Poor Grace.

231
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:19,006
She's such a sweet lady.

232
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,941
- Hey Ange,

233
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,509
do you know how to get to her place?

234
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,478
- All the taxes here

235
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,347
are being getting worst and worst.

236
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,982
For a long time,

237
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:30,984
Robbie was a good provider.

238
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:33,353
And we had a good savings.

239
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,155
But it's running out fast.

240
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,825
Our boys would help

241
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,060
but they're both in the military.

242
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,162
They really can't do much.

243
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,496
- What about your church?

244
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,332
- Oh, they're wonderful people.

245
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,333
They help with a lot.

246
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:50,070
And I know I'd never be without a place to stay.

247
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,339
The problem is this new highway.

248
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,574
Overnight,

249
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,911
they say my land is worth a fortune.

250
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,013
And the taxes are based on that.

251
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:00,948
- This is ridiculous.

252
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,083
It's got to be some kind of mistake.

253
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,185
But I can't believe it's gone unnoticed this long.

254
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,254
- I've done everything I know.

255
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,122
I've called and wrote the mayor,

256
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,558
I even wrote a letter to the governor.

257
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,493
- I've heard of things like this before,

258
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,562
but right here in Ringer?

259
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,297
- The politicians don't care.

260
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,598
- No, I've met Mayor Warner.

261
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,599
He's a great guy.

262
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,567
He would do something if he knew about this.

263
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,802
- Yeah, why don't you talk to him, John?

264
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,505
Set a big, great lesson in reality.

265
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,041
- Hey guys, I'm busy right now.

266
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,409
Can we reschedule this?

267
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,577
- This will take just a minute.

268
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,947
- Okay. What's on your mind?

269
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,482
- Grace Jackson.

270
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,584
- Sorry, that name doesn't mean anything to me.

271
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,586
- Well, she has written you letters.

272
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,889
Her property taxes are outrageous,

273
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,457
and she can't afford to keep her home at these rates.

274
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,259
- Is that the widow down by the new highway?

275
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,460
- Yeah.

276
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,596
- Okay, I know who you're talking about.

277
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,231
That's really too bad.

278
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,866
Is she gonna sell that place?

279
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,600
- Well, no.

280
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,467
It's her home.

281
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,603
And besides, that's not the issue.

282
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,907
The recent appraisal has skyrocketed her taxes.

283
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,942
And her house isn't even worth that.

284
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,443
- But the property is.

285
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,612
In fact just for commercial development alone,

286
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,948
the property is worth a fortune.

287
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,950
And putting businesses along that highway

288
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,185
will be terrific for the city.

289
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,387
It's unfortunate that some people are against that,

290
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,023
but it helps keep the balance.

291
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,290
- Balance?

292
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,326
That doesn't sound like balance.

293
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,962
It sounds like good for you and bad for Mrs. Jackson.

294
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:22,629
- Gator.

295
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,964
- Yeah?

296
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:25,966
- I was gonna say be polite

297
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,534
but I agree with you.

298
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,202
- Well, why is he here anyway?

299
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,039
- Well, I needed a cute kid

300
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,907
to get pass your secretary.

301
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,508
- Look, if you guys wanna bring me

302
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,110
a feasible solution to this,

303
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:38,378
then I'll be willing to look at it.

304
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,980
But I'm really busy.

305
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,915
And next time,

306
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,483
be sure to set an appointment, please.

307
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,021
- Come on.

308
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,025
- You call that justice?

309
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,327
Power corrupts, pure and simple.

310
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,563
Who is buying you off, Mr. Warner?

311
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,333
- Things didn't go too well, huh?

312
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,334
- No.

313
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,036
The man is heartless.

314
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,038
He seems to think that losing your home

315
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,474
is the equivalent of getting kicked out of your apartment.

316
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,078
Well, let's get to work.

317
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,345
- What?

318
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,681
- The ink jet printer is mightier than the sword.

319
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,016
- Flyers.

320
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,019
Hundreds, even thousands of flyers.

321
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,020
By tomorrow afternoon,

322
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,222
half the city will be up and arms for our cause.

323
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,029
- Sir, would you like a flyer?

324
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,031
Ma'am, how about a quick read?

325
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,567
Ma'am, would you like a flyer?

326
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,971
Hey sir, would you like a flyer?

327
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,007
Pick one flyer.

328
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,748
- Hey, may I have a flyer?

329
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,050
- Sure.

330
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,184
Yeah. Yeah.

331
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,253
Take two, three. Here.

332
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,687
In fact, give one to all your friends and relatives.

333
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,556
- That's ok, I just need one.

334
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,992
- Okay. Well, thank you.

335
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,027
Be sure to visit the website.

336
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,594
- Yeah. Thanks, kid.

337
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,197
- See John,

338
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,099
there is hope for Mrs. Jackson.

339
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:10,003
Hey, that's 24 cents of ink and paper.

340
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,638
That could have gone to pay the taxes.

341
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:12,605
- Hey.

342
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,177
(soft music)

343
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,448
- John,

344
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,085
what exactly are property taxes?

345
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,419
- That's where the government charges you

346
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,188
for stuff you already own.

347
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,023
- That's kinda stupid.

348
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:30,623
- Yeah.

349
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,359
And the harder you work,

350
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,094
the more valuable they say your stuff is,

351
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,728
the more they charge you.

352
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,230
- Well, why can't dad

353
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,766
just pay for Mrs. Jackson's taxes?

354
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,334
- Even if we did pay the taxes,

355
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,436
it would only help things for a little while.

356
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,105
- Why?

357
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,074
- Because they charge you for the same stuff every year.

358
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,277
- Well, wait,

359
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,146
they've never charged me for any of my stuff.

360
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,047
- No.

361
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,382
Just the big stuff,

362
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,085
houses, cars, things like that.

363
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,454
That's why dad's been speaking out against it for so long.

364
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,524
Politicians think they're helping people,

365
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:08,328
but they're hurting the people they tax.

366
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,763
And some people end up losing their homes

367
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,300
like Mrs. Jackson.

368
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,206
- Are you guys gonna stay up there all night?

369
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:21,674
- Hey.

370
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,577
- So how did you guys do?

371
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,080
- We gave out less than 40 flyers.

372
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,251
- 30 of which went to a guy with a smoothie,

373
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,785
who turned them into paper airplanes

374
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,655
and flew them off the bank building on 8th and Main.

375
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:36,823
- 8th and Main?

376
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,691
How do you know that?

377
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,428
- The only legitimate person who took a flyer

378
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,629
was a policeman.

379
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,865
- Who, after taking a flyer,

380
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,867
walked down to 8th and Main

381
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,836
saw the paper airplanes,

382
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,505
turned around, walked straight back to us

383
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,806
and wrote us a ticket.

384
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,245
- Maybe we're going about this all wrong.

385
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:01,148
- The problem isn't the format, it's the material.

386
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,115
Here.

387
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,552
"Fellow citizens of Ringer,

388
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,520
"there is an issue of pressing consequence

389
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,222
"in our fair county,

390
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,424
"one which beckons our utmost attention."

391
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,860
We might as well have written a page from the dictionary.

392
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,163
"Boring, to make a whole

393
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,465
"or the act of making someone bored."

394
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:19,599
- All right, that's it.

395
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,003
- Get in.

396
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,239
- Go. Go.

397
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:26,873
Go.

398
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:30,243
(laughing)

399
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:36,383
(classical music)

400
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,285
(door bell ringing)

401
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,160
- Vince?

402
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,228
- Uncle Sam.

403
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,162
- Come in.

404
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,464
How can I help you?

405
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,466
- I just wanted to remind you

406
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,734
about the interview tomorrow.

407
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,169
- Yes.

408
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,539
- Anything in specific you'd like to talk about?

409
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,345
The Widow Jackson?

410
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,453
- These guys were just in my office the other day.

411
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,790
Let's focus on plans for city expansion.

412
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,292
- Sure.

413
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,196
- You know, it really doesn't matter anyway.

414
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,232
This election is in the bank.

415
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,399
- Hmm?

416
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,568
- Well, between my history and your press.

417
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,407
- Don't count your chickens before they hatch, uncle.

418
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:38,278
(classical music)

419
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,217
- What about a Noir detective story?

420
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,786
- Yeah.

421
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:47,954
It's pretty cliche, really.

422
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,289
It don't help Mrs. Jackson at all.

423
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,225
- Well, what would you suggest?

424
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,329
- I think we should just stick with something musical.

425
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,630
- Yeah. It's got to go way beyond

426
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,232
our previous films though.

427
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,968
- What about a remake of "Pirates of Penzance"?

428
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,271
It's musical, comedic,

429
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,539
and I can wear my eye patch as a pirate.

430
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:07,840
- I don't wanna do a comedy again.

431
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,376
It seems like a copout.

432
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,246
I've got it!

433
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,554
Aren't you supposed to yell "four" or something?

434
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,693
Gentlemen, we're dealing with a conflict here

435
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,861
that is inherently American

436
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,431
like apple pie or baseball.

437
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,434
In the world of cinema,

438
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:37,036
what is the American icon?

439
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,338
- Cute little kids.

440
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,005
- Puppies.

441
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,307
- Boston Tea Party.

442
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,274
- Cars.

443
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,241
- Apple pie.

444
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:45,945
- Baseball. - Baseball.

445
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,648
- Cowboys.

446
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:50,983
- So, what's the story?

447
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:51,984
- It's a musical western

448
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:54,321
which outlines Mrs. Jackson's situation

449
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,555
and shows these high level thieves

450
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,357
to be exactly what they are,

451
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,625
a high level thieves.

452
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,859
- Perfect.

453
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,428
- I'm happy because it's a musical,

454
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,296
you're happy because it's a western,

455
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,366
and we're all happy because it helps Mrs. Jackson.

456
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,634
- I'll write it up now.

457
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,569
- Mayor Warner is on it too.

458
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,803
And after reading this,

459
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,539
I think we might find it very interesting.

460
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,344
- "Sam Warner, uncontested in political race."

461
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:22,081
- Sam Warner is four-time mayor or Ringer City,

462
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,351
and wildly recognized as the single most influential man

463
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,885
in Ringer County.

464
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,888
And we're with him in his home today.

465
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,056
Good afternoon, Mayor.

466
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:30,957
- Good afternoon, Vince.

467
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,325
How are you?

468
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,093
- Well, big news about Mr. Trent today.

469
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,027
- Yes.

470
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,963
I was surprised he dropped down.

471
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:37,964
Mr. Trent is a fine man

472
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,800
and I expected him to do well in the race.

473
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,536
- Now, you're a very seasoned politician.

474
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,639
Do you feel that Mr. Trent dropped out of the race

475
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,676
because he was intimidated by your political experience?

476
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:52,845
- Well, I did think he had a good shot at it.

477
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,415
I mean, I don't have a monopoly on the mayorship.

478
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,817
- You have been the most popular mayor of Ringer to-date.

479
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,520
I would venture to say that any candidate wanting

480
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,888
to come up against you would have to have

481
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,357
an incredibly strong platform.

482
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,324
Speaking of which,

483
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,827
what is your campaign platform currently?

484
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,430
- Well, with the major developments on the southern side

485
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,732
of the county we're hoping to--

486
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,567
- I'm not voting for him.

487
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:17,069
- You're just not gonna vote this year?

488
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,070
- On the contrary,

489
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,473
I think we all need to vote for a candidate

490
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,476
that understand the principles that create a free society.

491
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:28,481
We got to find him first.

492
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,052
And I think I may know the perfect candidate.

493
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,492
- Well, let's make a movie.

494
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:43,530
(dramatic music)

495
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,753
- We'll be taping as you read through your lines.

496
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,556
It's a western, so there are several parts,

497
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:12,191
we got a cowboy, a balladeer,

498
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,092
a sheriff.

499
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,527
What would you be trying out for?

500
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:17,630
- I was thinking about the sheriff.

501
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:18,631
- Okay. Okay. Very good.

502
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:19,999
Well, go ahead and take a seat,

503
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,702
relax, give us your natural rendition to the piece.

504
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,704
I'll be your reader for the scene, okay?

505
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,839
- Action.

506
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:29,542
- You'll never get away with this.

507
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,543
- This is my town.

508
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,679
A railroad means this could be a boom town,

509
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:33,746
a spot on the map.

510
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,781
I'm not letting some old woman

511
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:35,948
take that chance away from me.

512
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,517
- Cut. Cut.

513
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,487
Thank you.

514
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:47,594
(bright comedic music)

515
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:50,530
Are there any other parts you wanna try out for?

516
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:51,598
- No.

517
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,434
- And action.

518
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:58,838
- You'd better back down.

519
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,207
I'm not gonna give in, Sheriff.

520
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,942
This isn't a matter of money,

521
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:05,512
it's a matter of freedom, pure and simple.

522
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,082
- This home is important to me.

523
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:13,085
It's all I've got (laughs).

524
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,789
It's all I've got (laughs).

525
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:25,097
- It's not an issue of fairness,

526
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,933
it is an issue, no.

527
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,701
It is an issue of fairness.

528
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:32,639
It is an issue of justice,

529
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,040
so don't you see?

530
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,075
- Great.

531
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,010
So, which one of you will be auditioning?

532
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,679
- Us? No, not us.

533
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,648
- Ryan wants to be in the movie.

534
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:42,949
Don't you, Ryan?

535
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,522
- Hello.

536
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:50,723
- Hi there.

537
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,893
- I was born a cowboy,

538
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,596
and I'm gonna defend our freedom to the death.

539
00:24:56,629 --> 00:25:00,933
(laughing)

540
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:04,170
- I wanna try the sheriff lines as well.

541
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,137
- Come on, son.

542
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,606
Say your lines.

543
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:07,473
- Do it, Seth.

544
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,140
Just like we practiced with daddy.

545
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,610
Say, "You're under arrest."

546
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:12,111
- Under arrest.

547
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,013
- Isn't he great?

548
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:18,284
- I have to admit, he's the best so far.

549
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,528
- I find my self discouraged.

550
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:32,832
- These are amazing.

551
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,640
- This home is so peaceful.

552
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:44,076
(calm music)

553
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,914
How long have you lived here?

554
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,916
- 42 years.

555
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:52,051
- You must have so many good memories.

556
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:52,885
- Yes.

557
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,354
Good and bad.

558
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,956
That mighty oak in the front,

559
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:00,159
it was just a puny little thing when we first moved here.

560
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,294
It was just struggling to survive.

561
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,063
- That's amazing.

562
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:07,133
- We were struggling to survive too.

563
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:11,137
That summer was almost unbearable.

564
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,906
There was no running water clear out here,

565
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,242
and Robbie had to go into town,

566
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:19,011
and bring back drinking water in a barrel.

567
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,215
Time sure were different then.

568
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,018
It was so hard to live here,

569
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:29,188
but he worked hard for this place.

570
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,389
He used to say,

571
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,359
"No place is God forsaking grace,

572
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,194
"not even Ringer."

573
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,899
We were so young then.

574
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,235
- What do you think, they'll it by the deadline?

575
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,704
- I don't know.

576
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,005
They're doing what they can.

577
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,841
What about you?

578
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,243
- Well, I've been thinking about it.

579
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,946
Warner certainly doesn't care about Mrs. Jackson's situation

580
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,082
and there aren't any other candidates, but--

581
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,218
- You think you're not the guy?

582
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,020
- No. I mean, I'm a contractor.

583
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,121
I'm a businessman,

584
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,756
I'm not a politician.

585
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,925
- You've got the head for it.

586
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,193
You've got the heart for it.

587
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:09,962
- What about you?

588
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,097
- No.

589
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,832
No, I can't control my tongue.

590
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,734
I'm not the diplomatic type.

591
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,002
But you,

592
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,938
you could give Warner a run for his money.

593
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,409
- Name?

594
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,245
- Vince Warner.

595
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,681
- Hey, how are you?

596
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:29,682
- I'm well. Thank you.

597
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:30,649
- Great.

598
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:31,617
So, what part are you trying out for?

599
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,686
- Oh actually, I'm not here to audition.

600
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,954
I just was in the area.

601
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,355
I thought I'd check it out.

602
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,790
So, how's your film coming?

603
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:38,357
- Good.

604
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,491
Script is finished,

605
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,761
and Angela is working on lyrics for the songs now.

606
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,462
- Singing cowboys?

607
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,798
That should bring them in.

608
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:46,966
So you've got the actors you need?

609
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,368
- No.

610
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,803
Actually, we haven't received the kind of interest

611
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,204
we thought we would.

612
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,773
- That's unfortunate.

613
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,809
When you guys start filming you should call me.

614
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,010
I'll do a story on your production.

615
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,111
Free publicity.

616
00:27:59,145 --> 00:27:59,879
- Hey, awesome.

617
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:00,813
Thanks.

618
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,414
- Anything that helps Mrs. Jackson.

619
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,850
- Absolutely.

620
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:04,984
Just give me a call.

621
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:05,918
- Thank you.

622
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,058
Now what?

623
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,359
We still don't have any actors.

624
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,163
- Not for all the major roles.

625
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,165
We can rearrange the script a little bit.

626
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,000
You and I can be elites.

627
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,201
- And the widow?

628
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,169
- Angela can do it.

629
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,238
- I don't know.

630
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,207
Should we reconsider this whole project?

631
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,809
- What's to reconsider?

632
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,277
- It's a western musical

633
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,444
for which we don't even have

634
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,246
the major songs all recorded yet.

635
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,214
It's almost half an hour long

636
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,515
and we've got less than three weeks

637
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,751
to turn out an award winning video.

638
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:40,119
And this is our fourth project?

639
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:42,789
- We'll do it.

640
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,390
I can feel it.

641
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,758
- That's reassuring.

642
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,995
(bright dramatic music)

643
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,892
- Sandy, can I see you, please?

644
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,869
- He's entering too late to be effective.

645
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:39,238
He's not gonna be a threat to you in any way.

646
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,272
- I know.

647
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:44,911
So, why is even entering at all?

648
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:45,912
- I don't know.

649
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,949
- I need you to keep tabs on this guy.

650
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,283
And keep me up-to-date on the campaign

651
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:52,985
if you would, please?

652
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,387
- Yes, sir.

653
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,928
- Hey, Vince?

654
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,265
- Hey, John.

655
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:09,668
The cinematographer can't make it.

656
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,971
We've got to find someone to run this camera.

657
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,205
You and I are both acting,

658
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,506
and there's no one else here really qualified

659
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,474
to run it.

660
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:16,675
- You mean we've got nobody?

661
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,977
- Gator knows more about the camera

662
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,078
than anybody else here.

663
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:24,917
No. You're not serious?

664
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,485
- I can do it.

665
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,419
- He's light,

666
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,922
he'll be perfect for the crane work,

667
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31,690
and we don't have anybody else.

668
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,326
- And I read that many one-eyed individuals

669
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,562
make excellent photographers.

670
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:40,132
It makes them look at things more creatively.

671
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,168
- There you go.

672
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,404
Well, climb aboard.

673
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,106
All right, everybody in their places.

674
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:49,108
Let's do this thing.

675
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,209
- All right.

676
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:54,113
(soft music)

677
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:13,132
(crane whirring)

678
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:16,702
(dramatic music)

679
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,137
- Action.

680
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,375
* Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy

681
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,011
* Plow the ground and sow the seeds

682
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,678
* Milk the cows and pluck the weeds

683
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:30,082
* Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy

684
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:35,121
* Apathy, apathy

685
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:38,057
* Many pressing situations

686
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,026
* Don't have time for confrontations

687
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,628
* Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy

688
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:47,666
* Tragedy, tragedy

689
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,602
* Chop the wood and shoe the horses

690
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,438
* Feed the kids and sweep the porches

691
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,341
* Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy

692
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:58,277
* Hear me now

693
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,412
* Hear me now

694
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,349
* The Widow's fight insanity

695
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,051
* We feel her pain, we see her need

696
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,485
* We wish we could but there's no time

697
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,354
* To take a stand by her side

698
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:11,157
* Surely someone will do something

699
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,059
* Was there something

700
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:17,729
* Can there something might do something

701
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:22,701
(dramatic music)

702
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,425
- Cut.

703
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,693
Great job, everyone.

704
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:51,130
(crowd applause)

705
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:53,165
- Everyone. Everyone.

706
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,835
We have to reset and shoot this all over again.

707
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,537
- No.

708
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,372
- We got to do it a few times to get the angles we need.

709
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:04,310
- Hey John.

710
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:06,812
I got to run to get things set up for the rally tomorrow.

711
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:08,180
- I'm going with him.

712
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:09,515
We're expecting a strong turnout.

713
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,449
- All right.

714
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,251
Well, we'll see you guys later then.

715
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:13,152
- Don't get in trouble.

716
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:14,353
- No, sir.

717
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,459
All right. Come on down from there.

718
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,194
We're gonna move that to the other end of the street.

719
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,795
- Can't I just ride up here?

720
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,231
- Sure, why not.

721
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:29,401
- John.

722
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:30,202
- Yeah?

723
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,173
- That was awesome.

724
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,174
- I know.

725
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:36,175
If we keep this up,

726
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,543
we'll have no trouble meeting the deadline.

727
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,846
- Oh, check this out.

728
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:43,415
- What is it?

729
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,883
- It's a blank cartridge.

730
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,852
Jackie and David have been making a bunch of them for us.

731
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,220
- How?

732
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,621
- Using fireworks.

733
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:50,756
I've been taking them apart and using the patterns

734
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,424
to make my rounds.

735
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,492
- That's genius.

736
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,128
All right.

737
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:58,764
- Okay guys,

738
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,499
right about here.

739
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,100
Yeah, this is perfect.

740
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,276
- Hey, John.

741
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:16,148
Look who's here.

742
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,196
- Hey, look.

743
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:38,204
- Hey, wait for me.

744
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:41,273
(soft music)

745
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:48,614
Hello.

746
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:51,950
- Hey, how you doing?

747
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,585
- I'm well. Thank you.

748
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,187
- It's good to see you.

749
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:56,154
- You too.

750
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,290
Figure today was as good today as any?

751
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,192
- Can somebody help me?

752
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:02,160
This thing is not working.

753
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:15,207
(soft music)

754
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,350
- Whoa. Whoah.

755
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:27,619
(machine whirring)

756
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:28,754
(dramatic music)

757
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,222
Help!

758
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,226
- Things have been going pretty well.

759
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,627
Well, tell you what, shoot whatever you like,

760
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,996
and we'll do our best to stay out of your way.

761
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,465
- I can't get up here.

762
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,473
I need some help.

763
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,743
Uh-oh.

764
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:58,417
(explosions going off)

765
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:04,990
- All right, get the fire.

766
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,392
Get the fire.

767
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:14,733
What happened here?

768
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,468
- Well, I was up on the crane,

769
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,304
and the whole thing was malfunctioning.

770
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:21,340
So, I tried to fix the wire,

771
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:22,474
and there was no one here to help me,

772
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:25,243
and it caught fire in Jack and David's fireworks.

773
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,580
- Okay look, we don't have time for this.

774
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:31,583
This film is too important to Mr. Morton's campaign,

775
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,285
to Mrs. Jackson's home.

776
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,922
And the fact is, somebody could have been hurt here.

777
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,024
Okay, we need to wake up and pay attention.

778
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:45,564
Well, let's say a prayer

779
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,399
and thank God that nobody was hurt.

780
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:52,037
Dear Lord, we thank you for your providence,

781
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,607
that we will be able to use this film to help Grace Jackson.

782
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:57,409
We thank you that we are protected from any harm today.

783
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,911
And we ask that you would put your hand

784
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,080
of blessing on this work.

785
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,316
In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

786
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,851
- Amen.

787
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,488
- All right, let's get back to work.

788
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,758
Well, we really wanted to do something with this film

789
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,495
that was a lot more meaningful than our previous films.

790
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,032
We have something put together with a lot of punch in it.

791
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,101
- And you're all homeschooled?

792
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,936
- Yes actually.

793
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:27,839
All of us involved in the production

794
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,442
are either homeschooling our children

795
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:32,744
or are homeschoolers ourselves.

796
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:34,045
- So, you have radical political views

797
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,614
and you're homeschooled,

798
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,916
does this cause you problems socially?

799
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:42,554
- Well, I wouldn't say that our views are radical.

800
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:45,657
I mean, we have different views in some people

801
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:49,461
because we were raised differently than some kids I guess.

802
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:54,500
But even if we had radical views

803
00:38:55,467 --> 00:39:00,038
about property taxes, that's not the issue.

804
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,474
- For me, it's really about helping Mrs. Jackson.

805
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,910
No one else would do it, so that leaves to us.

806
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,112
- How do you know Jim Morton?

807
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,147
- We know him through the Moores actually.

808
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,516
He just moved down here

809
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,518
and started attending church with us.

810
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:15,053
Jeff Moore feels that Mr. Morton is a wise man

811
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:18,490
and encouraged him to run for office as public servant.

812
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:20,492
- Against Sam Warner?

813
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:22,994
- Sam Warner has done fine job of building a city

814
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,896
and encouraging city development,

815
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,766
but he really puts this tremendous strain

816
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,768
on property owners.

817
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,703
We're just speaking out against what we believe

818
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:33,505
is an unjust taxation.

819
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,608
Is this really pertinent to our topic?

820
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:38,510
I thought this was about the film?

821
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:40,479
- Yes. Yes.

822
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:41,947
Forgive me.

823
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,416
So little guy,

824
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,084
what is this film all about?

825
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,788
- Well, I've been studying the American Revolution

826
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,790
and it's kinda like that.

827
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:55,494
We need to protect ourselves from an oppressive government.

828
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:57,663
The goal is to start a revolution.

829
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,531
It'll start with the mayor

830
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,567
and end in a complete political takeover.

831
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,135
Really.

832
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:05,804
We have Jim Morton on our side.

833
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,005
He's gonna win, you know.

834
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,476
- Well, good luck.

835
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,448
- I think it's great that Mr. Morton is willing to do this.

836
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:18,149
- Somebody has to.

837
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:19,918
Jim will do a good job.

838
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:24,656
Are you ready?

839
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:26,625
- Let's do it.

840
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:27,559
- Okay.

841
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,831
- My lady.

842
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,067
Thank you, sir.

843
00:40:39,505 --> 00:40:40,572
- Come.

844
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,114
(calm music)

845
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,927
- Well, everything we're doing I guess involves

846
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,529
getting knocked down a few times,

847
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,497
you just got to get back up.

848
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:06,698
- Yeah, that's right.

849
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:08,534
We're just starting.

850
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:11,102
We haven't even had time to get the word out yet.

851
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,171
- Well, Vince's report is airing today,

852
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,974
he did promise to tell your campaign to the film project,

853
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,543
so, that should get you some publicity.

854
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:21,847
- We'll keep you informed on further developments.

855
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,283
And now, a special report from Vince Warner.

856
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,718
- Film has been used for variety

857
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:28,253
of different things in history,

858
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:31,222
making political outcries is certainly one of them.

859
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:32,290
Now in Ringer,

860
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,560
a group of local film makers have come together

861
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:36,628
to produce a film of their own.

862
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:39,197
On the surface, it appears to be a harmless western film

863
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,600
full of fun and adventure for everyone.

864
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:44,169
The producers of the film say that their real goals

865
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,904
are much different.

866
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,573
- Well, we really wanted to do something

867
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:50,008
with this film that was a lot more meaningful

868
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,109
than our previous films.

869
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:53,078
- We're just speaking out against what we believe

870
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,913
is an unjust taxation.

871
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,281
- Further question revealed,

872
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:57,883
the Cinema Blog Production

873
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,285
is closely tied to Jim Morton

874
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,320
who is somewhat considered politically extremist

875
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,656
for his anti-taxation stance,

876
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,593
and who is now currently running for mayor of Ringer City.

877
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:09,861
How do you know Jim Morton?

878
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,730
- We know him through the Moores actually.

879
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:12,898
He just moved down here

880
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:14,633
and started attending church with us.

881
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,636
A lot of us here on set go to the same church.

882
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:19,204
- Another cult?

883
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:20,405
You decide.

884
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:23,909
Not only does this group attend religious services together,

885
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:26,244
but they've also made the collective decision

886
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,947
to remove their children from the public schools.

887
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,316
The project is being headed up by John Moore,

888
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,752
whose father is the leader in the religious group.

889
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,622
- I wouldn't say that our views are radical,

890
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:38,824
I mean, we have different views

891
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:41,326
than some people because we were raised differently

892
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,228
than some kids.

893
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,063
- But John's younger brother, Gator,

894
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,666
shares his view of the team's motivations.

895
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,101
- The goal is to start a revolution.

896
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:51,937
It will start with the mayor and end

897
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,372
in a complete political takeover.

898
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,875
Really, we have Jim Morton on our side.

899
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,710
- Their film, the "Widow's Might"

900
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:00,646
will be a part of the state level competition

901
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,380
of the American View Finder.

902
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,382
When contacted about the project,

903
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,719
officials at the American View Finder declined to count--

904
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:09,721
- Vince, that was low even for you.

905
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:12,724
- What do you mean?

906
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:13,959
I presented the facts.

907
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:15,794
- Facts devoid of contact.

908
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:17,162
- You don't know that.

909
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,797
They might really be cultists.

910
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,066
- I know these people and they're decent.

911
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,301
And I know you and you haven't changed.

912
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,074
I didn't ask you to do this.

913
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,377
All I wanted was to know Jim Morton's motivation

914
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,312
for running for mayor, that's all.

915
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,916
- I didn't do this for you, uncle.

916
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,284
I did this for me.

917
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,218
Just remember,

918
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:42,420
Jim Morton may be your competition,

919
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,322
but those producers are mine.

920
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:48,226
(ominous music)

921
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:53,665
- No, I understand.

922
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:55,867
Thanks anyway.

923
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:00,371
- Now where's our extras?

924
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:01,773
- They can't make it.

925
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,242
It looks like they saw Vince's report,

926
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:05,744
they don't want to be connected to the project.

927
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,680
- Well,

928
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:10,148
the movie has the festival screens,

929
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,817
let's see what it's all about.

930
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:12,718
- Yeah, but if we don't get some people out here,

931
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,052
it won't matter.

932
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:15,687
We'll miss the deadline.

933
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:17,889
We need to consider doing a smaller project.

934
00:44:17,923 --> 00:44:19,390
- We'll just reschedule.

935
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:21,793
We'll have some folks from church come up.

936
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:23,461
- Time is ticking away.

937
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,697
Angela hasn't even finished her main song yet.

938
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:26,865
- She's working on it.

939
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,352
- This is my town, boy.

940
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:50,155
The railroad means this could be a boom town,

941
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,057
spot on the map.

942
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,725
I'm not gonna let an old widow woman take

943
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:55,761
that chance away from me.

944
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:59,230
(upbeat dramatic music)

945
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,912
* We built this town on storyland

946
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:17,749
* What a high price if we demand

947
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:21,019
* Take and take, and you never give

948
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:24,790
* To sort of build this place you live

949
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:28,526
* You play with fire to heed this day

950
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,163
* Your wicked plans will not prevail

951
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:36,167
* Injustice like this you all should fear

952
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:41,206
* For the widow's cry, Jehovah will hear

953
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:48,914
* The widow's cry, Jehovah will hear

954
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:00,025
(soft music)

955
00:46:17,075 --> 00:46:18,944
- Nice, isn't it?

956
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:20,979
- Yes, it's wonderful.

957
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,348
I know now why you could never leave.

958
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,883
- It's beautiful.

959
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:28,286
It wasn't this way when we started.

960
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:32,924
There was very few trees on the property,

961
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:36,061
just a few short bushy things.

962
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:38,329
But Robbie wanted to plan a home for us.

963
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:44,169
I still laugh at some of his wild ideas.

964
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:47,939
But he built this place day by day

965
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:49,975
into a real shelter for us.

966
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:53,912
- What a wonderful man.

967
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,546
- Yes, he was.

968
00:47:00,886 --> 00:47:02,587
- How old were you when you got married?

969
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:08,927
- Robbie was 23 and I was 19.

970
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:13,531
I had so much to learn about life,

971
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,867
but Robbie was a good teacher.

972
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:18,870
He promised me he would make this a good life.

973
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:22,173
I hated it.

974
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:23,608
I was afraid.

975
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:25,276
I was lonely.

976
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,912
I wanted my own life.

977
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:30,048
But he kept his promise.

978
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:33,051
It was a good life.

979
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,990
And I promised him one thing.

980
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,393
- What's that?

981
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:48,066
- I promised him I wouldn't leave.

982
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:54,973
I swore I'd take my last breath on this land.

983
00:47:55,006 --> 00:48:00,011
(soft music)

984
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:22,500
- How'd the filming go today?

985
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:25,436
- Yeah. We didn't get nearly enough footage.

986
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,939
Most of the extras didn't even show up.

987
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:30,108
- Because of the news cast?

988
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:32,410
- Vince's report scared them off.

989
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:35,113
I just still can't believe he'd do that to us.

990
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:38,950
- He's your competitor, Sam Warner's nephew.

991
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:40,051
It's obvious he wasn't raised

992
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:41,419
with the same principles as you were.

993
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:46,091
- I still expected him to have some integrity.

994
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:49,127
- It shows you the power of the media, though.

995
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:52,730
It doesn't necessarily have to display the facts,

996
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,000
it's how the reporter chooses to show the facts.

997
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:59,004
We can't let Vince play us like that again.

998
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:00,972
- Yeah.

999
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:02,473
(cellphone ringing)

1000
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,078
- Excuse me.

1001
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:10,015
Hello?

1002
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:10,982
- Hi. John?

1003
00:49:11,016 --> 00:49:13,985
It's Carl Kilgore, the festival director.

1004
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:16,321
After today's report, we've been receiving calls

1005
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:19,090
from our producers and sponsors trying to figure out

1006
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:21,492
just what kind of operation we're running.

1007
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:23,028
- Sir, I can explain.

1008
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:24,362
That report completely--

1009
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:25,997
- I don't want an explanation.

1010
00:49:26,031 --> 00:49:28,099
I'm giving you an ultimatum.

1011
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:29,734
Do not drag your political

1012
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:33,171
or religious agenda into our production

1013
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:36,241
or you will be disqualified from the competition.

1014
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:37,575
Understand?

1015
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:39,010
- Yes, sir.

1016
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:39,744
I do.

1017
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,146
- Goodnight.

1018
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:50,321
* To think of all I had

1019
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:53,324
* For me, it makes me laugh

1020
00:49:58,296 --> 00:49:59,697
- How's this?

1021
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:07,105
(soft music)

1022
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:15,713
- This is good.

1023
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,048
- Really? You think so?

1024
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:17,815
- This is really good.

1025
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,784
This is great.

1026
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:21,619
When did you come up with this?

1027
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,288
- Grace.

1028
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:25,190
(knocking at the door)

1029
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:33,731
- Hey.

1030
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:34,399
- Hey.

1031
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:35,533
John, you have to hear this.

1032
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:37,702
Angela just finished writing the lyrics of this song

1033
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,737
and I built a score, and that little tune she wrote, great.

1034
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:44,609
- Hey, Cam, I'm sure it's great but we can't do this.

1035
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:46,311
- What do you mean?

1036
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:48,846
- Carl Kilgore called and he says we have to change

1037
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,415
our project or drop out of the festival entirely.

1038
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:51,616
- No way.

1039
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:56,187
- I'm not gonna quit just because

1040
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:58,723
we were rejected for some talent show.

1041
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,725
- Some talent show?

1042
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,593
Cameron, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

1043
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:05,730
If we pursue this now,

1044
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:08,333
we can come back to Grace when we have more time.

1045
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:09,534
- Are you serious?

1046
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,535
You're backing out?

1047
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:12,737
I thought you'd be man enough

1048
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,539
to see this through to the end?

1049
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,407
And for the record, you were the one

1050
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:19,344
who invited Vince out to the set to begin with.

1051
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:20,811
- Are you saying this is my fault?

1052
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,380
- Basically, yes.

1053
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:34,659
- I'm the director.

1054
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,794
I deserve a little respect.

1055
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:58,416
- So, now what do we do?

1056
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,451
- It doesn't look like we've got

1057
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:01,752
a lot of a choice at this point.

1058
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,822
- I disagree.

1059
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,724
Everything involves making a choice.

1060
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:10,261
To get involved in the beginning was your choice.

1061
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:13,864
You said you wanted to protect and defend Grace Jackson.

1062
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:18,569
Now the way I see it you have another choice to make,

1063
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:20,638
whether to stand with your family and friends,

1064
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:23,174
do the right thing and be proud of your actions,

1065
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,909
or take the coward's way out.

1066
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,178
Follow the spotlight

1067
00:52:27,212 --> 00:52:29,146
and find somewhere else to sleep.

1068
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,886
So, gentlemen, where do we stand?

1069
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:39,890
- I'm in.

1070
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:45,496
I'm in all the way.

1071
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,733
Let's make a movie and change the world, huh?

1072
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,206
- Before you go, let me hear the song.

1073
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:57,408
- That good, huh?

1074
00:52:58,376 --> 00:52:58,943
- That good.

1075
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:03,281
(calm music)

1076
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:39,384
* I made this my home

1077
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:43,254
* As we are one

1078
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:45,623
* Fresh out of my life

1079
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:48,259
* My love and I

1080
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:54,632
* Yesterday's so far away

1081
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,873
* A sweet and distant memory

1082
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:05,576
* To think of all I've had

1083
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,279
* For me, makes me laugh

1084
00:54:08,313 --> 00:54:12,883
* It makes me cry

1085
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:17,788
* This is where I belong

1086
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:20,991
* My shelter from the storm

1087
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:24,762
* Lord, faithful to you I've been

1088
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:29,800
* I'm begging you again

1089
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:35,540
* We made our start here

1090
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:39,076
* This is my heart here

1091
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,713
* My life has been here

1092
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:46,651
* Don't take it all away

1093
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:49,854
* We raised our family

1094
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:53,458
* To know your glory

1095
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,727
* This home devoted

1096
00:54:56,761 --> 00:55:01,699
* Solely unto you

1097
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:10,941
* Suffer, fear and doubt are rising in me

1098
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,810
* Please Lord, hear my cry

1099
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:14,645
* Show me mercy

1100
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,381
* God I pray

1101
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:20,585
* Make a way

1102
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:24,955
* Lord, you are my refuge and my fortress

1103
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:29,994
* Will you not protect me I am helpless

1104
00:55:31,396 --> 00:55:36,467
* Make a way

1105
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:40,037
* This is where I belong

1106
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,508
* My shelter from the storm

1107
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:46,877
* Lord, faithful to you I've been

1108
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:51,916
* I'm begging you again

1109
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:57,855
* We made our start here

1110
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:01,125
* This is my heart here

1111
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:04,962
* My life has been here

1112
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:08,699
* Don't take it all away

1113
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:12,002
* We raised our family

1114
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:15,673
* To know Your glory

1115
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,076
* This home devoted

1116
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:24,081
* Solely unto You

1117
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:34,492
* These memories are too much for me to bear

1118
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:41,699
* A lifetime of this life that we once shared

1119
00:56:43,668 --> 00:56:46,737
* How can they take away

1120
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:50,941
* This land I call my home

1121
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:55,913
* Oh God, I'm helpless fighting this alone

1122
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:45,195
* This is where I belong

1123
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:49,033
* My shelter from the storm

1124
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:52,570
* I'm right here on my knees

1125
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:56,040
* This song it is

1126
00:57:56,073 --> 00:58:00,711
* I'm here

1127
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:10,054
* My husband died here

1128
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:17,027
* My heart is tied here

1129
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:24,168
* My life has been here

1130
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:29,173
* Don't take it all away

1131
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:43,220
- So how does our tragic tale end?

1132
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:46,891
Be in the Widow's Field on Friday at eight o'clock

1133
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:50,060
and we'll all see how this tale comes to a close.

1134
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:54,965
(soft melancholic music)

1135
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:00,037
- Time to talk to a mailman.

1136
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:02,573
- So how's the production going?

1137
00:59:02,607 --> 00:59:04,174
- Yeah, pretty well.

1138
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,176
We've been disqualified from the festival.

1139
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,111
- What?

1140
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:08,779
- Yeah.

1141
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:10,781
See, after Vince's report, the festival directors called

1142
00:59:10,815 --> 00:59:12,717
and told us not to bring our political agendas

1143
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,284
into the competition.

1144
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:15,653
- That's ridiculous.

1145
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:16,787
I wish there was something I could do.

1146
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:18,989
- There is.

1147
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:20,190
- Awesome.

1148
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,692
Do you want me to play the sheriff?

1149
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:23,193
- No, not exactly.

1150
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:25,630
See, without the festival we have no way of getting

1151
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:28,899
the film in front of people before the upcoming elections.

1152
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:30,034
- So what are you looking for?

1153
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,035
What do you want to be done?

1154
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:34,171
- We made a DVD that has most of the film on it

1155
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:36,907
and an explanation of where they can see the rest.

1156
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:38,275
We need to get this DVD into the hands

1157
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:41,879
of as many families in Ringer City as we possibly can.

1158
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,148
And you deliver to over half of them.

1159
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,215
- Wait a minute.

1160
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:46,784
I'm not gonna do that.

1161
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:48,686
That's ridiculous. That's illegal.

1162
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:51,021
You're asking me to go around town taunting your DVD

1163
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:53,190
and then you don't even make me your sheriff.

1164
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:54,124
The audacity!

1165
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:55,626
- Wallace.

1166
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,795
Wallace, these people are your friends.

1167
00:59:57,828 --> 01:00:00,197
Give them the DVDs on your "break time".

1168
01:00:02,867 --> 01:00:04,134
- I'll lose my job.

1169
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:08,639
(slow bagpipe music)

1170
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:10,140
- Aye.

1171
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:11,608
You may lose your job,

1172
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:17,181
but lying on your bed many years from now.

1173
01:00:21,018 --> 01:00:22,953
- Okay, I'll do it.

1174
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:25,656
- Good.

1175
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,257
I'll get you those DVDs tomorrow.

1176
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,862
And, Wallace, thanks.

1177
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:36,801
- They can take my job but they can never take my freedom.

1178
01:00:38,903 --> 01:00:40,270
(car starting)

1179
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:45,309
(dramatic music)

1180
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,274
- Mr. Moore?

1181
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:18,208
- Yes? - Yes?

1182
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:20,344
- Mr. Kilgore can see you now.

1183
01:01:23,948 --> 01:01:25,249
- Dad, aren't you coming?

1184
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:26,751
- No, this is your appointment.

1185
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:30,320
You'll do just fine, son.

1186
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:36,794
(dramatic music)

1187
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:37,795
- Mr. Kilgore?

1188
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:38,495
- Yes?

1189
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:42,366
(dramatic music)

1190
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,402
- Let me guess.

1191
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,337
You wanna be a cinematographer one day?

1192
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:48,739
- Yes, sir.

1193
01:01:48,773 --> 01:01:50,340
- Well, how can I help you, young man?

1194
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:52,509
- Well, sir, our family put together a movie

1195
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,846
for your festival, but it got disqualified.

1196
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,115
- Well, we don't allow films

1197
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:01,285
with overt political or religious tone.

1198
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:03,287
It reflects poorly on the festival.

1199
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,288
- You're just saying that because

1200
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,256
of the news report by Vince.

1201
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:08,893
- That had a lot to do with our decision, yes.

1202
01:02:08,926 --> 01:02:11,095
- Well, the guy who made that is our competitor,

1203
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:12,462
Vince Warner.

1204
01:02:12,496 --> 01:02:14,098
He's also moving on to state level.

1205
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:15,232
- Really?

1206
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:16,433
I wasn't aware of that.

1207
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:19,336
Jenny?

1208
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:20,971
- Yes, sir?

1209
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:22,372
- Put me through to the reporter who contacted us

1210
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,242
for comments about the cult group.

1211
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:29,346
Alleged cult group.

1212
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:30,848
- Right away, sir.

1213
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:35,152
- Hello. Vince Warner.

1214
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:36,353
- Hello Vince.

1215
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:39,056
This is Carl Kilgore, press agent and selection manager

1216
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,324
for the American View Finder.

1217
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:41,491
- Oh yes, sir.

1218
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:42,793
How are you?

1219
01:02:42,827 --> 01:02:44,361
- Doing fine.

1220
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:46,430
I've a quick question.

1221
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:48,332
It has been brought to my attention

1222
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:50,234
that you're not only a contestant

1223
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:52,269
on the American View Finder,

1224
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:53,871
but you're also the reporter

1225
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:56,473
who did the story on the Moore Family.

1226
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:57,474
Is that true?

1227
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:58,909
- Yes, sir. It is.

1228
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:00,244
- I have a gentleman here

1229
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:03,147
who believes your participation in the festival

1230
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,116
has influenced your angle on the story.

1231
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,152
- Who contacted you?

1232
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:09,453
- Their cinematographer.

1233
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:11,355
(Vince laughing)

1234
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:12,589
- Ridiculous.

1235
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,324
Of course he's upset.

1236
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:17,361
And he'd tell you anything to get back in the festival.

1237
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,429
The only reason they're going to state

1238
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,966
is that the little cyclops got sympathy votes

1239
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:23,533
for his eye patch story.

1240
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:24,969
A cheap tactic, sir.

1241
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,271
- Thank you.

1242
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,372
You've told me all I need to know.

1243
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:29,206
- Anytime.

1244
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:30,307
And sir?

1245
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,308
I'm looking forward to meeting you

1246
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:32,843
in person one of these days.

1247
01:03:32,877 --> 01:03:35,079
It will be a tremendous pleasure, I'm sure.

1248
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:36,380
- Have a good day.

1249
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:43,120
Well, that certainly complicates things.

1250
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,355
Let me do some research and I'll get back to you.

1251
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:46,991
- Thank you.

1252
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:49,426
And, sir, you can start your research by watching this.

1253
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:52,496
It's the first 20 minutes of the film we've been working on.

1254
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:55,532
Once you know what we've been working on, it might help.

1255
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,567
- Sure. Why not.

1256
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:59,036
Thank you for coming.

1257
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:00,437
I need to get back to work.

1258
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:03,507
(upbeat dramatic music)

1259
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:22,686
- I like it.

1260
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,688
- I'm glad our singing's pre-recorded.

1261
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,323
- Huh?

1262
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:29,126
- I'd be too afraid to sing in front of a live crowd.

1263
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:30,260
- That makes two of us.

1264
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:36,333
- Hurry up!

1265
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:37,701
We're already late.

1266
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:38,668
The movie's almost over by now

1267
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:41,538
and we have to be live in 10 minutes.

1268
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:48,612
(calm music)

1269
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:58,555
- You won't have to play this up.

1270
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:02,659
(calm music)

1271
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:10,434
- Get your gear and start setting up.

1272
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,169
Get the real radical stuff.

1273
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:13,337
Anything that looks violent.

1274
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,640
Come on. Go!

1275
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:23,647
(upbeat dramatic music)

1276
01:06:30,387 --> 01:06:33,290
* Did you ever have the chance

1277
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:36,393
* To do something really noble

1278
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:39,296
* But then the fear and doubt

1279
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,366
* Rendered you immobile

1280
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:45,569
* Set aside your selfishness

1281
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:48,805
* Your wishes and desires

1282
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:52,109
* And do for someone now's a thing

1283
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:55,745
* Which decency requires

1284
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:58,715
* You know you should

1285
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:01,751
* You know you can

1286
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:04,721
* This is the time

1287
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:09,693
* This is the plan

1288
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:14,498
* Be brave and have good courage, men

1289
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,467
* You cannot live in bondage, men

1290
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:20,604
* Step up and send your ground and then

1291
01:07:20,637 --> 01:07:24,208
* We'll have justice once again

1292
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:26,743
* Follow me, I do confess

1293
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,679
* Together we are braver, yes

1294
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:32,849
* Go and set your ground today

1295
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:37,754
* Together we must save her

1296
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:52,602
* If this was your affliction

1297
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:55,605
* The trial that you posses

1298
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:58,775
* Would you not pray for help, my friend

1299
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:01,745
* The evil to suppress

1300
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:04,648
* This burden is too much for her

1301
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:07,717
* She simply could not bear

1302
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,854
* Would you not lend a hand, my friend

1303
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:14,791
* Relieve her from despair

1304
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,627
* You know you should

1305
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:20,730
* You know you can

1306
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,600
* This is the time

1307
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:28,805
* This is the plan

1308
01:08:30,307 --> 01:08:33,310
* Be brave and have good courage, men

1309
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:36,480
* You cannot live in bondage, men

1310
01:08:36,513 --> 01:08:39,649
* Step up and stand your ground and then

1311
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:42,919
* We'll have justice once again

1312
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,755
* Follow me, I do confess

1313
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:48,725
* Together we are braver, yes

1314
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:51,795
* Go and stand your ground today

1315
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:56,533
* Together we must save her

1316
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:59,603
* For far too long in selfish pride

1317
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:02,739
* You set aside and compromise

1318
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:05,809
* The justice that this town desires

1319
01:09:05,842 --> 01:09:08,745
* And build it with your wicked lies

1320
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:11,815
* Side by side in one accord

1321
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:15,219
* Stand up, be strong do not ignore

1322
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:18,288
* The widow's cry for help you hear

1323
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:22,826
* The laws of God you should reveal

1324
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:27,864
(upbeat dramatic music)

1325
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:53,423
- Well, where do you stand?

1326
01:09:53,457 --> 01:09:54,724
Are you with justice?

1327
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:56,360
- If we don't let the railroad company

1328
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:57,927
have the widow's home

1329
01:09:57,961 --> 01:10:00,764
then Foster County gets the train station

1330
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:02,632
and we become a ghost town.

1331
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:04,734
I'm all for keeping this town alive.

1332
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:08,738
- As my friend, but at the expense of justice?

1333
01:10:08,772 --> 01:10:11,207
To steal from a widow and the town?

1334
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:14,511
Must we pervert the law to grow?

1335
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:16,313
Tom?

1336
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:17,514
- Yeah?

1337
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,715
- If you stood on your land

1338
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:22,352
and the sheriff and his men told you at gunpoint to get off.

1339
01:10:22,386 --> 01:10:23,453
What would you do?

1340
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,654
- I'd tell them to get lost.

1341
01:10:24,688 --> 01:10:26,656
We pay for this land that we lay in.

1342
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,625
- But if you were gone

1343
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:30,827
and your wife were held at gunpoint, what then?

1344
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:33,397
Can't you see?

1345
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:34,931
An individual has no chance against

1346
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:37,867
this breach of justice, this rampage of greed,

1347
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:39,836
the hearts of men filled with lust.

1348
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:43,407
Is this progress?

1349
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,443
When we trample on the weakest and dearest of our citizens?

1350
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:49,913
- Yeah, he's right.

1351
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:51,315
Deal with the sheriff.

1352
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:52,782
- Yeah, down with that tyrant.

1353
01:10:52,816 --> 01:10:53,817
- Wait.

1354
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:57,887
(people disagreeing)

1355
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,329
- Wait a minute.

1356
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:06,396
(gunshot)

1357
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:07,697
- Whoa!

1358
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:10,400
- Listen to me.

1359
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,272
Sheriff's not the problem.

1360
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,408
For all practical purposes,

1361
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:20,910
he's just a misguided public servant.

1362
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,446
He doesn't care about the railroad.

1363
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:26,683
He listened to your demands, followed your desires,

1364
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:29,719
you are the tyrants.

1365
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,323
(creaking door sound)

1366
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:36,526
- Look to each other if you want to see

1367
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,695
who's trampling the widow down.

1368
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:42,866
In this land where freedom is every man's greatest pride,

1369
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:45,869
and order is held high, how could it be

1370
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:49,573
that the defenseless would become oppressed?

1371
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:52,041
Oppressed by the very neighbors that, in another time,

1372
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:54,978
would've given their lives to defend one another.

1373
01:11:56,413 --> 01:11:58,382
You've become so removed from each other

1374
01:11:58,415 --> 01:12:00,016
that you don't even see how your actions

1375
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,818
lead to a widow's loss.

1376
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:07,591
But if a wall can be torn down and can be built up again,

1377
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:11,828
together restoring equity to your law and to your city,

1378
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:15,799
God's hand of blessing makes a mighty nation,

1379
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:18,768
not a railroad.

1380
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:23,507
(crowd applause)

1381
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:28,545
(calm music)

1382
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,929
- Well, what do you say?

1383
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:56,806
(upbeat dramatic music)

1384
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:06,883
- What happened?

1385
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:07,951
- I don't know.

1386
01:13:18,662 --> 01:13:19,829
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1387
01:13:19,863 --> 01:13:21,565
we're having some technical difficulties.

1388
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:24,868
We'll try to be back up in just a few minutes.

1389
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:25,935
Thank you.

1390
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:27,837
- Live in 60 seconds.

1391
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:30,707
- Did you queue mob sequence?

1392
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:31,941
- Yeah.

1393
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:40,216
- Hey, Vince is here with his news posse.

1394
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,851
- John, look at this.

1395
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:44,187
- Do we have another cord?

1396
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,622
- Yes, but I can't plug it in.

1397
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:47,824
Someone must have ran over with the cable.

1398
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:49,092
The tip's broken off inside the jack.

1399
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,027
- Now what?

1400
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,095
- Okay, guys.

1401
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:53,797
It's time for phase two.

1402
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:56,566
- You know, this probably means losing the election.

1403
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,067
- Sometimes you gotta lose a battle

1404
01:13:58,101 --> 01:13:59,603
to win the war, guys.

1405
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,671
I'm not in this to win a competition.

1406
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:03,072
We're in this to help Grace Jackson.

1407
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:05,909
- Isn't this part where I tackle you?

1408
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:17,487
- Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming

1409
01:14:17,521 --> 01:14:20,056
and giving your time to support this movie.

1410
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,158
I'm sorry for the difficulties.

1411
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:24,828
Cameron's working on getting the DVD going now.

1412
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:26,596
- Ten seconds.

1413
01:14:30,734 --> 01:14:32,135
- We're back with further developments on

1414
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:35,038
the group of families and their controversial film project,

1415
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:36,506
"The Widow's Might".

1416
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,107
Today, the families have rallied supporters

1417
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:41,611
at the widow's home just off the highway in Ringer County.

1418
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:43,980
Vince Warner is live on the scene.

1419
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:44,981
Vince?

1420
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:45,982
- Thank you, Sarah.

1421
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:48,251
I'm here in the Widow's Field where protesters

1422
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:50,987
have assembled and drawn quite a crowd.

1423
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,722
- And how are they able to do that?

1424
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:53,923
- They drew in a lot of interest

1425
01:14:53,957 --> 01:14:56,726
with the premiere of their film, "The Widow's Might",

1426
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,528
which is screened here for the audience.

1427
01:14:58,562 --> 01:15:00,129
I had an opportunity to see the film

1428
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:02,298
which strongly suggest mob action

1429
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,968
as the answer to political problems.

1430
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,202
- Yeah, he's right.

1431
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,871
Down with the sheriff.

1432
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:09,272
- Yeah. Down with that tyrant.

1433
01:15:09,305 --> 01:15:11,240
- Yeah.

1434
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:14,243
- They have a frightening amount of support

1435
01:15:14,277 --> 01:15:16,245
from fringed residents of Ringer.

1436
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:19,949
- So what's currently happening at the location?

1437
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:22,185
- And now we'd like to bring up a very important man.

1438
01:15:22,218 --> 01:15:24,220
- It looks like they're about to bring up Jim Morton.

1439
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:28,191
- A candidate in the current race for mayor of Ringer.

1440
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:30,727
And the man who, in his own way,

1441
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,128
got us started on this project.

1442
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:37,333
Mr. Sam Warner.

1443
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:41,705
(crowd applause)

1444
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:47,877
- Thank you.

1445
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:49,145
Thank you people of Ringer.

1446
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:53,249
Well, that was a great story we just saw there.

1447
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:54,951
Our own Ringer County was much like

1448
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:56,285
that little cow town in the film

1449
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:57,854
but just not too many years ago.

1450
01:15:59,122 --> 01:16:02,592
And we have roads, we have fine schools--

1451
01:16:02,626 --> 01:16:03,793
- Do you think this will work?

1452
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:05,061
- We have public utilities--

1453
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:06,630
- The people are amazing.

1454
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:08,231
They'll even do what's right to get what they want.

1455
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:12,301
- The issue of Grace Jackson and her home is one

1456
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:14,170
that has weighed heavily on me

1457
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:17,907
since I learned about it several weeks ago.

1458
01:16:17,941 --> 01:16:22,946
As mayor of Ringer, I pledge that I will do my best

1459
01:16:23,146 --> 01:16:26,683
to alleviate taxes on the elderly,

1460
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:30,720
and I believe that I can safely say

1461
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:34,290
that Grace Jackson will not lose her home.

1462
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:38,762
(crowd applause)

1463
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:47,270
- Cut the feed after this.

1464
01:16:49,038 --> 01:16:51,107
- Vince is requesting a feed cut.

1465
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,275
- And now ladies and gentlemen,

1466
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:54,210
we'd like to bring up a woman who,

1467
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,880
despite being under tremendous pressures,

1468
01:16:56,913 --> 01:17:00,249
has maintained the spirit of charity and peace.

1469
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:01,184
- It's attracting a lot of viewers.

1470
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:02,385
We can't cut.

1471
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:05,722
- Ladies and gentlemen, Grace Jackson,

1472
01:17:05,755 --> 01:17:08,091
or as you know her, the widow Grace.

1473
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:12,328
(crowd applause)

1474
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,865
- Thank you.

1475
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:20,169
I appreciate all you all being here.

1476
01:17:20,203 --> 01:17:25,174
I want to thank all my friends for all their support.

1477
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:28,878
And especially for these families

1478
01:17:28,912 --> 01:17:33,382
that have worked so hard, not just for me,

1479
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:37,854
but so no one would ever have to lose their home.

1480
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:42,926
You all have allowed me to hope.

1481
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:48,031
Mr. Warner, I appreciate your offering

1482
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:51,200
to make my case an exception

1483
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:55,671
and I promise I will hold you to that if you were reelected.

1484
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:59,342
But I want all you all to know

1485
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:02,445
that my vote will be going for Jim Morton.

1486
01:18:02,478 --> 01:18:07,683
(crowd applause)

1487
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,286
- Cut the feed!

1488
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:11,420
- I can't.

1489
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:12,455
- Shut the camera down.

1490
01:18:12,488 --> 01:18:13,857
They'll get the idea.

1491
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,260
- Look, I'm just doing my job.

1492
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:19,695
I'm not gonna lose that job so you can keep yours.

1493
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,234
- Well, first of all, I'd like to thank you for coming out

1494
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:27,971
in support of Grace Jackson.

1495
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:29,438
I know a lot of you saw in the news features

1496
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:30,907
about our families.

1497
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,310
That kind of misrepresentation and slander,

1498
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:38,247
be it national news or a personal blog

1499
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:41,284
can cause unbelievable damage to a good name.

1500
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:43,219
- Looks like you've step in it, son.

1501
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:47,456
You Vince Warner?

1502
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:50,026
- Yes. And you?

1503
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:52,295
- Carl Kilgore, Regional Manager

1504
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:54,263
for the American View Finder.

1505
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:56,099
- And now, I would like you to see

1506
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:58,234
for yourselves who we really are.

1507
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:02,505
I would like my family, the Moores, Cameron and Angela.

1508
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:04,273
Come on the stage, please.

1509
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:05,274
(crowd applause)

1510
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:07,376
- I'm looking forward to seeing your entry

1511
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,412
into the state levels competition.

1512
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:13,449
But even more than that, I'm looking

1513
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:16,019
for an accurate report on the Moore Family.

1514
01:19:17,386 --> 01:19:19,155
You see what I mean, son?

1515
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:20,824
You really did step in it.

1516
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:24,994
- Have we got anything?

1517
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:26,830
- We've got the video but no audio.

1518
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:28,798
- Man, how are we gonna do this?

1519
01:19:28,832 --> 01:19:30,333
We can't just keep stalling.

1520
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:34,270
- Wait here.

1521
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:35,304
Derek.

1522
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,345
- Psst! Hey! We're still live.

1523
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,525
- Shut that camera off!

1524
01:20:09,072 --> 01:20:11,507
- It looks like the guys have a solution.

1525
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,342
- What's this?

1526
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:16,079
- In giving the film, we have to do the audio ourselves.

1527
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:18,081
- That is crazy.

1528
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:19,348
- We have to.

1529
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,917
- There is no way that I can sing

1530
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,285
in front of all these people.

1531
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,286
I'm sorry.

1532
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:26,222
- Look, stand behind the Moores and the Mortons.

1533
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:28,524
They've stood behind us this whole production.

1534
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:31,394
- They'll miss the whole scene at the end with the sheriff.

1535
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:34,563
- No, they won't.

1536
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:40,937
- All right.

1537
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,471
We didn't fix the audio issue

1538
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:45,274
but we have a solution anyway.

1539
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:47,510
We're gonna do it live.

1540
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:49,946
(crowd applause)

1541
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:52,015
In the last scene, we saw a cowboy

1542
01:20:52,048 --> 01:20:54,017
coming to face the sheriff.

1543
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,384
And the last line was--

1544
01:20:59,122 --> 01:21:01,557
- Well, what do you say?

1545
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,561
- Yes.

1546
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,864
I'll stand with justice.

1547
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:11,901
And you know what?

1548
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:14,470
I'm sorry.

1549
01:21:15,972 --> 01:21:19,008
We should've never let this injustice slide by.

1550
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:20,509
We should've never supported it.

1551
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:25,181
I let my own greed for power stand in the way.

1552
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:28,584
But no more.

1553
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:32,355
Grace Jackson and all the residents of this fine town,

1554
01:21:34,257 --> 01:21:37,026
never be trampled under again.

1555
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,361
Not on my watch.

1556
01:21:43,132 --> 01:21:45,268
- Do you hear him?

1557
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:47,503
Will you hold him to that promise?

1558
01:21:47,536 --> 01:21:50,039
(crowd applause)

1559
01:21:50,073 --> 01:21:53,576
- And you, will you hold them to theirs?

1560
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:56,479
- I will.

1561
01:21:58,181 --> 01:21:59,582
I swear that I shall.

1562
01:22:01,217 --> 01:22:06,222
I swear before God above, to you, the people,

1563
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:10,359
and to the widow Grace.

1564
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:35,584
* I made this my home as a young bride

1565
01:22:36,085 --> 01:22:41,090
* My life built on faith my love and I

1566
01:22:41,424 --> 01:22:46,429
* Yesterday and still today

1567
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:52,135
* We chose that day where we would serve

1568
01:22:52,168 --> 01:22:55,604
* Our lives' with you without reserve

1569
01:22:55,638 --> 01:23:00,609
* Day by day you give us strength

1570
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:06,749
* This is where I belong

1571
01:23:06,782 --> 01:23:10,519
* My shelter from the storm

1572
01:23:10,553 --> 01:23:14,023
* Lord, faithful to you I've been

1573
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:19,028
* I'm thanking you again

1574
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:24,333
* We made our start here

1575
01:23:24,367 --> 01:23:27,670
* This is my heart here

1576
01:23:27,703 --> 01:23:31,574
* My life has been here

1577
01:23:31,607 --> 01:23:34,777
* Because of you I'll stay

1578
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:38,281
* She made her start here

1579
01:23:38,314 --> 01:23:41,584
* This is her heart here

1580
01:23:41,617 --> 01:23:45,154
* Her life has been here

1581
01:23:45,188 --> 01:23:48,657
* It's only right she stay

1582
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:52,295
* We were courageous

1583
01:23:52,328 --> 01:23:55,831
* Our faith contagious

1584
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,601
* We put our trust in you

1585
01:23:58,634 --> 01:24:02,505
* To show the way

1586
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:07,543
* You who gave me hope and taught me patience

1587
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:14,650
* Help me how to show you my devotion

1588
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:21,524
* You who stood by her when she was all alone

1589
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:25,094
* You heard her cry

1590
01:24:25,128 --> 01:24:26,595
* You heard my cry

1591
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:31,667
* Now here I pray

1592
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:36,639
(slow melancholic music)

1593
01:24:39,242 --> 01:24:43,646
(crowd applause)

1594
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:36,765
- Gator, come here please.

1595
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:39,635
- Yes, dad?

1596
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:42,205
- Gator, John told me you were not very respectful

1597
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:43,739
to Mr. Warner when you went to see him.

1598
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:46,775
- Yes, sir.

1599
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:48,411
- I think we better go see the mayor.

1600
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:58,721
- Mr. Mayor?

1601
01:25:58,754 --> 01:25:59,688
- Yes?

1602
01:26:00,723 --> 01:26:02,325
How can I help you, young man?

1603
01:26:02,358 --> 01:26:05,361
(upbeat music)
