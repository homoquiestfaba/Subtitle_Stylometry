1
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:00,806
What is the meaning of life?

2
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:04,874
Are we here for a reason?

3
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:10,771
Is there a point to any of this?

4
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:17,627
First, I had no idea what was going on.

5
00:01:17,628 --> 00:01:19,793
I... I couldn't see a thing.

6
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:23,533
It was warm.

7
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,270
There was my mother.

8
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:28,504
Every day, I had fun.

9
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:31,808
Was having fun the point?

10
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:34,043
The whole point?

11
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:37,447
No, it couldn't be that simple.

12
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:40,984
Here's one.

13
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:43,620
And then it was over.

14
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:45,889
That's it for you.

15
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,888
No more fun.

16
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:54,898
It seemed like such a short life.

17
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,568
I mean, what exactly did I do?

18
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:00,770
There was some playing.

19
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,906
There was some eating.

20
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:05,442
I dug in the dirt.

21
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:07,677
But when I really thought about it,

22
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:09,740
it didn't add up to much.

23
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:13,650
I was back.

24
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:14,784
And I was a puppy again.

25
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:18,422
Alive and ready to ask
the big questions.

26
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:19,956
To dig for answers.

27
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:22,659
Just let me in there.

28
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,094
Um, where am I?

29
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:26,996
So what else do you have?

30
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:29,833
- Uh, this one here.
- Oh.

31
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,935
- What is it?
- It's a red retriever.

32
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:34,617
Oh. Oh, yeah.

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,542
- Oh!
- Nice dog.

34
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:40,477
Good breed. Easy to train.

35
00:02:40,478 --> 00:02:41,778
You got something smaller?

36
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,747
I got some cute Yorkies over here.

37
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,350
- Oh.
- I got this Japanese Chin.

38
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:48,918
- Ah!
- Uh, poodle.

39
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,916
Corgi over here.

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,914
Got a Pomeranian.

41
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:14,444
Look at all this great stuff.

42
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,439
Somebody knew I was coming.

43
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:19,616
Oh, yeah.

44
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,524
Hey, look at this.

45
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:29,468
What do we have here?

46
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,529
Look at this little guy.

47
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,665
Bet it's worth a couple bucks.

48
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,502
Yeah, it was a knockout
in the second round.

49
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:41,070
I lost everything.
Hang tight, guy.

50
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:43,740
Now, you're buying this time.

51
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:45,942
Not today, buddy.

52
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:49,078
I thought about my life.

53
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,748
I still had so many questions.

54
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:55,151
But I kept coming back
to the same one...

55
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,655
How do I get a drink of water?

56
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,491
Do you want to get an ice cream?

57
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,489
Sure.

58
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,524
What flavor?

59
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:05,429
Mom, I hear something in there.

60
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,896
Hey, honey.

61
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:09,032
Ethan!

62
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,500
Hey, Mom, come here.

63
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:15,772
My God.

64
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:17,040
It looks so thirsty.

65
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,642
It's too hot in there.

66
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:20,644
I think we need to get him out.

67
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:22,446
I can't open the door.

68
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:23,613
Wait, it's locked.

69
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:24,814
Please, Mom.

70
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:26,740
Okay, stand back.

71
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,024
You poor thing.

72
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,672
You poor, poor thing.

73
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:51,908
How are you, boy?

74
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,544
- Good?
- What... what is this?

75
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,213
- Mom!
- A boy?

76
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,882
- Boy...
- A boy!

77
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,784
- Are you okay?
- I-I never knew there might be

78
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:02,519
- such a thing as a boy.
- Tired, huh?

79
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,055
I think this little guy
is gonna make it.

80
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,057
- Can we keep him, Mom?
- I don't know.

81
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,159
I think your father might not...

82
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,529
I decided right then and there

83
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,598
I am definitely keeping this boy.

84
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,903
Yeah! Dad, can we keep him?

85
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,606
Well, who's gonna feed him?

86
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:25,008
- I will.
- Who's gonna clean him?

87
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:26,275
I'll do everything, Dad.

88
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:28,277
- You think you're ready to do it?
- Yeah.

89
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:31,047
- Oh, I don't know, son.
- He's a good boy.

90
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:32,181
He's a good boy.

91
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:35,084
Come on, please.

92
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,086
He's a retriever, Dad.

93
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,118
He'll fetch your slippers.

94
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,523
And the paper when it rains.

95
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:41,525
Name something you want fetched.

96
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:42,826
He can do it.

97
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:44,928
Look. Hey, come here!

98
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,991
What are you doing?

99
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,734
So, Ethan and I discussed that the dog

100
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,770
- would be his responsibility.
- Come here! Yeah. Good boy.

101
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,605
Please, Dad?

102
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,575
Come on. He needs a pal.

103
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:00,777
All right, this thing

104
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,779
that you two are doing,
it's dirty pool,...

105
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,880
...okay? Take him away.

106
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:05,815
I want to talk to your mother alone.

107
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:08,184
Okay.

108
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,786
We'll keep it till tomorrow...

109
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,021
You nervous, boy? Don't be.

110
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,289
It'll be okay. Yeah.

111
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,691
We don't have much choice.

112
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:15,792
They make a mess.

113
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,093
- You gotta clean 'em.
- Oh, come on.

114
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,128
- He's gonna be bored with it.
- Oh, come on, Jim.

115
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,930
You know it. You know how he is.

116
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:24,701
If he says no, we can run off
and go find another family.

117
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,236
Ethan?

118
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,038
Yeah?

119
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,707
You have a dog.

120
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,309
Yes! Oh, my gosh, yes!

121
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,078
Come on, boy. Dad!

122
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,614
- Whoo! Yes!
- All right.

123
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:39,649
Oh, my gosh, thank you!

124
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,990
Come on! Come on!

125
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,053
Bailey.

126
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:47,223
B-A-I-L-E-Y, I-I would think.

127
00:06:47,224 --> 00:06:48,805
And I'm Ethan.

128
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,128
I'm the owner.

129
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:54,831
Do you think he knows
how to spell my name?

130
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,032
I would think so, honey.

131
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:57,786
Here you go.

132
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,142
Good boy.

133
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:02,672
Here you go.

134
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,007
Ready?

135
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,241
Come on, Bailey.

136
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:06,643
Bailey, sit.

137
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,144
Sit.

138
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:09,913
Roll over. Roll over.

139
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,350
Get that out of your mouth!

140
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,985
Get that out of your mouth.

141
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:17,286
Okay. Come here.

142
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:19,088
Shake your paw.
Shake your paw.

143
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,224
Come on. Yeah, good boy!

144
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:22,726
Turn around. Turn around.

145
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:24,828
- Come on.
- What's he saying?

146
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:26,329
- It's too many words.
- Come on. Okay.

147
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,097
- I'm gonna do this now.
- Come here.

148
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:29,733
Good job. Good job.

149
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,968
But one word got said
more than any other.

150
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:33,703
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

151
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:34,904
After a while,

152
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:37,373
I came to understand
the words that mattered.

153
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,944
I had a boy, and his name was Ethan.

154
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:42,879
I got a name.

155
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,248
My name was Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

156
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,751
Oh, gee, honey, I wish I'd have
known that you and Wes were...

157
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:50,419
I learned my place in the pack.

158
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,689
Mom liked me.

159
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,990
- Yes...
- Dad liked me.

160
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:56,159
- Yes. Yes, no, I understand.
- A lot.

161
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,161
Oh, excuse me.
Hold on. Come on.

162
00:07:58,162 --> 00:07:59,395
Get down a bit.

163
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,397
I was sad for the cat.

164
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,066
Obviously, he wanted to be a dog.

165
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:06,302
Wasn't my fault he couldn't be a dog.

166
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:10,406
Ethan, it's time to go to bed.

167
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,408
Time to turn out the light, okay?

168
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,990
Okay.

169
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:23,052
Okay, come on. Come on.

170
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,287
Come on. Come on.

171
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,790
Okay.

172
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,892
"Don't! Don't do it, Cap.

173
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:30,326
"Let him have it, Bucky.

174
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,461
"We'll pound some sense
into this character.

175
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:35,899
"Pow! Stomp!

176
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,767
"It's coming right at us.

177
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,235
Jump for your lives!"

178
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:42,038
Ethan always came up
with such great games.

179
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,043
- "Boom!"
- Making noise under a blanket, genius.

180
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:49,212
- "Zap!"
- Every night as I fell asleep,

181
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:53,049
I thought about how happy
I was that I had an Ethan.

182
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,251
And that I wasn't a cat.

183
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:02,091
Bailey, get in the car.

the same question...

199
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,302
"Why can't everything smell like goat?"

200
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,904

Sometimes I thought that trying

213
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:15,064
to make sense out of life
could be a waste of time.

214
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:18,902

they wouldn't share this ball with me.

243
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,394

00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:27,470
- Oh.
- We're trying to train him.

247
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:28,905
I told you.

248
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:30,273
You caught me.
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:34,210
Could you pass me the jam, please?

250
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:38,047
When I wasn't thinking
about food, my mind wandered.

251
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:39,482
Why am I here?

252
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:41,284
What's the purpose?

253
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,152
Oh, yeah. Keep rubbing.

254
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:45,989
And... might there be more bacon?

255
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,924
Oh, look at his plate.

256
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:48,956
You know, the way you eat,

257
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,159
you're gonna grow up to be bigger

258
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,985
than all of us put together.

259
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,261
- Yes!
- Oh!

260
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:55,564
If there's a world to grow up in.

261
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:59,135
These Russians
are putting missiles in Cuba.

262
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,636
Do we have to talk about that now?

263
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,172
- No.
- So, um, Jim,

264
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:05,274
I hear you're up for a new office job.

265
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,910
Why don't you tell us about that?

266
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:08,044
That didn't work out.

267
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:09,512
Well, they want him in the field.

268
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,514
He's one of the top sellers every year.

269
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,416
I got the job nobody wants.

270
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,385
Jim, do you have to?

271
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:19,222
We're three seconds away
from nuclear annihilation.

272
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,937
Uh, can me and Bailey be excused?

273
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,493
Sure.

274
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,663
Ethan was sad.

275
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,105
I didn't know why.

276
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,070
Hey, Bailey.

277
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:36,072
Captain America, remember?

278
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:39,200
He could take out that bomb in a second.

279
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:43,413
Pow!

280
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:56,092
Zap!

281
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:06,002
Oh, you like it, don't you?

282
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:07,240
Whoa.

283
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,241
Come on. Come on.

284
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:14,410
Yeah, boy. Oh!

285
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,711
Okay, Bailey.

286
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,225
Get it, boy!

287
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,516
Whoo! Come on!

288
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:22,351
Yeah, boy! Come on.

289
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:23,552
Come on. Oh, where'd it go?

290
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,388
Where'd it go? Oh, oh!

291
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,356
Come on, boy! Oh! What is that?

292
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:28,657
Get it, boy!

293
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:30,193
Oh, come on.
Come on, get it!

294
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:33,162
- We played with that ball all afternoon.
- Yeah! Come on!

295
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:35,431
- Ethan loved it.
- Good boy!

296
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,133
Get it!

297
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:38,634
Come on! Come on.

298
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:41,337
Hey, Dad, watch this.

299
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:43,406
Look what he can do.

300
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,674
Okay, Bailey. Ready?

301
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:47,110
Ready.

302
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:48,711
Stay. Okay.

303
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:52,548
And...

304
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,083
Okay.

305
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,115
Go, Bailey!

306
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,325
Yeah! Out.

307
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:04,027
That's great, pal.

308
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:05,127
Thanks, Dad.

309
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,695
Hey, hey, come on.

310
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:09,465
Oh, yes. Yes.

311
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,234
Come on. Come on.

312
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,236
- You have a great day.
- When it got colder outside,

313
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:14,770
- we all went back home.
- See ya.

314
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,339
- He'll be fine. Bye.
- Bye.

315
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,041
Every morning,
a big yellow box with wheels

316
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:20,069
took Ethan away from me.

317
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,820
When Mom left the house, too,

318
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:34,290
I was lonely.

319
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,696
And hungry.

320
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:40,085
And bored.

321
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:44,133
At least they left the cat.

322
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,435
I'd give him his dog lessons.

323
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:50,106
Ugh. So much to learn.

324
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:52,541
No, dogs do not hide under pillows.

325
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,143
Come on. Come...

326
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,378
Hey, hey.

327
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,180
Come on, sniff me.

328
00:14:57,181 --> 00:14:59,282
Sniff me!

329
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:01,617
Ugh! You don't know anything.

330
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,237
Wow. You clear your throat a lot.

331
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:14,495
Oh, Bailey, no.

332
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:26,775
Hi, Dad.

333
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:28,495
Elizabeth?

334
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:31,845
- This... this...
- Elizabeth!

335
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:34,850
Hello?

336
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,285
Hey!

337
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,352
That's my slipper.

338
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,487
Bailey! Bailey!

339
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:39,722
Come... Get back here.

340
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:41,167
Bailey, no!

341
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:44,327
Bailey, come here.

342
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:46,895
Come here. Come here.

343
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:48,731
Bailey, come here.

344
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:49,965
- Give me that.
- When Dad was in

345
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:52,201
the right mood, he was
so much fun to play with.

346
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,436
Come on, let go. Let go. Let go.

347
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:54,570
That's not yours, Bailey.

348
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:55,636
That's mine. That's mine!

349
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,307
You come over here.
Come on!

350
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,712
Ethan, my boss is coming over tonight,

351
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,414
and he cannot see my office like this.

352
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:07,350
Do you understand?

353
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:09,485
You have got to start
telling this dog who's boss.

354
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:11,454
Here, take him. Just take him.

355
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:13,489
And you say, "I am the boss!"

356
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,624
You gotta show him who's boss.

357
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:19,228
All right, everything goes
back where it belongs.

358
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,696
I want this place spick-and-span.

359
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:23,232
Do you understand?
Well, do you understand?

360
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,633
Do you understand?!

361
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:26,559
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

362
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:31,874
I want everything
just the way I like it.

363
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,876
Spick-and-span.

364
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:36,579
Why? Because I'm the boss.
That's why.

365
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,449
I'm the boss man,
and you're the boss dog.

366
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:44,720
Boss dog.

367
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,790
Boss dog.

368
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,392
Boss dog.

369
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:52,528
Boss dog.

370
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:53,560
Ethan.

371
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:55,831
Come on. Let's go.

372
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,500
We got guests coming any minute.

373
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:58,734
Chop-chop.

374
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:04,573
Jim?

375
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:06,975
- What?
- Jim, can you help me?

376
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:07,852
Huh?

377
00:17:07,854 --> 00:17:09,679
I don't know how to
make a Singapore Sling.

378
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,947
What?

379
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,682
Oh, I'll show you.

380
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,251
I can make a whiskey cobbler.

381
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:16,752
Wait, here's the recipe.

382
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:18,654
Elizabeth, what are you...
what are you doing?

383
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:19,855
Well, we need spirit...

384
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:23,626
Saint-Gaudens 1907 golden eagle.

385
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,757
Real gold.

386
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:29,898
No! Hey!

387
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:31,400
Ethan was good to me.

388
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,001
- Boy! No!
- He always shared his food.

389
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:35,838
Do you have it in your mouth?
Did you swallow it?

390
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,340
- Wasn't my favorite treat.
- Come on, show me.

391
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:38,674
- And he wanted it back.
- Come on, come on.

392
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,409
Why?

393
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:45,881
- We made it.
- Hello! Ellen.

394
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,416
Come in. Welcome.

395
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,352
- Yes.
- I am glad we were finally able

396
00:17:49,353 --> 00:17:51,687
to make it out here,
because I have been wanting

397
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,922
to, uh, visit the field office
for a while now.

398
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:56,859
Oh, yes, and it's... it's so nice and...

399
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,961
quiet out here in the suburbs.

400
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:00,863
- It sure is. Yeah.
- Yes.

401
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,598
Well, we're happy to have you.

402
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:05,468
Um, so I-I've been meaning to say we...

403
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:06,802
uh, we're real impressed

404
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:08,404
with your numbers this past year, Jim.

405
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:09,772
Real impressed.

406
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:11,640
You know, I'm glad you brought that up.

407
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:14,910
Uh, I've actually been meaning
to talk to you about that.

408
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,881
You know, I-I was thinking,
with the numbers so high,

409
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:21,650
maybe it's time I get off the road

410
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:24,820
and take an office position.

411
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,955
Well, we... we really
need you on the road.

412
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:30,393
That's the backbone
of the whole operation really.

413
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:31,727
I'll be honest, Jim.

414
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,496
You are one of our best
traveling salesmen.

415
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:37,689
I mean, I would be crazy
to take you out of the field.

416
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,743
Um, are you still collecting coins?

417
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:49,312
Oh, sure.

418
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:50,481
What... what's your showpiece?

419
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,451
1907 Saint-Gaudens golden eagle.

420
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:56,752
Oh! Well, Herman,

421
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:57,784
I don't know anything about coins,

422
00:18:57,787 --> 00:18:58,681
but I know that that is special.

423
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,356
- That is special.
- That is a treasure.

424
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,725
Yeah, I have never seen one
up close before.

425
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,993
- It's quite a coin.
- Yeah, it's a beauty.

426
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,929
I'll show you. I'll go get it.

427
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,565
Well, maybe after dinner.

428
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,534
Let me go get it later.

429
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:13,502
May I please be excused?

430
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:14,837
Huh?

431
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:17,440
May I please be excused?

432
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:19,475
Need to take Bailey out for a walk.

433
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:21,435
Sure, honey.

434
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:25,748
Go on, do it.

435
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,049
Please, Bailey.

436
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,984
Please, Bailey, do it.
Come on.

437
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:30,786
What does he want from me?

438
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:32,988
Come on. Come on.

439
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:36,091
I really wish I knew what he was saying.

440
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,493
Go! Go! Come on!

441
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:39,428
What's your problem?
Come on!

442
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,067
I don't know why he was so
upset, but it made me anxious.

443
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:49,502
And when I'm anxious, things
kind of move super fast.

444
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:56,078
This was a first.

445
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,014
I'd never seen him so happy
to clean up after me.

446
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:00,549
Yes! Found it!

447
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:04,086
It's important
it shouldn't be too sweet.

448
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:05,754
- No, it's nice. Mmm.
- See this?

449
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:06,955
- Oh.
- Now, this...

450
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,657
- Mm-hmm.
- ...that's something

451
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:10,459
- for your eyes to feast on.
- No!

452
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,560
What?

453
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:12,828
There's a rat.

454
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:14,029
- What? -What?
- Right there!

455
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,964
- Where? No, I don't like rats.
- Where?

456
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,099
- Where is it? -It's okay.
- Under the table.

457
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,134
- I love rats.
- Yeah, go get it, Bailey.

458
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,132
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

459
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,336
- I don't see anything.
- Where?

460
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,472
- It's running over there.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

461
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,107
Get that dog! Get the dog.

462
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,070
- Get the dog. Get the...
- Bailey!

463
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:28,143
- I don't see anything.
- - Come here.

464
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,479
- It's right there.
- Maybe you saw Smokey.

465
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,815
- Definitely not Smokey.
- No, it wasn't Smokey.

466
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,450
I really don't like rats.
I don't like rats.

467
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:35,618
It's more scared of you
than you are of him.

468
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:37,152
- Oh, oh!
- Come here. Come here, Bailey.

469
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,987
- Come here! Come here.
- Can you grab him? Grab him.

470
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,155
- Jim.
- Bailey! Bailey, come here!

471
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,424
Come here!

472
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:42,558
Wait. Please, Bailey.

473
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,859
- Can you grab him, Jim?
- I don't see anything.

474
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,461
Bailey!

475
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:47,095
Bailey, come here.

476
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:48,464
I think it's gone now.

477
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:49,665
Oh, I don't like rats!

478
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,500
Whoa!

479
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,701
Bailey!

480
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:53,836
What was that?

481
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:55,834
Herman!

482
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,835
Bailey, come here!

483
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,674
Come here! Come on!

484
00:20:58,675 --> 00:20:59,875
You got him, Jim?
You got him?

485
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:06,882
Whoa!

486
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:09,618
Any chances I had
of a promotion, forget it.

487
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:11,954
Dad! Dad, stop!

488
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:14,189
- It's not his fault. It's...
- You made us look like fools!

489
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,991
Dad always talked so loud
when he smelled this way.

490
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:17,192
Don't punish him! My fault!

491
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,094
Jim, why don't we
take a moment before you...

492
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:20,763
No, from now on, he stays out here.

493
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:22,765
He didn't do anything!

494
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:24,099
I do not want to see him.

495
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,801
I do not want to see him in the house.

496
00:21:25,802 --> 00:21:26,969
But it's cold outside.

497
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,035
Well, he's got fur for that.

498
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,805
We should at least set out a blanket.

499
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:31,574
It's a dog!

500
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:33,808
Ethan?

501
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:37,646
Hey, boy. Good?

502
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:39,582
I'm so sorry.

503
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,016
It's all my fault.

504
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:42,985
Even though I couldn't see him,

505
00:21:42,986 --> 00:21:45,770
I knew Ethan was very sad that night.

506
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:24,560
Hey, boy.

507
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:26,862
Hey.

508
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:29,965
It's cold out there, isn't it?

509
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:32,097
I knew he needed me.

510
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:35,904
And I needed him, too.

511
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:38,311
You're a good boy.

512
00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:41,109
Ready, boy?

513
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,645
Okay. Come here.

514
00:22:42,646 --> 00:22:43,711
Come here.

515
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:44,880
Come on, Bailey.

516
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:46,148
Okay, boy. Ready?

517
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:47,816
Three, two...

518
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:48,848
one!

519
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:49,883
Come on!

520
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:54,322
Yeah, boy.

521
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:55,924
Yeah, boy.

522
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,678
- Oh, come on.
- Let's do it again.

523
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:11,006
- Yes!
- Yeah!

524
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:14,777
Nice throw, Ethan.
Nice throw.

525
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:16,912
Nice play.

526
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:18,847
Great pass, Ethan.

527
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:20,739
Got 'em now. Right on.

528
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,719
You-you get it to him every time.

529
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,920
Yeah, exactly.

530
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:26,221
'Cause every time we run that play...

531
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:28,156
Everybody wanted to walk
next to the alpha male.

532
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,758
Yeah, that's what I mean.

533
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,259
Almost everybody.

534
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,511
'Cause he's right
there every single time.

535
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:32,928
Yep.

536
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:34,755
Ethan, why do you always
have this dog with you?

537
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:35,363
Hmm?

538
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:37,365
What? It's like a girlfriend
replacement or something?

539
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:39,367
- Huh?
- Yeah, good one, Todd.

540
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:41,103
Give a little kiss? Huh?

541
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:42,270
I'm just asking.

542
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:43,371
Excuse me.

543
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:47,743
Oh, I'm sorry, Todd.

544
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:50,078
Did my, uh, girlfriend
replacement just trip you?

545
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,980
Very funny.

546
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,349
- Relax, man. I'm kidding.
- The dog's laughing at you.

547
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,752
- Dogs don't laugh, you moron.
- Bailey, come here.

548
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:59,655
That's funny.

549
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:01,624
- Got everything?
- Yeah.

550
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,225
When Lou dropped that pass at the start,

551
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:05,260
- I thought we were done, man.
- I know!

552
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:06,394
Here.

553
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,289
Bailey, come here.

554
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:13,918
Hey, Dad.

555
00:24:17,774 --> 00:24:20,042
- You hungry?
- I'm starving.

556
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,778
- I got a casserole in the oven.
- Yeah?

557
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:24,312
Africa is home to hundreds

558
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:25,814
of thousands of animals.

559
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:29,417
Some look comical, some...
some forbidding,

560
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:31,687
and some so entrancing that we'd like

561
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:33,188
to reach out and touch them...

562
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:35,891
So, uh, coach made me
starting quarterback today.

563
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,194
That's great, kid.

564
00:24:40,263 --> 00:24:42,230
You gotta come to my next game, Dad.

565
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,332
I'm serious. I'm better now.

566
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,086
It's been a long time.

567
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,786
Okay.

568
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,703
Poor Dad.

569
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:06,822
Wow. Wow!

570
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:08,156
This place is great.

571
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:10,726
Oh, there's so much to smell here.

572
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:12,127
And eat.

573
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:13,395
Oh, it's everywhere.

574
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:16,042
Feed me. Feed me.

575
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:20,888
- You want to go next?
- Mm-hmm.

576
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:31,747
Ethan had a different smell
all of a sudden.

577
00:25:31,748 --> 00:25:34,016
A sweaty smell.

578
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:35,383
Who wants to go on that roller coaster?

579
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:39,387
Hmm. I wonder if that girl
had anything to do with it.

580
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:42,424
Oh! Hey, hey, hey!
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey!

581
00:25:42,425 --> 00:25:43,992
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

582
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:45,059
Sorry. Sorry.

583
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:46,361
That was the dog.
That wasn't me.

584
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:47,462
- Oh.
- I wouldn't do that.

585
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:49,898
Okay, well, maybe

586
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:51,800
you should teach your dog some manners.

587
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,468
I've been trying.
He's, uh... he's not too smart.

588
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:54,397
Really?

589
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:57,239
Wow. Did you hear
what he said about you?

590
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,307
You look pretty smart to me.

591
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,943
Oh, yeah.

592
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:03,211
Such intelligent eyes.

593
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:05,948
My butt itches.

594
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:07,449
What's your name, handsome?

595
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,351
He's, uh... he's Bailey.

596
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:11,386
- Bailey, yeah.
- Bailey.

597
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,789
Now, you seem like
a very good dog, Bailey.

598
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,223
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?

599
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:16,736
- Nice job.
- Oh. Thank you.

600
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:19,394
Nice.

601
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:20,963
Yeah... Oh!

602
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,765
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Keep that away from him.

603
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,867
- Okay, okay, okay.
- You're really good at that.

604
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:26,201
Thanks.

605
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:27,502
- Like, really good.
- Yeah?

606
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,904
I was watching you over there.

607
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:31,106
- Okay.
- Not like that.

608
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:33,108
I mean... Yeah.

609
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,010
See ya.

610
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,946
Hey, uh, if we never speak again,

611
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:39,982
I just want to take back
what I said before

612
00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:41,249
about my dog not being smart.

613
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,385
He's actually really smart.

614
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:45,420
Definitely smarter than me.

615
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:48,791
Now they both had a sweaty smell.

616
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:51,359
You want to, uh... you want
to get a hot dog or something?

617
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,873
Popcorn?

618
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:55,230
Sure.

619
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:57,132
Okay, let's do it.

620
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:58,466
There's some good ones over here.

621
00:26:58,467 --> 00:26:59,902
Hey, Bailey, come here.

622
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:17,552
I wanted to save them,
but I didn't know how.

623
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,860
- Come on.
- We done?

624
00:27:24,861 --> 00:27:27,095
- Oh, that was good.
- Never again.

625
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:29,364
- No! It was fun!
- Thank you.

626
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:30,498
Thank you.

627
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,234
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

628
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:33,401
Uh-oh, Ethan's in trouble.

629
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,602
I'm gonna die.

630
00:27:34,603 --> 00:27:36,839
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

631
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,507
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

632
00:27:39,508 --> 00:27:41,376
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, don't worry, Ethan.

633
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:43,445
- I'll help.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no.

634
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:45,013
Stay back. Stay back.

635
00:27:45,014 --> 00:27:47,149
- Bailey, no, no, no.
- But I'm helping.

636
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,051
Bailey, stop! Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey,

637
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:51,182
Bailey, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Hey. No.

638
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,095
- Okay.
- Yeah.

639
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,931
Thank you.
Thank you both for the ride.

640
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,901
Why did I eat so many meat logs?

641
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:07,870
Yeah, we should do something.

642
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:10,372
Yes, that would be nice.

643
00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:11,874
It was fun.

644
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,475
It was.

645
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:15,510
Except for having
to pay for 28 hot dogs.

646
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,880
Excuse me.

647
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,581
Whoa!

648
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:21,950
- Yeah, you better go. You better go quick.
- Okay.

649
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,618
- Okay. Bye.
- See ya.

650
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,922
From that moment on,

651
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:29,591
the girl was a member of our pack.

652
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:31,226
I liked her.

653
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:33,896
Plus she smelled like biscuits.

654
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:35,597
Go! Go, Bailey!

655
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:37,132
We spent every day together.

656
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:40,002
- That a boy.
- Ready, Bailey?

657
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:42,470
- Yeah. Go, go, go.
- Ready? Okay, here we go.

658
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,940
- Oh! Good boy!
- What a dive.

659
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:46,608
What was that?

660
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:48,343
- Oh! Good boy!
- Swim!

661
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:49,644
Bring it back!

662
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,313
That a boy.

663
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:52,981
- Come here, boy.
- That a boy. That a boy.

664
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,183
- Come on.
- Oh, good boy!

665
00:28:55,184 --> 00:28:57,352
- Good boy. Good boy.
- Yeah, good boy.

666
00:28:57,353 --> 00:28:59,346
- Oh! Whoa!
- Hey!

667
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,280
Watch your head.

668
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:07,362
Good boy.

669
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:08,964
- No, it's not okay.
- No.

670
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:10,132
Besides, I'm going.

671
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:11,666
- Why?
- You don't listen!

672
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,936
Every time I ask you
where something comes from...

673
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:15,703
You tell me!
You tell me where it's going!

674
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:18,140
'Cause I earn it! I earn it! I earn it!

675

to town instead?

00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:22,677
Yeah.

00:30:58,474 --> 00:31:00,175
and we'll never be apart.

721
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:01,509
Wow.

722
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,378
You've got it all planned out, huh?

723
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:05,047
Yes, indeed.

724
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:07,382
♪ In restless walks
she'll prowl the night ♪

725
00:31:07,383 --> 00:31:09,651

727
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:13,355

00:31:13,356 --> 00:31:15,557

Bye!

733
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,609
See you tomorrow.

734
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:29,740
Good boy.

735
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,846
I gotta go.

736
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:40,082
Where are you going?

737
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,182
I'm getting some beer.

738
00:31:41,184 --> 00:31:43,151
All I ask is
for you to lower your voice.

739
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,719
- That's all I...
- Stop, stop. Just stop!

740
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,454
Will you please just keep it down?

741
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:48,390
My parents are upstairs, Jim.
You need to stop.

742
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:49,657
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know, you're right.

743
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:50,858
Fine. I will stop doing it, then.

744
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:52,260
I'll just go!
I'll just leave.

745
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:53,361
Does that sound good to you?

746
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:54,862
- Come on, boy.
- Does it sound good to you?

747
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,364
- Well, I don't know. You tell me.
- Will that be

748
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:57,865
good for you? Will you be
happy then if I just...?

749
00:31:57,866 --> 00:31:59,634
No, just tell me. Just tell me
if you'll be happy.

750
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:01,269
- Stop it. Just go!
- Oh, I'm gonna go!

751
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,604
Fine, I'll go.

752
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,139
Will you just come back inside...

753
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,174
Stop it, Eliz... Shut up! Shut up!

754
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,476
Just come back inside.
I am trying to help you, Jim.

755
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:10,512
You're trying to help me?
You want to help me?

756
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:11,679
You're my wife, Elizabeth.

757
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,415
- You should support me.
- I do support you.

758
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:15,783
- Will you just come back inside...
- Hey. Hey, pal.

759
00:32:15,784 --> 00:32:17,778
Hey.

760
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:21,323
You spying on me?

761
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:22,355
What?

762
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,591
You spying on me?

763
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:24,658
- Leave him alone, Jim.
- Come here.

764
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,861
- Leave him alone.
- No. You got something to say?

765
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,197
- I just got home.
- Come here.

766
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:39,141
- Look at how he looks at me.
- No.

767
00:32:39,142 --> 00:32:40,508
- I am so sick of the way you look at me.
- It's okay, Ethan.

768
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:41,575
- It's okay.
- Just relax. Relax.

769
00:32:41,577 --> 00:32:42,642
- Look at how you look at me.
- What are you doing?

770
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:44,479
- This has nothing to do with him.
- Stay out of it.

771
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,545
- This has nothing...
- You stay out of it!

772
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:46,814
What are you doing?

773
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,250
Easy. Take it easy. Take it easy.

774
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:49,784
- You're right.
- God...

775
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:51,719
You're right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

776
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,821
I'm gonna...

777
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:55,369
Hey!

778
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,694
Don't you ever touch her again!

779
00:32:59,695 --> 00:33:02,479
You hear me?

780
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,933
You gotta go.

781
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,550
Mom, he's gotta go.

782
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:11,885
He can't stay here.

783
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:18,613
Mom, you okay?

784
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:21,416
Yeah. I'm sorry.

785
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:24,370
Sure you got everything?

786
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:32,960
Just let her talk to me.

787
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:34,920
Just get in
the car, Dad. I got it.

788
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:40,277
Yeah.

789
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,505
From that moment on,

790
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:46,374
Ethan was the leader of our pack.

791
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:49,434
When we went home,
things were different.

792
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:53,481
Dad was gone.

793
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:56,951
That cat had been hiding
from me for a while.

794
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,774
And now I got it.

795
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,592
I found him!

796
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:06,628
Okay, sorry.

797
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,664
Geez!

798
00:34:09,665 --> 00:34:12,334
Go! Red 80. Red 80.

799
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:14,536
- Let's go, Ethan!
- Down, set, hut!

800
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:16,671
That's it. Over the top.

801
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:18,322
Good block.

802
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:21,943
First down, Tigers.

803
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:23,645
Pass caught by wide receiver...

804
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:24,912
Way to go, Ethan!

805
00:34:35,858 --> 00:34:37,024
First and ten for the Tigers.

806
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,022
Come on, Tigers!

807
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:39,927
Down, set, hut!

808
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,314
Yeah! Yeah!

809
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:56,978
Touchdown, Tigers!

810
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,516
That was amazing.

811
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,269
Mom.

812
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:05,453
No.

813
00:35:05,454 --> 00:35:07,355
Full scholarship. Four years.

814
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,524
Oh, my gosh! Really?

815
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:12,927
Okay, okay. Come on.

816
00:35:12,928 --> 00:35:14,862
- Really? Oh!
- Yeah.

817
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,764
- Okay, you wait here. Okay, boss dog?
- Okay.

818
00:35:16,765 --> 00:35:18,533
You wait here. I'll get you
something to eat, okay?

819
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:20,902
- I just said okay.
- Good boy.

820
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:30,312
Come on, baby! Let it burn!

821
00:35:30,313 --> 00:35:32,314
Go, go, go, go, go! Yes!

822
00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:34,616
- Ye...
- What? -What?

823
00:35:34,617 --> 00:35:36,784
- Ah, some jokers. -Good job.
- Great game, great game.

824
00:35:36,785 --> 00:35:38,886
- I'm keeping watch.
- Hey, Ethan!

825
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,489
- All clear.
- How you doing?

826
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,933
What?

827
00:35:43,992 --> 00:35:45,092
Uh-oh.

828
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:47,562
What was he doing here?

829
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:50,031
And in one of his bad moods, too.

830
00:35:50,032 --> 00:35:51,399
I could smell it.

831
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,067
Come on, let's go.

832
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,103
- Come on.
- Got his brains from his mom, huh?

833
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:58,873
Yeah, I didn't get
a scholarship, though.

834
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,909
Hey, Dad.

835
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,611
Hey, pal.

836
00:36:03,612 --> 00:36:05,647
What are you, uh...
what are you doing here?

837
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:10,352
Oh. Well, I saw you...
I saw you tonight, Ethan.

838
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:12,019
- You did good.
- You were at the game?

839
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,588
Yeah.

840
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,690
You got a good arm.

841
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:16,824
So everything's going good, huh?

842
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:18,059
- This guy, huh?
- Dad.

843
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,761
- Good game, huh?
- Dad, hey.

844
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:21,496
- We're all excited for the big win, huh?
- Dad.

845
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:22,730
Let's hear it for this guy!

846
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:23,931
You don't have to do this
right now, Dad.

847
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,467
Come on! Come on, huh?

848
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:27,769
Would you stop this?

849
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,505
Hey. All right.

850
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:32,705
Come on, let's go.

851
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:37,078
Want your burger?

852
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,660
For Bailey?

853
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,583
Hey, boss dog.

854
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:43,651
Good boy.

855
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:46,721
So it's not all perfect
in Ethan Land, huh?

856
00:36:46,722 --> 00:36:48,823
Now I know why you're going
to Michigan, man.

857
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:51,393
Get away from that
alchy father of yours.

858
00:36:51,394 --> 00:36:53,795
- You should shut up, Todd.
- Oh, yeah?

859
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:55,129
You-you don't want everyone here knowing

860
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,698
that your father's a drunk?

861
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:58,666
Ethan, I have to catch
my bus. Please.

862
00:36:58,667 --> 00:36:59,934
It's pretty obvious.

863
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:01,803
- Can we go?
- Yeah, we're going soon.

864
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:04,171
Oh, oh, and his girlfriend's
fighting his battles, too.

865
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:06,140
If Michigan State knew the real Ethan...

866
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,843
Whoa!

867
00:37:08,844 --> 00:37:11,146
I told you to shut up, Todd.

868
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:16,518
I don't like that smell.

869
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:17,752
Please get in the car.

870
00:37:17,753 --> 00:37:19,454
Bailey, come on!

871
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:21,826
Bailey, let's go.
Get in the car.

872
00:37:29,932 --> 00:37:30,997
What was that?

873
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,734
Could that be that squirrel?

874
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,040
Perfect.

875
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:42,677
Todd was on our territory.

876
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,546
Oh, I wanted to bite him.

877
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:48,215
But I remembered Ethan
telling me no biting.

878
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:49,984
Then I forgot.

879
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:51,428
Hey!

880
00:37:53,756 --> 00:37:55,457
No, no, no, no, no!

881
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,003
Ethan.

882
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,941
Bailey.

883
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:15,145
Bailey, shut up.

884
00:38:22,618 --> 00:38:23,751
Mom!

885
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:24,886
Mom, Mom, Mom!

886
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,554
Get up, get up, get up.

887
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,523
Quick, quick.
Come on, quick!

888
00:38:30,593 --> 00:38:32,760
- We gotta get out.
- We can't. We can't.

889
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:33,792
Come... the window.

890
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:35,797
- Come here.
- Oh, God.

891
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,101
Fire! Fire!

892
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:42,570
- You gotta jump.
- It's too high.

893
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:43,705
Get your sheets! Get your sheets!

894
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:51,946
- Here. Here.
- I just want to tie these together.

895
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,249
Anyone have a ladder handy?

896
00:38:56,952 --> 00:38:59,186
We gotta help 'em down!

897
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:01,088
- Oh, God.
- It's the only way, okay?

898
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,591
- How many people are in the house?
- Okay.

899
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,026
Check the back of the house.

900
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:12,967
Somebody give me a hand!

901
00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:14,618
- Go, go, go.
- We got you.

902
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,872
Okay, we got you. Got her.

903
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:19,874
- We got you. We got you.
- Okay.

904
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,913
Good boy. Good boy.

905
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:31,085
I'll check around back!

906
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:33,621
I'm here... right behind you.

907
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,056
Okay.

908
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:36,053
No!

909
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:38,259
Oh!

910
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,961
- Come on.
- Is there anything I can do?

911
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:43,230
We gotta help him down.

912
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:44,699
Come on, Ethan.

913
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:48,736
You need to jump, son.

914
00:39:48,737 --> 00:39:50,237
Ethan, jump!

915
00:39:55,911 --> 00:39:57,011
Ethan!

916
00:39:58,213 --> 00:40:00,214
- Okay, can you move?
- My leg!

917
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:02,183
- All right, come on.
- One, two, three.

918
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,588
His leg.

919
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:08,790
My leg.

920
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:10,592
- You're gonna be all right.
- It's okay. You're okay.

921
00:40:10,593 --> 00:40:11,826
It's okay.

922
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:17,965
Somebody hold this dog.

923
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:20,835
Hey, Bailey. Bailey, no.

924
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,103
No.

925
00:40:22,104 --> 00:40:24,038
Go with him. Go with him.

926
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,139
No.

927
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,274
One, two, three.

928
00:40:34,717 --> 00:40:36,851
It's going to be okay, boy.
He'll be back.

929
00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:40,655
Easy.

930
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:54,669
No. Hey, hey.

931
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,770
- Don't! Stop!
- There's the dog.

932
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:56,768
Somebody get the dog.

933
00:40:57,606 --> 00:40:59,324
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

934
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:02,644
What you running from, son?

935
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:05,880
I swear, it... it was an accident. I...

936
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,649
Why don't you tell us what happened?

937
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,983
I-I-I had a firework...

938
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:10,918
I think you should come with us.

939
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:12,741
But don't... please... please just...

940
00:41:14,022 --> 00:41:16,256
It was an accident.

941
00:41:18,193 --> 00:41:20,227
Fran! Fran, come on, come on, come on.

942
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,428
- They're here?
- They're here, they're here.

943
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:23,731
- Okay.
- Be careful, dear.

944
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,966
I'm... I'm being careful.

945
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:26,133
I'm being careful.

946
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:28,235
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie.

947
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,024
- Good to see you.
- Oh!

948
00:41:32,174 --> 00:41:33,775
Oh, look at you.

949
00:41:33,776 --> 00:41:35,242
Here, here, let...

950
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,111
- I-I got it.
- Fran, Fran, Fran, Fran.

951
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:38,831
Stop it. Stop.

952
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:41,048
Good to see you, Ethan.

953
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:42,734
Yeah. You, too.

954
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,022
I've been baking all day.

955
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:50,024
Got your room all set up for you, Ethan.

956
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:52,259
It's so good to have you here.

957
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,062
Ethan never wanted to play anymore.

958
00:41:55,063 --> 00:41:56,263
Oh, Bailey.

959
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,431
I'm so sorry.

960
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,532
Even though he carried

961
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:00,134
a great new stick everywhere he went.

962
00:42:01,336 --> 00:42:02,870
Bailey, come on. Hey!

963
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:04,071
Come here, Bailey.

964
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:05,339
- No, no, no, no, no, Bailey.
- Bailey.

965
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,784
Come on. Come on.

966
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:11,713
I couldn't make him play with me.

967
00:42:11,714 --> 00:42:14,188
All he wanted to do was sleep.

968
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:23,090
I had a lot of free time now,
so I made a new friend.

969
00:42:23,091 --> 00:42:24,491
It was like a small horse.

970
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:26,060
Or a giant dog.

971
00:42:27,062 --> 00:42:29,296
With its own special smell

972
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:32,066
that was so wonderful and disgusting.

973
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:33,968
Oh, I wished I could roll in it.

974
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:42,143
Oh, we had fun.

975
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:44,206
Until we didn't.

976
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:49,450
At least Hannah still came around.

977
00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:50,952
Hey!

978
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:53,855
- Hey.
- Hi, Bailey.

979
00:42:53,856 --> 00:42:56,891
Hi. Hi.

980
00:42:56,892 --> 00:42:58,225
I missed you, too.

981
00:42:58,226 --> 00:43:01,763
Good boy. Good boy.

982
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:03,765
Ah, you're such a good boy.

983
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:05,800
Come on. Come on!

984
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:07,759
- Hey.
- Hey.

985
00:43:09,805 --> 00:43:12,206
You, um... do you want
to go to the pond?

986
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:14,241
I made some sandwiches.

987
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:15,376
Yeah.

988
00:43:15,377 --> 00:43:16,786
I mean...

989
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,280
Yeah, if you want.

990
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:20,915
I just... I thought it'd be nice

991
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:24,490
if we could get out
of the house, get you out.

992
00:43:31,827 --> 00:43:33,828
What?

993
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:35,396
Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try,

994
00:43:35,397 --> 00:43:37,832
but you don't have to...
you don't have to do this.

995
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:39,895
You don't have to help me.

996
00:43:42,304 --> 00:43:43,938
I'm not doing it for you.

997
00:43:43,939 --> 00:43:45,306
I'm doing it for us. I want...

998
00:43:45,307 --> 00:43:47,266
No, you're doing this for me.

999
00:43:49,077 --> 00:43:51,277
You leave for college in three weeks.

1000
00:43:53,348 --> 00:43:55,182
But I'll be back all the time.

1001
00:43:55,183 --> 00:43:57,151
Uh-huh, and I'll be here.

1002
00:43:57,152 --> 00:43:59,042
With that.

1003
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,556
You have to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

1004
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,516
You can't do this for me, Hannah.

1005
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:07,995
I'd do anything for you.

1006
00:44:07,996 --> 00:44:10,402
I don't think we should be with
each other anymore, Hannah.

1007
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:14,437
Whoa.

1008
00:44:18,473 --> 00:44:20,604
We shouldn't be with each other anymore.

1009
00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:24,045
It's not gonna work.

1010
00:44:24,046 --> 00:44:25,454
I'm sorry.

1011
00:44:27,482 --> 00:44:30,129
Why are you doing this?

1012
00:44:46,534 --> 00:44:48,184
Bailey.

1013
00:44:51,874 --> 00:44:53,440
Good boy.

1014
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,641
Yeah.

1015
00:44:54,642 --> 00:44:56,110
You want your ball?

1016
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,578
Okay, here's your ball.

1017
00:44:57,579 --> 00:44:59,213
Go on.

1018
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,201
Bye, Bailey.

1019
00:45:22,437 --> 00:45:24,405
Wait. Wait, no.

1020
00:45:24,406 --> 00:45:26,262
No, stay.

1021
00:45:32,014 --> 00:45:34,148
I really missed Hannah.

1022
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:36,550
Ethan missed her, too.

1023
00:45:36,551 --> 00:45:38,167
I could tell.

1024
00:45:39,387 --> 00:45:42,089
Ethan, I made you a sandwich.

1025
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,657
I'm gonna put it in the backseat, okay?

1026
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,626
- All right, Fran.
- Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey...

1027
00:45:45,627 --> 00:45:47,394
Good boy.

1028
00:45:47,395 --> 00:45:49,463
You're gonna miss me, huh?

1029
00:45:49,464 --> 00:45:51,698
I'm gonna miss you, too.

1030
00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:53,300
Don't look so glum, women.

1031
00:45:53,301 --> 00:45:55,502
It-it's a good agricultural school.

1032
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,138
He's gonna learn everything
he needs to know

1033
00:45:57,139 --> 00:45:58,238
about running this farm.

1034
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,440
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, absolutely. Yes.

1035
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:01,468
All right, go on. Come on.

1036
00:46:02,477 --> 00:46:03,542
Better grab him.

1037
00:46:03,545 --> 00:46:05,446
He's not gonna understand.

1038
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:06,409
Come here.

1039
00:46:06,414 --> 00:46:08,715
- Good boy. Good boy.
- Have you got the dog?

1040
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:10,251
Let's come here.

1041
00:46:10,252 --> 00:46:12,719
- Stay, Bailey, stay.
- Come on, boy.

1042
00:46:14,289 --> 00:46:16,145
Great day, huh?

1043
00:46:18,994 --> 00:46:20,231
He's so grown-up.

1044
00:46:22,664 --> 00:46:24,176
What's he doing?

1045
00:46:26,634 --> 00:46:29,136
Oh!

1046
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:30,337
Oh, my goodness.

1047
00:46:30,338 --> 00:46:32,039
Good boy, Bailey.

1048
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,407
You keep that for me, okay, Bailey?

1049
00:46:33,408 --> 00:46:35,161
- Caught it.
- Yeah.

1050
00:46:36,678 --> 00:46:38,345
Bye, Ethan.

1051
00:46:38,346 --> 00:46:39,746
Drive safe.

1052
00:46:39,747 --> 00:46:42,616
See you, Ethan!

1053
00:46:47,622 --> 00:46:49,390
No, Bailey.

1054
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:50,757
- Stay.
- You got him, honey?

1055
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:52,693
Stay? We're playing fetch.

1056
00:46:52,694 --> 00:46:54,261
Bailey!

1057
00:46:54,262 --> 00:46:57,630
It's been so long since we've played.

1058
00:47:29,497 --> 00:47:30,563
Bailey.

1059
00:47:37,072 --> 00:47:40,474
I like this new version of fetch.

1060
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:42,609
You're crazy, you know that, boss dog?

1061
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:46,528
Maybe not... drive so far next time.

1062
00:47:50,685 --> 00:47:53,366
Take care of things
around here for me, okay, boy?

1063
00:47:54,556 --> 00:47:55,789
I'll be back soon.

1064
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,358
Promise.

1065
00:48:03,098 --> 00:48:04,438
Come on. Go on. Go home.

1066
00:48:12,074 --> 00:48:13,807
Humans are complicated.

1067
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,443
They do things dogs can't understand.

1068
00:48:16,444 --> 00:48:18,403
Like leave.

1069
00:48:20,515 --> 00:48:22,749
Ethan and I were meant to be together.

1070
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,585
But if there was no Ethan,

1071
00:48:24,586 --> 00:48:28,389
what was the point of my being here?

1072
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:32,426
Maybe the point was
not to look for a point.

1073
00:48:32,427 --> 00:48:34,861
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

1074
00:48:36,198 --> 00:48:37,531
Okay.

1075
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:39,400
I'll be right back, Bailey.

1076
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:42,219
Everything moved at a slower pace now.

1077
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:44,471
Which was okay,

1078
00:48:44,472 --> 00:48:47,668
because I never felt
like running anymore.

1079
00:48:49,244 --> 00:48:51,684
I was tired all the time.

1080
00:48:55,217 --> 00:48:57,279
I didn't feel like playing anymore.

1081
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:01,388
Not even with horse-dog.

1082
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:07,161
Hey, Bailey.

1083
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:12,352
Are you okay, boy?

1084
00:49:15,603 --> 00:49:16,840
Bill?

1085
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,805
- Careful. Keep a...
- Okay.

1086
00:49:22,444 --> 00:49:24,678
Okay, let's see what we have here.

1087
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:26,480
His eyes just didn't look right.

1088
00:49:26,481 --> 00:49:28,915
They just, uh... they were...
they were kind of rheumy.

1089
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:30,817
And he... and he was panting,
he was, uh...

1090
00:49:30,818 --> 00:49:32,653
his breathing was labored.

1091
00:49:32,654 --> 00:49:35,522
He's-he's also got
this little lump in his, uh...

1092
00:49:35,523 --> 00:49:37,224
Oh, yeah. Has he been drinking

1093
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:39,193
- a lot of water and peeing?
- No.

1094
00:49:39,194 --> 00:49:41,428
Lethargic, so he... he doesn't
want to go for walks anymore?

1095
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:43,530
I had to carry him into the car.

1096
00:49:43,531 --> 00:49:45,766
What can we do for him, Doctor?
What do you think?

1097
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:48,669
Well, we-we... we could do testing,

1098
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:53,474
but I'm afraid that it would
probably be the same results.

1099
00:49:53,475 --> 00:49:55,742
His... his kidneys are shutting down.

1100
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:56,809
Can we just...

1101
00:49:56,811 --> 00:49:58,812
Everyone was so sad,

1102
00:49:58,813 --> 00:50:01,515
but I was too tired to cheer them up.

1103
00:50:01,516 --> 00:50:03,484
Dr. Joyce, can I, uh...
can I use your phone?

1104
00:50:03,485 --> 00:50:04,851
Yes. Oh, absolutely.

1105
00:50:04,852 --> 00:50:07,621
Doctor, Doctor, uh,
if this was a person...

1106
00:50:07,622 --> 00:50:09,356
If this was a person...
You're the veterinarian...

1107
00:50:09,357 --> 00:50:11,258
If this was a person,
would you say that...

1108
00:50:17,632 --> 00:50:19,533
Uh, hello.

1109
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:21,368
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for Ethan.

1110
00:50:21,369 --> 00:50:23,294
It's his grandpa, Bill.

1111
00:50:24,706 --> 00:50:26,573
Ethan, it's Grandpa.

1112
00:50:26,574 --> 00:50:27,841
Ethan.

1113
00:50:27,842 --> 00:50:30,213
Are you here?

1114
00:50:31,313 --> 00:50:33,306
I can't smell you.

1115
00:50:34,982 --> 00:50:36,817
Where are you?

1116
00:50:42,524 --> 00:50:44,391
Hey, Bailey.

1117
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:48,353
There he was.

1118
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:52,233
I could tell he was still sad.

1119
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:54,801
I didn't want him to be sad.

1120
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,803
Doodle dog.

1121
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,873
Boss dog, huh?

1122
00:50:59,874 --> 00:51:04,651
I knew I was here to
love Ethan and make him happy.

1123
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,583
Oh, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

1124
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:12,746
I didn't want to leave him like this.

1125
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,758
Good boy.

1126
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:19,793
Good boy, Bailey.

1127
00:51:19,794 --> 00:51:21,828
Don't worry.

1128
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,965
He'll just feel a little...
A little prick in his neck,

1129
00:51:24,966 --> 00:51:27,681
and then the pain will go away.

1130
00:51:41,283 --> 00:51:43,016
And then it happened again.

1131
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,051
The mother, the milk,

1132
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:47,554
the tongue, the warmth.

1133
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:48,989
I was back.

1134
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,691
But why?

1135
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:52,459
Where was Ethan?

1136
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,895
Other things were missing, too.

1137
00:51:54,896 --> 00:51:56,763
I didn't have a...

1138
00:51:56,764 --> 00:51:58,380
What? I'm a girl?

1139
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:00,934
Come on, come on!

1140
00:52:00,935 --> 00:52:02,869
Good girl, good girl.

1141
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,070
My man was very serious.

1142
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:05,068
Look.

1143
00:52:05,072 --> 00:52:08,642
- Over. Over. Good girl!
- We worked hard.

1144
00:52:08,643 --> 00:52:12,413
Even when we played,
he made it feel like work.

1145
00:52:12,414 --> 00:52:14,014
Easy, easy. Down, down.

1146
00:52:14,015 --> 00:52:16,617

00:52:22,824 --> 00:52:24,458
Wally was a disaster,

1150
00:52:24,459 --> 00:52:26,627
always losing pieces of clothing.

1151
00:52:26,628 --> 00:52:27,861

Good job. Okay.

1154
00:52:33,535 --> 00:52:34,968
Okay.

1157
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:43,910
So this is my purpose?

1158
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,946
It's not about fun.

1159
00:52:45,947 --> 00:52:48,415
- It's not about Ethan.
- Come on. Good girl.

1160
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:51,918
My job is to seek, find...

1161
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,501
...and show.

1162
00:52:57,792 --> 00:52:59,960
Good job. Good job.

1163
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:03,897
But even when I did a good job,

1164
00:53:03,898 --> 00:53:06,099
my man was still sad.

1165
00:53:09,837 --> 00:53:11,672
He was lonely.

1166
00:53:11,673 --> 00:53:13,940
I could smell someone else
used to live here,

1167
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,876
but their scent was faint.

1168
00:53:15,877 --> 00:53:18,042
They hadn't been around in a long time.

1169
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:21,548
That's when I realized

1170
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:24,117
being alone might be the worst thing

1171
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,986
that could happen to you.

1172
00:53:29,156 --> 00:53:32,456
I knew how it felt to miss someone.

1173
00:53:33,695 --> 00:53:35,757
Did he miss someone, too?

1174
00:53:44,406 --> 00:53:45,939
Stop that.

1175
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,141
Hey.

1176
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,843
What?

1177
00:53:49,844 --> 00:53:52,421
Dog bed... now.

1178
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:56,683
Ellie...

1179
00:53:56,684 --> 00:53:59,503
Dog bed... now.

1180
00:54:02,557 --> 00:54:05,091
Why did I listen to him?

1181
00:54:05,092 --> 00:54:07,193
I didn't want to go.

1182
00:54:07,194 --> 00:54:10,803
And I could tell he didn't
want me to go, either.

1183
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:15,836
Oh, gosh.

1184
00:54:17,905 --> 00:54:19,933
Would you give me a break?

1185
00:54:31,953 --> 00:54:33,912
No whining.

1186
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:47,968
Gun.

1187
00:54:49,236 --> 00:54:52,038
Gun had a smell that stung my nose.

1188
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,774
Steady.

1189
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:55,709
Stay.

1190
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,911
Relax.

1191
00:54:57,912 --> 00:55:00,043
Get used to it.

1192
00:55:01,649 --> 00:55:03,849
Stay strong.

1193
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:10,537
Good girl.

1194
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,748
Yes?

1195
00:55:27,509 --> 00:55:28,814
What?

1196
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:38,973
I could do that, too.

1197
00:55:49,296 --> 00:55:51,998
You know, I don't see why not.

1198
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:54,886
Come on. Come on.

1199
00:56:05,647 --> 00:56:08,549
That's the sweater that
she was wearing yesterday.

1200
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,016
- Okay, ma'am.
- Today, she had on...

1201
00:56:10,017 --> 00:56:11,585
...blue jeans and a blue jacket.

1202
00:56:11,586 --> 00:56:13,019
Do you remember what time it was...

1203
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,655
We got called here on a domestic.

1204
00:56:14,656 --> 00:56:16,890
By the time we got here,
it was kidnapping.

1205
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:18,158
Ex-boyfriend, armed.

1206
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:20,160
Took the 12-year-old girl.

1207
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:21,260
What is this?

1208
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:23,229
This is the last item
of clothing she was wearing.

1209
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,330
Okay.

1210
00:56:24,331 --> 00:56:26,256
Come on. Come on.

1211
00:56:34,909 --> 00:56:36,810
Got a partial plate called in

1212
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:39,580
on a blue Toyota heading East
toward the reservoir.

1213
00:56:39,581 --> 00:56:41,648
Copy that. We're on our way.

1214
00:56:45,052 --> 00:56:47,888
Ellie. Ellie.

1215
00:56:47,889 --> 00:56:48,988
Find.

1216
00:56:50,592 --> 00:56:51,825
Find, Ellie.

1217
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:54,360
Good girl. Good find.

1218
00:56:54,361 --> 00:56:56,863
Pretzel. Pizza. Hot dog.

1219
00:56:56,864 --> 00:56:58,965
Rubber. Train. Cab.

1220
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:01,267
Coffee. Sweater. Girl?
Sweater girl!

1221
00:57:01,268 --> 00:57:03,090
Girl! Girl!

1222
00:57:13,948 --> 00:57:16,079
Come on.

1223
00:57:27,228 --> 00:57:29,152
Come on. Come on.

1224
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:35,401
That a girl.

1225
00:57:35,402 --> 00:57:36,903
Get him! Get him!

1226
00:57:36,904 --> 00:57:38,304
Halt!

1227
00:57:38,305 --> 00:57:39,973
Police!

1228
00:57:39,974 --> 00:57:41,307
Halt!

1229
00:57:41,308 --> 00:57:43,343
Get him, girl. Get him!

1230
00:57:43,344 --> 00:57:45,311
Get him, Ellie!

1231
00:57:45,312 --> 00:57:46,847
I said halt!

1232
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:50,350
Slowly!

1233
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:51,852
Let her go!

1234
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,676
Hold it! Hold it!

1235
00:58:15,677 --> 00:58:17,773
Stop!

1236
00:58:21,148 --> 00:58:22,317
Hey!

1237
00:58:33,194 --> 00:58:34,431
Halt!

1238
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:07,360
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, there she is.

1239
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:09,495
- Hey, hey.
- We've got you. We've got you.

1240
00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:11,971
- Good girl. Good girl.
- There you go.

1241
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,444
Release!

1242
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:54,507
All right, we got him. We got him.

1243
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:55,976
- Get up.
- Let's go.

1244
00:59:55,977 --> 00:59:57,410
Come on, get up!

1245
00:59:57,411 --> 00:59:59,267
Come on.

1246
01:00:03,818 --> 01:00:06,787
This is canine unit K-27.

1247
01:00:06,788 --> 01:00:09,222
I'm gonna need immediate...

1248
01:00:09,223 --> 01:00:11,224
assistance.

1249
01:00:11,225 --> 01:00:12,959
My dog's been shot.

1250
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,016
I repeat, canine shot.

1251
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:22,102
I always hated getting shots.

1252
01:00:22,103 --> 01:00:25,038
This was definitely
the worst shot I ever got.

1253
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,539
Ellie.

1254
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,308
You're gonna be okay.

1255
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:32,209
You're gonna be okay.

1256
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,383
You're a good dog.

1257
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,920
I could tell from Carlos's voice

1258
01:00:39,921 --> 01:00:42,051
I'd done a good job.

1259
01:00:44,959 --> 01:00:47,193
You're a good dog.

1260
01:00:55,469 --> 01:00:57,875
I need to rest.

1261
01:00:59,106 --> 01:01:01,241
Can I just sleep in your bed?

1262
01:01:14,856 --> 01:01:16,848
That was a different life.

1263
01:01:18,025 --> 01:01:20,019
Not so much fun, really.

1264
01:01:21,328 --> 01:01:24,865
But I did good work.

1265
01:01:24,866 --> 01:01:26,446
Here we go.

1266
01:01:28,569 --> 01:01:30,536
Now I'm tiny and all ears.

1267
01:01:30,537 --> 01:01:32,238
Aw!

1268
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:34,107
Hi, you.

1269
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:36,009
Are you the cutest little puppy
in the world?

1270
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:37,643
She smelled good,

1271
01:01:37,644 --> 01:01:39,279
like sunshine and pretzels.

1272
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,081
I think you are.

1273
01:01:41,082 --> 01:01:44,184
Oh, yeah. You want to come
home with me, huh?

1274
01:01:47,021 --> 01:01:48,388
Okay, you gotta come home with me.

1275
01:01:48,389 --> 01:01:50,090

Come on. Come on, let's go.

1294
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:35,101
Everywhere she went,
Maya brought me along.

1295
01:02:35,102 --> 01:02:36,702
Which was great.

1296
01:02:36,703 --> 01:02:38,371
According to the American philosopher

1297
01:02:38,372 --> 01:02:39,940
Charles Sanders Peirce,

1298
01:02:39,941 --> 01:02:41,541
human beings think only in signs.

1299
01:02:41,542 --> 01:02:43,443
She always brought me something to eat.

1300
01:02:43,444 --> 01:02:45,711
I almost forgot what it
was like to be hungry.

1301
01:02:45,712 --> 01:02:47,580

Hi.

1305
01:02:53,087 --> 01:02:55,055
- Cute dog.
- Uh-huh. Thanks.

1306
01:02:55,056 --> 01:02:57,991
Um, listen, uh, a few of us

1307
01:02:57,992 --> 01:02:59,625
are putting together a study group.

1308
01:02:59,626 --> 01:03:01,194
We're meeting at
the Woodford common room.

1309
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:03,296
We'd love for you to join us.

1310
01:03:03,297 --> 01:03:07,733
Um, I would, but I have plans, so...

1311
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:11,437
Oh... oh, but I didn't say
when we was meeting.

1312
01:03:11,438 --> 01:03:13,073
No.

1313
01:03:13,074 --> 01:03:14,540
No, I just... I'm busy. I...

1314
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,342
Like, I know I'm gonna
be busy and, like...

1315
01:03:16,343 --> 01:03:17,610
I got my dog, so I gotta...

1316
01:03:17,611 --> 01:03:19,279
- Oh.
- Thank you. I gotta go.

1317
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,147
I'm sorry. I have to take
my dog out, so...

1318
01:03:21,148 --> 01:03:22,482
- Okay.
- But thank you.

1319
01:03:22,483 --> 01:03:24,184
Okay.

1320
01:03:24,185 --> 01:03:26,119
- Maybe next time.
- Uh, yeah.

1321
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,154
I don't know what's wrong with me, Tino.

1322
01:03:28,155 --> 01:03:31,591
Like, yeah, maybe it would be
nice to meet people, but...

1323
01:03:31,592 --> 01:03:33,759
no, also I should just
study alone 'cause...

1324
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,428
Slow down. Slow down.

1325
01:03:35,429 --> 01:03:37,297
My legs are barely even legs.

1326
01:03:37,298 --> 01:03:39,065
Ugh! I feel like such an idiot.

1327
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:40,633
I learned quickly that even though Maya

1328
01:03:40,634 --> 01:03:44,137
talked all the time,
she was a lot like Carlos.

1329
01:03:44,138 --> 01:03:46,272
There was no one else in our pack.

1330
01:03:46,273 --> 01:03:48,341
Just Maya and me.

1331
01:03:48,342 --> 01:03:50,576
But I'm starting to get her.

1332
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,612
Actually, I can read her mind.

1333
01:03:52,613 --> 01:03:54,580
You know what I'm thinking?

1334
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:57,283
- Chips.
- Chips.

1335
01:04:01,322 --> 01:04:02,788
You know what I'm thinking?

1336
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:05,658
- Pizza.
- Pizza.

1337
01:04:06,793 --> 01:04:08,428
Please. Pizza.

1338
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:09,629
- Hey, Chris.
- Hi.

1339
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:10,796
Here you go.

1340
01:04:10,797 --> 01:04:12,698
Thank you. Bye.

1341
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:15,036
- You ready?
- I am ready.

1342
01:04:17,238 --> 01:04:18,371
You know what I'm thinking?

1343
01:04:18,372 --> 01:04:19,572
Ice cream.

1344
01:04:19,573 --> 01:04:21,441
It's ridiculous, but sometimes

1345
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:23,676
I actually think
you know what I'm thinking.

1346
01:04:23,677 --> 01:04:25,545
Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream.

1347
01:04:25,546 --> 01:04:27,813
Ugh. Do you know, I'm spending
way too much time alone.

1348
01:04:27,814 --> 01:04:29,549
You want to go get some ice cream?

1349
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:31,406
You read my mind.

1350
01:04:34,255 --> 01:04:36,454
I think this is it, Tino.

1351
01:04:38,225 --> 01:04:40,390
I think it's just gonna be you and me.

1352
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:44,430
I-I don't know.
It's fine, right?

1353
01:04:44,431 --> 01:04:48,068
Because I love you
and you love me, and...

1354
01:04:48,069 --> 01:04:50,165
love is all that matters.

1355
01:04:51,438 --> 01:04:52,672
It's not like it matters

1356
01:04:52,673 --> 01:04:55,308
where you get your love.

1357
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:57,677
As long as something loves you, right?

1358
01:04:57,678 --> 01:04:59,245
Can I have some more?

1359
01:05:04,085 --> 01:05:05,785
Oh, you're so sweet.

1360
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:10,523
You're so cute.

1361
01:05:10,524 --> 01:05:13,193
Hi. I love you.

1362
01:05:13,194 --> 01:05:16,162
Why can't you be my boyfriend, huh?

1363
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:19,599
Why can't you give me more ice cream?

1364
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,767
Okay, one more to go.

1365
01:05:21,768 --> 01:05:23,169
What's with these white-coat people

1366
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:24,637
sticking me with sharp things?

1367
01:05:24,638 --> 01:05:27,207
Now, do you feed him at regular times?

1368
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:29,109
Pretty regular. Mm-hmm.

1369
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:30,510
What do you give him?

1370
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:31,744
Food.

1371
01:05:31,745 --> 01:05:33,613
Dog food. What?

1372
01:05:33,614 --> 01:05:36,149
Maybe give him more exercise.

1373
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:37,417
Go on more walks.

1374
01:05:37,418 --> 01:05:38,751
Sure.

1375
01:05:38,752 --> 01:05:41,221
Shots. I hate those shots.

1376
01:05:41,222 --> 01:05:42,855
Okay, Tino.

1377
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,190
Let's do this, huh?

1378
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,691
Doctor's orders. Come here.

1379
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,793
All right, get the ball.

1380
01:05:47,794 --> 01:05:50,363
A long walk, and now
I have to chase a ball?

1381
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:51,864
Get the ball. Come on.

1382
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,134
Why was I being punished like this?

1383
01:05:54,135 --> 01:05:55,335
Tino, come on.
You're a dog.

1384
01:05:55,336 --> 01:05:56,536
Get... Chase the ball. Chase it.

1385
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:58,496

- Lucky.

1386
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:01,174

Maya was talking, but I didn't listen.

1416
01:07:01,335 --> 01:07:02,868
All I could think of was her.

1417
01:07:02,869 --> 01:07:04,537
It's cool. I... No, I, understand.

1418
01:07:04,538 --> 01:07:06,639

acting crazy around your dog.

01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,911
We smell great together.

1421
01:07:17,418 --> 01:07:20,520
We started seeing Roxy all the time.

1422
01:07:20,521 --> 01:07:23,442
For some reason, Al always came, too.

1423
01:07:24,658 --> 01:07:26,426
It wasn't long before...

1424
01:07:26,427 --> 01:07:28,213
we slept together.

1425
01:07:33,234 --> 01:07:35,735
I'm really starting to get it now.

1426
01:07:35,736 --> 01:07:39,035
If there's a point, Roxy is the point.

Wait. What's going on?

01:07:43,877 --> 01:07:46,812

There's been something on my mind

1430
01:07:48,915 --> 01:07:51,451
that I've been wanting
to talk to you about.

1431
01:07:51,452 --> 01:07:53,619
Oh, I recognize that sweaty smell.

1432
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,988
We've been together for a while now.

1433
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:58,361
And, um...

1434
01:08:02,896 --> 01:08:05,365
Maya, I want you to be my wife.

1435
01:08:05,366 --> 01:08:07,433
- Al! Oh, my God!
- Something's wrong here.

1436
01:08:07,434 --> 01:08:08,634
- Yes!
- Maya's in trouble.

1437
01:08:08,635 --> 01:08:10,570
Yes! Yay! Come here!

1438
01:08:10,571 --> 01:08:13,306
- Oh, honey, yes!
- Yeah.

1439
01:08:13,307 --> 01:08:14,840
There is danger.
Get behind me, Roxy.

1440
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,576
I'll protect us all!

1441
01:08:16,577 --> 01:08:18,043
Whoa!

1442
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:19,545
Oh! Al!

1443
01:08:19,546 --> 01:08:21,414
Okay. I got Tino.
I got Tino. I got Tino.

1444
01:08:21,415 --> 01:08:22,915
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on!

1445
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:24,584
- Aah!
- Oh!

1446
01:08:24,585 --> 01:08:27,353
No, Roxy. Stop it!

1447
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:29,855
Okay. Mom, hold the... hold these.

1448
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:31,891
Okay, come here. Come here.
Come on. Come here.

1449
01:08:31,892 --> 01:08:33,626
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, uh, I think we're ready.

1450
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:35,961
- Okay, let's do this. Okay, perfect.
- Yes!

1451
01:08:35,962 --> 01:08:37,697
- Okay.
- Okay. Ready.

1452
01:08:40,066 --> 01:08:41,701
You're jealous because
Fallon's had her baby,

1453
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:43,703
and that's made you even more paranoid.

1454
01:08:43,704 --> 01:08:45,738
Hmm. Okay, Alexis gonna
get her butt whupped

1455
01:08:45,739 --> 01:08:47,190
she keep running off
the mouth like that.

1456
01:08:47,192 --> 01:08:47,673
Right?

1457
01:08:47,674 --> 01:08:49,450
'Cause Krystle's not gonna
take much more of this.

1458
01:08:49,452 --> 01:08:50,042
Uh-uh.

1459
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:52,478
- I haven't.
- This is crazy.

1460
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:53,813
- Ooh!
- I told you. I told you.

1461
01:08:53,814 --> 01:08:55,348
Oh, my gosh.

1462
01:08:55,349 --> 01:08:57,049
- What?
- Oh, get her, Krystle.

1463
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,084
- Mmm!
- Oh, my gosh.

1464
01:08:59,085 --> 01:09:02,355
What's all that noise in her stomach?

1465
01:09:02,356 --> 01:09:05,325
Was it something she ate?

1466
01:09:05,326 --> 01:09:08,328
Yo, they trying to kill each other.

1467
01:09:08,329 --> 01:09:10,012
- Oh!
- What?

1468
01:09:11,097 --> 01:09:13,433
Oh, no.

1469
01:09:13,434 --> 01:09:16,469
- It was a baby.
- Is she breathing?

1470
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:17,703
You gotta relax, honey.

1471
01:09:17,704 --> 01:09:19,372
She's breathing, okay?

1472
01:09:19,373 --> 01:09:21,474
Uh, maybe we should
wake her up just to be sure.

1473
01:09:21,475 --> 01:09:24,076
I didn't understand why they got a baby.

1474
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,945
It took all their attention.

1475
01:09:25,946 --> 01:09:28,514
Good thing Roxy and I already
had everything we needed.

1476
01:09:28,515 --> 01:09:31,451
Each other.

1477
01:09:31,452 --> 01:09:32,785
Hey, baby.

1478
01:09:32,786 --> 01:09:34,687
Then they went and got more babies.

1479
01:09:34,688 --> 01:09:37,423
Seemed like a mistake to me.

1480
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:39,825
Soon, I had to live my life on the run.

1481
01:09:39,826 --> 01:09:41,494
Found him!

1482
01:09:42,629 --> 01:09:46,832
There was no escape.

1483
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:50,436
I let them do what they wanted to me.

1484
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:54,607
I'd do anything
so that Roxy could be safe.

1485
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:58,944
That was my mission,
to protect her at all times.

1486
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:04,884
I guess, if I was really honest,

1487
01:10:04,885 --> 01:10:06,419
I liked all the attention.

1488
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:11,891
Boo!

1489
01:10:15,529 --> 01:10:19,399
As Roxy and I got older,
our connection grew stronger.

1490
01:10:21,535 --> 01:10:24,570
And she never lost the spark

1491
01:10:24,571 --> 01:10:26,942
that drew me to her in the first place.

1492
01:10:28,074 --> 01:10:31,477
One day, Roxy went to the vet.

1493
01:10:32,679 --> 01:10:34,673
And she never came back.

1494
01:10:38,919 --> 01:10:40,553
- Look at me! Look at me!
- Oh!

1495
01:10:40,554 --> 01:10:42,522
Everyone was good to me.

1496
01:10:42,523 --> 01:10:47,427
But as the years went by, I missed Roxy.

1497
01:10:47,428 --> 01:10:50,039
It just wasn't the same without her.

1498
01:11:01,775 --> 01:11:03,424
Hey, Tino.

1499
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:13,152
Hey, Tino.

1500
01:11:13,153 --> 01:11:15,521
You know what I'm thinking?

1501
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:16,722
Yes.

1502
01:11:16,723 --> 01:11:18,591
I know what you're thinking.

1503
01:11:18,592 --> 01:11:20,192
Pizza.

1504
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,015
Ugh.

1505
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,905
No?

1506
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,633
No pizza?

1507
01:11:27,634 --> 01:11:29,902
I'm not hungry.

1508
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,751
Okay.

1509
01:11:34,841 --> 01:11:37,810
Tino...

1510
01:11:37,811 --> 01:11:41,481
what are you thinking?

1511
01:11:41,482 --> 01:11:43,062
Hmm?

1512
01:11:48,254 --> 01:11:50,695
What are you thinking?

1513
01:11:53,794 --> 01:11:55,695
Tino, what are you thinking?

1514
01:11:55,696 --> 01:11:58,063
I'm thinking I'm ready.

1515
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,700
One of my best lives, really.

1516
01:12:13,814 --> 01:12:15,515
I'm back.

1517
01:12:15,516 --> 01:12:16,816
Again.

1518
01:12:16,817 --> 01:12:18,707
But why?

1519
01:12:22,589 --> 01:12:24,957
- Puppies! -Want a puppy?
- Hey there, little fella.

1520
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:27,192
- Puppies for sale!
- Want to buy one?

1521
01:12:27,193 --> 01:12:29,228
Who wants a puppy?

1522
01:12:29,229 --> 01:12:30,830
Hi!

1523
01:12:30,831 --> 01:12:32,932
Oh!

1524
01:12:32,933 --> 01:12:35,134
Here we go again.

1525
01:12:35,135 --> 01:12:36,969
Look what I got. Huh?

1526
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:38,170
Yeah, I am looking.

1527
01:12:38,171 --> 01:12:39,539
Look how cute he is.

1528
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:40,740
You know, it's-it's crazy.

1529
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:42,542
Who's gonna take care of him?

1530
01:12:42,543 --> 01:12:44,176
I will.

1531
01:12:44,177 --> 01:12:45,978
Come on. I named him Waffles.

1532
01:12:45,979 --> 01:12:48,213
Not inside.

1533
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:08,145
Come on.

1534
01:13:12,038 --> 01:13:15,007
I kept telling her you were
going to get bigger.

1535
01:13:15,008 --> 01:13:17,242
Not so into you now, is she?

1536
01:13:18,612 --> 01:13:20,746
I never went anywhere.

1537
01:13:20,747 --> 01:13:23,348
I never played.

1538
01:13:23,349 --> 01:13:26,351
It was like the days
went on and on without me.

1539
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:29,722
You have 30 days to deal with this.

1540
01:13:29,723 --> 01:13:31,256
When the officer came,

1541
01:13:31,257 --> 01:13:33,926
I thought it was to take me
to do find-and-show.

1542
01:13:33,927 --> 01:13:35,961
But she left without me.

1543
01:13:35,962 --> 01:13:37,229
He's dirty.
We're getting rid of him.

1544
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:39,699
We are not going to get rid of that dog.

1545
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,966
That's enough!
We're getting rid of him.

1546
01:13:40,967 --> 01:13:44,095
I took him in here, and
we're gonna take care of him.

1547
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,248
You'll make sure he finds
a nice home, right?

1548
01:13:56,249 --> 01:13:58,383
Somebody responsible?

1549
01:13:58,384 --> 01:14:00,103
Yeah.

1550
01:14:09,763 --> 01:14:10,760
Come on. Out.

1551
01:14:10,764 --> 01:14:12,131
Move it.

1552
01:14:12,132 --> 01:14:13,966
Let's go. Come on.

1553
01:14:13,967 --> 01:14:15,635
Move.

1554
01:14:22,275 --> 01:14:24,268
So long, doggie.

1555
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,722
Now I'm supposed to walk home?

1556
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:38,958
That didn't seem very fair.

1557
01:14:38,959 --> 01:14:41,927
But when I thought about it,

1558
01:14:41,928 --> 01:14:45,159
I didn't want to go back to that home.

1559
01:14:51,672 --> 01:14:54,373
Come on. Over here.

1560
01:14:54,374 --> 01:14:56,175
Look, Mom.

1561
01:14:56,176 --> 01:14:58,077
That looks like fun.

1562
01:14:58,078 --> 01:15:00,279
Sit. Sit. You like that?

1563
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,448
It's been so long since I've had fun.

1564
01:15:03,449 --> 01:15:05,408
Where is she going?

1565
01:15:09,389 --> 01:15:11,223
Do I know you?

1566
01:15:11,224 --> 01:15:14,093
There's something about you.

1567
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:16,896
It's... your smell.

1568
01:15:16,897 --> 01:15:18,097
Aw.

1569
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:19,932
You're a scruffy one.

1570
01:15:19,933 --> 01:15:21,333
Are you lost?

1571
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:23,869
Where are you from?

1572
01:15:25,038 --> 01:15:26,806
You got a collar?

1573
01:15:26,807 --> 01:15:29,474
I know that smell.

1574
01:15:29,475 --> 01:15:31,777
Don't be afraid.

1575
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:35,249
It's... from a long time ago.

1576
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:09,381
Had I been here before?

1577
01:16:09,382 --> 01:16:12,922
I was so happy to leave the town behind.

1578
01:16:15,021 --> 01:16:20,392
My nose was full of fresh new smells.

1579
01:16:20,393 --> 01:16:24,129
And then there are the smells
you never forget.

1580
01:16:25,298 --> 01:16:27,499
Train. Moss.

1581
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,435
Trees. Horse. Garbage.

1582
01:16:30,436 --> 01:16:31,777
It was horse-dog!

1583
01:16:59,265 --> 01:17:01,293
Could it be the same?

1584
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:05,137
Ah, it was the same.

1585
01:17:05,138 --> 01:17:08,140
Could it mean Ethan was here, too?

1586
01:17:08,141 --> 01:17:11,576
That ought to cover us
to the end of the month.

1587
01:17:11,577 --> 01:17:13,913
Ethan?

1588
01:17:13,914 --> 01:17:15,881
That can't be him.

1589
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:18,350
Tell Fred that I will be in town...

1590
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:19,484
Is that him?

1591
01:17:19,485 --> 01:17:20,820
...tomorrow to settle up, okay?

1592
01:17:20,821 --> 01:17:21,817
Will do.

1593
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,523
It is him!

1594
01:17:24,524 --> 01:17:26,291
It's him! Yes!

1595
01:17:26,292 --> 01:17:28,148
Yes, it's him!

1596
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:33,532
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1597
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:34,867
It's me!

1598
01:17:34,868 --> 01:17:36,969
Boss dog! Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

1599
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:38,337
- Doodle dog!
- Hey!

1600
01:17:38,338 --> 01:17:40,272
Where'd you come from?

1601
01:17:40,273 --> 01:17:43,843
After all these lives,
I'd actually found him.

1602
01:17:43,844 --> 01:17:45,493
I found Ethan.

1603
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:50,045
I'm gonna make a bet you're hungry.

1604
01:17:51,484 --> 01:17:53,085
Here you go.

1605
01:17:55,989 --> 01:17:57,489
Wow.

1606
01:17:57,490 --> 01:17:58,958
You must be.

1607
01:17:58,959 --> 01:18:00,573
Nobody likes my cooking.

1608
01:18:10,036 --> 01:18:13,026
Don't look at me like that.

1609
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,208
You can't stay here.

1610
01:18:16,209 --> 01:18:17,376
You gotta go home.

1611
01:18:17,377 --> 01:18:19,078
You belong to somebody.

1612
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:20,445
Home. Yes.

1613
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:21,947
Yes, I'm home.

1614
01:18:23,016 --> 01:18:24,941
Go home, dog.

1615
01:18:29,389 --> 01:18:31,073
Go home.

1616
01:18:45,972 --> 01:18:49,031
You're a stubborn one, aren't you?

1617
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:56,248
Then, Tuesday night,

1618
01:18:56,249 --> 01:18:58,483
we got three tenths of an inch of rain.

1619
01:19:10,363 --> 01:19:12,364
Be sure he gets a good home.

1620
01:19:12,365 --> 01:19:14,199
He's a good dog.

1621
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,700
Sure.

1622
01:19:15,701 --> 01:19:18,437
No. No, don't leave me here.

1623
01:19:18,438 --> 01:19:20,973
This is a white-coat place.

1624
01:19:20,974 --> 01:19:22,074
I belong with you.

1625
01:19:24,577 --> 01:19:27,012
So long, dog.

1626
01:20:13,626 --> 01:20:15,327
You want to get out of here?

1627
01:20:18,198 --> 01:20:20,065
Do you want to go?

1628
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:21,266
Come on, let's go.

1629
01:20:22,702 --> 01:20:26,005
I was back in the front seat.

1630
01:20:26,006 --> 01:20:28,207
Okay, buddy.

1631
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:30,064
Guess it's gonna be you and me.

1632
01:20:31,144 --> 01:20:33,045
And the donkey.

1633
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:35,280
What's a donkey?

1634
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:40,252
Now, when was the last time
you got a bath?

1635
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:41,786
That's a good boy.

1636
01:20:41,787 --> 01:20:43,255
Yeah.

1637
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:45,290
There you go.
All right.

1638
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:47,319
Just step out. Out. Let's go!

1639
01:20:49,062 --> 01:20:50,127
There you go.

1640
01:20:58,304 --> 01:21:00,539
You're getting a new collar.

1641
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,707
Yeah!

1642
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:04,409
Doesn't look like he's missed
too many meals.

1643
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:06,478
- He's in good shape.
- Yeah, he's a good boy.

1644
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:08,747
Aren't you, huh?

1645
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:16,555
But Ethan still seemed sad.

1646
01:21:16,556 --> 01:21:20,159
Maybe it was because he slept alone.

1647
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:24,796
I wanted to help him,
but I didn't know how.

1648
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,532
Wait. Wait.

1649
01:21:27,533 --> 01:21:29,561
Hold that thought.

1650
01:21:32,605 --> 01:21:35,107
Okay, Bailey, let's do this.

1651
01:21:35,108 --> 01:21:36,241
Hurry.

1652
01:21:36,242 --> 01:21:38,177
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

1653
01:21:38,178 --> 01:21:39,711
This is the place.

1654
01:21:39,712 --> 01:21:42,496
I'm looking for...

1655
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:47,352
Come on, Carly. Come here, girl.

1656
01:21:47,353 --> 01:21:49,288
- Come on, Carly.
- Come on, Carly.

1657
01:21:49,289 --> 01:21:51,423
Come here, Carly.

1658
01:21:51,424 --> 01:21:53,092
Can you get the gate for me?

1659
01:21:53,093 --> 01:21:55,760
- Yes, Mommy.
- Thank you.

1660
01:21:55,761 --> 01:21:58,236
Good girl.

1661
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:06,433
Oh, sorry.

1662
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,441
Rach.

1663
01:22:09,442 --> 01:22:12,211
Oh, hey. Look, Will.

1664
01:22:12,212 --> 01:22:13,645
- Grandma's here.
- Hi, Grandma.

1665
01:22:13,646 --> 01:22:15,347
There's that smell again.

1666
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:17,249
- How are you feeling?
- I'm pretty good.

1667
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,783
This is a surprise.

1668
01:22:18,784 --> 01:22:21,720
It's stronger now.

1669
01:22:21,721 --> 01:22:23,288
I thought I'd bring you some groceries.

1670
01:22:23,289 --> 01:22:25,324
- It's Hannah!
- Aw. Hmm, thanks.

1671
01:22:25,325 --> 01:22:27,326
You're still here?

1672
01:22:27,327 --> 01:22:28,760
Oh, you look different.

1673
01:22:28,761 --> 01:22:31,363
But you still smell like biscuits.

1674
01:22:35,268 --> 01:22:37,669
Who is this?

1675
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:40,694
It's the, uh, stray from the park.

1676
01:22:41,807 --> 01:22:43,492
A stray? Really?

1677
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:48,347
Well, hello there.

1678
01:22:48,348 --> 01:22:51,316
What a good dog.

1679
01:22:51,317 --> 01:22:52,584
Well, he's certainly not a stray,

1680
01:22:52,585 --> 01:22:53,818
'cause he's got a collar.

1681
01:22:53,819 --> 01:22:54,816
Let's see.

1682
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:58,190
His name is Buddy.

1683
01:22:58,191 --> 01:23:00,562
Let's see. He belongs to...

1684
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,361
Come on, Ethan.

1685
01:24:09,362 --> 01:24:11,763
I can smell you in there.

1686
01:24:11,764 --> 01:24:15,300
I don't want to leave you here.

1687
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:17,236
But I guess he's not home.

1688
01:24:35,755 --> 01:24:38,298
Hi, Ethan.

1689
01:24:39,759 --> 01:24:41,793
Hi, Hannah.

1690
01:24:45,265 --> 01:24:47,773
I brought your dog home.

1691
01:24:56,376 --> 01:24:58,477
Must have been tough on you,

1692
01:24:58,478 --> 01:25:00,845
losing your husband
after all those years.

1693
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:03,882
Yeah, it made me miss my daughter a lot.

1694
01:25:05,351 --> 01:25:06,918
And then, with the new baby coming,

1695
01:25:06,919 --> 01:25:10,922
I thought Rachel and Miguel
could really use the help.

1696
01:25:10,923 --> 01:25:12,857
Yeah.

1697
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:15,360
How long you get to stay for?

1698
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:18,763
Uh, well, I'm...
I'm not visiting, Ethan.

1699
01:25:18,764 --> 01:25:21,600
I moved back about a month ago.

1700
01:25:21,601 --> 01:25:23,768
Y-You did?

1701
01:25:23,769 --> 01:25:26,070
Welcome home.

1702
01:25:26,071 --> 01:25:27,790
Thanks.

1703
01:25:30,843 --> 01:25:34,413
Well, this place is still the same.

1704
01:25:34,414 --> 01:25:35,479
Yeah.

1705
01:25:35,481 --> 01:25:36,650
Oh, come on.

1706
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:39,384
So, what about you?

1707
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:41,886
You... you never met anyone or...

1708
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:44,389
Never found the right fit.

1709
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:46,325
Mm-hmm.

1710
01:25:46,326 --> 01:25:48,059
I'm really stubborn.

1711
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,094
I know that.

1712
01:25:50,095 --> 01:25:52,331
When you put your mind
to something, that was that.

1713
01:25:53,366 --> 01:25:54,766
Yeah.

1714
01:25:54,767 --> 01:25:56,468
That's good for getting things done.

1715
01:25:56,469 --> 01:25:58,337
It's not so good for relationships.

1716
01:25:58,338 --> 01:25:59,987
- Uh...
- Mmm.

1717
01:26:01,374 --> 01:26:03,608
Okay, well...

1718
01:26:03,609 --> 01:26:05,744
Okay, here we go.

1719
01:26:05,745 --> 01:26:07,546
They're gonna lick faces.

1720
01:26:07,547 --> 01:26:10,615
Well, look, this was really nice.

1721
01:26:10,616 --> 01:26:12,050
I gotta go.

1722
01:26:12,051 --> 01:26:13,418
Thank you, Ethan.

1723
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:15,787
Wait, what?

1724
01:26:15,788 --> 01:26:17,055
Oh, come on!

1725
01:26:17,056 --> 01:26:18,990
Hey, thanks for bringing back my dog.

1726
01:26:18,991 --> 01:26:21,603
You're welcome. Bye.

1727
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:26,658
Hey, Hannah.

1728
01:26:29,902 --> 01:26:31,655
I, uh...

1729
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:35,106
I owe you an apology.

1730
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,709
For what happened to us.

1731
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:39,811
Back then.

1732
01:26:39,812 --> 01:26:40,945
Well, don't worry.

1733
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:42,747
It was a long, long time ago.

1734
01:26:42,748 --> 01:26:43,745
No.

1735
01:26:43,749 --> 01:26:45,116
I pushed you away.

1736
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:48,553
And I was...
I was really mad at the world.

1737
01:26:48,554 --> 01:26:51,623
And I just want you to know
that not a day goes by

1738
01:26:51,624 --> 01:26:57,028
that I don't kick myself for doing that.

1739
01:26:57,029 --> 01:27:00,532
There's that sweaty smell.

1740
01:27:00,533 --> 01:27:03,034
You think, uh,

1741
01:27:03,035 --> 01:27:07,472
it'd be crazy if...

1742
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:10,944
we did something together?

1743
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,613
Are you asking me out on a date?

1744
01:27:14,614 --> 01:27:18,517
Well, I just think
that I'd be an all-time fool

1745
01:27:18,518 --> 01:27:22,621
if I just watched you drive away.

1746
01:27:22,622 --> 01:27:25,690
Enough talking. Use your nose.

1747
01:27:25,691 --> 01:27:27,426
Then don't.

1748
01:27:38,471 --> 01:27:42,113
Okay, now you're getting it.

1749
01:27:47,747 --> 01:27:49,465
Yes! Yes!

1750
01:27:53,553 --> 01:27:54,786
Get out of here.

1751
01:27:54,787 --> 01:27:56,746
Give 'em some space.

1752
01:28:03,863 --> 01:28:05,630
Few right there, that's why...

1753
01:28:05,631 --> 01:28:07,599
Hi, you little cutie pie.

1754
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,590
Ew. My water has mint in it.

1755
01:28:12,104 --> 01:28:13,926
You have a good time?

1756
01:28:15,741 --> 01:28:17,809
Once they started licking faces,

1757
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:19,578
no one could stop them.

1758
01:28:19,579 --> 01:28:22,013
Ethan finally had what he needed.

1759
01:28:22,014 --> 01:28:23,904
He was happy.

1760
01:28:24,984 --> 01:28:28,186
I was happy, too.

1761
01:28:28,187 --> 01:28:29,888
Excuse me, everybody.

1762
01:28:29,889 --> 01:28:34,192
I-I would like to thank you all
for coming here today.

1763
01:28:34,193 --> 01:28:36,595
- It means a lot to Hannah and I.
- Cheers. - Hear, hear.

1764
01:28:36,596 --> 01:28:38,597
I've always wanted a big family.

1765
01:28:38,598 --> 01:28:40,098
All in one day, I've got one.

1766
01:28:40,099 --> 01:28:41,833
You didn't tell me how big it was.

1767
01:28:43,202 --> 01:28:45,837
I just would like to say
how grateful I am,

1768
01:28:45,838 --> 01:28:48,873
that my beautiful girl

1769
01:28:48,874 --> 01:28:51,510
walked back into my life.

1770
01:28:51,511 --> 01:28:52,844
- Aw.
- Thank you.

1771
01:28:52,845 --> 01:28:55,179
Life's a mystery.

1772
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:57,758
Cheers.

1773
01:28:59,952 --> 01:29:02,621
There was one thing I still wanted.

1774
01:29:02,622 --> 01:29:04,288
I wanted him to know it was me.

1775
01:29:04,289 --> 01:29:06,290
We had so much fun last night.

1776
01:29:06,291 --> 01:29:07,592
That I was Bailey.

1777
01:29:07,593 --> 01:29:08,659
What a great night.

1778
01:29:08,661 --> 01:29:10,161
Stop.

1779
01:29:10,162 --> 01:29:11,763
You were amazing.

1780
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:13,173
Yeah. You, too.

1781
01:29:16,569 --> 01:29:18,603
- Wait, didn't Bailey used to do that?
- Yeah.

1782
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:20,238
It's a dog thing.

1783
01:29:21,841 --> 01:29:25,309
Bailey. I'm Bailey.

1784
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:27,785
There's gotta be a way.

1785
01:29:33,953 --> 01:29:35,554
Hmm. Wait.

1786
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:40,765
That's familiar.

1787
01:29:59,044 --> 01:30:02,791
I smelled... me.

1788
01:30:09,021 --> 01:30:10,637
What do you got there?

1789
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:14,706
Where did you find that?

1790
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:21,795
Hey.

1791
01:30:23,235 --> 01:30:24,769
You want to play?

1792
01:30:25,805 --> 01:30:27,071
Get ready.

1793
01:30:27,072 --> 01:30:30,337
You have to really go after this one.

1794
01:30:31,611 --> 01:30:33,077
Go get it.

1795
01:30:33,078 --> 01:30:34,779
Good boy!

1796
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:36,681
Come on, bring it here.

1797
01:30:36,682 --> 01:30:37,954
Good one.

1798
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:42,120
All right.

1799
01:30:42,121 --> 01:30:44,656
You go play, all right?

1800
01:30:44,657 --> 01:30:46,100
Gotta get back.

1801
01:30:52,932 --> 01:30:55,784
What? What do you want?

1802
01:30:59,071 --> 01:31:01,270
This is nuts.

1803
01:31:08,714 --> 01:31:10,915
All right, Buddy.

1804
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:12,851
You want to go for the showstopper?

1805
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,832
You want to try it?
You want to get it?

1806
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:19,223
Ready?

1807
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:20,825
I am ready.

1808
01:31:20,826 --> 01:31:22,888
Okay. Go!

1809
01:31:35,107 --> 01:31:37,719
Where did you learn
how to do that, Buddy?

1810
01:31:42,314 --> 01:31:45,684
You are really starting
to freak me out, boss dog.

1811
01:31:45,685 --> 01:31:47,719
Yes, Ethan, that's right.

1812
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:50,054
I'm your boss dog.
I'm Bailey.

1813
01:31:50,055 --> 01:31:51,322
Say it.

1814
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:54,392
Boss dog?

1815
01:31:59,098 --> 01:32:00,865
Are you the boss dog?

1816
01:32:06,138 --> 01:32:07,806
No.

1817
01:32:07,807 --> 01:32:10,141
Yes. It's me, Ethan.

1818
01:32:10,142 --> 01:32:11,310
It's me.

1819
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,749
Bailey?

1820
01:32:26,258 --> 01:32:28,183
Bailey.

1821
01:32:36,368 --> 01:32:39,370
Boss dog.

1822
01:32:39,371 --> 01:32:43,152
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.
Bailey, Bailey.

1823
01:32:49,048 --> 01:32:50,010
Aw.

1824
01:32:52,918 --> 01:32:54,385
Mmm, yeah.

1825
01:33:01,393 --> 01:33:04,062
So, in all my lives as a dog,

1826
01:33:04,063 --> 01:33:06,022
here's what I've learned.

1827
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:10,201
Have fun, obviously.

1828
01:33:10,202 --> 01:33:12,436
Whenever possible,

1829
01:33:12,437 --> 01:33:16,274
find someone to save, and save them.

1830
01:33:16,275 --> 01:33:18,042
Lick the ones you love.

1831
01:33:18,043 --> 01:33:20,812
Don't get all sad-faced
about what happened

1832
01:33:20,813 --> 01:33:24,983
and scrunchy-faced about what could.

1833
01:33:24,984 --> 01:33:26,384
- Just be here now.
- Go!

1834
01:33:26,385 --> 01:33:27,819
Okay, go get it.

1835
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:30,554
- Be here now.
- That's it.

1836
01:33:32,391 --> 01:33:35,175
That's a dog's purpose.
