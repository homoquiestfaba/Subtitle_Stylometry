00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,152
Get out of the way! Move!

2
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:02,655
Come on.

3
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:06,200
Come on, man.
Get up.

4
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:07,577
Come on.

5
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:10,663
Shoot!

6
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:18,461
Suspect out of the way.
Headinhg towanrd Exchanhge.

7
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:22,299
Move it!
Out of the way!

8
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,308
Hold it!

9
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:42,151
Don't move! Don't move!
Get away from that window!

10
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:44,402
Get over there!
Do what I say!

11
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:47,656
Oh, shit. Pick up my meat.

12
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:55,537
- You hungry, brother?
- Do I look hungry? Get over there!

13
00:01:58,376 --> 00:02:01,753
I might be a little hungry,
but get your hands up!

14
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,588
- He ain't got no gun.
- You think I ain't got a gun?

15
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:07,883
- Shoot me, goddamn it!
- l'll shoot you.

16
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,721
You mother--

17
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:13,472
No. Come on, Hank!

18
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:15,557
Back up, back up!

19
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:17,184
What you know about
a brother needing a job?

20
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:21,104
- Big Floyd Patterson haircut head.
- You don't look like Floyd.

21
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,523
Shoot. I just wanted
to barbecue.

22
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,067
It's the goddamn Fourth of July.

23
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:28,444
Can't a black man have
a goddamn Fourth of July, too?

24
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:32,449
- Open up! lt's the police!
- Sweet Jesus.

25
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:35,661
Kick it in!

26
00:02:36,537 --> 00:02:39,789
- Don't mess with my conk.
- You want a barbecue?

27
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:45,585
Is there a problem, officers?

28
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:49,257
Yeah. We're looking for a thief.
You seen one?

29
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,383
Me? No, I haven't seen a thi--

30
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:54,595
Hank, you seen
a thief around here?

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,763
- No, no, not around here.
- No, me, either.

32
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:59,016
No thief.

33
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:05,145
You guys aren't
celebrating the holiday?

34
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:08,024
Sure. We're just finishing up
our last customer.

35
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:18,534
I said play
Iike you cuttin' it.

36
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,849
Eddie, you can't talk about people
just 'cause they biracial.

37
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:57,852
- Why not?
- 'Cause that's silly.

38
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:59,896
They can take it
Iike anybody else.

39
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,524
All l'm saying, Calvin,
is black folk love to take credit

40
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,777
for they half-black brothers
and sisters till somethin' goes sour.

41
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:10,280
You know, like Tiger Woods--
we claim him.

42
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,991
Jennifer Beals. What the boy mama
used to be on The Jeffenrsonhs?

43
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:16,078
- Lenny Kravitz.
- Lenny Kravitz--count him.

44
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:19,080
As soon as they go freak out
just a little bit,

45
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:22,125
go a little crazy, get a little glitter
Iike Mariah Carey,

46
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,046
then all of a sudden it's the other half
that went looney tunes.

47
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:31,759
- What about Vin Diesel?
- I don't know what he is. Half car.

48
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:33,677
What black man
do you take credit for?

49
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:38,223
I'll tell you who I donh't want
to take credit for--that D.C. sniper.

50
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:39,432
I was mad when I found out
dude was black.

51
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,728
Hold on there, Terri.

52
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:46,565
The D.C. sniper is like
the Jackie Robinson of crime.

53
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:48,108
What?!

54
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:50,944
Tell them, Eddie.

55
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:53,947
He broke into the white leagues
with that crime.

56
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:59,117
That crime took planning.
Not only planning, it took math.

57
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:03,706
You know, it took math
to figure out all them trajectories

58
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,333
to shoot from the back
of an automobile.

59
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,253
That's white-folk shit right there.

60
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:12,422
With the problems we got,
black folks used to could say,

61
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:13,924
"At least we ain't crazy."

62
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:15,425
Our crimes made sense.

63
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:18,804
Ain't got no money,
rob somebody with money.

64
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,931
Black folks are just as crazy
as white folks.

65
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:26,018
Mike Tyson--
he's like three crazy people.

66
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,103
Prince?

67
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:28,773
Hold on, hold on now.

68
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:31,357
He half Cherokee or something.
Don't put him in with us.

69
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:33,776
DVDs, CDs. lke Turner's
greatest hits with Tina on the cover.

70
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:36,822
Got something
you ain't gonna believe--

71
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:38,614
R. Kelly on tape
with grown women.

72
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:41,699
I got Gnranhdmas Gonhe Wild.
You ever seen wrinkles in a thong?

73
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:43,994
Fred, don't buy nothing
from that fool.

74
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:46,704
That Nemo tape I got for my son
has a crack deal on it.

75
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:49,708
- Why you always lyin' on me?
- Ain't nobody lyin' on you.

76
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,752
Line me up.
I got a meeting in 19 minutes.

77
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,463
Head to your meeting
'cause I got next.

78
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:57,714
K-Rod called and booked
the spot after that,

79
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:02,678
but I can get you at 3:45
or 1 1 :00 on Tuesday.

80
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,683
You a superstar now?
The Eminem of the barber world?

81
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,226
Yeah, that's why
they call me Slim Fadin'.

82
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:12,479
This used to be my chair.

83
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:15,065
Wasn't but two seconds ago
your pasty Pilgrim ass

84
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:16,401
was sitting at that front seat
and nobody was feeling you.

85
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:20,319
Well, they're feeling me now.

86
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:22,238
I'll touch you up.

87
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,916
My customer's running late,
so I can take you.

88
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:36,294
Cool.

89
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:41,841
Hi.

90
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:43,217
Hello.

91
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:50,264
So...

92
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:53,058
what's it like
working for Alderman Brown?

93
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:57,606
It's good.
The alderman is a great mentor.

94
00:08:57,732 --> 00:09:00,358
Must be nice doing
what you said you'd always do.

95
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,152
I really admire that.

96
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:07,282
- Apple juice?
- What's going on here?

97
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,575
Who set this up?
This shit ain't funny.

98
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,369
- What?
- This. You being nice to me?

99
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:15,539
You admire me? You got back
together with Kevin, didn't you?

100
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:18,751
I do not need a man
to make me feel good.

101
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:21,002
Plus, l'm trying to be
at peace with myself.

102
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,963
I don't know this woman.

103
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:25,382
Would you know me if I shoved
my foot up your ass?

104
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:27,509
Oh, yes, there she goes.

105
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:29,094
Let's go.

106
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,597
Lookin' good, Mr. Stewart.
Now you can get your swerve on.

107
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:34,056
Calvin, when you get my age,
you don't swerve.

108
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:37,101
You just be happy gettin'
that bad boy out of park.

109
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:38,645
You tell him.

110
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:41,397
You got something smaller?
I don't got change.

111
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:44,108
- Just keep it.
- You ain't got to tell me twice.

112
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,068
What'd you do,
hit the lotto?

113
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:48,320
- I sold the cleaners.
- What?

114
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:51,323
Yep, sold it.
Time for early retirement.

115
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,243
Quality Land Development came in
and made me an offer.

116
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,370
More money than l'd ever seen.
I jumped at it.

117
00:09:57,498 --> 00:10:01,292
- What are they going to put in?
- A Kinko's or something.

118
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:04,752
I heard they was gonna move
a Subway over there.

119
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,839
A Subway and a Blockbuster.

120
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:09,132
Yep. White folk
is coming back.

121
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,218
They tryin'
to make money on a brother.

122
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:14,136
This ain't about
white folks comin' back.

123
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:15,721
Most of these businesses
coming in are black-owned.

124
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,059
This whole block
is gonna get upgrades.

125
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:21,852
They can tear down
all this mess around here.

126
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:23,187
Change is a good thing.

127
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:27,149
Long as they ain't buildin' liquor stores
and titty bars, l'm cool with it.

128
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,818
Wait a minute now, Calvin.

129
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:32,196
If they build a titty bar across
the street, I ain't never goin' home.

130
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,326
Hey, babe!

131
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,827
Here's your shit.
I burned the rest of it.

132
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,205
The next time
you want to call yourself

133
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,623
sleeping around
behind somebody's back,

134
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,792
make sure
she look like something

135
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:48,544
'cause I heard
all of your little shit.

136
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,797
Your cell called the house,
and I heard all two minutes of it.

137
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,135
No, I didn't hear it?
Are you trying to call me a liar?

138
00:10:57,221 --> 00:11:00,806
I don't even see how you could
cheat on me with your toddler penis.

139
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,349
I hope you had a good time.

140
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:06,018
The next time you come back,
I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.

141
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,564
I got a sword, I got an ax,
a box of bullets,

142
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,653
and l'm gonna get both of my babies'
daddies to jump on that ass!

143
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:18,532
What does she gotta have
both of them for?

144
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:19,448
Shut up!

145
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:30,166
Like I was sayin', if they
build a titty bar across the street,

146
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:31,877
I ain't never goin' home.

147
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:35,507
You couldn't go home
if you wanted to.

148
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:43,429
You act like you know
what you're doing.

149
00:11:43,514 --> 00:11:44,639
Please, man.

150
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:03,198
Now watch this. Balance.
No. Balance.

151
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:04,409
Balance.

152
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:07,160
What is all that Circus Dee Soleil
that you're doin'?

153
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:10,372
All that flippity hippity
stompity stoobily-doo.

154
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:11,915
It ain't necessary
to cut nobody head.

155
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:19,005
What's up, dawg?
I don't get the "l"?

156
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:22,883
Come on, dawg.
You know I gotta have the "l."

157
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:23,969
Stop playin'.

158
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,471
- Where do you want it?
- Right here.

159
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:42,111
Tight!

160
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:46,281
That mess ain't right.
I want my rent money on the first.

161
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,533
Not the second, not--
Hold on, let me finish my thought.

162
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,620
Not the second,
'cause l'm not the bad guy here.

163
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:54,331
Am I the bad guy here?

164
00:12:57,669 --> 00:12:58,961
Come here.

165
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:01,879
Check it out, little man.

166
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:03,465
One thing you're gonna constantly
have to deal with in your life,

167
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:08,218
and that's broke-ass
black folks.

168
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:11,721
They gonna be hard to spot
'cause they dressed real nice.

169
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,059
Don't let that fool you,
'cause the nicer they dress,

170
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:17,392
usually the broker they are.

171
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:20,772
I like hanging with you.

172
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:24,317
You know, this is gonna
be yours one day--all of this.

173
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:27,987
Hey, Calvin, you goin'
over to Ema's?

174
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:31,991
Tell her my niece sent her
a graduation picture Friday.

175
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:34,951
- Bring me back a sweet potato pie.
- I ain't bringing you back nothin'.

176
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:43,252
Hey, Keisha.
Where Janelle at?

177
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:45,337
She's not here yet.
Hey, boo.

178
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:47,173
Now, why you even go there?

179
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:50,843
You can read a calendar.
You know she called in sick.

180
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:54,969
I need my rent money.
The bank want they money on the first.

181
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:57,849
I need my money on the first,
not the second and not the 1 5th.

182
00:13:57,976 --> 00:13:59,643
Come here, Coley.

183
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:03,521
Come here. Your momy
Ieave you with this crazy man?

184
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:06,775
Crazy? l'm about to
drop him off at Miss Ema's.

185
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:09,276
Ain't that right?

186
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:12,404
You know, your daddy used to like
to play with those, too.

187
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,822
- And this.
- Watch your mouth, girl.

188
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:16,908
They can remember that shit--
I mean stuff.

189
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:19,452
- Y'all see Calvin baby boy?
- Hey, Coley.

190
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:21,788
You know that should have
been your baby.

191
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,374
I know.

192
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,503
After Calvin and I stopped dating,
he started thinkin' small.

193
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:31,006
He opted for the Happy Meal
instead of the Super Size.

194
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,716
No, he opted for less drama.

195
00:14:34,468 --> 00:14:38,095
- lt's her six-foot Pocahontas weave.
- That's what it is.

196
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,307
She ain't weavin' it up
Iike most of y'all in here.

197
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:44,643
Y'all just mad 'cause she got
a little lndian in her family.

198
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:47,812
Please. That girl got
perm in her family.

199
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,732
Why every time I come in here,
you start up with me?

200
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:52,108
You know I got love for you.

201
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:56,488
If you got that much love for me,
tell Janelle to give me my rent

202
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:58,656
before I turn off the power in here

203
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:01,534
and have all you ladies
runnin' out screaming.

204
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:03,328
Bye, Gina.

205
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:06,498
How come you not
playing with Coley?

206
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:09,833
You're just my baby.
Yes, he is.

207
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:16,882
Stop. Say grace first.

208
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,178
Jesus wept.

209
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:22,345
Why?

210
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,348
Why what?

211
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,184
Why did Jesus weep?

212
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,519
- 'Cause he was sad.
- Why was he sad?

213
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,524
'Cause they didn't let him
eat his biscuit.

214
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,234
Now, you know I helped
raise you better than that.

215
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:39,403
Raised you like you was
my own son.

216
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,448
Okay. I gotta go, Miss Ema.

217
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:46,035
When you get back here,
you better tell me why Jesus wept.

218
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,416
You know what?
He probably was mad

219
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:56,253
'cause they wouldn't let him put
jelly on his biscuit before he left.

220
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:20,276
I ain't seen you in two days.

221
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,944
And why you look so damn tired?

222
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,196
Ricky, just be a man
and let me know.

223
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:26,365
I'm being a man.

224
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,825
If you got somebody else,
then just say it.

225
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,578
You don't need to be slippin'
and slidin' and hidin'.

226
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:33,996
Nobody hidin'.
This ain't no subterfuge.

227
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:36,416
- I just been busy.
- Doin' what?

228
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:39,503
'Cause you sure ain't doin' me.
Who you doin'?

229
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:42,171
And what the hell
is a subter-fudge?

230
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:44,924
Listen, you know how it is,
all right?

231
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,259
When we together,
we together.

232
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:49,345
And when we not, we not.

233
00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:52,556
That Ricky, he's the man.

234
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:54,518
Please. He's a clown.

235
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:56,686
Be like Mike,
not like Rick.

236
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:00,021
If I was like Mike,
would you like me?

237
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:01,357
- Brad Pitt.
- Mel Gibson.

238
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:04,567
- Bill Clinton.
- Bill Clinton?

239
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:08,072
He's a freak,
and I likes me a freaky man.

240
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:10,698
If I had to choose me
a white boy to sleep with,

241
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:12,451
- l'd have to say Mini-Me.
- Mini-Me?

242
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:13,451
Use your head.

243
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,871
- What?
- What?

244
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:19,665
Use your head.

245
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,167
You bad girl!

246
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:26,714
Excuse me, Miss Watson.
I'm sorry.

247
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:28,382
Hey, Dinka.

248
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,051
- Good morning.
- What's up, D?

249
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:32,511
Thank you, Dinka.
They look great.

250
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:34,763
- Beautiful shoes.
- Thank you, Dinka.

251
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:44,021
Damn a Mini-Me.
I'll take me one of those.

252
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:47,399
All l'm saying is we need
to keep our eye on Trent Lott.

253
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:49,569
We need to know where
his ass is at all times. He racist!

254
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,738
He's the poster child
for stupid white men.

255
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,909
I don't know about that.
Dan Quayle couldn't spell "potato."

256
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,911
You know what?
You right about that, Checkers.

257
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,080
You know what?

258
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:05,291
You can be a stupid white man
and get elected president. Twice!

259
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:09,088
All l'm saying is
if you're gonna have oral relations

260
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,673
with an ugly, fat white girl
with low self-esteem, lock the door.

261
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,680
Lock the door! Click.

262
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,514
Handle your business.

263
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,932
There it is.

264
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,686
Calvin, come look.

265
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,897
They're gonna lock your ass up
for talkin' like that.

266
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,903
When did they put that up?

267
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,990
Guess it ain't no titty bar.

268
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,493
Hold up.

269
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:46,748
I can't believe this.

270
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:50,293
- Quentin!
- Hey, Calvin.

271
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,962
You like our sign?
Not too flashy, I hope.

272
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:57,091
I don't want it to fight
the funk of the neighborhood.

273
00:18:57,175 --> 00:19:00,302
I thought this was a club.
What is Nappy Cutz?

274
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:01,804
You never heard of us?

275
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:05,265
It's a franchise, the black man's
answer to Supercuts.

276
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,934
Got ten locations nationwide.

277
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:10,812
This'll be the first one
in Chicago.

278
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,651
Ten chairs with every amenity
the African-American male desires.

279
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:17,403
- On my block?
- lt's just an alternative.

280
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:19,404
You the man.
Your shop is legendary.

281
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:22,030
Only business on the block
to survive the riots of '68.

282
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,576
We can't compete with you.

283
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:27,745
I gotta go.

284
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,207
Listen, when 24/7 opens,
I'd love to buy you a latte.

285
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:35,085
I can buy
my own damn latte.

286
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,339
I know what this is.
You're tryin' to compete with us.

287
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:43,427
It's not a competition.

288
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,305
It's a rout.

289
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:49,265
Your business will be closed
in six months, seven at the most.

290
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,351
When the bank forecloses,
I'm gonna buy your shop

291
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,518
and turn it
into a more viable cash cow,

292
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:55,855
Iike a Bally's
or a Jamba Juice.

293
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,317
We could bypass all the stress
if you would sell it to me now.

294
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:04,363
But of course you wouldn't
do that--too much pride.

295
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,282
And I respect that.

296
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:12,789
I respect that, too.

297
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,797
You be safe out there.

298
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:24,340
I was gonna say
the same thing to you.

299
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:30,722
What did slick-head negro want?

300
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:33,725
These guys fittin'
to open a shop on our block?

301
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,810
They're gonna take
all our customers.

302
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:37,686
Quality Land Development
buyin' up everything.

303
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:39,605
We just gotta
step up our game.

304
00:20:40,316 --> 00:20:42,900
Hey, Rick, you handled
that deposit for me?

305
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:49,782
You gonna have to cool it
on these extra activities.

306
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:53,618
I don't care about your vampire hours
as long as you do what I ask.

307
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:55,412
It's not what you think.

308
00:20:55,496 --> 00:20:57,414
- I had some--
- Some bullshit to do.

309
00:20:57,497 --> 00:21:00,165
You should've asked me,
someone more dependable.

310
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:01,793
Both of you can kiss my ass.

311
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:05,254
Hold up, don't fall apart.
Don't fall apart.

312
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,674
Not right now, okay?

313
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,008
We got competition on the block.

314
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,343
And I guess change,
that's a good thing, right?

315
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:16,098
Well, it's free enterprise.
This is America.

316
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:17,266
Shut up, Dinka.

317
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:20,895
- Survival of the fittest.
- Says the privileged white boy.

318
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:23,855
The privileged white boy
do a better job on that fade.

319
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,484
You're starting to cross the line.
Relax yourself.

320
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,527
Quit it. Quit it.

321
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:33,113
Don't sweat it, Cal.
We got your back no matter what.

322
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:36,868
Come on, everybody, let's go back.
This ain't nothin'.

323
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:39,746
I've seen this many times.
They come and they go.

324
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,539
We gonna be all right.
We gonna be fine.

325
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:46,251
- Man, why you trippin' back there?
- Why you frontin', man?

326
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,338
I know you're
supposed to be the superstar,

327
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:51,423
but don't you ever
roll up on my customers.

328
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,758
- What was you thinkin'?
- You're right, man.

329
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:57,136
Okay, it's my bad.
It's my bad.

330
00:21:57,222 --> 00:21:59,514
His fade was
a little crooked, though.

331
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:04,101
It's hard being that good, ain't it?

332
00:22:04,187 --> 00:22:06,980
Look, Cal,
it's nappy-cutz.com.

333
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:09,482
ht's the pnrofessionhalism
that is bestowed uponh me

334
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:14,319
whenh h come inhto Nappy Cutz
that h appnreciate.

335
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:16,238
Did that boy say
"bestowed upon me"?

336
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:17,490
That's what it sounded like.

337
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:19,616
ht's the bikinhi waxes
that h love...

338
00:22:19,742 --> 00:22:21,409
Look at the couches, man,
and the lighting.

339
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:22,745
Look at that.

340
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,581
Last week
h had me a milk bath.

341
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:26,290
What?

342
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,583
Oh. baby.

343
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,167
They dippin' sisters
in milk over there?

344
00:22:30,253 --> 00:22:34,422
Give me some cookies.
I'll go over there myself.

345
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:38,927
Was that...

346
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,595
- That was him!
- lt looked like him.

347
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:43,681
That's a look-alike.
How can they get him?

348
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:45,099
Turn that mess off.

349
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:48,685
That little girl is nasty!

350
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:50,896
Back to work.

351
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,565
Checker Fred, back to checkers.

352
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:56,151
My boys up in Memphis
go to Nappy Cut.

353
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:58,236
They said it's off the chain.

354
00:22:58,363 --> 00:23:00,197
They got honeys in bikinis,

355
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:02,240
be serving wine when they
walk through the door.

356
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:03,575
That ain't nothin'.

357
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,787
I heard they got fish
in the floor, swiming.

358
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:08,455
You standin' on top of them.

359
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:11,249
You could pick a fish out,
get it baked, broiled,

360
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:14,711
fried, grilled,
fondued, souffléd,

361
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:16,879
- sautéed, sushied, all that.
- Fondued?

362
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:19,298
I like that whole massage thing.

363
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:20,633
That's tight.

364
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:22,468
Let me tell you all somethin'.

365
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:24,387
That's not a real barbershop.

366
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:28,681
That's a fake, franchise,
corporate version of a barbershop.

367
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:30,309
That's why they got gimicks.

368
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:33,061
They ain't got
no real character up in there.

369
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:36,731
A real barbershop got real people,
real conversation,

370
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,817
and most of all, real barbers,
and that's what we got here.

371
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:42,654
Calvin, my man!

372
00:23:42,738 --> 00:23:44,238
Oh, God.

373
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,949
Kenard. Hold up.
Dude, look--

374
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:48,911
I love you, cuz.
I love you, man.

375
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,119
I finished barber school
on Wednesday,

376
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:52,997
and now l'm working
in a shop today.

377
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:56,209
That's how family
supposed to do for each other.

378
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,252
- Did Jennifer call you?
- I spoke to her this morning.

379
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,089
Did she tell you that
maybe l'll try you out? Maybe?

380
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:03,632
I'm down with trying out.

381
00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:07,386
I'm about to be
Rookie of the Year up in here.

382
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:10,388
That's me, man?

383
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:14,934
Baby, you're putting me
in the front chair?

384
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:16,937
The best chair in the shop.

385
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:19,230
That's how family
supposed to do.

386
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,024
You right, too much love.

387
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,151
What's up, player?
How you feelin'? All right.

388
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:26,779
Freddie Douglass!
You old school! Come on.

389
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:29,823
You can do it.
Come on, now. All right!

390
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:31,242
What's up, girlfriend?

391
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:34,703
Okay, okay.
What's up, brother?

392
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,372
Everything cool?

393
00:24:36,498 --> 00:24:38,249
Don't leave me hanging.

394
00:24:38,374 --> 00:24:40,458
Mutombo!
What'd you shave your head for?

395
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:43,545
I'm with you, brother.
We goin' back to Africa.

396
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:48,175
Beauties.

397
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:50,761
Hello.

398
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:52,470
Mia!

399
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,015
Naomi!

400
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,266
You know you know me.

401
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:01,562
I know you not gonna let him
put them pictures up,

402
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:04,482
not when you made me
take Lola Falana down.

403
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:05,858
Kenard.

404
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:08,110
It's a probationary period.

405
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:11,404
You understand probation,
don't you?

406
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,698
Who is this orphan?

407
00:25:14,325 --> 00:25:15,158
All right, all right.

408
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:18,286
Rich, where you at, man?

409
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:21,831
Ain't never seen nothin'
Iike that in your life.

410
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:24,543
Yeah, that's good.

411
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:27,295
Tighten myself up.

412
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:30,172
Yo, Big C, explain him.

413
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:33,258
Call my wife, man.
That's her people.

414
00:25:33,343 --> 00:25:34,635
Damn.

415
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:37,512
Who's next?
Come on.

416
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:40,515
Have a seat right here.
Kenard's chair.

417
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,937
That aroma is
kind of gettin' to me.

418
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:47,856
What kind of coffee is that?

419
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:53,028
It's not a coffee.
It's a chai with soy.

420
00:25:53,112 --> 00:25:55,613
Okay, so it's herbal.
Yeah, it's herbal.

421
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:58,741
You must be a lot like me.
You lactose intolerant.

422
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:01,786
Yeah, l'm lactose intolerant.
I go near a cow,

423
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:05,123
and my behind blow up
Iike Dizzy Gillespie.

424
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,458
Downright flatulent.

425
00:26:08,418 --> 00:26:09,710
And the smell.

426
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:12,087
Man, the smell that come
out of there,

427
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,756
it's so bad, sometimes
I have to set myself outside.

428
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:17,300
I'm not lactose intolerant,
all right?

429
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:20,637
I have a very healthy metabolism.

430
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:25,474
I tried to have some of them little,
bitty Milky Ways--the small one.

431
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,894
I ate two of them
at a party one night,

432
00:26:27,978 --> 00:26:30,103
and, man, it just got...

433
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:36,902
I just couldn't control it.
It was the lactose intoleration.

434
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:39,112
Listen, l'm not lactose intolerant.

435
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:43,449
Look, man, all that's fine.
I'm trying to help you.

436
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,619
It's just not fair
for your date.

437
00:26:45,745 --> 00:26:48,287
You gotta think about
if you on a date

438
00:26:48,414 --> 00:26:50,664
and you up here
sneakin' 'em off,

439
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,916
and she's trying to wonder,

440
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:57,380
"He seem like he dressed nice,
he seems clean, but what is that smell?"

441
00:26:57,506 --> 00:27:00,549
And you tryin' to act like
you ain't got no--

442
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:03,177
Take care of yourself.

443
00:27:03,303 --> 00:27:06,638
Sir, I am very nice
to black people, okay?

444
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:07,806
Nice to black people?

445
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:10,017
You better be,
especially me.

446
00:27:10,144 --> 00:27:12,686
I keep my stuff with me, okay?
I cut you.

447
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:17,315
You can look me up on the lnternet,
www.cut-a-mother.com.

448
00:27:17,443 --> 00:27:20,069
That's me right there
Iookin' at you.

449
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:29,536
- Hey, watch it!
- Move!

450
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:46,343
Your precious love

451
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,392
Your precious love

452
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:59,730
Heaven must have sent you
from above

453
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:02,192
Must have sent you, baby

454
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:06,487
Heaven must have sent
your precious love

455
00:28:06,572 --> 00:28:09,865
Your precious love

456
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,743
To find a love like ours

457
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,078
Stop!

458
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:18,123
- To find
- To find

459
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,375
With your finger.

460
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:20,834
To find

461
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:22,920
To find

462
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:25,130
Your finger goin' up there,
but you not.

463
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:27,882
I need to find a new tenor.

464
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:31,803
Man. I wish
my brother Darnell was out.

465
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,734
Eddie, where you goin'?

466
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,332
What the hell's
the matter with you?

467
00:29:05,587 --> 00:29:07,129
Taxi!

468
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,508
- Get out of the way, fool!
- I can't wait for you.

469
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:28,565
There's a guy
on the other side of the rig!

470
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:34,904
Get off the truck!
Get off!

471
00:30:09,063 --> 00:30:11,022
You wanna know my name, right?

472
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:12,608
Yeah.

473
00:30:12,692 --> 00:30:14,359
Loretta.

474
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:18,238
Yeah.

475
00:30:26,747 --> 00:30:28,831
I'm not saying
we made out of money.

476
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:31,500
I'm just saying we need
to step it up a little bit.

477
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:33,960
We're about to get punked
by Nappy Cutz.

478
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,254
If you don't think big,
you'll never be big.

479
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:40,175
Calvin, you run a family operation.
You do not need to step it up.

480
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:44,053
Them clowns at Nappy Cutz, they're not
about to take away your business.

481
00:30:44,138 --> 00:30:47,390
Your shop is
a neighborhood institution.

482
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:48,559
Come on.

483
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:51,686
People don't care about institutions.
They got fish in the floor.

484
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:54,106
Just swimin' around.

485
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:58,317
You can get it fried, baked,
sautéed, sushi--

486
00:30:58,402 --> 00:31:01,821
- Who told you that?
- Little Rodney at the shop.

487
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:05,032
Little Rodney told you
he saw fish in the floor.

488
00:31:05,117 --> 00:31:07,826
Well, he actually didn't see
the fish in the floor,

489
00:31:07,911 --> 00:31:09,453
but his cousin in Atlanta
saw fish.

490
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:10,537
You know that's ridiculous.

491
00:31:11,998 --> 00:31:14,040
Little Rodney probably
heard it from somebody

492
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,376
who heard it from somebody else
who was at Nappy Cutz

493
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,794
when they dropped their
Filet-O-Fish onh the floor.

494
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:27,553
That's ridiculous.
I can't believe you said that.

495
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:39,189
Sun salutation, ladies.

496
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:43,276
Feet together,
bringing it to prayer pose.

497
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:46,488
And reach!

498
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,700
Butterfly, butterfly.

499
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,286
Bringing it back to prayer pose.

500
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,914
Deep ujjayi breath.

501
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,041
Breathing in radiance,

502
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:02,169
beauty, light.

503
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,631
Breathing out
any heavy burdens.

504
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:10,427
The key to enlightenment
is to work through your anger,

505
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,346
not have your anger
work through you.

506
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,474
First position.

507
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,271
One, two, three.

508
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,688
He ain't shit!
He ain't shit!

509
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:37,828
Jimy! What's the deal?

510
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:39,163
What's up?

511
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,333
Lookin' good, baby boy!

512
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,336
Always, always.

513
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:46,627
Still ain't shit.

514
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:48,005
Just a little while ago,
he was cuttin' hair.

515
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:54,510
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Alderman Brown's office.

516
00:32:54,596 --> 00:32:56,096
- Good morning, Maggie.
- Good morning, sir.

517
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,557
- Any messages?
- Yes, sir. A whole stack.

518
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:03,603
- Good morning, Alderman.
- Good morning.

519
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:06,605
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Jimy.

520
00:33:06,691 --> 00:33:10,110
- l'd like a moment if you have it.
- I don't. This faithful constituent

521
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:12,402
is in need of counsel,
and I have to provide it.

522
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:14,822
Reach one, teach one.
Remember that.

523
00:33:14,948 --> 00:33:18,325
It's an issue of vital importance
and it'll only take a minute.

524
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,162
- You have 59 seconds.
- Thank you.

525
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,667
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

526
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:28,793
Not you.

527
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:34,506
I wanted to bring to your attention
a particular concern of mine.

528
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:36,634
Are you familiar with Calvin's Barbershop
on 79th and Exchange?

529
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:41,347
Yeah, l'm aware of it.

530
00:33:41,431 --> 00:33:44,015
They're opening a Nappy Cutz
across the street.

531
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:46,727
Yeah, I know all about it.

532
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:49,896
Shouldn't we do something
about that?

533
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:54,402
Why should we?

534
00:33:54,486 --> 00:33:57,821
Competition is
a cornerstone of democracy.

535
00:33:57,905 --> 00:34:00,906
The future is not what it used to be.
Remember that.

536
00:34:00,992 --> 00:34:05,369
But you did say you wanted
to keep that particular area fertile

537
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:07,163
for small-business interests.

538
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:10,667
Fertile.
I did say that, didn't l?

539
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:15,213
This boy is gonna be the governor
of the state of lllinois one day

540
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:17,881
if he learns to do what I say
when I say it.

541
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:23,220
Now, l'm not one for explanations,
explanatory things explained.

542
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:26,432
Write a report and have it
on my desk by the end of the month.

543
00:34:26,558 --> 00:34:29,059
Sir, I think we should move
faster than that.

544
00:34:29,144 --> 00:34:31,978
Think need, not speed.

545
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:36,731
It's better to measure
a thing ten times and cut once

546
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:40,028
than to measure once
and cut ten times.

547
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:42,488
Your minute is up, son.

548
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:52,414
This is gonna be great
for the neighborhood.

549
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:53,958
We'll see.

550
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:55,584
Here he comes.

551
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:00,923
- What's up, Samir?
- Not much.

552
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:02,508
- How are you doing?
- All right.

553
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,968
Very nice shirt on you.

554
00:35:05,095 --> 00:35:07,096
We need to talk to you, Calvin.

555
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:08,597
What's going on?

556
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:11,098
We've been approached
by Quality Land Development.

557
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:13,935
They're building a cineplex there
and they're making us an offer.

558
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:16,103
We're thinking
about taking that offer.

559
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:18,271
The money isn't bad.

560
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:20,816
Plus, the money isn't bad.

561
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:24,946
Stew sold him his cleaners and took
his Viagra-popping ass to Miami.

562
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:26,781
I ain't mad at the brother.

563
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:30,117
What's that got to do with me?
You got your mind made up.

564
00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:33,411
No, we haven't.
But I bet if you came on board

565
00:35:33,496 --> 00:35:36,831
and sold them the barbershop,
they'd probably pay us double.

566
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,250
- That would change my mind.
- Absolutely.

567
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:41,669
- Y'all know I can't do that.
- Why not?

568
00:35:41,754 --> 00:35:43,213
We've been there since '58.

569
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,924
So if y'all wanna sell
and go down to Florida

570
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,137
with them funky-ass voting booths,
you can go ahead.

571
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,179
But l've gotta keep mine.

572
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:52,971
You're making a mistake, bro.

573
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:57,685
No, my friend, you're thinking
about this all the wrong way.

574
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:00,937
Calvin, there's a lot of money
to be made here, son.

575
00:36:01,064 --> 00:36:02,439
Go talk to your boy.

576
00:36:03,483 --> 00:36:06,443
Come on, babies.
Today is the day.

577
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:09,278
We came a long road
to get here.

578
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:10,572
Pay attention.

579
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:12,240
Lighten up.

580
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:14,993
You come in here some days

581
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,078
Iooking like Joe Frazier
in Jamaica.

582
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:20,749
People don't like that.
You're too pretty.

583
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:22,291
Learn how to cook.

584
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,625
I know how to cook.

585
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:26,795
Make him hush puppies
or a Spanish omelet.

586
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:30,132
- Hey there, Calvin.
- Hey, Calvin.

587
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:33,052
- What's up, Cal?
- Yo, lsaac.

588
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:34,887
What's up, boss man?

589
00:36:34,972 --> 00:36:37,097
You all know
why I called this meeting.

590
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:41,185
Nappy Necks, whatever they want
to call theyself across the street,

591
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:43,395
is openin' up in three weeks,

592
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,605
and they're tryin' to get
our ass out of here,

593
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,191
Iike it or not,
and we ain't havin' it.

594
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:50,359
- You know what I mean?
- Damn straight.

595
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:52,153
So my plan is this.

596
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:54,947
Fire up the barbecue in the back,

597
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:58,492
have a little
customer-appreciation cookout.

598
00:36:58,618 --> 00:37:00,619
That's smart.
That's good thinking.

599
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:05,124
Just burgers and dogs,
free haircuts for the kids.

600
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,626
Show the people
we care about 'em.

601
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:11,087
Show them that
whatever they goin' through,

602
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:12,757
we down with them.

603
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:13,841
- You feel me?
- I feel you, Calvin.

604
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:16,259
Definitely.

605
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:18,677
Man, I feel all of that.

606
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:20,263
It all makes sense.

607
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:23,181
That's why I got to raise
your booth rent.

608
00:37:23,268 --> 00:37:24,852
What?

609
00:37:24,936 --> 00:37:26,562
You can't do that.

610
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:29,229
- lt's my first day.
- Why, Calvin?

611
00:37:29,774 --> 00:37:32,066
We got to pay
for this somehow.

612
00:37:32,776 --> 00:37:37,403
Forget about it. We in a crisis,
and you can double my rent.

613
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,490
- You don't even pay no rent.
- What?

614
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,450
In that case, triple it, then.

615
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:45,745
Not to throw salt, but why
you don't pay no booth rent?

616
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:50,249
I don't pay rent
'cause I don't pay rent. Okay?

617
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,669
So pour out your cup of haterade
and sop it up off the floor

618
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:55,381
and get some business.

619
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:59,092
Also, I want to institute
a couple of new rules.

620
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,928
You comin' at me with too much.

621
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:04,471
That's all for one day.
Take baby steps.

622
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:07,684
Rule number one--
no more profanity.

623
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,311
I know you about to say something.
Don't even say it.

624
00:38:10,394 --> 00:38:14,063
I ain't sayin' nothin'.
I'm thinkin' it.

625
00:38:15,024 --> 00:38:16,858
Rule number two--
don't be late.

626
00:38:16,942 --> 00:38:20,069
Who was it that said, "Be on
time for something other than..."

627
00:38:20,196 --> 00:38:22,738
- "...before 1 1 :00 at the club."
- That's what it was.

628
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:25,908
Y'all got jokes.
My bad.

629
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:29,202
Kenard, them Jet beauties,
they got to go, man.

630
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,747
Good.

631
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:33,582
They're my inspiration,
my muses.

632
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:36,168
He made me take down
my picture of Lola Falana.

633
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:38,587
I can't cut without the butt.

634
00:38:38,713 --> 00:38:41,840
That's perfect for me
'cause maybe you'll quit.

635
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:44,510
That's what I thought.

636
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:48,346
We're going to be more
family friendly around here,

637
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:51,099
and I want everybody to start
greeting the customers by name.

638
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:56,104
How are we supposed to know
everybody's name?

639
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:57,480
That's ridiculous.

640
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,149
He's not even showing up.

641
00:39:00,276 --> 00:39:02,318
Yap! Yap! Yap! Yap!

642
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:07,073
All that yapping leads me
to rule number three--

643
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,658
no more loud talking.

644
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:10,868
What?!

645
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,092
Watch it.

646
00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:38,561
Thank you, Calvin.

647
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:42,064
Horace, thanks, man.
I appreciate your coming through.

648
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:43,566
All right, Calvin.

649
00:39:43,692 --> 00:39:45,693
- Take care, man.
- No problem.

650
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:49,237
- Appreciate your business.
- All right, Calvin.

651
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:51,032
God bless.

652
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:53,200
All right, Calvin.

653
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:54,619
Bye, Horace.

654
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,041
You're next.

655
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:03,711
What's up, Cal?

656
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:07,755
Thanks for what you're doing.
We appreciate it.

657
00:40:13,053 --> 00:40:15,971
- Hi, Jimy!
- Hey, everybody.

658
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:18,348
This is not happening.
We got an appointment.

659
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:22,185
You gotta get out of the chair.
Eight Mile gave me this time exactly.

660
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,562
We're almost done.

661
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:26,315
I'll be right with you.

662
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,274
I'm terribly sorry
about the inconvenience.

663
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,696
Calvin, this is why
black business does not succeed.

664
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:35,031
We're never on time.

665
00:40:35,115 --> 00:40:38,909
You're always coming in late.
You leave early.

666
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,370
Giving to the needy and the greedy
instead of the deserving.

667
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:43,915
And double-booking our clients!

668
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,834
Why do you have a schedule
if you ain't gonna use it?

669
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,003
It is 1 1 :02. That means your man
has to get out of the chair.

670
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:54,258
That means it's my time,
and l'm not havin' it.

671
00:40:54,343 --> 00:40:57,595
Come on, man, you gotta bounce.
This is ridiculous.

672
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,429
Vamoose.
Come on, let's go.

673
00:41:00,682 --> 00:41:03,683
- Get him.
- Sit your ass down!

674
00:41:07,355 --> 00:41:09,939
Come on, have a seat.
Enough of it already.

675
00:41:10,024 --> 00:41:10,607
Sit on down, West Wing.

676
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:14,527
Up in here like you're from
Lifestyles of the Rich anhd Famous.

677
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:18,196
Only reason you're in here is 'cause
your daddy didn't use a LifeStyle.

678
00:41:18,282 --> 00:41:21,909
I'll tell y'all one thing--
all y'all are doomed to fail.

679
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:26,162
It was nice and quiet in here,
the way I like it.

680
00:41:26,248 --> 00:41:29,625
Just hush.
Everything was hush.

681
00:41:31,878 --> 00:41:35,881
Free barbecue--food, fun,
and free haircuts for the kids.

682
00:41:36,008 --> 00:41:38,509
Bring 'em on down.
Bring all the kids.

683
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:42,344
Here you go, girl.
We should have kids

684
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:45,932
so we can bring 'em down
to this barbecue Friday.

685
00:41:46,058 --> 00:41:49,185
I think we can squeeze four
out of that ass.

686
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,271
I didn't mean to insult you.
We could probably get five.

687
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:55,648
What's up, Tyson?
Free barbecue this Friday.

688
00:41:55,776 --> 00:41:59,487
Don't be eyeballin' me.
You ain't hard. l'm just playin'.

689
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:00,988
Boy, it's hot out here.

690
00:42:01,072 --> 00:42:04,824
I'm tired of handing out these fliers,
but my cousin say I gotta do it.

691
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:08,244
Before they got his ass,
they was all over there together--

692
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:12,082
Saddam, Osama, all of them
Iivin' in a big old beach house

693
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:13,501
just kickin' it.

694
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:16,377
Got all the money in the world

695
00:42:16,504 --> 00:42:18,838
and some of them ho's
from the Snoop video.

696
00:42:18,964 --> 00:42:22,883
They just freakin' 'em.
Freakin' em all, boy.

697
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:25,635
- And ldi Amin over there, too.
- I thought he--

698
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:28,722
No, no, he ain't dead.
No, he ain't dead.

699
00:42:28,806 --> 00:42:33,100
You can't kill no big
Yaphet Kotto-looking Zulu nigga.

700
00:42:33,228 --> 00:42:36,313
- You know better than that.
- Eddie, you need to quit it.

701
00:42:36,398 --> 00:42:37,481
Let me get some ribs!

702
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:41,984
- Can I fix you a plate, Dinka?
- No, l'm trying to watch it.

703
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,779
You don't need to watch it.

704
00:42:46,407 --> 00:42:48,657
She throwin' it at you, dawg.
What's up with that?

705
00:42:48,742 --> 00:42:53,203
Shawna is a nice woman,
but I don't know if she's the one for me.

706
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:55,748
Who the one for you? Terri?

707
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:58,334
You need to let that go.
That's not gonna happen.

708
00:42:58,418 --> 00:42:59,710
That's the good news.

709
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:04,172
You don't need a loud, evil,
neck-rollin' chicken-head like Terri.

710
00:43:04,257 --> 00:43:06,549
That's what you need.
Go on.

711
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:09,178
Go on over there.

712
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:13,766
Go on.

713
00:43:14,351 --> 00:43:18,520
Isaac, run to the store
and grab me some ice.

714
00:43:18,605 --> 00:43:20,439
We're running short on ice.

715
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:22,566
Kenard ain't doin' nothin'.

716
00:43:23,275 --> 00:43:25,609
Yeah, man, but I asked you.

717
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:29,029
Don't do me like that, man.

718
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:31,405
Can you get me
some ice or not?

719
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:35,494
No disrespect, Cal, but l've been
bustin' my ass in there for you.

720
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:37,955
I've been bringin' in
a lot of business.

721
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:40,582
- I see you.
- So why you treatin' me like a scrub?

722
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:43,877
I treat you like
everybody else around here.

723
00:43:43,962 --> 00:43:47,381
I'm happy you got it goin' on now,
but I need some ice.

724
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:49,424
Can you handle that for me?

725
00:43:50,468 --> 00:43:52,593
- Yeah.
- Get the ice.

726
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,262
Two bags.

727
00:43:55,473 --> 00:43:57,265
Thank you, lsaac.

728
00:43:57,808 --> 00:43:59,267
Where you goin'?

729
00:43:59,351 --> 00:44:01,102
Cal wants me
to handle some business.

730
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,728
Store run.

731
00:44:03,897 --> 00:44:05,898
Can you bring back
some toothpicks?

732
00:44:06,025 --> 00:44:09,485
The minty kind.
Minty freshness.

733
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:10,819
Right on.

734
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:14,363
Oh, yeah. She want
one of Uncle Eddie's burgers.

735
00:44:16,117 --> 00:44:19,202
That is one right there.
That's delicious.

736
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:21,455
This is burnt.

737
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,581
No, baby, that ain't burnt.

738
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,042
That's barbecue.

739
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:27,961
See that brother over there?

740
00:44:29,672 --> 00:44:30,964
That's burnt.

741
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,091
Well, why can't I have
another one?

742
00:44:33,175 --> 00:44:35,926
'Cause you can't.
Now, look, it's free, ain't it?

743
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:39,054
There's people over
in Ethiopia starvin',

744
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,305
and you sittin'
over here complainin'.

745
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,141
- l'm not gonna eat it.
- You sure ain't.

746
00:44:45,937 --> 00:44:49,189
I hate you!
I'm gonna tell my auntie.

747
00:44:50,483 --> 00:44:52,317
Go to the crack house and tell her.

748
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:54,818
Ain't nobody scared!
Tell your auntie!

749
00:44:54,946 --> 00:44:57,280
This is Eddie.
I ain't scared of nothin'.

750
00:44:57,364 --> 00:45:00,491
You can tell whoever you want to.

751
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:03,661
- What'd you do to that little girl?
- I ain't do nothin' to her.

752
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:06,997
Little Moesha tryin' to criticize
my culinary skill.

753
00:45:07,124 --> 00:45:09,625
I ain't scared!
Get your auntie!

754
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:11,793
Eddie, man, don't be so crazy.

755
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,047
I should've known your old ass
was startin' trouble.

756
00:45:15,173 --> 00:45:17,507
- Hold on, Gina.
- Oh, shit.

757
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:19,842
- lt was just a misunderstanding.
- Ain't no misunderstanding.

758
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:22,178
I should've known
you was out here actin' a fool.

759
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:27,183
I'm tryin' to teach little
Sister Souljah here some discipline.

760
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:31,438
Now, it's obvious
the way she bein' raised,

761
00:45:31,564 --> 00:45:33,898
she headed
straight for the peniten-sherary.

762
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:37,275
Raised? Maybe if you stopped
raising your hand to your mouth,

763
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:40,278
you wouldn't look like Shamu
of the South Side.

764
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:43,490
Okay. I see where you're
trying to go with it.

765
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:45,784
What kind of man
treat a little girl that way?

766
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,828
I wouldn't expect you
to know what a man is.

767
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:50,831
But l'm gonna give you a clue.

768
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:53,083
Give you a hint,
throw you a lifeline.

769
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,709
It's one of them things
you can't keep!

770
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,505
Oh, I can keep a man.
I can keep a man.

771
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,547
No, you can't.

772
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,841
I ain't want you, Calvin.
What about you?

773
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,260
The last woman you slept with
was battery-operated.

774
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,180
So? And she was white, too.

775
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,349
I had a black one, but the bitch
didn't know when to keep her mouth shut.

776
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,229
- Why's she gotta be a bitch?
- Why you gotta get up on me?

777
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,564
- Be cool, now.
- Shut up, Calvin.

778
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,691
- Who you tellin' to shut up?
- You.

779
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:23,737
Everybody get out of here,
Iittle kids and big kids.

780
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,573
I'm gonna tell you
what the problem is.

781
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,576
What's the problem?
What's the problem?

782
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,913
- You don't know your role.
- Know your role. Speak on.

783
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:35,707
Is you living
in the dark ages or something?

784
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:38,585
- Do I look like Gina Cleaver?
- Hell, no.

785
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:42,380
What's your role, watching ESPN
and holding your shit all day?

786
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:47,175
Ain't nothin' wrong with that.
Nothin' wrong with that.

787
00:46:47,301 --> 00:46:48,384
What you tryin' to say?

788
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:51,764
Get your lazy ass
off my couch and get a job.

789
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,474
Get a damn job.

790
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,933
Y'all got all the jobs.

791
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:56,895
- That's kind of true.
- Shut up, Calvin.

792
00:46:56,978 --> 00:47:00,480
You got one more time
to tell me to shut up.

793
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,649
You got a lot of nerve
charging these sisters out here

794
00:47:02,776 --> 00:47:05,944
money to get their hair did,
and you lookin' like Chewbacca.

795
00:47:08,948 --> 00:47:12,116
Don't listen to him.
You look good, girl.

796
00:47:12,201 --> 00:47:14,910
What about you?
Look at that damn 'fro.

797
00:47:14,996 --> 00:47:17,872
What you be doin',
sweepin' up the shop with it?

798
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:25,128
I do what Calvin
need me to do every now and then.

799
00:47:25,256 --> 00:47:29,341
What Calvin needs you to do is get
off your fat ass and cut some heads.

800
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:32,801
How you gonna talk about size
when you one Reese's Pieces away

801
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:34,805
from Jenny Craig yourself?

802
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:36,056
What you doin'?

803
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:40,101
I know you ain't--
Don't get in my pool.

804
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:41,352
I'm in your pool.

805
00:47:41,478 --> 00:47:44,271
Let me tell you something,
you old negro spiritual.

806
00:47:44,356 --> 00:47:46,357
Wadin' in the water

807
00:47:46,483 --> 00:47:49,443
The next time you snatch some food
out of my niece's hand,

808
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:51,069
I'm gonna kick your ass,

809
00:47:51,197 --> 00:47:53,322
and then l'm gonna burn
your freedom papers.

810
00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:55,864
And trust me,
I'm just big enough to do it.

811
00:47:55,992 --> 00:47:59,119
Can't nobody argue with that.

812
00:47:59,204 --> 00:48:01,663
Don't worry.
She ain't about to do nothin'.

813
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:06,124
I got a reputation
to keep up around here.

814
00:48:06,211 --> 00:48:08,712
And that little girl
is a devil child, now.

815
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:11,172
Look, I know she bad.
That's why you come to me.

816
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:13,800
She got to snappin'
her neck around,

817
00:48:13,884 --> 00:48:15,301
I got to get back at her.

818
00:48:15,386 --> 00:48:19,513
I'm sorry. You make sure
she get that, okay?

819
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:23,184
Put one of them links on.

820
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:25,811
- You think she want a link?
- She want a link.

821
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:28,104
Which one? Right here?

822
00:48:28,231 --> 00:48:30,565
Give me that one right there.

823
00:48:30,692 --> 00:48:32,568
Okay. You give her that, now.

824
00:48:32,694 --> 00:48:35,528
You make sure she get that
and tell her Uncle Eddie's sorry.

825
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:38,488
- Me and you cool, all right?
- Yeah, we cool.

826
00:48:38,575 --> 00:48:41,827
You got a little somethin'
right there. Get that.

827
00:48:41,911 --> 00:48:43,703
Now get your elbow.

828
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:45,580
I ain't got nothin'
on my elbow.

829
00:48:45,706 --> 00:48:48,165
Look like a gingerbread man.

830
00:48:49,168 --> 00:48:52,044
I bet that link
don't make it on the inside.

831
00:49:44,011 --> 00:49:45,720
How'd you get with a girl like that?

832
00:49:45,804 --> 00:49:48,054
Get that door
for little Calvin, Junior.

833
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:50,767
I got what they call
that savoir faire.

834
00:49:50,893 --> 00:49:52,852
She fine.

835
00:50:11,955 --> 00:50:14,789
Now, I know you ain't payin'
that nappy negro no heed.

836
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:18,418
- Why you even sweatin' it, Cal?
- That Web site's been in my head.

837
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:21,254
That Web site don't
mean nothin', Cal, man.

838
00:50:21,339 --> 00:50:24,591
Don't even tell you what
it might be like on the inside.

839
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:26,635
Come on, let's get ready
for our customers.

840
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:28,762
- Jimy, hold it there.
- All right.

841
00:50:28,846 --> 00:50:30,430
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:51:02,169 --> 00:51:03,836
What the hell goin' on?

843
00:51:07,842 --> 00:51:11,761
Since y'all wanna be funny,
no rap before 1 2:00 now.

844
00:51:11,845 --> 00:51:13,179
Come on, man.

845
00:51:14,848 --> 00:51:18,100
Y'all just clownin' up in here.

846
00:51:18,184 --> 00:51:21,018
- Eddie, where the hot wings?
- I tried to tell 'em.

847
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,731
You need a man
that's gonna take care of you.

848
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:27,901
I'm talkin' about a good man.

849
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,152
A Muslim man.

850
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:32,863
- And you that man?
- Could be.

851
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:36,325
Sorry. Once you a customer,
can't have no relations.

852
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:37,535
Bad for business.

853
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:39,288
She just had a pork chop.

854
00:51:39,413 --> 00:51:41,497
She ain't tryin' to hear nothin'
about no Nation of lslam.

855
00:51:41,623 --> 00:51:43,123
- Shut up.
- I heard that.

856
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,792
That pork be callin' me, too.

857
00:51:45,878 --> 00:51:47,420
Let me tell you somethin'.

858
00:51:47,545 --> 00:51:50,379
Nation of lslam is more
than a pork-free diet.

859
00:51:50,465 --> 00:51:53,425
It is the word of Allah
as told to the Prophet Muhamad.

860
00:51:53,551 --> 00:51:55,885
Look, all I know
is l'm down with Jesus.

861
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:59,181
Watch what you say
'cause l'm holdin' the clippers.

862
00:51:59,265 --> 00:52:01,557
- Change the subject.
- Exactly.

863
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:03,310
I got a question.

864
00:52:03,394 --> 00:52:06,479
You don't find it odd,
as a black woman,

865
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:09,106
to have a savior
who looks like Kenny G?

866
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:10,775
- Kenny G?
- That's right.

867
00:52:10,901 --> 00:52:13,360
Now, his Christmas album
was tight.

868
00:52:13,446 --> 00:52:15,405
Look, Jesus is not white.

869
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:17,698
He's Caublinasian,
Iike Tiger Woods.

870
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:20,366
And you just about workin'
my last nerve.

871
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:22,244
Pay Calvin.

872
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:25,997
Speaking of Muslims,
is Ahmad Rashad Muslim?

873
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,084
I don't ever see him wear
one of those bow ties.

874
00:52:41,263 --> 00:52:42,805
Sorry. Did I wake you?

875
00:52:44,016 --> 00:52:45,683
Late night of creepin'?

876
00:52:46,476 --> 00:52:49,269
You don't know jack
about me, girl.

877
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:54,274
You know what your problem is?

878
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:58,446
You know what onhe
of your problems is?

879
00:52:58,571 --> 00:53:00,947
- You're bitter.
- l'm through, is what I am.

880
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:05,576
That nice Terri routine?
Ain't nobody fallin' for that.

881
00:53:05,703 --> 00:53:08,788
A nice woman wouldn't
be doggin' my man Dinka.

882
00:53:08,914 --> 00:53:10,832
Dinka?
Ain't nobody doggin' him.

883
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:13,000
That boy's in love with you, girl.

884
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:16,920
But you don't want
a good man, right?

885
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:18,631
What you want, a roughneck

886
00:53:18,757 --> 00:53:21,133
to cheat on you
and slap you around?

887
00:53:21,218 --> 00:53:23,136
- What about them bitches you roll with?
- Watch your mouth.

888
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:24,553
All of them skanky as hell.

889
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:27,639
"Ooh, I met Shaniqua
in the strip club last night."

890
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:29,100
Those are nice girls?

891
00:53:29,183 --> 00:53:31,267
- You don't know everything.
- I know enough.

892
00:53:31,394 --> 00:53:33,978
Hidin' behind some tattoos
and a prison record.

893
00:53:35,606 --> 00:53:37,440
- Grow up, be a real man.
- Why you even care?!

894
00:54:16,145 --> 00:54:17,729
Show you what to do with this.

895
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,231
Take this right up here,
put it on the door,

896
00:54:20,316 --> 00:54:22,275
twist it--pop!

897
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,318
It'll put you in like Flynn.

898
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:27,571
You know what else you could do?
You get a half pound of C-4,

899
00:54:27,656 --> 00:54:30,157
put a little timer on it--
tick, tick, tick, boom!

900
00:54:30,284 --> 00:54:33,536
Blow up the whole block.
I got some at the crib.

901
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:38,707
What's goin' on?

902
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:43,210
- No.
- What?

903
00:54:43,338 --> 00:54:45,463
- Don't even think about it.
- That's what I told 'em.

904
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:47,549
I said the same thing.

905
00:54:47,674 --> 00:54:51,051
It's killin' me, man.
I just gotta know for myself.

906
00:54:51,095 --> 00:54:52,721
We not breakin' in
to Nappy Cutz.

907
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:54,722
You want to know
what's in there.

908
00:54:54,807 --> 00:54:56,391
No. The answer's no.

909
00:54:57,392 --> 00:55:01,561
We're not breakin' in.
I will not allow it.

910
00:55:04,274 --> 00:55:05,399
Hurry up.

911
00:55:05,984 --> 00:55:08,735
Five minutes.
We in, we out.

912
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,738
This is like Oceanh's Elevenh.
This is my kind of stuff.

913
00:55:11,864 --> 00:55:13,531
Check this out.

914
00:55:14,451 --> 00:55:16,827
- lt's huge!
- Size isn't everything.

915
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,118
Keep telling yourself that.

916
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:23,625
Eddie, what you doin'?

917
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,792
Didn't we come over here
to see it?

918
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,546
I can't see diddly.

919
00:55:30,924 --> 00:55:34,635
This is the joint, B!
Look at this.

920
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,887
I don't see no fish in the floor.
Where the fish at?

921
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:44,145
That's crazy!

922
00:55:44,271 --> 00:55:45,605
What?

923
00:55:48,317 --> 00:55:50,276
You can say that again.

924
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,402
- Goodness!
- What?

925
00:55:56,782 --> 00:55:58,658
You can't fry
none of that, though.

926
00:55:59,868 --> 00:56:02,118
You can play ball
up in here, man.

927
00:56:02,204 --> 00:56:04,371
No, you can play ball
down the street.

928
00:56:04,498 --> 00:56:07,875
Like a brother can't get a haircut
without trying to play some ball.

929
00:56:09,753 --> 00:56:11,545
They got the Wall Stnreet Jounrnhal.

930
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:17,925
Top of the line.

931
00:56:18,052 --> 00:56:20,720
This is what a barbershop's
supposed to look like.

932
00:56:20,846 --> 00:56:22,597
- This is leather.
- Word?

933
00:56:22,723 --> 00:56:24,474
- That's pleather.
- lt's leather.

934
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,726
It's ugly.

935
00:56:25,852 --> 00:56:30,563
Lookin' around, it's a nice shop,
but it don't have no character.

936
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,773
Exactly.

937
00:56:31,899 --> 00:56:34,275
What we got across the street
is character.

938
00:56:34,401 --> 00:56:38,653
We got character,
we got conversation, and we got...

939
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:42,241
We ain't got one of these.

940
00:56:43,577 --> 00:56:46,411
Lord have mercy!
This is pillow top!

941
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:51,082
Come on, City Hall,
show me what you got.

942
00:56:52,669 --> 00:56:54,794
You're startin' to get on my nerves.

943
00:56:56,589 --> 00:56:58,923
You're startin' to get on my nerves.

944
00:57:00,801 --> 00:57:01,926
Let's crack it.

945
00:57:02,053 --> 00:57:04,929
I checked it already.
Let's crack it.

946
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,805
You got me.

947
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:09,350
Put the ball down.

948
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:18,566
Oh, shit.

949
00:57:18,694 --> 00:57:19,986
Hey, y'all open?

950
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:21,862
No, bro, we closed.

951
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:24,572
Look at all the people.
Let me in.

952
00:57:24,658 --> 00:57:26,367
Hey, bro, we're closed.

953
00:57:26,451 --> 00:57:29,119
- Help a brother out.
- We goin' to jail.

954
00:57:29,244 --> 00:57:30,744
Two seconds, two seconds.

955
00:57:30,872 --> 00:57:33,456
- Just let him in, Big C.
- Don't let him in.

956
00:57:33,582 --> 00:57:35,999
- We can't leave him out there.
- Then let him in.

957
00:57:36,126 --> 00:57:38,210
I'm trying.
Kenard, let him in.

958
00:57:38,295 --> 00:57:41,129
Put that paper back up.

959
00:57:46,636 --> 00:57:48,637
Yes!
Hey, y'all!

960
00:57:50,056 --> 00:57:51,264
This place is nice!

961
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:54,392
We closed. Go across the street
and get your hair cut.

962
00:57:54,478 --> 00:57:58,272
Kind of raggedy over there.
Just a quick touch-up.

963
00:57:58,356 --> 00:58:01,524
I'm flying back to L.A. tonight.
How about it?

964
00:58:01,651 --> 00:58:04,485
- Who can do me?
- Not me, I got carpal tunnel.

965
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:05,779
I got you.

966
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:08,571
You got me? My man.

967
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:14,911
We got Nappy Cutz on Crenshaw.
Love it.

968
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:16,413
Everybody loves it.

969
00:58:16,498 --> 00:58:20,042
Hey, man,
get these clippers goin', player.

970
00:58:22,003 --> 00:58:23,754
These ain't supposed to be out yet.

971
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:26,672
This is German-engineered,
titanium teeth,

972
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,301
silent-whisper engine.
Listen.

973
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:33,305
- King shit.
- They just clippers.

974
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,389
This would double,
triple your business.

975
00:58:36,726 --> 00:58:39,102
You know what?
I'm gone. Have fun.

976
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:40,353
Y'all hurry up.

977
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:43,522
Don't steal nothin'
and don't break nothin'.

978
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:46,733
Just close the back door
when you leave.

979
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,699
Hey, Detective.
We was just lookin' for you.

980
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:56,326
What the hell's going on here?

981
00:58:56,453 --> 00:58:57,912
We heard something--

982
00:58:58,037 --> 00:58:59,454
You broke into Nappy Cutz?

983
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,125
- You take anything?
- No.

984
00:59:04,669 --> 00:59:06,128
- Damage anything?
- No.

985
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:08,756
Kind of nice in there?

986
00:59:09,882 --> 00:59:11,341
No.

987
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:18,638
Oh, man, they got
a basketball court!

988
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:23,852
He's beautiful, isn't he?

989
00:59:26,607 --> 00:59:30,067
I just want him to have
everything I never had.

990
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:32,985
I know you do.
And he will.

991
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:36,280
So you coming to bed?

992
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:37,657
Yeah.

993
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:46,290
You tryin' to get
something started?

994
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,834
I was hoping so,

995
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,336
but you better catch me
before the rollers go in.

996
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,841
Looks like you gonna have
a little brother or sister.

997
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:59,803
Put them rollers in.
I might like that.

998
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:03,514
I got contact lenses--blue, green,
bloodshot red--left ones only.

999
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,016
Ray!

1000
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,019
Just the man I wanted to see.
Come back and talk to me.

1001
01:00:10,272 --> 01:00:12,439
- I didn't know you was workin'.
- Come holler at me.

1002
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:16,235
How's life been treating you?

1003
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,112
It's been cool.

1004
01:00:18,238 --> 01:00:20,280
Me and my girlfriend's husband
got in a fight.

1005
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:23,408
He only won
'cause she helped him.

1006
01:00:23,534 --> 01:00:25,576
Good to see you.
Come on back.

1007
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:27,413
- ln the back-back?
- Yeah, in the back-back.

1008
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:29,748
With the scissors and everything?

1009
01:00:31,876 --> 01:00:32,834
How you been, Cal?

1010
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:33,877
You been going to church

1011
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:37,713
and living your life right
and everything?

1012
01:00:38,883 --> 01:00:41,467
- What you jumping for?
- I ain't know what you was comin' with.

1013
01:00:41,552 --> 01:00:43,178
My nerves bad.
I'm light-skinned.

1014
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:45,223
Can you get this stuff
on this list?

1015
01:00:45,306 --> 01:00:48,558
I'm looking to get high-end stuff
at low-end prices.

1016
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:50,894
- You know I can.
- Legally.

1017
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,647
You mean like with a receipt legally?
Like I ain't steal it.

1018
01:00:54,732 --> 01:00:57,900
If the police walk up,
do I gotta drop it and run?

1019
01:00:58,026 --> 01:00:59,526
I can get anything you need.

1020
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:01,486
Nappy Cutz won't know
what hit 'em.

1021
01:01:01,571 --> 01:01:03,363
This is not about Nappy Cutz.

1022
01:01:03,448 --> 01:01:08,075
This is about personal enhancement,
personal growth.

1023
01:01:08,203 --> 01:01:11,496
Expansion.
Not Nappy Cutz.

1024
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:15,124
Right.
They won't know what hit 'em.

1025
01:01:32,768 --> 01:01:35,978
Come on over here
and get your hair cut.

1026
01:01:36,103 --> 01:01:39,939
I'm working at Calvin Jr's.
Come be my first customer.

1027
01:01:40,024 --> 01:01:41,691
What you mean, "Uh-uh"?

1028
01:01:41,775 --> 01:01:43,567
Can you hook me up with lsaac?

1029
01:01:43,694 --> 01:01:45,736
The one with the "l"
cut in the back?

1030
01:01:45,821 --> 01:01:49,948
You got a 'fro! You can't be gettin'
the "l" cut in the back.

1031
01:01:50,076 --> 01:01:52,660
Condoleezza. With all that
White House money she makin',

1032
01:01:52,786 --> 01:01:54,787
you'd think she could
afford herself a makeover.

1033
01:01:54,914 --> 01:01:58,541
If I was in the White House,
I'd be fly all the time.

1034
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:01,752
If you was in the White House,
you'd be ghetto as hell.

1035
01:02:01,837 --> 01:02:04,004
She'd have the president
all corn-rowed out,

1036
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,881
talking about,
"U.S., fool. U.S., fool."

1037
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:08,301
The president would be a thug.

1038
01:02:08,385 --> 01:02:10,635
She think a head of state's
a sexual position.

1039
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:13,430
"l'm inviting heads of state today."

1040
01:02:16,642 --> 01:02:17,976
Oh, my God.

1041
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:19,769
Please stop.

1042
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:27,818
Gina, do I look like Beyoncé?

1043
01:02:30,865 --> 01:02:31,907
Just like her.

1044
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:34,824
I knew you was gonna say that.
Give me some.

1045
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,202
This is like the world
coming together,

1046
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:41,123
Iike all the gangs
coming together.

1047
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:43,917
There's beauty in there.
You gotta love it, man.

1048
01:02:44,002 --> 01:02:46,211
This came
from my grandmama church.

1049
01:02:46,337 --> 01:02:48,296
They might want that back.

1050
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,548
Who's been chewing on this thing?
It look like Holyfield's ear.

1051
01:02:52,426 --> 01:02:53,551
Picture and picture.

1052
01:02:53,678 --> 01:02:58,013
This one get channels 2 through 5,
and this one get 9 through 1 3.

1053
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,016
Give me the big one.

1054
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:03,434
Take the little one, too.
You got to take the little one.

1055
01:03:03,521 --> 01:03:07,065
- You keep it.
- Cal, you gotta get this little one.

1056
01:03:07,191 --> 01:03:08,566
Come on, Cal!

1057
01:03:08,692 --> 01:03:10,651
Thought l'd add
a little style to the place.

1058
01:03:12,905 --> 01:03:15,322
That's that Picassio stuff
right there.

1059
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:17,366
Yeah, yeah.

1060
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:19,159
Beautiful.

1061
01:03:20,537 --> 01:03:22,037
What is it, a uterus?

1062
01:03:24,373 --> 01:03:27,792
Calvin, I hooked you up
with the alderman.

1063
01:03:27,876 --> 01:03:30,001
What'd you do,
get me some handicapped plates?

1064
01:03:30,128 --> 01:03:32,837
Better. You're gonna be
on the news.

1065
01:03:32,965 --> 01:03:34,048
The news?

1066
01:03:34,174 --> 01:03:36,424
The alderman's taking
a walking tour of the block

1067
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:37,426
before Friday's
city council meeting

1068
01:03:38,846 --> 01:03:41,055
to let the constituency know
that he's concerned.

1069
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:44,849
Concerned?
About November, right?

1070
01:03:44,977 --> 01:03:47,937
I talked him into
talking to you--good publicity.

1071
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,521
- You could've asked me first.
- I know.

1072
01:03:50,648 --> 01:03:53,149
But it was
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

1073
01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:56,277
We don't do politics in here.
It's a place of business.

1074
01:03:56,362 --> 01:03:57,946
This ain't no comunity center.

1075
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,155
You know what?

1076
01:03:59,282 --> 01:04:02,659
You sound just like
your daddy right now.

1077
01:04:02,743 --> 01:04:05,536
We will not be silenced.

1078
01:04:05,663 --> 01:04:07,997
When the FBl
gassed the Black Panthers out,

1079
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:11,333
we found a place
to be today.

1080
01:04:12,168 --> 01:04:14,293
Thank you, Brother Calvin.

1081
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:15,755
Brother Calvin!

1082
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:19,091
We will continue to provide
books and classes,

1083
01:04:19,218 --> 01:04:21,886
food and clothing
through our outreach program.

1084
01:04:22,011 --> 01:04:23,136
That's right, brother.

1085
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:25,805
And when the pigs show up,
they're gonna show up with guns.

1086
01:04:25,932 --> 01:04:29,059
We ain't gonna do nothin'
but show up with ounr guns!

1087
01:04:29,143 --> 01:04:32,854
Then they gonna start shootin'.
Then we gonna start shootin'!

1088
01:04:32,939 --> 01:04:34,273
That's right, brother!

1089
01:04:34,398 --> 01:04:37,650
I'm tellin' you, every last
one of them's gonna get shot!

1090
01:04:37,777 --> 01:04:39,277
That's right.

1091
01:04:39,403 --> 01:04:41,862
Then all of us
is gonna get shot!

1092
01:04:42,739 --> 01:04:44,490
And all of us
is gonna die together!

1093
01:04:47,285 --> 01:04:49,327
Let's make it happen!

1094
01:04:49,455 --> 01:04:50,705
Black power!

1095
01:04:50,914 --> 01:04:52,289
Black power!

1096
01:04:52,415 --> 01:04:54,166
Black power! Yeah!

1097
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,792
Black power!
That's us! Black power!

1098
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,087
Power to the people!

1099
01:04:59,297 --> 01:05:01,714
Shit, man, them fools crazy.

1100
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:04,717
Well, if it ain't Lalowe Sharpton.

1101
01:05:06,012 --> 01:05:07,679
My goodness, my goodness.

1102
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:11,056
The barbershop.
How you doin'? Lalowe Brown.

1103
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:12,391
Checker Fred, sir.

1104
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,476
How you doin', Checker?

1105
01:05:14,603 --> 01:05:16,770
Lalowe Brown.
Good to see you.

1106
01:05:16,855 --> 01:05:18,147
How you doin', sir?

1107
01:05:18,272 --> 01:05:21,899
My, my.
Well, well, look at this.

1108
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:24,195
Look what we got--
we got a lady barber.

1109
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,447
We didn't have this
back in the day.

1110
01:05:27,574 --> 01:05:29,033
- What's your name?
- Terri.

1111
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:30,950
- Sarah?
- Terri.

1112
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:35,747
Lalowe's gonna have to come back
and let you give me a little trim.

1113
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:37,708
- Trim?
- A haircut.

1114
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:40,877
Terri, if you wanna be down,

1115
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:43,379
vote Lalowe Brown.

1116
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:45,090
You remember that.

1117
01:05:47,342 --> 01:05:49,884
This is Calvin's Barbershop.

1118
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:53,139
This is a cornerstone
of the black comunity

1119
01:05:53,265 --> 01:05:55,099
for some 40-odd years.

1120
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:57,601
I've been coming down here
many a Saturday afternoon,

1121
01:05:57,686 --> 01:05:59,478
get myself straight
for Sunday morning.

1122
01:05:59,604 --> 01:06:02,313
But I wanna introduce you
to the man himself,

1123
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:06,151
the man who quantifies
and epitomizes

1124
01:06:06,235 --> 01:06:10,196
the institutional possibilities
of black hair.

1125
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:15,033
He is a potentiating progenitor
in all kinds of fine ways.

1126
01:06:15,161 --> 01:06:19,122
He's my fine friend,
this brother right here, Calvin.

1127
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:20,790
How you doin'?
Calvin Palmer.

1128
01:06:20,874 --> 01:06:23,416
- How you doin', son?
- All right.

1129
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:26,878
Calvin, you are a pillar
of this fine comunity.

1130
01:06:27,005 --> 01:06:28,923
How is everything going for you

1131
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:31,590
with all this social change
happening down here?

1132
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:35,054
Well, Mr. Brown, as you know,
there is a lot of change--

1133
01:06:35,179 --> 01:06:37,805
There is a lot of change,

1134
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:39,809
and change
is hard sometimes, right?

1135
01:06:39,893 --> 01:06:44,187
But if we want to stand
together as a comunity,

1136
01:06:44,313 --> 01:06:47,106
- we will find a way to survive.
- Tell it!

1137
01:06:47,232 --> 01:06:48,399
- Tell it, Lo.
- That's right.

1138
01:06:48,525 --> 01:06:51,276
You let Lalowe lay it down for you.

1139
01:06:51,403 --> 01:06:53,279
If you wanna stay afloat,

1140
01:06:53,405 --> 01:06:54,780
we got to...

1141
01:06:57,034 --> 01:06:59,243
...you gonna have to
rock the boat.

1142
01:06:59,369 --> 01:07:03,330
Because if they want
to send us packin',

1143
01:07:03,457 --> 01:07:04,916
baby, it's on and crackin'!

1144
01:07:05,041 --> 01:07:07,542
And if they try to mess
with this brother,

1145
01:07:07,669 --> 01:07:10,295
then it's gonna be on
Iike a mother!

1146
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:13,340
That's a little rough.

1147
01:07:13,425 --> 01:07:16,510
If you want to stay around,
y'all know what you gotta do.

1148
01:07:16,593 --> 01:07:18,927
Vote for Lalowe Brown!

1149
01:07:20,556 --> 01:07:24,016
Hey, Calvin, why don't you
get me a little shape-up?

1150
01:07:24,101 --> 01:07:26,102
'Cause l've been running around.

1151
01:07:26,229 --> 01:07:28,438
- You got a chair for me?
- Yeah, right here.

1152
01:07:28,563 --> 01:07:32,232
Of course we got one for you.
Kenard! Kenard!

1153
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:35,860
- Let Kenard cut your hair.
- Hold on, hold on.

1154
01:07:35,945 --> 01:07:37,946
Wait a minute. No.

1155
01:07:38,073 --> 01:07:41,241
Get on over there, Get-low.
Sit right on down, So-low.

1156
01:07:41,325 --> 01:07:43,326
Nice to meet you.
How you doin'?

1157
01:07:43,453 --> 01:07:46,329
- Wait a minute.
- lt's okay. lt's okay.

1158
01:07:46,455 --> 01:07:48,497
It's okay. lt's okay.

1159
01:07:49,082 --> 01:07:53,125
Kenard here is one
of our prima donna barbers.

1160
01:07:53,253 --> 01:07:54,253
Front chair.

1161
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:58,257
You ain't had
your hair cut till...

1162
01:07:58,342 --> 01:07:59,717
- Kenard.
- Yeah.

1163
01:07:59,801 --> 01:08:03,762
- Yeah. Let's take a picture.
- Thank you, brother.

1164
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:09,892
Yeah, okay. All right.
Enjoy yourself, Low-below.

1165
01:08:09,978 --> 01:08:12,270
You just relax, Down-low.

1166
01:08:12,397 --> 01:08:14,273
We on TV, man.

1167
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:18,110
I know. This is must-see TV.
It's gonna be good.

1168
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,821
This is why
I love this comunity,

1169
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:25,575
'cause there's a historical context
for every action that takes place here.

1170
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,661
I plan to die here.

1171
01:08:27,787 --> 01:08:30,455
We're running short on time.
If we could speed this up?

1172
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,081
You can't rush the best, Jimy.

1173
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:36,084
- He ain't the best.
- He ain't ask you, man.

1174
01:08:37,504 --> 01:08:40,338
Well, who's the best, then,
youngblood?

1175
01:08:41,507 --> 01:08:45,218
- You the best?
- No doubt. lsaac Rosenberg.

1176
01:08:45,345 --> 01:08:48,054
The best barber
in the state of lllinois.

1177
01:08:48,181 --> 01:08:50,265
The best barber
on this rock we call Earth.

1178
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:51,850
Come on down to Cal's.

1179
01:08:51,976 --> 01:08:53,685
Our rainbow coalition right here.

1180
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:56,896
Yeah, this is integration
right here.

1181
01:08:57,022 --> 01:08:58,397
What's up, Ma? Richie?

1182
01:08:58,524 --> 01:09:00,566
You're feelin' yourself
way too much.

1183
01:09:00,692 --> 01:09:02,318
Don't sweat the technique.

1184
01:09:02,445 --> 01:09:05,029
What technique?
You cut like a bitch.

1185
01:09:05,155 --> 01:09:07,280
Carvin' l's in the back
of people's head?

1186
01:09:07,366 --> 01:09:09,783
- Your skills is limited.
- My skills are limited?

1187
01:09:09,868 --> 01:09:12,202
- Where your skills at?
- This ain't the time.

1188
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:15,456
Ain't in cuttin' hair.
Must be slobbin' Terri in the locker room.

1189
01:09:16,999 --> 01:09:18,166
What? No.

1190
01:09:20,379 --> 01:09:24,048
You ain't supposed to air our
dirty laundry like that. We on TV.

1191
01:09:24,173 --> 01:09:26,507
- What is he talking about?
- Dinka, it wasn't like that.

1192
01:09:26,635 --> 01:09:28,719
...of populist politics.

1193
01:09:28,844 --> 01:09:31,762
- Thug love! Thug love!
- lt was not like that.

1194
01:09:31,889 --> 01:09:34,265
Everybody's hatin' on me.
'Cause l'm competent?

1195
01:09:34,392 --> 01:09:36,684
- You don't make this shop.
- I have lately.

1196
01:09:36,809 --> 01:09:40,728
I will confront all of those
forces that are trying to change,

1197
01:09:40,855 --> 01:09:42,897
that are trying
to make things happen.

1198
01:09:43,024 --> 01:09:45,692
They don't treat barbers
Iike this at Nappy Cutz.

1199
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:47,737
Why don't you go find out?

1200
01:09:47,862 --> 01:09:50,530
You on that bullshit.
Go find out.

1201
01:09:50,657 --> 01:09:53,742
We don't need you around here
if you don't wanna be here.

1202
01:09:53,868 --> 01:09:55,452
Fine, man.

1203
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:58,747
All right.
Get out of the chair, man.

1204
01:09:58,872 --> 01:09:59,788
No, you stay here.

1205
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:05,169
In November, I plan to establish
this barbershop as my headquarters.

1206
01:10:05,253 --> 01:10:08,296
At Calvin's Barbershop,
we're gonna make this institution

1207
01:10:08,424 --> 01:10:12,009
one of the leading institutions,
Iike a torpedo moving towards the future.

1208
01:10:12,135 --> 01:10:13,761
Yes, indeed. All right.

1209
01:10:13,846 --> 01:10:16,305
Kenard, just a little off the top.

1210
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:19,058
I really think it's time
for us to move along.

1211
01:10:19,183 --> 01:10:21,642
Come on, Jimy,
just two seconds.

1212
01:10:28,192 --> 01:10:30,985
My bad, brother.
I skipped you.

1213
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:33,361
Why don't you just let me
fade you up?

1214
01:10:33,489 --> 01:10:35,573
- How about a nice Quo Vadis?
- What'd you do to my head?

1215
01:10:37,284 --> 01:10:38,951
- Don't even look at that.
- ls that my head?

1216
01:10:39,077 --> 01:10:42,954
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

1217
01:10:43,081 --> 01:10:44,707
You a grown man!

1218
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:47,585
You don't do that to Kenard!

1219
01:10:47,669 --> 01:10:49,503
Get out of here!

1220
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,096
Anhd fanr fnrom its nroots

1221

1227
01:11:19,282 --> 01:11:20,657
Nice.

1228
01:11:35,965 --> 01:11:38,299
- Who is it?
- lt's Rick.

1229
01:11:38,384 --> 01:11:39,801
What do you want?

1230
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:42,219
I wanna talk to you.
I feel bad.

1231
01:11:42,346 --> 01:11:43,763
Good. l'm busy.

1232
01:11:43,848 --> 01:11:46,057
Open the door.
We gotta talk about this.

1233
01:11:46,183 --> 01:11:49,518
- There's nothing to discuss.
- Dinka, I messed up.

1234
01:11:50,604 --> 01:11:54,356
What happened
between me and Terri was foul.

1235
01:11:54,482 --> 01:11:57,692
It should have never happened.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1236
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:01,113
I'm sorry.

1237
01:12:03,616 --> 01:12:05,575
Apology accepted.

1238
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:08,201
Can we discuss this tomorrow?

1239
01:12:08,788 --> 01:12:11,038
You remember Shawna, right?

1240
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:13,208
Hi.

1241
01:12:14,252 --> 01:12:15,377
What's up, Shawna?

1242
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:19,088
Handle that.

1243
01:12:19,632 --> 01:12:21,091
I'll get at you tomorrow.

1244
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:23,008
Maybe the day after.

1245
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:18,519
You should see her
when l'm drinkin'.

1246
01:13:20,523 --> 01:13:22,357
'Cause I know her.

1247
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:26,818
Exactly right, exactly right.

1248
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:33,367
What are you doing here?

1249
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:35,743
The question is,
what you doin' here?

1250
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,412
Look a little shady to me.

1251
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,833
You come up to my shop today

1252
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,084
and got the nerve
to be huddled up with this shark.

1253
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:47,214
Don't come in here accusing me
of some malicious and egregious act

1254
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:49,465
when what you should be doin'
is apologizing

1255
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,176
for making me look
Iike a goddamn fool today.

1256
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,845
- That's what you should be doing.
- Lalowe.

1257
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,684
Ease up. lt's cool.

1258
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,978
All right there, youngblood.

1259
01:14:04,147 --> 01:14:07,607
Ain't nothin' going on in here,
just business.

1260
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,444
- l'll bet.
- lt's true.

1261
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:13,571
In fact, the alderman and l
were just talking about you.

1262
01:14:13,656 --> 01:14:15,031
Well, about your business.

1263
01:14:15,658 --> 01:14:18,868
I undervalued the importance
of your shop to this comunity.

1264
01:14:18,953 --> 01:14:20,620
That's my bad.

1265
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,582
It'd be a shame to see it
all go away for naught.

1266
01:14:23,665 --> 01:14:26,750
Man, l'm from the South Side.

1267
01:14:26,878 --> 01:14:27,878
- Don't try to hustle me.
- No hustle.

1268
01:14:29,213 --> 01:14:31,839
A hustle implies one side wins,
the other side loses.

1269
01:14:31,924 --> 01:14:33,925
I'm proposing a win-win.

1270
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:37,218
I'm proposing that Nappy Cutz
never sees the light of day.

1271
01:14:38,722 --> 01:14:42,015
- ls that right?
- l'll turn it into a nightclub.

1272
01:14:42,099 --> 01:14:44,516
Your barbershop
will continue to thrive

1273
01:14:44,603 --> 01:14:48,522
without any interference from me
or from anyone else.

1274
01:14:48,606 --> 01:14:50,690
And this miracle happens
if I do what?

1275
01:14:50,817 --> 01:14:53,067
Not tell people
what I saw here tonight?

1276
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:57,030
What'd you see tonight?

1277
01:14:57,698 --> 01:15:01,492
What'd you see in here
tonight, Calvin? Nothing.

1278
01:15:01,576 --> 01:15:03,076
Nothing.

1279
01:15:04,872 --> 01:15:06,039
Have a seat.

1280
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,044
No, l'd rather stand.

1281
01:15:11,752 --> 01:15:13,711
All you have to do is talk.

1282
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,549
The city council meeting
is tomorrow.

1283
01:15:17,675 --> 01:15:21,844
We need those other
business owners on your block to sell.

1284
01:15:21,929 --> 01:15:23,805
If you were to express to them

1285
01:15:23,931 --> 01:15:26,932
and to the governing board that you
believe in Quality Land's proposal,

1286
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,270
your voice could be
the determining factor.

1287
01:15:30,771 --> 01:15:32,438
At least, I think so.

1288
01:15:37,736 --> 01:15:41,613
This could be a shitload of money
for the whole district.

1289
01:15:41,739 --> 01:15:44,323
Not to mention, it could be
a nice little windfall for Calvin.

1290
01:15:45,785 --> 01:15:46,701
A $200,000 windfall.

1291
01:15:50,707 --> 01:15:53,541
Now, that's a nice piece
of pocket change.

1292
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:58,253
You could take your wife
on down to Jamaica.

1293
01:15:58,381 --> 01:16:00,923
The real one,
not that one in Queens.

1294
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:03,801
It'd be a nice kick-start
to your kid's college fund.

1295
01:16:03,886 --> 01:16:06,011
You have a son, don't you?

1296
01:16:07,055 --> 01:16:08,931
Yeah, I got a son.

1297
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,352
All you gotta do is talk.

1298
01:16:16,898 --> 01:16:18,524
$200,000.

1299
01:16:19,484 --> 01:16:22,569
I'm not asking you
for a whole lot, just to...

1300
01:16:22,695 --> 01:16:24,487
come on down and...

1301
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:28,700
...just talk.

1302
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,243
Just talk.

1303
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:41,712
All right.

1304
01:16:43,423 --> 01:16:45,007
See you tomorrow.

1305
01:16:50,889 --> 01:16:52,389
Win-win.

1306
01:17:17,623 --> 01:17:18,539
You stalking me?

1307
01:17:18,665 --> 01:17:21,041
- Just wanna talk.
- Ain't nothin' to say.

1308
01:17:25,755 --> 01:17:27,631
Let me drive you to work.

1309
01:17:27,716 --> 01:17:31,051
How am I gonna look
rollin' up in your freak-mobile?

1310
01:17:31,177 --> 01:17:34,804
Terri, we work together.
We need to have a conversation.

1311
01:17:35,515 --> 01:17:37,015
Listen to what I got to say.

1312
01:17:37,141 --> 01:17:40,434
After that, you ain't got to
speak to me ever again.

1313
01:17:43,021 --> 01:17:45,522
I'll drop you off around the corner.

1314
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:48,359
Get in the car.

1315
01:17:49,694 --> 01:17:51,111
Please.

1316
01:17:56,076 --> 01:17:58,493
Terri, I really ain't
been myself lately.

1317
01:17:58,578 --> 01:18:02,955
Ricky, before you even say anything,
I need you to know

1318
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:05,500
that thug-gangta-player
bullshit is over for me.

1319
01:18:05,585 --> 01:18:06,209
I'm done with that in my life.

1320
01:18:08,004 --> 01:18:10,630
But you don't even know me,
what l'm about.

1321
01:18:10,756 --> 01:18:12,298
I see you every day--

1322
01:18:12,424 --> 01:18:14,841
Iate, sleepin'
in the locker room,

1323
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:16,344
runnin' ho's day and night.

1324
01:18:16,428 --> 01:18:18,720
How is that not knowing you?

1325
01:18:19,598 --> 01:18:20,598
Boy!

1326
01:18:22,058 --> 01:18:22,891
I'm just gettin'
my backpack. Relax.

1327
01:18:27,064 --> 01:18:29,065
What is this, a warrant?

1328
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:46,498
Why didn't you say anything?

1329
01:18:46,623 --> 01:18:49,583
I couldn't tell nobody I was
studying for the fuckin' GED.

1330
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:50,918
It's embarrassing.

1331
01:18:51,796 --> 01:18:53,088
But you passed.

1332
01:18:54,589 --> 01:18:55,547
Yeah.

1333
01:18:57,635 --> 01:19:01,179
Yeah, but honestly, though,
now that I got it,

1334
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:03,763
I don't even know what it means.

1335
01:19:03,891 --> 01:19:06,058
It means you give a damn
about your life.

1336
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,102
You should be proud.

1337
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:13,065
I'm proud of you.

1338
01:19:14,859 --> 01:19:17,527
Don't start paying me
compliments and stuff,

1339
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:19,612
'cause then I gotta
give one back to you.

1340
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:24,365
We'd be all over each other again,
and don't nobody want that.

1341
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:25,617
I don't want it.

1342
01:19:33,836 --> 01:19:35,462
For the record...

1343
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:41,924
I kind of liked the old Terri
before all the changes.

1344
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:44,552
Loud and angry all the time?

1345
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:45,804
Real.

1346
01:19:46,931 --> 01:19:49,140
All the time.

1347
01:20:06,782 --> 01:20:08,616
Man, I hope you hittin' that!

1348
01:20:10,203 --> 01:20:12,620
Miss Ema, is somethin' wrong?

1349
01:20:12,705 --> 01:20:16,416
Nothing a little prayer
can't handle, or my pistol.

1350
01:20:16,542 --> 01:20:17,834
What's the matter?

1351
01:20:17,919 --> 01:20:21,880
They wanna make this
funky little place into a co-op.

1352
01:20:22,006 --> 01:20:23,381
What?

1353
01:20:23,966 --> 01:20:26,884
I can't afford that down payment.
I'm gonna have to move.

1354
01:20:27,011 --> 01:20:29,261
Don't you own this place?

1355
01:20:29,388 --> 01:20:31,472
Just because I don't own it
don't mean it's not mine.

1356
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:39,812
You've been livin' here, like, what?

1357
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:44,067
A long time, long enough
to wipe your nasty little butt.

1358
01:20:44,153 --> 01:20:46,737
And a whole lot
of others, too.

1359
01:20:46,821 --> 01:20:47,612
But it's been worth it, though.

1360
01:20:50,117 --> 01:20:52,326
We can't lose you, Miss Ema.

1361
01:20:52,409 --> 01:20:56,036
It's about time
for me to retire anyway.

1362
01:20:56,164 --> 01:20:59,374
My brother has a nice place
out in Arizona.

1363
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:00,875
You ever been to Arizona?

1364
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:05,211
Hot as hell,
but I got some nice hats.

1365
01:21:06,215 --> 01:21:08,340
How can you leave Chicago?

1366
01:21:08,426 --> 01:21:10,177
On the bus.

1367
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,552
Same way I got here.

1368
01:21:23,898 --> 01:21:25,732
Good morning there, youngblood.

1369
01:21:25,816 --> 01:21:28,901
You up early.
They fumigating your crib again?

1370
01:21:28,986 --> 01:21:32,780
I thought it'd be a good day
to walk and see the trees and dew.

1371
01:21:32,906 --> 01:21:34,323
Yeah, they fumigating.

1372
01:21:34,450 --> 01:21:38,286
I had a cockroach in my house
so big, I thought it was Shaq.

1373
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:41,913
You're crazy.

1374
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:45,292
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1375
01:21:47,128 --> 01:21:49,253
You done worked and lived
around here for what, 34, 35 years?

1376
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:53,132
Yeah, I guess 30 and some change.

1377
01:21:53,217 --> 01:21:55,009
I ain't tryin' to clown, but--

1378
01:21:55,094 --> 01:22:00,306
I hope not. You know I got jokes.
Don't you start nothin'.

1379
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:02,975
Let me ask you--
is this the life you wanted?

1380
01:22:04,228 --> 01:22:06,270
Or did you ever think
you could do better?

1381
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:11,316
What the hell keeps you
comin' back here every day?

1382
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:15,195
Well, Calvin, you know,
if I was a bettin' man,

1383
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,657
I'd say the reason I come back in
day in and day out

1384
01:22:18,741 --> 01:22:21,868
is the free chair.

1385
01:22:24,663 --> 01:22:25,830
Get real.

1386
01:22:30,044 --> 01:22:31,920
Hold it!
Get off him, pig!

1387
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:35,715
...some venry sad nhews
fonr all of you.

1388
01:22:35,799 --> 01:22:39,884
anhd that is that Mantinh Luthenr Kinhg
was shot anhd was killed tonhight

1389
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:41,846
inh Memphis. Tenhnhessee.

1390
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:44,931
hnh this difficult day.

1391
01:22:45,058 --> 01:22:47,308
inh this difficult time
fonr the Unhited States.

1392
01:22:47,435 --> 01:22:50,895
it's penrhaps well to ask
what kinhd of a nhationh we anre...

1393
01:22:51,022 --> 01:22:52,731
This ain't right.

1394
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:56,359
We should be honoring the man's
memory, we shouldn't be doing this.

1395
01:22:56,445 --> 01:22:59,029
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

1396
01:23:00,822 --> 01:23:04,865
I'm gonna get on out of here.
I need to go check on Loretta.

1397
01:23:05,494 --> 01:23:07,703
She's talking about
moving back to Georgia.

1398
01:23:07,788 --> 01:23:11,707
h would onhly say
that h canh also feel inh my ownh heant

1399
01:23:11,792 --> 01:23:13,959
the same kinhd of feelinhg.

1400
01:23:14,085 --> 01:23:16,419
h had a membenr
of my family killed.

1401
01:23:17,672 --> 01:23:19,673
But he was killed
by a white manh.

1402
01:23:19,799 --> 01:23:22,675
What we nheed
inh the Unhited States...

1403
01:23:26,598 --> 01:23:28,516
You be safe out there.

1404
01:23:28,642 --> 01:23:31,560
Yeah, I will, man.
Don't worry about me.

1405
01:23:31,644 --> 01:23:33,978
I'll probably
stop by Montgomery Ward's,

1406
01:23:34,105 --> 01:23:36,439
pick up a TV,
washer and dryer, lamps.

1407
01:23:36,566 --> 01:23:37,858
You need anything?

1408
01:23:41,653 --> 01:23:44,029
- Move, Eddie!
- No!

1409
01:23:44,156 --> 01:23:46,240
- Eddie, get out of there!
- No!

1410
01:23:46,825 --> 01:23:47,783
No!

1411
01:24:00,963 --> 01:24:02,964
I'll stay a little while longer, man.

1412
01:24:08,971 --> 01:24:11,639
Yeah, so after all that
quieted down,

1413
01:24:11,765 --> 01:24:15,100
your daddy told me I ain't never
have to pay for my chair again.

1414
01:24:15,895 --> 01:24:18,563
That's the kind of man
your father was.

1415
01:24:18,689 --> 01:24:20,690
He was a man's man.

1416
01:24:20,817 --> 01:24:22,984
He used to always
call me a hero.

1417
01:24:24,027 --> 01:24:27,529
The funny thing is
I never saw it that way.

1418
01:24:27,656 --> 01:24:30,824
I didn't save the shop, Calvin.
The shop saved me.

1419
01:24:30,909 --> 01:24:33,368
A lot like it did for Ricky.

1420
01:24:33,494 --> 01:24:36,245
I ain't have no life before this.

1421
01:24:37,623 --> 01:24:40,416
As far as l'm concerned,
my life began

1422
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:44,254
on July 4, 1967,
when I came through that back door

1423
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:46,464
and your father gave
my black ass a break.

1424
01:24:46,549 --> 01:24:50,260
So l'd be sad if somethin'
was to ever happen to this place.

1425
01:24:51,929 --> 01:24:52,637
But l'd be all right, though.

1426
01:24:54,055 --> 01:24:56,389
Oh, yeah, Eddie be fine.

1427
01:24:57,976 --> 01:24:59,184
Hey, what's up, y'all?

1428
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:01,978
Calvin, can I have a word
with you for a second?

1429
01:25:02,104 --> 01:25:03,271
What you want, man?

1430
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:06,441
Well, I know these are
tough times for you, cuz.

1431
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:11,321
It's times like these when men
must rise up and make the right choice.

1432
01:25:11,447 --> 01:25:14,281
- ls that right?
- Yeah. lt's about the truth.

1433
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:17,118
Each and every one of us
has our own truth,

1434
01:25:17,202 --> 01:25:21,496
a truth that we must live with
for the rest of our lives.

1435
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:23,792
Is there a point to this?

1436
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:25,751
My truth is across the street.

1437
01:25:25,835 --> 01:25:29,546
I appreciate the job, cuz.
I'll always love you for it.

1438
01:25:29,672 --> 01:25:30,922
But I gotta bounce.

1439
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:34,635
Y'all goin' broke
around this mug. Boy, I swear.

1440
01:25:37,763 --> 01:25:38,971
All right, all right.

1441
01:25:39,057 --> 01:25:42,058
And if anybody wanna come over
anytime and hoop it up,

1442
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:44,393
ring a player, you know?

1443
01:25:49,357 --> 01:25:50,816
All this silence
got my gut grumblin'.

1444
01:25:50,944 --> 01:25:53,069
I'm gonna run down to Berry's,
get me a pastrami and fries.

1445
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:57,530
Eddie, a man at your age
should be watching what he eats.

1446
01:25:57,616 --> 01:26:00,409
If you don't knock the fork
out of my hand,

1447
01:26:00,494 --> 01:26:02,870
I won't knock the spear
out of yours, okay, Somalia?

1448
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:07,416
Eddie, get me that chicken tamale
and strawberry shake special.

1449
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,834
Get old Checkers a ham and cheese
on some honky bread,

1450
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:11,879
mustard, hold the mayo.

1451
01:26:11,963 --> 01:26:14,088
Get me a Mountain Dew
and chopped salad.

1452
01:26:14,215 --> 01:26:17,216
I'll take some chili fries,
onion rings,

1453
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:19,177
and a pot pie with egg on it.

1454
01:26:19,302 --> 01:26:23,804
Okay, that's gonna be
three orders of "Hell, no"

1455
01:26:23,932 --> 01:26:26,057
and two sides
of "Ask your mama"

1456
01:26:26,142 --> 01:26:29,936
and a large cup
of "Negro, please."

1457
01:26:30,063 --> 01:26:31,438
Grumpy old man.

1458
01:26:33,567 --> 01:26:35,318
Hey, Big C, where you headed?

1459
01:26:35,443 --> 01:26:38,277
Nowhere.
Just got a little business to handle.

1460
01:26:38,362 --> 01:26:39,612
I'll be back.

1461
01:27:09,434 --> 01:27:11,143
And when they build all this stuff,

1462
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:13,188
they make it totally unaffordable

1463
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:15,980
for the people
who live here to stay here.

1464
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:20,318
Now, we're South Side people
with South Side money,

1465
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:21,652
and that ain't much.

1466
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:26,907
So l'm against the proposed
Quality Land development project

1467
01:27:27,035 --> 01:27:30,162
on 79th and Exchange.

1468
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:35,249
You tell it, sister!

1469
01:27:35,376 --> 01:27:37,752
That's right!
Very good!

1470
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:39,044
That's right!

1471
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:41,047
Quiet. Okay.

1472
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,633
Before we adjourn
and make our decision,

1473
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:49,637
is there anyone else who'd like
to be heard on this matter?

1474
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:54,018
Let's get this thing over with.

1475
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:57,145
I'd like to say somethin'.

1476
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,315
Sir.

1477
01:28:10,659 --> 01:28:13,160
- What's he gonna say?
- Shut up. Shut up.

1478
01:28:18,541 --> 01:28:20,000
A little nervous.

1479
01:28:22,837 --> 01:28:26,047
I haven't felt like this
since I met my wife's pops.

1480
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,681
My name is Calvin Palmer.

1481
01:28:34,807 --> 01:28:37,975
I own Calvin's Barbershop
over on 79th.

1482
01:28:38,101 --> 01:28:40,810
Been there since 1958.

1483
01:28:41,646 --> 01:28:46,357
And all l'd like to say
is that all change isn't bad.

1484
01:28:46,443 --> 01:28:48,235
Who can argue with progress?

1485
01:28:49,112 --> 01:28:51,946
Better schools, cleaner streets--

1486
01:28:52,073 --> 01:28:54,782
something we need
on the South Side.

1487
01:28:54,909 --> 01:28:57,243
And I want the best for my son

1488
01:28:57,329 --> 01:29:00,748
just like my parents
wanted the best for me.

1489
01:29:00,831 --> 01:29:03,373
So some change on 79th

1490
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:06,211
is well-needed
and well-deserved.

1491
01:29:06,295 --> 01:29:07,378
Oh, yeah.

1492
01:29:09,299 --> 01:29:12,676
Also, l'm happy that people
outside our comunity

1493
01:29:12,801 --> 01:29:16,970
are starting to find the value
in our neighborhoods.

1494
01:29:17,097 --> 01:29:19,056
But...

1495
01:29:19,182 --> 01:29:22,809
if that means selling our soul
just to make a quick buck,

1496
01:29:22,936 --> 01:29:25,061
I ain't with that shit.

1497
01:29:29,984 --> 01:29:31,401
It's not worth it.

1498
01:29:31,985 --> 01:29:35,362
That's why l'm not sellin' out...

1499
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,201
...like some people I know.

1500
01:29:48,126 --> 01:29:50,460
Sir, do you know
why Jesus wept?

1501
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,758
No. No, I don't.

1502
01:29:55,883 --> 01:30:00,802
Well, when Lazarus died,

1503
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:04,849
Martha and Mary,
they cried over his body.

1504
01:30:04,976 --> 01:30:07,018
When Jesus saw their pain,

1505
01:30:07,103 --> 01:30:09,187
he couldn't help but cry, too.

1506
01:30:10,314 --> 01:30:11,981
So that's why Jesus wept.

1507
01:30:14,109 --> 01:30:17,736
That's how I feel when I look
at people like Hank Tolliver

1508
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:20,238
and Gertrude Rose

1509
01:30:20,323 --> 01:30:23,491
and Miss Ema
bein' driven out...

1510
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:28,913
...'cause they don't fit the plan
of the new developers.

1511
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:34,001
We gotta realize that people
make this comunity,

1512
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:37,296
not $5 coffees
and $20 mugs.

1513
01:30:37,423 --> 01:30:38,882
It's the people.

1514
01:30:39,008 --> 01:30:43,218
And once you lose the people,
you lose the neighborhood.

1515
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:45,846
So if I had to say,
I would deny

1516
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:50,892
Quality Land Development's
proposal to tear up 79th

1517
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:53,062
because it just ain't worth it.

1518
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,522
Thank you.

1519
01:30:56,232 --> 01:30:59,192
That's my friend!
That's my friend!

1520
01:31:09,037 --> 01:31:13,331
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

1521
01:31:14,499 --> 01:31:16,958
We'll take a brief recess
and we'll come back with our decision.

1522
01:31:25,385 --> 01:31:27,844
You're through.
You know that, don't you?

1523
01:31:37,021 --> 01:31:39,689
- That was beautiful, man.
- Thanks.

1524
01:31:39,816 --> 01:31:42,817
- How much they offer you?
- Not enough.

1525
01:31:51,661 --> 01:31:54,495
We have reached
a unanimous decision.

1526
01:31:56,706 --> 01:32:00,083
The proposal
from Quality Land Development

1527
01:32:00,209 --> 01:32:02,001
has been approved.

1528
01:32:02,587 --> 01:32:04,338
This meeting is over.

1529
01:32:08,509 --> 01:32:09,884
What have you done?

1530
01:32:10,012 --> 01:32:12,888
That's what l'm talkin' about.
Money, money, money!

1531
01:32:13,014 --> 01:32:15,723
What in the world
you people thinkin' about?

1532
01:33:43,057 --> 01:33:44,599
Well, l'll be.

1533
01:33:49,564 --> 01:33:51,315
How you gonna leave town
without givin' my ring back?

1534
01:33:52,733 --> 01:33:54,692
I've been lookin'
for your ass for 35 years.

1535
01:33:54,818 --> 01:33:57,402
And l've been carrying
that cheap-ass thing with me

1536
01:33:57,488 --> 01:33:59,489
'cause I knew
that's all you wanted.

1537
01:33:59,615 --> 01:34:03,409
Cheap? You saddity ho,
give me my shit.

1538
01:34:03,494 --> 01:34:05,120
- You ain't changed.
- You ain't, either.

1539
01:34:08,373 --> 01:34:10,415
Piece of shit, my ass.

1540
01:34:17,716 --> 01:34:19,925
- Come here, girl.
- No, you come here.

1541
01:34:20,009 --> 01:34:21,927
- You come here.
- No, you come here.

1542
01:34:22,012 --> 01:34:24,471
- Get your butt over here.
- No, you come here.

1543
01:34:24,555 --> 01:34:26,889
Look at you.
Lord have mercy.

1544
01:34:27,016 --> 01:34:28,475
You look good.

1545
01:34:31,979 --> 01:34:34,021
You look pretty, too.

1546
01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:38,317
- Don't make me chase your ass again.
- I like when you chase me.

1547
01:34:38,444 --> 01:34:41,237
I been 35 years
chasin' after you.

1548
01:34:42,697 --> 01:34:45,865
You still got that mattress
on the floor?

1549
01:34:47,661 --> 01:34:49,370
What you thinkin'?

1550
01:34:49,495 --> 01:34:53,331
We might be able to get down there.
I don't know if we gonna get up.

1551
01:34:54,459 --> 01:34:56,460
Nothin' to worry about.
They ain't even real Chicago barbers.

1552
01:34:58,213 --> 01:34:59,922
- Mornin', fellas.
- Mornin', young fellow.

1553
01:35:00,006 --> 01:35:02,840
- You finally got a day off?
- I quit.

1554
01:35:02,924 --> 01:35:04,842
- They fired you?
- No, no.

1555
01:35:04,927 --> 01:35:06,511
You know you got fired.

1556
01:35:06,595 --> 01:35:09,096
Look at you--
your shirt's still smokin'.

1557
01:35:09,181 --> 01:35:12,224
No, I quit on principle.
Politics ain't my thing.

1558
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:15,895
What's going on here?
Look at you.

1559
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:17,898
Well, lookit here.
If it ain't Bobby and Whitney.

1560
01:35:19,315 --> 01:35:21,732
Don't try
the opposite-direction thing.

1561
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,319
Richard and I are just friends.

1562
01:35:23,445 --> 01:35:24,904
"Richard."

1563
01:35:25,029 --> 01:35:27,238
It's "Richard" at work
and "Big Daddy" in the bedroom.

1564
01:35:27,365 --> 01:35:30,825
Listen, little man, I got a daddy.
I don't need another one.

1565
01:35:30,951 --> 01:35:33,076
So keep your mouth shut
before I punch you in it.

1566
01:35:33,204 --> 01:35:35,538
She's back.

1567
01:35:35,623 --> 01:35:37,499
- What you doin' here?
- He got fired.

1568
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:38,958
I did not get fired.

1569
01:35:40,878 --> 01:35:42,003
All right, fellas, how you doin'?

1570
01:35:43,714 --> 01:35:44,756
Clown.

1571
01:35:47,843 --> 01:35:49,427
Clown!

1572
01:35:49,511 --> 01:35:52,596
Well, Jimy,
first chair is open.

1573
01:35:53,264 --> 01:35:56,933
Your old chair is open.
Quiet as it's kept.

1574
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:59,018
I don't know how long
we gonna be open.

1575
01:35:59,145 --> 01:36:01,270
We gonna find out today.

1576
01:36:12,741 --> 01:36:15,534
- Hey, Calvin.
- Good morning.

1577
01:36:28,881 --> 01:36:30,131
All right!

1578
01:36:31,676 --> 01:36:34,010
My chair open.
Come on.

1579
01:36:37,848 --> 01:36:38,973
Snap.

1580
01:36:39,099 --> 01:36:41,850
What the hell he do?

1581
01:36:41,936 --> 01:36:43,770
Well, l'll be da--

1582
01:36:44,438 --> 01:36:47,398
Hold on. Where the hell
is my uterus?

1583
01:36:47,524 --> 01:36:49,941
In the Dumpster
with the rest of that mess.

1584
01:36:50,026 --> 01:36:52,027
If we goin' out,
we goin' out like us.

1585
01:36:52,112 --> 01:36:53,237
That's right.

1586
01:36:54,573 --> 01:36:56,865
- We back, Big C?
- Yup.

1587
01:36:56,949 --> 01:36:58,991
- What you doin' here?
- He got fired.

1588
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:01,285
- Whatever.
- You quit?

1589
01:37:02,455 --> 01:37:03,997
I ain't a politician.

1590
01:37:05,374 --> 01:37:08,250
- Don't tell me you quit.
- What was I supposed to do?

1591
01:37:08,377 --> 01:37:11,003
Is Lalowe Brown
the only politician in Chicago?

1592
01:37:19,554 --> 01:37:21,763
Listen, Cal...

1593
01:37:21,891 --> 01:37:24,559
Don't even worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

1594
01:37:25,226 --> 01:37:26,726
Good to have you back.

1595
01:37:27,604 --> 01:37:28,771
Good to be back.

1596
01:37:28,897 --> 01:37:31,690
Archie Bunker and George Jefferson
back together again.

1597
01:37:33,693 --> 01:37:36,402
- Respect, man.
- All right, respect.

1598
01:37:42,243 --> 01:37:44,577
Yo, what's up?

1599
01:38:40,799 --> 01:38:43,800
- What's happenin', y'all?
- What's goin' on?

1600
01:38:43,884 --> 01:38:45,426
Can somebody tighten me up?

1601
01:38:45,511 --> 01:38:47,720
Come on over here, Wakefield.
Sit down.

1602
01:38:47,805 --> 01:38:49,222
Serve you right.

1603
01:38:49,306 --> 01:38:51,182
What's up, Cal?

1604
01:38:51,309 --> 01:38:53,227
What's up, y'all?
Quick lineup?

1605
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,310
What's happenin'?

1606
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:55,770
I got you, playboy.

1607
01:38:55,854 --> 01:38:59,439
Calvin, I like
what you said yesterday.

1608
01:38:59,566 --> 01:39:01,066
What's up, man?

1609
01:39:02,068 --> 01:39:03,735
Dinka, can you hook me up?

1610
01:39:03,821 --> 01:39:06,280
Yes, sir.
No problem.

1611
01:39:06,364 --> 01:39:07,948
Leave my customers alone.

1612
01:39:08,074 --> 01:39:09,658
That's Rick's.

1613
01:39:13,162 --> 01:39:15,621
Hey, Rick, l'm next with you.

1614
01:39:15,707 --> 01:39:17,708
All right.
Whatever you want here.

1615
01:39:17,834 --> 01:39:20,418
It looks to me
Iike the village has spoken.

1616
01:39:21,003 --> 01:39:24,505
It's okay.
Just a minor setback.

1617
01:39:25,507 --> 01:39:26,799
Minor.

1618
01:39:26,884 --> 01:39:28,510
We can get through this.

1619
01:39:32,097 --> 01:39:33,305
"We"?

1620
01:39:35,017 --> 01:39:38,769
Young man, you're on your own.

1621
01:39:40,314 --> 01:39:41,814
Remember that.

1622
01:39:47,653 --> 01:39:49,404
Hey, lsaac, play somethin'.

1623
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:53,157
Anything but R. Kelly. Please.
Somethin' wrong with that boy.

1624
01:39:53,243 --> 01:39:56,411
He need some serious help.
We ain't listenin' to no R. Kelly.

1625
01:39:56,537 --> 01:39:59,580
Hold, now. Don't start
talkin' about R. Kelly.

1626
01:39:59,706 --> 01:40:01,915
I saw the tape.
Y'all see the tape?

1627
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:04,292
- Yeah, I saw the tape.
- How that boy gonna say it ain't him?

1628
01:40:04,378 --> 01:40:07,755
You can't believe everything.
The media likes to spin stuff.

1629
01:40:07,881 --> 01:40:09,465
- That was him.
- You don't know.

1630
01:40:09,549 --> 01:40:12,175
- I think he was set up.
- He was set up.

1631
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:16,137
He set up the camera.
That's what he did!

1632
01:40:16,223 --> 01:40:20,059
He had his head so far
up that girl's behind,

1633
01:40:20,142 --> 01:40:21,768
you thought it was Groundhog Day.

1634
01:40:21,895 --> 01:40:25,022
But that ain't him.
It ain't just him.

1635
01:40:25,106 --> 01:40:27,982
Michael Jackson--his problem
is he got a Ferris wheel.

1636
01:40:28,067 --> 01:40:31,444
How you gonna be a pedophile
with a Ferris wheel?

1637
01:40:31,570 --> 01:40:35,531
Kobe Bryant--everybody thought
he was Mr. Goody Two-shoes.

1638
01:40:35,615 --> 01:40:38,241
Come to find out
he ain't have on no shoes.

1639
01:40:38,368 --> 01:40:40,369
He didn't have on
no socks, either.

1640
01:40:40,496 --> 01:40:42,038
Man, and Luther Vandross.

1641
01:40:44,749 --> 01:40:45,749
You done gone too goddamn far.

1642
01:40:47,086 --> 01:40:49,795
Don't talk about
Luther Vandross, okay?

1643
01:40:49,879 --> 01:40:51,421
Luther's sick, man.

1644
01:40:52,507 --> 01:40:55,091
- I can't talk about Luther Vandross?
- No!

1645
01:40:55,176 --> 01:40:58,636
Everybody in here sayin'
I can't talk about Luther Vandross?

1646
01:40:58,721 --> 01:41:00,138
No!

1647
01:41:00,222 --> 01:41:02,306
I can't talk
about Luther Vandross?

1648
01:41:02,391 --> 01:41:05,267
What you gonna do
about it, then?

1649
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:09,062
Eddie, that's what l'm talkin' about.
That's enough!

1650
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:10,690
That's enough!
