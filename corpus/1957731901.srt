00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:16,638
(slow mellow music)

3
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:57,134
- Whoo, hi, did y'all have fun?

4
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:04,174
- Oh, it was fantastic,
you should've been there.

5
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:09,030
- Looks like you missed quite a party.

6
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,728
- Well, somebody's got to mind the store.

7
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:16,228
Oh, look sugar, we all got to do our part.

8
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:18,669
- [Man] How you doin'?

9
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:19,919
- [Woman] Okay.

10
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,332
- Well, hi there.

11
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,467
- Who's the blond in the pink thing?

12
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:30,407
- You know, I wouldn't have
taken her for your type.

13
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,623
- [Sam] There you go.

14
00:01:36,623 --> 00:01:37,456
- [Woman] Oh, why thank you, Commissioner.

15
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:39,082
- [Woman] Great, commissioner.

16
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:40,082
- All right.

17
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:42,990
- Hi, Melissa, hey.

18
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:51,340
- My, my, my, looks like
somebody's been busy.

19
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:53,738
- [Tommy] How you doin'?

20
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,571
- Hi, Tommy.

21
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:55,737
- You guys have a good time?

22
00:01:55,737 --> 00:01:57,154
- [Both] Uh huh.

23
00:02:03,197 --> 00:02:05,890
- [Tommy] Did y'all have a
good weekend, Commissioner?

24
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,719
- Oh, I think you could
safely say that, Tommy.

25
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,240
(feet thud)

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Looks pretty solid, I think
your boys are doing a fine job.

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,840
- [Tommy] Glad to be of service.

28
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:17,515
- Tommy.

29
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:20,848
- Wiley, looks like you had a good time.

30
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:50,048
- [Sandra] Last call.

31
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:56,230
- Can I help?

32
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,369
- Would you like to pour the juice?

33
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:58,202
- Yeah.

34
00:02:58,202 --> 00:02:59,040
- Thank you, sweetheart.

35
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,470
- [Sandra] Shane, I'm not kiddin,

36
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,533
I can't be late, come on.

37
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,740
- I'm not hungry.

38
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,080
- [Sharon] Well, just eat a bite.

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,923
- [Shane] Mom, I'm not hungry.

40
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,480
- Good job.

41
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,024
- Are you excited Mommy?

42
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:20,003
- Um, I'm more kinda nervous,
you know, sweetheart.

43
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,400
- It's only a job, Mom.

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,550
- Yeah, but it's a good job,
and we need every penny.

45
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,650
- Hey, don't blame me.

46
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,070
- Shane, look, this is
important for me, okay?

47
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,640
It could lead someplace,
could help us get outta here.

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,040
- [Shane] Yeah, right.

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,660
- We'll talk about it
tonight, all right, Shane?

50
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,303
I don't have time now.

51
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,253
Shane, will you walk your
sister to the bus stop?

52
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:50,653
- Yeah.

53
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,210
- Y'all have a good day.

54
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,930
I left the phone number
on the refrigerator.

55
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,220
I want you to call me when
you get home from school.

56
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,183
I saw you take your sister's lunch.

57
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,163
Bye.

58
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,780
- Hey, Mom?

59
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,613
- Mm hmm.

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,460
- Good luck today.

61
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:12,830
- Thank you, Shane.

62
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:23,484
(doorbell rings)

63
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:26,118
- How you doing?

64
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:26,951
- [Sam] Now you won't forget me

65
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,500
when you're back up there
in Washington, right?

66
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,963
- Forget you, Commissioner?

67
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,572
My heart may be in Washington,

68
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:36,648
but my pocketbook will
always be in Georgia.

69
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:39,148
(all chuckle)

70
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:41,700
(knocking on door)

71
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,250
- [Sam] Oh yeah, come in Tommy.

72
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,433
- Commissioner, Sheriff, Senator.

73
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,970
- How's the work going?

74
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,060
- Uh, the dock's finished, sir.

75
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,272
The boys'll need another
couple of weeks on the boat.

76
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,350
- Mm, there's no hurry.

77
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,640
You can give the boys some time off.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,290
Oh, I want you to buy
your little league team

79
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,710
some new uniforms.

80
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,673
Send me the bill.

81
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,890
That'll be all, Tommy.

82
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,367
- Thank you very much, sir.

83
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,470
- Your birthday's coming up, Sam.

84
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,260
And well, me and the boys would like

85
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,650
to show our abide and appreciation.

86
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,350
- [Sam] Now that won't
be necessary, Sheriff.

87
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,853
Harris Wiley already
has something planned.

88
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,882
- [Harris] Just tell him
I'm gonna need these back

89
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:29,715
by this afternoon, okay?

90
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:31,715
- Why certainly, Harris.

91
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,597
Beth, hon, you're just too pretty

92
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,603
to be workin' like a little ole bee.

93
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,904
- Any messages there, sweetie?

94
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:49,373
- [Beth] Oh yeah, a
whole bunch, here you go.

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,750
- [Audrey] Hi, Melissa.

96
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:56,010
Be a real sweetheart

97
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,590
and pick up my dry cleaning, will ya?

98
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,218
- Yeah, I'll do it during my, my break.

99
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:02,234
(phone rings)

100
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:03,234
Department of Labor.

101
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,700
Audrey, for you.

102
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,650
- By tomorrow, hon.

103
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,700
These are the time sheets
for Audrey's department.

104
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,597
They worked here all last week.

105
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:14,430
- Sure thing.

106
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,500
- [Sandra] Melissa sure
works you to death.

107
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,977
- [Beth] Give her a week
and she'll start in on ya.

108
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:34,114
- Let me know if I can help you.

109
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:35,610
- I don't wanna get you into trouble.

110
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,443
- Melissa?

111
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,773
- Be careful, Sandra.

112
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,587
Those time sheets, the
ones for Audrey and Susan?

113
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:44,420
- Yeah?

114
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:47,643
- They were playing in
the Bahama's last week.

115
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,580
Welcome to the labor department.

116
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,170
- Oh, Beth has a little
girl named Theresa.

117
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,363
I think you're older than she is.

118
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,133
- Was it fun?

119
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,133
- Well, it's my first day.

120
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,190
I'm sure I'll learn to like it.

121
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,970
I mean I have to, won't I?

122
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,100
Shane, Shane, you have homework.

123
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,090
- [Shane] Just wait up a sec.

124
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,790
- No, come on, you've been
in there a couple of hours.

125
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:25,035
Oh, oh, let me take a look.

126
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:25,868

127
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:27,310

128
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,143
- [Shane] No.

129
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:28,976
- [Sharon] Please sweetheart,

130
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:30,570
just let me take a look at 'em.

131
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,574
- Get a life, mom, okay?

132
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:34,030
- Ah.

133
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,102
Oh.

134
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:36,005
- You're gonna wrinkle 'em.

135
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:39,473
- Shane, these are good.

136
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,430
You have an eye.

137
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,263
- Yeah, thanks, mom.

138
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,013
I appreciate it.

139
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,770
Just don't, uh, show these to dad, okay?

140
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,613
- Shane, he's your father.

141
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:53,750
(door thuds)

142
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,230
- The Wiley Lumber Company
appreciates your business.

143
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,360
Sincerely, Harris Wiley,
President of Wiley Lumber.

144
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,193
Come on.

145
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,210
And make sure you type that up

146
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,980
on lumber company letterheads, sweetheart.

147
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,523
Don't use the labor
department stationary, okay?

148
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,790
- Um, Tommy Marchant.

149
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,120
You must be Sandra Clayton?

150
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,953
- Yes, sir.

151
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,253
- Well, no, he's the sir, I'm just Tommy.

152
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:19,210
Welcome to the zoo.

153
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,500
- Tommy, I'm gonna buy big Sam

154
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,280
a new Buick for his birthday.

155
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,130
Thank you, honey.

156
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,340
- Well, now, boys just
kicked in for the new dock.

157
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,163
- I want you to collect
$50 from each of the men.

158
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:36,100
- Sam needs a new car like
George needs another peanut farm.

159
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,020
- Well, that's fine Tommy,

160
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,053
if you wanna kiss 12 years
in your pension goodbye.

161
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:42,540
(Tommy sighs)

162
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,373
Oh listen, I might have

163
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,240
a little job for you on Saturday night.

164
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,240
- It's the last damn time.

165
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,324
(door thuds)

166
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:57,563
- [Woman] Bye, see ya tomorrow.

167
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:58,750

168
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,975
- [Beth] Goodnight.

169
00:08:59,975 --> 00:09:01,441
- Here let me give you hand with these.

170
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,634
- Thanks.

171
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:03,467
- [Sharon] You gotta a lot of work to do.

172
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,123
- Well, I'll just get it in the morning.

173
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,800
Listen, I got something
to do tomorrow night,

174
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,990

175
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,550
- [Sharon] Oh no, I'd love to.

176
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,092
Shannon's dying to see her.

177
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:16,217
- [Beth] Thanks.

178
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:17,217
- You've got a date?

179
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,810
- Uh, it's not exactly a date.

180
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,373
I mean, well.

181
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,560
- Excuse me, may I help you?

182
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,390
- No, I know my way around.

183
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,430
Don't I, Beth?

184
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,263
- Hi.

185
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,093
Sandra.

186
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:31,951
- [Sandra] Yes, sir.

187
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,551
- [Harris] See you Monday, okay?

188
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,960
Come on, sweetie, let's go.

189
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,870
- That's Barbara, she
used to have your desk.

190
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,163
- Is he like that with all the employees?

191
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,810
- Old Harris has his own golden rule,

192
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,496
what's yours is his.

193
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:53,017
- [Sandra] Huh.

194
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:56,000
- [Beth] So how 'bout
having a drink with me?

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,490
- Oh no, I'm sorry, I can't.

196
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,773
I promised the kids.

197
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,870
- Well, call and say you'll be late.

198
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,600
- No, I really can't do it.

199
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
They haven't seen me all week, you know.

200
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,150
Something wrong there?

201
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,090
- Oh no, I, it was just Melissa, she's...

202
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,373
Just one drink?

203
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,270
- [Melissa] Busy Saturday?

204
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,307
- Yeah, Harris has got me
running some fool errand.

205
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:33,973
You know Harris.

206
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,516
- Better than his own wife, sugar.

207
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:41,016
(mid-tempo country music)

208
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,165
Oh, that blond you were asking about?

209
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,240
- [Tommy] Yeah?

210
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,440
- [Melissa] Her name
is Mary Ann, I checked.

211
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,023
- Hey Tommy, come on over
here for a minute, will you?

212
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:04,315
- Cheat.

213
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,320
- Sandra's son likes to
fish, you know a good spot?

214
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,373
- Sure, how you doin'?

215
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:16,206
- Fine.

216
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:19,461
- I'll draw you a map.

217
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,727
Take Racetrack Road, turn left,

218
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:26,173
follow that dirt road down
there to the bridge, okay?

219
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,145
- You didn't really have to bother.

220
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:30,852
- No, it's no bother.

221
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:33,253
Now you tell your boy, what's his name?

222
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,967
- Shane.

223
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:39,983
- Well, you tell Shane
that the bass are in.

224
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,560
- It's gettin' late Mr. Marchant,

225
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,310
and Beth and I really hadn't
even had a chance to talk.

226
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,200
- Well, excuse me.

227
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:01,060
- Why the brush off?

228
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,153
He's nice, he's not one of them.

229
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:07,073
- Ask him about the new Buick.

230
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,510
- Everyone has to do
their share for Caldwell.

231
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,420
He doesn't have a choice.

232
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,943
- Beth, honey, we all have a choice.

233
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,033
- Yeah, I guess.

234
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:35,405
(slow relaxing music)

235
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,500
- Catch anything?

236
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,350
- [Shane] No, not yet.

237
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:03,860
- What you got in your line?

238
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,902
- Nightcrawlers.

239
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:08,952
- That's fine if you wanna catch catfish.

240
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,320
Tommy Marchant, I work with your mom.

241
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,958
- Oh, yeah?

242
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,440
- Listen, uh, bass are
hittin' silver Rapalas,

243
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,194
you wanna try one?

244
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:22,611
- [Sandra] Shane!

245
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:24,616
Shane!

246
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:30,900
- Yeah, but I gotta go.

247
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,567
- [Sandra] Shane, come in Shane.

248
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,423
- Uh, my mom made some chicken.

249
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,350
You wanna have some?

250
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,213
- Well, sure, thank you kindly.

251
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,263
Meet you up there by the bank.

252
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:54,204
(boat motor revs)

253
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,447
- [Shane] Hey, mom.

254
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,481
- [Sandra] Uh huh.

255
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:03,648
- [Shane] Look who's here.

256
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:07,272
- How you doin'?

257
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,509
- Say hello to Mr. Marchant, honey.

258
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,342
- Hello, Mr. Marchant.

259
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,850
- Well, my friends call me Tommy, honey.

260
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,933
- Okay, Tommy honey.

261
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,603
- Hey, you got a couple
of good lookin' kids.

262
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:28,880
Can I help you with something?

263
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,480
- [Sandra] No, thank you, I'm just fine.

264
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,580
- It must be tough raising
them alone though, huh?

265
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,810
Beth told me you're divorced.

266
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,643
- Oh, yeah?

267
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,923
What else did Beth tell you?

268
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,270
- Did I say something wrong?

269
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,190
Because if I did, I'd
like to know what it is.

270
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,170
- Listen, I overheard your
conversation with Mr. Wiley.

271
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,863
That business about
Mr. Caldwell's new car.

272
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,863
- So?

273
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,063
- So, I guess one more shakedown
won't hurt Georgia none.

274
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,343
- [Tommy] Hey, now wait a minute.

275
00:15:00,343 --> 00:15:01,320
I don't have a choice here,

276
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,500
I'm getting close to my pension.

277
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,020
I'm gonna think twice
before I throw it away.

278
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,920
- Seemed like to me you had
plenty of time to think twice.

279
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,340
- Well, aren't you brave
with other people's jobs.

280
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,230
- I bet you knew about Audrey and Susan

281
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,740
and that trip to the Bahamas.

282
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,460
- Well, who signed the timecards?

283
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,147
- Melissa told me to, I didn't know.

284
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:18,910
- No, no, maybe not when you signed 'em.

285
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,910
What about later on?

286
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,863
Yeah, okay?

287
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,506
This whole thing goes way
beyond a couple call girls

288
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:31,733
and a shakedown for a new Buick.

289
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,400
- Well, how can you just do nothing.

290
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,333
I know--

291
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,233
- No, you don't know.

292
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,618
And that's the problem.

293
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:46,785
(slow serious music)

294
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,877
- My kids are hungry.

295
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:12,179
- [Beth] Here we go, here we go.

296
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,320
- [Sandra] You look gorgeous.

297
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,950
- Thanks.

298
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,253
- The guy's gonna melt.

299
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,770
- Boy, you're real good at this.

300
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,273
- I wanted to be a florist,

301
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,490
work with beautiful things.

302
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,770
- Why didn't you?

303
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,770
- Oh, you know, got married,
had children, got divorced.

304
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,840
Old story.

305
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,040
- Yeah, I know that one.

306
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,909
- [Sandra] At least this
brings in a little extra money.

307
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,826
(slow piano music)

308
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:51,079
- Well, I guess I better get goin', huh?

309
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:55,339
- Beth, relax, it's a
date not an execution.

310
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:58,006
God (chuckles).

311
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,922
- You take good care now, sweetheart.

312
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,043
Bye.

313
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,973
- Have fun.

314
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:44,478
(slow ominous music)

315
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:56,093
- Come on, Mitchell, can't
this wait till morning?

316
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:57,426
- [Mitchell] No.

317
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,134
- What you smiling for?

318
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:25,310
Oh, no, Mitchell.

319
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,240
- Oh yeah, Tommy.

320
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,120
- Come on, man, we get caught
moving this stuff, we're--

321
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,820
- Then we don't get caught, do we?

322
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:35,217
(doorbell rings)

323
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:38,300
(slow elegant music)

324
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:42,567
- My, my, my, you look pretty as myrtle.

325
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:47,133
All right, now don't be nervous, sugar.

326
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,670
Derek, just a little boy
dressed up in a suit is all.

327
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,770
There you are.

328
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,370
Beth, this is Derek.

329
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,308
Derek's real big, honey.

330
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:01,263
He's an auditor from Atlanta.

331
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,200
Derek, honey, I think this
little girl needs a drink.

332
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,570
- It'll be my pleasure.

333
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,510
Come on, let me introduce you

334
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,063
to some of these stuffed shirts.

335
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,761
(slow unsettling music)

336
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,350
- [Tommy] Mitchell!

337
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:33,778
(police radio chatters)

338
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:46,443
- [Officer] Kinda late
to be out here, isn't it?

339
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,033
- Yes, sir, I just.

340
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:55,410
- Won't you climb down
from there, nice and easy,

341
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,610
and we'll sort this out.

342
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:05,158
Let's see what you got here.

343
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,543
Well.

344
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,073
- [Mitchell] Hi, Woody.

345
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,750
- Is that you, Mitchell?

346
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,300
- Just cleaning a little
old business up for Sam.

347
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,820
- Be sure and tie it down.

348
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,770
We don't want any public safety hazard.

349
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:41,305
Oh, hey, say hello to the
commissioner for me, will ya?

350
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,363
- Don't worry, he won't forget ya.

351
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,030
See Tommy, I told you, you worry too much.

352
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,880
(slow uneasy music)

353
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,170
- Now, honey, you just got to learn

354
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,277
to relax a little bit, that's all.

355
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:10,348
- Look, I don't feel so good.

356
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:11,265
I gotta go.

357
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:18,704
(slow ominous music)

358
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:20,129
- Come here, darlin'.

359
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:23,802
Fantastic ole Derek is here,
huh, make you feel good, huh.

360
00:21:23,802 --> 00:21:27,190
- [Beth] No, (screams) no!

361
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,607
(dress rips)

362
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:34,860
(whimpers and cries)

363
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:42,274
(phone rings)

364
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,353
- Hello?

365
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,223
Yes, this is she.

366
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:54,267
- [Intercom] Dr. Baker to pediatrics.

367
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,964
(knocking on door)

368
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:58,054
Dr. Baker to pediatrics.

369
00:21:58,054 --> 00:21:58,887
- Hi.

370
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:09,593
Oh Beth, honey.

371
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:14,340
(slow somber music)

372
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,878
- Where's Theresa?

373
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:17,515
Is she okay?

374
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:22,515
- Mm hmm, she's asleep,
Shane's watching her.

375
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:26,728
- I feel so ashamed.

376
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:30,039
- Shh.

377
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:32,681
- I didn't want to.

378
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,739
Melissa said they'd fire me if I didn't.

379
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:39,989
- If you didn't what, Beth?

380
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:47,194
- You know, entertain the customers.

381
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,931
- Oh, Beth, no, that's not your fault.

382
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:57,589
(Beth sobs)

383
00:22:57,589 --> 00:22:59,280
The police will--

384
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
- There's no police, no.

385
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,136
- Oh Beth, we've got to report this.

386
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:07,219
- No, I'm not going back.

387
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,460
You can't stop them, Sandra.

388
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,203
I'm sorry, you can't stop them.

389
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:21,363
- Shh, it's okay.

390
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,623
- It's not okay, it won't be okay.

391
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:27,980
They'll be after you next.

392
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,693
- [Harris] We'll let you know

393
00:23:41,693 --> 00:23:42,824
as soon as we get it all figured out.

394
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:44,043
- [Woman In Red] Fine Mr. Wiley.

395
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:45,043
- Thank you.

396
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,542
Who's next?

397
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,653
- She's the last one.

398
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,944
It's not easy to find a
girl who measure up, sugar.

399
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:57,684
- [Harris] (chuckles)
Well, keep working on it,

400
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:59,120
we're gonna have to find
a replacement for Beth

401
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,870
by the end of the week, hm.

402
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,710
Oh, listen, honey.

403
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,560
- [Melissa] Yeah.

404
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,973
- I'm gonna have to raise
the rent around here.

405
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,310
- [Melissa] Didn't you just rewrite

406
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,910
that lease six months ago.

407
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,840
- Oh, well, I suppose Derek

408
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,370
that big ole auditor up in Atlanta

409
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,070
is gonna raise a real ruckus, huh?

410
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,663
- Two more.

411
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:22,496
- [Sandra] Oh, can't these wait?

412
00:24:22,496 --> 00:24:23,329
- [Melissa] Sorry, hon.

413
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,620
- I really need to get home.

414
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,600
- Well, then you better shake a bun, hon.

415
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:43,570
(Sandra sighs)

416
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,570
- [Barbara] Melissa.

417
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,130
- Must be nice to get
paid for doing nothin'.

418
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,103
- I'd hardly call Harris nothin'.

419
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:00,520
(both chuckle)

420
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,353
Bye.

421
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,279
(typewriter clicks)

422
00:25:08,168 --> 00:25:10,335
- Hey, mom, hurry up, mom.

423
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:14,876
- Coming, honey.

424
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,850
Nice of you to help Beth with the move.

425
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,450
- Yeah, well, I played
football with her brother.

426
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,969
I've known her since she was a kid.

427
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:41,895
It's the least I could do.

428
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:44,062
- [Shannon] Mom, hurry up.

429
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,490
- Listen, down by the river the other day,

430
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,083
I'm sorry for what I said.

431
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,240
- You were right.

432
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,620
What happened to Beth goes
beyond a couple of call girls

433
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,663
and a new Buick.

434
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,763
- Listen, they got this whole state wired.

435
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,113
Hell, I know a congressman
that called Caldwell sir.

436
00:26:14,771 --> 00:26:16,477
- You know why my marriage failed?

437
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,480
'Cause I didn't fight for it.

438
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,510
I didn't stand up until it was too late.

439
00:26:26,328 --> 00:26:28,293
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

440
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,040
- Learned a lesson.

441
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,653
Problems don't just disappear.

442
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,723
- Maybe Caldwell isn't
just a lousy marriage.

443
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:45,060
- [Shannon] Hey, mom.

444
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,073
- I'm comin', honey.

445
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,830
Yeah, but if I run away from every fire,

446
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,810
what kind of lesson would
I be teaching my kids?

447
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,325
- [Shannon] Mom, hurry up.

448
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:04,492
(slow stirring music)

449
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:15,014
- Good night, Sandra.

450
00:27:15,014 --> 00:27:15,847
- Good night.

451
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:18,764
(slow tense music)

452
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,220
(Shane whimpers)

453
00:28:44,116 --> 00:28:45,625
(knocking on door)

454
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,458
Shane, you okay?

455
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,800
It's just a bad dream, sweetheart.

456
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,633
- I'm okay.

457
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,670
- You wanna talk about it?

458
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,593
- Why should you care?

459
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,123
- Shane?

460
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,250
- You know, all you care
about is that stupid job.

461
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,730
- Shane, I'm doing the best I can.

462
00:29:28,722 --> 00:29:29,822
- Just leave me alone.

463
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,980
- We'll do more things
together, I promise.

464
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,991
- They're beautiful.

465
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:52,150
- Mm mm, who's the happy man, honey?

466
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,871
- Mr. Thursday night.

467
00:29:53,871 --> 00:29:55,954
- [Woman] Thank you, sir.

468
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,143
- Sandra, you know
you're working too hard.

469
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,690
She needs to get out
more, don't you all think?

470
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,207
Maybe take a cruise or something.

471
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,133
You need me, I'll be at the lumber yard.

472
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,323
- Be smart hon, you're
sittin' on a gold mine.

473
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,770
It's not gettin' any smaller.

474
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:40,364
(slow unsettling music)

475
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,730
- [Audrey] Sandra, be a real sweetheart

476
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,713
and get a pitcher for those, will ya?

477
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,890
- [Sandra] Thank you.

478
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:12,310
- Tell me, honey.

479
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,390
- [Tommy] Hmm.

480
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,003
- You been in my desk again?

481
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,060
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Melissa, I
had to get a couple contracts.

482
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,513
- Well, you know the rule, sugar,

483
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,230
you ask me next time you
wanna get into my drawers.

484
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,550
- So I made a mistake.

485
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,140
- [Tommy] What in the hell
did you think you were doin'?

486
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,790
- Just borrowing the key.

487
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,380
- [Tommy] For what?

488
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,129
- Make some copies.

489
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:53,629
- [Tommy] Of what?

490
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,400
- Mr. Wiley's lease,
Melissa's personnel records,

491
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,113
and those phony time sheets.

492
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,880
Thanks for covering for me.

493
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,970
You were really good.

494
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,343
Sugar, next time you
wanna get in my drawers.

495
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,113
- And what in the hell you plan to do

496
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:16,230
with all that good stuff?

497
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,540
- I don't rightly know.

498
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,050
Somebody's gotta hear about it,

499
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,800
I thought maybe take it to the newspapers.

500
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,623
- Forget it, Caldwell's
got friends all over.

501
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,383
Isn't gonna be too likely to
print anything against the man.

502
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,680
You can not beat these boys, Sandra.

503
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,103
Okay, you cannot win.

504
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,700
- Well, there's a big difference

505
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,170
between not winning and not trying.

506
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,380
- And there's a big difference
between taking a good shot

507
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,680
and shootin' from the hip.

508
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,898
You wanna beat Caldwell,
you need a pile of evidence.

509
00:32:52,898 --> 00:32:55,720
- I'll get it, and I'll go to the papers.

510
00:33:02,116 --> 00:33:03,033
- We could.

511
00:33:07,147 --> 00:33:09,157
Maybe there's a better way.

512
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,567
(slow tense music)

513
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:51,703
Let's try this.

514
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,773
(grunts)

515
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,451
All right, get up.

516
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:05,201
Check it out.

517
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:06,034
Can you get up?

518
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:06,867
- [Sandra] No.

519
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,750
- [Tommy] All right, just grab a handful,

520
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,919
that's all we need

521
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:11,752
You ready?

522
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:12,585
- [Sandra] Yeah.

523
00:34:12,585 --> 00:34:13,418
- Go slow.
- Okay.

524
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,251
- All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.

525
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:15,084
- [Tommy] On three.

526
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:16,686
- [Sandra] Wait, my left foot.

527
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:18,769
- [Both] One, two, three.

528
00:34:20,378 --> 00:34:22,398
- [Sandra] Oh, oh my.

529
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:23,231
- [Tommy] You all right?

530
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:24,064
(Sandra thuds)

531
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:25,318
- [Sandra] Oh!

532
00:34:25,318 --> 00:34:26,818
- You okay?
- Yeah.

533
00:34:29,463 --> 00:34:31,103
- [Tommy] All right, here, take this,

534
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,933
meet me around the side, open up the door.

535
00:34:52,285 --> 00:34:53,702
- [Sandra] Tommy.

536
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,000
(tense dramatic music)

537
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:17,666
- Sandra.

538
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:23,704
Get down.

539
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,289
(clanking)

540
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:45,422
(door thuds)

541
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,822
- [Sandra] I'm going with ya.

542
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:31,833
- No, too risky.

543
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,030
- How can it be risky
if you trust the guy?

544
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,230
- Yeah, well, but what
if he is one of them?

545
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,910
No reason for us both to get burned.

546
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,093
- [Sandra] Shane, what are you doing up?

547
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,320
- What's in the bag?

548
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,223
- Nothin', go on, get back to bed.

549
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,730
- Where'd you get it from?

550
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,823
- Back to bed, Shane.

551
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,910
- Shane, the only thing
that you have to know

552
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:11,293
is that I'd never let
anything happen to your mom.

553
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:13,137
- Humph.

554
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,025
- [Sandra] Night, sweetheart.

555
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:23,025
- [Shane] Goodnight, mom.

556
00:38:23,296 --> 00:38:26,296
(slow gentle music)

557
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:47,340
(slow foreboding music)

558
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,608
- Hey, buddy, got a problem
under the hood there?

559
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:33,171
- [Tommy] There you are,
where the hell you been?

560
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:36,353
- Come on, let's see what you got, Tommy.

561
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,073
- Check it out.

562
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,143
- Looks like the genuine article to me.

563
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,401
- You think that'll do?

564
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,730
- [Leroy] Ought to.

565
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,000
- We know the weeds there now,

566
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,510
but we don't know how long it's there for,

567
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,350
so I think we ought to move fast.

568
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,010
- I understand.

569
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,700
- You know, 'cause I'm
kinda hangin' out on a limb

570
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,570
with this thing here, Leroy.

571
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,760
You know, Caldwell's got--

572
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,953
- He's got a sale with his name on it.

573
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,440
Look, don't you worry none.

574
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,440
This is between you, me, and
the narc squad, all right?

575
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:22,954
- All right.

576
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,693
- [Sam] Gentlemen, we have a problem.

577
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,553
Sheriff.

578
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,160
- You're up to your ass in river mud, boy.

579
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:44,690
- Hmm, what do you mean?

580
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,173
- Your damn barrels of
weed, that's what I mean.

581
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:49,950
Hell, you left a trail so wide,

582
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,996
a blind coon dog could follow it.

583
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:54,163
(wheezes)

584
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,713
- What happened?

585
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:58,903
- What happened?

586
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,630
Somebody told the police about
your little old schoolhouse.

587
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,580
- Oh no, come on now.

588
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,300
You sure, I helped
Mitchell unload that stuff,

589
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,030
wasn't anybody around.

590
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,850
- Well, welcome to the graveyard, boy.

591
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,500
They start poking,

592
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,003
one old skeleton is gonna
lead right to another.

593
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,113
- Harris?

594
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,500
- I didn't, uh--

595
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,830
- You didn't think,
that's what you didn't do.

596
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,450
You were careless and you were stupid.

597
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,283
- Sam, if there's a--

598
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:30,403
- [Sam] Don't Sam me!

599
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,180
- Yes, sir.

600
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,733
- I don like unhappy workers.

601
00:41:36,763 --> 00:41:38,430
I wanna know who talked, I wanna know why,

602
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,623
and I wanna it stopped.

603
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:43,732
(thunder roars)

604
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:46,649
(slow tense music)

605
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,390
- Sure this is where he said?

606
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,330
- Yeah, I'm sure.

607
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:09,553
Well, here, ask him yourself.

608
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:18,260
What's going on?

609
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,893
- Forget about Caldwell, Tommy.

610
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:21,879
He's not touchable.

611
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,110
- What are you saying?

612
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,240
- The investigation's closed.

613
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,197
The evidence is gone.

614
00:42:31,197 --> 00:42:32,340
- What?

615
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,523
- I'm out of it, Tommy,
been pulled off the case.

616
00:42:36,751 --> 00:42:39,230
- Well, great, that's great.

617
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,330
So they know about me?

618
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,123
- Not by me, that's for damn sure.

619
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,610
But I tell you, if they sniff me out,

620
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,963
they could get to you too.

621
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,660
So if I was y'all, I'd just
forget this whole damn thing.

622
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,283
Lay low and keep quiet
till this thing blows over.

623
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,582
- Damn, thing's not gonna blow over.

624
00:43:12,582 --> 00:43:14,520
- No, it's not.

625
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,607
- Just lay low and forget
about the whole thing?

626
00:43:19,076 --> 00:43:22,076
- Well, I tell ya, if we keep going,

627
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,623
we won't have anywhere to go for help.

628
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:30,070
- I know.

629
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,433
- Why us?

630
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:39,344
I mean we're just a weekly.

631
00:43:39,344 --> 00:43:41,080
The Constitution, they're a daily.

632
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,730
They're big, they got teeth.

633
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,299
- We tried that.

634
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:47,150
We talked to some guy,
next thing you know,

635
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,064
he's transferred out of state.

636
00:43:49,064 --> 00:43:50,314
- Could be a coincidence.

637
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,140
- You really believe that?

638
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,260
- We didn't know where else to go.

639
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,630
We have plenty more where this came from.

640
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,940
- Why not just take it to the police?

641
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,424
- Already did.

642
00:44:08,424 --> 00:44:09,320
- [Albert] And?

643
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,503
- Caldwell got to him.

644
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,260
- David we'll need to have
access to other sources.

645
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,160
- We'll arrange it.

646
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:22,460
- All right, I'll try to
protect you and the sources,

647
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,710
but there's no guarantee.

648
00:44:25,061 --> 00:44:27,437
- You know Caldwell better than I do,

649
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:29,693
how do you think he'd react to all this?

650
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,853
Remember, Georgia has swamps.

651
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:37,292
- Well, sources have been
known to just disappear.

652
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:44,627
- We'll take our chances.

653
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,230
- [Beth] I can't, Sandra.

654
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,400
- [Sandra] He promises
he won't use your name.

655
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,950
- That won't stop
Caldwell from finding out,

656
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,240
it'll just slow him down.

657
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,840
- Beth, by the time he finds
out, it'll be too late.

658
00:44:57,978 --> 00:44:59,478
- I can't, Sandra.

659
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,540
- Beth, remember that night how you felt?

660
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,130
Remember when I came to
see you in the hospital,

661
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,230
Theresa didn't almost have a momma at all.

662
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:14,836
- I just wanna make it up to Theresa.

663
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:19,890
I wanna be a good mother.

664
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,750
- I don't want my kids
growing up in a world

665
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,560
where people like Caldwell
can do whatever they wanna do,

666
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,770
and everybody's too scared
to even say anything.

667
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,070
- It's right to be scared.

668
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,500
- Beth, Tommy and I are gonna do this.

669
00:45:34,368 --> 00:45:35,683
We can't do it alone.

670
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:42,612
- I don't know.

671
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:49,265
(slow subdued music)

672
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,690
- [Sandra] Just talk to him.

673
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,770
- [Beth] Each office has at least one,

674
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,903
always young, always attractive.

675
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,093
They use them to win new friends,

676
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,173
and blackmail and reward.

677
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,480
They pass women around
like a piece of candy.

678
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,640
Caldwell has a special
place up in Harriet's Bluff

679
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,820
where he invites his female employees

680
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,343
to entertain high-ranking officials.

681
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,913
This isn't an isolated incident.

682
00:46:32,896 --> 00:46:37,896
It's almost common practice.

683
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:45,015
- That ought to grab Caldwell's attention.

684
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,363
- They can't do this.

685
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,410
- [Attorney] Oh, it's
called freedom of the press.

686
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,730
- Freedom, my ass, I'll shut 'em down.

687
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:57,860
- Try it, you'll give them
an even bigger headline.

688
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,693
- Well, hell, it's just
some two-bit podunk rag.

689
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,790
- Sam, it'll all blow over.

690
00:47:08,063 --> 00:47:10,630
Now as your attorney,
my advice, let it be.

691
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,410
- Well, my advice is
sue 'em, do something,

692
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:16,430
find out where this
dribble is coming from.

693
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,580
I'll be damned if I'm
just gonna let it be.

694
00:47:22,482 --> 00:47:24,628
(camera clicks)

695
00:47:24,628 --> 00:47:26,950
- [Man] Howdy, senator.

696
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,040
- [Bo] I really appreciate

697
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,803
these labor department volunteers.

698
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,730
- [Sam] Now they are gonna make you

699
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,787
the best known face in Georgia, Bo

700
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:38,426
- [Bo] Are you sure, Commissioner?

701
00:47:38,426 --> 00:47:41,308
- Oh, well, maybe, maybe
the second best known face.

702
00:47:41,308 --> 00:47:42,141
(camera clicks)

703
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:43,940
Now Harris, we're not gonna read

704
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,740
about this in the newspaper, now are we?

705
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,540
- [Harris] Sam, you couldn't
find this place with a map.

706
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:57,390
- Uh, how many people knew about your work

707
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,453
on Bo Denton's campaign?

708
00:48:04,274 --> 00:48:07,163
- Maybe 20, Commissioner.

709
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:11,393
- Hell, Sam, could be more
than one rooster crowing.

710
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,320
- I'm not in the could be business.

711
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:21,113
- Well, I'd say whoever he
is, he's inside the coop.

712
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,823
He knows where the eggs are.

713
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,363
- Well, sir, I could
make a guess if I had to.

714
00:48:36,531 --> 00:48:38,263
- Well, you have to, so guess.

715
00:48:39,931 --> 00:48:43,098
(slow gripping music)

716
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,693
(Tommy grunts)

717
00:49:39,463 --> 00:49:40,803
- It's only a message.

718
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,773
If they were sure, I'd be dead.

719
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,675
- At least we know they read The Gazette.

720
00:49:53,675 --> 00:49:56,523
- Gotta feed The Gazette
at least one more story.

721
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,120
Otherwise they'll know it's me.

722
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,960
- Next time it won't be
just a message will it?

723
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,023
- No, at least it doesn't
look like they suspect you.

724
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,053
- [Shane] What happened?

725
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:16,423
- Uh, I had a little fire at my apartment.

726
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:18,783
It's okay.

727
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,490
- Didn't exactly hide 'em, mom.

728
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,520
I heard you talking with Beth.

729
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:32,739
(phone rings)

730
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,283
- Hello?

731
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:38,222
- [Man] Lucky you weren't
in bed with your boyfriend.

732
00:50:38,222 --> 00:50:39,222
Look out the window.

733
00:50:48,824 --> 00:50:50,928
- [Shane] Leave my mom's car alone!

734
00:50:50,928 --> 00:50:54,105
- Shane!

735
00:50:54,105 --> 00:50:59,105
- [Shane] Get outta here, leave us alone!

736
00:51:04,623 --> 00:51:06,873
- [Sandra] Shane, oh, baby.

737
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:11,502
You all right?

738
00:51:25,807 --> 00:51:28,724
(slow tense music)

739
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,747
- [Shannon] Why are we in Tommy's car?

740
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,040
Where's our car?

741
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,600
- Somebody hit it last night, honey.

742
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,800
We'll have it back soon.

743
00:52:04,766 --> 00:52:05,599
Tommy.

744
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:06,766
- [Tommy] Hmm?

745
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,088
- [Sandra] Y'all want hamburger?

746
00:52:17,088 --> 00:52:19,755
- [Shannon] I'm not hungry, mom.

747
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:36,330
- Let's see if he stops.

748
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:37,163
- [Sandra] Mm hmm.

749
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,463
- Yep, he's stopping.

750
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,180
All right, now, Shane.

751
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,013
- [Shane] Huh?

752
00:52:46,013 --> 00:52:47,570
- You wanna get me a root beer?

753
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,820
- [Shane] Oh, I thought we
were gonna go get hamburger.

754
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,133
- [Sandra] Honey, just come on, get out.

755
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:51,966
- [Shane] Well, why?

756
00:52:51,966 --> 00:52:52,920
- [Tommy] Come on, get up darling.

757
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,585
- [Sandra] Sweetheart, you
wanna go to the ladies' room?

758
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:55,790
- [Shannon] Do we have to?

759
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:56,918
- [Tommy] No backtalk, darlin'.

760
00:52:56,918 --> 00:52:58,701
- [Sandra] Yes, darlin' we do.

761
00:52:58,701 --> 00:52:59,618
Here we go.

762
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,243
- Hold it right there.

763
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,627
Now mister, I don't know who
you are or what you want,

764
00:53:34,627 --> 00:53:36,393
but I got a good shot at you.

765
00:53:37,596 --> 00:53:41,204
- Take it easy, Mr.
Marchant, I'm a friend.

766
00:53:41,204 --> 00:53:43,621
(gun clicks)

767
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,873
- Come forward, put your
hands here on the hood.

768
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,433
- My name is John
Curtis, I'm with the FBI.

769
00:54:02,066 --> 00:54:03,466
- And how would I know that?

770
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,980
- Look, I'm gonna move my hands real slow.

771
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:12,283
I'm gonna open my coat
and show you my badge.

772
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:17,900
And you're gonna put that gun away,

773
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,073
and we're gonna talk.

774
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,513
Interesting reading.

775
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,070
If even half of this stuff
could be made to stick,

776
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,833
these boys will go away
for a long, long time.

777
00:54:35,885 --> 00:54:37,233
- How'd you find us?

778
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:40,783
- Hey, we're the FBI.

779
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,170
- Yeah, but if you can figure it out,

780
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,093
so can Caldwell.

781
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,950
- Yeah, I heard they
tried to smoke you out.

782
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,270
Seems like you all could use some help.

783
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:53,643
- Why should we trust you?

784
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:58,853
- Frankly, I don't think
you have much choice.

785
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,570
You are in pretty deep.

786
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,090
- Yeah, so what do you want from us?

787
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:07,083
- Enough evidence on Caldwell
to shake up a grand jury.

788
00:55:14,722 --> 00:55:17,472
- [Sandra] What do I tell my son?

789
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:19,943
- Nothing.

790
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:22,840
- Come on now, Shane's no dummy,

791
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,300
he knows that something's going on.

792
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,200
- But he doesn't know who I am,

793
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,463
and it's important that
he doesn't find out.

794
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,160
You just gotta go back to work

795
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,260
as if nothing whatsoever has happened,

796
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,993
just business as usual.

797
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:40,010
Believe me, if they knew it was you Tommy,

798
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:41,160
they'd have killed you.

799
00:55:44,143 --> 00:55:46,843
You just gotta stare 'em down.

800
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,446
- [Harris] I hear you
had a little accident.

801
00:55:52,446 --> 00:55:55,420
- It wasn't any accident, and you know it.

802
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,840
- Well, if it wasn't an accident

803
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,990
then I would say you're
in a lotta trouble.

804
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:03,760
- If Sam finds out you're
hounding the wrong man

805
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,210
you'll be in a lotta trouble.

806
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:09,170
- I'm not so sure you're
not the right man, Tommy.

807
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,510
Melissa has a list of 15 names.

808
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:16,533
I want you to collect
$200 from each of 'em.

809
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,430
- I'll double it.

810
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:22,973
- Well, that oughta make Sam real happy.

811
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,718
- Sorry to hear about your accident.

812
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:29,393
If you need a place to stay,
you let me know, sugar.

813
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,710
- You watch where you flick your matches.

814
00:56:42,077 --> 00:56:44,720
(Beth and Sandra laugh)

815
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,260
- Thanks for taking care of the kids.

816
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,173
- [Beth] Oh, sure.

817
00:56:48,834 --> 00:56:50,748
What about you?

818
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:52,670
- [Sandra] What about me?

819
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,223
- It's hard not to notice.

820
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:55,920
Come on, give.

821
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,823
- Oh no (laughs), it's that obvious?

822
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:05,993
Well, um, Tommy is nice,

823
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,830
but I really don't think I'm his type

824
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,733
with the kids and all, I just.

825
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,410
- Don't fight it too hard, Sandra,

826
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:16,903
not all men are jerks.

827
00:57:16,903 --> 00:57:21,390
- (laughs) I don't, stardust
only falls the first time.

828
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,827
After that, it's fear
every step of the way.

829
00:57:23,827 --> 00:57:27,017
- [Beth] (laughs) I hear that.

830
00:57:27,017 --> 00:57:30,017
(slow gentle music)

831
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:47,466
- [Tommy] Hi.

832
00:57:49,747 --> 00:57:50,914
- Tommy.
- 106.

833
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,180
- There's something I need to know.

834
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,370
- What?

835
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:57,743
- Well, it's about Melissa.

836
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,103
Did you ever have a thing with her?

837
00:58:05,323 --> 00:58:07,643
- Would it make any difference if I had?

838
00:58:09,974 --> 00:58:11,103
- Yeah, maybe.

839
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,807
- No, Sandra, I never did.

840
00:58:21,475 --> 00:58:22,475
I never did.

841
00:58:31,487 --> 00:58:33,683
You're not gettin' cold
feet on me, are ya?

842
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,800
- Well, I guess this is it, isn't it?

843
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,793
- You're late.

844
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,083
Have a seat, I think
you're gonna enjoy this.

845
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,030
- [Harris On Tape] Melissa
has a list of 15 names.

846
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:14,950
I want you to collect
$200 from each of 'em.

847
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,260
- [Tommy On Tape] I'll double it.

848
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:21,110
- [Harris On Tape] Well, that
oughta make Sam real happy.

849
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,440
- We've had a wire in
that office for a while.

850
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:29,963
You all think you could
get me a copy of that list?

851
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,683
Nice work.

852
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,650
Look, what I really need is

853
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,863
to hear Caldwell asking for money.

854
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,050
- Well, how do you plan to do that?

855
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,500
He never comes to the office.

856
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:04,970
- It's not easy to get a grand jury

857
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,183
to indict a public official like Caldwell.

858
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,603
We only get one shot.

859
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,590
Look, Tommy, I got a little something here

860
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:19,790
that might help you out.

861
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,430
The recorder fits in your boot.

862
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:31,800
The wire runs up your leg,

863
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,050
you tape the little
microphone to your chest.

864
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,910
Works like a charm.

865
01:00:38,231 --> 01:00:39,064
- Sandra?

866
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,003
- Nah uh.

867
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,890
- [John] This is your call.

868
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,010
- [MC] Testing, testing,

869
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:55,627
one, two (microphone screeches),

870
01:00:55,627 --> 01:00:57,023
testing one, two, three.

871
01:00:59,179 --> 01:01:00,440
- Say, it's quite a turnout, Sam,

872
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,190
even with the no-shows you're
gonna clear $20,000 easy.

873
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:05,507
Hi, darlin'.

874
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,860
- Well, a couple of fine
looking kids you got here.

875
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,309
You enjoying your dinner?

876
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:13,142
Are you?

877
01:01:13,142 --> 01:01:13,988
- What do you say?

878
01:01:13,988 --> 01:01:14,821
- All right.

879
01:01:14,821 --> 01:01:16,529
Fine looking boy, too, how are you?

880
01:01:16,529 --> 01:01:17,362
- Shane.

881
01:01:17,362 --> 01:01:18,195
- Yeah.

882
01:01:18,195 --> 01:01:19,157
- [MC] Let's give a round of applause

883
01:01:19,157 --> 01:01:20,803
for Commissioner Sam Caldwell.

884
01:01:22,269 --> 01:01:23,272
Come on, everybody.

885
01:01:23,272 --> 01:01:27,189
(audience cheers and applauds)

886
01:01:33,846 --> 01:01:34,846
- Hi, sugar.

887
01:01:37,901 --> 01:01:40,151
- Good crowd, lots of food.

888
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,693
- Well, I didn't come here to eat, honey.

889
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:45,747
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

890
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:48,503
thank you for that warm reception.

891
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,840
Thank you all for coming out here tonight.

892
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,260
- Why don't we go jump in a lake, huh?

893
01:01:56,231 --> 01:01:59,437
- Listen darling, I'm
working, you know that.

894
01:01:59,437 --> 01:02:01,587
- How come you don't
ever wanna work on me?

895
01:02:04,548 --> 01:02:07,120
I bet we could get your mind on something

896
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,520
a little more interesting
than all those trucks.

897
01:02:10,414 --> 01:02:13,262
(gasps) Oh no, silly ole me.

898
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:14,363
Oh, look what I done.

899
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,452
Oh, you're all wet.

900
01:02:16,452 --> 01:02:17,498
- That's all right, come on.

901
01:02:17,498 --> 01:02:20,240
- [Melissa] Oh, my,
my, all the drying off.

902
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,149
Here, I'm gonna get you nice and dry.

903
01:02:22,149 --> 01:02:24,580
- [Tommy] No, hey, hey, hey, it's fine.

904
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,599
- Tommy, what is that?

905
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:26,918
- [Tommy] Come on, here.

906
01:02:26,918 --> 01:02:30,168
(slow dramatic music)

907
01:02:33,494 --> 01:02:36,836
- [Sam] So thank you all
for your generous support.

908
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:40,241
- Why Tommy I didn't
know you had it in you.

909
01:02:40,241 --> 01:02:41,360
- Uh, listen, I know you probably

910
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,990
didn't come here for the food,

911
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,500
and I've already heard the Caldwell talk,

912
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,863
so why don't we go for that swim?

913
01:02:52,181 --> 01:02:56,098
(audience cheers and applauds)

914
01:03:15,129 --> 01:03:18,046
(car engine whirs)

915
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:29,324
(car door slams)

916
01:03:35,714 --> 01:03:38,631
(knocking on door)

917
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:48,792
- Hey, it's me.

918
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,063
- Oh.

919
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,253
Hot date, huh?

920
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,393
- Well, I don't know
if I'd call it a date.

921
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:08,897
- What would you call it?

922
01:04:08,897 --> 01:04:10,060
The last time I saw

923
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,060
you were pretty wrapped up in your work.

924
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,300
- Yeah, well, I figured I had a choice.

925
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,370
You know, here I'd take Melissa out,

926
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:20,957
or Mitchell will take me out, permanently.

927
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,610
- She didn't find the wire, did she?

928
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:28,830
- Well, yeah, she might of seen something.

929
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:32,070
But she's so drunk I don't
think she'll remember, you know.

930
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,423
I mean she passed out
before I got her home.

931
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:38,500
I took her mind off it.

932
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,990
- See if we can take your mind off her.

933
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,407
- Yeah, that'll help.

934
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,120
- You can't go back into work.

935
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,720
- No, I gotta go right back in.

936
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,400
I gotta go in like nothing
happened whatsoever.

937
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,400
- You can't, what if Melissa
wasn't really so drunk?

938
01:05:21,603 --> 01:05:22,903
What if she does remember?

939
01:05:29,075 --> 01:05:30,242
- [Tommy] Yep.

940
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,343
(slow intense music)

941
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:04,120
(men chatter)

942
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,099
- [Mitchell] I said let's go.

943
01:06:15,099 --> 01:06:17,599
In the car bigmouth, let's go.

944
01:06:51,281 --> 01:06:52,300
- [Man] FBI.

945
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,790
- I need to speak to Special
Agent Curtis, please.

946
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:58,630
- [Man] Special Agent Curtis
is not available just now.

947
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,814
Would you care to leave a
number where he could reach you?

948
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:00,647
- Sandra?

949
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:04,300
Honey, don't you have
a phone at your desk?

950
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:09,400
You know we're having a
little party next week,

951
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,440
and Mr. Wiley would like me
to be sure that you're there.

952
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,890
Now you don't wanna put
me in a bad light do you?

953
01:07:16,304 --> 01:07:19,221
(slow tense music)

954
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:46,097
- All right, get out of the car.

955
01:07:48,145 --> 01:07:49,728
You wanted to talk?

956
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:52,879
Let's talk.

957
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,704
(Melissa chuckles)

958
01:08:30,943 --> 01:08:32,863
- You got a big mouth, Tommy.

959
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:37,590
- You knew about the marijuana, Harris,

960
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:39,010
and the women and the tobacco barn,

961
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:40,843
maybe it was you, maybe it was Mitch.

962
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:43,733
- No, it was you, Tommy.

963
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:47,810
Melissa saw the wire.

964
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,700
- What wire, she saw nothin'.

965
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,027
All right, she's got the hots for me,

966
01:08:51,027 --> 01:08:51,860
you all know that,

967
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,380
and she was all over me last night.

968
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:54,850
She got mad when I said no.

969
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:55,830
- She wouldn't lie to me.

970
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:58,360
- Well, she did, okay.

971
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,870
She wanted to get even with me.

972
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,270
She was drunk and that's it.

973
01:09:04,588 --> 01:09:06,570
You know, Sam's gonna love this.

974
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:08,200
You kill me, he gets murder one.

975
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,763
And your deep throat?

976
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:11,740
Keeps on talking.

977
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,190
- Better stop right there, boy.

978
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,380
- I got work to do.

979
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:34,880
- Okay, Mitch, put it away.

980
01:10:26,173 --> 01:10:27,923
- Scared me to death.

981
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:30,977
You could've got yourself killed.

982
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:31,810
- I'm okay.

983
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:38,210
- I just don't ever wanna lose you.

984
01:10:51,808 --> 01:10:54,280
(gun fires)

985
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,180
Kicks like a mule.

986
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,916
- Yeah, all right, move
a little further forward.

987
01:10:59,916 --> 01:11:03,107
All right, relax your
arms a little bit too.

988
01:11:03,107 --> 01:11:05,043
Loosen them up a little bit.

989
01:11:05,043 --> 01:11:07,376
Okay, what are you gonna do?

990
01:11:08,373 --> 01:11:10,373
Exhale, squeeze slowly--

991
01:11:11,857 --> 01:11:13,212
- Honey, don't.

992
01:11:13,212 --> 01:11:14,295
- Don't pull.

993
01:11:15,845 --> 01:11:17,266
(gun fires)

994
01:11:17,266 --> 01:11:21,006
Beautiful, good shootin, Sundance.

995
01:11:21,006 --> 01:11:22,678
- Thank you.

996
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,141
- Let's hope you never have to use it.

997
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:28,251
- Yeah, but if I do, I
damn sure wanna know how.

998
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:30,510
(guns fires)

999
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:32,593
- The grand jury convenes next month.

1000
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,913
You're the key witness.

1001
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,290
The hearing will be closed.

1002
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:39,563
- [Sandra] And?

1003
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,260
- Grand jury proceedings are secret,

1004
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,630
no press, no public.

1005
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:47,410
I can keep your involvement there hidden,

1006
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:51,283
but if we get the
indictment against Caldwell,

1007
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,373
you're gonna have to testify.

1008
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,400
- In court?

1009
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,463
- In open court.

1010
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:02,343
- A grand jury can indict him,

1011
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,543
but only a court can convict him.

1012
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:09,363
It will be a public trial.

1013
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:18,340
Look, I don't want you to put
yourselves in anymore danger.

1014
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,823
I'll understand if you
choose not to go forward.

1015
01:12:26,629 --> 01:12:30,573
- (sighs) Look, I'm tired and I'm scared,

1016
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:33,367
but I'm not about to back down now.

1017
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,983
- Are you sure?

1018
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:43,720
- Well, it's just a jailhouse rumor, Sam,

1019
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:48,313
but the whisper is this is
going to the grand jury.

1020
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:50,870
- Who's investigating?

1021
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,467
Will you put that damn thing away!

1022
01:12:55,278 --> 01:12:57,410
- Well, I hate to be the one to say, Sam,

1023
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,233
but it's the feds.

1024
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:03,498
- It's that damn newspaper, isn't it?

1025
01:13:03,498 --> 01:13:06,800
- (coughs) I don't rightly know, Sam.

1026
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,653
- Don't you Sam me!

1027
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,821
Get off your fat butt and fix it.

1028
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:15,280
- I can't do that, Commissioner.

1029
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,730
- What do you mean you can't?

1030
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:19,297
- Those Washington boys,

1031
01:13:19,297 --> 01:13:21,510
they're like mean ole ticks.

1032
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:24,510
One smell of blood, they just
burrow right on in (chuckles).

1033
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:30,393
- This isn't Washington, boy.

1034
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,023
This is Georgia.

1035
01:13:34,538 --> 01:13:37,705
(slow delicate music)

1036
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:41,530
- Listen, your mom
wanted me to talk to you.

1037
01:13:43,594 --> 01:13:45,540
(camera clicks)

1038
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,520
- You set the ASA?

1039
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:50,166
- Nope, forgot.

1040
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,203
You know these guys we work for?

1041
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:58,363
Well, we've been trying
to put him in jail.

1042
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,193
Now it's all about to hit the fan.

1043
01:14:02,193 --> 01:14:03,933
Things are getting a little,

1044
01:14:06,261 --> 01:14:07,511
well, a little dangerous.

1045
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,593
- Is that why my mother sleeps
with a gun under her pillow?

1046
01:14:16,611 --> 01:14:19,278
(camera clicks)

1047
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:31,956
- Well, we're working with the FBI.

1048
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,820
I'm gonna have to testify
before a grand jury,

1049
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:39,253
I might have to leave
town for a little while.

1050
01:14:42,637 --> 01:14:45,130
- What about my mom.

1051
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:48,727
If you go away, she won't
have anyone, will she?

1052
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,119
- Sure she will.

1053
01:14:54,144 --> 01:14:55,894
Someone real special.

1054
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,130
- I'll be waiting right here.

1055
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,213
- I promised Shane I'd take
him fishing this summer.

1056
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,653
- I don't think Shane has
anything to worry about.

1057
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,473
- [Tommy] Okay.

1058
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,603
- There's all this food.

1059
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,393
- [Tommy] Thanks.

1060
01:15:51,393 --> 01:15:52,226
- [Sandra] Mm hmm.

1061
01:15:52,226 --> 01:15:53,273
- Almost done, here it comes.

1062
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:57,720
- [TV Reporter] Due to
unexpected rainfall--

1063
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,553
- [Tommy] Where's Shane?

1064
01:15:58,553 --> 01:16:00,688
Shane, come on up, here it is.

1065
01:16:00,688 --> 01:16:02,271
Come on, hop along.

1066
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,260
- [TV Reporter] And now here's Brian.

1067
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:07,471
- [Brian On TV] On the local front,

1068
01:16:07,471 --> 01:16:09,870
a federal grand jury has indicted

1069
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:12,752
Labor Commissioner Sam
Caldwell on fraud charges.

1070
01:16:12,752 --> 01:16:13,585
- [Tommy] Nice!

1071
01:16:13,585 --> 01:16:14,418
(Sandra laughs)

1072
01:16:14,418 --> 01:16:15,730
- [Brian] The eight count
indictment is the result

1073
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,290
of an ongoing investigation

1074
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:18,910
which began when The Georgia Gazette

1075
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:20,550
reported widespread corruption

1076
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:22,290
inside the Department of Labor.

1077
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:24,018
A trail is to expected
to begin next month.

1078
01:16:24,018 --> 01:16:25,087
(Shane and Tommy shout)

1079
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:27,748
(phone rings)

1080
01:16:27,748 --> 01:16:31,081
(all chatter excitedly)

1081
01:16:34,254 --> 01:16:35,171
- How, how?

1082
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:39,923
Fine, all right.

1083
01:16:41,151 --> 01:16:43,023
I understand, we'll call you back.

1084
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:47,153
- Sandra, what do you think of that?

1085
01:16:51,969 --> 01:16:52,802
What's wrong?

1086
01:16:52,802 --> 01:16:53,635
- Curtis.

1087
01:16:57,423 --> 01:16:58,423
- What is it?

1088
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,916
- There's been a leak.

1089
01:17:02,758 --> 01:17:04,591
They know who you are.

1090
01:17:09,223 --> 01:17:10,056
(reporters chatter)

1091
01:17:10,056 --> 01:17:12,650
- Mr. Caldwell.
- Mr. Caldwell.

1092
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,450
- [Reporter] Do you plan to resign, sir?

1093
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:17,680
- I'm confident that a jury
will clear my good name

1094
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,817
and now, ladies and gentlemen,

1095
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:20,754
the job training bill needs me.

1096
01:17:20,754 --> 01:17:21,587
Excuse me.

1097
01:17:21,587 --> 01:17:23,110
- The Georgia Gazette
reported widespread--

1098
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:25,800
- Georgia Gazette, don't
tell me you read that rag.

1099
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,880
I, for one, am proud to say I read our own

1100
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,253
Atlanta Constitution, thank you.

1101
01:17:30,253 --> 01:17:32,620
- [Reporter] Well, what
about Mr. Marchant, sir?

1102
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:35,350
- Mr. Marchant is a
disgruntled state employee,

1103
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,480
and I may add a liar.

1104
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,410
And as of today, Mr.
Marchant no longer works

1105
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,689
for the Georgia Department
of Labor, please--

1106
01:17:42,689 --> 01:17:43,522
- [Man In White Shirt]
Commissioner, commissioner--

1107
01:17:43,522 --> 01:17:44,870
- Young man, if I were you,

1108
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,498
I'd get outta my way!

1109
01:17:46,498 --> 01:17:48,900
(reporters chatter)

1110
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,563
- It seems that somebody
planted a bug in my office.

1111
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:53,573
You know who?

1112
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,393
- No, sir.

1113
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,110
- It also seems that Tommy Marchant

1114
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,873
testified before the grand jury.

1115
01:18:04,248 --> 01:18:05,081
- He did?

1116
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:09,280
Well, what does that got
to do with me, Mr. Wiley?

1117
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:16,960
- I know that you and
Tommy are close friends.

1118
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,347
- Yes, sir, I have a number
of close friends, so?

1119
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,580
- Atlanta just slashed my budget.

1120
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,030
I'm gonna have to let you go.

1121
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,070
- I really need this job, Mr. Wiley.

1122
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:33,923
- Doesn't have to be like this, you know.

1123
01:18:33,923 --> 01:18:34,756
- [Sandra] No?

1124
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:36,453
- No, you're a smart woman.

1125
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:41,123
- Well, how smart do I have to be?

1126
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:43,960
- Smart enough to be a team player.

1127
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:47,010
- What's a team player expected to do?

1128
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,110
- A team player's expected to care

1129
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:52,560
about her boss, the commissioner.

1130
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,810
A team player's expected
to testify for him

1131
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:58,303
against Tommy Marchant
if push comes to shove.

1132
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:05,438
- That's some very serious team playing.

1133
01:19:05,438 --> 01:19:06,271
- [Harris] Mm hmm.

1134
01:19:06,271 --> 01:19:07,871
- Can you let me think about it?

1135
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:11,140
- Well, you do that then.

1136
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,017
- I really need this job, Mr. Wiley.

1137
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,640
You can't put it off any
longer, you gotta go.

1138
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,600
- [Tommy] I'm not running.

1139
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,010
- It's not running, Tommy.

1140
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,420
They'll put you in a safe house.

1141
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,900
- Yeah, where I can't call
you, can't see the kids.

1142
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:35,733
- [Sandra] Tommy, please.

1143
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:37,420
- And what if there's a leak in the FBI?

1144
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:40,760
All right, I'm hiding out here in town.

1145
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,024
- I want you safe.

1146
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:43,501
- [Tommy] Well, I don't
wanna talk about it.

1147
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:44,334
- Would you just listen.

1148
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:46,003
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1149
01:19:47,151 --> 01:19:50,970
(slow subdued music)

1150
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,863
- Why are you guys yelling?

1151
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:55,800
It woke me up.

1152
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,470
- Oh, sweetheart, come here.

1153
01:19:59,046 --> 01:20:00,796
Come here, I'm sorry.

1154
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,110
- Sorry, darlin', didn't
mean to talk so loud.

1155
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:11,445
- Are you gonna leave like daddy did?

1156
01:20:11,445 --> 01:20:12,612
- [Sandra] Oh.

1157
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,533
- No, sweetheart.

1158
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,967
- Tommy may have to go
away for a little while,

1159
01:20:22,967 --> 01:20:24,467
but he'll be back.

1160
01:20:25,497 --> 01:20:27,453
Back to bed, okay?

1161
01:20:27,453 --> 01:20:29,690
- Okay.

1162
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:30,647
- Goodnight, Tommy.

1163
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,970
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

1164
01:20:47,097 --> 01:20:48,180
- Hey, Tommy?

1165
01:20:53,144 --> 01:20:56,090
I just wanna say I'm
glad you're not gonna run

1166
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:57,190
like mom wants you to.

1167
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:04,593
- Shane, your mom's the
bravest person I ever met.

1168
01:21:07,617 --> 01:21:09,117
You must be very proud of her.

1169
01:21:12,062 --> 01:21:13,395
- Yeah, I guess.

1170
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:19,080
- Shane, look, I'm no big hero.

1171
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,550
Okay, I'm scared to death.

1172
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:24,070
I know these boys, but if I
run like the FBI wants me to

1173
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:26,073
I won't see your mom for a long time.

1174
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:32,935
And I've been waiting for
someone like her my whole life.

1175
01:21:41,161 --> 01:21:43,661
I'm not gonna give her up now.

1176
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:45,950
Simple as that.

1177
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,793
- She know that?

1178
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,260
- I believe she does.

1179
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:14,883
- I've slept on it, Mr. Wiley.

1180
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,720
You want me to testify

1181
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,343
for Mr. Caldwell against Mr. Marchant.

1182
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:24,860
- That's right.

1183
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,653
- And if I do, I can keep my job.

1184
01:22:28,195 --> 01:22:29,028
- Correct.

1185
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:33,740
- Well, it seems to me that
if I'm gonna join the team,

1186
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:37,103
I ought to be awarded a position
of greater responsibility.

1187
01:22:40,316 --> 01:22:43,773
- (chuckles) Why Sandra,

1188
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:54,003
well, I think you better call me Harris.

1189
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:57,080
You're a tough woman, Sandra.

1190
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,563
- Yes, I am, Harris.

1191
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:07,383
- Well, I think I can
swing a promotion, yeah.

1192
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:13,363
- And what do I say against
Tommy Marchant, Harris?

1193
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,240
- I bet if you tried real hard,

1194
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,340
I can't tell you what to say,

1195
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:22,510
but if you tried real hard

1196
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:25,070
I bet you could remember
something that said to you.

1197
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:26,133
- Such as?

1198
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:34,030
- Such as the time that Tommy Marchant

1199
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:36,933
offered you a promotion in
return for sexual favors.

1200
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:44,600
Or the time that Mr. Marchant

1201
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,933
had you double bill the
state for per diem claims.

1202
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:52,620
- I can't tell you what
pleasure this gives me.

1203
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:54,040
I got him cold, didn't I?

1204
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,173
What's wrong?

1205
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:00,940
Something the matter with the tape?

1206
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,540
- No, it's not the tape, Sandra.

1207
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:07,078
We got a tip, there's a
contract out on Tommy.

1208
01:24:07,078 --> 01:24:09,660
(slow unsettling music)

1209
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:12,100
You know, I can't protect
him if he won't come in.

1210
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,660
- I'll get in touch with him.

1211
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:15,660
- You think he'll listen?

1212
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:17,536
- I don't know.

1213
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:20,453
(slow tense music)

1214
01:25:20,369 --> 01:25:21,202
- [Sandra] You okay?

1215
01:25:21,202 --> 01:25:22,393
- [Tommy] Yeah, I'm having a ball.

1216
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,321
- Curtis wants you to come in.

1217
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:27,154
- Yeah?

1218
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:32,956
(slow suspenseful music)

1219
01:25:34,185 --> 01:25:36,185
We had that talk before.

1220
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:39,610
- Yeah, well, I guess we're
gonna have to have it again.

1221
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:40,693
- Afraid not.

1222
01:25:43,426 --> 01:25:46,093
(shotgun fires)

1223
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,960
Let's go, get in the car.

1224
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:58,836
They must have followed you.

1225
01:25:58,836 --> 01:25:59,736
- Oh my God, the kids.

1226
01:25:59,736 --> 01:26:01,403
Tommy, get the kids.

1227
01:26:21,986 --> 01:26:24,243
I'll kill 'em if they hurt my babies.

1228
01:26:24,243 --> 01:26:25,826
- [Tommy] Let's go.

1229
01:26:36,949 --> 01:26:38,453
- Oh, sweetheart.

1230
01:26:38,453 --> 01:26:40,334
- [Tommy] Shane!

1231
01:26:40,334 --> 01:26:41,167
Shane!

1232
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:46,435
- [Sandra] You're sleepy,
come back up here.

1233
01:26:46,435 --> 01:26:47,648
Jump up on your bed.

1234
01:26:47,648 --> 01:26:50,510
Let's get this around your shoulders.

1235
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:53,190
- For God's sake, no
they took a shot at us.

1236
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:54,440
Could have killed Sandra.

1237
01:26:56,276 --> 01:26:57,740
- I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go.

1238
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,293
- Shannon, please, just
don't fuss, all right?

1239
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:02,403
- [Tommy] No, we're going to Beth's.

1240
01:27:02,403 --> 01:27:04,260
- [Sandra] Move it, Shane, come on, baby.

1241
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:05,093
- Right.

1242
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:07,070
- [Shane] What are we doing?

1243
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:08,924
What is going on?

1244
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:13,924
- No, yeah, no they're
coming with us, both of them.

1245
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,696
Of course, all right, go ahead, why not.

1246
01:27:15,696 --> 01:27:16,616
- [Sandra] Look out.

1247
01:27:16,616 --> 01:27:17,850
Here we go, up we go.

1248
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:20,423
- [Tommy] Just tell
your men meet us there.

1249
01:27:24,018 --> 01:27:27,351
(police radio chatters)

1250
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:44,170
- [Officer] Is everybody okay?

1251
01:27:48,649 --> 01:27:50,732
- [Tommy] Let's go on in.

1252
01:27:58,170 --> 01:27:59,120
- [John] They took a shot at you?

1253
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,103
- Well, they're not
exactly a friendly bunch.

1254
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:06,540
- She gonna be all right?

1255
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:10,643
- You ever had to talk back to a shotgun?

1256
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:16,963
- Look, Tommy, we need her testimony.

1257
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,373
Without it we might as well just go home.

1258
01:28:23,756 --> 01:28:24,589
- I know.

1259
01:28:25,539 --> 01:28:28,548
- [John] Look, come on.

1260
01:28:28,548 --> 01:28:29,381
Sorry about--

1261
01:28:29,381 --> 01:28:30,345
- [Tommy] Oh, it's all right.

1262
01:28:30,345 --> 01:28:32,595
I appreciate you coming in.

1263
01:28:36,843 --> 01:28:38,660
- Mom, don't worry, okay.

1264
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:41,233
I'll take care of Shannon,
everything will be okay.

1265
01:28:44,389 --> 01:28:46,989
- I know I'm the last person
to lecture you, Sandra.

1266
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:49,530
- If I testify they could...

1267
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,323
It's not me I'm worried about.

1268
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:58,260
- Go for it, mom.

1269
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:04,323
- Could go on for a long time, honey.

1270
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:10,983
- Remember when you came

1271
01:29:10,983 --> 01:29:12,700
and talked to me about that reporter?

1272
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:17,640
I remember that night at the hospital.

1273
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:20,663
I remember.

1274
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:26,650
My daughter's never gonna feel that way.

1275
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,680
Do it for your kids, Sandra.

1276
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,033
- I love you.

1277
01:29:51,591 --> 01:29:52,924
Thank you, Beth.

1278
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:05,563
- Will you state your name
for the record, please.

1279
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,243
- My name is Sandra Clayton.

1280
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:14,730
- And Miss Clayton,
could you tell this court

1281
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:17,730
what position you hold with the
Georgia Department of Labor?

1282
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:21,833
- I am a secretary.

1283
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:28,033
- Are you acquainted with the
defendant, Mr. Sam Caldwell?

1284
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:39,493
- Yes.

1285
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,943
(mid-tempo dramatic music)

1286
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:53,922
- [Beth] Come on, come on, come on, honey.

1287
01:30:53,922 --> 01:30:55,563
Everyone, everyone, a toast.

1288
01:30:57,170 --> 01:31:01,263
To Tommy and Sandra, my best
friends, may stardust fall.

1289
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,127
- [All] Cheers.

1290
01:31:04,127 --> 01:31:07,294
(slow delicate music)

1291
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:10,745
- [Tommy] Are we ready to cut this thing?

1292
01:31:10,745 --> 01:31:12,309
All right, sweetheart.

1293
01:31:12,309 --> 01:31:14,237
Come on up, you wanna see this?

1294
01:31:14,237 --> 01:31:15,070
- Okay.

1295
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:16,987
- This is a big moment.

1296
01:31:18,863 --> 01:31:19,696
All right.

1297
01:31:23,414 --> 01:31:26,997
(guests cheer and applaud)

1298
01:31:33,773 --> 01:31:35,440
That's a sweet kiss.

1299
01:31:36,464 --> 01:31:38,101
Your mom's a good kisser.

1300
01:31:38,101 --> 01:31:41,050
- Tommy, this is from the three of us.

1301
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:42,240
- You're kiddin'.

1302
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,170
Well, look from the three, you too?

1303
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:45,860
All right, lemme see.

1304
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:46,938
Let's, here, will you come on over here.

1305
01:31:46,938 --> 01:31:47,780
- [Beth] Yeah, I got her.

1306
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:48,834
- Thank you, grab her arm.

1307
01:31:48,834 --> 01:31:50,030
- There you go.

1308
01:31:50,030 --> 01:31:51,920
- [Shannon] Guess, Tommy.

1309
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,710
- A fishing reel.

1310
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:56,360
No, oh, man, Shane, this is,

1311
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,971
look at this ladies and gentlemen.

1312
01:31:57,971 --> 01:31:59,361
(all clap)

1313
01:31:59,361 --> 01:32:00,278
Thanks pal.

1314
01:32:01,193 --> 01:32:02,261
- It's a DASA.

1315
01:32:02,261 --> 01:32:03,094
- And that's strong.

1316
01:32:03,094 --> 01:32:04,047
- No, I won't.

1317
01:32:04,047 --> 01:32:05,739
- Don't do that, not that close!

1318
01:32:05,739 --> 01:32:07,958
- You look good this close,
all right, all right.

1319
01:32:07,958 --> 01:32:09,012
Well, let's set one up.

1320
01:32:09,012 --> 01:32:10,060
What do you think, is this loaded?

1321
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:10,893
- Yeah.

1322
01:32:10,893 --> 01:32:12,357
- [Tommy] All right, you go ahead.

1323
01:32:12,357 --> 01:32:13,535
- [Beth] Okay, all right, great.

1324
01:32:13,535 --> 01:32:14,644
- [Shannon] Where're
you gonna stand, Tommy?

1325
01:32:14,644 --> 01:32:15,477
- [Tommy] I'm gonna stand
right next to your momma, hon.

1326
01:32:15,477 --> 01:32:16,986
- [Sandra] Come here, Shannon.

1327
01:32:16,986 --> 01:32:18,490
- Now how do you work this thing?

1328
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:19,893
Okay, guys, ready?

1329
01:32:20,922 --> 01:32:22,167
- [Shannon] But I wanna stand next to--

1330
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:25,403
- [Sandra] Okay, okay, okay,
Shane, you come over here.

1331
01:32:25,403 --> 01:32:27,533

(camera clicks)

1333
01:32:31,347 --> 01:32:32,203
Beautiful.

1334
01:32:32,203 --> 01:32:33,434
- [Sandra] One more for good luck.

1335
01:32:33,434 --> 01:32:34,267
- Okay.

1336
01:32:38,032 --> 01:32:39,912
All right, smile.

1337
01:32:39,912 --> 01:32:40,772

1338
01:32:40,772 --> 01:32:44,355

1339
01:32:46,101 --> 01:32:48,306
