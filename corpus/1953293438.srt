A LITTLE BIT MORE GENERIC

IT WAS THE THEME

315
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,413

01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,669
YOUR BOOK CLUB WILL NOT
SPARE A PAGE TO REMIND PEOPLE

1495
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:50,338
THAT CARSON PHILLIPS
WAS ZAPPED IN THE PARKING LOT.

1496
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,940
SIR, THOSE PAGES
ARE RESERVED FOR PROM.

1497
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:56,010
- I'M JUST SAYING ONE PAGE.
- PLANT A TREE.

1498
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:58,613
HOW DO I BEGIN
TO DESCRIBE CARSON PHILLIPS?

1499
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:01,816
<i>[CARSON] I NEVER GRADUATED,</i>
<i>I NEVER WENT TO NORTHWESTERN,</i>

1500
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:04,251
<i>I NEVER WROTE</i>
<i>FOR "THE NEW YORKER,"</i>

1501
01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:06,654
<i>I NEVER WON</i>
<i>THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE,</i>

1502
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:08,956
<i>I NEVER CHANGED THE WORLD.</i>

1503
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:13,761
<i>I NEVER GOT OUT OF CLOVER.</i>

1504
01:17:13,763 --> 01:17:15,997
<i>- [CARSON] IT'S A LOT LIKE...</i>
<i>- [MALERIE] LIGHTNING.</i>

1505
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:18,099
<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>YEAH, EXACTLY.</i>

1506
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:21,268
<i>THESE WERE JUST DELUSIONS</i>
<i>THAT OCCUPIED MY TIME.</i>

1507
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:23,638
<i>AND THANK GOD THEY DID.</i>

1508
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,107
<i>[CLAIRE]</i>
<i>OKAY, SO WE ALL AGREE,</i>

1509
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:29,210
LEOPARD PRINT WILL BE OUR THEME
FOR OUR SAFARI PROM.

1510
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:31,779
AND OF COURSE
IT WILL ALL BE FAUX FUR.

1511
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:34,281
<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>BECAUSE A LIFE WITHOUT</i>
<i>MEANING, WITHOUT DRIVE,</i>

1512
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:37,118
<i>- WITHOUT FOCUS...</i>
<i>- ON SECOND THOUGHT,</i>

1513
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,121
THE SAFARI PROM IDEA
KINDA SUCKS.

1514
01:17:40,123 --> 01:17:42,790
LET'S COME UP
WITH SOMETHING BETTER.

1515
01:17:42,792 --> 01:17:45,793
<i>[CARSON]</i>
<i>WITHOUT GOALS OR DREAMS...</i>

1516
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:58,139

<i>LIFE COMES AT YOU FAST,</i>

1521
01:18:08,985 --> 01:18:11,752

<i>AND TRIES TO ESCAPE</i>

1522
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:14,689
<i>AND BE EXPRESSED</i>
<i>IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.</i>
