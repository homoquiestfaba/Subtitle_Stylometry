1
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,624
What is this place?

2
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,333
My life doesn't really make sense.

3
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,541
Hey.

4
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,458
I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.

5
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,791
"Scott, you're a divorced ex-con.
How are you an Avenger?

6
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,749
"Why are you time traveling
with Captain America?

7
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,374
"That doesn't make sense."

8
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:09,833
A lot has changed about my life.

9
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:12,499
But everywhere I go,
people ask me the same thing.

10
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,874
Can you take a picture with my dog?

11
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,374
"Scott, what about now?

12
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,583
"What's next?

13
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,249
"Where does the ride take you?"

14
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,124
If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.

15
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,291
All right.

16
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,833
-It's been a crazy few years. For everyone.
-Hey, hi. How are you?

17
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,457
Everything is ready for you.

18
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:30,624
You're too much.

19
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,166
No, no, no.

20
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:33,374
Your money's no good here.

21
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:35,999
-Are we still talking about that?
-Yes, of course.

22
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,416
Rubin, you are the best.

23
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,207
Thank you, Spider-Man.

24
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:45,832
So, let's make time for the stuff
that really matters.

25
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,291
Like friends.

26
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,999
Friends you didn't even know you had.

27
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:54,124
Remember the people who got you here.

28
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,541
You couldn't have done it without them.

29
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,499
Hey, I'm just a guy who got fired
from Baskin-Robbins.

30
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:02,166
Sometimes you just get lucky.

31
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,291
I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.

32
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:05,791
I think you know who she is.

33
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,082
She's taken back her dad's company.

34
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,957
Now she's using the Pym Particle
for global change.

35
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,416
A lot of people say they want
to save the world...

36
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:17,416
but Hope, she saves it every day.

37
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,541
Thank you.

38
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:21,332
Thank you so much.

39
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:25,374
Reforestation. Affordable housing.
Food production.

40
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,207
She's not wasting a second.

41
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,416
I still can't believe it.

42
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,874
None of this should have happened.

43
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,041
But it did.

44
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:42,707
It's a pretty good world.

45
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:44,582
I'm glad we saved it.

46
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:47,416
"Do I miss the action?

47
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,749
"Sometimes.

48
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,291
"Will I be there when the Avengers need me?

49
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,416
"Absolutely.

50
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,374
"I'd never turn my back on them.

51
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,374
"But right now, the only job I want
is being a dad.

52
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:01,874
"I love you, Cassie.

53
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:04,582
"Thanks for being my hero.

54
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:08,207
"And I'm sorry I missed some birthdays.

55
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,124
"And for the rest of you kids out there...

56
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:13,416
"word of advice.

57
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:15,957
"Look out for the little guy.

58
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:17,374
"Make mistakes.

59
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,541
"Take chances.

60
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:22,624
"Because if there's one thing
life's taught me...

61
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:26,291
"there's always room to grow."

62
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,166
Sorry, that's me.

63
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,332
Why is jail calling?

64
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:39,832
Lang!

65
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,707
-Lang!
-I'm here.

66
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,374
All right, come on. Let's go.

67
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:47,457
Come on.

68
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:53,832
Hey. Is she okay? Have you heard anything?

69
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:54,999
Not yet. No.

70
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:57,499
Hi, Hope.
Hey, Dad.

71
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,416
Cassie. What happened?

72
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:00,582
Sign here.

73
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:03,541
You know, just jail stuff.

74
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:05,374
Give it back.

75
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:07,749
I know it was you.

76
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:08,957
Are you sure?

77
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:10,374
I mean, it was kind of hard to see...

78
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:13,457
through all that tear gas you fired
into the park full of peaceful protestors.

79
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,374
Where is it?

80
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,541
I'm sorry.
This must be really embarrassing for you.

81
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:21,707
I did find this though.

82
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,541
You shrank a cop car?

83
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:29,832
What were you thinking?

84
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,707
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

85
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,791
They were clearing out a homeless camp
in the middle of the night.

86
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:35,707
-No, I'm not saying that...
-And where do they expect them to go?

87
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:37,791
It's not their fault that they lost
their homes in the Blip.

88
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:38,791
I know that.

89
00:06:38,957 --> 00:06:41,874
No one can even afford rent right now,
unless you're some trust-fund asshole.

90
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,124
I'm not telling you what to do.

91
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:44,624
-I'm just saying...
-Telling her what to do.

92
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,082
Telling me exactly what to do.

93
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,749
No, you do what you want.

94
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,499
I'm suggesting another way to do it.

95
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:50,874
Okay.

96
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,374
You know, I promised your mom...

97
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,999
that you would only use this stuff
when one of us was around.

98
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,166
It's really dangerous tech.

99
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,624
I know it's dangerous.

100
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,082
What if the cops took it from you?
What if you lost it?

101
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:01,249
I didn't lose the suit.

102
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:02,249
You have a suit?

103
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:03,624
Wait, you have a suit?

104
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:05,124
I know how to
take care of myself, okay?

105
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,165
Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.

106
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Ouch.

107
00:07:11,582 --> 00:07:13,040
-I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
-I know.

108
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:14,499
That's okay. It's all right.

109
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:15,749
I get it.

110
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,457
I just think you should get
to have a normal life.

111
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:20,374
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee...

112
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:22,415
tried to kill me in my room when I was six.

113
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:25,124
I've never had a normal life.

114
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:27,874
How about some music?

115
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:30,499
"And in that moment, all I could think was...

116
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:33,082
"'How did the Hulk turn me into a baby?

117
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:35,082
"'Will I be a baby forever?

118
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:36,457
"'Am I the Hulk's baby?'"

119
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,332
Dad, are you listening to your own book?

120
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,832
-"But I was ready for anything.
-Hmm? No, that's...

121
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:42,582
-It's just the radio.
-"Steve and I grew close over that."

122
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:44,207
-Dad, turn it off.
-It's so weird.

123
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:46,207
Something's wrong with this switch.
It won't turn off.

124
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:47,415
I said turn it off.

125
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:48,832
What's that? Turn it up? All right.

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,540
"A little after that,
a raccoon from space showed up.

127
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:53,332
"I don't think he knew my name.

128
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:55,832
"I was just happy to meet a raccoon
who could talk."

129
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:00,582
Excuse me.

130
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:01,790
Thank you.

131
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:04,707
All right.

132
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:07,874
Your Nobel Prize is in the mail.

133
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,582
It better be. I just saved eight bucks.

134
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,707
God, I admire you.

135
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:14,124
Thank you.

136
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,915
I missed this.

137
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:18,790
No pizza in the Quantum Realm?

138
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,874
No. No anything.

139
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:24,332
You know, Mom, you can talk about it.

140
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:25,832
If you want.

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.

142
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,624
I wanna live right now.

143
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:39,874
So, Cassie, did you make any new friends
in the slammer this time?

144
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:41,165
Grandpa.

145
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
"This time"?

146
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,249
Was there a last time?

147
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:46,290
I mean, last time barely counts.

148
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:48,415
I didn't know that.

149
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,457
Why didn't you call me?

150
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:50,832
'Cause I knew you'd be like this.

151
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,832
I would've just broken you out with ants.

152
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,374
All right, you know what? Family meeting.

153
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,540
Can we have a family meeting?

154
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:56,749
Isn't that what we're doing?

155
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:57,874
Yeah, I mean about this.

156
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,915
About everybody being so fine with this.

157
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,915
Look, you wanna help. I get it.

158
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:05,540
I do, Cassie. I really do.

159
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:06,999
But I don't want you wasting your life.

160
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,290
At least I'm still trying to
do something with mine.

161
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:13,499
I literally saved the world.

162
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:14,499
Oh, did you?

163
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:16,374
Well, yeah, you never mentioned
that before.

164
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,165
Hey, everybody, Scott saved the world.

165
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:19,499
How was that for you, Scott?

166
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:20,915
You should write a book about it.

167
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:22,540
Ha ha. Hilarious.

168
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:24,582
Yeah, you're welcome for all not being dust.

169
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:26,207
And what do you do now?

170
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:29,332
Sign books?

171
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:32,332
Aren't you the guy who broke into VistaCorp?

172
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:34,290
Aren't you the guy who flew all the way
to Germany...

173
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:36,374
just to fight Captain America at the airport?

174
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:38,707
Fight with Captain America at the airport.

175
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:41,499
Wouldn't fight Captain America.

176
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,665
Not insane.

177
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,915
People still need help, Dad.

178
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:48,749
At least we're trying to do something
that matters.

179
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:53,290
Who's "we"?

180
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,540
What are you three up to?

181
00:09:57,457 --> 00:09:58,457
Science.

182
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,832
With ants.

183
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:03,999
Ant science.

184
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:06,582
I don't believe you.

185
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:09,790
Let's just show him.

186
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,290
What are they building?

187
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,540
Are you doing this?

188
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,999
Actually, no, they built their own tech.

189
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:21,582
Pretty smart ants.

190
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:23,499
Okay, so when you were all...

191
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,665
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

192
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:29,207
And I started reading Grandpa Hank's
old journals...

193
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:31,332
and I got really into the Quantum Realm
and...

194
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,165
The Quantum Realm?

195
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:36,665
I know we all have a history there,
and I didn't want to freak anyone out...

196
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:37,748
but we've been talking about it.

197
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:39,332
She had some questions, okay?

198
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:42,623
I can't help if people are inspired by me.

199
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:47,790
So, you've been studying the Quantum Realm?

200
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,707
Why didn't you ask me about it?

201
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:52,957
I tried, Mom.

202
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:54,332
A lot.

203
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:56,123
You never wanted to talk about it.

204
00:10:56,332 --> 00:10:57,540
Cassie's just been curious...

205
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:59,332
and we gave her some pointers.

206
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,207
This isn't exactly ant science, is it, Henry?

207
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:06,373
You know how dangerous the Quantum Realm is.

208
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:07,373
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

209
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:09,082
Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.

210
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,082
That's why we made this.

211
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:14,582
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

212
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:18,707
But Quantum.

213
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:22,373
We just need a map.

214
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:25,915
And then we can study and explore
the entire Quantum Realm.

215
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,832
Never even have to go.

216
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:33,873
Your daughter built a subatomic
Hubble Telescope in a basement.

217
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:39,373
You know, if I had something like this
when you were gone...

218
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:43,707
then I could have found you.

219
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,207
It's amazing.

220
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:50,415
I'm blown away.

221
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:54,165
How does it work?

222
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:57,290
It's kinda like that two-way radio
we used to have.

223
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:59,373
You send a signal down from here...

224
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:01,457
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

225
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:02,582
Wait. Wait a minute.

226
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,582
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

227
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:09,332
Yeah.

228
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:11,665
-Shut it down now.
-Janet...

229
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,165
-Why would we shut it...
-What's wrong?

230
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,790
You have to turn it off!

231
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:16,457
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

232
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,123
Janet?

233
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:26,832
There's something I should have told...

234
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:01,998
Dad?

235
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:05,957
No!

236
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:07,623
-No!
-Mom!

237
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:09,498
No!

238
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,915
Damn it!

239
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,998
Dad?

240
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:48,373
Dad!

241
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,040
Dad!

242
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:21,248
Cassie.

243
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,748
Dad!

244
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,665
Oh, Dad. Come on.

245
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:31,873
Okay.

246
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:32,873
Are you okay?

247
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,206
Yeah. I'm okay.

248
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,623
Where are we?

249
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:10,748
Mom!

250
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:13,415
Dad!

251
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,290
Hope. Over here.

252
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:18,956
Are you okay?

253
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:21,415
We should be dead.

254
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:23,415
Why aren't we?

255
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,706
I don't know.

256
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:28,331
Are we where I think we are?

257
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:30,665
I would say yes...

258
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:33,123
but it wasn't like this.

259
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:34,498
Janet!

260
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:35,956
Mom!

261
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:38,081
Janet!

262
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:40,706
Mom!

263
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,956
Do not move.

264
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,998
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

265
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:17,206
Right now.

266
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:23,165
Hope? Hope?

267
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,248
Hank? Can you hear me?

268
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:28,873
-Can anyone hear me?
-Oh, my God.

269
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:31,415
-It's okay.
-What are we gonna do?

270
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,415
It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

271
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,581
We're okay. It's gonna be okay.

272
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:35,831
You're saying "okay" too much.

273
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:38,206
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

274
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,248
We're okay.

275
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,456
We are fine.

276
00:16:40,623 --> 00:16:42,915
Hey, we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna go home.

277
00:16:43,998 --> 00:16:45,165
In the meantime, look around.

278
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:46,623
It's beautiful.

279
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:47,998
All right? We're outside.

280
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,873
It's like we're camping. We love camping.

281
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,206
We've never been camping.

282
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:55,040
But we've always talked about it.

283
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,623
Is that sun moving?

284
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:13,540
Get back!

285
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:19,206
Oh, my God.

286
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,748
I don't think this is a sun!

287
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:23,623
It's fine.

288
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:25,789
-Dad!
-Honey, it's okay.

289
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:26,956
Still okay.

290
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:36,873
Dad. Oh, my God.

291
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,081
That was weird.

292
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:44,414
Run.

293
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:16,331
There's Quantum people in the Quantum Realm?

294
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:17,498
Yeah.

295
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:19,748
I didn't know that either.

296
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:25,331
What was that back there, Mom?

297
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:27,081
What was that ship looking for?

298
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,914
Keep your voice down.

299
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:31,123
You said there was nothing down here.

300
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:32,248
Why didn't you tell us about all of this?

301
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:34,289
Hope, I will explain everything,
but right now...

302
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:36,123
-I just need you to trust me.
-Then make me trust you!

303
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:38,956
Let's just calm down, all right?
We can talk about this...

304
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,123
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

305
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,331
No, you need to tell us what's...

306
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,081
Why didn't you listen?
I told you to stay away from here.

307
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:48,039
Janet, I'm so sorry.

308
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:51,456
I should have told you what we were doing.
I had no idea...

309
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:52,581
I know. It's...

310
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:54,956
We'll talk later.

311
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:56,914
Right now, we stick together...

312
00:18:57,706 --> 00:18:59,206
we find Scott and Cassie...

313
00:18:59,998 --> 00:19:01,498
and we go home. Okay?

314
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:02,998
-Okay?
-Okay?

315
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:04,123
-Okay.
-Okay.

316
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:05,289
Stay close.

317
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:14,081
This is incredible.

318
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:17,081
I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.

319
00:19:19,331 --> 00:19:20,664
Why didn't I see any of this?

320
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,164
You weren't able to look deep enough.

321
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:25,873
Not through the Void and Subatomica.

322
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,956
There are worlds here...

323
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,789
worlds within worlds.

324
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:35,498
It's a place outside time and space.

325
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:39,456
It's a secret universe...

326
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:41,456
beneath ours.

327
00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:04,498
Hey, get your hands off me!

328
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:12,498
Cassie?

329
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:16,248
Where's my daughter?

330
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,414
Where is she?

331
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:21,498
Cassie?

332
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:26,456
Where's my daughter?

333
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:31,123
Cassie!

334
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:34,748
Dad!

335
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:36,623
Cassie!

336
00:20:37,164 --> 00:20:38,748
Drink the ooze.

337
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:41,123
What?

338
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:04,497
I'll handle this.

339
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:19,706
Mom.

340
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:15,789
Was that a good stab?

341
00:22:16,372 --> 00:22:17,706
I got us a ride.

342
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:38,039
He's friendly.

343
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:40,039
Quite a ride.

344
00:22:40,206 --> 00:22:43,122
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

345
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:44,206
I like ants.

346
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:46,664
And I love that you love them. Here.

347
00:22:47,456 --> 00:22:49,747
These will help us blend in.

348
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:53,372
Where exactly are we going on this?

349
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,331
We're not too far from an old friend of mine.

350
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:57,372
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are...

351
00:22:58,331 --> 00:22:59,456
it'll be him.

352
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:01,331
After you.

353
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,456
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

354
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:11,914
Let me go! Let me go!

355
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:24,581
I don't know what you're saying!

356
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:26,581
I don't know what you...

357
00:23:45,414 --> 00:23:46,497
No! No!

358
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:57,706
Drink the ooze!

359
00:23:57,872 --> 00:23:59,206
Drink the ooze!

360
00:23:59,581 --> 00:24:01,247
Drink the ooze!

361
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:02,747
Drink the ooze!

362
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:05,372
Hello.

363
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:06,456
Hi. Hi.

364
00:24:06,622 --> 00:24:08,122
Did you drink the ooze?

365
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:11,081
Why can I understand you?

366
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:12,372
Great. That's the ooze.

367
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:14,372
Hey, everybody, it worked! Ooze worked!

368
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:19,497
We can finally be friends.

369
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,830
Hi. I am Veb.

370
00:24:20,955 --> 00:24:21,955
You just drank me.

371
00:24:22,122 --> 00:24:23,330
I did... What?

372
00:24:23,455 --> 00:24:24,622
Do you need some more ooze? Here.

373
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:26,705
-I can pour some ooze into your hole...
-No, I'm okay.

374
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:28,372
-I'm okay. I'm okay.
-Oh, wow!

375
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:29,997
A big hole.

376
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:31,789
How many holes do you have?

377
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:33,789
I'm sorry. Is that a personal question?

378
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:35,539
I don't have any holes.

379
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:37,747
His name is Scott Lang.

380
00:24:38,872 --> 00:24:40,247
He has seven holes.

381
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:46,205
Yeah, that's right.

382
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,122
How did you know that?

383
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:50,289
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

384
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,664
You can read minds?

385
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:56,955
Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.

386
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:00,122
Everyone is disgusting.

387
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:03,914
-Could you please stop thinking that?
-Sorry.

388
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,372
-Please, stop.
-Thinking?

389
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:08,830
-Thinking that.
-I'm trying.

390
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:12,205
Well, not very hard.
And I think you look weird too.

391
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:13,872
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

392
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,289
I wish my head glowed.

393
00:25:16,372 --> 00:25:17,372
No, no, you don't.

394
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:19,955
I know I don't. I'm nervous, okay?
And it just came out.

395
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:20,997
What are you doing here?

396
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:23,080
-Are you a spy?
-What? No. No, no.

397
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,247
We should torture him.

398
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:25,330
Guys. No, it's okay.

399
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:28,205
We're not spies. He's my dad.

400
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:31,705
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

401
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,872
Then who is San Francisco?

402
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,539
-It's where we're from.
-It's a place.

403
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:38,705
Then what's Earth?

404
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:39,705
It's also where we're from.

405
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:40,872
We should torture them.

406
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,164
Why are you always trying to torture people?
We have other options.

407
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,122
Do things come out of your holes,
like milk, juice...

408
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,705
Veb, stop asking about his holes.

409
00:25:48,872 --> 00:25:49,914
Some of us have holes.

410
00:25:50,122 --> 00:25:51,539
What are you doing here?

411
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:53,414
Where are you from?

412
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:55,372
-Okay.
-Up there. Up there.

413
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:58,455
-See, above this, it's a different universe.
-The Earth. Big Earth.

414
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:00,705
-It's the same universe, but it's bigger.
-This is Earth, but it's a very small Earth.

415
00:26:00,872 --> 00:26:02,705
-Sometimes, I guess.
-I get big. I shrink.

416
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:04,747
-And it's like...
-But I wrote a book about it, actually.

417
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:05,789
-I don't know.
-This is the Quantum Realm.

418
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:07,164
You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.

419
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,122
-We shrunk. Right now, we're really small.
-It's bigger where we're from.

420
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,080
-So, we're small right now.
-It's bigger.

421
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,872
Okay, they're telling the truth.

422
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:17,914
It doesn't matter.

423
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,580
You come from above.

424
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,830
Like him.

425
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,955
So, he is hunting you.

426
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,289
He will burn the world to find you.

427
00:26:33,164 --> 00:26:34,164
Who?

428
00:26:35,664 --> 00:26:36,747
The Conqueror.

429
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,205
There are beings down here.
Intelligent beings.

430
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:46,330
I always theorized it was possible,
but to be here...

431
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:49,580
a subatomic universe.

432
00:27:49,788 --> 00:27:52,247
This changes everything we know about life...

433
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:54,788
evolution, our place in the galaxy...

434
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:56,663
Holy shit!

435
00:27:57,247 --> 00:27:58,705
That guy looks like broccoli.

436
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:09,413
Keep your head down.

437
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:02,580
Follow me.

438
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:16,997
Drink those.

439
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:19,080
I'll be right back.

440
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,663
I'm here for Krylar.

441
00:29:39,663 --> 00:29:40,663
It's you.

442
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:42,163
Let's keep that between us.

443
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:44,830
And Krylar.

444
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:45,955
Hello.

445
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:48,955
I don't know your ways or customs...

446
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:52,622
but I assume that you have a beverage
that can get me drunk?

447
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,872
Absolutely, sir.

448
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,288
So, what's your story then?

449
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:01,663
God.

450
00:30:03,288 --> 00:30:04,288
Move.

451
00:30:04,663 --> 00:30:05,663
It's time.

452
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,205
Follow me.

453
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:15,163
Right this way.

454
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:23,205
How exactly do you know this guy?

455
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:26,538
Old freedom fighter friend of mine.

456
00:30:26,663 --> 00:30:28,705
Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?

457
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,872
Or terrorist.

458
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,080
Depends on who you ask.

459
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,663
But, trust me, he can help.

460
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:20,038
Janet Van Dyne?

461
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,538
I thought you were dead.

462
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:26,038
Been a long time, Krylar.

463
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:29,455
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

464
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,996
I fought like hell against that.

465
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,121
It sounds so elitist.

466
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:38,080
You have got to be Hank.

467
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,996
I've heard so much about you and your ants.

468
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:44,288
What are ants anyway?

469
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:45,788
Do we have 'em down here?

470
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:47,663
I don't think so. No.

471
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:49,788
That's too bad.

472
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:52,038
Hope.

473
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:54,455
You have to be Hope.

474
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,205
She talked about you every day.

475
00:31:57,371 --> 00:31:58,746
That's strange...

476
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:01,121
she never said anything about you.

477
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,663
I don't think I would have told
my kid either.

478
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:08,205
-Wild stuff.
-Funny.

479
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:09,830
How wild?

480
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:13,455
Very wild, Henry. Yeah.

481
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:18,121
Krylar, we need your help.

482
00:32:18,455 --> 00:32:22,205
Janet, after all we've been through,
together...

483
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:23,455
just ask me.

484
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:25,163
Tell me, how can I help?

485
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:26,580
But...

486
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:29,830
is anyone starving? I'm starving.

487
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,205
Boys...

488
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:32,871
Now.

489
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:42,246
They don't know anything.

490
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:45,538
About... anything.

491
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:46,705
Then get them out of here.

492
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:49,705
Excuse me.

493
00:32:49,871 --> 00:32:52,038
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

494
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:53,496
We're just trying to find our family.

495
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:54,788
Do you have a map?

496
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:56,246
All we wanna do is go...

497
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:00,288
Wait, wait. Don't shoot.

498
00:33:00,455 --> 00:33:01,580
They're with us.

499
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:04,830
Is that building alive?

500
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:06,621
Yours are dead?

501
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,163
Look. Excuse me.

502
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:12,830
We just wanna go home.

503
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,121
At least you still have a home.

504
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:28,371
What happened here?

505
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:31,663
The Conqueror burned our homes.

506
00:33:32,371 --> 00:33:34,080
Our stories.

507
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,288
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

508
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:40,996
Some of us escaped...

509
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:42,913
found others on the run.

510
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:45,496
We gathered who we could to fight.

511
00:33:46,288 --> 00:33:47,746
It was never enough.

512
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:50,288
I'm sorry.

513
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:52,163
We can help.

514
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,205
-Cassie...
-Dad, you're an Avenger.

515
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,288
They need help.

516
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:03,330
No. What I need to do is get you home.

517
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,996
Why don't you wanna help?

518
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:06,330
We don't know anything about this place.

519
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:08,288
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

520
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,538
Have we been gone for 10 seconds?

521
00:34:09,705 --> 00:34:10,705
Or have we been gone for 10 years?

522
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:11,996
Think about your mom right now.

523
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:14,371
-Can you imagine what she must be...
-Don't use Mom as an excuse.

524
00:34:14,538 --> 00:34:16,621
-You just don't care.
-No, I do care.

525
00:34:16,746 --> 00:34:18,455
I know you wanna help. I do.

526
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,413
But this is not our fight.

527
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:23,413
Just 'cause it's not happening to you
doesn't mean it's not happening.

528
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:25,955
Hey.

529
00:34:28,913 --> 00:34:30,288
Would you look at me?

530
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:34,163
She's disappointed in you.

531
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,705
I got that. Yeah. Thank you.

532
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:36,705
You're welcome.

533
00:34:36,871 --> 00:34:37,955
We'll talk about it later.

534
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:39,788
Right now, let's just find the others.

535
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:42,246
No one knows this place
better than Janet.

536
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:45,538
What did you say?

537
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,121
What?

538
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:48,454
That name.

539
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,163
Janet Van Dyne.

540
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:52,288
Where is she?

541
00:34:52,413 --> 00:34:54,246
That's what we're trying to find out.
You know her?

542
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:55,913
I know her.

543
00:34:57,288 --> 00:34:58,454
She shouldn't be here.

544
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:02,288
Hey, bring a round of the chasers, please.

545
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:03,913
Yes, thank you.

546
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:07,204
If you haven't had this, don't try it...

547
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:09,788
unless you want to change your life.

548
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:24,579
Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.

549
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:26,829
Two of them.

550
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:28,371
Human, like us.

551
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:30,079
Human, that's the word.

552
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,413
Totally forgot what you call yourselves
up there.

553
00:35:33,538 --> 00:35:34,538
Human.

554
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:37,204
Are you not human?

555
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:39,371
Not technically, but yes.

556
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:41,371
In the ways that matter.

557
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:46,996
No!

558
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:51,829
Let us talk.

559
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:59,079
So, what is it that brings you to us, Janet?

560
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:02,954
If I remember correctly, you left.

561
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:06,413
You left all of us.

562
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,329
With him.

563
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:11,746
Janet, what is he talking about?

564
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,579
You didn't tell them about him.

565
00:36:19,538 --> 00:36:21,079
Did you say anything...

566
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:23,246
about what you did here?

567
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:27,746
How many people died because of you?

568
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:35,163
Does your family even know who you are?

569
00:36:38,788 --> 00:36:39,996
Your mommy...

570
00:36:41,496 --> 00:36:43,371
is full of secrets.

571
00:36:43,496 --> 00:36:44,579
You're lying.

572
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:45,871
I lie.

573
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,163
A lot.

574
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:52,579
Not about this.

575
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:55,663
Let them go.

576
00:36:57,454 --> 00:36:59,454
He just wants me.

577
00:36:59,621 --> 00:37:01,038
But you want them.

578
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:03,954
So they're coming too.

579
00:37:05,288 --> 00:37:08,329
Along with those other friends of yours.

580
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:11,538
I heard about them.

581
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:13,913
But he did too.

582
00:37:15,704 --> 00:37:17,329
And he sent the Hunter.

583
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:19,454
What kind of hunter?

584
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:22,913
Not a man. Not a machine.

585
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:26,913
A mechanized organism designed only...

586
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,788
for killing.

587
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:32,204
Where are they?

588
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:33,704
No clue.

589
00:37:34,913 --> 00:37:35,913
Dead.

590
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:39,496
Probably dead.

591
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:55,996
This is so sad when all of this...

592
00:37:55,996 --> 00:37:57,746
could have been avoided, Janet.

593
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:00,746
Just give him what he wants.

594
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:05,496
What happened to you?

595
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:11,288
We fought against him.

596
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:15,287
He can be very persuasive.

597
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:18,787
Let's pay him a visit.

598
00:38:22,871 --> 00:38:24,329
I think we're done here.

599
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,329
Can that ship get us out of here?

600
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:46,829
Cover me?

601
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:48,121
Always.

602
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:21,079
Henry, take the helm.

603
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,204
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

604
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:29,037
Where are the controls?

605
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:30,787
Those are the controls.

606
00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:35,579
What the hell?

607
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:37,621
You'll be great. It's like flying a bike.

608
00:39:39,996 --> 00:39:41,996
Is the bike alive?

609
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:57,246
Hands, all the way in!

610
00:39:58,246 --> 00:39:59,329
Like stuffing a turkey.

611
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:09,454
-Really, him?
-He used to be charming.

612
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:10,371
That guy?

613
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:12,329
I was down here for 30 years, Henry.

614
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,246
-I had needs.
-Oh, my God.

615
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,204
Look, I get it. I've got needs too.

616
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:17,329
Oh, my God!

617
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:19,579
I had dinner with someone a few times.

618
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:21,621
Her name was Linda.

619
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:23,579
It didn't work out.

620
00:40:23,746 --> 00:40:25,079
What went wrong?

621
00:40:25,454 --> 00:40:27,121
She wasn't you, baby.

622
00:40:30,454 --> 00:40:33,371
-Get everyone in the ships. We're leaving.
-All right.

623
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:35,287
-And, Xolum.
-Right here.

624
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:37,704
Take them as far away from here as you can.

625
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:38,912
-Why?
-What?

626
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:42,246
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

627
00:40:50,704 --> 00:40:52,496
You led them straight to us.

628
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:54,371
Come on, come on.

629
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,454
Take as many as you can.

630
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,787
We'll hold them off.

631
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:21,996
Go!

632
00:41:23,662 --> 00:41:25,079
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

633
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:27,204
We gotta go! We gotta go!

634
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:28,371
Get on. Get on now!

635
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:29,871
We have to go now. Now!

636
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:48,829
Oh, my God!

637
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:07,870
Cassie, let's go!

638
00:42:15,162 --> 00:42:16,412
Get to the sanctuary.

639
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,287
Wait for my message.

640
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:20,704
-Veb, we're leaving.
-No. No, wait!

641
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,912
-Move! Move!
-All my friends.

642
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:46,287
Give up the travelers.

643
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:47,704
The Conqueror will show you mercy.

644
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:49,329
I know his mercy.

645
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:03,995
Stay here. I'm...

646
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:06,287
Cassie?

647
00:43:07,995 --> 00:43:08,995
Oh, no.

648
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,579
Okay. I have a suit.

649
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,537
Yeah, I noticed.

650
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:37,579
-You okay?
-Yes.

651
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:40,579
Look, momentum, right?

652
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:42,662
Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.

653
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:43,912
I know how to do it, Dad.

654
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,079
-Do you? Really?
-Yes.

655
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:46,495
'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.

656
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,870
I messed up on the timing.

657
00:43:48,037 --> 00:43:48,870
Jump...

658
00:43:54,537 --> 00:43:55,412
Like that.

659
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:56,995
You see what I did? You see what I did?

660
00:43:57,537 --> 00:43:59,204
No. You're like this small.

661
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:00,537
I jumped and tapped.

662
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:12,745
Jentorra, we have to go.

663
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:35,120
Get to the ship!

664
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:25,745
Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott.

665
00:45:26,578 --> 00:45:29,078
I've been waiting a long time for this.

666
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:30,912
What?

667
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:33,620
Is someone in there?

668
00:45:33,787 --> 00:45:35,745
Oh, yes.

669
00:45:35,912 --> 00:45:38,495
The destiny you cannot escape.

670
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,787
Our fates have always been forged together...

671
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,953
ever since that day we met.

672
00:45:48,453 --> 00:45:49,787
Scott Lang.

673
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:51,037
Get away from us!

674
00:45:51,203 --> 00:45:52,787
The day you broke me.

675
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,828
-Banished me down here.
-Wait.

676
00:46:00,162 --> 00:46:01,162
Darren?

677
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,120
Surprised to see me?

678
00:46:06,078 --> 00:46:07,120
Yeah.

679
00:46:07,245 --> 00:46:08,370
It's the bee guy?

680
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,578
-It's the bee guy?
-Cassie?

681
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:12,412
I almost didn't recognize you.

682
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,995
How are you not dead?

683
00:46:15,203 --> 00:46:17,120
I became the ultimate weapon.

684
00:46:18,328 --> 00:46:20,412
That's what this is?

685
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:22,578
Look, Darren.

686
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:27,995
Darren is dead!

687
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,662
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

688
00:46:32,828 --> 00:46:34,828
And there's no place you can run, Scott.

689
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:36,162
Not from me.

690
00:46:36,703 --> 00:46:38,370
And not from him.

691
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:41,537
He's the future.

692
00:46:42,328 --> 00:46:43,453
He's the past.

693
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:47,495
And now all he needs is you.

694
00:46:53,787 --> 00:46:54,912
Mom?

695
00:46:55,328 --> 00:46:57,120
What's after Scott and Cassie?

696
00:46:58,953 --> 00:47:00,370
We have to find them.

697
00:47:01,453 --> 00:47:03,287
There's something I have to do first.

698
00:47:03,412 --> 00:47:04,787
They could be dead!

699
00:47:04,953 --> 00:47:06,453
Hope, please.

700
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,287
And you're still hiding things from us.

701
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:10,703
I am trying to protect you.

702
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,328
From what?

703
00:47:14,912 --> 00:47:16,787
Who are you so afraid of?

704
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,662
Third time in jail?

705
00:47:32,787 --> 00:47:33,828
Four.

706
00:47:42,662 --> 00:47:44,703
And here we are again.

707
00:47:45,745 --> 00:47:47,328
Face to face.

708
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:51,370
That's a face.

709
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,912
It's a big face.

710
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,662
Why are you just a floating head?

711
00:47:55,828 --> 00:47:57,912
Maybe you could walk us through this, Darren.

712
00:47:58,078 --> 00:48:00,995
You left Darren to die in the Quantum Realm.

713
00:48:02,495 --> 00:48:04,662
But the Conqueror found me.

714
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:06,370
Rebuilt me.

715
00:48:06,537 --> 00:48:08,537
Made me the ultimate weapon.

716
00:48:09,245 --> 00:48:12,037
A mechanized organism designed
only for...

717
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:13,245
M.O.D.O.K.?

718
00:48:15,328 --> 00:48:17,578
I get it. It's an acronym.

719
00:48:17,745 --> 00:48:18,912
It's an acronym.

720
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,078
Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

721
00:48:23,537 --> 00:48:25,203
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

722
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:28,787
-I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.
-Just now noticing the baby legs.

723
00:48:29,537 --> 00:48:30,537
They're not baby legs.

724
00:48:30,703 --> 00:48:32,078
A little bit like a Björn.

725
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:33,537
You think you're so smart.

726
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:36,870
Scott Lang,
the man who took everything from me.

727
00:48:37,036 --> 00:48:38,411
Who stole my whole life.

728
00:48:38,703 --> 00:48:39,703
But I did it.

729
00:48:41,245 --> 00:48:42,828
I got you here.

730
00:48:43,036 --> 00:48:44,995
I found your signal, Cassie.

731
00:48:45,245 --> 00:48:47,745
Thanks for that, by the way.
Couldn't have done it without you.

732
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:52,995
You're looking at a man set free.

733
00:48:53,995 --> 00:48:57,703
I've created so much more here
than you could possibly imagine.

734
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,453
All for him.

735
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:07,411
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

736
00:49:10,703 --> 00:49:12,495
What is this place?

737
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:15,620
He said he was a traveler.

738
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,828
A scientist who crashed off course.

739
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:27,995
He had a ship...

740
00:49:28,828 --> 00:49:31,495
beyond anything I had ever seen.

741
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,286
A ship that could travel the Multiverse.

742
00:49:35,453 --> 00:49:36,620
The Multiverse?

743
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,120
As in alternate dimensions?

744
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:42,120
Parallel realities?

745
00:49:42,328 --> 00:49:43,953
I didn't believe it at first.

746
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,120
But it's real.

747
00:49:48,995 --> 00:49:50,411
Just like we theorized.

748
00:49:52,745 --> 00:49:54,411
Can this take us home?

749
00:49:56,495 --> 00:49:57,786
It can take you anywhere.

750
00:50:16,995 --> 00:50:18,870
I'd never met anyone like him.

751
00:50:21,286 --> 00:50:23,370
He felt so...

752
00:50:23,745 --> 00:50:24,828
lost.

753
00:50:26,536 --> 00:50:27,745
I guess we both were.

754
00:50:28,661 --> 00:50:30,161
But we had a way out.

755
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:34,536
We tried everything...

756
00:50:34,703 --> 00:50:37,453
to recharge his ship's energy core.

757
00:50:43,078 --> 00:50:44,620
Nothing worked.

758
00:50:46,245 --> 00:50:50,828
But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.

759
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:53,578
I lied to Hope.

760
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,786
I told her I was coming home.

761
00:51:03,911 --> 00:51:05,786
I can see her by the door.

762
00:51:08,286 --> 00:51:09,661
Waiting for me.

763
00:51:13,745 --> 00:51:15,328
That's the last thing I did...

764
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:19,078
was lie to her.

765
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:24,953
I just thought I'd have more time.

766
00:51:29,828 --> 00:51:31,245
I can give that to you.

767
00:51:33,286 --> 00:51:34,286
Time.

768
00:51:38,203 --> 00:51:39,495
It's not what you think it is.

769
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:45,203
It's a cage.

770
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,411
And it does everything it can...

771
00:51:48,995 --> 00:51:50,078
to break you.

772
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:56,578
It's not until you free yourself from it
that you see...

773
00:51:57,745 --> 00:51:59,245
just how small...

774
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:01,453
it always was.

775
00:52:07,244 --> 00:52:09,036
We're going to get out of here.

776
00:52:12,328 --> 00:52:13,828
She's gonna open the door...

777
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:16,869
and you'll be there.

778
00:52:21,453 --> 00:52:22,619
I promise.

779
00:52:27,286 --> 00:52:29,078
-Let's get to work.
-Okay.

780
00:52:32,244 --> 00:52:35,119
It took ages, but we did it.

781
00:52:36,744 --> 00:52:39,078
We brought it back to life.

782
00:52:41,244 --> 00:52:42,744
Let's go home.

783
00:52:47,328 --> 00:52:49,161
His ship was neurokinetic.

784
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:51,744
Connected to his thoughts.

785
00:52:55,661 --> 00:52:56,744
When I touched it...

786
00:52:58,828 --> 00:53:00,619
I saw his mind.

787
00:53:01,744 --> 00:53:02,744
I felt...

788
00:53:04,536 --> 00:53:05,911
what he had done.

789
00:53:09,661 --> 00:53:11,494
Entire worlds...

790
00:53:12,203 --> 00:53:14,411
entire timelines.

791
00:53:14,536 --> 00:53:18,619
Gone, like they never even existed.

792
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:37,869
Janet?

793
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,828
We can leave.

794
00:53:46,078 --> 00:53:47,036
Right now.

795
00:53:52,036 --> 00:53:53,703
Who is Kang?

796
00:53:59,078 --> 00:54:00,453
Who I need to be.

797
00:54:04,786 --> 00:54:06,203
He didn't crash here.

798
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,411
He was exiled here.

799
00:54:09,453 --> 00:54:12,619
Outside space and time.

800
00:54:13,786 --> 00:54:15,453
The only place...

801
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:17,953
that could hold him.

802
00:54:19,078 --> 00:54:20,494
Exiled?

803
00:54:21,161 --> 00:54:22,619
By who?

804
00:54:22,994 --> 00:54:23,994
I don't know.

805
00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:28,286
But they sabotaged his ship.

806
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:31,369
And trapped him here.

807
00:54:33,744 --> 00:54:35,203
And because of me...

808
00:54:36,578 --> 00:54:37,911
he was getting out.

809
00:54:38,078 --> 00:54:38,911
Janet?

810
00:54:41,994 --> 00:54:43,328
Stay away.

811
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,578
You saved my life.

812
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:57,328
I made a promise.

813
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:05,828
Just let me take you home.

814
00:55:07,661 --> 00:55:08,703
And then?

815
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:12,619
What are you going to do?

816
00:55:23,911 --> 00:55:25,286
Win.

817
00:55:43,411 --> 00:55:46,994
I told you time isn't what you think.

818
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,744
I can make it...

819
00:55:51,577 --> 00:55:53,661
so you never left her.

820
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:58,202
Hope is going to open the door...

821
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:00,952
and you'll be there.

822
00:56:01,952 --> 00:56:04,327
And how many worlds will die...

823
00:56:05,786 --> 00:56:07,411
if you get out?

824
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:09,994
Not yours.

825
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,411
She'll never know.

826
00:56:18,077 --> 00:56:20,661
Don't you want to see your daughter again?

827
00:56:22,952 --> 00:56:24,536
I can't let you leave.

828
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:28,994
Why do you think you can stop me?

829
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:48,369
Give it to me, Janet.

830
00:56:49,827 --> 00:56:50,952
Give it to me!

831
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:54,369
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

832
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:56,286
What did you do?

833
00:57:00,702 --> 00:57:02,286
I'm sorry, Hope.

834
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:05,744
No!

835
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:34,619
I blew up his core.

836
00:57:34,786 --> 00:57:36,952
Cut him off from time.

837
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:40,327
And trapped us both down here forever.

838
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:44,286
But I gave him back enough.

839
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:46,077
Now that he had his suit back...

840
00:57:46,244 --> 00:57:49,577
he became what he always was.

841
00:57:50,494 --> 00:57:52,244
A conqueror.

842
00:57:52,411 --> 00:57:54,911
He's got weapons and technology...

843
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,744
centuries beyond anything we can dream of.

844
00:57:59,619 --> 00:58:03,411
He took his prison and made it his empire.

845
00:58:04,452 --> 00:58:07,744
I spent years fighting him...

846
00:58:07,911 --> 00:58:10,452
running from him, hiding from him.

847
00:58:12,244 --> 00:58:13,577
And then you saved me.

848
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:17,911
You brought me home.

849
00:58:19,827 --> 00:58:20,869
But I didn't deserve it.

850
00:58:22,702 --> 00:58:26,286
I unleashed a monster on this place...

851
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:28,286
and ran away.

852
00:58:28,702 --> 00:58:32,077
Janet, you couldn't have known.

853
00:58:34,286 --> 00:58:36,244
I'm sorry I never told you.

854
00:58:37,327 --> 00:58:39,244
I just wanted to forget.

855
00:58:40,661 --> 00:58:43,036
I just wanted to be your mom again.

856
00:58:48,494 --> 00:58:51,452
I'm so sorry you had to go through
all of that alone.

857
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:54,994
But you are not alone now.

858
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,077
We'll stop him together.

859
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,535
He's after the core.

860
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:06,077
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

861
00:59:06,285 --> 00:59:09,619
And if he's got Scott and Cassie,
he's got Pym Particles.

862
00:59:09,744 --> 00:59:11,619
-And a head start.
-Exactly.

863
00:59:11,744 --> 00:59:13,452
-We gotta get out of here.
-Hope.

864
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:15,577
He cannot get out.

865
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,452
You're an interesting man...

866
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:43,535
Scott Lang.

867
00:59:45,202 --> 00:59:46,369
I don't know who you are...

868
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,327
but you've made a big mistake.

869
00:59:49,994 --> 00:59:51,035
Okay?

870
00:59:51,994 --> 00:59:53,452
I'm an Avenger.

871
00:59:54,327 --> 00:59:55,660
I've called the other Avengers...

872
00:59:56,202 --> 00:59:57,410
You're an Avenger?

873
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,577
Have I killed you before?

874
01:00:02,535 --> 01:00:03,535
What?

875
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:06,327
They all blur together after a while.

876
01:00:08,744 --> 01:00:10,160
You're not the one with the hammer?

877
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:11,702
No, that's Thor.

878
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:14,660
We get confused a lot.

879
01:00:14,827 --> 01:00:17,035
Similar body types.
Who are you?

880
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:20,535
Just a man...

881
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:23,285
who's lost a lot of time.

882
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,535
Like you.

883
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:28,910
But we can help each other with that.

884
01:00:30,744 --> 01:00:32,910
M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief.

885
01:00:33,077 --> 01:00:35,369
Yeah, he stole something from me.

886
01:00:37,035 --> 01:00:39,369
Do not speak when I am in the room.

887
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:49,744
Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.

888
01:00:50,494 --> 01:00:51,785
You know Janet too?

889
01:00:53,077 --> 01:00:55,369
Does everyone down here know Janet?

890
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:58,244
She didn't tell you about me?

891
01:01:02,827 --> 01:01:04,452
I guess that's not a surprise.

892
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,244
Janet stole something from me.

893
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:12,702
My ticket out of here.

894
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:18,410
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

895
01:01:18,744 --> 01:01:20,327
And why would I do that?

896
01:01:20,452 --> 01:01:22,910
Because you want to get out of here.

897
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:27,702
And I need to get out of here.

898
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:31,869
Because I know how it ends.

899
01:01:32,327 --> 01:01:33,702
How what ends?

900
01:01:37,077 --> 01:01:38,494
All of it.

901
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:44,994
I don't live in a straight line.

902
01:01:47,785 --> 01:01:49,327
And with time...

903
01:01:50,285 --> 01:01:51,410
it's hard...

904
01:01:51,869 --> 01:01:53,535
not to skip to the end.

905
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,494
So, if you want to stop what's coming...

906
01:01:58,369 --> 01:02:00,535
and trust me...

907
01:02:00,702 --> 01:02:01,952
you do...

908
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:06,452
I am the only shot you have.

909
01:02:07,077 --> 01:02:08,285
What's coming?

910
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:11,410
Me.

911
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:15,910
A lot of me.

912
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:23,952
They exiled me, down here.

913
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:28,827
They're afraid of me.

914
01:02:34,827 --> 01:02:37,993
But I'm the man who can get you home.

915
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:49,868
So, do we have a deal?

916
01:02:53,327 --> 01:02:55,202
No, I don't think we do.

917
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:05,535
Dad!

918
01:03:05,743 --> 01:03:08,035
Let me make this easy for you.

919
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:09,910
You will bring me what I need...

920
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:12,410
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you...

921
01:03:12,535 --> 01:03:14,577
then make you relive that moment...

922
01:03:14,743 --> 01:03:18,035
over and over again in time, endlessly...

923
01:03:18,243 --> 01:03:20,702
until you beg me to kill you.

924
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:23,410
Do we understand?

925
01:03:27,077 --> 01:03:28,077
Don't do this.

926
01:03:31,785 --> 01:03:34,160
I'm a man who likes to be understood.

927
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:38,452
Dad.

928
01:03:39,535 --> 01:03:40,577
Don't listen to him.

929
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:44,160
No! No!

930
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:45,452
Look, we can talk about this.

931
01:03:45,827 --> 01:03:46,952
Don't do it!

932
01:03:47,118 --> 01:03:48,618
You really should do it.

933
01:03:48,785 --> 01:03:49,785
Please.

934
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:53,660
That's my daughter, please.

935
01:03:53,827 --> 01:03:56,243
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

936
01:03:56,452 --> 01:03:57,452
Please!

937
01:03:57,577 --> 01:03:58,868
You think I'm lying?

938
01:03:59,993 --> 01:04:01,660
Do I look like a liar to you?

939
01:04:03,493 --> 01:04:04,493
Stop!

940
01:04:04,577 --> 01:04:06,118
-Dad!
-I'll do it. I'll do it.

941
01:04:06,285 --> 01:04:07,785
I'll do it. Just let her go.

942
01:04:07,952 --> 01:04:09,577
Let her go. Let her go!

943
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,410
You're out of your league.

944
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:24,452
Ant-Man.

945
01:04:30,702 --> 01:04:32,493
Just be glad I need you.

946
01:04:45,785 --> 01:04:49,202
Don't touch her again.

947
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,243
Then give me what I need.

948
01:04:52,993 --> 01:04:54,285
Where is it?

949
01:05:35,785 --> 01:05:37,202
What is that?

950
01:05:37,368 --> 01:05:39,743
It was a multiversal engine core.

951
01:05:41,368 --> 01:05:44,910
A power source that can take you anywhere
in space and time.

952
01:05:46,618 --> 01:05:48,285
Then Janet blew it up.

953
01:05:52,577 --> 01:05:53,868
It's in that?

954
01:05:54,035 --> 01:05:55,910
It is that.

955
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,118
And we have to get to the center.

956
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:00,410
That's good to know.

957
01:06:02,243 --> 01:06:05,410
You'll have to shrink down and
pass through the eye of the storm.

958
01:06:05,576 --> 01:06:08,285
Once you're inside, find the core...

959
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,118
and size it back down.

960
01:06:10,326 --> 01:06:11,701
What does it look like?

961
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:14,118
When I steal something,
I usually know what I'm stealing.

962
01:06:14,326 --> 01:06:15,868
You'll know it when you see it.

963
01:06:16,035 --> 01:06:18,410
Get in and out as fast as you can.

964
01:06:18,535 --> 01:06:21,826
The longer you're in there,
the more your mind will come undone.

965
01:06:24,743 --> 01:06:25,743
Better hurry.

966
01:06:26,993 --> 01:06:27,951
Dad!

967
01:06:30,451 --> 01:06:31,743
I'm sorry.

968
01:06:32,285 --> 01:06:33,743
This is all my fault.

969
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:37,076
Hey, hey, hey.

970
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,493
No.

971
01:06:40,035 --> 01:06:41,326
I messed up.

972
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:42,743
Cassie.

973
01:06:43,743 --> 01:06:45,910
My whole life happened because I messed up.

974
01:06:47,451 --> 01:06:50,035
The only thing I didn't mess up is you.

975
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,410
Dad!

976
01:06:55,118 --> 01:06:56,076
It's okay.

977
01:06:56,285 --> 01:06:57,368
It's okay.

978
01:07:00,118 --> 01:07:01,535
I love you, Peanut.

979
01:07:02,743 --> 01:07:04,618
I love you too.

980
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,451
Okay. I'm in.

981
01:07:53,451 --> 01:07:55,493
Darren, can you hear me?

982
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:56,576
Darren?

983
01:07:57,743 --> 01:07:58,743
Darren?

984
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,993
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

985
01:08:03,201 --> 01:08:04,285
What?

986
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,243
-I'm in.
-Okay.

987
01:08:06,743 --> 01:08:09,451
Okay, so what do I do? What's the plan?

988
01:08:10,993 --> 01:08:12,201
Don't die?

989
01:08:13,368 --> 01:08:15,743
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

990
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:17,160
Do you see it?

991
01:08:18,535 --> 01:08:19,701
Yeah. I see it.

992
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,368
I'm heading in.

993
01:08:29,743 --> 01:08:30,701
What the hell?

994
01:08:30,868 --> 01:08:31,743
What the hell?

995
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:32,743
What the hell?

996
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:35,576
I told you, Scott.
Getting in was just the beginning.

997
01:08:35,785 --> 01:08:36,910
You never said that.

998
01:08:37,076 --> 01:08:38,326
Why am I looking at another me?

999
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:40,035
I'm not another me. You're another me.

1000
01:08:40,243 --> 01:08:41,118
You just came out...

1001
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:42,868
Why am I looking at another me?

1002
01:08:43,076 --> 01:08:46,285
You're looking at the possibility
of another you.

1003
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,201
You're in a Probability Storm.

1004
01:08:48,368 --> 01:08:50,451
What does any of that mean?

1005
01:08:50,618 --> 01:08:52,285
-You don't know?
-Why would I know?

1006
01:08:52,451 --> 01:08:53,410
Because you got me in here.

1007
01:08:53,535 --> 01:08:54,743
So, I am the real one, huh?

1008
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:55,826
No. I didn't say that.

1009
01:08:57,368 --> 01:08:58,618
-What the hell?
-What the hell?

1010
01:08:58,785 --> 01:08:59,701
-What the hell?
-What the hell?

1011
01:08:59,868 --> 01:09:00,910
-Wait. Wait, wait.
-What the hell?

1012
01:09:01,076 --> 01:09:02,118
What the hell?

1013
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:04,243
What is this place?

1014
01:09:04,368 --> 01:09:06,410
It's a Probability Storm.

1015
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:09,451
Every choice you could make,
existing all at once.

1016
01:09:09,576 --> 01:09:10,993
What is he saying? What's he saying?

1017
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:13,660
-What's he saying?
-You're inside Schrödinger's box.

1018
01:09:13,785 --> 01:09:14,785
And you're the cat.

1019
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:16,451
-That doesn't make sense.
-Oh, I get it.

1020
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:18,326
Nobody move! All right? Nobody move!

1021
01:09:18,493 --> 01:09:20,618
Why should we listen to you?
You're not even the real one.

1022
01:09:20,785 --> 01:09:21,826
-What the hell?
-Am I real?

1023
01:09:21,993 --> 01:09:22,868
-Am I real?
-Am I real?

1024
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:24,326
-I am the real one!
-What the hell?

1025
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,410
What the hell. I'm the real one.

1026
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:28,076
Guys. Hey, relax.

1027
01:09:28,284 --> 01:09:29,909
Take it easy. Breathe.

1028
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:32,159
We'll figure this out. Together.

1029
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:33,368
Who are you?

1030
01:09:33,493 --> 01:09:34,826
Why are you dressed like that?

1031
01:09:35,784 --> 01:09:37,368
Because I work at Baskin-Robbins.

1032
01:09:37,493 --> 01:09:39,284
This is my uniform.

1033
01:09:39,451 --> 01:09:40,701
These are normal clothes.

1034
01:09:40,826 --> 01:09:42,118
Why are you dressed like that?

1035
01:09:42,243 --> 01:09:43,784
-Do you have ice cream?
-Enough!

1036
01:09:43,951 --> 01:09:44,993
Let's do this!

1037
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:54,659
Oh, we're all gonna die.

1038
01:09:57,076 --> 01:09:58,076
Wait.

1039
01:09:58,659 --> 01:09:59,868
Wait. Wait!

1040
01:10:00,034 --> 01:10:01,118
No! No!

1041
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:03,784
No! Wait! No!

1042
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:05,284
I've got a read on Scott.

1043
01:10:20,868 --> 01:10:21,826
Out of the way!

1044
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:24,118
-Mom! What is this?
-What are you doing?

1045
01:10:24,326 --> 01:10:25,993
Don't look at them.
They're just possibilities.

1046
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:28,618
They're not you.

1047
01:10:28,909 --> 01:10:30,868
Scott, where are you?

1048
01:10:35,118 --> 01:10:36,159
Why am I here?

1049
01:10:37,159 --> 01:10:39,034
Don't worry. It'll work this time.

1050
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,993
What are you... Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.

1051
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:43,618
-Stop! No!
-I got this, guys.

1052
01:10:48,993 --> 01:10:50,993
I got this!
I got it!

1053
01:10:55,493 --> 01:10:56,659
Scott, where are you?

1054
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:58,201
Scott!

1055
01:11:01,701 --> 01:11:03,284
Where are you, Scott?

1056
01:11:04,576 --> 01:11:06,451
-I can't breathe.
-Ow, that's my neck.

1057
01:11:08,034 --> 01:11:09,159
Stop kicking me!

1058
01:11:11,784 --> 01:11:13,451
-My back!
-We're all gonna die!

1059
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:15,576
Dad.

1060
01:11:18,493 --> 01:11:19,701
Come back.

1061
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:21,618
Dad...

1062
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:23,826
if you can hear me...

1063
01:11:24,409 --> 01:11:26,909
come back.
Just come back.

1064
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,493
-Don't give up.
-Come on.

1065
01:11:30,368 --> 01:11:32,284
-Dad, just come back one more time.
-Come on.

1066
01:11:32,451 --> 01:11:34,034
-She needs us.
-Please.

1067
01:11:34,201 --> 01:11:35,743
-Yes, come on.
-Come back.

1068
01:11:35,826 --> 01:11:37,784
She needs us.
Let's do it together.

1069
01:11:37,868 --> 01:11:39,993
-Get him up! Get him up!
-Grab him! Grab him!

1070
01:11:40,076 --> 01:11:41,368
Let's go.

1071
01:11:42,201 --> 01:11:44,201
-Come on, lift him!
-Yes!

1072
01:11:44,451 --> 01:11:46,618
-I got ya, I got ya! Go.
-Come on. That's it.

1073
01:11:46,784 --> 01:11:48,618
-Come on!
-Give him a boost! Give him a boost!

1074
01:11:50,826 --> 01:11:53,326
Come on, we're doing it for Cassie!
Fellas, let's go!

1075
01:11:53,493 --> 01:11:55,201
Everyone together!

1076
01:11:55,368 --> 01:11:56,409
What are you doing?

1077
01:11:57,159 --> 01:11:58,701
How are you able to do that?

1078
01:11:58,868 --> 01:11:59,868
I'll tell you how.

1079
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:03,118
We all want the same thing.

1080
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:06,784
And I'm coming, Cassie.

1081
01:12:15,409 --> 01:12:16,784
Go get her, pal.

1082
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,659
Everyone, let's go!

1083
01:12:26,034 --> 01:12:27,326
Come on!

1084
01:12:35,243 --> 01:12:36,243
Come on, closer.

1085
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:37,284
Get him higher!

1086
01:12:37,493 --> 01:12:39,118
Hang on, guys, hang on.

1087
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:42,034
Careful. Steady, steady.

1088
01:12:45,076 --> 01:12:46,826
Steady. That's it.

1089
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:48,034
Let's go.

1090
01:12:54,451 --> 01:12:55,451
What?

1091
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:00,617
-Oh no.
-What happened? Did it work?

1092
01:13:00,742 --> 01:13:02,451
Sorry, buddy!

1093
01:13:02,659 --> 01:13:04,326
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

1094
01:13:14,201 --> 01:13:16,201
Hope, are you real?

1095
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:17,992
I'm real.

1096
01:13:18,576 --> 01:13:19,576
Then let's do this.

1097
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:25,909
You ready?

1098
01:13:26,076 --> 01:13:27,076
Ready.

1099
01:14:12,909 --> 01:14:13,992
Come on.

1100
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:15,242
We gotta get that thing out of here.

1101
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,242
No, no, no. Wait.

1102
01:14:16,409 --> 01:14:17,492
He's got Cassie.

1103
01:14:18,034 --> 01:14:19,284
-What?
-Scott.

1104
01:14:19,784 --> 01:14:21,867
-Janet.
-Give that to me.

1105
01:14:22,076 --> 01:14:22,909
-We have to go now.
-No.

1106
01:14:23,117 --> 01:14:24,284
He's got Cassie.

1107
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:27,159
We will save her. I promise you
we will save her...

1108
01:14:28,659 --> 01:14:30,492
but you cannot give that to him.

1109
01:14:30,951 --> 01:14:32,201
I wouldn't trust her.

1110
01:14:36,117 --> 01:14:37,826
Janet has a way of...

1111
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,367
changing her mind.

1112
01:14:49,242 --> 01:14:51,742
Hello, Jellybean.

1113
01:14:57,909 --> 01:14:58,992
So...

1114
01:15:02,742 --> 01:15:04,409
what's it gonna be, Scott?

1115
01:15:07,951 --> 01:15:10,242
Well, well.

1116
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:14,242
If it isn't my old mentor.

1117
01:15:18,784 --> 01:15:19,576
Hi, Hank.

1118
01:15:23,242 --> 01:15:24,242
Darren?

1119
01:15:24,826 --> 01:15:27,326
Didn't expect to see
your protégé again after all...

1120
01:15:27,492 --> 01:15:29,242
Holy shit, Darren.

1121
01:15:30,201 --> 01:15:31,492
What happened to you?

1122
01:15:31,659 --> 01:15:34,117
I'm the ultimate weapon!

1123
01:15:44,701 --> 01:15:46,326
Do I need to take it?

1124
01:15:46,784 --> 01:15:47,992
Where is my daughter?

1125
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:51,117
Scott.

1126
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:53,409
Don't.

1127
01:15:54,326 --> 01:15:56,534
We had a deal.

1128
01:15:57,159 --> 01:15:58,534
She'll be fine without you.

1129
01:16:24,034 --> 01:16:25,700
So long, Hank.

1130
01:16:33,242 --> 01:16:34,284
Henry.

1131
01:16:41,409 --> 01:16:43,659
You left me right here to die.

1132
01:16:47,825 --> 01:16:49,367
Let's see how they do.

1133
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,575
What did you see?

1134
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:03,700
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

1135
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,825
But I always wondered.

1136
01:18:10,575 --> 01:18:12,534
When you touched my mind...

1137
01:18:23,992 --> 01:18:25,742
what did you see?

1138
01:18:26,575 --> 01:18:27,825
A monster...

1139
01:18:29,284 --> 01:18:30,742
who thinks he's a god.

1140
01:18:31,117 --> 01:18:33,534
When you can see time the way I do...

1141
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:35,617
you don't get to close your eyes.

1142
01:18:35,825 --> 01:18:38,492
And you're the only one who sees?

1143
01:18:38,659 --> 01:18:43,450
I am the only one that can see it's broken.

1144
01:18:43,659 --> 01:18:44,825
And who broke it?

1145
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:48,534
I did.

1146
01:18:49,742 --> 01:18:52,742
Every version of me.

1147
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:55,409
My variants.

1148
01:18:56,117 --> 01:18:57,492
Throughout the Multiverse.

1149
01:18:59,784 --> 01:19:02,992
Playing with time, like children.

1150
01:19:05,409 --> 01:19:08,450
But I saw how it ends.

1151
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:11,700
I saw their chaos...

1152
01:19:12,534 --> 01:19:15,492
spreading across realities.

1153
01:19:16,617 --> 01:19:18,867
Universes colliding.

1154
01:19:20,325 --> 01:19:21,534
Endless incursions.

1155
01:19:22,909 --> 01:19:24,867
I saw the Multiverse.

1156
01:19:26,034 --> 01:19:27,450
And it was dying.

1157
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:30,492
All because of them.

1158
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:33,784
So, I took control.

1159
01:19:34,534 --> 01:19:36,450
You mean you started a war.

1160
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,534
And now you wanna wipe away
any universe that's a threat to you.

1161
01:19:41,617 --> 01:19:43,200
That's what monsters do.

1162
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:46,200
That's what conquerors do.

1163
01:19:46,617 --> 01:19:49,492
They burn the broken world.

1164
01:19:50,492 --> 01:19:53,283
And they make a new one.

1165
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:56,367
You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.

1166
01:19:58,492 --> 01:20:00,742
You only want revenge because they beat you.

1167
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:02,658
Because you lost.

1168
01:20:02,992 --> 01:20:04,867
I have lost.

1169
01:20:06,575 --> 01:20:10,658
You have no idea what I have lost.

1170
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:16,075
And I will burn them out of time...

1171
01:20:16,242 --> 01:20:17,658
for what they've done to me.

1172
01:20:18,617 --> 01:20:22,617
You'll be wiping out entire timelines.

1173
01:20:23,325 --> 01:20:26,492
Murdering trillions of people.

1174
01:20:27,533 --> 01:20:30,033
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1175
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,450
Oh, God. What am I doing?

1176
01:21:04,283 --> 01:21:05,408
What?

1177
01:21:09,617 --> 01:21:10,533
Hank!

1178
01:21:14,325 --> 01:21:15,533
Are these your ants?

1179
01:21:16,283 --> 01:21:17,325
From the ant farm?

1180
01:21:17,492 --> 01:21:19,367
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1181
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,158
How did you find them down here?

1182
01:21:22,742 --> 01:21:25,283
I've been picking up strange signals
ever since we crashed.

1183
01:21:27,492 --> 01:21:30,117
First I thought maybe it was a malfunction.

1184
01:21:30,283 --> 01:21:31,867
Some kind of interference.

1185
01:21:32,033 --> 01:21:33,908
What is that?

1186
01:21:34,117 --> 01:21:35,242
But it wasn't.

1187
01:21:36,533 --> 01:21:37,742
It was the ants.

1188
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:42,617
They were reaching out the whole time.

1189
01:21:44,117 --> 01:21:47,575
Apparently, they passed through
some sort of time dilation.

1190
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:50,950
They've lived thousands of years
in a single day...

1191
01:21:51,533 --> 01:21:54,492
expanding their knowledge,
their science...

1192
01:21:54,825 --> 01:21:57,658
becoming more advanced
than I could have ever thought.

1193
01:21:58,033 --> 01:21:59,408
I didn't find them.

1194
01:22:00,325 --> 01:22:01,533
They found me.

1195
01:22:03,617 --> 01:22:05,325
I told you they were smart.

1196
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:12,742
They've already built something
of a technocratic Class-Two civilization.

1197
01:22:12,992 --> 01:22:15,908
I mean, I know socialism is a charged word...

1198
01:22:16,033 --> 01:22:18,950
-but we could learn a lot from these...
-Dad.

1199
01:22:20,033 --> 01:22:21,325
Yeah, they're my ants.

1200
01:22:22,117 --> 01:22:24,117
And ants don't give up.

1201
01:22:24,325 --> 01:22:25,492
I don't care who this guy is.

1202
01:22:25,658 --> 01:22:26,867
I don't care what he can do.

1203
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,117
I'm getting Cassie.

1204
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:30,658
So, how do we even the odds against Kang?

1205
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:35,283
We've got some ideas.

1206
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:36,408
What are you thinking?

1207
01:22:36,575 --> 01:22:39,575
Well, as a great writer once said...

1208
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:42,783
"There's always room to grow."

1209
01:22:45,158 --> 01:22:46,242
You read my book?

1210
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:50,367
Every goddamn word.

1211
01:22:52,908 --> 01:22:54,367
Come on. Let's go to work.

1212
01:23:07,283 --> 01:23:09,117
Hey! I'm sorry.

1213
01:23:09,283 --> 01:23:11,117
That was probably terrifying.

1214
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:12,533
What are you doing here?

1215
01:23:13,325 --> 01:23:14,408
I'm rescuing you.

1216
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:15,783
How?

1217
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:18,992
That's a good question.

1218
01:23:19,617 --> 01:23:22,366
Does this thing have like a key?

1219
01:23:22,491 --> 01:23:24,491
Or a card? Like a room key?

1220
01:23:24,658 --> 01:23:25,825
Do you know, like a...

1221
01:23:27,825 --> 01:23:28,825
Shit!

1222
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:37,491
Jump and tap.

1223
01:23:46,575 --> 01:23:47,616
Jentorra.

1224
01:23:48,991 --> 01:23:50,825
I'm sorry I got your people hurt.

1225
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:53,533
How can I help?

1226
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,741
Wow.

1227
01:23:59,908 --> 01:24:01,075
Let's hurt 'em back.

1228
01:24:02,325 --> 01:24:03,450
Damn, you're cool.

1229
01:24:04,408 --> 01:24:05,408
Do you have a plan?

1230
01:24:05,491 --> 01:24:06,741
Freeing you was basically my plan.

1231
01:24:07,866 --> 01:24:08,950
Do you have a plan?

1232
01:24:09,158 --> 01:24:11,200
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

1233
01:24:11,825 --> 01:24:13,533
Then free our people
from the detention cells below...

1234
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:14,908
and launch a counteroffensive from within.

1235
01:24:15,075 --> 01:24:17,283
Yeah, you have a plan.
So, how do we get a message out?

1236
01:24:17,491 --> 01:24:18,408
Follow me.

1237
01:24:18,575 --> 01:24:20,033
Okay. Great.

1238
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:27,366
I built an empire down here, Janet.

1239
01:24:29,783 --> 01:24:31,408
And I'm taking it with me.

1240
01:24:47,491 --> 01:24:50,241
You really should've let me out
when you had the chance.

1241
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:02,325
History is not written.

1242
01:25:04,325 --> 01:25:05,575
It is forged.

1243
01:25:06,366 --> 01:25:08,283
Today, we ascend.

1244
01:25:09,116 --> 01:25:14,116
From this fortress, I will take my revenge
on those who banished me.

1245
01:25:15,575 --> 01:25:18,950
Today we conquer eternity.

1246
01:25:19,741 --> 01:25:21,908
And the dynasty of Kang shall...

1247
01:25:25,825 --> 01:25:27,533
Hello? Is this working?

1248
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:29,158
Cassie?

1249
01:25:29,283 --> 01:25:31,200
I can't tell if this is working.

1250
01:25:32,533 --> 01:25:34,033
Okay. I think we're on.

1251
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,616
I'll hold them off. Get the message out.

1252
01:25:35,783 --> 01:25:37,450
I thought you were getting the message out.

1253
01:25:39,116 --> 01:25:39,950
Now!

1254
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:43,575
We're inside.
We breached the tower.

1255
01:25:43,783 --> 01:25:44,783
And I'm with Jentorra.

1256
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:46,325
He's not invincible.

1257
01:25:52,575 --> 01:25:54,575
I know it might feel like...

1258
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,116
it's too late...

1259
01:25:57,741 --> 01:25:59,825
like all we do is just lose.

1260
01:26:00,325 --> 01:26:01,950
But the family I've lost...

1261
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:04,200
taught me to keep fighting.

1262
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,241
And if they were here, they would too.

1263
01:26:07,116 --> 01:26:09,116
We need to look out for the little guy.

1264
01:26:09,575 --> 01:26:11,033
My dad taught me that.

1265
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:13,283
'Cause when people needed help...

1266
01:26:13,783 --> 01:26:15,616
he didn't look the other way.

1267
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,366
And neither do we.

1268
01:26:19,658 --> 01:26:20,658
We need to move!

1269
01:26:20,783 --> 01:26:23,158
Come to the tower! Fight back!

1270
01:26:23,325 --> 01:26:25,700
I know you've been waiting.
Now is the time to strike.

1271
01:26:25,866 --> 01:26:27,991
He knows he can't take all of us.

1272
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,283
Come to the...

1273
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,491
Cassie.

1274
01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:32,616
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1275
01:26:32,825 --> 01:26:34,408
-Let's go.
-I'll drive.

1276
01:26:40,533 --> 01:26:41,866
Find Lang's daughter.

1277
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:46,325
Kill her.

1278
01:27:05,366 --> 01:27:06,408
Let's go. Let's go!

1279
01:27:06,949 --> 01:27:08,283
If you want to fight, follow me!

1280
01:27:13,074 --> 01:27:14,324
It's over, Cassie.

1281
01:27:14,741 --> 01:27:16,408
Free the others. Go!

1282
01:27:24,533 --> 01:27:25,616
He's gonna see us coming.

1283
01:27:25,783 --> 01:27:27,824
Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

1284
01:27:28,741 --> 01:27:29,908
Begin the launch.

1285
01:28:21,866 --> 01:28:23,616
Your dad's not here, Cassie...

1286
01:28:23,866 --> 01:28:25,824
but I guess that's not a big surprise.

1287
01:28:49,283 --> 01:28:50,449
Kang!

1288
01:28:51,616 --> 01:28:53,491
We had a deal.

1289
01:28:55,616 --> 01:28:57,908
You took my daughter!

1290
01:29:00,324 --> 01:29:01,699
Holy shit.

1291
01:29:02,324 --> 01:29:03,533
That's big.

1292
01:29:12,283 --> 01:29:13,949
You lied to me!

1293
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,366
Our word is our bond.

1294
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:21,324
Without that, we're nothing!

1295
01:29:22,074 --> 01:29:23,074
Bring him down.

1296
01:29:23,283 --> 01:29:24,116
Yes, sir.

1297
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,241
Keep going. I've got them.

1298
01:29:34,199 --> 01:29:35,491
Yeah, come on!

1299
01:29:50,033 --> 01:29:51,199
There's so many!

1300
01:29:51,408 --> 01:29:53,658
Scott! I can't hold them!

1301
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:05,783
They came.

1302
01:30:07,574 --> 01:30:09,574
Way to go, Cassie!

1303
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:13,074
Yes!

1304
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,824
Come on! Let's go!

1305
01:30:20,824 --> 01:30:22,699
Revolution!

1306
01:30:35,866 --> 01:30:37,907
Burn it all down.

1307
01:30:38,074 --> 01:30:39,241
Fight!

1308
01:30:56,532 --> 01:30:58,407
Cover! Get down!

1309
01:31:07,074 --> 01:31:08,574
What is the bridge code?

1310
01:31:09,116 --> 01:31:10,199
I'll die first.

1311
01:31:10,866 --> 01:31:12,116
One-eight-one-four-seven.

1312
01:31:12,491 --> 01:31:13,366
Damn!

1313
01:31:28,866 --> 01:31:30,032
You'll need this.

1314
01:31:32,449 --> 01:31:33,199
Hi.

1315
01:31:34,157 --> 01:31:35,157
This is our home!

1316
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,449
Let's take it back!

1317
01:31:42,032 --> 01:31:43,032
No!

1318
01:31:50,282 --> 01:31:52,199
I have holes.

1319
01:31:54,032 --> 01:31:56,657
I have holes!

1320
01:32:03,282 --> 01:32:04,657
I didn't know he could do that.

1321
01:32:14,407 --> 01:32:15,407
Kang!

1322
01:32:15,991 --> 01:32:17,241
Where is she?

1323
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:19,199
Launch now!

1324
01:32:30,407 --> 01:32:31,907
What is that?

1325
01:32:32,324 --> 01:32:33,741
He's getting out.

1326
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:35,366
Oh, no, he's not.

1327
01:32:43,032 --> 01:32:44,574
Keep him away from the rings.

1328
01:33:23,782 --> 01:33:24,866
Dad!

1329
01:33:27,741 --> 01:33:29,074
Dad, I'm coming!

1330
01:33:40,574 --> 01:33:41,574
Dad!

1331
01:33:49,907 --> 01:33:51,449
Nowhere left to run.

1332
01:34:00,365 --> 01:34:01,490
Please let this work.

1333
01:34:19,949 --> 01:34:21,490
Hey, where do you think you're going?

1334
01:34:21,657 --> 01:34:22,615
Let's go.

1335
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,740
You think this is over? Come on! Let's go.

1336
01:34:24,907 --> 01:34:26,449
Darren, just stop...

1337
01:34:26,907 --> 01:34:29,282
trying to be whatever this is.

1338
01:34:30,074 --> 01:34:31,532
I don't know what to be.

1339
01:34:33,615 --> 01:34:35,199
Tell me what to be.

1340
01:34:35,449 --> 01:34:37,615
I don't know.
Just don't be a dick.

1341
01:34:38,365 --> 01:34:39,740
It's too late.

1342
01:34:40,365 --> 01:34:41,532
Look at me.

1343
01:34:43,115 --> 01:34:44,657
I'm such a dick.

1344
01:34:45,032 --> 01:34:47,449
It's never too late to stop being a dick.

1345
01:34:53,282 --> 01:34:54,365
We've gotta stop him.

1346
01:34:56,282 --> 01:34:57,574
I have an idea.

1347
01:35:00,365 --> 01:35:01,199
Ready?

1348
01:35:01,365 --> 01:35:02,490
Probably not.

1349
01:35:05,324 --> 01:35:07,740
One, two, three. Now!

1350
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,074
Dad!

1351
01:35:32,449 --> 01:35:33,365
Dad!

1352
01:35:34,199 --> 01:35:35,199
Cassie?

1353
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:38,074
You're huge.

1354
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,865
I'm huge.

1355
01:35:44,324 --> 01:35:45,824
I love you, Peanut.

1356
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:47,407
I love you too.

1357
01:35:47,699 --> 01:35:49,365
I'm so proud of you.

1358
01:35:50,032 --> 01:35:52,074
I feel like I'm hugging Godzilla.

1359
01:35:52,324 --> 01:35:54,824
I know. It feels so cool.

1360
01:35:55,115 --> 01:35:56,824
I know, right?

1361
01:35:57,574 --> 01:35:58,699
I'm so hungry.

1362
01:35:58,865 --> 01:35:59,865
Yeah, that happens.

1363
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:02,199
-I could eat everything.
-Everything. I know.

1364
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:05,074
-But I really want like a lime.
-Right?

1365
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,282
-Citrus. It's weird. I know.
-Citrus.

1366
01:36:07,407 --> 01:36:08,407
It's...

1367
01:36:19,157 --> 01:36:20,574
Take the tower!

1368
01:36:52,157 --> 01:36:53,365
It's over.

1369
01:36:55,324 --> 01:36:57,324
You still can't see it.

1370
01:36:59,324 --> 01:37:02,282
It's never over.

1371
01:38:18,948 --> 01:38:20,698
-We have to go, right now.
-No.

1372
01:38:20,865 --> 01:38:21,865
-Come on.
-No!

1373
01:38:22,032 --> 01:38:23,198
I know, I know, but we have to go.

1374
01:38:23,365 --> 01:38:24,698
-No!
-Come on.

1375
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:16,115
You son of a...

1376
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,740
-Oh, God.
-Scott.

1377
01:39:21,032 --> 01:39:22,032
Come on.

1378
01:39:26,782 --> 01:39:29,407
You think this is new to me?

1379
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:35,448
Do you know how many rebellions
I have put down?

1380
01:39:37,115 --> 01:39:38,615
No, no, no.

1381
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:42,323
How many worlds I've conquered?

1382
01:39:43,157 --> 01:39:45,407
How many Avengers I've killed?

1383
01:39:45,573 --> 01:39:48,115
And you think you can beat me?

1384
01:39:48,282 --> 01:39:49,907
I am Kang!

1385
01:39:50,073 --> 01:39:50,990
You...

1386
01:39:52,032 --> 01:39:54,323
You talk to ants.

1387
01:41:14,115 --> 01:41:16,698
My name is Darren...

1388
01:41:16,823 --> 01:41:21,365
and I am not a dick!

1389
01:41:42,823 --> 01:41:44,073
Sorry I'm late.

1390
01:41:46,448 --> 01:41:47,698
Lotta ants.

1391
01:41:49,115 --> 01:41:50,115
Oh, is this you?

1392
01:41:51,781 --> 01:41:53,198
You were right about me, Cassie.

1393
01:41:54,531 --> 01:41:55,531
Darren.

1394
01:41:57,281 --> 01:41:58,281
Are you okay?

1395
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:02,281
Probably not.

1396
01:42:03,615 --> 01:42:05,323
-Darren?
-Hi, Hope.

1397
01:42:06,281 --> 01:42:07,740
You changed your hair.

1398
01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:12,365
What the hell happened?

1399
01:42:13,156 --> 01:42:13,948
Yeah. No...

1400
01:42:14,490 --> 01:42:15,948
It's a whole thing. I'll tell you later.

1401
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:17,740
That was...

1402
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:19,698
I don't know what to say.

1403
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:21,573
Thanks, Scott.

1404
01:42:22,156 --> 01:42:25,365
You always were a brother to me.

1405
01:42:27,531 --> 01:42:28,531
I was?

1406
01:42:36,448 --> 01:42:37,531
I was.

1407
01:42:51,615 --> 01:42:53,281
And at least I died...

1408
01:42:54,865 --> 01:42:56,406
an Avenger.

1409
01:42:59,615 --> 01:43:00,656
Yeah.

1410
01:43:01,698 --> 01:43:02,615
-You did.
-Yeah.

1411
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:04,490
You're in.

1412
01:43:21,156 --> 01:43:22,698
A lot has happened today.

1413
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:24,615
-Henry?
-Janet?

1414
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:26,656
-Mom, where are you?
-I'm in the tower.

1415
01:43:26,781 --> 01:43:28,781
I think I can give us one shot back.

1416
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:30,781
But we don't have much time.

1417
01:43:30,990 --> 01:43:32,615
If we wanna go home...

1418
01:43:35,073 --> 01:43:36,448
we have to go now.

1419
01:43:37,115 --> 01:43:38,115
We'll finish this.

1420
01:43:40,365 --> 01:43:41,406
Thank you.

1421
01:43:42,490 --> 01:43:43,365
Thank you.

1422
01:43:45,448 --> 01:43:47,073
Come on! Let's go!

1423
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,406
All right. Good luck.

1424
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:49,823
Good luck.
Come on.

1425
01:44:20,531 --> 01:44:21,531
Thanks, buddy.

1426
01:44:23,864 --> 01:44:24,864
You did it.

1427
01:44:28,614 --> 01:44:29,781
Let's go home.

1428
01:44:51,656 --> 01:44:52,614
Where's Scott?

1429
01:44:52,823 --> 01:44:54,323
He was right behind me.

1430
01:45:37,406 --> 01:45:39,031
You should've looked the other way.

1431
01:45:39,198 --> 01:45:41,864
Yeah, well, never been great at that.

1432
01:45:49,781 --> 01:45:51,323
And you're not getting out.

1433
01:46:01,906 --> 01:46:03,323
I want you to remember.

1434
01:46:04,823 --> 01:46:06,364
You could've gone home.

1435
01:46:21,489 --> 01:46:23,531
You could've seen your daughter again.

1436
01:46:37,364 --> 01:46:38,698
But you thought you could win.

1437
01:46:52,073 --> 01:46:53,573
I don't have to win.

1438
01:46:55,114 --> 01:46:57,031
We both just have to lose.

1439
01:47:47,989 --> 01:47:49,322
Dad!

1440
01:47:56,489 --> 01:47:57,489
Where... Where...

1441
01:47:57,739 --> 01:47:58,822
Where is she? Is she...

1442
01:47:58,989 --> 01:48:00,572
-No, she's okay.
-Where is she?

1443
01:48:00,739 --> 01:48:02,072
She's okay. She's okay.

1444
01:48:02,531 --> 01:48:03,947
-Scott, they're all okay. They're all okay.
-She's safe?

1445
01:48:04,156 --> 01:48:05,156
You did it.

1446
01:48:05,322 --> 01:48:06,322
You did it.

1447
01:48:09,739 --> 01:48:11,614
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
-No, no, no.

1448
01:48:11,822 --> 01:48:13,281
No, don't let go. Don't let go.

1449
01:48:13,864 --> 01:48:15,031
Don't let go.

1450
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:16,406
Don't ever let go.

1451
01:48:18,072 --> 01:48:19,406
I got you.

1452
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:23,406
You came back.

1453
01:48:33,739 --> 01:48:35,031
I love you, Hope.

1454
01:48:37,656 --> 01:48:39,031
I love you, Scott.

1455
01:49:52,697 --> 01:49:54,072
Let's go home.

1456
01:49:56,656 --> 01:49:57,906
Home's good.

1457
01:50:06,364 --> 01:50:07,989
My life doesn't make sense.

1458
01:50:08,197 --> 01:50:10,531
I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.

1459
01:50:10,697 --> 01:50:13,364
"Scott you just saved the Quantum Realm
with your family...

1460
01:50:13,572 --> 01:50:15,406
"and drank a guy without holes.

1461
01:50:15,614 --> 01:50:17,864
"Why does this kind of stuff keep
happening to you?

1462
01:50:18,031 --> 01:50:19,489
"That doesn't make any sense."

1463
01:50:19,656 --> 01:50:21,031
But you know what?

1464
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:23,239
Who said life has to make sense?

1465
01:50:27,531 --> 01:50:28,531
Rubin!

1466
01:50:28,656 --> 01:50:29,864
You are the bug!

1467
01:50:31,156 --> 01:50:33,656
I was wrong. Yeah.
You are the other bug.

1468
01:50:33,822 --> 01:50:35,114
You're the bug man.

1469
01:50:35,281 --> 01:50:37,864
You get big and get small
like a big bug!

1470
01:50:38,531 --> 01:50:41,156
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

1471
01:50:41,281 --> 01:50:42,281
Twelve dollar.

1472
01:50:44,197 --> 01:50:45,239
Twelve!

1473
01:50:45,364 --> 01:50:47,947
I used to wonder if this
chapter in my life was over...

1474
01:50:48,156 --> 01:50:51,322
but as Cassie reminded me,
"There's always someone you can help."

1475
01:50:52,031 --> 01:50:54,447
Came out of cake making
retirement for you.

1476
01:50:56,864 --> 01:50:57,864
Wow.

1477
01:50:58,614 --> 01:50:59,906
You made this yourself?

1478
01:51:00,031 --> 01:51:02,447
-Yeah! I don't usually make the cakes.
-I know.

1479
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,406
This is the first one I've made since 1997.

1480
01:51:04,614 --> 01:51:05,822
You're a real artist.

1481
01:51:05,989 --> 01:51:07,947
It's been a pretty wild ride.

1482
01:51:08,155 --> 01:51:10,489
One day you're fired from Baskin-Robbins...

1483
01:51:10,655 --> 01:51:13,447
the next you're beating a time-traveling
space king.

1484
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:16,530
We did beat him, right?

1485
01:51:17,947 --> 01:51:19,239
I mean, yeah, that's what happened.

1486
01:51:19,364 --> 01:51:21,530
He was getting out and he didn't get out.

1487
01:51:22,947 --> 01:51:24,030
I think.

1488
01:51:25,572 --> 01:51:28,197
But he also said something bad was coming...

1489
01:51:28,614 --> 01:51:31,655
and that everyone would die
if he didn't get out.

1490
01:51:31,864 --> 01:51:34,447
Wait. So, did I just kill everyone?

1491
01:51:35,239 --> 01:51:37,280
Is everyone gonna die because of me?

1492
01:51:37,405 --> 01:51:38,489
Oh, my God.

1493
01:51:39,614 --> 01:51:41,114
Oh my... What did I do?

1494
01:51:43,364 --> 01:51:44,697
What did I do?

1495
01:51:48,197 --> 01:51:50,280
You know what? It's probably fine.

1496
01:51:50,822 --> 01:51:52,905
Like I said, life doesn't make any sense...

1497
01:51:53,072 --> 01:51:56,197
so maybe stop asking so
many questions, Scott.

1498
01:51:56,364 --> 01:51:57,822
Stop overthinking it.

1499
01:52:00,364 --> 01:52:02,114
Surprise!

1500
01:52:02,322 --> 01:52:06,405
Happy Birthday to you

1501
01:52:07,614 --> 01:52:08,905
It's not my birthday.

1502
01:52:09,114 --> 01:52:11,655
I know. But I missed a few.

1503
01:52:14,030 --> 01:52:15,947
This is good. We're all together.

1504
01:52:16,322 --> 01:52:17,739
You're fine.

1505
01:52:17,905 --> 01:52:20,822
Everything's probably fine.

1506
01:52:20,989 --> 01:52:23,322
Kang's gone. You did it.

1507
01:52:24,405 --> 01:52:26,239
Don't have to worry about that guy anymore.

1508
01:52:26,405 --> 01:52:27,405
Thanks.

1509
01:52:30,822 --> 01:52:32,822
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1510
01:54:53,613 --> 01:55:01,197
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania

1511
01:55:10,197 --> 01:55:13,780
So, the exiled one is dead.

1512
01:55:16,030 --> 01:55:17,988
You sure he's dead?

1513
01:55:18,613 --> 01:55:21,447
If it wasn't true, I wouldn't call you.

1514
01:55:22,113 --> 01:55:25,238
Must really eat you up,
that you're not the one who killed him.

1515
01:55:25,530 --> 01:55:28,238
None of us...

1516
01:55:29,072 --> 01:55:30,738
killed him.

1517
01:55:33,072 --> 01:55:34,447
They did.

1518
01:55:35,322 --> 01:55:39,905
They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.

1519
01:55:40,572 --> 01:55:42,030
And if we let them...

1520
01:55:42,488 --> 01:55:44,280
they will take...

1521
01:55:45,738 --> 01:55:47,322
everything...

1522
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:50,280
we've built.

1523
01:55:51,322 --> 01:55:53,863
So let's stop wasting time.

1524
01:55:57,488 --> 01:55:58,655
We're late.

1525
01:56:00,697 --> 01:56:03,030
How many did you call?

1526
01:56:03,363 --> 01:56:05,780
All of us.

1527
02:03:28,863 --> 02:03:33,821
Time is everything.

1528
02:03:39,071 --> 02:03:42,071
It shapes our lives.

1529
02:03:43,404 --> 02:03:47,321
But, perhaps, we can shape...

1530
02:03:49,113 --> 02:03:50,196
it.

1531
02:03:51,488 --> 02:03:52,613
It's him.

1532
02:03:53,029 --> 02:03:56,363
What? You made him sound
like this terrifying figure.

1533
02:03:57,738 --> 02:03:58,779
He is.
