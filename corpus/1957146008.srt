1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,580
(nighttime sounds)

2
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:12,919
(ominous music)

3
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,353
- Looks like nobody's
been up here for a while.

4
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,301
- Come on.

5
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:24,290
- Do you think that's good idea?

6
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,930
- Where's your sense of adventure?

7
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,720
I always dreamed of getting
swept off my feet by

8
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,100
Indiana Jones, and I
wind up with Woody Allen.

9
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,933
Come on.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,820
- Looks like it might've been some kind of

11
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,047
military installation .

12
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,010
- Cool, you think there's any
old warheads lying around?

13
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,623
- Davey, over here,
there's a swimming pool.

14
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,973
- (stuttering) I think we
better be getting back now.

15
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,970
- Why, what are you so afraid of?

16
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,440
- Your uncle.

17
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,733
- There's nothing he can
do to you, you big pansy.

18
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,340
Once I turned 18, all
rights he held over me

19
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,910
as my guardian...

20
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,160
They went out the window.

21
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:36,400
- (stuttering) Okay.

22
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,240
You're right.

23
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,390
But seriously...

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,340
This looks like the kind
of place that people made

25
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,703
not to be found, you know.

26
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,178
I mean you don't know what's in that pool.

27
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:48,623
It might not even be water.

28
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,720
- (sarcastically) Oo,
you mean slimy monsters?

29
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,463
- Barbara, don't do that.

30
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:57,113
- Looks like water to me.

31
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,702
(screaming)

32
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:03,969
- Oh my god!

33
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:06,027
Barbara!

34
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,740
(Barbara laughs)

35
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,307
- You are so gullible.

36
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:12,890
(Dave screams)

37
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:16,146
- (panting) Jesus, it's freezing!

38
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:20,013
What, are you nuts?!
(Barbara laughing)

39
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:22,913
- Have you ever seen "The
Creature From The Black Lagoon"?

40
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,963
- No.

41
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:33,007
- Well, how about "Attack
of the Crab Monsters"?

42
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,463
- Uh-uh.

43
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:46,693
- Are you still cold?

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,150
- Only in the...

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,573
Least important places.

46
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,110
Thanks.

47
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,943
It'll help.

48
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:15,478
- What's that slimy monster?

49
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:18,084
- You wanna play with it, little girl?

50
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:19,251
- Come get me.

51
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:24,575
- Okay.

52
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:32,432
Ow!

53
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,170
Barbara, cut it out,

54
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,900
it's starting to really hurt now, okay.

55
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,295
- What I didn't touch you, I'm over here!

56
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:42,908
- The hell you didn't,
you yanked off my...

57
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,072
You know again.
(Dave screams)

58
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:47,701
Something bit me.
(Dave screams)

59
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,532
- Davey, swim ,get out of the pool!

60
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:52,115
(Dave screams)

61
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:56,851
- [Barbara] Get out of the pool!

62
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:05,489
(Barbara screams and pants)

63
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,783
(ominous music)

64
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:46,066
(sirens in the distance)

65
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,980
- No, she was always rebellious,

66
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,780
but I'm damned if I ever
thought she'd pull something

67
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,470
like this, I mean...

68
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,760
And it is my fault, I...

69
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,060
I know I should have listened to her more.

70
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,480
- JR, we'll...

71
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,630
Find Barbara, and we'll
bring her back in time for

72
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,733
the opening on Friday.

73
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,870
- I hope you won't take
this the wrong way, miss?

74
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,550
- McNamara.
- McNamara,

75
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,200
Don't you think somebody
a little more experienced

76
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,860
might be better suited for this, Earl?

77
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,373
- Maggie has the best
record in the agency, JR.

78
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,770
- I'll find your niece,
Mister Randolph, I promise.

79
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,830
- [Earl] We'll be in touch when
we hear something, JR, okay?

80
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,030
- I appreciate it, Earl.

81
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,710
- Miss McNamara.
- Nice to meet you.

82
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:41,285
(sighs)

83
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:46,340
- I don't have to tell you
when an important client

84
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,610
JR Randolph is, do I?

85
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,480
- Largest land developer in the region,

86
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,530
JR's latest venture is
the Lost River Resort,

87
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,050
which cost about 16 million,

88
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,900
and has it's grand opening on Friday.

89
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,820
- It's very good...

90
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,500
Hopefully the information
on the youngest generation

91
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,422
will be as easy to find.

92
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,170
- Oh, Earl, I'm two-thirds
bloodhound, remember?

93
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,397
Even if I don't look it.

94
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:11,230
(relaxing music)

95
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:21,184
- Look at you, look at you!

96
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:26,184
Oh, you are a beauty.

97
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,120
- Yeah, yeah, see, chicken,

98
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,850
bag of pasta,

99
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,490
and one bottle of Andy Jackson Bourbon.

100
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,073
- Ah, give it here.

101
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,973
My one guilty pleasure.

102
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,830
Have I missed anything?

103
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,280
- Back in the world?

104
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,370
Nothing.

105
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,570
The usual.

106
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,900
People lousen up the land,
fowling up the waters,

107
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,710
screwing up the air, but
then complaining 'cause

108
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,690
"They don't enjoy life anymore".

109
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,683
We're better off up here by ourselves.

110
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:16,630
(coughing)

111
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,210
So how is the great
one-word-a-day American novel

112
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,083
coming along?

113
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,120
- Well...

114
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,430
It's seven words greater
than it was the last time

115
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,820
you were here.

116
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,023
- Poppa H would be disappointed.

117
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,483
Brandy, I think it's time for us to go.

118
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,600
Maybe by the time we get
back, Paul will have a whole

119
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,903
new paragraph for us to critique.

120
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,890
- Hey, give that dog a bath,

121
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,953
smells like fish.
(dog barks)

122
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,290
(knock on door)
It's open!

123
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,413
- Paul Grogan?

124
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,263
My name's Maggie McNamara, I
work for Lyon Investigations.

125
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,290
- [Paul] Who's that?

126
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,263
- Detective agency.

127
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,350
- I thought PI's wore
trench coats, and have those

128
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,733
little stubbly beards.

129
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,100
- Well, it's the 90's,
we've become liberated.

130
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,700
- My ex-wife sent you?

131
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,120
- No, I'm looking for a...

132
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,170
A young man, and woman, who
disappeared about a week ago.

133
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,820
They were last seen in this area.

134
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,953
Your friend, Jack thought
you might be able to help me.

135
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,737
- No, never saw 'em.

136
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:36,093
Talk to the sheriff's people?

137
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:38,943
- (sighs) Yes, if they knew
anything, I wouldn't be here.

138
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,020
I thought maybe they
would follow the river.

139
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,173
- Well...

140
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,570
If they drown in the river,
they've been swept downstream

141
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,422
to the dam.

142
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:54,255
Ouch.

143
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,970
So you're starting at the wrong end.

144
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,250
- Am I interrupting something?

145
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,083
- Look...

146
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,950
I haven't seen them, or
anyone else for that matter,

147
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,410
see, that's why I live up
here in the wilds of nature.

148
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,310
Sorry, can't help.

149
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,410
- Well, are there any
other shacks around here?

150
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,290
- Cabin, this is a cabin.

151
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,020
- [Maggie] Right, well are
there any more of those?

152
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,993
Somewhere they might be shacked up?

153
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,483
- That's cute.

154
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,183
You got a whip?

155
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,330
Well, there's an old army
test site up on the mountain,

156
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,810
that's been closed down
for four, or five, years.

157
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,030
- You're taking me there.
- Oh no, I'm not.

158
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,360
- Yes...

159
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,193
Yes you are.

160
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:46,247
(birds chirping)

161
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,763
- Well...

162
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,433
Where to now?

163
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:06,581
(ominous tense music)

164
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,073
Not here.

165
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,430
Well, there's no signs of life,

166
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,080
can we go now?

167
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,997
- Not yet.

168
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,573
Paul.

169
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,510
(tense music)

170
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,870
What ere they testing here?

171
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,143
- God knows.

172
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,350
Went hiking up here once with my ex-wife,

173
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,097
there was guard dogs, electrified
fences, the whole show.

174
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:00,150
- B-R.

175
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,053
Barbara Randolph.

176
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,853
- Randolph?

177
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,540
As in Randolph Land Development,

178
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,193
the Randolph Building
downtown, Randolph Boulevard?

179
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,510
- I don't work cheap.
- Jesus.

180
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,653
Working for the enemy.

181
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,203
Well.
(screeching)

182
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:23,230
If they had drown in here,

183
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,663
wouldn't their bodies be
floating on top by now?

184
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,670
- No, not necessarily.

185
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,903
Takes a while for the body bloat with gas.

186
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,313
- Nice business you're in.

187
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,943
- Wonder if there's anyway
we could drain this pool.

188
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:51,053
(water pumps running)

189
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,218
(ominous music)

190
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,070
They've definitely been here,

191
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,850
unless they brought a change of clothes.

192
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,540
I think we ought to drain the pool.

193
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:39,400
Paul.

194
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,060
If this still works, it's
the quickest way to find out

195
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,188
whether they're down here.

196
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:50,188
- (sarcastically) I can't wait.

197
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:55,282
(alarm sounding)

198
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:04,987
- What are you doing?

199
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:10,251
(Maggie screams)

200
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:25,162
- Paul!

201
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:28,734
Paul!

202
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:37,786
(Maggie screams)

203
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:18,690
- Are you okay?

204
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,160
- Yeah, how about you?

205
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,090
- Oh, man!

206
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,160
I thought you PI's knew
all that kung fu stuff.

207
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,933
- I never passed the course.

208
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:32,600
She's still breathing.

209
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,170
- No thanks to you.

210
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,040
- What was I supposed to do?

211
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,293
You weren't much help.

212
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,260
Give me a sip of that.

213
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,563
- It ain't Avion, Tori.

214
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,280
- Oh god, you're right.

215
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,763
What's in the sack?

216
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,993
- Roadkill.

217
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,430
- Jesus.

218
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,493
- Every all American girl needs a hobby.

219
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,530
- [Paul] What is it?

220
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,523
- Salt water.

221
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,810
Where does this drain to?

222
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,450
- Well, it was a fish hatchery
before the army took it over,

223
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,120
probably drains
underground into the river.

224
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,628
- Paul.

225
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:31,295
(ominous music)

226
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:39,066
Looks like a dog, or something.

227
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,110
If those kids drowned in here,
then the remains would be

228
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,530
in the river by now .

229
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:48,028
- [Paul] Dammit.

230
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,403
- She must've hot-wired it.

231
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,150
She's alive.

232
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,120
- You spot anything broken?

233
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,810
- What do you want, Florence
Nightingale for Christ's sake?

234
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,908
I don't know, look, her head's
glean, she's unconscious.

235
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,100
- Well, let's pick her up, and
carry her back to the cabin,

236
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,540
if she cries out in pain,
then somethings' broken.

237
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,373
- Carry her?

238
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,337
- Don't worry, catch
your breath, I'll start.

239
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:40,754
- No, I'll do it, I'll do it.

240
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:45,320
- Oh, Brandy, I tell
ya, catching em's good,

241
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,773
eating em's good, but
cleaning em really sucks.

242
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:50,980
(dog barks)

243
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,443
Now, what's gotten into you?

244
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:57,537
It's the same old river
out there, same as always.

245
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,610
I swear sometimes I think
you're getting senile,

246
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,890
soft in the head.

247
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:09,852
(screeching)
(Jack screaming)

248
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,830
- Nice fish...

249
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,370
Where'd you catch it?

250
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,800
- Catch it, I bought it,
it cost me 500 bucks,

251
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,310
there's no way we're gonna get her to town

252
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,390
without your Jeep.

253
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,140
- Well, I can't believe
you don't have a telephone.

254
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,450
I mean what happens if you
needed help in an emergency?

255
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,120
- I don't need help, and
I don't have emergencies.

256
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,950
- Where's the nearest help then?

257
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,120
Cause she probably has a fractured skull.

258
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,953
- Well, we'll get her to the dam,

259
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:45,890
there's always a ranger there.

260
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,160
- Okay...

261
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
How do we get there?

262
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,290
- A raft.

263
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,223
- Ugh, cut the Grizzly Adams
crap, how do we get there?

264
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,681
- Alright, I read my daughter
Huckleberry Finn last summer,

265
00:19:57,681 --> 00:20:00,050
We wanted to light out for
the territories right the,

266
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,510
so I built this as a compromise.

267
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,410
- Well, it looks authentic.
- I cut the logs myself.

268
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,160
There's not a nail in it,

269
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,460
it's all lashed with rope.

270
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,200
- Where's your daughter now?

271
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,650
- Well, she visits during the summer,

272
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,074
but she's at camp for a few days.

273
00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:20,850
- So how sturdy is thing?

274
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,180
- I don't know, we never tried it.

275
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,612
My daughter's afraid of the water.

276
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:27,947
- Look, Susan, all you have
to do is swim out to marker,

277
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:29,360
and back.

278
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,311
I'm sure you swim twice
that, when you're swimming.

279
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:34,523
- This is stupid.

280
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:37,080
Why should I swim in
some scummy old river.

281
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,669
- Because if you don't do your solo swim,

282
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:41,755
then you can't get your Water Scout badge.

283
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:42,950
- Laura!

284
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,050
Letter for you, Laura.

285
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,982
Still haven't done your solo swim, Susie.

286
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:49,815
- No.

287
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,980
- The entire camp is going
across the river tomorrow

288
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,200
to be in a TV commercial
for the Lost River Resort.

289
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,790
Now...

290
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,053
Unless you suck it up,
and do your solo swim,

291
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,540
you won't get to be on TV
with the rest of the kids.

292
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,160
- Gina, do you have any mail for her?

293
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,993
- Nope.

294
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:09,160
- Then why don't you get out of here.

295
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,053
- Guts, Susie!

296
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:12,923
- What a bitch.

297
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,281
- [Maggie] I wish you'd come too.

298
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:20,181
- [Paul] You're lucky, she's not dead.

299
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,009
- Who do you think she is?

300
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,023
- Goddamn nutcase, that's who.

301
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,060
- How far till we get to dam?

302
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,610
- Well, we can't make it before dark,

303
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,560
we're gonna have to camp for the night.

304
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,167
- We have to spend a whole night with her?

305
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,737
- Don't worry, if she
snores, I'll nudge her.

306
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:54,448
(ominous music)

307
00:21:58,161 --> 00:21:59,578
- Come on Brandy!

308
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:03,530
Hey Brandy.

309
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:06,778
Jesus!

310
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:09,149
Hurry up.

311
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,110
- Oh my god.

312
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,943
Human blood.

313
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,036
- [Paul] Jack!

314
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:19,880
Jack!

315
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,709
Jesus Christ.

316
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:22,980
Jack!

317
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,695
Come on, follow the dog.

318
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:25,974
Jack!

319
00:22:25,974 --> 00:22:28,724
(ominous music)

320
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:32,250
- Oh my god.
- Oh my god.

321
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,730
I can't believe it, Brandy.

322
00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:52,532
- [Maggie] I'm sorry.

323
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:56,523
- I'll go get a shovel.

324
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:01,342
He wouldn't want to buried in town.

325
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,060
- He was quite thick..

326
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,523
Like an ancient tree stump.

327
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,883
His gnarled skin, the color of iron.

328
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,963
His eyes was so old,

329
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:28,620
that his eyelids sank to the ground like

330
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,233
two thick ropes.

331
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:35,403
"Raise my eyelids", he said.

332
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,530
And the demons...

333
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,443
They peeled his heavy eyelids back.

334
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:45,763
"There", he said.

335
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,517
And in a voice like a earthquake,

336
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:53,980
"There he is",

337
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,303
- Bah!
(children screaming)

338
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:56,136
- No!

339
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,160
- Easy, easy now.

340
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,927
- Razor teeth, the razor teeth.

341
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:02,053
- What's that, what's razor teeth?

342
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,963
- [Dr. Baines] Let me go!

343
00:24:04,963 --> 00:24:06,550
- What's going on out here, huh?

344
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,660
- She must have a concussion,
she's not making any sense.

345
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,340
- Well, allow me to have
a go at it, alright.

346
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,522
Hello there!

347
00:24:12,522 --> 00:24:13,740
Are you awake?!

348
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,683
What happened with Barbara and David?!

349
00:24:15,683 --> 00:24:17,003
Where are they?!
- No.

350
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,992
They breed, there's no way to stop them.

351
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,384
No way.

352
00:24:22,384 --> 00:24:23,840
- Someone's completely mental.

353
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,660
- Paul, that's not the way to handle this.

354
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,440
- We'll just let the
authorities beat it our of her

355
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,273
tomorrow.

356
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,373
- They'll kill me.

357
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:36,184
(stuttering) They'll kill me.

358
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,101
They'll kill all of us.

359
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,930
- Alright, miss short-term memory,

360
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,280
number one, what happened
to David and Barbara.

361
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,020
Okay.

362
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,570
Number two, what the
hell were you doing up

363
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,150
In an army test site?

364
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,410
- Stop that!

365
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,600
- Stop what?

366
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,500
- Your hand, take it out of the water.

367
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:08,140
- It speaks.

368
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,400
- What's wrong with the water?

369
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,030
- Excuse me.

370
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,880
What's your name?

371
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,303
- Dr. Leticia Baines.

372
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,300
- What's wrong with the water?

373
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,233
- It's full of carnivorous fish, piranha.

374
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:28,030
- For god's sakes
- Paul, shut up.

375
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,930
- What are piranha doing in the river?

376
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,653
- You let em in...

377
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:34,010
When you drained the
pool at the test site.

378
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,344
If you hadn't done it in such a hurry--

379
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:36,350
- Load of crock...

380
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,793
- [Maggie] Paul!

381
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:40,760
- Piranha are tropical fish,
this is cold mountain water,

382
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,420
they wouldn't last for a minute up here.

383
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,170
- Yeah, but what about Jack's feet?

384
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:47,083
And the skeleton at
the bottom of the pool?

385
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,577
- What were piranha doing in that pool?

386
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,163
- Untie me, please!

387
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,300
- Why don't we just dip
you in the water a bit,

388
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,681
and see if you're
telling the truth or not?

389
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:04,181
(dog barking)

390
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,123
Brandy!

391
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,491
- [Maggie] Brandy!

392
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:14,005
Sh, Brandy!

393
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:14,838
Brandy!

394
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:16,573
Brandy!

395
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:17,406
- Brandy!

396
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:19,374
Brandy!

397
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:21,091
- Don't put your hand in!

398
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:22,854
(screeching)
(Brandy yelping)

399
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:24,163
- Help me!

400
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:26,352
- Brandy!
(screeching)

401
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,185
Brandy!

402
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,352
- [Dr. Baines] Don't put your hand in.

403
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:52,630
- She attacked.

404
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,980
She knew what they were,
and she attacked them.

405
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,183
- Jesus.

406
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:08,531
Look at the size of these teeth.

407
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,770
Is it...

408
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,610
- [Dr. Baines] Serrasalmus Mutandis...

409
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,883
A brand new species.

410
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:26,131
- [Kid] What's wrong?

411
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:28,413
- Damned if I knew.

412
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,267
The guy at the store told
me it was strong enough to

413
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:33,140
hold a 20 pound catfish.

414
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,930
Look at this, damn thing
must have been maid in Taiwan

415
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,040
or some place.

416
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,313
See, I tell you, ain't nothing
like a good old American net.

417
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:45,860
- Well, maybe something bit
through it or something.

418
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,550
- Nothing in this river got
anything strong enough to bite

419
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,830
that.

420
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,870
No, the guy just beat us, that's all.

421
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,840
Yip,

422
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,370
just a piece of Taiwan crap.

423
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,757
Come on, let's go down to the other one.

424
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:01,680
Now that one was made in New Jersey.

425
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,310
- Okay, campers.

426
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,130
I know you all wanna do a
great job on this commercial

427
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,363
for Mr. Wechsler, our director.

428
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,865
- Everybody, just call me Terry.

429
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:14,698
- Terry.

430
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,060
I think you all know your line by now.

431
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,201
Let's hear it.

432
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,563
- [All] (unenthusiastically) It's great!

433
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:29,040
- Feel like it's snagged
on something in the bottom.

434
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,253
Dammit, damn arm is tangled up in it.

435
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:35,406
- Good old American know-how, huh dad?

436
00:28:35,406 --> 00:28:36,402
Want me to help?

437
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:38,282
- No, no, no, just get
that end of the canoe,

438
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:39,548
and balance it.

439
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:41,751
- I thought you knew about
all this kind of stuff

440
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:43,542
when you know, when you were a boy.

441
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:44,472
(screeching)

442
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,170
- When I was a boy...

443
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:50,425
We made our own nets, and
we made em right, and--

444
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:51,867
Ouch!
- Did you get bit?

445
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:54,053
- Ow!

446
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:54,915
- Dad!

447
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:55,915
- Stay back!

448
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,439
- Dad!

449
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:01,939
(tense music)

450
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:09,934
(screaming)

451
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:20,633
- Dad, please help me,
daddy, help me please.

452
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,466
Dad!

453
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:27,280
(crying) Aw, dad.

454
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,430
- So the government
paid you to raise fish?

455
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,080
- It's a little more
complicated than that,

456
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,700
it's genetics, radiation,
and behavior modification,

457
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,743
selective breeding.

458
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,900
They called it, Operation: Razorteeth.

459
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,800
- What was it for?

460
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,140
- To destroy enemy river systems.

461
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,343
Specifically in Eastern
Europe, and Russia.

462
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,620
We were supposed to develop a
strain of fish that could live

463
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,870
in any type of water, and reproduce

464
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,423
at a greatly accelerated rate.

465
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,013
They provided anything
we needed, blank check.

466
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,911
And then the cold war ended,

467
00:30:04,911 --> 00:30:08,080
a new administration came
into the White House,

468
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,303
and our funding was cut.

469
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
- Kids in the river.

470
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,323
Oh god.

471
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,160
- What?

472
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,550
- The dam, they're letting
river water through

473
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,550
every couple of days to
keep the water levels steady

474
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,850
on the new lake.

475
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,330
My daughter's up there at
camp for a couple of weeks.

476
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,430
They're in the water practically everyday.

477
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,020
- Just how dangerous are they?

478
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,470
- They kill more people
every year than sharks do,

479
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,220
they'll attack anything that moves.

480
00:30:41,525 --> 00:30:43,255
- Okay, we're gonna do
the buddy system now!

481
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:45,034
Everybody grab your buddy,

482
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:48,295
hold up your arms, let
me see your buddy's hand.

483
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,183
(cheering)

484
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,433
Buddies, whoa!

485
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:52,700
Buddies!

486
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,040
- Dad?

487
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,873
Daddy?

488
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,720
Daddy?

489
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,550
Please help me, dad.

490
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,650
- You're not blaming me for this, are you?

491
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,433
I think you are.

492
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,650
That's incredible, I
think you're blaming me.

493
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,170
You're the one who drained
the pool at the test site.

494
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,410
- You open your mouth one more
time, and I will shove this

495
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,410
bottle down it.

496
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,770
Do you think they've opened the dam yet?

497
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,078
- God, I hope not.

498
00:31:24,078 --> 00:31:25,104
- [Kid] Daddy!

499
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:26,271
- What's that?

500
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,953
- [Kid] Daddy, help me!

501
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,240
Daddy, please help me, somebody, help me!

502
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,447
- Oh my god, Paul.

503
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:38,650
- Move it, move it!

504
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,417
Go, go, go.
- There up ahead.

505
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,440
- I see him.
- Stay on top!

506
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,584
- We're coming.

507
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:45,049
- Daddy, help me!

508
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:46,592
- Stay on top!

509
00:31:46,592 --> 00:31:48,113
Paul...
- [Kid] Daddy,

510
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:49,833
please help me, somebody, help me!

511
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,583
- Paul, it's sinking,
the canoe is sinking.

512
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:52,502
- Hold on!

513
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:53,764
- (sobbing) Please help me.

514
00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:55,766
- Go, go, go, go.
- We're coming!

515
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:57,836
No!
- Dr. Baines!

516
00:31:57,836 --> 00:31:59,678
- [Maggie] Dr. Baines!

517
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:02,178
(tense music)

518
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:04,663
- Push Paul!

519
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:07,623
- [Paul] Baines!

520
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:10,040
- Hey there, Baines, help me.

521
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:13,864
- Son of a bitch.

522
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,193
- Please!

523
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:22,110
- Just give it to her.
- Please God.

524
00:32:24,504 --> 00:32:29,504
(frantic screaming)
(tense music)

525
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:35,700
- Oh god!

526
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,810
- Oh my god.

527
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,910
She's still breathing.

528
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:56,278
- Is the boy okay?

529
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,813
Is the boy okay?

530
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,033
- Yes, he's okay.

531
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,590
- Baines, you bred them, you fed them,

532
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,140
what else can they do?

533
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,723
Baines, how can we stop them?

534
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,868
Baines!

535
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:11,430
Baines!

536
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,263
Dammit!

537
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,820
- Hello neighbors.

538
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,810
Yes, you now have the chance
to be a part of a modern

539
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,293
ecological miracle.

540
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:35,410
Acres, and acres, of reclaimed land...

541
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,110
Nestled in a scenic mountain valley.

542
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,850
Site of the newly formed Lost River...

543
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,190
Lake Resort.

544
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,350
Yes siree, Bob, you have everything here.

545
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,030
You're gonna have swimming,
you're gonna have sailing,

546
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,280
you're gonna have scuba
diving, and you're gonna have

547
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,740
skin diving, and yes, you'll
even have shuffle board.

548
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,120
And just take a look at
this beautiful marina.

549
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,730
- Cut, cut, cut!

550
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,133
Who is the bleach blonde bimbo
with her tits in the shot?

551
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,323
- I am the one who gets
to say "Cut", Dennis.

552
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:12,657
Cut.

553
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,200
- Oh, that's much better.

554
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,653
You learned that at film school?

555
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,950
- Yes, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

556
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,320
- I was exubing.

557
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,970
- [JR] Well, you're standing
in the camera range.

558
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,450
Now I'm spending an extraordinary
amount of money on this

559
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,990
film crew, and they got you in the shot.

560
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,190
Yeah.
- How did I look?

561
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,660
- Excuse me, JR.

562
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,520
Sweetie, if you want
watch from behind camera,

563
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,230
that's just fine, we just can't
have you in the shot, okay?

564
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,463
- Okay, if you promise me to
make our own movie later on.

565
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,343
- Oh...

566
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,163
I do.

567
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,437
- Thank God, the rest
of the bozos don't get

568
00:34:57,437 --> 00:34:58,387
here till tomorrow.

569
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,009
(kids shouting and screaming)

570
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:05,342
- [Kid] Gotta stay this way.

571
00:35:06,968 --> 00:35:08,468
Come on, you guys.

572
00:35:14,257 --> 00:35:15,607
- What's the matter, honey?

573
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,660
You wanna tell me about it?

574
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,810
- The kids were yelling at
her, cause she wouldn't race.

575
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,710
She's afraid of paraffin in the water.

576
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:24,923
- Is that right, Susie?

577
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,160
- Well, I'll take you in the
tube base if you want me to,

578
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,740
okay?

579
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,540
Just think, in a couple of days,

580
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,440
you'd be back home where the
only water's in your bathtub.

581
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,010
You're not afraid of a
bathtub now, are you?

582
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,870
- No, bathtubs are okay.

583
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,260
- You can stay away from
all rivers, lakes and oceans

584
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,413
until you're not afraid any more.

585
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:45,184
- [Susie] Yeah.
- Okay.

586
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,434
- Thanks Laura.

587
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,357
- You keep an eye on her for me, okay?

588
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,563
I'm gonna go and check on other monsters.

589
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,470
You're at camp, have fun.

590
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,303
- Okay.

591
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,870
- Laura.
- Yeah.

592
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,020
There's nothing bad in
the river, is there?

593
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,240
- No, just a few little fish.

594
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,923
See you in a little while.

595
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:10,176
- That's good.

596
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:15,490
- [Paul] Well so far, we
know that they can survive

597
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,423
in cold water.

598
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:19,887
- [Maggie] Yeah, they seem
to be moving downstream.

599
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:22,450
- They're big, really big.

600
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,670
Judging by the size of their head,

601
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,550
they're at least a foot long.

602
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,080
- We gotta find someone who
knows how to deal with these

603
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,913
things.

604
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:35,204
(screeching)

605
00:36:35,204 --> 00:36:36,700
- Well, there'll be a phone at the dam,

606
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,663
we can call ahead.

607
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,983
- Hey!
- What is it?

608
00:36:45,073 --> 00:36:47,573
- The lashing's coming undone.

609
00:36:48,563 --> 00:36:49,396
- Whoa!

610
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:55,956
- It's Baines, it's her blood.

611
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:02,100
- The blood's seething through,
they're eating away at the

612
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,850
lashes to get to her.

613
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:09,097
- Paul, the raft is coming a part.

614
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:11,875
- Daddy, that's my daddy, leave my daddy!

615
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:12,708
Daddy!

616
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:13,545
- Maggie get em off.

617
00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:15,295
I've got to grab her.

618
00:37:19,506 --> 00:37:20,339
- Daddy!

619
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:34,960
- It's the blood, it's soaked in,

620
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,210
they won't stop, let's
get to shore, come on.

621
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,166
- Paul.

622
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,761
My pack!

623
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:46,761
Paul.
- Push!

624
00:37:55,802 --> 00:37:57,135
Closer, come on!

625
00:37:58,011 --> 00:37:58,844
Push!

626
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:05,925
- Jump!

627
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,410
How far is the dam?

628
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,573
- It's close, I'm gonna run ahead.

629
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:20,788
(tense music)

630
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,423
- Hey, pretty, pretty,
pretty, pretty fishy.

631
00:38:30,423 --> 00:38:32,840
(screeching)

632
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,670
- [Radio Host] We're back, here's Orlando.

633
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,483
So Sarah, you're saying--

634
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:43,983
(tense music)

635
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,270
At the time, your husband, Ed,

636
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,278
was sleeping with your son's orthodontist?

637
00:38:49,278 --> 00:38:52,520
- [Other Radio Host] Damn straight.

638
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,610
- [Radio Host] Now, this
was about the same time,

639
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:57,650
Ed started cross-dressing,
isn't that right?

640
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,360
- [Announcer] Stand by
to open the flood gates.

641
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,413
Alright, Tony, ready on that wheel?

642
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,540
- [Ed] I only pledged my allegiance to the

643
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,110
prince of darkness, when
she started belly dancing

644
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,710
for the men at the old age home.

645
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,580
- [Radio Host] After Sarah
and Melissa will tell us about

646
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,250
their new--
- [Announcer] Turn that wheel,

647
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,253
let's open her up.

648
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,600
- Stop!

649
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,560
Don't open that.

650
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,180
Please don't open that.

651
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:44,207
(police radio in the background)

652
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,620
- Well, part of your story
checks out, Mister Grogan.

653
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,440
Defense Department said they
did have a Dr. Leticia Baines

654
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,220
working for em several years back,

655
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,420
but they said they never
heard of anything called

656
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,183
Operation: Razorteeth.

657
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,720
They've never been messing
around with any piranha fish.

658
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,950
- Well, you think they're
gonna admit to this, come on.

659
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,730
- Yeah, he's right, I mean
the government's gonna try

660
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,670
and distance itself as
much as possible from this

661
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:11,110
whole thing, it'd be a
major embarrassment to them.

662
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,497
- Right now, what we gotta do,
we gotta get to the resort,

663
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:16,563
and the kids camp, and we gotta
get those people evacuated.

664
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,640
- Look officer, please, call JR Randolph,

665
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,980
He hire me to find his niece,

666
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,900
but we think that she was killed
by the piranha in the pool

667
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,853
at the test site.

668
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,453
- Wait here.

669
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,210
- Look, if I don't open tomorrow,

670
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,640
I will lose everything,
I'll be completely broke,

671
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,830
it's as simple as that.

672
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,390
There's just too much riding
on this, don't you see?

673
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,270
Besides I seriously doubt
if your little killer fish

674
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,590
could chew their way through a dam.

675
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,563
- Here's your dam.

676
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,740
If you follow the river here above it,

677
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,350
there's a stream that bypasses the dam,

678
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,540
and flows directly into the lake,

679
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,790
straight to your resort.

680
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,620
The fish have a way around the dam.

681
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,530
- Those fish have
neither the intelligence,

682
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,640
or the motivation to find
that bypass, Mr. Grogan.

683
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,300
- The fish were bred for intelligence,

684
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,680
and endurance, and God knows what else.

685
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,630
- Carl, this is getting awfully boring.

686
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,200
- You are deliberately ignoring me.

687
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,540
- No, Grogan, I remember you.

688
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,587
You were big news for
about 15 minutes or so,

689
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:30,400
and then, you lost that
big case against the

690
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,040
save the
gay-feminist-Cambodian-whale group

691
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,889
that shut down the...

692
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:36,603
smelting plant.

693
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,270
Now, I guess you figured
on getting a little payback

694
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,960
against those greedy corporate
types who bent you over,

695
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,530
ruined your life.

696
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,520
Well, golly gosh almighty, Grogen,

697
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,560
your sad story just about breaks my heart,

698
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,480
but you're a little bit late.

699
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,503
This project's going ahead as planned.

700
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,053
Nice try tough.

701
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,510
- What about Barbara?

702
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,310
- Miss McNamara...

703
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,143
Exactly what proof do you
have that she's been killed.

704
00:42:03,382 --> 00:42:04,633
- What about the locket?

705
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,430
- It was in the pack, and
that fell into the river

706
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,978
when we jumped off the raft.

707
00:42:09,978 --> 00:42:11,950
- Well, that's convenient.

708
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,790
- Mr. Randolph, we think
that your niece was killed

709
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,090
by the piranha.

710
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,300
- No, she's not dead,

711
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,240
she's run off, she's
alone with that miserable

712
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,300
assistant manager of mine.

713
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,640
I give em about two weeks of shacking up,

714
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,550
and then she'll drop him like
last week's fashion layout.

715
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,550
- It's a nice thing for an uncle to say.

716
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,330
- Carl, I don't have time for this,

717
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,757
I have the biggest day of
my life happening tomorrow,

718
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:34,680
now I don't know what these
two are trying to pull,

719
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,310
or who they may be working
for, but they are not

720
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,860
gonna stop that from happening.

721
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,730
- I'm working for you, Mr. Randolph.

722
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,270
- No, honey, not anymore
you're not, you're through,

723
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,562
you're fired, now don't be
looking to be picking up

724
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,260
the rest of your money either,

725
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,510
I think I've solved this case
on my own, Miss Sherlock.

726
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,660
- Come on, Maggie.

727
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,950
Let's go to the press, people
aren't going in the water,

728
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,880
I got a friend at the times
that'll love to run this story,

729
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,713
pal.

730
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,413
Hey, wait a minute, sheriff,
you got nothing you can hold

731
00:42:57,413 --> 00:42:58,363
us on.

732
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,450
- He's right, JR, they
haven't done anything illegal.

733
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,520
- Well, who said anything about illegal,

734
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,900
I'm just inviting this nice
young couple to be my guests

735
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,310
at one of our brand new
luxury waterfront condos,

736
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,770
no, I tell you what.

737
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,360
I'll give you one night
free at our best model,

738
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,000
usually going for 1200 a night.

739
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,530
- And we'll be staying
there just long enough

740
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,690
to miss the opening
festivities tomorrow right?

741
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,590
- Yeah, where the sheriff's
men is our household servants.

742
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,310
- You hear that, Carl.

743
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,500
And who says our younger
generation ain't getting smarter,

744
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,763
and smarter every day.

745
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,750
- Just make yourselves comfortable, folks,

746
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,030
you'll be spending the night.

747
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,530
- What about our phone call,
you owe us a phone call.

748
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,040
- That's only if you've been arrested,

749
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,200
you're only being held, and
there's a fella named Leonard

750
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,700
sleeping in the next
room, he's your jailer.

751
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,460
You wake Leonard up, you better
have a pretty good reason.

752
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,910
I gotta get back on that road now,

753
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,713
so you two just behave yourselves.

754
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:55,103
- Wait a minute, my daughter
is down there, goddammit.

755
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,993
There are kids down there!

756
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,190
The piranha are coming!

757
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,440
You've got to believe me!

758
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,857
(insects chirping)

759
00:44:29,749 --> 00:44:32,160
- [Terry] God, you look...

760
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,933
Great in this light.

761
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,650
Reminds me of a shot I
once saw in a Bergman film.

762
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,500
- So do you know anyone
famous in the business?

763
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,073
- [Terry] Eh, not really.

764
00:44:46,073 --> 00:44:48,973
I work mostly in commercials
since I finished film school.

765
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,830
I wanna move into features though.

766
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,594
Yeah.

767
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:55,427
Some day.

768
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,107
- How about a swim, Mr. Director?

769
00:45:19,452 --> 00:45:21,260
Easy tiger.

770
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,793
I'm a good girl, don't
let my looks fool you.

771
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,140
- I have...

772
00:45:27,065 --> 00:45:28,933
I have something, I have to tell you.

773
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:29,766
- What?

774
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:32,513
- I can't swim.

775
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,283
- What did you think we
were coming out here for?

776
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,370
- Water sports weren't
exactly what I had in mind.

777
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,203
- Oh.

778
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:46,290
That's too bad, guess, I'll
just have to swim by myself.

779
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,123
- Wait a second.

780
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,450
Don't you wanna...

781
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,930
Play hide the buoy with me.

782
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,120
- You think I'd just
gonna give it up to you

783
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:55,953
like that?

784
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,340
I'm kind of like a promotion, Terry...

785
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,443
You have to earn me.

786
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,430
You asshole.

787
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,150
- Great dialog.

788
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,810
I love improvisation,

789
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,323
just like in an Altman film.

790
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:16,940
- Well fine, you like improv?

791
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,090
Well, I'll swim back to shore on my own,

792
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,830
and you can just sit
there, and play with your

793
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,993
camera, little boy.

794
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,243
Good bye, Terry.

795
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,563
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

796
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,162
Gina?

797
00:46:38,348 --> 00:46:41,931
(mysterious ominous music)

798
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:47,204
Gina!

799
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:51,923
Gina!

800
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:00,463
Gina?

801
00:47:01,802 --> 00:47:04,219
(screeching)

802
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:12,956
Oh my god.

803
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,193
Holy shit.

804
00:47:19,697 --> 00:47:21,198
Oh Jesus.

805
00:47:21,198 --> 00:47:22,031
Gina!

806
00:47:23,118 --> 00:47:24,118
No, oh shit.

807
00:47:27,653 --> 00:47:28,486
Gina!

808
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:45,343
- What the hell are you doing?

809
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,050
- You ever see a move called
"Big Bust From Cellblock 7"?

810
00:47:50,632 --> 00:47:51,465
- No.

811
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,630
- The lead guy was this plumber
who got life in the slam

812
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,270
for killing his cheating wife.

813
00:47:59,447 --> 00:48:00,280
Yeah.

814
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,590
The lead character came up
with this genius escape plan

815
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,800
that busted he and his
buddies in cell block seven

816
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,850
out of the clutches of a sadistic warden.

817
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,610
- What are you doing?

818
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,623
- And being a plumber, he
used what he knew best.

819
00:48:21,663 --> 00:48:26,050
- Jeez.

820
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,130
- Jesus, are you okay?

821
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,463
- Give me one of your socks, hurry up.

822
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:31,882
- What?

823
00:48:33,325 --> 00:48:35,040
- One of your socks, come
on, it's part of the plan.

824
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,240
Hurry up, Paul, the
crash probably woke him.

825
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:49,810
- [Paul] what happened
at the end of the movie,

826
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:50,878
did they make it?

827
00:48:50,878 --> 00:48:52,104
- No...

828
00:48:52,104 --> 00:48:54,040
They all got shot to pieces.

829
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,003
They came close.

830
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:56,923
- Close.

831
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,543
Close works for me.

832
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,063
Pretty damn close.

833
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:09,040
- Sweet Jesus, what's going on in here,

834
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,203
it sounded like the damn
roof fell on the damn place.

835
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:19,310
- Where did all the water
on the floor come from?

836
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,860
- Oh, something's leaking, and boy...

837
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,162
If it doesn't stop, I'm
gonna get pneumonia.

838
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:27,190
- [Leonard] Oh alright, I'll
have to take a look at it,

839
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:29,290
you stand back over there, and I'll see...

840
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:31,716
What I can come up with.

841
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:36,720
Oh no, no, now you stand
back over there, missy.

842
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,853
Back over there now.

843
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,753
Okay

844
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:46,780
what in the world did you do down here?

845
00:49:48,055 --> 00:49:49,120
What were you tying to do,

846
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,143
escape out through the drain
pipe, or some damn thing?

847
00:49:54,132 --> 00:49:56,541
Ow!

848
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:58,090
Ow.

849
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,230
- [Maggie] Oh my god,
I think I killed him.

850
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,530
- Maggie, what's going on?

851
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:05,800
- Oh, he's alive.

852
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,010
- What Happened?

853
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:09,690
- I knocked him out,
he's okay, he's alive.

854
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:10,793
- Well, get his keys.

855
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,390
- They're chained to his pants.

856
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,920
- Takes his pants off then.

857
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:34,511
- Leonard?

858
00:50:35,445 --> 00:50:40,445
("When the Saints Go
Marchin' In" instrumental)

859
00:50:51,736 --> 00:50:54,875
- [JR] So glad you made
it today, bear with me,

860
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:56,650
you'll have the older people over there.

861
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,483
Okay, I'll catch you later.

862
00:50:57,483 --> 00:50:58,960
Thank you, take care.

863
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:02,970
- Ladies, and gentlemen,

864
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,330
on behalf of the Lost River
Development Corporation,

865
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,580
I am so very happy to welcome you to our

866
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,980
opening festivities.

867
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,650
Now if during the day,
you have any questions

868
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,870
about the purchase of site up here,

869
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,190
will have our people mingle
with you to answer them,

870
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,860
but remember, you have no
obligation to buy anything,

871
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,155
only to enjoy yourselves.

872
00:51:22,155 --> 00:51:22,988
Alright.

873
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,881
Don't forget, free
barbecue at one o'clock.

874
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:36,353
Hit it!

875
00:51:36,353 --> 00:51:41,353
("When the Saints Go
Marchin' In" instrumental)

876
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:47,577
yeah, how're ya doing, how's it going?

877
00:51:51,466 --> 00:51:53,716
Looking good, looking good.

878
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:56,315
- Hit the bullseye.

879
00:51:56,315 --> 00:51:57,148
Oh.

880
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:00,073
Okay kids, come together,

881
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:03,073
it's time for the water competition.

882
00:52:04,948 --> 00:52:06,865
Where the hell is Gina?

883
00:52:11,592 --> 00:52:13,130
- Salt water.

884
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:13,963
- What?

885
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:15,860
- It was salt water, I just remembered.

886
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,930
- What was?

887
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,320
- In the pool, at the test site.

888
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,820
I thought it was strange at the time,

889
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,290
and then I completely forgot about it.

890
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,480
- So?

891
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,675
- So, piranha are fresh water fish,

892
00:52:26,675 --> 00:52:29,220
Dr. Baines said she was breeding a strand

893
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,960
that could survive in either fresh water,

894
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,150
or salt water, that's why the
fish are headed downstream.

895
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,700
- And if they get into the
ocean, there'll be no way

896
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,010
to contain them.

897
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:39,890
They'll be able to swim up
every single river system

898
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:40,860
in the country.

899
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:47,779
- Ready, set, go!

900
00:52:56,038 --> 00:52:58,705
(ominous music)

901
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,017
(screeching)

902
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:55,333
(tense ominous music)

903
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,432
- [Maggie] Paul.

904
00:54:09,432 --> 00:54:10,265
Paul!

905
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:12,625
Paul!

906
00:54:16,814 --> 00:54:19,231
(screeching)

907
00:54:33,534 --> 00:54:35,951
(screeching)

908
00:54:42,617 --> 00:54:44,950
(screaming)

909
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:10,468
- Laura, do something, I'm sinking!

910
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,225
- Laura, oh god.

911
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:20,814
- I'm sinking!
- Darlene,

912
00:55:20,814 --> 00:55:22,981
try and give me your hand.

913
00:55:29,644 --> 00:55:31,977
(screaming)

914
00:55:36,097 --> 00:55:38,680
- Just stay on top of the raft.

915
00:56:02,524 --> 00:56:04,756
- Laura, Darlene!

916
00:56:04,756 --> 00:56:06,923
- Darlene, grab your half.

917
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,653
(screaming)

918
00:56:42,197 --> 00:56:45,197
- Darlene, we gotta get out of here.

919
00:56:47,786 --> 00:56:49,369
- Darlene, hold on!

920
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,942
- [Laura] Darlene, wait!

921
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:56,359
Darlene, Darlene, get on top of the boat.

922
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:58,914
- Laura!

923
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:02,544
(screaming)

924
00:57:09,935 --> 00:57:11,268
- Laura!
- Laura!

925
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,515
- Call the resort, I'll get
these kids out of the water.

926
00:57:29,515 --> 00:57:33,738
- Okay.

927
00:57:33,738 --> 00:57:35,761
- [Susie] Daddy, help me, daddy!

928
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:36,811
- Susie!

929
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:37,644
- Dad!

930
00:57:48,478 --> 00:57:49,561
- I'm coming!

931
00:57:56,127 --> 00:57:57,984
- Grab the ore, sweetie.

932
00:57:57,984 --> 00:57:58,817
- Dad!

933
00:57:59,658 --> 00:58:00,491
- Dad!

934
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,579
- Hey Susie, you alright?

935
00:58:07,579 --> 00:58:08,732
- Yeah.

936
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:10,644
- Sit in the back, sit in the back.

937
00:58:10,644 --> 00:58:11,477
Let's go.

938
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,003
Easy, easy.

939
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,500
(telephone ringing)

940
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,763
- Mr. Randolph's office.

941
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:21,573
An emergency?

942
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,130
Ah yes.

943
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,230
That is important.

944
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:29,230
We'll have to clear the water at once.

945
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,460
Mm, okay.

946
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,450
Yes.

947
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:33,560
Thanks for calling.

948
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,393
Okay.

949
00:58:34,393 --> 00:58:35,226
Bye bye.

950
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,410
More of those crackpot
environmentalists, Mr. Randolph.

951
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:42,230
They say, "Thousands upon
thousands of piranha are headed

952
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,263
our way.

953
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,540
- Piranha?

954
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,747
Imagine that, eh.

955
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:56,243
- And I want you to call these
kids all together, alright?

956
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:01,553
- Okay MINOS, buddy system,

957
00:59:01,553 --> 00:59:02,970
get your partner.

958
00:59:04,563 --> 00:59:06,623
- [Paul] Come on kids, line up.

959
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,790
Help's coming.

960
00:59:11,956 --> 00:59:12,789
- Hi.

961
00:59:14,529 --> 00:59:17,582
- Did you get in touch with
anyone besides Randolph?

962
00:59:17,582 --> 00:59:20,195
- Uh, I told em the whole story, but...

963
00:59:20,195 --> 00:59:21,090
I don't think they believe me.

964
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,883
Felt like I was being humored.

965
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,570
- We'll have to go ourselves.

966
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,860
Could you handle this?

967
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,440
- Well...

968
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,273
I think so.

969
00:59:32,761 --> 00:59:34,847
I love you, daddy.

970
00:59:34,847 --> 00:59:36,297
- I'm so proud of you, honey.

971
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:38,608
We'll come back for ya.

972
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:47,646
("When the Saints Go
Marchin' In" instrumental)

973
01:00:09,228 --> 01:00:12,061
(scuba breathing)

974
01:00:21,939 --> 01:00:23,950
- Glad to see you made it.

975
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,470
Keep a good eye on that caterer,

976
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,129
make sure he's putting all the food out,

977
01:00:27,129 --> 01:00:28,850
I don't want anybody standing
around with and empty plate

978
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:29,720
for any reason.

979
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,970
And lots of booze, plenty of booze.

980
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:33,280
Call the agents, make sure they're pushing

981
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,837
areas six, seven, and eight.

982
01:00:34,837 --> 01:00:36,810
And be sure to tell
security to keep a close eye

983
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,730
out for that lawyer and his lady friend.

984
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,740
Contain em, mold em,
I don't care what they

985
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,380
have to do, I don't want
em talking to anybody,

986
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,213
you got it?

987
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,280
Governor, sir, so glad you could make it.

988
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,030
- Well, JR, you have done
the most beautiful job here,

989
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:50,940
my congratulations to ya.

990
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,530
- Thank you sir, I could
never have done it without

991
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:53,900
your help with my zoning clearance.

992
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,640
- You're too generous, too generous.

993
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,370
- Whitney, I want you to
take the governor's party

994
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,070
to our VIP tents, all your
friends are waiting for you there

995
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:01,903
sir.

996
01:01:01,903 --> 01:01:04,050
- Well that's lovely, come along honey.

997
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:04,883
Come along.

998
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:32,886
- What a hot dog.

999
01:01:32,886 --> 01:01:34,656
Just look at him.

1000
01:01:34,656 --> 01:01:36,406
He's such a show off.

1001
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:39,550
- Meryl.
- Huh?

1002
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:02,298
(ominous mysterious tense music)

1003
01:02:11,234 --> 01:02:13,651
(screeching)

1004
01:02:25,521 --> 01:02:27,854
(screaming)

1005
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:32,410
- Every phone on the premises,

1006
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,940
Whitney, you got that, out of order.

1007
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,700
Now we got to stop this hoax,

1008
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,890
and I want all incoming
calls to witch through here.

1009
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,573
- Yes sir.
- Well, get on it.

1010
01:02:42,891 --> 01:02:45,308
(screeching)

1011
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:51,084
- Go to the shore!

1012
01:02:51,084 --> 01:02:54,602
- Hey, wait a minute, I think
somethings wrong back there.

1013
01:02:54,602 --> 01:02:56,210
- What?

1014
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,207
- He looks really scared.

1015
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,624
(screeching)

1016
01:03:14,295 --> 01:03:16,050
(screeching)

1017
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,835
(shouting)

1018
01:03:18,835 --> 01:03:20,418
- Yous should stop.

1019
01:03:24,326 --> 01:03:25,159
- No, no!

1020
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:27,493
(screeching)

1021
01:03:27,493 --> 01:03:28,326
Speed up!

1022
01:03:30,818 --> 01:03:31,651
No, no!

1023
01:03:32,828 --> 01:03:35,078
- Nope, he says go.

1024
01:03:35,078 --> 01:03:36,242
Speed it up.

1025
01:03:36,242 --> 01:03:37,075
- Go?

1026
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,997
(screaming)

1027
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:47,575
(screeching)

1028
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:53,208
(screeching)

1029
01:04:00,831 --> 01:04:03,164
(screaming)

1030
01:04:32,121 --> 01:04:34,788
(ominous music)

1031
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:37,614
- Whoa!

1032
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,813
- Whoa, alright!

1033
01:04:40,707 --> 01:04:41,540
- Oh god.

1034
01:04:50,935 --> 01:04:51,768
- Huh?

1035
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,152
- He made it to shore.

1036
01:04:56,152 --> 01:04:57,485
- What the hell?

1037
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:00,744
Jump, jump!

1038
01:05:00,744 --> 01:05:01,577
Oh no!

1039
01:05:16,904 --> 01:05:17,987
- Look, look!

1040
01:05:20,128 --> 01:05:22,461
Come on, it's gonna explode.

1041
01:05:34,329 --> 01:05:35,162
- Help!

1042
01:05:36,594 --> 01:05:38,155
- [Woman] Get him.

1043
01:05:38,155 --> 01:05:39,821
Right this way.

1044
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:42,154
(screaming)

1045
01:05:48,827 --> 01:05:51,577
- [Woman] Get me out, get me out!

1046
01:06:21,141 --> 01:06:23,558
(screeching)

1047
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:46,057
- No.

1048
01:06:46,057 --> 01:06:48,430
No, no, of course, it's false,
(telephones ringing)

1049
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,124
they've already called
seven other stations.

1050
01:06:50,124 --> 01:06:50,957
- Mr. Randolph.

1051
01:06:50,957 --> 01:06:51,790
- Excuse me just a moment.

1052
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:52,800
Whitney, I'm on the phone.

1053
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,830
- But sir, the piranha.

1054
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:56,290
- Told you not to mention that word.

1055
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,410
- But the piranha.

1056
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:58,910
- What about the damn piranha?

1057
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:02,443
- They're eating the guests, sir.

1058
01:07:09,284 --> 01:07:11,701
(screeching)

1059
01:07:13,759 --> 01:07:18,759
(tires screeching)
- [Man] Get off, get off, no!

1060
01:07:22,879 --> 01:07:26,299
(screaming and shouting)

1061
01:07:26,299 --> 01:07:27,632
- [Paul] Dammit.

1062
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:29,323
They beat us.

1063
01:07:36,423 --> 01:07:38,270
(screaming)

1064
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:41,057
(screeching)

1065
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,624
- Hey, come on, let's take this boat.

1066
01:07:42,624 --> 01:07:44,291
- I'll get the line.

1067
01:08:03,478 --> 01:08:05,978
(tense music)

1068
01:08:06,859 --> 01:08:08,190
- Where are we going?

1069
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:09,790
- The lake narrows right where the outlets

1070
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,270
to the refinery was.

1071
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:13,680
They'll be bunched tight
when they go through there.

1072
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,560
- And then what?

1073
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,140
- If it's not tapped off,
there might be enough

1074
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,933
waste left in the smelting tanks.

1075
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,323
- It'll kill the piranha?

1076
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,400
- Are you kidding me?

1077
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,733
- It'll kill anything.

1078
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,843
You pollute the bastards to death.

1079
01:08:37,841 --> 01:08:38,674
- See it?

1080
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:40,890
- Oh yeah.

1081
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:43,893
- I toured this place when I
was preparing for the trial.

1082
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:50,710
Dammit.

1083
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:51,723
- What's wrong?

1084
01:08:51,723 --> 01:08:52,813
- It's all flooded.

1085
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:56,480
Waste tanks, the control
booth, everything.

1086
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,120
It's all under water.

1087
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,273
- So what could we do?

1088
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,957
- Let's find the towline.

1089
01:09:02,957 --> 01:09:03,957
- Okay then.

1090
01:09:04,957 --> 01:09:08,457
(screaming and shouting)

1091
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,700
- Now you count slowly to 200,

1092
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,960
and whether I'm at the surface or not,

1093
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,120
you go on out of here, okay?

1094
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,050
Cause it means I'm in trouble.

1095
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,150
200 is about all I can hold my breath for.

1096
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:48,420
Okay, let's count it down together.

1097
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,253
One,

1098
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,010
two,

1099
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:51,900
come on honey,

1100
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,480
three,

1101
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,030
- four

1102
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,420
five

1103
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,770
Six
- I'll be back.

1104
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,421
- [Maggie] Seven,

1105
01:09:59,421 --> 01:10:00,254
eight.

1106
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:05,110
(ominous tense music)

1107
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:30,647
- [Maggie] 33,

1108
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:32,064
34,

1109
01:10:32,064 --> 01:10:33,644
35,

1110
01:10:33,644 --> 01:10:34,477

1114
01:11:05,044 --> 01:11:07,461
(screeching)

1115
01:11:25,124 --> 01:11:26,221
102,

1116
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:27,806
103,

1117
01:11:27,806 --> 01:11:28,639
104...

1118
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:37,823

1119
01:11:37,823 --> 01:11:38,909
111,

1120
01:11:38,909 --> 01:11:39,742
112...

1121
01:11:43,741 --> 01:11:44,634
162,

1122
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:45,740
163,

1123
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,123
164, come on!

1124
01:12:04,395 --> 01:12:05,958
197,

1125
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:06,791
198...

1126
01:12:13,232 --> 01:12:18,232
200.

1127
01:12:19,665 --> 01:12:22,832
(ominous tense music)

1128
01:12:40,914 --> 01:12:41,747
- No.

1129
01:12:44,741 --> 01:12:46,402
No.

1130
01:12:46,402 --> 01:12:47,703
No.

1131
01:12:47,703 --> 01:12:52,703
No, no!

1132
01:12:54,744 --> 01:12:55,577
Oh my god!

1133
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:07,702
Paul!

1134
01:13:11,393 --> 01:13:12,226
Paul!

1135
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:24,510
- While the actual detail remain cloudy,

1136
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:26,810
the extent of this tragedy
is painfully clear.

1137
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:29,410
Dio, get a shot of this guy.

1138
01:13:30,621 --> 01:13:34,121
(emergency radio chatter)

1139
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:37,920
- We can only speculate
the ultimate ramifications

1140
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,150
of this ecological disaster,
could this be nature's revenge

1141
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,410
on man's destruction of his environment?

1142
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:45,220
Only time will tell.

1143
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,330
This is Freddie Long, Channel Six News.

1144
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:48,970
That sucked!

1145
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:51,046
Erase that one, will you Roger?

1146
01:13:51,046 --> 01:13:53,400
(emergency radio chatter)

1147
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,250
What's his story?

1148
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,318
- Found him drifting in
a boat down the lake.

1149
01:13:58,318 --> 01:14:01,991
Hasn't said a word since we found him.

1150
01:14:01,991 --> 01:14:04,648
- [Voice Over PA System]
The piranha are dying,

1151
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:06,890
but get out of the water
until further notice.

1152
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:10,020
I repeat, the piranha are dying.

1153
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,370
- Would you respond to
the allegations, JR.

1154
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:13,203
Is it true?

1155
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,143
What are you going to
do now, Mr. Randolph.

1156
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:31,550
- Mr. Buff and his
brothers have been calling

1157
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,120
from New York, they sound very upset.

1158
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,570
- Get out of here, Whitney.

1159
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:36,403
- Sir?

1160
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,373
- You're fired.

1161
01:15:07,525 --> 01:15:10,328
(gun cocking)

1162
01:15:10,328 --> 01:15:12,495
(gunshot)

1163
01:15:14,395 --> 01:15:17,312
(eerie jazz music)

1164
01:15:25,763 --> 01:15:28,197
- [Woman] I'll be right with you.

1165
01:15:28,197 --> 01:15:30,030
I need help over here.

1166
01:15:34,374 --> 01:15:35,207
- Daddy.

1167
01:15:36,137 --> 01:15:37,233
- Hey Sweetie.

1168
01:15:38,949 --> 01:15:40,309
Are you okay?

1169
01:15:40,309 --> 01:15:42,476
- Yeah, and how about you?

1170
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,063
- Daddy's gonna be just fine.

1171
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:52,618
Hey spade, this mountain
crap is for the birds.

1172
01:15:52,618 --> 01:15:56,650
- What do you think
about a move to a city?

1173
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,900
- Is there a novel in it?

1174
01:16:00,905 --> 01:16:03,060
- Where do you go from here, governor?

1175
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:06,300
- Well, I personally am
gonna head up a full scale

1176
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:09,580
investigation on this
incident, bot because I wish to

1177
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,110
find out who is responsible for it,

1178
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:14,620
and we must be certain this sort of thing

1179
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,900
never, never happens again.

1180
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,170
- [Interviewer] What danger
is there in the possibility

1181
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:21,331
of a piranha reaching the ocean?

1182
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:22,800
- [Governor] Oh, not at all.

1183
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,550
Most of them seemed to
have been destroyed by

1184
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:25,930
the pollution at the end of the lake,

1185
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:29,400
and of course if any of
them did get through,

1186
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,650
they cannot survive the salt water.

1187
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:36,545
Now read my lips boy, everything's okay.

1188
01:16:36,545 --> 01:16:38,795
(cheering)

1189
01:16:44,816 --> 01:16:47,233
(screeching)

1190
01:16:54,469 --> 01:16:56,886
(rock music)
