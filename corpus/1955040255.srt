00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,782
(applause)

3
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,037
Good, good.

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,506
It feels good

5
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,042
to be home in Chicago

6
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,878
in the center of the city.

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,346
Huh?

8
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,916
(applause)

9
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,419
Oh, good.

10
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,389
I grew up, uh, 25 miles away from here

11
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,191
in Arlington Heights.

12
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,561
- (applause, cheering)
- So...

13
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,331
And when we picked this beautiful theater

14
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,432
for this, uh, special,

15
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,401
I told my father, you know,

16
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,170
"I'm gonna do this special

17
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,407
"in Chicago.

18
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,008
I'm gonna do it downtown."

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,643
He didn't say, you know, "I'm proud of you.

20
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,546
Congratulations."

21
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,416
He said, "Where are
these people gonna park?"

22
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,419
(laughter)

23
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,234
It's good to be home.

24
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,401
I-I love this city.

25
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,637
There are certain cities
I do not like going to.

26
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,172
I'm not a Vegas guy.

27
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:50,509
I know a lot of people love to go to Vegas

28
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,310
for a weekend. (imitating laughter)

29
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,681
(muttering): I don't... I don't...

30
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,319
You could see a good, uh,
portion of the population

31
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,655
that descends on Las Vegas over a year,

32
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,957
and I'm here to tell you
we're in trouble, okay?

33
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,559
We're in trouble as a nation

34
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,028
if you look at Las Vegas.

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,898
I don't know, is anybody
embarrassed anymore?

36
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,002
Is there any embarrassment?

37
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,073
Huh?

38
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,643
Is there any shame?

39
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:28,146
I'm checking into a two
billion dollar property, right?

40
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,514
Beautiful.

41
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,217
Italian marble.

42
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,219
Five-star restaurant.

43
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:38,924
Chihuly art hanging from the ceiling.

44
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:42,160
And I looked to my left

45
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,296
at the check-in thing,

46
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,931
and there's a group checking in

47
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,468
with an Igloo cooler.

48
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,575
All right, not even a new one.

49
00:02:56,577 --> 00:03:01,077
Duct tape on the ha... on the handle.

50
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,419
Ten cases of Schlitz.

51
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:13,693
George Foreman Grill?

52
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,663
What are you gonna do,
grill chicken in the room?

53
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,367
Aren't you embarrassed?

54
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,805
Come on!

55
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,408
The place reeks

56
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,577
of cash.

57
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,480
Sammy Davis, Frank Sinatra, used to come.

58
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,983
Tuxedo, cuff links.

59
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:41,588
And you brought chicken thighs?

60
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,459
So I'm like, "You know what,

61
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,160
let me go relax at the pool."

62
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,528
Go to the pool area.

63
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,964
Now, I don't know how
you people do the pool,

64
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,266
but when I go to, like,
a public pool, hotel pool,

65
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,635
I go away from the people.

66
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,303
I don't go near people.

67
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,572
I don't chitchat, all right?

68
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,875
I know a lot of people like
to go in the midst of people.

69
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,912
"Oh, hi!"

70
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,614
"Oh, we love the weather.

71
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,484
We come once a year."

72
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,085
I don't do this shit.

73
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,387
Okay?

74
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,456
I go away from it.

75
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,191
I set up in my own little corner.

76
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,359
I got three towels.

77
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,062
I start making the thing, okay?

78
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,264
Like a fitted sheet, everything...

79
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,901
is tucked in.

80
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,404
Neat.

81
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,905
(chuckles)

82
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,273
I brought a book.

83
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,342
I see people doing this on vacation.

84
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,444
They bring a book to the pool.

85
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,645
You ever see these people?

86
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,280
I watch and I go, "How
are they reading here?"

87
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,817
118 degrees, they're
reading a full-blown book.

88
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,119
So I'm like, "You know
what? Let me try this.

89
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,889
Let me bring a book to the pool."

90
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,323
So I sit down, I open up my book.

91
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:57,195
Now, my biggest problem, I
can't mind my own business.

92
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,931
I'm halfway through the first page,

93
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,199
and I start looking around like,

94
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,600
"What the fuck are they doing?

95
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,569
"What is this?

96
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,906
Why are they doing that?"

97
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,909
There's a group of guys came down loud.

98
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,178
I'm not into loud people.

99
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,513
I heard them before I saw them.

100
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,515
It's this group, the high-five group.

101
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,284
You ever get this group that comes down?

102
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,620
(bellowing)

103
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,956
What? You're 42 years old.

104
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,958
Why are you high-fiving?

105
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,426
You're at the pool.

106
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,295
You didn't score a touchdown.

107
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:33,666
What are you high-fiving
people for at the pool?

108
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,903
And they sit right next to me.

109
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,607
I'm like a magnet for these types, right?

110
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,942
They sit right next to me.

111
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,511
Now I'm honed in on this group.

112
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:50,750
Guy took his shoe off,
four Band-Aids on his foot.

113
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,490
How does it get the four Band-Aids?

114
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,892
How does this happen?

115
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:04,262
After one Band-Aid, isn't
that a hospital visit?

116
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:07,966
What are you trying to fix...

117
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:12,639
at your home with four Band-Aids?

118
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,608
One box of Band-Aids

119
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,910
should last your entire life.

120
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:22,915
This is a one-time purchase.

121
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:28,520
When you die, you should
have leftover Band-Aids

122
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:32,792
for generations to come.

123
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,096
And I'm thinking if this guy

124
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,466
gets into the pool

125
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,168
with his Band-Aids on,

126
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,435
they're gonna have to

127
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,272
drain the pool and refill it.

128
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:50,375
I'm not getting into the pool

129
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,645
with Band-Aid juice
floating on top of the pool.

130
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,213
All right?

131
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,784
I don't know what's
underneath the Band-Aids.

132
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,221
There's always a Band-Aid;
there's always a loose Band-Aid

133
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,356
in the pool.

134
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,457
It will find you.

135
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,892
You'll be talking,

136
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,594
hanging out, right?

137
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,296
The damn thing will just come in.

138
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:14,566
You're like, "Oh, God!

139
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,635
"It's a Band-Aid!

140
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,337
"Get it away from me!

141
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,874
Get it away from me."

142
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,276
You're wearing Band-Aids,

143
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,047
you should be disallowed in the pool area.

144
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,015
Okay?

145
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,017
But this is the country, people.

146
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,352
This is what we're living in.

147
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,587
We are in trouble.

148
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:39,490
Igloo coolers and Band-Aids, okay?

149
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,360
No wonder the Chinese are winning.

150
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,295
All right?

151
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,231
Something's going on in the country.

152
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,465
It's got to be the Internet.

153
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,234
It's got to be the Internet.

154
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:53,938
Internet's bringing out people
we never even knew existed.

155
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,942
30 years ago, these people
never left the house.

156
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,178
They were in their basement,
talking to themselves.

157
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,648
(bellowing)

158
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,224
(chuckles)

159
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,393
They didn't leave.

160
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,930
They had no outlet.

161
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,467
Now you give them the Internet?

162
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,304
They have an outlet to
the rest of the world.

163
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,439
Now they're in chat rooms and...

164
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,943
(bellowing)

165
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,352
Where are people getting the time

166
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,255
to do half of the stuff
they're doing online?

167
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,892
People are living on the computer.

168
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:52,394
Writing reviews on
restaurants that they go to?

169
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:57,603
You got nothing going on with your life?

170
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,341
I don't know, me and my
wife, we go out to dinner.

171
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,910
I'll tell her right there, salmon sucked.

172
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,645
Let's get the fuck out of here.

173
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,982
That's it.

174
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,060
We don't run home and
tattletale on the restaurant.

175
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,096
Who's got this time to write

176
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,433
an 18-page essay on asparagus?

177
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,970
Who's doing this?

178
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,142
This Internet, there's
something for everybody.

179
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,277
Right?

180
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,112
You got some weird fetish,

181
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,915
some weird thing you do...

182
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,484
Look at how weird it just got in here, huh?

183
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:50,388
Some of you are into this type of behavior.

184
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,156
But if you like something weird...

185
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,926
You like to, if you're an adult,

186
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,228
you like to dress up as a baby,

187
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,298
there's a Web site for you.

188
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,201
30 years ago,

189
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,303
if you liked to dress up as a baby,

190
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,239
nobody knew that.

191
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,275
You did that in the
privacy of your own home.

192
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,044
If you ever came out of your house

193
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,345
with a diaper on,

194
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,881
your neighbor would go, "Look at this shit.

195
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:17,949
"Call the FBI.

196
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,485
Get this shit out of the neighborhood."

197
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,886
Right?

198
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,990
It was handled.

199
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,161
But today, just throw it up in the Google.

200
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,733
"I like to dress up as a baby."

201
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,101
Next thing you know, they're at the Hilton

202
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,171
on a Saturday with 863 people

203
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,975
that like to do this shit.

204
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,914
Something's wrong in the country.

205
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,250
Okay?

206
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,919
Where do people get the time?

207
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,254
Look around you.

208
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,892
Everybody's just walking around.

209
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,606
Taking a photo of yourself?

210
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,240
They call it a selfie.

211
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,943
I can't even say the word without sweating.

212
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,080
I can't stand the word.

213
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,117
I call it taking a lonely.

214
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,286
(chuckles) Do you know

215
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,624
how alone you got to be...

216
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:37,096
...that you can't find
anybody to take a photo?

217
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:43,334
That you got 838 photos of yourself

218
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,471
in your bathroom?

219
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,072
What are you doing?

220
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,444
What are you doing?

221
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,818
Nobody's working.

222
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,519
Nobody's working.

223
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,355
We got people in this country

224
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,290
hanging outside movie
theaters for four days

225
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,292
for a movie to come out.

226
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,062
Friday's the release date.

227
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,230
They're there Tuesday.

228
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,398
They g a tent they're setting up,

229
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,134
a little picnic area, generator,

230
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:20,872
sleeping bag.

231
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:25,374
And they're dressed as
the character in the movie.

232
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,615
Who's doing this?

233
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,618
My family, my friends, nobody does this.

234
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,989
Nobody does this.

235
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,992
Okay? I've never called my buddy.

236
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,126
"Frankie, what are you doing?"

237
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,462
"Eh, nothing, I'm dressed as Batman.

238
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:48,100
"I've been sleeping in a tent.

239
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,972
I got the cape on eBay for 18 grand."

240
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,144
I live in Los Angeles; I
see it on the day-to-day.

241
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,046
Celebrity goes on trial,

242
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,347
downtown at the courtroom,

243
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,316
you got people outside the courtroom,

244
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,252
marching around with signs.

245
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,420
All right?

246
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,156
"Justice for Lindsay!

247
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,928
Justice for Lindsay!"

248
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,701
No job?

249
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,269
You got nowhere to be

250
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,606
on a Monday at 8:30 in the morning?

251
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:32,476
I never made a sign.

252
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,014
Have you?

253
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,051
I've never wrote on a cardboard box

254
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,654
my feelings...

255
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,623
stapled it to a stick,

256
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,627
drove the stick somewhere...

257
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,097
and marched around in a circle for 12 h...

258
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,601
"Justice for...!"

259
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,339
Some of you are laughing at this.

260
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,607
Some of you are not.

261
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,242
Listen, if you're
laughing, you're on board;

262
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,211
if you're not, you're the
fucking problem, I'm sorry.

263
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,948
Okay?

264
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,151
I'm looking at some of you. You're like,

265
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,286
"I don't know why this is funny.

266
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,455
"I dress up as Batman

267
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,990
"and I have an Igloo cooler.

268
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,627
I don't know what's so funny about this."

269
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,866
The world doesn't match
my upbringing, okay?

270
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,234
I'm here to tell you that.

271
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,502
I grew up

272
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,970
with an immigrant family.

273
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,939
My father's Sicilian, my mother's Italian.

274
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,074
I gotta, I gotta clarify that, all right?

275
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,310
(audience cheering)

276
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,312
Half Sicilian, half Italian.

277
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,546
But if you talk to my father,

278
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,315
"You're Sicilian. You're Sicilian!"

279
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,952
Okay, Dad, relax.

280
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,455
They instilled work ethic
into me at a young age.

281
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,291
Young. If you come from immigrants,

282
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,526
they don't play around with the work. Okay?

283
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,894
I've been working since I've been eight.

284
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,131
Eight years old, these
people put me to work.

285
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,532
I didn't know what was going on.

286
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:02,933
I was watching cartoons on a Saturday,

287
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,869
my-my father walked in the living room.

288
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,570
He was like, "Hey. Go start a business."

289
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,472
What?

290
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,942
Now?

291
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,982
Right?

292
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,086
They never bought us anything.

293
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,088
I come from middle-class upbringing.

294
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,657
They never bought us a damn thing.

295
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,061
They told us who had what we wanted

296
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,432
in the neighborhood.

297
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,467
I'm like, "Dad, could we get a dog?"

298
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,535
"Dog, yeah.

299
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,105
"Two houses down, they got a dog.

300
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,442
"You want to pet an animal?

301
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,177
"You walk two houses down,

302
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,447
"you pet their dog and
then you come back here

303
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,182
and cut my lawn."

304
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,217
What?

305
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,919
What lawn... why...?

306
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,089
What does the lawn have to do with a puppy?

307
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,492
What are you talking about?

308
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,362
There was no napping, growing up.

309
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:07,898
Once you... once you were
up, you were up, okay?

310
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,233
Not like today, where the kids are,

311
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,570
"I'm gonna go take a nap!"

312
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,041
The mother's like, "That's okay, Justin.

313
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,510
"Go take a nap.

314
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,079
"You've been up for two hours now.

315
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,850
"You're probably exhausted.

316
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,386
"So go upstairs,

317
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,021
"lay down, refresh,

318
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,324
"and come back down when
you're good and ready

319
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,661
to operate your day."

320
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,632
Not my family, okay?

321
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,201
Father been living up my ass

322
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,637
my entire life.

323
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,073
Constantly on me, questioning me.

324
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,442
I was an altar boy; he
questioned that. Right?

325
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,277
He was like, "Do they pay you

326
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,580
"for this shit at the church?

327
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,917
You makin' any scratch?"

328
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,919
I had to ask the priest for a raise.

329
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,587
I said, "Listen, we know
what's going on here.

330
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,390
"You're collecting a lot
of cash during the Mass,

331
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,125
"and nobody's getting a cut.

332
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,928
We need something, okay?"

333
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,664
The priest says, "We don't pay for Mass.

334
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,166
We pay for funerals."

335
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,333
I said, "Then put me

336
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,968
"on the funeral circuit.

337
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,439
I'll start working funerals, okay?"

338
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,008
That's what I was doing.

339
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,043
I was working three, four funerals a week,

340
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,412
during my lunch hour.

341
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,281
During my lunch hour,

342
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,283
I would have to wolf down my lunch...

343
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,884
which was impossible to do,

344
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,320
'cause I had the Italian lunch, okay?

345
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,189
My lunch had to be refrigerated

346
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,357
in the teacher's lounge, all right?

347
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,193
Or it would spoil.

348
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,797
I had to... fill out a special form...

349
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,133
...that the school wasn't responsible

350
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:52,369
if the veal piccata spoiled

351
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,104
in the refrigerator.

352
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,473
All right?

353
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,977
I had real silverware.

354
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,646
Nobody wanted to trade at lunch.

355
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,382
Everybody had, like, American... you know,

356
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,518
Ho Ho, Twinkies.

357
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,920
I-I said, "Anybody want some 'S' cookies?

358
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,122
"I got 'S' cookies.

359
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,426
"Stella D'oro?

360
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,562
Nobody wants this?"

361
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,663
And my mother would say,

362
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,599
"Make sure you dip those in coffee."

363
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,567
"Coffee?

364
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,103
"Ma, they don't serve coffee

365
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,006
"in the lunch room.

366
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,543
I'm in third grade."

367
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,548
"Well, I'll pack you some coffee, then!"

368
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,189
So I would eat the lunch,
run over to the church,

369
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,191
work a full funeral.

370
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,160
All the other kids having a ball,

371
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,197
meeting friends for life,

372
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,232
and here I am, eight years old,

373
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,970
over a corpse, with incense.

374
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:20,588
The guy never pays full price for anything.

375
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:26,597
My father, constantly looking for a deal,

376
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,233
went to the dentist.

377
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,368
Sitting down at the dentist,

378
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,104
the dentist told him,
"Listen, you need a crown.

379
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,407
It's gonna be about $800."

380
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:40,578
My father was like, "C-Crown?

381
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,583
"I could get the crown.

382
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:49,186
I got a crown guy."

383
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,823
Crown guy?

384
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,993
"Yeah, I'll bring in the part
and I'll pay you for the labor.

385
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,528
I'll pay cash."

386
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,662
What?

387
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:02,367
It's not a body shop!

388
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,241
Beautiful garden growing
up, though; beautiful.

389
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,543
We never went to the grocery store.

390
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,245
We grew it.

391
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,214
Right in the backyard. Beautiful.

392
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,649
Tomato...

393
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,618
string bean...

394
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,319
All right? Little zucchini...

395
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,287
You want some fruit?

396
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,692
You picked it off the tree!

397
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,663
But at night, we found out

398
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,164
something was going on in our garden.

399
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,599
There was a little raccoon...

400
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,635
(sniffs) ...something.

401
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,004
Something was nibbling...

402
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,306
on my father's tomatoes, okay?

403
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,407
It was a big deal.

404
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,777
We had a family meeting about it.

405
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,147
Most American families,
they'll call up Orkin.

406
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:53,150
"We'll just call Orkin.

407
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:56,286
"They'll come set up some traps.

408
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,323
"Then they'll release the
animal back into the wild

409
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,427
so it can reunite with its family."

410
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:08,098
My father's like, "Listen, we're
gonna murder this motherfucker.

411
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,470
"All right?

412
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,676
We're gonna put antifreeze on bologna."

413
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,946
What?

414
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,716
"Why, Papa? Why?"

415
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,319
"'Cause it eats the intestines, that's why!

416
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,623
"Now go get the antifreeze in the garage.

417
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,091
"We're gonna make a sandwich

418
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,794
for our friends tonight."

419
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,963
Woke up in the morning,

420
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,933
birds, squirrels, raccoons

421
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,904
murdered all over the property.

422
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,474
Neighbors coming by,
"Have you seen our cat?"

423
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:54,011
"Nah, we haven't seen shit.

424
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,515
Does it like bologna?"

425
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:04,521
We sent the message.

426
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,889
Okay?

427
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,959
Trap don't send the message.

428
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,228
Antifreeze makes it clear:

429
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,597
we ain't playing around

430
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,735
with our zucchinis. Okay?

431
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,871
Old World upbringing.

432
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:24,074
Superstitious... God, my
family's superstitious.

433
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,110
I remember, once I got my first car...

434
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,979
It was a 1984 S... uh, Celica.

435
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,615
Toyota Celica GT, shit brown.

436
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:34,351
All right?

437
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,087
Soon as I got it, my father hung a red horn

438
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,089
from the rearview mirror of the car, right?

439
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,191
Just a red horn, dangling.

440
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,060
I go, "What are you
doing? This looks like..."

441
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,062
He's like, "It's for
the malocchio, the eye.

442
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,563
So nobody gives you the eye."

443
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,132
I go, "What eye?"

444
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:50,636
"The fucking eye!"

445
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,242
Italians, Sicilians, they
believe if somebody looks at you

446
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,577
they could literally give you bad luck,

447
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,979
just on a look.

448
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,514
All right?

449
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:06,416
So now we have to have defense mechanisms.

450
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,618
Okay?

451
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,320
I dated girls who weren't even Italian.

452
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,555
They'd get into the car.

453
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,557
They're like, "Why do you have a red pepper

454
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,492
"hanging from your rearview mirror?

455
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,829
What is this all about?"

456
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:20,964
And I'd have to explain,

457
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,368
"Nah, it's for the demons, you know?

458
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:32,811
"It's so nobody looks at
you and cripples your soul.

459
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:39,917
"You don't have that in your family?

460
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,421
No?"

461
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:49,193
It was all Old World.

462
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,529
No real medication at the house.

463
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,398
I didn't know what was going on.

464
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,868
I got a fever, my mother
started cutting potatoes.

465
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,104
Right?

466
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,506
She would put slices

467
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:07,008
of potatoes with a rag...

468
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:13,350
I go, "Don't we have any Tylenol?

469
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:16,220
"Why are potatoes

470
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,724
on my head?"

471
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:21,491
I just... I grew up,

472
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,094
I was covered in Vicks.

473
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,363
We had vats

474
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,632
of Vicks, they would just...

475
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,869
rub...

476
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:35,072
just rub me.

477
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,240
They would boil water,

478
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,042
they would drop the Vicks in the water.

479
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,377
Then I would have to hover

480
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,512
over the water.

481
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,914
Right?

482
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,350
183 degrees.

483
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,018
Breathing.

484
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,087
Then a beach towel would come over my head.

485
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,356
I'm like, "I can't breathe!

486
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:54,291
I can't breathe, get it off!"

487
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,492
And they would just hold me there.

488
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,462
"Stay! Stay!"

489
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,097
"I can't...

490
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,164
"I can't breathe.

491
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,769
Don't we have Halls? We need Halls."

492
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:17,381
But as odd as this upbringing
might've... might've been,

493
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,549
they taught me passion.

494
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,985
They taught me, whatever you do in life,

495
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,088
you do it 138%.

496
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,692
You give it your all. Yeah.

497
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,995
Pride.

498
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,297
Pride in work.

499
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,165
You look around now, nobody's working.

500
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,166
The people that are working,

501
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,936
they don't want to be there.

502
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:40,337
Huh? Go to the airport.

503
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,039
The people that work at the airport?

504
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:46,543
Upset that we even showed up to fly.

505
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,280
I've never seen an angrier
group of people in my life.

506
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,549
Soon as you walk into the terminal,

507
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,921
they're tapping each other,
"Look at the, look at...

508
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,393
They brought bags. They got bags!"

509
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,533
I can't take the airport,

510
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,034
especially now, with these families.

511
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,402
Especially now, summertime,

512
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,004
the families, they're coming out like ants.

513
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,139
Ants!

514
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,507
With these little kids...

515
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,509
Enough with these little
kids on an airplane, okay?

516
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,446
One week old, with placenta
on it, going to Hawaii.

517
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:23,915
For why?

518
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,127
And what happened to
fathers in this country?

519
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,162
Their balls have been detached

520
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,931
and thrown in a purse somewhere.

521
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,266
What is going on with the fathers?

522
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,004
I'm looking at this family check in.

523
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,472
The wife is doing everything.

524
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:51,308
She's lifting the heavy bags.

525
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,076
She's doing the ticketing,

526
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,911
the boarding passes,

527
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,047
and the father's off to the side,

528
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,483
like a dunce, sitting there with his son

529
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,451
hanging off his chest

530
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,022
in some type of kangaroo sack.

531
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,328
"Honey, do you...?

532
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,996
"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to speak.

533
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,199
"I'll just sit here like an idiot.

534
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,368
"I'd breast-feed if I could.

535
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,907
You know that."

536
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,078
It's even happening with my own friends.

537
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,147
I call my buddy, I go,
"What'd you do today?"

538
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,283
"Well, I went to the
parent-teacher conference."

539
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,952
Parent-teacher conference?!

540
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,889
My father didn't even
know where the school was.

541
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:42,392
(laughter, applause)

542
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:46,096
He'd often ask me, "What grade are you in?

543
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:49,401
Where are you at?"

544
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,238
Now the buddy's got a man-cave
he can't stop talking about.

545
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,640
"Oh-ho, you got to come by.

546
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:59,376
"Got my man-cave.

547
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:02,112
"Go down there, watch the game on Sunday.

548
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:05,982
Got my beer in my little koozie."

549
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,350
Man-cave?

550
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,454
You're bragging about a man-cave?

551
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:14,956
My father had a man-cave,
it was the house.

552
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,663
(laughter, applause)

553
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,233
There was never, "Change the channel, Dad!"

554
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,301
We didn't do that.

555
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:28,038
We watched whatever he was watching.

556
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,507
We sat there, watched it, all right?

557
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:34,277
Five years old, I'm
watching 60 Minutes, going,

558
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,683
"This is terrible what's
going on in Lebanon, huh, Dad?"

559
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,290
It was time for me to check in, right?

560
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,259
Now, the check-in process at the airport,

561
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,594
they don't want to look at you.

562
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:51,628
Head down, right?

563
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,662
No smile, nothing.

564
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,298
I feel like I'm working, right?

565
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,434
I feel like I work at United.

566
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,536
"Hi! How ya doing?"

567
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,338
Right?

568
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,273
The only time they get happy is

569
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,208
when the bag goes over
the weight allowance.

570
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,010
They love telling you,

571
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:11,281
"You're gonna owe extra on this bag."

572
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,316
And you know it's heavy.

573
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,551
When you're packing it at
home, you tell your wife,

574
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,652
"We're never gonna make it with the..."

575
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:16,586
"It's okay."

576
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,158
"Okay, I'll pack it, huh?"

577
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,995
So heavy, right?

578
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,463
You put it up there.

579
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:29,032
And you know it's heavy, so you
kind of try and release it...

580
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,635
You do that, like, kind of soft release.

581
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:34,171
Like that's gonna take...

582
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,975
take weight off the bag.

583
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:42,946
And her mood changes, she's like, "Ooh...

584
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,616
(feminine voice): "I'm sorry.

585
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,152
"Your bag is two pounds over.

586
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:53,390
You're gonna have to take
two pounds out of your bag."

587
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:57,627
Now, like an idiot, I've
got to open up my bag

588
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,598
in front of 187 people.

589
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,536
I don't know what two pounds is.

590
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:11,141
I'm taking out a boot,
a sock, toothpaste...

591
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:14,211
"Is this two pounds?

592
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:17,614
"Does anybody know what two pounds is?

593
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:21,184
They're gonna charge me an extra $8,000."

594
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:24,054
(laughing)

595
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,289
"You think the boot's a half a pound?"

596
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:30,729
I mean, I go, "Where do
you want me to put this?"

597
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,065
She's like, "Put that in your carry-on."

598
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,534
I said, "It's still going on the plane!"

599
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,604
(laughter)

600
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,872
Wha... What does it matter...

601
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,975
if it's on top or underneath?

602
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,610
They guy behind me's 500 pounds.

603
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,045
That doesn't matter?

604
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,382
(laughter, applause, cheering)

605
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,385
What's...?

606
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,623
My sock is gonna take the
plane into the Pacific,

607
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:04,261
but you prepared for this type of weight?

608
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:08,198
It's a scam.

609
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,469
Every part of that airport bothers me.

610
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:16,439
The TSA... the security checkpoint.

611
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,875
This is what's guarding our country?

612
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:24,180
Have you seen what's in
the blue shirts at O'Hare?

613
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,984
Do you feel safe with
this type of security?

614
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:32,389
I've been all over the world...
Egypt, Lebanon, Beirut...

615
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,556
I've been all over.

616
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,359
The security in their
airports... unbelievable.

617
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,595
All military, neat, hats,

618
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,931
machine guns...

619
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,436
(laughter)

620
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:54,110
Have you seen our first line of defense?

621
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,513
Y-You see the first guy they send out...

622
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:59,616
"Take out your laptop!"

623
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:02,153
(laughter)

624
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:10,128
"Your liquids, your creams, your gels..."

625
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:19,437
(laughter)

626
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,276
And can we leave the shoes on?

627
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,411
Have you seen people's...

628
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,914
Have you seen people's feet...?

629
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,283
(laughter)

630
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,918
Guy took his shoe off,

631
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,220
looked like he had a
machete hanging off his toe.

632
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:38,355
I swear to God.

633
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:41,658
Like he could cut...

634
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,363
provolone...

635
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,665
just a thin...

636
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,334
slice...

637
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,973
of provolone.

638
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,943
How does your toenail get to this point?

639
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,411
Don't you glance down and go,

640
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,513
"Shit, I got to cut this

641
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,316
before it starts coming through my shoes"?

642
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,285
(laughter, applause)

643
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:13,524
These are basic skill sets.

644
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,062
But I got a fear of flying.

645
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:22,899
My biggest fear... I'm
gonna die in a crash, right?

646
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,435
What, this Malaysia thing's freaked me out.

647
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:26,970
Two months ago, this thing went down.

648
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,271
Nobody could see it, right?

649
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,305
Nobody could find it.

650
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,373
Where is this damn thing?

651
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,575
They tell me before I fly,

652
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:36,012
"Your seat could be used
as a floatation device."

653
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,415
Where are these seats?

654
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:41,951
They can't find 283 seats
floating in the ocean?

655
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,053
Where did the seats go?

656
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,256
What do you do, though?

657
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,125
You're on a plane, it loses control,

658
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,528
and you start heading for the ocean, right?

659
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,396
You're on the plane.

660
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,231
Oxygen comes down.

661
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,566
People start breathing.

662
00:33:56,568 --> 00:34:00,336
(inhales, exhales loudly)

663
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,039
Me? I'm hanging myself.

664
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,109
(laughter)

665
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:08,878
Gone!

666
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,881
(laughter, applause)

667
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:16,219
You think I'm hitting the
water at 6,000 miles per hour?

668
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,620
What does that feel like?

669
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:21,090
I'll take the hanging, okay?

670
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,093
I'll take the hanging.

671
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,363
But knowing my luck, I'd hang myself,

672
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,365
the pilot would regain control.

673
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,867
(laughter)

674
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,136
And I'd be the only idiot hanging

675
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:37,607
for seven hours on the way to Beijing.

676
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,275
With people ringing the call button,

677
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,110
"Do you want to get him down?

678
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:44,280
"He keeps swinging into my area.

679
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:48,218
"I'm trying to eat my
cashews and watch Frozen.

680
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,086
"Could you unwind him?

681
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:54,459
He keeps hitting my tray."

682
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,163
So, I got this upbringing,

683
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:03,933
I got this weird way of
looking at the world, right?

684
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,302
Finally found someone
who could deal with me.

685
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,905
I got married last year,
and I'm happier than shit.

686
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,173
I gotta tell ya.

687
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:14,410
(applause, whooping)

688
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,914
My wife is an angel, okay?

689
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,315
A complete angel.

690
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,886
T-The total opposite of me, okay?

691
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:25,221
Loves people.

692
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:28,391
Loves people, she's from the South.

693
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:29,893
She's always smiling.

694
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,896
She's like a dog, she likes to play.

695
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:35,999
She likes to come out and play.

696
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,434
I'm like a cat, I love to hide, right?

697
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:42,071
(laughter)

698
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,974
Her friends come over,
they're, like, comfortable.

699
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,342
Right?

700
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:50,413
I like people at the house,
but, like, her friends stay long.

701
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,081
Like, my friends...

702
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,183
uh, you know, my friends,
after the game, they're gone.

703
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,319
Hers? They're like, "Oh-oh,
I'll just sleep here."

704
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,987
"No. No, you're not."

705
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:02,091
(laughter)

706
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:05,929
Her friends, like, open the refrigerator.

707
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,363
I'm sorry, I didn't grow up that way.

708
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:11,367
You don't open anybody else's refrigerator.

709
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,002
Right?

710
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,170
(applause)

711
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,906
The refrigerator and the master bedroom...

712
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,042
you don't, you don't look at.

713
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,177
You ever get a tour of somebody's house?

714
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,512
"This is the master."

715
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,647
And you're like, "Oh, okay."

716
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,483
You don't go in there and go,
"Oh, do... this where you fuck?

717
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,052
You fuck here?"

718
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:30,386
(laughter)

719
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,188
"Right here?"

720
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,389
No!

721
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,891
You just skip it, and you
move on to the baby's room.

722
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,266
No, a friend came over the other night.

723
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:44,300
She comes right in.

724
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,635
She goes in there.

725
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,170
She starts shopping...

726
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:49,973
like it's Jewel, right?

727
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,207
Took out a bowl of cherries.

728
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,142
Beautiful cherries... I
just bought them, right?

729
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,510
I didn't even get to taste them.

730
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,146
What I like to do is, I like
to take out the cherries,

731
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,983
put them in a separate
bowl, give them a nice wash,

732
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:03,119
and slip those in the refrigerator, right?

733
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,388
This one takes out the cherries.

734
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,623
She's eating the cherries,

735
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,491
and we're, she's talking to me and my wife.

736
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:11,160
Now, it's all over my face.

737
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,162
I can't hide it, all right?

738
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,565
I'm sitting there, I go, "I-I
got to go to the bathroom."

739
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,633
Now I go hide.

740
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,568
I go... Like a cat, I go somewhere else.

741
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,136
And my wife has to come get me.

742
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:22,271
She's like, "Wha...?
Would you come out here?"

743
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,507
I go, "She's eating the cherries."

744
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:27,877
(laughter, applause)

745
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:32,379
How does she know I'm not
making a cherry pie with that?

746
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,054
But that's why I fell in love with my wife.

747
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:39,555
Totally different.

748
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,957
I'll come home,

749
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,459
and the pizza delivery
guy will be in the house,

750
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:47,263
while my wife goes to our secret stash...

751
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,631
and pays him.

752
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:53,369
I go, "Why is the delivery
guy in our kitchen?"

753
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,472
(laughter)

754
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,175
I didn't grow up with delivery people.

755
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,746
I was the delivery person.

756
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:08,184
My father would order a
pizza in January, right?

757
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,586
38 below outside.

758
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,989
And he would tell me,
"Uh, go get the pizza.

759
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,525
"It's gonna be ready in 30 minutes.

760
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,927
I just ordered the pizza."

761
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,562
I go, "They got delivery.

762
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,197
Why don't you just...?"

763
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,099
"I'm gonna pay delivery when I got you?

764
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,567
Go get the pizza..."

765
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,972
(laughter, applause)

766
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,612
But the customer service, right?

767
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,248
I-I run into it a lot,
the customer service,

768
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,984
'cause I handle, in my
house, all the hook-ups...

769
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,619
Internet, whatever we need.

770
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,288
Gas, I do all that.

771
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,590
Got on the phone with
the cable people, right?

772
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:51,294
I don't know if you ever try
to hook up cable over the phone

773
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,628
with these people?

774
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,397
There's a pre-recorded message that says,

775
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:57,500
"We're gonna monitor the
call for quality assurance."

776
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,335
Right?

777
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,105
So, as soon as I get a
live operator, I tell them,

778
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:06,976
"Just so you know, I'm recording
the call on my end, too, okay?

779
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:09,078
"You got me, I got you.

780
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,649
Behave. Behave."

781
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,286
So the next morning, I
come down for breakfast,

782
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,622
I got a guy in my yard already.

783
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,124
Cable guy's in the yard already.

784
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,625
My wife is like, "What is he doing?"

785
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:23,593
I go, "I don't know."

786
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:25,161
Now, I handle that.

787
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:26,662
That's another thing
you handle as a husband.

788
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,965
You got a guy in your
yard, you take care of that.

789
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,032
You don't send your wife.

790
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,968
(grunting): "Go... go see.

791
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,603
Go out there."

792
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,873
(laughter)

793
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:41,410
As a husband, you have to handle stuff.

794
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,946
You make reservations to a restaurant,

795
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,615
as the man, you check in.

796
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:46,949
You go right up to the...

797
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:50,286
"I got a two Maniscalco
tonight, you got that?"

798
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,921
You don't send your wife.

799
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:53,356
I see it all the time.

800
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:54,490
Wives go up...

801
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,625
(feminine voice): "Hi, we're here.

802
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,660
"Two for, uh, Johnson.

803
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:58,928
"It's ready?

804
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,962
"Honey? You want to...

805
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,964
"It's ready, honey!

806
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,432
You want to come up here?!"

807
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,704
(laughter)

808
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,443
Handle it.

809
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,012
So, I handle the cable guy.

810
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,014
I come outside in the yard.

811
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,249
I go, "Hey, what's going
on? What are you doing?"

812
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,617
(with accent): "Oh, nah, I can't do it!

813
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,153
"I can't do it!

814
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,988
"I can't get at the...

815
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,491
the cable, I can't get it."

816
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,193
What?!

817
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,461
(laughter)

818
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:35,131
You don't come to the
door, introduce yourself...

819
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:38,102
How'd you get back here?

820
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:42,004
(with accent): "I can't do
it. I gotta take a break."

821
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,573
Break? You didn't do nothing.

822
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:46,142
(laughter)

823
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,044
He's telling me he can't hook the cable up

824
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:50,413
because the cable's in my neighbor's yard.

825
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:53,049
I gotta ask my neighbor if it's okay

826
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,317
for him to go get the cable.

827
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,519
I go, "Julio, you broke into my yard..."

828
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:57,987
(laughter)

829
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:00,323
"...can't you just break into his?

830
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:01,490
"It's your cable.

831
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,159
Go get the damn thing."

832
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,162
(with accent): "I can't do it."

833
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:13,202
So me and Julio go over to my neighbor.

834
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,071
I just moved into the neighborhood.

835
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:16,239
I don't even know the guy.

836
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:18,875
I knock on the door,
the guy came to the door,

837
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,877
had a full medical mask on.

838
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:23,179
(laughter)

839
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:27,116
If you have a medical mask
on, and you answer the door,

840
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:30,620
that's gotta be the first
thing out of your mouth, okay?

841
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:32,588
Why you got this damn thing on.

842
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,123
(laughter)

843
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,626
I come to my door, with a
medical mask, I take it down:

844
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:39,161
"Listen, doing some painting in the garage,

845
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,531
gets into my lungs,
that's why I got the mask."

846
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,101
This guy, nothing on the mask.

847
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:48,204
Started talking through the mask.

848
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:50,039
He's, like, "What's going on?"

849
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,376
I go, "No, no, no...
what's going on in here?"

850
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:57,246
(laughter, applause)

851
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,248
I just bought the joint next door.

852
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,883
Do I gotta put it up for sale?

853
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:04,120
Why the hell do you got a medical mask on,

854
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:06,422
on a Monday morning, okay?

855
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,057
Let's get into that.

856
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,525
I'm gonna send Julio in your yard.

857
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,128
Is he gonna come out with no head?

858
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,734
What are you doing with the mask?

859
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,503
I live in the negative.

860
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:22,505
Live in the negative.

861
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:25,541
My wife is in the positive, okay?

862
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,011
Came back to our house, I said,
"Put the 'for sale' sign up.

863
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,315
There's a guy with a medical
mask living next door."

864
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:34,350
(laughter)

865
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:37,253
She's, like, "Maybe he
has a respiratory problem

866
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,654
and that's why he has the mask."

867
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:42,892
I go, "Or maybe he's
got 16 bodies in drums,

868
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,628
"in formaldehyde, in his basement.

869
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,432
Put the sign up, we're moving."

870
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:51,902
(laughter, applause)

871
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:58,307
You can't get any customer
service with the cable.

872
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,877
Here, I went to Chipotle couple weeks ago.

873
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:06,315
Love Chipotle... they make a
really nice burrito over there.

874
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:10,553
It's so terrific, the
employees can't stop eating it.

875
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:12,888
The employees are never working.

876
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,458
They're always in the dining room eating.

877
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,926
Ever walk in there?

878
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,928
I'm, like, "Where are the workers?"

879
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,597
The only guy behind there
is the guy cutting chicken,

880
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,865
just looking at you.

881
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:25,402
(laughter)

882
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:35,079
Right? He's not trained
on burrito building.

883
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,584
And I'm watching the people order...

884
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:44,120
I mean, there's a sneeze
glass there, right?

885
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:47,323
But people always hook
the arm over the glass:

886
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:51,060
"I'll have corn; I'll have more corn..."

887
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:54,330
Just say, "corn."

888
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:55,965
It's not soundproof.

889
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,501
It goes right over the glass.

890
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:02,538
Get your claw out of the salsa.

891
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,575
(laughter)

892
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:10,179
And nobody talks to the Chipotle people.

893
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:12,515
There's no conversation that happens.

894
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:16,485
They listen to the same shit
eight hours a day, right?

895
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,953
Just, "steak...

896
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,055
"beans...

897
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:21,190
cheese..." gone!

898
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:23,027
I never seen anything like this.

899
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,097
It's like you're not even...

900
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:31,067
It's like a robot.

901
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:32,334
"Chicken...

902
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,402
"peppers...

903
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,171
lettuce..."

904
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,907
(laughter)

905
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:38,908
And the employees...

906
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,079
(laughter, applause)

907
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,522
All... day... long.

908
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,126
(applause)

909
00:44:57,128 --> 00:45:02,465
And God forbid if you ask
for guacamole... oh, my God...

910
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:05,968
the whole store goes into a panic attack.

911
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,504
They don't even know how to
tell you it's extra money, right?

912
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:09,638
(laughter)

913
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,240
You're, like, "Put some guac on that...?"

914
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:12,943
"Uh..."

915
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,180
"It's $1.80 extra.

916
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,949
Is that o... is that okay?"

917
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,251
Yeah... it's okay.

918
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,722
(laughter)

919
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,193
Most stressful job at Chipotle

920
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,429
has to be wrapping
these damn things, right?

921
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:36,432
By the time the wrapper gets it,

922
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:39,535
his employees have populated

923
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:42,338
the burrito with so much ingredients,

924
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,509
the guy can't even find the tortilla.

925
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,346
He starts sweating.

926
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:53,015
He's, like, "How am I
gonna wrap this damn thing?"

927
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:54,550
Right? It's a workout.

928
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:56,152
He's gotta get down,

929
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,154
gotta use some quads,

930
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:00,623
a little core, start...

931
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,892
tucking and fold...

932
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:05,261
tuck and fold.

933
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,363
(laughter)

934
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:11,634
It took me 23 minutes to get a
burrito out of this place, huh?

935
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:16,539
I felt, at the end of this,
Chipotle owed me something.

936
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:20,376
So I asked for a water; I
filled it up with Coca-Cola.

937
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:21,310
Huh?

938
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:22,945
(applause, laughter)

939
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,180
Least I could do.

940
00:46:24,182 --> 00:46:26,916
23 minutes in line, I go
to the Coca-Cola machine,

941
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:29,451
and I stare at them
while I fill, like this.

942
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:34,323
(laughter)

943
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:37,426
Coca-Cola in the see-through
glass... what are you gonna do?

944
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:40,030
What are you gonna do about it?

945
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,468
It's everywhere you go.

946
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,039
Went to Best Buy looking for a TV.

947
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,373
Salesman came out.

948
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,042
He had one these eyeballs,

949
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:56,111
one of these fucked-up eyeballs,
looking into the kitchen area.

950
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,913
(laughter)

951
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,082
Listen, if you got a fucked-up
eyeball, and you're in sales,

952
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:02,251
you gotta tell me that
right off the bat, okay?

953
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:04,019
You have to open with that:

954
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:08,490
"Listen, I know my eyeball's
looking into 'DVDs' right now."

955
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,026
And I could say, "Okay,
what eyeball can I trust?

956
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,328
Where do I need to be?"

957
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,462
(laughter, applause)

958
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,297
"What eyeball do you think is

959
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,499
"gonna start looking at the Samsung?

960
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,035
"Tell me; I'm confused.

961
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,873
I need an eyeball."

962
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:30,112
But that's why I got my wife.

963
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:32,381
My wife chills me out, all right?

964
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:35,117
She's from the South, she's
Spanish, she's Jewish...

965
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,187
who knew these people even existed, man?

966
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,990
Spanish Jew from the South.

967
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:43,359
I didn't even think the
Jews went down there.

968
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,430
(laughter, applause)

969
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:52,001
But Italians and Jews...
very similar, you know?

970
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:56,639
People say "same corporation,
different division," all right?

971
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:59,875
We get along... there's
an obvious, you know,

972
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,277
thing with the religion.

973
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,946
I went to my first Passover dinner.

974
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:06,048
She's, like, "My mother's
gonna have Passover."

975
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,017
"Okay, we'll go to the dinner."

976
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,953
7:30, we sit down at her mother's house.

977
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:13,422
I'm starving, right?

978
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,524
Starving.

979
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,426
They start passing out pamphlets,

980
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,228
like, reading material...

981
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,665
(laughter)

982
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:25,034
I'm, like, "What's goingn?
What are we doing here?

983
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:26,135
What's with the...?"

984
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:28,270
She's, like, "No, we read for two hours."

985
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,905
Two hours?!

986
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,874
(laughter, applause)

987
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:33,309
I said, "Listen, I'm Italian.

988
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,611
"As soon as I sit at a
table, I gotta have bread

989
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,880
within 15 seconds of
sitting down, all right?"

990
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:40,616
(laughter, applause, whooping)

991
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:45,421
"I need something to do with
my right hand, I need a...

992
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,122
"Is there some oil coming out?

993
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,591
"We got oil? I need oil. Now.

994
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,095
Hungry."

995
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,197
And the food they start bringing out?

996
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,168
Oh, God... terrible, terrible food.

997
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,905
Jews have no idea what the hell
they're doing in the kitchen.

998
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:05,441
These people have no cuisine.

999
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,310
Celery, crackers, jam?

1000
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:09,378
I'm, like, what is...?

1001
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,913
We're losing... people are leaving.

1002
00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:12,247
We need food.

1003
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,818
(laughter, applause)

1004
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,189
After breakfast, they fall apart, the Jews.

1005
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:21,957
After a bagel, cream cheese, lox...

1006
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:22,958
where they going?

1007
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,992
They got nothin'.

1008
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,128
The have nothing.

1009
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,063
Has anybody ever said to you,

1010
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:31,266
"We went to this Jewish
restaurant last night..."

1011
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,438
(laughter, applause)

1012
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,575
"The gefilte... amazing!"

1013
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:47,082
I respect the Jews, but
let's just have the Italians

1014
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,485
cater the Passover meal, all right?

1015
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,220
Come on!

1016
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:55,090
(laughter, applause, cheering, whistling)

1017
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,393
I could read for a couple of hours

1018
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:59,328
with some meatballs on the table.

1019
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,731
(grunting)

1020
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,535
(laughter)

1021
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,509
When I first met my
wife, I had some secrets.

1022
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,611
Right? I couldn't share 'em.

1023
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,079
Everybody's got a secret in the room.

1024
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:20,215
Everybody... everybody here has a secret.

1025
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,216
(woman laughs)

1026
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:22,351
Especially that lady.

1027
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:25,923
(laughter, applause)

1028
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,427
My secret? I couldn't digest dairy, okay?

1029
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:33,529
Something you can't share,
first month of dating.

1030
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,130
You can't be out to dinner and go,

1031
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,432
"Listen, I can't have any dessert,

1032
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:38,300
or I'm gonna shit the
bed tonight, all right?"

1033
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,871
(applause, laughter)

1034
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,208
No, you just eat the dessert

1035
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,377
and you deal with the
consequences later on.

1036
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,447
All right?

1037
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,119
Went back to her place,
started to watch a movie.

1038
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,988
Halfway through the movie,

1039
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,926
the dairy starts dancing, right?

1040
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,429
I had to ask her, real cool...
this is in the beginning,

1041
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,433
where you have to be
cool with everything...

1042
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,034
You're, like, "Listen, you got a bathroom

1043
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:13,502
or something like that?"

1044
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:15,973
(laughter)

1045
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,607
"I don't know why... you got a bathroom

1046
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,275
"or something like that, or something?

1047
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:24,279
Something I could u...
something I could use?"

1048
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,515
Hoping she would say, "Yeah,
it's down the hall to the right,

1049
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:28,417
and then you go outside."

1050
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,454
(laughter)

1051
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,389
She's, like, "No, it's
just around the corner.

1052
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,024
You want me to pause the movie?"

1053
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,493
I said, "No, actually, could you, could you

1054
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:39,394
turn it up a little bit? I want to..."

1055
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,429
(applause, laughter)

1056
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,464
"Turn it up.

1057
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:45,501
I want to hear the
acoustics in the bathroom."

1058
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:48,103
So I would lock the door,

1059
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,205
I would put the water on in the bathroom.

1060
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,808
Get some noise going.

1061
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,545
I later told her, right?

1062
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,180
I said, "Yeah, I got a dairy problem."

1063
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:00,015
She's, like, "Dairy? I thought you had OCD.

1064
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:03,118
I thought you were constantly
washing your hands."

1065
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,120
(laughter)

1066
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,390
"Washing my hands? I was
farting into your towels."

1067
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:12,529
(applause, laughter)

1068
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:19,167
Anything to muffle the sound, just...

1069
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,435
(imitates fart)

1070
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,438
Oh, God, I hope she doesn't
wash her face with that.

1071
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,609
(applause, laughter)

1072
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:28,644
God, I can't go back out there.

1073
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,479
It's rancid.

1074
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,014
It's so rancid.

1075
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:34,785
(laughter)

1076
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,458
But it's fun.

1077
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,927
It's fun being married,

1078
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:48,630
sharing my life with a beautiful woman.

1079
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,567
All my friends got married
when they were real, real young.

1080
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:54,303
In their early 20s, they
all started families,

1081
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:55,504
start popping out kids.

1082
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:59,107
I was the last guy to
get married, all right?

1083
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,610
So they were excited
for the bachelor party.

1084
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:04,112
You know, married guys with kids,

1085
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,348
they're looking for a prison break, right?

1086
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,116
(laughter)

1087
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:11,086
The phone started ringing off the hook.

1088
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:12,521
"We gotta plan your bachelor party."

1089
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,389
My buddies say, "We gotta
plan your bachelor party,

1090
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:18,193
or I'm gonna fake my own
death soon, all right?"

1091
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,529
(laughter)

1092
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:23,632
"I'm six weeks away...

1093
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:26,034
"from starting a fruit stand in Nicaragua.

1094
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,637
I gotta... I gotta get out."

1095
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:31,041
(laughter)

1096
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,015
So my buddies, they plan a Miami weekend.

1097
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:41,984
Go to Miami for the weekend.

1098
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:43,585
It happened to be urban weekend.

1099
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:46,288
It was Black Weekend in Miami.

1100
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:51,128
So we looked like four
mozzarella sticks at the pool.

1101
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:56,164
My friends still think
they're in their 20s.

1102
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,266
My buddy's like, "Let's go to the pool.

1103
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,369
Let's start talking to some chicks."

1104
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,536
I'm like, "Steve?

1105
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:04,139
You have tits."

1106
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:07,511
(crowd laughs, claps)

1107
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,649
"It's over, Steven.

1108
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,386
"You have a C-cup

1109
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:19,921
"with a beautiful areola.

1110
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,657
"No one's looking

1111
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:25,428
for that, Steven."

1112
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,635
But when you're in your 40s

1113
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,137
and you... go on a vacation,

1114
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,972
a lot different than when you're 20.

1115
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:38,306
When you're 20, you don't even carry

1116
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,509
a toiletry bag.

1117
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:42,544
Everything's loose.

1118
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:45,080
Just gel, hair spray,

1119
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:46,915
cologne.

1120
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,184
Just lives with your clothes.

1121
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:50,452
When you're 40,

1122
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,455
the toiletry bag becomes the focus

1123
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,891
of the trip.

1124
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:58,360
It's so big, when you unpack,

1125
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:01,496
you got to hang it.

1126
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,932
You hang it on the back of the door.

1127
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,600
You unzip it and it just

1128
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:08,904
unfolds.

1129
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:10,539
No more hair spray.

1130
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,240
There's no more gel.

1131
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,077
Nobody's got hair.

1132
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,312
It's Propecia.

1133
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,348
Antidepressants.

1134
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,119
Stool softener.

1135
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,489
A therapy rubber band.

1136
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,224
My buddy had a bad shoulder.

1137
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:31,626
He brought his therapy rubber bands.

1138
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,229
He had to hook them up to the door.

1139
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,264
And he had to work out his shoulder

1140
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,802
before we went out.

1141
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,048
But we talked a lot on our trip.

1142
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:56,218
My buddy's, uh, ex-military.

1143
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,587
Do we have any, uh,
active-active military here?

1144
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:00,055
Any military people?

1145
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,656
Yeah? Where at? Front? U-Up top?

1146
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:02,924
Marine?

1147
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,526
- (crowd cheering)
- Yeah?

1148
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,528
All right, give it up. Give it up for the,

1149
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,997
for the United States military.

1150
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:11,501
Love the military.

1151
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,003
My buddy's got me

1152
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:17,005
into so many military-type shows.

1153
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:18,573
I can't stop watching this stuff.

1154
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:19,975
It's all I do.

1155
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,877
I go home after my shows.

1156
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:22,644
I watch SEALs,

1157
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:25,614
Special Ops, Rangers,

1158
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:27,415
documentaries.

1159
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,018
The bin Laden thing fascinated me.

1160
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,153
I wish I was on the hit.

1161
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:33,155
I wish I was there for that.

1162
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:35,290
Just on a SEAL's back.

1163
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:37,794
Just like, "Where we go?"

1164
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,031
"We found him?

1165
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:45,035
You got to be kidding me!"

1166
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:49,971
Just how they conducted that raid

1167
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,339
with night goggles...

1168
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,074
vision...

1169
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,944
helicopters right over the house...

1170
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:58,448
3:00 a.m., Pakistan.

1171
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,349
One of the, uh, one of the helicopters

1172
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,051
fell out of the sky.

1173
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:04,486
Guys were still in the air.

1174
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:05,987
They looked at it, said, "Fuck it.

1175
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,156
We'll still do it. We're here, right?"

1176
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:11,961
They start coming out of the helicop...

1177
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,440
They surround the house.

1178
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,109
Bin Laden's people didn't
know what was going on.

1179
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:32,180
They hadn't had company in 13 years.

1180
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,883
Now you got United States military

1181
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:37,052
all over the property.

1182
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:38,620
One guy came out of his bedroom

1183
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,655
in his underwear, eating some hummus.

1184
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,992
"What is go...?" (pops)

1185
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:49,132
(crowd cheering)

1186
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:02,177
They find bin Laden in his bedroom.

1187
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:05,981
Three girlfriends, a couple of wives.

1188
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,083
How does that happen?

1189
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,051
How... What's the upside

1190
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:13,188
on being married to bin Laden?

1191
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:16,358
Where do you meet him?

1192
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,461
This guy didn't have a table at a nightclub

1193
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:21,765
in Pakistan.

1194
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,402
Right? Girls, they walk in.

1195
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:28,970
"Oh, my... Binny, Binny's here!

1196
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,238
"Hi, Binny!

1197
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,742
Hi..."

1198
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,882
My buddy...

1199
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:42,250
being ex-military, he's ready

1200
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,019
for the end of the world, this guy.

1201
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,521
This guy has got a lot
of weapons at the house.

1202
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,157
Got a compound bow and arrow.

1203
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,359
Now, if you don't know
anything about a compound bow?

1204
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,362
The arrow travels at
about 300 yards per second.

1205
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:58,300
Can take out a giraffe, no problem.

1206
00:58:58,302 --> 00:58:59,868
He's got this thing in the house.

1207
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,870
I go, "John, what the
hell you got this in the...

1208
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,039
in the house for?"

1209
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,409
He's like, "You kidding me?

1210
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:12,013
It's for home invasion."

1211
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,149
"Home invasion"?

1212
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:18,019
Could you imagine the poor bastard

1213
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:21,323
that breaks into my buddy's house?

1214
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:24,092
As a burglar, you can't even prepare

1215
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:27,395
for something like that.

1216
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,431
The burglar thinks nobody's home.

1217
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:33,435
He comes through a kitchen window.

1218
00:59:33,437 --> 00:59:35,403
My buddy hears him.

1219
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,508
He gets out his bow and arrow.

1220
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,955
The burglar's in the living room.

1221
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,957
He suspects nothing.

1222
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,493
He's stealing valuables.

1223
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:00,228
Then out of nowhere...

1224
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,098
(whooshes)

1225
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:10,740
Do you know the mindfuck on this?

1226
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,910
The burglar has to process...

1227
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,715
"I got an arrow hanging
out of my chest right now."

1228
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,419
Did I break into an Apache's home?

1229
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:27,022
Are there Indians here?

1230
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:30,592
Is this a casino?

1231
01:00:30,594 --> 01:00:32,193
You guys are great. Thank you so much

1232
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,496
- for coming out.
- (crowd cheering)

1233
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:37,000
God bless you.

1234
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,738
Thank you.

1235
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,940
Thank you.

1236
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:48,144
So nice.

1237
