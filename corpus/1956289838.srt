2
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,072
I have to run home and change.

3
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,198
Let's just not go.

4
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:09,310
I'm leaving now.

5
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:12,114
Five minutes, five more minutes.

6
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:13,230
Sssshhh!

7
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:15,555
They know you're here.

8
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:49,239
Don't go back to sleep.

9
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:51,035
I won't.

10
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:32,511
<i>Selamat pagi</i>.

11
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:33,795
<i>Pagi</i>.

12
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:31,956
You know what Shakespeare said about punctuality?

13
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:38,029
Better three hours too early, than one minute too late.

14
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:41,754
My hand was on the door on time.

15
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:00,870
So here we are, at the end of it all

16
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:04,197
I've done what I can for you, now you have to go out and think on your own

17
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:06,113
time to fly or die.

18
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:08,310
Still defending Aristóteles, Mr. Zimit?

19
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:13,357
Up or down. 0 or 1. True or false. Fly or die.

20
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,709
You're a slave to binary logic, you know that?

21
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,478
Logic, being?

22
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,555
The science of reason.

23
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:19,875
Or more precisely?

24
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:21,353
The power of the mind to form judgment

25
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,358
based on strict principles of validity.

26
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:24,630
Logic...

27
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:29,995
remains after 10,000 years of the human experience,

28
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:32,154
the best way to get through the day.

29
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:34,072
Though it still doesn't do much for you at night.

30
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:37,353
Oh, right. I read a great line in bed last night.

31
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,669
I was going to mention this.

32
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:42,471
"Philosophy is to real life, as masturbation is to sex."

33
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:46,310
At least you're reading.

34
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:47,873
That brings up an interesting point, though

35
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:51,072
whether philosophy makes any difference to help people actually live.

36
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:53,512
I mean, Mr. Zimit, would you say that most people

37
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,630
who never study philosophy do okay in life?

38
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,914
I couldn't give a monkey's, whether most people do okay in life.

39
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:01,875
I mean, according to whose vapid credo is

40
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:05,277
"doing okay" the definition of a meaningful existence?

41
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,630
And if we really want to talk about most people...

42
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,671
Most people are waddling through their days

43
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:14,437
stuffing cheese puffs down their gullets.

44
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:15,834
Most people are so mush-brained...

45
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,349
they have no hope of solving the intricate problems...

46
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,551
they come up against as adult human beings.

47
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:23,315
Most people by the age of 40 have turned into blubbering nutters

48
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,200
at least on the inside.

49
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,392
Fortunately, you're not "most people".

50
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:33,151
So for you, there's a chance to

51
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,873
clear apart through the muck of the world

52
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:37,993
and see ahead to the deep truth of things.

53
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,272
Which is why we spent the last year

54
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:43,873
strengthening your minds with the same tools

55
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:46,560
used by some of the best brains in history:

56
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:52,709
Descartes, Newton, Wittgenstein.
To explore in the imagination

57
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:55,993
what they were constrained from exploring in the physical world.

58
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:00,031
Do we feel like recapping some of our favorite thought experiments?

59
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,034
The infinite monkey theorem.

60
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:04,115
The infinite monkey theorem...

61
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:07,596
the classic way to wrap your head around the concept of "infinity".

62
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:11,151
Which is so endless that if you put a monkey at a typewriter

63
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:12,834
and let him bang away at it forever,

64
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:18,433
he'll eventually, almost surely completely randomly
type out the entire play of Hamlet, word for word.

65
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:21,998
I mean, the odds are nano-scale that he's
gonna hit all the rights keys in a row

66
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:25,113
on any given day, but over the stretch of eternity

67
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:26,880
across time, without any limit

68
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,228
every event has some

69
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,238
actual mathematical probability of really happening.

70
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:34,551
Who else?

71
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:35,794
I like the trolley problem.

72
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:38,990
An out-of-control trolley car is speeding towards five people

73
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,110
tied to a track.

74
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:41,834
But, you can pull a lever

75
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:44,358
and make the trolley swerve into another track

76
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:47,877
where only one person is going to get run down.

77
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:54,870
Should you do it?

78
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:56,991
If you're being utilitarian about it, you can argue

79
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:59,839
that you did the right thing letting one person die to save five.

80
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:01,360
But what if the situation was slightly different?

81
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,435
This time there's no lever to make the trolley swerve

82
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:07,478
but there's an obese man standing next to the track

83
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,432
and you calculate that he weighs just enough

84
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:10,550
to derail the trolley.

85
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,029
Do you push him in front of it?

86
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:19,589
Absolutely not!

87
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:21,632
How's it less acceptable than the first version?

88
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:24,036
You're still sacrificing one person to save five.

89
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,195
They're both wrong.

90
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:29,197
Don't be fooled by the arithmetic

91
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,276
It's murder, either way.

92
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:34,630
Anyone else?

93
00:07:34,748 --> 00:07:36,238
The ignorant bliss paradox.

94
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,200
You're hanging off the highest tower in Jakarta.

95
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:42,597
It's a thousand foot drop to your death

96
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,711
so you call your three best friends for help.

97
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:47,995
They rush out to save you

98
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:52,680
but they're afraid if they try to
pull you up, they might be yanked over themselves.

99
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:53,789
So they step back.

100
00:07:57,948 --> 00:08:03,091
You fall...

101
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,491
and live.

102
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:07,360
But do you wish you never tested your friends in the first place?

103
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:09,113
Since now you know you can't count on them

104
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:10,957
when it's a matter of life or death.

105
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:14,072
Would it be better if you stayed ignorant of what they're truly good for

106
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:15,793
and gone on being friends forever?

107
00:08:15,988 --> 00:08:17,036
I'd wanna know the truth

108
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,832
cut your losses, and walk on. You'll find other friends.

109
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:22,837
You'll fall off other towers.

110
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,315
The good news is:

111
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:26,918
although we're about to part ways,

112
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,795
not one of you leaves here, lacking the credentials to thrive in the world.

113
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:37,270
You're all well-equipped, to push on to university

114
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:40,913
and become happy, energetic members

115
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,590
of a post-industrial 21st century society.

116
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:54,029
On the other hand: what if that society ceases to exist?

117
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:57,999
What if your credentials don't mean what you expected...

118
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:01,870
and your expectations mean nothing at all?

119
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:04,399
I know it's hard to conceive of everything

120
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:07,910
you've based your plans on being
wiped away, at a single stroke

121
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:11,438
but it's happened before and it can happen again.

122
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,799
So let's say things do change.

123
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:22,630
I propose one last <i>Gedankenexperiment</i>,

124
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,670
a final thought experiment, for our final session together.

125
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:29,550
Something on a grand scale, something juicy.

126
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:33,677
Let's envision a global cataclysm

127
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,515
in the event of which, how do you survive?

128
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:39,996
Uh, the last day of the year is, you know,

129
00:09:40,109 --> 00:09:42,395
traditionally sort of a chill experience for seniors.

130
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:44,798
This is starting to feel not so chill.

131
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:48,549
Uh, the last day of the year is traditionally, you know,

132
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,513
still a day on which I can fail seniors.

133
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:53,553
Or at least knock them down a letter grade

134
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:54,635
for refusing to participate.

135
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:56,513
That's what the academic handbook says.

136
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,915
But what kind of cataclysm are we talking about?

137
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,511
Gamma ray burst? Pandemic? Erupting super volcano?

138
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:05,553
A sudden shift in the Earth's axis rotation? Grey goo?

139
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:06,909
Hang on Chips, we'll get there.

140
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,000
But is it biological? Geological? Thermo-nuclear? Meteorological?

141
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:14,875
Let's go old school. Say... atomic.

142
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:20,316
Ready? Set.

143
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:24,149
Think...

144
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,635
Definitely radiological and heading this way.

145
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,472
Sorry, what are we doing at Prambanan?

146
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:51,590
Field trip.

147
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:56,914
Listen up everyone. We're going to have to take shelter here in this reinforced bunker.

148
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:52,789
You see the problem.

149
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,793
We're a group of 21, but the bunker is only built for 10.

150
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:00,197
So we'll share beds, and ration supplies.

151
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:03,152
Can't be done. Let me show you why.

152
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:07,798
You can't share oxygen. Every cubic centimeter of breathable air in here

153
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:11,431
once the outer door is sealed, comes from these compressed tanks.

154
00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:12,716
This place has been engineered

155
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:14,837
to support ten people for one year

156
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,799
even one person more means death by hypoxia.

157
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,635
If you try to cram anyone else in, you'll asphyxiate.

158
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:03,553
The temperature of the impact point is ten million degrees

159
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:06,269
we have maybe an hour before the wind starts dropping fallout.

160
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:08,516
This is a radiological event that's global in scope.

161
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,269
To live through it, we'll have to spend a full year inside this bunker

162
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:14,352
which is equipped with a generator and fuel supply to keep it running that long.

163
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,433
Which means you have to decide

164
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:19,279
who's valuable enough to expend limited resources on.

165
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:22,559
I stipulate the existence of a thousand bunkers around the world

166
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,355
times 10 occupants per bunker, that's a gene pool of 10,000 people

167
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:28,072
to reboot the human race with.

168
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:32,274
Sorry, are you saying we are
supposed to choose who goes in the bunker and

169
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:37,039
who stays out and dies?
Because if that's the experiment I'm not doing it.

170
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:39,197
Well, you have to.

171
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:41,750
I won't. It's repulsive.

172
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,279
It's the sort of pseudo-science

173
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:48,313
a gang of nazis would have dreamt up in a beer garden, circa 1939.

174
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:49,833
This isn't a eugenics experiment.

175
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:51,914
The goal isn't to improve the human race

176
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,633
the goal is to save the human race.

177
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,518
Which means a commitment to reason no matter how much it hurts.

178
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:58,956
I decline.

179
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:01,548
Then we'll be 20 rather than 21 to whittle down to 10.

180
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:03,797
When the hot particles of nuclear fallout

181
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:09,472
burn through your skin and your organs
start shutting down through radiation poisoning,

182
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,120
try not to scream.

183
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,792
Well, I suppose I'm in.

184
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:23,831
I'm sorry but this one is not for me, so...

185
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:35,549
The thing about an A+, as far as semester grades go

186
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:40,235
it's more than rare, it's practically mythological.

187
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:46,758
And an A+ in Philosophy, there's never been one in the history of this department.

188
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:50,795
So I have to ask: how does it feel knowing

189
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:55,119
you could've been the first, if only you hadn't walked out the door?

190
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:59,072
Bribery is not my very favorite form of negotiation.

191
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:00,356
Then what about sympathy?

192
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:03,838
Let's say if you leave, someone else pays.

193
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,759
The difference between an A+ and an A

194
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:10,351
won't change your life. But for example, James?

195
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,837
A grade that drops from a B- to a C+

196
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:16,635
that might actually disturb the good people at the Cornell Admissions Office.

197
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,635
You'll risk a faculty review, to keep me here?

198
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:22,035
I'm a rationalist.

199
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:26,990
I know I need the best student in the room, to stay in the room

200
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:28,798
if I want a thought experiment

201
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:30,558
to yield its sharpest result.

202
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:38,120
This is one rude "goodbye", you could've just bought us pastries.

203
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,799
I don't have a problem with an atomic holocaust.

204
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:41,831
That's the spirit.

205
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:43,917
We are pioneers of the mind in this classroom,

206
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:45,871
scholars and philosophers.

207
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,197
So, this is how it's going to work.

208
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:52,558
You'll each choose at random a card from inside this box

209
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,039
On each card there is a profession

210
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:56,880
Based on that profession, your colleagues are going to make decisions

211
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,196
concerning your "bunker worthiness".

212
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,149
James was last one into the room...

213
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,675
I designate you first one into the experiment.

214
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:06,191
We'll make a punctual man out of you, one way or the other.

215
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:09,838
Isn't punctuality the virtue of the lonely?

216
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:21,912
So, who are we? James?

217
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:24,317
I am an organic farmer.

218
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:26,679
I'm a structural engineer.

219
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:27,790
I'm a real estate agent.

220
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:28,955
I'm a carpenter.

221
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:30,673
I'm an opera singer.

222
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,193
I'm a hedge fund manager.

223
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:34,910
I'm a harpist.

224
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:37,269
I'm an astronaut.

225
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,480
I'm a PhD in Chemistry.

226
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:41,556
I'm an electrician.

227
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:43,353
I'm a wine auctioneer.

228
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:44,879
I'm an orthopedic surgeon.

229
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:46,150
I'm a housekeeper.

230
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:47,474
I'm a fashion designer.

231
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:48,954
I'm a gelato maker.

232
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:50,556
I'm a zoologist.

233
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:52,150
I'm a psychotherapist.

234
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:53,675
I'm a soldier.

235
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:55,552
I'm a United States senator.

236
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:56,869
I'm a published poet.

237
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:22,437
You would never have voted him into the bunker.

238
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:25,597
What does a poet bring to the table in the world

239
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:28,279
we're facing? His skillset was the definition of useless.

240
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:30,117
That doesn't mean you had to kill him.

241
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:33,994
Was it any crueler than letting an atomic cloud peel his skin off?

242
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,833
Do you not see the weather?

243
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:41,596
And do you really imagine he was going to just sit on a rock

244
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:42,710
and wait to be scorched?

245
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:45,079
If you hadn't voted him a slot

246
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:47,319
he would have killed you to get in.

247
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:48,875
How can you know that?

248
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:51,116
You're still not locking on the conditions of the exercise.

249
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:54,875
You have a brutally short window
to calculate who deserves a slot on your bunker.

250
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:57,595
Your one tool: logic.

251
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:58,675
The variables:

252
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,190
your skillsets as indicated on the cards you've chosen.

253
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:05,279
Other than that, you are in the thought experiment as you are in real life.

254
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:08,030
James, name your best characteristic.

255
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,315
I'm a pacifist.

256
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:13,157
So he is a pacifist in our experiment.

257
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:14,231
If it was a close call

258
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:16,077
between two people of different gender

259
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,317
preference always goes to the girl.

260
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:22,196
Because childbearing becomes job #1 after the apocalypse.

261
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:24,477
Who are you in this experiment?

262
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:29,390
I am the wild card. A person whose skillset you don't know

263
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:32,115
so you have to assess whether it's worth keeping me around.

264
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:35,751
You might learn something from me, that you need to survive.

265
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,115
Sounds inconsistent.

266
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:39,670
Well then for now just think of me
as the chap who enforces the rules.

267
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:43,474
I'm an orthopedic surgeon. Which is
even better than being a regular doctor,

268
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:45,829
'cause I specialize in fixing broken bones

269
00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:47,479
of which I expect we'll have many.

270
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:51,599
I provide excellent value, so it's hard to envision not voting me in.

271
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,150
All agreed?

272
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:05,549
So, I'm a harpist.

273
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:09,557
It's rather worse than that. You're a harpist without a harp.

274
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,194
Is that really the measure of a man,

275
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:14,115
whether or not he has his harp with him, post-cataclysm?

276
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:15,759
But even if you had a harp,

277
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:19,710
as far as the survival of the species goes, harp playing is not crucial.

278
00:20:20,348 --> 00:20:22,795
So, who votes to give Russell a slot?

279
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:36,230
Fuck it.

280
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:42,155
Zoology just isn't a skillset we absolutely need.

281
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:43,349
We all know about animals.

282
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:46,279
A carpenter is basic, how can we not have a carpenter?

283
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:48,198
If we are going to repair broken equipment

284
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:49,760
we obviously need an electrician.

285
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:52,155
I don't really know what a wine auctioneer even does.

286
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:55,074
A fashion designer? Beatrice, I wish I could say yes,

287
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,920
but how would what you know about clothes help us survive?

288
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:02,636
Nelson, you're such a good guy but you're a housekeeper, it's low value.

289
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:04,955
Omosedé is a senator. She knows the law.

290
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:07,395
She knows how to negotiate, she knows how to lead.

291
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:09,158
James is an organic farmer.

292
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,714
If we can't grow food, we can't live.

293
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:16,078
A gelato maker is lovely, truly lovely, but that's it.

294
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:17,554
A real estate agent, in a world

295
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,597
with no more houses to buy or sell?

296
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:21,717
Look, I always wanted to be an astronaut but I don't think

297
00:21:21,828 --> 00:21:23,593
we'll be sending ships into space any time soon.

298
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:27,680
Jack has a PhD in Chemistry, that's vital in a thousand different ways.

299
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:28,914
We'll need a mental health professional

300
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:31,760
in a world where we're all going to be traumatized for the rest of our lives.

301
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:32,994
A hedge fund manager...

302
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:35,317
It will be like giving a slot to a vampire.

303
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,875
A structural engineer means we can rebuild

304
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:39,956
houses, bridges, dams..

305
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:43,198
What does a soldier contribute except ways to kill people?

306
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:44,874
Ways to keep the peace, of course.

307
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:46,877
An opera singer is essential

308
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:51,394
for entertainment, for relaxation, for inspiration.

309
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,074
What does Mr. Zimit bring?

310
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:55,436
The answer is, we don't know.

311
00:21:55,949 --> 00:22:00,033
He self-identifies as the wild card. It's too big a risk.

312
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:04,318
I think we can survive without an opera singer, at best it's a luxury.

313
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:07,952
Mr. Zimit is bringing some kind of secret utility, that can really matter.

314
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:10,635
I would rather have the chance to win big, than win small.

315
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:12,752
All in favor of giving Mr. Zimit the last slot?

316
00:22:57,348 --> 00:23:01,115
We're going to be cooped up for a whole year,
let's take 5 minutes and be alone.

317
00:23:13,388 --> 00:23:17,473
I found these in a stream. Should I bring them?

318
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:36,953
Thanks for staying to save me.

319
00:23:39,908 --> 00:23:41,831
What makes you think I stayed for you?

320
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:48,799
Well, I think you stayed to save me from getting a "C".

321
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:54,869
You can't live without me.

322
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:36,952
They didn't want to face the agony of death by radiation

323
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:41,109
they asked me to help.

324
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:51,591
I don't want him in the bunker with us.

325
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:02,789
Listen, I'm going to try some hydroponic gardening

326
00:25:04,348 --> 00:25:05,555
while we're locked in for the year.

327
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:08,393
Maybe get some fresh vitamins in our own system

328
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:09,795
instead of just the freeze-dried stuff.

329
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:14,118
So, if everybody could take a quick look around

330
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:15,469
and bring in whatever plants or herbs you find

331
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:16,589
that'd be a big help.

332
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:03,309
Better three hours too early, than one minute too late.

333
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:36,119
Is everybody OK?

334
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:41,355
We never saw the bathroom.

335
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:48,470
There's no condoms.

336
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,554
Sex isn't for fun anymore.

337
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:54,875
<i>Come look at this.</i>

338
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:03,234
It's a retreat space to take the edge off of cabin fever.

339
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:07,470
Artificial garden, phototherapy,

340
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,912
daybed, all to help alleviate depression.

341
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:59,030
I could live through a year in a bunker

342
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:05,960
I can find the fields, I can rebuild the world

343
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:13,993
I can do anything. As long as you're with me.

344
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:44,029
It's a lie, there is no exit code.

345
00:29:44,348 --> 00:29:45,430
Let's find out.
- No, no, no!

346
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:47,910
You'll flood us with radiation if it opens.

347
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:49,679
What if we do need a code to get out?

348
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,155
Well, we're going to have to live through
the year not knowing the answer to that.

349
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:55,715
Can I point out, that instead of writing down

350
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:57,318
he was the only one who had the code,

351
00:29:57,908 --> 00:29:59,433
he could've just written down the code.

352
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,237
- Meaning?
- He was only taunting us.

353
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:05,433
He knew it'd be a riddle gnawing at our brains for twelve months.

354
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,150
I'm not sure about that.

355
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,312
Why would a bunker need a code to get out?

356
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:12,954
Security precaution

357
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:16,113
to prevent someone opening the door too early, without realizing it would kill us.

358
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,199
He wouldn't bury us in here...

359
00:30:18,388 --> 00:30:19,390
- Maybe he would.

360
00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:22,956
We did do the dirty on him and lock him out.

361
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:30,789
364 more days till we know who's right.

362
00:32:44,469 --> 00:32:46,836
It wasn't what you'd call a heavenly year.

363
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:52,791
Life in a bunker or on the wrong side of an atomic apocalypse

364
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:56,160
is no joy, under the best of circumstances.

365
00:32:57,229 --> 00:32:58,390
But it's far worse.

366
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,875
When you're there, brooding over the calendar

367
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:06,190
wondering if the end of
your first agony will be the beginning of your next.

368
00:33:50,388 --> 00:33:53,632
Without the exit code, there was no getting out.

369
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,759
Every idea the mind could spit up was tried.

370
00:33:57,868 --> 00:34:00,236
Beginning with the bunker's small armoury.

371
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:27,877
It was all in vain. The emotional instead of rational calculus

372
00:34:27,988 --> 00:34:30,832
used to deny the one person a slot in the bunker

373
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,475
who, as it turns out,

374
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:38,792
could have got everyone safely out again,
was now producing its inescapable result.

375
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:01,475
Eventually the last container of food

376
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:05,196
from the last storage bin, was cooked and served.

377
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,158
No proper meals followed,

378
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:20,276
only scraps of nourishment from any source available.

379
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:36,078
Then came an unexpected death.

380
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:38,760
A brain aneurysm,

381
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:42,678
though not a medical examiner was present to say so,

382
00:35:43,468 --> 00:35:45,995
brought on by acute mental anguish.

383
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:16,517
Those who couldn't bear what they had done to stay alive

384
00:36:16,629 --> 00:36:22,317
or what horrors they had to look
forward to until they die, asked for help.

385
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:27,555
And then, finally, the oxygen supply

386
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:30,399
which had lasted several weeks longer than a year

387
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:36,191
because there had been only 9 people
in the bunker instead of 10, dribbled to a halt.

388
00:36:39,388 --> 00:36:43,109
Hypoxia followed and then it was all done.

389
00:36:57,908 --> 00:36:58,990
Charming.

390
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:01,395
I was eaten.

391
00:37:02,149 --> 00:37:05,312
I'm a little dubious about only you knowing the exit code.

392
00:37:05,428 --> 00:37:06,839
It's quite coincidental.

393
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:12,028
Einstein said: "<i>Coincidence is just God's way of staying anonymous.</i>"

394
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:14,153
So God gave you the code?

395
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:19,196
I stipulated I was the wild card, which you get in any random sampling.

396
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:21,915
Your job was to include or exclude me, based on

397
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:24,999
what you didn't know about me. You chose wrong.

398
00:37:26,508 --> 00:37:32,515
Because what you didn't know about me, is I'm a bunker builder

399
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:35,758
with the Indonesian Defense Department.

400
00:37:35,868 --> 00:37:38,872
As a matter of fact, I built the bunker you just died in.

401
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:42,988
So it's no surprise I knew the exit code, since I keyed it into the system myself.

402
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,430
Don't worry about it, you'll do better in the next iteration.

403
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:49,995
Next iteration?

404
00:38:07,669 --> 00:38:08,749
Mount Bromo.

405
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:12,033
New iteration: new location.

406
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:17,633
But we still have a bunker and we still have an apocalypse.

407
00:38:49,948 --> 00:38:51,189
Everything is in one piece inside.

408
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:52,879
So how would it be any different this time?

409
00:38:52,988 --> 00:38:55,754
There's always another angle to any experiment,

410
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:57,075
and you saw going in

411
00:38:57,308 --> 00:39:00,437
no one in the world is defined only by his or her skillset.

412
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:02,232
There's always more to the story.

413
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:04,551
Check the inside of your card.

414
00:39:04,828 --> 00:39:06,593
Hold on — one at a time.

415
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:08,709
I'm an organic farmer...

416
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:12,310
who is gay.

417
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:14,356
That's not going to win votes.

418
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,517
- Why not?
- Because we're stepping things up.

419
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:19,189
Every bunker around the world is now required to get

420
00:39:19,308 --> 00:39:20,993
at least one pregnancy in the works.

421
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:25,511
Preferably produce a healthy baby during the course of the year's confinement.

422
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:29,834
That doesn't answer my question. I'm a farmer, I'm gay.

423
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,236
No big deal, I still know what I know about farming

424
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:36,272
and I can still sleep with a girl to get her pregnant,
if that's what you're talking about.

425
00:39:37,028 --> 00:39:41,158
I still have the right equipment, so... whoever wants to vote for me?

426
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:52,997
I'm an orthopedic surgeon who, on a trip to Uganda last week

427
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:55,794
for "Doctors Without Borders", was exposed to the Ebola virus

428
00:39:56,669 --> 00:39:59,991
and may or may not be on the verge of a full-blown ebola hemorrhagic fever.

429
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:06,357
That's a puzzler. Do you risk a slot on a doctor

430
00:40:07,028 --> 00:40:10,749
who could save your life, if she doesn't drop dead next week,

431
00:40:11,149 --> 00:40:14,357
or who could just as easily infect you with the virus

432
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:17,638
that will exterminate the whole bunker.

433
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,798
I highly doubt I contracted the disease, I'm sure I'll be fine.

434
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,671
All in favor of going through the apocalypse with healthcare?

435
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:50,350
I don't think that's logical decision making.

436
00:40:52,308 --> 00:40:54,595
I think it's irrational surrender to fear-mongering.

437
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:02,997
I won't be leaving here with warm memories of you, because of this.

438
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:07,116
I don't care how warm your memories of me are

439
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:11,718
I only care whether I stretched your brains to their largest possible size.

440
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:13,796
You're a mean bean, Mr. Zimit.

441
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:18,109
And pardon me for saying but somedays your logic reeks of bullshit.

442
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:27,149
Next.

443
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,433
I'm a hedge fund manager

444
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:33,270
who, because of a phobia about Armageddon

445
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:38,316
always travels with 5 million dollars worth of
diamonds, sapphires, gold and platinum in hand

446
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:44,033
and unlike paper money it holds its value during war or famine

447
00:41:44,149 --> 00:41:45,674
or in a cataclysm like this.

448
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:50,957
Plus she's a girl. She has girl parts.

449
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:57,676
Chips, you're up.

450
00:41:58,269 --> 00:41:59,316
I'm a carpenter...

451
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:05,316
Um, sterile. Cool.

452
00:42:06,428 --> 00:42:08,477
Atomic war is going to flatten everything, right?

453
00:42:08,908 --> 00:42:13,198
So, we're going to need to build new houses, barns and sheds with our bare hands

454
00:42:13,308 --> 00:42:15,232
Everything is going to be made out of wood for a century.

455
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:16,475
That takes expertise.

456
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,229
I'm voting for Chips.

457
00:42:23,428 --> 00:42:24,430
Thanks, James.

458
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:31,198
I am a structural engineer who is also an electrical engineer.

459
00:42:32,308 --> 00:42:33,470
Hard to argue with that.

460
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:41,040
I'm an electrician

461
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:46,395
who has <i>fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</i>.

462
00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:50,629
It's a very rare disease of the connective tissue, a mutation.

463
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:54,830
Every time I fall down or bump into something

464
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:57,680
wherever I hurt myself turns to bone on the inside.

465
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:00,240
In the end I'll ossify all over

466
00:43:01,948 --> 00:43:04,953
I'll be a statue under my skin. I'll only be able to move my lips.

467
00:43:06,468 --> 00:43:10,792
Andy... I'm sorry mate, but that's not so good.

468
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:15,915
We let you in the first time so you could
help get the electrical grid working, but

469
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:18,879
if you're all turned into bone

470
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:21,830
you're not going to be able to climb the transmission towers

471
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:23,832
or even walk.

472
00:43:24,789 --> 00:43:25,596
I could be really careful

473
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:27,836
and try not to bump into things for a few years.

474
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:30,870
Sounds like a losing battle.

475
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:36,359
Also, you're no treat for the gene pool.

476
00:43:39,948 --> 00:43:42,600
Petra's extra degree in electrical engineering

477
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,914
means your skillset as an electrician won't be much missed.

478
00:43:47,868 --> 00:43:50,712
What's going on? We've already had our blasts.

479
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:52,709
This is worse than before.

480
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:56,033
We are in the middle of an atomic free-for-all.

481
00:43:56,189 --> 00:43:59,988
We'd better wrap this up. Poppie.

482
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:09,075
I'm a psychotherapist, though it's true

483
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:10,953
I had a hysterectomy at the age of 12

484
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:13,352
due to pediatric overian cancer.

485
00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:15,678
So you can't have kids?

486
00:44:21,189 --> 00:44:24,352
I'm a zoologist and I blog at night for PETA.

487
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:29,758
Well, there are no more zoos and no more computers...

488
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:31,879
There are still animals.

489
00:44:32,028 --> 00:44:35,511
Vivian, we are at the dividing line between survival and annihilation

490
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:39,236
What do you have to offer after the bombs stop falling?

491
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:43,319
I'm a PhD in Chemistry who won the genetic lotto.

492
00:44:43,669 --> 00:44:46,593
So I won't get heart disease, lung disease,

493
00:44:46,709 --> 00:44:48,392
joint disease or brain disease.

494
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,270
Barring a knife to the neck or stepping into quicksand

495
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:55,553
I will live to the age of 103 without any
serious physical ailment or impediment.

496
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:06,078
I'm a real estate agent but also a midwife.

497
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:07,435
A male midwife?

498
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:10,993
Yeah, a male midwife. Sexist.

499
00:45:11,149 --> 00:45:13,959
We've lost our doctor, we need someone who can deliver babies.

500
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:17,111
How can we not vote for a midwife?

501
00:45:17,508 --> 00:45:18,794
I'm a gelato maker...

502
00:45:20,508 --> 00:45:21,569
That's it.

503
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:24,194
There's nothing on the inside of my card.

504
00:45:24,508 --> 00:45:25,555
All against?

505
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:37,071
I'm an opera singer, so I speak seven languages.

506
00:45:37,189 --> 00:45:39,714
We'll need to be able to communicate with survivors

507
00:45:39,828 --> 00:45:41,479
from other bunkers around the world.

508
00:45:46,388 --> 00:45:47,674
There's something else.

509
00:45:48,189 --> 00:45:52,352
But, why does the inside of my card say two things?

510
00:45:52,508 --> 00:45:53,669
And mine said none?

511
00:45:53,828 --> 00:45:56,912
Must be a typo. Keep going.

512
00:45:58,229 --> 00:46:01,471
In three years I'll develop throat cancer

513
00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:03,914
and if there's no hospital

514
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:08,720
and no doctor to take out the tumor, I'll lose my voice.

515
00:46:10,348 --> 00:46:14,035
I won't be able to sing or speak

516
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:18,439
even though the cancer will stop just short of killing me.

517
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:31,077
I'm a wine auctioneer. I have an IQ of 200.

518
00:46:31,308 --> 00:46:32,435
I'm voting for Mitzi.

519
00:46:32,669 --> 00:46:33,794
You're voting for everyone.

520
00:46:33,948 --> 00:46:35,394
She's literally a genius.

521
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,312
It's less impressive than it sounds.

522
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,997
A wine auctioneer who tests well is...

523
00:46:40,868 --> 00:46:46,194
not a must-have for saving civilization. I'm sorry Mitz.

524
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:47,390
I'm a fashion designer

525
00:46:47,508 --> 00:46:50,796
who created a hit line of women's wear out of bamboo cashmere.

526
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:53,714
So I'm a left brain, right brain success story.

527
00:46:53,868 --> 00:46:57,475
Insignificant. All against?

528
00:46:59,308 --> 00:47:03,439
I'm a harpist with an autism spectrum disorder.

529
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:06,752
I'm a United States senator

530
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:10,598
who would have become the first female Chief Justice of the Supreme Court

531
00:47:11,669 --> 00:47:14,274
and the most effective American jurist in the generation.

532
00:47:14,468 --> 00:47:16,596
I'm a soldier with a documented eidetic memory.

533
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:21,397
The army has me on tape reciting the first 92,000 decimal places of Pi.

534
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:24,830
I'm a housekeeper who is such a good and kind person

535
00:47:24,948 --> 00:47:26,109
that the angels will bow their heads as

536
00:47:26,229 --> 00:47:28,799
I walk through the gates of heaven, if heaven exists.

537
00:47:29,508 --> 00:47:31,557
And if not, I'm just a nice guy who cleans rooms.

538
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:34,354
Are we seriously considering this?

539
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:35,950
We need more boys.

540
00:47:36,589 --> 00:47:37,511
He is a housekeeper.

541
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:40,154
No nation succeeds without a strong working class.

542
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:43,872
He's strong, I say we let in some strength.

543
00:48:11,828 --> 00:48:12,875
I'm a published poet who...

544
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,200
I'm afraid his slot's for me.

545
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:28,758
Why would we give it to you now?

546
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:30,799
We never got the exit code from him.

547
00:48:31,348 --> 00:48:32,760
We still need what he knows.

548
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:41,999
Give me the keys to the truck. Now. Now!

549
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:46,752
I intend to outrun these blasts. I have room for passengers. It's up to you!

550
00:49:34,468 --> 00:49:35,515
Move, move, move!

551
00:51:11,888 --> 00:51:12,888
Petra.

552
00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:16,232
Petra, please. Petra, please stop!

553
00:51:21,308 --> 00:51:22,470
Petra, please!

554
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:24,589
What happened?

555
00:51:30,028 --> 00:51:32,316
I walked in on James and Jack.

556
00:51:33,749 --> 00:51:34,749
James and Jack?

557
00:51:36,669 --> 00:51:38,432
This is how I am now, you know that.

558
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:40,028
But with Jack?

559
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:42,350
Yeah, the rules are, except for what's written on the cards

560
00:51:42,468 --> 00:51:45,551
we are in the thought experiment what we are in real life.

561
00:51:48,549 --> 00:51:49,549
I didn't know.

562
00:51:51,428 --> 00:51:53,830
My boyfriend was over from Cambridge at Christmas, you met him.

563
00:51:54,988 --> 00:51:56,319
I thought that was your cousin.

564
00:51:57,269 --> 00:51:58,350
My cousin?

565
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:02,875
I misunderstood for some reason, I apologize.

566
00:52:22,468 --> 00:52:23,549
Are you OK?

567
00:52:37,749 --> 00:52:39,877
At least James can still be your baby daddy.

568
00:52:41,189 --> 00:52:42,520
You can still procreate with him.

569
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:45,312
I'm not sure about that.

570
00:52:48,229 --> 00:52:50,549
I'm just not sure I feel right about sleeping with a girl.

571
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:52,789
For me, it'd be unnatural.

572
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:55,636
And for the survival of the species you couldn't fake it?

573
00:52:56,908 --> 00:52:57,990
Which you said you would.

574
00:52:58,428 --> 00:52:59,475
Should I have to?

575
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:05,274
I mean, do we really understand what the bigger picture is?

576
00:53:07,388 --> 00:53:10,120
Maybe by not procreating I'm helping the species to survive

577
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:15,156
or even evolve in some complicated way we can't understand.

578
00:53:15,269 --> 00:53:19,115
Evolve, by not procreating?

579
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:25,872
Maybe this is a good time to go over how we are going to pair up.

580
00:53:28,508 --> 00:53:31,035
We need to get a pregnancy going as fast as we can

581
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:35,716
and the arithmetic on six males and four females doesn't leave many options.

582
00:53:37,028 --> 00:53:40,397
First of all, Bonnie and Plum are both
having their periods, so they're out for now.

583
00:53:40,828 --> 00:53:42,432
How did you know I'm having my period?

584
00:53:42,868 --> 00:53:45,156
I'm a midwife. I can tell.

585
00:53:47,549 --> 00:53:50,359
And I think Omosedé has her eye on Nelson,

586
00:53:51,988 --> 00:53:52,990
so they're paired up.

587
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:56,439
Does that sound OK to you?

588
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:01,116
Lovely.

589
00:54:02,468 --> 00:54:05,312
Which leaves Petra, who's ovulating

590
00:54:08,028 --> 00:54:10,031
and for sperm donation it's Mr. Zimit.

591
00:54:12,629 --> 00:54:13,676
What?

592
00:54:14,308 --> 00:54:15,470
Well, you said you were out on principle.

593
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,113
Jack might still be willing to pitch in?

594
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:38,952
So Jack is out. Nelson is already spoken for. Chips is unfortunately sterile.

595
00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:41,232
And sleeping across religious lines isn't

596
00:54:41,348 --> 00:54:44,477
forbidden <i>per se</i> in my faith, but

597
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:50,278
sleeping with a partner who's not otherwise chased, is.

598
00:54:53,229 --> 00:54:54,435
Which leaves Mr. Zimit.

599
00:54:59,468 --> 00:55:01,039
We do need to multiply.

600
00:55:12,149 --> 00:55:13,229
What, right now?

601
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:31,910
Petra?

602
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:40,035
Petra, just because I don't want to sleep with you anymore

603
00:55:40,149 --> 00:55:41,991
doesn't mean I don't love you anymore.

604
00:57:40,229 --> 00:57:41,390
It's not working.

605
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:45,510
What's not working?

606
00:57:45,868 --> 00:57:49,714
Four women in prime physical condition, ten weeks of intercourse,

607
00:57:51,508 --> 00:57:54,352
no pregnancies. Something's not right.

608
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:56,993
We're ten of the last people on Earth

609
00:57:58,388 --> 00:57:59,549
we're stuck in a bunker

610
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:02,870
and we're under the influence of an atomic war

611
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:06,278
that for some unknown reason, keeps going on and on.

612
00:58:07,028 --> 00:58:09,475
The stress alone is enough to stop conception.

613
00:58:10,269 --> 00:58:13,671
The uterus isn't stupid, it knows what it's doing.

614
00:58:14,109 --> 00:58:16,316
Evidently it still needs some help.

615
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:17,595
I don't like the sound of that.

616
00:58:18,229 --> 00:58:19,993
Do you really still not see it?

617
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:22,917
We're not here just to save ourselves

618
00:58:23,229 --> 00:58:25,595
we're here to make sure that human life continues.

619
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:29,075
Reproducing is our highest priority.

620
00:58:31,238 --> 00:58:32,789
We need to start a new program.

621
00:58:34,669 --> 00:58:36,080
Multiple partners for the girls

622
00:58:39,028 --> 00:58:41,600
and this time all of the boys are going to have to contribute

623
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:43,073
to maximize our odds.

624
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:45,631
No matter how much one of them doesn't like it.

625
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:50,510
We are pushing logic hard to try to survive.

626
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:55,997
We are extreme philosophers because we have big problems to solve

627
00:58:57,549 --> 00:59:01,156
but philosophy isn't morality and even logic has its limit

628
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:05,991
so let me explain this to you.

629
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:12,760
You will not force me to be with any boy

630
00:59:12,868 --> 00:59:16,475
other than the one I want to be with, or different boys on different nights.

631
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:20,475
If you try, I will kill you.

632
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:56,874
Get up! Get up, all of you. Out. Out!

633
00:59:57,269 --> 00:59:59,789
Out! All of you, out!

634
01:00:01,336 --> 01:00:02,336
Not you.

635
01:00:06,229 --> 01:00:08,196
Go! Now! Move!

636
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,593
Human beings were built with a design flaw.

637
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:31,798
We believe what we feel, rather than what is.

638
01:00:33,149 --> 01:00:35,799
Which means that the weaker-minded among us are...

639
01:00:36,189 --> 01:00:41,513
easily swayed by impassioned arguments. Even when they're very bad ideas.

640
01:00:43,828 --> 01:00:46,274
I won't have you debating us into extinction.

641
01:00:48,589 --> 01:00:53,435
I'll say what I want. If you don't like it, shoot me.

642
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:17,790
No!

643
01:02:40,229 --> 01:02:45,520
One more round? We can do better!

644
01:02:50,269 --> 01:02:54,957
I have a question. Why did you cough before?

645
01:02:56,988 --> 01:02:57,875
What?

646
01:02:57,988 --> 01:03:02,198
Right after I picked my card you had a sort of... coughing fit.

647
01:03:05,468 --> 01:03:07,676
And you had another one right after Petra picked hers.

648
01:03:11,908 --> 01:03:15,799
You haven't coughed since. It's... it's curious.

649
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:19,669
I took a cough drop.

650
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:23,836
I didn't notice, and I've been looking right at you.

651
01:04:10,828 --> 01:04:16,676
It has hidden compartments. It's like a magician's box.

652
01:04:19,868 --> 01:04:21,519
These all say the same thing:

653
01:04:23,508 --> 01:04:25,078
"Organic farmer, who's gay."

654
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:31,939
And these are all "structural engineer, electrical engineer".

655
01:04:36,028 --> 01:04:37,394
That's why you had me go first

656
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:41,471
so any card I picked would have been the same.

657
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:48,192
Then you switched them out so any card Petra picked

658
01:04:48,308 --> 01:04:49,356
would have been the same.

659
01:04:50,189 --> 01:04:53,033
Then you switched in all the random cards for everybody else.

660
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:56,952
First you made me important

661
01:04:57,709 --> 01:04:59,073
by making me a farmer

662
01:05:00,828 --> 01:05:02,671
Then you made me irrelevant by making me gay.

663
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:08,160
Which is relevant and awesome if it's real but

664
01:05:08,269 --> 01:05:13,435
why rig it? Just to cut me out of the gene pool?

665
01:05:16,468 --> 01:05:19,040
I get that you never thought I was smart enough for your class.

666
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:23,636
Does it really offend you that much that I'm here?

667
01:05:26,948 --> 01:05:28,314
Because that's one seriously demented vendetta

668
01:05:28,428 --> 01:05:30,830
against one harmlessly mediocre student.

669
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,794
You remember the Allegory of Plato's Cave?

670
01:05:39,868 --> 01:05:40,950
Yeah?

671
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:42,555
Sum it up.

672
01:05:44,749 --> 01:05:48,310
A person lives his entire life from when he is a little kid

673
01:05:48,428 --> 01:05:51,591
chained to a wall inside a cave, where all he ever sees are shadows

674
01:05:51,709 --> 01:05:53,153
and all he ever hears are echoes

675
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:58,593
so... he assumes that's what reality really looks like and sounds like.

676
01:06:01,028 --> 01:06:04,555
Then one day he is unchained and he

677
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,113
realizes there were bodies casting the shadows

678
01:06:06,269 --> 01:06:07,872
and voices making the echoes.

679
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:15,077
His whole idea of what was real was all just an illusion.

680
01:06:23,948 --> 01:06:25,439
That sounds a bit like you.

681
01:06:29,189 --> 01:06:34,116
Only in your case, chained by privilege and good luck

682
01:06:35,948 --> 01:06:38,189
watching shadows of beautiful shapes

683
01:06:38,308 --> 01:06:39,754
and hearing echoes of success

684
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:44,830
and thinking that's how things truly, rightfully and eternally are.

685
01:06:49,669 --> 01:06:51,557
Well, now you got a glimpse through that illusion.

686
01:06:53,028 --> 01:06:54,598
I wouldn't call that a vendetta, James

687
01:06:55,749 --> 01:06:57,274
I'd call it a tutorial.

688
01:06:58,388 --> 01:07:03,350
I can tell you're lying to me. I just don't know what about.

689
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:12,116
If you really wanted to enlighten me
or disillusion me, or whatever you're deciding to call it,

690
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:14,879
I still don't understand why you'd bother

691
01:07:14,988 --> 01:07:16,229
making me a farmer.

692
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:21,517
Why not a, I don't know... a florist? So I'd never make the cut at all.

693
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:26,234
You know what? I do want another round.

694
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:28,917
You haven't had enough philosophy for one day?

695
01:07:29,549 --> 01:07:33,678
I wanna go again. Let's reset and get our Doomsday on, one more time.

696
01:07:33,948 --> 01:07:34,995
Please, can we not?

697
01:07:39,549 --> 01:07:40,789
I'd like to do another.

698
01:07:44,789 --> 01:07:47,395
Let's do another one.

699
01:07:48,229 --> 01:07:49,276
Great.

700
01:07:50,229 --> 01:07:52,629
Just one thing: this time, you are a florist.

701
01:08:10,149 --> 01:08:11,149
Are we early?

702
01:08:12,308 --> 01:08:15,517
Nothing yet. I'll do a quick check.

703
01:08:42,749 --> 01:08:44,591
Looks like you could use some company.

704
01:08:53,068 --> 01:08:54,116
Can I give you a hug?

705
01:08:57,669 --> 01:08:58,750
Why?

706
01:08:58,908 --> 01:09:00,911
Because I know how hard this has been on you.

707
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,117
I'm going to change things now.

708
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:24,269
You're not going to like it.

709
01:09:31,549 --> 01:09:33,152
I have a proposition to make.

710
01:09:34,068 --> 01:09:37,072
We've had trouble deciding who gets a slot the past few times.

711
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:42,995
But I have a different way we could go, if you're willing.

712
01:09:44,028 --> 01:09:49,353
You all know me. You know what kind of person I am, for better or for worse.

713
01:09:50,429 --> 01:09:52,830
So I'd like to be in charge of who's in and who's out,

714
01:09:54,028 --> 01:09:58,033
and if you agree I promise I'll use my very best and fairest judgment.

715
01:10:11,028 --> 01:10:15,557
I'm staying out of it. You have to find your own fate now.

716
01:11:10,828 --> 01:11:11,910
Is this a joke?

717
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:14,714
As is you staying out of it?

718
01:11:16,028 --> 01:11:17,599
I have an obligation to step back in

719
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:20,154
if I see a student about to walk off a cliff.

720
01:11:20,349 --> 01:11:21,634
This is who you want to let in?

721
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:24,880
A wine auctioneer?

722
01:11:25,349 --> 01:11:26,839
She has a genius IQ

723
01:11:26,988 --> 01:11:29,992
which made her smart enough to pack a case of red and a case of white

724
01:11:30,108 --> 01:11:32,111
into the boat for our field trip.

725
01:11:36,868 --> 01:11:43,228
That's a shame. Because that A+ just vanished into thin air.

726
01:11:46,589 --> 01:11:47,920
A fashion designer?

727
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:50,232
Dressing well boosts self-esteem

728
01:11:50,629 --> 01:11:52,393
self-esteem promotes productivity

729
01:11:52,509 --> 01:11:54,830
productivity rebuilds civilization.

730
01:11:57,868 --> 01:11:58,950
A-

731
01:12:03,309 --> 01:12:06,950
Petra, this is disorder. The poet?

732
01:12:07,309 --> 01:12:10,916
The poet, we would've known if you'd let him describe himself,

733
01:12:11,349 --> 01:12:13,397
is also a champion poker player

734
01:12:14,108 --> 01:12:15,474
and he brought his cards.

735
01:12:16,309 --> 01:12:18,277
The harpist has autism.

736
01:12:18,509 --> 01:12:20,750
Some people consider autism a gift.

737
01:12:25,028 --> 01:12:26,154
B+

738
01:12:26,268 --> 01:12:29,352
She was exposed to the ebola virus last week.

739
01:12:29,589 --> 01:12:31,432
I'm praying she wasn't infected.

740
01:12:33,188 --> 01:12:34,236
Down to a "B".

741
01:12:35,349 --> 01:12:37,032
She's an opera singer who's struck with cancer

742
01:12:37,148 --> 01:12:38,912
and can't even speak in three years.

743
01:12:39,108 --> 01:12:40,156
What's the point?

744
01:12:40,629 --> 01:12:44,554
We could be dead in three days, I'd like to fall asleep to music

745
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:45,915
before it's all over.

746
01:12:49,148 --> 01:12:50,639
B-

747
01:12:54,469 --> 01:12:58,189
Jack, you've got the beautiful difference in your favor

748
01:12:58,389 --> 01:13:01,756
and we need to make sure a virtue like that stays in the gene pool.

749
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:05,089
Sorry, I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but...

750
01:13:05,688 --> 01:13:08,674
am I the only one who won't have anyone in here to be with?

751
01:13:09,268 --> 01:13:10,554
There isn't anyone now.

752
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:14,759
But what about in here? It'll carry over.

753
01:13:15,188 --> 01:13:17,953
Wait, sorry... you want someone who's not out, to come out right now

754
01:13:18,509 --> 01:13:20,477
just to sleep with you in a thought experiment?

755
01:13:20,589 --> 01:13:23,956
We'll graduate tomorrow, now's a good time to make a move.

756
01:13:25,828 --> 01:13:28,752
Out of twenty of us, statistically, there's gotta be somebody else.

757
01:13:42,549 --> 01:13:45,598
Really? Nobody?

758
01:13:55,228 --> 01:13:58,790
Parker? Get in!

759
01:14:04,948 --> 01:14:08,590
You have two slots left. Choose.

760
01:14:15,068 --> 01:14:20,837
No. He's a florist, there's no way you can justify it.

761
01:14:29,868 --> 01:14:31,871
You're willing to go through life defending yourself

762
01:14:31,988 --> 01:14:34,151
everytime someone checks your transcript?

763
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:38,240
Explaining that you really were the best student in the class

764
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:44,630
but you almost failed because... I don't know what?

765
01:14:58,629 --> 01:14:59,710
I won't let you do it.

766
01:15:07,429 --> 01:15:09,908
Get out of there. Get out!

767
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:12,158
Get out!

768
01:15:16,349 --> 01:15:17,395
Are you looking for this?

769
01:15:23,549 --> 01:15:24,755
Can I give you a hug?

770
01:15:34,749 --> 01:15:36,080
I'm going to give it back to you now.

771
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:39,509
You're going to walk away and find your own fate with it.

772
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:04,474
Put these away, you'll have them if you need them.

773
01:16:12,749 --> 01:16:13,795
Put them away!

774
01:16:31,349 --> 01:16:33,477
Put the bullets away and go!

775
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:40,157
You can't shoot me, you're a pacifist.

776
01:16:43,789 --> 01:16:44,870
I'll make an exception.

777
01:16:45,429 --> 01:16:47,955
You won't know the exit code without me.

778
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:50,040
7 - 3 - 8 - 7 - 2

779
01:17:03,108 --> 01:17:04,189
Eidetic memory.

780
01:17:17,988 --> 01:17:19,115
Petra, get in.

781
01:17:20,108 --> 01:17:22,554
I didn't ask to run this so I could save myself.

782
01:17:23,669 --> 01:17:28,960
It's the last slot. Petra!

783
01:17:33,228 --> 01:17:36,471
Bonnie, get inside.

784
01:17:36,589 --> 01:17:40,229
I'm a soldier, I know how to knock things down,
you're an engineer, you know how to build things up.

785
01:17:41,749 --> 01:17:42,795
I'm not worth as much.

786
01:17:43,108 --> 01:17:44,439
My logic's fuzzier.

787
01:17:45,669 --> 01:17:49,151
In my apocalypse everybody is worth as much as everybody else.

788
01:17:49,268 --> 01:17:50,191
No.

789
01:17:50,309 --> 01:17:51,754
I'm not letting you sacrifice yourself to save me.

790
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:53,951
I won't let you sacrifice yourself to save me.

791
01:17:54,068 --> 01:17:54,991
Then we'll both go up in smoke

792
01:17:55,108 --> 01:17:56,951
and you'll have wasted a slot for someone to live.

793
01:18:00,669 --> 01:18:01,715
Chips?

794
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:14,077
Petra. It doesn't matter about the slots, we have to go now.

795
01:18:23,948 --> 01:18:25,438
We'll take the boat and get away.

796
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:29,359
We'll find an island outside the detonation zone.

797
01:18:30,068 --> 01:18:31,149
There's still time.

798
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:34,518
Petra! I have the keys to the boat.

799
01:18:49,108 --> 01:18:50,634
Let's go. Let's go!

800
01:19:27,868 --> 01:19:30,314
So we settled in for a year inside the bunker

801
01:19:31,028 --> 01:19:33,634
keeping safe from an atomic holocaust

802
01:19:34,549 --> 01:19:36,870
and despite the horrific circumstances,

803
01:19:37,709 --> 01:19:41,394
which should have made everyone of us absolutely miserable,

804
01:19:41,948 --> 01:19:44,554
somehow, we had fun.

805
01:19:46,469 --> 01:19:47,880
Toby's cards helped

806
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:02,870
and good wine

807
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:07,871
and poker kept our spirits up

808
01:20:08,709 --> 01:20:12,599
especially since Plum had been generous enough to leave us her gold.

809
01:20:14,669 --> 01:20:15,908
And when Mitzi confessed

810
01:20:16,028 --> 01:20:19,875
she always brought along something a bit stronger on out-of-town trips

811
01:20:19,988 --> 01:20:21,911
some of us were glad to know it.

812
01:20:23,549 --> 01:20:24,835
Then there was Shakespeare.

813
01:20:37,108 --> 01:20:39,554
And once a month we had an original poem.

814
01:21:23,309 --> 01:21:28,554
And now and then, late at night, one of us danced

815
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:33,471
because if you don't know what a gelato maker

816
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:35,590
is practicing in his spare time

817
01:21:36,868 --> 01:21:38,358
you don't know the whole story.

818
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:53,356
One good thing about the apocalypse:
all the extra time we are going to have together.

819
01:21:57,629 --> 01:21:59,471
So I might need the next twenty or

820
01:22:01,148 --> 01:22:03,594
thirty years just to tell you every way I love you.

821
01:22:10,429 --> 01:22:11,999
Now you say it back to me.

822
01:22:21,908 --> 01:22:23,148
I like your nose

823
01:22:27,068 --> 01:22:28,069
And?

824
01:22:34,389 --> 01:22:35,435
The way you smile

825
01:22:41,709 --> 01:22:44,076
and I love your terrible poems.

826
01:22:49,908 --> 01:22:52,354
There's a girl I know named Petra

827
01:22:54,429 --> 01:22:58,639
She's smart and cute, <i>etcetera</i>

828
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:02,868
I like her hair, it's blond and fair

829
01:23:05,669 --> 01:23:07,636
and I'm really glad I met ya!

830
01:23:15,828 --> 01:23:17,956
So you only like me for the things I do badly?

831
01:23:32,908 --> 01:23:33,910
No.

832
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:39,915
We had a universe to ourselves for a while

833
01:23:42,108 --> 01:23:43,554
and in our universe

834
01:23:44,908 --> 01:23:51,518
we had art, we had literature and we had engineering.

835
01:23:52,948 --> 01:23:56,157
The machine room was a trove of spare parts

836
01:23:56,629 --> 01:24:00,394
puzzle pieces for all kinds of acts of creation and construction

837
01:24:01,389 --> 01:24:03,595
and engineers do love puzzles,

838
01:24:04,309 --> 01:24:06,880
especially in the service of their friends.

839
01:24:08,228 --> 01:24:11,790
Because a harpist without a harp isn't a liability,

840
01:24:12,868 --> 01:24:15,156
only a riddle to solve.

841
01:25:24,549 --> 01:25:26,471
And finally we prayed.

842
01:25:26,749 --> 01:25:29,036
We prayed for our friends who weren't with us

843
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:32,314
we prayed for the other survivors around the world

844
01:25:33,028 --> 01:25:37,238
we prayed for the animals who didn't have
safe places to wait out the troubles

845
01:25:37,828 --> 01:25:41,197
we prayed for our parents. We prayed to God

846
01:25:41,309 --> 01:25:44,358
there was some kind of greater plan in the works.

847
01:25:45,148 --> 01:25:47,914
And then the year was up.

848
01:26:11,948 --> 01:26:13,474
The bombs never fell

849
01:26:15,868 --> 01:26:16,995
We're okay.

850
01:26:19,589 --> 01:26:20,828
You mean, you're alive?

851
01:26:23,509 --> 01:26:25,750
And here is what I predict happens next.

852
01:26:26,429 --> 01:26:28,510
True, the bombs never fell where you are

853
01:26:28,629 --> 01:26:30,835
but the rest of the world was decimated.

854
01:26:30,988 --> 01:26:33,959
But since you're mostly deficient in the skillsets of practical value

855
01:26:34,068 --> 01:26:35,594
you can never get back to Jakarta

856
01:26:35,709 --> 01:26:39,076
or build new shelters or even grow food and feed yourselves.

857
01:26:39,589 --> 01:26:40,875
So you die off.

858
01:26:41,868 --> 01:26:45,395
Because where you are, only the smartest survive.

859
01:26:47,188 --> 01:26:51,751
Tragic and powerful, but wrong.

860
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:57,555
We live... briefly... yes.

861
01:26:58,429 --> 01:27:01,080
Imperfectly? Of course.

862
01:27:01,908 --> 01:27:05,152
Stupidly? Sometimes.

863
01:27:06,309 --> 01:27:12,112
But we don't mind, because thats the way we're made.

864
01:27:13,589 --> 01:27:15,318
And when it's time to die

865
01:27:16,828 --> 01:27:21,117
we don't resist death, we summon it.

866
01:28:03,228 --> 01:28:08,189
This is not philosophy anymore.

867
01:28:10,228 --> 01:28:11,276
How are you here?

868
01:28:12,108 --> 01:28:13,269
I found a cave.

869
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:18,948
I went deep enough down

870
01:28:19,068 --> 01:28:23,551
to avoid the radiation, that I now see never came.

871
01:28:27,749 --> 01:28:31,389
After a few months, I lost track of time

872
01:28:34,988 --> 01:28:36,559
and then I heard you.

873
01:28:39,509 --> 01:28:41,910
I have one bullet left

874
01:28:43,188 --> 01:28:47,558
which I will use to kill you, if you need me to

875
01:28:49,429 --> 01:28:52,831
to stop you from committing an act so unreasonable

876
01:28:53,148 --> 01:28:55,515
it might end the human race.

877
01:30:16,509 --> 01:30:21,151
So, can I just say: a tip of the top hat to our boy Chips!

878
01:30:21,629 --> 01:30:24,633
You chose your love life over your actual life in that bunker.

879
01:30:24,828 --> 01:30:27,069
I saw it on your face when you made up your mind to go for the girl.

880
01:30:29,908 --> 01:30:33,390
Petra, I have the keys to the boat.

881
01:30:38,429 --> 01:30:40,032
Let's go, let's go!

882
01:30:48,228 --> 01:30:49,514
That did not fail to impress.

883
01:30:50,349 --> 01:30:52,555
You know what, that's not exactly what happened.

884
01:30:53,669 --> 01:30:54,670
We're listening.

885
01:30:54,868 --> 01:30:56,916
OK, so I ran a little thought experiment

886
01:30:57,028 --> 01:30:58,871
inside our thought experiment.

887
01:30:59,589 --> 01:31:02,559
I didn't think anyone would mind if I'd fiddle with things, just a bit.

888
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:04,956
And your thought experiment has hit what premise?

889
01:31:05,309 --> 01:31:07,470
What's the point of living if you can't have sex?

890
01:31:07,988 --> 01:31:09,036
Really!

891
01:31:09,309 --> 01:31:11,675
Yeah, I was just a sterile kid in a bunker

892
01:31:11,988 --> 01:31:14,674
everybody else was starting to pair up to save the human race

893
01:31:14,789 --> 01:31:18,679
sex for procreation only, so I would've been the odd man out.

894
01:31:19,709 --> 01:31:24,317
Or, I could be one man... with six women all to myself.

895
01:31:27,389 --> 01:31:31,599
So I found another uninhabited island outside the detonation zone...

896
01:31:31,749 --> 01:31:34,752
Hold it, I was on that boat too, what happened to me?

897
01:31:37,669 --> 01:31:38,750
Drowned.

898
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:43,750
And me?

899
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:45,755
Barracuda attack.

900
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:51,670
What about me?

901
01:31:52,188 --> 01:31:57,116
Ah Andy, the day that we arrived at the
new island, you had a run-in with a palm tree.

902
01:32:00,908 --> 01:32:03,719
You'd turned to bone by the end of the week because of your hideous disease.

903
01:32:04,188 --> 01:32:06,157
So it was just myself and the ladies.

904
01:32:08,309 --> 01:32:10,789
Me being a carpenter, I built a shelter

905
01:32:11,068 --> 01:32:12,229
we set up shop.

906
01:32:12,469 --> 01:32:16,871
Had a girl for each night of the week and on the seventh night, I rested.

907
01:32:17,509 --> 01:32:19,318
Um, excuse me, you're sterile.

908
01:32:19,429 --> 01:32:20,953
Why would we have sex with you at all?

909
01:32:21,228 --> 01:32:24,233
Ah, because that's the flip side of my thought experiment.

910
01:32:24,629 --> 01:32:25,960
What do you do if you're six girls

911
01:32:26,068 --> 01:32:28,197
and you need to start repopulating the human race?

912
01:32:28,349 --> 01:32:29,874
You've only got one man to work with...

913
01:32:29,988 --> 01:32:34,039
and he's infertile? You'd try, try and try again.

914
01:32:34,389 --> 01:32:36,710
Any specialist can tell you that in someone my age

915
01:32:36,828 --> 01:32:39,274
infertility is, more often than not, sub-fertility.

916
01:32:39,629 --> 01:32:41,710
Meaning: even if the odds are only one in a thousand,

917
01:32:41,828 --> 01:32:44,992
that I can get the job done. There's still a chance.

918
01:32:46,188 --> 01:32:48,634
So yeah, I had defective semen

919
01:32:48,749 --> 01:32:52,356
but in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.

920
01:32:55,948 --> 01:32:58,679
Well friends, I believe Chips has just settled the old question:

921
01:32:59,349 --> 01:33:01,955
Is philosophy to real life as masturbation is to sex?

922
01:33:02,828 --> 01:33:03,910
And the answer is?

923
01:33:05,148 --> 01:33:07,435
Sometimes you want to have a wank and a shag in the same day!

924
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:14,234
Six girls? That's nicely done.

925
01:33:15,268 --> 01:33:19,134
Just putting to good use my largest sex organ.

926
01:33:19,835 --> 01:33:21,434
My brain.

927
01:33:22,349 --> 01:33:23,474
Thanks for that, Chips.

928
01:33:29,228 --> 01:33:30,754
Don't forget to leave me your textbooks.

929
01:34:52,068 --> 01:34:53,149
You trouble me, Eric.

930
01:34:56,908 --> 01:34:59,036
Taking out your issues with me on James.

931
01:35:01,028 --> 01:35:02,633
Not your finest hour.

932
01:35:05,469 --> 01:35:06,993
He isn't smart enough for you.

933
01:35:10,669 --> 01:35:12,193
How can you still not see it?

934
01:35:13,228 --> 01:35:19,270
Being smart isn't everything. Has it done for you just what you hoped?

935
01:35:24,389 --> 01:35:30,395
Punishing him makes no sense. Because he doesn't know about us.

936
01:35:35,309 --> 01:35:36,799
I'm not sure he needs to know.

937
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:43,317
Especially after the way you behaved today.

938
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:56,557
I love him. So leave him alone.

939
01:36:02,068 --> 01:36:03,911
Guess that's why you didn't, hey?

940
01:36:06,828 --> 01:36:09,149
He just couldn't put all the pieces together.

941
01:36:12,268 --> 01:36:13,349
Who could?

942
01:36:22,188 --> 01:36:23,269
You.

943
01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:40,036
Nobody is trying to take anything away from you.

944
01:36:43,108 --> 01:36:44,951
I got mad at you about going to Cornell.

945
01:36:46,589 --> 01:36:48,238
I still don't understand how he got in.

946
01:36:50,068 --> 01:36:51,719
I wrote his essay for him.

947
01:36:54,669 --> 01:36:55,715
Did you?

948
01:36:57,429 --> 01:36:58,509
No.

949
01:37:05,389 --> 01:37:09,313
The winters are brutal in Ithaca. You'd be cold.

950
01:37:11,349 --> 01:37:12,839
I'll buy a sweater.

951
01:37:21,828 --> 01:37:23,035
You honestly believe

952
01:37:23,148 --> 01:37:25,515
the Jameses of this world can keep up with you?

953
01:37:27,948 --> 01:37:30,997
Only in a classroom of overachievers like this

954
01:37:31,549 --> 01:37:34,758
could anyone possibly accuse him of being inadequate.

955
01:37:44,309 --> 01:37:46,277
You want me to skip college?

956
01:37:47,669 --> 01:37:52,595
And stay in Jakarta? Is that what you're asking me to do?

957
01:37:53,828 --> 01:37:58,197
There are some outstanding universities in this city.

958
01:38:02,669 --> 01:38:06,151
Can you imagine how good we'd be for each other?

959
01:38:11,549 --> 01:38:12,630
Yes.

960
01:38:19,509 --> 01:38:21,318
But you do know that can't happen.

961
01:38:26,389 --> 01:38:27,389
Of course I know.

962
01:39:24,429 --> 01:39:26,670
Do you know what "apocalypse" actually means?

963
01:39:28,589 --> 01:39:29,635
Tell me.

964
01:39:31,868 --> 01:39:32,995
It's from the Greek.

965
01:39:33,988 --> 01:39:40,951
<i>Apokalypsis</i>, meaning: to uncover what you couldn't see before.

966
01:39:43,429 --> 01:39:44,794
A way out of the dark.

967
01:39:54,789 --> 01:39:56,678
Your sweet talk still needs work.

968
01:40:01,669 --> 01:40:02,795
I'll get on that.

969
01:40:10,828 --> 01:40:12,593
You're a very good teacher, Eric.

970
