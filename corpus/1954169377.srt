00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,597
Are you ready?

2
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,336
Ready.

3
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,807
Kingdom called Samarza.
Samarza.

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,411
The King's bloodline.

5
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,321
King's family...

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,360
...must die.

7
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,928
Present day

8
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,994
Present Day
Kingdom of Samarza - Located in the Himalayas

9
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:20,036
A young soldier accompanies the King
during the last days of peace

10
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,004
Adam, ride next to me.

11
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,701
Your Majesty,
I'm just a soldier.

12
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,338
I could never ride next to you.

13
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,679
Adam , some day you'll make a 
fine soldier.

14
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,413
Some are born great.

15
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,723
Some achieve greatness.

16
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:11,357
And some have greatness trust
upon them.

17
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,436
October 10th , the United Nations

18
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,745
has rejected our need for help

19
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,048
Our situation becomes desperate
with every hour.

20
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,117
In a few days ,
The Skanji Empire

21
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,684
will unleash their entire fleet.

22
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,390
Today they send the taste 
of their wrath.

23
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,879
I am paralyzed of disbelief.

24
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,513
A part of me dies inside.

25
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,229
Their war is to eliminate our kind

26
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,288
and rule over our land.

27
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,692
We have no means of fighting back.

28
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,794
We are not violent people.

29
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,010
Nadia was born into culture

30
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,741
where women were treated like animals.

31
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,306
beaten and discarded.

32
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,114
She was thrown into world
of violence.

33
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,213
And the only way to survive

34
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,259
was to be stronger , smarter...

35
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,795
to kill.

36
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,524
He was ordered to assassinate our king.

37
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,033
and all the heirs to our throne

38
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,070
One by one , the heirs fell..

39
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,332
Until only the king remained...

40
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,344
...my poor king.

41
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,642
breathing his last breath , 

42
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,183
in my arms.

43
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,481
I know without the heir to
the throne

44
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:17,045
The Skanjis will forever rule us

45
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,451
But then he whispers

46
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,926
one hope,

47
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,363
One child, in a far away land.

48
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:35,699
Nadia sets out for this land

49
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,576
to kill this remaining heir.

50
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,786
I am Adam Arthavan

51
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,297
An ordinary soldier 
in king's army.

52
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,197
what makes ME special

53
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,601
Is the king spoke this final
words to me .

54
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,867
Adam, come closer.

55
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,374
listen carefully 

56
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,308
the great duty.

57
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,347
The last hope is upon you.

58
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,646
You are ours people only hope.

59
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,744
protect my last

60
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,312
remaining child.

61
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,484
The last princess.

62
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:36,429
NINJA'S CREED

63
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,413
National Cathedral, WASHlNGTON DC
To save the princess,

64
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:25,144
I must first start by finding the
royal maid.

65
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,618
Only she would know the location

66
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,382
of her Highness.

67
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:33,391
A royal maid to the Abassi Kingdom.

68
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,791
RIGHT LANE EXIT ONLY

69
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:56,239
Sorry , business or pleasure?

70
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,235
Pleasure.

71
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,443
Some girl I know is going to die.

72
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:05,634
Best friends , friends forever...

73
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,714
Katie,
second grade,

74
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,308
she is so hot.

75
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,048
- dude she is so hot.
- oh hell no.

76
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,989
- Andrea.
- hey look it's Jan.

77
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,356
- Heads up.
- she's gonna catch it.

78
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,226
Oh yes , did you see that?

79
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,392
You know the one with the 
Jean-Luc Picard?

80
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,368
The dude who is the captain.
You know what I'm talking about?

81
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,462
BUt Jean-Luc Picard is bald.

82
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,303
Haven't you ever thought:
Why is this guy bald?''

83
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,310
I mean they are like 1000 years
into future and the guy is bald.

84
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,938
I mean wouldn't they come up with
some kind of oil or soemthing

85
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,108
to cure baldness by then?

86
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,210
Why? You losing hair aligator?

87
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,723
What? I'm sorry what did you say?

88
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:58,320
Is it receiding on the side
or at the top?

89
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,059
...the game.
That's how we do it.

90
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,693
- You know.
- Alright man.

91
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,135
See ya.

92
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,174
- Jim is coming over tonight.
- you're like his next thing?

93
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,641
He broke up with Amy like
three weeks ago.

94
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,542
- You still wanna go to the mall?
- No.

95
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,911
I wanna buy this really cute blue 
halter top.

96
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,610
- I really need to take a shower.
- Shower later.

97
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,379
You said you wanna get 
your nails done.

98
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,647
No way.

99
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,387
What are you doing?

100
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,257
What are YOU doing?

101
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,228
There are people, they can see you.

102
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,424
Yeah well you won't let me
smoke in your room.

103
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,024
It's your move.

104
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,593
- How's Jan?
- Good.

105
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,764
Just good?

106
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,332
I can't help but think she is
missing out though you know?

107
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,470
I mean , she can't say things 
to me , her dad.

108
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,514
But she might say to her mom,
right?

109
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,447
Doug, you're great dad.

110
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,281
You don't wanna her the things
she says to her mom.

111
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,548
She's a teenage girl.

112
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,716
- What do we have here?
- Don't.

113
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,462
Come on,let's hear it.
Doug, it's the rules.

114
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,693
Come on, let's hear it.

115
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,727
You are the champion.

116
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:50,167
Thought that the real maid
was older.

117
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,800
Excuse me?

118
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,471
You've mistaken me for 
someone else.

119
00:11:55,748 --> 00:12:03,655
The King always felt threatened 
by the evil Skanji Empire...

120
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,523
so I was afraid
constantly that ...

121
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:14,795
one day his family could
be eliminated.

122
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:20,703
Then, 17 years ago
secretly ...

123
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:25,210
gave his seventh child
for adoption ...

124
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:29,873
to ''American Guardian''.

125
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:36,047
The princess grew up as an
American

126
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:40,081
never knowing
her royal descent.

127
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:47,594
And only one person in our 
country

128
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,966
know the whereabouts of the 
princess ...

129
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,234
a Real maid

130
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,468
You.

131
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,378
The King always felt threatened 
by the evil Skanji Empire

132
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,186
I came to protect
the Princess.

133
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,314
You must feel so special

134
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,915
with what you know now.

135
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,462
Rest assured, the princess is safe.

136
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,627
Only the American guardian
knows where she is.

137
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,227
The American guardian is now 
her father.

138
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,933
Only he should be concerned 
with her safety.

139
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,000
No one else will ever find out

140
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,307
Who she really is.

141
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,043
That is an oath I gave to his 
Majesty,

142
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,451
An oath I will never break.

143
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:50,655
Especialmente no por
un soldado COMUN.

144
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,924
I thank you for your time.

145
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:15,315
We have a trouble.
We have a big problem.

146
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,659
How could this have happened?

147
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,027
Dad you rock.

148
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,967
Because I promised

149
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,768
she is gonna move upside.

150
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,867
Do me a favour.

151
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,377
Yes.

152
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,656
The American guardian.

153
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,697
One of the king's soldiers just
visited me in the chappel.

154
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,034
He could be working with 
the Skanji army.

155
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,335
We need to involve the police.

156
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,968
You must tell her who she is.

157
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,137
It's very important that Jan
doesn't know.

158
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,975
She get's worried for nothing.

159
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,983
You know. -I know , I also know
that you care so much for her

160
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,746
but circumstances have just changed.

161
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,083
I know but I don't want her life 
turn upisde down.

162
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,713
You put her to great risk.

163
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,487
Do you have any idea what Nadia
is capable of?

164
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,761
Do you have any idea

165
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,566
what Nadia did to the king's family

166
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,436
in Samarza?

167
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,102
I'm giving you one hour

168
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,875
to tell her who she really is,

169
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,007
and then I'm calling the police.

170
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,538

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,237

- GET OUT.

181
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,296
Oh I'm sorry.

182
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,206
Sorry I didn't know you 
were naked.

183
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,870
Dad I'm not naked.

184
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,274
You're not going out are you ?

185
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,249
I'm a big girl now.

186
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,615
Chill out because I'm not 
going out now , okey?

187
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,449
Good , we can play Boggle.

188
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,047
No, Jim is coming over.

189
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,622
Cute Jim?

190
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,131
- I didn't know you find guys cute.
- Uhm.

191
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,634

00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,973
dad , I bet you will be like this

193
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,134
even when I am 30 years old,
aren't you?

194
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,777
An international news,
there is growing concern

195
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,943
in the entire region of south Asia

196
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,715
as Samarza is the second country

197
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,222
the Skanji empire has invaded

198
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,918
within the last six months.

199
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,453
Now we've got all that clear.

200
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:23,232
And without a living heir to
the kingdom of Samarza,,

201
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:27,500
The people have no choice but
to accept this brutal regime.

202
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,448
- Jan?
- Hey.

203
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,617
My friend has just came down
from LA.

204
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,389
- Where are you?
- Quit fooling around man.

205
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,327
What are you doing?
I'm on the phone.

206
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,525
Sorry. Anyways,
Should spend some time with them.

207
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,831
Oh , err , are you both getting
come over?

208
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,531
Do you mind if we do this
another time?

209
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,267
Cuz we are just gonna chill out
and do the guys thing you know.

210
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,536
- You know how it is.
- Ah, yeah.

211
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,202
Yes of course, it's not a problem.

212
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,712
- Okay,cool. See ya.
- Hello?

213
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,054
Maybe if you were blonde.

214
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,998
Two women and one child are now
confirmed dead

215
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,006
in the park Bethesda murders.

216
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,838
We still do not know if police
have any leads.

217
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,244
Doug, you're great dad.

218
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,248
She is a teenage girl.

219
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,716
You don't wanna hear the things
she would say to her mom.

220
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,245
I'm teaching her how to play.

221
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,449
You're teaching her how to play?
That's so good.

222
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,321
Come on.
Come on this way.

223
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,453
She's pretty good for a beginner
isn't she?

224
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,929
- Yes.
- Yes she is.

225
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,104
with the killer still at large

226
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,942
Police are advising all residents
of Bethesda

227
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,245
to take basic precautions

228
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,649
and Immediately report
any suspicios activity.

229
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,416
We're gonna take a break,we're 
out of the news.

230
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,716
Don't go away , we'll be
right back.

231
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,652
Run to the window.
Come on, run.

232
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,978
Go.

233
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,715
Run.

234
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,797
I know you're scared but you
must be brave.

235
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,805
I'm here to protect you.

236
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,302
you do not know

237
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,940
who you are.

238
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,416
Look, you've got the 
wrong person.

239
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,975
I have the right person.

240
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,817
You are the King's seventh child...

241
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,254
The only living heir

242
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,058
to the Abassi dinasty.

243
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,693
I'm not what you think I am.

244
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,292
Who are you?

245
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,235
Who are you?

246
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,136
- Please. No.
- Please calm down.

247
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,839
At your right leg you have
birthmark, resembling a heart.

248
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,075
Let me go.

249
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,346
Only the real princess has
that birthmark.

250
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,421
I have to go to the bathroom.

251
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,040
Stay close to me.

252
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,116
It's safe.

253
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,559
I will be outside.

254
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,303
What the hell do I do?

255
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,577
911, what is your emergency?

256
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,741
Connect me to the 
police department.

257
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,060
The police are on their way.
Trust me.

258
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,965
You're going to need their help.

259
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,301
The person who attacked you is
an assassin.

260
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,206
Her name is Nadia.

261
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,836
And she has never failed a mission.

262
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,541
But you managed to escape 
from her.

263
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,480
Do you know why?

264
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,712
Cuz you are not an opponent
to her.

265
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,052
You're a pray.

266
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,397
She doesn't want just, kill you.

267
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,066
She wants to enjoy it..

268
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,400
So if you want to go out there,

269
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,637
alone...

270
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,736
Go.

271
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:12,180
Or you can stay with me

272
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,241
if you want to live.

273
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,666
If you do not believe me,

274
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,764
call your american father.

275
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,574
Please leave a message
after the signal.

276
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,347
Dad, pick up the phone.

277
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,354
I'll get back , just don't 
freak out, okey?

278
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:54,550
I was attacked at home.
All the windows are broken.

279
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,617
I just didn't know what to do.

280
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,685
I didn't know where you were.

281
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,254
I'm safe , okey?

282
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,495
Just come and get me.

283
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,163
I'm at 1.200th block of 
the Massachussets Av.

284
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,907
I am Adam Arthavan.

285
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:17,414
I was sent by his Majesty,
Niaz Abassi II,

286
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,949
To protect you.

287
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,781
If you want to evade such
injuries,

288
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:28,815
listen to me carefully.
You are from Samarza.

289
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,729
I'm at 1.200th block of 
the Massachussets Av...

290
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,702
I'm at 1.200th block of 
the Massachussets Av...

291
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,407
The assassin that tried to kill
you belongs to this tribe.

292
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,571
This has what to do with me?

293
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,750
5 days ago,

294
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,220
they attacked the palace

295
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,450
and killed your entite family.

296
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,598
Princess, our people have
lost all hope.

297
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,763
But if they knew an Abassi 
were alive...

298
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,038
it would give them the momentum

299
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,841
and the heart to fight back.

300
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,781
You have royal blood.

301
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,480
And that symbol is more powerful
than an entire army.

302
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,489
How did you know...

303
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,082
about my birthmark?

304
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,552
I found the king just
before he died.

305
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,532
In those moments ,
he told me everything

306
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,864
about you.

307
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,433
Look, I'm not a princess or,
whatever.

308
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,970
I'm just an ordinary girl.

309
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,014
Well, ordinary girl,

310
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,414
Some achieve greatness.

311
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,414
And some heave greatness
trusted uppon them.

312
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,966
Your father was more than
just a king to me.

313
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,182
Your Highness.

314
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,354
Restricted area

00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,636

Stay here.

317
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,849
Okay.

318
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,176

00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,216
- Take out your guns.

323
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,255
You don't understand.

00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,656
- Listen to my orders.
- take a step back.

325
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,524
Put your hands on the wall. Turn around
and put your hands on the wall, sir..

326
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,086
The building is closed in 
this after hours.

327
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,825
I don't need questioning.
What are you doing here?

328
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,129
Take a deep breath and calm down.

329
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,567
- Freeze.
- Now put your hands slowly...

330

No...

351
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,481
The king entrusted me with a task

352
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:12,147
greater than you or me.

353
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,056
That is all that I know.

But I don't want you to 
be anywhere near.

357
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,134
Listen to me.

358
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,436
Take this road and go to

359
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,909
other white building down
the street.

360
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,641
I will bring your american
father to you.

361
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,581
Do what he would want you to do.

362
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,394
The Leaders of the Skanji empire

363
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:03,133
consist of the handful of ruthless 
military generals.

364
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,801
Political analysts have
predicted

365
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,640
that if the Skanji Empire is able

366
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,181
to establish it's rule
in Samarza,

367
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,547
It will immediately strike at the
neighbouring countries.

368
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,451
of Myanmar, Bután
and Nepal.

369
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,115
Thus far , the USA

370
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,718
is the country which has 
demanded Skanji Empire

371
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,024
withdraw from Samarza

372
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,497
and all other occupying 
territories.

373
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,497
You don't want to 
wake him up.

374
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,612
Aviation 3.
I think this area is clear.

375
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,089
Just a little smoke
nothing more.

376
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,127
not much movement.

377
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,900
Alfa 1, return to the site
of explosion.

378
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,799
They need you out there.
Over.

379
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,985
Jan. listen to me.

380
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,747
You are special.

381
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,459
A wise man once told me

382
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,553
some are born great,

383
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,963
some achieve greatness,

384
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:14,095
and some have greatness
trusted upon them.

385
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,469
I have to go now.

386
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:22,205
It's very important

387
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,081
Samarza.

388
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:27,709
Princess?

389
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,916
Princess?

390
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,030
If you look hard enough ...

391
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,473
Only if you look hard enough ...

392
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,405
you'll find what you're s
earching for.

393
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,390
Adam, talk to me.

394
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,093
Ah you have something going on

395
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,761
in that pretty little head 
of yours.

396
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,566
How you know my name?

397
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,976
How come you're not here, ha?

398
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:55,142
Let me ask you somethin , what 
you work here?

399
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,449
I locked up the exhibition room.

400
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,492
How you know my name?

401
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,357
Are you serious?

402
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,124
See you tomorrow, Adam.

403
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:20,837
- Princess.
- Where's my dad?

404
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,141
- We have to go , we have to go now.
- Where's my dad?

405
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,078
- Just tell me. There is no time.

406
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,481
Answer me.

407
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,282
He's on his way here.

408
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,121
- Princess, we have to go.
- Why did king give me up?

409
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,287
Why did he give up?

410
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,198
Why?

411
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:47,533
His Majesty did not give you up.

412
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:52,032
He sent you on a journey,
for a reason.

413
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,440
And that reason is gonna save 
our people.

414
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,561
How is she finding us?

415
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:17,122
- We must go.
- No.

416
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,316
Go, give me your hand.
Come on, give me your hand.

417
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:37,853
I cannot run any more.

418
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:42,221
The Skanji Empire
will rule Samarza.

419
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:46,023
But first, your princess
must die.

420
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,996
I'm sorry, I wish I could
be stronger.

421
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,693
Princess, we have to go now.

422
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,497
Please, I'm sorry but I can't.

423
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,037
OK.

424
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,607
No more running.

425
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,443
Are you disappointed in me?

426
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,208
Close your eyes.

427
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,341
- What?
- Close your eyes.

428
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,511
At times, even I thought I 
could not go on.

429
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,080
I could not go on.

430
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,990
Looking at you now,

431
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,088
I see your courage.

432
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,264
I see Samarza's heart.

433
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:35,872
I see that I must end this.

434
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,007
Now.

435
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,982
For freedom.

436
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,766
My father was a blacksmith.

437
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,035
I tested every sword he ever made.

438
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,554
Leave and I will let you live.

439
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:25,183
Fight and you will surely die.

440
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,760
You betrayed the King.

441
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:32,268
You do not know what happened.

442
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,803
Look at what you've become.

443
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,362
You do not know what happened.

444
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,671
For what?

445
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:43,611
You do not know what happened!

446
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,681
What happened, then?

447
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:54,122
You are pure evil.

448
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,417
Impressive...

449
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,921
You are going to find out
what happened...

450
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,452
Very soon.

451
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,436
It's beautiful.

452
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,917
My next strike, won't be 
beautiful.

453
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,415
Dammit.

454
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,983
Adam,

455
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:38,517
the line between good and evil

456
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:42,793
is so blurred.

457
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:50,873
Sometimes you can barely see it.

458
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,694
- Boom.
- Adam.

459
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,942
It's over.

460
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,217
Oh, God.

461
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,935
Wait, what ...?

462
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,945
- Something's wrong.

463
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,810
Adam!

464
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:11,858
?

465
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,382
Answer me.

466
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,216
What does Nadia look like?

467
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:35,356
Answer me.

468
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:50,132
The line between good and evil

469
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:53,073
is so blurred.

470
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,270
How is she finding us?

471
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,940
You do not know what happened.

472
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:02,507
She was ordered to 
assassinate our king.

473
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,018
My poor king

474
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,180
breathing his last breath.

475
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,986
...to assassinate our king...

476
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:12,459
There's one girl I know.

477
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,828
Some girl I know is going to die.

478
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,876
Wait, what?

479
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:09,945
Run , run...

480
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,647
Go.
RUN!!!

481
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,190
RUN!!!
JUST RUN!!!

482
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,356
Why?

483
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,128
Why?

484
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,733
Wake up.

485
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,000
Yes, Adam.

486
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:21,245
I am you

487
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:24,184
and you are me.

488
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,783
together , we are

489
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,054
the perfect weapon.

490
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:36,827
You killed the king.

491
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:40,232
You killed his family.

492
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,795
You killed his family.

493
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,331
Ironic, isn't it Adam?

494
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:51,005
Now we must finish our mission.

495
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:00,545
Adamn, ready?

496
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,673
You do not exist.

497
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:23,071
No.

498
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,164
Princess.

499
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:32,605
Adam.
What are you doing?

500
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:39,039
Adam.
What are you doing?

501
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:04,298
Adam, wait a minute.
Adam.

502
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,500
Adam, stop.

503
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,904
Why?

504
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:18,518
Wait.
Adam.

505
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,682
Adam, please.

506
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:39,234
Dad.

507
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,771
Jan, where's my kiss?

508
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,712
Dad, I'll give you two later.

509
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,030
I told you to give two later.

510
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:36,148
Just beautiful.

511
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:39,593
The assassin.
Just beautiful.

512
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:44,429
Well done, Nadia.

513
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:49,996
Thank you, Great General.

514
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,267
The Empire is Skanji
proud of you.

515
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:57,271
Salutations to Skanji Empire.

516
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:05,944
Empire send me a mission.

517
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:12,884
I give the orders to good Adam.

518
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:17,661
He does not remember what I say,
but you summoned ...
...

519
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:20,065
The evil Nadia.

520
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:24,004
Combine good with evil...

521
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:27,406
the perfect weapon.

522
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:33,005
One day the Empire will
dominate the world.

523
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:36,677
Go, cleanse your soul.

524
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:26,033
Adam...

525
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:30,436
For now, forget everything 
from last night..

526
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,100
Forget... forget...

527
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:36,110
Forget...
Forget...

528
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:46,645
6 hours later

529
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:50,748
Forget everything

530
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:53,852
since last night.

531
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,050
A massive explosion
rocked Washington D.C.

532
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:53,088
at 2:1 3 AM.
The explosion originated

533
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:56,318
in the University building
on Massachusetts Avenue.

534
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,724
Firefighters are
currently fighting

535
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:02,252
residual fire that was
caused by the explosion.

536
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:06,597
Ffficers of the Washington DC
police department

537
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,830
were involved in shootout
just before explosion occured.

538
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,498
All five officers present at that time
are confirmed

539
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:13,804
dead.

540
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:17,676
A single father was killed in his 
house late last night.

541
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:19,577
The police are still unclear

542
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,843
if this murder was related...

543
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,620
Those paintings are so cool 
uncle Rochy.

544
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:35,630
It's an exhibition.

545
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,030
You know, the art, the culture,

546
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,728
the entire whole experience...

547
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:42,134
Hey, boss.
Sorry to disturb you,

548
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:44,069
but that security guard is 
on the phone.

549
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,300
He sounds really depressed.

550
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:50,305
Rochester speaking.

551
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:53,906
Hey boss, I don't think I'm 
coming today.

552
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:55,917
Alright.
What happened?

553
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,044
I bruised my shoulder a 
little bit.

554
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,486
I went to the doctor and he 
said it's sleepwalking.

555
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,251
You hurt yourself before you know.

556
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,189
It was also sleepwalking right?

557
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,852
I should be fine.

558
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,021
In next coupple of days 
I'll come in.

559
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,564
Answer me something.

560
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,998
What do you work here , 
in my building?

561
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:14,865
It's monday.

562
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,303
You wake up in the morning,
you brush your teeth

563
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,432
take a quick cup of coffe,

564
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,169
Go to your job.

565
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:24,007
And I know you had many better
career options,

566
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:27,014
but you continue to stay here,
why?

567
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:29,209
I like being security guard.

568
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:32,413
Boss, I'm not the type of guy

569
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,184
who wants to save the world.

570
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:42,956
The bag number one there..
is 678.

571
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,159
678. Let me fix
this belt.

572
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,225
A single father was killed at
his house

573
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,134
late last night.

574
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:51,468
the police are still unclear if
this murder

575
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:54,634
was related to Massachussetts 
Av. building,

576
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:57,873
which occured only half a mile
from the murdered man house.

577
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,378
The victim is teenage daughter, is 
still missing

578
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:09,049
and the police  are not discarding the
possibility of kidnapping.

579
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:30,042
11th century: 'An extraordinary 
life'' by Pär Olofsson

580
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:11,008
Security Identification

581
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:22,256
So majestic.

582
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:28,897
Extraordinary.

583
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,051
Come on ,darling.
Let's go.

584
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,109
- Thank you.
- Hey boss.

585
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,451
Oh you're back.

586
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:50,117
Hey Kathy. Did you see all these
wonderful paintings?

587
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:52,092
- Yeah.
- Did you have a good time?

588
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:55,358
Yeah ,you should see new Colieans.

589
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:59,197
Yeah, that are new copies from India,
beautiful.

590
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,395
Kathy, you know,
kings, queens,

591
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,335
princes and princesses ...

592
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,396
I wish we had them
in America.

593
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:08,637
I wish I was a princess.

594
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:12,202
There are no more princesses.

595
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,272
But you are as pretty as princess.

596
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:18,610
Listen, Adam, I wanted to tell you.

597
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:21,087
Do not take it personally
what I said

598
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:23,021
the other day by telephone,
OK?

599
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,888
I mean, I do that.

600
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,121
I say things I should not.

601
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:30,996
It is not my business to get into,
so please forgive me.

602
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:34,593
Boss, err, you believe 
too much in me.

603
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,867
But I know it's because you
care for me.

604
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:41,273
So I don't mind,

605
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:43,243
you know,
you get personal.

606
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:46,480
Thank you.

607
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:50,549
- Bye.
- Bye.

608
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:04,296
I told him I am not the
type of guy

609
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,199
that want's to save the world.

610
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,132
I lied.

611
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:18,637
My life is every man's 
biggest fear,

612
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:23,543
To be ordinary.

613
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:07,061
No, stop, stop.

614
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:15,630
Stop.

615
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:43,563
I know her.
I know her.

616
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:45,691
How could...?

617
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:51,263
The cathe... the cathedral.
The cathedral.

618
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,706
The cathedral.
I was there.

619
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,800
I was looking for someone.

620
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:58,903
Something about the painting.

621
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:02,109
I really believed that 
the kindgom was real.

622
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:03,879
The kingdom needed to
be saved.

623
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,978
Save this realm ...
Princess, Nadia ...

624
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:08,545
was real.

625
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,457
I imagined that I was 
the assassin.

626
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:16,287
Visited a royal maid.

627
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:21,502
I followed her.I remember I 
followed her to the park.

628
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,066
Wait, wait.

629
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:29,372
There was no maid.

630
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:34,838
But there was a man.

631
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,941
He was not my imagination.

632
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:42,287
He wasn't talking to anyone.

633
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:48,057
He was...
I followed the man

634
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,564
who led me to...

635
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,034
an ordinary girl.

636
01:17:54,102 --> 01:17:57,265
How did you know
about my birthmark??

637
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,410
What did I do?

638
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,372
Why you look so sad?

639
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:40,108
It's like you lost 
something precious.

640
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:46,751
Adam.

641
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,550
Are you ready?

642
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,293
- No.
- are you ready,

643
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:03,963
Adam Arthavan?

644
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,667
I killed her.
I killed her.

645
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:20,682
... ready to become
a great warrior?

646
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:25,819
And a great murderer.
What could be more great?

647
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:29,584
Save the only hope
of our people.

648
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,819
My life

649
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:34,691
is the greatest fear
of every man.

650
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:37,163
To be...

651
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,027
Ordinary.

652
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:48,098
2 HOURS LATER

653
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,703
