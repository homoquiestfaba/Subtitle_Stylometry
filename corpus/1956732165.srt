1
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,879
Go ahead.

2
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,234
Man: If I had gotten a real game, I wouldn't win anyway.

3
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,410
- Woman: ...Which is $8.
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:32,064
And then, you know,
the rates are reflected...

5
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,383
Bartender.

6
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:51,649
You grab
for that holster

7
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:54,217
and I'll put a bullet
through your skull.

8
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,219
What business
you got with me?

9
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:59,222
- Are you Preston reddon?
- That's me.

10
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:02,094
I hear you're the best
gunslinger around.

11
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:04,227
Are you challenging me?

12
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,924
No.

13
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,578
But I'm gonna
kill you.

14
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,279
Listen up.

15
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,324
I'm Robert ally,

16
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:17,109
the first
of the four horsemen
of the apocalypse.

17
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:20,025
Dogma's now my town.

18
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,898
Anybody got
a problem with me

19
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:25,379
or what I just did,

20
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:28,599
then draw
your pistols now.

21
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,082
I didn't think so.

22
00:03:56,714 --> 00:04:00,109
Ah. How about
a little game of stud?

23
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:02,372
Oh, that's something
I can live with.

24
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,593
How about let's start
it off with a cigar?

25
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,335
Yeah, that sounds great.

26
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,209
Thank you, sir.

27
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:30,313
I didn't say
you could sit there.

28
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,837
And I didn't ask.

29
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:35,100
You got a problem
with me, boy?

30
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,320
"Boy"?!

31
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,801
You better choose
a better word, son.

32
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,891
Or what?

33
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:47,243
Or else you're gonna
end up like that poor soul
over there on the floor.

34
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,158
That's some
of my handiwork.

35
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:52,161
So you're Robert ally?

36
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:55,382
Are you a marshal?

37
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,994
I hate marshals.

38
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:01,301
And I hate scum like you.

39
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:04,304
All right, that's enough.
Either you get up
and get out of here

40
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,262
or we're going to war.

41
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:09,352
So how about you
present me with this war,

42
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:11,572
and I'll show you
a lesson in death.

43
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,530
Okay, poncho.

44
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:44,344
Who-- who are you?

45
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:49,610
Leon copper.

46
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,530
Mister, we don't want
no trouble.

47
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:59,271
I ain't here
to cause you no trouble.

48
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,578
But you do know there's
three more of those outlaws

49
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,493
coming into this town,
don't you?

50
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:05,147
What you mean by that?

51
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,062
Well, I'm a bounty hunter.

52
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:09,194
The name's Leon copper.

53
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:11,675
And that son of a bitch
over there on the floor

54
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,503
is one of four outlaws
that come in

55
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:16,158
and take over little small towns
just like this one.

56
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,942
They hit gordo,

57
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:20,380
a town just north of here,
about three weeks ago.

58
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,558
So you're telling me there
are three more on the way?

59
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,735
That's exactly what
I'm telling you.

60
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:31,042
Usually the first one
comes in,

61
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,436
kills out all
the gunslingers in town.

62
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,700
The second one comes in,
takes over the marshal's office.

63
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:39,747
And the third one'll
come in and take over
the supply store.

64
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,446
I guess that one right there
come in and took over this bar.

65
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:46,580
So when are these other
three coming?

66
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:48,973
Sometimes they come
back to back,

67
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:50,845
but you never know.

68
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:53,369
But I've been paid
$500 a head

69
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,590
and I just got my first one
out of that bastard
right over there.

70
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,156
Mister,
I appreciate that.

71
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,898
I'm not looking for appreciation.

72
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:03,727
I don't give a shit about
this shithole town.

73
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:36,151
Parker's always sleeping.
You're always reading.

74
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:38,153
- How come?
- It keeps me informed.

75
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,590
Landon, I'm worried
about Robert.

76
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:42,549
Probably ain't
sent the message yet.

77
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:45,073
If it don't come by tomorrow,
I'll send Parker.

78
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:48,555
Maybe if the signal
doesn't come, the two of us go.

79
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,731
Then we risk having
all of us taken out.

80
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,560
- We stick to the plan.
- Remember the job
we did in gordo?

81
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:56,214
- Yeah.
- I got shot.

82
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,521
Well, that wasn't planned
as well as dogma.

83
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,741
We are not invincible.

84
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:03,047
I'm solid as a brick wall!

85
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:05,920
Well, Landon, I'm not.

86
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,532
Don't worry about it.
Get some sleep.

87
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,145
Watch your step now.
Don't step on sleeping beauty.

88
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,717
Y'all need some help getting
that roof framed up,
let me know.

89
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,200
- Hey, Dr. Wiley.
- Hi, frank.

90
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,637
- What you building?
- Uh, my new office.

91
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,726
- Kinda big, isn't it?
- Yeah,

92
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,423
the doctor's office
is gonna be there

93
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,469
and the undertaker's office
is gonna be over there.

94
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,210
Take 'em dead
or alive, huh?

95
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,517
I'd rather have them living,
frank, that way they
keep coming back.

96
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,780
That's good business.
Good to see you, doc.

97
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,695
Later, frank.

98
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:58,799
- Ma, ma!
- Slow down, slow down,
what is it?

99
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:00,409
The town...

100
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:02,193
What are you trying
to say?

101
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:04,674
The town...

102
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:08,417
There was
a gunfight yesterday.

103
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,984
Two men got killed.

104
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:12,682
I sent you to town for flour
and you come back with this?

105
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,729
I'll get the flour. They're on their way.

106
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,426
Sit down,
tell me the news.

107
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:20,560
I met Mr. Spellings.

108
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,475
He told me about
this bounty hunter,

109
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,261
he killed this bandit.
The bandit killed

110
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,697
Preston reddon first.

111
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:30,613
Preston reddon?
He was a decent man!

112
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,484
Who'd want to kill him?

113
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:36,358
I don't know, mama.
M-maybe, uh...

114
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,578
It was over gambling
or something like that.

115
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,928
You see, you see!
Look what that teaches you.

116
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,712
You stay out of that,
you hear me?

117
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,627
I know, I know, mama.

118
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,632
- Who's this, mama?
- This is Jane carmall

119
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:52,548
and her uncle.
He's leaving her here
with us for a few days.

120
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,725
- Nice to meet you, Jane.
- Nice to meet you too.

121
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,510
I don't think I heard
a name though.

122
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:04,386
I forgot that part.
W-- William.

123
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:06,562
- I'm William.
- Pleased to meet you.

124
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,347
Go wash up.
Supper's almost ready.

125
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,095
Looks like you're living
in the past.

126
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:03,793
Hell, that war's been
over with for 10 years.

127
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:06,274
Sometime all you got
to live for is the past.

128
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,235
I guess so, but all I got
to live for is the future.

129
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,673
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I am.

130
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:16,501
Frank.
Frank spellings.

131
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,460
My wife Patricia.

132
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,592
Nice to meet you.

133
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:22,333
Nice to meet you too.
What's your name?

134
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,205
The name's Leon.

135
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,253
I'm looking
to buy some arsenal.

136
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:30,820
What do you got?

137
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:32,343
Well, I've got colts,

138
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:35,607
shotguns.
I've got a .45 handgun.

139
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:37,871
I got something that I think
you'll be interested in.

140
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,965
I got something here
that'll kill them dead
in their tracks.

141
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,837
Killed a lot of Yankees
with that gun right there.

142
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:55,236
- You got some ammo
for this gun?
- Sure do.

143
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,892
I'll take it.

144
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,851
So how was the war?

145
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,636
Well, according to them
damn Yankees, we lost.

146
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,726
Yeah, what I recall.

147
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,207
What else
can I get you?

148
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,948
That'll be all.

149
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,737
You're a long way
from home, ain't you?

150
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,782
Yeah.
Peace and quiet
makes up for it.

151
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,351
That's all about to change.

152
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:25,962
You're not fixing to cause
any trouble, are you?

153
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:29,487
Look, I don't want to be here
no more than you want me
to be here.

154
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,794
Why don't you just
get your stuff

155
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,274
and be on your way?

156
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,493
What do I owe?

157
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:38,801
You don't owe me nothing.
I hear you're hunting outlaws.

158
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:41,064
Just shoot one of those
outlaws for me.

159
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,722
Sounds like a deal.

160
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,945
By the way, you know
a place I can rest up?

161
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:54,077
Katherine's,
out by the horse farm.

162
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:56,297
Just a couple miles
outside of town.

163
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,821
Decent price,
good food too.

164
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,823
Thank you.
I'll head that way.

165
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,760
- This your place?
- It is.

166
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,851
Well, I won't be
staying long.

167
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:32,202
Are you that
bounty hunter?

168
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,204
Yes ma'am.

169
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,861
I was only asking.

170
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,305
Do I know you?

171
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:50,090
I don't play that game.

172
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,309
Know how many times
I've gotten that?

173
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:55,051
Oh, I don't mean
to offend you.

174
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:57,793
I won't be here long.
I'll be out of your hair.

175
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,975
Would your name be Leon?

176
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,109
Leon copper,
to be precise?

177
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,156
Katherine?

178
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,767
Oh my goodness.

179
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:18,335
I thought you died.

180
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,731
No, ever since
I left that day,

181
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,081
I've been
traveling the west.

182
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:29,085
Well, enjoy your stay.

183
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,264
I think he's
in trouble, Landon.

184
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:37,267
He's supposed to pay someone
to deliver a message.

185
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,443
What's the plan?

186
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:41,358
Go investigate.

187
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,883
I want jarson
to come on in.

188
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,407
- I'm ready for this
to be our last job.
- Listen to me!

189
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,757
Before you know it
we'll be rich and free.

190
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,716
- I hope so.
- You need to get
your head on straight,

191
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,240
and do your damn job.

192
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,895
Parker:
You're not the one
risking your life here.

193
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:59,507
- I could be dead by nightfall.
- If you don't get on
that damn horse,

194
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,943
I'll kill you myself.

195
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,083
Good luck, partner.

196
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,738
Luck is
for heroes, jarson.

197
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:15,392
I'm not a hero.

198
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,873
Okay.
Just be on your way.

199
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,927
Mr. Spellings,
what is that?

200
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,103
It's a camera, William.

201
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,454
You mean for...

202
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,108
Pictures?

203
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,545
All I need is this
little piece of tin.

204
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,982
Ain't that a hoot?

205
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:42,550
Put your hair up
under your hat, William.

206
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,206
I'm gonna take
a picture of you, boy.

207
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,165
Oh, just do it.
Come on.

208
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,393
Be perfectly still
now, William.

209
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:01,134
Perfectly still.

210
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:11,187
How long do I have to stay
perfectly still?

211
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:17,019
William, see those
bottles over there?

212
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,587
I want you to pull fast
and shoot me one of them.

213
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:26,115
Come on, William.
Give it another try.

214
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,513
William, don't aim.

215
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,254
Shoot from the hip.

216
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,299
I can't do that.

217
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:38,562
I'm gonna miss.

218
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,042
Listen to me, boy,

219
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,044
keep your eye
on the bottles.

220
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,015
That's good.
Again.

221
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,086
Nice, isn't it?

222
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,175
Nothing else like it.

223
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,527
What are you doing
around these parts?

224
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:33,182
I'm going to see my dad
in gordo.

225
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:36,272
You always
travel alone?

226
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:38,840
I was raised around
three brothers

227
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:41,756
and a cattle rancher for a dad.
I can take care of myself.

228
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,194
I admire that.

229
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:49,024
What you do around here?

230
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,071
Chores, help my mother.

231
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:56,205
But I gotta make
something of myself.

232
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:59,078
How do you expect
to do that?

233
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,864
I haven't quite
figured that out.

234
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:17,139
Hmm, who could this be?

235
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,103
Whoa!
Hold up there, mister.

236
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:28,063
What's the trouble, marshal?

237
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,847
No outsiders allowed
in these parts.

238
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,199
I need water.

239
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,679
And supplies too.

240
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:38,856
Like I said,
town's been shut down.

241
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,076
Nobody in, nobody out.

242
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,167
That's too bad, marshal.

243
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,213
You'd best be on your way.

244
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,718
God ain't gonna help
your soul, marshal.

245
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,736
Hey, mister,
is this your store?

246
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,783
- Yeah, it is.
- I need some bullets.

247
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,480
Be fast with it.

248
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:39,569
Can't you see
I'm busy?

249
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,620
I said now,

250
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:49,840
- not later.
- What kind of bullets
you need?

251
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:53,235
I need .45 colts
for this revolver.

252
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,194
I see.

253
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,239
Yeah, you do see.

254
00:19:57,283 --> 00:20:00,721
Now give me those bullets and I'll be on my way.

255
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,203
Are you robbing me?

256
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:09,251
Let's say
I'm doing you a favor.

257
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:12,428
It's better
than being dead.

258
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:14,169
Katherine?

259
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,216
Look,

260
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,566
I'm sorry about
what happened yesterday.

261
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,568
I see you kept
the necklace.

262
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,788
Yeah, it's all I had
to remember you by.

263
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:27,965
- I had a lot
to remember you by.

264
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:32,274
William, I'd like you
to meet Leon.

265
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,624
- Leon copper.
- Hey, Mr. Copper.

266
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:37,018
Hey, William,
nice to meet you.

267
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:39,107
My friends
call me Billy.

268
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,414
Ma, is it all right
if I go into town?

269
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,505
You might not want to go
into town right now.

270
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:48,899
There's some badpeople
coming into this area.

271
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,685
He's right. Go on out
and chop some wood.

272
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:54,296
Ma, I ain't
still a kid.

273
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,256
You're always treating me
like I'm a kid.

274
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,302
- Go and do what I said.
- Yes ma'am.

275
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,312
Are you suggesting
to me he's my kid?

276
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:13,315
I'm not
suggesting anything.

277
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,013
You can accept it
or not.

278
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,756
Why didn't you
try to find me?

279
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,630
I did. Every time
I got close, you were
off to another location.

280
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:26,459
I never could pinpoint
where you were going.

281
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:29,940
I'm sorry, Katherine.
If only I'd've known.

282
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,596
Well, you do now.

283
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,349
Hey, mister.
Mr. Spellings here says
you robbed his store.

284
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,177
You're under arrest.

285
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:53,355
Frank:
The marshal's
talking to you.

286
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,665
He's a liar.

287
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,538
Come along with me.

288
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:09,589
Marshal:
Don't do it.

289
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:29,565
You killed him.

290
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:38,226
I've got a bone
to pick with you.
I've got a dead deputy.

291
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:39,967
How'd that happen?

292
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,099
We were just in a shootout,
had to kill a man.

293
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:44,841
Marshal, you just took
money out of my pocket.

294
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,278
This isn't about
money anymore, Mr. Copper!

295
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:50,020
This town is under attack
and we're running
out of time!

296
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:53,415
- He's right.
- So you want me
to team up with you two.

297
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:56,331
Yes, let's hunt
these bastards--
pardon me, ma'am--

298
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,811
down together.

299
00:22:57,854 --> 00:23:00,553
One has-been
and one marshal?

300
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:03,382
I'll take these two
by myself.

301
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,395
Damn it, Landon,
I'm tired of waiting.

302
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:20,834
Well, if you're
tired of waiting,
get on that horse

303
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:23,489
- and go to town.
- You sure about that?

304
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:28,494
If you're so anxious,

305
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:31,627
go ahead.
I'm tired of your whining.

306
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:33,412
No more playing games.

307
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,295
So what are you
gonna do?

308
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:50,472
I'm gonna get
the last two by myself.

309
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:53,432
Why are you going to them
if they're coming here anyway?

310
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:56,347
Let me ask you
something, Katherine.

311
00:23:56,391 --> 00:24:00,090
How would you feel
if I was around more?

312
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:03,659
It wouldn't hurt you
to spend some time
with William.

313
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:07,881
Well, I'll make you
a promise.

314
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:09,578
After I take care of this,

315
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:11,711
I'm gonna come back here

316
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:14,322
and I'm gonna tell William
that I'm his father.

317
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,542
So you're
coming back then, right?

318
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:19,458
I won't put you
through this again.

319
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:23,462
William's my heart.

320
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:26,943
I want what we never
got to experience--

321
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:29,598
a family.

322
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:32,427
Look, I can't keep living

323
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,950
like I've been living.

324
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:36,083
I understand.

325
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:38,172
Just be careful.

326
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,566
I always am.

327
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:43,569
That Leon fella,
he isn't too friendly,
is he?

328
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:46,659
I think he's more
interested in the money
than anything else.

329
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:50,097
Those outlaws take over,

330
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,491
this town won't stand a chance.

331
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,493
We need more men, marshal.

332
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,104
I think we can
handle them, frank.

333
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:58,845
I'll fight beside you,

334
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:01,195
but we need more men.

335
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:02,762
All right,
make an announcement.

336
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:05,416
I think we can get
a few if they know
the town is at risk.

337
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,940
I hope so.

338
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:11,771
Listen to me, men.

339
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:14,643
This town's being attacked
by a gang of outlaws.

340
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:17,690
We need every man that can
shoot to pick up a gun.

341
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,657
You heard the man!
We need to stand up
to these outlaws.

342
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:32,705
No offense, marshal.
I'm not joining

343
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,229
in the fighting
unless the fighting
comes to me.

344
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:37,492
If they come in here,

345
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,189
I'll take care of them.

346
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:41,627
Like you took care
of Robert ally?

347
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,370
That's what I thought.

348
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:50,723
Is anyone with me?

349
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,642
I'll remember this.

350
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,992
I'm with you,
marshal.

351
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:00,863
I'm not
a gunslinger,
but I can help.

352
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:05,607
Who'd you get?

353
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:10,569
The rest of them
just don't give a damn.

354
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,745
I can be
of some help, frank.

355
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:15,748
Give him a gun.

356
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:20,100
You ever shot a man?

357
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:21,841
I've served shots.

358
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:24,887
Well, when you shoot,
don't hesitate.

359
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:27,150
I won't.
How many outlaws
are still alive?

360
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,631
There should be two left if I'm correct.

361
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,938
You mean there's
only two of them?

362
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:35,202
I heard there was four,
but you never can tell.

363
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:36,769
So this is all of us?

364
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:39,946
- Pretty much.
- There's that
bounty hunter too.

365
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:43,602
I remember him.
Real badass
he thinks he is.

366
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:47,344
Well, he shot one
of them so far.

367
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:49,259
He's going out after
the other two

368
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:51,697
instead of waiting for them
to come into town.

369
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,655
What do you want me to do
in the meantime?

370
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,050
- Marshal: Keep an eye out.
- Okay, marshal.

371
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:10,890
Virgil, I was just over
talking to Mary Alice
at the pond.

372
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,718
Mm-hmm.

373
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:15,024
And what'd she
have to say?

374
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:19,115
She said a band of outlaws
might be headed this way.

375
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,204
She says
a lot of things.

376
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:25,121
Well, she heard this
from the marshal in dogma.

377
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:28,777
- Well, I guess I need
to go talk to the mar--

378
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,188
Howdy, folks.

379
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,631
And who are you?

380
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,721
Just a traveler looking
for a place to lay my head.

381
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:09,426
Let's talk outside.

382
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:26,443
Look, friend, we don't
take in strangers here.

383
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,231
Them's the rules, huh?

384
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:33,189
Yep.

385
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:36,410
How much would it cost
to bend those rules?

386
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:40,806
You'd best be on your way.

387
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,810
There ain't no call
for nothing like that.

388
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:14,622
Damn it, you people
need to learn

389
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,972
- the meaning of the word
"hospitality."

390
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,631
I'm gonna
sleep good tonight.

391
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:11,565
Hi, frank.
Come on in.

392
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:15,525
- How you been?
- Good as I can be.

393
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:17,876
- How about you?
- I've been good,

394
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,269
but we've got
some problems.

395
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:22,750
Yeah, I know.
This town's going
to hell and back.

396
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:28,364
We need to talk.

397
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:40,376
What can you tell me
about this Leon fella?

398
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,944
More than I'd like
to tell you.

399
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,077
What you mean?

400
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,948
He's William's father.

401
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,255
I met him 20 years ago
in Carson city.

402
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:53,607
- Did he come here for you?
- No, he didn't know who I was.

403
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,958
I didn't know who he was
until I saw the necklace.

404
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,830
That glass-bullet necklace
he was wearing?

405
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:03,008
Yeah, I had a blacksmith make
that necklace for him.

406
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:06,272
He was only supposed to be gone
for a few days, but...

407
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:08,448
He never came back.

408
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,972
You forgave him
for that yet?

409
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:13,801
I have no ill will
towards him.

410
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:17,022
He gave me the best thing
that ever happened to me.

411
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:19,981
Every day I see William

412
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:22,941
I remember
what I live for.

413
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,508
What was he before
he became a bounty hunter?

414
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,512
A marshal--
a damn good one.

415
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:34,387
He was supposed to be
going after Pete holling.

416
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,739
The last thing I heard was that
Pete got shot in cold blood.

417
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:41,263
Leon got accused of it.

418
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:43,135
That's why he left.

419
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:45,702
That's why I don't have
any ill will towards him.

420
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,575
So he's a marshal, huh?

421
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,274
Damn good one.

422
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,209
What are you doing
around these parts?

423
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,472
Just passing
through, marshal.

424
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:18,300
Sure about that?

425
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:22,130
I'm just here to stay
the night and I'll be
heading out by morning.

426
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:24,611
How about you head out
before nightfall?

427
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:27,788
We have too much
going on around here
to worry about drifters.

428
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,225
- If you say so, marshal.
- I do.

429
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:32,706
Finish your business here
and get out of town.

430
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:44,196
- What'd that man say to you?
- Not a lot of anything,
marshal.

431
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:47,155
Asked for a couple of shots
of whiskey and then you came.

432
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:49,462
I think he might be one of those outlaws.

433
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:52,204
- I'm not sure though.
- I'll keep my eye out for you,

434
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:53,901
let you know
what's going around.

435
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:56,034
I'd appreciate that.

436
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,696
Jane:
Thanks for going
on a walk with me.

437
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,221
Gives us both
time to talk.

438
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:12,093
William:
I was hoping we could maybe
see each other again.

439
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,443
You ever see yourself
settling down?

440
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:17,751
If I can find
the right circumstances.

441
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:21,102
- I want to have a horse farm.
- That sounds mighty fine.

442
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:23,974
So you really
like horses?

443
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:26,368
I love
everything about them.
How about you?

444
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:29,719
Eh, they're good
for when you need 'em.

445
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:32,070
You any good
with that?

446
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:38,032
I forgot I had it on.

447
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,253
You-- you could say
I'm learning the ropes.

448
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:46,171
Well, that's a relief,
especially with all this
killing going on.

449
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,262
That's why I don't want
to head to gordo just yet.

450
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,002
So long as you're with me,

451
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,179
we'll get through this
until it's settled.

452
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:53,385
You don't have
to say a word.

453
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,302
I know what
you're here for.

454
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:01,393
All right, what then?

455
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:04,657
Demons.

456
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:08,400
Demons that hide
themselves in bad men.

457
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:11,968
So have you seen
those men?

458
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,278
Mister, I used
to be a preacher.

459
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:20,542
I'm very much aware

460
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:22,240
of these men.

461
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:25,199
Well, I killed one
of them already.

462
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,293
You can't kill

463
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:34,252
what already
walks dead!

464
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:37,951
You make no sense.

465
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:39,605
You know where
these men are?

466
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:46,176
Mister, there's been
too much killing.

467
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,700
Well, I'm afraid
there's gonna have to be

468
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:49,963
a little bit more
before this thing is done.

469
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:02,280
Much obliged.

470
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:05,935
You might find what
you're looking for.

471
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:08,242
You might!

472
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,026
You might!

473
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,339
You might find what
you're looking for.

474
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,052
Mind if I join you?

475
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:37,967
What are you doing
around here?

476
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:39,969
Ain't nobody
come around here.

477
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:42,494
I'm looking for outlaws.

478
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:43,886
Have you seen any?

479
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,888
Well hell, you're looking
at two of them right now.

480
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,851
You want to try me?

481
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:54,506
Looks like
you're outnumbered.

482
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:57,770
I may be outnumbered,

483
00:38:57,813 --> 00:39:00,512
but you die first.

484
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:02,949
How about you hold your pistol
and we'll hold ours?

485
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,432
That sounds good.

486
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:27,103
Tell me what you know.

487
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,367
Came through here
awhile back.

488
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:33,545
- Leon: When?
- A couple of days ago.

489
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,808
Heard they were
heading for dogma.

490
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,987
That's where I need
to be right now.

491
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,555
Well, you're headed
in the wrong direction.

492
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:44,686
Yeah, I figured that.

493
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,265
Hey, what's the deal with that
crazy preacher out there?

494
00:39:58,308 --> 00:40:00,310
You seen the preacher?

495
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:02,225
Yeah, I saw
the preacher.

496
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:06,404
Well now, not everybody's seen the preacher.

497
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,449
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

498
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:11,365
It don't mean nothing.
Some folks seen him,

499
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,455
some don't.
That's all.

500
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:17,806
I'm gonna hit the trail.
You people talk in riddles
around here.

501
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,461
Just remember
we did you a favor.

502
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,420
If you say so.

503
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:07,508
Robert, is that you?

504
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:10,685
I thought you wasn't
coming back anymore.

505
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:12,557
I'm not coming back.

506
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:15,298
What you mean?

507
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:17,562
I got shot, Landon.

508
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:20,434
Left to dry up in the sun.

509
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,697
That can't be true.

510
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:25,570
Me and Parker are dead.

511
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:28,573
I don't believe that.
You can't be dead.

512
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:30,836
You right here
next to me.

513
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:34,535
The shadow of death
is waiting for you
if you don't leave now.

514
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,494
You expect me to leave?

515
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:40,106
It's just you and jarson

516
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:42,282
against the whole town.

517
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:44,632
I can't do that, Robert.

518
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:48,984
Remember how the job in gordo
went up in flames?

519
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:51,552
The plan will work.

520
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:53,598
The gang is more
prepared this time.

521
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:56,078
I'm going now, Landon.

522
00:41:56,122 --> 00:42:00,561
I'll get more men.
I'll go after the ones
who did this to you.

523
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:02,650
It was good
to know you.

524
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,580
How are you, marshal?

525
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:04,973
You're not allowed in here.
What are you doing in there?

526
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:08,498
I'm taking your job.

527
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:11,632
You couldn't take my job
from my cold, dead fingers.

528
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:13,765
I don't want
to kill you, marshal.

529
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:16,419
I'm holding down your guns
and office though.

530
00:43:16,463 --> 00:43:19,466
If you make this a problem,
I'll put a bullet through you.

531
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:34,655
What's the matter?

532
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:37,658
My office was taken over
by one of those bandits.

533
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,660
Kill anybody?

534
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:41,793
No, he didn't even
take a shot at me.

535
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:44,056
Just said let him be
and no harm would come.

536
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,666
I figured we'd put
together a plan.

537
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,190
Let's let him
get comfortable,

538
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:50,018
then we'll take him.

539
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:52,064
I am sick of this!

540
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:55,371
That bounty hunter's
not taking them out
like he said he was.

541
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:57,635
I found out something
about our bounty hunter.

542
00:43:57,678 --> 00:43:59,419
What's that?

543
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:01,769
He was a lawman
just like you.

544
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:05,338
Really?

545
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:07,209
Yes, he was.

546
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:09,516
Where'd you
come across this?

547
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,083
I have my ways.

548
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:13,999
Where do you
suppose he is now?

549
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:16,349
I'm thinking
he's on his way back here.

550
00:44:43,768 --> 00:44:45,987
- This the infirmary?
- Yes, it is.

551
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:48,816
- Who the hell are you?
- None of your damn business.

552
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,559
Mr. Fiction?

553
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:54,953
- Yes ma'am?
- The doctor will see you
in about 10 minutes.

554
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:59,827
I can't believe Rodney
lost his leg.

555
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:01,786
Damn mine collapsed.

556
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:03,744
Third time
this month, right?

557
00:45:03,788 --> 00:45:06,094
Won't be the last time.
I can bet you that.

558
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:09,881
You guys up for a game
of cards later?

559
00:45:09,924 --> 00:45:11,883
Only if you want to lose
your whole day's pay.

560
00:45:11,926 --> 00:45:14,581
I hate waiting
in this hellhole.

561
00:45:14,624 --> 00:45:17,671
All the nurses gonna do is take
a look at us and send us back.

562
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:27,855
I got a proposition
for you boys.

563
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,901
We don't want
no business with you.

564
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:32,904
Wait, let's give the man
a chance to talk.

565
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:37,082
Hell, what can
we lose, a lung?

566
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:39,824
He's probably
looking for a job.

567
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:42,435
There ain't no jobs
around these parts, mister.

568
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:46,787
You boys ever thought
about being outlaws?

569
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:50,922
Take the future
into your own hands.

570
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:54,882
Make a hell
of a lot more money.

571
00:45:54,926 --> 00:45:57,842
The three of us don't
even know how to use a gun.

572
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,844
You trying to recruit us

573
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:01,933
to commit crimes?

574
00:46:01,976 --> 00:46:04,892
I got money,
a lot of it.

575
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:08,417
Half up front,
half when the job's done.

576
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:10,942
You're not pulling our leg?

577
00:46:10,985 --> 00:46:14,206
I have horses,
guns and supplies.

578
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:17,165
All's I need is a gang
to ride with me to dogma.

579
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:20,038
That's about 20 miles
from here.

580
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:23,432
Sounds a lot better than
giving your life to the mines.

581
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:27,306
Well, what's
everybody's name?

582
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:30,831
- Well, I'm Jordan.
- Luther.

583
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,181
- The name's Steven.
- Okay.

584
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:35,053
Luther,
Jordan and Steven,

585
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:38,012
- I'm Landon.
- This sounds a bit risky.

586
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:40,841
I've got a sister
and I'm her provider.

587
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:43,670
Hey, working in these coal mines
every day is risky.

588
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:45,846
You never know whether
you coming back or not.

589
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,196
What about all that money?

590
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,938
Think about how much that
could help you and her.

591
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:53,114
It won't help her
if I'm dead.

592
00:46:53,158 --> 00:46:56,291
Sorry, fellas,
but I can't risk that.

593
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:59,077
I got a plan, boys.
We ride tonight,

594
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,948
in the morning
we'll be in dogma.

595
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:04,430
There won't be much opposition
after they see what we can do.

596
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:06,824
What about
the townspeople?

597
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:09,043
To hell
with the townspeople!

598
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:11,089
I think they killed
my partner Robert.

599
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:13,047
Robert ally?

600
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:14,483
Old man?

601
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:17,225
Yeah, what do you
know about it?

602
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:19,880
I was just in dogma.
Your man ally

603
00:47:19,924 --> 00:47:21,969
got into a scrap
with a bounty hunter.

604
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,452
So what happened?

605
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,935
The old man
didn't make it.

606
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:37,028
We need at least
one more man for this job.

607
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:39,291
Any of you boys
got any ideas?

608
00:47:40,553 --> 00:47:42,250
I have a brother-in-law,

609
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:44,992
lives back on the edge
of the woods, near the mines.

610
00:47:45,036 --> 00:47:48,343
He's named elrich.
He's--

611
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:50,868
he's not too bright
in the head

612
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,870
and he's got
kind of a potbelly,

613
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:54,523
bless his heart,

614
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:56,612
but he's slick
with a shotgun

615
00:47:56,656 --> 00:47:58,832
and he loves
the smell of money.

616
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,661
So we'll get Luther
to pick him up,

617
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:03,402
since he's out
near them parts.

618
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:07,928
This is money.

619
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:11,062
Keep some for yourself,
give the rest to him.

620
00:48:11,105 --> 00:48:13,542
Tell him to meet us
in dogma tomorrow.

621
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:16,067
As for you two,

622
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,112
we've got a ride
in store for us.

623
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:21,115
Luther, the doctor
can see you now.

624
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:32,257
Sounds like a deal.

625
00:48:39,394 --> 00:48:40,961
Outlaw, I'm talking
to you!

626
00:48:41,005 --> 00:48:42,963
What you want,
old timer?

627
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:46,184
I'll make you
a deal,

628
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:49,970
let you walk out
a free man if you leave
and never come back.

629
00:48:50,014 --> 00:48:52,538
You'd let me walk free
just that easy?

630
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:54,975
That's my word.

631
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:05,638
Come out
with your hands up!

632
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:08,032
I guess I'm taking you
to your grave, marshal.

633
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:10,208
We don't want
no trouble, mister.

634
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:12,993
Just put your guns down
and step out nice and easy.

635
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,777
You don't want no trouble?

636
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:16,779
You killed
two of my partners!

637
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:18,868
I'm warning you
for the last time.

638
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:21,088
Drop your guns and step
out with your hands up

639
00:49:21,132 --> 00:49:22,524
or I'll be forced
to fire!

640
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:25,049
Go ahead and fire, marshal.

641
00:49:25,092 --> 00:49:26,659
I'm not giving myself up.

642
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:35,494
You boys gonna
stand and fight?

643
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:39,019
I don't want
any cowards.

644
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:40,803
I know
I'm ready.

645
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,025
Are you sure
you're ready?

646
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:47,810
Whoa whoa whoa, Landon.
He don't mean anything by it.

647
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:52,554
You need to know this ain't
no job for just anyone.

648
00:49:52,598 --> 00:49:56,036
We know that.
It's nothing to play
around with.

649
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,125
The first time
one of y'all hesitates,

650
00:49:58,169 --> 00:49:59,997
it could cost
one of us our lives.

651
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,173
When do we split up?

652
00:50:02,216 --> 00:50:05,872
Me and Steven take the south
entrance in the morning.

653
00:50:05,915 --> 00:50:08,657
You head to town
and stick to yourself

654
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:10,485
until we get there.

655
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:13,010
What's the plan
once you two get there?

656
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:17,753
Kill everyone.

657
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:42,604
It's a nice evening
tonight, isn't it?

658
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:45,085
Be better if I can
go into town.

659
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:47,087
Now you listen to me.

660
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:49,089
That town's dangerous
right now.

661
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:51,004
You hear me?

662
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:54,834
I wanna be a gunslinger

663
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:57,880
and I've been practicing
with Mr. Spellings

664
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:00,057
on my free days
from chores.

665
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:04,583
You've been what?

666
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:08,108
Well, Mr. Spellings said
I needed to know my way
around a gun.

667
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:10,284
And, uh...

668
00:51:10,328 --> 00:51:12,721
How to use one.

669
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:16,551
I'm disappointed
in you.

670
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:20,120
Well...

671
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:22,122
I'm growing up, ma.

672
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:25,125
There's a lot
of bad people out there.

673
00:51:26,735 --> 00:51:29,086
Well, I'm a good person

674
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:31,871
and I need to know
how to protect myself.

675
00:51:33,307 --> 00:51:36,441
Well, I understand that.
I just wish you'd told me.

676
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,097
I just did.

677
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,229
I meant before.

678
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,145
Sorry, mama.

679
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:48,061
There's something important
I need to tell you anyway.

680
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:51,238
What is it?

681
00:51:53,022 --> 00:51:55,242
Do you remember Mr. Copper?

682
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:57,505
Yeah, the bounty hunter.

683
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,422
Yeah, well...

684
00:52:01,466 --> 00:52:03,816
We were friends
a long time ago.

685
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:07,820
Well, what I meant
to say was...

686
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:10,736
He's your father.

687
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:14,479
What?

688
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:17,308
I thought my father
was dead.

689
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:20,963
I did too.
I didn't think
I'd ever see him again.

690
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,185
Did he come back
to find us?

691
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:28,188
No, a job led him
through here.

692
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:30,495
It's a blessing
he stopped by.

693
00:52:30,538 --> 00:52:32,627
Is he coming back?

694
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:34,760
He said he was.

695
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:37,241
He said he wanted
to spend some time
with you.

696
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:39,156
What do you think
about that?

697
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:44,204
I think I'd like that.

698
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,424
When he comes back,

699
00:52:46,467 --> 00:52:48,817
I want you to treat him
with respect.

700
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:50,515
No backtalk.

701
00:52:50,558 --> 00:52:52,517
Yes ma'am.

702
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,128
You can count on me.

703
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,482
So why'd we stop?

704
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:03,310
We're only
a few miles
from dogma.

705
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:05,225
I want you two
to go in alone.

706
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:07,749
What do we do
when we get there?

707
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:09,273
Wait for me.

708
00:53:09,316 --> 00:53:11,927
Anything else?

709
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:14,365
Yeah, y'all come
across a lawman,

710
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:16,193
y'all split up again.

711
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:19,457
- Why?
- If you go up against
someone like that,

712
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,329
you go alone.
Tell him you're a miner.

713
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:25,114
Don't mention me.
Don't mention the others.

714
00:53:25,158 --> 00:53:27,029
You've both been
riding all night.

715
00:53:27,073 --> 00:53:28,901
You might want
to get some rest.

716
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:52,577
Damn, he got me
in the leg.

717
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:59,540
You okay, marshal?

718
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:09,246
- You all right, marshal?
- No, damn it, he shot me.

719
00:54:16,427 --> 00:54:18,994
Do you believe
this Landon fella?

720
00:54:19,038 --> 00:54:21,345
About the money?

721
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:22,955
Yeah.

722
00:54:22,998 --> 00:54:25,523
I don't know.

723
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:28,177
Sure seems
to have a lot of it.

724
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:31,485
Sure does,
and you're right--
this sure beats mining.

725
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:35,184
It seems to me the risk
is about the same.

726
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:38,797
I think so.
Just last week

727
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,452
old frank Robinson was
killed down in the hole.

728
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:44,803
His family was left
with nothing.

729
00:54:45,804 --> 00:54:47,327
I don't want
to be like that.

730
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,677
I wanna make a name
for myself.

731
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:52,332
Yeah.
Fill our pockets

732
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:55,770
with some of that gold
we've been hearing about.

733
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:58,730
Yep! Head off
somewhere in the sunset.

734
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:03,169
I think I see someone.

735
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,305
I can't make out who it is.

736
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:10,350
It could be the law.

737
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:12,613
What should I do?

738
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:14,833
Just act normal.

739
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,487
And remember,

740
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,489
you're alone.

741
00:55:32,198 --> 00:55:34,026
Where are you
heading, boy?

742
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:36,507
Just going to the brothel
for the evening.

743
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:40,337
You some kind of a cowboy
or something?

744
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,469
No sir,
I'm a miner.

745
00:55:43,862 --> 00:55:46,125
This here is just
for protection.

746
00:55:46,168 --> 00:55:48,432
Well, I can't let you go
through to dogma.

747
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:50,521
I'm out here looking
for some outlaws.

748
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:53,393
For all I know,
you just might be one of them.

749
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:56,265
Do I look like one?

750
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:57,745
No.
To be honest,

751
00:55:57,789 --> 00:56:00,226
you don't even look like
you know how to use that gun.

752
00:56:02,097 --> 00:56:04,709
I suggest you go back
to where you came from.

753
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:21,595
I'll show him I know
how to use my pistol.

754
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:27,645
What do you
suggest, marshal?

755
00:56:29,603 --> 00:56:31,605
I think we'd better wait
on that bounty hunter.

756
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:34,521
He's gotta know there's more
than one of them here now.

757
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:36,436
That could take days.

758
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,917
We don't have
much choice, frank.

759
00:57:11,036 --> 00:57:12,994
We need all your money,

760
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:15,606
all your food and all
the water you've got.

761
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:17,477
Jane:
Miss Katherine?

762
00:57:27,705 --> 00:57:30,142
I don't have
a whole lot of money

763
00:57:30,185 --> 00:57:33,362
and the only food I have is
enough for me and my guests.

764
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:35,408
We didn't ask
for no explanations.

765
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,062
We asked for supplies.

766
00:57:37,105 --> 00:57:39,020
You don't scare me.

767
00:57:39,064 --> 00:57:41,501
Now leave my house.

768
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:43,285
That's the wrong answer!

769
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:56,473
Lasso those
two horses over there.
They're ours now.

770
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:22,499
Kill his ass already!

771
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:24,457
I gotta get this bullet
outta my leg.

772
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:40,125
Get me outta here!

773
00:58:55,444 --> 00:58:56,968
Damn, it's Leon.

774
00:59:02,713 --> 00:59:04,584
What happened to him?

775
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:06,499
How many did you get?

776
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,022
I didn't get any.

777
00:59:08,066 --> 00:59:11,504
I can tell you where one is.
Right across the street.

778
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,724
- You're the bartender, right?
- Yeah.

779
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:16,683
Marshal, is this all
the men you've got

780
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:18,163
to help to defend
this town?

781
00:59:18,206 --> 00:59:20,426
None of the others
would lift a hand.

782
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:25,605
He's held up over there
in the marshal's office.

783
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,520
A slick one, he is.

784
00:59:30,654 --> 00:59:33,047
Let's find out
how slick he is.

785
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:36,311
Bartender, you stay here
and stake out the store.

786
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:37,748
Frank, you come with me

787
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:40,315
and let's go check
on Katherine and William,

788
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:41,752
make sure they're okay.

789
00:59:41,795 --> 00:59:44,624
Hurry back.
I saw some running that way.

790
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:46,539
- How many'd you see?
- Two of them.

791
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:49,194
That don't make no sense.

792
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:51,805
We'd better hurry and go check
on Katherine and William.

793
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,722
William!

794
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:18,484
I love you,
Katherine Bonney.

795
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:34,326
I'll kill everybody
responsible for this.

796
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:40,854
Why?!
Why her?

797
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:52,736
Frank, can you
leave us alone?

798
01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:54,563
I need to talk
to William for a bit.

799
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,043
All right.
I'll go inside.

800
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:03,398
William,

801
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:05,836
there's a lot
I need to tell you.

802
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:08,708
Is this about
you being my pa?

803
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:11,363
So your mother
must have told you.

804
01:01:11,406 --> 01:01:13,365
Yes sir.

805
01:01:13,408 --> 01:01:15,846
- She did.
- Did you see who did this?

806
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:20,677
There was two men
in the distance.

807
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:25,420
And I'm gonna kill both
of them sons of bitches.

808
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:30,730
William, you don't even
know how to shoot a gun.

809
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,689
Yes sir,
Mr. Spellings taught me.

810
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,735
You ain't going nowhere.

811
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:39,086
You're my only son.
You're my flesh and blood

812
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,697
and you're all
I got left.

813
01:02:40,191 --> 01:02:42,236
Hey.

814
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,890
Who did this?

815
01:02:43,934 --> 01:02:46,763
That there is
doc wiley's handiwork.

816
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:57,948
How about a game
of five-card stud?

817
01:02:57,991 --> 01:02:59,819
Landon:
Okay.

818
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:06,913
I don't think I've seen you
around here before.

819
01:03:06,957 --> 01:03:08,828
Just got into town.

820
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:16,314
You got friends around here
or are you just drifting?

821
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:18,925
I used to ride with that man
out there in the coffin.

822
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:24,539
Oh yeah?
What was his name?

823
01:03:25,845 --> 01:03:28,805
Parker. He saved
my life many times.

824
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:32,243
I guess I couldn't
return the favor.

825
01:03:34,723 --> 01:03:36,856
I hear doc wiley
fixed him up.

826
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,163
That's right.

827
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:43,167
I sure would like
to meet this doc wiley.

828
01:03:44,255 --> 01:03:46,823
Thank him for fixing up
my friend.

829
01:03:46,866 --> 01:03:48,868
I think
he'd appreciate that

830
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:50,870
and I'll pass
the word on for you.

831
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,090
Sure would like to tell him myself.

832
01:03:58,747 --> 01:04:00,793
You know where he lives?

833
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,363
I don't think I can give you
that information, mister.

834
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:08,845
Won't turn over
your friend, huh?

835
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:11,891
That's downright
honorable of you.

836
01:04:13,762 --> 01:04:15,852
Don't tell anybody that.

837
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:20,944
You know, you might remember
someone else who came
in a few days ago.

838
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:24,643
Who might that be?

839
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:26,863
Robert ally.

840
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:29,691
Robert ally?

841
01:04:29,735 --> 01:04:31,911
Yeah,

842
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:34,348
that name's
vaguely familiar.

843
01:04:34,392 --> 01:04:36,960
I hear he was shot down
by a bounty hunter.

844
01:04:39,745 --> 01:04:41,878
Did you see
that happen?

845
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:44,445
Yes, I did.

846
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,708
And?

847
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:50,016
The bounty hunter drew faster,
that's all there was to it.

848
01:04:52,845 --> 01:04:55,152
Did Robert mention
who he was?

849
01:04:55,195 --> 01:04:57,154
What do you mean by that?

850
01:04:57,197 --> 01:05:00,940
Did he tell you he was
one of the four horsemen?

851
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:03,943
You mean
the apocalypse thing?

852
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:06,206
That's what I mean.

853
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:09,079
Well, I'm never...

854
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:12,256
Studied much about
that biblical stuff.

855
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:14,084
Did you believe him?

856
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:21,918
I don't want to play
five-card stud.

857
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,572
What game would you
like to play?

858
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,836
Well, wagers.

859
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,404
I'd like
to place some bets.

860
01:05:30,448 --> 01:05:33,103
What'd you have in mind?

861
01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:37,759
I'm willing to bet you
500 bucks

862
01:05:37,803 --> 01:05:41,024
that everyone in this town
will be dead by sunset.

863
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:49,902
- Well, what do you think?
- Even me?

864
01:05:51,512 --> 01:05:54,167
I said
everyone in this town.

865
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:57,692
Uh...

866
01:05:57,736 --> 01:06:00,086
I don't think I want
to take that bet.

867
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:08,051
I think I'm gonna
find that doc,

868
01:06:08,094 --> 01:06:10,096
give him some money
on account of Parker.

869
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:51,181
Well, hello there, Stanford.
What brings you out here?

870
01:06:51,224 --> 01:06:55,359
Dr. Wiley, I was just
visited by a man

871
01:06:55,402 --> 01:06:57,839
who's looking for you.

872
01:06:57,883 --> 01:07:00,016
- Is he sick?
- No sir.

873
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,670
He's a friend of
the man that the marshal

874
01:07:02,714 --> 01:07:05,064
and Mr. Spelling shot down.

875
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:07,197
So what's he want with me?

876
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,069
Well, he claims

877
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:12,506
he's wanting to thank you
for fixing his friend up

878
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,682
and pay you something
for your trouble.

879
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:17,207
You think there's more to it
than that, don't you?

880
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,643
Yes sir.

881
01:07:18,686 --> 01:07:21,515
This is
a dangerous man, Dr. Wiley.

882
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:23,648
I can feel it in here.

883
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:27,130
This man's like a dark cloud
over the whole town.

884
01:07:27,173 --> 01:07:30,176
He scares
the hell out of me.

885
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,265
So what do you think
I should do, Stanford?

886
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:34,702
Get into town and stay there.

887
01:07:34,746 --> 01:07:36,965
Get yourself around
other people,

888
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:39,751
don't go anywhere alone.

889
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:42,667
Well, Stanford,
you must have thought
mighty strong about this

890
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,017
to leave your little perch
at the saloon.

891
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,585
I'm guessing
I'll take your advice.

892
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:50,849
It'd be the best thing.

893
01:07:55,027 --> 01:07:57,073
I'm glad to see you
back up on your feet.

894
01:07:57,116 --> 01:07:59,075
Looks like that rest
did you some good.

895
01:07:59,118 --> 01:08:02,121
- What happened when I was out?
- More of those outlaws
are here.

896
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:05,168
How many of them are
in town and where are they?

897
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:07,387
Couple of them made it
out to Katherine's house.

898
01:08:07,431 --> 01:08:10,825
They shot her dead,
and that little girl
that was staying with her.

899
01:08:13,698 --> 01:08:15,656
What you got
in mind, marshal?

900
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,051
Let's take the one in my
office where all the guns
and ammunition are.

901
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,966
We'll worry about
the others later.

902
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:23,664
Who knows?
When they hear
all the shooting starting,

903
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:26,102
maybe they'll come out
and expose themselves.

904
01:08:27,712 --> 01:08:29,888
♪ Camptown races,
blah blah blah ♪

905
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:32,282
♪ doo dah, doo dah.

906
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:51,257
Got him running!

907
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:20,243
Jarson:
Landon, good to see you.
Who the hell are these guys?

908
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:22,854
Landon:
This is the new gang.
There's five of us now.

909
01:09:23,942 --> 01:09:25,944
These boys
are ready to go.

910
01:09:25,987 --> 01:09:27,859
We can take
this town, Landon.

911
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:30,731
Yeah, we run into
a marshal or something.

912
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:32,907
He had us turn around
and head back to town.

913
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:34,692
We waited a few
and came anyway.

914
01:09:34,735 --> 01:09:37,085
Yeah, bastard stuck a gun
in Steven's face.

915
01:09:37,129 --> 01:09:39,175
Not the first time, huh?

916
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:43,266
How about telling me
what's going on, jarson.

917
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:45,529
The only ones that been
fighting so far is the marshal,

918
01:09:45,572 --> 01:09:47,792
the store owner
and a couple of other guys.

919
01:09:47,835 --> 01:09:50,316
The rest of the town's
a bunch of chickenshits.

920
01:10:07,115 --> 01:10:09,205
What is wrong
with you people?!

921
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:12,860
This is your town.
This is your fight.

922
01:10:12,904 --> 01:10:15,341
Get in the fight.
C'mon!

923
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:28,735
The bastard went
in the saloon.

924
01:12:33,436 --> 01:12:34,741
Hey!

925
01:12:35,786 --> 01:12:37,788
What do you think?!
What do you think?!

926
01:12:37,831 --> 01:12:41,400
What the hell you gonna do?
What the hell you gonna do?

927
01:12:41,444 --> 01:12:44,316
- Nothing.
- Get your ass outta here.

928
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,082
I'm gonna kill you,
you son of a bitch!

929
01:13:55,126 --> 01:13:57,476
You'd better stop talking
and start shooting.

930
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,616
I got you covered,
now go on out.

931
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:08,792
What do you mean?

932
01:14:08,835 --> 01:14:11,403
- I can take care of it myself.
- But, Leon--

933
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,839
just do it!

934
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:23,720
Aw shit.

935
01:14:23,763 --> 01:14:26,244
It looks like I got
your partner.

936
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:29,639
If you give up,
I'm gonna make your death quick.

937
01:14:29,682 --> 01:14:31,510
If you don't,

938
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:33,512
I'm gonna make you suffer.

939
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:35,514
Yeah, wishful thinking.

940
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:42,434
I'm tired of this shit!

941
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:57,275
Come on, Leon,

942
01:14:57,318 --> 01:14:59,582
don't die on me.

943
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:01,600
Billy's voice:
My mama was buried soon after
the fighting ended

944
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:04,255
and I held a ceremony.

945
01:16:04,298 --> 01:16:07,606
Now her and Leon both
lay next to each other.

946
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:12,437
As for
the glass-bullet necklace,

947
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,352
well,

948
01:16:14,395 --> 01:16:16,702
I keep that
in a safe place.

949
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:21,620
I headed towards Lincoln county to start a new life.

950
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:24,710
I don't call myself
William any more.

951
01:16:24,754 --> 01:16:27,408
And I carry two
of my own pistols.

952
01:16:27,452 --> 01:16:29,628
Just call me Billy--

953
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:32,457
