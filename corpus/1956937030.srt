[whimpering]

11
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,948

00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:14,218

16
00:01:17,822 --> 00:01:20,358
She doesn't know anything.

17
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:21,993
String him up!

18
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:29,267
- No, no.
- Okay, American.

19
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,569

00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:39,243

23
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:42,780

[breathing heavily] Go kiss.

25
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:47,985

[breathing heavily]

27
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:52,356
- Go kiss.
- Go kiss? What is Go kiss?

28
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,258
Go kiss.

29
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:56,395
Go kiss my ass.

00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,402
What are you doing?

32
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:05,136
I am getting the information
we need!

33
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:07,638
You killed him before we got
the information! No matter.

34
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:09,307
We got two left!
Do not question me!

35
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,409

How'd you get free?

40
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:48,146
Let's just say those
Cross-fit classes paid off.

- Mara?
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,283
[sighing] Please knock first.

54
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:26,751
Come on. We can't be late.

55
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:28,853
I wanna go on the first patrol
with you.

56
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:31,055
- You sure you're up to this?
- Of course.

57
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:32,823
I've been counting down
all week.

58
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:34,792
I was talking to your father.

59
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:37,795
[sighs] I've survived worse.
I think I can handle this.

60
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:39,997
[chuckling]
Where's your brother?

61
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:43,968
In bed, playing on his pad
like he doesn't wanna go.

62
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:47,338
Mara, can you give your father
and me just a few minutes alone

63
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:49,207
for some morning grown-up talk?

64
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,109
Ew! So gross.

65
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:54,845
- Uh, babe.
- Hm?

66
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,080
Morning grown-up talk?

67
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:58,483
I think she even
saw through that one.

68
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:00,017
No.

69
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,087
I actually wanna talk.

70
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,090
Okay.

71
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:10,161
Ever since you started this
new job, you're hardly around.

72
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:13,864
Look, babe, I gotta work, right?
We got bills to pay.

73
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:16,968
I'm just saying, you missed
his last three ball games.

74
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:20,472
[scoffs] And she just
finally got her scouts badge.

75
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:21,707
What happened to family first?

76
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,842
Well, that's why I'm bringing
them to work with me today,

77
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,011
so we can have some quality
family time, right?

78
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:29,113
- All you do is work.
- And, baby.

79
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:31,082
You know what I've been
going through, readjusting

80
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:33,851
to civilian life,
struggling to pay these bills.

81
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:37,489
And now I'm finally feeling like
the provider again.

82
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:40,157
We miss you.

83
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:42,360
And we need you.

84
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:45,229
Ah-hah. "We."

85
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:49,033
[laughing] Me.

86
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,270
- I hear you.
- Yeah.

87
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:55,206
[instrumental music]

88
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:01,112
- I'm gonna get them dressed.
- Mm-hmm.

89
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:02,913
And I'm going to make them
some breakfast

90
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:04,516
for their busy day
with their daddy.

91
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:05,550
You better get goin'.

92
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,218
[laughing]

93
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:08,219
Mm.

94
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,057
Mm.

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,834
Mara: Mom, are you watching?

96
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:25,604
Mara, I'm watching,
I'm also working

97
00:05:25,637 --> 00:05:27,305
on not burning breakfast.

98
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:28,540
Watching what?

99
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:29,874
I was just trying to show mom

100
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:31,142
the flying back kick
you taught me.

101
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:33,978
Jesse: Okay. Let's see it.
Let's see it.

102
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:36,548
Okay, now remember,
when you jump and land,

103
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,015
that's when you extend your leg.

104
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,318
Maybe she should extend her lip
over her face.

105
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:43,154
- That's it. I'mma kick ya ass.
- Uh, Mara.

106
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:46,057
This is what I have to deal with
all day while you're at work.

107
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,594
Ry, what'd I tell you about
teasing your little sister, huh?

108
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,295
- Apologize.
- Why?

109
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,598
You're not even here for some
of the things she calls me.

110
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:55,900
Hey. Watch that tone, young man.

111
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,902
- And show some respect.
- It's okay, babe.

112
00:05:57,935 --> 00:06:01,072
His little pre-teen hormones
are kicking in.

113
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:02,541
- Give me that.
- Hey!

114
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:05,377
No, we're gonna sit down
and have breakfast

115
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,978
and talk like a regular family.

116
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:09,146
Let's scarf and go!

117
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,016
Walking around the arena
all day?

118
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:14,952
- Sounds wack.
- So you don't wanna go?

119
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:16,421
No. Not really.

120
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:19,190
Okay then, well, Mara and I

121
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:22,461
will just enjoy the Falcons'
game by ourselves.

122
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:23,628
Whoo-hoo!

123
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:25,630
The Phoenix Falcons'
season opener?

124
00:06:25,664 --> 00:06:27,231
My favorite player, Micah Crews,

125
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,233
just got traded
to the Phoenix Falcons.

126
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:31,936
Too bad you don't wanna go. Hm.

127
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,507
What? Change your mind?

128
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,241
Who cares about the stupid game.

129
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:39,343
Mara: I just wanna go on patrol
with you.

130
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:41,580
Oh, well, I'm gonna have to play
that one by ear, baby girl.

131
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:44,383
Uh, now, I'm still learning
my way around the job myself.

132
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,652
- I guess it'll still be fun.
- What are we waiting for?

133
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:50,121
Let's go!

134
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:52,223
Ryan: I can't wait to see
Micah Crews in action.

135
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:54,593
I can't wait to see you
in action, daddy!

136
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:57,662
Probably not gonna be too much
action for me, sweetie.

137
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:00,030
This is just a regular day
at the office.

138
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,504
Hey, Freeman, these can't be
your kids. They're adorable.

139
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:07,004
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

140
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:09,173
Man 2: Hey, Jesse, what's up?
- How you doin'?

141
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:12,009
Daddy, is it always busy
like this?

142
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:14,413
Well, it all depends
on who's in the venue.

143
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:16,448
Well, today is a special day,
not only because

144
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:20,151
it's the Falcons' season opener,
but the governor and the mayor

145
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:22,554
are comin' to watch the game
with the new stadium owner.

146
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:24,989
- Guess who.
- Who?

147
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:28,159
- Diana Smart.
- OMG, Diana Smart?

148
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:30,429
When I grow up,
I wanna be a genius billionaire

149
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:31,530
just like her.

150
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:32,997
Yeah, dream on.

151
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,699
- Hater.
- Stop.

152
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,568
Why is the arena
all thrashed out like that?

153
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:38,437
Ms. Smart is doing renovations.

154
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,705
Daddy, can we please meet her?

155
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:43,174
Oh, sweetie,
she is a very busy lady.

156
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:46,343
- I doubt we'll even see her.
- Okay.

157
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:51,215
[indistinct chatter]

158
00:07:57,756 --> 00:08:00,124
Man 3: Yo, we have to bring out
the big boy.

159
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:03,961
Check my lady out,
killin' it, as usual.

160
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,033
Yeah, and so we checkin' out
the spot where she's the owner

161
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:10,367
doin' her thing, you know?

162
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:13,370
Damn, girl, we like the new Jay
and Beyonce up in this piece.

163
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,774
Woman 2: We love you, Diane!
We love you, Milli!

164
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:17,341
Oh, we love you, too, baby.

165
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:19,411
Give me
a complete digital sweep.

166
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:20,545
Yes, sir.

167
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:32,022
[sighing]

168
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,092
Thompson: Thompson here.
Vendor key.

169
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,095
I'm having Wi-Fi problems
with system 12-B.

170
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:41,232
The IT team I requested
should be coming your way soon.

171
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:42,701
I'll let you know
when they arrive.

172
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,636
Devlin: Copy that.
- Right this way.

173
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:47,171
- Our seats are right...
- Hey, what's up, tight shirt?

174
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:50,107
- Oh.
- Good-lookin' kids right there.

175
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,277
- Sure they're yours?
Jesse: Guys, this is Gus.

176
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,647
He's the, uh,
maintenance engineer.

177
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,249
So he's a janitor?

178
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:00,552
Hey, I got an important job
for you two today.

179
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:02,319
Stay real close to your dad.

180
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:04,523
Now he only gets lost,
like, once a day now.

181
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:07,191
You get lost? What a noob.

182
00:09:07,224 --> 00:09:09,828
I wish my dad would've taken me
to work when I was your age.

183
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:12,430
But I never knew him.

184
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,167
Alright guys, let's go.

185
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:23,508
And this is the security office.

186
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:26,511
- Wow.
- Wow.

187
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,246
Got some good-lookin' kids
there, Freeman. Are they yours?

188
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,283
[laughing] Why is everybody
so amazed

189
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:35,453
that I have good-lookin' kids?
I mean, what am I, a troll?

190
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,589
Dad, where's your gun?

191
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:41,158
Guns don't make you safe, son.
Strategy does.

192
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:42,427
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

193
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,563
This is head of security,
Devlin Montez.

194
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:46,565
He's my boss.

195
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:48,265
All my guards are given
state-of-the-art

196
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:50,334
security tablets
to communicate with each other,

197
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:52,737
and to track down any security
problems here in the arena.

198
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:55,574
The arena has the most
sophisticated weapons detectors

199
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,174
in the world.

200
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:59,477
No one could get on to the lot
with a small handgun

201
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:00,579
and not be detected.

202
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:03,448
So no gun, huh?

203
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:06,651
Lame.

204
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:09,153
[laughing]

205
00:10:09,186 --> 00:10:10,589
Get your family situated.

206
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:13,123
I'm gonna need all the guards
on duty on first patrol.

207
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:14,626
Our VIPs
are already in the building.

208
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:16,193
Yes, sir.

209
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:20,197
Now...

210
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,569
you guys are VIPs.

211
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:28,607
- Cool. Jinx!
- Cool. Jinx!

212
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,676
Now, do not take those off as
long as you're in this building.

213
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,745
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:35,513
You and your hormones
understand?

215
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,617
Can we go now?
I'm not trying to miss tip-off.

218
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:09,213
Hey. We're here to fix
the arena Wi-Fi.

219
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:11,650
Wow. It's a lot of you
for one job.

220
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:14,251
You ever try to bounce
a digital signal around 950,000

221
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:17,422
square feet of total space
with a seamless signal?

222
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:19,323
It's not
a two-man configuration.

223
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:21,760
Whatever.
That's above my pay-grade, pal.

224
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:25,430
We got the Wi-Fi tech crew here.

225
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:27,766
Devlin: Send 'em up.
- Copy that.

226
00:11:30,735 --> 00:11:33,237
Announcer: Welcome to the arena,
sports fans!

227
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,506
And we got a packed house

228
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:37,676

229
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,945
And we got
new Phoenix Falcons superstar,

00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:43,280
Micah Crews, in the building.

231
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:46,451
How does it feel to be playing
on a new team this season?

232
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:49,854
Your seats are right here.

233
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:54,324
You didn't get us floor seats?
These seats are wack.

234
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,494
Well, how about
you sit your little wack ass

235
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:58,228

236
00:11:58,262 --> 00:12:00,297
- I guess these will do.
Man 4: You know what, dude?

237
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,600
Man 4: Why don't you shut up?
- So I will be back...

238
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,436
I'm getting tired
of hearing this.

239
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:06,504
- I'm trying to enjoy a game.
- Hey, hey, hey!

240
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:08,740
- Can you stop? Please, stop.
- You guys break it up.

241
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:10,842
- Take your seats.
- What're you gonna do about it?

242
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,977
I'm warning you, do not put
your hands on me, sir.

243
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:16,313
- Sit down.
- Kick rocks, rent-a-cop.

244
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:18,383
- Okay, you're coming with me.
- You mother...

245
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,851
- Oh!
- You're coming with me, too.

246
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:21,619
- Let's go.
- Come on, man.

247
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:24,889
You two, stay put. Ryan's
in charge till I get back.

248
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,324
- But, daddy...
- Stay put.

249
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,527
- Come on.
- Come on, dude.

250
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:32,597
- He started this.
- That's my daddy!

251
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,299
Oh, snap. Man,
the governor pullin' up on us.

252
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:36,735
- We run this town, boy.
- Hi.

253
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:40,538
It is such a pleasure
to see you again, Ms. Smart.

254
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:43,675
- Oh. Thank you.
- You look absolutely stunning.

255
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,610
I told her that same thing
in the limo.

256
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:47,045
Your bodyguard
is very observant.

257
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:49,848
Oh, snap. Did he just call me
the bodyguard?

258
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:52,417
You know, I think what the, uh,
what the governor here was

259
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,753
trying to say is just that
we're forever grateful to you,

260
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:57,021
Diana, for taking your success

261
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:58,890
and investing it back
into our city.

262
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:01,493
Well, of course, mayor.
I was born and raised here.

263
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:03,762
I grew up coming to the arena
as a kid with my daddy,

264
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:05,295
to watch the hockey games.

265
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,465
It was my dream of one day
being able to give back.

266
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:09,366
You're also making us look good
for re-election.

267
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,771
[sighs] Just remember
why we're here, governor.

268
00:13:12,804 --> 00:13:15,073
Don't forget who you work for.
The people.

269
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:16,808
Don't forget about the 'hood,
either.

270
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:20,845
Oh, of course, of course.
People first. Always.

271
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,647
Love the 'hood.

272
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,649

00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:50,855
[grunting]

348
00:16:51,322 --> 00:16:52,824
[gunshots]

349
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,076
[chuckling] Yo. You gotta switch
to decaf, tight shirt.

350
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,911
Ooh, sprinkles!

351
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,581
Isn't there something
you should be doing?

352
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:19,617
- Doin' it!
- I gotta get back to my kids.

353
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,753
Hey, listen, man,
the south hallway's that way.

354
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:24,088
Just go straight, gets you right
back in the action. No turns.

355
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:27,892
- Can't get lost, tight shirt.
- Alright. Alright. Jesse.

356
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:29,093
[indistinct chatter]

357
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:31,029
But there's so much in here.

358
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:33,097
[indistinct chatter]

359
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,635
- Here.
- Thank you.

360
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:39,570
Alright, follow me.

361
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,639
[indistinct chatter]

362
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:46,644
Crowd: Let's go, Falcons! Oh!

363
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:48,813
Let's go, Falcons!

364
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:52,784
Let's go, Falcons!

365
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:55,653
[crowd cheering]

366
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:58,322
Just wave your hand
in front of there.

367
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,058
Automated response:
Refrigerator, open.

368
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:03,961
What? This is
on to the next level-ish, bae.

369
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:04,662
Mm-hmm.

370
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:05,897
Can I take this on tour with me?

371
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,802
- Only if you take me with you.
- Oh, for sure. I got you.

372
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:12,804
The renovations you're making
to the arena

373
00:18:12,837 --> 00:18:15,139
are definitely impressive,
Ms. Smart.

374
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:18,009
The most impressive thing
about The Odyssey is how we're

375
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:21,179
providing job opportunities in
both the green and tech sectors

376
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:22,847
amongst minority vendors.

377
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,615
Oh, now, see, that's what
you should really be proud of,

378
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:26,150
Diana,
is creating opportunities.

379
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:28,820
And making us all look good
in the process.

380
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:30,088
Asshole.

381
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:35,059
- What? I said, "Let's roll."
- Uh...

382
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:38,096
Hey, guys.

383
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:39,831
You guys new?

384
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:41,165
- What's that?
- You new?

385
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:42,834
Oh, no, first day.

386
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,035
[gunshot]

387
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:53,177
[crowd cheering]

388
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:54,846
Excuse me. Sorry.

389
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:57,081
Hope I'm not interrupting
something that's important.

390
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:01,018
I mean, this is a room filled
with very important people.

391
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:06,391
Well, holy shit.

392
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:09,026
[sniffling] You're Milli.

393
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:13,664
That's Milli.

394
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:16,334
Hey, uh, can I call you Milli?

395
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:20,071
Um, I mean, I'm just a...
I'm a huge fan.

396
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:21,239
Yeah.

397
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:23,808
Yeah, that was cool.

398
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:25,009
I hate to admit it
'cause I'm more of

399
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:28,880
a old-fashioned rock music
kinda guy.

400
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:32,984
In fact, I hate hip-hop.

401
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:35,387
Security, is there something
we can do for you?

402
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,890
Uh, first of all, that's, uh...

403
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:41,092
I have a small confession
to make.

404
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:45,930
We're not really
security guards.

405
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:49,767
Look, I'm just here to collect.

406
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,736
Whoa! Hey, hey!

407
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,239
Excuse me. Who are you?

408
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:57,975
Me? Who am I?

409
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:00,111
Well, my,
members of my team there,

410
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:02,680
they, they call me Alpha.

411
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:06,217
That makes me the alpha.

412
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,752
Milli: Yo, I know what this is.

413
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:10,188
This is one of those
prank shows, right?

414
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:12,723
Where the camera at, babe?
You in on this?

415
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:14,258
Now, is he with you?

416
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,195
Are you guys, like, some kind
of like, uh, thing, Ms. Smart?

417
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:19,797
Or can I call you Diana?
Can I call you Diana?

418
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,999
Diana it is.
Alright, here's the thing.

419
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,834
I'm only here for one reason
and one reason only.

420
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,470
Actually, uh, I lied.

421
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:29,874
Uh, one billion reasons
in your Digi-Coin.

422
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:32,743
D... do you know who I am?

423
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:35,079
I am the governor of this state.

424
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:36,881
And on behalf
of the United States government,

425
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:39,150
you are in a no-win situation.

426
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:43,187
America stopped negotiating
with terrorists years ago.

427
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:45,089
[laughing]

428
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:48,359
Terrorists?

429
00:20:48,393 --> 00:20:50,828
You're joking, right?

430
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:55,166
No, tell me you're joking.
You're not joking?

431
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,801
[inhaling] Governor...

432
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:01,138
I'm just here to get
what's owed to me.

433
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,246
Oh!

434
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:11,315
[screaming] No!

435
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:13,452
Oh, my God!

436
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:15,953
[sobbing]

437
00:21:17,422 --> 00:21:19,424
And I'm dead serious about it,
too.

438
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,394
[crowd cheering]

439
00:21:22,427 --> 00:21:24,028
I wonder
when daddy's coming back.

440
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:26,364
Who cares?
I'm all about this game.

441
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:27,865
Why are you so mean to him?

442
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:29,568
Can't you see
he's trying to be a good father

443
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,269
and take care of us?

444
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:32,803
Take care of us?

445
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:34,272
He's a security guard.

446
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:36,807
A nobody. A loser.

447
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:39,010
Daddy's not a loser.

448
00:21:39,043 --> 00:21:41,145
He ain't a superstar
like Micah Crews.

449
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:42,980
Yeah, that's who I wish
was my real daddy.

450
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:45,550
- You take that back!
- Now will you leave me alone?

451
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:47,151
I'm so into the game.

452
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:48,219
[sighs]

453
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,022
Where are you going? Sit down.

454
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:52,189
I'm in charge, remember?

455
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:53,891
You ain't in charge
of my bladder.

456
00:21:53,924 --> 00:21:55,359
I gotta pee.

457
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:58,195
Mara!

458
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:02,867
Announcer: Shooting,
number thirteen.

459
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:06,304
Can I get a glass of double,
please?

460
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:09,240
- Oh, man!
- You know what, make it two.

461
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:20,385
[indistinct chatter]

462
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:29,193
[thudding]

463
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:31,262
[grunting]

464
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:33,465
[gunshot]

465
00:22:33,498 --> 00:22:34,599
[gasping]

466
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:37,968
[grunting]

467
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:44,208
- Get her!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

468
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:46,243
[grunting]

469
00:22:47,512 --> 00:22:48,613
What do you wanna do
with her now?

470
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,348
What do you think?
Get rid of her.

471
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:53,050
I ain't killing no kids, man.
I didn't sign up for this shit.

472
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:56,220
Let's take her to Alpha.
Let him deal with it.

473
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:57,355
Hey!

474
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:59,123
[squealing]

475
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:03,961
Another one of you's gonna die
in the next quarter

476
00:23:03,994 --> 00:23:05,296
if my demands aren't met.

477
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:07,264
How am I supposed to send you
one billion?

478
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:09,266
I can't just pull up
my banking app for that.

479
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,369
Oh, come on, Diana.

480
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:14,238
You're not the only
tech-savvy one in this room.

481
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,940
You will enter routing numbers,

482
00:23:15,973 --> 00:23:19,977
bank accounts
and PIN numbers into this.

483
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,514
Once you get past the firewall,
we will begin to transfer

484
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:24,416
the Digi-Coin into our cloud.

485
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:27,318
Block-chain tech. Clever.

486
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:29,654
Oh.

487
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:31,255
Now, is that a compliment
coming from you?

488
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:33,190
You can jump out
the suite window.

489
00:23:33,224 --> 00:23:36,093
Babe, what is it...
Don't piss the man off.

490
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:38,929
Yeah, babe, why don't you listen
to your dipshit boyfriend here?

491
00:23:38,963 --> 00:23:41,533
Now, if I can bring
your attention this way,

492
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:42,701
this little lady can hack into

493
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:44,669
the entire
Odyssey communications grid.

494
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:46,170
Isn't that right?

495
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:48,038
Remember what I did
to that airport in Haiti?

496
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:51,142
Oh, yes, I do. Do it.

497
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:52,209
[chuckles]

498
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:02,987
Beta?

499
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:06,323
Why don't you cut me
some slices?

500
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,164
What you gonna do with that?
Oh, God! No, no, no!

501
00:24:13,197 --> 00:24:15,132
Hey, come on, man,
I'm too pretty to slice!

502
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,601
Look, I still gotta record
"The Booty Clap" video, man.

503
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,470
You know what it is, man.
I, I can't be looking like...

504
00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:21,272
- How come he looking crazy...
- Relax, R and B.

505
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:25,276
Gamma.

506
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:29,079
Joe: Are you in play?

507
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:36,353
I'm in the game. Communication
scrambler attached.

508
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:37,489
Alright.

509
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,066
Boy 1: Falcons! Falcons!

510
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,268
Falcons!

511
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:54,004
[crowd cheering]

512
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:56,775
- Ryan, where's your sister?
- I don't know.

513
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:58,275
What... what do you mean,
"I don't know?"

514
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:00,077
I... I know I left you in charge.

515
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,780
She said she had to go pee.

516
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:03,782
Son, you had one job.

517
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:07,051
What was I supposed to do, make
her sit here and pee on herself?

518
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:08,687
You're supposed to go with...

519
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,088
Did she have
her security badge on her?

520
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:19,330
My wife is gonna kill me.

521
00:25:19,363 --> 00:25:22,634
Sir, we've lost connection

527
00:25:51,362 --> 00:25:53,665
What is... Let me see this.

528
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:55,400
Damn, this is a VIP badge.

529
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:57,536
- Encoded footprint.
- Ah, shit.

530
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:59,236
She's being tracked by security.

531
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,539
She must belong
to somebody important.

532
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:02,139
Yeah, but we took out
all the security.

533
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:04,241
Obviously not.
Hurry up, take this.

534
00:26:04,275 --> 00:26:05,410
You take him out. I got her.

535
00:26:05,443 --> 00:26:07,211
Come on, let's go.
Come on, move.

536
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:08,813
- Let me go!
- Copy that.

537
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:11,616
- Mara?
Mara: Daddy!

538
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,586
Omega: Get up, go!

539
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:16,053

541
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:21,560
Mara!

542
00:26:24,194 --> 00:26:26,196
Where are you going, Mara?

543
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:33,137
Mara?

544
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:39,611
Oh, come on.

545
00:26:39,644 --> 00:26:43,180
[grunting] Oh, sorry, man.

[breathing heavily] Where's who?

550
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:03,668
This badge belonged
to a little girl. Where is she?

551
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:06,136
I don't know anything
about a little girl, man.

552
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,339
Oh, you think I'm playing, huh?

553
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:10,709
Does it look like
I'm playing now?

I have to find my daughter.

Come on. Jeez.

596
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:56,648
To watch my daddy kick your ass.

I've taken care
of all communication,

606
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,506
digital and Wi-Fi signals
in the stadium.

607
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,475
I've also disconnected
all of our lines

608
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:26,678
before second quarter,
as scheduled.

609
00:29:26,711 --> 00:29:30,448
Yes! The Odyssey is mine!

00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,520

coming from your direction.

614
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:46,731
You got something you wanna say
to me, Ms. Smart?

615
00:29:46,765 --> 00:29:48,399
I know you.

616
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:54,338
Jobe. Jobe Davis.

617
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:56,574
Ex-CIA, counterterrorism agent.

618
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,676
Well, holy shit.

619
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,578
I'm starting to understand
what this is all about.

620
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:02,614
What this about? This is about
what you did to me.

621
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:05,450
What you did to my team.
That's what this is about.

622
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:07,385
Okay, excuse me, mister, I...

623
00:30:07,418 --> 00:30:09,821
All that I'm trying to say is,
whatever she did,

624
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:12,657
I'm gonna be the first
to apologize for her.

625
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,592
What in the hell
did you do to this dude?

626
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:17,327
Jobe Davis mistook
an innocent American family

627
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:20,498
for a Muslim terrorist cell
and killed them.

628
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:23,535
A mother and father
with two kids, six and eight.

629
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:25,603
I hired a team of attorneys
to uncover the truth.

630
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,705
They discovered
that Mr. Davis was responsible

631
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:29,574
during an illegal raid
on their home.

632
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:31,075
Everybody makes a mistake
on the job.

633
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:34,813
A mistake? That family is dead
because of you!

634
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:37,015
Which resulted
in the destruction of my life,

635
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:38,716
including my family

636
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,519
and destroying the lives
of my team.

637
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:44,489
You.

638
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:49,060
You ever experience anything
like what's happening right now?

639
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:50,695
No. I... I think it just hit me.

640
00:30:50,728 --> 00:30:52,831
Like,
you really killed that dude.

not the murder and stuff.

man.

- Run.
- Right now?

- You sure?
- Trust me!

652
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:32,003
- Shit.
- Which way?

653
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:34,505
I don't know. Fuck it.

[groaning] I think
I pulled my hamstring.

657
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,149
Thanks for locking that.
We'll be good in here.

658
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:47,619
I, uh...
Sorry about the mess.

659
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:49,187
I don't get a lot of visitors
normally.

660
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,623
I can see why.

661
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:53,491
It's like the John McClane shit.

662
00:31:53,524 --> 00:31:55,627
- What?
- "Die Hard."

663
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,096
You never seen "Die Hard?"
Bruce Willis?

664
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:00,698
Like, all these terrorists, they
took over this Nakatomi Building

665
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:02,767
and he's like "Yipee ki-yay,
motherfucker!"

666
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,068
Hey!

667
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:06,471
- What the hell, man?
- Watch the pens.

668
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:07,639
You're talking about a movie?

669
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:10,141
I'm talking about
real life here.

670
00:32:10,174 --> 00:32:11,910
Could you just please show me

671
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:15,480
a safe route out of here
so I can find my daughter?

672
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:16,915
We can take the east hallway.

673
00:32:16,948 --> 00:32:18,716
Uh, that's the quickest way
we'll get to 'em and it...

674
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,518
it's always empty
during game time.

I'm only gonna tell you
this one time.

You do that again,
and I'mma cut you in pieces.

681

683
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:35,960
There's nobody around.

684
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:36,995

Oh. Hey there.

688
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:48,573
- Where's your badge?
- It's my first day on the job.

689
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:50,808
And where's your security pad?

690
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:53,544
Oh, must've left it
in the break room.

691
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:56,781
[laughs] She's lying.

692
00:33:56,814 --> 00:33:59,117
Uh, what is she,
five-seven, 125?

693
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,852
- I got this.
- Gus...

694
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:03,988
Ah-ah-ah...
You got the last one.

695
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,626
So you're tellin' me

696
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,163
you don't have your security
badge or your security pad?

697

I don't got her.

I'll call you a paramedic.

709
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:05,349
Just tell me
where my daughter is.

710
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:07,652
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

It's too late.

The clock is ticking,
and you can't stop it.

[groaning]

716
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:26,170
- Gus, get her earpiece.
- Uh-unh!

717
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:28,072
She already kicked me once.

718
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:29,307
Hold this.

Yo, that is one crazy bitch!

725
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:55,099
Now let's look at this bomb.

726
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,734
Gus: Bomb?

727
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,072
Holy shit!

728
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:03,141
This is a Ping-Pong bomb.

729
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:06,277
Activated via remote,
or motion-sensitive.

730
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,713
These are designed
for maximum collateral damage

731
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:11,082
in close basis,
or for troops in one place.

732
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:13,951
Or like a large crowd
leaving an arena.

733
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:15,753
You sure you know
what you're doing?

734
00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:18,122
- Can you back up a little bit?
- Sorry.

735
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,928
And... disarmed.

736
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:28,766
Just one of these has
the potential to kill hundreds.

737
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:30,034
I say we get your son
out of here,

738
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:31,403
get him safe, call the cavalry.

739
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:32,837
I'll be very honest with you.

740
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,938
I'm not getting paid enough
for this.

741
00:36:33,971 --> 00:36:35,740
No, I'm not gonna send my son

742
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:38,009
through exits
rigged with explosives.

743
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:40,077
There could be more of these,
like, at every exit.

744
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,713
There's, like, a dozen
main exits in this arena.

745
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:44,916
You heard what she said, right?

746
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:47,752
The clock is ticking. I have
to do something to stop this.

747
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:50,922
Besides, my daughter
is still in this place.

748
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:52,190
It's gonna be suicide, man.

749
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:54,091
Well, then I'll commit it
saving lives.

750
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:57,195
You can't save everyone
by yourself.

751
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,763
You're right.

752
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:02,266
But maybe with your help?

753
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:06,771
Hell, no!

754
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:15,947
The entire arena layout.

755
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,216
Look, all the exits,
right there.

756
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:21,352
Yeah. They're the most logical
places to plant a bomb.

757
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:23,120
So we'll start there.

758
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:25,256
We also need a solid way
to communicate,

759
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:26,290
should we get split up.

760
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:29,961
Ooh! Analog, baby!

761
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:33,831
They'll never hear us on these
frequencies. There you go.

762
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:35,967
Well, we got
a lot of ground to cover,

763
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,202
and time is not on our side.

764
00:37:39,538 --> 00:37:42,173
My girl Bessie'll help.

765
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:43,274
Who?

766
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:49,113
Tight shirt, meet Bessie.

767
00:37:49,146 --> 00:37:52,016
Go, Bessie. [grunts]

Diana didn't have anything
to do with your mistake.

771
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:14,905
Mayor, you're really
starting to piss me off.

772
00:38:16,575 --> 00:38:18,042
Sit.

773
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:22,046
You know,
someone like Diana Smart there,

774
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,182
who has money,
they play both sides,

775
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:26,551
judge and jury.

776
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:28,886
You don't know
how dangerous my job was,

777
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:32,823
how many innocent people
I protected. I protected.

778
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:35,427
How many years
I served my country

779
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,161
and how quickly
she took it away.

780
00:38:37,194 --> 00:38:39,997
Look, I'm sorry
you lost your family,

781
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:42,567
but they're alive,
the Faakhirs are not.

782
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:45,903
You're damn right you're sorry.

783
00:38:45,936 --> 00:38:47,838
And that's why you're gonna pay.

784
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:49,874
Anything hit the account?

785
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,412
[sighs] Nothing yet.

786
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:57,048
Hey, please don't kill me!

787
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:59,216
Look, I just started working
on my second album, man.

788
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,620
- Kill her, kill her!
- Just give him the loot!

789
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,087

- Alright?

- Who dies next.
- No.

Yes. Is it gonna be
the honorable mayor?

- Bae.

let them kill me, right?

to do that?

If anything,
you shoot the mayor, goddammit.

814

the black community properly.

Really?

816
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:15,494
- Just calm down, Milli.
- Calm down?

Bitch, I ain't tryin' to die.
Yo, no, don't, don't shoot me.

It's not so easy to pick
who lives or dies, is it?

00:40:36,548 --> 00:40:38,517
Now go sit your ass down.

Good. Let's check in with Gamma.

one more bomb to activate.

Well, I'm Alpha.
I'm running the security now.

Okay, Alpha, where's Devlin?

Oh, we've briefed
the new security on duty.

your location?

We'll bring you up to speed.

I think I'm already up to speed.

[crowd cheering]

1216
01:04:03,454 --> 01:04:06,958
Announcer: Micah Crews,
two-pointer, Falcons.

1217
01:04:06,991 --> 01:04:11,462
Tie game. You know, I couldn't
have planned this any better.

1218
01:04:11,496 --> 01:04:13,531
The audience is all gonna
stick around for the amazing

1219
01:04:13,565 --> 01:04:15,667
conclusion, and all exit
virtually altogether

1220
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,469
and chaos
will still reign supreme.

1221
01:04:18,503 --> 01:04:22,106
And by the time the cops
have dealt with the fallout,

1222
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,908
I'm gonna be long gone.

1223
01:04:23,942 --> 01:04:26,644

1226
01:04:34,485 --> 01:04:36,487
for his new team.

1227
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:39,891
Blue. White-blue.

1228
01:04:43,761 --> 01:04:44,796
Eeh!

1229
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:46,030

[dramatic music]

1231
01:04:49,067 --> 01:04:51,603
Oh, no.
I should have called in sick!

1232
01:04:51,636 --> 01:04:53,370
Shh! Shh!

1233
01:04:54,172 --> 01:04:57,876
What's that sound? Oh, yeah.

1234
01:04:57,909 --> 01:05:01,512
This is "Game Over."

1235
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:03,948
[chuckles]

1236
01:05:03,982 --> 01:05:06,618
[glass shattering]

1237
01:05:07,919 --> 01:05:09,587

- Daddy!

1238
01:05:09,621 --> 01:05:11,456
- Hey, sweetie.
Jobe: Alright.

1239
01:05:11,489 --> 01:05:13,658
Now you must be
the security guard.

1240
01:05:13,691 --> 01:05:17,061
- You must be Alpha.
- Hi.

1241
01:05:17,095 --> 01:05:19,163
[whimpering]

1242
01:05:19,197 --> 01:05:21,499
No, no, no, no...

1243
01:05:21,532 --> 01:05:24,469
Crowd: Micah! Micah! Mi...

1244
01:05:25,069 --> 01:05:27,505
You're too late.

1245
01:05:27,538 --> 01:05:29,941
No, no, no. No, please
don't blow. Please don't...

1257
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:05,977
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Hey!

1258
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:08,846
What happened?
What happened to the explosives?

1259
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,950
That's right. We defused
your little game, player.

1260
01:06:11,983 --> 01:06:13,985
Hey, freeze.

1261
01:06:14,018 --> 01:06:17,021
- Don't move.
- Wait a minute.

1262
01:06:17,055 --> 01:06:19,257
That's just a T-shirt gun.

1263
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:21,059
[intense music]

1264
01:06:21,092 --> 01:06:22,994
Kill him!

- Go! Alright.
- Daddy!

1273
01:06:50,722 --> 01:06:53,691
Oh, hell, yeah.
Much love, black man.

1274
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:55,693
- God bless you, man.
- He said he's flying away.

1275
01:06:55,727 --> 01:06:56,995
My guess is he's heading
to the helipad on the roof.

1276
01:06:57,028 --> 01:06:58,730
Take the main stairway
to the rafters.

1277
01:06:58,763 --> 01:07:00,298
Milli: I'll shout you out
on my next album, man!

There have been reports
of explosions

1288
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:47,812
from inside the arena.

1289
01:07:47,845 --> 01:07:49,714
Emergency crews are arriving
at the scene,

1290
01:07:49,747 --> 01:07:52,016
but no confirmation of injuries
or fatal...

1291
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,351

- Let me go!
Jesse: Hey!

1295
01:08:00,691 --> 01:08:03,327
Let my daughter go
and I'll let you live.

1296
01:08:03,361 --> 01:08:07,665
Yeah, okay.
You can have her back.

1297
01:08:07,698 --> 01:08:10,835
- In a few minutes, in pieces.
- Argh!

1298
01:08:11,969 --> 01:08:14,205
- Ow!
- Stay.

1299
01:08:14,238 --> 01:08:15,706
Daddy.

1300
01:08:17,842 --> 01:08:20,645
Your guns don't work that far,
anyway.

1301
01:08:20,678 --> 01:08:22,847
At least I figured that out.

1302
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:30,088
I had a perfect plan,
and you fucked it all up.

1303
01:08:32,356 --> 01:08:35,827
Kick his ass, daddy!
Kick his ass!

1304
01:08:36,395 --> 01:08:38,763

Come here, sweetie.
We gotta get this off of you.

1335
01:10:57,134 --> 01:11:00,071
I could stick around
for this sweet moment,

1336
01:11:00,104 --> 01:11:02,441
but I think
I hear my ride pulling up.

1337
01:11:02,474 --> 01:11:07,278
Plus, I just hate bad endings.
So here's what I'm gonna do.

1338
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:11,215
I'm gonna kill you
and your bitch daughter there

1339
01:11:11,249 --> 01:11:12,783

Hey. Remember me?

1343
01:11:24,195 --> 01:11:26,797
[groans] You bitch.

1344
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:28,533
You just fuckin' killed us all.

- No.

- Are you okay?
- [chuckles] It could be worse.

1353
01:12:09,974 --> 01:12:13,177
If I came home without you,
your mom would kill me.

1354

Hey.

1355
01:12:16,615 --> 01:12:18,182
You saved my life
and everyone in the arena.

1356
01:12:18,215 --> 01:12:21,052
Uh, how did you figure out
how to work that gun?

1357
01:12:21,085 --> 01:12:24,055
Basic thumb-press safety switch.

1358
01:12:24,088 --> 01:12:25,923
Okay.

1359
01:12:25,956 --> 01:12:28,460
Hey, let's go get Ryan.

1360
01:12:28,493 --> 01:12:30,961

- Dad. Mara!

1363
01:12:44,008 --> 01:12:45,209
I was so worried.

1364
01:12:45,242 --> 01:12:47,011
Were you really worried
about me?

1365
01:12:47,044 --> 01:12:50,081
Yeah. I saw the whole fight
on the rafters.

1366
01:12:50,114 --> 01:12:52,283
- You were amazing.
- Amazing?

1367
01:12:52,316 --> 01:12:55,487
- He was lit.
- Let's go. [chuckles]

1368
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,156
Um, let's just keep
this whole day between us, okay?

1369
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:00,224
Both: Nope.

1370
01:13:00,257 --> 01:13:03,194
[indistinct chatter]

1371
01:13:05,397 --> 01:13:07,098
Hey.

1372
01:13:07,131 --> 01:13:10,201
How about you consider a new
job, as head of my security?

1373
01:13:10,234 --> 01:13:12,637
Oh, you know,
I really appreciate that,

1374
01:13:12,671 --> 01:13:16,408
but I'm a 9:00 to 5:00 guy
from now on.

1375
01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:19,310
I need to be home, really home,

1376
01:13:19,343 --> 01:13:21,646
with my family, you guys.

1377
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,448
- Family first, right?
- Yeah.

1378
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:24,949
I understand.

1379
01:13:24,982 --> 01:13:27,519
Just know the new job pays
seven figures.

1380
01:13:27,552 --> 01:13:29,186
This family has bills to pay.

1381
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,523
We'll get back to you
in 24 hours.

1382
01:13:31,556 --> 01:13:32,990
[gasps] Is she for real?

1383
01:13:33,023 --> 01:13:36,193
Yo! Jessie.

1384
01:13:36,227 --> 01:13:40,064
- You guys need a lift?
- Uh, this is my partner, Gus.

1385
01:13:40,097 --> 01:13:42,099
- Oh, thank God!
- Mom!

1386
01:13:42,133 --> 01:13:44,001
Babies, are you guys okay?

1387
01:13:44,034 --> 01:13:46,971
We had the best adventure
with daddy today.

1388
01:13:47,004 --> 01:13:48,607
Did you know
dad's an action hero?

1389
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,710
[chuckles] Actually, I did.

1390
01:13:51,743 --> 01:13:53,310
- Hey, babe.
- Baby.
