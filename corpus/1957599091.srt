Where the hell were you?

190
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,261
Stupid fucking bitch.

Get on the radio.

199
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,736
Get us some backup.

200
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,004
Did you hear me?

201
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,872
(YELLING) Did you hear me?

202
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:07,806
Shit.

00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:30,763
This is one Johnson 99.

208
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:31,997
Officer down.

209
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,365
Sniper on the roof,
backup requested.

210
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,967
Fifth and Cedar.

211
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:39,972
Cover me.

212
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,047
Are you going to cover me?

I want you.

I won't hurt you.
I won't hurt you.

228
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,074
Don't hurt me.
Don't-- don't please, please.

229
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,075
I won't hurt you.
I love you.

I'm not stupid.

I can smell ya.

235
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,661
Come on, fool, show yourself.

236
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,463
I'll kill a boo, I swear.

237
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,265
I swear my mother's
brain she's dead.

238
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,133
Dead if you don't
let me out of here.

239
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,735
Isn't she beautiful, blue?

240
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,703
Aw, isn't she beautiful?

241
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,704
I love this woman.

242
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,706
She got time, baby.

243
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,709
[mwah] Blue, where you at?

244
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,111
I want you now.

245
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,280
I know where you go, blue.

246
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:08,654
Your move.

Hey, hold on.

251
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,546
Malcolm.

252
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,948
Malcolm.

00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,549

[music playing]

255
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:03,775
MALCOLM: Damn it, those three
have gone too far this time.

256
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,410
And why aren't they dead yet?

257
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,812
DANTE: Listen, Malcolm.

258
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,580
I don't care how much you
want these people dead.

259
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,816
I can't just go out there and
kill three police officers.

260
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,018
It has to be done right
and that takes time.

261
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,989
Let me tell you something,
my friend, I don't pay you

262
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,458
and others like you
to take your time.

263
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,560
DANTE: You know, you have a
bigger problem down in Mexico

264
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,661
with Cesar.

265
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,463
He wants his million
dollars, and he's had

266
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,198
it with your sniper attacks.

267
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,301
My business with
Cesar can wait.

268
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,237
What's most important
to me is the revenge

269
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,872
of my brother's death.

270
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,441
DANTE: I know that, but I don't
think you understand that Cesar

271
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,944
has tipped off the DEA,
and they are now planning

272
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,212
a raid on the nightclub.

273
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,747
I think we should
deal with that first.

274
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,418
Maybe the three police
officers could be caught

275
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,787
in the crossfire of the raid.

276
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,056
MALCOLM: Fine.

277
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,092
But you listen to
me, detective Dante.

278
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,061
You make it happen
any way you want,

279
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,765
because if it doesn't happen,
I promise you, my friend,

280
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,800
I will personally see that
something happens to you.

289
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,948
STARK: I believe these
three will make the best

290
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:23,849
unit for your operation.

292
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,320
DANTE: These are my choices.

293
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,496
What do you want
a suicide mission?

294
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,198
Sloan, Cuff and
Weston have recently

295
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,200
been transferred
to this department

296
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,336
with active suspension papers.

297
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,105
I mean, there-- there's a
reason why the LAPD took

298
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,875
their guns out of their hands.

299
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,809
Why those three?

300
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,978
The DEA has gone
over your files.

301
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,047
My office feels that these
three individuals are

302
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,782
the best people for the job.

303
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,384
The DEA would appreciate
your cooperation.

304
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,061
Cooperation?

305
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,465
What the hell do
you want to know?

306
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,768
What do you know about
these people personally?

307
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,238
How all three graduated
from the top of their class

308
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,773
at the Academy.

309
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,575
They all went to
school together.

310
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,811
They all grew up in
the same neighborhood.

311
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,381
And Billy Sloan, he is
the most recent addition

312
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,615
to the precinct.

313
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,385
Sloan is a weapons
and explosives

314
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,288
expert, served a
tour in the Marines,

315
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,523
saw a battle, decorated.

316
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:43,061
He flew helicopter missions
to recover POWs, not married,

317
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:47,632
no family, expert marksman.

318
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:54,506
Cuff is an expert in all areas
of martial arts, karate, judo,

319
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,876
state kickboxing champion.

320
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:03,915
Most of his early years work
centered around gang activity.

321
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,784
The only family he
had was a younger

322
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,453
brother who was killed
in a drive-by shooting

323
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,554
two years ago.

324
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:21,433
Ali Weston graduated law school
before entering the Academy,

325
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,635
father was a cop.

326
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,803
She wanted to be a cop.

327
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,674
Father died in the line
of duty when she was 15.

328
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:37,149
The mother is in some
hospital on life support.

329
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,185
Other than her two visits
a week to the hospital,

330
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,453
she buries herself in work.

331

[typewriter clicking]

332
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,294
These three have had
the most active files

333
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,129
since they left the Academy.

334
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:54,599
These three I feel the
worse for your operation.

335
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,067
Since joining the
force, I mean, they've

336
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,104
had a following of dead bodies
everywhere they've gone.

337
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:03,008
Collectively, they've lost two
partners in the line of duty

338
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:03,942
and seven injured.

339
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,553
Thanks for your
recommendation, Captain Stark.

[telephone ringing]

343
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,602
Sit down, Mr. Cuff.

344
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,543
You have been chosen
as a surveillance

345
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,546
unit regarding a major drug
operation in this city.

346
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,114
The purpose of
your unit has been

347
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,318
based on your past records,
your friendship, and the fact

348
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,820
that this department has
found it virtually impossible

349
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,856
to assign any of you a partner.

350
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:54,159
So we've decided to let you
renegades work together.

351
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,127
Sit down Mr. Sloan.

352
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,697
I don't need this shit.

353
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,232
What shit is that?

354
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,000
SLOAN: This renegade shit,
this finding me a partner shit.

355
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,335
If you got an
assignment assign it,

356
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,936
but don't give me this shit.

357
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,972
Nobody else created
this shit, Mr. Sloan.

358
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,873
Sit down.

359
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,481
Nobody else in
the squad has more

360
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,251
partner casualties than you with
the exception of miss Weston.

361
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,719
Miss.

362
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,022
The department
issued you a gun.

363
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,357
You pulled the trigger.

364
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,260
Now, whether you like it or
not, this is the last stop.

365
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,662
Either you play by my rules
or you don't play at all.

366
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:34,833
It's up to you.

367
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,950
[phone ringing]

368
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,788
What's the matter
with you, huh?

369
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,723
You never tell these assholes
what you're thinking.

370

00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:15,052
BAR CROWD: Yeah.

554
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,420
Yeah.

555
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,756
LARRY: Is today February 14th?

556
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,992
Hey, Tommy, is
today February 14th?

557
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:25,996
Come on.

558
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,598
You're not going to answer me?

559
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,366
I'm asking you a question.

560
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,535
Is today February 14th?

561
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:32,836
Don't answer him.

562
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:36,373
LARRY: Tommy Cuff, is
today February 14th?

563
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,009
Don't answer him.

564
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,377
What'd you like
in the 3rd one?

565
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:43,080
LARRY: Hey, Tommy, I'm
asking you a question.

566
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,648
Shove you're gold
bat up your ass, Larry.

567
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:45,549
SLOAN: There we go.

568
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:48,118
WESTON: That's great.

569
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:49,119
Batter up.

570
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,654
That will aid in
avoiding conflict.

571
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,256
Tough guy.

572
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,758
Tough guy.

573
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:59,329
Cobody A cocktail
for my enemies.

574
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,831
We're celebrating tonight.

575
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:01,765
Keep the change.

576
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,335
[music playing]

577
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,344
Let it go.

578
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,813
Come on, let's get out of here.

579
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,215
OK, look, I just want to
thank your brother, Eric.

580
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,216
OK, really.

581
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,364
LARRY: Cheers, Tommy.

582
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,367
Larry, I really don't
want a drink from you.

583
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,302
Thanks anyway.

584
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,237
What's the matter?

585
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:44,675
Not celebrating Valentine's
Day with us after that massacre

586
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,210
you pulled?

587
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,680
I feel like Al
Capone still lives.

588
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,149
How many kids you make
orphans, huh folks?

589
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,785
Once an asshole,
always an asshole, Larry.

590
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:58,522
Tommy Cuff and the guy
that could shoot straight.

591
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:01,125
[gun noises]

592
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,396
Hey, pal.

593
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:10,100
Next time you start
your car, think twice.

594
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,402
You're another one, Sloan.

595
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,804
You fucking kook lover.

596
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,441
Tommy.

597
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,046
Huh.

598
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:26,650
My old man always said, there's
no room for slacks in blue.

599
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,187
[music playing]

601
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,861
LARRY: Fuck off you
mother fucking--

602
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,429
WESTON: Come on Larry.

603
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,397
CUFF: Fuck this asshole.

604
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:43,167
LARRY: Fuck you though.

605
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,735
SLOAN: What are
you gonna do, huh?

606
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:45,869
Oh.

607
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:51,375
Yeah, come on Larry, get him.

608
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,743
Yes, Larry.

609
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:53,944
BAR CROWD: Come on.

610
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:57,714
Don't let him get
away with it, man.

611
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:58,715
Larry, come on, man.

612
00:46:58,816 --> 00:46:59,716
What's going on?

613
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:00,684
Stand up.

614
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:03,687
Stand up, man.

615
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:07,257
[fighting]

616
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,139
Fucking jerk.

617
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,106
Fuck off.

618
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,309
Hey, dickhead,
we're all cops here.

619
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,886
You really think you're
doing some work here, huh?

620
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,087
Shut up.

621
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,471
If you want to keep your job,
you'll a release officer Cuff,

622
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:59,109
go outside, get in your
car, and drive away.

623
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,311
OK?

624
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:02,412
Yes sir.

625
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:05,515
And I don't want to
see one scratch on him.

626
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,483
Yes, sir.

627
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:10,087
[music playing]

628
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:47,624
What was that,
our guardian angel?

629
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:48,558
Or the devil in disguise.

630

[music playing]

631
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:05,876
I just can't do this anymore.

[music playing]

633
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,006
Mr. Mitchell, we'll be
talking to each one of you

634
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,341
individually.

635
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,076
If I were you, I'd
clear your schedules

636
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:40,677
for the rest of the day.

637
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:41,745
Sloan, you're up.

638
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,349
[typewriter clicking]

639
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:08,238
William Sloan, James
D. Mitchell, FBI.

640
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,642
Your full name is Will
Marcelow, is that correct?

641
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,277
William Robert Sloan.

642
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,412
Can I call you Bill?

643
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,250
Can I call you Jim?

644
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,451
Tell us what happened, Bill?

645
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:26,990
Do you know how many
people got killed last night?

646
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,359
I've seen a lot of
people get killed.

647
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:30,527
So you mean you don't know.

648
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,101
Is that it, Sloan?

649
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,143
I've seen a lot
of people killed.

650
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:50,414
You've served in
the military, correct?

651
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:51,415
Navy seals.

652
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:58,355
Would you consider
yourself a trained assassin?

653
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,457
I did what my
country asked me to do.

654
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,959
You do consider
this your country?

655
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,294
Lately?

656
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,862
What do you mean, what
are you referring to?

657
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:10,434
The press being told that we
acted on our own last night.

658
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,469
No statement was
released from this office.

659
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,541
Well, sometimes
branches of government

660
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:21,344
have been known to do their
own thing to ensure the peace.

661
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:30,287
- We did get the bad guys.
- And some good ones.

662
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,293
CUFF: I guarantee you
that the bullets that

663
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:40,931
killed all those people all came
from called bags and security.

664
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,900
What happened to the money?

665
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,037
What money

666
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,072
$100 thousand.

667
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,174
I stuffed it down my bra.

668
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,443
Bullets were flying
every which fucking way.

669
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:58,849
I didn't see any money.

670
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,352
[music playing]

671
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:10,060
STONE: Officer Cuff,
it says in your report

672
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,496
you fought with a club
patron before entering.

673
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:13,563
CUFF: Yeah.

674
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,632
Well, this guy was
mouthing off in line,

675
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,868
and since I was undercover,
I thought it would

676
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,503
be appropriate to bust his ass.

677
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,937
Now, what does this
got to do with what

678
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:21,838
happened inside club X?

679
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:30,647
SLOAN: No, for the third
time, I'll telling you.

680
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,817
I heard small arms fire, which
sounded like 9 millimeter

681
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,151
semi-autos going off.

682
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,921
I turned and fired.

683
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:40,357
STONE: I'm running a check on
his military records right now.

684
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:41,858
I need a psych profile.

685
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:42,826
Right.

686
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:46,563
Sloan, William Robert.

687
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,931
Did you shoot the two officers?

688
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,469
I've seen a lot
of people killed.

689
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,304
What did you see last night?

690
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,206
There was a car crash.

691
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,574
CUFF: I was driving the car.

692
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,309
SLOAN: Chemicals that
were transporting

693
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,278
exploded in the car.

694
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,280
WESTON: The cars were on fire.

695
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,848
I remember people screaming.

696
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:06,116
Then, I heard shots.

697
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,150
Then, I heard shots

698
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,452
Then, I heard shots

699
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,488
You're all
officially suspended

700
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:14,291
until this investigation
is concluded.

701
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,526
You have to undergo
psychological testing

702
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:20,230
and be available at all
times for questioning.

703
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,434
12 innocent people
have been killed.

704
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,204
An undercover DEA agent is dead.

705
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:32,108
$100,000 in government
funds are missing.

706
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,578
And two uniformed patrol
officers answering

707
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:38,548
a disturbance are also dead.

708
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:44,621
Until we get this
story straight,

709
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:49,225
one version, none of you
is to talk to the press

710
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,795
or any other outside agency.

711
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:56,399
To do so would incur
a suspicion of guilt.

712
00:53:56,499 --> 00:54:00,370
And guilt in this
case, in this state,

713
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:04,207
could get you the gas chamber.

714
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:05,475
You're dismissed.

715
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,357
Any idea who could
have leaked to the press

716
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:23,059
about being their
being on their own.

717
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,895
How the hell do I know?

718
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,931
You know how the press is.

719
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:28,832
Hm.

720
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:35,839

[music playing]

723
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,230
What did you tell them?

724
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:48,264
Nothing.

725
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:51,034
I didn't remember anything.

726
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,203
Dead is dead.

727
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,238
Half the time I don't
even realize when I pulled

728
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:57,040
the trigger and when I don't.

729
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,411
I only remember the
fire burning, that's it.

730
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,980
What are you two gonna do?

731
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,049
I don't think we've got
much of a choice, Billy.

732
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,886
Just sit tight and
wait out the storm.

733
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:13,723
Ali, suspension is one
thing, but without pay.

734
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,491
Well, at least you
got the security gig.

735
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,160
You know, that's something.

736
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,127
Yeah, right.

737
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,630
Something.

738
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,799
Shit, what day is today?

739
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,100
Thursday.

740
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,635
I gotta go see my mother.

741
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:27,871
If you need anything call me.

742
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,173
Listen, I really
think that the best

743
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,875
thing is not to talk to anyone.

744
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,179
See you.

745
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,184
What a waste.

746
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:44,921
So what happened to you?

747
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,091
Who knows.

748
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:55,965
Take it easy with
that drink, Billy.

749
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,369
Listen, I'm going to go
and do some working out.

750
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,037
You want to come along?

751
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,872
[chuckle] No, man.

752
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:08,611
I got to go wherever the hell
it is I work, because, Tommy, I

753
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,146
need something.

754
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,080
Need A?

755
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,416
Few bucks?

756
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,084
Fuck no.

757
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:18,288
If you need some money,
I got some extra cash.

758
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,355
No.

759
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:20,256
Get out of here.

760
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,661
Look, Billy, come on.

761
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,168
Billy.

762
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,469
You all right?

763
00:59:33,569 --> 00:59:34,370
Fine.

764
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,339
CUFF: You sure?

765
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:37,273
Life is fine.

766
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:44,447
CUFF: Call you later.

767
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:48,451
Hey, come by, huh?

768
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:52,088
Bring a little take out.

769
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:53,022
I got to talk.

771
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:06,402
Hey, Maddie.

772
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,810
This is for you.

773
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,878
Put the rest on the house, huh.

774
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:16,613
Please?

[baby crying]

777
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,597
And in the massacre
of innocence case,

778
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:36,633
police officials are
refusing to comment

779
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,602
on the actions of officers
Thomas Cuff, William

780
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,437
Sloan, and Allison Weston.

781
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:44,941
But on the other hand, the
victims' families and friends

782
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,011
are speaking out loud and clear.

783
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:51,547
She was just 17, I mean, she was
here celebrating her birthday,

784
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,649
and her friends
brought her down.

785
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,618
She didn't have
to die like this.

786
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,653
These cops have got to pay.

787
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,489
They can't just go around
shooting every damn time

788
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,424
they get a chance.

789
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,259
She was just 17.

790
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,663
All my husband ever
wanted to be was a cop.

791
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:11,034
Precinct 65 was his
home away from home.

792
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,603
He was a very good
provider, and he

793
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:15,638
would have made a good father.

794
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:16,973
He didn't deserve to die.

795
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:17,673
He didn't.

He didn't deserve to die.

01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:35,858
He didn't.

800
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,300
I'm not coming back, mom.

801
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,506
I can't stand to see
you like this anymore.

802
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:51,441
It's killing me.

803
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,411

You'll be hearing from
my lawyer next week.

807
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:55,138
Look, I'm sorry.

808
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,874
I had to hit you all at once,
but it's got to be done.

809
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,942
Please don't call me.

810
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:03,479
If you have anything to
say, please just say it

811
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:04,514

Hold him down.

If they don't find you guilty,
next time it will be loaded.

01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,382
This is really arousing me.

Oh, God.

822
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:21,784
Obviously, you kept your key.

823
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:25,154
Stupid son of a bitch, what
the hell is wrong with you?

824
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,723
Look, I had no
place to go, OK.

825
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:32,161
Three men try to end my
thriving career to tine my home.

826
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,896
Yeah, by the looks
of my door, we're

No, thanks.

We know where you live.

It's only a matter of time.

836

to get an unlisted number.

been safer at my own place.

01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:48,284
Now, asshole on the street
is responsible for my life.

915
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,920
This believe it or not
it's my own responsibility.

916
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,356
And if I so choose to blow
my fucking brains out,

917
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:57,159
this, I believe,
is my right also.

918
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:58,360
Shit, we're all
going to go down

919
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,895
if we don't make a move now.

920
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,636
STARK: I don't want to hear it.

921
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:09,405
How could you have let those
three handle this assignment.

922
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,674
STARK: Don't give me crap
about this shit, huh.

923
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,076
I told that pompous
ass Dante that these

924
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,477
were the worst three
for the assignment,

925
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:16,946
and he wouldn't listen.

926
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,682
You mean you didn't recommend
Cuff, Sloan, or Weston.

927
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:20,749
What are you crazy?

928
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:24,019
Look, this is your
problem, you handle it.

929
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,988
Oh, uh, by the
way, tell Dante he

930
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,356
made a great call on this one.

931
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:33,696
MALCOLM: What the hell
is wrong with you?

932
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,664
10 men armed with
assault rifles,

933
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:38,267
and you can't take
out these three.

934
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,936
There's a backup plan in effect.
- Backup plan?

935
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:42,972
What are you, an idiot?

936
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,573
Back up plan?

937
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:48,911
Your last play cost me 10
good men, half. $0.5 million

938
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:52,948
in damage to my club, and
$1 million in chemicals.

939
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:55,551
Carried out the same operation
before and nobody has survived.

940
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:59,588
Well, they did, all of them.

941
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,090
This will be
carried out legally.

942
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,092
Between the pressure of the
media and the department,

943
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,260
they're buried.
- I've taken care of it.

944
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,896
Oh, they'll be found guilty.

945
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,632
Where were you doing the riot?

946
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,601
What, am I supposed to believe
that a jury will convict

947
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,737
three LA police officers?

948
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:16,272
Charges will be
brought against them,

949
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:19,942
and they'll be convicted.

950
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:20,876
What about Caesar?

951
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:24,446
Damn it.

952
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,087
We hit Caesar's
operation tomorrow.

953
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:35,691
[gun shots]

954
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:24,006
[music playing]

955
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:31,013
[gun shots]

956
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:07,950
[speaking spanish]

957
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:19,962
CAESAR: Sooner or later they
have to run out of bullets.

958
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,937
[speaking spanish]

959
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:33,842
MITCHELL: Where are they?

960
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:37,946
No shows, all three
of them this morning?

961
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:38,781
All of them?

962
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:40,949
All three missed their meetings?

963
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,117
Every one of them, yes.

964
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,186
What happened to the
tales we had on them?

965
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:45,487
Not enough men.

966
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:48,891
They weren't scheduled
until this morning.

967
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:49,925
Where's Dante?

968
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,126
I don't know, sir.

969
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:52,861
I've been trying to reach
him at home all morning.

970
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:54,530
Soon as you hear from him,
tell him I want to see him.

971
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,932
You got it.

972
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:59,468
Get me everything you
have of those three.

973
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,069
I want to eat,
sleep, and breathe

974
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,972
them till they're back here in
this office, you understand?

975
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:06,275
Yes, sir.

976
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:11,980
I swear to God, I will track
them down wherever they are.

977
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,684
CAESAR: I apologize for bringing
you down here like this,

978
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:19,054
but let's face it, if I would
have sent you an invitation,

979
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:21,323
would you have come?

980
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,392
I didn't think so.

981
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:26,295
This is my village
and my business.

982
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,263
What business are you in?

983
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:29,965
I import and export.

984
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:32,100
Marijuana and cocaine.

985
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,069
I am a man of my word.

986
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,204
I am not a liar.

987
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:38,841
And I consider a
lying man a dog.

988
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:43,579
I am in the drug trade,
but my drug operation

989
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,248
is also responsible for all
the people in my village

990
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:50,285
having jobs and being able
to support their families.

991
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,921
If taking out last
the bombing rates.

992
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,490
Excuse me, but how many people
is it worth losing to keep

993
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:57,559
your zero unemployment rate?

994
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,162
We don't force
people to take drugs.

995
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:03,932
They create their own hell.

996
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:07,035
You three have a serious
problem in and so do I.

997
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:10,439
What the hell do we
have to do with you?

998
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,774
We have a common enemy.

999
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:15,878
I used to have a
partner in the trade.

1000
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:19,648
Greed has a way of interfering
with people's working

1001
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,850
relationships.

1002
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:26,088
This, um, guy, what
does he got to do with us?

1003
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,290
CAESAR: Have either
of you been associated

1004
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:32,060
with a name, Marshall Gumstock?

1005
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:32,861
Never heard of him.

1006
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:34,396
Sounds like a stockbroker.

1007
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:37,099
Or the name, um, Malcolm?

1008
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,066
Malcolm?

1009
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:41,470
Aw, yeah, Mr. Sloan.

1010
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,804
Never heard of him.

1011
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:46,742
This man, Malcolm
owes me $1 million.

1012
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:50,779
You bring me the million
dollar and him, you keep half,

1013
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,714
I keep half, Malcolm.

1014
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:01,223
I have never seen
so much shit before.

1015
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:04,960
MITCHELL: Well, everything
can tell you something.

1016
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,695
And the more
information we have,

1017
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,431
the better chance we have
of saving their lives.

1018
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:11,466
Saving their lives?

1019
01:16:11,566 --> 01:16:12,634
You think it's their fault?

1020
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,940
When was the last time
we were in the field?

1021
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,775
Well, I've never
been in the field.

1022
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,843
I've just always
been in the office.

1023
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:26,381
You know, when I was a kid, a
police officer in the community

1024
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:27,849
got respect, believe it or not.

1025
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,786
We used to wave to the
cop on the B. Today,

1026
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:35,490
we get laughter instead of the
mornings, smart-assed replies

1027
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:37,392
and slurs, instead of sir.

1028
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:44,800
If I were on the street
today with the street having

1029
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,102
more fire power than the
department in many cases,

1030
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:49,204
I'm not so sure I
wouldn't shoot first

1031
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:52,040
and ask questions later too.

1032
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,309
I don't think it's
their fault. I think

1033
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,478
we let him down, the system.

1034
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:58,213
DANTE: With due
respect, I think we're

1035
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:01,350
talking about three individuals
here who don't value life,

1036
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,151
other people's or their own.

1037
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:05,754
These aren't police
officers, they're cowboys.

1038
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,155
Where the hell have you been?

1039
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:08,991
Why don't you run a
credit check on bill Sloan?

1040
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:10,993
Three eviction notices,
an apartment full of drug

1041
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:13,495
paraphernalia, it's not a
stretch to think that he'd

1042
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,530
be seduced by $100,000.

1043
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:17,099
I've been running a cross-check.

1044
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,233
Good.

1045
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,868
MITCHELL: Trying to get
something new, but you

1046
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,436
didn't answer my question.

1047
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:23,538
DANTE: What's that?

1048
01:17:23,638 --> 01:17:26,575
Where have you been?

1049
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:29,044
I had a dentist appointment.

1050
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,712
You know, by the
look of their records,

1051
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:35,384
these guys have taken out
some really strong people.

1052
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:40,889
Why did you pick Sloan,
Cuff, and Weston for the job?

1053
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,324
Because at the
time, I felt they were

1054
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,659
the best people for the job.

1055
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:45,060
That's not what Stark thought.

1056
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,461
DANTE: What the hell
does Stark know?

1057
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:49,297
He knows his men.

1058
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,099
So why did you pick them?

1059
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,634
Solidarity.

1060
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:53,902
They were best friends.

1061
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,237
Why didn't you just
look at the records?

1062
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,505
They're born shooters.

1063
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,807
That's what they are.

1064
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,809
I mean, it's obvious.

1065
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,944
You knew there was
DEA on the inside.

1066
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:09,084
Are you suggesting that
I'd sacrifice one of own?

1067
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,585
Did you?

1068
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,753
I'm not answering
that question.

1069
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,355
- (YELLING) Did you?
- Fuck you, no.

1070
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:17,325
[phone ringing]

1071
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:19,227
No.

1072
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:20,696
I'm telling you,
it's not a good idea.

1073
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:22,564
He's offering us
weapons, transportation,

1074
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:23,632
and $0.5 million.

1075
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:24,533
I don't like it.

1076
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:25,801
Oh, you don't like it?

1077
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:27,002
What do you know about
this guy, Malcolm?

1078
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:27,903
He doesn't know anything.

1079
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:29,037
Don't fuck around.

1080
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:29,771
Who is he?

1081
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:30,939
I don't know anything.

1082
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,107
He said he doesn't
know anything.

1083
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:33,341
Leave him alone.
- OK, he knows, OK.

1084
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:34,810
I saw the look in your eye.

1085
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:35,911
(YELLING) I don't
know anything.

1086
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:37,179
Call me fucking stupid, OK.

1087
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:39,414
Don't start this
shit now Tommy.

1088
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:40,749
(YELLING) Billy, talk to me.

1089
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:42,217
You shouldn't be
involved in this.

1090
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:44,119
But you're hiding
something from me?

1091
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,354
Malcolm, Malcolm,
Malcolm. (YELLING)

1092
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,223
Who the fuck is Malcolm.

1093
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:49,191
I had the drop.

1094
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,926
He moved.

1095
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:52,761
A man died in my arms.

1096
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,967
So he's dead, but he
was connected the way

1097
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,536
you guys are connected with me.

1098
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:02,571
Malcolm wants one of us.

1099
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:04,005
We all go in, we all die.

1100
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,679
All right.

1101
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:14,282
We're all in this together.

1102
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:15,984
WESTON: So if we don't
take Caesar's offer,

1103
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,419
what do you want to do?

1104
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,087
I don't know, escape.

1105
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:23,391
Way south to the beaches.

1106
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:26,595
Return to Mitchell
and, uh, surrender.

1107
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:28,396
What you think counselor?

1108
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:30,065
No escape, no return.

1109
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:33,001
Grab the cash, grab Malcolm.

1110
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,136
New lives, huh, son.

1111
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:38,340
What is your decision?

1112
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,178
MITCHELL: Anything?

1113
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:49,818
Why the hell wasn't
this on his record?

1114
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:51,419
Look at date.

1115
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,955
It happened two weeks ago and it
wasn't filed until last night.

1116
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:55,957
Mr. Mitchell, What
you find out, Johnson?

1117
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:59,194
Three suspects were taken down
to Ceaser Sanchez's compound

1118
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:01,062
late last night.

1119
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,798
You know Marshall Gumstock.

1120
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:03,732
A.k.a.

1121
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:05,033
Malcolm, who doesn't?

1122
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,768
DEA has been after
him for years,

1123
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:08,937
but we haven't been able
to make anything stick.

1124
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:11,339
He's been feuding
with Cesar Sanchez.

1125
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:12,707
I didn't know that.

1126
01:20:12,807 --> 01:20:14,976
What the hell does that have
to do with this investigation?

1127
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,846
Sloan killed
Malcolm's brother.

1128
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:19,080
He probably doesn't
even know that.

1129
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,349
JOHNSON: The word is
Cesar has imported

1130
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:22,184
Cuff, Sloan, and Weston.

1131
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,251
He's seeking their employment.

1132
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:24,986
You know, if my
feeling is right

1133
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:28,523
our shooters are headed on a
direct course with Malcolm.

1134
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:32,494
Johnson, Stone, come on.

1135
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:34,095
I'll put out a warrant.

1136
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:39,868
MALCOLM: I assure you that
Caesar Sanchez will soon

1137
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:42,470
pose no threat to
your careers, so you

1138
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,906
have nothing to worry about.

1139
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:45,941
Thank you, Malcolm.

1140
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:47,876
And how are you this morning?

1141
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:50,979
Very good, thank you.

1142
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:53,114
There's a phone call
for you in the study.

1143
01:20:57,452 --> 01:20:58,286
It's great.

1144
01:20:58,386 --> 01:20:59,321
When did he do all
this renovation?

1145
01:20:59,421 --> 01:20:59,955
Oh, I don't know.

1146
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:01,189
It's gorgeous.

1147
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:02,157
Beautiful.

1148
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:18,840
Yes?

1149
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:22,110
DANTE: Sloan, Cuff,
and Weston are loose.

1150
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,279
MALCOLM: That doesn't
make me very happy.

1151
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:26,781
I've also learned that
they were contacted by Cesar.

1152
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:30,252
You, my friend,
are on my death wish.

1153
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:32,787
You have made promises
you have not kept,

1154
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:35,290
and you have put me in
a very bad position.

1155
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,325
I'm sick and tired of
your threats, Malcolm.

1156
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:39,194
I can't cover it anymore.
I'm out.

1157
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:41,529
You'll be getting a
visit from the FBI soon.

1158
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:45,567
The man's name is
Mitchell, James Mitchell.

1159
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:46,468
Dante.

1160
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:54,009
Why did you do it?

1161
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:58,380
Money?

1162
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:05,720
Yes.

1163
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,322
Yes.

1164
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:08,323
For $1 million.

1165
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:22,037
Malcolm wanted the three
kids and the DEA agent dead.

1166
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,309
I was there.

1167
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:36,251
There was no way they could
come out of that place alive.

1168
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:39,587
I know with three
against 12, I--

1169
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,392
they pull off a miracle.

1170
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:52,467
Malcolm bet a million on
a sure thing and lost.

1171
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,939
I gambled my career.

1173
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,722
MITCHELL: Detective
Edward Dante, you're

1174
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:17,058
under arrest for the
murders of officers Kevin

1175
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,394
Donaldson and Jack Silver.

1176
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,196
Kindly surrender your weapon.

Matthew, Alex,
come on talk to me.

1191
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:36,090
He can't talk
right now, Malcolm.

1192
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:40,261
Aw, so the three
little piggies decided

1193
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:44,332
to hunt down the big, bad wolf.

1194
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:49,470
Well, let the hunt begin.

1195
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:55,510
You know, I heard somewhere
the more people a man kills,

1196
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:58,279
the more of himself
he kills too.

1197
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,949
Well, Malcolm, you
and I have killed

1198
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:03,985
a hell of a lot of people.

1199
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:07,855
And it all starts to add up
to one day some low-life scum

1200
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:12,594
shoves a gun into an
innocent girl's mouth

1201
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:15,363
and threatens to
blow her brains out.

1202
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:19,867
Well, Malcolm, let me
tell you, your brother

1203
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:25,106
was a pitiless, soulless
piece of dog shit.

1204
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:28,409
Damn, he wasn't worth the
piece of lead I spent on him.

1205
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:33,481
For some God damn reason,
second I pulled that trigger,

1206
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,316
it suddenly hit me.

1207
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:39,520
I pulled it on myself too.

1208
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,456
Problem is my heart's
still beating.

1209
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:43,424
MALCOLM: Well,
don't worry Sloan,

1210
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:47,128
because I can fix that problem.

1211
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:49,297
I'll take care of
your two partners too.

1212
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:57,772
Lord knows, they've been a
pain in my ass for a long time.

1213
01:27:57,872 --> 01:27:59,374
SLOAN: You know what
your brother said

1214
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:00,642
to me with his dying breath?

1215
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:05,113
Hey, blue, tell Malcolm
he's an asshole.

You want me?

You want some of this?

1223
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:26,901
Come on then, come on.

1224
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:33,608
Come and get me.

There's something I thought
they should know, sir.

1238

We found burned fragments
of some material

1239
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:06,494
in the mountains yesterday,
three separate bundles.

1240

Bundles?

1241
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:09,230
Has the lab checked
the materials?

1242
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:11,199
Our preliminary is parachute.

01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,138

So can I buy you a drink?

1245
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:27,448
Thanks, but I think
I've got some things

1246
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:32,553
to take care of before I
fly back to Washington.

1247
