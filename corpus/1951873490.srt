00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,967
I...had to.

187
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:09,036
Mrs. Harwich, why did you
have to drown your daughter?

188
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:18,679
I want them to cry.

189
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:20,748
Cry...
Make them cry.

190
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,551
Who cry?

191
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:27,688
Rachel knows.

192
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:29,457
Rachel?
Who's Rachel?

193
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,592
Rachel of Rama.

194
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:42,170
I know you.

195
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:46,274
You're like me.

196
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:48,142
You want what I want.

197
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,845
- Enough with the games.
- Our son.

198
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:52,880
Who are you?
Answer me!

199
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:54,315
Scott, back off.

200
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,519
<i>He betrayed me...</i>
<i>Revenge...</i>

201
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:02,156
Make it stop.

202
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,797
Mrs. Harwich.
Make what stop?

203
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:12,033
The voices.

204
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:14,936
<i>Revenge...</i>

205
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,471
<i>Give me my baby.</i>

206
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:23,544
I killed Lisa...

207
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,814
I killed my baby.

208
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:25,773
Perez, quit being a dick.

209
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:34,248
Perez?

210
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:38,186
[whisper]
<i>It's your fault.</i>

211
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:41,889
Daddy, don't leave.

212
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,759
You need some Pepto?

213
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:03,177
Listen up, Perez.

214
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:05,112
You get that partner
of yours under control

215
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,948
or he's going
to psych evaluation.

216
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,282
He's just a little stressed,
that's all.

217
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,384
Yeah?
Who isn't?

218
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:14,722
Hey, sweetheart.
How are you doin'?

219
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:15,823
I missed you.

220
00:26:15,858 --> 00:26:17,425
I was gonna call you.
I just got back.

221
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:18,593
I missed you, too.

222
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:20,628
Your wife called.

223
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:28,469
Hey.

224
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,171
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

225
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,206
What's this bullshit,
you're fine?

226
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:37,945
I'm fine.

227
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,814
I thought you were gonna
ram that table down her throat.

228
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,782
And Tanin's about to ship
you to the funny farm.

229
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,918
This is what
I was talkin' about.

230
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:46,020
You gotta stay focused.

231
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,991
They're taking Harwich
to central booking now.

232
00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:59,233
San Miguel, ayudame!

233
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:04,005
San Miguel?

234
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:08,075
I should've stayed in Cuba.

235
00:28:06,702 --> 00:28:08,169
[screaming]

236
00:28:32,528 --> 00:28:34,862
Everything you wanted to
know about sacrificial cults.

237
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:36,497
Happy reading.

238
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:38,533
Yo, Taylor.
What do you think?

239
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:41,669
[phone rings]

240
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:45,506
Scott, Homicide.

241
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:51,045
Scott, Homicide.

242
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:54,348
Look, for prank calls,
call the FBI.

243
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,651
I'm not...crazy.

244
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:58,753
That makes one of us.

245
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:04,425
I saw you this morning...

246
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,661
on the street,

247
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:08,196
then TV.

248
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,666
I don't give out autographs,
if that's what you want.

249
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:15,837
It's just...those kids...

250
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:18,239
The ones that are missing.

251
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:20,041
What about them?

252
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,846
I know who it is.

253
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,114
You do?

254
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:30,451
You don't get it.

255
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,220
I see them...

256
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:33,754
when it happens.

257
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:35,456
When what happens?

258
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,393
You can stop it.

259
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:40,695
Look, I don't have
time for this.

260
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:42,730
I see you.

261
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:49,537
I'm gonna need
a name and a number.

262
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,450
Another prank call?

263
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:05,186
Where's that coffee?

264
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:09,156
Baby...
Where's your magic spray?

265
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,959
[child weazing]

266
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,231
<i>Alex.</i>

267
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,274
Where is it?

268
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:41,389
What's crawling up his ass?

269
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,790
Been like that
since you left, man.

270
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:44,959
Why do you think
they called you back?

271
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:47,195
What's happening?

272
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:49,230
Gotta take care of your partner.

273
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,733
How am I supposed
to take care of my partner

274
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,602
if nobody tells me
what's going on, man?

275
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:56,270
He's cracked
all the biggies.

276
00:30:56,305 --> 00:30:58,105
This one's cracking him.

277
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:01,275
You didn't get them from me.

278
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,048
Detective Vega,
Homicide.

279
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,654
Suit up, Taylor.
We got another body.

280
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:16,557
Later, Perez.

281
00:31:16,592 --> 00:31:18,226
Later.

282
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:28,336
"Ms. Yates described
hearing voices."

283
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,411
Mrs. Harwich,
why did you have

284
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:39,113
to drown your daughter?

285
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,349
I want to make them cry.

286
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:43,384
Cry...
Make them cry.

287
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:49,390
"Todd Scott, a 4-year-old boy,
was found dead in his apartment

288
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:54,562
by his father, Alex Scott,
a Wall Street financial analyst.

289
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:56,998
Lisa Scott, the child's mother,
is being held for questioning."

290
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:01,536
Holy shit.

291
00:32:06,575 --> 00:32:08,709
I know you.

292
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:11,946
You're like me.

293
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,749
You want what I want.

294
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:17,518
Alex.

295
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:22,223
I hear you crying.

296
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:24,025
You can't stop me.

297
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:25,760
Answer me!

298
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:31,532
Make it stop.

299
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,358
Where we going?

300
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,826
See a friend.

301
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:08,236
Don't worry, baby.

302
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,971
It's gonna be OK.

303
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:13,434
That's bullshit.

304
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,269
Look, man, this isn't procedure.
I gotta be there.

305
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,470
It's personal.

306
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:17,872
What isn't?

307
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:19,173
I don't want to
get into it.

308
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,641
You got to get into
something sometime.

309
00:34:20,676 --> 00:34:22,109
Look...

310
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,178
I'm gonna see him myself, OK?

311
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,517
Fuck it.
I gotta find a bathroom anyway.

312
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:36,257
What's it been?
Seven...eight years?

313
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,792
Eight.

314
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,661
So why now?

315
00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:49,470
Today...

316
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:52,306
a woman killed her kid.

317
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:56,444
She said Rachel knows.

318
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:05,686
There was this...
these voices....

319
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:08,523
this crying.

320
00:35:11,894 --> 00:35:13,561
I just think they may
have something to do

321
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:15,696
with the missing kids.

322
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,435
You still haven't forgiven
yourself, have you?

323
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,774
Todd was my son.

324
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:28,910
And Lisa was his mother.

325
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:30,745
How could you know?

326
00:35:34,116 --> 00:35:35,950
Rachel cries,

327
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:38,386
like any mother
who loses her child.

328
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,989
Like Lisa did after
she took Todd's life,

329
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:44,292
and before she took her own.

330
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:51,632
You know what's
going on, don't you?

331
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:55,937
It's simple.

332
00:35:55,971 --> 00:35:59,407
Your demons are
staring you in the face.

333
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:02,310
What are you
going to do, Alex?

334
00:36:08,517 --> 00:36:11,052
I want you to see
a friend of mine.

335
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,620
She knows things.

336
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:14,155
Knows things?

337
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:16,324
Things the Church condemns.

338
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:18,426
Ask her about La Llorona.

339
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,161
What's that?

340
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:21,896
The answer.

341
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,468
Fear...

342
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:29,871
It's everywhere.

343
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:32,907
You can smell it
in the streets.

344
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:35,810
We got a floater.

345
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:37,144
Father.

346
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,681
You still have that
medal I gave you

347
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:43,050
when you made your
First Communion?

348
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:49,190
Saint Michael, Archangel,
defend us in battle.

349
00:36:51,593 --> 00:36:53,394
Thank you, Father.

350
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:02,336
And thrust into Hell,
Satan and the evil spirits

351
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:05,373
who prowl the world
for the ruin of souls.

352
00:37:08,844 --> 00:37:10,678
(Father)
Amen.

353
00:37:13,182 --> 00:37:14,715
Don't worry, baby.

354
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,350
We're almost there.

355
00:37:35,204 --> 00:37:36,871
You did this.

356
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:40,875
You don't want to help me.

357
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:42,677
You're with her.

358
00:38:06,602 --> 00:38:08,736
You ever heard
of La Loreena?

359
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,004
La what?

360
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,406
I don't know.
It's like, La Lorena.

361
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:15,076
La Yoh-roh-na.
Yeah, I heard of her.

362
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,544
These Mexican kids
where I grew up,

363
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:18,179
they were obsessed with her.

364
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,547
Her?

365
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:21,749
Yeah.
The crying woman.

366
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:23,317
La Llorona.

367
00:38:23,352 --> 00:38:25,653
Yeah, well what's her story?

368
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:28,089
Some guy cheated on her,
or something like that.

369
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:32,293
So she lost it and then...

370
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:34,028
And then what?

371
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,130
She drowned her kids.

372
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:39,000
Because of that
she was cursed forever.

373
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:41,302
You know these
Mexicans, man.

374
00:38:41,336 --> 00:38:44,205
Their parents used to
scare the shit of us.

375
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,473
They used to say stuff like,

376
00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:47,875
"Don't go by the river
or she'll get you."

377
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:57,952
I don't get it.
What is she?

378
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:01,556
One angry bitch.

379
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,791
That's what she is.

380
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,574
I saw your name
on the ops order.

381
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,042
Thought you might
want a first look.

382
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:22,376
All right, so what
are we looking at?

383
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:24,445
Some guy walking
his dog found it.

384
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:28,082
The good news is the fish
population is back.

385
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,586
The bad news,
there's not much left.

386
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:34,655
Perez, I hope you
have an iron stomach.

Yeah.
I'm cool.

One of your MIAs?

399

Hard to tell.

400
00:40:47,396 --> 00:40:49,564
It was a boy.

401
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:51,699
Look.

402
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:54,135
Looks like some kind
of braided branch?

403
00:40:57,339 --> 00:40:59,640
Bag it for evidence.

404
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:02,410
Have them canvas the river
a quarter-mile down.

405
00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:04,912
And tell the M.E.
I want DNA yesterday.

406
00:41:04,947 --> 00:41:06,581

Making breakfast.

410
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:22,063
Yeah.
Ice cream with fudge sauce.

411
00:41:23,332 --> 00:41:25,233
She's asleep.

412
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:30,938

Hey, Wall Street.

417

Take care of yourself.

We gotta make a stop.

421
00:41:57,032 --> 00:42:00,568
What's this, man?
First a priest, now a curandera?

422
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,270
A curandera?
What's that?

423
00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:03,905
She's like a witch.

424
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:04,972
Let me guess.

425
00:42:05,007 --> 00:42:07,842

Meet us at the park.
The angel.

432
00:44:16,672 --> 00:44:19,740
You know, this morning,
in the interrogation room.

433
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:21,909
There was something strange
going on, don't you think?

434
00:44:23,212 --> 00:44:26,214
Like, you guys knew
each other already,

435
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,249
or you knew something like her.

436
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:36,924
You know what?
Now that I think about it,

437
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:39,927
she reminds me of my mother.

438
00:44:39,962 --> 00:44:41,062
Those eyes.

439
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,930
And that voice.

440
00:44:42,965 --> 00:44:44,098
Jesus.

441
00:44:44,132 --> 00:44:46,801
You know my mom.
What do you think?

442
00:44:48,704 --> 00:44:51,172
I think we should
cut down Broadway.

443
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:01,148
Yeah.
It's probably faster.

444
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:23,638
Hey.

445
00:45:23,672 --> 00:45:25,640
I know.

446
00:45:25,674 --> 00:45:27,808
Know what?

447
00:45:27,843 --> 00:45:30,178
About you and your kid.

448
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,947
We're partners, man.

449
00:45:35,951 --> 00:45:38,085
You know, this morning,
when that reporter asked us

450
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,988
why would a woman
kill her own kid?

451
00:45:43,058 --> 00:45:45,693
All that shit
they must go through.

452
00:45:45,727 --> 00:45:47,228
Every breath they
take must feel like

453
00:45:47,262 --> 00:45:49,630
a razor slashing
into their guts.

454
00:45:49,665 --> 00:45:52,166
Maybe they're just
trying to breathe.

455
00:45:54,436 --> 00:45:56,003
And you?

456
00:45:56,038 --> 00:45:58,439
Are you trying to breathe?

457
00:45:59,374 --> 00:46:01,709
Dead people don't breathe.

458
00:46:48,957 --> 00:46:50,358

She wants to know
what took us so long.

00:47:38,674 --> 00:47:40,474
Sit down.

464
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:55,990

came here to ask her.

can stop her pain.

revenge against men

Men like the one
that betrayed her.

She's the monster that
puts the evil eye on mothers

500
00:51:02,578 --> 00:51:05,279
because she wants to be
in the company of misery -

501

There's not much time.
