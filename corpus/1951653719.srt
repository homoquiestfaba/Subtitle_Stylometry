Ah! Rachel!
What are you doing?

17
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,344
I want you out
of here now!

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,684
All right,
calm down, darling.
Calm down.

19
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,280
You have no business here.

20
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,346
I work here.

21
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,414
Not anymore.

22
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,755
What do you mean?

23
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,796
You're fired.

24
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,424
Where am I supposed to go?
You kicked me out of the flat,
I need the rest of my clothes.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,025
I'm keeping the rest
of your clothes

26
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,468
so I can burn them!

27
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,131
Fuck you, Rachel!
This is ridiculous.

28
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,300
You can't run a restaurant
without a chef!

29
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,400
That is not
your concern anymore.

30
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,211
I know you're upset, darling.
Don't you think you're going
a little tiny bit over the top?

31
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,876
Do you remember
what you told me
last night?

32
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,581
You had a threesome.
You had sex
with two girls.

33
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,488
One isn't bad enough.
You had to do it with two!

34
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,082
It doesn't count
as two, darling.

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,149
What?

36
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,458
It happened
at the same time.

37
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,466
So it's one indiscretion
with each girl
counting as half!

38
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,331
<i>If anything,</i>
<i>it's better than one</i>

39
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,235
because it shows
there were no
real emotions involved.

40
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,671
Get out!
Get out.

41
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,867
<i>No emotion.</i>

42
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,612
What are you waiting for?

43
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,479
<i>Have you been having sex</i>
<i>with someone in here?</i>

44
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,079
Right, that's it.
I want you out
of here now.

45
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,183
And if you so much as
set foot on my cafe,
I'm calling the police.

46
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,922
I'm gonna stand out here
until you have calmed down.

47
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,010
Good morning.

48
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,569
<i>(Grandma)</i>
<i>Oh, what lovely roses.</i>

49
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,172
<i>They're all dead!</i>

50
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,382
Grandma,
how are you doing?

51
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,424
Look.
Grandma,

52
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,825
you're not really supposed
to be here, okay?

53
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,387
Just sit here quietly.
I'll go get you
a nice cup of tea, right?

54
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,698
I'll be right back.

55
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,438
My God.
Do I feel like crap today.

56
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,443
I know.
Me, too.

57
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:35,777
Remind me the next time Dylan
suggests an after-hours drink,
to punch him in the face.

58
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,043
I feel like someone
shat in my mouth.

59
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,106
That's nice.

60
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,176
What's going on
with Charlie?

61
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,484
I just saw him half naked
out in the corridor.

62
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,319
Rachel kicked him out
last night.

63
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,517
No!

64
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,686
Don't you remember?
They'd a screaming row,

65
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,457
and then she told him
she'd never want
to see him again.

66
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,989
Bloody hell.
I thought they were
the perfect couple.

67
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,697
Well, they were,
except that he was fucking
other people.

68
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,897
<i>[door opens]</i>

69
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,962
<i>[humming]</i>
<i>Morning, Tom.</i>

70
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,473
Morning.

71
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,102
Oh, Tom, would you mind
doing the cooking today?

72
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,167
Me?

73
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,975
Yeah.
Is that okay?

74
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,446
I'll do my best.

75
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,540
<i>I thought we'd do</i>
<i>a lasagna special.</i>

76
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,433
What are you gonna have?

77
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,207
Mike.

78
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,183
<i>I really think I'm too stoned</i>
<i>to be here right now, Danny.</i>

79
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,486
You need to relax, man.

80
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,647
I'm beginning to feel
extremely anxious.

81
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,623
What are you gonna have?

82
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,059
Mike?

83
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,826
Why are you--
Why are you looking
at me like that?

84
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,890
I'm just wondering
what's with the hat.

85
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,869
Shit hair cut.
I'm single for the first time
in four years,

86
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,837
I'm not gonna pull
with a shit hair cut.

87
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,137
I don't know.
Let's have a look.

88
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,214
It looks the same
as it always does.
Like shit.

89
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,520
<i>Danny, don't look now,</i>
<i>but there's a woman</i>
<i>over there.</i>

90
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,182
She's really strange looking.
She's staring at me.

91
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,282
What woman?

92
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,759
I told you not to look.

93
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:33,197
Do you think if I went
over there and sat
in that chair opposite her,

94
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,394
she'd think I was sitting
on top of the person
she's talking to?

95
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,267
I don't know.
She's freaking me out.

96
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,606
<i>Dylan.</i>

97
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,043
Charlie's gone.
I'm having to do
all the cooking.

98
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,809
Do you think you'd like
to join us for work
at all today?

99
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,679
I feel like shit.

100
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,653
<i>I'm waiting for my agent</i>
<i>to call, okay?</i>
<i>I'll be there in a minute.</i>

101
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,314
I'll tell Rachel.

102
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,757
Give me a break.
I'll be there in a minute!
You're like my mother!

103
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,233
[telephone rings]

104
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,932
Hello?

105
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,907
<i>(woman)</i>
<i>Rachel, Davies</i>
<i>is coming in today.</i>

106
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,841
Today?

107
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,173
Does it have to be today?

108
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,577
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

109
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,706
No, that's fine.
At what time?

110
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,183
<i>Don't know.</i>
<i>It could be any time</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

111
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,844
You will let me know
what time.

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,285
<i>I'll try.</i>

113
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:33,052
Okay.
Thanks.

114
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,821
Shit!

115
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,330
I shouldn't have had
that split before lunch time.
It's too early for me.

116
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,628
Where did you get
that stuff, Danny?

117
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,792
Julian.

118
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,133
Jesus Christ! Julian?
The guy's a maniac.

119
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,401
He pumps his stuff
with all kinds of shit.
God knows what was in it.

120
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,635
It's what makes it great.

121
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,907
Give me strength.
What are you trying
to do to me?

122
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,916
You get me stoned off me tits
and bring me to a place
full of freaks.

123
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,417
Now she's got me off.

124
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,248
<i>All right, mate,</i>
<i>calm down.</i>

125
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,991
[grumps]

126
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,616
Okay.

127
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,628
Danny, please, can we go now?
I'm starting to get upset.

128
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,096
Mike, I think you're having
a paranoia attack.

129
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,360
No shit.

130
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,460
Dylan, why
aren't you inside?

131
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,799
You are unbelievable.

132
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,203
Don't blame Tom.
We've got customers.

133
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,003
<i>I'm waiting</i>
<i>for my agent to call.</i>

134
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,942
We were supposed to talk
to the publishers on Wednesday.

135
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,812
I'm sure he'll call when he's
got something to tell you.
Get in.

136
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,818
You're such an ass.

137
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,380
So do we have to work
while you sit on your ass
all day?

138
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,450
You're not the only one
with a splitting headache,
you know!

139
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,820
It started since
you split up,

140
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,191
and you started acting
like a such fuck up case.

141
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,361
Excuse me?
Correct me if I'm wrong,

142
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,804
but wasn't it you
that told me
to split with her?

143
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,569
I said you shouldn't get
married.

144
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,041
It amounts
to the same thing.

145
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,079
Yeah, but what's that about?
Giving you ultimatums?

146
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:05,948
<i>Women know that no man</i>
<i>in their right mind</i>
<i>wants to get married. Ever.</i>

147
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,782
But only do it
'cause they put them
under psychological

148
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,618
and emotional pressure.

149
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,023
<i>Why is it women spend</i>
<i>their entire lives</i>
<i>dreaming about weddings</i>

150
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,186
and men avoid them
for as long as possible?

151
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,854
I don't know.

152
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,730
<i>Because the old concept</i>
<i>is completely</i>
<i>female-orientated.</i>

153
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,929
It's a celebration
of female victory
over the male.

154
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:29,065
At least it's better than
being alone and miserable
for the rest of your life.

155
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:56,927
Oh, bollocks, mate.
You need to learn to go out
and enjoy the single life.

156
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,436
<i>I bet she is.</i>

157
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,335
<i>I bet you</i>
<i>she is going out</i>
<i>right now,</i>

158
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,069
getting laid by every Tom,
Dick, and Harry she can get
her filthy hands on.

159
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,974
Danny, what are you saying?

160
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,104
Women are like that, mate.
They act like,

161
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,776
"Oh, I'm gonna crumble and die
if you break up with me."
Bullshit!

162
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,652
<i>She is going out,</i>
<i>having great sex</i>
<i>with a variety of partners,</i>

163
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,385
doing all the weird sort
of experimental shit
she could never do with you.

164
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,825
Could you just please
shut up, all right?

165
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,621
Mate, I'm just trying to help.

166
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,825
Don't help.

167
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,731
All right,
here you go.

168
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,038
You'd better get a move on.
We're starting to fall behind.

169
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,509
How am I meant to do
all these?

170
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:46,312
My God, Tom,
what the hell is that?

171
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,945
[glass whistling]

172
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,491
Do you have to do that?

173
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,464
Do you have to read
while we're sitting together?

174
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,433
I told you
I was gonna read.

175
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,401
You invited
yourself along.

176
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,837
Because I thought
that you might want
to talk to me.

177
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,468
I did talk to you.
We had a nice chat.

178
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:15,344
Now I'm reading.
Why don't you get yourself
a paper?

179
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,847
Can I get
a latte, please?

180
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,349
Uh, sure.
Anything else?

181
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,509
No, that's it.

182
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,813
It's a good book.

183
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,319
Yes, it is.

184
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,888
What was all that about?

185
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,152
What was all what about?

186
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,319
The business
with the waiter.

187
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,625
What is wrong with you?

188
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,460
He was mentally
undressing you.

189
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,830
He was doing his job.
Don't be ridiculous.

190
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,495
Doing his job?
Yeah.

191
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,936
<i>Where are you going?</i>

192
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,906
I'm gonna take a piss.

193
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,910
Can you go for a couple
of minutes without flirting
with any strangers?

194
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,875
I can't give that
to our customers, Tom.

195
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,614
It smells like old vomit.
What's it meant to be,
anyway?

196
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,985
That's lasagna.

197
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,354
Lasagna?
Are you joking?

198
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,552
I'm not a chef.
What do you want from me?

199
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,358
You're gay, aren't you?
Gay men are supposed
to be able to cook.

200
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,591
That's conventional.

201
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,657
Here, smell that.

202
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,038
Jesus Christ!
What is that?

203
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,970
It's meant to be lasagna.

204
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,338
<i>It's meant to be</i>
<i>lasagna?</i>

205
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,843
<i>Nobody complained</i>
<i>about it on Tuesday!</i>

206
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,742
I tried to
freshen it up a bit!

207
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,750
My God, I'm doing
the best I can under very
difficult circumstances!

208
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,777
Rachel, smell that.
Tom says it's meant
to be lasagna.

209
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,949
Out of interest,
is anyone planning
on doing the washing up?

210
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,549
Why don't you do it
for a change?

211
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,821
I can't serve that.

212
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,021
<i>You don't wash up!</i>

213
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,563
<i>Does that look</i>
<i>like lasagna?</i>

214
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,599
Willy, Charlie!

215
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,032
People, please!

216
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,764
I can't cope with you acting
like small children.

217
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,329
I know we all feel
like utter shit,

218
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,568
but we're just gonna have
to pull together.

219
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,009
Charlie's gone.
Until I can replace him,

220
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,876
<i>we're just gonna have</i>
<i>to make do.</i>

221
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,938
I saw him.
We could ask him
to come in.

222
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,484
He's not to come in.
Is that clear?

223
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,543
<i>Yeah.</i>

224
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,247
Go on, Tom.

225
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,814
You help with the customers.
Tell them we're out
of the pasta special.

226
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,305
Bloody twat.

227
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,306
Dylan.

228
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:34,443
We've got a real nut job.
Table six. You'll have
to deal with her.

229
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,147
No, no chance.

230
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,123
Come on.
I always have to handle
the weirdos in this place.

231
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,160
No. Just let her sit there.
She'll get bored
and leave.

232
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,629
<i>You two are a couple</i>
<i>of pussies, aren't you?</i>
<i>She's my grandmother.</i>

233
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,790
Your grandmother?

234
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,094
Yeah.
You got a problem?

235
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,532
Does she look freaky lookin'?

236
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,470
<i>That's the way you look like</i>
<i>when you spend half your life</i>
<i>in an institution.</i>

237
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,938
Does Rachel know
she's here?

238
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,237
No, she doesn't.
And you'd better
not tell her,

239
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,506
unless you want these tongs
to be a permanent part
of your anatomy.

240
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,979
Wait until she gets here.

241
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:07,951
Find yourself a random girl.
Shag her. Dump her.

242
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,488
That ought to sort you right.

243
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,346
Out.

244
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,358
What?
What is it?

245
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,395
Mate, I think your luck
just came in.

246
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,798
The table over there,
right behind you.
Do you recognize that bird?

247
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,399
<i>No.</i>
<i>Who is she?</i>

248
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,202
Mate, she's a bloody
porn actress.

249
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,903
Wait here.
I'm gonna talk to her
for you.

250
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,968
Don't be insane.
What are you gonna say?

251
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,846
A mate split up
with her girlfriend and needs
a little female company.

252
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:38,975
No, you can't say that.

253
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,109
<i>Sure I can.</i>

254
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,017
The drugs have fucked
with your brain.

255
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,611
Rubbish.
Going over there.

256
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,920
Don't do it.
It's gonna end in tears.
Probably mine.

257
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,418
[clears throat]

258
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,825
Hi there.

259
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,493
Hello.

260
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,197
Look, I--

261
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:03,207
I hope you don't mind me
coming over here or anything,
but, uh,

262
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,774
I just had to tell you
that I...

263
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,647
really love your work.
I mean, I think that you
bring pleasure

264
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,244
to a lot of men.
Myself included.

265
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,380
I'm sorry?

266
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,219
You know, with the films
you are in.

267
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,054
No, I don't know.

268
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,857
Yeah, you do.
There was that one you did.
It was brilliant.

269
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,127
<i>Walking to the men's song</i>
<i>and end up being shagged</i>
<i>by three blokes.</i>

270
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,532

is going on?

271
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,872
Hi.

272
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,237
What are you doing?

273
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,468
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>We're just--</i>

274
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,341
This guy has
mistaken me
for someone else.

275
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,110
Really?
Are you sure--

276
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,209
<i>She said that you had</i>
<i>the wrong person.</i>

277
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,776
<i>Oh, right.</i>

278
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:55,523
Okay, yes.
Sorry about that.
That's, uh, fair enough.

279
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,756
Sorry, mate.

280
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,231
[clears throat]

281
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,097
What happened?

282
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,073
Wrong girl, apparently.

283
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,734
Fucking snob.

284
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,651
You all right?

285
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,020
Yeah, I'm fine.

286
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,193
He's not worth it,
you know.

287
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,760
It's not just Charlie.

288
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,163
Then what is it?

289
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:40,101
I've applied for a job
at the Marion.

290
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,072
The Marion?
Bloody hell.

291
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,440
Yeah. The manager
position was up.

292
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,948
I've had two interviews,
and now the owner wants to come
here to check out the cafe.

293
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,212
He's coming today.
Like he couldn't come
any other day.

294
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,946
Christ, Rachel.

295
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:01,155
Am I hallucinating or was
that guy insinuating that
you were in a dirty movie?

296
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,421
I think he might
have been.

297
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,924
How dare he?

298
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,763
I'll just go
over there right now
and put him straight.

299
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,326
It was a mistake, Mark.
Just forget about it.

300
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,464
Forget about it?
I mean, it's not true, is it?

301
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,135
How can you even ask me that?
Of course it's not true.

302
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,007
Do you swear it
on your life?

303
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,343
You want me to swear
on my life?

304
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,939
Yeah. Why not?
If it's not true,
swear on your life.

305
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,578
Because I don't swear
on my life.
I don't!

306
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,748
Fine. Just look me
in the eye and tell me
that it's not true.

307
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,385
For God sake's, Mark.
It's not true!

What do you mean, "shit"?

313
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:55,775
I mean, you weren't supposed
to find out like this.

314
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,641
How could you do
something like this?

315
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,085
It was just to make
some extra money.

316

Literature degree.

What are you doing?

319
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,163
Don't be so melodramatic!
It was only sex!

Shh!
Don't say that word.

321

Look, just tell me,
how many men did you fuck
in these things?

I don't know.

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,868
it effectively
makes you a whore.
A filthy fucking whore!

336
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,341
Sir, you cannot shout
like that in here.

337
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,208
You want me to leave
so that you can fuck
my girlfriend?

338
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,339
No, I don't want to fuck
your girlfriend.

339
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,679
Oh, really?
All right.

340
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,447
<i>Who here wants to have sex</i>
<i>with my girlfriend, huh?</i>

341
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,081
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Who wants to ask her?</i>

342
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,419
What's going on?

343
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,392
Vanessa, I'm handling it.
Thank you.

344
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,157
I was going to
ask you to marry me.
Can you believe that?

345
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,391
I wanted you to be
the mother of my children.

346
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,401
<i>Oh, look at that.</i>
<i>He had your whole life</i>
<i>planned out.</i>

347
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,595
What a great guy.

348
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,195
This has absolutely nothing
to do with you.

349
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,467
Is it in your nature
to be this controlling

350
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,772
or are just compensating
for having a small penis?

351
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,336
Vanessa, enough.

352
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,440
Sir, I have to ask you
to take it outside, okay?

353
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:42,146
Mark, why don't you go outside
and see if you can find
some perspective?

354
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:52,989
You okay?

355
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,260
Yeah.
Fine, thanks.

356
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,376
You really need
to grow yourself
a decent size pair of balls.

357
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,538
Vanessa, the guy left,
didn't he?

358
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,548
Yeah, he needed
a good walloping.

359
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,345
That was really something.

360
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,682
<i>The way you singlehandedly</i>
<i>fucked up that couple's</i>
<i>relationship.</i>

361
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,278
<i>That's quite impressive.</i>

362
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,757
It's not my fault
if they can't deal
with their own shit.

363
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,387
<i>What's that guy's problem?</i>
<i>So, his girlfriend</i>
<i>is a porn actress.</i>

364
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:29,628
<i>For one thing,</i>
<i>she's probably extremely</i>
<i>uninhibited in bed.</i>

365
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,068
<i>I bet you she's up</i>
<i>for all sorts of weird shit.</i>

366
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,798
Where're you going?
You can't leave me
on me own.

367
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,070
It'll be two minutes.

368
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,583
Do you think you can just
do whatever you want
and not be punished for?

369
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,551
You sick pervert.

370
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,588
You'll suffer
for what you've done.
You're disgusting.

371
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,385
You should be locked up.

372
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,417
Pervert.

373
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,519
Grandma, what the hell
are you doing?

374
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,292
It's the handling
and the mistreatment.

375
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,170
What's the matter with you?

376
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,901
# <i>Woo-hoo</i>
<i>Woo-hoo</i> #

377
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,945
# <i>Come on,</i>
<i>Come on</i> #

378
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,640
# <i>Woo-hoo</i>
<i>Woo-hoo</i> #

379
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,546
# <i>Come on,</i>
<i>Com on</i> #

380
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,914
What the--

381
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,222
Excuse me.
Can I have a table
for two, please?

382
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,654
Sure.

383
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,330
Thank you.

384
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,696
You didn't hear the way
she was talking to me.

385
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,501
She told me
I was going to suffer.

386
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,372
The woman
is clearly insane.

387
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,174
Fuck off!
I'm not sitting
in the toilets all day.

388
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,478
It's your fault
'cause you got me
too stoned, didn't you?

389
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,214
I can't deal
with this shit, Danny.
Not now, not--

390
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,183
It's not funny.
I've got a pain
down me left arm.

391
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,354
I could be having
a heart attack.

392
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,829
Okay, mate.
Calm down.

393
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,708
Hello, Tom.

394
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,479
Hello, Charlie.

395
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:29,980
How's Rachel?

396
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,989
Not great.

397
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,615
<i>She says</i>
<i>you're not allowed in.</i>

398
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,059
<i>You have to wait outside.</i>

399
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,857
All right, mate.

400
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,967
Tom, have you got
any idea about this?
I found it in Rachel's office.

401
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,596
No.

402
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,272
Excuse me.

403
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,553
Laura?

404
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,821
You must be Steve.

405
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,429
I'm relieved
I can tell you.

406
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:18,128
I was worried that Sean
wasn't gonna set me up
with the right minger.

407
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:22,264
I'd have to dart out
the door.
[laughs]

408
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,433
Right.

409
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,908
How long do you think
this guy is gonna be?

410
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,679
You gotta take a dump?

411
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,846
Why don't you use
the urinal?

412
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,446
I wanna use the cubicle.

413
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,185
I don't like
taking my penis out
in front of other men.

414
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,022
What are you worried about?
Is it--

415
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,529
I'm not worried
about anything, Danny.

416
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,998
I just find
the whole situation
a bit uncomfortable.

417
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:54,869
We're just expected
to stand there
and expose our... bits.

418
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,603
You're afraid of getting
an erection, aren't you?

419
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:03,239
I reckon that's what it is.
You're afraid you'll catch
sight of another man's penis

420
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,840
and you'll sprout
a giant erection.

421
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,579
Michael, there's nothing
wrong with being gay.

422
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,645
I never said there
was anything wrong
with being gay, did I?

423
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,486
Have you been
waiting long?

424
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,287
Not too long, no.

425
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,091
Oh, good.
I thought I might've been
a bit late, you know.

426
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:22,258
I've been out
buying meself a new gun.
[laughs]

427
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,402
Don't worry.
I'm not a nutter
or anything.

428
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,032
It's for pigeons, mostly.
[laughs]

429
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,576
I kill a lot of pigeons
'round our house, you know.

430
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,771
Cropping on the roof.

431
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,780
And squirrels.
Pfft!
[laughs]

432
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,611
<i>Dirty little bastards.</i>

433
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:44,914
It's the latest model.
Twelve gage.
Double barrel shotgun.

434
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,321
Sounds nice.

435
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:47,756
It's great.
You'd love it.

436
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,657
I'll show it to you.
It's in the car.

437
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,491
No, that's all right.
Thanks.

438
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,123
So, are you
into guns then?

439
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,861
Uh... not massively, no.

440
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,895
Sometimes I wish
I was gay.

441
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,633
Really? Wow!
Why is that?

442
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,699
One way to avoid
the gender-divide nightmare.

443
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,644
<i>Think about it.</i>
<i>Never having</i>
<i>to second-guess a woman.</i>

444
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,011
Never having to worry about
what you're gonna say

445
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,209
that was gonna annoy her
or turn her off you.

446
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,345
If you're gay,
you've gotta deal with
getting shagged up the ass.

447
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,945
<i>Are you all right</i>
<i>with that?</i>

448
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,854
Yeah.

449
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,985
At least I know
I was gonna get shagged
up the ass.

450
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,929
<i>Not that uncertainty</i>
<i>that you have with women.</i>
<i>The question hanging over.</i>

451
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,329
Will we, won't we?

452
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,927
I reckon I could go
out there tonight,
find a bloke

453
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:36,167
and pretty much rest assure
I'd get shagged right up
my back passage.

454
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,368
<i>[toilet flushes]</i>

455
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,772
Hello.

456
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,613
So how do you know Sean?

457
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,916
Oh, I actually shared
a flat with him, you know.
Back in the day.

458
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,424
Do you remember when
he used to work as a clown
in children's parties?

459
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,460
What was he like
to live with?
Was he fun?

460
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,519
Oh, you don't want to know
about that.

461
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,588
Yeah, I do.
Go on.

462
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,101
Well, I shouldn't
really say this,
but the truth is

463
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,865
Sean spent
most of his time

464
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,937
masturbating.

465
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,702
Oh!
Really?

466
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,505
<i>Any chance he would get.</i>
<i>Morning, noon, or night.</i>

467
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,672
It was like he was addicted
or something.

468
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:20,707
Don't tell him
I told you this, right?
Because he still doesn't know.

469
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:25,620
<i>But we once hid</i>
<i>a video camera in</i>
<i>his room and taped him.</i>

470
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,453
[laughs]

471
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,285
<i>To this day</i>
<i>I have in my house</i>

472
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,890
<i>a video tape</i>
<i>with Sean wanking.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>

473
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:38,163
<i>Got me the funniest thing</i>
<i>you've ever seen</i>
<i>in your life.</i>

474
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,294
All right.

475
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,635
How is it
you know Sean, anyway?

476
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,503
He's my brother-in-law.

477
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,475
Oh, right.

478
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,138
All right?

479
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,908
How are you?

480
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,510
I hope you don't mind.
Angela's on her way.

481
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,451
Oh, right.

482
00:25:56,521 --> 00:26:00,548
We're going to sort out
the flowers for the wedding.
Turns out they lost our order.

483
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,855
Can't believe it.
A week before the wedding.

484
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,091
I wouldn't wanna be
in their shoes with Angela
on the war path.

485
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,654
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

486
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,633
Listen, uh, David.

487
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,260
I've got something
to show you.

488
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,895
What's that?

489
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,237
This arrived
at my doorstep this morning.

490
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,076
Gee! My God,
what the hell is that?

491
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,445
It's a dead rat, David.
What do you think it is?

492
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,279
What are you doing
with it?

493
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,343
First you've gotta promise me
you're not gonna tell anyone.

494
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,286
Not even Angela.
Do you promise me?

495
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,153
Of course.
I promise.

496
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,125
I remember I used
to go to the Marion
when I was a little girl

497
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,185
and just peek
through the window.

498
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,458
I thought it was
this amazing place.

499
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,194
I'm so close
to getting this job
that all I think about

500
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,361
is that I'll be letting
everyone here.

501
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,406
<i>My dad managed</i>
<i>this place for years.</i>

502
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,737
He actually died here.

503
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,245
He had a heart attack
right here in this kitchen.

504
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,440
Just feel like
I'd be abandoning
everything he worked for.

505
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:03,778
Rachel, I really think
you've worked your ass off
here long enough.

506
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,517
<i>Quite frankly, I think</i>
<i>you deserve something more.</i>

507
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,559
Thanks.

508
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,063
Don't tell the others, okay?
I don't want them
getting all neurotic.

509
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,361
Yeah, I won't say a word.

510
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,832
What's going on?

511
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,334
Nothing.

512
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,378
<i>I bet that guy</i>
<i>thinks I'm gay now.</i>

513
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,113
Well, you did say
you were definitely gonna get
fucked up the ass tonight.

514
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,849
So maybe.

515
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,686
<i>I should go and tell him</i>
<i>I'm not gay.</i>

516
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,750
Who gives a shit
if he thinks you're gay?

517
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,455
<i>I don't like</i>
<i>being misrepresented.</i>

518
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,930
<i>[peeing]</i>
<i>Oh, God.</i>

519
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,363
<i>Mate, what the hell</i>
<i>are you doing in there?</i>

520
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,766
Danny, I think
I might have a problem.

521
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,638
What sort of problem?

522
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,204
When I go to the toilet,
it kind of comes out
in dribs and drabs.

523
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,646
[laughs]

524
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,776
<i>I think I've got a problem</i>
<i>in me prostate.</i>

525
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,184
I'm sacred
I might be developing
a cancer.

526
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:14,191
But you're not a doctor.
You can't diagnose yourself
with cancer.

527
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,523
You see?
I've had it
for about three weeks.

528
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,425
It's not getting
any better.

529
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:23,126
I put my symptoms into
the Internet and I got 3,000
results for prostate cancer.

530
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,793
I'm genuinely scared,
Danny.

531
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:29,238
You should go to a doctor.
I guarantee he'll tell you
it's nothing.

532
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,570
What are you doing?
You can't smoke that
in here?

533
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,804
Keep your pants on.

534
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,707
<i>So, I'd just been down the pub</i>
<i>for a couple of pints.</i>

535
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:43,419
Janey's been a total
nightmare at the moment.

536
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,581
She's stressed out
by the fucking baby.

537
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,751
I just needed
some time by myself.

538
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,819
So, it's about 11:30
and on my way home.

539
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,659
And I really badly needed
a slash.

540
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,133
So, I go down the alleyway
behind the pub,

541
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,467
and I'm just about
to have a piss
up against the wall

542
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,200
when I hear
someone coming, right?

543
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,435
Well, first I think,
shit, you know,

544
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,604
I'm gonna be marked
or murdered or something.

545
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,511
But then I turn around

546
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:16,452
and there's just this
little girl staring up at me.

547
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,386
And I'm quite
freaked out.

548
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:22,790
I'm looking at her,
and I don't realize
that I have still got

549
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,091
my cock in my hand.

550
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,859
Jesus!
So what happened?

551
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,662
Well, she just stares at me
for a while,

552
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:34,831
and then she gets this, like,
weird, horrified look
comes over her face.

553
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:38,933
Then she runs off screaming,
"There's a pervert
wanking off down the alleyway."

554
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,978
"Wanking off"?!
[clears his throat]

555
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,644
Can I get you anything?

556
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:49,483
Um, yeah.
I'll have
a cappuccino, please.

557
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,919
<i>I'll have a latte,</i>
<i>please.</i>

558
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,786
Sure.

559
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:58,455
Wanking off? My God!
So, what did you do?

560
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,294
Obviously, I got out of there
as fast as I could.

561
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:06,065
But I was almost home
when a police car
pulls me over

562
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:10,073
and tells me I match
the description of a pervert
they've been looking for.

563
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:15,704
They took me down the station
and charged me with public
indecency involving a minor.

564
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,910
The girl was 12 years old,
and she's walking the streets
at that time at night.

565
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,542
It's a disgrace!

566
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,293
Charlie!
How're you doing, man?

567
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,733
I'm doing terrible.

568
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,168
Do you know
where this comes from?

569
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,366
No.

570
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,968
I found it on the floor
in Rachel's office.

571
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,103
Really?

572
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,441
Yeah, really.

573
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,505
And you think
she used it with someone.

574
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,916
I don't know.
I can't think about that
at the moment.

575
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,549
Why did you do it, Charlie?

576
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,091
It was a threesome

577
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,118
with two girls.
They were
identical twins, Dylan.

578
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,891
What the fuck
I was supposed to do?

579
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,956
What the hell
did you tell her for?

580
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,523
I don't know.

581
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:14,470
Honestly, I just
hated going to her.
I couldn't do it anymore.

582
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,473
And then when the booze
came out,

583
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,873
it just... came out.

584
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,173
<i>More and more and more.</i>
<i>I couldn't stop it.</i>

585
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:26,684
<i>Truthfully,</i>
<i>I absolutely screwed up,</i>
<i>because I love that girl.</i>

586
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,645
Do you think
she's gonna forgive me?

587
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,782
It doesn't look good.

588
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,994
I gotta go.
Take care.

589
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,189
Yeah.
Thank you.

590
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,166
He's over there.

591
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,897
Excuse me.
I ordered--

592
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,905
Oh, bollocks.

593
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,100
I don't know
what you're talking about.

594
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,665
I'm sorry about this.

595
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,609
<i>Did you see him?</i>
<i>He's over there.</i>

596
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,045
Do you want
to get me fired?

597
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,844
No, of course not,
dear.

598
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,680
Just sit here.

599
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,743
Vanessa, what's going on?

600
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,913
Nothing.

601
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:08,516
She's my grandmother.
She gets one day
out of the home a month,

602
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,494
and it was my turn
to look after her.

603
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,189
She can't stay here.

604
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:17,758
Please, Rachel,
I promise you it'll be fine.
You won't have to worry.

605
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,530
What happened to her?

606
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,096
She came home one day
to find her husband of 20
years dressed up as a baby

607
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,836
with a big nappy on,
and being spanked
by a prostitute

608
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,003
in a nursemaid's outfit.

609
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,239
Look, today's a big day
for me, Vanessa.

610
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,582
Just make sure
she doesn't mess it up, okay?

611
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,887
Tom, I'm gonna take
five minutes.

612
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,925
Okay.

613
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:48,898
I'm telling you, mate,
you should try
some of this.

614
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,868
How many times
do I have to tell you?
I don't want any of it.

615
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:55,201
<i>[coughing]</i>

616
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:01,904
God!

617
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,743
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>is going on in here?</i>

618
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,247
Are you doing drugs?

619
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,052
<i>No.</i>

620
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,557
It's, uh--
It's my friend's.

621
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,759
He uses this
for medical reasons.

622
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,626
Then why
are you smoking it?

623
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,299
Because--

624
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,395
[clears throat]
Shall we go for dinner
some time?

625
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,172
Just get out.

626
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,209
I'm really sorry.

627
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,881
Why did you tell her
I had medical problems?
You had the medical problem.

628
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,893
What difference does it make?
Besides, you're the one
with the dodgy prostate.

629
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,485
What about the thing
in the bag?

630
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,087
It came with a note saying,
"I know where you live."

631
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,657
It's perfectly obvious.
They put the packet
in my doorstep.

632
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:01,262
Jesus, John!
Is there anything
I can do to help?

633
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,204
Well, here's the thing.

634
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,766
When the police arrested me,
I was a bit flustered,
as you can imagine.

635
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:11,304
So, when they questioned me,
I denied having been anywhere
near the alleyway.

636
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,748
So, what did you tell them?

637
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,183
I told them
I was with you.

638
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,619
You told them
you where with me?

639
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,950
Yeah, at your house.

640
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,957
You told them
you were at my house?

641
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,083
Yeah.

642
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,151
<i>John, I'm a lawyer!</i>

643
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,095
That's why I thought of it!
They'd never suspect you.

644
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,100
Are you joking?
Now the police
are going to contact me,

645
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:33,069
and I'm gonna have to lie
and tell them
you were at my house!

646
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,604
It's not okay?

647
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:38,164
No! No, it's not okay.
What if they found out
I was lying?

648
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,676
I wouldn't be able
to practice law again.

649
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,576
What the hell
were you thinking?

650
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,205
I didn't know
what else to do!

651
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,441
<i>(Charlie)</i>
<i>Vanessa.</i>

652
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,369
You're not supposed
to be here.

653
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,072
Ouch!
Give me one second,
all right?

654
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,777
I found this
in Rachel's office.

655
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:21,944
That's nice.

656
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,077
Is it yours?

657
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,519
Of course it's not mine.

658
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,784
It has to belong to somebody.
Who's is it?

659
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,759
Look, stop waving
at my face!

660
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,227
I don't know, okay?

661
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,355
But look at the facts.

662
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,560
You tell Rachel
you shagged some other girls.

663
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,230
Ended having
a screaming row with her.
She kicks you out.

664
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,240
She goes up to the office
where she's comforted by Dylan,

665
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,105
and no one sees them
for half an hour.

666
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,372
It doesn't take
a genius, Charlie.

667
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,674
Dylan?

668
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,079
Oh, Christ.

669
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,981
What did you think?

670
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:57,350
That there was
one rule for you
and another for her?

671
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,219
You know, maybe
she just thought
like you.

672
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,692
She fancied a shag
and Dylan was available.

673
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,264
Dylan?

674
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,171
Why aren't you eating?

675
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,763
I can't eat.

676
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,809
I've got no appetite.

677
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,573
I need some salt.

678
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,883
<i>(female voice)</i>
<i>I'm a teacher.</i>

679
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,312
Bloody hell.

680
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,355
What's the matter?

681
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,127
I don't believe
what I've just seen.

682
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,228
If I tell you,
promise me you're not
going to get upset, okay?

683
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,897
Why would I get upset?

684
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,238
Laura's here.

685
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,974
Laura?

686
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,777
As in... my Laura?

687
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,042
Yeah.

688
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,140
Where is she?

689
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,812
She's over there
behind that pillar.

690
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,223
Hi!
I was wondering
if Sam Harvey's back, yet?

691
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:13,787
I left a message
earlier. It's Dylan.
Tell him I'll call again.

692
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,332
<i>(man over the phone)</i>
<i>I've got your number</i>
<i>right here. 7247, right?</i>

693
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,769
No.
No, it's not 7247.
It's 7267.

694
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,430
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>I've got it wrong?</i>

695
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,031
'Cause it's my number.
I think I know
my own number.

696
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,100
<i>Right here</i>
<i>it says 7247.</i>

697
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,738
What do you think?
That I gave you
the wrong number

698
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,941
or you wrote it down wrong?

699
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,985
<i>Before I started business,</i>
<i>I used to live</i>
<i>with this geezer,</i>

700
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:39,352
<i>and he thought it was</i>
<i>gonna get bad. I said,</i>
<i>"Go on your own, then."</i>

701
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,722
<i>He goes on his own,</i>
<i>and the next thing I know</i>
<i>is he falls off the roof.</i>

702
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:46,251
What was all that about?
He ends up in hospital.
He can't work.

703
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,802
It's definitely her.
Definitely Laura.

704
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,670
Who's the bell-end
she's with?

705
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:01,940
Bet they're over there
having the time of their life
while I'm suffering in torment.

706
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,675
He is well built.

707
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,146
Hey.
You okay?

708
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,179
What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like if I
don't get my novel published

709
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,191
my life won't be
worth living?

710
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,284
Dylan, it was only
your first attempt.

711
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:20,694
A lot of writers wait years
before they get published.

712
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,996
My uncle wrote his whole life.
Didn't get published
until he was 81.

713
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,060
That's good to know.
Thank you.

714
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,503
Sorry.

715
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,005
How're you doing?

716
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,941
Terrible.
I feel like someone took
my brain out of my head

717
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,207
and kicked it
around for a while
and stuck it back in.

718
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,607
Charlie is still waiting
to talk to you.

719
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,050
He can wait all year.

720
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,781
The guy looks
absolutely wrecked, Rachel.

721
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,824
Good!

722
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,089
Don't you think
you should have a little
conversation with him?

723
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,027
He's looking
like a homeless person.

724
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,327
Dylan, you're not
gonna make feel guilty.

725
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,592
[clears throat]

726
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,194
<i>We'd better get back</i>
<i>to work.</i>

727
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,977
Oh, I'm so hungry
I could eat
an entire animal.

728
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,877
Do you know
what I mean?

729
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:14,247
Not those little
vegetarian meals you get
at some of these places.

730
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,613
You're not one of those,
are you?

731
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,985
One of what?

732
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,456
Vegetarian.

733
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,050
Actually, I, I am
one of those.
Yeah.

734
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,756
<i>That's fair enough.</i>
<i>It happens I've met several</i>

735
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,061
and they seem like
perfectly normal people.

736
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,327
Why shouldn't they be?

737
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,961
Exactly.
I'm not saying
I understand them,

738
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,699
but each to their own.
That's what I say.

739
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,606
God knows I've got
some pretty warped
ideas meself.

740
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,735
What's warped about
being a vegetarian?

741
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,472
Nothing.
I'm just saying.

742
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:46,414
That it's warped
not wanting some animals
to suffer for no good reason?

743
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,179
Going to get all militant?

744
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,277
I'm just stating
an opinion.

745
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,551
And there's nothing wrong
with a woman having
her own opinions.

746
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,148
What does that mean?

747
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,750
There's nothing wrong
with it.

748
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,727
Of course there's
nothing wrong
with it.

749
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,593
Exactly!

750
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,799
What you really
want to do is

751
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,331
make her jealous.

752
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,203
How the hell
am I gonna do that?

753
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,742
Easy.
If you got together
with that porn actress,

754
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,745
I bet that
would make her jealous.

755
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,179
Have you ever suffered
a serious head injury?

756
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,810
<i>Forget it!</i>
<i>I'm not going to lie</i>
<i>to the police.</i>

757
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:26,755
No! Do you have any idea
what Angela'd do to me
if she finds out?

758
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,451
Jesus! That woman
rules your life!

759
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,016
That is not the point.

760
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,994
So, what do you
expect me to do?

761
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,155
I don't know.
You'll have to go
back to them

762
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,823
and tell them
you made a mistake.

763
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,597
Tell them I made a mistake?
They're gonna think
I'm guilty as hell.

764
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,162
You should've thought
about that before you decided
to show your cock

765
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,038
to an under-aged girl.

766
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,011
My God.
You think I did it,
don't you?

767
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,106
Well, wouldn't be
the first time you've strayed
from the path, would it?

768
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,620
How can you compare
that to this?
That is completely irrelevant.

769
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,554
I don't think my Aunt Betsy
would agree with you there.

770
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,488
I was 12 years old!

771
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,154
<i>Besides, I don't know why</i>
<i>you're getting on your moral</i>
<i>high horse about.</i>

772
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,220
When we all know about
your foibles.

773
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,822
Foibles?
What do you mean?

774
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:12,164
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

775
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:16,969
<i>How do you think</i>
<i>Angela would take it</i>
<i>if she found out about that?</i>

776
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,084
Rachel, I need to talk to you.
Give me one minute.

777
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,678
Call the police, Vanessa.

778
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:35,020
Call the police.
Go on, pick that phone up.
I'll go to prison.

779
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,794
God knows I deserve it.

780
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,800
<i>Rachel.</i>
<i>I fucked up,</i>
<i>I know I did.</i>

781
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:48,230
But that didn't mean
anything to me.

782
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:51,570
And I know that
whatever mistakes we've made--

783
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:52,870
Mistake we've made?

784
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,571
Yes!
I don't care
what you did.

785
00:41:55,646 --> 00:42:00,140
<i>I just know that</i>
<i>we can work through this.</i>
<i>I don't wanna break up.</i>

786
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,952
That's it.
Time's up.

787
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,717
Don't be bloody ridiculous.
That wasn't a minute.
Piss off!

788
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,785
Please, Rachel.

789
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,556
I'll make it up.
I promise.

790
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,427
They weren't even
that attractive.

791
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,297
<i>Give me another chance.</i>

792
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,929
<i>(woman)</i>
<i>Go on, Rachel,</i>
<i>he's a good lad.</i>

793
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,870
Give him another chance.

794
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,033
Yeah, don't be tight-assed.

795
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,677
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Out you go.</i>

796
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,238
Come on.

797
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,917
Are you okay?

798
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,481
Not really.

799
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,062
You're doing
the right thing, Rachel.

800
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,722
Am I?

801
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:53,293
Look, just in case
you haven't worked it out
for yourself,

802
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,305
basically men are scum.

803
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,307
They can't see
beyond their own dicks,

804
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,673
which in the majority
of cases isn't very far.

805
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:05,579
The only time they appreciate
what they really had, is when
they'd already fucked it up.

806
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:09,085
They think women should be
these virginal creatures

807
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:13,715
that bring up their babies,
and serve them breakfast,
and wipe their noses,

808
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:18,490
and then suddenly transform
into these sexual objects
for their pleasure.

809
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,120
I like a good fuck
now and then,

810
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:23,530
but I'm not gonna be
some man's subservient
mother-whore fantasy.

811
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,069
Is this going
anywhere, Vanessa?

812
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,128
I'm just saying
that you're free now

813
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,970
to explore your options,
you know.

814
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,771
This is the 21st
century, Rachel.

815
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:37,280
You should be getting
out there shagging around
and having some fun.

816
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,316
That's not really me,
though, is it?

817
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,317
Isn't it?

818
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,216
Rachel, phone call.

819
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,388
Hello?

820
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,590
<i>(woman)</i>
<i>He'll be there in 20 minutes.</i>
<i>Are you gonna be okay?</i>

821
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,226
Sure.
Okay, thanks
for letting me know.

822
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,496
Bye.

823
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:05,135
Excuse me.
I ordered a green salad
about half an hour ago.

824
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:08,474
Mate, we've been sitting here
and we haven't ordered yet.

825
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:11,013
These chips
taste like feet.

826
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,912
If you wanted
to keep it a secret,

827
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:16,441
you did do a very good job
by leaving the condom wrapper
on the floor.

828
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,517
What in the bloody hell
are you two doing?

829
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,389
Am I literally the only
person doing any work?

830
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,984
What's going on?

831
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:28,828
There's chaos.
People are walking out.
Nobody's making any food.

832
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,026
All right.
Let's get things
back in order.

833
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:34,400
Vanessa, Dylan, you keep
the customers happy till
Tom and I sort this out.

834
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,597
All right,
let's get to work.

835
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,612
You do know this is
blackmail, don't you?

836
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,045
I wouldn't call it that.

837
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,241
It doesn't matter
what you call it.

838
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:50,275
But you don't seem to be
appreciating how fucked I'll
be if this thing comes out.

839
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,288
This is not the way
to deal with things.

840
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,846
You leave me no choice.

841
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,653
Don't be such a child!

842
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,752
You leave me no choice.
You leave me no choice!

843
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:03,027
I swear, if you say that again,
I will stab you in the head
with this knife.

844
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:08,829
Thank you.

845
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,464
Thanks.

846
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,600
Do you want anything
from the menu now?

847
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:16,009
No, thank you.
If you could just give us
a couple more minutes,

848
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,945
it would be lovely.

849
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,642
Thanks.

850
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,108
Hello, boys!

851
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,046
So, what's been going on?

852
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,220
Are they gonna take
our order in here or what?

853
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,435
Look, I'm sorry.
I just don't think
it's gonna work out.

854
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,732
What?

855
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,366
<i>There's just no</i>
<i>possibility of anything.</i>

856
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,637
<i>Why? I mean,</i>
<i>what's wrong?</i>

857
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:52,148
<i>Well, it's just everything.</i>
<i>The whole package.</i>

858
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,616
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I don't know what Sean</i>
<i>was thinking</i>

859
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,586
of getting us together
in the first place.

860
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,383
<i>I think I'm just gonna go.</i>

861
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:02,254
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>It's okay.</i>

862
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:07,025
I'll go. I mean,
this place isn't really
my cup of tea, anyway.

863
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,122
<i>I guess I'll...</i>
<i>see you then.</i>

864
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,791
Yeah, see you.

865
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:20,610
<i>So, John, did David</i>
<i>fill you in on all the wedding</i>
<i>details and everything?</i>

866
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,941
Yeah, pretty much.

867
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,675
Did you hear about these
bloody flower people?

868
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:27,114
Mm-hm.

869
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:32,383
Okay.
What the fuck's
going on here?

870
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,821
What do you mean?

871
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,860
Why are you two acting
like a couple
of dumb animals?

872
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,293
We've just been
sitting here talking.

873
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,058
About what?

874
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,395
<i>I've got some legal</i>
<i>stuff to deal with.</i>

875
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,900
What kind of legal stuff?

876
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,765
It's nothing
to worry about.

877
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:50,671
I'm a lawyer, too, John.
Do you think I can't offer
anything to the situation?

878
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:54,472
No, of course not.
But David has agreed
to help me out.

879
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,536
I haven't agreed
to anything.

880
00:46:56,613 --> 00:47:00,549
Don't you think you should,
given the circumstances?

881
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,552
What circumstances?

882
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,056
Right, that's it.
David, I want to know
what's going on,

883
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,422
<i>and I want to know now.</i>

884
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,688
I've got something
that I need to tell you.

885
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,061
Don't be a fool,
David.

886
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,690
What is it?

887
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,930
It's something that
I should've told you
a long time ago,

888
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,665
and I am so sorry
that I haven't.

889
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,606
For God sake,
just spit it out.

890
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,248
I sometimes wear your clothes
when you're out of the house.

891
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,613
What?

892
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,016
Actually he only wears
your underwear.

893
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:47,361
<i>(female voice)</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>This tea is cold.</i>

894
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:50,298
I did bring you that tea
about 20 minutes ago.

895
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,766
It was cold
when you brought it.

896
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:52,927
That's ridiculous.

897
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,595
Are you arguing with me?

898
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,607
You know what?
Why don't I just bring you
a new one?

899
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,372
Is this some kind
of sick joke?

900
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:03,435
No.

901
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,708
Are you gay?

902
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,044
No, I'm not gay.

903
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:09,449
Then what the fuck
is this?

904
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,009
<i>He's a transvestite.</i>

905
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,818
Will you shut up?
Don't you think
you've done enough?

906
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,290
You can't blame me
for this.

907
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,623
I kept that
secret for years.
I never told her.

908
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:20,959
You've known
about this for years,
and you never told me?

909
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,123
It's not my place.

910
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,190
So, what is this?

911
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:27,601
Some weird, perverted
fantasy game you play

912
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,902
where you both dress up
in my clothes and dance
around the house?

913
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,534
Hang on a minute.
I've got nothing
to do with him.

914
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,511
That's right.
John prefers wanking off
in front of girls.

915
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,672
That is a vicious lie.

916
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,443
What are you
talking about?

917
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:43,213
John hangs around and waits
for little girls and then
he gets his cock out.

918
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:47,053
It's not true.
My cock was already out
and the girl came along.

919
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,752
Shut up,
both of you!

920
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:54,728
Let me just get this
clear, David.

921
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:57,596
Basically, since we've
been living together,

922
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:02,401
you've been waiting for me
to go out so you can sneak
through my drawers

923
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:05,032
and prance around
in my bra and knickers?

924
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:10,603
I don't prance around at all.
I just put the stuff on.
There's no prancing involved.

925
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:14,777
So, what do you do?
Just sit around
in my clothes?

926
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:18,787
I just watch the telly
or do the ironing
or the vacuuming.

927
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,346
Vacuuming?

928
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:25,589
<i>And you,</i>
<i>you need special help.</i>
<i>You do know that, don't you?</i>

929
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:28,893
Look, don't you think
you should be a little
more focused on him?

930
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,158
<i>He's the one</i>
<i>you're about to marry.</i>

931
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,630
Angela?

932
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:41,006
Don't you think
you should've told me this
before we got engaged?

933
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:44,309
What the hell
are my parents gonna say?

934
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,576
Oh, you don't have
to tell your parents.

935
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,513
What is this thing?

936
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,249
<i>No, it's nothing.</i>
<i>It's nothing.</i>

937
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,688
What the--

938
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:02,990
Oh, you sick bastards.

939
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:08,402
<i>Angela, please, calm down.</i>
<i>Let's not blow this</i>
<i>out of proportion.</i>

940
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,996
Got the wedding
in a week.

941
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,203
Angela!
Angel--

942
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,914
Would you like
to order something
from the menu?

943
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:23,282
Look, will you just
please fuck off?

944
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,424
What's the matter
with you?

945
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,397
[voice cracking]
I asked a customer
what he wanted from the menu

946
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:36,454
and he told me to fuck off.

947
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,296
I've had enough.
I'm going home.

948
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,528
You can't go home.

949
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,434
I'm sorry.
I can't handle it anymore.

950
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,735
You have to stay.

951
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:47,800
Nobody else is doing any work.
I'm lumbered with everything
in my head.

952
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,869
You can sack me
if you like. I don't care.

953
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,072
I need you here!

954
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,706
You'll manage.

955
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,718
You don't understand.

956
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:01,618
I didn't wanna
tell you this.

957
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:05,252
I'm in line for a job.
The Marion.

958
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:08,695
And the owner's
coming here today
to check this place out.

959
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,897
You're leaving?

960
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:19,331
This job would be
huge for me, Tom.
And I'm so close.

961
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,308
I can't stay here forever.

962
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,508
When's he coming?

963
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,952
Any minute now.

964
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:36,525
Thank you, Tom.

965
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,558
I'm gonna go an check
if he hasn't arrived, yet.

966
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,797
<i>[whispering]</i>
<i>That's okay.</i>

967
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:56,974
You know, I was never
really sure about you
and Angela, anyway.

968
00:51:57,047 --> 00:52:00,881
Making it in the long run
with a marriage and everything.

969
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,182
But look
on the bright side.

970
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:07,781
Sure there are plenty
of women out that are
into that sort of thing.

971
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,386
Hello, again.

972
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,657
Oh, hello.

973
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:19,168
Look, I know we
didn't really hit off
all that well.

974
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:22,205
We both know
why we came here today,
don't we, eh?

975
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,500
Do we?

976
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:27,532
I'm a man,
and you're a woman.

977
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:31,513
And I reckon you probably get
a bit lonely at night,
don't you?

978
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:35,517
<i>You must be, what?</i>
<i>Thirty? Still single?</i>

979
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:36,882
I'm 27.

980
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:39,888
Exactly. Well,
near enough, anyway.

981
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:43,221
<i>What I'm trying to say</i>
<i>is, uh, if you want to,</i>

982
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,888
we could just go back
to my place and--

983
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:50,091
My God,
you're serious.

984
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,032
What's the worst
that can happen, eh?

985
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,865
I mean, you have a bit
of a crap shag.

986
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,564
You go home,
take a shower.

987
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,802
In a day or two
you would've forgot
all about it.

988
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,844
But then again,
you just might enjoy it.

989
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:05,109
I've never had
any complaints.

990
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,548
So, uh,
what do you think, then?

991
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,479
Thanks and everything.
Sounds like
a great opportunity,

992
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,957
but I think
I'm gonna give it a miss.

993
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,462
Really?
I mean, are you sure?

994
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,724
Yeah.

995
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,698
<i>Fair enough, then.</i>
<i>I mean--</i>

996
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,098
Bye.

997
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,497
Okay.

998
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,873
Mike, Laura's getting up.

999
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:49,254
<i>Didn't even notice me.</i>
<i>That's how insignificant</i>
<i>I am to her now.</i>

1000
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:52,090
Quickly, while she's gone.
Porn girl. Go.

1001
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,221
She's just broken up
with her boyfriend!

1002
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,891
Exactly, mate.
She's single.

1003
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,800
Plus, she's feeling
vulnerable, alone.

1004
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,803
Her self-esteem
is at a low ebb.

1005
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,862
I've never seen
anything so perfect.

1006
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:08,673
I'm more likely to stab myself
in the eye with this fork
than go over there.

1007
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,340
You want Laura to come
back and see you sitting here
like some sort of tern

1008
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,406
while she's out
on a hot date?

1009
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:19,251
Yeah, but think about it.
What if she saw you with that?

1010
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,952
She wouldn't think
you're so insignificant,
would she?

1011
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,361
No.

1012
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,525
<i>[Angela retching]</i>

1013
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:33,662
Are you okay?

1014
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:37,639
<i>[coughs]</i>
<i>Yeah, great.</i>

1015

<i>[flushes toilet]</i>

1016
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,581
Is there anything
I can do?

1017
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:55,023
Well, I just found out that
mi fianc likes to dress up
in my bra and knickers.

1018
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,651
What do you suggest?

1019
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,470
Oh, no, here she goes,
mate. That's that.

1020
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,405
<i>She's looking around</i>
<i>for the waiter.</i>

1021
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,808
<i>She's about to leave.</i>
<i>You've got to go now.</i>
<i>Do it!</i>

1022
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,107
I will.

1023
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,613
Good man.

1024
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,679
Go on, then.

1025
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,025
Come on, Michael,
you can do this.

1026
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,168
[clears throat]

1027
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,836
Hello.

1028
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,474
What are you reading?

1029
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:59,619
That's a good book.

1030
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,589
<i>Anna Kara--</i>

1031
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,286
<i>Karenina.</i>
Have you read it?

1032
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,158
No.

1033
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:11,756
I just-- me mates,
they all said
it's a good read.

1034
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,599
Do you mind if I sit down
just for a sec?

1035
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,036
Go on.

1036
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:21,838
I just want to sit

1037
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:25,039
to apologize
for what happened earlier.

1038
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:27,083
Your friend's an idiot.

1039
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,981
What sort of a person
does that?

1040
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:35,356
He's not my friend.
I feel sorry for him.

1041
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,723
[whispers]
He's got
learning difficulties.

1042
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:41,958
It's sad, but true.
I'm Mike.

1043
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,328
I'm Gloria.

1044
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,595
You cunt.

1045
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:48,068
You evil cunt!

1046
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,003
Pervert!

1047
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,041
This man is a deviant.

1048
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:56,135
<i>He gets sexual satisfaction</i>
<i>out of dressing up as a baby</i>
<i>and getting spanked!</i>

1049
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,772
Whoa, whoa!
I think you've made
a mistake.

1050
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,753
Okay, okay.
What the hell--

1051
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,583
What the hell
is going on here?

1052
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,589
My husband.
He's a sick man.

1053
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:10,490
He dresses up in a nappy
and pleads with me
to spank him.

1054
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,892
<i>He needs to be locked up.</i>

1055
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:17,592
I can assure you
that I've never seen this woman
before in my entire life.

1056
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,295
You know, look at her.
She is obviously a nutser.

1057
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,937
Surely, could you sit down?
And we can all talk about this
over a cup of tea.

1058
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,381
[shouting]
No, you don't understand!

1059
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,850
This man is a pervert!

1060
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,353
<i>He needs to be locked up!</i>

1061
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:41,584
<i>He's sick.</i>
<i>He's a sick man!</i>

1062
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,252
<i>You're crazy.</i>
<i>I'm gonna go</i>
<i>get your granddaughter.</i>

1063
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:45,794
Stay.

1064
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,369
What's going on?

1065
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:57,497
Vanessa's grandmother
tried to take out
one of our customers.

1066
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,542
Where is she?

1067
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:00,803
We put her outside.

1068
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:05,541
Outside? You can't
just put her outside.

1069
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,584
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>
<i>I'm the manager here</i>

1070
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:12,519
and I'd like to apologize
for the unfortunate incident
that just took place,

1071
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,648
and offer you all
coffee on the house.

1072
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,587
<i>Grandma!</i>

1073
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,062
You have to believe me.

1074
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:24,691
That woman
is a complete maniac.

1075
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,292
I don't know
what she's talking about.

1076
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,895
I mean, I've never
even been spanked.

1077
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:34,672
You know,
I certainly wouldn't--
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1078
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,075
It was an accident.

1079
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,613
I can--
I can help you with this.

1080
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,782
You might have to open
your legs a little bit.

1081
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,581
What the hell
is going on?

1082
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,884
He's some kind of pervert.
His wife was saying.

1083
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,254
Someone should call
the police.

1084
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:51,816
<i>She's not my wife,</i>
<i>for crying out loud.</i>

1085
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,193
She was insane!
Couldn't you see that?

1086
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,528
What the hell are you doing
with my girlfriend?

1087
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,562
I was just--
I was dabbing.

1088
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,503
Right.
You little fuck,
outside, now.

1089
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,267
Mark, just leave it.

1090
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,467
<i>You heard me.</i>
<i>Outside, now!</i>

1091
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,204
No, no.
You don't understand.

1092
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,179
You don't understand,
pussy!

1093
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,215
<i>You and me</i>
<i>are going outside.</i>

1094
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:16,252
You can either walk out,
or I can drag you out
by your hair.

1095
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,581
I've got cancer.

1096
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,054
What?

1097
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,787
I've got cancer.

1098
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:33,629
<i>So, you know,</i>
<i>back off.</i>

1099
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,174
[clears throat]

1100
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,555
He says he does the ironing.
Can you believe that?

1101
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:00,721
He puts on my underwear
and does housework.

1102
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,061
What am I supposed
to make of that?

1103
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:07,068
<i>Well, that doesn't</i>
<i>sound so bad.</i>
<i>At least he's clean.</i>

1104
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,433
Yeah, brilliant.

1105
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:11,905
My ex-fianc
is a filthy
disgusting slob.

1106
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:14,068
I'd have been happy for him
to wear gimp outfit

1107
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,008
if he'd do the washing up
once and a while.

1108
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,946
Really?
Why is he your ex?

1109
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:23,008
He couldn't handle
the whole commitment thing.
Thanks.

1110
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:26,055
We got engaged
because I practically
forced him into it.

1111
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,649
He used to wake up
in the middle of the night
having palpitations

1112
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,557
and nightmares
about castration.

1113
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,722
Eventually, we accepted
he just wasn't up to it.

1114
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:39,860
The thing is,
I was always trying
to change him.

1115
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:43,667
I guess I was trying
to mold him into what
I wanted him to be,

1116
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,506
instead of just accepting
him for who he was.

1117
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:51,946
Now I'm back to being
alone, having to go
on blind dates with idiots.

1118
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,643
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>you told him</i>
<i>you have cancer.</i>

1119
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,311
Where were you?
The guy was about
to rip my head off.

1120
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,016
What was I
supposed to do?

1121
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,456
To tell him you have cancer,
that's just sick.

1122
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,357
Do you think
I've cursed myself?

1123
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:08,955
Fucking freak.
I should sort him out now.

1124
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:11,432
Oh, just leave it,
Mark.

1125
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,600
Come on,
let's get out of here.

1126
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,702
I'm not coming.

1127
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:21,243
Don't start this shit now.

1128
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,278
I mean it.
I am not coming.

1129
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,940
I'm fed up
of this macho bullshit.

1130
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,643
The possessiveness,
the jealousy, the paranoia.

1131
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,151
What are you talking about?

1132
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:32,687
You've got a lot
of growing up to do.

1133
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,994
The fit ones
are always bastards,
aren't they?

1134
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,468
Yeah.

1135
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,038
They're just not worth it.

1136
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,636
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>Is Sam Harvey back?</i>

1137
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,145

<i>Yes, he is.</i>

1138
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,477
He's there.
Okay, thanks.
He's there.

1139
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,612
Fuck.

<i>(Sam)</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,686
Hey, Sam!
It's Dylan.

1142
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:06,744
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1143
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,848
Great. So?

1144
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,654
<i>Yeah, I spoke</i>
<i>to the publishers.</i>

1145
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,422
What did they think?

1146
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:17,523
<i>Well, they said they, uh--</i>
<i>Well, basically</i>
<i>they didn't get it.</i>

1147
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,493
Didn't get it?

1148
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,503
<i>Apparently not.</i>

1149
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,768
What do you mean
they didn't get it?
Are they retarded?

1150
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,435
<i>They said there</i>
<i>wasn't enough action.</i>

1151
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:31,310
Not enough action?
Sam, did you tell them
this is an existential novel?

1152
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,143
It's not supposed
to have action!

1153
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,615
<i>They didn't care.</i>

1154
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,811
You know, Sam,
do me a favor, okay?

1155
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:40,413
Call them back and tell them
I am going to get
my novel published.

1156
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:44,426
And furthermore, when people
are calling me The Voice
of the Next Generation

1157
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:47,691
and they come crawling back,
begging me on their hands
and knees

1158
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:52,133
<i>to publish my next novel,</i>
<i>I'll tell them they can kiss</i>
<i>my action-less ass!</i>

1159
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:55,364
<i>Calm down, dude.</i>
<i>I've got another call.</i>
<i>I'm gonna have to run.</i>

1160
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,430
<i>Will you call me back?</i>
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1161
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:02,876
They didn't get it.

1162
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,440
They didn't get it.

1163
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,180
I'm so sorry,
Dylan.

1164
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:18,927
Uh, what's going on?

1165
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:21,054
How can you two
be standing there?

1166
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,724
Perhaps someone
would actually like
to be cooking.

1167
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,200
We do have customers
that need to be fed.

1168
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,737
Dylan just got
some bad news.

1169
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,898
They're not gonna
publish his book.

1170
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:35,000
I see. It turns out
you know better than
the rest of us after all.

1171
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:37,739
Jesus, Tom!
A bit of sensitivity.

1172
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,476
What? He's been
strutting around
for the past six weeks

1173
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,279
like he's some sort
of prima donna.

1174
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:43,648
Why don't you shut
your face?

1175
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,516
Maybe you wanna shut it
for me.

1176
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:46,748
Maybe I will.

1177
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,882
Whoa, whoa.
This is all very exciting,

1178
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:52,485
be we still got a cafe to run
and a round of free coffees
to deliver.

1179
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,154
Come on.

1180
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,858
Fine. Here're
your new orders.

1181
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:00,664
You can add them to the backlog
and to the new customers
coming in for lunch.

1182
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:04,765
Shall I get Charlie?

1183
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,757
Do you want to do
some cooking?

1184
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,663
Yes, please.

1185
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,031
Come on.

1186
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:44,942
Hi.

1187
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,180
Tom said you might need
some help.

1188
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,776
It doesn't mean
I want anything
to do with you.

1189
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:03,595
Bloody hell.

1190
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,831
Jesus Christ!

1191
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:10,962
Let's get going.

1192
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:20,404
Don't we get any cake?
Can't have coffee
without cake!

1193
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:23,179
The coffee is free.
If you want cake,
order cake.

1194
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:26,688
I think if they're going
to give us coffee,
they ought to give us cake.

1195
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,849
<i>Who has coffee</i>
<i>without cake?</i>

1196
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:32,019
I don't know.
Skinny people!

1197
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:35,825
Look, no one ever said
anything about free cake.
The coffee is free.

1198
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:39,891
If you need cake,
then you can fucking
order some cake!

1199
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,199
If you don't like it,
you know what you can do.

1200
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,739
I demand to speak
to the manager.

1201
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:46,240
Nice one, Dylan.

1202
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,641
Fuck you!

1203
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:56,849
What are you doing in here?

1204
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,285
Actually, Rachel asked me
to come in, Vanessa.

1205
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,118
<i>Two more Greek salads.</i>

1206
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,488
That shouldn't be a problem
for you, Charlie.

1207
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:06,050
You can do both
at the same time.

1208
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:11,259
Hi. I'd like to report
a missing old lady.
Yeah, I'll hold.

1209
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:15,236
Charlie, did you ever
find out who that condom
belonged to?

1210
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,862
Yeah, I did, Tom.

1211
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,429
Really?

1212
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:24,108
It was Rachel and Dylan.

1213
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,579
Was it?

1214
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,138
<i>Come on.</i>

1215
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:33,015
There you go.

1216
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,319
Hey, man!

1217
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,690
That was quite a display
you put out over there, man.

1218
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:42,219
I just found out my novel
is not gonna get published.

1219
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,595
Hey, man,

1220
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,767
you mind if I play
a song, man?
Pass the hat?

1221
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,395
Is that cool?

1222
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,235
Knock yourself out.

1223
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,399
Excuse me.

1224
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,171
Not now.

1225
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,769
<i>(whiny customer)</i>
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>
<i>First I get a chicken salad</i>

1226
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,974
<i>that doesn't even look</i>
<i>like a chicken salad.</i>

1227
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,517
<i>Then they try</i>
<i>to serve us coffee</i>
<i>without any cake.</i>

1228
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:10,516
Hi. Yeah, I'd like to report
a missing person.

1229
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:15,253
Yes. Mm-hm.

1230
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:16,855
<i>Yes.</i>

1231
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:19,730
<i>(Rachel)</i>
<i>Yes. Yes!</i>

1232
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,862
<i>Oh, yes!</i>
<i>Yes, Dylan, yes!</i>

1233
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,839
<i>I never knew sex could be</i>
<i>so incredible.</i>

1234
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:26,932
Thank you.

1235
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,943
What are we gonna do
about Charlie?

1236
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:30,911
Who cares?

1237
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,881
<i>[both laugh]</i>

1238
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,609
To Charlie.

1239
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,983
<i>[laughing continues]</i>

1240
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,888
<i>(Vanessa)</i>
<i>Charlie, what the hell</i>
<i>are you doing?</i>

1241
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:44,392
Rachel!

1242
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,222
Mr. Davies!
How are you?
Welcome.

1243
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,320
Rachel!

1244
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:52,200
Sorry.

1245
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:55,066
Please, darling,
tell me it's not true.

1246
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:57,936
Did you fuck Dylan?!

1247
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,406
Did you?!

1248
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:02,171
What the hell are you talking?
Get back to the kitchen.

1249
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:06,374
Everybody, listen up.
This woman right here
is the most loving,

1250
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:10,852
most generous, most wonderful
person in the whole wide
bloody word,

1251
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,286
and until
very recently,

1252
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:16,620
I don't know why,
but she was my girlfriend,
and I screwed up, Rach.

1253
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:20,958
I royally fucking
screwed up! I'd never
had a threesome before

1254
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,692
<i>or anything like that.</i>

1255
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,495
But they were twins!

1256
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:28,366
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

1257
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:32,396
Bloody hell, Rach.
I've embarrassed myself
in front of all these people.

1258
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,501
I don't know what to do.
Do you want me
to get on my knees?

1259
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,979
<i>I'll get on my knees.</i>
<i>I'm getting</i>
<i>on my bloody knees.</i>

1260
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:40,743
Please, Rachel.

1261
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:44,377
That's it, get up.
Get back to the kitchen.
We'll talk about this later.

1262
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,920
I don't want.

1263
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:49,151
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt.
But under the circumstances

1264
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,956
I thought it'd be a good idea
to sing a little song.

1265
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:56,156
This is for all of you
lonely motherfuckers out there.

1266
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:01,193
# <i>I don't believe in Heaven</i> #

1267
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:06,838
# <i>I don't believe in God</i> #

1268
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,678
# My parents are dead #

1269
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,878
# I got no friends #

1270
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:20,987
# I don't even have a dog #

1271
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:29,593
Mr. Davies, why don't we get
a coffee in my office?

1272
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,429
And we can have a chat,
and I can show you--

1273
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,334
# There once was a time
I had a love #

1274
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:38,737
# <i>But I threw it all away</i> #

1275
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,801
# Now I sit here
All alone #

1276
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:44,812
# Just wasting away #

1277
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,839
# Like a rotting corpse #

1278
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:54,421
I guess the thing is
I just always thought
I'd find a man

1279
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:58,654
who was sweet,
and kind, and clever,
and hardworking,

1280
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:01,218
and happy in men's clothes.

1281
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:04,960
To be honest with you,
sounds to me like the worst
thing your fianc does

1282
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,060
is wear your underwear
and do the housework.

1283
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,002
You're doing
pretty bloody well.

1284
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,273
# When all is said and done #

1285
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:23,944
# <i>A six by two-foot box</i>
<i>To rot inside</i> #

1286
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:28,718
# Being eaten over decades
By maggots and worms #

1287
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:32,459
# I just want
To kill myself #

1288
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:35,497
# <i>Put a bullet in my eye</i> #

1289
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,233
# <i>I just wanna kill myself</i> #

1290
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:42,270
# <i>I just want to die</i> #

1291
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:46,370
# I just want to die #

1292
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,302
Thank you.

1293
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,448
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1294
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:57,985
Thank you very much.

1295
01:10:58,053 --> 01:10:59,850
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1296
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:05,024
Right.
Three rules.

1297
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:09,292
Number one.
I'm wearing
the wedding dress.

1298
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:13,267
Number two.
We're buying you
your own set of underwear.

1299
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:16,065
I'm not having you
stretching out
all my knickers.

1300
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:20,768
And number three.
If anyone ever finds out
about this,

1301
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,141
I'll kill you both.

1302
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:25,339
Come along, David.

1303
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:30,851
So, you're gonna get back to me
about the whole
alibi thing then?

1304
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:41,757
Damn!

1305
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,697
<i>Tom, that guy in the suit,</i>
<i>who was that?</i>

1306
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:47,031
That is the owner
of the Marion.

1307
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:48,797
The Marion?

1308
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:51,362
He's come to see Rachel
about a job there.

1309
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,044
Oh, shit.

1310
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:57,874
I made a mistake
breaking up with Laura.

1311
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:01,404
You'd rather got married
and never shag a bird again
the rest of your life?

1312
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,916
I'm not shagging anyone.

1313
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,782
There is potential there.

1314
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:07,947
<i>It's not good enough.</i>
<i>I'm sick of acting like</i>
<i>an overgrown teenager.</i>

1315
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:10,423
<i>I'm sick of you</i>
<i>telling me what to do</i>
<i>all the time,</i>

1316
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,426
like you've got
all the bloody answers.

1317
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,223
<i>You've never</i>
<i>had a girlfriend.</i>

1318
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:15,786
Easy, mate,
that's not true.

1319
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,492
Maybe not, but all you do
is smoking gear.

1320
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,330
Are you listening to me?

1321
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:22,495
Oh, my fucking Lord!

1322
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:23,868
[gunshot]

1323
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:27,170
Right.
Nobody move!

1324
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:29,107
Do you--
Excuse me for a moment.

1325
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:33,945
Come on, pigeon hat.
I'm taking you home
to deal with your problem.

1326
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,577
<i>I'm going to cure you!</i>
<i>Come on, up you get.</i>

1327
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:40,281
<i>Grandma.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Put the gun down.</i>

1328
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,189
[bang]

1329
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:47,388
Oh, bugger! Come on.
I've told you once!

1330
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:56,862
What have you done
to my grandmother?

1331
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:00,841
Sorry, mate.
You don't mind if I,
uh, tch, tch.

1332
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:02,843
<i>Grandma.</i>
<i>Grandma, wake up.</i>

1333
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:04,811
Should we call
the police?

1334
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,713
<i>She just blasted a hole</i>
<i>in a bloody fucking wall!</i>

1335
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:09,774
All right, everyone,
let's calm down.

1336
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:13,879
Hello, sir.
My name is Charlie.
I'm the chef here.

1337
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:15,287
What's going on?

1338
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:18,019
Nothing.
It's just an old lady
firing off a shotgun.

1339
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:23,998
I would love
to apologize for my, uh,
for my outburst earlier.

1340
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,864
Hello?
Can you hear me?

1341
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,764
You feeling okay?

1342
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:32,773
Could I get a cup of tea?

1343
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:37,972
It's not just the business.
You know, she is so fantastic
with people.

1344
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:41,743
And the staff,
she treats them
like her own family.

1345
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:44,183
<i>And the customers,</i>
<i>oh, my God,</i>
<i>love her.</i>

1346
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,483
<i>That's why they keep on</i>
<i>coming back for more.</i>

1347
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:49,718
I honestly truly think
that, uh,

1348
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:52,317
that she'll be
the best person
for this job.

1349
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:56,387
If you're all so fond of her,
why do you want me to give her
a job and take her away?

1350
01:13:56,465 --> 01:14:00,663
To be honest with you,
the last thing I want
in the whole wide world

1351
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:03,728
is for Rachel to leave.

1352
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:07,674
<i>But I know that she's always</i>
<i>wanted to work at The Marion,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

1353
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,702
And, uh, and me,
being as I am,

1354
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:15,375
completely and utterly
in love with her,

1355
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,715
<i>I guess I just want her</i>
<i>to be happy.</i>

1356
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:22,587
Hi.
That was just a little
old lady with a shotgun.

1357
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:25,218
No harm done.
So, how're we doing here?

1358
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,785
Good.

1359
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:30,225
Good bye.

1360
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:35,064
Interesting staff.

1361
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,996
Sorry about that.

1362
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,038
Danny.

1363
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:42,109
I have to tell you
something.

1364
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,038
What?

1365
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:49,516
When she fired the gun,
I shat my pants.

1366
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:52,418
Well, mate, so did I!
That shocking behavior--

1367
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,887
No, no.

1368
01:14:53,956 --> 01:15:00,361
I mean I actually
shat my pants.

1369
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:02,957
You did what?

1370
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:07,024
[whispering]
Shat my pants.

1371
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,995
<i>I've shat in my pants.</i>

1372
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:15,703
[whispering]
Danny, I'm full of shit
inside me pants.

1373
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:20,179
You did, didn't you?

1374
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,911
Fucking hell.
All right, yeah.
Let's, uh--

1375
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:25,351
We'll get you to the toilet.
Get you cleaned up.

1376
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,617
No toilets.
Just take me home.
Take me home, please.

1377
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,089
And I'll deal
with it there.

1378
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:32,251
So, up on three then.

1379
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:33,988
On three.

1380
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,428
One.
On three or after three?

1381
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:38,625
Make me stand on three.

1382
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,759
One.

1383
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:43,964
Two. Three.

1384
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:50,138
Thank you.

1385
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:56,578
Excuse me.
You've forgotten
your dead rat.

1386
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:57,710
Thank you.

1387
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,917
Do you know what?

1388
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:05,892
I'm not gay.
I just wanted to--

1389
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:07,189
Great.

1390
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,291
<i>Mike?</i>

1391
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,396
Laura?
Hey!

1392
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:17,665
What are you doing here?

1393
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,104
What the hell is going on?

1394
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:22,143
Just some crazy old woman
trying to take me
as hostage.

1395
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,440
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1396
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:26,447
Yeah, I'm fine.

1397
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:29,416
Now I'm done, eh?
Bit of a crick
in the neck, though.

1398
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,480
Can you just--

1399
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,484
Thank you.

1400
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:44,322
It's funny meeting you here,
actually, 'cause--

1401
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:50,599
well, I've, uh,
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

1402
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:53,163
<i>And I was just,</i>
<i>you know, I was thinking</i>

1403
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:56,108
that we still have stuff
to say to each other, right?

1404
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,505
What's that terrible smell?

1405
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:04,279
I don't know.
I should get moving.
But, um, I'll call you,

1406
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:07,151
<i>and we could go</i>
<i>for a coffee or a tea.</i>

1407
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:08,712
Whatever you fancy.

1408
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,655
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.

1409
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,318
Me, too.

1410
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:17,694
I'll, uh--
Oh, what do you do?

1411
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:20,530
I don't know!
Okay. All right.

1412
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:22,502
<i>Bye, then.</i>

1413
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:26,632
Right.
That's enough.
Let's go.

1414
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:29,609
I don't believe you told her
you'd call. If you hadn't
shat your pants,

1415
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:32,146
I'd give you such
a go at you right now.

1416
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:33,579
Well, I have.

1417
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,344
So shut the fuck up.

1418
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:46,458
God! I can't believe you
would whack an old woman
over the head.

1419
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:47,756
What is wrong with you?

1420
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,729
She was holding
a loaded shotgun!

1421
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:51,732
You're lucky
she didn't kill anybody.

1422
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,201
You shut up.
I can't take
you two bickering.

1423
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:56,794
The backlog of orders,

1424
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:59,932
and Rachel is in the office
having an interview
for another job.

1425
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,238
What do you mean
she's having an interview?

1426
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:05,536
Thanks for stepping by.

1427
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:07,775
Well, it's been my pleasure.

1428
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:10,676
Good bye.

1429
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,950
Hey.

1430
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:19,618
How did it go?

1431
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,095
He said that the fact
that I kept this place going

1432
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:26,225
considering the misfits
I had to deal with,
was almost unbelievable.

1433
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:28,967
He offered me the job.

1434
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:32,564
I don't know
what to do.

1435
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:33,869
You should take it.

1436
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,383
Did you get the job?

1437
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,185
And?

1438
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:00,262
I'm gonna take it.

1439
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:03,930
<i>That's great!</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1440
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:13,609
Tom.

1441
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:18,119
I'm sorry.
I just can't believe
you're leaving.

1442
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:21,815
You know I couldn't have gone
through today without you,
don't you?

1443
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:29,254
<i>And actually, I was wondering</i>
<i>if you'd take over this place</i>
<i>as manager.</i>

1444
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,462
Oh, God, Rachel.
I'd love to.

1445
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:00,327
Well, you turned out
to be quite the hero today.

1446
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:02,329
Didn't know
you had it in you.

1447
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:04,365
Neither did I.

1448
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,759
At least one of us
is getting out of here.

1449
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:12,329
You're gonna make it
one day, Dylan.
I've no doubt in my mind.

1450
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:15,035
You got to keep working
your ass off.

1451
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,681
I'm gonna miss you.

1452
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,611
I'm gonna miss you, too.

1453
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:27,279
<i>For what it's worth,</i>

1454
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,291
I think you should
forgive him.

1455
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:31,985
Really?

1456
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:36,622
Life's confusing, Rachel.
None of us really know
what we're doing.

1457
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:38,757
Especially him.

1458
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,270
<i>But he loves you.</i>

1459
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,202
You shouldn't take that
for granted.

1460
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:12,992
That was nice.

1461
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:15,195
What you said
to Mr. Davies.

1462
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,470
I meant it.

1463
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,100
Charlie!

1464
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:25,239
I know I fucked up,
didn't I?

1465
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:26,507
Yeah.

1466
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:33,219
Just so you know,
by the way, I don't
blame you or Dylan.

1467
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:36,052
You must've been
really angry and--

1468
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:38,319
a difficult proposition
to resist.

1469
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,486
What are you
talking about?

1470
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,427
The condom wrapper.

1471
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:46,593
Charlie, I didn't
have sex with Dylan.
What do you think I am?

1472
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:48,329
What?

1473
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:49,927
Who's was it, then?

1474
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:53,634
I don't know. You're
the one with the rampant
sexual appetite.

1475
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:58,240
So, was it worth it?

1476
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,315
The threesome?

1477
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:06,946
Nothing, nothing
was worth risking
what I have with you,

1478
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,850
<i>because you are</i>
<i>everything to me.</i>

1479
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:14,157
<i>And to think</i>
<i>that I fucked that up</i>

1480
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:18,256
because of some dirty
cheap thrill

1481
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:21,427
<i>makes me feel</i>
<i>like the biggest twat</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

1482
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:22,970
You are what you are.

1483
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,835
<i>I know.</i>

1484
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,707
Just give me
one thing, darling.

1485
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:34,071
<i>Just tell me this</i>
<i>is not definitely over.</i>

1486
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:35,980
I'm not asking
to move back in.

1487
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:39,384
But please tell me
that it's definitely
not the end.

1488
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,819
[whispers]
Hey.

1489
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:51,822
[whispers]
'Cause I love you.

1490
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,067
I'll think about it.

1491
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,538
[whispers]
Fine.

1492
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:04,978
I've got to get back.

1493
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:21,526
So, it actually happened
with you and Rachel.

1494
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,291
What are you
talking about?

1495
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,663
Everyone keeps saying,
"Dylan and Rachel."

1496
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:28,134
I just wanna know
if there's something
going on.

1497
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:31,001
Are you the most irritating
person in the world?

1498
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:34,667
It was us, you idiot.
The condom was ours.

1499
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,172
I know.
I just--

1500
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:40,771
thought there might have been
some truth to it.

1501
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:43,113
Well, there wasn't, okay?

1502
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:45,686
Sorry.

1503
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:48,382
I'm used to it.

1504
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:51,425
<i>All right.</i>
<i>I'm off to take Granny</i>
<i>back to the home.</i>

1505
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:54,428
Make sure you bring her
back again soon.
She's an angel.

1506
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,430
Yeah, yeah.
Very funny.

1507
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:57,863
See you tomorrow.

1508
01:23:57,932 --> 01:23:59,695
See you.

1509
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:05,968
God, what a day.

1510
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,305
I can't believe
I'm gonna be the new boss.

1511
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:11,504
Well, just remember
who's the boss
in the bedroom.

1512
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:16,376
<i>[smack]</i>

1513
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:27,028
Thank you for a lovely
afternoon, dear.

1514
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,619
Of course.

1515
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:50,483
(whole cast)
# After you've gone
And left me crying #

1516
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:54,352
# After you've gone,
There's no denying #

1517
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:58,085
# You'll feel blue,
You're gonna be sad #

1518
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:02,459
# You've missed the bestest pal
You ever had #

1519
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,863
# There'll come a time,
Now, don't forget it #

1520
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:09,836
# There'll come a time,
That you'll regret it #

1521
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:13,931
# Someday you'll know
What you're doing #

1522
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:17,705
# You know my love for you
Will drive me to ruin #

1523
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,679
# After you've gone #
# Go away #

1524
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:22,682
# After you've gone away #

1525
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:26,777
# Away #
# Away #

1526
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:29,221
# Away #
