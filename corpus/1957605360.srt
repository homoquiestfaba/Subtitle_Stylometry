00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,041
[man 1] Gunther, Bola,

5
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,666
thank you for joining us
here in our bubble.

6
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,166
As the producer on this movie,
here's what I expect from you.

7
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,041
- Actors are animals.
- [woman scoffs]

8
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:14,041
You are animal handlers.

9
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:18,708
Sometimes, they wanna play with you.
Sometimes, they'll rip your balls off.

10
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,500
Don't listen
to anything they say. They're liars.

11
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,875
They literally lie for a living.
That's their literal job, yeah?

12
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,500
Don't party with them.

13
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,666
Don't tire them out.

14
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,250
Don't fuck them.

15
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,333
I won't.

16
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,791
Always tell them
they're fantastic in the movie.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,125
They're very insecure people.
They need constant praise.

18
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,875
Make them feel good.
Don't tire them out. Don't fuck them.

19
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:45,875
Don't fuck them.

20
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,226
- [man 1] That's it.
- That's it.

21
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,708
Any questions?

22
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,708
Um... Yeah, like,
what if we become proper friends?

23
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,958
- You won't.
- [man 2] No?

24
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:53,958
No.

25
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,458
What if they confide in you

26
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,333
and tell you something
they've not told anybody else?

27
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,125
Call me, tell me what they said.

28
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,125
- What if they say, "Don't tell Gavin"?
- [Gavin] No!

29
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,166
- No.
- This is the bubble.

30
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,750
The sanctuary!

31
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,875
It's the only place they're safe!
That's why you're not wearing masks.

32
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,041
Don't you get it?

33
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,708
- [woman] Hi!
- Hey! [laughs]

34
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,166
- [woman laughing] How are you?
- So good to see you!

35
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,458
- Uh...
- Oh...

36
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,017
- Well, imagine...
- [woman] Okay, yes.

37
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,500
- Fake hug.
- [man] Oh, wow. You look fantastic!

38
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:27,041
[woman] Thanks. Been exercising a lot.
It's the only thing keeping me sane.

39
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,041
Well, you look sane and gorgeous, and, uh...

40
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:34,083
- What do you think about <i>Cliff Beasts 6?</i>
- I can't leave my boyfriend right now.

41
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,875
He is very neurotic, and this whole time
is just very triggering for him.

42
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,041
Huh. Okay. What if you brought him?

43
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,291
- He won't travel.
- Because of the pandemic?

44
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,125
No, he just won't fly.
He also refuses to get a job.

45
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:49,708
I have a lot of clients working in bubbles
right now, and they're having a blast.

46
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,958
It won't be comfortable working with them.

47
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:56,666
They hate me for not doing <i>Cliff Beasts 5.</i>
I can't bubble with them for three months.

48
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,166
I'm gonna level with you.

49
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,333
You need a rebound
after your last film, <i>Jerusalem Rising.</i>

50
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,666
- Mm-hmm.
- You saw the reviews.

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,791
- I never read my reviews.
- Hang on a sec.

52
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,250
- Can you not read those?
- Just listen, okay?

53
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,666
<i>"Jerusalem Rising</i> manages
to offend both Palestinians and Jews."

54
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,500
That's one review.
And it was the script. It wasn't my fault.

55
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,083
When <i>Cats</i> bombed,
they didn't blame Andrew Lloyd Webber.

56
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,500
They just said, "Judi Dench fucked <i>Cats."</i>

57
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,708
Okay, but you were the one who told me

58
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:26,541
I could play half-Israeli
and half-Palestinian when I'm neither.

59
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,958
[in ambiguous accent] I know you've
been fighting for thousands of years,

60
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:34,583
but tonight,
we must join forces to fight the aliens.

61
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,125
[in normal accent] Is my career dead?

62
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,416
Not if you make this movie.

63
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:44,875
And it's safe?

64
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,916
The safest place
in the world right now is a film set.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,583
The script is actually good?

66
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,166
It made me cry.

67
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,041
[instrumental music playing on speakers]

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,625
Oh, you're making the face
like you're gonna say yes.

69
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,333
Oh, my God, Josh is gonna have
a full nervous breakdown.

70
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,291
I can do this, right?

71
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,041
I'll keep my head down,
not get pulled into the drama,

72
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,750
and just do my job and get out.

73
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,916
All right. Okay, let's do it.
Yeah, put me in the bubble.

- [Carol] Hi!
- [man 2] <i>Carol. What's up, movie star?</i>

77
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,625
This is so crazy.
You sure you're gonna be okay?

78
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:35,166
<i>Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm just
worried about catching the virus, but...</i>

79
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,125
Well, just call me regularly.

80
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:41,000
<i>Actually, I just heard that veterinarians
are gonna start treating people,</i>

81
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,750
<i>so that'll help.</i>

82
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,791
Yeah, and it's only three months.
Three months! We can do this!

83
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,416
Oh, wait! Somebody wants to say hi!

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,416
Okay.

85
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,041
Look who it is!

86
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,916
I miss you so much, Mommy.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,750
Aw. I'm not your mommy yet, Leila,

88
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,541
but I will be
your stepmom one day. It'll be the best!

89
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,250
- Daddy said you left us for dead.
- Oh, what?

90
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,500
- [laughs] Don't forget about us! Bye!
- Bye!

Oh. Shall we? [chuckles]
Welcome to Clifton House.

- [Pippa] I know, right?

94
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:26,833
- Carol, we're so excited you're here!
- [Carol] I'm so excited to get started!

95
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,125
- [Gavin] Wow! You look great.
- [Carol] Oh, thank you.

96
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,291
- Now, you just have to do a COVID test.
- [Carol] Okay.

97
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,809
- [Gunther] I'm such a big fan.
- [Carol] Thank you. [chuckles]

98
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,833
[Gunther] And in your nose. Okay.

99
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,625
- [Carol] Mm.
- [Gunther] Ready? One hundred.

100
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,125
Ninety-nine.

101
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,333
- Ninety-eight.
- Uh...

102
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,500
- I'm only joking.
- Oh!

103
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,541
- [chuckling] Oh, my God! You're the worst!
- [Gunther] See you in a bit. Bye, friend.

104
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,958
[Carol] Bye. Whoo! Yeah.

105
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,458
Um, so how does the quarantining work?

106
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,125
It's a quick 14 days. We pamper you.

107
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,333
Wait till you see
what we've done to your room.

108
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,916
- [Pippa] You have the best room by far.
- [Carol] I love that.

109

- Ah! Bola!
- [Bola] Hello.

110
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:06,625
This is Bola, our wellness specialist.
Bola, how would you describe yourself?

111
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:11,500
Uh, well, due to safety, we don't have
a lot of staff, so I get to do everything.

112
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,500
Which means if you need
a personal trainer, Bola.

113
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,541
If you need a yoga teacher, Bola.

114
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:20,041
If you need a ping-pong opponent, Bola.
If you need a masseuse?

- [Carol] Bola!
- [Bola] That's it, baby girl.

[man] We allowed to smoke weed
in the room? I forgot to bring my edibles.

117
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,375
[Carol] Oh, my God! Howie, how are you?

118
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,583
- [Howie] Carol, come here, my love!
- [man 1] Stop! That's it. Stop it!

119
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,083
- [man 2] Off you go.
- [Howie] What the fuck is going on?

120
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,666
- Brother, help me!
- [Carol] Howie?

121

129

00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,791
- You did?
- Yeah.

167
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,708
Sorry. Had to get that off my chest.

168
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,416
Yeah, give it to me. [chuckles]

169
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,583
And I really liked you
in <i>Jerusalem Rising.</i>

170
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,666
- [woman] Yeah.
- Really?

171
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,000
That means so much coming from you.

172
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:51,291
And I think that all of the critics
around the world are wrong.

173
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,916
Oh, not everyone.

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,791
Four percent on Rotten Tomatoes. [scoffs]

175
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,625
It doesn't really go lower.

176
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,750
So I need cool, documentary-style footage.

177
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:06,125
If the actors ask for air, give them air,
but then strike and get what we need.

178
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,083
I want you to be a fly on the wall,

179
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,458
but also up their arse.

180
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,166
- Now, fuck off, Lee.
- My name is Scott, actually.

181
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,458
- I don't care.
- Okay.

182
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,333
You a big <i>Cliff Beasts</i> fan?

183
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,958
No, but I saw the trailer
for the second one. It was so cool!

184
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,375
- Oh.
- [Scott] Hey!

185
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,750
Hi, y'all!

186
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,166
Excited for <i>Cliff Beasts?</i>

187
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,041
[whispers] Is this the movie?

188
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,333
[Scott hesitates] What?

189
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,083
Are we shooting right now?

190
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,583
No, it's just behind-the-scenes stuff.

191
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,875
Just say, like, a sentence
about why you're excited?

192
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,666
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to talk
to my mom if you wanna talk to me.

193
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,666
Oh, all right.

194
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,791
- It's nice meeting you.
- Okay, you too.

195
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,750
- [woman] Dieter! Hi!
- Hi.

196
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,708
Lauren. Um...

197
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:56,541
I just wanted to tell you
how incredible you were in <i>Hunger Strike.</i>

198
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,875
Your performance was...

199
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,541
I mean, I think about it all the time.
Just fearless and a total triumph.

200
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,916
Um... Congratulations.

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,375
I don't watch my own shit.
Never watch your own shit.

202
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,791
You just wipe, you flush, and you move on.

203
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:15,041
Right. Well, anyway, I just wanted to
let you know that it really stuck with me,

204
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,625
and it was very powerful. Just...

205
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,041
Yeah. Where's your husband?

206
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,916
My husband? We got divorced.

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Of course.

208
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,333
Mm-hmm. Uh...

209
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,416
[Dieter] I'm sorry.

210
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,333
No worries. It's... We're fine.

211
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,083
We are, uh... totally fine.

212
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:36,416
We have gone through a lot,
and we are coming out on the other side.

213
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,333
Right.

214
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,416
Our main priority is our 16-year-old son,

215
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,000
who we just adopted
right before the divorce.

216
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,166
Listen, I'm sorry,
I'm trying to care, but it's hard.

217
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,166
Gunther, I like you.

218
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,458
Really? I like you too.
I think you're... Okay, 'cause...

219
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,541
That feels amazing,

220
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,041
'cause we got told we weren't allowed
to be friends with the cast.

221
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,666
Who said that?

222
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,500
I don't wanna be a person that's like,
"It was Gavin," but, yeah.

223
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,125
Know how I feel about that?

224
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,791
- Fuck you, Gavin!
- Do you?

225
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,125
Suck your mum, Gavin!
Say it from your chest.

226
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,208
What? [mumbles] Fuck you, Gavin!

227
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,750
I need to be real with you.
I don't understand these bullshit rules.

228
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,625
Been in my room two weeks.
I ain't had human contact.

229
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,875
It's important
for my mental and physical health

230
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,708
to have human contact with friends.

231
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,208
- We're friends!
- Completely.

232
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,333
- What will happen if I touch you? Huh?
- We could die.

233
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,583
Yeah, completely.
It's kind of the situation.

234
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,666
- Yeah.
- Boop!

235
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,333
- Um...
- Did we die? Are you dead?

236
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,958
You've just got to understand
that my job, as a health officer,

237
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:39,083
is to make sure that everything
that we're doing is as safe as possible.

238
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,416
All the best, Gunther.

239
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
["You're Pouring Water
On a Drowning Man" playing]

240
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,333
- Um, my dad does stunts.
- Hi.

241
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,666
Um, I'm lonely, and I'm in hell here,

242
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,791
and I would like
to form an alliance with you.

243
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,833
[hesitates] Okay, yeah, sure.

244
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,833
All right, okay.

245
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,375
It was hard
doing the last one without you.

246
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,708
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.
I got really bad advice from my reps

247
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,125
and was also having some,
ahem, emotional issues.

248
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,541
That's where you were on your journey,
and it brought you right back here.

249
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,291
- [Carol] Exactly.
- It's all good.

250
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:17,333
- I heard you were starting a religion.
- No, it's a... [chuckles nervously]

251
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,666
It's a lifestyle brand
slash motivational system

252
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,000
called Harmony Ignite.

253
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,541
Wow. And you wrote a whole Bible.

254
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,458
Well, I wrote a book.
A book called <i>Harmony Ignited.</i>

255
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,791
And, uh, it's just a collection
of my thoughts and musings

256
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,791
and some sayings and wisdom and proverbs.
That's it, yeah.

257
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:38,125
It's not a religion, per se.
You can leave anytime that you want to.

258
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,250
- It's not, like, a cult.
- No, it's definitely not a cult.

259
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,166
I mean, who defines what a cult is?

260
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,541
- Yeah.
- Okay.

261
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:48,500
You know what? I'm gonna be
really straightforward with you right now

262
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:53,041
and let you know that we are
co-parents to Raphael, and that is it.

263
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,000
That's true.

264
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:59,166
So what happened on parts one
and three and four is not happening again.

265
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,333
What about what we did on part two?

266
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,791
You have no respect for me.

267
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,875
I have nothing but respect for you.

268
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,291
Stop.

269
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,500
Stop.

270
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,041
- Stop it.
- Stop.

271
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,083
I would appreciate
if you didn't look at me like that.

272
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,333
- Where should I look?
- I can't look at you.

273
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,541
- I'm still here though.
- [sighs]

274
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,791
I know you.

275
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:24,916
- God. Hi.
- [laughs]

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,625
- How are you doing? Sorry to scare you.
- Don't worry.

277
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,916
I am so excited that you are here.

278
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,125
Oh, yeah. No, I'm so excited.

279
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,208
Gotta tell you, I love the TikTok stuff.

280
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,041
You are crushing it.
Absolutely crushing it.

281
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,666
I mean, clearly. 120 million followers.
You are unbelievable.

282
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,083
I love the one where you
and your cat lip-synch to <i>Harry Potter.</i>

283
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,125
I can't believe you've seen all that.

284
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,625
[laughs] It's fantastic!

285
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,958
Hey, maybe you and I can do
one together while we're here.

286
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,541
- Oh, yeah, maybe.
- Yeah.

287
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,916
- What's your name?
- Carla.

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,666
Nice to meet you.
You got great energy about you.

289
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Gavs!

290
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,791
Who is that?

291
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,791
One of the actors.
He's not that good though.

292
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,375
- [piano music playing]
- May I refresh your water?

293
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,458
Yeah, please.

294
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,833
Thanks.

295
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,166
Why you look at me
with weird eyes? [chuckles]

296
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,166
[Dieter sighs]

297
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,541
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Wow.

298
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,375
- [man] Hey!
- [woman] Hey!

299
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,125
- [Gavin] Okay.
- Hit us with it, Gav.

300
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:34,416
Welcome! I'm gonna introduce
somebody now who is...

301
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,708
He's special.

302
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,333
He's funny.

303
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,625
He's extremely intelligent.

304
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,833
And he's a...

305
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,583
He's a visionary.

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,916
He shot a brilliant movie called
<i>Tiles of Love</i>

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,875
while working at Home Depot.

308
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:59,750
- Our director... Darren Eigen!
- [cheering]

309
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,541
- [whistling] Whoo!
- Thank you! Thanks, you guys. Uh...

310
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,916
I just wanna say

311
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,166
I am so lucky to be able
to work with a cast this talented.

312
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,875
This is your car,

313
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,041
and I'm gonna step in and take the wheel.

314
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,666
This drive is gonna be a little crazy.

315
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,541
Gonna head towards the railing
a couple of times. Might hit it.

316
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,375
Some of you might not even survive.

317
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,083
But I've got the end of the road
in my sight.

318
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,750
Might be a crazy ride,

319
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,625
but it's gonna look great,

320
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,541
and it's gonna
make the world forget all their problems.

321
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,166
So,

322
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,833
let's go for a ride.

323
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,458
We're fucked.

325
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,958
Are you sure it's safe?

326
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,750
Just don't put your hands
too close to your face.

327
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,666
- [squawking]
- [nervously] Oh, shit. Aah!

328
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,416
No! No! No!

329
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,666
- [Darren] Grab. Nice. Right arm. Block.
- [grunting]

330
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,291
Move around. Good. Let me hear the rage.
Aah. Spins around, kick. Great.

So the thing
about Harmony Ignite is it's about dreams.

384
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,625
It's about
how you go about fulfilling your dreams.

385
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,333
I'm not really looking for a new religion.

386
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,458
I'm Hindu. Many gods, very busy.

387
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,708
- I have a question for you, man.
- Mm-hmm.

388

- What's your dream?
- My dream?

389
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,750
Your dream. I wanna hear it.

This won't be the last pandemic.
We all know that.

391

- Absolutely.
- We still need to have sex.

392
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,666
My brother, a software engineer in India,
has invented a glove.

393
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,291
It's like a hand
that you can wrap around you

394
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,833
or put inside you, anally.

395
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,250
Then somewhere, in a different city,
somebody else has the hand,

396
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:55,041
and then they do things to the hand
that you feel on you or inside you.

397
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:59,000
You're safe. It's sanitary ecstasy.
You'll be wearing virtual reality goggles,

anywhere in the world with anyone.

When?

413
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,583
When I get to know you,
because I like you.

414
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,500
- Great.
- Then I would like you to meet my father.

415
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,375
And if you get his permission,
you will sign a lifelong agreement

416
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,166

417

Yeah, let's talk about zones for a moment.
Uh, there are three main ones, okay?

421
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,166
There's Red Zone. That's the best zone.
That's the actors, okay?

422
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,791
Then there's Blue Zone. That's for crew.

423
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:12,083
Then there's Yellow Zone for office staff.
We don't need to worry about that.

424

Um, a lot of you
have been asking about flirting.

425
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,500
Yes, it happens. Um, physical touch is,
of course, off the table.

426
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:22,333
Um, so what I would recommend
is making sweet eyes at each other.

what that looks like, that'd be...

[man 2] It's not a creature.

What we hear from the locals,
we may be dealing with a cliff beast.

Climate change has melted
the whole top of the mountain.

It's a burnt wasteland.

And wo-man.

450
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,333
One thing I've learned growing up
in the mossy savannas of Alabama

451
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,416
is if you've seen one June bug,

They're cliff beasts. It's in their DNA.
That's what they do. They fly.

You're not the writer.

We have a writer. Aren't you an actor?

we're going to shut down production

Yeah, production were trying to be safe
by sending one person to get the coffees,

542
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:43,583
when in fact that led to Wendy touching
about 80 coffee cups this morning.

Second time, was in a coma.

Well, it would be a lot of pressure
if the cast wasn't so brilliant.

667
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,708
See you later, buddy.

668
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,541
Are you worried people
won't watch a movie about dinosaurs,

669
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,000
given the serious nature
of the global pandemic?

670
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,333
Hey, are you being a fly on the wall?

671
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,125
You're a pretty noisy fucking fly!
I can hardly hear the helicopter!

672
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,583
Sorry, just doing my job.

673
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:39,125
What job is that?
Trying to get in my fucking head?

674
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,000
Like he wants me to fail!

675
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:44,791
Don't let him mess with your focus.
Everybody wants you to fail.

676
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,833
Don't give a fuck about him.

677
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:48,208
What?

678
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:56,625
- Where's Ronjon?
- You asked for a tray table to be removed.

679
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,958
I said send Ronjon.

680
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,625
You wanted sex, but you will get love.

681
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Hold on.

682
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,041
[slow instrumental music playing]

683
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,500
Isn't that nice?

684
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:20,916
You don't know me!

685
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:24,458
[playing a pleasant tune]

686
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:28,208
Am I a great director?

687
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:31,208
Yes, of course you are.

688
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:32,791
You have a vision.

689
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,583
- Yeah, I think I do.
- Yeah.

690
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:38,083
So what do I do when Dustin
keeps trying to rewrite the script?

691
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:42,958
When he tells you his ideas,
tell him you'll think about them,

692
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,125
and then never get back to him.

693
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,625
You do that to me.

694
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,750
No, with you, I'm actually thinking.

695
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,041
[laughing]

696
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,166
I'm just playing around.

697
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,666
Making movies is fun!

698
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:59,291
That's why we do it!

699
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:03,958
I'm sorry I skipped your mom's funeral
to go to the People's Choice Awards.

700
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,875
I'm sorry that I

701
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,833
burned down your back office.

702
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:12,041
I'm sorry I slept with your agent.

703
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,500
- Sorry that...
- And your manager.

704
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:18,541
And your divorce lawyer.

705
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,833
- Yeah.
- Uh...

706
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,083
I'm sorry I gave up on us.

707
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,875
[sighs] Why is it always so hard?

708
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:31,708
[sighs] I think 'cause you're so strong.
You're so intimidating. So talented.

709
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,125
Hmm.

710
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:37,000
I feel like nobody would be able
to fix the script the way you do

711
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:42,416
and stay in such incredible shape.

712
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,541
And you

713
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,125
are an amazing mother.

714
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:48,625
- [whimsical music playing]
- [gasps softly]

715
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:52,000
- Take me to the peak!
- We are on a mountain!

716
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:55,125
[Lauren] Mount Everest! [laughing]

717
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,916
- Ooh. I think I see one of the crew.
- Oh, shit. Get...

718
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:03,458
<i>Uh, so how
is the major motion picture going?</i>

719
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,125
It's fine. Everybody's just old.

720
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,916
<i>Is there somebody cute there?</i>

721
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,250
- [chuckling]
<i>- Who you maybe wanna smooch with?</i>

722
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,791
Don't be gross, Mom! God!

723
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:17,458
<i>Is Timmy-thee Oilyphant there? Oh.</i>

724
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,250
- No!
<i>- I could...</i>

725
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,333
Why are you saying it like that?
That's not his name!

726
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:25,250
But I wish he was here.
I do. He's very cute.

727
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:29,083
<i>Oh. Are you nervous
to meet the dinosaurs during your act?</i>

728
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,208
Mom, they're not real!

729
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,666
They, like... They put them in after.

730
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,875
<i>I thought there was an elephant
wearing a mask or something.</i>

731
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,208
I wish you were here. I'm so lonely.

732
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,291
<i>Aww!</i> [squealing]

733
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,166
[chuckles]

734
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,708
[thudding overhead]

735
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,666
- [chandelier tinkling]
- [moans softly]

736
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:52,875
[heavy thud]

737
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,166
[sighs]

738
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,666
Come on! [huffs]

739
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:02,416
[whimsical music playing]

740
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,916
[thudding continues]

741
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,625
- Oh! Jesus! [grunts]
- You okay?

742
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,125
- I'm fine!
- Let me check.

743
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,041
- Hey, whoa, social distancing.
- Sorry.

744
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,666
Why are you kicking balls around?

745
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,041
Uh, I'm with my squad.
We're just bubbling before the big game.

746
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,458
- A game? What kind of a game?
- Football.

747
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,833
Soccer. I play for Betis.

748
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,541
Oh. I didn't realize
anybody else was in this hotel.

749
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,625
Well, we are.

750
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:39,666
Well, I'm bubbling too. I'm an actress,
and we're making a movie.

751
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:42,041
I know you.

752
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,666
<i>Cliff Beasts.</i>

753
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,416
Dr. Lacie.

754
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,041
Yes, that's me, Dr. Lacie.

755
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,541
You're in <i>Jerusalem Rising</i> too, right?

756
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,750
- Yes.
- I have to ask.

757
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:55,375
Are you half-Palestinian, half-Israeli?

758
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,208
Actually, I'm not either.

759
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,125
Great acting.

760
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:02,291
Ah! That's so good to hear.
So many people got mad at me.

761
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:06,125
Everyone was offended. I was like,
"I'm just trying to create a piece of art

762
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,666
that might help solve the issues."

763
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,750
Peace.

764
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:15,458
Well, Lacie, would you like to, uh, go to
my room right now and just talk for a bit?

765
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,958
- I'd like to talk.
- Yeah, me too.

766
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:21,458
I feel like I haven't talked
in a very long time.

767
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:24,125
I'm a lot of fun to talk to.

768
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,375
I've just been talking to myself lately.

769
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:30,875
If I don't talk to you,
I think I'm going to explode.

770
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:33,500
But I don't think
we're allowed to cross bubbles.

771
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:35,791
No, we wouldn't be crossing bubbles.

772
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,083
We'd be making a new bubble.

773
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,041
Then we're just inside
each other's bubbles.

774
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,500
[exhales]

775
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,750
No. No, no, no. No, we can't.
Stop it. Stop it.

776
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,000
Goodbye, Dr. Lacie.

777
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,875
[meditation music playing]

778
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:57,791
- [Bola] Hello, friends. Good morning.
- [exhales]

779
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:01,416
Thank you all
for joining our morning meditation.

780
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:07,625
This is our opportunity to breathe,
let go of our troubles, and recharge.

781
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:08,750
Yeah.

782
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,250
[Bola] I want you to close your eyes.

783
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:15,041
- Let the air fill your lungs...
- [inhales]

784
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:21,041
...and release the fear
of catching the virus.

785
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:25,541
And release the fear
of the movie industry collapsing,

786
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,416
leaving all of you penniless.

787
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,625
Why you saying that?

788
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:33,166
Breathe in, and breathe out that fear

789
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,166
that the world is soon going to realize

790
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,166
you people are not that special.

791
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:41,583
One might say useless.

792
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,125
- Excuse me, Bola.
- [Bola] Yeah?

793
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:46,208
I can't take this.
I can't take this shit no more, please.

794
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,666
Don't judge your thoughts. Observe them!

795
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,041
I can't observe them. This is more
than I can take. Yeah, I'm in pain.

796
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:56,208
And I'm bored.
Bored as fuck in this hotel!

797
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,125
I need out of the hotel right now!

798
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,833
Howie, let me tell you
about Harmony Ignite.

799
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:01,958
Sean, do us a favor?

800
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,375
- Yeah.
- Harmony Ignite your asshole!

801
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:05,916
- Howie!
- Howie, easy!

802
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:09,083
You can't leave.
You're the comic relief of the movie.

803
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,791
Fuck you, you fucker!
How's that for witty comic relief? Huh?

804
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:12,708
[Sean] Howie.

805
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,458
I don't even know why you're complaining.
It's not that bad being here.

806
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:19,708
Why you talking to me?
Your dances pave the way to the hellfire.

807
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:21,267
- [Dustin] Howie.
- [Carol] Oh, my God.

808
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:24,416
Emotions are like a wave.
You just gotta ride 'em.

809
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,958
- Like a wave?
- Let it pass.

810
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,416
- Let me show you a wave.
- Oh, my God! Howie!

811
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,958
- Howie!
- [Darren] Let go.

812
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,583
Are you riding the wave?
How's this wave for you?

813
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:36,250
- Howie, you're hurting him.
- I've got his dick in my hand! His <i>lulli!</i>

814
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,666
Let go of his <i>lulli.</i>

815
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,416
Howie, release! Release!

816
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,166
I'll rip his <i>lulli</i> off
if you keep pushing me!

817
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,625
Don't push me!
That's enough. I'm gone from here.

818
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:48,375
Sick of this place! What kind
of devilish business going on in here?

819
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,416
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here?

820
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
I'll tell you what. I'm leaving!

821
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:56,041
Howie, you are not leaving.
We are in the middle of shooting!

822
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,208
I don't give a shit. You can replace me.

823
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:00,750
That's not true!
No one can play Jarrar but you.

824
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,083
You're irreplaceable!

825
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:05,000
Anybody could play Jarrar!
Should I tell you why? Batman!

826
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:07,041
- Batman?
- He was Michael Keaton, yeah?

827
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,416
Then he was Val Kilmer.

828
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,333
Then George Clooney,
but he brought too much sex to the role!

829
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,416
They got rid of him,
brought in Ben Affleck, Christian Bale,

830
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,791
now he's that skinny bastard
from <i>Twilight.</i>

831
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,625
Not within the same movie!

832
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:21,833
Zip! Gavin, everybody is replaceable.

833
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:25,083
This is a very judgmental business.

00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:05,833
<i>I like your hair.</i>

1008
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,000
<i>For our next exercise,</i>

1009
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,958
<i>I would like you
to enter me for 30 thrusts.</i>

1010
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:14,416
<i>Let's do that ten times,</i>

1011
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:18,625
<i>and continue until I say we're done.</i>

1012
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,250
That's a lot of sets.

1013
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:24,583
- [both panting]
- I love you, Dr. Lacie.

1014
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:27,333
I love you too. But it's Carol.

1015
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:29,125
[moans] Carol Lacie.

1016
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:31,750
- No, just Carol!
- [both gasp]

1017
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:32,833
Dr. Carol.

1018
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,791
- No, I'm not a doctor.
- [grunts]

1019
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:36,958
Kate?

1020
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:39,375
Are you me?

1021
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:42,583
<i>I'm you. You're me. I'm horny. Who cares?</i>

1022
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:44,166
This is creepy,

1023
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,541
but I like it.

1024
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:48,083
<i>Shut up. Get over here.</i>

1025
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:49,208
Yes, ma'am.

1026
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:55,666
[upbeat music playing]

1027
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,083
[both moaning and gasping]

1028
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:04,125
[speaking Spanish]

1029
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:05,250
I don't understand!

1030
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,708
[moaning loudly]

1031
00:48:07,791 --> 00:48:09,458
[both panting]

1032
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:14,416
Did you?

1033
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:16,583
No.

1034
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:18,208
I never orgasm.

1035
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:22,000
Oh! [moaning]

1036
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:26,291
[Kate, repeating]
<i>Are you ready to start a new day?</i>

1037
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:27,583
[Dieter] I'm sorry.

1038
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:29,750
[whimsical music playing]

1039
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:33,333
Ronjon, make sure you spend time
on that pineapple. Each groove.

1040
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:35,041
All right.

1041
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:37,625
Thank you.

1042
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:39,750
[shivering]

1043
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:42,791
Oh, my God.

1044
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:44,625
I think I'm sick.

1045
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah, you're sick with love.

1046
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,541
No, I think it's the virus.

1047
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,791
You can't have the virus.
We're in the bubble.

1048
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,291
[vomiting]

1049
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,125
Bola, hold my hair.

1050
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,500
Your hair is short.
There is no hair to hold!

1051
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,541
[groaning] Hold my hair!

1052
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:08,166
Uh, I don't want to be here.
I want to resign.

1053
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,500
[sobbing] Bola...

1054
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:11,625
Uh...

1055
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,541
[hesitates] I really don't want to.

1056
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,458
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- [sobs] Bola...

1057
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:19,208
Where do I hold? Okay!

1058
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,416
[vomiting, grunts]

1059
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,916
[Bola] No! No, no, no, no!

1060
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,208
[farts]

1061
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:27,083
[both screaming]

1062
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,166
[Gavin] Okay, guys? Uh, listen up.

1063
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,250
Uh, I've got some very important
health news for you.

1064
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:38,583
- You all tested negative for the virus.
- Yes!

1065
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:43,833
However, some of you
have tested positive for influenza.

1066
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,875
- The good virus.
- [Gunther] The good one.

1067
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,375
Two of you tested positive

1068
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:51,708
for two separate cases
of sexually transmitted diseases.

1069
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:55,291
How'd we get the flu? We're in the bubble.

1070
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:57,583
[Gavin] We've narrowed it down
to a delivery person

1071
00:49:57,666 --> 00:49:59,875
and one of the gardeners.
We are handling it.

1072
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,791
If this is just the normal flu,

1073
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:04,250
we could push on
and complete the day, right?

1074
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:05,833
Absolutely, yeah.

1075
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:09,375
Actors are some of the toughest people
I know. We can handle it.

1076
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:13,416
I once played host
to a 30-foot-long tapeworm

1077
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,333
during <i>Cliff Beasts 2,</i>
and nobody even knew.

1078
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:19,625
I broke my wrist and ankle
on the last movie I did.

1079
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:22,500
- I didn't tell anybody.
- Good lad. That's the spirit.

1080
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:25,416
I'm very concerned about Carol and Dieter.

1081
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,416
I think they should at least
have the rest of the day off.

1082
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,041
We're not shutting this down
for a bit of snot.

1083
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:35,083
Let's have a show of hands, okay?
Who wants to power through today?

1084
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:36,541
[coughing]

1085
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:40,958
Right, let's get out there
and kill some cliff beasts!

1086
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,541
- [actors] Yeah!
- Yes!

1087
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:45,083
[dramatic music playing]

1088
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:47,625
[straining]

1089
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:49,083
[loud growling in distance]

1090
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:50,791
I can hear something!

1091
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,250
The nest must be close.

1092
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:55,791
[grunting]

1093
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:02,666
You guys better get moving,
or you're gonna be bird seed.

1094
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,125
[Sean grunts]

1095
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:05,625
I don't feel so good.

1096
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,708
We should do this another day.

1097
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:10,750
[grunting]

1098
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:12,833
- You got this.
- [Dustin] Lauren?

1099
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,083
- [sighs]
- Lauren!

1100
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:16,333
[Lauren moans]

1101
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,791
Something's up with Lauren.

1102
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,416
[both grunting]

1103
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,041
I can't do this anymore.

1104
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:24,916
[Krystal moans]

1105
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,500
[Carol] Oh, my God, I'm gonna throw up.

1106
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,916
[Krystal] Please don't
because then I will too.

1107
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,958
Winners never quit,
and quitters never win!

1108
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:36,083
I don't wanna act anymore.
I wanna go back to the room.

1109
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:38,916
Let's shoot it quickly.
You'll be proud when it's done.

1110
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,875
Carol, can you stop gaslighting me?

1111
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:45,083
Gaslighting? That is not gaslighting.
You know what? Your generation sucks!

1112
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:46,750
At least I'm not a baby boomer.

1113
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:50,208
I'm not a baby boomer.
I am Generation Y, thank you very much.

1114
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:52,583
Ladies, this is no time for catfighting.

1115
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:55,375
- [dramatic music playing]
- [loud screeching]

1116
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:00,666
I saw a photo of you at a Nirvana concert.

1117
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,125
[scoffs] No, you didn't. That wasn't me.

1118
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:05,208
It doesn't look like they're climbing.

1119
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:07,625
Right, like, why don't they have ropes?

1120
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:11,375
And would they let the little girl
free climb a cliff like this?

1121
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:13,875
Would she even know how to do it?

1122
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:17,083
- I think she's unconscious.
- I think Lauren seems fine.

1123
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:19,041
Wake up, Lauren. Come on. Climb.

1124
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:22,666
For your first time free climbing,
you're doing a great job, guys!

1125
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,666
Okay, guys, I really think
I'm gonna throw up.

1126
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,416
[Dustin] Maybe call the set medic?

1127
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,333
I don't like it when people throw up.

1128
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:30,833
Oh, God.

1129
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:32,875
[vomits and groans]

1130
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:33,958
Whoops.

1131
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,708
- Should we bring them down?
- Let's just see how it plays out.

1132
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:43,916
Should we be concerned about this level
of vomit? Just 'cause, you know...

1133
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,666
There's something going round.

1134
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,750
- [Bola] It smells like ham or something.
- Shh. It's okay.

1135
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,375
I need touch-ups
on hair and makeup, please!

1136
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:53,916
- [stomach gurgling]
- Can hair and makeup step in, please?

1137
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,875
Hey, Lauren? Who would you say
is the most fun person to act with?

1138
00:52:57,958 --> 00:53:00,250
<i>Gavin, there's no time for recuperation.</i>

1139
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,666
<i>You have to
get the dinosaurs flying again.</i>

1140
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,416
- I'm not a magician.
- I know you're not a fucking magician!

1141
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,833
If you were,
you could pull a movie out of your ass!

1142
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:10,458
Oh, my God, it's Minnie Driver.
[gasps] I love her.

1143
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:13,750
You know, these are human beings.
They're not machines.

1144
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:17,708
Bucko, need I remind you,
you used to be addicted to meth.

1145
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:21,416
Once you stayed up for three weeks,
did something bad, and I covered for you.

1146
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,875
Okay, yes, I remember.
Thank you for reminding me, Paula.

1147
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:28,041
If I'd ever told anyone, you'd be in jail
for the rest of your life.

1148
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:30,625
Don't make me get tough.
I don't like to get tough.

1149
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,166
You do like being tough. You love it.

1150
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,458
Can I put something
into perspective for you?

1151
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:38,125
We are one of two movies
in production right now.

1152
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,767
- It's us and Tom Cruise.
- [Gavin] Yeah.

1153
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:45,375
<i>If we fail, a $50 billion corporation
is going to go down.</i>

1154
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:47,750
<i>People murder each other over ten grand.</i>

1155
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:51,875
<i>What do you think
they're gonna do over $50 billion?</i>

1156
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:53,708
<i>You ass!</i> [gasps]

1157
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,791
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

1158
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:59,458
<i>Okay, so Mel Gibson is on the boat,
and I think he thinks we're dating.</i>

1159
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:02,208
<i>We did stuff last night.
He's taking it too seriously.</i>

1160
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:03,208
What did you do?

1161
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:05,083
Just over-the-pants stuff.

1162
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,833
Guy, what's up?

1163
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,541
Oh! Listen! I've got
so many presents for you.

1164
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:14,083
These people,
they don't even care about what they have.

1165
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:17,458
Yeah, I've got soap. I've got cream.

1166
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:21,000
I've got... You need a corkscrew?
I'm gonna send you two corkscrews.

1167
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:24,458
There's Bibles everywhere, in every room.
They don't even read them!

1168
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:28,333
I'm gonna send it to you so we can pray
for them 'cause they're all going to hell.

1169
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,250
- They're mistreating you.
- Mmm.

1170
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,666
Makes me furious.

1171
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,541

Not to have her come back,

are trying to get us to be leavers too.

with everything I was saying,

1503
01:09:58,916 --> 01:10:02,000
and I'm so glad because
if you don't get the movie in the can,

1504
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:06,375
I'll send one of these fucking elephants
to trample your house and your children.

1505
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:09,625
Okay? <i>Hakuna matata,</i> my sweet. [kisses]

1506
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:11,291
- [line disconnects]
- Wow.

1507
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,583
I so wanna be her.

1508
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:15,458
Hi, Tom.

1509
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:17,166
<i>I hate to tell you this,</i>

1510
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:21,625
<i>but I don't think we have enough time
or money to finish this</i> Cliff Beasts...

1511
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:23,875
<i>Great, then just get it done
and we'll be in touch.</i>

1512
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:26,708
I don't think it's possible
to get it done.

1513
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:31,375
Don't make an enemy of me, Paula.
I will destroy you from within!

1514
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:34,750
Okay, Tom. Thank you for this opportunity.

1515
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:36,083
[line ringing]

1516
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:37,666
[exhales sharply]

1517
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,041
- Hello?
- [Tom] Li.

1518
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:42,250
<i>The schedule's impossible
with the budget we have.</i>

1519
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:44,958
<i>Great. Then get it done
and we will be in touch.</i>

1520
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:48,041
<i>No, Li, you don't understand.
This is impossible.</i>

1521
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:51,541
I have faith in you.
You have never let me down before.

1522
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:53,125
<i>Wait.</i>

1523
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,291
<i>Are you in Fiji?</i>

1524
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:58,500
<i>- Yes, I'm in Fiji.
- I'm down the beach!</i>

1525
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:01,541
<i>I have not seen anyone in 37 days!</i>

1526
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:04,625
<i>- You want to play tennis?
- I would love to play tennis!</i>

1527
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,083
<i>- Four o'clock?
- Four o'clock!</i>

1528
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:09,000
Do you have balls?
Oh, I have balls! [chuckles]

1529
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:13,208
I spoke to Lauren this morning.

1530
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:17,541
She loves you all, and she said
the best thing that you could do for her

1531
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:21,375
would be to make this movie great.

1532
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:24,416
I spoke to her too,
and she is not being cool about it.

1533
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,833
She's really pissed at me
like it's my fault.

1534
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:28,541
I didn't shoot her fingers off.

1535
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:33,500
Mr. Best's team thought that you were
being attacked by a crazed stalker.

1536
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,458
Were they able to reattach her fingers?

1537
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,041
- They, uh, didn't find any of them.
- [Darren gasps]

1538
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:40,666
- All that's left is a thumb.
- This is a blessing.

1539
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,291
Lauren is gonna
come back from this stronger.

1540
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:47,958
There are a million things you can do
with a thumb. It's not like it's a pinkie.

1541
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:50,750
When will she shoot
the rest of her scenes?

1542
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:54,416
Well, we're not gonna shoot
the rest of her scenes. Lauren is wrapped.

1543
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,916
We've got some clever fixes
I don't think anybody's gonna notice.

1544
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,875
So are <i>we</i> allowed to leave?

1545
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:03,416
We can't do that, unfortunately.
You have to stay 'cause we have contracts.

1546
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,750
It's called being an adult.

1547
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,791
Fucking Jesus Christ.

1548
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:11,000
[Gavin] Uh, one hiccup.
Shouldn't be too much of a problem.

1549
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:14,375
Our stunt coordinator, Steve,
has had a bit of a virus scare,

1550
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:18,375
so he is going to be joining us
on Zoom today.

1551
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:21,750
- Oh, it takes so long to shoot action.
- Steve!

1552
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:25,541
<i>Hey, guys! Hope everybody's excited
for today's stunt sequence.</i>

1553
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:28,791
Uh, Steve, looks like
you lost some weight. [chuckles]

1554
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,375
<i>I'm the same weight as always.</i>

1555
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,000
All right, uh, let's go through the scene.

1556
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:36,458
<i>Okay, you know what? Let's run it.
Just as we rehearsed, it's gonna be...</i>

1557
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:39,708
[voice breaking] <i>I froze.
I'm frozen. Did I freeze?</i>

1558
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:42,041
<i>Fucking bullshit!
I told you it wouldn't work!</i>

1559
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:44,791
[voice breaking] <i>Am I clear now?
Am I coming in clear?</i>

1560
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,000
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

1561
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:49,875
<i>Here's how it goes. The action starts
when Dustin engages the first iceman.</i>

1562
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:53,416
<i>Typical hand-to-hand combat. Remember,
parry, jab, end up with a naked choke.</i>

1563
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,375
<i>Okay, take me over to the mound.</i>

1564
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:58,291
<i>On the mound, Carol's gonna
take out icemen four and five</i>

1565
01:12:58,375 --> 01:12:59,791
<i>with a series of explosions.</i>

1566
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,666
<i>Dieter and Krystal, you're providing
cover fire for the icemen,</i>

1567
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,666
[voice breaking] <i>and,
Sean, you're gonna walk...</i>

1568
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:09,416
Question. When I'm supposed
to get to my mark, do I turn to my left?

1569
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:13,000
Okay, first team, walking on!
Let's do this!

1570
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:14,875
- [dramatic music playing]
- [yelling]

1571
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,333
[both grunting]

1572
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:23,833
[yelling]

1573
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,666
Oh! [yelling]

1574
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,125
- Whoo!
- [gunshot]

1575
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:32,583
[screaming]

1576
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:35,500
Watch out! Watch out!

1577
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:39,083
- [overlapping screams]
- [groaning]

1578
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,625
[chuckles] I'd see that movie!

1579
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:44,333
I forgot to tell you
that my dad sucks at stunts.

1580
01:13:44,416 --> 01:13:47,833
Sorry, think I grabbed the wrong wire.
Let's do another one... No!

1581
01:13:47,916 --> 01:13:50,500
[people exclaiming]

1582
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:51,500
[man] Bloody hell.

1583
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:54,041
<i>I was checking my email
real quick. How'd it go?</i>

1584
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:57,291
Um... Not very well. We might have to...

1585
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:59,750
- Do another take, yeah.
- [Sean groaning]

1586
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,791
I want you to call the studio
and tell them to fuck off!

1587
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:09,208
<i>Well, what happens then when I need
to get a bigger trailer for Mark Ruffalo,</i>

1588
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:12,625
<i>I ask 'em and they say,
"You just told us to fuck off for Carol"?</i>

1589
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:16,083
<i>- I can't do that, okay?</i>
- Do I have a hard out date on my contract?

1590
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:18,791
- No.
- So they could just make me work forever.

1591
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:22,541
No, not forever. They're not monsters!
They're just trying to make a good movie.

1592
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,083
We're being mistreated!

1593
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:27,583
Oh, spare me!
You're being "actress-mistreated."

1594
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:29,750
I'm being fucking human being-mistreated!

1595
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:33,750
<i>You ever try to teach
a 12-year-old math? It's impossible, okay?</i>

1596
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,208
<i>He's been shut up in his room.</i>

1597
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:39,500
I walked in there the other day,
and he was watching Japanese taxi porn.

1598
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:41,333
<i>What is Japanese taxi porn?</i>

1599
01:14:41,416 --> 01:14:42,791
Just what it sounds like.

1600
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:46,916
They fuck the taxi driver
halfway through the video, in Japan!

1601
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,208
I need you to call the studio
and tell them to stop mistreating us.

1602
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:52,833
Otherwise, I'm out. I'm walking.

1603
01:14:52,916 --> 01:14:54,291
You walk off the film now,

1604
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:57,916
you are financially responsible
for any overages that you create.

1605
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,541
What? What does that mean?

1606
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:04,833
<i>It means that if you leave the movie,
you will owe them 114 million bucks.</i>

1607
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:06,500
I didn't know that was in there!

1608
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:08,833
I didn't either.
I didn't read your contract!

1609
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:11,875
You're not being
a good agent or a good friend.

1610
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:15,375
I'm being a <i>very</i> good agent.
And you know what? I'm not your friend.

1611
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:17,875
<i>It's something we pretend
when there isn't a pandemic.</i>

1612
01:15:17,958 --> 01:15:18,791
[phone rings]

1613
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:21,208
- I gotta go. It's Mark Ruffalo.
<i>- Don't hang up...</i>

1614
01:15:21,791 --> 01:15:22,791
Hey, Mark.

1615
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:25,750
[yells]

1616
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:28,416
[solemn music playing]

1617
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:44,333
Oh, my God, you're in the pool.

1618
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:45,541
How you doing?

1619
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,541
I thought today was so good.

1620
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:48,958
You did?

1621
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:53,250
- Did you not?
- No! Today was a disaster.

1622
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:56,500
- What are you talking about?
- Everyone got injured in the stunt!

1623
01:15:56,583 --> 01:16:00,708
I mean before the stunt. The scene
that we did before was incredible.

1624
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:03,208
That was genius,
but everybody got really hurt.

1625
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:06,833
Yeah, that was unfortunate for sure.
I'm gonna talk to them tomorrow.

1626
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,583
I just... Honestly, I don't think
I have anything left to give.

1627
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:13,916
I'm so sorry about that.

1628
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,583
I guess I was so focused on the dinosaurs,
I forgot there are human beings involved.

1629
01:16:18,666 --> 01:16:20,000
Right.

1630
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:24,916
Yeah. I'm gonna talk to Gavin. I'm gonna
really change things so that you're happy.

1631
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,291
I am mortified.

1632
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:29,791
Really? That would be a lifesaver!

1633
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:32,291
Carol, I'm really sorry.

1634
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:41,583
[Darren] I'm gonna fix this.

1635
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:43,208
[clears throat]

1636
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:45,833
[both laughing]

1637
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:47,750
- Hey.
- Oh, my God!

1638
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,250
- I'll race you. Come on!
- Hey!

1639
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:52,083
Come on. Try and catch me! [laughing]

1640
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:53,166
Marco!

1641
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:57,166
Hey, Darren. What's up here?

1642
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,875
These are not my pages.

1643
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:02,416
Yeah, um, we decided we're just...
We're not gonna shoot those.

1644
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:07,083
They weren't good, so we're gonna go
and shoot the original script,

1645
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:10,541
also known as the real script
that was approved by the studio.

1646
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,916
Also known as the worst fucking draft!

1647
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,708
Everybody agrees
that my revisions are kicking ass.

1648
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:18,000
They clarify
our pro-environmental message.

1649
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:20,791
People don't care about the environment.

1650
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:24,500
People go to see the movies
to see dinosaurs blow up and die.

1651
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:28,000
Why? Because dinosaurs kill people.
They're monsters!

1652
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:31,416
We need a movie with heart.
[hesitates] Ask Martha. Martha?

1653
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,041
She's our audience.

1654
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:35,083
Don't the dinosaurs need to live?

1655
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:39,541
I don't care if dinosaurs die, you know?
I thought they <i>were</i> dead.

1656
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,375
Fine. I'll do your shit word-for-word.

1657
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,458
That fucking scene we're about to shoot,

1658
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:48,833
I don't know how I'll make it work,
but I will 'cause that's what I do.

1659
01:17:48,916 --> 01:17:50,375

01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:29,875
Is this live?

1821
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,125
Hello, can you hear me?
Please help us, okay?

1822
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:35,166
They are holding us against our will.
I can't do another movie.

1823
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:37,625
- I can't! It's not safe here, okay?
- [switch clicks]

1824
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:41,250
What the fuck happened to the lights?
Can somebody turn those back on?

1825
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:43,750
- What?
- It's not live.

1826
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:45,291
- [Carol] What?
- It's not live.

1827
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:48,083
- We're not live.
- [Carol] Oh.

Oh! That is perfect.
Thank you so much, Krystal.

1839
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:30,333
I'm so happy to help. I know how hard
it's been for some of the older actors.

1840
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:31,958
Yeah, it's been hard for them.

1841
01:26:32,041 --> 01:26:34,541
- You shouldn't post it.
- What? Why?

1842
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:37,166
Because you sound
like whiny, spoiled actors.

1843
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,500
I am not spoiled!

1844
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:41,250

1846

Hold on. If this is gonna make me
look bad, I am not posting this.

1850
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,875
I can't ruin my own brand.

1851
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:57,791
It's not gonna hurt. You're the hero.

1852
01:26:57,875 --> 01:27:00,583
- It would make you look really bad.
- [Carol] Whoa, uh...

1853
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:02,083
What did you just do?

1854
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:03,166
I deleted it.

1855

She is not! She's my friend.

You sound like some crazy,
rambling old actress. We're leaving.

1859

1860
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:18,791
Sorry.

1861
01:27:19,416 --> 01:27:20,416
Aah!

1862
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,083
I deserved that.

1863
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,333

Fuck you.

1866
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:32,458
I'm sorry I hit you. I'm just having
a really hard time right now.

1867
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,083
- Hey, Sean.
- You said you wanted to talk to me.

1868
01:27:37,166 --> 01:27:39,083
- Thank you for coming. Come in.
- Sure.

1869
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:41,625
I'm just having a bit of a hard time,

1870
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:44,291
and I didn't know
what to do or where to go.

1871
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:47,333
- Um, Sean?
- Yeah.

1872
01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:51,916
I always thought
you guys were all fucking clowns.

1873
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,375
I thought I was the only one
who had it all together.

1874
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:56,333
But Josh was right.

1875
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:59,208
I'm the worst one of all of you.

1876
01:27:59,291 --> 01:28:00,750
- No!
- Yes!

1877
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:01,833
But you?

1878
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:05,125
You're always so happy
and positive all the time,

1879
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:09,916
and I was just hoping that maybe you could
help me because I'm falling apart here.

1880
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Carol.

1881
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:12,833
Problems?

1882
01:28:13,416 --> 01:28:15,375
They're just lessons in disguise.

1883
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:21,791
Remember that one step is the first...
There's... You know...

1884
01:28:23,291 --> 01:28:26,958
The first step
in the thousand steps of your journey.

1885
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:28,041
Okay.

1886
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:34,375
Every day...

1887
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:38,708
every day is an opportunity for, uh...

1888
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:40,250
Uh, for you to...

1889
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:41,291
For what?

1890
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:47,500
I don't have a fucking clue.

1891
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:50,041
I don't know what I'm doing.

1892
01:28:52,041 --> 01:28:53,500
I'm a complete fraud.

1893
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:55,333
- What?
- I'm sorry.

1894
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:58,666
The book is great.
You should read the book.

1895
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:04,333
But please understand, I didn't write it.
Steve Harvey's ghostwriter wrote the book.

1896
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:07,250
In fact, the only time... [laughing]

1897
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:10,041
The only time I ever read it

1898
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:14,250
was when I was in the recording studio,
making the audio book.

1899
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:17,291
And I was bored.
I was bored with the whole experience.

1900
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:21,875
Okay? I'm sorry, but during the pandemic,
I realized that we're all the same.

1901
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:25,125
And I thought that I was special.

1902
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:28,666
And, uh, you know, that's all I got.

1903
01:29:30,166 --> 01:29:31,166
But I'm not.

1904
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:33,041
I'm not.

[bones cracking]

1928
01:30:55,875 --> 01:31:00,666
The biggest mistake I made on this movie
is not being on drugs the whole time.

1929
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:03,208
There should just be a campaign.
"Say yes to drugs."

1930
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:06,333
I feel very embarrassed
that I used to tell people not to do them.

People should do them. They're great!

Why can't I keep a man?

1934
01:31:12,291 --> 01:31:13,125
Oh, Jesus.

Okay, so my ex, Josh, he dumped me
and left me for a fucking waitress.

1936

you'd just wanna punch me

'cause I was that handsome.
You just wanted to ruin it.

1939
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:29,666
You know what?
This business is so unfair to women, okay?

1940
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:32,541
It is not fair.
You have to stay young and be skinny,

1941
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:34,583
but have big boobs at the same time.

1942
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:37,916
It's impossible because nobody
has that body type without surgery.

1943
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,500
You can't be skinny
and have big boobs at the same time!

1944
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:43,500
It is physically impossible!
It's impossible! [sniffles]

01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:51,916
Dieter! Oh, fuck. What's going on?

1986
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,166
- [Bola grunting]
- God. What are you doing?

1987
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:57,000
It's a heart attack!
We need to attack it back.

1988
01:33:57,583 --> 01:33:59,333
- What? That is not true!
- Heart attack!

1989
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:02,166
- [Sean] Medical kit!
- Oh. Can you get me the NARCAN?

1990
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:03,666
- Yes.
- Oh. I can't deal with this.

1991
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:06,708
If he's taken opioids,
this should dilute them.

1992
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:08,791
[intense music playing]

1993
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:09,708
There we go.

1994
01:34:09,791 --> 01:34:11,000
Come on, Dieter.

1995
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:15,791
- Doesn't appear to be working.
- Wait! He's allergic to peanuts.

1996
01:34:15,875 --> 01:34:17,291
- Oh!
- Clear!

1997
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:20,416
Come on, Dieter! Don't you die on me!

1998
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,208
Get out of my way! Everybody back.

1999
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:26,291
[speaking Hindi]

2000
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:28,708
[in English] What language
are you speaking?

2001
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:32,041
When I get stressed, I speak Hindi.
It's a better crisis language.

2002
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,125
- We should shock him now.
- Right, yeah.

2003
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:35,041
Three...

2004
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:37,208
[both] Two, one, clear!

2005
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:42,041
[Ronjon panting]

2006
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:43,500
- [Sean sighs]
- [Carol gasps]

2007
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:45,083
What time is it?

2008
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:48,083
3:23.

2009
01:34:48,166 --> 01:34:51,833
Okay. Time of death, 3:23.

2010
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:54,333
- Time of death? Are we calling death?
- Time of death?

2011
01:34:54,416 --> 01:34:55,666
It's over.

2012
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:59,125
Okay, but what we're gonna do
is we're gonna go to the bar,

2013
01:34:59,208 --> 01:35:04,083
and we're gonna raise a glass, okay,
to what an incredible legacy he had.

2014
01:35:04,166 --> 01:35:06,500
He was a magician. A chameleon.

2015
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:09,458
A reptile that could change colors.

2016
01:35:09,541 --> 01:35:11,375
His chest is still moving, Gunther!

2017
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:17,125
He's not alive! Okay? That's just the body
letting him go by moving a little bit.

2018
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:18,416
That's what that is.

2019
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,708
- They call it death breath.
- I think he wants to come back to us.

2020
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:24,666
[Gunther] Good night, sweet prince.
Go to that beautiful light!

2021
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:27,375
- [Sean] Do not go to the light.
- You can go to the light.

2022
01:35:27,458 --> 01:35:29,250
- Don't go to the light.
- You can go.

2023
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:30,708
- Come back.
- Go.

2024
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:31,625
- Don't.
- Hold on!

2025
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:33,541
Don't let go. Hold on. Come back.

2026
01:35:33,625 --> 01:35:34,708
Oh, my God!

2027
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:36,791
Wake up! Wake up!

2028
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:38,291
Can you stop? Stop it!

2029
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:41,500
It's heatstroke from the dancing!
Let's get him on ice.

2030
01:35:41,583 --> 01:35:43,250
[gripping music playing]

2031
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:45,291
I think we need more ice.

2032
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
- At least the ice will preserve him.
- We gotta get him out of here.

2033
01:35:50,958 --> 01:35:51,833
[all grunt]

2034
01:35:51,916 --> 01:35:54,583
- What else is in the bag?
- [Gunther] Okay, oh, um...

2035
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:57,000
- [Sean] I just...
- Whoa. What happened?

2036
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:58,416
Where the fuck did you come from?

2037
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:01,541
- Oh, my God, was the dance that hard?
- What's happening?

2038
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:03,291
- [Sean] Yeah, on him.
- [Carol] Dieter.

2039
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:05,375
Oh, my God. Dieter!

2040
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:08,583
- What is happening?
- [Gunther] He just went down.

2041
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:11,333
- What are we doing to save him?
- We haven't tried this.

2042
01:36:11,416 --> 01:36:13,666
- Give it to me.
- [Carol] Oh. She's just gonna do it.

2043
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:16,208
- [all exclaiming]
- Oh, my God! Anika!

2044
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:18,875
- [gasps]
- [others clamoring]

2045
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:20,250
Oh, my God!

2046
01:36:20,333 --> 01:36:22,250
- I knew it was gonna work!
- Yes!

2047
01:36:22,333 --> 01:36:24,291
- All right!
- [Carol] Oh, my God!

2048
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:26,250
[Sean laughing] Whoo!

2049
01:36:26,333 --> 01:36:27,916
[emotional music playing]

2050
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
You saved me.

2051
01:36:29,791 --> 01:36:30,625
[Anika] Yes.

2052
01:36:30,708 --> 01:36:31,833
[breath trembling]

2053
01:36:33,416 --> 01:36:34,583
You are an angel.

2054
01:36:35,166 --> 01:36:37,750
Yes. I was trying to tell you.

2055
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:41,666
You do love me?

2056
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:44,750
I've loved you for a thousand years,

2057
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:47,875
and I will love you
for another thousand years.

2058
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:52,166
Can someone take the needle out?
It's a little too much.

2059
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:55,208
[Bola] Yes, this is disgusting.
Let me have this. Thank you!

2060
01:36:56,458 --> 01:36:57,833
[Carol] Oh, my God, guys.

2061
01:36:57,916 --> 01:37:00,875
Look around.
Think about what just happened.

2062
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:02,500
We worked together,

2063
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:05,916
and together, we saved a life.

2064
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:10,625
And we may fight it,
and, oh, how we fight it,

2065
01:37:10,708 --> 01:37:12,541
but we are a family.

2066
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:15,833
A <i>Cliff Beasts</i> family.

2067
01:37:16,833 --> 01:37:19,208
And that is just such a beautiful thing.

2068
01:37:19,791 --> 01:37:22,833
Listen to me. This is...
This is not even me acting.

2069
01:37:22,916 --> 01:37:24,791
No, we know. That felt real.

2070
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:29,125
And we have to come together as a family
and lead each other to freedom

2071
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:31,708
because we are heroes.

2072
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:34,958
I don't understand the metaphor.
Are we heroes or family?

2073
01:37:35,041 --> 01:37:38,041
We're both! We are a family of heroes,

2074
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:41,750
and we are going to save our family
because we are the heroes and the family,

2075
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:44,958
and that's what heroes do,
is save their families.

2076
01:37:45,041 --> 01:37:46,541
So we're a family now.

2077
01:37:46,625 --> 01:37:49,416
No, that's just for the actors.
They still think we're shit.

2078
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:52,625
Thank you for being my family
and for helping me through all of this.

2079
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:55,625
I love you all
from the bottom of my heart,

2080
01:37:55,708 --> 01:37:59,041
and I now see what I have to do
and my reason for being here,

2081
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:01,750
and it is to lead you all to freedom.

2082
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:05,500
I don't understand. You're leading us
to freedom. Where is freedom?

2083
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:08,333
Freedom is the fuck out of here!

2084
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:11,083
That's the cocaine talking right there.

2085
01:38:11,166 --> 01:38:13,041
- [dramatic music playing]
- [growling]

2086
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,666
- [thunderclap]
- [growls]

2087
01:38:18,666 --> 01:38:21,708
[cliff beasts growling]

2088
01:38:27,541 --> 01:38:29,583
Can't they see we're trying to save them?

2089
01:38:29,666 --> 01:38:31,291
We can't save them if they're dead!

2090
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:33,916
If they touch this wire,
we can knock them out

2091
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,916
and take them to an ice cave
and figure out how to care for them.

2092
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,125
Good idea, Vivian!

2093
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,875
[music continues]

2094
01:38:39,958 --> 01:38:41,791
[screeching and growling]

2095
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:50,166
[Dieter in ambiguous accent]
I know a better way.

2096
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:52,291
Let's put them to sleep,

2097
01:38:53,083 --> 01:38:54,666
permanently!

2098
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,875
[actors exclaiming]

2099
01:38:56,708 --> 01:38:58,041
[Sean] He's a madman!

2100
01:38:58,125 --> 01:39:02,208
If we get them in the reproductive organs,
their hormones are toxic and flammable.

2101
01:39:02,291 --> 01:39:06,500
Gio, you promised
to honor and protect them!

2102
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:08,250
Well, you silly little girl,

2103
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
looks like Gio lied. [yells]

2104
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:17,333
[Sean] No, stop!

2105
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:22,166
Why, Gio, why? All for a luxury hotel?

2106
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:24,666
The cliff beasts must burn!

2107
01:39:25,166 --> 01:39:27,625
And if all of you stand beside them,

2108
01:39:27,708 --> 01:39:31,791
then you will burn with them!

2109
01:39:33,291 --> 01:39:34,625
[cliff beast roaring]

2110
01:39:35,625 --> 01:39:40,083
- [groans] Cliff beasts!
- [sobbing]

2111
01:39:40,166 --> 01:39:41,541
[Sean] Gio!

2112
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:43,166
[Carol] Let's help him!

2113
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:45,625
[Dieter] Save me! Aah!

2114
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:48,000
- [Sean] No!
- No!

2115
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:50,958
[screaming]

2116
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:55,458
I can't look! It's horrible!

2117
01:39:56,833 --> 01:40:01,250
I hate to admit it, but unfortunately,
Gio just proved his own point.

2118
01:40:01,333 --> 01:40:02,333
What?

2119
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:05,833
We have to kill them all.

2120
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:09,416
[Carol] He's right.

2121
01:40:12,583 --> 01:40:13,791
Let's do this.

2122
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:18,333
Light the sky on fire!

2123
01:40:18,416 --> 01:40:20,291
[heroic instrumental music playing]

2124
01:40:20,375 --> 01:40:22,666
Die, you feathered fucks!

2125
01:40:29,166 --> 01:40:32,125
Shoot their reproductive organs.
They're flammable!

2126
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:34,250
Go for the nuts!

2127
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:36,250
[yells] Balls!

2128
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:37,916
[screeches]

2129
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,333
[cliff beast groaning]

2130
01:40:46,416 --> 01:40:49,875
Die, nature! Die!

2131
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:53,166
Darren, I hate this rewrite.
This is so stupid.

2132
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:55,083
- Cut!
- [bell ringing]

2133
01:40:55,166 --> 01:40:57,291
What? It looks great.

2134
01:40:57,375 --> 01:40:59,000
So the ending that you came up with

2135
01:40:59,083 --> 01:41:03,041
is me shooting at cock and balls
with a flamethrower? That's what you got?

2136
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:06,083
Dustin, you're misunderstanding
what this is gonna look like.

2137
01:41:06,166 --> 01:41:08,083
It's not cock and balls.

2138
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:09,958
These are reproductive organs.

2139
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:13,375
It comes out of the dinosaur
like a jellyfish,

2140
01:41:13,458 --> 01:41:15,791
and it just moves towards the camera.

2141
01:41:15,875 --> 01:41:19,041
And the little tentacles,
and it's fluorescent,

2142
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:22,833
and it goes back into the body.
It looks beautiful!

2143
01:41:22,916 --> 01:41:24,583
The people from <i>Paddington</i> made it.

2144
01:41:24,666 --> 01:41:26,791
[Dustin] Why would I shoot
at a gelatinous,

2145
01:41:26,875 --> 01:41:28,791
pulsing dinosaur dick and balls like that?

2146
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,791
That sounds like you're attacking
some kind of defenseless thing.

2147
01:41:31,875 --> 01:41:36,375
You're the hero! You have to kill them.
Otherwise they'll take over the world!

2148
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:38,541
Why don't we
just shoot 'em in the asshole?

2149
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:42,458
[Darren] It's not even a dick.
It's a metaphor for the virus.

2150
01:41:43,041 --> 01:41:44,458

look like a jellyfish?

01:49:21,416 --> 01:49:22,416
[Dieter] Anika,

2323
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:24,583
you made it okay!

2324
01:49:24,666 --> 01:49:27,625
I got in here
three hours early just to be safe.

2325
01:49:27,708 --> 01:49:30,208
[romantic music playing]

2326
01:49:30,291 --> 01:49:33,916
I wanna live with you.
I wanna live with you in Beverly Hills.

2327
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,458
- I live in Sherman Oaks.
- Even better!

2328
01:49:36,541 --> 01:49:39,208
[music swelling]

2329
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:40,500
- You got this?
- Yeah.

2330
01:49:40,583 --> 01:49:42,750
- Whoo!
- No celebrating yet.

2331
01:49:42,833 --> 01:49:44,666
- Okay, no, we...
- [Dustin] Fly it.

2332
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:47,291
[dramatic music playing]

2333
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:54,416
Oh, man, this is a rush!

2334
01:49:55,041 --> 01:49:56,041
All right!

2335
01:49:57,083 --> 01:49:58,333
Yes!

2336
01:50:01,666 --> 01:50:04,541
Whoo! Whoo!

2337
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:10,458
Why are we standing still?

2338
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:11,666
What are you doing?

2339
01:50:12,291 --> 01:50:14,833
- [hesitates] Just hold on...
- [Dustin] Let's get going.

2340
01:50:14,916 --> 01:50:17,250
Okay, just give me a second. Um...

2341
01:50:17,833 --> 01:50:19,083
Okay, what is that one?

2342
01:50:19,166 --> 01:50:21,875
I've not seen that button.
I do not know what that does.

2343
01:50:22,458 --> 01:50:23,958
[Darren] What happens now?

2344
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:27,416
You're definitely gonna get the sack
for getting Howie to shoot Mr. Best.

2345
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:31,291
You'll be in directors jail for the rest
of your life, if that. You're finished.

2346
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:34,958
And I'm just gonna take over as producer
and get the movie in the can.

2347
01:50:35,041 --> 01:50:36,458
[music continues]

2348
01:50:37,875 --> 01:50:39,083
What are you doing?

2349
01:50:39,166 --> 01:50:41,833
Uh, I only know how to go up and down.

2350
01:50:41,916 --> 01:50:43,166
What?

2351
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:46,000
For the movie, they only taught me
how to go up and down.

2352
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:48,083
They didn't teach me how to go forward.

2353
01:50:49,291 --> 01:50:51,875
I don't know how to move forward, okay?

2354
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:54,208
I'm just, uh...
I don't know what else to do.

2355
01:50:55,541 --> 01:50:56,625
Just push it forward!

2356
01:50:56,708 --> 01:51:01,541
Well, I don't know if that's how it works.
It might be how it works. I don't know!

2357
01:51:01,625 --> 01:51:03,708
- Oh, my God.
- What is happening?

2358
01:51:03,791 --> 01:51:07,416
Krystal, go on YouTube. See if there's
a helicopter tutorial or something!

2359
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,041
Does YouTube still exist?

2360
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:10,708
- Yes!
- Yes, YouTube exists!

2361
01:51:10,791 --> 01:51:12,541
- It still exists!
- Okay!

2362
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:14,208
- Um...
- Hurry, Krystal.

2363
01:51:14,291 --> 01:51:17,041
- [amusing music plays]
- [chuckles]

2364
01:51:17,125 --> 01:51:18,708
What? What are you looking at?

2365
01:51:20,916 --> 01:51:24,041
[Krystal] It's a monkey
being washed in a sink.

2366
01:51:24,125 --> 01:51:26,916
- [Dustin] It's taking a bath.
- [Sean] What's happening?

2367
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,541
- It's a monkey.
- A monkey taking a bath?

2368
01:51:29,625 --> 01:51:31,541
- Look, he's so cute!
- Let me see.

2369
01:51:31,625 --> 01:51:33,125
I don't think he likes it!

2370
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:36,041
- Aw! His fur is so soapy!
- [alarm beeping]

2371
01:51:36,125 --> 01:51:38,541
- [all screaming]
- [intense music playing]

2372
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:40,625
- Stop this!
- Stop!

2373
01:51:40,708 --> 01:51:42,083
[all screaming]

2374
01:51:42,166 --> 01:51:43,416
[Sean] Krystal, show me!

2375
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,958
Hurry! Let's go!

2376
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:47,791
Stop yelling at me! Go, just watch it!

2377
01:51:47,875 --> 01:51:50,625
<i>Today, I'd like to talk to you
about how to fly a helicopter.</i>

2378
01:51:50,708 --> 01:51:53,083
<i>Why don't we hop in
and I'll show you how it works?</i>

2379
01:51:57,333 --> 01:51:59,208
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

2380
01:51:59,291 --> 01:52:00,625
It's a prop. It doesn't work.

2381
01:52:00,708 --> 01:52:03,833
I just thought maybe
this could scare them into coming back.

2382
01:52:03,916 --> 01:52:06,416
[mouthing]

2383
01:52:07,916 --> 01:52:11,708
- Okay, I think I got it.
- Darren is pointing a gun at us right now!

2384
01:52:11,791 --> 01:52:14,458
- [Carol] Oh, my God! We gotta go. Go!
- [Sean] Okay. Uh-huh.

2385
01:52:21,958 --> 01:52:23,833
Sean, I believe in you.

2386
01:52:24,416 --> 01:52:25,458
You can do this.

2387
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,416
I wanna be the hero, but I can't do it.

2388
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:31,541
Come on, guys, we're a family!

2389
01:52:32,625 --> 01:52:34,208
[valiant music playing]

2390
01:52:34,291 --> 01:52:35,750
Let's do this together.

2391
01:52:38,666 --> 01:52:39,916
[Dustin] Come on.

2392
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,750
All right. Okay, guys, here we go.

2393
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,916
We're doing it. We're doing it.
We're moving forward.

2394
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,041
[triumphant music playing]

2395
01:52:50,125 --> 01:52:52,291
[all screaming]

2396
01:52:52,375 --> 01:52:54,958
No, we're good! We're good!
We're good! We're good!

2397
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:57,875
We're good. I've got it. Okay.

2398
01:52:59,416 --> 01:53:01,916
So how are you doing?
This seems like a major setback.

2399
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,333
We're gonna be fine! We'll put
a cut together. It's gonna be great.

2400
01:53:06,125 --> 01:53:08,833
We're not done.
They'll probably come back!

2401
01:53:13,791 --> 01:53:15,250
I think I got it, everyone.

2402
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:17,500
We're going home.

2403
01:53:19,208 --> 01:53:22,333
[Bola] You sons of bitches,
you didn't tip us!

2404
01:53:22,416 --> 01:53:24,708
- [Carol] Oh, my God!
- Bye-bye, Clifton!

2405
01:53:24,791 --> 01:53:25,708
- Bye!
- Whoo-hoo!

2406
01:53:25,791 --> 01:53:27,791

[theme music playing]

- [electropop music playing]
- [people cheering]

2409
01:53:58,041 --> 01:53:59,833
I'm Susan Howard, reporting live

2410
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:03,125
from the premiere of a documentary
about a disastrous production

2411
01:54:03,208 --> 01:54:05,958
that the entire nation is talking about.

2412
01:54:06,041 --> 01:54:07,458
I'm a beast!

2413
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:08,541
[both] We're a beast!

2414
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:10,000
[all] I'm a beast!

2415
01:54:10,083 --> 01:54:12,458
- [both] I'm a beast!
- I ain't a fucking cliff beast.

2416
01:54:12,541 --> 01:54:15,833
- Let's get ready to bubble!
- Bubble!

2417
01:54:15,916 --> 01:54:17,625
[both growling]

2418
01:54:18,333 --> 01:54:19,541
[Dustin] <i>Cliff Beasts 6?</i>

2419
01:54:20,291 --> 01:54:21,458
Holy shit.

2420
01:54:21,541 --> 01:54:23,333
[orchestral music playing]

2421
01:54:23,416 --> 01:54:27,458
When Howie cracked, that's when we all
should have just gotten out of there.

2422
01:54:29,291 --> 01:54:33,166
And here's a warning. Do not leak this
on the Internet, you fucking idiots.

2423
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:36,875
- [Krystal] <i>The security was insane.</i>
- [yelling]

2424
01:54:36,958 --> 01:54:38,125
They had guns.

2425
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:39,250
[gunshot]

2426
01:54:39,333 --> 01:54:42,875
It felt like America, but in England.

2427
01:54:42,958 --> 01:54:44,250
[screaming]

2428
01:54:44,333 --> 01:54:48,666
The second these things go to streamers,
they're gonna be watched on televisions,

2429
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:50,708
and then that makes me a television star.

2430
01:54:50,791 --> 01:54:53,333
I'm not a television star!
I am a movie star!

2431
01:54:53,416 --> 01:54:55,166
What do you think I am? Young Sheldon?

2432
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:59,250
- No, don't leave me!
- Let go!

2433
01:55:00,833 --> 01:55:03,666
Not now. Turn that off, you tit!

2434
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:06,125
Yeah, the cast all called me EPK Guy.

2435
01:55:06,208 --> 01:55:09,125
It's like, "That's not my name.
My name is Scott."

2436
01:55:09,208 --> 01:55:11,375
Now they know it.
It's on the fucking poster.

2437
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:16,500
How does it feel to be the villain
of <i>Beasts of the Bubble?</i>

2438
01:55:16,583 --> 01:55:19,125
[chuckling] I'm not the villain.
What are you talking about?

2439
01:55:19,208 --> 01:55:22,083
Why are you complaining?
I can't leave and have almost no lines.

2440
01:55:22,166 --> 01:55:25,250
I'm over here with my dick in my hands
like a piece-of-shit extra!

2441
01:55:25,333 --> 01:55:28,375
No, I didn't know that all my Zoom calls
were being recorded.

2442
01:55:28,458 --> 01:55:29,916
[laughing]

2443
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,416
I could sue, but I won't
'cause I'm in on the joke,

2444
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:33,625
and I love the joke.

2445
01:55:33,708 --> 01:55:35,250
So you're the mole!

2446
01:55:35,333 --> 01:55:37,083
[chuckling] I know! I'm the mole.

2447
01:55:37,166 --> 01:55:39,500
I never thought it could work
as just a hand.

2448
01:55:39,583 --> 01:55:40,875
[laughing]

2449
01:55:40,958 --> 01:55:41,958
High five.

2450
01:55:42,541 --> 01:55:43,375
See?

2451
01:55:43,458 --> 01:55:44,458
[Sean yells]

2452
01:55:45,833 --> 01:55:47,125
Sean, how are you doing?

2453
01:55:47,208 --> 01:55:50,333
I heard you just got out of rehab
for cocaine addiction.

2454
01:55:50,416 --> 01:55:54,875
Yes, two-day rehab. I walked in one day.
I said, "I think I'm addicted to cocaine."

2455
01:55:54,958 --> 01:55:57,625
They said, "You shouldn't
do that anymore." I said, "Done."

2456
01:55:57,708 --> 01:55:59,833
- Two days, huh?
- 48 hours.

2457
01:55:59,916 --> 01:56:01,416
What's your next project, Darren?

2458
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,083
I'm doing the Skittles movie.

2459
01:56:03,166 --> 01:56:06,791
It's based on the candy.
It's got a great story. A passion project.

2460
01:56:06,875 --> 01:56:12,000
And it's about racism and diversity,
and how we can all get along.

2461
01:56:12,666 --> 01:56:15,625
It's all the flavors,
but it all goes under one name. Skittles.

2462
01:56:15,708 --> 01:56:19,125
So much exciting news for the two of you.
And who's this?

2463
01:56:19,833 --> 01:56:21,333
This is our friend, Kate.

2464
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:24,083
I have no idea why I'm here.

2465
01:56:24,166 --> 01:56:25,250
Come on, Kate.

2466
01:56:26,208 --> 01:56:27,208
Come on.

2467
01:56:28,083 --> 01:56:29,250
I'm a beast!

2468
01:56:29,333 --> 01:56:32,000
- Come on, Rafi, just say it with me.
- No, get off me!

2469
01:56:33,708 --> 01:56:36,166
So how have you been doing
since the movie?

2470
01:56:36,250 --> 01:56:37,333
Um, yeah, good.

2471
01:56:37,416 --> 01:56:39,750
Um, so I'm worried
I'm gonna get in trouble

2472
01:56:39,833 --> 01:56:42,875
because I didn't send
the swabs off to get tested.

2473
01:56:42,958 --> 01:56:45,125
Um, so I've still got
most of them at home.

2474
01:56:45,208 --> 01:56:48,708
And even now I don't really know
where to send them. If you know?

2475
01:56:49,541 --> 01:56:50,958
No? Thank you.

2476
01:56:51,041 --> 01:56:53,458
[upbeat music playing]

2477
01:57:00,291 --> 01:57:03,416
Do you think they have enough footage
in the can to put a cut together?

2478
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,583
We didn't get any of the opening,

2479
01:57:05,666 --> 01:57:08,875
but maybe that doesn't matter
as long as the ending's strong.

2480
01:57:08,958 --> 01:57:12,333
Yeah. The rest of the movie can be shit
as long as the ending's good

2481
01:57:12,416 --> 01:57:14,666
'cause that's what they'll remember.
You know?

2482
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:15,750
Oh, yeah.

2483
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:18,916
Well, at least we tried to make a movie.

2484
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,583
