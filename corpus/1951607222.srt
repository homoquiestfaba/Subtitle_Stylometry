1
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,160
This is so good.

2
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,231
I want more.

3
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,025
Don't get greedy.

4
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,465
Jeff?

5
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,593
HayIey.

6
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,695
Sorry.

7
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,741
I was gonna be, Iike,
so sophisticated when we met.

8
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,073
LittIe hard to do that with your mouth
fuII of...whatever that is.

9
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,613
It's great. It's great.
Do you want some?

10
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,909
Sure.

11
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,818
Yum.

12
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,753
It's, um...kind of
what I was thinking.

13
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,891
Sorry?

14
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:26,694
You just don't Iook Iike the kind of guy
who has to meet girIs over the internet.

15
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:30,098
I think it's better to meet peopIe
onIine first sometimes.

16
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,262
You get to know
what they're Iike inside.

17
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,967
When you work as a photographer
you find out reaI quick, peopIe's faces Iie.

18
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,776
Does my face Iie?

19
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,541
I Iook at those eyes
and I see...

20
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,952
a girI who reads Zadie Smith,

21
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,715
who Iistens to John Mayer
and CoIdPIay,

22
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:53,553
who Ioves Monty Python episodes

23
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,423
and who, desperateIy,

24
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,622
madIy, deepIy, wants,

25
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:04,192
needs, Iongs for...
more chocoIate.

26
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,934
ExceIIent, exceIIent
judge of character.

27
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,276
Can I get two of those truffIes

28
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,411
and two ganaches.

29
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,541
Now what's a ganache?

30
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,851
You don't know
what a ganache is?

31
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,082
Lucky, you're with
a woman of the worId

32
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,749
to introduce you to these things.

33
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,851
And two chocoIate-covered hearts.

34
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,625
And a decaf Iatte for me.

35
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,698
- And...?
- I'm good.

36
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,901
Yeah, you do appear so.

37
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,733
So what's in the bag?

38
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:42,740
Oh, you know,

39
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,400
just, Iike, books and stuff.

40
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,606
I figured if you stood me up,
then I shouId have something to read.

41
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,582
WeII... I couIdn't reaIIy decide.

42
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,883
I'm reading this book
about Jean Seberg.

43
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,719
She's this actress
who sIept with aII the wrong peopIe

44
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,384
and ended up kiIIing herseIf.

45
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,853
Don't you do that.

46
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,064
No. I intend to sIeep
with aII the right peopIe.

47
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,869
PIus, I'm reading Romeo and Juliet.

48
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,370
It's a ninth grade book,

49
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,000
but I figured I couId have it done
before the schooI year starts, so...

50
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,839
Doesn't Iook Iike
EIizabethan tragedy.

51
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,881
No, that's 'cause--

52
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,316
WeII, my dad-- he's Ietting me audit
one of his med schooI courses, right?

53
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,251
I don't reaIIy understand
haIf of it,

54
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,119
but I totaIIy Iove it.

55
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,688
What?

56
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,521
So you go to UCW

57
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,926
and you sit in a Iecture haII
with aII these grad students

58
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,056
and, what,
do they hit on you?

59
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,133
Why? Are you jeaIous?

60
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,264
Just admiring. I didn't know
you were interested in that kind of thing.

61
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,374
What?

62
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,001
You thought since we'd been chatting
for three weeks

63
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,137
that you knew everything about me?

64
00:06:55,248 --> 00:07:00,777
PIus, they wouIdn't hit on a 1 4-year-oId girI.
They're oId enough to be my dad, so...

65
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,849
They're Iike...

66
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,823
They're bad oIder.
They're-- You're not--

67
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,993
I'm so articuIate.

68
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,860
Sorry. Can I just, Iike,
start over?

69
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,298
No. I get it. I get it.
I just thought...

70
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,565
You know, weII,
you Iook oIder than you are.

71
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,197
You certainIy act
oIder than you are.

72
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,178
ReaIIy?

73
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,113
Yeah. I was expecting someone
not as impressive.

74
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,415
Me too.

75
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,359
CooI shirt.

76
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,654
You want it?

77
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,160
No, I didn't reaIIy bring
enough bucks, so...

78
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,289
And yet, not actuaIIy
what I was asking.

79
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,697
Sure, I want it.

80
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,929
Can I get a green shirt
in a smaII, pIease?

81
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,471
No. No, no.

82
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,598
- I can't Iet you do that.
- What? Because--

83
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,232
- Because--
- What? Because you'd be so

84
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,072
indebted to me
that you'd have to...

85
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,409
Okay. I guess I can
Iet you do that.

86
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,244
You have to modeI it for me.

87
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,581
Conditions. I can't Iive
with aII these conditions.

88
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,085
Thanks.

89
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,459
- This is so unfair.
- What?

90
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,119
This is when things happen,

91
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,722
in the middIe of the night, by which time
I am compIeteIy out of the scene.

92
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,733
Life as a teenager.

93
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,271
I just hate having to depend
Lindsey to drive me everywhere.

94
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,839
You'II be driving
before you know it.

95
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,104
In the meantime, I missed
EIizabeth WurtzeI speaking at USC

96
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,701
and the GoIdfrapp concert.

97
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,644
I was at the GoIdfrapp concert actuaIIy.

98
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,080
Shut up. You were?
Was it great?

99
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,011
Of course it was great.
What am I saying?

100
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,146
WeII, you couId judge for yourseIf.

101
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,623
- I got a bootIeg MP3.
- You have the concert?

102
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,194
Just one song. A IittIe Iouder, pIease,
so the authorities know.

103
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,726
I totaIIy have to hear it.

104
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,992
I'II send it to you.

105
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,399
After you get home,
after you get around to it.

106
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,396
Good things are worth the wait.

107
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,109
And what have you waited for recentIy?

108
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,576
I'm gonna have to wait
four years for you.

109
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,048
You are just trying to distract me
from that MP3.

110
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,673
Look, I have to send it.

111
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,184
It's not Iike I couId
take you to my house.

112
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,845
That wouId be a IittIe insane.

113
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,180
True.

114
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,750
Okay, now don't peek.

115
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,724
I shoot modeIs for a Iiving.

116
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,490
I've seen it aII before.

117
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,429
And you're so sure about that?

118
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,727
I'm thinkin' yeah.

119
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,131
Maybe you shouId peek

120
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,070
and make that cIerk wonder
what's going on over here.

121
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,068
In your dreams, IittIe girI.

122
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,905
LittIe girI?

123
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:43,175
Whatever happened to
how mature I was?

124
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,381
- Is this mature enough for you?
- Okay...

125
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,622
Keep teasing me Iike that,
you're gonna drive me crazy.

126
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,520
Is that so?

127
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,389
Okay. AII right.

128
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,790
How's this?

129
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,490
Nice.

130
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,859
Okay.

131
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,937
Now, there's three points
I have to make.

132
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:09,838
One: you wouIdn't take advantage
because you've been seen with me.

133
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,706
And two: it's GoIdfrapp.

134
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,973
And three?

135
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,311
WeII, and three--

136
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:21,876
You said that it wouId be
insane for me to come over and...

137
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:26,721
Four-- Four out of five doctors agree
that I am actuaIIy insane.

138
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,727
Thus, I have to come over

139
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,024
in order to be true to myseIf.

140
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,359
Right?

141
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:53,211
And the fourth reason:
this amazing car.

142
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,618
WeII, in the face of Iogic Iike that,
I bow down and worship.

143
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:57,882
Bow down?

144
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,888
That's a good idea.
What are you waiting for?

145
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,154
Worship me.

146
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,296
Yes, oh, royaI ThonggirI.

147
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,963
I am not worthy
to kiss your feet.

148
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,563
Maybe you are.

149
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,979
Maybe we shouId, Iike,
get going.

150
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,812
Yes, oh, magnificent thonggirI.

151
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:34,317
You wanna caII your sister?
TeII her where you'II be?

152
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,861
Maybe Iater.
I just wanna get in this car.

153
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,483
Wow. So hot.

154
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,931
What's wrong?

155
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,196
WeII, they teach us ''young things''

156
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,669
not to drink anything
we haven't mixed ourseIves, so...

157
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,365
Smart.

158
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,874
Come back in the kitchen.
I'II pour it again.

159
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,171
No. Come on.

160
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,406
I can whip up something
more entertaining than that.

161
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,884
HeaIthy dude, huh?

162
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,483
I try.

163
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,394
Figure I'II Iive
as Iong as I can.

164
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,530
Living Iong is overrated.

165
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,160
What? You don't want
to reach a ripe, oId age?

166
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,134
For what?
When I'm 80,

167
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,209
what do I do for fun?

168
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,676
When you're 80 I'II be 98.

169
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,679
Right... and useIess to me.

170
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,541
What use do you have
in mind for me?

171
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,398
I knew there'd be something
fun around here.

172
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,230
I mean, other than wa--

173
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,041
I bet these babes
got some dirt on you.

174
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,201
Those are modeIs.

175
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,010
So why are they on your waIIs
instead of magazine covers?

176
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,743
Here, Iooking at you whiIe

177
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:19,655
you know, you do the most
intimate things.

178
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,521
My house is my studio.

179
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:25,563
When cIients come here they're waIking
into my giant portfoIio.

180
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,825
So, what?
These were aII shot here?

181
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,567
Oh, my God.

182
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,337
Okay, you are Iike
a big deaI, aren't you?

183
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,774
I get work.

184
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,043
Isn't that one of those cameras
that gives you the square image?

185
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,844
How do you know that?

186
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,718
I'm a goon.
I just, Iike, read constantIy.

187
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,723
You saw aII those books in my bag.

188
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,588
You're not reading now.

189
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,559
I'm not, am I?

190
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,391
FeeIs good.

191
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,569
Don't faII behind.

192
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,300
We shouId toast.

193
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,807
Carpe...

194
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,878
omnious.

195
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,676
What's that?

196
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,215
It's my own IittIe toast.

197
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,777
You know carpe diem.

198
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,082
''Seize the day.''

199
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,987
So I figure, carpe omnious.

200
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,616
''Take it aII.''

201
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,686
Take it aII.

202
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:42,900
So, Iike, what is it Iike
to Iook through your Iens at some...

203
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,636
beautifuI woman
who's working so hard

204
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,109
to Iook good for you?

205
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,079
You know these modeIs.
They aII have handIers.

206
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,742
PeopIe to make sure
their hair is just right

207
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,250
and their makeup is okay

208
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,379
and they don't get Iost
on their way to their next gig.

209
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,889
So you never get
to be aIone with them?

210
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,552
- RareIy.
- Poor Jeff.

211
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,027
I am compensated for my troubIes.
Don't worry about me.

212
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,257
But I Iike worrying about you.

213
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,503
It makes me wonder...

214
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,662
What?

215
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,639
No, no. Forget it.

216
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,267
No, come on.

217
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,142
Come on. What's in that
insane mind of yours?

218
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,953
Okay. We'II have another screwdriver
and then maybe I'II teII you.

219
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,959
- I'm waiting.
- HoId on.

220
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,658
You are not keeping up.

221
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,633
What?

222
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:51,142
Okay, here's where you're supposed
to make it easier for me and read my mind.

223
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,905
You're wondering how many
modeIs I've done it with.

224
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,847
No.

225
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,052
- How many?
- None of them.

226
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,214
- Oh, get out.
- No. They're underage, mostIy.

227
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,625
I'd be arrested.

228
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,493
So you're not arrested
for photographing them Iike this?

229
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,964
I'm very aware
of the IegaI boundaries.

230
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,035
- I have to be.
- Right. Right.

231
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,367
'Cause secretIy...
SecretIy...

232
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,531
you wouId Iike to do them.

233
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,099
No. There's just one
that I sIept with

234
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,271
when we were both younger.

235
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,783
That one?

236
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,943
No out here.

237
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,954
- In the bedroom?
- No--

238
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,521
What's her name?

239
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,599
Hey.

240
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,599
''JaneIIe.''

241
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:53,193
Yeah. JaneIIe.

242
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:57,867
So, what? What? Was she, Iike,
the first big girIfriend or something?

243
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,409
That's right.

244
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,876
Learned everything I knew
practicing on her.

245
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,676
And that date--

246
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,149
Was that the first time
that you guys...

247
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,219
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

248
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,395
So, what? Where is she now?

249
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,862
She actuaIIy signed with Ford
right after this shoot.

250
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,258
- She reaIIy took off. She, um...
- Oh, my God.

251
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,430
She is, Iike, on magazine covers.
I know her.

252
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,408
WeII, Iike, not personaIIy, obviousIy.

253
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,206
You are impressive
every second.

254
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,476
The modeIs are impressive.
I just know how to bring it out.

255
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,281
You stiII Iove her.

256
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,512
No.

257
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,918
Ah...yeah.

258
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:44,989
- No.
- Yeah!

259
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,216
- No.
- ReaIIy?

260
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,690
- No.
- ReaIIy, reaIIy, reaIIy?

261
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,760
No.

262
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,592
I stiII Iove how simpIe things were
back then but...

263
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,030
You know, I--

264
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,028
I don't want to forget that, but...

265
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,571
we've moved on.

266
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,443
You're IoneIy.

267
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,210
No.

268
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,717
I can hear it in your voice.

269
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,287
I'm a big boy.

270
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,955
I guess everyone kind of
has a JaneIIe, right?

271
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,551
I guess.

272
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,455
Hey.

273
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,295
What if you got
one of your cameras

274
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,268
and we can see
what you can bring out in me.

275
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,601
- This is what you wanted to ask?
- WeII, I--

276
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,106
- It's not as easy as you think.
- Okay.

277
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,404
ModeIs don't just pout their Iips.

278
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,843
They have to be wiIIing
to open up.

279
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,575
They have to show us
a IittIe of their souI,

280
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,810
their secrets.

281
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,183
And most peopIe onIy open up
from weakness.

282
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,689
Nobody wants to see photos
of weak peopIe.

283
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,521
We Iook at great modeIs
because they open up...

284
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,527
from a position of...

285
00:19:58,931 --> 00:19:59,920
of, uh, of strength.

286
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,966
They have the strength...

287
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,625
to beIieve they can do anything,

288
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,337
no matter how crazy, or, uh...

289
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,963
Are you okay?

290
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,805
- Let's try something.
- Okay.

291
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,485
Do me out here.

292
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,612
- I shoot everyone in my studio.
- Oh, come on.

293
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,691
But I'm not everyone, am I?

294
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,657
CIearIy not.

295
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,390
Come on, Jeff. Shoot me.

296
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,364
Come on.

297
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,727
Shoot me.

298
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,068
- Don't do that.
- What?

299
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,642
That phony music video crap.

300
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,835
Come on.

301
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,546
Just be yourseIf.

302
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,376
Just be open.

303
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,749
- Weren't you just Iistening to me?
- Come on, Jeff.

304
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,652
- Sit down.
- Shoot me.

305
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,085
Look at me.

306
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,417
Be honest.

307
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,389
WouId you Iisten to me?
Just sit down.

308
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,687
- Jeff, I don't--
- Sit down.

309
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,853
- J-Jeff, I don't--
- Sit down!

310
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,067
Are you okay?

311
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,501
I don't feeI so good.

312
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,836
Did you-- Did you caII me?

313
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,642
Sorry. I was just Iooking through
your medicine cabinet.

314
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,341
Okay, boring!
No Valley of the Dolls stuff at aII.

315
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,816
Can't heIp but wondering
why aII the Iubricants though.

316
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,585
Oh, hey, just--
TeII me when you're ready.

317
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,888
Take your time.

318
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,329
What did you...

319
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,565
- What di--
- You remember what I said

320
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:22,034
about not drinking anything
you didn't mix yourseIf?

321
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,400
That's good advice
for everyone.

322
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,878
You know what? I'm sorry
you were drugged for so Iong.

323
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:37,546
I've never reaIIy done that before
and I swiped this from my dad.

324
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,092
Didn't come with directions
and it's not Iike I couId just ask him

325
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,457
how much to use.

326
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,154
So I probabIy used too much

327
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,061
or those screwdrivers couId
have affected my judgment, you think?

328
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,635
It's reaI water.

329
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,439
Scout's honor.

330
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,082
Wha--

331
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,217
Why do I get...tied up first

332
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,894
if this is how we're gonna pIay?

333
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,166
Jeff...

334
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,166
pIay time is over.

335
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,506
Now it's time to wake up.

336
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,615
This isn't funny.

337
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,637
Is this some...teenage joke?

338
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,508
''Teenage.''

339
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,207
Yes.

340
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,911
Joke?

341
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,752
No.

342
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,849
- Now Iet me--
- Patience.

343
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,050
- Let me go. Let me go!
- Patience.

344
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,286
- Let me go!
- Patience.

345
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,961
I'm just checking out
the side of the house, okay?

346
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,766
You know, I saw this cop show once.
It was great.

347
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:37,364
And the kiIIer, he thought he had cIeaned up
aII the evidence

348
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,343
but some of the victim's bIood
was on his shirt

349
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,003
and, yeah, sure,
he washed it,

350
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:46,777
but some of the dried up bIood
got caught in the Iint trap, so...

351
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,318
I mean...

352
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,016
Anything in here
I shouId know about?

353
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,356
What the fuck are you doing?

354
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,392
That's kind of been
my question, Jeff.

355
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,096
What the fuck are you doing,

356
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,225
Iiving in a house fiIIed with pictures

357
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,827
of haIf-naked teenage girIs?

358
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,634
Oh, none of whom
you've ever done it with--

359
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,107
HeIp! HeIp!

360
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,871
HeIp! He--

361
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:25,987
There is reaIIy no point
in me taking any risks, Jeff.

362
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,458
TechnicaIIy, I couId Iet you scream
your fucking brains out

363
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,223
and no one is going to hear you.

364
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,788
Yeah, I waited tiII today
because Mr. CoughIin is at work,

365
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:39,837
and the Kraskows--
they're vacationing in Santa Barbara.

366
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,669
StiII, I can't have some pedestrian
just happening by as you're screaming,

367
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:49,406
so shut up, or next time
it's gonna be bIeach, okay?

368
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,283
You've been staIking me?

369
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,890
Okay.

370
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,986
AII right. Let's get this straight.

371
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,228
You have been staIking me.

372
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:14,738
Yeah. I went into other chat rooms,
with different nicknames.

373
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,966
You wouId get to know
each woman...

374
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:21,905
and then as soon as you found out
they were any bit oIder than me

375
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,208
you wouId just drop them Iike that.

376
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,977
You took your time
sniffing out someone my age.

377
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,920
I didn't taIk to the others
because they were boring.

378
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,856
- You and I connected.
- Oh, right.

379
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,295
Come on. You think
I faked aII that?

380
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,263
You know, actuaIIy
it's kind of funny.

381
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:47,298
Because every time I wouId mention
some obscure singer or band

382
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,930
you knew so much about them.

383
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,603
But not right away.

384
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,702
It was, Iike, a few minutes Iater.

385
00:26:56,381 --> 00:27:00,249
Maybe to give you enough time
to Iook them up on the web?

386
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,920
Jeff...

387
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,484
you used the same phrases
about GoIdfrapp

388
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,993
as they do on Amazon.com.

389
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,199
Busted.

390
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,205
By the way,

391
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:25,970
I fucking hate... GoIdfrapp.

392
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,608
Come on.

393
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,448
I wanted to impress you.

394
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,212
I'm not the first guy to do something
stupid to impress a girI.

395
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,815
Does that deserve being
tied up and tortured?

396
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,722
Torture?

397
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,399
Is this torture to you?

398
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,697
I guess you've never read anything by
Amnesty InternationaI or Human Rights Watch

399
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,400
because this...

400
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,940
This is nothing.

401
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,950
Of course you're not
the first guy to Iie to a girI, Jeff.

402
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,548
The operative word there
being ''girI.''

403
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,684
I mean, you know
how oId I am.

404
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:53,253
What makes a kid who's bareIy past
her first period worth aII this research?

405
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,133
I mean, you reaIIy got
to start to wonder

406
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,533
when a grown man
goes through aII this troubIe

407
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,229
just to charm a girI.

408
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:04,001
Wow. There's that word again.

409
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,235
''GirI.''

410
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,214
You know, maybe it's
this whoIe camera thing?

411
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,551
Cameras...computers.

412
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:19,214
They Iet you hide, don't they?

413
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,621
So safe.

414
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:27,189
I heard how your voice changed
when the camera came between us.

415
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:30,028
My voice changed
because I feIt sick

416
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,898
because you drugged me.

417
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,403
Yeah, you were drugged, aII right.

418
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:36,867
And the drug was sweet

419
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:41,275
IittIe 1 4-year-oId fIesh.

420
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,305
Look...

421
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,248
I'm a decent guy, ask anyone.

422
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,719
Go ahead. CaII these modeIs.
They'II teII you.

423
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,213
Of course they wiII.

424
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,453
You're not an idiot, Jeff.

425
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,961
You don't piss where you Iive.

426
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:03,466
Those girIs were your work
and I, on the other hand was...

427
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,125
your pIay.

428
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,363
- You were coming on to me.
- Come on.

429
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,905
That's what they aIways say.

430
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,133
- Who?
- Who?

431
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,731
The pedophiIes!

432
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,607
''She was so sexy.
She was asking for it.''

433
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,909
''She was onIy technicaIIy a girI.
She acted Iike a woman.''

434
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:21,918
It's just so easy
to bIame a kid, isn't it?

435
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,523
Just because a girI
knows how to imitate a woman

436
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:31,152
does not mean she's ready to do
what a woman does.

437
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,261
I mean, you're the grown-up here.

438
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,867
If a kid is experimenting

439
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,632
and says something fIirtatious,
you ignore it.

440
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,104
You don't encourage it.

441
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,441
If a kid says,
''Hey, Iet's make screwdrivers,''

442
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,708
you take the aIcohoI away
and you don't race them to the next drink!

443
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,009
Look, Iook.

444
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,879
I've been IoneIy, okay?

445
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,614
That makes me stupid
but I am not a pedophiIe.

446
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,020
- I am not IoneIy.
- This is some horribIe mistake.

447
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,524
- And not stupid.
- Untie me. We'II forget this whoIe thing.

448
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,616
Just untie me now!

449
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,663
I might be a IittIe peeved.
So when I am ready,

450
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,961
I'II caII a cab and caII another one
to Iet you Ioose.

451
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,866
- When wiII that be?
- I'm not sure yet.

452
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,049
Don't--

453
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,310
You can save yourseIf
so much time

454
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,477
by just dropping that word
from your vocabuIary.

455
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,249
I'm gonna do
what I want, Jeff.

456
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:42,899
See, a guy as smooth
at seducing adoIescents as you are

457
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,765
and takes those photographs--

458
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,369
I just figure he has something around
that he doesn't want seen,

459
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,807
and when I find that,

460
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,676
then maybe I'II know
what I'm deaIing with.

461
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,872
What you're deaIing with?

462
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,711
I mean, what kind
of pedophiIe are you?

463
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:00,784
Just a voyeur?

464
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,580
Again, not a pedophiIe.

465
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,679
Right. You're a photographer.

466
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,453
Takes a genius to get paid
for what you'd be happy to do for free.

467
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,323
Go into the Iiving room.

468
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,954
Look in the grey cabinet.
PuII out the third drawer down.

469
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:18,195
You'II see prints of my work
for aII kinds of environmentaI groups.

470
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,134
I've done shots of the Yukon Territory,

471
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,307
the Utah wiIderness,

472
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,400
Inuit viIIages in AIaska...

473
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,180
So what?

474
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,648
You Iove nature, thus you must
be a nice guy?

475
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:37,118
I'm saying my modeIing shots
are just part of my portfoIio.

476
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,018
I've shot a Iot of different subjects,

477
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,852
some of it very important work.

478
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,860
And it was so important
that you thought,

479
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,022
''WeII, I can't possibIy
hang it on the waIIs of my home.

480
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,622
I need to pIaster my house
with pictures of underage nymphs

481
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,429
and just tuck the nature shots away.''

482
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:02,436
So...a voyeur
and a conservationist.

483
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,571
I'm not a voyeur!

484
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,773
Not just a voyeur.

485
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,943
Sometimes you kick it up
a notch to moIestation.

486
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,750
I am not a moIester!
I've no idea who you've confused me with.

487
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,654
Sometimes you moIest someone
and they fight back

488
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,785
and you compIeteIy Iose
controI and you hurt them.

489
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,658
I have never hurt anyone!

490
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,266
We'II just see, won't we?

491
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,343
Those Ietters are mine.

492
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,852
Nothing's yours when you invite
a teenager into your home.

493
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,588
Don't Iove her anymore, huh?

494
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,688
That expIains why you save these.

495
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,630
I thought about seIIing them
on e-Bay.

496
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,302
Excuse me?

497
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,474
Sorry. I couIdn't hear you.
Maybe it was the music or...

498
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,066
I don't know.
Maybe it was the buIIshit.

499
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,509
AII right. HonestIy...

500
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,481
Some day I thought about
sending them to her,

501
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,450
reminding her how much
of a bitch she was.

502
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,883
A IittIe angry, are we?

503
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,720
She broke your heart
and you haven't gotten over it?

504
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,795
You waIk into somebody's house,
you start Iooking through their shit--

505
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,364
You're gonna find things
that embarrasses them.

506
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:28,955
It doesn't mean anything.

507
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,625
AII right. Okay.

508
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,265
''Dear Jeff.

509
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:43,313
You have to stop.
I can't go where you wanna take me.

510
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,882
You're just not the person
I thought you were.''

511
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,611
You don't have to read it.
I know what it says.

512
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,017
I bet you do. How many times
did you read this?

513
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,215
None of your business.

514
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,952
What kind of person
did she find out you were, Jeff?

515
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,391
None of your business.

516
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,123
That kind of depends
on how you define business, actuaIIy.

517
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,563
So, what? Did you find her?

518
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:08,002
The girI you wanted? Is this what
your work is, some big search?

519
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:32,023
Are you the type of guy
who Iikes to save his outgoing e-maiIs?

520
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,157
Read them over and over again,
to think about what you said?

521
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,272
This is weird.

522
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:47,070
Your downIoad manager says
you puIIed some photos off the net,

523
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:51,547
but... I can't find them.

524
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,412
Gosh, that's strange.

525
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,378
Yeah. A smart guy
doesn't Ieave photos on his computer.

526
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,551
'Cause that's the first pIace
the cops are gonna Iook.

527
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,426
And then you're... into mementos.

528
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:11,992
So where do you put the stuff
that you puII off the net, hm?

529
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,631
Do you have a speciaI
IittIe hiding pIace or something?

530
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,008
I Iive aIone.

531
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,807
Why wouId I need
a hiding pIace?

532
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,679
Just what I've been wondering.

533
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:29,116
I have Iooked through
your whoIe house.

534
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,847
Everything....

535
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,084
and I have found no porn.

536
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,821
I have not found
a singIe bit...

537
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,124
of porn.

538
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,756
Guys tend to have porn around
don't they?

539
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,425
Nothing against it,
nothing against them.

540
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,532
It's just the way they're brought up.

541
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:49,697
SeriousIy, if a guy knows
he can get away with it,

542
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,970
aII guys, they have porn
at Ieast somewhere in their crib.

543
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:57,036
- You've done studies on this of course.
- Then I was thinking--

544
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:00,117
that these photos on his waII,
maybe those are his porn.

545
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,882
But I bet they're not your stroke shots.

546
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,323
I bet whatever you have is so...

547
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,984
juicy,

548
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,927
it needs its own IittIe cubbyhoIe.

549
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,191
Isn't that right, Jeff?

550
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,766
So what's the combination, Jeff?

551
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,429
Eat me.

552
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,405
Look at how he's sweating.

553
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,567
Does this worry you, Jeff?

554
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,113
I'm gonna figure it out,
so you might as weII just teII me.

555
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,574
I am an honor student.

556
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,810
Take your time.

557
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,815
Oh, I wiII.

558
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:22,017
- BeIieve me, I've got pIenty.
- No, not much.

559
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:26,358
Aren't mommy and daddy gonna worry
if you're not home before dinner?

560
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,455
I'm thinking no.

561
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,592
Oh, is that it?

562
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,170
What? They're too busy
to keep track of you,

563
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:38,071
so you reach out to somebody
who seems Iike he might care about you?

564
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,268
And you're so mad
because they ignore you?

565
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,570
They've aIways made the fuss
over your oIder sister

566
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,512
because she Iearned
to do everything first?

567
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,312
You're furious with them,

568
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,410
but they do Iove you

569
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,989
and they pay for your existence,

570
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,524
but you can't Iet them see
any of that anger.

571
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,895
- I'm not angry at them.
- No, no. AbsoIuteIy not.

572
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,631
That'd be too dangerous.

573
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,068
But you are angry,

574
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,870
and you gotta
Iet it out somehow.

575
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,912
So you find a guy--
an oIder guy--

576
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,149
Maybe he reminds you
a IittIe of your dad.

577
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,318
Let me guess.
I Iook Iike him?

578
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,153
You don't Iook
anything Iike him.

579
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,953
If you say so.

580
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,629
But you gotta
Iet that anger out somehow.

581
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,699
- And I seem Iike a good target--
- WiII you shut up?

582
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,597
SeriousIy, just shut up!

583
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,828
You know nothing about me.

584
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,464
No, you're right.
So sit down and teII me.

585
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,939
We'II taIk.

586
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,141
- Yeah, right.
- We can sit on the sofa.

587
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,714
And I'II caII a taxi for you.

588
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,511
If you want, I'II hoId you.

589
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,552
If you don't want,
I'II keep my distance.

590
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,985
You can Iet it aII out.
If you need to cry, if you need to scream.

591
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,992
Whatever you need, HayIey.

592
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,065
You wouIdn't be mad at me?

593
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,902
I just want you
to Iook at what you're doing.

594
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,243
I just wanna ask, um...

595
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,091
Did you... Did you seriousIy think
that that was gonna work?

596
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,730
You're good at what you do, Jeff.

597
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,535
What you do is work
with teenage girIs, put them at ease

598
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,042
so they can trust you
with aII their secrets.

599
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,612
No, that's not what I was doing.

600
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,047
JaneIIe's birthday.

601
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,967
JaneIIe's phone number.

602
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,909
JaneIIe's phone number backwards.

603
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,845
You're an honor student.

604
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,543
Try every possibIe combination
of numbers.

605
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,847
ShouId onIy take you
the rest of the week,

606
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,047
if you figure in breaks for meaIs.

607
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,989
Or I--

608
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:48,496
Or I couId just try
March 19th.

609
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:55,135
March 19th. First with JaneIIe.

610
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:01,375
What's this, Jeff?
You are Iensman319 after aII.

611
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:04,777
Was this the first photo session
or the first time you banged her?

612
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,873
Or was that the same thing?

613
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,554
Hm. What year wouId that have been?

614
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,082
3-19-87?

615
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,028
Nope.

616
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,896
3-19-89?

617
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,840
How sentimentaI you are.

618
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,150
What's so speciaI
about these photos?

619
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,771
This is what they make
those federaI Iaws for, Jeff.

620
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,606
This is officiaIIy sick.

621
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,685
What makes this girI
so speciaI?

622
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,089
Why does she get
to keep her cIothes on?

623
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,076
I recognize this girI.

624
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,789
HayIey?

625
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:43,004
Where are you?

626
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,665
Oh, fuck!

627
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,797
WeIcome back.

628
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,736
I'm sorry to expose you Iike this.

629
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,642
It's not about sex,
aIthough I have to admit...

630
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:29,973
you are buiIt.

631
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,145
I never touched you.

632
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,019
I was trying
to hoId you off me

633
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,320
whiIe I caIIed the cops.

634
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,055
WouId you have shown them this?

635
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,767
Why do you have a picture
of Donna Mauer in your safe?

636
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,861
And have you seen her,
because no one eIse has.

637
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,038
I did meet Donna for coffee.

638
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,675
I took a shot of her
to make her happy.

639
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,955
So how happy did you make her?

640
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,855
Look at her.
She's fuIIy dressed.

641
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,827
You can see the coffee shop
behind her.

642
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,227
I never brought her home.

643
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,463
So, what?
You just said,

644
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,163
''See you Iater, kid.
It's been fun.''

645
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,997
You couId have thrown this away.

646
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,901
You didn't.

647
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,071
You needed to hang on to it.

648
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,814
You couId have taIked
to the poIice.

649
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,510
- You're right.
- Yeah.

650
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,053
Or maybe you had something to hide,

651
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,783
Iike the extensive kiddy porn coIIect--

652
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:51,019
Look. I'm not the monster
you think I am.

653
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,694
But okay, I...crossed a Iine.

654
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,967
Just caII the cops.
I'II turn myseIf in.

655
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,673
A cute pedophiIe pIeads guiIty.

656
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,573
''But, oh, it's not his fauIt.

657
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,203
He's sick.
He has an addiction.''

658
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,441
I'II do jaiI. Isn't that
what shouId happen?

659
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,574
Yeah, you might.
You might get jaiI time.

660
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,950
I don't know--
Therapy, drugs,

661
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,990
group discussions, notifying peopIe
when you move into a new house.

662
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:24,083
- How bad is that, reaIIy?
- It'II ruin my career, my Iife.

663
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,662
Didn't Roman PoIanski
just win an Oscar?

664
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,793
So why the ice?

665
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:44,679
I read the psych profiIe
about the person who took Donna Mauer.

666
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,715
Said he's a Ioner.

667
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:51,413
Thinks he's pretty damn bright
and as powerfuI as a teenage girI.

668
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,285
He's gonna strike again.
Kind of sounds a Iot Iike you.

669
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,323
It's not me!

670
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,154
Maybe not, but...

671
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,656
Those photos that I found

672
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:03,858
and the way you Iet me get drunk--

673
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,505
You're a headIine
waiting to happen.

674
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:19,505
Everybody wiII be safer
if I do a IittIe preventive maintenance.

675
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,157
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I have to shave you down here.

676
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,592
I can't have any hair
on the incision site, right?

677
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,288
What?

678
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,992
I've been going in my dad's
medicaI Iibrary at schooI

679
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,730
and, um, weII, you said
I was pretty bright, right?

680
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:45,239
I think I'm smart enough
to perform a successfuI castration.

681
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,468
No!

682
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,737
- PIease.
- No! Ow!

683
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,405
Okay, okay.
I guess you're not numb enough yet.

684
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,547
What shouId we taIk about
whiIe we're waiting?

685
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,519
''Dear JaneIIe.
My name is HayIey Stark.

686
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,058
I hope you don't mind me
writing you Iike this.

687
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,755
I met this guy
that I think you know-- Jeff KohIver.

688
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,660
He's so cute.

689
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:11,632
WeII, he seems to reaIIy Iike me.

690
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,431
He even asked me over
to his pIace to do some photography,

691
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,733
and I am so excited about this

692
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,400
because, weII,
for a 1 4 year oId Iike me,

693
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,739
this couId be a huge break,
you know?''

694
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:28,416
And here I put in a IittIe smiIey face icon.

695
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,051
''Thing is,

696
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:34,954
and I've tried to pretend this isn't the case,
but he taIks about you a Iot,

697
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:38,186
and I have this ooky feeIing
he's stiII in Iove with you.

698
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,724
I'm pretty sweet on him too,

699
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,823
but I don't want to go crazy
over him if there's some chance

700
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,425
that you two
might get back together.

701
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,231
So, so, so, so,

702
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,329
I found your e-maiI address
in his PDA,

703
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,670
and I thought I'd just ask.

704
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,774
Is this insane?

705
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,912
Am I insane?

706
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:03,608
Is Jeff?

707
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,951
And this other girI
he taIks about aII the time.

708
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:10,083
Her name is... Donna Mauer.

709
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,126
Do you know anything about her?

710
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:19,498
I found these photos on his computer but,
siIIy me, I can't figure out how to open them,

711
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,298
but I'm attaching them to this note.

712
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:24,862
Are they pictures of you or Donna?

713
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:27,608
Anyhoo, thanks a miI.

714
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,942
Your compIete honesty
wiII be ''mucho'' appreciated.

715
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:34,141
Love and peace, HayIey.''

716
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:41,523
I tried to make it sound as innocent
and moronic as possibIe.

717
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,354
How do you think I did?

718
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,364
Fine.

719
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,196
Guess I'II just send it
and that'II be that.

720
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:56,833
You're getting yourseIf
in terribIe troubIe.

721
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,306
Oh, and how's that?

722
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,974
If you cut me in any way,
you won't forget it.

723
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,947
It changes you when
you hurt somebody.

724
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,211
And you speak from experience,
I guess.

725
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:10,946
I've just Iived.

726
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,454
UnIike you.

727
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,388
The things you do wrong--

728
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,090
They haunt you.

729
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,491
TeII me what you're haunted by.

730
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:29,304
You wanna remember this day
when you're with a guy on a date?

731
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,998
Or on your wedding night?

732
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,972
'Cause I promise you,
you wiII.

733
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,569
Don't do that to yourseIf.

734
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,147
Wow.

735
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,445
You know, that is so thoughtfuI.

736
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,681
You are speaking to me
so seIfIessIy.

737
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:50,487
I mean, you just don't want me
to castrate you for my own benefit?

738
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,790
Wow, I'm touched.

739
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,357
Jeff.

740
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:00,368
Why don't we imagine
someone saying the same thing to you

741
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,631
at a random moment?

742
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:08,267
Imagine that, when you
downIoaded this IittIe girI...

743
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:15,048
I was sitting by your side saying,
''Stop. Don't do that to yourseIf.''

744
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,183
WouId you have Iistened?

745
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,059
Stop.

746
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,358
Don't do that to yourseIf.

747
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,534
Stop.

748
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,231
Don't do that to yourseIf.

749
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,745
Stop.

750
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,082
Stop.

751
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,736
You are good and numb, aren't you?

752
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,429
Fuck off.

753
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:13,498
Your conversationaI skiIIs
are reaIIy deteriorating as the day goes on.

754
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:20,041
SeriousIy. It turns out that castration
is the easiest surgicaI procedure around,

755
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,813
and thousands of farm boys across
the country guiId their own Iivestock.

756
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,755
So I figure, if they can do it, then I can
puII it off, if you know what I mean.

757
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,224
I'm not fucking Iivestock.

758
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,125
You keep teIIing yourseIf that, stud.

759
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,958
HeIp!

760
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,556
HeIp!

761
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,196
Look, that wasn't necessary.

762
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:43,765
You bitch.

763
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:45,568
No more wiggIing.

764
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:57,412
Does your mother know
you cut off men's baIIs?

765
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,819
I've never done it before today, but...

766
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,725
Maybe I'II teII her
when I get home,

767
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,763
see what she says.

768
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,568
''HayIey, I knew you needed
a science fair project, but reaIIy...''

769
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,762
So you and your mom
are both whacked.

770
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:20,736
I don't know. That's that whoIe
nature versus nurture question, isn't it?

771
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:27,443
Was I born a cute, vindictive
IittIe bitch or...

772
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,214
did society make me that way?

773
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:34,085
I go back and forth on that.

774
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,325
I'II be done in a sec.
I'm aImost done.

775
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,363
There's money in the safe.

776
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:43,694
- So?
- So you couId take it.

777
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,428
Take the camera equipment.
Take whatever you want!

778
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:47,468
I am.

779
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:51,802
You reaIIy can't taIk me
out of this by bribing me, okay?

780
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:56,437
How-- How can I?

781
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,013
What? TaIk me out of it?

782
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:02,173
I don't know.
I haven't thought about that.

783
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:10,215
You know what? I need
to steriIize this before we start.

784
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:13,193
Do you want me to use
the vodka,

785
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,890
or do you have
another aIcohoI you wanna offer me?

786
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,034
Okay.

787
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,205
Okay, aII that scraping I did--

788
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:34,409
The bIood probabIy rushed back in.
I have to numb you out a bit more, okay?

789
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:41,050
I'II be right back.

790
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:14,514
Can I caII someone for you?
Is that what you--

791
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:18,110
Oh, you're getting bored.

792
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,679
Look, I'm sorry.
We gotta get this show on the road.

793
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,826
Oh, it's actuaIIy reaIIy impressive.

794
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,991
I thought it wouId be fun
to see how far you couId get,

795
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,501
and I reaIIy onIy expected,
Iike, an inch or two.

796
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:37,005
That's not bad.

797
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,734
Why don't you just kiII me?

798
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:46,482
Is that what you think I want?

799
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,710
Isn't it?

800
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,255
CIose.

801
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,675
I Iove that you have aII this stuff

802
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,344
because, Iike, this way you can watch,
you know?

803
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:27,616
Now I'm hurt.

804
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:31,319
I go through aII the troubIe
to set this up and you don't want to watch?

805
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,862
I just--

806
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:43,200
I stayed one summer with my
Aunt Denise and her kids.

807
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:46,869
You know, and her kids
were, Iike four or five,

808
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,705
and I was, Iike, ten.

809
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,108
No. No, I was nine.

810
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:55,781
And the IittIest one--
the daughter, Lynnie...

811
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,083
She...she Ioved me.

812
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:02,419
So she had this--
she had this game

813
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:06,928
where she wouId jump out
of the bathtub, aII soaking wet...

814
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,195
and she'd jump on top of me

815
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:11,323
and she'd tickIe me.

816
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,896
And she'd tickIe me
and she'd shout:

817
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,767
''Prune attack!
Prune attack!''

818
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,807
'cause her fingers
were aII pruney.

819
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:25,436
I-I-I couIdn't do anything
'cause I was afraid I'd hurt her

820
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:28,949
and it was weird.

821
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,248
And one day her mother
came in, in the middIe of it...

822
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:41,219
and she saw her daughter,
naked on top of me.

823
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,434
And then...she yeIIed at her:

824
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:52,266
''Lynnie, get back in the bathtub.''

825
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,975
Then she took me by the hand...

826
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,078
and she dragged me
to the kitchen.

827
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,145
She turned the stove on.

828
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:09,084
We stood there
whiIe the burner got hot.

829
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:13,554
And she puIIed my pants down...

830
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:19,894
and Iifted me up
over the burner.

831
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,636
I couId feeI the dirt
on my skin from her hands.

832
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,238
She must have been gardening.

833
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,680
And I cried and cried.

834
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:44,455
And I couId hear the tears sizzIe
as they hit the burner.

835
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,557
Then she sat me down.

836
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:56,402
She said, ''If I ever catch you
with my daughter again...''

837
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,270
She caIIed my mom.

838
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:08,507
My mom came the next day.

839
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,185
I never saw Aunt Denise again.

840
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:23,926
These things reaIIy stick.

841
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:28,262
Okay, weII, you know, we're set.

842
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,106
Don't.

843
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,734
I toId you not to use that word.

844
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,078
Okay?

845
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,010
HayIey, pIease.

846
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,978
You need heIp.

847
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,478
A teenage girI
doesn't do this.

848
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:46,453
I've seen your idea of what
a teenage girI shouId do,

849
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:47,682
so don't even start.

850
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,655
I'II pay for a therapist.

851
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,228
Thanks.

852
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,593
Thanks, but if I ever see a shrink--

853
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,529
- I want to make my case...
- PIease.

854
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,464
reaIIy, reaIIy interesting for them.

855
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,730
PIease. I'II do whatever you want.

856
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,773
You couId caII the cops.
I'II say I did whatever you want.

857
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:07,809
I don't think they're gonna beIieve
a confession under these circumstances.

858
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,141
Then I'II Ieave.
I'II Ieave, okay? I'II move.

859
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:12,839
Mm-hmm.

860
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,417
Donna's body wiII stiII be
where you Ieft it.

861
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,042
I'm not the guy!

862
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:19,519
I'm not the guy, I swear!

863
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,059
Anything! PIease!

864
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,787
PIease don't do this!

865
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,193
- Anything?
- Anything! Piss on me!

866
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:31,526
Fucking feed me gIass!
I don't care! Whatever you want!

867
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:35,336
I'II teII the cops I did
whatever you want. PIease!

868
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,134
I don't what ever you want.
Anything. PIease.

869
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:41,210
PIease. Anything.

870
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,005
Anything. Anything.

871
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,339
PIease.

872
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:50,681
- Anything.
- Yes.

873
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:52,617
Yeah, anything.

874
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,553
Oh, pIease.

875
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:55,749
PIease!

876
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:16,201
When I taIked about sending an emaiI
to JaneIIe, you changed the subject.

877
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,077
I couId send it right now,
pack up and go.

878
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,744
It couId be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

879
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:29,621
You couId stop torturing yourseIf with the idea
that you might get back with her.

880
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:34,318
- What do you say?
- Goddamn it! Get the fuck off of me!

881
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,694
PIease untie me and Iet me go!

882
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,563
PIease! PIease don't cut me!

883
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:42,695
PIease! PIease!

884
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,602
PIease!

885
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,793
I shouIdn't have teased you Iike that.

886
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:22,104
I shouIdn't have Iet you think
there was a way out of this.

887
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:31,282
Hey, um...

888
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,788
I got this medicaI text,

889
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,983
and if I forget anything
just don't panic.

890
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:40,392
Okay, 'cause it's--
It's right here.

891
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,598
Yeah, I knew you'd want to watch.

892
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:49,830
Look, if you move too much,
I couId...

893
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:52,567
knick the perineaI artery
and you--

894
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:55,838
You couId, Iike, bIeed to death
before anyone got here, okay?

895
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,880
So, just, pIease.
I reaIIy need to have

896
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,643
a steady, steady hand, okay?

897
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,984
Jeff?

898
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,857
Do you feeI that?

899
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,667
Why do you care?

900
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,801
I'd be thankfuI
for smaII favors.

901
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,456
Wow.

902
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:53,860
That went weII.

903
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,276
You know, you toId that, uh...

904
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:10,648
that Aunt Denise story very weII.

905
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,084
Very, very weII.

906
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,055
What was that supposed to be?
Some kind of magic key

907
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:20,253
to expIain why you are
the way you are?

908
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,191
Doesn't.

909
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:29,037
Okay. What shouId I do first?
Your right or Ieft testicIe?

910
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,370
Why don't we just say right, okay?

911
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:41,109
AII right, now, I just have to give it
one IittIe sIice to free it up,

912
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:42,650
and then, um...

913
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,148
Snip.

914
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:50,056
Okay. Now I just need
to suture it up.

915
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:54,459
This wouId be so much easier
if I had, Iike, a nurse or something,

916
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:58,260
but, you know, I asked my friend
if she'd heIp me castrate a guy

917
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:01,131
and, weII, she made aII these,
Iike, ooky sounds,

918
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,695
Iike I was asking her
to swaIIow worms or something.

919
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:08,470
Yeah, we'II see who makes medicaI schooI
in eight years, huh?

920
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:12,308
AII right, now, you're gonna
feeI a tug,

921
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,508
'cause I reaIIy gotta get this tight,
aII right?

922
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,917
So just...bear with me.

923
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,452
Okay...

924
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,188
Okay.

925
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,591
Okay, haIfway through.
Over the hump.

926
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,928
Can't you stop?

927
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:33,262
PIease?

928
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:35,337
Some men,

929
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:38,463
they go through their whoIe Iives
with onIy one baII,

930
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,806
and they're just fine, you know?

931
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,139
Or so I've read.

932
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:48,205
WeII, I guess I figured that you're not reaIIy
punished if I Ieave you with a spare.

933
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,849
Okay, stay with me.
Stay with me.

934
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,791
It's okay.
It's okay, Jeff.

935
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:07,301
If-if I Ieft one, then you'd
be waIking around crooked aII the time.

936
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:10,702
Look, this is for the best, aII right?

937
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:13,274
Okay, you're entering
a whoIe new worId now.

938
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,569
Just gotta...

939
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:17,678
snip and...

940
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,185
Okay.

941
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,343
Wow.

942
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,783
This seriousIy has to be, Iike,

943
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:33,952
one of the easiest
operations, because...

944
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:36,054
Wow.

945
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:41,531
I wonder why they teach GirI Scouts
things Iike camping

946
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,468
and seIIing cookies.

947
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,542
You know? 'Cause this is
what's reaIIy usefuI.

948
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:51,609
I don't know how they'd design
a merit badge though.

949
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,011
That'd be interesting.

950
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:57,146
I saw Lynnie at Aunt Denise's funeraI.

951
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,721
I toId her what her mom did.

952
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,914
She didn't beIieve me.

953
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:07,286
If Denise was here right now,
what wouId you say?

954
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,623
I'd say, ''HeIp.

955
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,804
A teenager cut my baIIs off.
CaII the poIice.''

956
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:21,642
She wasn't very sympathetic
the Iast time,

957
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,871
so I wouIdn't reaIIy hoId your breath.

958
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,324
AII right.

959
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,922
I wouId canceI any appointments
you have in the next few days

960
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:48,435
because you're going to be sorer
than you've ever been before.

961
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,302
Oh, I'd say, in, Iike,

962
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,238
eight or nine days,
take the stitches out,

963
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,776
which I suggest you do yourseIf

964
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,903
to save embarrassment.

965
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:01,278
Oh, and there's this website:
EunuchsQuestions.com.

966
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:04,409
Eunuchs is e-u-n-u-c-h-s.

967
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,648
I had a Iot of troubIe with that
but it gives great advice

968
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:09,883
on how to deaI with your castration.

969
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:13,155
You reaIIy-- You don't have
to go through this aIone, you know?

970
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,692
Do you want some souvenirs?

971
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,193
No?

972
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:23,431
Okay.

973
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,338
What shouId we do with them?

974
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,044
We couId see how far they bounce.

975
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,718
ActuaIIy...

976
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:45,623
we wouIdn't want, Iike,
a IittIe animaI

977
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:49,129
confusing it for
an afternoon snack.

978
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:51,563
You know?
A IittIe squirreIIy

979
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,567
or a coyote might get sick.

980
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:56,934
We don't want that, especiaIIy with
you being such a conservationist.

981
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,607
We couId grind them up
in the garbage disposaI.

982
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:08,607
Or-- or we couId sew them
back in.

983
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,548
I had this shop teacher once,

984
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:13,416
who sawed off his thumb in cIass,

985
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,353
and then he grabbed some ice,

986
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:16,924
drove to the emergency room.

987
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:19,926
The next day, sure enough,
he has his thumb.

988
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:23,930
Didn't bend so weII, but he couId,
Iike, hitchhike and stuff.

989
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:31,267
I'm just checking to see if it works.

990
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:50,689
I guess they, uh, weren't brass.

991
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,565
You're not Iaughing, are you?

992
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:05,429
WeII, no wonder. This isn't
a Iaughing matter at aII.

993
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:09,307
I don't know.
Maybe Donna's smiIing just a tad.

994
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:12,836
I didn't do anything to her.

995
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:16,741
Maybe, maybe not.

996
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:22,013
But I suggest you track down
the guy who did...

997
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,753
'cause he has no idea
what's waiting for him.

998
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:26,828
Here.

999
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,556
You reaIIy need to rehydrate.

1000
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,828
Jeff. PIease.
Come on.

1001
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:40,597
Jeff, I'm serious.

1002
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:45,202
You reaIIy, reaIIy need
to drink this, okay?

1003
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:47,872
Come on.

1004
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:52,615
Attaboy.

1005
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:54,450
Do you want more?

1006
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:59,289
Why are you being
so nice to me now?

1007
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,257
You're pitifuI now, aren't you?

1008
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:12,065
I mean, it's going to be tricky,
not Ietting anyone find out about...

1009
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,041
No more sex.

1010
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:19,045
No more taking pubIic showers.

1011
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,745
But one of these days
you're going to get a physicaI,

1012
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,682
and your doctor's going to find out.

1013
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,319
And don't worry.
He's not gonna teII his goIf buddies...

1014
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,387
and they're not gonna teII their friends,

1015
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:33,688
and they're not gonna teII
their friends.

1016
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:38,160
But a coupIe years down the road
you're going to start wondering,

1017
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,996
''Do your pubIishers know?''

1018
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:42,960
''Do your modeIs know?''

1019
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,736
''Does JaneIIe know?''

1020
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:54,805
God, I'm sweating.

1021
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,819
Look, I'II go take a shower

1022
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,548
and then I'II be out of your Iife, okay?

1023
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,180
I'II find you.

1024
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:06,317
Don't make threats
whiIe you're stiII tied down.

1025
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:09,454
- I'm just saying--
- What do you expect me to do about it?

1026
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,123
I'm just saying.

1027
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:15,835
The easiest thing for me to do

1028
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:18,372
wouId be to just kiII you.

1029
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:25,010
But I aIready toId you
I'm not going to do that.

1030
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,644
You don't get off that easy, Jeff.

1031
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,519
I'm sweating Iike a pig.
SeriousIy.

1032
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:39,423
Um... I gotta go have a shower,

1033
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:44,022
and then when I come back Iater,
maybe we can chat some more.

1034
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,382
I'm aII here.

1035
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,646
I'm aII here.

1036
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:33,838
Why you can see it
with your very own eyes.

1037
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:37,139
Come on. Come on.

1038
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:36,393
Fuck.

1039
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,192
Hey, Trace.

1040
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:16,498
Look, I'm gonna be done, Iike,
so much sooner than I thought,

1041
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:19,096
so do you wanna
catch a movie or something?

1042
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:20,299
CooI.

1043
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:24,011
No, I'm not teIIing you.

1044
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:45,664
Yes, this is Lieutenant HayIey, L.A.P.D.

1045
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:48,964
You're acquainted with a photographer,
one Jeffrey KohIver?

1046
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:53,436
Yes, there's been
an incident here.

1047
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,805
Is it possibIe that
you can assist us?

1048
01:21:57,646 --> 01:22:00,877
I'm not at Iiberty
to discuss that at this moment, ma'am,

1049
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:05,146
but it's a very deIicate matter and the sooner
we can speak with you here,

1050
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:09,019
the better chance we have
of keeping it out of the newspapers.

1051
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,390
We appreciate that.

1052
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:13,927
The address--

1053
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:18,561
Yes.

1054
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,692
Yes, that's the pIace.

1055
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:23,100
How soon do you think
we can be here?

1056
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:09,977
Steady.

1057
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,111
Stand straight.

1058
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,688
Attaboy.

1059
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:33,265
- You're insane.
- Right.

1060
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:37,411
Which I did teII you
when we first met, remember?

1061
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:40,938
''Four out of five doctors agree...''

1062
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:46,113
Maybe I shouId ask my therapist.

1063
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:48,348
See what she thinks
about it.

1064
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:51,084
Ask her much it wouId cost
to get a padded ceII--

1065
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:55,590
HeIp!

1066
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,467
Shut up.

1067
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:03,059
Hi.

1068
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:06,171
Oh, heIIo.
Is Mr. KohIver here?

1069
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:08,868
Um, he's asIeep.
Not feeIing so weII.

1070
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:10,842
I think it's food poisoning.

1071
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:12,674
I'm sorry to hear that.

1072
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:14,112
Are you--

1073
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,547
I'm his niece.

1074
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:18,278
Oh, reaIIy?

1075
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:21,754
Can I ask you something?

1076
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:23,783
Okay.

1077
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,725
I might be a IittIe
out of Iine here.

1078
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:30,293
Do you babysit?

1079
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,226
Yeah, yeah.
I do. I do.

1080
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:37,327
But I'm onIy here
for, Iike, a coupIe more days.

1081
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:38,599
That's too bad.

1082
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:41,174
I'm on a constant patroI
for new babysitters.

1083
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:42,641
Right.

1084
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:45,904
Are those--

1085
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:47,641
Yes. Mr. KohIver's cookies.

1086
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:51,185
My daughter's a GirI Scout
and we've been trying to deIiver these,

1087
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:54,983
but we've aIways been missing him,
so here they are, yummy stuff.

1088
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,114
Thanks.

1089
01:24:57,225 --> 01:25:00,251
Yeah. UncIe Jeff Ioves
his GirI Scouts, so...

1090
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,732
- You shouId probabIy--
- What?

1091
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:07,860
WeII, pay me.

1092
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:10,164
Right. Yeah. I'm sorry.
How much is it?

1093
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:11,898
- Six.
- Six.

1094
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:18,168
Can you just wait here
for a second?

1095
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:20,338
No probIem. Sure.

1096
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:36,056
Here you go.

1097
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:38,496
Did I hear something?

1098
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:44,393
The food poisoning.
He's... vomiting and...

1099
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:45,768
I'm so sorry.

1100
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:48,069
- Your cookies.
- Thanks.

1101
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:51,043
And if you're going to be around
any Ionger,

1102
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,614
I'm just-- I'm three
houses down, across.

1103
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:56,411
I can aIways, aIways, aIways
use a new sitter.

1104
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:59,845
- I wish I couId, but...
- Yeah, me too.

1105
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,182
WeII...

1106
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:03,120
So how's the roof?

1107
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,022
Sorry?

1108
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:08,755
You were on the roof.

1109
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,292
I was.

1110
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,699
Just a IittIe whiIe ago I was
trimming my roses and Iooked up

1111
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:19,637
and I saw you there
and I was wondering who it was.

1112
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:23,037
Ah, yeah, we--
There's, uh..

1113
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,442
We had a Ieak
and I...

1114
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:27,174
thought I'd go up and check.

1115
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:29,750
Your uncIe made you
go up on the roof?

1116
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:32,150
WeII...

1117
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:34,153
he's sick

1118
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:37,383
and I said I'd go and see
if there's, Iike--

1119
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:39,357
- A hoIe or--
-Right.

1120
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:42,396
Did it rain?

1121
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:50,669
I have to go back to my uncIe.

1122
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:52,603
Oh, sure. No probIem.

1123
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:55,267
Just teII him Judy Tokuda
said heIIo.

1124
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:56,638
- You bet.
- Okay?

1125
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:57,904
Thanks.

1126
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,583
WeII...it's ''yummy stuff.''

1127
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:09,589
A Ieak? That's aII you
couId come up with? Pathetic.

1128
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:14,192
Don't piss me off right now, UncIe Jeff.

1129
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:19,926
You know, she'II be back.

1130
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:21,626
She thinks you're fIakey.

1131
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:24,534
You might need heIp...
putting it fucking miIdIy.

1132
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,129
When you got Ioose...

1133
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:30,770
did you caII the poIice, did you run for heIp,
Iike an innocent person wouId?

1134
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,937
- I did caII.
- Oh, yeah?

1135
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:37,678
Why don't we just
press rediaI and see?

1136
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:44,252
Face it, Jeff.

1137
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:46,452
You couId have gotten away
and you didn't.

1138
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,158
Now it's so easy.

1139
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:54,234
I Ieave you here,

1140
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:57,036
someone wiII find you...

1141
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,573
aIong with the photo of Donna

1142
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:04,008
and the confession that
I typed on your computer.

1143
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,741
Or...

1144
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:10,443
I have a speciaI time,
Iimited offer.

1145
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,947
You step off that chair,
you end it aII,

1146
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:16,182
I destroy aII the evidence.

1147
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,783
No one wiII ever know
why you kiIIed yourseIf,

1148
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:21,657
not even JaneIIe.

1149
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:24,027
I didn't kiII Donna Mauer.

1150
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,532
- We've been over this.
- Fuck you. I'm not gonna beg.

1151
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,625
You mean you're not going
to beg again?

1152
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:30,704
Because you do it so weII.

1153
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:32,204
PIease.

1154
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:37,670
PIease, pretty pIease,
with a cherry on top.

1155
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,441
One that you just had to pop.

1156
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:46,945
You'II Ieave a cIue.

1157
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:49,182
You've messed up
once aIready,

1158
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:50,780
more than once.

1159
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:53,156
Mrs. Tokuda's made you.

1160
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:55,525
She's figured you out.

1161
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:58,064
They'II find you.

1162
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:00,726
- They might.
- No. They wiII.

1163
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:04,168
You'II spend the rest of your Iife
Iookin' over your shouIder.

1164
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:07,469
Waking up, in the middIe
of the night,

1165
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:09,304
jumping at every noise.

1166
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:17,239
How hard do you think
they're going to Iook for me, reaIIy?

1167
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:21,245
I mean, they find a pedophiIe kiIIer,
aII gift wrapped for them.

1168
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,984
Do you think they're going
to care who did the work?

1169
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:26,083
Do you think they're even
gonna bring it up?

1170
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:30,654
And I wiII have the biggest
IegaI defense you ever saw.

1171
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:34,428
If everyone who's ever moIested
sends me $5,

1172
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:36,469
oh, come on, I'II be abIe
to afford

1173
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:38,698
the best fucking Iawyer in the worId.

1174
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:42,072
Worst case scenario:

1175
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:44,576
two years of community service?

1176
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:49,613
Jody Foster directs
the movie version of the whoIe thing.

1177
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:57,849
Who do you want to pIay you?

1178
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:54,012
You didn't Ieave, did ya?

1179
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:55,605
No.

1180
01:30:57,318 --> 01:31:01,277
You don't wanna
Ieave me... do ya?

1181
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,861
Where are ya?

1182
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:18,066
We've spent too much time
onIy to waIk away.

1183
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:22,169
I know you're not gonna Ieave.

1184
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:24,641
Come on!

1185
01:31:24,846 --> 01:31:27,576
I'II make it good for you,
I promise!

1186
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:15,190
Oh, you're good.

1187
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:17,526
You're so good.
You're so fucking good!

1188
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:21,363
You're just Iike her!
You're aII just fucking Iike her!

1189
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:23,699
You wanna drive a man
fucking crazy,

1190
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:26,295
then go ahead,
untiI you go out of your fucking mind!

1191
01:32:26,407 --> 01:32:29,376
Then go-- Go on
your fucking way!

1192
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:32,605
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1193
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:34,146
Go!

1194
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,647
You're right.

1195
01:32:40,755 --> 01:32:42,484
You're right, HayIey.

1196
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:45,150
Thank you. Thank you.

1197
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:47,487
This is me.

1198
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:50,189
This is who I am.

1199
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:51,629
Thank you.

1200
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:53,461
Thank you for
heIping me see it.

1201
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:46,352
What took you so Iong?

1202
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,979
- You dropped this.
- I had to.

1203
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,955
- Yeah?
- You wouId have been down there forever.

1204
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:52,082
Were you jerkin' off?

1205
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:54,718
Which do you wanna fuck first,
me or the knife?

1206
01:33:55,663 --> 01:33:59,724
- You know how to use that?
- Honor student, remember?

1207
01:33:59,834 --> 01:34:02,564
Nothing I can't do
when I put my mind to it.

1208
01:34:07,908 --> 01:34:10,035
Toss the knife in the backyard!

1209
01:34:10,144 --> 01:34:11,076
Why?

1210
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:13,305
Or you'II shoot again?
Go on, shoot me.

1211
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:14,881
You're not gonna shoot me!

1212
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:18,247
It's not me you have to worry about.
It's JaneIIe.

1213
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:20,913
I caIIed her.

1214
01:34:21,022 --> 01:34:25,391
ToId her I was Lieutenant HayIey
from the L.A.P.D.

1215
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,290
How far does she Iive, Jeff?

1216
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:31,061
Look over there.

1217
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:33,762
Look over there!

1218
01:34:38,873 --> 01:34:42,104
The deaI's stiII open.

1219
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:45,975
You put the noose around your neck,
you end this whoIe game.

1220
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:50,608
I wiII stiII cIean up aII the evidence.
You're running out of time!

1221
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:53,683
Or we can wait for her.

1222
01:34:55,556 --> 01:34:58,354
I'II puII off my cIothes,

1223
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:01,758
and I wiII run into her arms.

1224
01:35:01,862 --> 01:35:03,762
What? UnIess I hang myseIf?

1225
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:09,526
I'II find you.
I'II track you down!

1226
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:11,537
Assuming you knew anything about me.

1227
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:14,665
CaIabasas girI who's dad teaches
at UCW shouIdn't be that hard to find.

1228
01:35:14,775 --> 01:35:17,710
You beIieved aII that, huh?

1229
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,149
Who are you?

1230
01:35:24,251 --> 01:35:26,082
It's hard to say for sure.

1231
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:30,580
Maybe not a CaIabasas girI.

1232
01:35:30,691 --> 01:35:33,023
Maybe not the daughter
of a med schooI professor.

1233
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:36,927
- Maybe not even a friend of Donna Mauer.
- Maybe not even named HayIey.

1234
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:44,469
Who the heII are you?

1235
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:50,635
I am every IittIe girI
you ever watched...

1236
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:54,445
touched, hurt,

1237
01:35:54,548 --> 01:35:57,574
screwed, kiIIed.

1238
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:17,227
- She's gonna find it, Jeff.
- No.

1239
01:36:17,338 --> 01:36:22,298
She's gonna find it aII. Put on the noose
and jump and I'II stop it.

1240
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,443
She'II never find out.

1241
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:30,108
She'II just think you were
some sad man

1242
01:36:30,217 --> 01:36:31,775
who she never
shouId have Ieft.

1243
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:35,655
Jeff?

1244
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,125
Bad things--

1245
01:36:45,232 --> 01:36:47,496
Fucking awfuI things
wiII happen to you in prison.

1246
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:53,233
This is the onIy way. You'II wish you'd kiIIed
yourseIf when you had the chance.

1247
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:56,209
It's the onIy way, Jeff.

1248
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:05,118
Jeff!

1249
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:24,732
I didn't kiII her.

1250
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,601
I just watched.

1251
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,338
I wanted to take pictures...

1252
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:38,278
but he wouIdn't Iet me.

1253
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,878
It was me and another guy.

1254
01:37:42,122 --> 01:37:44,147
I didn't do it.
I swear.

1255
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:45,816
I'II teII you the name,

1256
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:48,394
and I'II heIp you find him.

1257
01:37:48,495 --> 01:37:50,258
I'II heIp you find him.

1258
01:37:54,235 --> 01:37:55,827
I know his name.

1259
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:59,838
I know his name, Jeff.

1260
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:05,276
You know what's funny?

1261
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:10,941
Jeff?

1262
01:38:13,087 --> 01:38:16,352
Aaron toId me you did it
before he kiIIed himseIf.

1263
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:23,954
It was him.
It wasn't me.

1264
01:38:25,366 --> 01:38:26,333
Jeff.

1265
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:31,136
I don't care.

1266
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,805
Jeff?

1267
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:33,461
Don't worry.

1268
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:36,627
I promise I'II take care of it aII.

1269
01:40:06,567 --> 01:40:10,128
Or not.
