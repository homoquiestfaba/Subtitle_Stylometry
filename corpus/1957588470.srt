if I ever came back to Texas,

as anything but myself.

-I just want you to be safe.
I'm sorry.

1373
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,460
It was inappropriate of me
to ask you to dress

1374
00:51:42,494 --> 00:51:43,830
differently than
you usually would.

1375
00:51:43,863 --> 00:51:46,098
It was. I just --
I don't want to stifle you.

1376
00:51:46,132 --> 00:51:47,566
I just want to make sure
you're safe,

1377
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,369
and I don't trust
anyone here to not be...

1378
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:54,639
-Attracted to my beauty?
I understand.

1379
00:51:54,673 --> 00:51:57,475
Thank you.

Oh, my God, your hand.
-Yeah, I know.

00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,414
It looks like shit.

1382
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,887
-Was it scary?

1383
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,922
-Yeah, it was really scary.

-Are you sure
you want to do this?

1385
00:52:15,094 --> 00:52:17,429
I mean, this is
legitimately insane, D.

I mean, what are you even doing?

1387
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:22,001
-I'm running as a Republican
to beat another Republican.

to exclaim everything.

and drop out before the midterm,

1395

a new candidate.

that you can win?

people run and win on less.

And if I win,

1400

for the first time ever.

1401
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:44,757
-Okay.
So, what if you don't win?

1402
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:46,491
What if you're out and --
-Then fuck it.

1403
00:52:46,524 --> 00:52:48,027
Like, I'm not gonna
technically get in any trouble,

1404
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,729
and maybe it'll at least
make people think twice about

1405
00:52:49,762 --> 00:52:51,496
who they're fucking voting for.

1406
00:52:51,529 --> 00:52:53,032
-Is this illegal?
-Aah!

1407
00:52:53,065 --> 00:52:55,801
I don't know!
I mean, no, it's not illegal!

1408

about everything?!

-Yeah.

I mean, I've always wanted
to make you over.
