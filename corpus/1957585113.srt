1
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:14,481
(slow paced music)
(birds chirping)

2
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,362
(reporters chattering)

3
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,285
- [Mike] My Father,
Michael Landon,

4
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,254
had been loved by millions.

5
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,390
And now that he was gone, the
world would mourn with us.

6
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,459
Mourn the loss of a
man who spent his life

7
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,860
bringing loving families

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,996
and honest values into
their living rooms.

9
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,199
But my Father was
much more complex

10
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,536
than the simple, noble,
men he portrayed.

11
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,137
And his own family
life didn't always

12
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,739
mirror the television images.

13
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,276
I am my Father's son

14
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,613
and I have struggled
with his legacy

15
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,383
and my own.

16
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,197
(slow paced music)

17
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,180
- [Walkie-Talkie] Are
you gonna make a move,

18
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,449
or are you just gonna
let me sit here and rot?

19
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,250
Over.

20
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,856
(boy burping)

21
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,025
- Knight to king
bishop three, over.

22
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,627
(boy burping)

23
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,661
- [Boy On Walkie-Talkie]
Decent move.

24
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,463
Pawn to king knight four, over.

25
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,668
(car approaching)

26
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,304
- Dad's home Jack.

27
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,739
Gotta go, over and out.

28
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,144
- [Girl] Move it!

29
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:24,978
- Ow!

30
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,682
Got a green one!

31
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:30,517
- Cheat!

32
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,985
Not fair!

33
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,253
- [Boy] Sucker!

34
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,589
Let go!

35
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,161
I said let go!

36
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,964
- Give him a chance to breathe!

37
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:47,901
(woman screaming)

38
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,902
- Watch out kids!

39
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,537
- [Boy] Sorry Betty!

40
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,239
- Where are my children!

41
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,642
Hey!

42
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,811
Hey, how was your day huh?

43
00:02:58,811 --> 00:02:59,779
- [Boy] Pretty good!

44
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,714
- [Michael] Kisses, kisses.

45
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,682
- I hit two homers Daddy.

46
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,516
Brought in five runs.

47
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,219
- Way to go Les!

48
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,420
- Can we play three flies up?

49
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,254
I'm up first.

50
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,023
- Yeah we can play.

51
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:10,890
Hang on a second.

52
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,959
Lord you're beautiful.

53
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,229
Would you marry me?

54
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,397
- I already did.

55
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,631
- That's a relief.

56
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,933
(Michael laughing)

57
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,601
All right, you got
two home runs huh?

58
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,702
Did you beat up any wimps today?

59
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,770
- Just Mike.

60
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,704
- You wish!

61
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,505
- Come on, let's get our mitts.

62
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,339
- Mike.

63
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,309
Did you have a report
card to give Dad?

64
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,546
- Up.

65
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,052
Now you know all I care
about is you do your best.

66
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:39,886
You work hard.

67
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,790
Any bad grades in effort?

68
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,061
- Only one, English.

69
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,697
- Well that's one too many son.

70
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,400
Now if you don't understand
something that's one thing,

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,736
but there is no
excuse for laziness.

72
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,172
If it happens again
you're gonna be

73
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,907
spending weekends up in
your room, you got me?

74
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,476
- Yes sir.

75
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,310
- All right.

76
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,448
- Dad, we have no
school tomorrow.

77
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,083
Can we still go
to work with you?

78
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,551
Please?

79
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,819
- Why?
- Please?

80
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,287
- [Michael] Nothing good
ever happens out there.

81
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,555
Come on!

82
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,091
(glass shattering)
(triumphant music)

83
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,927
(women screaming)

84
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,803
(men grunting)

85
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,712
(water splashing)

86
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,615
This time, wash
behind your ears!

87
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,318
(horse neighs)

88
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,719
Cut!

89
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,553
Cut.

90
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,788
Andy, Andy!

91
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,589
You want John to
direct the camera?

92
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,056
- That was very good.

93
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,392
- You all right?

94
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,226
- You bet.

95
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,727
- That was great.

96
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,195
- All right, ladies and
gentlemen, that is a wrap!

97
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,263
Have a nice weekend!

98
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,465
- Mike.

99
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,001
You have time to look at a

100
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,236
couple of script changes
- No!

101
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,170
- [Director] Before you split

102
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,271
because you see--

103
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,205
- I miss my wife,

104
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,574
- [Both Michaels] and baby girl!

105
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,409
- [Michael Jr.]
That was great Dad.

106
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,243
- Hey, here hey wait.

107
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,613
Now remember kids.

108
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,815
We got an early
morning tomorrow.

109
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,151
Gotta pick up your brother
Josh and go fishing!

110
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,328
(slow paced rock music)

111
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:30,997
- That's him man!

112
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,400
I know that guy, I know him!

113
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,304
Look Ted, it's Little
Joe from Bonanza!

114
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,176
Yo, how's Pa and Big Hoss man?

115
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,880
Hey, show us that fast draw
you got there Little Joe!

116
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,150
(men imitate shooting)

117
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,787
Hey Little Joe, hey,

118
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,890
you ever seen one of these
on the Ponderosa man?

119
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,394
(men screaming)

120
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,368
(car screeching)

121
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,541
- Stay in the car kids.

122
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,583
- What's he doing?

123
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,452
- I think Dad's gonna
kick their butts!

124
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,687
(man screaming)

125
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,390
- Now that I've got your
undivided attention,

126
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,058
it should be clear
that I do not like

127
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,494
my children exposed to
that kind of disrespect.

128
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,696
Yeah?

129
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,530
- Uh huh, uh huh.

130
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,364
- Clear?

131
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,532
All right.

132
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,013
(all laughing)

133
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,949
(light slow music)

134
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,459
Hey.

135
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,660
Wake up.

136
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,694
Rise and fish.

137
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,231
We have a dry night?

138
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,502
Don't worry about it.

139
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,337
Go on, go get cleaned up.

140
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,405
I'll take care of the sheets.

141
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,239
- No, let me Dad.

142
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,073
- Hey Son,

143
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,610
you'll outgrow it, all right?

144
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,678
Don't worry about it.

145
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,147
At least your Mother's not gonna

146
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,616
hang the sheets out the
window like mine did.

147
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,885
But then again, your
Mother hasn't washed

148
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,887
her sheets since I met her.

149
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,389
Now go on, I'll stash
these for Betty.

150
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,223
Go on.

151
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,427
- I love you Dad.

152
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,900
- I love you more.

153
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,303
Now go on, the fish are waiting.

154
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,707
(kids laughing)

155
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,541
Get 'em!

156
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,144
Come on!

157
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,152
(fish splashing)

158
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,086
Here you go Son.

159
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,788
I got one all set up for you.

160
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,361
Hey, tell me something would ya?

161
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,998
What's up with
your brother Mark?

162
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,333
I hardly ever see him anymore.

163
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,434
- Nah, he's fine.

164
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,635
He still works
part-time at the market

165
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,537
and he still plays piano
every other second.

166
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,873
- I guess he's just too grown up

167
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,708
to come around anymore huh?

168
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,542
- Yeah.

169
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,776
- I can dig that.

170
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:31,677
As soon as I got
away from my folks

171
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,179
I was long gone too.

172
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,717
- Harry, quick!

173
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,718
Get over here, get a picture!

174
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,186
Mister, oh would you mind?

175
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,420
Oh you don't mind do you?
- Come on, come on, let's go.

176
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,890
- [Woman] You are going
to make our vacation!

177
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,724
Do you know who this is?

178
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,658
- Here we go.

179
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,193
- [Woman] Oh you're so tall!

180
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,363
You might wanna put your hand
around my shoulder Mr. Landon.

181
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,564
Oh gosh!

182
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,233
(kids laughing)

183
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,284
- [Michael] Hey Dodie!

184
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,118
- [Woman] Hi.

185
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:12,952
- Right on time!

186
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,629
Come on Josh, time to go son.

187
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,431
- Why do I have to
go home so early?

188
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,369
- Because, your mom has
something special planned.

189
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,539
Now, I promise.

190
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,808
Next time you can spend
the whole weekend okay?

191
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:38,511
Come on son.

192
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,518
We had a great time!

193
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,620
- I feel sorry for Josh.

194
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,855
- Yeah, me too.

195
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,024
I'd die if I couldn't
see my Dad every day.

196
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,429
- No, no, you're wrong.

197
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,263
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

198
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,464
- No, you're wrong.

199
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,398
Look, if Nixon was
innocent he would turn

200
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,634
the tapes over to Judge Sirica.

201
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,868
- You're completely
missing my point.

202
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,136
We're talking about
the system here.

203
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,138
We're talking about
political sabotage,

204
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,573
partisan politics
at it's finest.

205
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,041
That's what we're talking about.

206
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,543
- Of course it's much
easier to blame the system

207
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,345
than hold the individual
accountable, right?

208
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,179
- Lynn, I love your brother,

209
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,480
but he's full of crap.

210
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,315
Michael.

211
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,585
Pass the tartar
sauce would ya son?

212
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,021
- The man is a liar and a thief.

213
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:26,192
- Bob, never argue with
someone that loves to argue.

214
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,560
- Lynn, we're not arguing.

215
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,261
We're debating about
the best foreign policy

216
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,763
president this
country has ever had.

217
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,731
That's what we're doing.

218
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:32,565
- Oh man.

219
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,567
- Excuse me.

220
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,603
(Michael sneezes)

221
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,304
- [Bob And Les] Bless you.

222
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,438
- God bless you.

223
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,940
- [Everyone] Aw!

224
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,509
(everyone laughing)

225
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,810
- Michael.

226
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,978
- What?

227
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,013
- What you're
teaching the children.

228
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,950
Oh!

229
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,490
- Come on, lighten up.

230
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,061
- Awe geez, he's choking again.

231
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,330
- Give him some air.
- Do something.

232
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,297
- Come here, come here.
- Mike.

233
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,600
- [Michael] Come on, up you go.

234
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,434
Come on.

235
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,538
He's all right.

236
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,273
- I told him to eat slowly
and to chew his food.

237
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,941
I have told him a million times!

238
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,143
- It's all right.

239
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,478
Next time, chew better.

240
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,646
All right son?

241
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,181
- How many times
have I told you this?

242
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,216
Mike, how many times have I
told you to chew your food?

243
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,718
You scared me to death.

244
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,455
- But Nixon is not as out
of line as you think he is.

245
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,923
- [Bob] Oh come on.

246
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,492
- [Mike] Woo hoo!
(water splashing)

247
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,326
Here I go!

248
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,763
I get the pole first!

249
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,998
- [Les] No!

250
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,769
- [Mike] Take that!
(slow paced music)

251
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,274
- I've been looking at some
houses in Beverly Hills.

252
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,209
I want you to look with me.

253
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,343
- Aren't you happy here?

254
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,179
- Yes, I'm happy.

255
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,046
That's not it.

256
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,887
The truth is, we've
run out of bedrooms.

257
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,355
- What do you mean we've...

258
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,095
Why didn't you tell
me that before!

259
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,229
- Oh, well you were
too busy shoving

260
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,664
food up your nose for one thing.

261
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,466
- Oh Lynn baby, I'm so happy.

262
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,634
I'm so happy.

263
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,837
I never though that
this could happen.

264
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,305
- Well we always planned
for a big family.

265
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,207
- No, no, no, I mean
I never thought that

266
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,043
I would be part
of a happy family.

267
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,979
I just never thought
it was possible.

268
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,347
- Well it is

269
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,348
and you are.

270
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,518
- I love you so much.

271
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,224
The kids.

272
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,925
Hey kids, kids, kids!

273
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,026
Listen up!

274
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,027
We're having a baby.

275
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,563
We're having a baby!

276
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:48,667
(Lynn and Michael laughing)

277
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,669
- [Lynn] So, is
that okay with you?

278
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,504
- [Kids] Yeah!

279
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,571
- Is that okay with you?

280
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,941
- It's okay with me.

281
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,844
(slow paced music)

282
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,329
- Yes, careful, careful!

283
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,598
This is so exciting!

284
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,066
I can't believe it.

285
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,868
I can't believe you bought
us such a great house.

286
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,670
- Hey, every woman needs
a 20,000 square foot

287
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,138
house with nine bedrooms.

288
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,373
- And 13 bathrooms.

289
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,241
- To buy toilet
paper by the case.

290
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,911
(both laughing)

291
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,915
Uh-oh.

292
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:38,851
Yeah.

293
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,025
Hey kids.

294
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,561
Come on, why the glum faces?

295
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,096
- It's gonna be so
different living here.

296
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,031
- Ah sweetheart--

297
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,699
- I miss the old house already.

298
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,336
- Come here.

299
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,438
Have you been thinking about
how much fun we can have here?

300
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,307
We can go swimming,
we can play baseball,

301
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,641
you can play tennis.

302
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,109
- It's so big.

303
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,245
- Son, everything's gonna
be the same as it was,

304
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,247
only bigger.

305
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,248
Come on, look up there.

306
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,249
See that?

307
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,517
That is your room.

308
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:13,986
Michael, you're gonna
have practically

309
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,754
the whole front of
the house to yourself.

310
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,394
(light gentle music)

311
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,208
- Jack, how did your parents
act before they got divorced?

312
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,710
I mean, were there any signs?

313
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,078
Over.

314
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,579
- [Jack] You mean like
fighting over everything

315
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,914
or not speaking at all,

316
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,682
and traveling alone?

317
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,486
Bishop to queen rook five.

318
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,787
Why?

319
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:49,622
- I don't know.

320
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,191
It's nothing, nevermind.

321
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,094
Hey, Dad's home, over and out.

322
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,634
(upbeat gentle music)

323
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,136
Out of the way!

324
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,804
- [Les] Shawna,
Chris, Dad's home!

325
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,539
- [Shawna] Daddy, Daddy!

326
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,541
- [Chris] Me first, me!

327
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,609
- [Les] Nope, get out of my way!

328
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,279
(kids shouting)

329
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,516
- Hey kids, kids, kids!

330
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,417
- [Les] Hi Dad!

331
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,685
- Hi.

332
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,819
Hey, come on, you gotta
let me get in the house.

333
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,021
- Kisses Daddy, kisses!
(kids shouting)

334
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,856
- Chris, you're getting
too heavy for this!

335
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,890
Listen, I can't
hear you when you're

336
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,258
talking at the same time!

337
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,359
- Hey Dad, check out
- Chris, come on now.

338
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,627
- My report card.
- Quiet!

339
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,561
- [Michael] Would
you be quiet son!

340
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,496
- [Lynn] Shawna, come on, Chris.

341
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,630
I have told you about this.

342
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,332
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

343
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,667
Did you have a hard day?

344
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,601
- Yeah, I just need a little--

345
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,802
- Chris.

346
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,003
- I just need a little
peace, that's all.

347
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,338
- Okay everybody,
we're due at Antonio's

348
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,806
in one hour.
- No, no, no, no.

349
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,074
- [Michael] Honey, we're
not going to Antonio's

350
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,709
tonight are we?

351
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,643
- You forgot.

352
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,444
That's okay, I'll cancel.

353
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,112
- No, that's fine.

354
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,947
- You've had a hard
day, I'll cancel--

355
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,914
- No, it's fine!

356
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,049
It's fine.

357
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,319
We'll go.

358
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,088
- Let's get something
done with your hair.

359
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,323
Come on.

360
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,257
Betty, help me get
these kids together!

361
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,992
Come on now, come on, let's go.

362
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,061
And how many times
I have to tell you

363
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,297
not to trip on your Father
when he comes through the door.

364
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,966
- No, no, no, no.

365
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,636
(speaking foreign language)

366
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,472
- Thank you.

367
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,474
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey!

368
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,110
You're getting to be
a big kid now, huh?

369
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,179
You look just like your Papa.

370
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,349
Listen, you ever want a job,

371
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,117
you come see Antonio, all right?

372
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,288
- Thank you sir,
that's quite an offer.

373
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,057
(Michael laughing)

374
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:32,891
- Thank you.

375
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,062
- I'd have to be pretty
desperate to work here, huh Dad?

376
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,698
- Hey, don't you
be so cocky Son.

377
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,668
Most people work their
butts off their entire lives

378
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,670
without any
recognition whatsoever.

379
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,738
I mean, you try
hawking studio ads

380
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,006
like my old man did.

381
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,774
Only to drop dead
in a bowl of soup.

382
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,244
If I didn't go to
audition with a friend,

383
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,812
and get lucky enough
to get an acting job,

384
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,247
I'd still be
unloading freight cars

385
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,548
and you sure wouldn't
be sitting here tonight

386
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,583
where you are mister.

387
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,154
- Do I get something to drink?

388
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:02,988
- Yeah.

389
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,490
Hey.

390
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,658
How about a glass of Mrs.
Landon's favorite red wine?

391
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,496
- I never used to have to ask.

392
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,433
What's going on?

393
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,972
- I have a basketball
game on Saturday.

394
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,473
- Honey, I was talking to Dad.

395
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,746
- Yeah, just a makeup girl.

396
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,882
She's young, she makes mistakes.

397
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,751
- Why does she get to you so?

398
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,585
- I don't know.

399
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,791
- Hey, how about a
barbecue this weekend?

400
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,125
It's been so long
since we've had--

401
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,194
- Son, I was
thinking about maybe

402
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,562
going fishing this weekend.

403
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,098
- That's even better!

404
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,134
- No, I was thinking
about going alone.

405
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,908
Look son, I'm worn out.

406
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,810
All right, I need
a little space,

407
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,411
a little room to myself.

408
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,347
- Yeah.

409
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,182
- I think that's a great idea.

410
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,453
You give so much
to everyone, to us,

411
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,090
I think you probably need
some time for yourself.

412
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,326
- [Michael] Well
thank you sweetheart.

413
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,363
(rushing winds)

414
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:23,368
(bird cawing)
(metal clanking)

415
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,981
(crowd shouting)

416
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,384
- You're our hero Mike!

417
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,228
(car approaching)

418
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,871
- Hey, how was fishing?

419
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,072
- Hi Son!

420
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,273
Time alone is just
what I needed.

421
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,774
Casting into the
wind, the warm sand.

422
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,677
- Your rod's so clean.

423
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,247
So is your tackle box.

424
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,148
- Hi, how was it?

425
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,649
Fish biting?

426
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,483
- No.

427
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,086
I'm a little tired sweetheart.

428
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,454
I'm gonna go take a nap.

429
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,931
(somber music)

430
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,845
(phone ringing)

431
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,913
- [Man On Phone]
Perry Investigations.

432
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,047
- Yes.

433
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:42,748
- [Perry Investigations]
May I help you?

434
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,251
- I have a situation here and--

435
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,487
- [Perry Investigations]
What can we do for you?

436
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,688
- It's probably nothing.

437
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,425
- See ya later guys.

438
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,660
- That was a great
play in the ninth Son!

439
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,295
And you reached right
up and grabbed that ball

440
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,429
out of the sky!

441
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,397
- You're embarrassing.
- Thanks Dad.

442
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,665
- [Father] Look, week after week

443
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,767
you're embarrassing
me, why is that?

444
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,734
Huh?

445
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,436
- What a jerk.

446
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,370
I wonder if that
guy has any idea

447
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,638
what he's doing to his son.

448
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,675
- When we get home,
you're gonna take so many

449
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:10,709
round balls until you get--

450
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,377
- He's gonna miss the ball...

451
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,915
You know something,
that's exactly what

452
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,350
my mother used to do.

453
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,119
One day I was maybe 14-years-old

454
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,354
out in front of our drug store

455
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,789
with a bunch of
my friends, right.

456
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,091
Taxi cab comes screaming
up to the front,

457
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,292
she jumps out starts hitting me

458
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,327
over the head with
a coat hanger.

459
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,361
Calling me all kinds of names

460
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,598
in front of my friends.

461
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,266
- So what'd you do?

462
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,234
- What'd I do?

463
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,501
I made like it was a joke.

464
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,336
I said, "Hey guys,
I think I gotta go.

465
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,537
"My mother wants me."

466
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,207
Sometimes I wanna
punch her lights out.

467
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,479
- So Dad, is everything
all right with you and Mom?

468
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,618
- You know what
that guy oughta do?

469
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,852
He ought to tell his Son,

470
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,289
"Son listen, some balls
are bound to get by you.

471
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,858
"But just don't beat
yourself up if they do."

472
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,161
- [Shawna] Santa came!

473
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,263
Santa came!

474
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,063
Santa came!
- Presents, presents!

475
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,832
- [Shawna] Santa came!

476
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,303
- [Lynn] Merry Christmas!

477
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,372
- This is a moment we
don't wanna forget.

478
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,274
(camera shutters)

479
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,808
- Cut!

480
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,210
Thanks Mr. Landon.

481
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,745
Nice work kids.

482
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,847
All right, we'll reset
for Mother's closeup.

483
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,684
- Mrs. Landon, a call for you.

484
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,492
- Hello.

485
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:34,293
- [Perry Investigations]
Mrs. Landon.

486
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,527
- [Lynn] Yes.

487
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,461
- [Perry Investigations]
Perry Investigations.

488
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,096
I have information for you.

489
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,931
I'm sorry to confirm
your husband is

490
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:43,235
having an affair with the
makeup artist on his show.

491
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,937
I have dates, times,
and photographs.

492
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,609
- Thank you, I'll
get back to you.

493
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,012
- Hey Lynn.

494
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,048
Lynn.

495
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,054
Sweetheart, what's the matter?

496
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,489
- Why don't you tell me
about your little secret?

497
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:09,695
- Dad, Shawna hit me with
her action figure again.

498
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:10,896
- Hey, well why
don't we just go talk

499
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,397
to your sister about that huh?

500
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,850
- Hey, I've been
trying to raise you.

501
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,784
What are you doing?

502
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,089
- Dreaming of snow and ice.

503
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:38,990
Hey!

504
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,960
How about we get two ice
blocks from the ice shed

505
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,663
and slide down the hill
at the country club?

506
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,932
- Yeah, like that
could really happen.

507
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,900
- No man, I've done it.

508
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,268
I know I got a picture here.

509
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,841
Here, see.

510
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,641
Aspen.

511
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,345
Man, what's with you?

512
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,880
- Something's going on at home.

513
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,416
I think it's serious.

514
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,886
I mean, I never could
talk to my Mom before,

515
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,690
but now my Dad's
getting weird too.

516
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,191
- You're 15 man.

517
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,994
You're not supposed to
talk to your parents.

518
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,430
They hate you, you hate them.

519
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,632
Why do you think my Mom has
me here in the guest house?

520
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,401
- But it's different
at my house!

521
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,037
I mean, my Dad's the best!

522
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,239
He's everything!

523
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,309
- It's like that in
everybody's house man.

524
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,311
Just some of us are
better at hiding it.

525
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,856
- You think this stuff helps?

526
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,425
- Maybe.

527
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,259
Sometimes.

528
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,966
- Too many things are changing.

529
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,005
Keep it on our channel Jack.

530
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,782
- These just arrived from Dad.

531
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,218
He has to shoot late so
he's gonna meet you there.

532
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,920
Aren't they beautiful?

533
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,087
- I don't know what
your Dad wants from me.

534
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,656
One minute I'm a
queen, the next minute

535
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,058
I'm an absolute stranger.

536
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,329
- Where's that silvery
eyeshadow that you like so much?

537
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,032
Let me help?

538
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,805
- You know, when your
Father and I were...

539
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,640
When your Father was
with Dodie, you know,

540
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,541
he came after me.

541
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,976
I didn't go after him.

542
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,512
I never wanted to be any
kind of homewrecker or any...

543
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,415
- Mom, what are
you talking about?

544
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,716
- [Bob] Knock knock!

545
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:45,650
- [Les] Hi.

546
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,384
- Hi, may I approach the bench?

547
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,786
- Yeah, listen.

548
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,221
Talk to Mom 'cause
she's weirding out

549
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,089
and I need to go
find some eyeshadow.

550
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,266
- You okay sis?

551
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,203
- He told me the
affair was over.

552
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,506
I have to believe him.

553
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,609
I have to give my
marriage a chance.

554
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,145
- I know.

555
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,113
I know you do.

556
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,219
- Sit still, you keep moving!

557
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,655
- I keep moving so you
can get it in my mouth!

558
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,689
- Uh-uh.

559
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,191
- Okay shh, it's time.

560
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,726
Listen.

561
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:28,793
- And now, for the favorite
dramatic television program,

562
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,296
the nominations are, "Family."

563
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,265
(audience applauding)

564
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,332
- Stop, stop it Chris!

565
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,935
Look, there's Dad, look.
- "Quincy!"

566
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,337
- "Little House on the Prairie."

567
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,540
(audience applauding)

568
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,643
And your favorite is, "Little
House on the Prairie."

569
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,312
(kids shouting)

570
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,117
- Thank you.

571
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:56,154
I'm especially
proud of this award.

572
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,923
I love television.

573
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,991
It's one heck of a medium.

574
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,395
- Mom sure looks nervous.

575
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,896
- [Dad] And if our show

576
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,765
causes one child to

577
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,801
pick up a book and read it,

578
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,838
then I'm especially proud.

579
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,509
Because hey, Mom and Dad,

580
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,979
if we don't start
talking to our families

581
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:25,283
then I'm afraid we're
gonna have dire problems.

582
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,726
- Mom, isn't it great?

583
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:35,560
Dad won!

584
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,232
What's going on?

585
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:43,902
- Come here.

586
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:45,937
Sit down sweetheart.

587
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,308
Leslie, you know
how much I love you.

588
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,011
I mean, you're so pretty.

589
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,115
- [Les] Dad, what's going on?

590
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,217
- I tried not to...

591
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,254
Sweetie, I tried really
hard not to hurt anybody.

592
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,091
- What are you talking about?

593
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,594
- Your Daddy has met
and fallen in love

594
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,562
with another woman.

595
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,968
Please don't hate me sweetheart.

596
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,869
- No!

597
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:18,803
(Les sobbing)

598
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,039
- Leslie, please don't!

599
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,674
- No!

600
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,508
- Leslie.

601
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,977
Go to your room.

602
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:34,786
What did you say to her?

603
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,188
- I told her the truth.

604
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,325
- Oh.

605
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,493
What is the truth Mike?

606
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,096
That you just led
me to the apartment

607
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,331
of the woman you're
sleeping with?

608
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,499
- No, I didn't
lead you anywhere,

609
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,067
you followed me, remember?

610
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,069
- You told me it was over.

611
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,270
- I thought it was over.

612
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,709
I just can't seem
to help myself.

613
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,645
I'm all screwed up in the head.

614
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,317
Listen, sweetheart,

615
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,486
it's not you, it's me.

616
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,024
I'm just not excited
about my work anymore.

617
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,858
- Oh.

618
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,193
You're not excited.

619
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,562
How can you be so selfish!

620
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:18,963
- I'm not excited about
- We have built something

621
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,398
- Anything anymore Lynn,
- Here Mike!

622
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,967
- [Michael] And it's
tearing me apart!

623
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,569
I mean, people, they see
a whole different thing,

624
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,870
but I feel like,

625
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,407
I feel like nothing.

626
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,209
- Oh please.

627
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,410
- I even think that
you and the kids,

628
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,978
that you don't love
me for who I am.

629
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,180
You love me for what I'm

630
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,581
supposed to be.
- Oh my god.

631
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,083
- Would you listen to me!
- I can't believe!

632
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,217
- [Lynn] I can't believe
you're saying this to me.

633
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,719
Fine, fine!

634
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,253
Then quit the business!

635
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,521
Who cares!

636
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,356
I don't care if you are
a plumber, a movie star,

637
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,392
just don't destroy...
- You don't care?

638
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,760
- [Michael] Look at
what I've given you!

639
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,694
I've given you everything
you ever wanted

640
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,196
in your whole life!

641
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,497
And I've lived like
a saint through the

642
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,099
whole damn thing!

643
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,634
- Mike.

644
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,469
Mike,

645
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,639
this is our life.

646
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,110
We have a life and
have a happy family.

647
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,277
We have obligations--

648
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,046
- I don't want
anymore obligations!

649
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,814
I've got enough
obligations Lynn.

650
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,917
What I want is her.

651
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,620
I want her excitement
about my work.

652
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,654
I want her innocence.

653
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,656
Lynn, I want--

654
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,159
- Her youth won't
bring back yours.

655
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,162
- No.

656
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,131
- [Lynn] I don't deserve this.

657
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,566
- No honey, but I deserve this.

658
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:34,339
I deserve this.
(solemn music)

659
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,173
- Get out.

660
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,077
Get out!

661
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,648
(solemn music)

662
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,241
- If Daddy doesn't live
here anymore is he homeless?

663
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,343
Has he been out in the cold?

664
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,411
- No, I told you.

665
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,512
He was living in a hotel

666
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,480
but now he has a real house

667
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,049
and we can go visit him.

668
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,051
- [Shawna] He's here!

669
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:20,952
- Hey Dad.

670
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,487
Yeah, I missed you too.

671
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,189
Yeah, I'm doing
great, just great.

672
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,691
You'll work things out.

673
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,728
You always do.

674
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,033
- [Kids] Daddy! Daddy!

675
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,802
- [Shawna] Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

676
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,337
- Hey, hey, oh!

677
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,572
How are ya?

678
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,073
- [Chris] I missed you.

679
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,608
- Do you have everything?
- Missed you too son.

680
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,310
- [Shawna] Are you cold Daddy?

681
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,578
- No sweetheart I'm
not cold, are you?

682
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,179
- No.

683
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,147
- You look good.

684
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,882
- Thank you, so do you.

685
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:51,716
- Hey Dad.

686
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:52,684
- Hey Son.

687
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,384
Come on, let's go, let's go.

688
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,385
Get in the car!

689
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:55,353
Get in the car!

690
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,821
- Wear your jackets, okay!

691
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,290
- [Shawna] Daddy, blue, pink,
and white checkered bag!

692
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,391
- [Mike] I got shotgun!

693
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,659
- [Michael] Okay fine, go ahead.

694
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,493
- Bye.

695
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,965
(upbeat music)

696
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,133
- [Les] Are you guys
getting dizzy now?

697
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,803
(kids laughing)

698
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:25,250
- [Michael] Come on, you
gotta hang onto the horse!

699
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,920
- [Les] You're
sitting on my leg!

700
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,823
- [Michael] Make a funny face.

701
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:32,757
- Should we?

702
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:33,591
Should we?

703
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:34,425
Let's go.

704
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,104
- Hey, "Your fortune
will soon await you."

705
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,808
- I hope it's not talking
about your inheritance.

706
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,609
- Dad.

707
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,479
- What's a harry tance?

708
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,648
- Well son,

709
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,752
a harry tance is a
ferocious monster

710
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,887
that makes families
fight one another.

711
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,056
- That's silly.

712
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,093
- Come on Daddy, read yours!

713
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,261
- All right sweetheart.

714
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,864
Let's see.

715
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,735
"You will soon meet a
mysterious stranger."

716
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,571
Terrific.

717
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,607
As if I don't have enough
trouble as it is, right?

718
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,212
Hey kids, I'm really glad we had

719
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,647
a chance to spend
some time together.

720
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,581
You have fun?

721
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:31,749
You have fun with me, huh?

722
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,818
- I liked the
haunted house best.

723
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,554
- I liked the real
fortune teller lady best.

724
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,755
- Oh yeah?

725
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,191
What real fortune
did the lady tell ya?

726
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,359
- I asked her if you and Mommy

727
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,329
would get back together
and she said yes!

728
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,103
- She doesn't even know our Mom.

729
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,671
I need a fork.

730
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,773
- Chris, Son, I think the
lady might know her stuff.

731
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,476
I mean, I'm still hoping that

732
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,078
your Mom and I
get back together.

733
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,548
- Well that depends Dad.

734
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,783
- Depends on what Les?

735
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,588
- Are you still
seeing, you know?

736
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,891
- I'll get you a fork Chris.

737
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,795
- No.

738
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,597
I'm not sweetheart, that's over.

739
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,332
- Good.

740
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,803
- Hey, where's the
silverware in this place?

741
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,372
- Sweetheart, slow down.

742
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,440
Come on, if you keep
eating like that

743
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,608
you'll be as big as a barn.

744
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,344
(Shawna giggles)

745
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,414
- Whoa!

746
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,315
Diamond earrings!

747
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,551
Hey, who do these belong to?

748
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,723
- I don't know Son,
maybe the cleaning lady?

749
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,960
What do ya say kids?

750
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,862
Do you want ice
cream or a movie?

751
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,701
- [Kids] Ice cream and a movie!

752
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,469
- How 'bout you Son,
what do you say?

753
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,837
Ice cream, a movie, what?

754
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,141
- Whatever.

755
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,843
I got things to do at home.

756
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,249
- Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

757
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,183
Go ahead.

758
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,117
Go ahead, eat, it's good.

759
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,000
- [Intercom] Rollbacks on two.

760
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,769
Brad, rollbacks on
check stand two.

761
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,618
- He is arrogant,
he is thoughtless.

762
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,655
How can he do this to her huh?

763
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,156
How can he do this?

764
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,226
He's just, we're just
so far beneath him?

765
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,562
Or he's so far above
common decency?

766
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:58,796
- [Bob] Calm down.

767
00:34:58,796 --> 00:34:59,964
I mean, you should
think this through.

768
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,999
- Look, I've thought it through.

769
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,135
I am not gonna stick
around for this.

770
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,137
I am not gonna let
me rub my nose in it.

771
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,539
He's moved on.

772
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,878
I'm taking the kids to Mexico.

773
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,481
- [Man] Stop by
when you're done.

774
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,249
- Oh okay, thank you.

775
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,188
- All right, there ya go.

776
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,427
(faint rock music)

777
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,029
- Mom.

778
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,731
Does this make me look fat?

779
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,533
Dad said that I looked fat.

780
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,902
- No honey, you
look fine, just--

781
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,571
(phone ringing)

782
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,975
Well when you bend
over like that it--

783
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,576
Hello.

784
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:46,410
Hi Bob.

785
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,983
- [Bob] Is this a bad time?

786
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,418
- No, it's okay, just tell me.

787
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,687
- [Bob] Michael's
filed for divorce.

788
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,689
(somber music)

789
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,092
- Okay, I guess that's it then.

790
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,260
- [Bob] Sorry.

791
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,597
- That was Uncle Bob.

792
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,835
Your Father filed for divorce.

793
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,005
- But, the fortune
teller lady said--

794
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,973
- She wasn't real Shawna.

795
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,408
Just pretend.

796
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,977
- Does this mean we can't
go out and have fun?

797
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,915
- No, it doesn't.

798
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,149
I'll be damned if we're gonna

799
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,451
sit around here in
this room and mope.

800
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,553
We are gonna have fun.

801
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,891
(upbeat music)

802
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:00,818
I'm sorry?

803
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,090
- What a bozo, what's he want?

804
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,191
- Our Mother.

805
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,095
- Mom!

806
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,568
That's sickening!

807
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,569
What a jerk.

808
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,982
All right, that's
it, I'm outta here!

809
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,717
- What are you doing?

810
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:35,987
- Hey!

811
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,355
- Hey yourself all right!

812
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,589
- [Lynn] What?

813
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,625
- I'm going back, I need
some money for a taxi.

814
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,959
- Honey, do you have to?

815
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,927
The money's in my purse.

816
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,395
- Yeah, so I wanna leave now!

817
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,099
- Where are your
manners you punk?

818
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,001
You insult me, my partner--

819
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,570
- Hey, she's not your
partner all right greaseball!

820
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,840
Hey, do that again
and I'm again belt ya!

821
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,447
(men grunting)

822
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,049
(man speaking foreign language)

823
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:05,883
- Michael!

824
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:11,188
- Aye, aye, aye!
(Michael grunting)

825
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,024
- What are you doing?

826
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,492
- Trying to get away from you!

827
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,394
- Oh, I see, it's okay for your
Father to live with someone

828
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,462
but I can't even have a dance?

829
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,563
- No!

830
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,965
None of it's okay all right!

831
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,568
I mean, there's
four kids at home

832
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,571
and neither one of you
are thinking about us!

833
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,406
- Michael!

834
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,274
Michael!

835
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:34,478
(slow paced music)

836
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:37,982
Hey.

837
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:43,621
Come here.

838
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,495
The last time I nursed a
black eye it was your Dad's.

839
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,398
Would you believe he
got in a fight over

840
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,933
some wig I was wearing?

841
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,337
A big ole pink puffy thing

842
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,739
and it didn't even
look like hair.

843
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,240
Well he'd had a little
too much to drink

844
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,876
and he decided it was
time to defend my honor.

845
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:10,614
- You wore a pink wig?

846
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,551
- Yes.

847
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,254
It was very much the style.

848
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,156
And if there's one thing
your Father demanded of me,

849
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:20,491
it was to be stylish.

850
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,461
You know, you really reminded
me of him back there.

851
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:27,865
So brave, and
handsome, and foolish.

852
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,370
- I didn't feel so brave.

853
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,342
I'm scared.

854
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:42,580
- I know honey.

855
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:45,516
We all are.

856
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,560
- [Betty] Come on,
come on, don't run!

857
00:39:58,362 --> 00:39:59,964
- [Shawna] Come on!

858
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,535
- Come on, come on, come on.

859
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:08,806
(door knocking)

860
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:09,607
- Mom?

861
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,516
His stuff's gone.

862
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:22,453
He took everything.

863
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,092
- He probably just wanted
to spare you kids the pain.

864
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,594
(Mom sobbing)

865
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,650
I miss him.

866
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,385
I miss him so much.

867
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,854
(Lynn crying)

868
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,992
- He'll be back.

869
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:02,827
On weekends.

870
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,596
Buy you stuff you
really don't need.

871
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,767
- Dad knows he screwed up.

872
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,837
He'll fix things.

873
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,305
He always does.

874
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,340
- Yeah, he was just on
vacation for a while

875
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,842
with someone besides your Mom.

876
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,778
- Shut up Jack!

877
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,279
- Hey, it's tougher for you.

878
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,949
Everyone knows who your Dad is.

879
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,485
And the rep you
gotta live up to.

880
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,821
Never thought I'd be
thankful to my Dad

881
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,789
for being a nobody.

882
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,027
Hey, where are you going now?

883
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,899
- I've always wanted
to go into that house,

884
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:42,933
and I'm going to.

885
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,737
- What if somebody's home?

886
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,072
- So don't let 'em see you.

887
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,315
(knob clanking)

888
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,356
(steps thudding)

889
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,492
Shh.
(Jack laughing)

890
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,160
Wow, check this out.

891
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,230
- Whoa!

892
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,369
(harp chiming)

893
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,304
- [Mike] Whoa dude,
this place is creepy.

894
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,907
- It's pretty cool to me.

895
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,108
- [Mike] Oh cool!

896
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,843
Give me one of those!

897
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:28,779
- Oh yeah.

898
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:30,648
Ooh.

899
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:37,888
- [Man] Who's in here?

900
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,964
(gun clicking)

901
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,634
- [Jack] Mike.

902
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:54,171
- [Homeowner] Turn around and
move back the way you came.

903
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,445
If it happens again
I call the cops!

904
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,316
- Is that cool or what man?

905
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:07,818
What the!

906
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,321
What the hell!

907
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,589
- You almost got us killed!

908
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,790
- Dude, what are
you talking about!

909
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,925
That guy was running
on unleaded gas!

910
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,828
- I'm not listening
to you anymore.

911
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,666
(Mike grunting)

912
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,843
♪ We are going to Malibu,
Malibu, to Malibu ♪

913
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,479
♪ We are going to Malibu

914
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:37,147
- [Michael] We're gonna
go to the beach house!

915
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:37,982
- [Shawna] Come on Daddy!

916
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,917
Help me up, help me up!

917
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,921
- That's it Michael, I'm not
gonna lie for you anymore.

918
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,390
You're gonna have to
find a way to face him

919
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,958
and deal with his new life.

920
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,795
- I'm not ready to meet her.

921
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:56,734
What about you Mom?

922
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,039
What kind of life is getting
all fixed up for him?

923
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,176
And then to spend the
rest of the day in bed?

924
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,555
- Come on, come on!

925
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:21,291
(kids screaming)

926
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,195
- Get it!

927
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,130
Shawna, run!

928
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,297
Run with it, run!

929
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,999
Run, faster, faster!

930
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,833
Faster!

931
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,502
Faster!

932
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,874
I love you.

933
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:37,708
Go!

934
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,583
- What is it Betty?

935
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,751
What's so important?

936
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,687
- [Betty] There's
someone here to see you.

937
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,821
- Dad!

938
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,022
- [Michael] Ta-da!

939
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,292
- What oh what no way!
(Michael laughing)

940
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,162
- Hey, happy
birthday big ole boy!

941
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,798
Here you go.

942
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,167
- No way, this is so incredible!

943
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,168
Hey, let's go for a spin,

944
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:05,536
you can be my first passenger!

945
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,037
Santa Barbara?
- Son I can't.

946
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,272
- [Michael] I'm already a
little late for Cindy's.

947
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:09,807
You understand, right?

948
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,875
But hey, we're still on to
meet her next week, right?

949
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,676
- Sure, right.

950
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:13,510
- All right.

951
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,446
Hey, Son, enjoy it!

952
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:25,923
He made everybody turn around

953
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,925
and up out of the water
comes nothing but,

954
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,728
nothing but skin and
black eyebrows, right?

955
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,995
(everyone laughing)

956
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,931
Looking for his, trying
to put his hair back on.

957
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,899
We had a two hour break that day

958
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,769
because they had to dry his
hairpiece to put it back on.

959
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:41,472
Hey, hey, listen.

960
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,840
I'll meet you over there then.

961
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,641
Come on, come on kids.

962
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,910
Listen, Cindy is
really kind of nervous

963
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,545
about meeting you two.

964
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:49,747
She wants to make sure
that you like her.

965
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,348
Now you're gonna like her.

966
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:52,516
You're gonna love her.

967
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,252
She's funny, she's
cute, and, here she is!

968
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,821
Cindy, I want you
to meet my kids.

969
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,590
This is Mike Jr.

970
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,390
- Hi.

971
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,026
- Hello.

972
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,097
- And this, this is my Leslie.

973
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,699
- Hi Cindy.

974
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:09,900
I like your blouse.

975
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,569
- Thanks.

976
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,538
I like yours too.

977
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:15,739
- Ain't that just
like two women?

978
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:18,208
They're always yakking
about clothes Son.

979
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,042
Excuse me!

980
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:21,745
(Michael sneezes)

981
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:22,646
- [Cindy] Bless you.

982
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,582
- Whew!
(Cindy screams)

983
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:26,416
What?

984
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,920
- That is terrible.

985
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,590
- What, what's so funny?
(Michael laughing)

986
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,693
- That was our joke.
(somber music)

987
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:40,430
- Excuse me.

988
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:45,602
Son.

989
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,870
Son, look, listen to me.

990
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,239
Look, your Mom, she just
wanted a different deal.

991
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,442
The big house,
the fancy clothes,

992
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:53,644
the Beverly Hills lunches.

993
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,412
I mean, it's fine,
but it's just not me.

994
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:01,618
Listen, Cindy likes the
same things that I like.

995
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:03,887
It's a simple life.

996
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,326
Son, you understand what
I'm trying to tell ya?

997
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,196
- Yeah Dad.

998
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:18,368
Yeah I do.

999
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:21,505
(engine turns)

1000
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,740
(car revs)

1001
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,980
(rock music)

1002
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,348
- Oh, hey man, how'd it go?

1003
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,518
- Race you to the bottom?

1004
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,922
- On this road,
we'll kill ourselves.

1005
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:43,927
- Too bad.

1006
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:46,663
(car screeching)

1007
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:52,903
(Michael laughing)

1008
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:53,737
Woo!

1009
00:47:58,842 --> 00:47:59,676
Yeah baby!

1010
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,657
(car screeching)

1011
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,229
Oh, oh you wanna see this?

1012
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,464
You wanna see this?

1013
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,366
Come on baby, let's go!

1014
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:23,200
Woo!

1015
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:25,936
No way!

1016
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:26,770
Sucker!

1017
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:34,678
- Mike!

1018
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,147
Mike slow down!

1019
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,387
(car screeching)

1020
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,223
- Nice to see ya!

1021
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,057
Bye-bye!

1022
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:49,693
- Mike!

1023
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,261
Mike slow down!

1024
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,095
Mike!

1025
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,067
- Oh god!

1026
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,202
(car crashing)

1027
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,738
(car scraping)

1028
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:16,653
- Mikey!

1029
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,822
Oh my god!

1030
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,190
Mike!

1031
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,592
Mike, why did I
ever listen to you!

1032
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,261
Mike, help, someone!

1033
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,365
(crickets chirping)

1034
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:29,800
- 80 miles an hour Michael?

1035
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:32,002
80 miles an hour?

1036
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,170
What were you thinking!

1037
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:37,407
Well you weren't thinking,
that's the problem.

1038
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:40,544
So you met his lover, so what!

1039
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,646
You could have killed yourself!

1040
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,147
Or somebody else
for that matter!

1041
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,517
This behavior has got to stop!

1042
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:48,352
Do you hear me!

1043
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,766
(solemn music)

1044
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,325
(rushing winds)

1045
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:33,196
(light gentle music)
(metal clanking)

1046
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,371
(crowd shouting)

1047
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,773
- [Woman] We love you!

1048
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,441
You're our hero Mike!

1049
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:45,709
- [Michael] Appreciate it.

1050
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,344
Thanks for watching.

1051
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,146
- Dad?

1052
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,381
Daddy!

1053
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,251
- [Michael] All
right, I'll sign.

1054
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,652
- Where's my Dad!
- What's your name?

1055
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:56,486
- [Michael] I'll get to you.

1056
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,588
I'll get all of you.

1057
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,790
Hey, thank you.
- Dad!

1058
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:00,557
Dad!

1059
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:06,696
- [Lynn] Michael!

1060
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,834
Michael!

1061
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:11,668
- What now?

1062
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,704
- I warned you, I warned you.

1063
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,441
Michael, how many
times did I tell you?

1064
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,009
How many times did
we talk about this?

1065
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,445
I warned you that if you
stopped applying yourself,

1066
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,213
you would be on your own.

1067
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,181
- What are you talking about?

1068
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,982
I'm working my butt off.

1069
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,517
- Save it.

1070
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:28,985
You've been kicked out of SC.

1071
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,123
Your Father and I are
cutting off your money.

1072
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:35,692
- Cutting me off?

1073
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,230
How the hell do you expect
me to pay for anything?

1074
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,767
- Well, let's see.

1075
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,602
You might start
by getting a job.

1076
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:48,538
- You know, it's
a good thing he's

1077
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:49,906
not cutting your money off,

1078
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,608
or you'd have to get a job too.

1079
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,742
(Mike chuckles)

1080
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,145
- That's it, you are out.

1081
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,481
You're 20-years-old!

1082
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,849
It's time to grow up!

1083
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,695
- Whoa!

1084
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:12,896
Hey Jack.

1085
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,197
You didn't call me back.

1086
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:15,899
- I've been busy man, school.

1087
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,467
You know, life.

1088
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,036
- So can I stay here or not?

1089
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,439
- Sorry, it's my Mom.

1090
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,108
She thinks you
really lost it man.

1091
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,110
Afraid you'll burn the
house down or something.

1092
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,013
Hey look, I gotta go.

1093
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,465
- What are you doing here?

1094
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,933
Why aren't you in school?

1095
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:50,967
- I got kicked out.

1096
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:51,768
- Oh no.

1097
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,937
Did Mom go off?

1098
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:56,239
- Oh that's an understatement.

1099
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,874
Yeah, look, I need
to crash with you

1100
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,643
for a while until
I get a job, okay?

1101
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,182
Thanks sis.

1102
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,016
- [Leslie] Sure.

1103
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,156
- I don't really even have
dish washing experience.

1104
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,758
We had housekeepers.

1105
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,026
But I hope--

1106
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,694
- You're gonna be
fine Mikey, fine.

1107
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,033
(people chattering)

1108
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,912
And I'm gonna have
a special for you.

1109
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,447
Mikey, Mikey, bread, water.

1110
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,548
Come on, presto eh.

1111
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,517
I have wonderful things

1112
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,985
I'm gonna make
with my own hands--

1113
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,220
(glass shattering)

1114
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,621
Mamma mia, come on.

1115
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:45,589
Quick, pick, pick.

1116
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,893
That's Michael Landon's kid.

1117
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,695
You know, I'm
trying to train him.

1118
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,173
- Hey.

1119
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:10,714
Man.

1120
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,152
Must be something either
really good or really bad.

1121
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,157
(chips crunching)

1122
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,728
"Michael Landon's
mistress pregnant."

1123
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,099
Why do they print that stuff?

1124
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,038
Come on Les, we figured
this would happen.

1125
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:39,209
- We are already so
distanced from him.

1126
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,678
With a baby I know
it'll get worse.

1127
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:42,612
- Worse?

1128
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,847
We hardly ever see him now.

1129
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,918
- Well maybe if we get
him off by himself.

1130
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,588
You know, let him know
how we really feel.

1131
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:52,789
- Yeah.

1132
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,257
Yeah, maybe we can
tell him what we feel

1133
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,293
and he'll argue about
how we really feel.

1134
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,030
You wanna slow down
on those things?

1135
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,965
You keep eating like that
you're gonna get fat.

1136
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,001
- Dad is bad enough.

1137
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,436
I don't need it from you too.

1138
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,640
(somber music)

1139
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,177
- Les, I'm sorry!

1140
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,315
(door knocking)

1141
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,149
Hey Les!

1142
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,555
(Leslie gagging)

1143
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,025
Oh god.

1144
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,269
- I really loved
last weeks show Dad.

1145
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,275
- I think you're writing
and editing so much,

1146
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,812
you must miss directing.

1147
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,146
Not that you misdirect.

1148
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,722
- All right, let's cut
through it shall we?

1149
00:55:58,722 --> 00:55:59,823
What do you guys want?

1150
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:03,560
- Well, you know,
things have obviously

1151
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,894
been different lately,

1152
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,533
you've been so
preoccupied lately that

1153
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:13,770
we just...

1154
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:17,474
Now with Cindy pregnant,

1155
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:18,475
we're feeling like--

1156
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:23,580
- Shawna and Chris, now
they're too young to judge me.

1157
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,517
But I see that you two more than

1158
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,219
make up the
difference, don't you?

1159
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,354
Hang on.

1160
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,024
What about my right to be happy?

1161
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,394
I mean, how come you
don't want me to be happy?

1162
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,595
Kids, come on.

1163
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:39,629
I mean, what's
the matter with me

1164
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,197
being happy once in a while?

1165
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,300
- Of course we want
you to be happy.

1166
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,235
It's just that we're afraid--

1167
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,269
- What are you afraid of?

1168
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,504
Afraid of what?

1169
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,305
- Of losing you more
than we already have.

1170
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:51,975
- Michael, I'm right here.

1171
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,309
You wanna talk to me, I'm here.

1172
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,345
Talk to me, what is
it, what do you want?

1173
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:56,179
Hm?

1174
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,785
I know what you want.

1175
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,687
Son I can't give
that to you anymore.

1176
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:09,859
Listen kids, sometimes
people, they just grow apart.

1177
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:12,462
Now why does it have to
be such a big problem?

1178
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,900
- You don't get it.

1179
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,501
- I don't get what Michael?

1180
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,237
What is it that I don't get?

1181
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,772
That you two don't
want me to be happy

1182
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,707
because something has changed
between your mother and I

1183
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,943
and now you want me
to be miserable too.

1184
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:27,877
Is that it?

1185
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:28,711
Is that what I don't get?

1186
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,351
(door slamming)

1187
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,387
Now you've gone and upset Cindy.

1188
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:38,788
Are you happy?

1189
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,390
- This isn't about her!

1190
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:46,463
God I am so pissed!
(wall banging)

1191
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,531
- Go on Michael, go on!

1192
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,468
Get mad, get angry!

1193
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,038
Beat me up.

1194
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,412
(slow paced music)

1195
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,169
- My hand hurts.

1196
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:30,707
Do you got any aspirin?

1197
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,377
- I must've eaten something bad.

1198
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,826
- Even if I don't see
you do it, I can tell,

1199
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:52,128
by your bloodshot
eyes and the smell.

1200
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:53,796
You make yourself
puke every day.

1201
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,467
- Please don't tell Mom and Dad.

1202
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,737
- Promise me you're
gonna get some help.

1203
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,109
- I just thought that

1204
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,212
if I was thinner

1205
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:11,180
that Dad--

1206
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,450
- Would care about you more?

1207
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,387
We're on our own now.

1208
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,057
We gotta look out
for each other.

1209
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,293
You hear me?

1210
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,297
Come here.

1211
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,131
It's okay.

1212
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:33,970
It's okay.

1213
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:39,609
(slow paced music)

1214
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:00,563
(doorbell ringing)

1215
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,573
- Dodie, it's Lynn.

1216
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:13,309
Lynn Landon.

1217
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:15,912
- Been a long time.

1218
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,748
- I know this is years late,

1219
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,185
but I never
understood until now,

1220
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:23,553
until it happened to me.

1221
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,822
I need to apologize to you

1222
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,557
for the affair I had with Mike.

1223
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,960
I had absolutely no right.

1224
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,730
- You know, I never even
think about it anymore.

1225
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:34,931
It's ancient history.

1226
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:43,973
(light gentle music)

1227
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,780
- [Priest] To join
in holy matrimony,

1228
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,081
this man, this woman.

1229
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,952
We ask God's blessing on them

1230
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:57,920
and also upon all those

1231
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,790
gathered here this
day with them.

1232
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,892
May god cause Michael and Cindy

1233
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,462
to prosper in their
new life together.

1234
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:09,332
And may they learn
to share together

1235
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:13,136
an understanding in
joys and triumphs.

1236
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,737
- Like many of you here today,

1237
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,907
I had a hit and miss
church upbringing.

1238
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,175
I knew a lot about God,

1239
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,877
but I didn't really know Him.

1240
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,879
And that's how most people are.

1241
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,314
They know about Him, but
do they really know Him?

1242
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:27,517
And I found myself sitting

1243
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,719
in a setback in life.

1244
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,287
And when you have
a setback it's easy

1245
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,522
to keep taking a set back

1246
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,657
and I was like to prodigal Son

1247
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,661
who lost everything he
had on riotous living.

1248
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:41,297
But one day, something changed.

1249
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,367
I found my Father.

1250
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,802
God the Father.

1251
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:49,872
He changed my life
from the inside out

1252
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:54,210
and gave me a reason
to live, forever.

1253
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:04,187
(seagull squawking)

1254
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:18,067
- [Mike] Hey Dad.

1255
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,237
- Son.

1256
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:24,874
Been a while since you been out.

1257
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:27,443
Kind of like your step-brothers
coming around less and less.

1258
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:29,879
How's it going?

1259
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:31,848
- It's going okay.

1260
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,084
Shooting some industrial
videos during the day

1261
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:38,454
and still at Antonio's at night.

1262
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,225
- So how is your Mother?

1263
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:43,226
- She's doing great.

1264
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,864
- Shawna and Christ tell me

1265
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,832
she's been going to church.

1266
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:50,633
- It's true.

1267
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:53,503
- No, no.

1268
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,939
My Mother was raised
Catholic you know,

1269
01:02:58,241 --> 01:02:59,442
she always told
Dad and me we were

1270
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,144
gonna burn in hell
because we were Jewish.

1271
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,780
Of course, that was
after she made me

1272
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,549
study the Torah for a
year to get bar mitzvahs.

1273
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,718
- Did she ever make
you go to church?

1274
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:09,886
- What, you kidding me?

1275
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,389
Son, we were one of the
only two Jewish families

1276
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:14,857
in a town full of antisemetics.

1277
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,126
We couldn't even date
girls who went to church.

1278
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,163
Kids used to feel my forehead

1279
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,298
to see if I had horns or not.

1280
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,399
- Pretty stupid kids.

1281
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:24,834
- Yeah.

1282
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,103
The double whammy came
right on my bar mitzvah day.

1283
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,705
See, that's when
dear old Mom told me

1284
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,107
that it was all meaningless.

1285
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,477
Yeah, she had me
baptized as a baby

1286
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,745
without my Father
even knowing it.

1287
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,581
So it was just a joke.

1288
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:42,251
A joke she and him played to see

1289
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:43,753
who could outdo the other one.

1290
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:46,789
But do you know what?

1291
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:47,857
In spite of all that,

1292
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,327
I knew that she didn't
just find God in a book

1293
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,596
or some building somewhere.

1294
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,867
Nah, I knew that you could
find God right out here.

1295
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:00,136
Roar of the ocean.

1296
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:02,905
Your smile.

1297
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,177
The smiles of the little boy.

1298
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,147
And in my work.

1299
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,452
Now this kid from
Collingswood, New Jersey

1300
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:18,087
who's playing an angel on TV.

1301
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:19,856
I mean, go figure.

1302
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,425
- But that's actually
what I wanted

1303
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,492
to talk to you about.

1304
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,996
I was wondering if
there's something

1305
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:28,297
for me to do on "Highway."

1306
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,301
'Cause I need a real job Dad.

1307
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,572
A career I can build.

1308
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,144
- All right.

1309
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:43,045
Camera department.

1310
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:44,881
You start at the very bottom.

1311
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,215
You do exactly as you're told,

1312
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,650
and if you screw anything up,

1313
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:49,919
I don't want you to
come running to me

1314
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,454
to bail you out, you got it?

1315
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:52,822
- I won't let you down Dad.

1316
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:55,625
Thanks.

1317
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:04,066
Oh God!

1318
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:06,269
Shit.

1319
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:28,758
I'm sorry man, my
alarm didn't go off.

1320
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,360
- The cart's a mess.

1321
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,929
You're making me
look real bad man.

1322
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,232
- [Man] Come on
Junior, ready to shoot.

1323
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,202
- I can't, nothing's loaded.

1324
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:46,108
- Damn it Mike,
this is inexcusable.

1325
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,310
- I'm sorry Mr. Glenn--

1326
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,377
- No, no, no, sorry
doesn't cut it.

1327
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:49,512
You didn't do your job

1328
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:50,746
and because of your screw up,

1329
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:52,682
you're wasting a
lot of peoples time.

1330
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:55,318
I have never had a crew
that shut a company down.

1331
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:56,919
I don't care who your Father is,

1332
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,356
now you get your
lazy ass in gear,

1333
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:01,991
get the right film off the truck

1334
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,827
and loaded in five
or you're fired.

1335
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:07,563
- [Man] Okay, let's rehearse it!

1336
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,497
Let's go, come on!

1337
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,468
- [Michael] Would you
look at this picture?

1338
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,036
Is this not the
most beautiful baby

1339
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:14,971
you've ever seen
in your whole life?

1340
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,273
- [Man] I wanna see that face.

1341
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,841
- [Michael] Look
at that face huh?

1342
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:20,676
Look at her, gorgeous.

1343
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:21,811
- You do a lot of things well,

1344
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,712
but I think this is the best.

1345
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:23,779
You make great babies.

1346
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:25,047
- Well I pick great Mama's.

1347
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,215
That's the trick.

1348
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:27,616
Cindy had this
baby, look at that,

1349
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:30,152
without a hitch and
she looks really great.

1350
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,388
I got beautiful girls
and I have never

1351
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,990
been happier in my whole life.

1352
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,758
Never been happier!

1353
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:36,759
Look at this, whoa!

1354
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:37,693
Hi, hi, hi!

1355
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:43,032
(rain pouring)

1356
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:43,866
- [Mike] Hey.

1357
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,005
- I didn't see
your car out front.

1358
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,973
- [Mike] I took a
walk, I had to think.

1359
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,947
How does a man trade in
one family for another

1360
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:58,781
again and again?

1361
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:09,291
"Hey, these kids are
getting too damn old.

1362
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,861
"I'll make some younger
ones that can't talk back."

1363
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:20,136
You know, I used to feel sorry
for my step-brother Josh.

1364
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,470
(somber music)
Now I am Josh.

1365
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,941
How does a man leave his family

1366
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:27,343
and not even say he's sorry?

1367
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,945
- I don't know.
(thunder rumbling)

1368
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,114
Hell, this whole thing
could be eating him up too.

1369
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:35,251
- Every rule Dad
taught us, he's broken.

1370
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,319
He's lied, he's cheated--

1371
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:38,354
- Who doesn't?

1372
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,322
Come on, let's go inside.

1373
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,425
- Hey, maybe my childhood
was an illusion.

1374
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:46,562
Maybe it was just a
movie Dad ran, right?

1375
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:49,832
I made it all up.

1376
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:54,637
Take me home.

1377
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,540
- Where is home these days?

1378
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,553
Hey, you're wasted,
get back in the car!

1379
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:11,487
- No!

1380
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,155
I told ya, I'm going home!

1381
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,356
- Come on Mike!

1382
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:15,224
You don't even
live here anymore!

1383
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,298
Hey, I'm leaving Mike!

1384
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:23,799
(door banging)

1385
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:26,302
(dog barking)

1386
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,472
Hey, this is it Mike!

1387
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:31,240
Get in or I'm leaving!

1388
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,048
(door banging)

1389
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,083
- [Homeowner] Who is it?

1390
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:41,984
- I grew up here.

1391
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:44,120
I wanna look around.

1392
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,855
- You go away before
I call the police!

1393
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,824
- No, I just wanna
see my old room!

1394
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:50,960
- [Homeowner] Hey, I'm
gonna call the cops!

1395
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:54,597
(somber music)

1396
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:11,013
(thunder rumbling)

1397
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,325
- I need you Father.

1398
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,061
I need you.

1399
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,607
- There's some of you
that are here today

1400
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:40,643
and you realize there
must be more to life

1401
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:43,179
than just barely getting by,

1402
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,847
and you wanna change.

1403
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,983
I want every head bowed
and every eye closed.

1404
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:52,087
And some of you need to receive
the Lord into your life.

1405
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:55,891
If that's you, if you
want that change today,

1406
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:58,294
I want you to lift
your hand right now.

1407
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:04,533
And by that you're saying
"Yes God, change my life."

1408
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,287
So you editing all weekend or?

1409
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:29,391
- [Michael] Nope,
moving this weekend.

1410
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,394
- Moving?

1411
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,229
- Yeah.

1412
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,031
Cindy found a bigger
house in Malibu.

1413
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:40,102
Yeah, this way she
can ride her horses

1414
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:42,538
and I can get back
into playing tennis.

1415
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:44,039
Kids can have a pool to swim in.

1416
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:44,940
- [Man] Mr. Landon!

1417
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,476
- Yeah!

1418
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,044
My guest from
Make-A-Wish is here.

1419
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:49,845
Enjoy.

1420
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:52,448
Hey!

1421
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:53,949
Welcome to the set!

1422
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:56,385
- Glad to see you're still
keeping it simple Dad.

1423
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:57,453
- Hi.

1424
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:58,420
- Karen.

1425
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,388
Look, you look beautiful.

1426
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:00,556
- Thanks!
- Look at you!

1427
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,092
- [Michael] Come on, I
want you to meet everybody.

1428
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,760
Hey Dad, how are you?

1429
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:07,196
- This show's great for all the

1430
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,897
screwed up families out there.

1431
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,866
Which is every family I know.

1432
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:12,334
- Not mine.

1433
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:15,204
My family's always been there
for me when I needed them.

1434
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:18,507
You know, my parents,
they are so much in love,

1435
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,209
it's really wonderful
to see them.

1436
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:26,649
- Hi.

1437
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,986
(slow paced music)

1438
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,929
You know what was amazing?

1439
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:43,532
Hearing you talk about
your family the other day.

1440
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:44,933
Reminded me of my childhood.

1441
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,636
I knew if there
was a pretty face

1442
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,772
behind that voice,
I had to meet you.

1443
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:51,640
- So what took you so long?

1444
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,474
- Two weeks?

1445
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,243
Two weeks is long?

1446
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,478
- It seemed like forever to me.

1447
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,947
- [Mike] Well, your
face wasn't that pretty.

1448
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,215
- Hey.

1449
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:01,016
- It was gorgeous.

1450
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,121
I guess I just had
to find my nerve.

1451
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,433
I found my nerve,
lost my vision.

1452
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,001
- How's that?

1453
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,569
- We fogged up my glasses.

1454
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:23,238
(both laughing)

1455
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,379
(both screaming)

1456
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:31,213
Oh my God!

1457
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:37,786
(people chattering)

1458
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,522
Here you go Dad.

1459
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,590
- Hey, thank you Son.

1460
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,524
- No problem.

1461
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,792
(baby crying)

1462
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,828
- Can you imagine
living down here?

1463
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,329
I mean think about it.

1464
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,765
Trying to raise a family
under these circumstances.

1465
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,169
- I don't know how they do it.

1466
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:55,003
- I don't either.

1467
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:01,243
- You know Sheree, the
girl I've been seeing?

1468
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:02,077
- Yeah.

1469
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,781
- I've asked her to marry me.

1470
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:08,117
- You're kidding!

1471
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:12,654
Well how long you
been seeing her Son?

1472
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:13,489
- Over a year.

1473
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,291
The wedding's in December.

1474
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:17,126
- December?

1475
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,431
Congratulations Son.

1476
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,265
- [Mike] Thanks Dad.

1477
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:25,667
- Come here, come on.

1478
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,770
Of course, you know, if I
had to do it all over again,

1479
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:31,373
I'd probably wait,
a little older.

1480
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:33,008
You know, live a little.

1481
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:34,343
It's like Hemingway said,

1482
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:36,612
"True love always ends badly,"

1483
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:38,013
unless both people
are fortunate enough

1484
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:39,481
to die in the same accident.

1485
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,750
But they're just chasing misery
and they're gonna catch it.

1486
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,157
- [Woman] Can we get
craft services over here!

1487
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,592
- Come on, I'm
kidding, I'm kidding!

1488
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:53,529
Lighten up!

1489
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:54,730
Hey Andy!

1490
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,665
My 23-year-old Son's
getting married!

1491
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,100
- [Andy] That's wonderful!

1492
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:04,706
- Sorry I'm late.

1493
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,579
So, you know the tent
people just informed me

1494
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,182
that they won't guarantee
against leaks in December.

1495
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,684
So I think we should move the

1496
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:16,952
reception to a hotel.

1497
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:18,787
What do you think?

1498
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:25,060
- Who wants to hassle
with weather and tents?

1499
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:25,994
I think we should wait.

1500
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:27,162
You know, not force this.

1501
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,065
- Hassle?

1502
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:30,999
Force this?

1503
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,569
How can you even
say those words?

1504
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:34,670
What's happened?

1505
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:35,504
- Nothing.

1506
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:39,708
- Not good enough
Mike, talk to me.

1507
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:41,710
- I don't know.

1508
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,681
I was talking to my Dad--

1509
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:47,683
- Ugh, you're not
marrying your Father,

1510
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:49,418
you're marrying me.

1511
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:50,552
- Sheree, wait.

1512
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,157
And you know it's not
because I don't love ya.

1513
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:57,292
Because I do.

1514
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:00,295
Just that I'm scared.

1515
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,234
I'm scared that I'm gonna
end up just like him.

1516
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,904
You know, and leave you
and not really know why.

1517
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:11,940
- Mike, you recognize your fear,

1518
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,175
we're talking about it,

1519
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:15,711
the cycle's already broken.

1520
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:19,248
- You're right.

1521
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,018
I'm not like my Father.

1522
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:27,789
I don't need to look
to him for approval.

1523
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:33,562
I just need to look inside.

1524
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,432
And inside I find us.

1525
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,339
(light gentle music)

1526
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:45,173
(camera shutters)

1527
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:46,308
- That's good.

1528
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:47,309
That's fine.

1529
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,179
Hey Son, congratulations Son.

1530
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:52,014
- Thanks.

1531
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,184
- Awe, she's a beaut Michael.

1532
01:15:57,352 --> 01:16:00,022
She's kind, she's pretty.

1533
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:04,993
I think you two are gonna build,

1534
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:05,827
build a fine,

1535
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:09,932
fine life together Son.

1536
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:15,404
I think you finally got
everything you need.

1537
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,072
- Thanks Dad.

1538
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,675
I couldn't agree with you more.

1539
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:23,412
- All right, come on.

1540
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,147
Let's get some food.

1541
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,150
How about a drink.

1542
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:30,719
- Let's dance.

1543
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:35,857
♪ Happy anniversary to us

1544
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:40,095
♪ Happy anniversary to us

1545
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:40,929
- Wow.

1546
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:44,433
Oh, no bubbly for me.

1547
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,101
- But this is a
special occasion.

1548
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:48,337
- Doctor's orders.

1549
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,710
- What?
(Sheree giggling)

1550
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,544
What?

1551
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:58,413
Are you, are you kidding?

1552
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,816
- Congratulations Daddy.

1553
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:01,883
- I'm gonna be a Dad.

1554
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:03,552
Oh my God!

1555
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:05,621
Oh my God.

1556
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,725
- Isn't it wonderful?

1557
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:10,559
- I love you so much.

1558
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:11,393
- I love you.

1559
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:15,330
(Sheree giggling)

1560
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,199
Mom!

1561
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:21,103
Here's your first look
at your new grandchild.

1562
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:22,571
You're gonna love this.

1563
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:24,373
You can't believe how
active this little one is.

1564
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:27,843
What's wrong?
(solemn music)

1565
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,344
- [Lynn] Your Dad called.

1566
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:32,347
He'd like all the kids to
meet him down at the house.

1567
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:33,181
- [Mike] Why?

1568
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,418
- [Lynn] Just call
your Dad honey.

1569
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,654
- [Mike] Mom, just tell me.

1570
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,058
- [Lynn] Your Dad's
been diagnosed with

1571
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,127
inoperable pancreatic cancer

1572
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,195
and it doesn't look good.

1573
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,767
(Mike grunts)

1574
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:02,744
- All right, here are the rules.

1575
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,347
I want no tears.

1576
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:08,684
I want no sad faces.

1577
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,387
I want no phony
happy faces either.

1578
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:16,058
I'm gonna call a press
conference and tell everybody

1579
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:20,796
that I'm not just gonna lie
down and let this happen to me.

1580
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:26,168
And I want life
for the little ones

1581
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:28,837
to be as normal as possible,

1582
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:32,040
so you bigger kids,
I want you to limit

1583
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,109
your visitations
to weekends only.

1584
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:37,179
Okay?

1585
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:44,619
(somber music)

1586
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:09,978
- Breaker, breaker!

1587
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:11,646
I'm looking for help!

1588
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:13,515
I need alternative cancer cures!

1589
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,551
I desperately need a cure!

1590
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:17,385
Come back!

1591
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:23,992
Breaker! Breaker!

1592
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:26,161
I need medical advice!

1593
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:27,295
Is anybody out there?

1594
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:28,130
Come back!

1595
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:38,140
I need alternative cancer cures.

1596
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:41,276
I'm looking for
any kind of hope.

1597
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:57,459
- [Man] You going to talk to me

1598
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,394
or you gonna let me
sit out here and rot?

1599
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:01,997
- Jack

1600
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:04,166
- [Jack] I heard it
on the news Mike.

1601
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:05,867
I put my ears on
for old times sake

1602
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:06,802
and there you were.

1603
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:10,405
I'm so sorry man, what can I do?

1604
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:11,606
Over.

1605
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:12,908
- Tell me that I didn't
lose the best friend

1606
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:13,875
that I've ever had.

1607
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:16,545
- [Jack] I'm here.

1608
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:22,951
- Tell me that I can find
a cure before he dies.

1609
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:28,657
- God, how are ya?

1610
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,491
- [Mike] Good man.

1611
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:30,725
- You look great man.

1612
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,661
- It's good to see you!
- Good to see you too.

1613
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,062
- [Mike] Okay.

1614
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:35,997
Yeah, no, I've got
that, I've got that.

1615
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:38,066
Right, right.

1616
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,302
But does this particular drug

1617
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:41,570
work on the immune system?

1618
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:42,404
- [Man On Phone]
Well, it's looking

1619
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:43,505
very very pleasant.

1620
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,906
- Okay good.

1621
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:49,277
- No, no, it's Adenocarcinoma.
(cameras shuttering)

1622
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:50,545
Yeah, I don't know why they give

1623
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:52,214
the longest names
to the diseases

1624
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:55,951
that give you the shortest
amount of time to live.

1625
01:20:58,386 --> 01:20:59,988
What it means is
that I can't pretend

1626
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:01,056
that I have a hangnail.

1627
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:02,724
That's all.

1628
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,962
So I'm going in for
traditional chemotherapy

1629
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:10,799
and whatever alternative
medicine seem sensible.

1630
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:15,737
But hey, hey, as long
as I can still do this.

1631
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:21,109
- [Reporter] Awe,
that's great Mr. Landon.

1632
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,612
Well I guess I'm
doing all right, huh?

1633
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:27,382
- Look at him, always
putting on a show

1634
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:28,884
even when he should be resting.

1635
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,118
- [Reporter] Mr. Landon,
one more time please.

1636
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:32,053
- Your Dad belongs to the world.

1637
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:34,322
Always has.

1638
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:38,994
- I'm losing my Father.

1639
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,528
- [Michael] That's
enough, thanks.

1640
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:41,329
- And I haven't even really
- Thanks for coming out.

1641
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:42,264
- [Mike] found him yet.

1642
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:42,998
- [Michael] Appreciate it.

1643
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:48,637
- Hey Mom.

1644
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,172
- Hi honey.

1645
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:52,574
- You got a second to talk?

1646
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,975
- Well of course.

1647
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:55,410
Come on in, sit down.

1648
01:21:58,146 --> 01:21:59,614
Are you all right?

1649
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:05,520
- Tell me something about
Dad that I don't know.

1650
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,524
Something that'll make
all the pieces fit.

1651
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:12,394
- Oh Lord.

1652
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:18,300
Honey, your Dad's a
very complicated man.

1653
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,868
- But why?

1654
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:20,936
Why did he leave us?

1655
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:25,874
- I don't know for sure, but,

1656
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:28,944
do you remember how you felt

1657
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,279
when you felt like
your Dad failed us?

1658
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,247
How you fell apart?

1659
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:35,984
Imagine that happened to
you at eight years old.

1660
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,055
Your Dad told me
this story once.

1661
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,523
It was about his eighth birthday

1662
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:45,193
and he'd asked his Mom
for weeks to have a party.

1663
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:48,530
So they sent out
the invitations,

1664
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:49,965
they decorated the house,

1665
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:54,869
and an hour before the guests
were supposed to arrive,

1666
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:56,571
she canceled it.

1667
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,109
She said she didn't like
eight year old boys.

1668
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:08,283
She never celebrated him
in that house ever again.

1669
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:09,784
He felt like he didn't exist.

1670
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:13,688
It nearly destroyed him,

1671
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:17,792
and I think the thing
that hurt him the most

1672
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:21,730
was that he, he couldn't
talk to his Father about it.

1673
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:26,835
- That's why he wrote all those
shows about happy families.

1674
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,940
Because that's what he wished
his childhood had been like.

1675
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:36,444
- Don't make the
same mistake Michael.

1676
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:40,782
You talk to him.

1677
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:41,616
- I'm afraid to.

1678
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:46,354
I don't even know how
to make him listen.

1679
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,561
- Maybe you could
write him a letter.

1680
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,398
Try.

1681
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:58,967
(somber music)

1682
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,471
(rushing air)

1683
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:39,207
(metal clanking)

1684
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,852
(crowd shouting)

1685
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:54,122
- Dad?

1686
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,625
Dad!

1687
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,794
- [Michael] Thanks for
coming out, I appreciate it!

1688
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:00,595
- Dad!

1689
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,264
Dad!

1690
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:04,099
Daddy!

1691
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:07,268
Dad, where are you!

1692
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,736
Dad!

1693
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,571
Daddy!

1694
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:14,809
Leave him alone!

1695
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:16,144
He's just a man!

1696
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:18,046
He's my Dad!

1697
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,616
(metal clanking)

1698
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:30,225
(ambient music)

1699
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,761
(solemn music)

1700
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:23,378
- [Woman] Hi Michael,
we love your Father!

1701
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:26,381
(reporters talking)

1702
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:28,650
- [Man] Our prayers
are with you!

1703
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,885
- [Man] God bless!

1704
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:32,320
- [Woman] Tell him to
get well soon Michael!

1705
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,822
- [Man] He's gonna pull through!

1706
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:36,457
He can make it!

1707
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:37,625
Don't give up!

1708
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:56,377
- Hey Dad, I've been doing
some research on my own.

1709
01:26:57,612 --> 01:26:59,814
This drug is being
used in Mexico

1710
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:01,049
with amazing results.

1711
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:03,551
- Everybody's got a cure.

1712
01:27:04,919 --> 01:27:07,622
Son, do you have any
idea how many people have

1713
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:08,690
written me this week?

1714
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:11,459
- No, I mean, I understand.

1715
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:14,929
- It's all right.

1716
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:18,166
Let's take a walk.

1717
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:25,073
Son, I appreciate you
bringing the medicine.

1718
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:28,309
You gotta know, I got
a medicine cabinet

1719
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:30,745
full of miracle
cures from Mexico.

1720
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:31,746
It's not gonna work.

1721
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:35,183
Sit down.

1722
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:37,085
Come on, sit down.

1723
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:41,055
The light's pretty
here isn't it?

1724
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:42,290
- [Mike] Yeah, it's nice.

1725
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,491
- It's my favorite spot.

1726
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:52,700
- You've lost more weight Dad.

1727
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:53,501
- Yeah.

1728
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,805
The tumor's grown to
twice the size Son.

1729
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,177
It won't be long now.

1730
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:06,147
- Dad--

1731
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:08,116
- Now look Son, I'm not afraid.

1732
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:11,252
You know, I'm not
afraid to die Michael,

1733
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:12,553
I just don't wanna be kept alive

1734
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:14,455
on one of those
stinking machines.

1735
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:20,194
I mean, it's my life, right?

1736
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:21,763
And I think I'm the best judge

1737
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:24,332
of when it's over and
when it's not over.

1738
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:30,204
- Dad, there's something
that I wanna tell ya.

1739
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:32,440
- What am I gonna do
with the little kids?

1740
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:37,979
I got kids that are scared Mike.

1741
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:41,249
- Dad, there's something
that I wanna tell you, okay?

1742
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,320
I don't know where to start.

1743
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,021
- Well maybe it's best
that you didn't start Son,

1744
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:50,725
'cause I'm not feeling so
good out here after all.

1745
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:52,193
I'm gonna go on inside.

1746
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:54,095
- Dad, I have to say this!

1747
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:55,163
Now listen to me!

1748
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:57,832
- What is it Michael?

1749
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,468
- You were right.

1750
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:04,339
All along I wanted
you to be miserable.

1751
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:09,977
But it's not because
I didn't love you.

1752
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,916
'Cause I love you more than
anybody in this whole world.

1753
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:21,522
I just, I wanted you to
realize that you made a mistake

1754
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:24,492
and come back to us.

1755
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:31,966
When I was a kid Dad,
you were the best.

1756
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:37,705
You were the best.
(solemn music)

1757
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:38,539
And I miss that.

1758
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:43,678
So I'm sorry.

1759
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:50,318
- Well I'm glad you got
that off your chest.

1760
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:51,486
Son, I'm glad.

1761
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:15,076
Eye winker,

1762
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,012
Tommy tinker.

1763
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:24,619
Nose smeller,

1764
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:26,788
mouth eater,

1765
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:29,690
chin chomper.

1766
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:32,627
(Michael laughing)

1767
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,233
I'm,

1768
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:41,369
I'm a little tired.

1769
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:43,471
I'm gonna go upstairs.

1770
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:44,372
- Come here buddy.

1771
01:30:44,372 --> 01:30:45,173
- Take a rest.

1772
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:51,078
Give me a hand
up, would you Son?

1773
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:51,879
Hey.

1774
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:58,920
- [Mike] Here.

1775
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:43,531
- Those stairs are killer.

1776
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:45,700
It's deeper to breathe in.

1777
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:50,872
Listen, I'm real
sorry about all this.

1778
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:55,743
- It's okay Dad.

1779
01:31:57,278 --> 01:31:58,079
It's okay.

1780
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,559
Watch yourself.

1781
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:12,393
Watch your head.

1782
01:32:12,393 --> 01:32:13,227
- Yeah.

1783
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:19,267
Damn it would you,

1784
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,702
would you close those
blinds would ya Son?

1785
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:39,453
I'm really tired Michael.

1786
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:43,224
I think I'm gonna get some rest.

1787
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:45,426
Get a little sleep.

1788
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:47,962
Sleep.

1789
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:51,699
- I love you Dad.

1790
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:02,410
- I love you more.

1791
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:31,005
(Michael laughing)

1792
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:31,839
I got one!

1793
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:32,673
I got one!

1794
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:38,913
(kids laughing)

1795
01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:41,849
All right, you and your Mom.

1796
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:43,184
Okay, you ready?

1797
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:45,453
Okay, let's race these guys.

1798
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,122
(Mike laughing)

1799
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:56,497
- [Mike] Not a round.

1800
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:57,732
- [Michael] Get a real job!

1801
01:33:57,732 --> 01:34:00,301
For crying out loud, I'm a Dad!

1802
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:04,171
- [Mike] It's been years
since my Father's passing.

1803
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,174
I know now that he
loved me all along.

1804
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:12,179
But as I reflect on my
own life and my Father's,

1805
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:14,348
I realize that the
choices we make in life

1806
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:16,717
often twist our paths
beyond our control.

1807
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:20,688
They cause us to be and do
things we'd never accept

1808
01:34:20,688 --> 01:34:23,391
if we could step outside of
ourselves and see clearly.

1809
01:34:25,426 --> 01:34:28,496
By finally allowing
him to be just a man,

1810
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:31,265
with human frailties
and limitations,

1811
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:32,933
as well as strengths
and virtues,

1812
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,137
I was able to put aside blame,

1813
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:42,176
forgive us both, and
get on with my life.

1814
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,145
- [Little Girl] Dad's
home, Dad's home!

1815
01:34:44,145 --> 01:34:47,314
Mom, Dad's home!
(light upbeat music)

1816
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:49,984
(kids laughing)

1817
01:34:55,456 --> 01:34:57,024
- Oh!

1818
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,259
What do ya know!

1819
01:34:58,259 --> 01:34:59,627
Which one was here!
- I missed you Daddy!

1820
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:01,562
- [Mike] Give me a kiss.

1821
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:05,066
Oh hi sweetie.

1822
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:18,145
(light gentle music)
