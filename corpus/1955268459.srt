We Have No Other Option.

What's The Worst
She Could Do,
Turn Us Down?

68
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:21,460
She Could Humiliate Us,
Insult Us, Reject Us.

69
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,962
It Could Get Ugly.

70
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,464

Just So We Don't Wear
The Same Costumes.

I Don't Want To
Look Like Kelly.

00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:09,742
I Don't Want To Look
Like You, Either.

In A House Like That?

You Never Told Us
About Her.

97
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:25,758
She's Not
What You'd Call
A Close Relative.

Anything We Can Do
To Change That?

Halloween--Allhallows Eve.

It's The Yearly Festival
Of The Witches.

They Cast Their Spells

165
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:58,430
And Celebrate
Their Dark Doings
At A Gathering.

166
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,101
Since The Time
Of The Druids And Celts,

167
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,602
It Has Been So.

168
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,438
They Summon Ghosts
And Goblins

169
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:07,939
To Do Their Bidding,

170
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:13,946

00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,461
It's Kind Of
Like Bullwinkle.

00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,464
No, Bullwinkle's
Kind Of A Moose.

178
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:35,801
Ilk Is Like Friends.

179
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,170
But Witches Are Just
Make-Believe.

180
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,972
I Didn't Think
They Really Existed.

181
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,474
The Question Is Not

182
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,476
Whether You Think
Witches Exist

183
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:47,479
But Whether The Witches
Think That You Exist.

184
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,982
Are You Saying
Witches Are Real?

185
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,650
Oh, Yeah.

186
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,987
There Are Good Witches
And Bad Witches.

187
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,992
A Bad Witch Lived In
That House 200 Years Ago,

188
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:04,130
And A Bad One
Lives There Now.

189
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,601
Sit Down.
Over There.

190
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:17,009
I Knew That If I'd Called,

191
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,078
You Wouldn't Have
Wanted Us To Come.

192
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,715
You're Right.
Why Did You?

193
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,716
Well, It's Been Seven Years

194
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,019
Since I've Actually
Seen You,

195
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,021
Ever Since
Aunt Sophia Left.

196
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,524
It Must Have Been
Upsetting When She Left.

197
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,493
Upsetting? Ha Ha Ha!

198
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,028
I'm Loving It.

199
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,329
Good Riddance,
I Say!

200
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,532
I Have Never Understood
How You Could Just

201
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:43,535
Cut Off Contact
With Everybody Like That.

202
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:46,304
You've Never Even
Met Our Girls.

203
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,540
We're Family.

204
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,376
Family?

205
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,514
Family
Is Just Strangers

206
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,482
Who Happen To Be
Related.

207
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,618
I'm So Glad We Came.

[Groaning]

209
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:10,629
200 Years Ago,

210
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,933
The Townspeople Seized
The Witch Who Lived There

211
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,435
And Burned Her
At The Stake.

212
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,437
But She'd Hidden
Her Moonstone,

213
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,440
The Gem That Gave Her
Her Powers.

214
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,676
For Many Generations,
No One Could Find It,

215
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:27,947
And Then,
50 Years Ago On Halloween,

216
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,450
Two Little Girls
Just Like You
Heard The Legend

217
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,453
And Began To Look
For The Moonstone.

218
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,955
Two Girls Just Like Us?

219
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:41,961
Yep. Twins, Just Like You--
Agatha And Sophia.

220
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,970
I Win. Let's Look
For The Moonstone.

221
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,973
If We Find It,
We'll Make A Wish.

222
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,476
We'll Wish That
We're Not Twins

223
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,478
And That We're
Completely Different.

224
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,046
Splendid!

225
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:05,050
You Look In The Basement.
I'll Look In The Attic.

Sophia! Sophia!

229
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,170
Did You Find
The Moonstone?

230
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,873
I...

231
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,376
No. I Didn't Find It.

232
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,044
I've Been Thinking It Over.

233
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,080
That's Just An Old Story.
There's No Magic.

234
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,582
But The Moonstone...

235
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,117
It's Just Make-Believe.

236
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,352
You Don't Believe
In Magic, Do You?

237
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:50,356
No, I Don't
Believe In It.

238
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,899
Didn't She Share
The Moonstone
With Her Sister?

239
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,269
After That,
She Never Shared Anything.

240
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:08,406
Here. You Hold This
For A While.

241
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,909
She Learned More Spells
And Used Them

242
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,746
To Make Her Sister's Life
Miserable,

243
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,347
And Finally,
She Used The Moonstone

244
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:19,351
To Trap The Spirit
Of Her Sister

245
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,486
Inside That Very House,

246
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:24,390
And There It Remains Trapped
To This Day.

00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,491
Can't Somebody
Do Something?

00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:29,761
Oh, The Spell
Can Only Be Broken

At Midnight On Halloween.

250
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,365
How?

251
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,935
Well, Someone Would Have
To Rub The Moonstone

252
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,937
And Say
The Right Incantation--

253
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,372
What's
An Incantation?

254
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,874
It's Magic Words
Like Abracadabra,

255
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:45,877

To The Dark Side
Of The Moon.

You See, I Live
Where The Sun Always Shines

261
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,761
And It Never Gets Dark.

262

As Far Back
As I Can Remember,

365
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,313
Aunt Sophia Was Just
So Kind And Generous,

366
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,315

00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,817

What Happened
To Aunt Sophia?

371
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:38,263
Well, About Seven Years Ago,
Aunt Sophia Met A Nice Man,

372
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,098
And They Got Engaged,

373
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:44,035
And I Guess They Must Have
Run Off Together.

374
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,438
Didn't She Call
Or Write?

375
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:49,307
No. That Was
The Strange Part.

376

00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,337

00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:11,122
Is...Because We've

They Just Want
To Be Recognized
As Individuals.

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,842
That's Fair Enough.

455
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,843
It's Hard For Twins,
Though.

To The Idea.

Gathering,

We Can Get
The Moonstone.

I'm Open
To The Idea.

478
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:34,592
I Didn't Say I'd
Go To A Witches'
Gathering.

00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,727
We'll Improvise.

480
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:39,764
We Should
Explain This
To Mom And Dad.

481
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,265

I Can Just Imagine
Them Saying That.

485
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:52,510
Maybe They Can Help Us
Figure It Out.

486
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,113
We'll Do This
On Our Own.

487
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,282
I Guess So.

488
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,286
If We Disappear
Like Aunt Sophia,

489
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,787

Where Are The Girls?

531
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:18,189
Have They
Fallen Behind?

532
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,190

537
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,709
Nah, Someplace Spooky.

538

Somebody Who Knows.

I'll Toss A Penny.

540
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,715
If It's Heads,

00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:47,218
We Keep Going
In That Direction.

00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:50,722
Hey!

543
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,225
You Could Kill
Somebody Like That!

544
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,727
Unless It Was
A Silver Dollar,

545
00:29:56,727 --> 00:29:58,229
Then You'd Be
Forgiven.

546
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,730
Where's He Going?

547
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,766
Under The Bridge.

548
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:11,475
What Are You Doing
Down There?

549
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:13,878
This Is My...
Humble Home.

550
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,880
If You Had A Door,

551
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,582
We Would Have
Knocked First.

552
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:19,984
If You're Homeless,

553
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,987
There's A Place
Downtown That
Can Help You.

554
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,490
I Saw It
On The News.

555
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,658
Who Are You Two,

556
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:30,261
Dear Abby
And Ann Landers?

557
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:34,465
I Don't Want A Handout.
I Want To Be Rich.

558
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,968
No! Not Just Rich.

559
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:41,706
I Want To Be...
Filthy Rich!

560
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,208
Ramone, Bring
The Ferrari Around.

561
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,211
I Think I'll Drive It
Myself Today.

562
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:50,348
Ho Ho Ho!
Lots Of Money

563
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,283
And Wonderful Things--

564
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,785
Planes And Houses,

565
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:56,787
A House
On The Islands.

566
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:59,290
I Need...New Shoes.

567
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,125
Yes! Yes!

568
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:04,862
Wait A Minute.

569
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,297
Blond.

570
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,465
Two Young Blond--

571
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:10,300
Oh, Yes!

572
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,571
I Think I Remember.

573
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:19,443
Don't I Know You?

574
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:21,445
You're
The Windshield Guy.

575
00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:24,949
We Always See You
On That Corner
Over There.

576
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,752
You're The Ones
That Gave Me

577
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,320
The Pineapple
Lollipops.

578
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,458
You...You Shouldn't
Be Here Alone.

579
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,194
What Are You Doing
By Yourselves?

580
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:39,197
You Should Go Home.

581
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,899
Not Until We Get
Aunt Agatha's
Moonstone.

582
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:44,902
And Break
The Magic Spell
On Aunt Sophia.

583
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,236
Hold It.

584
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:48,740
Time-Out.
Un Momento,
Por Favor.

585
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,742
You Lost Me
Back At The Part

586
00:31:51,742 --> 00:31:53,244
About
The Moonstone.

587
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,946
What Is
A Moonstone?

588
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,614
It's This Gem
That She Has.

589
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:58,683
Gem?

590
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,684
Is It Valuable?

591
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:02,787
Oh, Yes.
200 Years Old.

592
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:03,921
Interesting.

593
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,923
And You're
Going To Get

594
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,925
This Gem
By Yourselves?

595
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,260
Sure.

596
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,194
Hmm...

597
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,762
Two Little Girls

598
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:14,098
Traveling
With An Expensive Gemstone.

599
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,600
Someone Might
Try To Steal It.

600
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,603
I'd Better Go Along
And Protect You.

601
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:21,605
It Could
Come In Handy

602
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:23,107
Having A Grownup
Along.

603
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,108
O.K., Mr...

604
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,710
Plato Naufzagger.

605
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,978
A Plate Of What?

606
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,847
Just Call Me
Mr. N For Short.

607
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:30,915
I'm Kelly.

608
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:31,916
I'm Lynn.

609
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,317
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

610
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:34,819
We Know
Aunt Agatha's

611
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,821
Going To A Witches'
Gathering,

612
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,824
But We Don't Know
Where It Is.

613
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,827
Do You Know Where
It Could Be?

614
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,328
She's In A Group.

615
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:46,330
Halloween Brings Out
The Loonies.

616
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,831
Speaking Of Loonies,

617
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:51,101
I Know The One
Who Might Help Us.

618
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:52,670
She's Not Far.

619
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:59,009
When Will
She Love Me?

620
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,578
Any Day.

621
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,179
Any Day Now.

622
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:05,349
Uh...Madame Lulu.

623
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:06,417
Next.

624
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,418
Madame Lulu,

625
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:10,421
Could I Have
A Word With You?

626
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,424
Don't Stand In The Way
Of Paying Customers.

627
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,425
Uh...Lulu,

628
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,694
These Young Ladies
Need Advice.

629
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,130
Do You Have $5.00?

630
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,231
Next.

631
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,732
Lulu! Ha Ha Ha!

632
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:25,736
How Would You Like
For Me To Tell
These Nice People

633
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:28,538
That You're Not
From Romania,
But Brooklyn?

634
00:33:28,538 --> 00:33:30,207
I'll Tell
These Girls

635
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:32,710
The Closest
You've Been
To Buckingham Palace

636
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,212
Is A Royal Flush.

637
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:37,915
O.K., Make It Fast.

638
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,717
Their Aunt
Is Going

639
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,286
To Some Sort Of Witches'
Gathering Tonight.

640
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,289
Since All These Loonies
Come To You,

641
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,291
You May Know
Where They're
Getting Together.

642
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,294
I Have No Idea.
Next!

643
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,297
But Can't You Look
Into Your Crystal Ball?

644
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:56,300
What Are You, Nuts?

645
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,803
What Are You,
A Phony Baloney?

646
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,238
All Right.

647
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,739
All Right.

648
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,244
Yes. The Vision
Is Coming To Me Now.

649
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:10,247
I See A Gathering
High On A Mountaintop

650
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:12,750
Where Owls Call.
Hoo! Hoo!

651
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,751
O.K.?

652
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,252
Now Beat It.

653
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:17,254
Can't You Be
More Specific,

654
00:34:17,254 --> 00:34:19,256
Like How
You Get There?

655
00:34:19,256 --> 00:34:22,260
For A $5.00 Iou,
You Want A Map?

656
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,263
What'd She Do
To My Crystal Ball?

657
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,764
What's Going On?

658
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,265
I Recognize
That Joint.

659
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:30,267
The Gathering
Must Be Down

660
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:32,769
In The Old Abandoned
Warehouse District.

661
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:33,771
On Halloween?

662
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,272
That's Pretty Good,
Lulu.

663
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:36,774
All This Time,

664
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,276
I Thought
You Were A Fake.

665
00:34:39,276 --> 00:34:42,280
Has She Been
Doing This
For Very Long?

666
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,855
We Have
A Long Way To Go,

667
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:53,057
But Here's Our Bus.

668
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,658
A Pumpkin Truck?

669
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:55,526
Ha Ha!

670
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,863
Keep A Lookout.

671
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,874
Well, Here We Are.

672
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:13,077
If There Were
Any Justice,

673
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:16,080
I Would Have A Limo
And A Chauffeur.

674
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,582
And A Bill
You Couldn't Pay.

675
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:19,583
Yes, Ladies,

676
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,084
Money Is The Key,

677
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:23,588
And I Want
Lots Of It.

678
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,090
Have You Ever
Worked For It?

679
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,892
Hey, There Are Limits.

680
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:30,894
Besides Saving Your House

681
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:33,397
And Finding
Your Long-Lost Aunt,

682
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:36,433
What Else Are You
Going To Wish For?

683
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:38,636
I Want To Be
A Doctor.

684
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,738
I Wanted To Be
A Doctor First.

685
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,973
We Can Both
Be Doctors.

686
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:44,175
Yes.

687
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,577
I Would Like To Be
A Doctor, Also.

688
00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:49,914
So You Can Save
People's Lives?

689
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:54,685
So I Can Pull Down
300 Grand A Year

690
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,186
And Drive A Mercedes.

691
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:57,688
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

692
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:03,627
? I Know A Song That Gets
On Everybody's Nerves ?

693
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:05,195
? Everybody's Nerves ?

694
00:36:05,195 --> 00:36:09,200
? I Know A Song That Gets
On Everybody's Nerves ?

695
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,701
? Everybody's Nerves ?

696
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,103
? Everybody's Nerves ?

697
00:36:13,103 --> 00:36:16,606
? I Know A Song That Gets
On Everybody's Nerves ?

698
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:19,209
? And This Is
How It Goes ?

699
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:20,878
? Boom Boom ??

700
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:27,718
Oh! Yeah--

701
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,723
He's Turned
Off The Road

702
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,725
We Need To Be On.

703
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,727
You're Going
The Wrong Way.

704
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,729
We've Got To Get Off.

705
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,230
Not Until He Stops.

706
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,231
No Way.

707
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:42,233
Oh!

708
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:45,069
Way!

709
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:45,069
Way!

710
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,673
Excuse Me, Dude.

711
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,673
Ooh! Ooh!

712
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:50,942
[Screaming]

713
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,924
[Humming]

714
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:09,259
Hey!

715
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:10,260
My Pumpkins!

716
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,762
Run!

717
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,530
Come Back Here!

718
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,631
Quickly! Run!

719
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:16,633
Let's Get
Out Of Here!

720
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:18,102
I'm With You!

721
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:26,944
You Girls Are Fast.

722
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,947
I Have Trouble
Keeping Up With You.

723
00:37:38,455 --> 00:37:40,457
I Think
We've Lost Him.

724
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:41,458
And Us.

725
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:44,461
I Feel Bad About
That Poor Man

726
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:45,963
And His Pumpkins.

727
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,964
I Will
Compensate Him

728
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:50,968
At Our Earliest
Possible Opportunity.

729
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,971
Which Way
Do We Go?

730
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,972
Well, Uh...
Hmm...

731
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:57,975
We're Lost,
Aren't We?

732
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,476
Don't Be Silly.

733
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:01,478
We're,
Uh...Hmm...

734
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:03,147
We Know
Where We Are.

735
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,681
We Just Don't Know

736
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:06,183
Where
Everything Else Is.

737
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,685
Let's Try
This Way.

738
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,494
Did You Know
That On Halloween

739
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:19,496
Goblins
Roam The Land?

740
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:23,000
And Ghosts
And Witches And Ilk?

741
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,003
Oh, This Is Just
Silly Superstition.

742
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,504
Ha Ha Ha!

743
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:28,505
[Owl Hoots]

744
00:38:28,505 --> 00:38:30,006
Aah! Don't Hurt Me!

745
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:31,509
What Was That?

746
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,511
I Think That Was
Just An Owl.

747
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:36,513
Oh!
Of Course It Was.

748
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:38,516
I Was
Only Testing You.

749
00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:42,519
Maybe You Should
Go Ahead

750
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,521
And Make Sure
Nothing's There.

751
00:38:44,521 --> 00:38:45,522
Me?

752
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:46,891
You're The Adult.

753
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,661
I Should Go Back
To My Bridge.

754
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,564
I Thought You Were
Going To Help Us

755
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,065
Get The Moonstone.

756
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:56,567
About This Moonstone--

757
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,169
Now, Is This
One Of Those...

758
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:02,740
Teeny-Weeny,
Little Gems?

759
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,842
Humongous!

760
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,346
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

761
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:11,348
I Was Just Kidding!

762
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,650
Of Course,

763
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,654
I Would Never Leave
You Two On Your Own.

764
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,923
We're In Big Trouble.

765
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:21,425
Look!
There's A House!

766
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,499
You See, I Knew That
That House Was There.

767
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,034
Give Me A Break.

768
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,380
Looks Like A Really
Little House.

769
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,882
No, No, No, No.

770
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,384
You See,
It Only Looks Small

771
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:50,387
Because
It's So Far Off
Into The Distance.

772
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:52,389
It's Called
The Perspective
Effect.

773
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,393
We Have Quite A Hike
Ahead Of Us.

774
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,901
I Guess It's Not

775
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,903
The Perspective
Effect After All.

776
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,146
The Lights Are On.

777
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:18,149
Somebody
Must Be In There.

778
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:21,118
Yeah. Somebody
With A Heck
Of A Backache.

779
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:26,056
You're On Your Own.

780
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,359
I Can't Fit
In There.

781
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,861
Hello?

782
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,329
Hello?

783
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,767
Hello?

784
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,770
You Have To Call
Louder Than That.

785
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,372
You Do It.

786
00:40:42,372 --> 00:40:44,375
Hello?

787
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:56,053
? Ba Da Pa
Ba Do Ba Da ?

788
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,554
? Do Da Do Da Da ?

789
00:40:57,554 --> 00:40:59,056
? Ba De Da Da ?

790
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,291
? Ba Be Do
Ba Ba Da ?

791
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,893
? Ba Ba Ba-- ??

792
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,895
What Are You
Doing Here?

793
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:08,532
Mr. N Was Showing Us
The Shortcut,

794
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,534
And We Saw Your House.

795
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,036
We Knocked,
But You Didn't Answer.

796
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:15,272
One Thing At A Time.

797
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,406
Who's Mr. N?

798
00:41:16,406 --> 00:41:17,441
Our Friend.

799
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,243
That's Him
At The Window.

800
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:24,914
How Do You Do?

801
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:28,652
You Have A Very
Nice Place Here.

802
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,687
Aren't You
Oscar The Clown?

803
00:41:30,687 --> 00:41:34,858
Yes. I Remember
You Two.

804
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:36,460
You Seem Mad.

805
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,362
I'm Not Mad.

806
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,863
It's Just--

807
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:40,865
Well...

808
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,368
I Usually Don't Let
Anybody See Me

809
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:47,371
Out Of
My Clown Outfit.

810
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:51,041
People Laugh With Me
When I'm A Clown.

811
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,709
Ta-Da!

812
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:55,312
Oscar,
The Clown Of Renown,

813
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,379
The Fabulous,

814
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:57,647
The Fantastic,

815
00:41:57,647 --> 00:42:00,885
The Extraordinary!

816
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,720
[Honking]

817
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:11,695
But...When I'm Just
A Little Person,

818
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,965
Sometimes People
Laugh At Me.

819
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,404
So...I Stay Here...
Alone...

820
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:23,407
In Front
Of My Mirror,

821
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,913
And I Pretend
That I Really Am...

822
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:33,717
Fabulous, Fantastic,
Extraordinary.

823
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:37,187
Oscar,
We Would Never
Make Fun Of You.

824
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,422
We're Little Ourselves.

825
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,927
So You Are.

826
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,864
And You Still
Have The Wand.

827
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:51,034
Anything Strange
Happen To You Today?

828
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:53,870
Being Here
Is The Strangest
Part So Far.

829
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,872
Oscar,
Could You Help Us

830
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:58,342
Get To The Edge
Of Town?

831
00:42:58,342 --> 00:42:59,343
How Come?

832
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,345
We Better Tell Him
The Whole Story.

833
00:43:02,345 --> 00:43:04,582
No. Not The Whole Story.

834
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,452
They're Enjoying
Themselves.

835
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:11,455
They're Acting Like
They Don't Have A Care.

836
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:15,558
And So,

837
00:43:15,558 --> 00:43:19,062
We Have To Break
The Magic Spell
By Midnight.

838
00:43:19,062 --> 00:43:21,765
This Could Be
A Fantastic
Adventure,

839
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,767
Not Without Risk,
Of Course.

840
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,769
But What Great
Adventure Isn't?

841
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,271
We Have
No Time To Lose.

842
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:29,806
Ladies,

843
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:32,109
I Find Parts
Of That Story

844
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,510
Rather Hard
To Believe.

845
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,781
The Problem Is That
As People Get Bigger,

846
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,282
Their Imaginations
Get Smaller.

847
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:42,152
You'll Take Us
To The Gathering?

848
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,654
Of Course I Will!

849
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,789
We Have To Be
Prepared.

850
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,528
They're Coming
To The Gathering.

851
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,796
Wonderful!

852
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,033
Soon I'll Have
Those Two Little Girls

853
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:59,169
Right Where
I Want Them.

854
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,671
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

855
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,940
Ha Ha Ha!

856
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:08,311
Ta-Da!
The Oscarmobile!

857
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:11,314
Wait! Wait!
What About Me?

858
00:44:11,314 --> 00:44:13,984
Hang On Tight!

859
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:20,824
Oh!

860
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:24,828
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

861
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,833
Hee Hee Hee Hee!

862
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:42,880
I Love Halloween.

863
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,494
Step On It.

864
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:00,363
We're Already Exceeding
The Speed Limit.

865
00:45:00,363 --> 00:45:02,899
Silence! I Want You
To Drive Faster.

866
00:45:02,899 --> 00:45:05,368
I Assume
I Should Pause
At Red Lights.

867
00:45:05,368 --> 00:45:07,804
Do I Pay You
To Assume?

868
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:10,473
No, Madam.
You Pay Me Nothing.

869
00:45:10,473 --> 00:45:12,976
You Get
What You Pay For.

870
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,477
Shut Up And Drive!

871
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:16,814
I'll Worry About
The Red Lights.

872
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:28,759
Come On. Hurry
With Your Make-Up.

873
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,766
They've
Got Enough Candy

874
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,768
To Last Them
A Decade Or Two.

875
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:41,271
I Think So.
Let's Go Home.

876
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:44,775
It Was A Battle
Getting Them Home
Last Year.

877
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,276
Lynn, Kelly, Come On!

878
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,277
Daddy's Turning
Into A Pumpkin.

879
00:45:48,277 --> 00:45:50,280
Come On.
Let's Go Home.

880
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,688
We Won't
Go Home With You.

881
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:02,025
We Want To Go
To Our Own Homes.

882
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:12,235
They Didn't Say Why.

883
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:14,237
They Just Wanted
To Do It.

884
00:46:14,237 --> 00:46:17,206
They Didn't Say Where
They Were Going?

885
00:46:17,206 --> 00:46:18,208
No.

886
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,976
Let's Go To The Police.

887
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:21,845
You Read My Mind.
Thanks.

888
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:24,848
I'll Bet This
Is Just A Halloween Trick.

889
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:27,851
I'm Sure Your Twins
Are Safe And Sound,

890
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,187
Having A Great Time
With Friends.

891
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:35,993
This Is The Place.

892
00:46:48,671 --> 00:46:50,007
Come On!

893
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,174
Your Turn.

894
00:46:51,174 --> 00:46:52,309
Come On!

895
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:03,319
How Are We Going To
Get Past This Guy?

896
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:04,887
I'll Do The Talking.

897
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:07,324
Invitations, Please.

898
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,526
Uh, This Is
My Covenant.

899
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,865
I Had Our Invitation.
My Black Cat Ate It.

900
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,835
You Have
A Problem With That?

901
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:23,841
No.

902
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:35,519
? Ah Ah Ahh Ah ?

903
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:41,691
? Ah Ah Ah Ahh Ah Ah ?

904
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:47,697
? Ah Ah Ah Ah Ahh Ah ?

905
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:51,401
? Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah ?

906
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:54,003
They've Been Reading
Too Much Stephen King.

907
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:55,705
You See Aunt Agatha?

908
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:58,775
No, But This Is
Definitely Her Ilk.

909
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:06,383
? Ah Ah Ah Ah Ahh Ah ?

910
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:09,820
? Ahh ??

911
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,723
[Applause]

912
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:23,066
She's
The Elizabeth Taylor
Of The Weirdoes.

913
00:48:26,135 --> 00:48:28,638
What If She Sees Us?

914
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:32,175
We're History.
Pull Down Your Hood,
And She Won't.

915
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:36,179
I Always Put In
Eye Of Newt,
Toe Of Frog,

916
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,149
Wool Of Bat,
And...Tongue Of Dog.

917
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,650
Yuck!

918
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,650
Yuck!

919
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,652
Do You Use
A Microwave?

920
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:45,154
No. It Just Doesn't
Brown The Same.

921
00:48:45,154 --> 00:48:46,356
Agatha,

922
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,359
Will You Lead Us
In The Invocation?

923
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,627
Oh, Certainly.

924
00:48:54,330 --> 00:49:00,837
? Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm ?

925
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:06,175
? Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah ??

926
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:11,181
Fair Is Foul,
And Foul Is Fair.

927
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:14,484
Hover Through
The Filthy Air.

928
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,587
Double, Double,
Toil And Trouble,

929
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:23,160
Fire Burn,
Cauldron Bubble!

930
00:49:26,562 --> 00:49:27,564
Moving.

931
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,269
Thank You.

932
00:49:34,203 --> 00:49:35,939
First Of All,

933
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:39,109
Our Thanks
To Our Glee Club.

934
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:42,345
A-One, A-Two, A-Three.

935
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:44,647
Ah!

936
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:44,647
Ah!

937
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:44,647
Ah!

938
00:49:44,647 --> 00:49:49,586
We'll Have Our Cassettes
On Sale On The Way Out.

939
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,588
I Can't Wait To Get
One Of Those.

940
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:54,090
Your Membership Dues

941
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,092
Were Supposed To Be Paid.

942
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:59,262
Some Of You Haven't
Paid Them Yet.

943
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,764
You Know Who You Are.

944
00:50:01,764 --> 00:50:03,600
If You Don't Pay Tonight,

945
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,236
It Could Be Toadtime.

946
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,371
Also, The Caretaker Tells Us

947
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:13,176
There Are Some People Living
In This Neighborhood,

948
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:16,179
So Later,
When We Cast Our Spells,

949
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:20,450
He Asks That We Keep
Our Moaning And Shrieking

950
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,185
Down To A Reasonable Level.

951
00:50:23,185 --> 00:50:26,189
And I'm Sorry To Tell You

952
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,493
That Our Truckload
Of Pumpkins Didn't Show Up.

953
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:33,129
Mr. Gonzales, Who Has Always
Been Very Dependable,

954
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:36,633
Called To Say
He Was Waylaid
By A Ruffian.

955
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:39,068
Those Pumpkins.

956
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:40,604
And Finally,

957
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:44,907
I Know We'll All Wish To
Extend Our Congratulations

958
00:50:44,907 --> 00:50:47,176
To Fred And Marcia.

959
00:50:47,176 --> 00:50:49,279
Where Are You?

960
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,318
Who Have A New Addition
To Their Household!

961
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,786
What Is It, Fred?

962
00:50:56,786 --> 00:50:58,287
It's A Goblin.

963
00:50:58,287 --> 00:50:59,822
[Grunting And Squealing]

964
00:50:59,822 --> 00:51:01,891
Aw.

965
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:05,095
Aw, The Patter
Of Little Hooves.

966
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:06,595
Remember
How Fairy Tales

967
00:51:06,595 --> 00:51:08,597
Used To
Keep Me Awake?

968
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:11,101
If We Get Out
Of This,

969
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,603
I'll Be Awake
Until I'm 21.

970
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,605
All Right, So Much
For Old Business!

971
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:18,475
Now, Who Has New Business?

972
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,477
Oh, I Do. I Do.

973
00:51:22,645 --> 00:51:24,346
My Colleagues,

974
00:51:24,346 --> 00:51:26,649
Gatherers,
Comrades...

975
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:28,385
Count?

976
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:33,490
Um, Before I Begin
Our Convolution

977
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,491
And The Cry Of Curses,

978
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:37,994
Let Me First Mention
An Emergency

979
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:41,297
That I See
As A Juicy Challenge

980
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:42,966
For The Entire Group,

981
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,468
One That I Think
You Will Enjoy

982
00:51:45,468 --> 00:51:46,636
Helping Me To Solve.

983
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:51,007
Seven Years Ago,
I Cast A Powerful Spell,

984
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,310
A Spell That Banished

985
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,512
My Sweet, Namby-Pamby
Twin Sister

986
00:51:56,512 --> 00:51:59,182
To A Life
Of Lonely Isolation

987
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:02,352
On The Other Side
Of A Mirror.

988
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,920
[Applause]

989
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,957
Naughty Me.

990
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,793
She's Good.
She Is Very Good.

991
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:13,796
Oscar, Let's Go.
I Have An Idea.

992
00:52:13,796 --> 00:52:15,297
The Spell
Becomes Permanent...

993
00:52:15,297 --> 00:52:16,800
Come On. Follow Me.

994
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,303
There Are Those Who Would
Interfere With My Spell,

995
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,305
Who Seek To Undo
All My Bad Work.

996
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:26,876
The Ones Who Resist Me
Are Very Young.

997
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:29,678
Kids These Days
Have No Respect.

998
00:52:29,678 --> 00:52:32,048
Children Are Sick!

999
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,284
The Ones Who Resist Me
Are Sisters--Twins.

1000
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:37,287
Why Have I Asked For Help?

1001
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,821
Why?

1002
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,821
Why?

1003
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:39,822
Why?

1004
00:52:39,822 --> 00:52:41,624
The Twins Are Among Us!

1005
00:52:41,624 --> 00:52:45,127
I'd Like To Get My Hands
On Those Twins.

1006
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:48,231
Those Little Brats!

1007
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,638
I Have The Answer.

1008
00:52:55,638 --> 00:52:58,608
I've Not Seen You
Before.

1009
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,343
Who Are You?

1010
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,146
I Am Brother Grimsby.

1011
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:08,385
I Come To This Gathering
From Far, Far Away,

1012
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,387
From The Land
Of The Adder's Fork

1013
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:13,657
And The Blind Bird's Sting,

1014
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,392
From The Lizard's Leg
And The Hornet's Wing.

1015
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:18,695
I Come From A Land Where--

1016
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,729
All Right!

1017
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,365
All Right! What's
Your Suggestion?

1018
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,702
I Have A Spell That
Will Double The Power

1019
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,036
Of Your Moonstone,

1020
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:30,206
But You Must Put It
In My Hand.

1021
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:34,043
How Do You Know
About My Moonstone?

1022
00:53:34,043 --> 00:53:36,046
I Know All.

1023
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,382
I See All.

1024
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,886
Would You Not Like Me
To Double Your Power...

1025
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,888
At No Cost To You,
Of Course?

1026
00:53:45,888 --> 00:53:48,391
Or Do You Doubt My Power?

1027
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:52,128
Now That You
Mention It, Yes.

1028
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,030
Very Well.

1029
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,567
I Will Let
The Cauldron Speak.

1030
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,401
O Great Receptacle

1031
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:02,071
Of Smoke And Spirit,

1032
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:06,009
Do You Verify My Power?

1033
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,151
Well?

1034
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,254
Good Stuff.

1035
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:21,090
Do You Accept
My Offer?

1036
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,661
It Will Double
Your Power.

1037
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:28,597
Double My Power?

1038
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:30,100
Yes.

1039
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,101
All Right.

1040
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:34,237
I Accept Your Offer.

1041
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:38,274
And What About The Twins?

1042
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,409
The New And Improved
Moonstone

1043
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:42,912
Will Point Them Out
To Us,

1044
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:46,015
And We Can All
Deal With Them.

1045
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,585
I Like The Way You Think!

1046
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,624
My Incantation To
The Forces Of Evil.

1047
00:54:55,624 --> 00:54:58,661
O Forces Of Evil...

1048
00:54:58,661 --> 00:55:02,431
? Oh Ee Oh Ah Ah ?

1049
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:03,900
? Ting Tang ?

1050
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,901
? Walla Walla
Bing Bang ??

1051
00:55:05,901 --> 00:55:08,772
Aah!

1052
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,107
Trickery!

1053
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,275
Skullduggery!

1054
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:16,579
Oh, Stop Them
And Find Those Twins!

1055
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,381
There They Are!

1056
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,685
I've Been Hoodwinked!

1057
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,152
Trickery!

1058
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:24,487
Run!

1059
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,792
Look! There They Are!

1060
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,662
I Hate This!

1061
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,665
You Didn't Want To Tell
Mom And Dad!

1062
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,866
Seize Them!

1063
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,669
[Oscar]
Hurry! They're
Right Behind Us!

1064
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,537
[Agatha]
Seize Them!

1065
00:55:41,537 --> 00:55:42,905
Seize Those Twins!

1066
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:45,075
Seize Them!

1067
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,616
They're Over Here!
This Way!

1068
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:56,619
They Can't Have
Gotten Very Far!

1069
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,189
I Got It!

1070
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:02,191
Who Wants
To Keep It?

1071
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:03,693
I Will.

1072
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,395
Why You?

1073
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:06,896
I'm The Biggest.

1074
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,397
You Might Run Off.

1075
00:56:08,397 --> 00:56:10,533
Oscar, No Trust--

1076
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,170
That Is What Is Wrong
With The World Today.

1077
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:17,206
How Do We Know That
You Won't Run Off?

1078
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:20,376
Cut It Out.
They're Coming.
I'll Take It.

1079
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,745
What Will We Do?

1080
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,713
Split Up.

1081
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,214
We Should
Stay Together.

1082
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:27,717
It's The Only Chance
Of Escaping.

1083
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,085
We'll Go This Way.

1084
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,586
You Go That Way.

1085
00:56:30,586 --> 00:56:32,988
Sure. You Go
With The Moonstone.

1086
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:34,490
[Agatha]
Over This Way!

1087
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,058
By The Cars!

1088
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:38,994
We Meet Up Again
At The Oscarmobile.

1089
00:56:38,994 --> 00:56:40,130
Come On!

1090
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,233
Good Luck, Kelly.

1091
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,701
Good Luck, Lynn.

1092
00:56:47,236 --> 00:56:50,239
Touching, But Could
We Get A Move On?

1093
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:51,708
Go!

1094
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,250
Drat! Drat!

1095
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:05,655
If We Don't Find Them,
I'm Taking It Out On You!

1096
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:08,724
There They Go!

1097
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:10,426
After Them! Follow Them!

1098
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,761
Head Them Off

1099
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:16,265
And Bring Them Back
For Their Punishment!

1100
00:57:16,265 --> 00:57:19,836
Hey, Wait For Me!
I'm In Heels, You Know.

1101
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,708
Look, Folks,
It's Halloween.

1102
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,376
Kids Play Tricks
And Pranks.

1103
00:57:27,376 --> 00:57:28,878
But They're Only 7.

1104
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,381
I'll Put Out A Code,
All Units.

1105
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,550
One Of You Go Home,
Call Their Friends,

1106
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,285
And See If They Haven't
Just Gone Visiting.

1107
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:38,788
Retrace Their
Trick-Or-Treating Route

1108
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,290
And Ask If Anybody's
Seen Them.

1109
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,293
What About A Missing
Person's Report?

1110
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,927
They've Been Gone
Two Hours.

1111
00:57:44,927 --> 00:57:46,929
They Ran Off
Deliberately.

1112
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:49,932
Make Those Calls
And Get Back To Me.

1113
00:57:49,932 --> 00:57:51,434
All Right. Thank You.

1114
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,102
I Overheard.

1115
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,804
It's Probably
All Very Innocent.

1116
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,271
I'm Heading Back Out.

1117
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:58,941
I'll Make A Few Inquiries.

1118
00:57:58,941 --> 00:58:01,043
Thank You.
We'd Appreciate That.

1119
00:58:01,043 --> 00:58:03,446
I Got Two Of My Own.

1120
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,115
It's Not Like Them.
Neither Would Run Away.

1121
00:58:11,787 --> 00:58:13,622
Up There! Up There!

1122
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:16,058
What If It's A Dead End?

1123
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:17,560
It's Not. Trust Me.

1124
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,564
It's A Dead End.

1125
00:58:22,564 --> 00:58:24,567
Read The Sign.

1126
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:28,238
[Agatha]
You've Run Into
A Dead End!

1127
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,238
This Way!

1128
00:58:29,238 --> 00:58:31,073
How Convenient!

1129
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:33,042
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

1130
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:41,084
Hurry! Hurry!

1131
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:47,090
Good. We'll Be
Safe In Here...

1132
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,559
Wherever We Are.

1133
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,095
You're Trapped In There!

1134
00:58:53,095 --> 00:58:55,598
She Doesn't Know
Where We Are.

1135
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,700
We're Watching The Stairway,

1136
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,835
And We're Watching
The Elevator!

1137
00:58:59,835 --> 00:59:04,106
Give Yourselves Up Now!

1138
00:59:04,106 --> 00:59:06,608
I Have A Plan!

1139
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:08,611
This Ought
To Be Good.

1140
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:11,113
Do You Want To Hear It?

1141
00:59:11,113 --> 00:59:12,615
Yes.

1142
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:15,117
I'll Go Down
And Tell Her

1143
00:59:15,117 --> 00:59:17,620
That We Haven't Got
The Moonstone,

1144
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,123
That Lynn And Oscar
Have It.

1145
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,624
They'll Throw It
Off A Bridge

1146
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:24,627
So It Can't Do Harm.

1147
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:27,263
She Still Won't
Let Us Go.

1148
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:30,466
But You're Not Reckoning
With The Persuasive Charms

1149
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,603
Of The Silver-Tongued Mr. N.

1150
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:39,341
You've Decided
To Give Yourself Up?

1151
00:59:39,341 --> 00:59:40,943
Where's The Brat?

1152
00:59:40,943 --> 00:59:44,480
I'm Not Giving Up.
I Am Negotiating.

1153
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,082
What Are You
Talking About?

1154
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:49,252
Here's The Deal, Toots.

1155
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,888
Now, You Want
The Moonstone Back, Right?

1156
00:59:52,888 --> 00:59:54,390
It Is Mine!

1157
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,390
Fine.

1158
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:57,860
Kelly And I Don't Have It.

1159
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,862
Lynn And Oscar Have It.

1160
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,865
But...If You Give Me
A Large Reward

1161
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:05,868
And Promise
Not To Hurt The Girls,

1162
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:08,871
I Will Help You
Get The Moonstone Back.

1163
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:13,209
That Will Keep Them
From Lifting The Spell
On Aunt Sophia.

1164
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:14,710
How Does $50,000 Sound?

1165
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,211
I Don't Need You.

1166
01:00:16,211 --> 01:00:19,415
You're Nothing But
A Duplicitous Twerp,

1167
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,751
A Vituperative
Snark!

1168
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:24,353
I'm Sorry You Feel
That Way.

1169
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:28,424
You Drive A Hard Bargain.
I Respect That.

1170
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,726
25,000 And Not
A Penny Less!

1171
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:34,496
You're Starting
To Irritate Me.

1172
01:00:34,496 --> 01:00:35,765
$10,000,

1173
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:38,167
And That Is
My Final Offer!

1174
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,570
Why Don't I Give You
My Final Offer?

1175
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,539
I'm All Ears.

1176
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,010
[Caw Caw]

1177
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:49,512
No! I'm All Feathers!

1178
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,514
[Caw Caw]

1179
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,115
Lady,

1180
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:56,118
I Would Have Settled
For 20 Bucks!

1181
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:58,620
Find A Flock And Get Lost!

1182
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,989
You're Crazy, Lady!

1183
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,530
Mr. N!

1184
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,499
Mr. N!

1185
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:22,378
Are You All Right?

1186
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,780
Your Sister
Has Saved Me!

1187
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,849
What Happened?

1188
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,852
Oh, Lynn And Oscar
Came To The House

1189
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,554
And Used The Moonstone
To Free Me!

1190
01:01:32,554 --> 01:01:34,923
Where's Mr. N?

1191
01:01:34,923 --> 01:01:36,592
Mister--

1192
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,093
Oh! Oh, Your Friend.

1193
01:01:38,093 --> 01:01:39,094
Oh!

1194
01:01:39,094 --> 01:01:41,096
Well, He Was So Glad

1195
01:01:41,096 --> 01:01:43,098
That This
Was All Over

1196
01:01:43,098 --> 01:01:45,100
That He Flew--
He Fled.

1197
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,570
He Rushed Off.

1198
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,805
And Where's
Lynn And Oscar?

1199
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:52,308
Oh, Everybody's
All Safe And Sound.

1200
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,809
Let's Hurry.

1201
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:57,046
I've Decided To
Give Your Parents
The Loan.

1202
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,948
You Won't Lose
The House.

1203
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:01,183
You'll Be Part
Of Our Family!

1204
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:03,085
Nothing Could
Make Me Happier.

1205
01:02:03,085 --> 01:02:05,955
Come On Down.
Hurry Up.

1206
01:02:13,228 --> 01:02:16,732
And Then You And Mom
And Lynn And Me

1207
01:02:16,732 --> 01:02:19,235
Can All Bake
Your Favorite Cookies!

1208
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,802
Yes! That's Right!

1209
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,338
Oh!

1210
01:02:30,078 --> 01:02:34,450
Because Mom Told Me
How Much You Love

1211
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,918
Chocolate Chip Cookies.

1212
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,219
My Favorite!

1213
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:39,455
Are You Coming Down?

1214
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,090
I'm Scared! It's Dark!

1215
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,226
Then I'll Come Up.

1216
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,060
Could You?

1217
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,228
No Problem.

1218
01:02:46,228 --> 01:02:47,963
And I'll Open The Door.

1219
01:02:47,963 --> 01:02:49,632
I'm On My Way.

1220
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:54,303
Here I Come.

1221
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:57,573
I Can Hardly Wait.

1222
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:00,610
Me, Neither.

1223
01:03:02,344 --> 01:03:03,846
What?

1224
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:05,681
What Are You--
What's Going--

1225
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,483
Wh-What's Happening?

1226
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:08,985
You're Not Aunt Sophia.

1227
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,952
Her Favorite Cookies
Were Cinnamon,

1228
01:03:10,952 --> 01:03:12,454
Not Chocolate Chip!

1229
01:03:12,454 --> 01:03:16,224
I Don't Care
If It's Fudge
And Fly Droppings!

1230
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:19,228
Let Me Out Of This!

1231
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,864
What's Happened
To My Magic?

1232
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:23,232
Mr. N!

1233
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,634
Mr. N!

1234
01:03:25,634 --> 01:03:27,170
Uh-Oh.

1235
01:03:31,907 --> 01:03:34,577
Mr. N, Mr. N,
Guess What!

1236
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:37,346
I Trapped Aunt Agatha!

1237
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:41,717
Aah!

1238
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:48,524
The Coast Is Clear.
Come On!

1239
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,227
Where's Mr. N
And Kelly?

1240
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,728
Look Here!

1241
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:54,730
It's One
Of Agatha's Minions!

1242
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,231
Chill, Man.
It's Me.

1243
01:03:56,231 --> 01:03:58,234
This Is Not
A Trick.

1244
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,735
Mr. N?

1245
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:01,737
Yeah! Can You
Get This?

1246
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:03,739
I've Been Dissed
Big-Time!

1247
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:04,907
What Happened?

1248
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,042
Did Aunt Agatha
Do This?

1249
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:08,543
Even Without
The Moonstone,

1250
01:04:08,543 --> 01:04:11,547
That Old Witch
Has Got A Mess Of Magic.

1251
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,048
Talk About Sick.

1252
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:15,717
I'm Hungry.
Anybody Got A Worm?

1253
01:04:15,717 --> 01:04:18,154
Where's Kelly?
Did She Get Away?

1254
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:20,089
No. They Grabbed Her,

1255
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:23,059
And They're Taking Her
Back To Agatha's House.

1256
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,793
They'll Be Delayed
A Little.

1257
01:04:24,793 --> 01:04:28,531
I Don't Want Them
To Hurt Her!

1258
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,399
Now, Now.

1259
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:33,135
I Haven't Been Nice
To Kelly Lately.

1260
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,636
We've Never
Been Apart.

1261
01:04:34,636 --> 01:04:36,772
I Bet She's Scared.

1262
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,442
I'm Not There
To Tell Her
It's O.K.

1263
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:42,444
Come On.

We Became Jealous
Of Each Other.

1442
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:06,200
And Then I...

1443
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,203
I Met George.

1444
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:18,714
[Footsteps]

1445
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:25,621
What Have You Done
With Your Hair?

1446
01:15:28,723 --> 01:15:33,695
I'd Ask You To Join Me,
But I Prefer My Own Company.

1447
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,330
Like Always.

1448
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,198
George And I...

1449
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:39,768
Have Come
To Say Goodbye.

1450
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,970
What Do You Mean,
"Goodbye"?

1451
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,839
We're Going To
Get Married

1452
01:15:44,839 --> 01:15:47,608
And Move Away,
Far Away.

1453
01:15:47,608 --> 01:15:50,344
Is This Some Kind Of Joke?

1454
01:15:50,344 --> 01:15:52,713
The Joke,
I'm Afraid,

1455
01:15:52,713 --> 01:15:54,716
May Be On You,
Agatha.

1456
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,718
I Want A Life

1457
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,720
Of Kindness
And Care...

1458
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,721
And Love.

1459
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,723
Oh, Don't Make Me Heave.

1460
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,893
You're Not Going Anywhere.
Nobody Loves You.

1461
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,194
Wrong.

1462
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:07,295
I Do.

1463
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,197
Oh! Romeo Squeaks Up.

1464
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:10,698
Who Gave You Permission

1465
01:16:10,698 --> 01:16:13,535
To Have Someone Fall
In Love With You?

1466
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:16,538
Just Because
You Won't Let
Anybody Love You

1467
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:19,207
Doesn't Mean I Need
Your Permission.

1468
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:22,210
Turkey Bbs.
Say Goodbye To George.

1469
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,712
I'm Going.

1470
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:25,713
Farewell.

1471
01:16:25,713 --> 01:16:27,715
I Warned You.

1472
01:16:27,715 --> 01:16:30,084
You And Your Spells

1473
01:16:30,084 --> 01:16:32,220
And Your Witchcraft.

1474
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,422
You And Your Love.

1475
01:16:34,422 --> 01:16:38,060
Into The Mirror!
Into The Void!

1476
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:42,697
You've Stirred Up My Ire.
You've Made Me Annoyed.

1477
01:16:42,697 --> 01:16:44,666
Annis...

1478
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,368
Sonannis...

1479
01:16:47,368 --> 01:16:49,670
Dole Don Rackier.

1480
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:52,707
Enter The Shadows...

1481
01:16:52,707 --> 01:16:56,044
Forever Be There.

1482
01:17:02,016 --> 01:17:03,552
Sit Down, George.

1483
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:06,053
I'll Be Finished
In A While,

1484
01:17:06,053 --> 01:17:08,924
And Then You Can
Wash The Dishes.

1485
01:17:10,925 --> 01:17:13,028
Sit Down, Stupid!

1486
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:26,708
I Don't Suppose
You'd Care

1487
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:28,710
For Some
Rat Skull Curry?

1488
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,746
And That's When
She Trapped You
In The Mirror?

1489
01:17:31,746 --> 01:17:33,214
Yes...

1490
01:17:33,214 --> 01:17:35,717
And Put A Spell
On George.

1491
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:36,718
[Caw]

1492
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:38,219
Ah! Car Coming.

1493
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:40,188
[Tires Squealing]

1494
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:44,693
[Oscar]
It's Her! She's Here!

1495
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:49,698
Hang On
To The Moonstone.

1496
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:52,200
She Can't Grab It
From You.

1497
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,638
She Can Only Get It
If You Give It To Her.

1498
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,706
It'll Be Safe With You.

1499
01:17:58,706 --> 01:18:01,042
[Agatha]
They're Here!

1500
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:02,577
Ahh...

1501
01:18:03,711 --> 01:18:05,213
I Have Lynn!

1502
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:06,714
I'm Kelly!

1503
01:18:06,714 --> 01:18:08,516
Oh, Whoever.

1504
01:18:08,516 --> 01:18:10,218
I Have Your Sister!

1505
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:13,388
If You Care About Her,
Give Yourself Up!

1506
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,223
Don't Do It!

1507
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,325
Gag Her With A Rune!

1508
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:18,726
[Caw]

1509
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:20,362
What A Witch!

1510
01:18:23,431 --> 01:18:25,233
Be Careful,
Lynn.

1511
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,168
You're Wearing
My Moonstone.

1512
01:18:27,168 --> 01:18:28,670
Give It To Me.

1513
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,505
I'll Turn You
Into A Snail.

1514
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,307
Not. You Can't Hurt Me

1515
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:34,809
As Long As I'm Wearing
The Moonstone.

1516
01:18:34,809 --> 01:18:37,145
Sophia's Been Blabbing,
Has She?

1517
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:38,980
Look, Dear,

1518
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,750
You And I Don't Have
To Be Enemies,

1519
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,251
Do We?

1520
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:44,719
No, We Don't,

1521
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,722
If You Let Kelly Go
And Aunt Sophia.

1522
01:18:47,722 --> 01:18:49,724
I Have A Better Idea.

1523
01:18:49,724 --> 01:18:53,161
You're Different
From Your Sister.
You're Special.

1524
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:55,229
What Do You Mean?

1525
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:58,233
You're Tired Of Being
A Twin, Aren't You?

1526
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,067
Yeah, But...

1527
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:02,236
I Know What That's Like--

1528
01:19:02,236 --> 01:19:03,738
Having To Share Everything

1529
01:19:03,738 --> 01:19:06,774
Or Having People Get You
Mixed Up Together.

1530
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:08,676
Well...

1531
01:19:08,676 --> 01:19:12,180
You And I Could Possess
The Moonstone Together.

1532
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,415
But What About Kelly?

1533
01:19:14,415 --> 01:19:15,983
She's In The Way.

1534
01:19:15,983 --> 01:19:18,720
We'll Put Her
With Aunt Sophia,

1535
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,090
And Then You Won't
Be A Twin Anymore!

1536
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,725
Ha Ha Ha!

1537
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:31,632
No!

1538
01:19:31,632 --> 01:19:33,567
That's Telling Her.

1539
01:19:31,632 --> 01:19:33,567
Yeah!

1540
01:19:33,567 --> 01:19:35,603
I Tried To Be Nice!

1541
01:19:35,603 --> 01:19:37,471
That'll Be The Day.

1542
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:40,508
George, Didn't
I Try To Be Nice?

1543
01:19:40,508 --> 01:19:43,245
But No More
Mr. Nice Guy.

1544
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:46,981
I Can't Cast
A Spell On You,

1545
01:19:46,981 --> 01:19:50,218
But Your Sister
Isn't Wearing
The Moonstone.

1546
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:52,220
Don't Turn Her
Into Anything.

1547
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,389
Don't Hurt Her!

1548
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:57,092
I'll Offer You
A Straight Exchange.

1549
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:59,728
If You Give Me
The Moonstone,

1550
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:02,230
And I'll Let
Both Of You Go.

1551
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,198
She's A Liar!

1552
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:06,067
George,
Bring Kelly Closer

1553
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:09,070
So I Can Start
Saying A Spell.

1554
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,239
No! I'll Do It.

1555
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:14,408
You Have To Promise
To Let Everyone Go.

1556
01:20:14,408 --> 01:20:15,410
Me, Too!

1557
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,312
And Turn Mr. N
Back Into A Person.

1558
01:20:18,312 --> 01:20:20,581
Well, All Right.
I Promise.

1559
01:20:20,581 --> 01:20:22,584
Cross Your Heart.

1560
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:24,519
Cross My Heart.

1561
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:25,620
Hope To Die.

1562
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:26,888
Hope To Die.

1563
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:29,224
Stick A Needle
In Your Eye.

1564
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:31,726
Shake Your Bottom
If You Got 'Em.

1565
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:34,862
Stick A Needle
In Your Bottom--
Hand It Over!

1566
01:20:34,862 --> 01:20:36,230
First, Let Kelly Go.

1567
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:37,265
First, Hand It Over.

1568
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,133
You Go First.

1569
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,133
You Go First.

1570
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:41,202
You Go First.

1571
01:20:41,202 --> 01:20:42,737
Oh, For Goodness' Sake!

1572
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:46,407
Just Put The Moonstone
Down Here On The Floor.

1573
01:20:46,407 --> 01:20:49,410
George, When The Moonstone
Is On The Floor,

1574
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:51,579
Let That Kelly Girl Go.

1575
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:54,281
Then I'll
Turn Back Mr. N.

1576
01:20:54,281 --> 01:20:56,717
Don't Do It!
Run! Save Yourself!

1577
01:20:56,717 --> 01:20:59,621
I Can't Let Her
Hurt You.

1578
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,733
Little Sucker
Actually Believed Me!

1579
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:13,735
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

1580
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,737
Hee Hee Hee
Hee Hee Hee!

1581
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:18,372
But You Crossed
Your Heart.

1582
01:21:18,372 --> 01:21:21,242
That Doesn't Count.
I Don't Have A Heart.

1583
01:21:21,242 --> 01:21:22,744
Hee Hee Hee
Hee Hee Hee!

1584
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:25,380
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

1585
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,682
[Mr. N]
But I Do!

1586
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:29,784
Moonstone
Coming Up.

1587
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:31,653
Good Job.

1588
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:35,056
Stop Them! Come Back,
You Little Pip-Squeaks!

1589
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:38,226
Come Back Here!
Do You Hear Me?

1590
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:40,228
Come Back Here!

1591
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,729
Come Back Here!

1592
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:43,732
I'm Waiting For You!

1593
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,733
Remember Before
You Offered

1594
01:21:45,733 --> 01:21:48,736
To Give Me Back
The Moonstone For $50,000?

1595
01:21:48,736 --> 01:21:50,238
Well, It's A Deal.

1596
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,741
I'll Turn You Back
And Give You The Money.

1597
01:21:53,741 --> 01:21:56,243
I Knew He Couldn't
Be Trusted.

1598
01:21:56,243 --> 01:21:58,712
It Was A Mistake.
No Deal!

1599
01:21:58,712 --> 01:22:00,881
I'm Ashamed
Of Myself

1600
01:22:00,881 --> 01:22:03,318
For Even Thinking
About Betraying
Lynn And Kelly,

1601
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,720
And Sticking Up
For Them

1602
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,722
Is More Important
Than Money.

1603
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:10,158
You're Turning Me Down?

1604
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:13,227
Even If It Means
Being A Crow

1605
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,730
For The Rest
Of Your Life?

1606
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:19,033
Even If
It Means Being
A Crow For Life.

1607
01:22:19,033 --> 01:22:22,370
Go Get Your Shotgun, George.
We're Going Crow Hunting.

1608
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,706
Hunt This, Ugly!

1609
01:22:41,288 --> 01:22:43,024
Out Of My Way!

1610
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,660
I'm Not Afraid Of You.

1611
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,663
I Suppose You're Not
Afraid Of Me, Either.

1612
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:50,331
I'm P-P-Petrified,

1613
01:22:50,331 --> 01:22:52,433
But I'm Staying
Here Anyway.

1614
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:54,069
Me, Too!

1615
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:57,672
I Guess Being Brave Isn't
About Not Being Scared.

1616
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:01,676
It's About Being Scared,
But Doing What You Have To.

1617
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:03,144

1652
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:19,653
When The Clock
Finishes Striking
Midnight,

1653
01:24:19,653 --> 01:24:21,823
You're Out Of Time!

1654
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:24,825
What's The Incantation?
What Do We Say?

1655
01:24:24,825 --> 01:24:26,327
I Can't Tell You.

1656

It's After Midnight.

Even If You Knew
The Incantation,

01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,126
It Wouldn't Do Any Good.

1672
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:08,002
Trying Doesn't Bring
Home The Bat Wings.

Not To Call You
And Tell You

1741
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,262
The Twins Were Here,

Reflect.

1748
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:40,280
And You're George,
Aren't You?

01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:44,885
Was Sophia And Me

1752
01:28:44,885 --> 01:28:47,054
Saying Goodbye
To Agatha.

1753
01:28:47,054 --> 01:28:48,556
Yes, Darling.

1754
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:52,059

To Her Now.

Mr. Gravedigger,
We Are Very Proud

01:29:11,044 --> 01:29:12,546
Oh, Thank You!

1762
01:29:12,546 --> 01:29:15,049
I Was Proud Of Me, Too.

1763
01:29:20,053 --> 01:29:23,291

Fabulous Tonight.

1764
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:24,858

1765
01:29:24,858 --> 01:29:28,229
I Think We Were All
Pretty Fabulous,

01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:29,731
Fantastic,
And Extraordinary.

Mr. N, We Couldn't Have
Done It Without You.

1768
01:29:41,475 --> 01:29:44,978
We Wish We Can Give You
A Million-Dollar Reward.

Hey, I've Learned
That Money Is Money,

1770
01:29:48,482 --> 01:29:50,318
But Friends...

1771
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:53,321
Good Friends
Are The Riches
Of A Lifetime.

1772
01:29:57,591 --> 01:29:59,092
Oh, My Girls!

1773
01:29:59,092 --> 01:30:00,094

1778
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:16,176
Sophia...

1779
01:30:16,176 --> 01:30:19,179
I Want You To Know
That Through It All,

1780
01:30:19,179 --> 01:30:21,682
Even When Agatha
Was Up In The Attic

1781
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:23,183
During One
Of Her Spells

1782
01:30:23,183 --> 01:30:26,187
And I Had To Ask
Which Witch Is Which

1783
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:28,689
And I Didn't Know
Who I Was,

1784
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:32,126
I Felt Deep Down
An Undeniable
Love For You.

1785
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:33,627
That's So Dear.

1786
01:30:33,627 --> 01:30:35,629
I Never Gave Up Hope

1787
01:30:35,629 --> 01:30:38,132
That We'd Find
Each Other Again.

1788
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:42,136
I Want You To Take

1789
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:45,139
A Big Batch Of These
Cinnamon Cookies Home.

1790
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:48,142
I'm Looking Forward
To Tasting Them Again.

1791
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:50,144
It Seems
A Long Time

1792
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:51,645
Since You
Made Them.

1793
01:30:51,645 --> 01:30:53,147
Don, I Understand

1794
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:55,149
You Might Need
Some Help

1795
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:56,651
With Your
House Payment?

1796
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:57,651
Uh, Well--
