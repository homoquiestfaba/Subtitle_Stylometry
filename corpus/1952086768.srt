CENTER

00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:15,850
Dear Karla. You now have eight years of
your sentence of twelve-year sentence ...

3
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:19,433
and is eligible
for sentence.

4
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:27,223
To this end you will be transferred to
this device for an investigation.

5
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:32,931
After this
it is my responsibility ...

6
00:02:33,105 --> 00:02:38,853
to you whether or not to contribute
for early release.

7
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:45,394
Karla, it's important
that we assess ...

8
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:52,058
in all openness and honesty
perform in all respects.

9
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,636
Just as I should
for everything to appeal.

10
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:59,563
Hi, Karla.
Day, Dr. Arnold.

11
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:03,641
You look good.
-Thank you

12
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:05,686
I feel good.

13
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:09,305
Last month, I graduated.

14
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:12,053
Congratulations.

15
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:16,889
Graduating in prison.
That is not small.

16
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:22,055
Can I smoke? That relaxes me.
-Make yourself at home.

17
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:24,933
I have my pajamas with me.

18
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:33,312
And where do you want to discuss?

19
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:42,477
If you go to these pictures look ...

20
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,267
what you feel it now?

21
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,439
I do not know.

22
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,481
This is fun.

23
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,685
God, what was he handsome.

24
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,768
But he was more than that.
He was a musician, composer.

25
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,306
He dreamed of making movies.

26
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:24,520
He had a good job.
He was intelligent.

27
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,103
He led the life
I dreamed of.

28
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:31,890
That was when he just knew.

29
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:35,099
Yes. I was eighteen.

30
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:43,646
I was with my friend and colleague Peggy
at a conference in Toronto. In a hotel.

31
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:48,273
We sat in the restaurant,
looking for guys.

32
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:51,061
Peggy, turn you 's all about.

33
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:53,805
God, what is he handsome.

34
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:59,352
Then I Paul 's first saw ...

35
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:04,810
it sounds naive, but I knew
that I would marry him.

36
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:06,642
Are they?

37
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,435
He was really perfect.

38
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:19,567
Can we come?
-Yeah, sit down.

39
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:28,646
I'm Karla,
this is my friend Peggy.

40
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:33,191
I'm Paul Bernardo.
This is my custom Nick.

41
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:40,648
Where you stay?
-Here in the hotel.

42
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,686
For the veterinarian conference.

43
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:49,097
So why do you make the beast in me.
O, my god ...

44
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,686
Nice.

45
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:11,185
Jesus ...

46
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:15,144
If you do not want, please do not.

47
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,394
Oh my god ...

48
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:33,524
You are so beautiful. I love you.

49
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:43,853
Was that not what daring?
Free with a nice guy?

50
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:46,598
With friends there?

51
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:50,977
Do you even do giant exciting.

52
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,690
Please appreciate that he was older.

53
00:07:57,861 --> 00:08:00,693
I wanted to show him that I notice.

54
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,353
You've started
certain sex games.

55
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:09,735
I know what you mean
allowing nothing.

56
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:12,652
Tell me about.

57
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,229
Okay.

58
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:21,651
That was when he 's first
home with me.

59
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,315
And when I had a surprise for him.

60
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:32,102
What is that?
-Keep your mouth. Do them.

61
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,687
Put?

62
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:45,859
I want you to fuck me.
-Should I fuck you?

63
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:52,314
If I was a rapist?
-Great. Come in me.

64
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:58,021
He said: Suppose that a rapist
, and you said, it's crazy.

65
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:01,276
Never heard of horny talk?

66
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:05,142
More was not it?
-For me.

67
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:08,402
Talking sex. Everyone does that.

68
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:15,022
He says that he
by your relationship is started.

69
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:17,767
With rape.

70
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:23,729
This is bullshit. He raped
all girls before I knew him.

71
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:27,309
And you knew that?

72
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:32,936
Paul lived two hours drive
away from me.

73
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:36,478
I did not know what he
outside it was weekend.

74
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:42,652
He talked only about his work,
his music and his ideas for films.

75
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:51,518
You did not know that he was suspected
of rapes in Scarborough?

76
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:55,690
There was once someone in the newspaper
which he appeared.

77
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:59,064
But after years I discovered more.

78
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:05,188
You did not know that he was interrogated?
-Only much later.

79
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:11,029
Gus, did you read The Sun?
Paul is on the front page.

80
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:15,818
I have not seen.
-You must watch, it's really Paul.

81
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:18,145
That's the rapist ...

82
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:22,186
But other than Nick
saw the similarity.

83
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:25,031
Worse than a job.

84
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:29,238
We had all these tips
now examine.

85
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:33,980
Snap it. Everyone makes fun little
that portrait.

86
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:37,189
What should I say?
I love women.

87
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:44,938
I have a beautiful fiance
in St. Katherine. I would never do.

88
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:50,814
Would you like a blood away?
Then we can exclude.

89
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:56,227
Of course, what you want.
-Good. There has been nothing wrong.

90
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,945
We have not previously discussed.
It is difficult.

91
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:05,232
But as I report
to draw up ...

92
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:09,650
I would like
about your sister Tammy have.

93
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:19,271
You think you handle it?
-Sure. Why not?

94
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:26,736
Paul says that you were jealous of Tammy.

95
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:29,027
That was not me.

96
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,777
He fell on her because she was a virgin.

97
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:38,731
He did much that I not a virgin
was. He wanted something Puurs.

98
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:43,315
And Tammy was pure?
For him, maybe.

99
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,274
They were a good band.

100
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,984
That was not you mind?

101
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,905
I must warn you.

102
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:09,897
I can only report positive
if you are honest.

103
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:16,107
That I do not understand.
-This time when she came home so late?

104
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:21,272
We know a lot about your jealousy.
The summer of 1990.

105
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:34,281
Go inside. Inwards.

106
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:42,363
You were eight hours away.
-So?

107
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:48,896
Have you fucked her?
-Jesus, I have not fucked her.

108
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:52,522
She is a virgin, yes?
-It is a slut.

109
00:12:55,866 --> 00:13:00,570
I know you want it.
Enter it again.

110
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:08,275
Well. So what?

111
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:12,065
So what? I want her.

112
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:17,397
I love you, there is the question.
-We are engaged, Paul.

113
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:20,696
Your faith with me?

114
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,026
Of course.

115
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:30,277
I love you too.

116
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:33,651
I love you so much, it's too much.

117
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:41,243
It is never too much.

118
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,106
You had him, if necessary, Karla.

119
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:53,444
Were you really afraid of him
Tammy to get rid of?

120
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:02,618
You give me the feeling
I need a painkiller.

121
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:04,657
Want one?

122
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:17,149
We are ready.

123
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:25,613
See you tomorrow, Karla.

124
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:29,909
If you are equipped,
we talk about Tammy.

125
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:38,532
You love chocolate, I remember.

126
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,905
You love me, Karla?
-You are my king.

127
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,866
And if your king now
something of value to have?

128
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:12,777
If the king wants a virgin?

129
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:16,868
The king is the king.

130
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:19,950
But if Virgin do not want?

131
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,986
They do not even know.
-You 're talking about Tammy, Paul.

132
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:30,286
I do not know.
-Come on, Karla.

133
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:35,443
It would create a bond between us.
Forever.

134
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:44,578
Where you work in the veterinary clinic.
Since they have resources.

135
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:48,194
I do not know.
-I know you.

136
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:53,277
Anesthetics for dogs and cats.
Halothane.

137
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:57,150
This is for animals.
-It can not hurt.

138
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:00,659
Come on, that is the king now.

139
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,613
Do you do for me?

140
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:07,868
Kar, I am your king.

141
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:14,443
It would be a nice Christmas.
Come on.

142
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:19,990
Not soon after our engagement party.
-You had promised.

143
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:23,528
Everything is still ready?

144
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:28,948
So I know you again. My girl.

145
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:47,578
And we have sister Tammy ...

146
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:51,788
its version number daiquiri?
Second, third?

147
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:57,703
Are you with two?
O boy, sister is a bit fed up?

148
00:16:57,872 --> 00:17:01,948
What do you think?
Thus to see it.

149
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,613
And tell 's Tammy,
are you in Christmas mood?

150
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:10,284
That is sweet. Do that again.

151
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:15,035
Lovely.
Jesus, what makes me horny.

152
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:36,951
Here, drink this.

153
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:49,160
Beautiful as that.

154
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:55,487
They had an hour sleep.
-Not too much.

155
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:58,235
They will get nothing.

156
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:03,239
I love you.
-I love you too.

157
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:09,205
More than you realize.
-Really?

158
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:16,702
Here, baby. Drink only once.

159
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:32,907
Finally. Check whether they really gone.

160
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:41,662
Get it.

161
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:45,411
Remove that piece and that stuff.
Get it.

162
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:01,953
Honey, what great
you give me this. I love you.

163
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,161
Well, do it.

164
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,325
Come on, do it.

165
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:15,529
I love you, Paul.
-I know, honey.

166
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:18,742
Put it on her face.

167
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:49,571
That is sweet, huh? Is not that sweet?

168
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:52,831
I asked you what.
-Yes, very nice.

169
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:41,572
Strip.
-What?

170
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:44,321
Strip.
-We would ...

171
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,741
Just do it.

172
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:08,622
And now suck.

173
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:12,532
Come on, suck on her breast.

174
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:20,909
You do not.
Do it now but just.

175
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:26,667
Paul, just to shoot.
-Do it. Mouth open, insert your tongue out.

176
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:30,083
I can not.
-You could.

177
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:36,497
Dirty slut, you've ruined my film.
Do this no more, you hear me?

178
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:52,252
She breathes not.
-Dick not.

179
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,283
Paul, it breathes no more.
-Dick not Karla.

180
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,875
What do you do, damn it?

181
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:08,623
Hello? Dundonald Street 61.
Send someone, my sister breathes no more.

182
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:11,543
Yes, 61. You should send someone.

183
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,408
The ambulance is coming.
You remain calm.

184
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:21,293
Over the mess left on,
I do more.

185
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:49,162
Wake up, damn it.

186
00:22:57,171 --> 00:23:00,121
It is all good.

187
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:03,749
It is not good.

188
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:29,244
I feel no heartbeat, you what?

189
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:37,087
Prefer to wait outside.

190
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,793
We sat with his three
a video to watch.

191
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:54,375
We must have fallen asleep
Tammy and then made a sound.

192
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:59,785
What noise?
-They hijgde, as if she choked.

193
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:02,084
Yes, they choked.

194
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,245
Detective Porter.

195
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:35,166
Right. Thank you.

196
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:41,667
My participation.

197
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:50,998
I hold up, but we must
now to the agency.

198
00:25:02,215 --> 00:25:06,125
Where is the video?
-In a safe place.

199
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:23,582
In my letter: Dear Tammy,
I carry you forever in my heart.

200
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:27,750
I give you all my love.
Your big sister Karla.

201
00:25:27,923 --> 00:25:32,710
PS: I hope you are happy
in God's hands.

202
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:36,122
And you thought that?

203
00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:39,839
Absolutely.

204
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:46,921
But you made a few weeks
after her death a film with Paul.

205
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,127
The Tammy movie.

206
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:55,872
Nothing is taboo, Karla.

207
00:25:57,048 --> 00:26:01,873
You can tell me what you did.
Tell me why.

208
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:13,373
We have a lot of films.

209
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,421
He was ...

210
00:26:18,217 --> 00:26:21,379
He was obsessed with Tammy.

211
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:28,418
I wanted him to lose.

212
00:26:30,217 --> 00:26:35,668
He gave me the guilt of her death.
I had to do something.

213
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:39,622
But this time the movie was your idea.

214
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,004
This time, yes.

215
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:00,085
I had another drink.

216
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:03,925
I must relax.

217
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:13,504
My life task
is to ensure that you feel good.

218
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:19,292
I saw how my sister fucked.

219
00:27:20,842 --> 00:27:23,627
How her virginity.

220
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:33,416
Tomorrow we at Tammy's grave.

221
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:38,455
It has your intimate places
touched.

222
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:53,038
I gave you her virginity instead
of mine. So much I love you.

223
00:27:56,551 --> 00:28:01,920
I did because I love you.
Because you are my king.

224
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,923
And that suggested Paul satisfied?

225
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:24,297
For a while maybe.
He had many problems.

226
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:30,833
He lost his job. His mother continued
him out, he lived with my family.

227
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:36,247
And he always turned the Christmas video.
That went on.

228
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:40,670
I had to look forward
and our friends too.

229
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:58,250
You have done what you could.
-Here it is done.

230
00:28:58,428 --> 00:29:02,718
Not give up,
we drag you through.

231
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:09,124
You know what, you should
back on scratching.

232
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:12,301
I wish you a proposal.

233
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,420
You need money, right?

234
00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:18,794
I have a partner.

235
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,500
What do you mean?
-Cigarette smuggling.

236
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,803
Provides about three, four grand
per month.

237
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:33,043
Go on, that sounds interesting.

238
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:38,256
Did you mind that it was illegal?
-That money was fine.

239
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:43,464
For the first time we could make plans.
But the link was.

240
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,046
Toronto.

241
00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:50,585
Drive through.

242
00:30:00,803 --> 00:30:04,749
Successful.
-Damn, we have pulled.

243
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:11,179
A few times per month
Nick and he went across the border.

244
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:16,298
From the money he hired
a beautiful house in Port Lucy.

245
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,671
A dream became reality.

246
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:22,921
What a treasure.

247
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:27,553
After Tammy was he ... I do not know.

248
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:33,006
He had changed. Sometimes it was good,
sometimes it was common.

249
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,509
More than that.
-I will do.

250
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:39,465
No, I said: Do it. Now.

251
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:48,587
What did I just say?

252
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:55,131
I had to clean up.
-Yes, and you do what I say.

253
00:30:55,305 --> 00:31:01,502
I give you a nice house and you let
the dog under the piss? Come on.

254
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:05,013
Not your fault.

255
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:09,553
Sometimes he said that he hated me.
Could it not care.

256
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:13,762
That was the fixed pattern
Port Lucy?

257
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:20,469
Sometimes. But there were also
good periods.

258
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:28,049
We were Friday We were independent.

259
00:31:47,014 --> 00:31:50,795
Do you like that?
-Great.

260
00:31:50,972 --> 00:31:53,176
Come here, play.

261
00:32:43,515 --> 00:32:47,343
But there was something else.
-Go on.

262
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:55,716
You asked when I heard that he
girls raped. That was then.

263
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:59,138
He hid no longer.
It was like ...

264
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:01,214
Like what?

265
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:08,216
He had that video of Tammy. He knew
I could not identify him.

266
00:33:11,016 --> 00:33:13,931
How many girls?

267
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:19,681
Four, five in that time. I know
not exactly. At least four.

268
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:52,304
Hi, honey.
-Where were you?

269
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:56,136
I just raped a girl.

270
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:00,089
I got this off her arrested.

271
00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:04,423
I'm going to burn.

272
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:16,175
What is there now?

273
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:23,967
I wish that we will be happy,
as before.

274
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:29,006
But you hate me too much.

275
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:32,265
I hate you, princess.

276
00:34:32,434 --> 00:34:37,306
Sometimes you say that.
-Yes, but that is when I'm angry.

277
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:45,555
I love you, Paul.

278
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:50,470
We are still married?

279
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:52,634
Come here, baby.

280
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:00,099
Of course we married.

281
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:09,429
Listen, I go with the boys
a week to Florida.

282
00:35:10,602 --> 00:35:14,299
This is my bachelor outing.

283
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:19,181
And when I get back,
is it all good.

284
00:35:25,018 --> 00:35:29,094
Are you really back?
-Of course.

285
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,426
So Paul left your home
and went to Florida?

286
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:47,684
Ten days.
-And what did you think?

287
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,595
Nothing.

288
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,683
Just think.

289
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:55,767
Thinking what?

290
00:35:55,935 --> 00:36:01,553
Tammy, the girl he had raped
before he went to Florida ...

291
00:36:01,728 --> 00:36:04,429
with whom he was ...

292
00:36:04,602 --> 00:36:09,557
and how I could make
that he was holding me.

293
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:14,010
How I could make him happy.

294
00:36:14,187 --> 00:36:19,424
That would you still?
-I wanted him. I need him.

295
00:36:19,604 --> 00:36:21,013
Thank God.

296
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:22,596
I loved him.

297
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,431
I missed you.
I-you too, honey.

298
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,012
Come on.

299
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:39,638
And, you had fun in Florida?

300
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:48,765
Honey, I'm very tired.

301
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:56,561
Hou nou op.

302
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:03,888
I am a girl fucked
Tracy that hot.

303
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:16,639
If they call, say you
you are my sister, yes?

304
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,766
You're so bad.

305
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:26,054
And you're really not evil?

306
00:37:28,772 --> 00:37:32,303
I just want
you happy ...

307
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,635
and me coming back.

308
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:38,219
You are incredible.

309
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:51,770
He slept all day. Around ten that
evening he and dressed him.

310
00:37:58,356 --> 00:38:03,806
I go out with friends.
That I take them to the case.

311
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:09,218
He was not left since Florida.
I wanted him to stop.

312
00:38:09,397 --> 00:38:13,390
I wanted to scream
that he should remain with me.

313
00:38:13,564 --> 00:38:18,601
But I could not.
I did not know what I had to say.

314
00:38:33,273 --> 00:38:39,102
Key forget. I can not.
-It is a quarter to twelve.

315
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:43,598
You save it?
-Sure. Until tomorrow on the case.

316
00:39:13,065 --> 00:39:14,605
What are you doing?

317
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,930
I live here.

318
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,350
And you?

319
00:39:23,941 --> 00:39:26,973
I just wanted to hack your neighbors.

320
00:39:34,732 --> 00:39:37,267
Got a cigarette?

321
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,347
Yes, in the car.

322
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,724
What is your name?
-Tina McCarthy. And you?

323
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,021
Does not matter.

324
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:18,639
What is it?
-I have someone down.

325
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:22,313
No, just stay here.

326
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:36,810
Come, laugh even a little. Laugh.
Say you name it.

327
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:41,142
Tina McCarthy.
-Good. Where is that smile?

328
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:44,065
So, yes.

329
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:47,266
That is very nice.

330
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:50,310
Keep laughing, huh?

331
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:53,398
Very good, Tina, very nice.

332
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:57,607
Now I want you bloesje pull.

333
00:40:57,776 --> 00:41:00,689
Yes, but again.

334
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:04,603
Go ahead.
Do it slowly.

335
00:41:04,775 --> 00:41:07,607
Keep laughing.

336
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:09,600
This is fun?

337
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:12,063
Do you not me?

338
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,140
Keep laughing.

339
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:27,722
That is good. That is really good.

340
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:26,275
Hi, honey.

341
00:42:38,736 --> 00:42:42,859
Are you sure
that no one has seen?

342
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:48,104
When?
-When you kidnapped her.

343
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:54,641
No, nobody saw me.
I bring her to our bedroom.

344
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,436
I would not be alone.

345
00:43:13,236 --> 00:43:15,725
You do not.

346
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:19,443
Come on.

347
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:32,943
Tina, time for games.

348
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:42,268
My little brother called Patrick.
I am very fond of him.

349
00:43:42,445 --> 00:43:45,360
I want so bad to him.

350
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:57,481
I want you back uitkleedt for me.

351
00:43:58,653 --> 00:44:02,101
Yes, if I like.

352
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:08,438
What about sex
with two people?

353
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:13,395
Say that it is a girl.

354
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:16,439
It is also a girl, Tina.

355
00:44:38,863 --> 00:44:42,395
Well, now you get
a nice big kiss.

356
00:44:42,572 --> 00:44:45,025
A nice, fat kiss.

357
00:44:45,197 --> 00:44:47,436
Close your eyes, honey.

358
00:44:52,279 --> 00:44:57,399
You are doing well.
You're my little chippy, Tina.

359
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:01,945
I just want to go home,
to my brother.

360
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:08,060
Can I come home?

361
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,520
You like me. You are doing well.

362
00:45:11,698 --> 00:45:17,978
Eyes closed. What you do now will determine
what we do with you.

363
00:45:19,073 --> 00:45:22,770
Damn. Eyes closed, I said.

364
00:45:28,113 --> 00:45:30,152
Karla, come here.

365
00:45:34,115 --> 00:45:37,444
Wil see that they recognize us?

366
00:45:39,365 --> 00:45:43,405
Do you want me for 25 years
the tank in turn?

367
00:45:46,198 --> 00:45:49,859
I have to murder her, damn.

368
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:55,320
I have no choice.
I need her murder.

369
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:58,780
Stupid bitch.

370
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:07,902
Give her at least a sleeping pill,
so they feel nothing.

371
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:18,937
It's good, sweetheart.

372
00:46:25,573 --> 00:46:27,694
Here, drink it.

373
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:37,064
I had said
you should keep your eyes closed.

374
00:46:58,907 --> 00:47:01,776
My god ...
-Shut up.

375
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,989
Shut up.

376
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:22,364
Shut up.

377
00:47:58,783 --> 00:48:01,153
What are we doing?

378
00:48:04,075 --> 00:48:06,066
We are tired, yes?

379
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:12,729
We should not decide
we do something stupid.

380
00:48:14,408 --> 00:48:18,617
Good, but you can its
not miss.

381
00:48:54,285 --> 00:48:56,904
Where have you left her?

382
00:48:57,076 --> 00:48:59,031
In the basement.

383
00:49:16,951 --> 00:49:19,321
Go shower, baby.

384
00:49:46,411 --> 00:49:50,274
I had a good idea. Cement.
-Cement?

385
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:55,608
As we cast her.
We saw it in eight pieces.

386
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:59,033
I can not.
-You do what I say.

387
00:49:59,203 --> 00:50:02,865
I do not. Fuck you, Paul.

388
00:50:06,244 --> 00:50:12,821
That head was so light.
The drop is so. It's in there.

389
00:50:12,995 --> 00:50:18,364
I got it painted black,
because its still stuck there.

390
00:50:19,537 --> 00:50:23,827
If it is dark,
you help me load.

391
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:44,900
And it was still not on
to him way to go?

392
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:48,076
I've thought about it.

393
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:51,990
But the wedding was two weeks ...

394
00:50:52,162 --> 00:50:55,575
and I thought he would change.

395
00:50:55,745 --> 00:50:57,653
And you, Karla?

396
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:02,952
Were you changed
what happened?

397
00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:11,530
I just wanted to marry.

398
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,412
Dear Paul, I love you so much.

399
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:46,320
Once we were unbeatable,
together against the world.

400
00:51:46,497 --> 00:51:51,866
I want that love back. Despite
our problems as I love you.

401
00:51:52,038 --> 00:51:57,158
They see us as an ideal couple.
That we are, but what error.

402
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:02,615
It must be a fairytale marriage.
I love you. Karla.

403
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:06,284
You went on honeymoon
to Hawaii.

404
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,453
Paul has beaten me rotten.

405
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:11,079
Why?

406
00:52:12,413 --> 00:52:16,029
He wanted a girl to. Not me.

407
00:52:16,206 --> 00:52:19,821
On our honeymoon, actually.

408
00:52:21,163 --> 00:52:26,746
But the videos that Paul
Then, you be very happy.

409
00:52:26,914 --> 00:52:28,869
Of course.

410
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,826
I would never ruin his films.
I had learned that lesson.

411
00:52:35,914 --> 00:52:43,819
After your return you had a conversation with
Dan and Molly Czehowicz. Who was that?

412
00:52:43,998 --> 00:52:50,741
The clinic where I worked, had them
been. Mol and I were still friends.

413
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:55,157
They were not Paul,
but were fond of me and Buddy.

414
00:52:55,332 --> 00:53:00,701
Steve and Becca called, they come later.
-O, fun.

415
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:04,818
And that girl in the lake
identified.

416
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:11,361
What girl in the lake?
In pieces cut in cement blocks.

417
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,326
Paul, you have nothing?

418
00:53:15,498 --> 00:53:17,904
No, no, I slipped.

419
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:20,285
He's just tired.

420
00:53:21,457 --> 00:53:24,905
Okay, I do this and then we left.

421
00:53:25,082 --> 00:53:30,284
You guys are just too exhausted
by the long flight.

422
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,908
Because you did so fucking stupid.

423
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:46,912
Me? You were right?
-To you cover. That face of yours.

424
00:53:47,082 --> 00:53:51,325
Good thing Molly
just as stupid as you are.

425
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,280
Paul, what are we doing?
-Nothing.

426
00:53:55,457 --> 00:53:58,077
They are really not.

427
00:53:58,249 --> 00:54:02,077
How calm he was,
I think he was scared.

428
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:09,201
He was a quiet time.

429
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:12,042
One, two, three.

430
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:19,911
That winter it was heavy. He did not
what he wanted and had to improvise.

431
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:21,907
Drink, drink ...

432
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:46,118
I'm no good, I go to bed.

433
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:05,207
What a dick.
His wife is fucking up.

434
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:08,540
Jessie, I'm not so good.

435
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:20,624
I got her off licks. From jealousy she
Karla's toothbrush poison.

436
00:55:20,793 --> 00:55:24,916
Your wife is over, man.
What are you doing?

437
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:28,913
If you treat her so,
go away from her.

438
00:55:29,085 --> 00:55:34,240
What do you think of my marriage?
Karla does not.

439
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:37,865
Why is she not?

440
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:45,283
Stupid bitch, you got your school does not agree
completed. You are a stupid bitch.

441
00:55:45,459 --> 00:55:49,156
Well, it is enough, dirty bastard.

442
00:55:56,085 --> 00:55:58,408
Nick, stop.

443
00:56:00,543 --> 00:56:03,412
You know there is no bag.

444
00:56:03,585 --> 00:56:07,246
My house.
-Go away, Nick.

445
00:56:07,418 --> 00:56:12,787
You're crazy. I got you
that all concerned. For you.

446
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,000
These cigarettes. Ungrateful dog.

447
00:56:17,168 --> 00:56:21,411
Get out and take
that stupid whore of you.

448
00:56:27,168 --> 00:56:30,499
Fuck you.
-Where was that now about?

449
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:35,870
Not in the winter to gobble him.

450
00:56:36,043 --> 00:56:41,625
He got all his friends lost
and did nothing about. But I do.

451
00:56:41,794 --> 00:56:45,326
I wish he came to rest.

452
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:51,202
Dear Paul, tomorrow is Good Friday
and Easter, you know?

453
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:55,538
Three blissful days for Karla
with its king.

454
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:04,118
That is a good one.

455
00:57:09,377 --> 00:57:11,949
What do you want me to do?

456
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:15,210
What we have agreed.

457
00:57:22,545 --> 00:57:25,910
Sorry, can you tell me the way?

458
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:32,795
We find the Penn Center.
Straight-and right at the traffic lights.

459
00:57:32,962 --> 00:57:36,706
Sorry, you don 't
on the map show?

460
00:57:36,878 --> 00:57:38,454
Thank you.

461
00:57:40,128 --> 00:57:45,119
So we are here ...
-No, one street away.

462
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,413
You drive by and at the traffic light ...

463
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:53,745
Are good.

464
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,251
Grab it. Get her.

465
00:57:59,671 --> 00:58:02,539
Let me go, let me go.

466
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,585
Let me go.

467
00:58:05,755 --> 00:58:11,088
Shut up. I am able
this, so shut up.

468
00:58:17,172 --> 00:58:24,081
Relax. Stay here, shut the phone off,
I have her alone.

469
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:49,328
Doin 'a scratch.

470
00:58:50,589 --> 00:58:53,788
Whatever happened in the car.

471
00:59:02,589 --> 00:59:05,621
You okay, honey?

472
00:59:05,798 --> 00:59:09,377
Remember: Smile for the camera.

473
00:59:13,089 --> 00:59:17,082
Excuse me, I wish you do not hurt.

474
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:20,581
What is that?

475
00:59:21,672 --> 00:59:24,244
From my friend Chris.

476
00:59:27,673 --> 00:59:30,292
Fuck you with him?

477
00:59:30,464 --> 00:59:36,212
No, I am a decent girl.
-No, you're not.

478
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:39,165
You're a slut. Say it.

479
00:59:41,673 --> 00:59:46,212
I am a slut.
-Yes, my sex slaves of St. Mary.

480
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:49,663
You are my master.

481
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,960
This suits me.

482
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,373
She lost a shoe.

483
01:00:11,882 --> 01:00:13,789
What is your shoe?

484
01:00:22,841 --> 01:00:26,501
Weather that nightmare.
-I know you.

485
01:00:26,673 --> 01:00:28,082
The parents.

486
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,164
Mr. and Mrs. Ross?

487
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:48,662
You are my chippy of St. Mary.

488
01:00:48,841 --> 01:00:52,668
Say it. Say it, damn it.

489
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,459
Like you just said.

490
01:00:55,633 --> 01:01:02,209
Communication problem. I want
you talk to me, that you can.

491
01:01:02,383 --> 01:01:08,580
Say that you love me. "I love
you, Paul. " Say that you love me.

492
01:01:09,758 --> 01:01:14,665
Say: 'I love you, Paul.
I love you, Paul ... "

493
01:01:16,842 --> 01:01:18,878
I love you.

494
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,250
Stupid bitch, what is wrong with you?

495
01:01:28,258 --> 01:01:32,086
Some things are worth
to die.

496
01:01:32,258 --> 01:01:34,664
Oh yeah? Who am I?

497
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:37,998
A bastard.

498
01:01:38,176 --> 01:01:40,628
What? What did you say?

499
01:01:42,551 --> 01:01:44,339
Stupid bitch.

500
01:01:45,758 --> 01:01:49,917
Excuse me. You are my master.

501
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:56,704
Excuse me, I had not
say. I have earned punishment.

502
01:01:56,883 --> 01:02:02,122
Yes, I think
you have earned punishment.

503
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:07,042
My sletje of St. Mary
has earned punishment.

504
01:02:08,217 --> 01:02:10,670
Then I feel even better.

505
01:02:15,592 --> 01:02:20,049
Who wants me?
All-girls St. Mary ...

506
01:02:20,217 --> 01:02:26,925
want to fuck with you, because you are
most powerful, most sexy man in the world.

507
01:02:28,592 --> 01:02:30,464
Fucking slut.

508
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:38,792
Give me a tissue.

509
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,838
What is that? What should I so?

510
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:54,421
Stupid slut stupid slut.
A meeting of stupid sluts.

511
01:02:59,301 --> 01:03:01,968
I go get something to eat.

512
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:06,876
Try nothing.

513
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:11,381
If they try something, just do this.

514
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:20,799
Does he always against you?

515
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:25,253
Always.

516
01:03:27,302 --> 01:03:29,838
Why stay you?

517
01:03:34,928 --> 01:03:38,008
You can not understand.

518
01:03:39,678 --> 01:03:44,915
I know all this
was not your idea.

519
01:03:54,094 --> 01:03:56,666
You understand it.

520
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:17,713
Our daughter is a sweet child.
She has never done something bad.

521
01:04:18,804 --> 01:04:23,129
Hey, get up. Go get her.

522
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:26,087
Give us her back.

523
01:04:26,261 --> 01:04:33,172
Give her a chance to live.
We will help you to leave it behind.

524
01:04:33,346 --> 01:04:36,676
In your heart you will find a good man.

525
01:04:36,846 --> 01:04:41,468
Please bring her back.
Please.

526
01:04:41,638 --> 01:04:46,544
Honey, if you see this,
make you worry.

527
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,043
Hey, come on.

528
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,795
Believe me, you must have patience.
Be brave.

529
01:05:01,513 --> 01:05:04,083
Hey, you even hear.

530
01:05:08,012 --> 01:05:11,628
I have written. Not bad, huh?

531
01:05:12,305 --> 01:05:14,260
I go shower.

532
01:05:58,306 --> 01:06:01,753
Death is nothing to be afraid of.

533
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:04,217
I am not afraid.

534
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:09,839
My parents love me
and Chris likes me.

535
01:06:10,013 --> 01:06:13,676
You can find me doing nothing. You can ...

536
01:06:55,890 --> 01:07:00,014
What you felt when you saw her die?

537
01:07:02,224 --> 01:07:03,633
Nothing.

538
01:07:04,681 --> 01:07:06,090
Nothing?

539
01:07:10,724 --> 01:07:15,345
I thought how easy it was
in order to kill her.

540
01:07:17,974 --> 01:07:21,174
Not like the first time.

541
01:07:21,348 --> 01:07:23,671
It was easy.

542
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:32,051
I knew that it would continue.
Paul says that you have slain Kaitlyn.

543
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:36,715
With that hammer.
-That is not true, you know

544
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:42,805
Many people think so. The
recherche you think the perpetrator was.

545
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:48,177
The FBl-psychiatrist
and the Canadian national police as well.

546
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:50,506
Let them fall dead.

547
01:07:53,933 --> 01:07:57,547
Got something to add?

548
01:08:18,016 --> 01:08:20,718
I have killed nobody.

549
01:08:25,475 --> 01:08:27,714
And then Tammy, Karla?

550
01:08:28,642 --> 01:08:30,183
Fuck you.

551
01:08:54,392 --> 01:09:01,383
The newly formed special team believes
that the murderer of Kaitlyn Ross ...

552
01:09:01,559 --> 01:09:08,551
not only worked. He would
half man have worked.

553
01:09:08,726 --> 01:09:11,842
The police are looking for
a cream-colored Camaro.

554
01:09:12,018 --> 01:09:19,057
Those fuckers do not see any difference between "n
Nissan and a Camaro and Karla is a man.

555
01:09:19,226 --> 01:09:21,431
That is still 's smart.

556
01:09:25,435 --> 01:09:27,141
Damn.

557
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,840
Are you Paul Bernardo?

558
01:09:51,935 --> 01:09:55,550
Can I help you? Would you come?

559
01:09:55,727 --> 01:10:01,889
We investigate the death of Kaitlyn
Ross. We came to your name.

560
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:04,466
Well, that surprised me.

561
01:10:05,561 --> 01:10:11,094
That I had in Toronto also,
after that, Scarborough rapes.

562
01:10:12,185 --> 01:10:14,970
Are you still married?

563
01:10:16,144 --> 01:10:19,723
Is your wife home?
-No, that works.

564
01:10:19,893 --> 01:10:24,681
Where does it operate?
-Dierenkliniek St. Katherine.

565
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:28,846
And what do you do?
-I am accountant.

566
01:10:29,019 --> 01:10:33,511
Where?
-I actually just looking for a job.

567
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:42,973
The afternoon of April 16,
the Thursday before Easter ...

568
01:10:43,145 --> 01:10:46,058
you still know where you was when?

569
01:10:49,644 --> 01:10:53,473
O yes. I was here.
Currently with my music.

570
01:10:53,645 --> 01:10:56,892
I got behind a studiootje.

571
01:11:00,687 --> 01:11:03,221
That was about it.

572
01:11:07,269 --> 01:11:12,508
I hear it
if I can help you somewhere.

573
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,095
Good luck.

574
01:11:25,854 --> 01:11:28,721
Damn. The videotapes.

575
01:11:33,561 --> 01:11:37,935
They had no idea.
I was absolutely freezing.

576
01:11:40,104 --> 01:11:43,765
Freezing.
-Are you sure?

577
01:11:43,937 --> 01:11:47,765
Of course. You should have experience.

578
01:11:53,938 --> 01:12:00,300
I am the super knakker, the damespakker,
and there is no agent who knows me ...

579
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:06,512
as the Scarborough rapist -
there is a lot more behind.

580
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:10,889
You laugh at all.

581
01:12:11,062 --> 01:12:12,555
Yes.

582
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:20,971
Not true. I cheerfully lot which
and you are there as a pillar of salt.

583
01:12:21,147 --> 01:12:23,137
Excuse me.

584
01:12:24,562 --> 01:12:26,803
Yes, excuse you.

585
01:12:38,564 --> 01:12:43,350
He was really scared
that they would tackle him.

586
01:12:43,521 --> 01:12:46,888
And for me it became increasingly worse.

587
01:12:51,939 --> 01:12:57,639
There was an explosion when we
in July across the border went.

588
01:13:00,564 --> 01:13:05,898
You will often cross the border.
What do you do in the U.S.?

589
01:13:06,063 --> 01:13:09,146
I ask her.

590
01:13:09,313 --> 01:13:13,687
We have friends
who get married.

591
01:13:17,647 --> 01:13:20,729
Would you both off?

592
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,679
Trunk open.

593
01:13:44,522 --> 01:13:47,012
Okay, thanks.

594
01:14:12,107 --> 01:14:17,557
Thanks to you we were almost in jail.
Damn, stupid bitch.

595
01:14:17,732 --> 01:14:21,144
Never more from something stupid.

596
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:44,855
What are you doing, bitch?

597
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,556
Very sweet, Kar.

598
01:15:07,066 --> 01:15:10,266
Is that you, Karla? Is everything okay?

599
01:15:11,357 --> 01:15:14,273
No.
-Has he beaten you again?

600
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:17,771
Can you come?
-We come now.

601
01:15:20,192 --> 01:15:23,142
Fuck you, Kar.

602
01:15:23,317 --> 01:15:27,606
You're fat, you're ugly, you're stupid.

603
01:15:27,774 --> 01:15:32,396
I hate you, damn, dirty bitched.

604
01:15:32,567 --> 01:15:36,062
Fuck you, Karla. Piss off.

605
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:42,353
Have you nothing?
-Look, they come to save that bitch.

606
01:15:42,525 --> 01:15:48,309
Go away, damn it.
Get out of my house. I hate you.

607
01:15:48,483 --> 01:15:54,313
I bring it to the car.
-Get my house is Karla.

608
01:15:54,484 --> 01:15:56,475
Come on.

609
01:15:56,651 --> 01:15:59,434
Princess, wait.

610
01:15:59,609 --> 01:16:05,557
Princess, my dear.
Come here please.

611
01:16:05,735 --> 01:16:10,357
Do not do it, Karla.
-I am perfectly calm, you see it?

612
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:13,560
I need you just like to speak.

613
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:17,146
Please, go not away.

614
01:16:21,817 --> 01:16:23,560
Come on.

615
01:16:24,735 --> 01:16:27,982
Karla ...
-It is good, Mol.

616
01:16:37,985 --> 01:16:42,524
What are you doing?
You can not leave.

617
01:16:42,693 --> 01:16:45,691
I go away.
-You are insane.

618
01:16:45,859 --> 01:16:50,268
I can destroy your life. For Good.

619
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:54,484
I'll let your parents see the film
Tammy kill you.

620
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:57,935
Would you still welcome them to be?

621
01:16:58,111 --> 01:17:02,602
You think?
Think it well over, Kar.

622
01:17:04,818 --> 01:17:07,022
Come on, Karla.

623
01:17:10,068 --> 01:17:13,185
Why should it go so well?

624
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,853
Why can we not
start over?

625
01:17:21,778 --> 01:17:25,274
It does not have to go, and you can.

626
01:17:57,278 --> 01:17:59,399
How sweet.

627
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:01,441
Come to bed, honey.

628
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:04,519
"Come to bed, honey. '

629
01:18:07,444 --> 01:18:09,602
Please, Paul.

630
01:18:09,779 --> 01:18:12,065
'Please, Paul. "

631
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:19,809
Do you really think you
something can get away with impunity?

632
01:18:20,903 --> 01:18:23,060
Do that over.

633
01:18:23,237 --> 01:18:25,477
What is that?
-Put.

634
01:18:28,028 --> 01:18:30,149
On your knees, slut.

635
01:18:33,654 --> 01:18:35,360
Ass up.

636
01:18:40,988 --> 01:18:43,605
If so, damn.

637
01:18:44,778 --> 01:18:47,349
If yes.

638
01:18:47,529 --> 01:18:50,563
Shut up, damn it.

639
01:18:50,738 --> 01:18:53,651
I do not want a thrill to hear.

640
01:18:54,821 --> 01:18:57,440
Yes, that's it.

641
01:18:57,613 --> 01:19:02,981
Keep your head up. Keep your head up.

642
01:19:09,113 --> 01:19:13,605
Wish you were dead, bitch? Wish you were dead?

643
01:19:35,364 --> 01:19:40,484
I'm far too nice to you,
you know that?

644
01:19:40,655 --> 01:19:43,522
I'm too nice to you.

645
01:20:09,531 --> 01:20:12,279
You stay here tonight.

646
01:20:12,447 --> 01:20:15,316
Together with Tina McCarthy.

647
01:20:48,115 --> 01:20:50,604
What were you doing?

648
01:21:14,074 --> 01:21:17,356
Hello Molly Czehowicz?

649
01:21:17,532 --> 01:21:20,863
You're still a friend of Karla?

650
01:21:21,948 --> 01:21:27,448
Who is this?
-A friend. She needs you.

651
01:21:45,408 --> 01:21:49,532
All good.
-Not True. They called me ...

652
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:53,147
A car accident, I said.

653
01:21:53,324 --> 01:21:56,856
After my work I
things pick up.

654
01:21:57,033 --> 01:22:00,315
Come now.
-Take me tonight.

655
01:22:00,491 --> 01:22:07,530
Paul, the cross and is only
late. I make sure I'm ready.

656
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:09,690
But that was not me.

657
01:22:09,866 --> 01:22:16,478
I thought about what he would do if I got it
again worked. I was terrified.

658
01:22:16,659 --> 01:22:20,984
It kills me when they leave.
-No, Karla.

659
01:22:21,159 --> 01:22:25,068
We find a safe place
for you, really.

660
01:22:25,242 --> 01:22:26,948
He likes me.

661
01:22:27,117 --> 01:22:30,695
You go to the hospital
and then ...

662
01:22:30,866 --> 01:22:35,027
I have a cousin who has flats,
in Brampton.

663
01:22:36,116 --> 01:22:38,320
Paul knows him.

664
01:22:49,533 --> 01:22:53,694
Grievous bodily harm, says the doctor.
We deal with him.

665
01:22:53,867 --> 01:22:57,862
Is he in jail?
-For one night only.

666
01:22:58,033 --> 01:23:02,490
If necessary we can
impose a restraining order.

667
01:23:08,409 --> 01:23:11,111
Hello, darling. I am.

668
01:23:42,701 --> 01:23:46,909
They loved him but a solid night.

669
01:23:47,076 --> 01:23:51,366
So that solved nothing?
-For me.

670
01:23:51,535 --> 01:23:54,368
But they focused on Paul.

671
01:23:54,786 --> 01:23:59,277
They viewed the ancient DNA samples
Paul again.

672
01:24:04,911 --> 01:24:07,281
Detective Kirby.

673
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:12,275
Three rape cases
I have a DNA profile.

674
01:24:12,453 --> 01:24:17,820
The guy in St. Katherine.
The Scarborough-rapist.

675
01:24:17,993 --> 01:24:22,568
But it could legally
have not create.

676
01:24:22,744 --> 01:24:26,573
There was more evidence is needed.
She followed him.

677
01:24:26,745 --> 01:24:30,405
Day and night follow
and tap his phone off.

678
01:24:30,577 --> 01:24:34,487
Whether I was in a cage is.
I can not even call.

679
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:40,942
Pull you're 's. Go to the barber.
Clean, search work.

680
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:47,117
Say that you regret abuse.
-Hell anyway.

681
01:24:47,286 --> 01:24:53,614
Hear 's, I am your friend, but if you
treat me so, I step in, understand?

682
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:59,450
Sorry, I just ...
-What?

683
01:25:09,953 --> 01:25:13,532
What do you think of the death of Tammy?

684
01:25:14,704 --> 01:25:18,614
I do not know. Rare case, I think so.

685
01:25:18,787 --> 01:25:24,121
T you? A girl of sixteen
that just die?

686
01:25:24,287 --> 01:25:29,110
Girls of sixteen are not
just dead. Think.

687
01:25:29,287 --> 01:25:35,616
Karla has her. I
on video. They did.

688
01:25:36,704 --> 01:25:42,487
And there you have a picture of?
-A live recording, yes.

689
01:25:42,662 --> 01:25:49,452
In color. And if I abuse
should be, I sleep with everyone.

690
01:25:50,662 --> 01:25:54,442
Calm down it.
-If you knew s, Doug ...

691
01:25:54,621 --> 01:26:01,780
Someone who does everything
its back. Also destruction.

692
01:26:12,871 --> 01:26:17,031
If they come back,
I really love her.

693
01:26:21,497 --> 01:26:24,944
You understand that everything you say ...

694
01:26:26,371 --> 01:26:29,453
That is the legal duty.

695
01:26:29,622 --> 01:26:34,244
I can not do what you harm.
Only help you.

696
01:26:34,413 --> 01:26:37,862
What are we exactly?

697
01:26:41,038 --> 01:26:44,866
The murders of Tina McCarthy
and Kaitlyn Ross.

698
01:26:45,038 --> 01:26:50,371
Since you information about?
-More than information.

699
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:54,035
I did not do it,
but I was there.

700
01:27:00,747 --> 01:27:06,163
If I contribute, please contact me
immunity deliver?

701
01:27:06,331 --> 01:27:10,739
If you me 's all said,
from the beginning.

702
01:27:14,997 --> 01:27:18,659
How did you feel,
after 't visit to the lawyer?

703
01:27:18,831 --> 01:27:22,162
For the first time beyond the control of Paul.

704
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:25,863
And that was a wonderful feeling.

705
01:27:28,998 --> 01:27:34,698
That is a whole other world existed
I had forgotten.

706
01:27:34,872 --> 01:27:39,614
It was there again.
A fantastic feeling.

707
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:42,740
Hello, beauty. Dancing?

708
01:27:55,374 --> 01:27:59,746
This does not sound good,
because of poor recording ...

709
01:27:59,914 --> 01:28:02,783
I sit and cry and stuff.

710
01:28:02,956 --> 01:28:06,157
But I say this to you, girl.

711
01:28:09,874 --> 01:28:12,113
I still love you.

712
01:28:13,207 --> 01:28:14,617
And ...

713
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:22,034
I know how kloterig
I have treated you.

714
01:28:26,873 --> 01:28:29,871
Excuse me so much.

715
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:40,623
Had I but when you gevreeën
while I'll aankeek.

716
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:43,031
I would like ...

717
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:47,574
I wish we had a child.

718
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:58,071
I love you, honey.

719
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,914
I miss you so.

720
01:31:00,544 --> 01:31:02,450
Why, Karla?

721
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:07,499
Why not?

722
01:31:12,585 --> 01:31:16,910
It was so delicious
to forget.

723
01:31:19,085 --> 01:31:24,372
What happiness address
and not to let go.

724
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:30,079
I felt if I was eighteen again,
before I knew Paul.

725
01:31:32,335 --> 01:31:35,784
An opportunity to begin again.

726
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:42,867
But you could not start again, huh?

727
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:55,703
But I've tried.

728
01:32:39,629 --> 01:32:43,540
Paul Bernardo, 57 Bayview Lane?

729
01:32:43,713 --> 01:32:46,663
With whom?
-I can give you an offer ...

730
01:32:46,838 --> 01:32:50,783
With whom? What do you want? No interest.

731
01:33:19,005 --> 01:33:25,712
After eight years has finally
an arrest in the Scarborough case.

732
01:33:25,879 --> 01:33:34,377
This is Paul Bernardo, 28. He is
this afternoon in his house arrest.

733
01:33:34,546 --> 01:33:38,789
He rented with his wife,
Karla Homolka ...

734
01:33:38,964 --> 01:33:42,164
still wanted by the police.

735
01:33:42,339 --> 01:33:47,540
Who has information about her,
is asked to call the police.

736
01:33:47,713 --> 01:33:52,619
Hopefully this
an end to this case ...

737
01:33:52,797 --> 01:33:57,668
so many for so long
have lived in fear.

738
01:34:00,089 --> 01:34:04,662
I was going out to eat,
and when I came back ...

739
01:34:04,839 --> 01:34:07,955
Karla Saturday in the living room to cry.

740
01:34:08,131 --> 01:34:13,037
I ran up,
and Kaitlyn was dead.

741
01:34:13,215 --> 01:34:18,878
She lay there with a rope around her neck
and there was blood.

742
01:34:24,090 --> 01:34:29,244
Kaitlyn was not upset
when you had her?

743
01:34:29,422 --> 01:34:36,746
She saw her father on TV and wanted
escape. You hit her with a hammer.

744
01:34:36,922 --> 01:34:43,833
In the struggle they pulled the rope
around her neck and wurgde themselves.

745
01:34:44,006 --> 01:34:48,628
That is a lie.
I've never beaten someone.

746
01:34:48,799 --> 01:34:52,923
And when Paul came home,
they lay dead on the ground.

747
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:54,961
That is a lie.

748
01:34:55,132 --> 01:35:00,797
Paul twisting everything out of there
to come. But he is the perpetrator.

749
01:35:00,964 --> 01:35:04,911
I know that I am terrible things
have done ...

750
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:10,163
and a lot of people pain
and sorrow have worried.

751
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:13,503
I have much regret.

752
01:35:13,674 --> 01:35:17,288
And I know I have earned punishment.

753
01:35:18,465 --> 01:35:21,795
But I did not kill those girls.

754
01:35:35,758 --> 01:35:43,330
Paul had two murders lifelong
without penalty.

755
01:35:45,008 --> 01:35:51,039
I was 12 years. There were protests
of victim groups.

756
01:35:51,217 --> 01:35:53,882
They found the sentence too light.

757
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:03,247
When I hear the outcome?
-The committee shall decide within ten days.

758
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:07,963
You think I Kaitlyn Ross
kill you, right?

759
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:16,957
I report on what you
in the future can do.

760
01:36:17,134 --> 01:36:21,458
Not about what you
in the past have done.

761
01:36:29,591 --> 01:36:32,958
I am not a psychopath, you know?

762
01:36:46,468 --> 01:36:52,879
In the cell I am safer. There seem
people who want me dead.

763
01:36:53,051 --> 01:36:56,629
Maybe it's just better.

764
01:37:08,717 --> 01:37:10,709
Goodbye, Karla.

765
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:50,880
Some think
Kaitlyn and I have killed Tina.

766
01:37:51,052 --> 01:37:54,002
I have not done.

767
01:37:54,177 --> 01:37:59,378
But Dr. Arnold was right.
I have someone killed.

768
01:38:00,469 --> 01:38:03,586
I killed my sister.

769
01:38:03,761 --> 01:38:07,506
How can I ever be forgiven?

770
01:38:07,678 --> 01:38:11,966
I think every day what I did.

771
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:13,677
Really.

772
01:38:20,219 --> 01:38:26,713
From the report: Karla is manipulative,
egocentric and narcissistic ...

773
01:38:26,885 --> 01:38:32,124
and acted not only
under pressure from Paul Bernardo.

774
01:38:32,302 --> 01:38:35,584
Despite its good presentation ...

775
01:38:35,761 --> 01:38:41,840
they show lack of moral awareness
and empathy with its victims ...

776
01:38:42,012 --> 01:38:45,542
suggesting
to psychotic tendencies.

777
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:49,416
They received no sentence.

778
01:38:51,219 --> 01:38:56,125
In the years after she had a relationship
with a detainee ...

779
01:38:56,303 --> 01:38:58,970
who had murdered his girlfriend.

780
01:38:59,136 --> 01:39:02,170
On July 4, 2005 came after 12 years Friday

781
01:39:02,344 --> 01:39:09,170
Because they showed no regret, consider the 
Court her a danger to society. 

782
01:39:09,345 --> 01:39:12,627
Her freedom was restricted. 

783
01:39:12,803 --> 01:39:18,041
The families of the victims 
reported in October 2005 ... 

784
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:23,423
that Karla Homolka to that moment 
had expressed no regret.
