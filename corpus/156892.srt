1
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:31,489
It seems like
such a short time ago

2
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:33,930
that my pet and I
were just lazing about

3
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,448
in our little London flat,

4
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,810
living the humdrum,
bachelor life,

5
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:40,853
and wishing things weren't
so very, very dull.

6
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:43,733
Oh, that's my pet... Roger.
My name's Pongo.

7
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,488
You remember, I'm the one
with the spots.

8
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:48,372
- Oh, goodness!
- No, no, not that one.

9
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,854
Or that one.

10
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:54,928
Ah, that's me, living my
new life as a family man.

11
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:59,531
Never a dull moment.
I guess I got my wish.

12
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:08,525
Ahh!
I think I'm seeing spots!

13
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:12,972
Hey, seeing spots!

14
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:15,569
Spots...
I'm seeing spots

15
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:18,533
Everywhere I'm seeing lots
of those tiny little dots

16
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,173
Yes, it's true

17
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:22,007
They're on the beds
and the cots

18
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,245
In the pans and the pots

19
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:26,530
And they've left
little spots in the loo

20
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:27,809
Roger...

21
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:29,692
are you packing
or playing?

22
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:32,164
I'm playing
at packing, dear!

23
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:34,246
Well,
quit fooling around.

24
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:36,485
We're moving first thing
in the morning!

25
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:39,408
We'll have a Dalmatian
plantation

26
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:41,690
La la-la-la
la la-la-la

27
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:43,049
I see spots
on the walls

28
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,727
In the rooms,
in the halls

29
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:47,283
On the floors,
in the drawers, yes, I do

30
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,967
And every morning
when I rise

31
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:50,249
And I open up my eyes

32
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:52,326
I am taken by surprise

33
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:54,007
'Cause instead of seeing
skies

34
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:57,212
I see lots
of little spots

35
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:59,934
- We'll have a Dalmatian
plantation
- Spots, spots, spots!

36
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:03,530
- And never again
shall we roam
- Everywhere on the beds
and the cots

37
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:05,845
- Can't wait to begin
our sweet living that's in
- On the walls,
the rooms, and the halls

38
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:11,168
Our Dalmatian
plantation home

39
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:15,931
Dalmatian plantation,
we're home

40
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:18,404
Oh, Roger!

41
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:21,373
Yes, tomorrow
would be moving day.

42
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:23,286
Only one more night
in this little flat...

43
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,206
which was getting smaller
by the minute.

44
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:29,686
I mean, even I was beginning
to feel a bit smothered.

45
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:31,686
Really.

46
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:34,847
It was easy to see how one of
our puppies could feel...

47
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:37,244
well, just a little bit lost
in this...

48
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:39,166
sea of spots.

49
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:40,370
Hello, Patch.

50
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:42,207
Hello, mother.

51
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:43,808
Watching the television,
are We?

52
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:45,089
Yes.

53
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,166
Well, I've got to save
my spot, now, don't I?

54
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:49,564
It's the best spot,
after all!

55
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:53,773
Ahh! But you know
your show doesn't
start until after...

56
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:55,732
Dinnertime!

57
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:57,891
Oh, dear.

58
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:00,091
Oh, not again!

59
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,972
Whoo! Whoa!

60
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:04,125
Ooh. Ugh.

61
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:06,012
Ehh! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

62
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:08,848
Whoo! Ugh.

63
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:16,927
Come on, you guys!
Make room!

64
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:18,687
Ugh!

65
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:22,131
No, you don't,
Mr. Roly-poly.

66
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:23,728
One bowl at a time!

67
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,568
There must be something
in here.

68
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:58,288
Right!

69
00:05:58,695 --> 00:05:59,571
Is everybody ready
for the show?

70
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:00,770
My spot!

71
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:03,164
Thunderbo-olt...

72
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:06,292
Thunderbo-olt...

73
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,331
Ugh!

74
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,133
The Mighty Thunderbolt
Adventure Hour...

75
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:12,410
Ahhh! Whoa!

76
00:06:12,495 --> 00:06:14,850
- Heyyy!
...the one-of-a-kind
wonder dog

77
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,573
Kanine Krunchies...

78
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:18,213
the crunch your dog
loves to munch...

79
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,650
presents "The Thunderbolt
Adventure Hour,"

80
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:24,011
starring Thunderbolt,
the one-of-a-kind wonder dog!

81
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:26,086
And his trusty sidekick,
Little Lightning.

82
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:28,131
In last week's
thrilling episode,

83
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:30,092
wholesome Tommy
was kidnapped...

84
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:32,006
Help, Thunderbolt,
save me!

85
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:34,609
...and spirited away
by that black-hearted villain,

86
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:35,764
Dirty Dawson!

87
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:37,208
Help, Thunderbolt!
Save me!

88
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:39,525
Will our hero arrive
in time?

89
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,209
Help, Thunderbolt!
Save me!

90
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:44,570
What horrible fate awaits
wholesome Tommy?

91
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,134
Oh, I can hardly look!

92
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:48,331
Oh, I've seen this one.
This is brilliant!

93
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:50,804
Help, Thunderbolt!
Save me!

94
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:53,329
That mangy mutt
can't save you this time!

95
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:58,813
Hold on, Tommy!
Thunderbolt's coming!

96
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,453
- Ahh!
- Ahh! Hey!

97
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:23,095
This is just like "Double-cross
at Dead Man's Ditch,"

98
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:25,166
except that was a mine car,
not a train.

99
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:26,165
- Shh!
- Shh!

100
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:31,407
Grrrr!

101
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,852
Watch this.
Thunder's gonna grab the whip.

102
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:40,288
- Shh!
- Shh!
- Shh!
- Shh!

103
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,206
Patch, you're gonna
spoil it again!

104
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,694
They say
every dog has his day,

105
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:56,528
but this'n ain't gonna
be yours,

106
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:58,094
ya flea-bitten cur!

107
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,289
Huh?

108
00:08:05,655 --> 00:08:07,008
Ugh!

109
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:16,533
Whoa! Ahh! Ah!

110
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:18,685
Whoo-hoo! Yes! Yes!

111
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,205
Huh?

112
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,806
This ain't fair!

113
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:31,533
Oww-hoo-hoo!

114
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:46,048
What was that supposed
to be? Heh heh heh heh!

115
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:51,334
It was the most pitiful bark
I've heard yet.

116
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:55,488
Yeah, it sounded like
someone sat on a squeaky toy!

117
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:10,206
Ahh, Thunderbolt,
you're one-of-a-kind!

118
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:14,846
Wow! One-of-a-kind!

119
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:20,847
Kanine Krunchies...

120
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,244
All right, bedtime,
everyone.

121
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:24,688
- Ohhh!
- Ohhh!
- Ohhh!
- Ohhh!

122
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:29,974
But, Dad,
we're not sleepy yet.

123
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:32,285
Nanny, do you have
the new dog tags?

124
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,854
Right here.

125
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:36,449
We'll put them on
as they come up the stairs.

126
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,127
Say, kiddies!

127
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:39,773
Is your dog
a one-of-a-kind wonder dog?

128
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:41,493
If you think your pooch has
what it takes,

129
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,247
bring him down
to the London set

130
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:45,326
of Thunderbolt's exciting
new adventure,

131
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:48,248
"Thunderbolt Versus the Hound
of the Baskervilles."

132
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:49,734
Thunderbolt's in London?!

133
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:51,771
That's right!
Thunderbolt's in London.

134
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:53,811
Just follow
a Kanine Krunchies truck

135
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:55,328
down to tomorrow's auditions,

136
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,645
where one lucky pup
will win the opportunity

137
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:59,566
to appear as a guest
on the show.

138
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,327
Dad! Dad! Dad!

139
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:03,406
56, 57, 58... careful.

140
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:04,405
Ugh!

141
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:07,009
59, 60, 61, 62...

142
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:08,369
63, 64...

143
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:09,729
Dad! Dad!
I have to see Thunderbolt!

144
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,487
J-J-Just a minute, son.
I'm counting.

145
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:12,485
But, Dad!

146
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:13,803
67, 68, 69...

147
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:15,487
I've seen every episode...
all 72.

148
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,611
72, 73... 2?
Uh...

149
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:20,289
Not now, Patch.
I'm busy losing count here!

150
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,731
76, 77, 78, 79...

151
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:25,089
But, Dad!

152
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:26,528
Dad! Whoa!

153
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:28,048
81, 82, 83...

154
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:29,648
Oh! Ohh!

155
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:30,850
Oh, dear.

156
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:33,403
Uh, 98, 99, 100, 101,
102, 103, 104,

157
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:35,645
and Patch... 105.

158
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,168
105?!

159
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:39,007
Are you all right, son?

160
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:42,132
Dad, I've just got to see
Thunderbolt tomorrow.

161
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:44,524
Yes, I know,
but tomorrow is moving day.

162
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,970
You're going to love it
on the farm, son.

163
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:49,285
There are big green fields
and a stream

164
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,730
and a barn and lots
of different animals.

165
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:55,285
Hey, maybe you and I
can chase some chickens, huh?

166
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,854
Uh, sure, Dad, but...

167
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:58,527
Here we go!

168
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:02,688
"Cherry Tree Farm,
Little Tichfield, Devon." Hmm.

169
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:06,848
Why, I imagine it's
the most splendid farm
in the whole country.

170
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:09,449
Oh, Perdy...

171
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,811
The farm will be
such a wonderful place
to raise our puppies.

172
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:14,453
And best of all,

173
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:17,129
we'll be miles away from
that evil, ugly monster...

174
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:18,490
Cruella De Vil!

175
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:21,294
Now, please let me in!

176
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,565
I can't do that,
Miss De Vil.

177
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:27,215
Mr. Fenwick, please,
something, anything.

178
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:31,004
You know very well that
the terms of your probation

179
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:33,484
don't allow me
to sell you any more furs.

180
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:35,372
Not even a stole...

181
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:38,253
a muff...
a pair of mittens?

182
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:40,166
- No!
- One mitten?

183
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:41,608
No!

184
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:57,165
Could things possibly be
any worse?

185
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,246
Cruella De Vil

186
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:00,484
Cruella De Vil

187
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:02,247
Shut up, shut up,
shut up!

188
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:29,210
Ohh!

189
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:30,330
Ugh!

190
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,523
Oh!

191
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:41,654
What does Cruella De Vil
have left to live for?

192
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:52,574
- Ugh!
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

193
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:55,374
Good grief!

194
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,888
Tell me...

195
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:10,966
what do you see?

196
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:12,568
Everything.

197
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:16,250
Darkness and light,
form and content.

198
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,688
And what else?

199
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:21,529
Chaos and order,
joy and pain.

200
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:23,287
And there is more than that?

201
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:27,334
The possibility of triumph,
the certainty of defeat,

202
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:30,805
the culmination of all
I've ever reached for

203
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,886
but could not grasp!

204
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:36,251
I see everything!

205
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:39,532
I see absolutely everything!

206
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:43,608
I feel faint in the presence
of such artistic truth.

207
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:47,165
Where is the artist?
I simply must meet him!

208
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:49,052
But... you already have.

209
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:51,410
I am Lars...

210
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:55,329
and I am
an undiscovered genius.

211
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:56,928
My name is Cruella De Vil,

212
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:59,085
and I'm
an overfinanced heiress.

213
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:01,735
Your passion for my work
both repels...

214
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:05,005
...and attracts.
- Ooh.

215
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:08,132
Could you bear the sweet
agony of seeing more?

216
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,126
You mean there's more?

217
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:14,693
Spots!

218
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:18,165
Spots! Spots! Spots!

219
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:21,406
I have yet to find anyone
who truly understood

220
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:24,089
their bleak
but beautiful meaning...

221
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:27,690
that is...
until I met you.

222
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:28,844
This could be it!

223
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,085
This could be
the cure for my craving!

224
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:34,053
My analyst said I should find
something to substitute

225
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:35,853
for my magnificent
obsession.

226
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:42,814
Who needs furs
when I can soothe
my tortured soul with art?!

227
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:44,089
Something tortures you?

228
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:48,248
Tell me what cloud dares
cast a shadow on...

229
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:49,893
the flower?

230
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:53,570
Oh, it's a sad
but familiar tale of
loss and disappointment,

231
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:55,885
probation,
and a restraining order.

232
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,488
But you...

233
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:59,691
you can help Cruella
to forget all that.

234
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:03,051
Will you do a painting
just for me...

235
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,568
to ease my pain?

236
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:08,534
I will create
a masterpiece,

237
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:12,290
if you will be my...
muse.

238
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,935
Ooh. Oh, darling.

239
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:48,004
Ohh.

240
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:15,087
Ahhh.

241
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,689
6...

242
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,254
7...

243
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:20,927
26...

244
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,085
202.

245
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:24,494
Dad?

246
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,008
97...

247
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,653
I can't sleep.

248
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:30,044
- 98...
- I've been thinking.

249
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:32,091
90...

250
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:35,087
Do you think
I'm one-of-a-kind

251
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:39,327
or just...
one of 101?

252
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,532
101. That's it.

253
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,253
101.

254
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,575
All right, everyone,
into the truck!

255
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:33,973
You're 90,
you're 91, you're 92,

256
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:35,534
you're 93, you're 94.

257
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:37,412
Hold it. Wait.
You're 98, you're 99...

258
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:38,894
you're 100...

259
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,408
and you're 101.

260
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:42,326
And you're 101,
and you're 101.

261
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:43,768
Hold it. Wait.

262
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,164
How many 101 s are there?

263
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:48,769
Well, I've successfully
lost count again.

264
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:50,925
Right.
Anyone not here, speak up.

265
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:57,694
Oh, no!

266
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:00,767
Wait! Wait for me!

267
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:04,086
Well, that figures.

268
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:07,292
They didn't even miss me.

269
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:16,484
Then I'm not gonna miss
them!

270
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,007
Well,
what do you think?

271
00:18:43,095 --> 00:18:47,805
Why, it's splendid!

272
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:51,046
Puppies, welcome
to your new home!

273
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:54,366
Right then.
That's 1 and 2 and, uh...

274
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:59,006
37, 36, 5, 50, 8, um...
minus 2, carry the 3, and, um...

275
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:00,574
101?

276
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:03,852
Finally, no more counting.

277
00:19:11,815 --> 00:19:13,851
Huh?

278
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:17,004
Waaa!

279
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:27,166
All this place needs
is a proper dusting,
a splash of paint,

280
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:30,645
and it'll be good as new.

281
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:33,693
Now, where do you suppose
we'll put the music room?

282
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:41,053
I think you just found it,
darling.

283
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:42,454
Thunderbo-olt

284
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:45,333
Hounding hoodlums
with a howl... hear his growl

285
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:46,894
Thunderbo-olt

286
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:48,488
Desperadoes,
cringe in fear...

287
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:52,727
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

288
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:55,454
pooches and pups of all ages,

289
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:57,526
are you ready?!

290
00:19:57,615 --> 00:20:03,133
Desperadoes, cringe in fear.
Mighty Thunderbolt is here!

291
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:09,688
I don't believe it!

292
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,686
It's really him!

293
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:14,687
And here's his sidekick
extraordinaire,

294
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:17,892
the ever-trusty
Little Lightning!

295
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,608
- Yoo-hoo!
- Hello, handsome!

296
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:29,051
Over here,
you gorgeous hunk o' hound.

297
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:32,252
Oh, uh, hi, ladies.
Nice to meet you.

298
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:34,007
- Oh, no.
- We don't want you.

299
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:36,655
Get out of the way.
We want...

300
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,566
Thunderbolt!

301
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,249
- Ooh.
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

302
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:44,691
Sorry, little buddy,
but these ladies aren't
interested in the sidekick.

303
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:47,573
They're here to get
a big eyeful of...

304
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:49,008
hero!

305
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:50,687
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

306
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:52,606
Heel, ladies, heel.

307
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:53,571
Thunderbolt!

308
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:55,486
All right, everybody.

309
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:57,486
Line up your dogs
for the audition.

310
00:20:57,575 --> 00:21:00,533
We need to hear
their best heroic bark.

311
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,894
V-Very good.

312
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:21,367
Hey, that's very...

313
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:23,571
Oh, there's more!

314
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:29,093
Ugh!

315
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:35,012
Well... go ahead.

316
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,767
Uh...

317
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,490
What's the matter,
little fella?

318
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:42,965
Cat got your tongue?

319
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:45,808
Oh, that's funny,
'cause, you see, we're dogs,

320
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:48,693
and we chase cats, so...

321
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,606
Ah, well, it made me laugh.

322
00:21:50,695 --> 00:21:53,289
Come on, kid,
we haven't got all year.

323
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,491
You're wasting
my valuable limelight.

324
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:03,611
Say, who sat
on the squeaky toy?

325
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:07,288
Hey, Thunderbolt,
over here!

326
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:13,566
Thunderbo-olt...

327
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:16,613
That's it, folks!
We'll announce the winner
of the audition tomorrow!

328
00:22:16,695 --> 00:22:18,731
Have a megafantabulous day!

329
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:24,094
And remember, buy your pooch
lots and lots of tasty
Kanine Krunchies!

330
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:25,688
...only in the night

331
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:36,974
Nice work, Patch,
just brilliant.

332
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:45,767
Ladies, ladies,
you're wearing me out.

333
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:48,892
Oh, please?
Just do it one more time.

334
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:54,049
Oh, well, all right.
I guess just one more time
couldn't hurt.

335
00:22:55,135 --> 00:22:57,603
- Aaah.
- Aaah.
- Aaah.

336
00:22:57,695 --> 00:22:59,367
Golly, I'm good.

337
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:01,047
Hello, boys!

338
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:14,408
- Thunder!
- Lightning, little buddy.

339
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:16,292
It's just awful!

340
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,843
- Ooh. Ahh.
- I overheard
what they're planning
for the next episode.

341
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:21,004
Growl!

342
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:23,165
Bump!

343
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:27,005
Ah, don't be too harsh
on them, little buddy.

344
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:29,404
I know we don't have
the best writers in television,

345
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:31,008
but we can always improvise.

346
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:33,051
I'm pretty good
at improvising...

347
00:23:33,135 --> 00:23:35,808
as long as
it's written down for me.

348
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:39,570
No, no, you don't understand.
Something really horrible
is going to happen.

349
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:41,725
Ooh, ooh, don't tell me.
Let me guess.

350
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:44,045
- The dam breaks.
The mine collapses.
- No. No.

351
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:46,205
Do I get an evil twin?
I've always wanted
an evil twin.

352
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:49,970
No! Listen, Thunder, what
happens is you... you...

353
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,329
Huh?

354
00:23:51,415 --> 00:23:52,689
You die.

355
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:58,209
I don't believe it.
L-I die?

356
00:23:58,295 --> 00:24:02,766
Oh, Lightning,
this is just... about
the greatest thing ever!

357
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:06,291
Ha ha!
I've always wanted to play
a big death scene...

358
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:10,254
the selfless hero
who sacrifices himself
to save the innocent.

359
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:11,814
Ha ha!

360
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:15,968
I'll kick bigger
than Old Yeller! Ha ha ha!

361
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:19,730
So, how do I make
my shockingly unexpected
and triumphant return?

362
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:22,204
- You don't.
- What do you mean,
I don't?

363
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:26,004
You don't make
a shockingly unexpected
and triumphant return.

364
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:29,326
You die. You're dead.
You never come back.

365
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:32,054
N-Not even
for a reunion show?

366
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:34,774
Not even for a cameo
in the remake.

367
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:38,689
They're writing me
out of the show!

368
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:41,005
They're gonna replace you
with a younger dog.

369
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:46,123
Oh, so that's
what those auditions
were really all about.

370
00:24:46,215 --> 00:24:48,092
Oh, Lightning,
you gotta help me.

371
00:24:48,175 --> 00:24:51,963
I can't end up
on the street, homeless,
foraging in trash cans.

372
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,615
Mange! I could get mange!

373
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:58,973
Well, I... I did have
this one crazy thought.

374
00:24:59,055 --> 00:25:01,444
Or ticks!
I hate ticks!

375
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:05,414
They suck all the blood
out of you, do you hear me?!

376
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:10,489
They suck all the blood
out of yo-o-o-o-u!

377
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:14,335
What if... you went out
and did something heroic,

378
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:17,407
like you do on the show,
but in the real world?

379
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:19,133
You know, get your name
in the paper...

380
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:20,728
prove to 'em
that you still got it.

381
00:25:20,815 --> 00:25:22,453
Wait a minute.

382
00:25:22,535 --> 00:25:27,165
What if... I went out
and did something heroic
in the real world?

383
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:29,689
Or... that could work, too.

384
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:33,245
After all, you are
the one-of-a-kind wonder dog.
How hard could it be?

385
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:36,133
- Yeah, it'll be a catwalk.
- Cakewalk.

386
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:41,130
Pre-cisely. I'll just
go get a little press for
doing some easy hero stuff,

387
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:43,410
and they'll be begging
to keep me on the show.

388
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:45,850
But first... I'll have
to figure out a way

389
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:49,894
to sneak past
my adoring public.

390
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:54,493
Hmm?

391
00:25:56,895 --> 00:26:01,605
Hmm. Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak,
sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak,
sneak. Hide.

392
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:05,085
Hmm. Ha ha.
Master of disguise.

393
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:06,688
- Hi, Thunderbolt!
- Aaaaah!

394
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:09,972
Oh, I'm sorry.
You've got the wrong dog, kid.

395
00:26:10,055 --> 00:26:11,408
I know it's you.

396
00:26:11,495 --> 00:26:14,612
That's the same disguise
you used in episode 18...

397
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:16,606
"Gambling Gophers
of Gunfire Gulch."

398
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:21,007
Oh! For howling out loud!
Now you've blown my cover.

399
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:23,734
This is champion!
I'm your biggest fan,
Thunderbolt!

400
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:27,171
I know every episode by heart.

401
00:26:27,255 --> 00:26:29,405
Remember the time when you
fought that grizzly bear

402
00:26:29,495 --> 00:26:32,168
and rescued those orphans
and then the dam broke
and... and...

403
00:26:32,255 --> 00:26:34,769
Hey, aren't you
the squeaky toy?

404
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:37,164
Yeah. Heh. That's me.

405
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:38,688
- Listen, pup...
- Patch.

406
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:40,970
Pooch... whatever.
You've got to understand,

407
00:26:41,055 --> 00:26:44,730
sometimes danger and I
like to dance alone!

408
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:48,088
Good gracious gravy,
look at that!

409
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:49,574
A cat is stuck
up in that tree!

410
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:51,327
He is?

411
00:26:51,415 --> 00:26:56,330
Oh, my heart goes
out to the poor,
helpless creature.

412
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,292
Now, if I were me,
what would I do?

413
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,730
Well, I'd read the script.
That's what I'd do.

414
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:03,454
Oh, no!
I don't have a script!

415
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,925
This is just like when
Tommy was trapped on that
cliff in episode 29.

416
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:09,734
- That one was a classic.
- Okay, okay, don't panic.
You can do this.

417
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:12,727
- Only it's also like
episode 64...
- You can do this.
You can do this.

418
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:14,168
- When he was drowning
in the water tower.
- You can't do this!
You can't do this!

419
00:27:14,255 --> 00:27:16,644
- Yeah, that was great.
- You can't do this!
Who am I kidding?!

420
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,885
I have no idea
what I'm doing!

421
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:20,567
But episode 29
is still the best,

422
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:21,849
at least
from the first season.

423
00:27:21,935 --> 00:27:23,414
- Pooch...
- Patch.

424
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:25,690
- Whatever.
I'm trying to panic here!
- Oh, sorry.

425
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:29,051
I just thought you were
gonna do what you did
on Raccoon Ridge...

426
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:32,093
you know, when you got
that barrel and dragged it
next to the cliff

427
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:33,927
and you found
a long plank of wood

428
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:36,165
and got a great, big,
round boulder, and then...

429
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,405
Pre-cisely!

430
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:41,931
Whoa!

431
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:45,769
Ohh!

432
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:48,963
Hang on, little kitty!

433
00:27:49,055 --> 00:27:50,807
Help is on the way!

434
00:27:50,895 --> 00:27:54,012
Heh heh heh.
The press is gonna love this.

435
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:58,969
Aah!

436
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,854
Phew.

437
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,724
There you are,
my good man.

438
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:14,089
No need to thank me.

439
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:16,484
The look on your face
is thanks enough.

440
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:19,965
Now smile for the cameras.

441
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:22,888
Hey, that's strange.
Where are all the photographers?

442
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:25,535
The press is always around
when I do something.

443
00:28:25,615 --> 00:28:28,083
What's the matter
with you English people?

444
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:30,291
Are you all having tea?

445
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,287
How am I supposed
to get my job back
if you're all having tea?!

446
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:36,333
That was champion, Thunder,
just like on the telly!

447
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,849
You know, this stuff
isn't as easy as it looks.

448
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:40,573
I mean, maybe if I could
remember what happened

449
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:45,046
in every episode of the show,
you know, like squeaky toy
here, then I could...

450
00:28:45,135 --> 00:28:49,890
Hey, squeaky toy.

451
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:57,050
Oh, darling,
it's just divine!

452
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,205
It's remarkable!

453
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:01,445
It's stunning!
It's grand!

454
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:03,093
But it's all wrong.

455
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:07,771
But... but it... it's
my best work yet... cupcake.

456
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:10,813
But it simply has to be better
than your best, darling.

457
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:12,851
I mean,
look at these spots.

458
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:15,574
Oh, the shapes
aren't at all acceptable.

459
00:29:15,655 --> 00:29:20,570
They're not... soft enough...
you know, cuddly...

460
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:23,294
like something you want
to squeeze the life out of!

461
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,411
Oh, no, this one
is no good at all...

462
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:29,170
an embarrassing mediocrity,
a complete failure!

463
00:29:29,255 --> 00:29:33,806
Your harsh words strike me
like blows from the fists
of a large dockworker.

464
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:37,012
I would cry now...
were it not so bourgeois.

465
00:29:37,095 --> 00:29:38,767
There, there.

466
00:29:38,855 --> 00:29:41,244
I know you'll get it right,
my depressive Da Vinci.

467
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:43,246
You simply have to keep
trying.

468
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:47,248
After all, you're the only one
who truly understands Cruella,

469
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:50,930
who can see
into her tortured soul.

470
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:54,371
Yes! Her heart is like
a vast, dark ocean

471
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:57,527
on whose waves
I am hopelessly adrift

472
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:02,484
in my dinghy of passion.

473
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:04,964
I shall not betray
your faith in me!

474
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:07,171
I shall create
another canvas,

475
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:09,689
and another and another
and another,

476
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:13,211
until I have found
spotted perfection!

477
00:30:13,295 --> 00:30:18,164
I shall not stop until
the fires of your craving

478
00:30:18,255 --> 00:30:21,247
have been quenched!

479
00:30:21,335 --> 00:30:25,613
Junior deputy test?
Which episode was that in?

480
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:27,287
Uh, one of
the lost episodes.

481
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:31,687
But I only give it to pups
who I think might be worthy.

482
00:30:31,775 --> 00:30:33,845
And who knows?
If you do real good,

483
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:36,369
maybe I'll even let you
be on the show with me.

484
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:38,252
Really?

485
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:41,566
Sure, kid.
I'm the star, aren't I?

486
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:43,452
Mother
of pasteurised milk!

487
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:45,366
That stagecoach
is out of control!

488
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:48,413
This is your first
junior deputy test, kid.

489
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:52,454
Okay. Well... this is
just like in episode 37,

490
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:55,607
"Stagecoaches
of Serpent Summit."

491
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:57,890
Very good.
Now, episode 37...

492
00:30:57,975 --> 00:31:01,206
was that the one where
I leap, run, and pounce?

493
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:03,729
No, no. That was the one
where you run, pounce,
and leap.

494
00:31:03,815 --> 00:31:08,331
Pre-cisely! Stand back!

495
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:13,250
Caboodle lay-dee-ooh-ooh

496
00:31:13,335 --> 00:31:15,371
Caboodle lay-dee-ooh

497
00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:18,015
Get hold of yourself, man!
You're out of control!

498
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:23,364
- Whoa!
- It's okay!
I'll get the brake.

499
00:31:23,455 --> 00:31:25,127
Caboodle lay-dee-ee-ooh

500
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:36,289
Still no photographers.

501
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,570
- How odd.
- Aah!
- Aah!

502
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:41,215
There may be days
when things don't go right

503
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:43,684
And your shoes
refuse to dance

504
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:46,335
To make the winds of fortune
blow right

505
00:31:46,415 --> 00:31:48,804
You might need
a second chance

506
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:51,932
So if you get one try
and that don't fly

507
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:54,245
Stop and count to 10

508
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:57,884
And if at first
you don't succeed

509
00:31:57,975 --> 00:31:59,294
Try again

510
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,649
Here's your next test,
kid.

511
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:04,045
Wow! Banque robbers!

512
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:07,172
Uh... episode 4.

513
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:09,894
Beginner's luck
is overrated

514
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:12,125
- Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
- Once you blink,
it's come and gone

515
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:14,775
- Aaaaaah!
- The only way
to cultivate it

516
00:32:14,855 --> 00:32:17,085
Is to keep on keepin' on

517
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:20,167
- Yeah
- Hmm? Still no photographers?

518
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:22,371
Try and try and then

519
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:25,686
If at first
you don't succeed, yeah

520
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:27,049
Try again

521
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:28,250
Try, try again

522
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:29,290
Yes, my friend

523
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:31,286
Try, try, try again

524
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:33,525
Those men
are frozen with fear.

525
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:37,528
No wonder.
Those crazed badgers are
trying to eat their heads!

526
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:42,564
It's just like in
episode 27 when you
whupped those two grizzlies!

527
00:32:42,655 --> 00:32:44,168
- Caboodle
lay-dee-ooh-ooh
- Huh?
- Huh?

528
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:47,133
Eeeb-a-dee-bop
sa-dum-wa-dum

529
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,013
Caboodle lay-dee-ooh-ooh

530
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:52,290
And don't you ever stop, no

531
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,253
Caboodle lay-dee-ee-ee

532
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:58,008
Mimmy-zop ba-dum, wa-dum,
yeah

533
00:32:58,095 --> 00:32:59,528
What is it?

534
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:02,573
Looks like we've stumbled
on a band of cattle rustlers.

535
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:04,168
Uh, aren't those monkeys?

536
00:33:04,255 --> 00:33:06,246
Even worse...
monkey rustlers!

537
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:08,405
Sounds like episode 34
to me.

538
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:12,283
Right answer once again...
junior deputy.

539
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:15,173
- I passed the test?!
- Think you can handle it?

540
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:18,372
You bet! Let's get
those monkey rustlers!

541
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,332
Now, if you find
you're batting zero

542
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,246
And a legend you are not

543
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,926
You can still wind up
a hero

544
00:33:26,015 --> 00:33:27,767
If you give it
one more shot

545
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:30,323
If you don't give in,
you're gonna win

546
00:33:30,415 --> 00:33:33,373
The only question's "When?"

547
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:35,764
So if at first
you don't succeed

548
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:36,924
Blech!

549
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:37,845
Try again

550
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,733
Try, try, try again

551
00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:42,168
Try, try again

552
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:43,449
And again, yeah

553
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:44,331
Try, try, try again

554
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:45,848
Try again

555
00:33:45,935 --> 00:33:47,209
Try, try, try again

556
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:49,650
Try again

557
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:53,364
Hey, get over on the right
side of the road, buddy!

558
00:33:53,455 --> 00:33:55,332
Sheesh! London drivers.

559
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,008
I told you, Thunder.

560
00:33:58,095 --> 00:34:01,451
This is the best day ever!

561
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:04,288
Yeah. You know,
I never knew it would be
so much fun out here

562
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,252
doing this real hero
stuff.

563
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,054
What do you mean?
Don't you do this
all the time?

564
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:15,451
Oh, well, kid, uh...

565
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:17,366
Well, you know, it's, uh...

566
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,970
Of course I do! Ha!
I do this all the time.

567
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:25,369
So, let's talk
about you, kid.

568
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:26,808
Me?

569
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:28,567
- Yeah. What's your story?
- Well, uh...

570
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:31,533
Hold on. Okay, go on.

571
00:34:31,615 --> 00:34:34,175
Missing?! What do you mean,
he's missing?!

572
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:35,927
- We've looked...
- And looked...

573
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:38,290
But there's just no sign
of Thunderbolt anywhere.

574
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,730
This is a catastrophe...
a calamity...

575
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:42,248
- a cataclysm!
- Ohh!

576
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:44,326
We have to shoot first thing
in the morning,

577
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,053
and I find out
my star is missing!

578
00:34:46,135 --> 00:34:48,330
How can you shoot a show
without a star?!

579
00:34:48,415 --> 00:34:51,566
How... can you shoot...
a show without... a star?!

580
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,293
How do you spell
"cataclysm"?

581
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,525
How can you shoot a show
without a star?

582
00:34:55,615 --> 00:35:00,086
How can you shoot a show
without a...

583
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:03,287
A star.

584
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,206
This is it.
This is megafantabulous!

585
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:07,729
We'll rewrite this episode
and star Little Lightning!

586
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,043
I'm a genius!

587
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:10,693
Get the writers!
Fire the director!

588
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,208
This is going to be
a whole new direction

589
00:35:12,295 --> 00:35:13,853
for "The Thunderbolt
Adventure Hour"!

590
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:21,366
A whole new direction.
What do you think of that?!

591
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,127
Thunderbolt, old pal,

592
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:26,366
finally I'll be able
to step out of your shadow,

593
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:28,730
you overrated,
overacting ham!

594
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:32,012
"The Little Lightning
Adventure Hour"...

595
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:35,565
it has a nice ring,
doesn't it? Hmm?
What do you think?

596
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:41,053
I have failed you, my muse.

597
00:35:41,135 --> 00:35:45,845
Oh, fickle bird
of inspiration,

598
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:50,087
to what far shore
have you flown?!

599
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:52,769
Oh, poor, pathetic Lars,
do not despair.

600
00:35:52,855 --> 00:35:56,211
I know exactly where to find
the inspiration we crave.

601
00:35:56,295 --> 00:35:58,172
Oh, this is art,
after all.

602
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:01,008
Art! Our creativity
cannot be thwarted

603
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:04,167
by trivial matters
like restraining orders.

604
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:08,009
Yes!
Sacrifices must be made!

605
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:11,007
Gone? They're all gone?!

606
00:36:11,095 --> 00:36:14,087
How unspeakably rude
of Anita to move away

607
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:17,167
without even leaving
a forwarding address.

608
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:20,611
Oh, Lars,
now what am I to do?

609
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:24,485
Why, you little...
What's this?

610
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:27,567
I know you.

611
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:30,772
Oh, this is delicious!

612
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,528
"Cherry Tree Farm,
Little Tichfield, Devon."

613
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,526
Oh, no.

614
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:50,972
Freckles, dear,
stop helping.

615
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:58,092
Oh, my! The tea!

616
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:02,570
Uhh! Yes, the paper.

617
00:37:02,655 --> 00:37:05,169
No time to read this

618
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:08,531
if I'm going to finish
my new song.

619
00:37:11,455 --> 00:37:14,094
Well, I come from
this really big family.

620
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:16,894
I knew a guy
who came from a big litter...

621
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:19,853
10 or 12.
I forget.

622
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:21,527
There's 101 of us.

623
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:24,812
101 Dalmatians?!
Hey, I heard about you guys.

624
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:27,534
Yeah, you were
on the Twilight Bark.

625
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:30,209
Well, that's just it,
isn't it?

626
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:33,605
I'm afraid all I'll ever be
is one of 101.

627
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:36,368
At least
that's what my dad thinks.

628
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:40,695
Hey, Thunderbolt,
how do you become

629
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:43,414
a one-of-a-kind
wonder dog anyway?

630
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:47,488
Well, in my case,
it all hinged on getting
just the right agent.

631
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:51,090
But, you know, kid,
getting there isn't so tough.

632
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:54,531
It's staying on top.
That's the real challenge.

633
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:56,845
You think
you're doing great,

634
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:59,733
and all of a sudden
there's somebody trying
to take your place.

635
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:01,407
- Crowd you out.
- Push you aside.

636
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:03,326
Steal your spot!

637
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,087
Pre-cisely!

638
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:07,086
Pre-cisely!

639
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:09,894
You know,
you're all right, kid.

640
00:38:12,135 --> 00:38:14,285
I'll tell you what,
little buddy...

641
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,128
I'm planning on doing
some more big-hero
stuff today.

642
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:18,694
You stick with me.

643
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:20,925
Maybe you'll get
your picture in the paper,

644
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:24,132
show the world that you're
not just another dog.

645
00:38:25,575 --> 00:38:30,933
No, no, no, like this.
Ahem.

646
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:48,127
Uh-oh.

647
00:38:58,015 --> 00:38:59,050
What?!

648
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:01,251
Patch? In London?!

649
00:39:01,335 --> 00:39:04,691
Don't you worry. I'll
keep an eye on things here.

650
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:07,767
This is all my fault.
If only I hadn't lost count.

651
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:09,493
Oh, stop blaming
yourself, dear.

652
00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:11,691
The important thing now
is that we find him

653
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:13,686
before
Cruella De Vil does.

654
00:39:17,175 --> 00:39:20,247
It's not fair, Horace,
me lad.

655
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:22,087
It's just not fair.

656
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:23,608
How come she gets off

657
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,606
with probation
and a restraining order...

658
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:27,492
While we's left
rottin' away in here.

659
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,054
Off your bums, lads.

660
00:39:29,135 --> 00:39:31,365
Sprung for your bail,
somebody has.

661
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:33,525
It must be Mum
come to spring us.

662
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:34,934
Mum never liked me.

663
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:36,653
It must be good ol' Dad.

664
00:39:36,735 --> 00:39:39,295
Dad never liked you either.

665
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,605
Jasper, Horace!

666
00:39:41,695 --> 00:39:42,332
- Aah!
- Aah!

667
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:44,724
It's time to finish the job.

668
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,328
Oh, no, not her!

669
00:39:46,415 --> 00:39:48,804
We always get the worst end
of it with her.

670
00:39:48,895 --> 00:39:50,248
Well, if she wants us

671
00:39:50,335 --> 00:39:52,007
to work for her
this time,

672
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:55,371
we won't be made fools of.

673
00:39:55,455 --> 00:39:57,685
You look just like Mum.

674
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:59,288
Shut up, you!

675
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:01,605
I ain't going through
with this, I tell you!

676
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:02,889
I ain't!

677
00:40:02,975 --> 00:40:04,328
Here he comes now!

678
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:06,246
Whoa!

679
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:09,208
- Go on, Jasper.
- Go! Go on! Go!

680
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:17,287
Afternoon, love.

681
00:40:18,735 --> 00:40:20,088
Something I can... aah!

682
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:22,484
Hello, there!

683
00:40:22,575 --> 00:40:24,327
Uh, uh,
something I can do

684
00:40:24,415 --> 00:40:28,010
for a pretty
young lady like yourself?

685
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:30,848
Of course you can,
you naughty man!

686
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:35,293
You can
just give me this truck!

687
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,091
What?!

688
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:50,809
Whoo-hoo!

689
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:52,647
They're all inside,
Jasper.

690
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:54,407
Go ahead and start it up.

691
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:00,886
Whatever in the world?

692
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:02,374
Hmm?

693
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,047
Ow!

694
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:08,648
Hey, where's he going?

695
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:12,086
- Kanine Krunchies!
- Kanine Krunchies!

696
00:41:13,535 --> 00:41:15,287
Hey, it's
Kanine Krunchies!

697
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:24,604
Oh, my!

698
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:26,128
Yippee!

699
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:30,924
Mmm! Yummy!

700
00:41:32,815 --> 00:41:35,170
Whoo-hoo.
It worked, Jasper.

701
00:41:35,255 --> 00:41:38,372
Like a dream,
Horace, me lad.

702
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,808
Like a dream.

703
00:41:39,895 --> 00:41:40,930
You?!

704
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:43,483
I should have known
it was you terrible men!

705
00:41:43,575 --> 00:41:45,611
Now let those puppies go
right now,

706
00:41:45,695 --> 00:41:48,926
or I'm going to
knock the stupid
out of both of you!

707
00:41:49,015 --> 00:41:50,289
Here now, lady.

708
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,127
We don't want to have
to hurt you none.

709
00:41:52,215 --> 00:41:53,728
So...

710
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:55,806
Aaah!

711
00:41:57,495 --> 00:41:59,247
Uh...

712
00:42:00,655 --> 00:42:01,644
Come on!

713
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:03,168
Ohh!

714
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:04,244
Ow!

715
00:42:05,415 --> 00:42:06,928
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

716
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:09,165
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

717
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:10,210
Whoa!

718
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:14,928
Aaah!

719
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:16,130
- Ugh!
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

720
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:21,171
Right.
That's it, then!

721
00:42:21,255 --> 00:42:23,132
I've had just about enough
of this!

722
00:42:23,215 --> 00:42:24,534
Ohh!

723
00:42:24,615 --> 00:42:26,014
Oh, no!

724
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:27,130
There, now.

725
00:42:27,215 --> 00:42:29,524
That ought to hold you
right proper.

726
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:31,173
- Jasper.
- What?

727
00:42:31,255 --> 00:42:34,372
Can we just go back
to gaol now?

728
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:38,885
Your muse has returned!

729
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,806
But I am a failure.

730
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:43,125
You should despise me.

731
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:47,645
Oh, stop being
such a wet blanket

732
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:50,044
and come see
what I've brought for you.

733
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:52,729
A gift... for me?

734
00:42:52,815 --> 00:42:55,807
How very "Christmas morning
with the twinkle lights" of you.

735
00:42:55,895 --> 00:42:58,409
A gift of inspiration!

736
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:04,969
Well, of course.

737
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:06,773
These are only...

738
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:09,847
just about the most adorable
little puppies

739
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:12,244
I've ever seen
in my whole life!

740
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:14,007
Look at these cute
little darlings!

741
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:16,450
Oh, a fuzzy wuzzy
little puppy poo!

742
00:43:16,535 --> 00:43:18,253
Poo-poo.
Little puppy poo.

743
00:43:18,335 --> 00:43:19,654
Did you see that?!

744
00:43:19,735 --> 00:43:21,612
Did you see that?!

745
00:43:21,695 --> 00:43:23,686
He gave me a widdle kissy!

746
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,128
I'm gonna kiss him back.

747
00:43:25,215 --> 00:43:26,728
He's havin' a wobbly.

748
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:30,012
And you mean for me to do
a painting of them, don't you?

749
00:43:30,095 --> 00:43:32,404
That's an absolutely
lovely idea!

750
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:34,008
It makes me smile a lot.

751
00:43:34,095 --> 00:43:36,325
"Painting of them," he says.

752
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,085
No, no, no, darling.

753
00:43:40,175 --> 00:43:42,564
I don't want you to make art
of the puppies.

754
00:43:42,655 --> 00:43:44,771
I want you to make art
with the puppies.

755
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,254
Use their coats as canvases.

756
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:48,644
Create a masterpiece
in a new medium.

757
00:43:48,735 --> 00:43:51,374
Together you and I will
stun the art world

758
00:43:51,455 --> 00:43:54,015
with our ruthless
originality!

759
00:43:54,095 --> 00:43:56,006
But that means...

760
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:59,690
How could you do such a thing
to the cute little puppies?

761
00:43:59,775 --> 00:44:00,810
- Poison them.
- Drown them.

762
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,692
Bash them in the head.

763
00:44:02,775 --> 00:44:05,687
I may be eccentric,
but I am not a sicko!

764
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:07,572
- What?!
- You'll not hurt one spot

765
00:44:07,655 --> 00:44:09,930
on these innocent
little creatures' heads!

766
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:12,529
Not as long as I have anything
to say about it!

767
00:44:14,095 --> 00:44:15,767
I thought you were
a man of vision,

768
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:17,811
someone who understood
my passions,

769
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:20,363
who understood the complexity
that is Cruella!

770
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:22,685
Does no one get the point?!

771
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:27,333
Oh, Lars, you're such
a disappointment.

772
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,325
Oh, well.

773
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,087
If I can't have
a masterpiece,

774
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:32,814
at least I'll finally have
a fabulous Dalmatian coat.

775
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,692
That's almost as good.

776
00:44:34,775 --> 00:44:36,128
Don't you agree?

777
00:44:58,135 --> 00:44:59,488
Ooh!

778
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:01,167
What has gotten
into you, girl?

779
00:45:16,495 --> 00:45:18,292
- Aah!
- Aah!

780
00:45:30,935 --> 00:45:33,768
Kidnapped?!
How many?

781
00:45:36,015 --> 00:45:37,164
Phew!

782
00:45:40,775 --> 00:45:42,686
Oh!

783
00:45:42,775 --> 00:45:43,764
Ohh!

784
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:44,844
Ugh!

785
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:55,009
Uh-huh.

786
00:45:55,095 --> 00:45:56,323
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

787
00:45:56,415 --> 00:45:57,734
Wretched dogs!

788
00:46:00,055 --> 00:46:01,249
Oh!

789
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:03,810
Ugh!

790
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:16,654
I just
can't understand it.

791
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:18,930
We've been out here doing
hero stuff all day,

792
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:21,245
and none of these
London photographers

793
00:46:21,335 --> 00:46:22,688
seem to care.

794
00:46:22,775 --> 00:46:24,845
Why do you want
photographers around?

795
00:46:24,935 --> 00:46:26,766
Aw, kid.

796
00:46:26,855 --> 00:46:28,811
Look, I got something
to tell you.

797
00:46:28,895 --> 00:46:32,524
Something I guess I should have
told you a long time ago.

798
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:34,890
Oh, I don't know how to say
this, but the truth is...

799
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:35,964
Thunderbolt, listen!

800
00:46:37,735 --> 00:46:39,248
There's an emergency!

801
00:46:40,775 --> 00:46:42,413
Sounds like a kidnapping!

802
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:44,486
Hmm.
Being held in a warehouse.

803
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:46,054
A devil woman!

804
00:46:46,135 --> 00:46:47,648
101 Dalmatians.

805
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:49,691
Hey, what a coincidence.

806
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:52,164
You come from a family
of 101, too.

807
00:46:52,255 --> 00:46:54,132
What...
what's the matter, kid?

808
00:46:54,215 --> 00:46:57,127
That is my family.
Cruella must have them again.

809
00:46:57,215 --> 00:46:58,125
Cruella?!

810
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,443
The devil woman!

811
00:46:59,535 --> 00:47:01,765
She's the one
who kidnapped us before.

812
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:04,289
Oh, this is awful.

813
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:07,253
What am I going to do?

814
00:47:07,335 --> 00:47:10,247
Wait a second...
Thunderbolt!

815
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,973
You'll help us, won't you?

816
00:47:12,055 --> 00:47:13,204
Yes...

817
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:17,573
well, kid, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

818
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:20,328
You see,
I'm not really a...

819
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:27,734
Of course I'll help you,
Patch.

820
00:47:27,815 --> 00:47:28,930
Yeah!

821
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:31,575
The world-famous
Thunderbolt

822
00:47:31,655 --> 00:47:35,011
rescues the world-famous
101 Dalmatians.

823
00:47:35,095 --> 00:47:36,210
Ha!

824
00:47:36,295 --> 00:47:38,684
Sounds like
a good story to me.

825
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:41,164
Newsworthy even.

826
00:47:41,255 --> 00:47:42,574
Come on!

827
00:47:42,655 --> 00:47:44,805
We'll let them know
I'm on my way.

828
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,284
The villains
will soon cringe in fear!

829
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:50,447
Mighty Thunderbolt
is here!

830
00:47:59,855 --> 00:48:01,652
Oh, it's just wonderful.

831
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:03,726
I heard it through
the Twilight Bark.

832
00:48:03,815 --> 00:48:05,328
Tell all.

833
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:08,054
Thunderbolt is going to save
those little Dalmatian puppies.

834
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,966
The ones
that were kidnapped?

835
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,534
That's right.

836
00:48:11,615 --> 00:48:13,685
Oh, isn't he
just a dream?

837
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:15,174
More like a nightmare.

838
00:48:15,255 --> 00:48:17,723
What if "Blunderbolt"
gets lucky and succeeds?

839
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:19,726
If the press got wind of that,

840
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,568
l-I'd never be rid of him.

841
00:48:27,175 --> 00:48:29,131
Look... that must be
the warehouse.

842
00:48:29,215 --> 00:48:31,524
Let's try over there.

843
00:48:31,615 --> 00:48:34,083
Hey, do you think
you can reach that?

844
00:48:34,175 --> 00:48:35,369
No problem.

845
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,286
Thunderbolt, old pal!

846
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,728
- Lightning?
- Lightning!

847
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:39,964
What are you doing here?

848
00:48:40,055 --> 00:48:41,090
I came
as soon as I heard.

849
00:48:41,175 --> 00:48:42,608
Thought you might need
a bit of help.

850
00:48:42,695 --> 00:48:45,004
Thanks for coming,
little buddy.

851
00:48:45,095 --> 00:48:46,687
Wouldn't miss it.

852
00:48:57,095 --> 00:49:00,132
What's that supposed to be?

853
00:49:00,215 --> 00:49:02,775
Oh, leave us alone, Jasper.

854
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:04,288
I think
it's kind of pretty.

855
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,808
So, what's the plan, kid?

856
00:49:05,895 --> 00:49:07,089
See those guards?

857
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:09,848
I think you can sneak
past them.

858
00:49:09,935 --> 00:49:11,732
Remember the end
of episode 39,

859
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:13,931
"The Flight
From the Forbidden Fort"?

860
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:16,245
The one where I ran,
jumped, and sprang?

861
00:49:16,335 --> 00:49:19,293
No, no, sneaked, evaded,
and triumphed.

862
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,843
Oh, yeah!
Of course!

863
00:49:21,935 --> 00:49:22,970
I get it.

864
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:24,932
Hey, you're a pretty
smart kid.

865
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:26,653
That's a good plan...

866
00:49:26,735 --> 00:49:27,884
stealthy.

867
00:49:27,975 --> 00:49:30,045
But we don't need
any of that.

868
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:31,568
This is Thunderbolt!

869
00:49:31,655 --> 00:49:33,327
Villains always cringe
in fear

870
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:35,849
whenever Thunderbolt
is here!

871
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:37,414
So true.

872
00:49:37,495 --> 00:49:39,929
What we need
is a full-frontal assault!

873
00:49:40,015 --> 00:49:41,130
How hard can it be?

874
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:42,694
That's right.
How hard can it be?

875
00:49:42,775 --> 00:49:44,288
Follow me.

876
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:46,445
Oh, I'm right behind you,
pal.

877
00:49:46,535 --> 00:49:47,854
It sort of looks like you,

878
00:49:47,935 --> 00:49:49,653
except you don't have
that much hair.

879
00:49:53,415 --> 00:49:55,849
It's Patch! And he's
brought Thunderbolt!

880
00:49:55,935 --> 00:49:57,084
He'll save us!

881
00:49:57,175 --> 00:49:59,530
Here now.
Where did you come from?

882
00:49:59,615 --> 00:50:02,368
Get outta here,
you stupid mutt!

883
00:50:02,455 --> 00:50:04,127
Maybe
they didn't hear you.

884
00:50:04,215 --> 00:50:06,570
Don't worry, kid.
This will be Take Two.

885
00:50:07,935 --> 00:50:09,368
- Aah!
- Aah!

886
00:50:09,455 --> 00:50:12,094
Ahh!
That's more like it.

887
00:50:14,015 --> 00:50:16,085
Ah!

888
00:50:16,175 --> 00:50:17,369
What have we here?

889
00:50:17,455 --> 00:50:20,367
Oh, it's you.

890
00:50:20,455 --> 00:50:24,164
I owe you a debt of
gratitude, my photogenic
little friend.

891
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,893
If it wasn't for you,

892
00:50:25,975 --> 00:50:28,011
I'd have never found
your brothers and sisters.

893
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:31,729
And now I have you all.

894
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:41,610
Thunder...

895
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:44,209
are you playing dead?

896
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:47,133
That hurt.

897
00:50:47,215 --> 00:50:48,694
That really hurt.

898
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:50,254
I knew
you were faking it.

899
00:50:51,735 --> 00:50:54,533
He's been faking it,
all right.

900
00:50:54,615 --> 00:50:55,730
Lightning, little buddy.

901
00:50:55,815 --> 00:50:59,171
I am not
your little buddy!

902
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:01,325
And you are
no wonder dog!

903
00:51:01,415 --> 00:51:03,883
This kid trusted you,
and look where it's got him.

904
00:51:03,975 --> 00:51:05,169
What's he mean?

905
00:51:05,255 --> 00:51:07,007
He's been lying to you
all day, kid.

906
00:51:07,095 --> 00:51:09,814
He doesn't care about you
or your family.

907
00:51:09,895 --> 00:51:12,455
He was just trying to get
his name in the paper

908
00:51:12,535 --> 00:51:14,048
and save his job.

909
00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:15,887
- Ask him.
- Wha...

910
00:51:15,975 --> 00:51:17,090
No.

911
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:20,087
Well, yeah, but...
but...

912
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:21,403
But, but, but.

913
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,850
Hey, genius,
you're no hero!

914
00:51:23,935 --> 00:51:25,527
You're a fraud!

915
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,367
And by the way...

916
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:29,332
there never was a plan
to recast you.

917
00:51:29,415 --> 00:51:31,292
I just had to get you
out of the way.

918
00:51:35,055 --> 00:51:37,967
Now I got to go take
your place on the show...

919
00:51:38,055 --> 00:51:40,091
my show.

920
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:55,850
Thunder.

921
00:51:55,935 --> 00:51:59,132
Thunder...
I don't understand.

922
00:51:59,215 --> 00:52:00,773
You lied to me?

923
00:52:00,855 --> 00:52:03,608
I put on an act.
I'm an actor.

924
00:52:03,695 --> 00:52:05,447
That's what I do.

925
00:52:05,535 --> 00:52:07,685
But you said I could be
your junior deputy.

926
00:52:07,775 --> 00:52:09,094
I made all that up.

927
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:11,769
L-I just needed someone who...
who knew the script.

928
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:13,766
But you... you said
that you'd help us.

929
00:52:13,855 --> 00:52:15,413
Oh, don't you get it,
kid?

930
00:52:15,495 --> 00:52:17,690
All that "running around
and saving the day" stuff,

931
00:52:17,775 --> 00:52:19,766
it's... it's...

932
00:52:19,855 --> 00:52:23,370
it's make-believe.
It's not real.

933
00:52:23,455 --> 00:52:25,844
You promised!

934
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,489
Patch, I just...

935
00:52:30,575 --> 00:52:34,887
You lied.

936
00:52:34,975 --> 00:52:37,330
I'm sorry, all right?

937
00:52:39,135 --> 00:52:41,205
I'm not a real wonder dog.

938
00:52:41,295 --> 00:52:45,925
I just...
acted like one once.

939
00:53:01,815 --> 00:53:03,043
I'm hungry.

940
00:53:03,135 --> 00:53:06,366
I want to go home.
It's scary here.

941
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:08,685
Where's mother?

942
00:53:14,735 --> 00:53:16,885
Patch?

943
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:18,647
Are you okay?

944
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:20,453
Patch?

945
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:22,890
Dad was right.

946
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:26,888
I am just one of 101.

947
00:53:26,975 --> 00:53:29,443
I'm sorry, Lucky.
This is all my fault.

948
00:53:29,535 --> 00:53:31,844
Hey, didn't Thunderbolt

949
00:53:31,935 --> 00:53:34,051
get out of a cage
like this once,

950
00:53:34,135 --> 00:53:37,172
you know, in episode 13,
"The Flaming Flea Circus"?

951
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,644
Episode 18.

952
00:53:39,735 --> 00:53:42,124
Episode 18!

953
00:53:49,135 --> 00:53:51,410
Did you see
what Patch just did?

954
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:54,009
Wizard, Patch!
Absolutely wizard!

955
00:53:54,095 --> 00:53:55,050
Hey!

956
00:53:55,135 --> 00:53:56,204
Shut your yapping!

957
00:53:56,295 --> 00:53:58,525
I'm trying to get
me beauty sleep.

958
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:05,528
Okay, you guys.
Stick together and be quiet.

959
00:54:20,535 --> 00:54:24,528
Oh, don't look
so put-out.

960
00:54:24,615 --> 00:54:26,731
My favourite furrier will be
open in the morning,

961
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,807
and then we'll be
out of your hair.

962
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:31,374
Perfect.

963
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:34,970
Episode 53,
"The Mine Shaft Mix-up."

964
00:54:35,055 --> 00:54:40,004
Everybody, stay here
until I tell you it's safe
to come out.

965
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:48,804
Aw, what is it with...

966
00:54:48,895 --> 00:54:50,010
Aah!

967
00:54:53,655 --> 00:54:55,930
- You let the puppies
get away!
- You let the puppies
get away!

968
00:54:56,015 --> 00:54:58,688
Hold on!
They can't have gone far.

969
00:54:58,775 --> 00:55:00,254
Here... start searching.

970
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:18,569
Oh, when that crazy bird
finds out we lost them again,

971
00:55:18,655 --> 00:55:19,804
she'll skin us.

972
00:55:19,895 --> 00:55:21,294
Horace, Jasper!

973
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,854
What are you looking for?

974
00:55:22,935 --> 00:55:24,448
Nothing, Mum.

975
00:55:24,535 --> 00:55:26,890
We haven't lost the doggies
or anything.

976
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,010
You let them escape?!

977
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:29,164
Jasper fell asleep.

978
00:55:29,255 --> 00:55:30,893
You were snoring
like a train!

979
00:55:33,175 --> 00:55:35,450
The lift is barking.

980
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:39,614
The mutts must already
be downstairs.

981
00:55:39,695 --> 00:55:42,163
Funny how we never heard
the lift.

982
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,688
Shut up, you!

983
00:55:46,095 --> 00:55:48,290
Come on!
They'll be back soon!

984
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:49,728
Aren't we going down?

985
00:55:49,815 --> 00:55:52,727
Nope, we're going up.

986
00:55:57,255 --> 00:55:58,608
Ready, Rolie?

987
00:55:58,695 --> 00:55:59,684
Huh? No, no.

988
00:55:59,775 --> 00:56:01,731
No, no, no, no, no, no!

989
00:56:01,815 --> 00:56:02,850
Whoa!

990
00:56:02,935 --> 00:56:03,924
Whoa!

991
00:56:06,055 --> 00:56:07,807
Can I do that again?

992
00:56:07,895 --> 00:56:09,851
Okay,
now the rest of you.

993
00:56:11,295 --> 00:56:13,934
I'm just saying maybe the
puppies are still upstairs,

994
00:56:14,015 --> 00:56:16,370
and they just tricked us
into coming down here.

995
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:19,253
Come on now, Horace.
Dogs ain't that smart.

996
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:22,293
They haven't got the big
educated brains we got.

997
00:56:27,015 --> 00:56:29,131
97 away!

998
00:56:29,215 --> 00:56:31,046
98 away!

999
00:56:31,135 --> 00:56:33,854
99 away!

1000
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:35,414
Ohh!

1001
00:56:35,495 --> 00:56:38,055
- Whoa!
- Oh-ho!
- Aha!

1002
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:40,046
- Ugh!
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

1003
00:56:41,255 --> 00:56:43,007
Get him!

1004
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:56,055
Who-o-o-o-a!

1005
00:56:56,135 --> 00:56:57,853
D'oh!

1006
00:57:11,135 --> 00:57:12,363
Thanks, Gus.
Cheers.

1007
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:18,171
Come on.
We're gonna hitch a ride.

1008
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:35,811
Here they come!

1009
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:42,889
There they are!
Get them!

1010
00:57:44,095 --> 00:57:45,733
What's happened?

1011
00:57:45,815 --> 00:57:47,487
- She pushed me!
- Did not!

1012
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,445
Who-o-o-o-a!

1013
00:57:54,535 --> 00:57:55,490
- Wee!
- Yay!
- Wee!
- Yay!

1014
00:58:04,935 --> 00:58:06,209
Aah!

1015
00:58:06,295 --> 00:58:09,093
The crazy lady's
right behind us!

1016
00:58:10,615 --> 00:58:11,730
Aaah!

1017
00:58:23,175 --> 00:58:25,530
Oh-ho-ho!

1018
00:58:25,615 --> 00:58:27,367
Ow! Ohh! Ohh!

1019
00:58:31,015 --> 00:58:33,085
He had a birdie in his mouth.

1020
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:35,006
Oh, you idiots!

1021
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,289
Here... take the wheel.

1022
00:58:46,695 --> 00:58:50,608
Speed up, you imbeciles,
or we'll lose them!

1023
00:58:52,815 --> 00:58:53,531
Ugh!

1024
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:56,968
Aah!

1025
00:58:57,055 --> 00:58:58,966
Aaah!

1026
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:01,014
Ha ha! That's one!

1027
00:59:01,095 --> 00:59:03,370
Just 98 more to go!

1028
00:59:03,455 --> 00:59:06,094
Okay, okay!
Quiet on the set!

1029
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:07,608
We're rolling!

1030
00:59:07,695 --> 00:59:09,287
And action!
Wholesome, Tommy!

1031
00:59:10,815 --> 00:59:12,646
Aw, Lightning,
you're one-of-a...

1032
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:15,851
Aaah!

1033
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:17,368
Aaaaah!

1034
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:18,892
Huh?

1035
00:59:18,975 --> 00:59:20,169
Hmm?

1036
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:23,286
Whoa! Ugh!

1037
00:59:24,415 --> 00:59:26,087
Patch, help me!

1038
00:59:27,535 --> 00:59:28,729
Ugh!

1039
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:29,850
Aah!

1040
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:31,931
Well, well.

1041
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:35,690
If it isn't the little
half-pint hero again.

1042
00:59:42,815 --> 00:59:43,531
Huh?

1043
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:46,811
Ugh!

1044
00:59:47,855 --> 00:59:50,210
Aaah!

1045
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,013
Ugh!

1046
00:59:52,095 --> 00:59:54,814
Wow!
Check out Patch!

1047
00:59:56,975 --> 00:59:58,328
Hmm?

1048
01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:08,527
Aaah!

1049
01:00:08,615 --> 01:00:11,812
Aaaaaaaaah!

1050
01:00:29,815 --> 01:00:31,567
What do we do now, Patch?

1051
01:00:33,735 --> 01:00:35,293
See those windows?

1052
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:37,172
We can reach them
from the upper deck!

1053
01:00:38,295 --> 01:00:41,332
You go ahead.
I'll hold them off...

1054
01:00:41,415 --> 01:00:42,928
s-somehow.

1055
01:00:47,255 --> 01:00:49,564
Here's a feisty one.

1056
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:59,850
Thunderbolt!

1057
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:05,567
How are you doin', kid?

1058
01:01:05,655 --> 01:01:07,168
But... but I thought...

1059
01:01:07,255 --> 01:01:09,530
Come on!
Haven't you seen the show?

1060
01:01:09,615 --> 01:01:12,209
I always arrive
just in the nick of time.

1061
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:15,093
Look, I may not be
a real hero,

1062
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:18,087
but I can act like one.

1063
01:01:23,975 --> 01:01:25,727
Lightning,
don't let 'em hurt me!

1064
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:28,409
Ooh, heart...

1065
01:01:28,495 --> 01:01:29,291
Ugh!

1066
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:30,967
My heart!

1067
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,649
Lightning,
this might be the end!

1068
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:43,888
Give me that!

1069
01:01:43,975 --> 01:01:46,125
I'll put this mongrel
out of its misery!

1070
01:01:48,895 --> 01:01:50,374
Ugh!

1071
01:01:50,455 --> 01:01:51,331
Ugh!

1072
01:01:55,575 --> 01:01:57,406
Whoa!

1073
01:02:02,175 --> 01:02:05,531
Lightning, I can feel
the warm kiss of life

1074
01:02:05,615 --> 01:02:07,367
'ere it parts my cheek.

1075
01:02:07,455 --> 01:02:08,729
Oh!

1076
01:02:08,815 --> 01:02:12,490
Do not mourn me
when I am gone!

1077
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:16,250
It is enough that you were
here at the end.

1078
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:22,490
Goodbye...
old... friend.

1079
01:02:28,775 --> 01:02:31,130
Good night, sweet prince.

1080
01:02:52,095 --> 01:02:52,971
Aaah!

1081
01:02:53,055 --> 01:02:53,931
Aah!

1082
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:56,091
Aaah!

1083
01:02:56,175 --> 01:02:57,654
Whoa!

1084
01:02:57,735 --> 01:02:58,929
Aaah!

1085
01:02:59,015 --> 01:03:00,164
Aaah!

1086
01:03:00,255 --> 01:03:01,608
- Aaah!
- Aaaah!
- Aaah!

1087
01:03:02,575 --> 01:03:04,884
I got to get
through here!

1088
01:03:05,935 --> 01:03:07,766
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

1089
01:03:09,695 --> 01:03:12,653
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

1090
01:03:38,975 --> 01:03:41,853
Dispatch to Car 47.
What is your situation? Over.

1091
01:03:41,935 --> 01:03:43,653
No, no!

1092
01:03:43,735 --> 01:03:45,214
Fellas, I'm not with them!

1093
01:03:45,295 --> 01:03:47,286
I was... I was trying to help
Thunderbolt!

1094
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:48,774
Honest!
That's what I do!

1095
01:03:48,855 --> 01:03:50,447
I'm a sidekick!
We're a team!

1096
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:53,891
Come on, fellas! Come on!
Don't you watch TV?!

1097
01:03:53,975 --> 01:03:56,773
Hmm. Now who's
the pathetic ham actor?

1098
01:03:56,855 --> 01:03:59,244
I am painting spots, but she
doesn't like them so good.

1099
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,326
And then she says,
"No, you must kill them!"

1100
01:04:01,415 --> 01:04:02,928
And I'm not so sturdy.

1101
01:04:03,015 --> 01:04:06,291
She's very mean to me,
and then I pass out.

1102
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,047
There they are!

1103
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,363
Those are the ones!

1104
01:04:09,455 --> 01:04:10,968
- She made us do it!
- She made us do it!

1105
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:13,967
Spots?
I do see spots, you know.

1106
01:04:14,055 --> 01:04:15,966
They're everywhere.

1107
01:04:17,535 --> 01:04:20,003
Spots, spots,
spots, spots!

1108
01:04:20,095 --> 01:04:22,609
Spots!

1109
01:04:22,695 --> 01:04:25,004
There they are!

1110
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:26,687
Oh, this is wonderful!

1111
01:04:26,775 --> 01:04:28,333
They're all here!

1112
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,928
Oh, come now!

1113
01:04:30,015 --> 01:04:31,334
Oh, stop it!
Stop it!

1114
01:04:31,415 --> 01:04:33,087
We were so worried about you.

1115
01:04:33,175 --> 01:04:36,087
Penny, Lucky!
Oh, my darling puppies!

1116
01:04:37,535 --> 01:04:38,809
Oh, Patch, you're safe!

1117
01:04:41,775 --> 01:04:43,970
We were so worried
about you.

1118
01:04:44,055 --> 01:04:46,330
We missed you very much,
Patch.

1119
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:47,291
You did?

1120
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:48,808
Of course, son.

1121
01:04:50,615 --> 01:04:52,924
Mum, Dad,
this is Thunderbolt.

1122
01:04:53,015 --> 01:04:54,767
He saved us.

1123
01:04:54,855 --> 01:04:57,323
I don't know how to thank you
for saving my family.

1124
01:04:57,415 --> 01:04:59,326
No, no, don't thank me.

1125
01:04:59,415 --> 01:05:01,406
It was your son, Patch,
who...

1126
01:05:01,495 --> 01:05:03,406
Mum, Dad,
the devil woman got us!

1127
01:05:03,495 --> 01:05:04,848
And we were trapped,
and then Patch got us out!

1128
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:07,085
Yeah, and Patch made me
a trampoline!

1129
01:05:07,175 --> 01:05:08,847
You should have seen
Patch, mother.

1130
01:05:08,935 --> 01:05:10,607
He was fantastic!

1131
01:05:10,695 --> 01:05:13,163
Just like Thunderbolt.

1132
01:05:14,935 --> 01:05:17,005
You know,
they're right, kid.

1133
01:05:17,095 --> 01:05:19,370
Me, I'm just an actor.

1134
01:05:19,455 --> 01:05:21,093
But you...

1135
01:05:21,175 --> 01:05:24,053
you are a real,
one-of-a-kind wonder dog.

1136
01:05:25,575 --> 01:05:27,486
Hey, lads,
they're over here!

1137
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:29,725
Whoo!

1138
01:05:29,815 --> 01:05:31,487
Say "spots"!

1139
01:06:08,015 --> 01:06:09,607
Say, kiddies,

1140
01:06:09,695 --> 01:06:13,165
is your dog
a one-of-a-kind wonder dog?

1141
01:06:13,255 --> 01:06:16,804
A one-of-a-kind

1142
01:06:16,895 --> 01:06:20,774
A one-of-a-kind now, baby

1143
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:22,254
I'm the one

1144
01:06:23,935 --> 01:06:27,974
A doggone son of a gun
now, baby

1145
01:06:28,055 --> 01:06:29,044
A one-of-a-kind

1146
01:06:29,135 --> 01:06:31,854
He's one-of-a-kind

1147
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:35,371
A one-of-a-kind now, baby

1148
01:06:35,455 --> 01:06:36,524
I'm the one

1149
01:06:36,615 --> 01:06:38,526
He's the one

1150
01:06:38,615 --> 01:06:42,608
A doggone son of a gun
now, baby

1151
01:06:42,695 --> 01:06:44,208
A one-of-a-kind

1152
01:06:44,295 --> 01:06:46,126
Oh, yeah

1153
01:06:51,055 --> 01:06:54,604
Wow! One-of-a-kind!

1154
01:06:57,895 --> 01:06:59,726
Kanine Krunchies
can't be beat

1155
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,726
They make each meal
a special treat

1156
01:07:01,815 --> 01:07:03,453
Happy thoughts
for those who eat

1157
01:07:03,535 --> 01:07:06,174
Delicious Kanine Krunchies

1158
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:09,372
You know,
they're right, kid.

1159
01:07:09,455 --> 01:07:11,650
Me, I'm just an actor.

1160
01:07:11,735 --> 01:07:13,293
But you...

1161
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:19,245
you are a real,
one-of-a-kind wonder dog.

1162
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:20,654
A one-of-a-kind

1163
01:07:20,735 --> 01:07:23,249
He's one-of-a-kind

1164
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:26,930
A one-of-a-kind now, baby

1165
01:07:27,015 --> 01:07:28,130
I'm the one

1166
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:30,126
He's the one

1167
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:32,171
A doggone son of a gun
now, baby

1168
01:07:32,255 --> 01:07:34,246
A doggone son of a gun

1169
01:07:34,335 --> 01:07:36,724
A one-of-a-kind

1170
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:44,172
Oh, yeah

1171
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,052
Oh, yeah

1172
01:07:46,135 --> 01:07:48,649
Oh, yeah

1173
01:07:56,055 --> 01:07:57,488
I'm the one

1174
01:07:57,575 --> 01:07:59,930
He's one-of-a-kind

1175
01:08:00,015 --> 01:08:03,724
A one-of-a-kind now, baby

1176
01:08:03,815 --> 01:08:04,930
I'm the one

1177
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:06,926
He's the one

1178
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:10,405
A doggone son of a gun
now, baby

1179
01:08:10,495 --> 01:08:13,567
Wow! One-of-a-kind!

1180
01:08:13,655 --> 01:08:17,443
That's right!
All right!

1181
01:09:42,615 --> 01:09:45,527
Caboodle lay-dee-ooh-ooh

1182
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:47,571
Eeeb-a-dee-bop
sa-dum-wa-dum

1183
01:09:47,655 --> 01:09:50,567
Caboodle lay-dee-ooh

1184
01:09:50,655 --> 01:09:52,691
Don't you ever stop, no

1185
01:09:52,775 --> 01:09:55,653
Caboodle lay-dee-ee-ooh

1186
01:09:55,735 --> 01:09:59,887
Mimmy-zop ba-dum, ta-dum,
yeah

1187
01:10:20,895 --> 01:10:24,046
So if you try that climb
one more time

1188
01:10:24,135 --> 01:10:26,330
You might hit the top

1189
01:10:26,415 --> 01:10:28,724
Now, if you find
you're batting zero

1190
01:10:28,815 --> 01:10:31,375
And a legend you are not

1191
01:10:31,455 --> 01:10:33,844
You can still wind up
a hero

1192
01:10:33,935 --> 01:10:36,449
If you give it
one more shot

1193
01:10:36,535 --> 01:10:39,288
If you don't give in,
you're gonna win

1194
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:41,650
The only question's "When?"

1195
01:10:41,735 --> 01:10:45,330
So if at first
you don't succeed

1196
01:10:45,415 --> 01:10:46,530
Try again

1197
01:10:46,615 --> 01:10:49,129
Try, try, try again

1198
01:10:49,215 --> 01:10:50,648
Try, try again

1199
01:10:50,735 --> 01:10:51,645
And again, yeah

1200
01:10:51,735 --> 01:10:53,009
Try, try, try again

1201
01:10:53,095 --> 01:10:54,210
Try again

1202
01:10:54,295 --> 01:10:56,445
Try, try again

1203
01:10:56,535 --> 01:10:59,174
- Again and again
and again, yeah!
- Try, try, try again

1204
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,723
- Again and again
and again, yeah!
- Try, try, try again

1205
01:11:01,815 --> 01:11:03,373
- Whoo!
- Try, try, try again

1206
01:11:03,455 --> 01:11:07,573
Try again, yeah!

1207
01:11:19,535 --> 01:11:21,048
Ya-ohhh!

1208
01:11:22,895 --> 01:11:24,294
Ahhh-ah-ah-ah!

1209
01:11:27,335 --> 01:11:28,609
Oh, now, come on!

1210
01:11:28,695 --> 01:11:29,969
Down, boy!

1211
01:11:30,055 --> 01:11:33,286
Down, all of y'all!
This ain't fair!
