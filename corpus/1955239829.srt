1
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:23,323
Honey, I'm so excited for this.
I've been waiting all day.

2
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,099
Thank you for
getting us here safely.

3
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:34,483
God bless.

4
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:35,835
Honey, stay close.

5
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:39,105
No more street meat. We have
dinner in two hours at Benihana.

6
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:41,106
I do not want you
spoiling your appetite.

7
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,109
- I want a hot dog.
- Gucci. Rolex.

8
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:47,112
Excellent. Sir, you wouldn't happen
to have any Louis Vuitton, would you?

9
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:48,498
Where are you guys from?

10
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:49,849
Waco, Texas.

11
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:53,852
I love Texas. Dallas Cowboys, right?
America's favorite team.

12
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:59,692
Yeah. The cowboys are at the
ranch looking for Louis.

13
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:03,129
All right. I'll see you
in a minute. Bye.

14
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:05,498
Right this way. Come on.

15
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:06,566
Hey.

16
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,435
Hey, hey.

17
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:14,140
And for you, special VIP
entrance, yeah?

18
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:15,674
Come on.

19
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:17,743
Yeah. See? Right here.

20
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,427
Rhonda. Ronnie.

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,566
Hello. Looking for the Louis
Vuitton handbag, right?

22
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:44,236
Like this? Go.

23
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:49,375
Yes. We would love to buy
a bunch of these

24
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,409
as giveaways for our
various church fund-raisers.

25
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:53,712
Okay.
How much is bunch?

26
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:57,917
Well, let's see. There's the bingo
tournament and then the bowling league.

27
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,984
-Talent show.
-Talent show.

28
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,888
-The father/daughter picnic.
-Mother/daughter brunch.

29
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,121
The Veteran Days committee.

30
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:07,227
-The Animal Right Group fund-raiser.
-So, anyway, 20 bags?

31
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,462
Twenty bags?
Very expensive.

32
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,465
But for you,
I'll do a good deal.

33
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:15,200
200 per bag. Done. Go.

34
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:19,739
So how late are y'all open?

35
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:23,341
My friend Marlene says you got to
look around to get the best deal.

36
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,579
Lady, lady, best deal.
First-class bag. Original.

37
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:29,948
But you go to church.
I... I love Jesus.

38
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:31,617
175 per bag.

39
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,656
Praise Lord Jesus,
it is a deal!

40
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:38,757
Sold!

41
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,359
-Can we see the bags?
-The bag, yeah. Go.

42
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:45,897
You see, computers, you know, they can
get hacked. Locks. They get picked.

43
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:48,635
But nothing gets past
Black Mamba.

44
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:52,905
He is a nasty bitch.
Like Kobe Bryant.

45
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:55,574
I don't really
follow politics.

46
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:02,649
Okay.
Let's go to the warehouse.

47
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:07,118
What about rims?
You guys need rims?

48
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:12,524
Can I ask you a question? Really, I don't
mean to offend you by this, but listen to me.

49
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:16,562
-This bag, it's real, right?
-Does it look real to you?

50
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:18,681
Yeah.

51
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:19,865
Then there's your answer.

52
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:23,468
Okay, but, can-can... Excuse me?
Can you hold this a second?

53
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,504
See, I gotta ask you
this though.

54
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,706
Why is it that
the cross-stitching on here

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,811
is not consistent with
the LVMH designer code?

56
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:35,881
No, no, no. You're not trying
to sell us a fake, right?

57
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:38,917
- Because you know that's a felony, Hassan.
- Right.

58
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,287
And you know
what that means?

59
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,687
Police.

60
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:45,524
Shit.

61
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:48,493
Bag man is on the move.
Bag man is on the move!

62
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,641
All units, suspect heading north
on Crosby and he's going fast.

63
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:06,846
Annoyingly fast.

64
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,353
God! God!

65
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,523
I'm gonna sue you!
I need a lawyer!

66
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,790
<b>PUERTO RICANS IN PARIS</b>

67
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:57,395
The proceeds go to funding
illegal manufacturing of drugs,

68
00:04:57,428 --> 00:05:00,765
human trafficking
and terrorism.

69
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:04,502
It's no exaggeration when I
say that our work here today

70
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:08,408
is gonna make our
country safer... tomorrow.

71
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,043
So you're saying
you're a hero.

72
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,782
You said that,
not me.

73
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,109
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

74
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:27,459
So, Detective, you've gotta
watch those tackles.

75
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:29,829
Your ass is too old
to be Superfly Snuka.

76
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,131
You spent less time
blabbing to the cameras,

77
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:34,899
more time on the treadmill, I
wouldn't have to tackle anyone.

78
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:36,868
Then you'd literally
be good for nothing.

79
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,971
- Besides, I would've caught the guy eventually.
- When, next week?

80
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:43,875
I'm the brains of the operation. I
don't run. You're the muscle, you run.

81
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:47,646
When do I get to be the brains? -I'll
text you when there's an opening.

82
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:50,115
Great work. What do you
say we go to Finnerty's?

83
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:54,954
Do a couple shots of Ciroc. Maybe I'll let
you both reggae grind me. What? What?

84
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,622
Yeah?

85
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:57,839
I got some plans tonight.

86
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,024
Okay.

87
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:02,895
I'm taking the dental hygienist
to the Bruno Mars concert. MSG.

88
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,129
Yeah, I got front row.

89
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:08,000
I got front row of the upper deck.
But I got good binoculars.

90
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:11,504
We ever gonna meet this one? -No!
Because then it becomes a relationship.

91
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:12,971
Here we go again.

92
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:16,841
<i>I ain't gonna be like those people
watching X Factor in bed like you.</i>

93
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,545
Instead...

94
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:21,196
I do this.

95
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:22,814
No one wants to
see that, man.

96
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:44,803
No, I did not put cheese
on the broccoli. Sorry, guys.

97
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:46,938
We shouldn't be
doing dairy anyway.

98
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:50,008
<i>- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, papi.</i>

99
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,876
Hi, babe.
How ya doin'?

100
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,846
Have you seen
my Gucci backpack?

101
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,281
Your shorts
are too short.

102
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:59,151
Why do you gotta make an issue of my
outfits? It makes me uncomfortable.

103
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:00,886
Your shorts
make me uncomfortable.

104
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:02,453
They're called shorts,
not longs.

105
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,988
Where you goin'?

106
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:07,593
<i>Mami said if you said it was
okay I could go to Wandi's house</i>

107
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,562
- to study and watch a movie... Is it okay?
- No.

108
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,165
Not unless
I get a kiss first.

109
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:14,632
Study.

110
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:17,769
<i>You're the best, papi.
Happy anniversary.</i>

111
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:20,906
<i>Happy anniversary,
Mami and papi!</i>

112
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,108
<i>Happy anniversary, mami...</i>

113
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:26,679
I'm sure your father doesn't
need a reminder, Anthony.

114
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,647
I only mentioned it,
like, five times last week.

115
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,687
Of course not. Because we're going
to MSG tonight to see Bruno Mars.

116
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,122
What?

117
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,091
Surprise?

118
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,026
You seriously got tickets?

119
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,728
Front row-ish.

120
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:46,999
- My God!
- Happy?

121
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:50,536
Yes! My goodness.
I can't believe this.

122
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,073
<i>See, mami? Papi isn't a lazy,
worthless piece of garbage.</i>

123
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:55,608
Anthony, my God!

124
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,109
He's so silly.

125
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,860
You are so gonna
get it tonight.

126
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:00,579
Can't wait.

127
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:03,682
Wait, you just let Lexi go.
What about the boys?

128
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:05,200
Who's gonna watch them?

129
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,685
Your brother.

130
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:07,903
Perfect.

131
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,088
<i>Hell no!</i>

132
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,955
<i>Come on, man!</i>

133
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:13,825
I would if I could, but, you
know, Vanessa, she'd be crushed.

134
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:17,195
She's got a name now? It's our anniversary!
Your sister's gonna be crushed!

135
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:18,963
<i>That's not my fault.</i>

136
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,766
You gotta start treating her better.
She's gonna leave your ass.

137
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,802
I'll do your reports
for a week!

138
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:26,771
Listen, Vanessa, she is
obsessed with Bruno Mars.

139
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,807
You and Gloria
don't even know his music.

140
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,974
I am begging you!

141
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:31,109
<i>Okay, I'll tell you what.</i>

142
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:34,712
Name two Bruno Mars's songs and
you get the tickets. Go ahead.

143
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:36,881
<i>- Don't do this to me right now.
- Okay, okay.</i>

144
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:39,551
<i>I'll give you a clue. Ready?</i>

145
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:55,266
I knew it.

146
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,467
You forgot.

147
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,139
Just like my birthday. Just like last year!
And everything!

148
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,675
I swear to God!
I can't take this anymore!

149
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:05,743
You know what? You think
I couldn't hear you?

150
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:08,147
I hear when you piss.
I hear when you shit.

151
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:12,150
I can hear everything in this goddamn
house! I swear to God, Eddie!

152
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,953
Who was that?

153
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:17,956
My brother-in-law wanted us
to watch the kids tonight.

154
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,259
- Told him he's out of his mind.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,663
He wonder why I never want
to get married, you know?

156
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:28,866
What do you mean,
you never wanna get married?

157
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:34,673
Maybe never is a stretch, but anything
can happen between now and never, babe.

158
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,076
Knock it off, Luis.
I'm 33 1/2.

159
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,311
My biological clock won't
deal with your bullshit.

160
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:41,113
You said you were 29.

161
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,982
I lied!

162
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:46,384
So, what, I'm too old
for you now?

163
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:48,921
No, no, no.
Like my boy Bruno says,

164
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:50,955
"I like you
just the way you are."

165
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,658
My pretty
little sweet talker.

166
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:55,260
You really don't ever
wanna get married?

167
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,730
Can we talk about this
after the show?

168
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,867
No, we can't,
'cause I'm not going.

169
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,070
Come on, Vanessa, wait. What are you
talking about you're not going?

170
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:08,807
You said from the jump
this was gonna be casual.

171
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,377
That's was eight months ago.
Things change, Luis.

172
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,847
And I'm not gonna sit around here waiting for
some old-ass grandpa with commitment issues.

173
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,985
<i>Wait. I don't have issues, okay?
I have an issue.</i>

174
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:27,325
You really gotta start buttoning
your shirt all the way up.

175
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,360
You ain't Tom Ford.

176
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:42,941
I didn't actually
forget what day it was.

177
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:49,014
It's just between the kids and the
bills there's not much left ever.

178
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,950
So when I realized it
was our anniversary today,

179
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:54,886
I was just hoping it would
sort of go away... I'm sorry.

180
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,124
It's okay.

181
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,027
Maybe next year
we'll do something.

182
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:11,169
<i>Stay tuned, because X
Factor will be right back.</i>

183
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,915
So you just went
by yourself?

184
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:25,884
I wasn't gonna
waste those tickets.

185
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:28,153
Gloria still hasn't responded
to any of my texts, man.

186
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,089
My sister,
she can hold a grudge.

187
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,924
<i>She's still mad at me for wearing
sneakers to her quinceañera.</i>

188
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:35,827
Yo. Sarge wants to see you
two in her office, ASAP.

189
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,865
She probably wants to fire you for
wearing that dumbass T-shirt to work.

190
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,334
So, you guys are French.

191
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:48,173
Technically, I did meet my first husband
at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.

192
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,144
Also where I met
my second husband. Yeah.

193
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,312
Gentlemen.

194
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,914
Meet Colette and Vincent.

195
00:11:56,947 --> 00:12:01,519
They have come
all the way from Paris

196
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:03,855
<i>just to talk to you
two boricuas.</i>

197
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,923
I won't take up
any more of their time.

198
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:10,528
Sure I can't get you anything? Coffee,
tea, hot croissant from Au Bon Pain?

199
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:11,964
No, we're fine. Thank you.

200
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,365
Suit yourself.

201
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:14,817
"Au revoir."

202
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,235
<i>Au revoir.</i>

203
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:19,471
Mr. Garcia,
Mr. Lopez,

204
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:23,808
my name is Vincent Gravois and this
is my associate, Colette Desrosiers.

205
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:26,912
I'm the CEO of LuxeLife Holding.
You may be familiar with us?

206
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:30,382
Of course. You own all those bag
companies they bootleg on Canal Street.

207
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:34,252
We have saved you
so much money over the years.

208
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:37,522
And we are very grateful.
That's why we are here.

209
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:42,828
Well, I'm a 48/36 if you want to hook
me up with a suit as a thank you.

210
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,562
Thirty-six?
When, 10 years ago?

211
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,399
Bro, I'm off the gluten.
I'm spinning three times a week.

212
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,369
Have you even seen me with my
shirt off lately? Have you?

213
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,953
You ate pancakes
this morning.

214
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,504
Bro, gluten-free pancakes.

215
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:57,408
Colette here happens to make the most
beautiful handbags in the world.

216
00:12:57,442 --> 00:13:01,180
For years, girls have lined up
outside her atelier to buy them.

217
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:04,882
I could never find a bag I liked,
so I decided to make them myself.

218
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,386
And then my friends
started asking for them,

219
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:10,288
and friends of my friends,
and the next thing you know.

220
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,557
That is so sweet.

221
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,527
LuxeLife came aboard to help
people outside Paris get Colette.

222
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,996
For her next bag, we've
coordinated a global roll out

223
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,600
around the most exclusive
retail outlets.

224
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,268
Barneys. Saks.

225
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,903
No pressure or anything.

226
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,907
But last week,
we received this.

227
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:36,114
Okay. That's a picture
of a bag and...

228
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:41,086
That's a lot of words in
French I do not know.

229
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:44,022
<i>Not just a bag.
That's the bag.</i>

230
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:45,857
The center
of our campaign.

231
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,894
At this time, there are only two in
the world. And one has been stolen.

232
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:51,929
This is a ransom note.

233
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:55,634
It says unless LuxeLife Holdings
pays one million euros by Friday,

234
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,504
they are going to flood the market with
bootlegs before the real one hit retail.

235
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,105
And we'd lose millions.

236
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:04,909
So what do you want with us?

237
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:08,880
We want you to go to Paris
to consult on our investigation.

238
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:12,417
French cops are too slow. I
lived in New York for 10 years.

239
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,852
We need the best.

240
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:17,456
We've already checked with your sergeant
and you have the vacation days.

241
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,091
As great as that sounds,

242
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:24,096
I don't think my wife will be into me spending
my vacation days in Paris without her.

243
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,966
Yeah, plus the French
are kinda pricks, you know.

244
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,103
But y'all seem really cool.

245
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,109
We are prepared to reward you
each with 150,000 US dollar

246
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,111
if you recover
the stolen bag.

247
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:21,419
Hey. Thank you.

248
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:28,126
Can you believe this place?

249
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:30,261
Yo, yo.
How are you?

250
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:34,533
Hey, mama, can I get a...
A... a... Yeah, there we go.

251
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,436
Got a light?
Yeah.

252
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:44,009
You girls go to a club,
a little spot around here?

253
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,476
<i>- No?
- Non, non.</i>

254
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:52,017
Since when do you smoke?

255
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:56,187
It's Paris, baby. The cigarettes
are healthier. Google that shit.

256
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,423
Yo, bro, they took our luggage.
Let's go.

257
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:05,163
Man,
look at this place.

258
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:07,132
I feel like I hit lotto
with this.

259
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:09,200
Shit.
I'm up a horse!

260
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:15,072
Yo, my man, can you hook me
up with some conditioner,

261
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,640
coconut version?

262
00:16:16,673 --> 00:16:21,178
Some body wash with aloe
and toothpaste for whitening?

263
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:23,081
And, bro,
I love those slippers.

264
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:27,252
Can you get me one for every day of
the week? I got bad feet, all right?

265
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:30,788
And, listen, I'm sorry.

266
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:34,525
I gotta change my money into euros.
So I'll hook you up later. Cool?

267
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,031
My man!

268
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:41,599
Love that attitude!
What a great guy, man.

269
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,569
Check this out.

270
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:49,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

271
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,778
Is that gonna
keep you up, Eddie?

272
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:56,548
<i>You know, Gloria's wanted to come to Paris
ever since we saw Ratatouille, man.</i>

273
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:59,551
She barely even said a word
to me before I left, bro.

274
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:04,355
We find that bag,
that's a 150 G's.

275
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:07,825
- For that kinda money, she'll forgive even you, right?
- Right.

276
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:11,228
Come on, man. Get your head into the game.
Let's find the bag.

277
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:15,099
Otherwise, Gloria's gonna leave you for
Anthony's orthodontist. You don't want that.

278
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,601
No. Hell, no.

279
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,604
I'm gonna go freshen up
before our meeting.

280
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,273
Why, bro?
It's just Colette.

281
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,324
Damn. Homegirl
cleaned up nice.

282
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:42,793
Hey, guys. How was your flight?
You guys get in okay?

283
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:45,730
It was great. Hotel's great.
Everything's great.

284
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:50,468
Yeah, you look
great too.

285
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:52,136
Thank you.

286
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,273
Did you do something with your hair?
You look very chic.

287
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:59,411
Actually, I haven't washed it since I
saw you in New York, but I'll take it.

288
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:03,214
God, I love this hotel. You guys
are lucky my bosses are rich.

289
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,351
My wife couldn't believe it when I
told her where we were staying.

290
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:07,853
You should have brought her.

291
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,855
It's a bit of
a sore subject.

292
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,589
What about you, Colette?

293
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,424
You married?
You got a boyfriend?

294
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,360
You looking for
something casual maybe?

295
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:17,696
A bit of
a sore subject too.

296
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,432
I just broke up
with a girl last week.

297
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:23,367
I'm sorry, but you look
so familiar to me.

298
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,237
Do I know you
from somewhere else?

299
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:26,704
I don't think so.

300
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,307
He looks like the guy
from the Quiznos commercials.

301
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:30,824
He gets that a lot.

302
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:32,309
No, it's not that.

303
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,712
Where do you spend
your holidays in the summer?

304
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:38,583
Sometimes go swimming at Brighton
Beach, but I doubt you saw me there.

305
00:18:38,615 --> 00:18:40,618
-Is that in the Hamptons?
-Nah.

306
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,455
No? -Okay, can we talk
about the missing bag?

307
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:45,856
Yes. The bag. Yeah.

308
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,259
It went missing last week.

309
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,461
Four people have access
to my studio.

310
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:53,631
Since there's no break-in,
Vincent thinks it's one of them.

311
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:57,301
So there's Ludivine,
my senior designer.

312
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:01,206
<i>I gave her her first job
right out of design school.</i>

313
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,841
<i>She's very talented.</i>

314
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:07,746
<i>But sometimes I get the feeling
she resents my success.</i>

315
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:11,348
<i>Then there's Francesca,
my publicist.</i>

316
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:16,555
<i>She's the best in the business.</i>

317
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:20,591
<i>Which means, I trust her about
as far as I can throw her.</i>

318
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:22,793
<i>Garçon?</i>

319
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:25,363
<i>Then there's
my dear friend, Kate.</i>

320
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,365
<i>We met modeling as teenagers.</i>

321
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:32,203
<i>She was very successful until she
had a little meltdown last summer.</i>

322
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,842
<i>She hasn't landed
a major campaign since.</i>

323
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,813
<i>Yet, somehow, she purchased a
vineyard in the south of France</i>

324
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:43,949
<i>that she can't possibly afford.</i>

325
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,387
<i>And finally,
there's my ex-husband, Jerome.</i>

326
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,789
<i>He used to be our
in-house photographer.</i>

327
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:56,228
<i>Since he stopped shooting for us,
he's been a little hard up for money.</i>

328
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,664
<i>When I sold my business to Vincent,
he started getting a little insecure.</i>

329
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:03,802
<i>And then I found out
his 19-year-old assistant</i>

330
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,938
<i>was giving him more
than a hand in the darkroom.</i>

331
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:10,709
So, that's everyone. And I can't believe
any of them would do this to me.

332
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:13,944
Don't you worry, Colette. We'll
find the bag. It's what we do.

333
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:15,580
I'm counting on it.

334
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:19,817
Sorry, guys, I have to get to a meeting.
Fifth of the day.

335
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:24,289
I used to make bags. Now I sit in conference
rooms and talk about brand synergies.

336
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:29,260
Well, look, here's my card.

337
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,730
Anything happens, you see
something, you call me immediately.

338
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:36,834
Even if you just wanna talk
about things, have dinner.

339
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:40,304
Dinner. Great idea.
How's tomorrow night?

340
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,440
I'd love to, Colette.

341
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:45,542
Great. I'm having some people
over. You both come.

342
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:49,581
God, I know I sound crazy,
but I swear we've met.

343
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:51,750
Bye.

344
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:57,555
Shit, man, you stink.

345
00:20:57,587 --> 00:21:00,625
You really should have
showered upstairs, bro.

346
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,768
Yo, yo, yo, yo!
What's going on, baby?

347
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,704
Why're you texting me?
I'm right here!

348
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:16,607
We in Paris, Eddie. We in Paris!
I'll tell you what!

349
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:19,477
We are. We have a big day tomorrow.
Can we go home?

350
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:22,747
Bro, I gotta get one French chick's
number at least. Come on, man.

351
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:25,549
I'm out. Try not to
wake me when you get home.

352
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,452
<i>That's if I get home.
Later, man.</i>

353
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,989
Hello. Would you
like a drink?

354
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:35,793
Got a better idea. Why don't
we go back to my hotel?

355
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:39,497
I'm staying at the Palais Royal.
Really expensive there.

356
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:41,499
You down?

357
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:43,934
You...
You don't speak English?

358
00:21:45,068 --> 00:21:46,770
That's really too bad.

359
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:49,507
I would have ate that little
croissant of yours for hours.

360
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:50,591
Sh...

361
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:51,643
Pig!

362
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:54,846
I thought you said
you didn't speak English?

363
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:58,482
What you doin' later?

364
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:08,960
I think we should get croissants
from this pâtisserie in the Sixth.

365
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:13,865
Frommer calls them "little knots of
buttery heaven." What do you think?

366
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,833
Lou!

367
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:20,038
<i>Lou, you sure you don't wanna come?
Frommer's says they're...</i>

368
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,108
<i>I don't give a fuck what Frommer's says!
I'm sleeping!</i>

369
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,711
I'm sleeping!

370
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:25,603
Eddie! Hey!

371
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:26,853
My God, Colette.

372
00:23:26,854 --> 00:23:28,071
What are you doing here?

373
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:29,908
- How are you doin'?
- I'm great.

374
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,343
My son, Charlie.

375
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:32,744
What's up, Charlie?

376
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:35,513
I was about to go get some
croissants on the corner.

377
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:36,748
Here? No.
Tourist trap.

378
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,949
Yeah.

379
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,884
You have to go there.
Rue Bonaparte.

380
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:43,620
Get a box of pistachio macaroons
from the shop and thank me later.

381
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:46,891
All right, sounds good. -But don't tell
anybody else. It's for locals only.

382
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:49,094
All right, I promise.

383
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:54,865
He wants to ride your bike. -You
wanna ride my bike? Come on.

384
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:56,734
Thank you. Okay.

385
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,006
Be careful. I thought
New York drivers were bad.

386
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:04,875
This over here is wild.

387
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,079
I have a son his age back home.
He'd love it here.

388
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:09,681
He your only one?

389
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:12,517
- Three boys under 10 and a 16-year-old girl.
- My God.

390
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:15,519
You poor thing. -Never a dull
moment around my apartment.

391
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:19,257
I worry about Charlie,
you know.

392
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:21,125
Divorce is hard on kids.

393
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:23,560
My parents split when I was 16,

394
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,897
and I ended up sleeping
with half my school.

395
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,834
That's why I keep telling Gloria
we need to start homeschooling.

396
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:34,205
He wants you
to walk us to school.

397
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:35,673
I got a few minutes.

398
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,107
Really? Okay.

399
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:38,710
- Let's do that.
- Come on.

400
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:41,678
- I'll race you on three. You ready?
- Yeah.

401
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:44,182
One, two...

402
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:45,249
Let's go!

403
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,283
Let's go!

404
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:49,820
And actually,
the school is this way!

405
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:56,193
Where the hell you been,
Eddie? You're late.

406
00:24:56,227 --> 00:25:00,064
Sorry. I got caught up at the market.
Wanna try the most amazing macaroon ever?

407
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:02,733
No, man, just hurry up
and get ready.

408
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,003
What the fuck
is a macaroon?

409
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:23,888
Ludivine.

410
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:26,124
A pleasure to meet you,
Prince Nazir al-Faisal.

411
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:28,259
Please, call me Naz.
Like the rapper.

412
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:31,128
This is Muktar,
my bodyguard.

413
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,198
You don't have to concern yourself
with him. He's just muscle.

414
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,166
Not so bright.

415
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,671
I have to say I was
intrigued by your e-mail.

416
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:43,575
It's not every day a Saudi prince writes
me about a pressing fashion matter.

417
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:48,346
It's not every day I have a
pressing fashion matter.

418
00:25:48,378 --> 00:25:50,013
Not much variety here.

419
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:55,153
Sometimes the robe is black.
Sometimes it's white. Boring.

420
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:57,621
So, what can I do for you?

421
00:25:57,654 --> 00:26:01,960
Ludivine, it's not so much what you can
do for me. It's more my wife, Fatima.

422
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:04,695
-It's her birthday next week.
-That's nice.

423
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:10,335
You see, Ludivine, out of all the designers
out there, Colette is her favorite.

424
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:12,903
That's why I come speak to you.

425
00:26:12,936 --> 00:26:15,839
Wait. You came to me
to get a Colette bag?

426
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:20,044
Not just any Colette bag.
Next season's Colette bag.

427
00:26:20,076 --> 00:26:23,647
The one not in store's yet that
all the women are talking about.

428
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:25,249
You can't be serious.

429
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:28,785
Do you know what Fatima's best
friend Marni got for her birthday?

430
00:26:28,818 --> 00:26:30,954
An island. An island.

431
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:35,058
And Mustafa, he had palm trees
shipped in from Borneo.

432
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:37,929
These women,
they are so competitive.

433
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:41,199
I need that bag.
And you can get it for me.

434
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:44,935
I'm sorry. I don't feel comfortable
continuing this conversation.

435
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,206
Would two million euros
change your mind?

436
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,808
You'll pay me two million euros
to get you Colette's new bag?

437
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:03,987
Is he a friend of yours?

438
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,125
I made a joke about him
one time,

439
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:09,292
so he, like, really took
that really personal.

440
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:12,063
I'm sorry. What part
of Saudi are you from?

441
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:16,768
The Lower East part?

442
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,201
Rivington and Delancey?

443
00:27:18,234 --> 00:27:21,705
Our plane takes off
tomorrow at noon.

444
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:23,975
You have until then
to decide.

445
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,977
I don't need
to make up my mind.

446
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:29,113
I would be happy to design
a one-of-a-kind bag,

447
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:31,415
but I wouldn't betray
Colette for any price.

448
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,018
<i>Au revoir.</i>

449
00:27:41,357 --> 00:27:43,260
What happened?

450
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,461
We almost got shish kebabed,

451
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:47,464
thanks to somebody who was
supposed to check out the lobby!

452
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:50,802
I did, but people come and go.
That's how lobbies work.

453
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,970
Excuses, excuses.

454
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,104
Guys,
what did she say?

455
00:27:53,136 --> 00:27:57,407
Man, the air conditioning. If you see somebody,
can you tell them turn it up a little?

456
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:59,744
-Thank you.
-Guys, what did she say?

457
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:02,313
She checked out.
She didn't do it.

458
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:05,916
-Well, that's a relief.
-We'll get the thief.

459
00:28:06,983 --> 00:28:08,752
I'll meet you at
my apartment tonight?

460
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:10,805
We'll be there.

461
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,824
Great. It's to show
my friend's new collection.

462
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:17,327
I'll have my assistant, Daniel, bring over
some pieces for you to wear. See you.

463
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:24,201
Eddie. Danielle is finally
gonna get you out of Old Navy.

464
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:32,309
Okay, I think this is
gonna work right here.

465
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,778
You do know how ridiculous
that is, right?

466
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:36,980
Danielle Estabara
from Colombia Street.

467
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:39,349
Chicky's sister Danielle
with the big booty.

468
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:42,953
Danielle from the Vladeck's
Housing with the club foot?

469
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:46,891
It's a fact. I'm
irresistible to Danielles.

470
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:52,864
<i>Bonjour. I'm Colette's
assistant, Daniel.</i>

471
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,837
Colette picked them
out for you herself.

472
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,074
Daniel.

473
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:07,444
Come on in, boys! It's just fashion.
It's not gonna kill you.

474
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:16,254
You got something else maybe?

475
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,989
Yeah, good call, bro.

476
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,269
It's not terrible.

477
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,472
Actually...

478
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:50,855
Guys!

479
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:54,157
Hey. I'm so glad you came.

480
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:56,094
- How are you doing?
- Hey.

481
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,263
Eddie,
you look fantastic.

482
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:03,901
This is a little outside my comfort
zone, but I figure, when in Rome...

483
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,569
We're in Paris, dummy.

484
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,506
Eddie, you're a rock star.
Come on in.

485
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,412
- Can I get you some champagne?
- That would be great.

486
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:19,216
I am on that tonight right there.
Or that. Hey.

487
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,917
Excuse me, you look familiar.

488
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:24,989
Did I see you last week... MSG,
Bruno Mars concert, VIP section.

489
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:26,624
- That was you, right?
- No.

490
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,125
- No.
- No.

491
00:30:28,157 --> 00:30:31,161
I'm Luis. This is my
fresh-air fun buddy, Eddie.

492
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:32,345
We're from New York.

493
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:33,496
Brigitte.

494
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:36,901
Not a lot of guys can pull those off.
I'm very impressed.

495
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:39,303
Doesn't he look great?

496
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:42,038
So cheers to Eddie's pants.

497
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:46,443
Nice accent. Did you
study before you came?

498
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,612
<i>Just read Frommer's.</i>

499
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:51,915
Sorry, boys.
I'll be right back.

500
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:55,519
- This is bullshit, man. Give me the pants, bro.
- What?

501
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:58,221
Bro, you're married, I'm single.
Give me the pants.

502
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:00,892
I'm not switching pants. People
have already seen me in these.

503
00:31:00,924 --> 00:31:02,626
Plus I'm not wearing
any underwear.

504
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,327
Just give me the pants.

505
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:06,347
Monsieur Eddie!

506
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:08,332
Charlie!
What's up, little man?

507
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:10,433
Monsieur Eddie?
Who the hell is that?

508
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,470
Colette's son Charlie.
We went bike riding today.

509
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:15,138
You were hangin' out with
Colette and didn't tell me?

510
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:17,575
We ran into each other
while you were sleeping. Why?

511
00:31:17,607 --> 00:31:20,010
Hey, how is
my little man doing?

512
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,362
I love those pants.

513
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:22,680
Thank you.

514
00:31:22,712 --> 00:31:26,683
This is dating now? Texting a
girl at 11:00 on a Friday night?

515
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:28,319
"Hey, you out?"

516
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:31,689
Romance is dead.
It's a shame.

517
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,958
What happened to
picking up a phone,

518
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,626
taking the girl out,
making out a little.

519
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:41,499
- A little?
- What? I like sex. Is that such a crime?

520
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:44,367
I for one, agree.
The double standard...

521
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:48,639
Here's the craziest thing is,
actually, I'm pretty easy, you know.

522
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:51,342
I work hard.
I have a kid.

523
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,576
You put in even
the slightest effort,

524
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:56,379
I will probably
sleep with you.

525
00:31:56,413 --> 00:32:00,550
But what passes for courtship
these days is complete bullshit.

526
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:06,123
I don't know. Maybe we have to
move to New York to find real men.

527
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:10,961
So, Eddie, how did you
and your wife meet?

528
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:12,529
Believe it or not
ninth grade homeroom.

529
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,466
Wait, wait. So you guys have
been together since high school?

530
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:17,535
We did briefly split
sophomore year.

531
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:20,471
I found some notes this guy Hector
Ruiz stuffed in her locker.

532
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:22,973
I still bring it up
every time we fight.

533
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,076
Matter of fact,
I'm married to Luis's sister.

534
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,245
<i>-Really?
-How crazy for you, non?</i>

535
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:31,147
Thank you for asking,
Brigitte.

536
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:33,084
Actually, it was at first...

537
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:36,220
My God!
My God! 1992.

538
00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:40,023
Limelight. You were the doorman.
I knew I recognized you.

539
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:43,527
No, no, no, no, no! I was the doorman!
I was the doorman!

540
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,429
He held the rope.
I told him when to lift it.

541
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:50,033
-It's amazing! I went there every night.
-You went to Limelight?

542
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,434
- Yeah!
- You don't look familiar though.

543
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:53,704
I looked
a little different then.

544
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:55,506
I know.

545
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:59,410
Damn, look at me! Full set
of hair, 30 pounds lighter.

546
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:01,711
- Damn, it was good being young.
- Yeah.

547
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:04,030
You know what? Tonight,
we're all going dancing.

548
00:33:04,031 --> 00:33:06,316
Great idea.

549
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:09,686
It's leather night
at Le Baron!

550
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:13,023
<i>Bonsoir!</i>

551
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,125
<i>Vámonos, Eddie.</i>

552
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,061
You sure you
don't wanna come?

553
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:19,296
To leather night?
You sure you do?

554
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:20,547
I'm just going with it.

555
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:21,765
Don't go too far.

556
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:23,300
You need cab money?

557
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,801
I'm fine, Eddie.

558
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:27,171
Bye.

559
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:30,540
And don't get home too late either, okay?
We have lots to do tomorrow!

560
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:45,456
Hey, hey!
My man! Yo!

561
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:49,093
That's fucked up! You don't even
pick up Puerto Ricans here either!

562
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,729
Damn! Come on!

563
00:33:58,801 --> 00:34:02,238
The last time I was in a club,
you give somebody a 20,

564
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:04,741
you got a lot more than
just one glass of champagne.

565
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:08,079
I haven't been getting
out much lately either.

566
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,880
You miss being married?

567
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,648
Sometimes, yes.

568
00:34:11,681 --> 00:34:15,185
Jerome really hurt me,
but it wasn't all his fault.

569
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,123
I was stressed out. Worked too much.
Forgot all the small stuff.

570
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:21,224
I hear that.
It's hard to balance.

571
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:25,596
You know what hurt the most? If he had
asked me to forgive him, I would have.

572
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:28,398
He just never asked.

573
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:31,734
So, what's your secret for
staying married for 100 years?

574
00:34:31,768 --> 00:34:34,804
We just celebrated 19.

575
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:37,141
The last few
haven't been easy.

576
00:34:37,173 --> 00:34:39,576
Neither were my first few.

577
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,680
That's why God
invented champagne. Cheers.

578
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:01,465
Excuse me.

579
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,768
Hello?

580
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:07,838
Yo!

581
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:11,307
Is the bus is still running? 'Cause I've
been here, like, 30 minutes already.

582
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,443
Sorry, man, no idea.

583
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:16,846
If you have no idea, what the
hell are you doing at a bus stop?

584
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,849
Beautiful night. Nothing
better to do, I guess.

585
00:35:19,882 --> 00:35:22,152
We're in love.

586
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,588
Someone should tell you
love is overrated.

587
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:27,724
"Love is all you need." Do
you know who said that?

588
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:32,195
"Fuck bitches, get money."
Do you know who said that?

589
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:35,332
-Biggie.
-Fuckin' bitch. Damn.

590
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:50,813
Y'all had... Y'all had a bike
all this time? Come on, man.

591
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:54,451
Bye, sad man. By the way,
the bus is on strike.

592
00:35:54,483 --> 00:35:57,521
Fuckin' hipsters.

593
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:02,358
How hungover are
we gonna be tomorrow?

594
00:36:02,391 --> 00:36:04,727
Let's worry
about that tomorrow!

595
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,496
But extremely!

596
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,416
Shirt off, Eddie!

597
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,201
Not cool, man.

598
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,737
Not cool.

599
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:21,244
Daniel,
let's fuckin' do this!

600
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:24,314
Come on!

601
00:36:42,431 --> 00:36:44,000
Hey, baby.

602
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,568
<i>What time is it over there?</i>

603
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,304
It's late, you know. I was
just thinking about you.

604
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:51,408
<i>You strike out with the French
chicks and you're drunk-dialing me?</i>

605
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,611
No, baby, I was just calling
you to... Where are you?

606
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:56,296
Out.

607
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,947
<i>On... On a date?</i>

608
00:36:57,981 --> 00:36:59,583
None of your
damn business!

609
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:02,286
You know what? As a matter
of fact, I gotta run.

610
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:03,721
<i>Hey, Vanessa...</i>

611
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:07,958
So, Vanessa.

612
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,728
So you were telling me about
your baseball card collection.

613
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:23,806
Shit, man, you missed
a wild one last night.

614
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,478
Yo, for a white girl, Colette
sure knows how to get down, bro.

615
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:30,614
Yo, Lou, where you at?

616
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:34,550
You tell my sister you been spending all
your waking hours with another woman?

617
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,452
What's that supposed to mean?

618
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:39,889
- Why'd you lie to me about seeing Colette yesterday?
- I didn't lie.

619
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:42,592
It wasn't a big deal.
I didn't think to mention it.

620
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:46,597
You think something going on between me and
Colette, you been in this room too long.

621
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,800
I don't wanna talk about it.
Let's get dressed.

622
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,803
Just picked up a new batch.

623
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,971
You gotta try
the pistachio, bro.

624
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:57,675
Chill out with this fuckin'
macaroni shit all the time.

625
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,643
-Macaroons!
-Yeah, "maracones," whatever.

626
00:37:59,675 --> 00:38:00,693
Let's go, bro!

627
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:01,711
All right.

628
00:38:01,744 --> 00:38:04,481
I put your hat on the bed.
Hurry up.

629
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:53,897
Francesca, my associates tell me you're
very connected in the fashion world.

630
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:55,865
Correct. Yes.

631
00:38:55,898 --> 00:39:00,103
You mentioned you're
in the coffee business?

632
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,572
Yes, coffee.

633
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:07,510
We specialize in the production,
manufacturing and distribution of coffee.

634
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:09,713
But I'm looking to make
a career change.

635
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:13,416
Do you know
what this is?

636
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:16,085
-Yes, it's a Rolex.
-No.

637
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:18,689
It's a 4,000% profit.

638
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:22,393
It's a fake.
Made in Beijing for $2.50,

639
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:25,496
sold on the Internet
for $200.

640
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:29,833
The margin of profit is way
better than... coffee.

641
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:33,137
Also, if you lose a shipment
of these fake watches,

642
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,608
nobody's gonna throw you out of a
helicopter without a parachute...

643
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,476
like with coffee.

644
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:42,545
Well, Mr. Juarez,

645
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:46,583
while I am impressed by
your entrepreneurial spirit,

646
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:49,853
this is not quite my area
of expertise.

647
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:53,724
You understand? I typically work
with high-end fashion brands.

648
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:55,659
- Like Colette.
- Yes, like Colette.

649
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:57,561
This is your area
of expertise.

650
00:39:57,594 --> 00:40:00,563
Look, I want Colette's
new bag.

651
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:04,435
I have a factory ready
to turn over 10,000 fakes

652
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:08,471
of such high quality that not even Colette
herself could know the difference.

653
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:12,443
We could move them
for $500 apiece.

654
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:13,778
Do the math!

655
00:40:14,978 --> 00:40:17,581
Eddie, do the math.

656
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:21,518
Okay, I do the math.
It's a lot of money.

657
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,987
Yeah!

658
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,056
And what's in it for me?

659
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:29,025
One million euros, cash.

660
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,628
Call it a finder's fee.

661
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:35,031
Call me when you decide.

662
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,134
No, no, no.
No, no.

663
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,835
Keep it. Keep it.

664
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:43,640
And I know it says water
resistant for 500 meters,

665
00:40:43,672 --> 00:40:46,509
but I'd take it off
before I shower, okay?

666
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,945
Thank you, Mr. Juarez.

667
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:58,621
Finally I get to afford
one of these real bad boys?

668
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:00,724
I don't know.
I don't think it was her.

669
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,559
I didn't get
that guilty vibe.

670
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,530
My man. You always hover
over your customers like this,

671
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:08,198
or just the brown ones?

672
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:09,933
Thank you.

673
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:10,900
<i>Bonjour.</i>

674
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,803
- Hey, guys.
- Hey. How you doin'?

675
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:14,387
How'd it go with Francesca?

676
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,938
What? Case closed.
You kidding me?

677
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:18,008
Look, I'm so confident
it's Francesca,

678
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,644
I'm spending my reward money
right here.

679
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,583
Let me ask you something. What do you
think about those earrings right there?

680
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:29,286
Actually,
I think they're hideous.

681
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:33,789
<i>But those look fantastic. You should
get them for your wife, Eddie.</i>

682
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:35,057
- Really?
- Really.

683
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,492
Look kind of old to me.

684
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:37,894
Well, they're antiques.

685
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:41,999
If it really
is Francesca, what do we do?

686
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,601
"We"? We do nothing.

687
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,702
You let us handle this.

688
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:48,806
We're New York's Finest,
after all.

689
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,108
And we're good cops too.

690
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:54,844
In the meantime, we're gonna
investigate the other suspects.

691
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:56,113
Okay.

692
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:59,984
Yo, my man. Do you, like, accept
trade-ins, and stuff like that?

693
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,053
Any sign of Jerome, bro?

694
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:06,623
If I saw something, don't you
think I'd say something?

695
00:42:06,655 --> 00:42:11,027
You ain't gonna see shit because he ain't
got the bag. Francesca got the bag.

696
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,998
If you wanna go to the hotel and do
whatever you've been doing, be my guest.

697
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,067
You would like that,
wouldn't you?

698
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,869
That way you could be Colette's
little hero all by yourself.

699
00:42:19,902 --> 00:42:23,839
- Why is it hard to understand Colette and I are just friends?
- Just friends.

700
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:25,208
Just like me and Pepe.

701
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,744
-You really think I'd cheat on Gloria?
-I'll pretend I'm not here.

702
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:30,746
You know?
I don't know what to think.

703
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:35,285
- All I know is that you spend a lot of time talking with her.
- Yeah, Luis. Talking.

704
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:38,622
Ever cross your mind I like talking
to her 'cause I can relate?

705
00:42:38,655 --> 00:42:39,723
Unlike your childish ass.

706
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:42,625
Like you and some blonde chick
have so much in common.

707
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:45,896
Why do you not see that? -Are
you upset she didn't want you?

708
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:48,798
You think I wanna hit on that?
That's your girl, bro.

709
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:50,900
After all these years,
I thought you was loyal.

710
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:52,702
You better watch what you say.

711
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:54,103
-Or what?
-I'm-a k...

712
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:56,673
Guys? Jerome's home.

713
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:01,677
You know what?
Sit your ass. I'm going alone.

714
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,212
Yeah, like hell you are.

715
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:07,017
Well, sounds like you guys don't
really need me to translate, so...

716
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,887
Get your ass up,
French Fry. Let's go!

717
00:43:20,063 --> 00:43:20,998
NYPD! Hands up!

718
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,701
Where's the bag?
The Colette bag. Where is it?

719
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,870
-He doesn't speak English.
-Don't make me ask you again!

720
00:43:27,903 --> 00:43:29,639
Boy, here we go.

721
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:34,744
Ask this motherfucker where
he's hiding the bag!

722
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:41,083
He doesn't know what bag
and wants to know who you are.

723
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:43,253
The guy who's gonna rip him
a new asshole.

724
00:43:47,222 --> 00:43:49,726
Five seconds before I snap
your arm off.

725
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:50,927
<i>- One!
- Un...</i>

726
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,228
<i>- Two!
- deux...</i>

727
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,064
<i>-Three!
-trois.</i>

728
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:56,734
- You don't need to translate the numbers!
- Yeah, hello?

729
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,902
Yeah, hi, Francesca.

730
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:01,704
Tomorrow afternoon? Café Julien?

731
00:44:01,737 --> 00:44:04,741
Okay. Thank you, Francesca.

732
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:08,110
Eddie, that was Francesca.

733
00:44:08,143 --> 00:44:10,012
She has the bag.

734
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:14,050
Look, tell him I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding, man.

735
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:18,254
He says, "Go fuck"...

736
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:19,288
That I understood.

737
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,961
Fuckin' good apple, man.
Thank you.

738
00:44:45,114 --> 00:44:46,783
So glad you made
the right choice.

739
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,451
Okay, let's do this fast.

740
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,086
- Got the money?
- Got the bag?

741
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:52,255
-I got the bag.
-Let me see the bag.

742
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:54,858
-Let me see the money.
-Let me see the bag!

743
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:56,042
Okay. Here the bag.

744
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:57,193
Let me see.

745
00:45:02,865 --> 00:45:04,934
That's the bag.

746
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:07,070
That's the bag.

747
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,340
That's the money.

748
00:45:10,373 --> 00:45:12,075
It's all the money in there?

749
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:14,077
Counted it myself.

750
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:21,183
<i>Sorry, mami. You should
never trust a drug dealer.</i>

751
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:22,452
Police!

752
00:45:24,253 --> 00:45:26,255
Shit!

753
00:45:33,996 --> 00:45:36,332
Shit, Eddie, way to go!
That was good!

754
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,002
Okay. Okay.
Stand down, amigos. She's ours.

755
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:44,307
Since when you carry guns? I
thought this was like Canada shit.

756
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,248
What the hell's going on?

757
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,050
I guess they've been tracking
the same suspects as you.

758
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,553
Tell the French boy band we got
this handled. We're good.

759
00:45:57,586 --> 00:45:59,355
All we need
is an official confession.

760
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,892
Confession? What confession?
I got the bag.

761
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,528
-She gave me the bag!
-I'm sure it will be easy.

762
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,130
Do you speak English?

763
00:46:07,163 --> 00:46:08,431
No.

764
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:13,336
Don't fuck this up!

765
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:17,274
I want my money,
I wanna go home to America.

766
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:18,942
Okay.

767
00:46:26,248 --> 00:46:28,851
She's confessed
to stealing the bag.

768
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:30,387
You hear that,
Father Joe?

769
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,289
She confessed.

770
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:37,094
Do you mind if I
have a word with her?

771
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:14,096
This is hot, Eddie.

772
00:47:15,297 --> 00:47:17,400
I finally get why you like her.

773
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:09,446
Last night? The bag
was stolen a week ago.

774
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:11,330
I knew she wasn't the thief.

775
00:49:11,331 --> 00:49:13,182
Maybe she mixed up
last night with last week.

776
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,450
She's not our thief.

777
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,684
So, if it's not Francesca...

778
00:49:15,717 --> 00:49:19,154
Okay, look. I don't wanna give these
knuckleheads any more leads, okay?

779
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:21,023
Kate, that bitch!

780
00:49:21,056 --> 00:49:22,591
She said it. She said it.

781
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:25,996
The deadline is in 12 hour.
The board doesn't want to pay.

782
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:29,231
We don't want to be embarrassed by
bootlegger either. We need proof.

783
00:49:29,264 --> 00:49:31,400
And process of elimination
isn't proof.

784
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:32,452
Understood.
We're on it.

785
00:49:32,453 --> 00:49:33,470
Okay.

786
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,574
Get her drunk. She has
a big mouth when she drinks.

787
00:49:37,606 --> 00:49:38,775
Especially gin.

788
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:40,710
Last time we went out
for martinis

789
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:44,014
she told me she gave Nicolas
Sarkozy a hand job at Cannes.

790
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:47,483
I have no clue what she said,
but I got the hand job part.

791
00:49:47,516 --> 00:49:50,019
She also likes hash!

792
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:51,153
And beers!

793
00:49:51,186 --> 00:49:53,289
And coke! She's a model!

794
00:50:02,097 --> 00:50:03,532
What are you doing?

795
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:05,234
Moisturizing.

796
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,735
You do that shit at home?

797
00:50:06,768 --> 00:50:11,206
No, but I'm open to new experiences,
unlike your stubborn ass.

798
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:13,342
I already tried the bidet.
That was enough.

799
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:18,347
That's your kid's
Christmas present.

800
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,484
Use it sparingly, okay?

801
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,210
How you ladies doin'?
How are ya?

802
00:50:50,813 --> 00:50:54,284
Just got here from New York.
Our first time in Paris.-

803
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:56,186
I'm super happy for you.

804
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,153
But we're having
a private conversation here.

805
00:50:58,186 --> 00:51:01,523
That's so sad because I see you
two sitting all alone here,

806
00:51:01,556 --> 00:51:04,159
and I just have one simple
question to ask you

807
00:51:04,193 --> 00:51:06,663
that could change
your life forever.

808
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:08,864
Really?

809
00:51:08,898 --> 00:51:10,733
Well, then, go ahead.

810
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,737
Have you ever been
with a Puerto Rican?

811
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:20,275
Been with two, actually.
Cousins.

812
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:22,211
Yeah. Julio and Javier.

813
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:24,547
Lovely guys.

814
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:25,782
But very possessive.

815
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:27,817
One had a horrible BO.

816
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:29,452
But thank you for the idea.

817
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,192
But were Julio and Javito

818
00:51:36,224 --> 00:51:38,494
packing any of this?

819
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:39,761
You got hash?

820
00:51:39,795 --> 00:51:41,697
Hash?

821
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,168
Honey, Sour Diesel
from the Lower East Side.

822
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,603
You think Paris
is ready for this?

823
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:50,740
You are funny.

824
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:52,442
I like you.

825
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:56,278
You treat me with a little
hospitality, maybe I share.

826
00:51:57,213 --> 00:51:58,815
Garçon.

827
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,449
Let me have a,

828
00:52:00,483 --> 00:52:04,754
dry gin martini
with a twist of lemon?

829
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,325
<i>Trois!</i>

830
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:47,764
Wait, wait, wait.
Is John Leguizamo Puerto Rican?

831
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:52,235
Half. -Well, then I've been with
two and a half Puerto Ricans.

832
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:55,338
Honey, you should try this half.

833
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:58,508
Very nice. Very nice.

834
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,777
Wait, wait.

835
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:03,346
Let's go to Silencio.
Everybody's there.

836
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:05,248
- Okay.
- Yeah?

837
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,416
I'm going to
the ladies room first.

838
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:09,518
Nobody steal my drink.

839
00:53:09,552 --> 00:53:10,687
Okay.

840
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:21,664
Think she's gonna make it?

841
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:40,515
This place sucks.
Let's go to Le Floor.

842
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,820
I hate it here. Everybody's at Les Deux.
Let's go.

843
00:53:44,853 --> 00:53:47,623
This place is depressing.
Everybody's at Andrea's birthday.

844
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,125
I don't know, Kate. Look...

845
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,593
I'll never fuck you.

846
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:51,628
<i>Vámonos.</i>

847
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:03,373
Bro.
Kate is lookin' slammin' hot.

848
00:54:03,405 --> 00:54:05,407
Yeah.

849
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,444
We are close. Do not fuck it up over
some girl you have no shot with.

850
00:54:09,478 --> 00:54:13,950
Bro, he only thing that'll fuck this shit up
is you not being able to control your girl.

851
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:16,986
How many times I gotta tell you,
she's not my girl.

852
00:54:17,018 --> 00:54:18,854
- Hey, boys.
- Hey.

853
00:54:18,887 --> 00:54:20,272
Meet Andrea,
the birthday girl.

854
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:21,657
Hey.

855
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:22,858
Pleasure.

856
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:25,394
Luis.

857
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:27,329
My grandpa does that too.

858
00:54:29,565 --> 00:54:31,900
I love your head.
May I?

859
00:54:31,934 --> 00:54:33,870
Only 'cause it's your birthday.

860
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:46,015
There is a thief
on the loose at this party!

861
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:49,418
A real back-stabbing bitch...

862
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,853
Wha...

863
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:53,322
Watch your bags, ladies!

864
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:55,458
She could never hold her liquor.

865
00:54:57,492 --> 00:54:59,394
What the hell?
I'm trying to help.

866
00:54:59,427 --> 00:55:02,364
Who cares?
My husband cheated on me.

867
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:04,701
My best friend stole from me.

868
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:08,538
Vincent and the suits are worried my bags
won't hit international sales quotas.

869
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,672
I should just jump in
the Seine.

870
00:55:10,706 --> 00:55:13,041
I'm not jumping in after you.
Let's get you home.

871
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:14,676
No.

872
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,746
Why are there never any cabs?

873
00:55:16,778 --> 00:55:19,449
I don't wanna go home!
I wanna drink more!

874
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:20,983
- Everything's closed.
- I know a place.

875
00:55:21,016 --> 00:55:22,335
It's 3:00 AM, Colette.

876
00:55:22,336 --> 00:55:23,653
Okay, just one drink.

877
00:55:23,686 --> 00:55:25,038
One drink and then go home.

878
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:26,389
Okay, maybe two, okay?

879
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:27,523
One!

880
00:55:27,556 --> 00:55:28,958
Could you please
stop running now?

881
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,995
<i>Wah! ¡Uno, dos, tres!</i>

882
00:55:33,027 --> 00:55:37,533
Go, Luis! Go, Luis! Go, Luis!

883
00:55:56,085 --> 00:55:57,552
Fuck, I want a rematch.

884
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:02,557
I want that rematch!

885
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,726
Let's get some air, please.

886
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,729
I don't need air.

887
00:56:06,762 --> 00:56:09,097
But if you need air, yeah,
let's get air.

888
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,833
Good.

889
00:56:10,865 --> 00:56:12,969
Bitch.

890
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:15,003
Big fan of gin?

891
00:56:15,036 --> 00:56:16,672
Yeah, I'm mean.

892
00:56:16,704 --> 00:56:19,608
And gin makes me meaner.

893
00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:23,111
Yeah, your friend Colette was telling
me that you're a fan of wine too?

894
00:56:23,144 --> 00:56:24,780
She mentioned you own
a vineyard?

895
00:56:24,813 --> 00:56:26,581
Well, I'm doing okay lately.

896
00:56:26,614 --> 00:56:28,417
Modeling?

897
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,119
I haven't made money modeling
since '04.

898
00:56:31,152 --> 00:56:34,489
And I blew most of that
on coke and motorcycles.

899
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:36,759
How you buy a vineyard?
Hook a brother up.

900
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:40,929
I shouldn't.
I don't know you well enough.

901
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:44,000
Come on, baby.
You can trust me.

902
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:46,835
Look, where I'm from, everybody
tells me their secrets.

903
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:49,506
I'm like the Oprah
from the Lower East Side.

904
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:55,611
You have to promise me
not to tell Colette.

905
00:56:55,643 --> 00:56:57,979
She'd kill me
if she found out.

906
00:56:58,012 --> 00:57:01,617
Who's Colette? I don't know who Colette is.
I'm not gonna tell Colette.

907
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,123
I'm a madame.

908
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,226
You're a what, now?

909
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:13,896
I'm a madame. A pimp.

910
00:57:13,929 --> 00:57:16,898
See all these girls here?
They work for me.

911
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:20,001
<i>-They're models.
-No, they're broke models.</i>

912
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:23,172
I set them up with rich guys
for accompaniment.

913
00:57:23,204 --> 00:57:25,007
A fancy dinner here.

914
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:26,742
A trip to St. Tropez here.

915
00:57:26,775 --> 00:57:28,545
And everybody is so happy.

916
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,980
I mean, come on, really? Nah.

917
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:35,518
And the only one not happy
is my poor friend Colette.

918
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,119
Colette's not happy?

919
00:57:37,152 --> 00:57:41,023
What? Between the divorce
and selling the company...

920
00:57:41,056 --> 00:57:43,525
Poor thing,
she's having a tough time.

921
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:45,661
I told her not to sell.
I did.

922
00:57:45,693 --> 00:57:47,797
But she didn't listen.

923
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:49,898
Of course
now she regrets it..

924
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:51,399
I thought she was
being dramatic

925
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:55,972
when she said she wanted to quit and
take her son to India for a simple life.

926
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,575
Now I am not so sure.

927
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:00,675
Yeah.

928
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:03,111
A million euros in India
goes a long way?

929
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:07,583
Shit. Listen, I gotta go.

930
00:58:07,615 --> 00:58:10,519
You're leaving me?
Now you got me drunk?

931
00:58:10,552 --> 00:58:12,855
Trust me, I don't
believe it either, okay?

932
00:58:12,887 --> 00:58:14,055
I gotta go, okay?

933
00:58:14,056 --> 00:58:15,223
Come on, Luis.

934
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:16,860
Luis!

935
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:20,864
Marie?

936
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:25,934
Eddie! Eddie!

937
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:29,271
Jump with me.
Let's trash this fucking place!

938
00:58:29,304 --> 00:58:30,606
No, I'm tired.

939
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,576
You need to chill out. Plus, I left
my credit card for incidentals.

940
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:35,778
Okay.

941
00:58:40,014 --> 00:58:41,717
May I?

942
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,184
Jesus, you too?

943
00:58:43,217 --> 00:58:46,188
If I say no, you're gonna
do it anyway, so go ahead.

944
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:50,826
How often do you have to shave
to keep it so soft?

945
00:58:50,858 --> 00:58:53,261
Every morning.

946
00:58:58,867 --> 00:59:01,037
You're a simple man, Edgar.

947
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,739
I respect that.

948
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:07,309
Your heart is pure
and your head is shiny.

949
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:15,183
Things used to be
simple for me too.

950
00:59:16,952 --> 00:59:19,989
Every Sunday, Jerome would
make blueberry pancakes.

951
00:59:21,123 --> 00:59:23,092
They were terrible,
but they were his thing.

952
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,830
Charlie would take two bites
and pretend to like them,

953
00:59:27,862 --> 00:59:31,067
and then we all go get
a proper brunch in the Marais.

954
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:37,139
Things are more
complicated now.

955
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:40,876
Maybe I made the wrong choice.
That's what Jerome always says.

956
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:42,679
Don't listen to him.

957
00:59:44,413 --> 00:59:46,315
Do you think
I'm a sellout, Eddie?

958
00:59:46,347 --> 00:59:48,217
Doesn't matter what I think.

959
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,385
Yeah, it matters to me.

960
00:59:50,418 --> 00:59:52,387
I trust you.

961
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,923
I don't think
you're a sellout at all.

962
00:59:58,693 --> 00:59:59,995
It's okay. Hey.

963
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,297
No, I'm married.

964
01:00:18,746 --> 01:00:19,848
- Hey.
- Hey.

965
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,766
Hey. How'd it go, man?

966
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:41,003
I should be asking you that.

967
01:00:43,905 --> 01:00:48,309
Listen, Kate's clean,
everybody's clean.

968
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:51,346
The only one that ain't clean
is your little French friend.

969
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,615
What are you talking about?

970
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:53,849
Think about it, bro.

971
01:00:53,882 --> 01:00:55,217
She loses her husband.

972
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:58,887
She's miserable at her job, so she
says, you know, fuck these suits.

973
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,991
Steals her own bag, pockets a million
euro cash, then she disappears.

974
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:05,695
There's no way. Colette isn't
dirty like that, man.

975
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:09,699
She's dirty enough to be coming out
of your hotel room at 5:00 AM.

976
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:13,735
Face it. She's shoving her titties
to throw you off, and it's working.

977
01:01:13,768 --> 01:01:15,136
Nothing happened between us.

978
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,740
Look, I hate to break it
to you, Ed,

979
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:20,041
but Colette...
She's not your friend.

980
01:01:20,074 --> 01:01:23,178
She's been playing you all this time.
You're too dumb to see it.

981
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:25,880
Colette isn't the thief,
and stop calling me dumb.

982
01:01:25,914 --> 01:01:28,017
Then smarten up.
Look around, dummy.

983
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:30,486
It's killing you
to see me do better than you.

984
01:01:30,518 --> 01:01:31,786
Please, get a grip.

985
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:35,156
All these years, you've got me
under your thumb like a sidekick.

986
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,860
God forbid, I step out of your shadow.
You can't handle it!

987
01:01:38,893 --> 01:01:40,962
Then step out of my shadow.

988
01:01:40,996 --> 01:01:43,231
I've been wanting
a new partner anyway, dick.

989
01:01:43,264 --> 01:01:46,067
So have I. You think you're
the brains of the operation?

990
01:01:46,101 --> 01:01:47,436
All you are is a fucking ego.

991
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:48,771
Whatever.

992
01:01:48,804 --> 01:01:51,006
Look, I'm turning Colette
into Vincent.

993
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:53,776
I'm getting my money and
getting the hell out of Paris.

994
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:55,745
You can stay here
with Colette.

995
01:01:55,777 --> 01:01:59,247
I'll go home, and I'll take care of
my sister, Gloria, your ex-wife.

996
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:05,320
Say something now, dick!

997
01:02:15,496 --> 01:02:16,898
Yo.

998
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,702
What are you doing here?

999
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:23,905
I wanted to come down here to
personally tell you I found your thief.

1000
01:02:23,938 --> 01:02:25,907
- It's Colette.
- Colette?

1001
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,308
What are you talking about?

1002
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:29,211
Well, she regrets selling you
her company.

1003
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:31,180
She's telling all her friends
she's miserable.

1004
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:33,449
So she's self-sabotaging
for a quick payday.

1005
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:37,353
She's confessed as much to you or you have
some other proof? -She's banging Eddie!

1006
01:02:37,385 --> 01:02:39,255
What more proof do I need?

1007
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,824
And I'll take his cut
of the reward.

1008
01:02:42,858 --> 01:02:44,960
You think I can accuse
my business partner,

1009
01:02:44,992 --> 01:02:47,061
one of the most beloved
designer in Paris,

1010
01:02:47,094 --> 01:02:49,531
of extortion and fraud
with no proof?

1011
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:52,101
Trust me, okay. It's Colette.

1012
01:02:52,134 --> 01:02:56,038
Well, as much as I would love
to just take your word on that,

1013
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,807
I'm afraid that's
not good enough.

1014
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,510
- Okay.
- I was on the phone with our board earlier this morning.

1015
01:03:02,543 --> 01:03:07,148
At this point we have no choice but to pay
the ransom and put this matter to rest.

1016
01:03:07,181 --> 01:03:10,919
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for a meeting.

1017
01:03:13,554 --> 01:03:17,125
I trust you can see yourself out
the same way you saw yourself in.

1018
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:25,434
I must say, I expected more
from New York's Finest.

1019
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:33,976
"I must say, I expected more
from New York's Finest."

1020
01:03:34,009 --> 01:03:35,478
Yeah, buddy.

1021
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:43,085
<i>Merci beaucoup, bro.</i>

1022
01:04:21,356 --> 01:04:23,225
<i>What the fuck
was I thinking?</i>

1023
01:04:23,257 --> 01:04:25,226
I'm sorry
I tried to kiss you.

1024
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,929
<i>I had too much to drink.</i>

1025
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:28,597
Nah. It's all good.

1026
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:30,298
Is that you playing it cool?

1027
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:32,367
What? Nah. Nah.

1028
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,202
Okay. 'Cause you're saying
"nah" a lot.

1029
01:04:34,235 --> 01:04:36,972
- For real?
- Okay.

1030
01:04:38,673 --> 01:04:41,610
Let me call you
right back, okay?

1031
01:04:41,643 --> 01:04:43,012
Vincent?

1032
01:06:30,751 --> 01:06:31,686
<i>Merde!</i>

1033
01:06:50,505 --> 01:06:51,640
I need soap.

1034
01:06:57,112 --> 01:06:59,414
And a towel.

1035
01:07:06,253 --> 01:07:08,289
Bring back the leftover soap!

1036
01:07:10,391 --> 01:07:12,693
- So, gentlemen...
- Bro, I'm all out of fuckin' euros.

1037
01:07:12,726 --> 01:07:15,364
I'll send you a Christmas card.

1038
01:07:20,802 --> 01:07:22,838
Guys, wait!

1039
01:07:26,507 --> 01:07:30,111
I really need to talk to you. -What
the fuck you do to your hair?

1040
01:07:30,144 --> 01:07:33,614
Something crazy is happening. Vincent
fired me. I have no idea what's going on.

1041
01:07:33,648 --> 01:07:37,352
That's really too bad, 'cause we've got
a flight to catch, so we gotta go.

1042
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:40,189
-Okay. Okay. I'll take you to the airport.
-Bye, Colette.

1043
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:43,358
Get in the fucking car
before I lose it!

1044
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:46,195
So he spins some bullshit
about gross negligence

1045
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,863
and basically says
I have no recourse.

1046
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:49,631
The whole thing
is ridiculous!

1047
01:07:49,664 --> 01:07:51,500
Are you actually
gonna watch the road?

1048
01:07:51,532 --> 01:07:53,534
You see? That was a stop sign.

1049
01:07:53,568 --> 01:07:55,737
I can't compete
with their team of lawyers.

1050
01:07:55,769 --> 01:07:58,539
You should've thought about that
before you stole your own bag,

1051
01:07:58,572 --> 01:08:00,576
- made us go on this wild-goose chase.
- What?

1052
01:08:00,608 --> 01:08:02,677
You think I'm the one
behind this?

1053
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,745
You can't believe that!

1054
01:08:03,778 --> 01:08:07,449
We investigated everybody, okay?
None of 'em did it.

1055
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:09,684
So that doesn't leave
too many suspects now.

1056
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:13,288
You think it was me too? -I
honestly don't know what to think.

1057
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,225
Eddie. That's how
you see me now, a thief?

1058
01:08:16,257 --> 01:08:20,429
I thought we were friends! I thought I'd
go to New York and meet your family.

1059
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:22,631
Shit.
I never got Gloria a gift.

1060
01:08:22,663 --> 01:08:23,831
Damn!

1061
01:08:23,864 --> 01:08:25,701
That is so much like you, Eddie.

1062
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:29,338
No reward money, no gift, and she
was already mad when I left.

1063
01:08:31,206 --> 01:08:32,608
Give her these, bro.

1064
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:35,443
Thanks, man.

1065
01:08:35,476 --> 01:08:37,613
You should have stuck
to just making sunglasses.

1066
01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:39,047
They wasn't so bad.

1067
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:40,448
I don't make sunglasses.

1068
01:08:40,481 --> 01:08:43,318
They said "Colette" on them.
You're just full of lies.

1069
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:46,554
What? Give me those!

1070
01:08:46,587 --> 01:08:48,022
Where'd you get these?

1071
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:49,457
I got them
from Vincent's office.

1072
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:53,261
He had all kind of styles.
I should've stole all of 'em.

1073
01:09:06,474 --> 01:09:07,609
Colette, what are you doing?

1074
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:08,744
Just follow me.

1075
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,878
You're the only ones
I can actually trust.

1076
01:09:10,912 --> 01:09:14,850
What the hell you talking about?
We don't trust you at all!

1077
01:09:14,882 --> 01:09:16,385
Damn.

1078
01:09:37,572 --> 01:09:40,509
You set me up to look negligent
so you could fire me

1079
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:42,911
and use my name to sell
cheap sunglasses

1080
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:44,680
and perfumes
and God knows what else!

1081
01:09:44,712 --> 01:09:47,282
You stole the bag!
You wrote the ransom notes!

1082
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:49,483
This whole shit was you!

1083
01:09:49,516 --> 01:09:52,554
Sorry, gentlemen, she's clearly
unhappy about her termination.

1084
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:02,765
Open your safe. There's a safe
somewhere, and the bag is in it.

1085
01:10:04,565 --> 01:10:06,667
He ruined my life's work
to sell shitty sunglasses.

1086
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:09,404
I'm not going anywhere
until I get some answers!

1087
01:10:09,436 --> 01:10:13,774
-Is there a safe in this office, Vincent?
-I'd look behind the painting.

1088
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:16,545
Rich white guy, they're always
hiding shit behind paintings.

1089
01:10:16,578 --> 01:10:20,382
Okay. As a matter of fact,
I do have a safe.

1090
01:10:20,414 --> 01:10:23,784
I don't think it's appropriate that this
woman barges in here with some crackpot...

1091
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:25,253
Open it.

1092
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:26,755
Open it.

1093
01:10:32,793 --> 01:10:34,329
Fine.

1094
01:10:54,682 --> 01:10:55,751
Well, shit.

1095
01:10:57,985 --> 01:10:59,520
I know it's in here.

1096
01:10:59,554 --> 01:11:01,623
I know it's in here!

1097
01:11:03,891 --> 01:11:06,828
I was gonna
take him out right then.

1098
01:11:08,029 --> 01:11:11,367
Don't touch me. I'll leave
on my own when I'm ready.

1099
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:15,369
I thought we were friends,
Vincent,

1100
01:11:15,403 --> 01:11:17,472
but you're just a snake.

1101
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,355
Don't even think
about it, Pepe.

1102
01:11:33,387 --> 01:11:35,658
Excuse me.
Can I borrow your chair?

1103
01:11:36,557 --> 01:11:38,594
Move back, please?

1104
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,369
Shit!

1105
01:11:48,403 --> 01:11:50,673
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

1106
01:11:51,905 --> 01:11:55,042
What the... Get the
fuck away from there!

1107
01:11:55,076 --> 01:11:56,712
Get the...

1108
01:12:03,984 --> 01:12:07,054
Probably didn't need to break
homeboy's tank. My bad.

1109
01:12:07,087 --> 01:12:08,823
Fuckin' Eddie, man!

1110
01:12:08,856 --> 01:12:10,809
I'm not crazy?

1111
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:12,761
No, you're not crazy!

1112
01:12:20,568 --> 01:12:23,038
-Fucking Puerto Rican!
-Check it out, Eddie.

1113
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:24,939
I finally got some ass
in Paris.

1114
01:12:29,676 --> 01:12:33,581
I gotta say, Eddie that was really good
detective work. I'm really impressed.

1115
01:12:33,614 --> 01:12:36,050
Well, somebody's gotta be
the brains of the operation.

1116
01:12:38,185 --> 01:12:41,422
You know nothing happened between
Colette and I, right? -I know.

1117
01:12:41,456 --> 01:12:44,726
I love Gloria, man. I would
never do anything to lose her.

1118
01:12:44,759 --> 01:12:47,095
- Yeah, I guess she's stuck with your broke ass.
- Broke?

1119
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:49,663
I just made 150 grand, bro.

1120
01:12:49,697 --> 01:12:51,565
After I pay off
all my credit cards,

1121
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:55,404
I may even be able to take Gloria
to a restaurant with cloth napkins.

1122
01:12:55,436 --> 01:12:57,538
Yeah, she's lucky to have you.

1123
01:12:57,572 --> 01:12:59,041
And so am I, partner.

1124
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:04,696
It's still a matter
of pride at this point.

1125
01:13:04,697 --> 01:13:06,515
Trust me on this.

1126
01:13:12,453 --> 01:13:14,689
My God,
this is fucking delicious.

1127
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:24,560
What the fuck
did you do in Paris, Edgar?

1128
01:14:26,594 --> 01:14:28,096
-You like?
-Like?

1129
01:14:28,128 --> 01:14:30,097
I love! My gosh!

1130
01:14:31,599 --> 01:14:33,668
How'd you know
to pick these out?

1131
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:35,270
I had help from a friend.

1132
01:14:35,302 --> 01:14:37,738
You need to get help
more often.

1133
01:14:37,771 --> 01:14:40,708
-You look beautiful.
-Yes, you're gonna get some.

1134
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:45,263
Want me to do
all the work?

1135
01:14:45,264 --> 01:14:46,547
All the work.

1136
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:48,048
- All the work?
- All of it.

1137
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:02,097
Hi.

1138
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,733
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1139
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:07,168
No.

1140
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:08,837
Okay.

1141
01:15:08,869 --> 01:15:11,640
I guess I'm gonna have to
do it from out here!

1142
01:15:14,141 --> 01:15:17,645
I traveled 4,000 miles,

1143
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,881
and I finally realized
what I was looking for

1144
01:15:19,913 --> 01:15:22,050
was always right
in front of me.

1145
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:25,719
I mean, not at the moment,
but you know what I mean?

1146
01:15:25,752 --> 01:15:28,088
All you need is love.

1147
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:30,893
I get that now.

1148
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:33,996
<i>You write that
all by yourself?</i>

1149
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:41,235
My God.

1150
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:42,520
Yeah!

1151
01:15:42,521 --> 01:15:43,771
I do! I do! I do!

1152
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:44,906
I do!

1153
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:46,007
Okay. Wait,
no not yet.

1154
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:48,009
- Let me ask you first.
- Go ahead.

1155
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:50,745
- Look at this ring!
- Yeah, it's an antique from Paris.

1156
01:15:50,778 --> 01:15:53,615
My God. An antique from Paris?
That's dope.

1157
01:15:53,648 --> 01:15:54,949
- Can I finish?
- Yes.

1158
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:56,935
Will you do me the...

1159
01:15:56,936 --> 01:15:58,887
But I have to say
you look so cute right now.

1160
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,791
My God,
give me a minute!

1161
01:16:23,911 --> 01:16:26,981
Gelato and ice cream. I mean,
I can't tell the difference.

1162
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:28,333
What is it?

1163
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,651
Gelato's got more fat.

1164
01:16:29,684 --> 01:16:32,186
Don't tell me that shit,
Eddie. For real?

1165
01:16:58,979 --> 01:17:01,782
Yo, my man. Can I take
a picture with the snake?

1166
01:17:01,815 --> 01:17:03,652
Shit!

1167
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:06,888
Eddie, come on,
jump with me.

1168
01:17:06,921 --> 01:17:08,890
Let's trash this place!

1169
01:17:08,922 --> 01:17:11,126
No, I'm tired.

1170
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:14,094
I had a booger.

1171
01:17:21,101 --> 01:17:24,439
That's crazy. Can we get
some more wine? Thanks.

1172
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:27,708
My God! My God!

1173
01:17:27,742 --> 01:17:30,078
What are you doin'?
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

1174
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,746
My God!

1175
01:17:31,779 --> 01:17:35,250
Of course I don't, baby,
because we're gonna...

1176
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:38,987
Course not, baby, because we're going
to the Garden to see Bruno's...

1177
01:17:40,755 --> 01:17:45,060
Course I don't, baby, because we're going

Perfect delivery
but you said "the MSG."

MSG. At MSG.

1180
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:50,798
Bye.

1181
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,767
And don't go... don't...

1182
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,269
Don't get home too late either!

1183
01:17:54,301 --> 01:17:58,139
We have so much to do.
So much shopping in Paris.
