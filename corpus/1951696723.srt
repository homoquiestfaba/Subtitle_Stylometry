1
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,375
Come on.

2
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,500
Vincent.

3
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,750
No, no. Bad idea.
Bad idea.

4
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,666
"Do not feed bears"

5
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,125
Just take what you need.

6
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,666
Just take what you need.

7
00:03:55,916 --> 00:04:00,541
RJ?
No.

8
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:04,791
The moon's not full.

You woke me up a week early?

9
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:15,625
Don't tell me you're actually 
dumb enough to 
steal my stuff.

10
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,750
RJ I'm gonna have to kill you.

11
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,791
Please, I'm just a desperate guy 
trying to feed his family.

12
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,291
- You don't have a family.

- I meant a family of one.

13
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:30,291
Ok, wait, wait ,wait.
Look, it's still in 
the cave so technically not stolen.

14
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,666
Oh, no.

15
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,541
Slope!

16
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,000
Stop.

17
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,541
Phew! That was close.

18
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,166
Vincent wait,
I can get it all back!

19
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,541
That's right, if you eat me

you'd have to do it.

20
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,791
But I can get it.
All of it!

21
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,791
- A red wagon?
- Redder!

22
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:11,041
- The blue cooler?
- Cooler, on my list.

23
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,416
- Gotta be blue?

- Yes, and I want my Spuddies.

24
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,916
I love those things.

Cos when you eat Spuddies 
enough just isn't enough.

25
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:25,125
So true, painfully true. 
And I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna get the 
giant picnic pack family fun-size.

26
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,291
- They have that?

- I'm pretty sure.

27
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:35,125
Alright RJ, I'm going back to sleep.

When that moon is full I'm waking up.

28
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:40,291
And all my stuff had better 
be right back where it was.

29
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,666
But that's just one week.

That's impossible for one guy...

30
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,791
A week's perfect.
I'll get some helpers.

31
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,291
Full moon.
All my stuff.

32
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,541
and don't even think about running away

33
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:55,125
because if you do, 
I will hunt you down.
And kill you.

34
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,166
Ok, buddy.
You just rest easy 
all right cos I'm on it.

35
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,291
A week from now

you're gonna be laughing about this thing.

36
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,791
"Over The Hedge"™

37
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,291
Ahhh cold!
The one place i 
didn't have a shell.

38
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,000
Spring.

39
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,041
That means there's only 
274 days left till winter!

40
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,000
Everybody wake up!
Hibernation's over!

41
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,166
Morning!
- Morning Hammy.

42
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,416
I gotta go wee-wee.

43
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,916
Oh! Not in the lake we drink from!

44
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,916
Let's go alright the rest of you, 
it's spring!

45
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,041
That means we got to get to work.

46
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,416
Ahh, finish.
Ohh! No, wait!

47
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,166
Come on everybody wake up.

Don't make me come in there.

48
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,875
Y'all better listen.
I've been holding 
something in all winter.

49
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,625
and I'm about to let it out.

50
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,166
Thank you, Stella.
- Oh I can clear a room, Verne.

51
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,916
That much I can do.

52
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:50,375
Goodmorning everyone.

Just a superduper morning eh.

53
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,250
Woah, not looking so good

around the eyes there, hon.

54
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,541
Bucky and Grill were 
up every 3 or 4 weeks.

55
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,416
and Spikey kept poking me.

56
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,291
Well, he's kinda poky.

57
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,166
Yup, he's the sharpest of the bunch.

58
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,625
You know what?

How about i take the day shift.

59
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,666
Oh Lou, that'd be just super.

60
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,541
Alright kids, you heard your mother

and now you listen to me.

61
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,791
Shape up there!

62
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,666
This is what I was afraid of.

63
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,291
Where's the food? Is there any food left?

I'm really hungry! 
So is there any food left in here?!

64
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,791
We ate all the food 
Hammy,
during the winter.

65
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,666
So, we gotta go and get somemore now.

66
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,791
I hid some nuts in the woods and I 
know where they are now so I'll be right back. 
Bye!

67
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,916
Dad, it was just snow.

68
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,250
What? It could have been a predator.

69
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,666
Isn't playing dead a little...weak?

70
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,916
Heather, how many times must i say it?

71
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,791
Playing possum is what we do.

72
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,041
We die,
so that we live!

73
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,000
Kids, ok
so just calm down!

74
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,041
This is a week to find you a you 
know,
a good fella.

75
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,625
A good fella?

76
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,916
Why does everyone think
 
I need a man, huh?

77
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,250
I look like a mess
and smell like a swamp.

78
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:09,000
So when you find a fella who is decent,

good with kids and has no sense of smell, call me.

79
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,916
Oh look, food!

80
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,541
Well i think you know,
what this means.

81
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,500
Verne?
- Just a minute, Hammy.

82
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:33,041
This means we are nine berries

away from starvation.

83
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,291
Sorry, that was a little intense.

84
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,875
I meant really serious hunger pains.

85
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,166
Verne!
- Not finished, Hammy.

86
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,541
Mornin' Lou, Penny. 
-Thanks.
Hey kids.

87
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,750
So, what i want to tell you all is...

88
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,250
I'm not done, Hammy!

If you have to go again, just go!

89
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,625
Ok, so all I'm saying is that

we got a little close.

90
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,375
So this year we got to make sure 
we fill the log...

- all the way to the top.

91
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,416
Exactly!
All the way to the top!

92
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,666
Because, what are we?

- Foragers!

93
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,291
And what do we forage?

- Food!

94
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,166
Super Verne, really super.

- Ok, Hammy.

95
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,416
What is it?
- What is what?

96
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,125
What is it you wanted to tell me?

97
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,666
Ohh..What was it, what was it, what was it?!

98
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,291
Right at the tip of my tongue!

99
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,875
Oh yeah, there's a weird thing over there!

I've never seen before!

100
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,291
It's really scary!
Follow me!

101
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,541
Ok, meeting called on account of weird, 
scary thing.

102
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,416
Hmm, Foragers.

103
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,625
Hammy, what weird thing?

104
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,666
Oh, that weird thing.

105
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,666
It never ends!

106
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,500
It never ends that way too.

107
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,000
What is this thing?
- Heather, no!

108
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,291
I'm scared.
- Me too, mommy.

109
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,375
It's ok, It's just a...

What is this thing Lou?

110
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,416
Well, it's a... Verne?

111
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:46,916
Well, it's obviously
some kind of bush.

112
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,000
I would be a lot less afraid of it

if I just know what's it called.

113
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Let's call it Steve.

114
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,916
Steve?
- It's a pretty name.

115
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,916
Steve sounds nice.

- Ya, and a lot less scary, Steve.

116
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,125
Oh, great and powerful 
Steve,
what do you want?

117
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,250
I don't think he can speak.

118
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,625
I heard that, young man.

119
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,791
You get over here right now!

120
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,791
Hammy, get back here.

- But Steve is angry.

121
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,166
I think it came from the other side of Steve,

I mean the bush, I mean...jeez...

122
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,875
Look there's only one way we can find out

what this thing is.

123
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,125
and what this is all about,

I'm gonna go check it out.

124
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,125
Steve ate Verne!

125
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,541
Alright Steve, you brought this on yourself.

126
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,291
Stella, don't.

I'm not eaten.

127
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,041
I just tripped.

128
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm gonna go over there,

don't anybody move.

129
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,791
What is this place?

130
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,666
Hey there, little...

131
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:29,875
fella.

132
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,166
Good day, can I help you?

133
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,291
Oh, I can talk.
I'm just driving.

134
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,041
What was that?

- Mama, get him.

135
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,541
What was over there?

Freaky, pink primates.

136
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,916
They must have come while we were hibernating

and they...it was awful.

137
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,791
They had wheels on their feet,

and they had these sticks.

138
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,541
And they were whacking me with these sticks

like it was some kind of sick game.

139
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:54,291
You should have died!

You should have laid down, and died.

140
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,625
That's not the worst part,

half the forest is gone!

141
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:04,541
All the trees, the berry bushes,

they're just, gone.

142
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,375
What will we do for food?

143
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,791
I don't know.
But, here's what I do know.

144
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:18,041
We will be fine as long as no one 

goes over Steve again.

145
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,041
It's called a hedge.

146
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,041
And it is not to be feared
 
my amphibious friend.

147
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,375
It is the gateway to the good life.

148
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,916
I'm a reptile actually, 

but you know it's a common mistake.

149
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:34,000
And you are?
- Oh, where are my manners?

150
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,791
I'm RJ.
Now please don't think I'm prying.

151
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:42,416
But I couldn't help overhearing, and I 

think I can shed a little light on what this 
whole hedge situation is about.

152
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,291
You see, what was once mere wilderness 

is now...

153
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:49,625
54 acres of man-made manicured 
air-condtioned paradise.

154
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,875
Except for that little bitty speck,
you are here.

155
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,541
Noo, that's a good thing.
 
You're hibernaters right?

156
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,000
Gather up a bunch of food, 

store it away for the winter?

157
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,416
Uh-huh, we fill the log.

158
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,166
Really? This log?
This cave-like log?

159
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,416
All the way to the top.
- Ozzie!

160
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,791
Let me ask kid?

How long does it take, to fill the log?

161
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,541
274 days.

162
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,291
Ever done it in a week?

163
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,416
That's impossible.
- Not if we work together.

164
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:22,125
You see, you've got the food gathering skills, 
I've got
the know-how, and they've got the food!

165
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,041
How much food?

- Loads of food!

166
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,750
Heaps of food!
Food out the wa-zoo!

167
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:31,625
Well, you know whatever food comes 
out of the wa-zoo,
I don't think we're really 
interested in eating.

168
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,916
I don't know, the guy's making a lot of 
sense to me.
I think we should listen.

169
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,291
Yea...I'm ok with wa-zoo food.

- No, you're not.

170
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,916
The tail is tingling.

171
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,750
The what,
is what?

172
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,916
When something doesn't feel right
 
my tail tingles.

173
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,916
And let me tell you something.

Everything you said so far is 
driving my tail crazy.

174
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,791
Listen. Verne, right?
This isn't something 
you need to be afraid of.

175
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,166
Well, I am.
And for good reason.

176
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:01,750
This is not a birthmark.

- Cos' you went over there without a guide Verne.

177
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,291
Whatever, thanks for stopping by,
we're not interested.

178
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,791
Not interested in the most delicious 

food you've ever tasted?

179
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,625
Come on.
- Not, interested.

180
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:19,625
Ok, I get it. I understand.
This is 
something you're just not open to.

181
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,500
What is that?!

182
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,666
That my friend is
a magical combination of...

183
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:41,291
corn, dehydrated cheese solids,

VHA, VHT and good'ol MSG.

184
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:45,000
Aka, the chip.
Nacho cheese flavour.

185
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,875
Damn, Verne, those were good.

186
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,916
It's all good,
and we're going over there, tonight.

187
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,625
Welcome, to suburbia.

188
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,791
Hey mom, look at us.

189
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,541
How's that tail, Verne?

190
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:17,416
Listen, if anybody in this family 

gets hurt, I'm holding you personally responsible.

191
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,666
They're having a good time,

I'll take responsibility for that.

192
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:28,416
Hey Verno, I took a few clippings 
out of my quills
to do a little comparison,

193
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,875
Look at this,
the grass seems to 
be greener over here.

194
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:36,041
Verne, are you certain you 
came to the same place?

- Yeah, cos you know the racoon says...

195
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,541
Ok, enough about him.
I get it.

196
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:42,416
So, he can do a couple of tricks,

I mean it's not like he can walk on water.

197
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,750
Hey, everybody.
This way to the food.

198
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,291
What is that?
- That is an SUV.

199
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:55,416
Humans ride around in it,

because they are slowly losing their ability to walk.

200
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,000
Jeepers, that's so big.

- How many humans fit in there?

201
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,666
Usually?
One.

202
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,000
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp,
your president.

203
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,875
Of the Home-owners Association.

204
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,500
What is that?
- Easy, easy. Don't worry.

205
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:15,041
That's just a human being.
And 
they're just as scared of us, as we are of them.

206
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,541
Now, if a human does happen to see you,
just lay down...

207
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,791
roll over, and give your privates

a good licking. They love it.

208
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,250
The charter, which you signed,

says the grass is supposed to be 2 inches.

209
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,291
But, according to my measuring stick,
yours is 2.5.

210
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,791
Can we just get the food
and go?

211
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:35,916
Do they have it or not?

- Din't you see, it was in the box.

212
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,166
They always got food with them.

We eat to live, these guys live to eat.

213
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,041
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

214
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,541
The human mouth,
is called the piehole.

215
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,166
The human being, is called the couch potato.

216
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,791
That is the device
to summon food.

217
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,166
That is one of the many
voices of food.

218
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,916
That is the portal
for the passing of the food.

219
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,416
That is where the many food 

transportation occurs.

220
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,791
Humans bring the food, 
take the food,
ship the food.

221
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,666
They drive the food.
They wear the food.

222
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,291
That gets the food hot.

That keeps the food cold.

223
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,250
That...
I'm not sure what that is.

224
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,750
Whadda' ya know,
food!

225
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,791
That is the altar
where they worship food.

226
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,125
That's what they need 

when they've eaten too much food.

227
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,791
That get rids of the guilt
 
so they can eat more food!

228
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,916
Food!
Food!
Food!

229
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,875
So, you think they have enough?

230
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,791
Well they don't. 
For humans,
enough is never enough.

231
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,541
And what do they do with 

the stuff they don't eat?

232
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:47,375
They put it in gleaming,  
silver cans.
Just for us.

233
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,416
Dig in!

234
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,125
Good, isn't it?

235
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:07,625
That's a diaper,
and that does 
come out of a wa-zoo.

236
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,750
What do you think, was i right,
or was i right?

237
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,916
And these things are just the scraps!

238
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,041
Wait till you see what comes in the boxes,

and the packages, and the cans.

239
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,041
You stick with me, and in one week 

we'll gather enough food to...

240
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,541
to feed a bear!

241
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,250
Just, figure of speech.

242
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,000
Halt!
Intruders! Intruders!

243
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,291
Get out, all of you!
- What is it, Skapy?

244
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,125
What are you doing?

- You said we should lick our...

245
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,166
No! Next step!
Run!

246
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,250
Run!
- Get out of here!

247
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,500
I just bought this patio.

248
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,416
You kids ok?
Hon, you alright there?

249
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:05,416
See what i mean?

That's what I was talking about.

250
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,500
This humans don't want us around.

251
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,791
So, we scared her and she overreacted.

252
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,666
No biggie.
- No biggie?

253
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,000
Ohh...That is what we call a biggie.

254
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,041
Come on, think about all the food,

it was worth it for that food.

255
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,791
That stuff is to die for.

256
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:25,416
Let me rephrase that.

- No, to die for, you nailed that part.

257
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:29,500
Seems our little forest life looks too
 
primitive to a guy with a bag.

258
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:33,500
But I think I speak for the whole family
 
when I say we want nothing...

259
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,875
to do with anything 

that's over that hedge.

260
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,041
Oh, come on.

261
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,041
Y'all haven't even tried donuts yet.

262
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,375
You want to store fat?

That is the way to store some fat.

263
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,291
You'll be sweating through the winter.

264
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,916
Ok, alright, you guys sleep on it.

265
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,000
Good idea, I'm gonna check back with ya.

266
00:23:57,041 --> 00:24:00,500
Shoot!
Almost had it.

267
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,666
...food...

268
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,541
Time's up, RJ.
- But I have six more days!

269
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:50,625
Ohh...four paws, fur,
still alive...still alive.

270
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:12,375
Ok kids, dive in, there it is.

Bark for breakfast.

271
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,916
I want a donut.
- I want pizza.

272
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:36,375
Ok, this is great.

273
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,250
Granted, it takes some time to chew.

274
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:53,750
That was very satisfying.

And by the way, lots of fibre in there too.

275
00:25:56,791 --> 00:26:00,041
I gotta admit
that does look tasty.

276
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:04,916
What are you doing here?

- I'm here to help you with your... foraging thing.

277
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:11,166
Look, Verne. You said a word yesterday,

about your little gang here, starts with an F.

278
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,166
Do you remember what it was?

279
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,416
Family?
- Right. 
You know, that got me right here.

280
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:23,416
You see, Verne. I used to have all that.

My own place, surrounded by loved ones.

281
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,250
Universal remote.

282
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:29,916
But then all that went away with the...

weed-hack incident.

283
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,250
Ohh...come here.

284
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:41,666
Jeepers, Verne.
- We could always use 
the extra hand there, you know.

285
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,666
The weed-hacker, Verne.

286
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,166
Not your problem.
I'll just go.

287
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:55,250
This is me, going.

288
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:03,166
Sure I'll see you around the forest.

289
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,041
Hey, RJ.
You can stay.

290
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,416
Come here you big!
I knew beneath 
that hard, is crispy outside...

291
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:18,041
there's a soft, noughety center in there.

You mind if i call you Uncle Verne?

292
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:21,916
With every bone in my body.

- Great. Hey, can i walk with Hammy?

293
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:27,666
You want to help me find my nuts?
 
Very tempting, Hammy.

294
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,791
But first, I want to show you this.

295
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,791
You like this cookie?

296
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:35,166
Well this cookie is...
Junk!

297
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,875
I like the cookie.

298
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:43,916
Don't worry, I know where we can get 
some cookie
 so valuable that they are 
hand-delivered by uniformed officers.

299
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,125
And there they are, 

America's most coveted cookies.

300
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:55,125
Love-handles, Skinny-Mints,
Neener-Neeners 
and Smackeroons!

301
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,125
And guess what,
they're all yours!

302
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,541
Woah Hamilton,
hold on there fella.

303
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,541
I love your energy,
but you can't just take 'em.

304
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:04,666
But you just said they're mine.

305
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:09,916
They will be if we successfully 
marry your manic 
energy to my brilliant plan.

306
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,791
You with me kid?
- I, i, i..

307
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,541
The eyes have it, let's ride.

308
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,541
You step away from those cookies

They're mine.

309
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,750
Hey, this guy's not coming is he?

Cos i don't want him to.

310
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,916
Ohh...I've got so much work to do.

311
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:36,875
Come here, step into my office.

Now, listen up.

312
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,916
What we're going for here is a
vicious, 
man-eating, rabid squirrel.

313
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,791
Can you handle that?

- Excuse me.

314
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:44,666
Yes, Hammy.

315
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,416
Rabbits aren't vicious.

They're all cute and cuddly.

316
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,416
Rabid, not rabbit.

317
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,416
Ok, first watch the hair...

318
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:02,791
...on the tail...

319
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,625
...liking that alot.

320
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,541
Show me that look in your eye, boy! C'mon!

321
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:13,416
Oh, I can burp my ABCs!

A, B, C...

322
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:17,666
I just really need you to focus right now, ok?

323
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,416
Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.

324
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,250
Go on, get out there.
Shoo. Shoo!

325
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:46,416
I'm a crazy rabid-squirrel.

I want my cookies!

326
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,166
Rabies!

327
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,875
Hey, it's working.
- Behind you!

328
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,250
I know you're,
right behind m...

329
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,791
Walk it off,
just walk that one off.

330
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:11,541
What is going on? Is that Hammy?

- Everything's under control, 
just go back to the hedge.

331
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:14,541
You call that under control?

He's under attack!

332
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:15,541
He's working.
- I'm coming, Hammy.

333
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:40,166
Verne, that was great.

You, my friend, are a natural.

334
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:43,750
Or should I say, "all-naturale".

335
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:53,166
Hammy, you are awesome my man.

You had me scared.

336
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,666
I was about to come out
 and beat you 
with a book myself.

337
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:06,291
There! He was right over there.

- That's where the squirrel attacked us.

338
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:10,541
He has like rabies or something.

- And there was this gross, naked amphibian thing.

339
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:12,250
Reptile.

340
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:16,791
It's ok girls, go inside have a cookie,

turn on the TV and calm down.

341
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:21,666
I'm sorry Janice,
did I just hear them say 
rabid-squirrel.

342
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:25,166
Oh, I think they might just be overreacting.

- But what if they're not?

343
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:30,541
What if we have a potential pandemic on our 
hands.
Vermin running loose, spreading diseases

344
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,750
and lowering our property value.

345
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:39,000
Yea...I have casserole in the oven. 
Gotta run.
- Fine, you worry about your casserole.

346
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,541
And I'll worry about the end of Suburbia 

for peace and tranquility.

347
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:51,041
That's right, don't push, plenty for everybody.

Got a box right over here for you, Penny.

348
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:55,666
Oh jeepers, that is good, kids eat up. 

Anything that taste this good, has to be good for you.

349
00:31:55,666 --> 00:32:00,625
You feel that buzzing at the back of you skull?

That's called sugar-rush. It's what keeps the humans going.

350
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,875
That's why they don't hibernate.

To top that off, a little of this...

351
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:07,500
and what usually takes you all summer,

is only gonna take us a week.

352
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:12,875
Oh, hold on, HamSquad!
The last thing 
you need is caffeine.

353
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:20,541
That's right, come on, dig in
 because this 
my friends is just the beginning.

354
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,041
Hello, I need every business list 

that you have under 'exterminator'.

355
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,291
Can I poke him?
- No!

356
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:38,041
Debbie, I don't remember seeing a 
permit out for
 a gathering.

357
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:40,125
Groups of more than one who wish to get...AHH!

358
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:43,291
Timmy, get the shovel from the car.

359
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:51,041
Lights fading.
Limbs growing cold.

360
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:01,416
Mother, is that you?

Beckoning me into the light?

361
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,541
Must...move...
toward...the...light.

362
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:07,916
What do you think he's doing?

- Maybe we knock he's brain or something.

363
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:12,166
I'm telling you. You went to far this time.

Let's just get out of here and leave this...

364
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,250
Nice catch, Verne.

365
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,541
You're dangerous, you're insane.

366
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:25,750
Goodbye, cruel world.

367
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,541
Rose-bud.

368
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,041
Now can i poke him?
- Nooo!

369
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:44,500
U see, this is exactly why I called the 
exterminator,
to kill them, before they get hurt like this.

370
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,791
Everybody get out of here, right now.

371
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,291
Right. Ok, grab those handles.

372
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:02,416
Verminator.

373
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:28,666
I believed someone phoned about an 
animal problem.

The solution is standing before you.

374
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:33,625
Dwayne is here.
- Where have you been?

375
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:39,041
I'm throwing a 'welcome to the 
neighbourhood' party tomorrow and so far 

Debbie's car have killed more animals than you have.

376
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:46,041
Stand down sister, I personally 
guarantee 
that there will not be a living thing at this party.

377
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:49,416
Verminator is on the job.

378
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,041
Leave it.
- Ahh, what do we have here?

379
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:02,625
Didelphis marsupialis virginiananis,

approximately 10 pounds, male.

380
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:08,750
I think he's dead.

- O really, do you in fact have an associate's 
degree from Vermtech?

381
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:11,541
I think he wants you to think he's dead.

382
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:14,166
Move, move. That's it, hurry, run.

383
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,791
I certainly hope he's not in any pain.

384
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,916
Kill it!
- Thank you all for coming.

385
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,916
You were a great audience.

386
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:33,541
Alright, what am I up against here.

387
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:40,000
Possum, porcupine, skunk,
squirrel, 
racoon, amphibian.

388
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,791
Reptile.
- No, reptile...

389
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:55,666
That's what I call a superduper performance 
there fella.

- Oz! You were riveted man, you were awesome!

390
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:02,500
Dad, I guess I gotta say uhh...

That was pretty good.

391
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:07,166
Props for the Ozman!

392
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:12,666
Let's not forget our brilliant leadership, RJ.

393
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:20,291
Come this way, we want to show you something.

- Yeah, sure.

394
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,041
Sweet.

395
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,416
What a team.

396
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:35,250
Over here, this way.

- RJ, come on, we want to show you something. 
Hurry!

397
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,166
Check it out.

398
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,541
Your new home.

399
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:51,666
Look, we got a place for you right here.

- That's for me?

400
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,416
Yea, is this anything like what you had, RJ?

401
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,791
This is everything like 
what I had, Lou.

402
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:02,750
Here, I'm not supposed to drink this.

- Thanks.

403
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,125
Is that my bag?

- Yea, we brought it here so you wouldn't...

404
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,375
have to sleep up in that old tree.

405
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:14,916
Hey RJ, check this out,
we totally hooked up the TV.

406
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,916
I hotwired the HD-converter.

- We get like a thousand channels.

407
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:24,416
Here, can you take the remote before my dad does.

- Wow, universal remote.

408
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:29,250
This is nice guys.
Really nice.

409
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:34,041
We now return to
'A Scoundrel Among Us'.

410
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:38,541
You should be ashamed of yourself!

We let you into our family and you deceived us.

411
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:42,375
I give you my heart
and you ripped it 
into a million pieces.

412
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:46,000
Get real , Kevin.

Cos when you feel like a dirtbag.

413
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,625
It's because you're a dirtbag, right?

So just say it our loud, 'I am a dirtbag'.

414
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:58,041
Dirtbag? I don't think that guy is a real doctor.

What do yo think there, RJ?

415
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:08,250
Woah RJ, what are you doing man.

You're getting in way too deep.

416
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,791
Just get the food, feed the bear.

417
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,041
Where's the food?!!

418
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:30,041
Verne, what are you doing?

- I'm putting things back to the way they were.

419
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:35,291
No don't. How about if I just leave?

- Good, you leave and i return this stuff to the 
rightful owners.

420
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:39,875
What? why?!

- Because... we've angered the humans.

421
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,166
And we don't want to end up like that rabbit.

422
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:47,291
Hence, I'm giving this back,

so they won't kill us.

423
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:51,041
Verne, you don't understand.

We need this stuff.

424
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:54,041
No, we don't.
- You can't take it.

425
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:57,166
Yes I can.
- Let go.

426
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,666
You let go.
- I have to have it.

427
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:16,875
Verne, move slowly,
keep your voice 
low and follow me.

428
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:27,166
No, I'm not falling for anymore of 

your smooth talk.

429
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:31,916
Idon't knw what you're up to but, 

my whole shell is tingling...

430
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:36,791
and you know what, I'm listening to it this time.

And I'm putting my foot down.

431
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:38,791
Play?

432
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,916
Play!

433
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:03,416
Let's play.

434
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:15,291
Get down boy! Sit! Rollover!

435
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:23,541
Atta'boy Verne, save the food,

I'll lose the dog.

436
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:39,125
You're dropping all the food, man! 

Here, catch.

437
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,916
You hungry?
Look, food!

438
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,291
Look, people, play with them.

439
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:58,166
I'm alright, I'm fine.

440
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,375
Verne, unhook the chain.

441
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:30,916
Verne, I told you to unhook the chain.

442
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,416
You're the devil.

443
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:29,791
Verne, you alright there?

Give me a hand, Oz.

444
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:36,041
What the heck happened?
 
- It's gone...the food! Gone!

445
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:40,166
What? How is it gone?
- Ask...him.

446
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:46,291
I returned it to it's rightful owners.

447
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:53,250
We like, worked our tails off you know,

like alot, and the food we got was totally...you know.

448
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,041
You're like a...whatever.

449
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:59,666
What were you thinking? 
The log was full.
- Full of junk.

450
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:03,291
Ohh, so what are you saying?

That the food we gathered our way...

451
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:06,125
isn't as good as the food
we gathered your way?

452
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:10,791
Your way? You mean his way.

Can't you see RJ is just using you?

453
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:14,541
Shame on you, RJ wouldn't do that.

454
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:18,791
You have got to trust me on this.

Don't you understand there's something wrong with this guy?

455
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:22,166
My tail tingles everytime
I get near him.

456
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:25,375
So, we're supposed to go hungry
 
because your butt's vibrating?

457
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,916
I'm starting to think that the little tingle of your 
s
is just you being jealous.

458
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:34,916
Jealous? Of him?

- Yea, he's embracing the future and 
you're just holding us back.

459
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:37,791
I'm holding you back alright,
from extinction!

460
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:41,541
See what you've done here?
If 
you listen to half of the stuff you're telling them...

461
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:42,916
You'll be dead within a week!

462
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:48,166
You are only interested in taking 
advantage of them 
because they are too 
stupid and naive.

463
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm not stupid.

464
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,875
I didn't mean...
I meant ignorant.

465
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:10,625
The way's over there, come on you guys, 

you know I didn't mean it like that.

466
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:14,416
Don't do this, Stella, Ozzie.

467
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:18,666
Hammy, you know I...

468
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:24,000
Hammy?
- I'm not stupid.

469
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:15,416
Goodnight, Uncle RJ.

- Goodnight kiddo.

470
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:26,291
Moon's full, RJ.

See you in the morning.

471
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:04,041
I got ya.

472
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:13,166
Is it done?
- Affirmative.

473
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,666
And did you put this one in?

This D-Ultra-Turbo?

474
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:20,791
That's a contraband item,  Mdm.

As it is illegal in every state, except Texas.

475
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:24,791
I don't care if this thing is against 

the Geneva conventions, I want it!

476
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:29,541
I thought you might.
So, I took the liberty of  
installing it for you.

477
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:36,416
Adios, animal infestation.

478
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,666
What have I done?

479
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:03,916
I shouldn't have taken all that food.

- What?

480
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:09,375
I shouldn't have taken all that food.

I was just trying to return things to the way 
they were, that's all.

481
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,916
I was just being cautious,

cos that's what I am.

482
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:14,166
I'm naturally tentative.

483
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:17,000
There's even places in my shell 
I've haven't been.

484
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:21,875
You, on the other hand,
you're like cool, 
and crazy and fearless.

485
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,416
I think they're right,

I think I'm just jealous.

486
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:30,500
Verne, believe me,
you should 
not be jealous of me.

487
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:35,041
You've got a good thing here.

You're just trying to do what's best for your family.

488
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,791
I think you're what's best for them now.

489
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,416
What about your tail?

490
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:48,250
My head says listen to my tail, 
my tail says listen to my head.

I just end up with an upset stomach.

491
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:52,291
That's why you need to be in charge now.

- You don't really know what's going on here...

492
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:57,250
And, you do. So, what's the problem?

- This is the problem.

493
00:49:57,291 --> 00:50:00,166
See this?
- I'm listening.

494
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,291
Just, hang on a second.

495
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:09,250
Hi, uh... you're the lady throwing the party?

- Yes, just to the right.

496
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:13,166
There are protective
 
put on over your shoes.

497
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:20,916
What is this?

- What?

498
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,041
That...is a list of...
all the 
stuff that you lost, Verne.

499
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:32,791
It's a big long list.

- You're an organised little guy aren't you.

500
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:37,291
But, you know what. 
I know a place that is choked full of food.

We can get it all back in one night.

501
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:41,291
Great, Let's go. Where is it?

- Inside that house.

502
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,875
What is the point of this thing?

- Just send it down.

503
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:54,416
What Verne is trying to say is,

well it's hard to really sum it all up in just one word...

504
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,041
I'm sorry.

505
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:02,916
Come here.

- Give me a hug.

506
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:06,125
Ok listen, here is the plan.

507
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:18,916
Traps are set here, here, here, 
here, here...and here.

508
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,916
Big one here.

509
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:32,166
Maybe a few over here.

- Sheesh, is that all?

510
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:37,041
No, there's a bunch of red lights all over here.

- you ok Verne, looking a little faint.

511
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:43,166
I blacked out for a second there, 
but I get the idea.

There's lights, traps, I think i need to change my shell.

512
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:46,416
Ok, this is us. 

- Can I be the car?

513
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:49,416
I wanna be the car.

- No, I'm the car! You be the shoes.

514
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:53,541
Shoe is lame.
Why don't you be that 
snazzy lokking iron there.

515
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:57,916
Hey, it's not important.

Besides I'm the car, I'm always the car.

516
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:01,791
Now the plan works in 3 simple steps:

Step one: Clear the lights.

517
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:05,875
Step Two: Get inside.

Step Three: Get out with a mountain of food.

518
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,666
This place is like a fortress, walls so high,

doors impenetrable.

519
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:13,791
How do we get in?

- The collar is the key.

520
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:19,416
Literally, the collar is like
 
a key that opens the door...

521
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:25,000
and what, you think he's just gonna 
hand over his collar to you?

- Not to me my femme fatale...to you.

522
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,291
Her?

- Me?

523
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:31,125
You Stella, we'll get that cat to give 
you that collar by using...
- My stink.

524
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:33,041
Your feminine charm.

525
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,916
Was that out loud?

526
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:44,041
Look racoon, maybe that ass 
you're wearing is obstructing your view, 
but if you haven't notice, I'm a skunk.

527
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:50,666
Outside maybe, but I'm looking inside Stella, a
nd i see 
a fox. All we gotta do is get her out.

528
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,291
Scissors.
- Scissors?!

529
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:00,541
Charcoal.
- Charcoal?

530
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:04,166
Air freshener.
- Tomato juice.

531
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:06,500
Cork.

- Cork? Don't you dare.

532
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,291
Alright we scored! Yeah!

533
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:19,250
One more thing.

Woah stop. That's it.

534
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:23,791
Ladies and gentlemen, 
our work here is done.

535
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:30,666
Big jeepers.

- She's all like...wow!

536
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:58,000
Alright gang, this is it. We're going in.

537
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:12,750
Oh, not again. 
Damn it, those things are so life-like.

Curse you, plastic mouldsmen.

538
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:53,625
Go, go, go.

539
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:56,541
No, no, no...No!

540
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:01,875
Hammy, I told you that cookie's junk
.
- I love the cookie.

541
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:06,666
What's going on?
Is everything ok?

542
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:17,416
Here we go.

Come on Hammy, follow the red light.

543
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:24,000
That's it, that's it.
There it is. 
Go and get it.

544
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:35,666
Go get it, you little nut.

545
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:39,625
Bingo!
Ok, step two.

546
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:42,916
I thought we'd be dead by step two
 
so this is going great!

547
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:48,041
Ok, gorgeous. You're on.

548
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:55,166
Man...This better be one stupid cat.

- Audio, go!

549
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:03,041
She must be a cat. Turn it on cat. 

Let's hope the cat likes a cow.

550
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:05,125
Who goes there?

551
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:08,291
You're a cat.
- You're a cat.

552
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:11,541
Uhh, I mean I'm a cat.

553
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:19,791
Ya, I know, shoo, go, get away from 
here.
My owner those not give scraps
to common strays.

554
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:22,625
Common strays?

- Alright, you asked for it...

555
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:27,250
Gee, that's a nice collar you got on.

- Mind if I have a look?

556
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,666
No, come no closer. I must not be so near
 
a creature of the outdoor woods.

557
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:38,166
Away with your filth.

- My filth? My filth?!

558
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:39,166
Here we go.

559
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:45,791
I'm sick and tired of everybody 
taking one look at me
and running 
away cos they think I'm filthy.

560
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:53,416
Well, I got news for you, I din't get all 
prim and preen
to have some 
overfed papa's puff ball tell me he's too good for me.

561
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:57,916
I got make-up on my butt, dude.

And you don't even wanna know about the cork.

562
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:02,291
Stop, no one has ever spoken to me like that.

563
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:07,791
It's bold. I like it.

564
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:14,916
Well believe me, there's more 
where that came from,
puffball.

565
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:20,125
Alright team, let's boogie.

- Your essence is over-powering.

566
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,416
What do you mean by that?

- It is your eyes.

567
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:29,791
They are luminous.

- Luminous? Damn.

568
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,375
You know, this is the part where 
I blacked out.

Do the little shoes and cars actually get into the house?

569
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:43,291
So, you got a name?

- Yes, it's a persian name of cos, I am persian.

570
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:50,875
I was born, Prince Tigerias Mammoeth Shabbas.

- Ooh, that's a mouthful. Can I just call you Tiger?

571
00:57:56,625 --> 00:58:00,416
Animals we're in the house.

572
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:19,041
Ok, stations everybody. Let's boogie.

573
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:21,041
No grip, no grip, no grip.

574
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,375
Hammy, that's called a warpath.

575
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:28,416
That hurt.

576
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:42,875
What is that?

- That's just the sound of my heart. 
Can't you hear it?

577
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:51,166
This way, this way.

578
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:59,750
Ok, we're good.

Go back to work.

579
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:18,666
Yes, we're gonna make it.

- My father, he had an exceptionaly flat face.

580
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:23,375
It was so beautiful, he could barely breathe.

- Fascinating.

581
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:28,750
Inside we have a multi-level, climbing,
tri-carpet, 
come, I'll show you.

582
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:31,000
No! I haven't told you about
 my life.

583
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:33,541
Good, good. Going great.

584
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:39,041
What is that?
- That is what get the 
humans out of bed in the morning.

585
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:45,041
Where'd she go?

- Get down, stay down.

586
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:15,500
Come on, we gotta go
 before she comes back.

587
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:19,791
No, not without those Spuddies.

- What?

588
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:23,375
Lou, Penny, check the TV.
Heather, 
keep an eye on that human.

589
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:25,416
I'm on it, RJ.
- No, Heather, wait.

590
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:30,375
The tingle.
Hey RJ, the wagon's full. 
Let's get out of here.

591
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:33,166
Hang on Vincent. 
This'll only take a second.

- Vincent?

592
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,166
Where?

- Whose Vincent?

593
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:38,666
Ohh..Verne, Vincent. 
Simple slip of the bear.
The tongue!

594
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:42,750
Uhh, just bare with me, is what I meant to say.

595
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:45,791
There's no bear.

596
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:52,291
Lights fading, limbs growing...

597
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:10,125
There's a dead white rat on my staircase.

598
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:18,041
I thought you were dead.

- I learnt from the best dad.

599
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:20,250
That's my girl.

600
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:24,625
Come to papa.
- We gotta hurry. 
We don't have much time.

601
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:26,666
What's going on, RJ?
- Nothing.

602
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:30,000
Well then, let's get out of 
here cos we have what we need.

- No we don't.

603
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:32,500
What are you talking about,
we 
have more then enough!

604
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:36,666
Listen, I have about this small to hand over 

that wagon load of food to a homicidal bear.

605
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:41,000
And this Spuddies are on the menu,
or I will be. 
Now, let go off my tail.

606
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:44,791
What?
- Let go.

607
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:56,000
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

- Stella, Stella...where are you going?

608
01:02:04,541 --> 01:02:10,750
Look, it's not you, it won't work ok. 
Because I'm a...
- Skunk!!!

609
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:14,291
Yea, that.
Sorry you have to see this...

610
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:15,541
Fire-in-the-hole!

611
01:02:22,916 --> 01:02:27,500
This smell doesn't bother you?

- No, this face was meant for beauty.

612
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:32,041
I cannot smell a thing.

- You can't smell.

613
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:41,416
To the door. Go, go, go.

614
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,666
Run!
-This way.

615
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:51,500
Let's party.
Party!

616
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:55,041
Flee, my love!

617
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:59,250
Run!
That way. Outside.

618
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:07,791
Buenos días, reptile.

619
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:15,875
You've just been, verminated.

620
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:22,000
Woah, you stink.

- That's because you let them into my, house...

621
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:28,750
Stop your honking.

This little guys will be disposed off 
quickly and humanely.

622
01:03:28,791 --> 01:03:32,750
Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.

623
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,166
It was a pleasure, 
doing business with you, mdm.

624
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:59,166
What's he gonna do to us, mama?

- I don't know.

625
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:06,750
I don't wanna die, dad. Not for real.

- There, there, we'll be ok.

626
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:16,416
You were right about him, Verne.

We should have listened, sorry there.

627
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,666
I knew we couldn't trust him.

628
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:26,625
I got us into this,

I should have known better.

629
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:43,500
So, I was on my way down to kill you.

But, I stopped to watch the show and I have to say..

630
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:50,375
...that, right there, is a thing of beauty.

631
01:04:52,041 --> 01:05:02,291
That is the most vicious, deceitful, s
elf-serving
thing, I've ever seen. Classy, RJ.

632
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:07,416
You take the food, and they take the fall.

633
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:17,625
You keep this up, you're gonna end up 
just like me.
Having everything you ever wanted.

634
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:22,791
But, I already had that.

- What? Them?

635
01:05:22,916 --> 01:05:28,041
Who're you kidding? 
You said it yourself.
You're a family of one.

636
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:32,916
Always will be.
It's how guys like you and me survive.

637
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:38,291
So, a few saps got hurt in the process,
that's life.

638
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:41,125
Trust me, you don't need them.

639
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:46,625
Actually, I do.

640
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:51,666
And right now, they really need me.

641
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:54,375
So, I really need this.

642
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:13,416
There goes the bag again.

- Are you ok?

643
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:24,166
You, sorry...

- Woah, Stella, this is a rescue. 
I'm rescuing you.

644
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:27,416
I'm gonna gas you so hard,

your grandchildren will stink.

645
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:30,000
What's that?
Hair?

646
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:31,375
Ear?

647
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:33,791
Ohh, bear!

648
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:48,541
We can drive!

- It's just like, Auto Homicide 3.

649
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:57,791
Let me in.
Verkeerde knopje!

650
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:00,541
Please, select destination.

651
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:03,500
Take us home!
Take us to the log.

652
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:06,916
Previous destination selected.

Make a legal U-turn.

653
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:15,666
Hammy, let me in!

- Not listening to RJ. Lalalalaa....

654
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:19,416
Kids! Lose that bear!

- What weapons do we have?

655
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:22,291
We've got a hammer.

- Cool.

656
01:07:27,666 --> 01:07:29,166
Thank you. Yes, yes..

657
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:34,500
Let me in.

- No, ringtailed saboteur.

658
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:37,416
He's just trying to help, just let him in.

- After what he did to us?!

659
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:41,625
But he came back.

- And he brought a bear.

660
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:50,166
Hey, no fighting while we're driving.

- We will turn this van around if you don't stop.

661
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:53,916
He started it.
- I'm telling you, he's just trying to help us.

662
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
But Verne, you're the one who 
always say trust your tail.

- But, it's not tingling.

663
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:02,125
Why din't you say so.

664
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:09,750
You're dead, RJ.

665
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:12,291
And your friends are next.

666
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,291
Look out.

667
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:17,166
Make an immediate left turn.

668
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:21,666
Bonus points!

669
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:43,291
High score!

670
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:05,916
You have arrived.

671
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:18,875
Come on, we gotta go.

- Die oude Jazz-dance blessure.

672
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:34,875
Lou? Penny? The kids here? 
Hammy?
- Big clown.

673
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:53,416
A weed-hacker!

674
01:09:56,416 --> 01:10:03,666
Show your little rat faces.

Stay in the woods where you belong!

675
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:14,125
You guys wanna party, do you?

Alright then, let's party.

676
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:22,041
Kids!
Hey, Lou, look out. Down!

677
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Dat is de druppel!
Verne, 
get everybody out of here.

678
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:29,625
I'll distract him.

- Are you crazy? They'll kill you.

679
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:32,375
Look, I'm the one he wants.

Just take care of your family, Verne.

680
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:36,250
I intend to, whole family.

There's gotta be something we can do.

681
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,375
There's no time!

682
01:10:47,416 --> 01:10:53,541
Hey Vincent, you were right.

With a Spuddie enough, just isn't enough.

683
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,750
Now Hammy, go, go.

684
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:28,875
- That's the...
- The D-Pelter Turbo, 
prepare for alot of stinging.

685
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:11,500
You are a genius, my boy

- Ohh, Thank..youu...

686
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:18,666
And Verne, don't you ever fix this shell.

- Yea, glad it's working for you.

687
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:20,750
Take it off. Give it back.

688
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:24,375
Here we go,
it's the rockies for you, Smokey.

689
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:30,416
U do realise that is a D-Pelter Turbo?

- Officer, please, it was that verminator. He sold it to me.

690
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:33,541
This has nothing to do with me.

- Hey, it was in your yard...

691
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:36,416
your name is written on the contract,

so you can tell it to the judge.

692
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,166
No, it's not my fault. 
Let go of me.
I can't be arrested.

693
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,000
I'm president of the Homeowners Association.

694
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:45,625
She's getting away.

695
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:56,416
Play?

696
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:10,916
Over here, Tiger.

697
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:19,041
So this is the outdoor woods?

I like it.

698
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:29,416
You know RJ, just for the record.

If you told us that all that food you were trying to get is to pay back an angry bear.

699
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:34,166
We would have given it to you. 
- Really?
Yeah, that's what families do.

700
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:38,916
They look out for each other.

- I've never really had anything like that.

701
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:44,875
Believe me, this is the gateway.

This is the gateway to the good life.

702
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:49,375
Really wish you would have told me that sooner.

- Yeah, well, that's bad communication.

703
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:53,916
It's, also what families do.
So, 
what do you say? Wanna be part of it?

704
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:00,291
Come here.

705
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:08,291
Welcome to the family.

- Grouphug.

706
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:13,875
What a first week of spring.

Wait a minute...

707
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,541
that means there's only 

267 days left till winter.

708
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:18,291
What we gonna do for food?

709
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:22,500
Yes, Hammy.

710
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:24,041
I filled the log.

711
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:42,041
Look! Look! I found my nuts!!
