1
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:26,630
Meet me at the Zygmunt tillar.

2
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:20,109
Better be worth it.

3
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:26,222
-Too cold for false alarms.
-lt's too cold for ice cubes.

4
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:32,092
Apparently,
we've intercepted a conduit.

5
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:36,696
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

6
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:55,916
Now....

7
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:04,596
-Don't!
-Where is the package?

8
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,962
-l don't know.
-Dunois, does he have it?

9
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:10,130
No.

10
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,138
Where's the package?

11
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:22,147
l promise you, whoever you're
protecting is sitting in a warm room...

12
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:26,241
...without the slightest concern
for your well-being.

13
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:32,252
You are too late, Mr. Olyphant.

14
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,596
lt's already...

15
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:39,857
...been delivered.

16
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:45,537
l can't tell you how disappointed
l am to hear that.

17
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:51,076
l'll give you 1 0 seconds
to tell me who to.

18
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:58,783
-Ten, nine, eight, seven...
-Please, no! You are too late.

19
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:02,683
...six, five, four...

20
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:05,655
-...three, two....
-lt's dangerous.

21
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:09,091
-What?
-The truth.

22
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:23,674
He knew you, Jared.
l thought you were anonymous.

23
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,870
-l am now.
-The rules are changing.

24
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:30,141
Our client has an aversion
to rising death tolls.

25
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:34,219
His reputation is already called
into question, which means...

26
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:37,084
...close associates could be next.

27
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:41,057
The only aversion our client has
is to failure.

28
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:45,722
As for reputations, you two
were hired to intercept that package...

29
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,766
...not some monkey with a death wish.

30
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:52,999
My assignment was to eliminate
any source of knowledge.

31
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:56,767
-l guess l just did your job for you.
-Really?

32
00:04:56,943 --> 00:05:00,777
-We'll get the package.
-l hope so.

33
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:04,940
l'm beginning to think you're getting
out of your depth here.

34
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:08,281
l want the package
delivered by Friday.

35
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:12,854
l suggest you hire a professional.

36
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:31,140
-Jonathan, are you okay?
-Yeah, don't worry about it. l'll be fine.

37
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:36,941
-Who was it?
-Warsaw.

38
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:38,982
Do l know her?

39
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:42,144
lf l'm not jealous,
you don't need to be.

40
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:45,814
lf you really love me,
you'd be jealous.

41
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:52,665
lt was a nice try anyway.

42
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:56,192
Nice try.

43
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:09,171
-Yeah.
-Hey, Jon. Coming for the service?

44
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,113
Hey, Sean. Yeah.
Soon as l can get a flight.

45
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:16,382
-What time do you think you'll be here ?
-What time's the memorial?

46
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,750
3:00 p.m.
Dad would've wanted you to come.

47
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:23,294
l'll be there, Sean.
l said l'd be there.

48
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,863
Fine.

49
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:44,015
Hello. Please, take a seat.

50
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:54,085
-You sure you won't eat?
-No, l'm in a hurry. Gotta go.

51
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:58,960
l've wondered over the last six months
if you've enjoyed Paris at all.

52
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,996
-What shall l do without you?
-l think you'll manage just fine.

53
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:11,475
Manage? To find another friend?
And one who comes through each time?

54
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:15,805
-They don't fall from the sky.
-Well, you have Dunois.

55
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:21,251
Yes, Dunois. Quite useful when the
most resolute measures are required.

56
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:27,823
What is this?

57
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,795
-Persuasion.
-For what?

58
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:35,196
-One final favor.
-l told you l gotta go.

59
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:40,135
A small favor. l want you to pick up
a package and deliver it to Germany.

60
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:43,208
Following your personal affairs,
of course.

61
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:46,312
The patron's address is on the back.

62
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,216
-Convenient for you?
-l don't want to get involved.

63
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:59,018
The package is at Versailles.
Dunois will accompany you.

64
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:02,958
Two Russians brought it from Athens.
Neither speak French.

65
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:08,124
They're holding it at a farm. You need
only collect it from them. Simple.

66
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:12,130
lf it's so simple,
why don't we all just meet in Paris?

67
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:15,207
Apparently, they're afraid to.

68
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:54,572
-How long to Versailles?
-We'll be there when the car stops.

69
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:58,146
-Well, l wasn't asking you.
-An hour, maybe less.

70
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:03,113
Marquet tells me you're leaving.
l'm sorry to hear that.

71
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:07,625
What you two had in common
remains a mystery.

72
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,589
l'd say we had ethics in common.

73
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:29,409
Relax. lt's one of Marquet's
safe houses. His aunt's farm.

74
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,483
You can always wait here.

75
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:35,076
When we're inside,
move the car up to the house.

76
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:53,169
Now listen to me.
l know Alex sent you...

77
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:55,501
...but we're gonna do this my way.

78
00:09:55,642 --> 00:10:01,080
Get your gun out and hide it.
Take the left side. Don't say a word.

79
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:02,545
Okay.

80
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,690
Alex sent me.

81
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:36,311
Gentlemen. You know why l'm here?

82
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:39,451
l understand you have
something for me?

83
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:41,143
What is it?

84
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,186
Their tongues are cut out.

85
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,484
ls that the package?

86
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:51,722
l think this may be it, Dunois.

87
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:43,307
lt's clear! Let's go!

88
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:14,236
Okay. Go over to this farmhouse
with the lights right here.

89
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:32,391
Who were they?

90
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:36,092
-l don't know, but they spoke Danish.
-Sons of bitches.

91
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:41,434
-Let's see what they were willing to die for.
-You don't wanna do that.

92
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:49,340
Don't do that. lf you touch it again,
l will blow your 2-inch dick off.

93
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:56,650
You wanna open the package, do it with
Marquet's permission after we go back.

94
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,488
-We're gonna go back to Marquet?
-Yeah.

95
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,618
-What if he's involved?
-What if you're involved?

96
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:55,707
-What's all this?
-A silly precaution, l assure you.

97
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:59,511
-Perhaps you could wait.
-No, l've gotta catch a plane.

98
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:04,419
-Then l think you forgot something?
-Are you thinking of trying to stop me?

99
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:09,923
-Be reasonable. We had an arrangement.
-l don't risk my life for deliveries...

100
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:13,164
...particularly when
others don't share the risk.

101
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:16,268
The job isn't finished.

102
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:21,270
-Find yourself a new delivery boy.
-Think about it for a moment.

103
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:26,441
-Nobody wants you to miss your flight.
-Are you threatening me?

104
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:33,375
No, of course not. l just want
a conversation. Little drink.

105
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,545
-Talk through what transpired.
-Please.

106
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:39,419
Conversation. Remember...

107
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,359
...that's what we pay you for.
To talk to people.

108
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,589
Do me a favor. Talk to my friend.

109
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:51,726
Fucking ambush. Three, four of them.
Came in like the mist.

110
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:54,969
-We never heard them.
-Who were they?

111
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,533
Danish.

112
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:00,537
-Yeah, they were Danes.
-ldentification?

113
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,705
l didn't stick around to check.

114
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:05,612
Suddenly the whole place is on fire.

115
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:11,453
-There was a fire?
-Yeah. Your aunt's safe.

116
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:14,889
-l saw to that myself.
-Did you open the package?

117
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:16,320
No.

118
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:19,362
Then we're all agreed
that this was unexpected.

119
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:22,865
The only thing that's unexpected
is that l'm still alive.

120
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:26,802
-You were hired to deliver the package.
-Which was already there.

121
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:31,308
You're suggesting someone's working
the periphery. Are you implying it's me?

122
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:34,936
No, l just think maybe you're
being played as a scapegoat.

123
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:36,776
Suggestions?

124
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,682
l wouldn't trust anything
but the zeros on the bills.

125
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:43,447
Let me take care of this, Alex.

126
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:47,226
l'll deal with them personally.

127
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:51,328
Give me a moment. Please.

128
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:00,864
Please, sit.

129
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:05,601
l need a favor from someone l trust.

130
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:10,406
Will you deliver the package
to the agreed address?

131
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:13,375
The patron's waiting.

132
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:17,586
Okay.

133
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,995
Thank you. When you arrive in Warsaw...

134
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:28,926
...take my condolences to you
and your family.

135
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,920
Surprised you're here.
Thought you'd at least be incognito.

136
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:54,458
l got nothing to hide.

137
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:57,955
Here to take me to the services
with your escort?

138
00:16:58,097 --> 00:16:59,928
Just want to talk.

139
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:03,797
Took time finding you. Thought you
were in South America.

140
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:09,533
l wouldn't think Paris suits you. The city
of decadence? Or maybe that's the point.

141
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,576
The last place on earth
you'd find Jonathan Cold.

142
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:14,703
Congratulations.

143
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:20,109
Your father died of natural causes,
in case you wonder.

144
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:26,051
Taking this ambassadorship wasn't easy
for him, but he's always admired the Polish.

145
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,486
l know he wanted you on the team.

146
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:32,757
Do you think training terrorists
in Pakistan was a team effort?

147
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:37,392
You think there is more honor in
hiring out what we train you to do...

148
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,004
...to a foreign operative
with a checkbook.

149
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,369
l fail to see the difference.

150
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:45,477
ln most countries,
you'd be killed for it.

151
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:47,374
-Asshole.
-Watch your mouth.

152
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:51,074
You're good at what you do.
Your father made the mold.

153
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:56,480
A lot's changed. You've seen it. Help
tip the balance. Keep us informed.

154
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:59,455
-Ally and adversary.
-Call it what you will.

155
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:02,584
-You're an asshole.
-l beg your pardon?

156
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:13,735
Let him go.

157
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:24,506
Left, right, left.

158
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,743
Detail, halt.

159
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,588
About face.

160
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:36,687
Forward march.
Left, right, left. Left, right, left.

161
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,870
Detail, halt.

162
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,038
Jackson Cold will have a monument
on the lawns of Arlington Cemetery.

163
00:18:56,182 --> 00:19:00,118
We're giving him a memorial
here in Poland...

164
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:05,186
...on the soil of the country he defended
so resolutely during his lifetime...

165
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:11,487
...before we return him to his native
soil, to the country he loved so dearly.

166
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,694
Jackson was a citizen,
colleague, father, friend...

167
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:21,739
...but only wanted to be
remembered for what he considered...

168
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:24,672
...his life's achievement:
his family.

169
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,008
His devoted sons, Jonathan and Sean.

170
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:33,744
And so as we prepare
to send him home...

171
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:40,052
...let us pause to honor the legacy of
a soldier who will never be forgotten.

172
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:06,542
-Hey.
-Hey.

173
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:10,144
-Beautiful place, man. l love this.
-Thanks.

174
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,849
-You all right?
-Yeah.

175
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,927
-Drink?
-Yes, sir. Love one.

176
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:20,521
-Missed your flight?
-Standby. You're at everybody's mercy.

177
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:24,962
How long you been in Poland for?

178
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:26,570
-Six months.
-Yeah?

179
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:29,105
Dad asked me to come work for him.

180
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:36,308
So l'm hoping you'll get a little bit
better theater than Warsaw...

181
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,914
...because you know me, man.
l been there.

182
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:43,078
l have to ready Dad's office
for transition.

183
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:49,058
-Dad had a lot of friends, people he--
-Made promises to that you gotta keep.

184
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:53,326
Not everything's a fucking conspiracy,
Jon.

185
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:59,536
l mean, there are people in the world
who do things for the right reasons.

186
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:02,697
That's true,
just not very often in our business.

187
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:07,801
lt's funny, how we all ended up
in Europe.

188
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:13,841
This funeral's as close as we're
ever gonna come to a family reunion.

189
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:19,149
-You staying?
-No, l gotta go to Germany.

190
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:21,657
-Then what?
-Back to France, l guess.

191
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,594
Do you have a cell phone? Tracking you
became a matter of national security.

192
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:32,761
l'll tell you what. l'll shoot you a
number as soon as l touch ground.

193
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:36,636
-Great to see you, little brother.
-Good to see you too.

194
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:59,027
You've reached the Van Akens.
Sorry we can't take your call.

195
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:01,997
Ifyou leave your number,
we'll get back to you.

196
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:04,859
Thank you, and have a good day.

197
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:18,808
Schoolgirls.

198
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:44,040
Marquet wants to see you right now.

199
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:47,907
Can't you see l'm having an espresso?

200
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:52,381
-You're welcome to join me.
-The man said, ''Now.''

201
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:54,310
Nice toys.

202
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:58,717
You heard us.

203
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:05,029
All right. lf you insist.
Can l just pay my bill?

204
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:18,766
Hold it.

205
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,455
l'm glad you came.

206
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:47,760
-You can leave us.
-We'll be right outside.

207
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,926
Ever since our incident...

208
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:55,096
...l've insisted on expanded security.

209
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:57,469
You can never be too careful.

210
00:24:57,776 --> 00:25:00,301
-Wine?
-Love some.

211
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:04,146
l've been meaning to talk with you.

212
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:06,781
ls that so?

213
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:11,784
My manners. Please, sit.

214
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,388
lt concerns your interlude
with Mr. Cold.

215
00:25:19,531 --> 00:25:22,398
Were you aware he recognized
the assailant?

216
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:28,131
-l wasn't.
-Coincidence, or something else?

217
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:31,032
Neither, in my view.

218
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:37,939
Do you recall his assessment
before leaving here?

219
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:43,817
lnciting conspiracy
is a very dangerous business.

220
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:48,015
Mr. Cold has a thing for conspiracies.

221
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,524
But l doubt he'd set us up.

222
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,863
-lt's not his style.
-No. Of course, you're right.

223
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:02,864
l'm always right.
ls this why you called to see me?

224
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:07,034
lt's a troubling thought,
don't you agree? Someone so close...

225
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:11,376
...taking advantage,
exposing you to a point of weakness.

226
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:18,519
Check with me tomorrow. l have an errand
in Majorca and need someone l can trust.

227
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,625
Shall l send you?

228
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:28,563
Yeah.

229
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:33,395
Dunois, one more thing. How did you
know l wanted to see you?

230
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,241
-Hello?
-Yeah, is your daddy in?

231
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:48,876
Mommy?

232
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:54,058
-Hello, can l help you?
-ls Mr. Van Aken in?

233
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:56,160
No. Can l take a message?

234
00:26:56,295 --> 00:27:00,254
-Do you know when you expect him?
-l'm not sure. May l ask who's calling?

235
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:02,629
No, thanks. l'll call back later.

236
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:09,998
-May l help you?
-Yeah, can l get a room here?

237
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:14,236
-Sure. 40 euros, please.
-You heard of Jerome Van Aken?

238
00:27:14,413 --> 00:27:18,372
-Of course. Who hasn't?
-l'm sorry. l'm not from around here.

239
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,677
You don't have to be.

240
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:32,658
-Hello?
-Yeah, l need to ask you a question.

241
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:35,559
-Sure.
-You ever heard of Jerome Van Aken?

242
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:39,465
Yeah. Wealthy Euro-industrialist.
Old-money rich.

243
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:41,071
What else?

244
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:46,410
Jerome Van Aken. Well, he's about
as high-profile as they come.

245
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:51,445
He buys little contracts, builds them up
and then sells them for lots of money...

246
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:55,576
...to avoid running them. They call him
''the Viking with the Midas touch.''

247
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:58,222
Married nine years to a Meredith Casey?

248
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:01,520
-l have no idea.
-All right, thanks.

249
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:13,635
You've reached the Van Akens.
Sorry we can't take your call--

250
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:42,599
Hey! What are you doing?
That's my car.

251
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:44,736
Hey! Hey!

252
00:28:57,215 --> 00:28:59,183
Bon voyage, mate.

253
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,825
-You heard of Jerome Van Aken?
-Yeah.

254
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,724
Wealthy Euro-industrialist.
Old-money rich.

255
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:18,400
-Married nine years to a Meredith Casey?
-I have no idea.

256
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,333
All right, thanks.

257
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:27,371
-Why is he asking about Meredith?
-Guy does his research.

258
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:31,073
Doesn't like surprises.
A stickler for detail.

259
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:33,774
That's what l get from his profile.

260
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:36,486
Maybe he finds her attractive.

261
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:38,782
Think he knows?

262
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:41,183
Well, he's in Germany.

263
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:50,258
l let that little prick have a chance.
Then l let him walk away.

264
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:53,370
So, what's the protocol here,
Mr. Olyphant?

265
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:58,368
-Contact Van Aken?
-Absolutely not.

266
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,771
l want you to eliminate Mr. Cold.

267
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:11,178
Not to get anywhere near Van Aken
or his family.

268
00:30:11,523 --> 00:30:14,424
You understand me, Mr. Mimms?

269
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:21,098
l want Jonathan Cold an empty folder
in Langley by noon tomorrow.

270
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:38,139
-Yes?
-Yeah, I'm here to see Mr. Van Aken.

271
00:30:38,316 --> 00:30:40,216
l'll send someone down.

272
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:42,848
May l help you?

273
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:45,679
Yeah, l have a message
for Mr. Van Aken.

274
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:50,694
-And who are you?
-l'm an old friend.

275
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:56,220
-Yeah.
-Hello, this is Meredith Van Aken.

276
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:58,259
-Do you know who l am?
-Yes.

277
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:01,923
l'm calling on my husband's behalf.
He's in London.

278
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:03,496
-Mr...?
-Webber.

279
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:07,537
He was wondering if we
could send someone for the delivery.

280
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:12,473
-l was asked to deliver it personally.
-What if l were to come for it?

281
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:14,738
-Could you meet me?
-When?

282
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:17,711
-Well, today if it's convenient.
-Where?

283
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:24,378
There's a train station on Freudstrasse
a few kilometers outside Terminus.

284
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:27,218
-Do you know where it is?
-No, but l can find it.

285
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,327
-Shall we say in an hour?
-Let's say in an hour.

286
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:36,526
l'll be in a white Rolls at the south
side of the station. l'll see you then.

287
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,226
Thank you very much, Mr. Webber.

288
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:51,371
Thank you for meeting me, Mr. Webber.
l hope it wasn't inconvenient.

289
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,045
ls that it?

290
00:32:58,256 --> 00:32:59,985
Thank you, Mr. Webber.

291
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,741
This is for your trouble.

292
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,291
What the hell happened here?

293
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:59,782
Take deep breaths.

294
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:06,357
Try and hold one in.
Let it out slowly.

295
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:10,587
Feel that sharp pain
in the back of your neck?

296
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:12,924
That's centralized swelling.

297
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:17,694
Blood's unable to circulate properly
to your brain because of the clog.

298
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:21,067
You'll have a headache
for the next few minutes.

299
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:29,673
Within those few minutes, you are
to tell me where the real package is.

300
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:36,409
Or, l assure you, that headache will be
the least of your pains, Mr. Webber.

301
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:41,719
Which Van Aken do you work for?
Meredith or Jerome?

302
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:45,419
Mr. Webber, you're a funny man.

303
00:34:46,164 --> 00:34:49,031
More than just a simple errand boy.

304
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:53,126
You seem to have taken
an active interest in my employer.

305
00:34:53,438 --> 00:34:56,703
-Now, l wonder why that is.
-Are you the boyfriend?

306
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:59,833
What l am
is inconsequential to this moment.

307
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:02,104
Right now, all that is important...

308
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:06,976
...is for you to tell me
where the real package is.

309
00:35:07,152 --> 00:35:11,680
-ln the next four-and-a-half minutes.
-Couldn't you find it yourself?

310
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:17,552
Perhaps l'm being vague.
So let me clarify.

311
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,829
Asphyxiation is the process by which
air is shut off to the lungs...

312
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:26,835
...thereby cutting off oxygen
to the brain.

313
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:33,035
And when the brain dies, Mr. Webber,
well, then, what's the point?

314
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:36,874
Now, before you let that happen...

315
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:41,782
...why not use what little brain matter
you've apparently been given...

316
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,047
...to make an informed decision?

317
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:48,123
We can pawn it together.
We're not the only ones who want this.

318
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:52,021
Unless you grew tits and looked
like Venus de Milo...

319
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:54,688
...why in bloody hell would l do that?

320
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:58,962
Deception begets deception
begets deception, Mr. Webber.

321
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:03,062
Without end.
Plainly, it's bad business.

322
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,768
-l know a lot of people--
-One minute!

323
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,244
-lt's not here, but l've got it.
-45 fucking seconds, yeah?

324
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:15,542
Tell me where it is, or l put the first
of three bullet holes in your face.

325
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,087
Okay. l have it in a locker...

326
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:22,625
...in an overnight train station.
l'll take you there.

327
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:27,023
Lovely.

328
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:31,197
Where's the fucking key?

329
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:33,902
ln my right front pocket here.

330
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:40,635
Smart move, Mr. Webber.

331
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:43,679
You better hope that package is there.

332
00:36:45,984 --> 00:36:48,248
Don't fuck me about, mate.

333
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:52,847
Move your fucking ass!

334
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:55,818
Moment of truth, Mr. Webber.

335
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,019
Two sets of closure wait.

336
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:00,687
So open it. Slowly.

337
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:04,598
No puckering around,
or l'll blow your bleeding spine in two.

338
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:08,194
Just like you say, nice and easy.

339
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:28,021
Where you going?

340
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:31,953
What do you think l'm doing?

341
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:34,755
Easy.

342
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:38,199
Easy!

343
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:25,747
-Richard?
-Guess again.

344
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:28,579
You want some advice?
Send them in pairs.

345
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,621
Ifyou want to leave an impression
or a body, two are better.

346
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:33,781
Especially when you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

347
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,324
Mr. Webber, whatever
your estimation of me...

348
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:40,621
...the least l am is naive.
Do you honestly believe l'd send--?

349
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:45,292
Naivete is not what I'd accuse you of.
Arrogance comes to mind.

350
00:38:45,637 --> 00:38:48,401
I wonder what your husband
thinks, sending your lover...

351
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:51,266
-...to collect what he's expecting.
-Lover?

352
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:55,209
Mr. Webber, you truly are misinformed.
Richard works--

353
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,337
-Worked.
-For my husband...

354
00:38:57,649 --> 00:39:02,348
...and was sent at his request when l told
him about your magical package trick.

355
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:07,023
You know what l think? Your husband
doesn't know anything about this.

356
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,786
So, Mrs. Van Aken,
l called to inform you...

357
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:13,192
...that sending someone to kill me
was your last mistake.

358
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:15,322
Mr. Webber?

359
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:21,899
An explosion has erupted
from a faulty gas line--

360
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,067
Come on, look, look! What's going on?
Hurry! Hurry, come on!

361
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:29,977
Heinrichs, help me, help me!

362
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:33,117
The explosion happened
at 1 :32 a.m.

363
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,343
That's bullshit.

364
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:37,780
He must've lit a pipe bomb
with that kind of trajectory.

365
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:41,881
Why the fuck would he wanna
distress the local climate?

366
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:45,156
Not unless he had to.

367
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:49,397
Well, all right.
l'm gonna have some fun.

368
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:07,177
Good morning.

369
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:10,081
-Welcome to the Hotel Terminus.
-Thank you.

370
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:13,816
-You're welcome.
-l'd like a room for the night.

371
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:18,925
And would you prefer two single
beds or one double, Mr...?

372
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:22,123
-Cold?
-One double should be plenty, dear.

373
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,699
Certainly.

374
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,402
All clear.

375
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:10,371
Hi.

376
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:13,068
-How are you?
-Fine, thank you. And you, sir?

377
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:16,577
Well, l'd be much better
if l could find my friend.

378
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:20,009
He forgot to leave me
his room number.

379
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:25,214
-What's the gentleman's name?
-Cold. Jonathan Cold.

380
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:31,055
lf l don't find him soon, he'll be
missing a very important conference.

381
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:36,428
Mr. Cold? l checked
a Mr. Cold in this morning.

382
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:39,832
Wonderful. What is his room number?

383
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:42,963
l'm sorry, sir. l cannot tell you.
Hotel policy.

384
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:46,133
No, no. Of course not.

385
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:50,304
-Perhaps you could call.
-No problem.

386
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:09,933
l'm sorry. There's nothing else
l can do but take a message.

387
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:13,659
Hello?

388
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:20,439
-Thank you all the same.
-You're welcome.

389
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:29,009
Feeling lucky?

390
00:45:29,373 --> 00:45:31,534
Do you know who l am?

391
00:45:32,643 --> 00:45:34,736
l didn't think so.

392
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:37,037
Mr. Webber?

393
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:40,015
What exactly are you doing here?

394
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:42,779
Trying to show you
anyone can be reached.

395
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:44,076
What do you want?

396
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:49,090
-l want to talk to your husband.
-l know Jerome will want to talk to you.

397
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:52,787
Perhaps, though, we can come
to some other kind of arrangement.

398
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:54,625
l doubt it.

399
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:57,700
Are you telling me
you're a man of principle?

400
00:45:58,035 --> 00:46:00,697
ln light of these last few hours,
l find that contradictory.

401
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:02,203
Call him for me.

402
00:46:02,373 --> 00:46:05,206
Mr. Webber, please try
and be reasonable.

403
00:46:05,342 --> 00:46:08,675
Or you'll call the police and tell
them about your boyfriend...

404
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:11,839
...at the bus station
who you sent to kill me?

405
00:46:12,149 --> 00:46:14,743
-He's not my boyfriend.
-l don't care.

406
00:46:15,052 --> 00:46:20,183
-Call your husband, or l will.
-Hand me the phone. Please.

407
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:33,703
Julian, it's Meredith.

408
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:36,838
ls Jerome there?

409
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:39,541
How long will he be?

410
00:46:39,677 --> 00:46:42,612
Can you have him call me
as soon as he's out?

411
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:44,714
Thank you.

412
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,217
Could you pass me my robe?

413
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,681
l don't understand.

414
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:58,852
lf you're planning to hand it over,
why switch packages in the first place?

415
00:46:59,163 --> 00:47:01,563
Whatever you think
of my methodology...

416
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:04,360
...l'm a consummate professional.

417
00:47:04,535 --> 00:47:07,402
You believe l'm conspiring
against my husband.

418
00:47:07,538 --> 00:47:11,736
l didn't say that. l was hired to deliver
the package to your husband...

419
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:15,709
-...so that's how it's gonna be.
-Then you are a man of principle.

420
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:20,306
Listen. Everybody's got their
choice as to how they stay alive.

421
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:22,817
Some of us just don't know it.

422
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:32,721
-Hello.
-Mr. Mimms?

423
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,162
Checking in under
his name proved to be risky.

424
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,200
Mr. Cold....

425
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:41,702
Pardon me, Mr. Webber
is an unpopular man these days.

426
00:47:41,872 --> 00:47:43,362
What about the rental car?

427
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:45,407
Driving a four-door silver Mercedes...

428
00:47:45,543 --> 00:47:50,446
-...along with a few other people in town.
-Jesus Christ.

429
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:54,347
Now you listen to me
very carefully, Mr. Mimms.

430
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:57,750
I want this situation
resolved immediately.

431
00:47:57,888 --> 00:47:59,287
How shall l proceed?

432
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:01,856
If I have to answer that question...

433
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:05,754
...l assume you are
not up to the assignment.

434
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:14,664
Okay, silver Mercedes, FB5288.
Shouldn't be too hard.

435
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:19,775
Damn! Payday!

436
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:22,738
Fuck!

437
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:33,616
Excuse me. Sir.
Hey! Hi. Hi, excuse me.

438
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:38,727
Excuse me.

439
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:42,925
-Excuse me.
-What do you want?

440
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:45,531
You're not my guy, are you?

441
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:51,237
-Take it easy.
-Where did you get the car?

442
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:52,501
lt isn't mine.

443
00:48:52,643 --> 00:48:58,240
This man paid me 2000 euros
to drive it to Berlin and drop it off.

444
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:01,909
-We traded cars.
-Fuck!

445
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:16,028
Stupid motherfucker.

446
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:22,637
The footsteps lead off
in this direction.

447
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:28,809
There is a blood trail as well.
He must have sustained a serious injury.

448
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:35,375
We need to run a forensic test
on all this material.

449
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:42,526
All of the evidence is here.
Except no body.

450
00:49:51,669 --> 00:49:54,467
Sir, a Kevlar flak jacket.
Government lssue.

451
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:42,969
Shit.

452
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:38,789
Sean, we need to talk. Get inside.

453
00:53:38,962 --> 00:53:41,226
We'll take a drive.

454
00:53:55,812 --> 00:53:58,110
How bad is it?

455
00:53:58,248 --> 00:54:01,809
Could get a lot worse
if we don't bring him in.

456
00:54:04,555 --> 00:54:07,718
What do you expect me to do?
l talked to him for 20 minutes.

457
00:54:07,858 --> 00:54:11,817
He told me he had to go to Germany,
and after that, who knows where.

458
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:17,600
All l'm asking
is that you wait on a call.

459
00:54:17,935 --> 00:54:20,199
Help bring him in.

460
00:54:20,337 --> 00:54:22,328
That's it.

461
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:16,086
-Hello.
-Sean, l was about to leave a message.

462
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:18,786
-What's up?
-Do you remember a friend of Dad's...

463
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:20,987
...by the name of Agatha Shearwater?

464
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:23,964
-Yeah.
-I got a package I gotta send to her.

465
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:28,037
Tell her it's important she gets it
and tells me what's on it.

466
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:30,071
-Jon--
-And one other thing.

467
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:35,008
Remember my friend Boris, works in my
department? Tell him l'll be calling soon.

468
00:55:35,178 --> 00:55:39,046
Listen, Jon, there's something
here l need to go over with you...

469
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:41,650
...something of Dad's that he left for you.

470
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:46,154
We can't close his office until then.
Do you think you could come back?

471
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:50,020
-I don't know.
-Just for a day or two.

472
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:54,159
-lt's important.
-l'll try to make it back later.

473
00:55:54,297 --> 00:55:56,162
Listen, Jon--

474
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:59,193
You did a good thing, Sean.

475
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:08,176
-Hello?
-There's a fire lane north of Terminus.

476
00:56:08,345 --> 00:56:09,744
-Can you find it?
-Yes.

477
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,178
There's an old building
on the west side.

478
00:56:12,315 --> 00:56:16,877
That's where I'll be. I'll wait 10
minutes. By quarter past, I'll be gone.

479
00:56:17,054 --> 00:56:20,319
-Be on time. Be alone.
-What about my daughter?

480
00:56:20,457 --> 00:56:23,085
I need to take care of her,
make sure she's safe.

481
00:56:23,226 --> 00:56:25,786
She'll be fine. Just you be careful.

482
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:31,367
I hope so. She's all I've got.
I'll see you in a little while. Goodbye.

483
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:36,295
My Fuhrer sends his apologies.

484
00:56:37,174 --> 00:56:41,838
Hiring that sauerkraut to drive
your rental was a nice touch.

485
00:56:41,978 --> 00:56:45,209
l hope you didn't go far
out of pocket on my account.

486
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:47,316
Ain't no thing.

487
00:56:48,051 --> 00:56:50,042
You kind of look like Ray Charles.

488
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,688
Old Ray can't shoot
as good as you, right?

489
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:55,257
-There you go.
-What can l do for you?

490
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:59,225
We'll talk about it on the way down.
Let's go.

491
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:03,322
-Jared sent you?
-Something like that.

492
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:07,927
Should've stayed in France.
Kept this venture out of the spotlight.

493
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:09,402
Let me ask you something.

494
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:14,006
-Did Olyphant send you for the package?
-What package would that be?

495
00:57:14,144 --> 00:57:16,908
All right, man,
let's cut to the chase, okay?

496
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:21,484
-You like the dollar bill?
-Dead presidents. Greenbacks.

497
00:57:21,785 --> 00:57:22,945
You care to expound?

498
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,181
l'll give you 1 0 times more
than he's giving you for this business.

499
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:32,887
l got a disk loaded with offshore accounts
of the biggest dogs in the world.

500
00:57:33,063 --> 00:57:35,327
Hundreds of millions of dollars.

501
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:38,866
-You don't have this with you, do you?
-lt's real close.

502
00:57:39,002 --> 00:57:42,096
Wow. You don't miss a trick.

503
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:46,538
The ball is in your court for
the next two minutes. You fuck up...

504
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:49,778
...at least l get to kill a legend.

505
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:58,553
Because l have no love lost for Jared
Olyphant. He can kiss my black ass.

506
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:11,864
Yeah, you know...

507
00:58:12,002 --> 00:58:13,902
...your man Dunois...

508
00:58:14,037 --> 00:58:18,269
...when l popped a cap in his ass,
he flew out the window like a bird.

509
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:23,771
-How does it look?
-So far, so good.

510
00:58:24,014 --> 00:58:27,074
-How does it look inside?
-Look good to me.

511
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:30,809
-All good. No surprises, right?
-l got nothing for you.

512
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:34,388
You're the man. You are the man.

513
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:37,888
Yeah, l hope we getting close
to that disk.

514
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:40,462
Watch your ass, Mr. Cold.

515
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:43,823
l don't wanna shoot you in the back.

516
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:13,853
l don't suppose it would pay
to ask who sent you.

517
00:59:13,997 --> 00:59:18,058
-No good.
-You know, l just somehow feel like...

518
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:21,068
...this might be the end
of the road for me.

519
00:59:21,204 --> 00:59:25,197
But you do remind me of my cousin Delbert
from down around Bogalusa.

520
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:58,506
Motherfucker!

521
01:00:01,378 --> 01:00:05,576
-l let you live, and you do me like this?
-You let me live?

522
01:00:58,468 --> 01:01:00,561
Sweet dreams, Bruce Lee.

523
01:01:00,737 --> 01:01:02,227
Here's the disk.

524
01:01:07,978 --> 01:01:09,605
Love a barbecue.

525
01:01:21,992 --> 01:01:25,086
That was not an accident, old friend.

526
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:29,562
l promise you, l haven't had
a clean shot like that in years.

527
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:32,626
Marquet send you?

528
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:36,261
Our good friend Marquet
met with an untimely accident.

529
01:01:36,406 --> 01:01:40,103
l'm sorry to have to tell you this.
l remember how close you were.

530
01:01:40,243 --> 01:01:44,236
-You don't look too good.
-You don't look so good yourself.

531
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:46,143
l should be on the Riviera...

532
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:49,513
...a craving l've had since my mother
showed me the ocean.

533
01:01:49,652 --> 01:01:51,745
Waves massaging the shore...

534
01:01:52,088 --> 01:01:55,785
...whilst l watch the sunset,
drinking champagne.

535
01:01:56,092 --> 01:01:59,323
Now, no more bedtime stories.

536
01:01:59,696 --> 01:02:03,632
-Where's the package?
-What package?

537
01:02:06,169 --> 01:02:09,332
You're running out
of hiding places, my friend.

538
01:02:09,472 --> 01:02:13,238
Do you believe l found this barn
through premonition?

539
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:17,437
Do what you can to eliminate
the innocent from this equation.

540
01:02:17,614 --> 01:02:20,344
lt looks like you've been had, Dunois.

541
01:02:20,483 --> 01:02:24,010
Meredith sent you to kill me,
but she's got the package.

542
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:27,555
-l thought you were smarter than that.
-No, no, no.

543
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:30,523
You're much smarter than that.

544
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,426
l know you like l know myself.
Don't fuck with me.

545
01:02:34,564 --> 01:02:39,592
Why don't you go ahead and kill me then.
Start your own little Easter egg hunt.

546
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:43,466
-What the fuck is that?
-That sets up a honing device.

547
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:46,336
Folks will come
and find you within meters.

548
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:49,775
-Lets who know where to find you?
-Foreign ops.

549
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:52,809
-How do you stop it?
-You don't. lt's too late.

550
01:02:54,451 --> 01:03:00,048
Son of a bitch.
They know you're here. The ClA.

551
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:04,718
Know what that means? lf these folks
are coming, there's more behind them.

552
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:09,560
All right. You've bought some time.
We'll go to his wife...

553
01:03:10,233 --> 01:03:11,757
...get the package.

554
01:03:12,102 --> 01:03:17,267
-l'll deal with her. Then we walk away.
-l'd love to walk away.

555
01:03:46,469 --> 01:03:51,270
-What's going on?
-l'll explain later. We gotta get out of here.

556
01:03:53,877 --> 01:03:55,811
Let's go.

557
01:04:13,663 --> 01:04:16,359
At your estate, l'll borrow a few things.

558
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:19,366
l'll leave you this.
Then l'm out of here.

559
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:21,868
-Mr. Webber, l--
-My name is Jonathan...

560
01:04:22,172 --> 01:04:24,333
...and l've opened the package.

561
01:04:26,709 --> 01:04:30,668
Why are you and your husband
so interested in that crash?

562
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:34,248
There's a ''we'' involved,
but it doesn't include me.

563
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:44,525
Let's move. Jared wants a clean sweep
of this place immediately.

564
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:48,152
Keep moving. Let's go! Let's go!

565
01:04:50,266 --> 01:04:53,235
''We.'' Who else besides
your husband was involved?

566
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:54,859
Jared Olyphant.

567
01:04:55,205 --> 01:05:00,165
-Are they in here, Jared and your husband?
-l'm not sure.

568
01:05:00,343 --> 01:05:02,311
Prep the charges.

569
01:05:03,713 --> 01:05:05,874
First charge is in place.

570
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:10,847
Come on, hurry it up.
l want no traces left.

571
01:05:11,387 --> 01:05:16,916
l need you to help us get away
from Jerome. Far away.

572
01:05:17,227 --> 01:05:20,958
l know what they did,
and l know why they did it.

573
01:05:21,264 --> 01:05:25,564
l've been planning this for a year.
With your help, we can finally get out.

574
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:29,536
l won't help until you tell me
why they blew up that plane.

575
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,704
Final charge prepped and ready.

576
01:05:36,512 --> 01:05:39,242
Setting final charge now.

577
01:05:40,383 --> 01:05:41,782
Prepare to move out.

578
01:05:41,918 --> 01:05:41,985
ln 1 982, Jerome formed
a company called Unified Growth...

579
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:45,887
ln 1 982, Jerome formed
a company called Unified Growth...

580
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:48,957
...building fertilizer plants
throughout Europe.

581
01:05:49,259 --> 01:05:52,353
-The plants were a front.
-Biochemical warfare.

582
01:05:52,528 --> 01:05:56,692
The plants came under the umbrella of the
lnternational Security Services Board.

583
01:05:56,866 --> 01:05:59,528
Run by Jared Olyphant.

584
01:05:59,669 --> 01:06:03,901
The head engineer of Unified Growth
documented everything.

585
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,266
He was planning on exposing
the entire operation.

586
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:10,846
The developer's name
was Stefan Stockwell.

587
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,471
He was a very good friend of mine.

588
01:06:13,616 --> 01:06:17,575
Stefan kept quiet until he had
every detail accounted for.

589
01:06:17,754 --> 01:06:21,383
He was going to Greece.
He never made it.

590
01:06:28,431 --> 01:06:33,266
lf my husband suspects
that l have anything to do with this...

591
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:35,597
...he will kill me.

592
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:38,837
And anyone else
who's associated with me.

593
01:06:40,476 --> 01:06:43,604
-What do these lead to?
-The truth.

594
01:06:43,746 --> 01:06:47,477
Stefan had a house in Norway.

595
01:06:47,617 --> 01:06:51,053
Jerome knows nothing about it.
Stefan hid the documents...

596
01:06:51,354 --> 01:06:55,347
...and l am the only one left
who knows where they are.

597
01:06:55,925 --> 01:06:59,986
And how deeply involved
Jerome and Jared are.

598
01:07:00,296 --> 01:07:03,993
l may be able to get you and your
daughter into Paris, then Norway.

599
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,098
l know this isn't easy for you.

600
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:09,431
Thank you.

601
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:05,519
Don't talk on the phone to anybody.
Your husband's got the wire tapped.

602
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:09,119
-Tapped?
-That guy found us at the barn somehow.

603
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:12,127
He probably heard something
on the phone.

604
01:08:12,602 --> 01:08:15,036
Figure out something
to tell your daughter...

605
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:19,631
...about who l am and why you're going
with me here. Goodbye.

606
01:08:51,407 --> 01:08:53,204
What do you think?

607
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:57,645
-Dad's old hangout. You hungry?
-No.

608
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,407
Listen.

609
01:09:00,016 --> 01:09:01,415
Here.

610
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:05,019
Agatha sent the original
to your usual pickup.

611
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:07,045
Don't worry about it.

612
01:09:10,193 --> 01:09:13,924
You mind if we go someplace else?
Somewhere we could talk?

613
01:09:40,756 --> 01:09:42,246
We lost them.

614
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:01,839
-What's going on?
-What are you talking about?

615
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:04,536
Jared's telling me
you fucked up bigtime.

616
01:10:04,714 --> 01:10:09,014
Look, he told me what you did
after you got caught.

617
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:13,679
Are you trying to negotiate your way out
by giving up Dad's name to the KGB?

618
01:10:13,823 --> 01:10:17,190
-Just to save your ass?
-He's playing you to get to me.

619
01:10:17,493 --> 01:10:22,294
-Then you tell me what happened.
-You know l'm not a talkative man...

620
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:26,659
...but l'll say this.
l was what they call a foreigner.

621
01:10:27,236 --> 01:10:32,139
Deep undercover. No trace, no ties.
l was arrested for espionage.

622
01:10:32,275 --> 01:10:36,769
Dad and Jared could have gotten me out.
Jared made sure they didn't.

623
01:10:36,913 --> 01:10:41,077
Suddenly, the whereabouts
of Jonathan Cold are no longer recorded.

624
01:10:41,217 --> 01:10:43,947
Jared left me to rot in Soviet prison.

625
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:51,793
That's where Jared is.

626
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:55,694
-His boys probably told him they lost us.
-Yeah.

627
01:11:38,574 --> 01:11:42,874
Jared, aren't you a little old
for this cloak-and-dagger shit?

628
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:48,917
By now l'm sure you know it's almost
behind me. Do yourself a favor...

629
01:11:49,051 --> 01:11:54,648
...walk away. Get on a plane and go.
You've made your point.

630
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:59,784
l somehow think if l got up on a plane,
it would suddenly blow up in the sky.

631
01:11:59,929 --> 01:12:03,023
Somehow you always know,
don't you?

632
01:12:03,165 --> 01:12:07,124
That tape won't do any good
for anything anymore. lt's too late.

633
01:12:07,269 --> 01:12:12,764
You really think after 1 6 years that
little episode will come home to roost?

634
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:14,408
Think again.

635
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:20,906
Okay. Listen, little piece of advice.
Stay away from me.

636
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:25,077
When the time is right,
l'm sure Sean will lend a hand.

637
01:12:45,941 --> 01:12:50,708
-They are not coming, are they?
-Doesn't seem like it.

638
01:12:53,249 --> 01:12:56,980
Listen, l want to hand you this.
You know what to do...

639
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:00,680
-...if anything happens to me.
-No problem.

640
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:15,369
This side looks good.

641
01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:23,774
-l've been spotting this wall all day.
-How come l'm still running into you?

642
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:27,074
Because you didn't kill me
at the old building.

643
01:13:27,216 --> 01:13:29,684
Why are you here?

644
01:13:30,052 --> 01:13:32,953
You didn't return for the princess?

645
01:13:33,823 --> 01:13:38,851
How little you know. The little princess
hired me to kill her husband.

646
01:13:38,994 --> 01:13:44,955
Don't you think it's a coincidence that
she would have found both of us?

647
01:13:45,101 --> 01:13:50,038
She reached me through the Danish.
How she knows them is anybody's guess.

648
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:53,869
l told Marquet you were behind this,
and you killed him, didn't you?

649
01:13:54,009 --> 01:13:57,945
Going to Versailles was supposed
to be simple.

650
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,174
Take care of the Russians,
collect the package.

651
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,374
And get rid of me?

652
01:14:02,752 --> 01:14:05,346
-You weren't supposed to be there.
-But l was.

653
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:10,857
That was your friend Marquet's call.
Sending forth his confidant.

654
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:15,019
He was the go-between
for Jerome Van Aken.

655
01:14:15,464 --> 01:14:17,932
What are you gonna do?

656
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:20,535
Pull the trigger? Huh?

657
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:26,770
There's an army of them in there.
lt's impossible to get in alone.

658
01:14:26,909 --> 01:14:30,037
And you, my friend, want in.

659
01:14:30,813 --> 01:14:32,747
Together, l think we can.

660
01:14:32,882 --> 01:14:38,184
Once we're in, do whatever you want,
just stay away from me and the girl.

661
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:42,984
Let's do this. Remember, l will be
watching you. Every move you make.

662
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:44,820
Let's go.

663
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:14,979
-l count six, seven, yeah?
-Seven, yeah.

664
01:15:15,124 --> 01:15:17,354
-How many rounds you got?
-Six.

665
01:15:17,493 --> 01:15:21,327
lt's a long shot. You're the expert.

666
01:15:22,298 --> 01:15:25,028
-Take this.
-Cheers.

667
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:05,538
Fuck it. l'll use the rifle.

668
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,441
Bon, fucking, soir, monsieur.

669
01:17:22,351 --> 01:17:24,319
What do you think, l'm stupid?

670
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:30,458
That wasn't very nice, but then again,
one good turn deserves another.

671
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:56,342
Mr. Cold, l presume.

672
01:17:57,486 --> 01:17:59,283
lt's a pleasure to meet you.

673
01:17:59,421 --> 01:18:04,984
You come highly recommended to me
by a friend of mine, Alexander Marquet.

674
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:09,096
-l was hoping you had something for me.
-No.

675
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:11,756
-You delivered it to Meredith?
-Yeah.

676
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:20,768
Allow me to enlighten you as to
the condition of my wife, Mr. Cold.

677
01:18:21,076 --> 01:18:23,601
She is a deeply troubled woman.

678
01:18:24,513 --> 01:18:27,414
-l don't wanna hear it.
-l think it's only fair.

679
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:32,211
After all, l have a feeling
you've fallen victim to her illness.

680
01:18:32,354 --> 01:18:36,085
lt evokes a certain
bird with a broken wing syndrome.

681
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:38,284
Meredith has a way with people...

682
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:43,295
...a talent for persuading them to assist
her in playing out her delusions.

683
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:49,704
She took my daughter, Mr. Cold.

684
01:18:52,441 --> 01:18:55,171
And diseased or not...

685
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:58,802
...that is the basest form
of moral turpitude imaginable.

686
01:18:59,248 --> 01:19:01,443
And what about Stefan?

687
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:05,314
-He was a friend of mine.
-Until he had an affair with your wife?

688
01:19:05,454 --> 01:19:09,015
l didn't find out about the affair
until a year ago.

689
01:19:09,191 --> 01:19:12,820
By then, it had very little bearing
on my feelings toward Stefan.

690
01:19:13,162 --> 01:19:16,495
Well, listen, l'd like you
to listen to this.

691
01:19:19,268 --> 01:19:21,327
-Something's moving towards us.
-Can't be.

692
01:19:21,503 --> 01:19:24,336
It's moving in our flight path.
Check the radar.

693
01:19:24,473 --> 01:19:28,409
Nothing. Wait, I see it.
There, cruising at 28,000 feet.

694
01:19:28,544 --> 01:19:32,742
It's gonna hit us, unless--
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, it--

695
01:19:35,684 --> 01:19:38,517
Believe what you will, Mr. Cold.

696
01:19:38,654 --> 01:19:43,353
That l have the power to motivate
something as terrible as that.

697
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:47,427
She's told you what she thinks
l've done and why l did it.

698
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:52,330
The whole incident's been an ongoing
obsession of hers the past decade.

699
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:56,528
Stefan Stockwell
was her lover, Mr. Cold.

700
01:19:56,705 --> 01:20:01,267
What he wasn't was some trumped-up
humanitarian with a conscience.

701
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:05,510
He was our top engineer.
He knew what we paid him to do.

702
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:10,516
Whatever dictated his ethics later on,
if indeed anything did, l can't tell you.

703
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:13,120
Unfortunately,
he died in a plane crash...

704
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:18,215
...which my wife has convinced
herself l am entirely responsible for.

705
01:20:18,627 --> 01:20:24,088
Wishing something to happen and
planning it are two different things.

706
01:20:24,233 --> 01:20:25,666
That's true.

707
01:20:25,834 --> 01:20:28,394
Despite my personal
differences with Stefan...

708
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:32,336
...l would not kill dozens
of innocent people to see him dead.

709
01:20:32,474 --> 01:20:37,571
As l've told you before,
Meredith is a very persuasive woman.

710
01:20:37,746 --> 01:20:39,304
Now, where is she?

711
01:20:53,495 --> 01:20:57,261
Find my wife and daughter, Mr. Cold.

712
01:20:57,399 --> 01:21:01,563
Find them and bring my daughter
back safely and l'll pay you any price.

713
01:21:01,904 --> 01:21:05,772
lncluding any judgments
or inquiries placed upon me.

714
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:08,837
You have your own pros.
Why don't you use them?

715
01:21:09,144 --> 01:21:10,338
Well....

716
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:16,449
l understand one of my closest
met with an unfortunate accident...

717
01:21:16,585 --> 01:21:20,817
...in Warsaw last night.
l'm afraid l'm running out of them.

718
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:26,484
l can make you a very rich man,
Mr. Cold.

719
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:32,765
Bring my daughter
back safely, at any price.

720
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:35,759
And what about your wife?

721
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:56,757
l leave that up to your best judgment.

722
01:22:18,413 --> 01:22:20,381
Yes?

723
01:22:21,783 --> 01:22:24,308
lt must look like an accident.

724
01:22:24,953 --> 01:22:26,545
Yes.

725
01:22:31,693 --> 01:22:36,027
l expected more from you, Dunois.

726
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:40,563
At the very least, l thought you would
have recovered that package.

727
01:22:40,702 --> 01:22:42,465
But no matter.

728
01:22:43,905 --> 01:22:49,468
l'm sure Mr. Cold will help
finish things.

729
01:22:55,317 --> 01:22:56,875
Oh, yes...

730
01:22:57,519 --> 01:23:01,819
...your services
are no longer required.

731
01:23:05,394 --> 01:23:10,627
l'm afraid my employer
feels differently.

732
01:23:39,461 --> 01:23:42,897
Come on, Clarissa.
Come inside, please.

733
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:47,301
-Mommy, Mommy.
-l'm in here, darling.

734
01:23:55,977 --> 01:23:57,501
Thanks for the lift.

735
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:02,582
l need to go to the old farmhouse.
lt's down the road.

736
01:24:29,444 --> 01:24:31,344
Everything okay?

737
01:24:43,158 --> 01:24:45,023
No!

738
01:24:50,699 --> 01:24:52,530
No!

739
01:26:09,077 --> 01:26:11,204
Jonathan, behind you!

740
01:26:24,092 --> 01:26:25,889
Get her out the window.

741
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,029
Go. Now.

742
01:26:28,663 --> 01:26:31,131
Come on, darling. lt's okay.

743
01:27:38,567 --> 01:27:41,331
Next time, wait for me, all right?

744
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:07,150
-Hope this will do.
-Thank you.

745
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:10,127
And l need you to keep these closed.

746
01:28:10,265 --> 01:28:14,964
-lt's a beautiful view.
-Well, you'll just have to enjoy it later.

747
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:18,601
Somehow, wine doesn't suit you.

748
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:23,768
-You seem more like a whiskey man.
-What's that supposed to mean?

749
01:28:25,347 --> 01:28:29,875
What else have you discovered while
you were snooping around my home?

750
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:34,853
Only that you don't keep
many personal artifacts.

751
01:28:35,824 --> 01:28:37,348
Thank you.

752
01:28:43,164 --> 01:28:46,292
-Do you have a family?
-l have a brother.

753
01:28:46,801 --> 01:28:50,134
-Older or younger?
-Wiser.

754
01:28:51,673 --> 01:28:55,200
Listen, l wanna concentrate on
how to get you out of Paris.

755
01:28:55,343 --> 01:28:59,677
ls there any place in particular
that you'd like to go?

756
01:29:00,949 --> 01:29:03,281
America.

757
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:10,888
This is yours.

758
01:29:11,026 --> 01:29:15,190
A lot of good it should do now.
All the real evidence was destroyed.

759
01:29:15,363 --> 01:29:18,127
Well, we can build it again.

760
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:22,427
lt's hard keeping her cooped up.
Can l take her for a walk?

761
01:29:29,878 --> 01:29:32,972
lt truly is a beautiful city.

762
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:38,048
-Oh, God.
-What?

763
01:29:38,219 --> 01:29:41,677
Get away from that girl, now!

764
01:29:41,823 --> 01:29:44,792
lt's not safe on the streets.
We've been spotted.

765
01:29:44,926 --> 01:29:46,655
Gotta get you out of here.

766
01:29:48,697 --> 01:29:51,860
Sit down in here.
Right here. Don't move.

767
01:29:52,033 --> 01:29:54,001
You hear me? Don't move.

768
01:30:19,728 --> 01:30:23,323
The mother and daughter
that were here, have you seen them?

769
01:30:33,341 --> 01:30:34,899
Meredith?

770
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,510
lt's from Meredith.

771
01:30:43,351 --> 01:30:47,947
l had the currency exchanged.
lt was the least l could do...

772
01:30:48,089 --> 01:30:51,422
-...after you'd killed me twice.
-Sorry about that.

773
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,729
But, you know,
they say three's a charm.

774
01:30:58,233 --> 01:30:59,962
Surprise!

775
01:31:09,744 --> 01:31:11,837
Come on! Come on!

776
01:31:57,525 --> 01:32:00,460
Thank you for your help
in securing the package.

777
01:32:00,595 --> 01:32:04,361
It was the only way to force
my husband to relinquish our daughter.

778
01:32:04,499 --> 01:32:06,990
But now that it's over
and I have her...

779
01:32:07,135 --> 01:32:09,865
...your services
are no longer required.

780
01:32:10,004 --> 01:32:11,596
I wish you all the best.

781
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:16,570
Maybe we'll meet again
somewhere down the road. Meredith.
