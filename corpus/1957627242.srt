You're damn right he felt guilty.

And you act like he gave her that gun on purpose.

475
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:25,545

No, I think it's a bit late for that, don't you?

00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:48,681
You've got no witnesses to corroborate your story.

538
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:52,183
No physical proof that he was even there.

539
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:57,154
The best that I can do is get a restraining order.

540
00:38:58,222 --> 00:38:59,323
That's it?

541
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:01,158
I'm afraid so.

542
00:39:01,191 --> 00:39:04,227
But once he's served with the papers,

543
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,230
you let me know if he harasses you again before the trial.

544
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:10,198
Because if he does, I'll throw him in jail.

545
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:17,004

Bait?

557
00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:20,057
I'm supposed to use bait?

You want some help?

Um, some more ice.

I mean they're getting awfully chummy, aren't they?

00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,083
You know, I don't know why you've never liked her.

570
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:34,118
You said she would never sign a prenuptial, and she did.

571
00:41:34,151 --> 00:41:36,921
And you didn't think the marriage would be a good one, and it was.

572
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:39,222
But yet you still blame her for Ted's death.

573
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:41,291
Why don't you just get over it already?

amazing moment right before you orgasm,

when your heart stops and you can't breathe.

602
00:49:14,835 --> 00:49:19,306
The Hannons pleaded with Mr. Lomax to stop the endless harassment.

603
00:49:21,307 --> 00:49:23,643
But the defendant was relentless.

604
00:49:25,011 --> 00:49:29,281
He even continued to harass Mrs. Hannon after her husband's death.

605
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:34,151
On the night of the murder,

606
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:42,325
the defendant sent Mrs. Hannon a provocative piece of lingerie.

607
00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:46,828
Ted Hannon, being a man of honor,

608
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:50,398
went to Mr. Lomax's apartment, unarmed,

609
00:49:51,532 --> 00:49:53,834
to resolve the matter peacefully.

610
00:49:55,202 --> 00:49:59,406
When he arrived, Mr. Lomax was laying in wait.

611
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:03,409
Now, Mr. Lomax will claim that he was afraid for his life.

612
00:50:04,176 --> 00:50:06,312
But make no mistake about it,

613
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:09,380
he was stalking his prey.

614

Ladies and gentlemen,

615
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,217
I am positive

616
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:19,156
that when you hear all the evidence in this case,

617
00:50:19,189 --> 00:50:22,325
you will find Robert Lomax

618
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:23,960
guilty of murder.

619
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:28,930
Thank you very much.

620
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:41,374
Robert Lomax regrets this unfortunate loss of life.

621
00:50:42,775 --> 00:50:46,778
But this is a classic case of self-defense.

622
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:51,082
It is nothing more, and nothing less.

623
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:56,453
And, um, when I heard all the noise,

624
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:59,522
I peeked outside and I saw Mr. Hannon open Lomax's door.

625
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,924
But the chain was on.

626
00:51:01,957 --> 00:51:04,193
Then you're saying that the door was unlocked?

627
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:06,128
Yeah. Definitely.

628
00:51:06,161 --> 00:51:08,029
And then what happened?

629
00:51:08,062 --> 00:51:12,800
He kicked the door in and went inside. And a few seconds later, the gun went off.

630
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:16,136
Once Mr. Hannon entered the apartment,

631
00:51:17,304 --> 00:51:19,905
did you hear the defendant say anything

632
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:22,074
prior to the gunshot?

633
00:51:22,108 --> 00:51:23,242
No.

634
00:51:23,275 --> 00:51:26,678
Then you did not hear the defendant warn the victim?

635
00:51:26,711 --> 00:51:28,246
No, he didn't say a word.

636
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:29,514
Was the victim armed?

637
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:31,016
No.

638
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:34,284
Was there anything on his person that might be construed as a weapon?

639
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:37,054
No. Nothing.

640
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:41,157
What was the distance between the defendant and the victim

641
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:42,558
at the time of the shooting?

642
00:51:42,592 --> 00:51:45,694
According to the forensic report, about 10 feet.

643
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,866
Would you say that's about the distance between us right now?

644
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,403
Yeah. That's about right.

645
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:59,572
Detective Snyder, in your fifteen years on the L.A. police force,

646
00:52:00,106 --> 00:52:02,007
have you ever heard

647
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:06,345
of an unarmed man inflicting bodily injury from 10 feet away?

648
00:52:07,146 --> 00:52:08,913
Not in my experience.

649
00:52:09,747 --> 00:52:12,683
Then what did Mr. Hannon say?

650
00:52:12,717 --> 00:52:17,421
He said, "If you bother my wife again, I'll fucking kill you."

651
00:52:21,424 --> 00:52:22,658
Sorry, Judge.

652
00:52:22,691 --> 00:52:24,126
I'm familiar with the word.

Yeah.

I started working at Hannon Properties after I graduated college.

00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:55,369
Yes.

666
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:57,937
How long after that were you married?

667
00:53:58,738 --> 00:54:00,106
Two years.

668
00:54:00,139 --> 00:54:01,740
How long were you married?

669
00:54:03,175 --> 00:54:05,744
About three and a half years.

670
00:54:05,777 --> 00:54:09,146
In the five and a half years that you knew Ted Hannon,

671
00:54:11,149 --> 00:54:13,217
would you say that you knew him well?

672
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:14,951
Very well.

673
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,888
After the incident in the Cezanne restaurant,

674
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:22,291
did you receive another gift from the defendant?

675
00:54:22,324 --> 00:54:24,326
Yes, the very next night.

676
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,895
And what was your husband's response?

677
00:54:27,762 --> 00:54:29,597
He became extremely upset.

678
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:33,500
Mrs. Hannon, what was your husband's intention

679
00:54:33,534 --> 00:54:36,603
when he went to the defendant's apartment that night?

680
00:54:36,637 --> 00:54:38,571
Objection. Speculation.

681
00:54:38,604 --> 00:54:42,742
It goes to state of mind, Your Honor. She is an expert witness

682
00:54:42,775 --> 00:54:44,543
who knew the victim intimately.

683
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:46,244
She can answer.

684
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:49,281
He went there to finally talk some sense into him.

685
00:54:51,181 --> 00:54:55,019
He didn't go there to try to hurt him, otherwise he would've brought a gun

686
00:54:55,052 --> 00:54:56,486
or something.

687
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:00,256
I mean, you have to understand, this man was constantly harassing us.

688
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:04,626
I tried time and time again to tell him to leave me alone!

689
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,794
He is crazy!

690

Mrs. Hannon, please control yourself.

693
00:55:15,936 --> 00:55:19,439
Mrs. Hannon, each time Mr. Lomax sent you a gift,

694
00:55:20,606 --> 00:55:22,274
did you accept it?

695
00:55:23,676 --> 00:55:24,743
Yes.

696
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,612
And you never refused?

697
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:32,282
No, but I...

698
00:55:32,316 --> 00:55:36,119
So although you kept telling him you were married,

699
00:55:36,153 --> 00:55:38,754
you kept accepting his gifts, correct?

700
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:40,890
Yes, but I didn't...

701
00:55:40,923 --> 00:55:43,658
A simple yes or no will suffice, thank you.

702
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:55,135
According to your February phone bill, you placed a phone call to Mr. Lomax

703
00:55:55,169 --> 00:55:58,004
on the evening of your husband's death. Is that correct?

704
00:55:58,037 --> 00:55:59,205
Yes.

705
00:55:59,238 --> 00:56:02,040
And isn't it true that you called Mr. Lomax

706
00:56:02,074 --> 00:56:05,577
because you believed that your husband was going to harm him?

707
00:56:05,877 --> 00:56:06,878
No.

708
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:08,579
No?

709
00:56:08,613 --> 00:56:11,782
Well, then can you possibly explain the purpose of that phone call?

710
00:56:11,816 --> 00:56:16,086
To let him have it. To tell him off for his repulsive behavior.

711
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:19,055
To tell him again to leave me alone.

712
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:22,024

Mrs. Hannon called me just before her husband got there.

755

What did she say?

756
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:34,384
She said that he was on his way over there to tear me apart.

757

I needed to get out.

758
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,824
But, Mr. Lomax, isn't that in direct conflict with Mrs. Hannon's testimony?

She lied.

Yeah.

00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:53,567
Yes. And if I were in the process of leaving a message, and you picked up the phone,

763
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,335
the machine would cut off, correct?

764
00:59:56,369 --> 00:59:58,738
No. It's voice activated.

765
00:59:59,672 --> 01:00:03,375
What does voice activated mean, Mr. Lomax?

766
01:00:03,408 --> 01:00:06,478
It means if you and I are having a conversation, the machine

01:00:06,511 --> 01:00:09,380

Mrs. Hannon? Let's do the exam, sweetie.

897

Let me help you. Lay back.

898
01:15:22,473 --> 01:15:25,542
It was definitely a rape.

899
01:15:25,576 --> 01:15:29,079
His semen is inside her. Her skin is under his fingernails.

900
01:15:31,314 --> 01:15:32,848
Excuse me, sir?

903
01:15:48,861 --> 01:15:52,365
And why did you go to the beach house today, Mrs. Hannon?

904
01:15:57,135 --> 01:16:02,506
Last week, when we were up there, Nick gave me a pair of earrings.

905
01:16:05,209 --> 01:16:07,210
And this morning I couldn't find one.

906
01:16:08,745 --> 01:16:11,214
And I went there to look for it.

907
01:16:11,247 --> 01:16:14,617
I know this is difficult, but can you tell me what happened?

908
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:17,086
I was in the bedroom,

909
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,888
and I found the earring.

910
01:16:25,192 --> 01:16:28,695
And as I went to leave, he was standing in the doorway,

911
01:16:29,363 --> 01:16:30,896
and grabbed me.

912
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:34,767
And he put a knife to my throat.

913
01:16:37,535 --> 01:16:39,771
I thought he was gonna kill me.

914
01:16:42,506 --> 01:16:46,910
But he threw me on the bed and he raped me.

915
01:16:49,379 --> 01:16:53,750
After he came, he rolled off me and I managed to get the gun.

916
01:16:54,449 --> 01:16:56,118
Where was the gun?

917
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,389
Right beside the bed in the nightstand.

918
01:17:01,422 --> 01:17:04,992
You know, the gun was illegal. The serial numbers had been scratched off.

919
01:17:06,027 --> 01:17:07,794
Where did you get it?

920
01:17:10,563 --> 01:17:12,564
My husband gave it to me.

921
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:19,303
He thought the beach house was too isolated and that

922
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,841
I would have some protection if I was by myself.

923
01:17:26,276 --> 01:17:29,546
That's all I'll need right now, Mrs. Hannon. Thank you.

924
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:37,719
What about my car?

925
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:44,925
Don't worry about it.

926
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:49,095
I'll send someone from the office to go get it.

927
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,268
So, when did Dad give you that gun?

928
01:18:03,074 --> 01:18:04,542
About a year ago.

929
01:18:05,676 --> 01:18:06,776
Why?

930
01:18:11,047 --> 01:18:13,348
No reason. I'm just glad he did.

932
01:19:42,823 --> 01:19:45,793
I'm gonna go get your prescription. Do you want anything else?

933

We'll be okay, won't we?

934
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:46,226
Do you work here?

935
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:47,327
Yeah.

936

Uh...

937
01:21:48,895 --> 01:21:50,396
I was wondering if you'd do me a favor.

938
01:21:50,429 --> 01:21:52,932
It'd really help me out if I could take a look at some of the old records.

939
01:21:52,965 --> 01:21:54,332
I'll have to talk to my boss.

940

Is he here? Yeah.

941
01:21:55,934 --> 01:21:57,035
Can you get him?

942
01:21:57,068 --> 01:21:58,136
Sure.

943
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:40,838
There's a guy over there that wants to talk to you.

01:22:46,743 --> 01:22:47,744

I could've gone, Nick. I could've taken all that cash and split.

958
01:24:01,805 --> 01:24:03,307
But I didn't.

959
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:06,109

01:24:52,248 --> 01:24:54,149
