[soft melodic music continues]

11
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,708
- [Ed] Tomorrow, there'll
be a lot of teams here,

12
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,791
a lot of tough wrestlers.

13
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,333
You guys are tougher.

14
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,708
You've worked really hard,
you've sacrificed a lot.

15
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,458
You're a great team,
best I've ever had.

16
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,583
But when I look at you
guys, I don't see wrestlers,

17
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,125
I don't even see winners,

18
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,083
I see something
better, I see men

19
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,083
and you know why I say that?

20
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,875
'Cause every one
of you in this room

21
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,041
has got a fighter's heart.

22
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,958
Who knows what that means?

23
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,875
Leo?

24
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,708
- Do your best every day.
- That's right,

25
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,666
do your best every
day all the time.

26
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,625
I'm not just talking
about practice,

27
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,250
I mean, listening to your
mother, do your homework,

28
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,958
feed the dog or
take out the trash,

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,625
see what you have to
do and then do it,

30
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,166
especially if you don't like it.

31
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,250
Now, can you guys do that?

32
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,333
- [Kids] Yeah.

33
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,875
- What was that? It sounds
like a bunch of mice in here.

34
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,458
I said, can you guys do that?

35
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,875
- [Kids] Yes!

36
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,000
- All right, that's
what I thought.

37
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,166
Okay, let's go over
reversals, all right.

38
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,666
What do you want?

39
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,833
Huh? [laughing]

40
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,041
Come here.

41
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,458
Okay, remember when
the man's on top,

42
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,666
he's in control, right?

43
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,583
You gotta reverse him, turn
him around as quick as you can.

44
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,833
Go ahead, Leo.

45
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,750
Grab the wrist,
lean up, lean up.

46
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,791
There you go.

47
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,875
Good job, that's the two, boys.

48
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,791
Now when you're out on that mat,

49
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,750
remember it's a
different world, guys,

50
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,666
out on the mat, doesn't
matter what your last name is,

51
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,291
what school you go to
or if your feet stink,

52
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,833
all that matters
is what you've got

53
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,958
and what you do with
it when it counts.

54
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,833
Roger, don't let that
little pipsqueak get away.

55
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,166
Good job, pipsqueak.

56
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,625
All right, come on,
guys, hold that man down,

57
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,791
guy on top, guy on bottom,
show me it's nothing, come on.

58
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,833
Come on, Alex,
this is wrestling,

59
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,000
the way you're gonna train is
the way you're gonna fight.

60
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,666
Come on.
- Thanks.

61
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,750
- There you go, there you go,
that's better, that's better.

62
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,875
All right, come on, keep
moving, keep moving.

63
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,583
[whistle tooting]
Huddle up, let's go.

64
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,666
[feet pattering]

65
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,250
[kids groaning]

66
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,916
Okay, guys, remember, weigh-in's
tomorrow at nine, right?

67
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,208
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

68
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,000
- Remember what we've
worked so hard for?

69
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,916
- Yes.
- Pay off's that championship.

70
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,708
Okay, guys, close your eyes.

71
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,333
Visualize the win, you see it?

72
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,625
- Yeah.
- I see it.

73
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,041
- You're on that mat,

74
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,333
your hands are being raised
in triumph, you did it.

75
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,708
We did it, that big trophy.

76
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,500
Break, team!
- Team!

77
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,166
- 46 and a half, you're a
pound and a half over, dude.

78
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,875
What do you wanna do?

79
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,833
Good for you, Leo,
that's the spirit.

80
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,791
Practice like a champion.

81
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,791
[suit rustling]

82
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,125
[tape tearing]

83
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,458
So who's your favorite band?

84
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,416
- Aerosmith.

85
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,916
[tape tearing]

86
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,875
- [Ed] What do you
think your opponents

87
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:20,958
are doing right now?

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,541
- What's that mean, Dad?

89
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,875
- The guys you're
gonna beat on Saturday,

90
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,666
what do you think they're doing?

91
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,000
- I don't know.

92
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,333
- [Ed] Well, guess.

93
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,500
- Playing with their
toys or at the park.

94
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,458
- You're probably right.

95
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,208
Come Saturday, all
they're gonna do is lose.

96
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,000
You know why?
- Why?

97
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,916
- Because you worked harder.

98
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,583
[tape tearing]

99
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,833
[soft melodic music]

100
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,833
Hard work always pays off, Leo.

101
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,125
Knees up higher, higher!
[feet pattering]

102

[soft melodic music]
[feet pattering]

106
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,541
Up, come on.

107
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,583
Come on, let's go, let's get
those knees up, let's go.

108
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,875
Up, up, up, higher.

109
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,666
[whistle tooting]

110
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,916
19, we got it.

111
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,708
20, one more?

112
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,375
21, keep going, keep
going, keep going.

113
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:19,833
22, come on, for the last
match, for the last match, 23.

114
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,416
18, 19,

115
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,041
20, one more, let's go.

116
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,000
21, squeeze another.

117
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,666
22.

118
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,375
Five, four,

119
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,541
three, two, one, good man.

120
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,166
Let's get outta here.
[hands slapping]

121
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,666
We're almost there, dude.

122
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,333
You don't eat or drink anything,
we'll float what, a pound,

123
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,250
a pound and a quarter overnight?

124
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,833
- A pound.
- You'll float a pound?

125
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,125
That's great, if Mom
asks, what do we say?

126
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,708
- Already ate.

127
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,708
- Don't wanna upset her, do we?

128
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,791
- No, we don't.

129
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,666
- You tired?

130
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:53,500
- Nope.

131
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,916
- I'll race you to the car.

132
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,375
- Okay.

133
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,833
[soft orchestral music]

134
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,166
I won!

135
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,375
- You did.

136
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:10,416
[car door clicking]
Get in there.

137
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,333

[shoes thudding quietly]

156
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,500
I know you're awake.

157
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,708
Come on, aren't you gonna
help me out here, huh?

158
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,083
[Ed groaning softly]

159
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,833
What the heck is that,
is that a tarantula?

160
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,375
- Uh!
[hand slapping]

161
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,625
- Got him.

162
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,875
Don't ever give up, never quit.

163
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,958
Why do you do that?

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,458
- What?

165
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,958
- [Ed] Pretend to be asleep.

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,208
- Because I like it
when you carry me.

167
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,875
- I like it too.

168
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,666
Who's your best friend?

169
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,625
- You are, Dad and I'm
gonna try really hard

170
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,791
to win that trophy for you.

171
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,791
- You don't do it for me,
silly, you do it for yourself.

172
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,208
- [Leo] Why?

173
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,791
- Why?

174
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,125
Because I won't be able to
carry you forever, that's why.

175
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,750
Now get some sleep.

176
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,833

you, embarrass you,

out on the mat,

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,791
you gotta despise your opponent.

226
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,291
- What's despise mean, Dad?

227
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,416
- Despise means you gotta
kind of hate the guy.

228
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,750
- Why do I have
to hate him, Dad?

229
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,291

only thing standing

but I don't have a car, so.

dumb, not at all.

340
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,916
- So why'd you ask
me out anyways?

341
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,791
- What are you talking about,
why wouldn't I ask you out?

342
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,708
- Well, I don't know,
you're just like

343

the nice-looking jock type
with cute cheerleader,

344
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,750
I don't seem like I'm your type.

type, to tell you this truth,

346
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:25,750

You're gonna tell me that
that's not your type?

349
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,708
- [Leo] Not at all, what, a
Barbie doll, high maintenance?

- She's gorgeous.
- are you kidding me?

351
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't have that kind of money.

352

- High maintenance,
that's the problem?

353
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,041
Okay, I'm gonna just
stop you right now.

354
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,458
You're gonna have a
problem finding a woman,

355
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,833
who isn't high
maintenance, okay.

356
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,500
- Oh, really, so I take it
you're high maintenance?

357
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,958
- I, no, that's why I
don't have girlfriends.

358
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,875
- Yeah, it looks like I'd-
- I can't stand it.

359
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,875
Can't stand the attitude.

360
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,125
So didn't you just eat?

361
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,875
- Yeah, I got a cheat day.

362
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:54,875
- A cheat day?

363
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,916
- I can have 15 pounds
for a night, so you know.

364
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,875
Sure you don't want something?

365
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,750
- No, I'm fine.

366
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,458
Are you really gonna
eat 15 pounds tonight?

367
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,875
- Yeah, you know, for
the weekends though.

368
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,916
Pritch will gain 20, I
don't know how he does it.

369
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,875
- How is that possible?

370
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,333
- Well, you go five days
without eating, you know,

371
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,625
you work out, you
sweat, work out, sweat

372
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,666
and about two days
before weigh-in, you
dehydrate yourself,

373
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,500
you know, cut out
all the liquids.

374
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,416
- You go five days
without eating?

375
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,708
- Mm-hm.

376
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,791
- Why would anybody
do that to themselves?

377
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,083
- [Leo] I don't know.

378
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,750
- I'm sorry, did you
want a cigarette?

379
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,666
- [Leo] No, that's right.

380
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,166
[lighter clicking]
What kind of those anyways?

381
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:43,208
- They're imported from England,
my dad sends them to me.

382
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,708
He teaches English
Lit over at Cambridge,

383
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,166
that's where I plan on
going after I graduate.

384
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,666
I wanna write just like my dad.

385
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,291
- You write?

386
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,291
- Yeah, poetry, a
few short stories.

387
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,833
- So your dad sends
you smokes, huh?

388
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,625
- Yeah, it's kind
of funny actually,

389
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,500
my mom flips out about it,
right, throws her tantrum.

390
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,833
Then I catch her in the
next room smoking them,

391
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,875
[laughing] it's ridiculous.

392
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,500
Pretty typical of
an adult, I guess,

393
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,375
say one thing and
do the opposite,

394
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,458
but I love that woman to death

395
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,666
and we're like, we're
like this, best friends.

396
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,916
- Yeah, you're
lucky, you know that?

397
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,958
- Yeah, I know, I could
tell her anything.

398
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,875
This is my favorite part
of the day, the night,

399
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,708
but it's crazy, 'cause it's
morning in England soon,

400
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,458
so my dad will call
me when he gets up

401
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,750
and I'll be going to bed.

402
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:35,250
It's amazing after five years
and him being so far away,

403
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,666
that we're still so close.

404
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,958
- That's cool.

405
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,916
- So what about your
parents, are they together?

406
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,875
- They coexist, live
in the same house,

407
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:47,208
breathe the same air,
that's pretty much it.

408
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,166
Pretty close with my dad
though, he's a good guy.

409
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,916
He's a workaholic, but
I can deal with that.

410
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:56,250
[Shaw laughing]

411
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,291
But I think he's kind
of unhappy though.

412
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,291
I think he has serious regrets.

413
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:08,291
- Yeah, don't we all, you
didn't say much about your mom.

414
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:09,750
- We're not close.

415
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,583
- That's sad.

416
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:16,125
♪ I've been through
all that before ♪

417
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,958
- Why are you bleeding?

418
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,625
- Oh, it's no big deal, I
get it every once in a while,

419
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,416
from pulling all that weight.

420
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,750
Kind of embarrassing. [laughing]

421
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,791
- No, don't, don't worry about
it, I mean, are you okay?

422
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,041
- Yeah, I'm fine.

423
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,083
So you have a curfew or what?

424
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,833
- A curfew, are you
kidding? [laughing]

425
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,583
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, do you?

426
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:40,125
- I don't have a
curfew, I mean, kinda,

427
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,416
it is wrestling season
and I am training still.

428
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,000
How about I walk you home?

429
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:48,250
- Well, I should probably pick
up my car, don't you think?

430
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,875
- You have a car?

431
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,083
- Yeah, my dad got
me this old Camaro.

432
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:57,916
- So why were we walking,
why don't we go somewhere?

433
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,541
- Well, you said you
wanted to go for a walk.

434
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,500

436
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,875
[Shaw laughing]
- I got it.

437
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,583
So how'd you end up
in this hick town?

438
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,708
- Mom moved us here
after her second husband.

439
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,916
- This town sucks.

440
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:33,333
- Well, any town sucks
if you're miserable.

441
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,750
- California doesn't.

442
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,333
- California's not a town.

443
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,666
Is that where you're headed?

444
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,208
- Yeah, eventually.

445
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,291
- Yeah, I plan on going back.

446
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,791
So what are you
gonna do out west?

447
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:49,666
- Well, I got an
uncle out there,

448
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,250
but I'm going to Oklahoma first

449
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,458
on a wrestling scholarship, so.

450
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,208
- Really, you must
be pretty good then?

451
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,375
- [laughing] No, it's not
that, you know, the papers say

452
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,958
we got one of the toughest
districts in the nation,

453
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,708
I've won it twice and kinda
won it again this year, so.

454
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,333
It's not conceited, it's a fact,

455
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,750
you know, kinda like it's
a fact that you're fine.

[Shaw laughing]

457
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:17,041
- You know, I think we
should go skinny dipping.

458
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,875
- It's too cold.

459
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:21,833
- Shut up and come
on, I'm going.

460
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:24,625
- Go ahead.

- All right, fine, maybe
it's a little cold.

464
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,875
- Here, take my jacket.

465
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,333

You were out pretty late.

went through firsts.

are you doing up?

487
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,958
- Waiting, how was your day?

488
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:03,750
- Good, yours?

489
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,916
- Well, let's see, I
cleaned the kitchen,

490
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:11,250
I scrubbed the toilets,
which were filthy.

491
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,208
I organized all three closets

492
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,708
and I did the grocery shopping.

493
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,833
- Great, how are the girls?

494
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:20,625
- When they came home, they
went straight to their room,

495
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:21,666
homework, they said.

496
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,708
- Are you upset
about something here?

497
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,833
- You two leave
before I wake up,

498
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:31,583
you come home after I go to
sleep, I wanted to see my son.

499
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,583
Is that all right with you?

500
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,041
- Hi, Mom.

501
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,958
- Hi, honey, how was your day?

502
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,250
- All right.

503
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,708
- [Jessica] You look
tired, are you hungry?

504
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,666
I cooked the meatloaf
with the ketchup on top

505
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,791
just the way you like it.

506
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,291
- [Ed] It's really late,
he should go to bed.

507

- [Jessica] It's never too late.

508
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:51,583
- [Ed] We're training, okay.

509
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:54,708
- [Jessica] Which means what,
he has to starve himself?

510
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,208
- [Ed] You know how
important this is.

511
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,458
- [Jessica] To who, Ed?

512
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,708
- Actually, I am hungry, so.

513
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,625
- I left it in the oven on
low, I hope it's not dried out.

514
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,750
- Are you sure about this?

515
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,875
You're gonna have
to make this up.

516
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,125
- I know, I just don't
want her to flip out.

517
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:25,083
- [Jessica] Careful,
honey, it's hot.

518
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:27,833
How about a big glass
of chocolate milk?

519
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:28,916
- Sure.

00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:46,000
- There's some
leftovers in the fridge.

523
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:50,666

00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:13,000
[Ed breathing heavily]

529
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,875
- Coach Leone, working
out after hours?

530
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,416
[weights clanking]

531
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,208
Thurman Ellis, we talked
on the phone some weeks ago

532
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,166
about transferring my
son to this school.

533
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,833
- Of course, good to meet you.

534
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:31,833
- We are very happy to be
here, this is a great school.

535
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,583
Clean wet room, great program.

536
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,750
- So you wanna work out?

537
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:41,666
- Yeah, I didn't bring my
sweats, but you go ahead.

538
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:48,375
It's an unusual situation,
what we have here

539
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,875
with my boy and your boy being
in the same weight class.

540
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:56,583
You are the coach, I hope
that will be not a problem.

541
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,625
[weights clanking]

542
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,750
- Problem, no, be glad
to have your boy here.

543
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,125
Are you kidding?

544
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:05,708
- Good.

545
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,875
Well, my son wants to
wrestle on Friday night.

546
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,041
- Your son's entitled to try
out for any slot he wants

547
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,875
through an elimination
match, you know how it works.

548
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,916
- So it is a problem?

549
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,666
- No, I just have to
look at the big picture,

550
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,708
I think of the team as a whole.

551
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,625
- The big picture is that
my son is a state champion

552
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:27,041
and he's the same weight
division that your son is in,

553
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,583
huh, isn't that what
is happening here?

554
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,708
- Are you not listening
to me here, is this me?

555
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,333
'Cause I'm only gonna
say this one more time,

556
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,541
I've got to think of
the team as a whole,

557
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:39,375
which transcends you,
me, Leo and your son.

558
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:43,375
These boys have worked hard
all year as a unit, okay,

559
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:44,750
for these seniors, some of them,

560
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:46,833
it's the last match
they'll ever have.

561
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,916
Every one of these boys
are what's important here.

562
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,958
- Then we have to have
an elimination match,

563
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,625
let's do it that way, my
son wrestles your son.

564
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,583
- You want an elimination match?

565
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,833
- Of course, Mr. Leone,
my son works very hard,

566
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,500
he makes good grades
and he's a good boy.

567
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,708
It's not his fault
that we moved.

568
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,291
So I hope you could take
that into consideration,

569
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:08,166
that he's in a very delicate
situation being a teenager,

570
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:10,500
wanting to be accepted
at his new school

571
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:12,250
by his peers and his coach.

572
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,458
- What's he weigh right now?

573
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,791
- Same as your son,
125 during the season,

574
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,875
then drops down to
one 119 for sections.

575
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:24,125
- He looks a little
small for 125.

576
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,375
- He's under, but that's
besides the point.

577
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,583
- He's under?

578
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:34,416
This is Thurman Ellis, Jr.,
most of you already know him,

579
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,125
for those of you who don't,
two times state champion.

580
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,708
Tell everybody what it's
like to be a state champ.

581
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,333
- Yeah, it's an amazing
feeling, you know,

582
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,416
it's indescribable really.

583
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:54,125
You put so much time and
effort into it and for what?

584
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:57,875
Six minutes, but I'm telling
you, guys, it's worthwhile.

585
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,750
- This is what it's all about,
guys, this is the real deal.

586
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:05,291
I'd rather have one
state champion in my room

587
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,458
than 12 runners up,
you can play football,

588
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,875
you can play basketball, but
you can't play wrestling.

589
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:11,750
- What's next to
have no pleasure?

590
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,500
- You guys all know how
it works around here.

591
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,708
The rules are anybody
can challenge for
a slot on the team,

592
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,416
provided their weight's
in the ballpark.

593
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:23,458
You also know the
winner gets a slot.

594
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,791
Johnny, front and center.

595
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:28,291
Can you make 119 by Friday?

596
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,833
- Yeah.

597
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,750
- I told you my son wrestles
125 during the regular season.

598
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,666
- And I told you I gotta
do what's best for the team

599
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,708
to win on Friday.

600
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,625
You ready?
- I'm always ready.

601
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,291
- How about you?
- Let's go.

602
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,583
- Roger, you keep time.

603
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:44,666
Guys, spread out,
give them the mats.

604
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:45,791
Frank, you take this.

605
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:52,833
- Okay, guys, toes on the line.

606
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:53,708
Shake hands.

607
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,750
Ready, Roger?
- Ready.

608
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:57,541

Two.

00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,500
[wrestlers grunting]
One, two.

[whistle tooting]

613
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,541
- [Johnny] My wrist! [groaning]

614
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:16,208
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Coach, Coach.

615
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,833
- Let me see, where's it hurt?

616
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,083
All right, come on,
let's get out here.

617
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,458
- Coach, I swear
it was an accident.

618
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,166
- It's okay, come on, let's go.

619
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:26,000
- [Thurman] I'm sorry, Johnny.

620
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,833
- 22 seconds.

621
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,875
- Ed, you got a second?
- No, I don't,

622
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,666
can't you see I got a hurt boy?

623
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,208
- How's Johnny?

624
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,666
- [Ed] He broke his arm.

625
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,916
You look puffy,
how's your weight?

626
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,625
- I haven't checked.

627
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,416
- [Ed] Let's check.

628
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:51,500
- I'm dressed.

629
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:54,083
- Get on the scale.

630
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,250

[weights clicking]

632
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,708
You're four over, what happened?

633
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,458
- I don't know.

634
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,375
[Leo sighing]

635
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,583
- You don't know?

636
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,625
- No, I don't know.

637
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:20,625
All this weight, it's
not coming off anymore.

638
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:22,083
- Lose because you can't win,

639
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,666
not because you
can't make weight.

640
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:26,166
You wanna go to Oklahoma or not?

641
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,083
- Yeah, I guess.

642
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,750
- What do you mean, you guess?

643
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:30,833
- Yeah, it's cool.

644
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,666
- We're talking a
full boater here,

645
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,875
all you can say is you guess?

646
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,666
- What are you getting
so pissed off about?

647
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:37,125
- Where do I start?

648
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,875
You were a quarter pound
over at weigh-ins last match,

649
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,541
you almost let the
whole team down.

650
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,083
- I made it.
- You always make it.

651
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,625
You can't keep working out 20
minutes before every match,

652
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,750
you're not gonna have the
juice to win, you know that.

653
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,250
- I won, okay.

654
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,291
- If you don't want Oklahoma,
I want to know right now.

655
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,583
- Come on, Dad.

656
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,000
- No, you come on, you
won districts twice,

657
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:59,333
big deal, that means
nothing, that's local guys.

658
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:02,666
You get to regionals and
states, I've been there,

659
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:03,666
we're talking real wrestlers,

660
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:05,791
that's a whole different world.

661
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,250
We're talking about guys who
got nothing better to do,

662
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,625
but to train five,
six hours a day,

663
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:13,916
guys who think like champions
two, three, four moves ahead.

664
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,666
No, they know what they want,
they don't have to guess.

665
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:21,375
You got an opportunity
here, don't blow it,

666
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:24,833
you'll be nothing
without a college degree.

667
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:33,500
[Leo sighing]

668
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,166
- [sighing] What about you?

669
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:39,750
- What about me?

670
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:44,708
You wanna work at the coal
fields for the next 20 years?

671
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,041
You wanna be stuck in some
dead end job, labor job,

672
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:50,916
because you don't have
a college education?

673
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,958
If that's what you
want, quit high school.

674
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,541
Is that what you want?

675
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:57,708
- No.

676
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,333
- Then you'd better
get your shit together

677
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:00,791
and start acting
like a champion.

678
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:02,750
If you don't wanna work, quit,

679
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,083
but if you're gonna play,
you finish, you got it?

680
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,291
- Yeah.

681
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,166
- What?
- Yeah, I got it.

682
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:11,041
- [Ed] Good.

683
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,416
[Leo sighing]

684
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:24,541
- Does this have something
to do with Ellis Jr.?

685
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,750
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

686
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:29,625
Everybody knows I should've
wrestled him, not Johnny.

687
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,333
- Everybody?
- Yeah.

688
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,583
- You wanna coach the team now?

689
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,125
- No, I don't wanna
coach the team.

690
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,166
- Listen to me, you
worry about your weight,

691
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,583
I'll worry about the team.

692
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,333
You got four pounds to lose,
how do you expect to do that?

693
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,875
Get in the car, I'm
taking you to the Barn.

- Hi, Leo, how are you?
- Pretty good.

703
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,958
- I wanted to see if
he could come train.

704
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,708
He's already lost 10, he's
got four more, he hit a wall.

You know that last four, Jerry.

706

always in your head, son,

every pound I've lost,

I'd buy a new car.

know it's hard.

We know we're your favorites,

869
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:23,833
[Leo vomiting]

870
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,416
[Leo coughing]

871
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,833
- Hey, I told you you
should've had a power bar.

872
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,458
Yeah, you don't listen to me.

873
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,208
Anyways, there's tons of
chicks out in the stands,

874
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,458
we're gonna get laid
tonight, I can feel it.

875
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,833
[Leo coughing]

876
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:36,166
Man, you'd better get your
head out of the toilet.

877
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,916
[crowd shouting]

878
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:49,458
[crowd shouting continues]

879
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,500
- [Cheerleaders] T-R-I
and N-I-T-Y, go Trinity!

880
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:59,750
T-R-I and N-I-T-Y, go Trinity!

881
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:03,375
[crowd shouting]

882
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:06,625
- Go three, go three!

883
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:09,666
[crowd shouting]

884
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:10,708
Still green.

885
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:14,208
One, two, three, four!

886
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,458
[crowd applauding and cheering]

887
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,208
[crowd shouting]

888
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:28,541
- [Crowd] Trinity,
Trinity, Trinity!

889
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,875
Trinity, Trinity, Trinity!

890
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:35,500
Trinity, Trinity, Trinity!

891
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:37,000
[crowd shouting]

892
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:39,250
Trinity, Trinity, Trinity!

893
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:43,375
[crowd shouting]

894
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:53,750
[crowd shouting continues]

895
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:00,958
[buzzer blasting]

896
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
[crowd applauding and cheering]

897
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,583
- Okay, guys, shake hands.

898
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:13,625
[crowd applauding and cheering]

899
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,250
[Shaw sighing]

900
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,708
- Hey.
- How you doing?

901
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,666
- Good, how are you?
- All right.

902
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,958
- You looked really
good tonight.

903
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,750
- [Leo] No, I sucked.

904
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:33,583
- You won.

905
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,250
- I was weak.

906
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:38,875
I think I ate too
much before the match.

907
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:39,958
[Shaw laughing softly]

908
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,166
- Hey, Leo.

909
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:43,708
Come on, we're
gonna miss the bus.

910
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,291
- I got a ride.

911
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,291
- Don't be out too late.

912
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,666
- So what happened
with your dad?

913
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,625
I thought you weren't
coming tonight.

914
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:02,000
- Yeah, I wasn't going to,

915
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:04,708
but he had to give a
lecture at Cambridge.

916
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,708
- I wish I'd known
you were coming.

917
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:08,833
- Why?

918
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:14,916
- I don't know, it's just, you
know, if I'd have known, I-

919
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,166
- You'd what?

920
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:19,750
- Oh, you know, if I'd
known you were there,

921
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:21,916
it'd have given me strength.

922
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:23,625
- Really?
- Yeah.

923
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,791
- Hey, have you ever
gotten high before?

924
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:30,875
- No.

925
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:33,541
- No, [laughs] I would really
like to see you stoned.

926
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,250
- Yeah, it's just if anybody
on the team found out,

927
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,750
I could get thrown off.

928
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,625
- [Shaw] Would that really
be such a bad thing?

929
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:42,583
- Yeah, that's all I care about.

930
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:46,833
- Wow, I feel really
sorry for you.

931
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:50,000
- Well, you know,
I'm sure I could find

932
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:53,375
at least one other
thing I care about.

933
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:56,375
[soft guitar music]

934
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:57,208
What?

935
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:01,166
- I don't know, it's
just sometimes, you know,

936
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:04,625
you can be so
strong in your mind.

937
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:07,416
You get that from
your mom or your dad?

938
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:08,708
- I don't know.

939
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:12,416
- You know, tonight,
I was listening in

940
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,833
on this conversation,
these girls from Trinity,

941
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:17,125
where they were all
talking about you.

942
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:18,708
- What did they say?

943
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,833
- You know, how cute you are

944
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:23,625
and how they hope you kick
this guy's ass, [laughing]

945
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,125
which you did, by the way.

946
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:29,083
I don't know, it just
kind of made me proud,

947
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:30,750
'cause you were my boyfriend.

948
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:35,333
- Is that what I
am, your boyfriend?

949
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:39,750
- Well, that's how
it's shaping up, yeah.

950
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
[soft guitar music]

951
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:53,125
[cicadas chirping]

952
00:48:56,708 --> 00:49:00,916
[train horn blasting
in distance]

953
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,791
- [Leo] So you come here a lot?

954
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:09,666
- [Shaw] Only when I need
a little perspective.

955
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:10,500
- On what?

956
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,875
- Life, death, that,
that sort of thing.

957
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:18,166
- I'm gonna come by sometime,
meet your groovy mom.

958
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:20,583
- Yeah, groovy, baby. [laughing]

959
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,750
You know, there's a kegger
at Two Mile Run this weekend.

960
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:25,791
- Really?
- Yeah, let's go.

961
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:28,041
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

962
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,666
Hey, you know, my
mom gave me money

963
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:33,041
to get a hotel room
for us. [laughing]

964
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,541
- Are you kidding me?

965
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,125
- No, I'm serious.

966
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:39,625
She knows everyone's gonna
be drinking and everything,

967
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:41,833
she thinks we should
just stay the night.

968
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,833
- You mean like sleep together?

969
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:49,625
- Come on, wrestling boy, who
said anything about sleeping?

970
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:53,291
Show me some of those
moves, come on. [laughing]

971
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:56,000
So are we gonna go?

972
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:58,541
- Hell, yeah!

973
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:00,000
[Shaw laughing]

974
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:04,250
[train horn blasting
in distance]

975
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,708
- You got stuff all
over you, come on.

976
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,666
- [Jessica] Ed, look who's here.

977
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:14,666
- Hey, Larry.
- Hey, Ed.

978
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:15,958
How you doing?
- How you doing?

979
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,750
- Hey, Uncle Larry.
- Is that little Leo?

980
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:18,000
[Leo laughing]

981
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:20,083
Wow, man, you've grown
like a weed, boy.

982
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,708
- Yeah.

983
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,083
- He's here for some radio
thing up in Pittsburgh.

984
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:24,541
I told him he
could stay with us.

985
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:26,833
- That's great,
where's he gonna sleep?

986
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:28,375
[Larry sighing]

987
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,625
- [Jessica] Tell everyone
all about the radio.

988
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:32,416
Your uncle is number one
in Los Angeles again.

989
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:33,916
- Number one what?

990
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:37,666
- DJ, I do a afternoon show
on the Mighty Met, KMET.

991
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:40,333
You know what a DJ is?
- Yeah.

992
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:41,875
- What?
- Someone who plays music.

993
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:44,791
- That's right, you know, it's
the number one rock station

994
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,833
in the country right now.

995
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:47,666
- It must be a pretty cool job?

996
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:49,708
- Yeah, it's cool, you know,
we play a bunch of commercials,

997
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,875
but every now and then we get
to sneak in a record or two.

998
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:54,041
What kind of music do you like?

999
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:56,458
- Zeppelin, The Doors, The Who.

1000
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,833
- The Who?

1001
00:50:57,875 --> 00:51:00,125
- That's right, you like
all that old stuff, huh?

1002
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:02,083
You know, if parents
would just relax

1003
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,291
and listen to a little
Who and the Cheap Trick,

1004
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,708
then this whole generation
gap would be over.

1005
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,250
- Can I be excused?

1006
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:12,166
- No, you may not, eat,
your Uncle Larry's here.

1007
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,625
- It's okay, hun, he
doesn't have to eat.

1008
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:16,500
- Seriously, Mom, I already ate.

1009
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:18,916
- Please just eat a
little bit for me?

1010
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:20,833
- Jessica, he's in training.

1011
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:24,625
- Look at my son, Larry, look
at him, he's skin and bones.

1012
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:26,791
He's starving to death
for some stupid game,

1013
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,791
that doesn't mean
anything to anyone.

1014
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:31,791
Tell him what you told me,
what you said about wrestling.

1015
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:32,916
- Jesse, whoa.

1016
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,125
- Tell him what you
said about sports,

1017
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:36,083
how he's teaching my
son to become violent

1018
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:38,666
and showing him like tribes do.

1019
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:41,166
- What are you talking about?

1020
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:43,000
- I-I said nothing about tribes,

1021
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:45,208
I said, the only thing I said
is I'm out of the sports thing

1022
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,958
a long time ago, you know.

1023
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,083
I said that the team thing
was like tribal warfare,

1024
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:52,000
you know, fighting
over a little ball

1025
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:53,583
in a few yards of grass,

1026
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,458
it just makes no sense
to me, that's all.

1027
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,916
It's my opinion.
- Tell him what you said

1028
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:59,875
about how he's teaching
my son how to kill.

1029
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,166
- To kill?

1030
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:02,791
- It's passive
killing, you know,

1031
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:05,791
I mean, the intent is
there, the purpose is there.

1032
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:08,750
You know that, Ed, to defeat?

1033
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:11,208
Come on, it just seems like
to me, it's another way

1034
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,625
to teach our young kids
how to kill each other,

1035
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:16,625
you know, keep them sharp
in case they need them.

1036
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:17,875
- To keep who?

1037
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:19,833
- Hey, look at the news,
man, the only difference

1038
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:22,625
between football and
war are the uniforms.

1039
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:24,166
- And the guns, Larry.

1040
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:27,166
- Yeah, and the guns, but
a football player had guns

1041
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:29,500
and there were landmines
in the end zone,

1042
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:32,041
then there wouldn't
have been a Vietnam.

1043
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,208
Am I making any sense to you?

1044
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,791
- No.

1045
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:36,916
- No, that's good.

1046
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:40,833
[birds chirping]

1047
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,625
- So Larry, what do you
wanna be when you grow up?

1048
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:50,791
- [laughs] Ah, a
wrestling coach, Ed.

1049
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,041
[no audio]

1050
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:04,666
[birds chirping]

1051
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:06,666
What's up, Leo?

1052
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:08,583
- Not much.

1053
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:09,833
- Is everything okay in there?

1054
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:10,916
- [Leo] Yeah.

1055
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:13,750
- You want a beer?

1056
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:14,791
- Yeah, sure.

1057
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:20,125
- Man, if your dad could
see you now, he'd kill me.

1058
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:21,791
- Why isn't he like you?

1059
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:25,500
- Who knows, man, maybe
I remind him of too much.

1060
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:26,750
- Too much of what?

1061
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,666
- You know, the
past, life, freedom,

1062
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:31,458
all that shit he never got.

1063
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:35,958
I mean, there's a whole
world out there, man.

1064
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:40,416
- Yeah, I guess.

1065
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:42,708
- [Larry] So why
are you doing this?

1066
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,750
- Doing what?

1067
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:48,833
- Wrestling, starving yourself,
staying in this town, why?

1068
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,416
- If I stick it out,
I got a scholarship

1069
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:52,708
waiting for me at OU.

1070
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,833
- Then what, I mean,
what do you wanna learn?

1071
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,750
[train horn blasting
in distance]

1072
00:53:57,791 --> 00:54:00,291
Has anybody ever asked
you what you wanted, Leo?

1073
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:03,750
- I guess I never
really thought about it,

1074
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:05,791
just figured it was
my only way out.

1075
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:07,750
- You know your mom and
me didn't exactly have

1076
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:10,666
a "Leave It to Beaver"
home life either.

1077
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:12,250
I ran away when I was 16.

1078
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,958
I was lost for a long time,
man, but I turned out.

1079
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,958
Look, [sighing]

1080
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,708
what I'm about to tell you, man,

1081
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,000
I mean, I'll probably
never be able

1082
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,833
to step foot in
this house again.

1083
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:31,750
Man, you're a good
kid and I love you.

1084
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:35,833
You got a family situation
here, man and you gotta get out.

1085
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:40,875
There's a whole world out there,
there's nothing here, man.

1086
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:48,958
What you need is options and
if you, if you got no options,

1087
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,625
no matter where you
turn, it looks good,

1088
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:54,791
I mean, even if it's
just another trap.

1089
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,583
You ever need me, you call me.

1090
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:00,958
Hell, you could even come to LA,

1091
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,375
I could get you a little
job at the radio station.

1092
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:04,875
- You could do that?

1093
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:08,083
- I am number one
drive time in LA.

1094
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,375
- Yeah, that sounds cool, radio.

1095
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:14,166
- It's just an option, man.

1096
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:18,541
Think about it, give
it some thought.

1097
00:55:21,166 --> 00:55:22,375
Man, I'm outta here.

1098
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:23,833
- I thought you were
staying with us.

1099
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:26,083
- Yeah, I got a nice big
hotel room in Pittsburgh

1100
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:29,375
waiting on me, I
ain't staying here,

1101
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:31,416
reminds me too much of home.

1102
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,083
Give me a hug, man.

1103
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,833
[train horn blasting
in distance]

1104
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:36,791
Take care.
- All right, you too.

1105
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,875
- Okay.

1106
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:44,250
[Leo vomiting]

1107
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:46,291
[Leo spitting]

1108
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,708
[Leo vomiting]

1109
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,666
[Leo spitting]

1110
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:54,416
[Leo coughing]

1111
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,291
- Okay, guys, regular
season's finally over.

1112
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:03,583
You guys did a good job, all
of you, you should be proud.

1113
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,458
But now the real work begins,

1114
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,875
we only got two weeks
to train for sections.

1115
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:14,666
For you seniors,
Leo, Roger, Joey,

1116
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,833
this is your last
shot, this is it, guys.

1117
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,916
I want everybody to
look around the room.

1118
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:27,916
No, take a good look.

1119
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:31,791
Same time, next month, half
your buddies will be gone.

1120
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:35,708
The rest of you,
the toughest ones,

1121
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,916
the ones who train the hardest,

1122
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:42,166
the ones who sacrifice the
most will move on to districts.

1123
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:46,708
Out of that, maybe
one or two of you

1124
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,375
will make it to regionals.

1125
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:51,875
That's when the college
scouts come sniffing around

1126
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:54,708
giving you gifts,
making promises,

1127
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,291
that's when the real
wrestling starts, guys.

1128
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:01,708
[door clicking]

1129
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:10,916
But no matter how far
any of you guys get,

1130
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:14,333
no matter what happens
for the rest of your life,

1131
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,583
you could look in
the mirror and say,

1132
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:19,250
that you did not fail
because you tried.

1133
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:22,916
But most importantly, guys,
through this whole experience,

1134
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:25,000
you'll have the stuff
to go out in the world

1135
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,708
and achieve your goals in life,

1136
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,375
that's the big
picture here, boys.

1137
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:34,916
Thanks, you guys
are a good team.

1138
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:39,875
- My boy has got
something to say.

1139
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:45,708
- Coach, I just
wanted to apologize

1140
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,750
for the other
night at the match.

1141
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:52,083
I realize I let everybody
down, you, my dad, my team,

1142
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,875
I even let myself down.

1143
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:57,000
I just want you to know it
wasn't for a lack of effort,

1144
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,625
I really tried.

1145
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:00,708
I've been working my ass
off to get down to weight

1146
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:05,500
and I'm growing, I'm getting
bigger, it's getting tougher,

1147
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:08,708
but I promise you, it
won't happen again.

1148
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,750
- It's okay, sit
down with your team.

1149
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,791
Everybody makes mistakes.

1150
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:15,541
- When can we do the
elimination match?

1151
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:16,916
- [Ed] I don't know.

1152
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:21,125
- Any reason why
we can't do it now?

1153
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,083
- No, not today.

1154
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,791
- Why not?
- Because I said so.

1155
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:28,666
- Is that a good reason?

1156
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:30,916
- This is my mat.

1157
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:35,583
I say who gets on my mat and
when and with who and why?

1158
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:39,083
- You know, I shouldn't be
talking to an assistant coach,

1159
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:42,416
maybe I need to talk
to what's his name?

1160
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,208
Mr. Blosswell.

1161
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,791
- You go ahead and talk to Ted,

1162
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:48,000
I'll tell you what I tell
everybody, you want my job,

1163
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,666
come and take my mat.

1164
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,250
- When can we do it?

1165
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,958
- Monday, that
gives them a week.

1166
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:57,333
- Fine.
- I wasn't talking to you.

1167
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:58,833
Is that okay with you?

1168
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:00,916
- [Thurman Jr.] It's
fine with me, Coach.

1169
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,250
- How about you?

1170
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:03,750
You guys can make
weight on Monday?

1171
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:05,875
Okay.

1172
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:06,666
- Good, good.

1173

[door thudding]

1177
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:25,750
- Hey, Leo.

1178
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,416
[water sloshing]

1179
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,708
- Why did he call
you Assistant Coach?

1180
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,291
- 'Cause that's what I am.

1181
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:42,875
- Who's the Head Coach?

1182
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:43,750
- Mr. Blasswell.

1183
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:45,416
- English teacher?

1184
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,708
- Yeah.

1185
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,916

[soft piano music]

1189
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,833
The truth is I had to
beg him to get that job.

1190
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:18,666
I went to school with half
of them and it didn't matter.

1191
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:20,708
Nobody cares about used-to-bes,

1192
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,500
that's why I'm
always telling you,

1193
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:24,541
what you start, you
have to finish, Leo.

1194
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,000
Truth is, I couldn't
be Head Coach,

1195
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:29,708
no matter how many trophies
or state titles I won.

1196
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,958
- Why?

1197
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,666
- 'Cause I don't have
a college degree.

1198
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:36,833
- But Mr. Blasswell hasn't
been to a single practice.

1199
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:38,666
- And that's how
we both like it,

1200
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,708
I get to coach,
he gets the check.

1201
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:42,541
- So you don't get paid?

1202
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:44,208
- I get something
better than money,

1203
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,875
I get to send my son to college.

1204
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:50,166

[background people chattering]

1208
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:12,000
- Yeah, I know.
[both laughing]

1209
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:15,083
- Leo, what's up, man?

1210
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:16,750
- What's he doing here?

1211
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:19,333
- Oh, we're just having
a smoke, that's all.

1212
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,833
- I wasn't talking to you.

1213
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:23,333
- He just bummed a
cigarette, it's no big deal.

1214
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,833
- Oh, really, no big deal, huh?

1215
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:26,958
What were you laughing at?
- What?

1216
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,208
- You were laughing at
something, what's so funny?

1217
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,583
Is he a funny guy?

1218
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,666
- We were you
laughing at you, Leo.

1219
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:33,750
- Shut up.

1220
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:35,375
No, we weren't.

1221
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:36,875
- Yeah, yeah, we were,

1222
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:38,583
we were talking about what
a little pussy you are,

1223
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:41,125
you know, Daddy's little
boy, all that shit.

1224
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:42,791
- Really?
- No, that's right.

1225
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:43,833
- No, stop.

1226
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,291
Stop it, just go, please.

1227
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:48,708
- First your daddy saves your
ass, now your girlfriend.

1228
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:49,958
One day, you're
gonna have to learn

1229
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,625
how to fight your own battles

1230
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,708
and I promise you, I'll
be there when you do you.

1231
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,875
- You know what?
- You'd better be.

1232
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:54,916
- Go, please.
- No, no, no, it's fine,

1233
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:56,583
it's fine, we'll
finish it later.

1234
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,666
Don't worry about it.

1235
01:01:57,708 --> 01:01:58,750
- [Shaw] Stop.

1236
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
- You shouldn't have done that.

1237
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:05,250
- Done what, Leo, what did I do?

1238
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:08,250
- You know what you did, I
don't need your help, alright.

1239
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,416
- You need somebody's help.

1240
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:12,875
Look at you, you look like shit.

1241
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:15,708
What'd you eat today?

1242
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:16,708
- Breakfast.

1243
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,666
- [Shaw] What did you have?

1244
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:19,875
- Stuff.

1245
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:21,791
- What kind of stuff?

1246
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:23,208
- I don't know, who cares?

1247
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,375
- You don't know?

1248
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:29,041
[sighing] What?

1249
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:31,666
What?

1250
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:35,666
- I don't know, just, [sighing].

1251
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:37,875
Forget it, who cares?
Don't worry about it.

1252
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:38,708
- Tell me.

1253
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,875
- I don't know, it's just,

1254
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,750
you know, I dreamed
this, you know.

1255
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:50,000
- What, this?
- Yeah, this,

1256
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:52,708
this fighting, you know,
this fighting in the halls.

1257
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,541
You know what I mean? It's just-

1258
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:57,875
- [Shaw] No, Leo, I
don't know what you mean.

1259
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:02,958
- I dreamed of me and
you, we were a couple

1260
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,291
and just keep on fighting
and bickering, you know.

1261
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:07,208
- I don't get it.

1262
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,250
- [Leo] You don't get what?

1263
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,208
- I mean, I get it, why
weren't you imagining us

1264
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:15,250
in the back seat of your
dad's car or something?

1265
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,083
I mean, why fighting?

1266
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:20,333
- I don't know, I guess, I just,

1267
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,750
I mean, if we were fighting,

1268
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:24,666
it means I care
about you, you know.

1269
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:29,875
- You're truly weird,
do you know that?

1270
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:31,833
- Really?

1271
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,458
- Yes, really.

1272
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:40,166
- It's only five pounds.

1273
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:44,750
You still wanna quit?

1274
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:49,250
[Leo sighing]

1275
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:51,708
I'm really proud of you.

1276
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,208
I mean that.

1277
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,541
- I can't get it off anymore.

1278
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,541
- Sure you can.

1279
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,791
This is what it takes
to be a champion.

1280
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:05,958
- What if I don't
wanna be a champion?

1281
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,708
- What kind of question is that?

1282
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,625
You might as well ask yourself,

1283
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,375
what if you don't wanna breathe?

1284
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:14,666
Come on, that's fear talking,
that's a quitter's question.

1285
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:17,208
Four more years and
your future's wide open,

1286
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,708
you can't quit now.

1287
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,708
What do you wanna do,
do you wanna quit?

1288
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,708
If there was a
shortcut, we'd take it,

1289
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,750
this is the only way I know.

1290
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,333
I'm sorry.

1291
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,125
It's only five pounds.

1292
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:49,666
[river gushing]

1293
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:52,625
- Dad phoned last
night, he says, "Hi."

1294
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:54,166
You know, I talk
about you so much,

1295
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,375
it's like he already
knows you already.

1296
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,916
He said the summer
after graduation,

1297
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:01,750
he might fly us
out to visit him.

1298
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:03,208
- [Leo] That'd be cool.

1299
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:07,875
- Yeah, I'm gonna
travel after graduation.

1300
01:05:07,916 --> 01:05:10,375
I'm pretty sure that's
why my dad's so smart,

1301
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:12,416
I mean, he's experienced
every culture,

1302
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:14,291
you know, been on
every continent.

1303
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,208
Hey, are you okay?

1304
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:25,416
- Look, Shaw, I can't take
you to that keg party tonight.

1305
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:27,416
- What?

1306
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,125
- I gotta train.

1307
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:35,791
- All weekend?

1308
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:38,750
- 'Cause I have to
lose five more pounds

1309
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:41,791
and I only have two
and a half days.

1310
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,833
- Leo, what about
our night together?

1311
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:49,500
You know, sharing the same
bed for the first time,

1312
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:51,958
waking up to a new day
just the two of us.

1313
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:56,333
- Look, I wanna be with
you, okay, I really do,

1314
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:58,625
just not tonight.

1315
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:00,708
- You know, I really
can't believe this.

1316
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,666
- I'm sorry, Shaw.

1317
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:07,625
These new weight classes,
it's getting harder.

1318
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:11,041
- So we won't eat
or drink anything,

1319
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,416
I mean, we'll just hang
out, the two of us.

1320
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:14,958
- I'm not gonna have the time,

1321
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,541
I've gotta train
day and night, okay.

1322
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:20,708
There's gonna be other nights.

1323
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,083
- Yeah, maybe there won't.

1324
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,291
- What's that supposed to mean?

1325
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:28,125
- Okay, so then you beat
him, right, then what?

1326
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:31,666
Then it's two more
months of starving.

1327
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,833
Then it's four years
of college wrestling,

1328
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:35,791
which is four more years, Leo,

1329
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:37,625
that's four more
years of starving

1330
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:39,708
and denying yourself
of everything.

1331
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:42,916
How can you live like that?

1332
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,875
You know, it's like a sickness.

1333
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:47,750
- I can quit any time I want.

1334
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:49,166
- Right.

1335
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:51,375
You know, that's what my
mom says about her drinking.

1336
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:58,875
You know, you're always talking
about what you have to do,

1337
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:01,666
it's never what you wanna do.

1338
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:04,833
What do you wanna do?

1339
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:06,958
I mean, what do you really want?

1340
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:09,166
- I want you.

1341
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:13,666
- Prove it to me, come, please.

1342
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:17,166
- Come on, Shaw,
don't do this to me.

1343
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:19,833
[river gushing]

1344
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:21,291
- You know, Leo,

1345
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,166
I love you, okay,

1346
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,083
I really do,

1347
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:30,750
but you don't have time for me.

1348
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:34,333
You don't even have
time for yourself.

1349
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:39,833
You're too busy trying
to be your dad's hero.

1350
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:48,083
Call me when you stop
training and start living.

1351
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,875
[river gushing]

1352
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:58,333
[mellow melodic music]

1353
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:01,250
- [Jerry] You can do this
thing, heck, I've done it,

1354
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:03,458
your dad's done it, it's simple.

1355
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,708
Your body is 90% water, so
there's a lot of water in there,

1356
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,083
look how fat you are.

1357
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,958
Once you drop that water weight,

1358
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,833
your body's gonna go through
a period of adjustment,

1359
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:13,833
you'll settle down, you're
gonna get a burst of energy

1360
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:15,875
from that adjustment.

1361
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:18,291
That energy is gonna go
in to repair and rebuild,

1362
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:21,625
you're gonna steal that energy
just like robbing a bank.

1363
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:23,750
It's simple, it all
has to do with timing,

1364
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:25,375
timing is everything.

1365
01:08:25,416 --> 01:08:27,750
Don't lift any weights now,
you don't have the time

1366
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:29,833
and it isn't gonna do
you any good anyway.

1367
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:33,625
What you gotta do is run,
sweat, drink a little water,

1368
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:36,083
run, sweat, drink
a little water,

1369
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:38,208
run, sweat, weigh-in.

1370
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,458
No sugar, no junk food.

1371
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:44,041
20 minutes before your match,

1372
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:46,208
you take two
tablespoons of honey,

1373
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,875
glass of Gatorade,
a little glucose.

1374
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,791
When that honey and that
juice hits your bloodstream,

1375
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:54,750
your cells are gonna
come alive, energize,

1376
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:56,166
all vying for sustenance,

1377
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:58,500
that's when you're
gonna rob the bank.

[construction machinery

1550
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:45,166
- Hi.

1551
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:51,500
Is this 104 Prospect?

1552
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:55,208
- It's 104.

1553
01:22:56,916 --> 01:22:57,916
- [Leo] Miss Ashland?

1554
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:00,916
- Who are you?

1555
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:03,625
- I'm Leo.

1556
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:07,208
I was a friend of Shaw's.

1557
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:09,833
- Oh.

1558
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:13,750
Hi.

1559
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:17,000
- I just came by
to say I'm sorry.

1560
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:19,583
- You knew her well?

1561
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:24,583
- Yeah.

1562
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:25,541
- I didn't,

1563
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:31,750
at least not in the
last five years.

1564
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:37,833
I don't know, ever
since her dad died.

1565
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:39,833
- Her dad died?

1566
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:43,166
- Come here.

1567
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:55,500
Can you tell me

1568
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:56,333
who Shaw was?

1569
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,333
Can you just

1570
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:02,916
tell me about her?

1571
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:07,458
- She's beautiful.

1572
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:12,083
Sweet.

1573
01:24:14,041 --> 01:24:14,833
Fragile.

1574
01:24:17,875 --> 01:24:21,208
Yeah, she really
cared about people

1575
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,791
and she put you first.

1576
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:27,208
She taught me a lot.

1577
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,791
She taught me to take life

1578
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:33,750
not so seriously.

1579
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:39,416
She's a free spirit.

1580
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:44,708
- Yeah, she was, she
was a free spirit.

1581
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:47,291
So was her dad.

1582
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:55,666
Did she have a lot of friends?

1583
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,208
- Everybody loved her.

1584
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:00,208
- Yeah?

1585
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:06,791
How'd she do in school?

1586
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:11,625
- Straight A's.

1587

[Mrs. Ashland laughing]

1588
01:25:13,916 --> 01:25:14,791

1589
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:19,750
I didn't know that. [laughing]

[Mrs. Ashland sobbing]

1591
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:34,833
You loved her, didn't you?

1592
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:41,583
- I still do.

1593
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:44,166

- [Leo] What's it say?

1616
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:51,166
- What's it say? First
place, 45 pounds.

1617
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:52,708
You win one of these,

1618
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,750
huge pizza party with
all your friends.

1619
01:28:54,791 --> 01:28:57,875
You even get your picture in
the paper, how's that sound?

1620
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:00,083
- Good.

1621
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:01,708
- That's your trophy.

1622
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:04,166
You want it?

1623
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:05,083
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

1624
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:06,791
You wanna see second place?

1625
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:07,583

Hey, Ted, how you doing?

1640
01:30:46,666 --> 01:30:50,333
Ted, I don't know if you
met Thurman Ellis Sr.?

1641
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:52,875
- Ted Blasswell, of
course, how are you doing?

1642
01:30:52,916 --> 01:30:55,500
- You too, I'm sorry I
didn't catch your last name.

1643
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:57,625
- Oh, Thurman Ellis.
- Ellis.

1644
01:30:57,666 --> 01:30:59,875
- We met at a PTA meeting
a couple of weeks ago.

1645
01:30:59,916 --> 01:31:00,875
- Yes, of course.

1646
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:02,333
- I thought Ted should be here,

1647
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:04,375
so there's no misunderstandings.

1648
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:06,166
- Oh yeah, that's fine with us.

1649
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:08,166
- Great, you wanna
referee, Coach?

1650
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:10,833
- No, Coach Leone, be my guest.

1651
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:13,375
- You got it. All right,
guys, let's clear the mats.

1652
01:31:14,541 --> 01:31:15,541
Leo, Ellis, come on.

1653
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:21,041
You guys know the gig,
three two-minute periods.

1654
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:23,750
Frank, keep score time for me.

1655

guys, shake hands.

1679

- It's all yours, man, take it.

1680
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,791
- I don't want it anymore.

1681
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:55,208
You can have it.

1682
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:57,375
- [Ed] What did you say?

1683
01:33:57,416 --> 01:34:00,416

in it anymore, Dad.

- Morning.

1689
01:34:27,833 --> 01:34:29,416
- Good morning.

1690
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:31,666
- Where'd you get the milk?

1691
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:34,458
- Stole it from the Reinhardt's

1692
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,833
- You stole it?

1693
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:37,958
- I've been stealing
it for years.

1694
01:34:39,416 --> 01:34:40,833
No offense, but I can't stand

1695
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:43,750
that powdered shit
you always buy.

1696
01:34:43,791 --> 01:34:48,791
- So how you doing,
you all right?

1697
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,708
- Shaw told me her
mom knew all about me,

1698
01:34:56,958 --> 01:34:58,750
that she wanted to meet me.

1699
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:04,333
She told me a lot of
things, they were all lies.

1700
01:35:06,166 --> 01:35:08,875
Why do people who are
supposed to love each other

1701
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:10,333
always have to hurt each other?

1702
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:19,333
[chair creaking]

1703
01:35:19,375 --> 01:35:21,375

[milk pouring]

1705
01:35:25,458 --> 01:35:29,833
- They don't do it on purpose,
not even the worst ones,

1706
01:35:29,875 --> 01:35:31,458
not even your mother.

1707
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:36,916
I think it's the only
way they've got to
show you they hurt.

1708
01:35:39,583 --> 01:35:42,208
You know, I went out with
your mother for over a year

1709
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,875
before I ever met her parents.

1710
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:49,791
One Valentine's Day, when
I was still in high school,

1711
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:51,375
I drove over to her house,

1712
01:35:51,416 --> 01:35:53,958
she lived right over
there on Bissol Avenue.

1713
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Got some flowers, knocked on
her door, nobody answered,

1714
01:36:00,166 --> 01:36:02,875
so I went around back
and there she was,

1715
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:04,666
in the backyard, crying.

1716
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:09,166
Her mother had beat her
with the garden hose,

1717
01:36:09,208 --> 01:36:11,708
then hit her in the head
with the brass nozzle in.

1718
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:14,708
- Why?

1719
01:36:17,416 --> 01:36:19,041
- For not making
homecoming court.

1720
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,458
- What did you do?

1721
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:30,291
- I took her in and
10 months later,

1722
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:32,416
we had a kid and it was you.

1723
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:41,583
- Do you love her?
