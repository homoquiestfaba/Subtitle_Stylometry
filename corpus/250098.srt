1
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,878
Get out! Get out of the way!

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,888
-I have his coat.
-Open the door!

3
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,356
Get out of the way! Get out!

4
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,326
I told you, I have his coat.

5
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,431
Yes, sir. I'll report.

6
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,001
Come on, get out of the way!
Get back!

7
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:19,441
-Hey, get lost! Fuck off!
-Easy, easy.

8
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:37,756
Get back! Get out of the way!

9
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,666
Easy, easy!

10
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,273
There isn't enough room
for everyone!

11
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,968
-I'm a doctor!
-What's the matter with you?

12
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:55,377
-Easy, Rose! Give me that!
-Be quiet!

13
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,210
Use the stairway!

14
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,592
Nurse!

15
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,442
You can't get away from me!

16
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,846
We caught the rabbit!

17
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:44,740
ELECT LEM NlKODlNOSKl
FOR A SAFE FUTURE

18
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,308
Damn, damn me.

19
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,578
It seems Iike a thousand years
have passed since then.

20
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,022
My name is Lem,
Lem Nikodinoski.

21
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,293
When I was 12
I signed my name "M. "

22
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,060
I couldn't remember
the Ietter "L. "

23
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,227
It reminded me
of something very bad.

24
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:11,871
Comrade soldier,
whom should I call?

25
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,065
Comrade soldier,
whom should I call?

26
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,605
How should I know?

27
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,040
Call whomever you want.
Just be quick.

28
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,281
It was the summer of 1945,

29
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,478
the first summer
after the war.

30
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,916
We were a bunch of hungry,
dirty children without a home.

31
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,391
Branded orphans
and hunted Iike wild animals.

32
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:41,265
Hunted by soldiers
and all sorts of do-gooders.

33
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,203
Ariton is coming!

34
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,958
What did you say, you louse?

35
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,629
Get up!

36
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,530
-Stand straight, bastard!
-Swine!

37
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,424
T o your left!

38
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,490
T o your right!

39
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:53,168
My command applies to the first
company only. Attention!

40
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:01,437
Attention! That means
you should get in line.

41
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,107
Do you see this line?

42
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,316
I don't.

43
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:15,223
You say you don't?
Don't you see how long it is?

44
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:19,627
Straight as an arrow!
Do you see it now?

45
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,661
-Well--
-Well, what?

46
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,697
Comrade....
Let's plant flowers.

47
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,101
Don't you see it?

48
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,868
What are you looking at?
Get lost.

49
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,034
-I see it.
-What did you say?

50
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,339
-I see it!
-Good.

51
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,711
Only our enemies can't see it.

52
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:42,447
Comrade Warden, we have
a new child. Lem Nikodinoski.

53
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,329
Yes, Comrade Warden.

54
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,045
Metodija.

55
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,780
Complete the admittance procedure
for the new one.

56
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,652
Come on, hurry up!

57
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:30,693
Some unknown genius
from the Iocal government

58
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,170
had the bright idea to turn
the abandoned factory

59
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,833
into an orphanage.

60
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:41,277
At that time there were orphanages
for the children of fallen veterans,

61
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,079
but our orphanage was an orphanage
for fallen enemies' children.

62
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:50,087
Children of the wealthy,
the traitors, the collaborators.

63
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,453
They had all sorts of names
for our dead parents.

64
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,321
Get undressed!

65
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,723
Damn me.

66
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,822
This... this was a dungeon.

67
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,594
A dungeon.

68
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,968
Pick them up.

69
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,429
That's my grandmother's cross.
God rest her soul.

70
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,195
The underpants too.

71
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,472
The underpants!

72
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,579
A BED FOR THE NEWLY ADMlTTED

73
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,624
Get up, come on!

74
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,563
Come on, make your bed!

75
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,866
Get up!

76
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,118
Get up!

77
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:43,090
What gave birth to you? Hurry up!
I'll teach you, swine!

78
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,630
Get up, get up!

79
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,429
Come on, what are you waiting for?

80
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,914
Clean them!

81
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:06,685
Running in place!

82
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,779
Running in place!

83
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,160
Salute the flag!

84
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,528
On the double.

85
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,535
Stop!

86
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:33,604
Side circles! Take the initial
position for the exercise!

87
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,476
And one, two...

88
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,485
For being late, 20 extra sit-ups!

89
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,460
I'm talking to you, boy!
Don't turn your head away!

90
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:55,863
For the lack of hygiene,
10 additional laps around the yard!

91
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,094
This is your place, monkey!

92
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,402
Stop!

93
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,605
Jumping and kneeling!

94
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,144
We were surrounded by wall
on all sides.

95
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,088
One thousand steps high,
two thousand steps wide.

96
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,749
A mountain of rock.

97
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,489
Damn me, Iife was so far away
from this place.

98
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,394
Do your exercise!

99
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,056
I was a scared Iittle mouse.

100
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,192
Don't laugh, big ears!

101
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,236
I was Ionely.

102
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:05,135
Klimovski! For disturbing
the harmony, three more laps.

103
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:17,711
Faster! Hurry up, you slime!
Hurry! Hurry up!

104
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,317
You'll sing, kitty.

105
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:24,115
Three! Klimovski, stop!
Run to the classroom!

106
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,690
The new kid, seven more laps.

107
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:33,026
Don't shorten the laps,
motherfucker! Circle wide!

108
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,241
Damn me.

109
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:23,839
Everyone in the orphanage knew
something was going to happen.

110
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,375
You had to check in at the gate.

111
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,977
I want to see the warden,
Comrade Ariton.

112
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,706
I'm Comrade Olivera Strezovska,
Deputy Warden.

113
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,551
Lenche, get back to your place!

114
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,952
Comrade Petkova, get back
to your place! Immediately!

115
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,888
Get back in line!

116
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,120
Comrade Warden, I have orders.

117
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,721
We caught the child with the monks.
The peasants reported him.

118
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,496
They say the child is a devil's seed.

119
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,133
Complete the admittance procedure
for the new one!

120
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:24,391
Isaac. His name was
Isaac Keyten.

121
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:40,901
Damn me.

122
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,414
I've asked myself
a thousand times

123
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,316
what was his power?
He had something in him.

124
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,120
How shall I put it? He radiated
with some strange light.

125
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,492
Lem Nikodinoski!

126
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:11,470
Listen carefully. We eliminated
these "plus" signs long ago.

127
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,274
Once and forever,
and until further notice!

128
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:22,411
Damn me, we have fought
a bloody fight against those lies.

129
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,489
I personally....

130
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,890
A bloody fight.

131
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:35,757
Is there anyone here
who believes in the Lord?

132
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,501
A great hero of the century.

133
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,778
Someone else?

134
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,488
I...

135
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,797
...believed.

136
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,857
Before.

137
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,705
All right, wise guys.

138
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:20,041
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
that the Lord exists.

139
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:26,178
Can He, after you kneel
and pray to Him at night,

140
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:31,517
complete your math homework
for you?

141
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,994
Can He?

142
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,332
Can He? Come on!
Believe in work, not prayer!

143
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,627
No.

144
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,569
Of course He can't.

145
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,401
Let's see what you know
about religion. Metodija.

146
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,877
-Religion is the masses' opium.
-Exactly. Sit down. Spasko.

147
00:21:56,114 --> 00:22:00,608
Priests are traitors who suck
the blood of the working class!

148
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,014
Klimovski!

149
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:06,614
Our village priest was
a womanizer and a thief.

150
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,116
Sit down.

151
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,064
We don't punish
because of religious feelings.

152
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:19,000
But our friends have done
wrong to the collective.

153
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:24,074
One night in the yard
without any sleep.

154
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,084
If I could only
hear his voice.

155
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,180
If he would just speak to me.
Look at me.

156
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,353
What surname is that, Keyten?

157
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,964
My Granny told me the T urkish
name for the devil was "sheytan."

158
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,638
Get up!

159
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,608
The punishment is over.

160
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,159
The Earth....

161
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,430
The Earth....

162
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,600
The Earth....

163
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,512
The Earth....

164
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,925
The sun....

165
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:34,635
The Earth-- No, the sun
revolves around the Earth.

166
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,298
I'm certain about it, yes.
That's right.

167
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,536
Good, I see that you've learned.
Keep on learning.

168
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,206
It's not correct!
The Earth moves around the sun!

169
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,079
You're lying!
You just want to spoil my grade!

170
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,983
Comrade Copernicus proved it
in the 16th century.

171
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:56,754
Who is that Comrade Copernicus?
Teacher said the sun revolves....

172
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,930
I dreamt of getting close to him.

173
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,395
But he didn't even notice me
for days.

174
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,882
T ake a break!

175
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,100
The youth, the pride
and the future of our people,

176
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:41,437
The youth, the pride
and the future of our people,

177
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:47,102
have all the conditions
for cultural and political learning.

178
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:52,444
-This is not edible.
-You won't eat it? Give it to me.

179
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:57,681
Our youngest, the pioneers,
enthusiastically manifest that.

180
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:04,990
They see the great love and care
of our Party and our government.

181
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,222
Cheese.

182
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:10,630
In clubs, through practical chores,
the pioneers easily cope

183
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:16,366
with school work and gain
greater skill and knowledge.

184
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,834
Tonight, I'll take you
to a secret place.

185
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:54,369
Finally, I asked him
if he wanted us to be friends.

186
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,432
There was no answer.

187
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,978
"It doesn't have to be now.
Later is okay too", I said.

188
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,240
Yet he kept silent.

189
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:03,731
My nightmare in those days
was called Lenche.

190
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,003
Lenche Petkova.

191
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,944
I kept sticking to them
Iike a Ieach.

192
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,107
I was as jealous
as a young bride.

193
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,048
"Why are you following me?"
he asked.

194
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,052
Are you angry at me?

195
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,146
Friendship is to be earned.

196
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,351
I didn't understand
what that meant then,

197
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,191
but I remembered those words
for the rest of my Iife.

198
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,937
Comrade Strezovska's shorts!

199
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,159
That day Comrade OIivera

200
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:37,132
was Ieft without the one thing
most holy to her in her Iife.

201
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:42,036
The red sport shorts she was awarded
for winning the cross-country race

202
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,701
on the birthday of comrade
Stalin Visarionovich.

203
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,614
It would have been better
if she Iost her soul.

204
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,228
You, primitive bitch.

205
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:11,368
Look at your comrade.
Shame on her.

206
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:15,364
A socialist youth member, acting
as if we were in the Dark Ages.

207
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,564
-Please, don't, Comrade Olivera.
-Shut up.

208
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,482
Marija, did you ask for an advocate?

209
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,122
Did Marija ask for an advocate?

210
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:26,675
You won't get out until you tell me
who committed this awful crime.

211
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,808
Listen carefully.

212
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:37,283
Those shorts are not underpants,
comrades.

213
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:44,919
They are not ordinary shorts.
They are holy. A sacrament.

214
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:49,796
Are you aware how important
those shorts are for our collective?

215
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,494
They are a gift
from the Gymnastics Committee--

216
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,198
Shut up, bastard!
I'm talking now!

217
00:32:56,874 --> 00:33:04,337
Those shorts acknowledge
a great respect for all of us.

218
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,645
We bear those shorts in our hearts.

219
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:13,189
They have social, political,
and moral meaning.

220
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:17,790
Those shorts filled me with pride.

221
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,260
I got goose bumps

222
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,663
when I saw Comrade Strezovska
in those shorts.

223
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,634
I have goose bumps now!

224
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,502
Fucking peasants,
the red shorts must be found!

225
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:35,078
Look under every tree!
Turn every stone! Is it clear?

226
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,375
They didn't find
the sacred shorts.

227
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:47,256
Our poor girls stayed for ages
in an icy cold room.

228
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,850
The coldest room in the orphanage
in the middle of winter.

229
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,589
Many got ill.

230
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,689
Some even started
coughing out blood.

231
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,998
While Lenche, our Lenche,
was taken to hospital.

232
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:07,048
"What is it with you?
Why are you following me?" he asked.

233
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,786
Maybe you're queer, kid?

234
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,197
What's a queer?

235
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:25,103
You're not a kid, but a devil!
You want to show off, don't you?

236
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,938
I'm going to report you
to Comrade Warden.

237
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:38,321
Comrade Olivera's shorts!
I found them!

238
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,318
Quite by accident

239
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,360
the red shorts' mystery
had been solved.

240
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:49,323
The kitchen Iadies used them
as washing rags.

241
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:46,522
That very next srping we heard
that Lenche Petkova, our Lenche,

242
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,489
died in hopital.

243
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:56,896
Damn me. We were already dead.
Just shadows.

244
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,437
It's a lie that she's dead.
I know who spreads such rumors.

245
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,562
That bastard.

246
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,934
-Queer.
-You want trouble, mouse?

247
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:05,701
Queer.

248
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,607
I'm going to stick your head
in the toilet! You won't know--

249
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,772
Exercise!

250
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,583
Not you! You are supposed
to control them!

251
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,122
Get in line, motherfucker.

252
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,040
Save soap.

253
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,670
You, swine, no bathing for you!

254
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:50,617
Lem, I told you the friendship
is to be earned.

255
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,120
If you want to be
my friend,

256
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,589
tomorrow you'II ask
about Lenche's death

257
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,751
at OIivera's class.

258
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,257
At Comrade Olivera's?

259
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,200
Finally I got the chance
to become his friend.

260
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,879
Damn me, I was scared.

261
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:41,737
" I'll stand like a border post,
defending--" Klimovski, be quiet.

262
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,875
Macedonian, T urk, Vlach
And Albanian

263
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:50,447
Brothers side by side
Started a new life

264
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:54,072
With Tito as the guide

265
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,553
Good. Sit down.

266
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:01,590
What's important in what we heard?
Klimovski?

267
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,421
-Brotherhood and unity!
-Good. Sit down.

268
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,588
And what else? Goce!

269
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:18,872
Sit down, Goce.
Sit down, you blockhead.

270
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,670
Lem Nikodinoski!

271
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,616
I wanted to ask....

272
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:41,962
I wanted to--
Comrade Tito--

273
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,796
He's important, isn't he?

274
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:52,068
We are here to formulate
thoughts and ideas.

275
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:55,474
Not to speak nonsense.

276
00:41:56,914 --> 00:42:01,351
Nikodinoski, aren't you listening
to me? Repeat what I said.

277
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:13,425
Do you know the word "moron,"
or is "idiot" more familiar to you?

278
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:21,164
Is it true that our comrade
Lenche Petkova has died?

279
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,640
Look, comrades.

280
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:34,451
Some people get sick.
Some stay healthy.

281
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:43,118
That's how nature works.
It's a dialectic.

282
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,457
How should I put it? It's all
connected to materialism!

283
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,395
And our comrade
Lem Nikodinoski is provoking us!

284
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:53,196
While our country is attacked
by monarchs and fascists,

285
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,329
our comrade Lem Nikodinoski
is provoking us!

286
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,737
He's a saboteur! Sit down!

287
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:08,008
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, one hour.

288
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:11,019
Isaac finally smiled at me.

289
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,418
There was a strange oath

290
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,185
written with small Ietters
in the message.

291
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:23,090
I swear before my brother
and before Lord our God

292
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,398
that I'II use all my strength
fighting for the truth.

293
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,866
I'II accept any punishment
if I'm not faithfull

294
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,841
to the following commandments;

295
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,213
Respect your own free will.

296
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,909
That's the most sacred thing
that you have.

297
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:47,285
Never Iie. The Iie is a weapon
of evil powers.

298
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,953
Do not run. Running away
is no solution.

299
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:59,161
Remember, all things in the world
are interconnected.

300
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,844
Now we' re brothers.

301
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,059
He gave me a present.

302
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:02,496
"With the box you see
the world's mirror image.

303
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,535
The future is the past. "
That's what he told me.

304
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:05,729
You know what repentance is,
don't you, son?

305
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,789
You know what repentance is,
don't you, son?

306
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,299
I haven't done anything wrong.

307
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,737
Listen carefully.

308
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:22,668
Provocation is a bad thing.
Sabotage, even worse.

309
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,848
You're a smart kid. A hero.

310
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:32,889
Comrade Warden,
I just asked if Lenche had died.

311
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:41,695
Listen. Your village has
given people heroes. Veterans.

312
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:49,904
What is self-criticism
for a big man like you?

313
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:54,271
-You'll learn this by heart.
-But, Father--

314
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:58,211
I don't understand.
How have I sinned?

315
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:02,182
I didn't love Lenche.
She was even--

316
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,577
Beast!

317
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:12,057
I think the biggest mistake
is our comrade Lem,

318
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,664
who doesn't want
to admit his mistakes.

319
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:19,462
With that, he is not only
a provocateur and saboteur,

320
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:24,472
but a collaborator of our enemies.
A traitor!

321
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,372
Very good.
What punishment do you suggest?

322
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:32,141
To throw him into the cellar and
give him just bread and water.

323
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:36,878
Sit down. Someone else? Nikolche.

324
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,548
We all accept self-criticism.
Who does he think he is?

325
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,593
It's not right.

326
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:47,219
What punishment do you suggest?

327
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:51,700
The bellman should beat him blue
until he confesses.

328
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,802
Metodija.

329
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:59,042
Our former comrade Lem has
become an anti-people's element.

330
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:03,476
We gave him a chance to repent,
to be self-critical, but he refuses.

331
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,980
The beast would've
understood by now!

332
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,949
I suggest we throw him
into the cellar for life!

333
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,919
To clean toilets,
to sleep alone in the cellar,

334
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,422
and to clean our boots
for five years.

335
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,926
-No, seven years!
-And to wash our socks!

336
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,621
-To serve us lunch!
-To be castrated!

337
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:24,892
-Death to fascism!
-Freedom for the people!

338
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,334
Have lsaac cast a spell on him
and turn him into a pig,

339
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,873
and then cut his throat,
so we can all have a feast.

340
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:37,914
Come on, comrades,
let's not go too far.

341
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,092
Get back!

342
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,159
Listen carefully.

343
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,499
For Keyten.

344
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:10,144
He's to be thrown down in the cellar
and be given only bread and water

345
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:16,480
until comrade Lem states
his comradely self-criticism.

346
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:52,786
Damn me, it seemed
whatever I'd do, I do wrong.

347
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,379
To safe Isaac,

348
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,949
it would have been simple
to read the self-criticism.

349
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,359
But that meant Iying in public.

350
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,900
And I swore before my brother
and before Lord our God

351
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,468
that I wouldn't Iie.

352
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:09,801
I would have swallowed not only
raw potatoes but Iive snakes

353
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:14,434
just to get sick and to be taken away
from this cursed orphanage.

354
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,273
Like our Lenche.

355
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,626
You ran away?

356
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,755
"Running away is no solution ",
said Isaac.

357
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,959
"I'II have to go back. "

358
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,676
"I'II smear your mouth.

359
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:25,077
Then you'II be able
to utter the self-criticism. "

360
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:29,081
This will draw your words
to wipe them out

361
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,017
as if you uttered nothing. "

362
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:35,080
The magnetic and strong force
of the collective

363
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,819
has got me back to my senses.

364
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:47,396
There's one force tough enough
to show me the right way.

365
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:54,568
Materialistic self-criticism.
That way, the victory will be ours.

366
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:59,374
-Death to fascism!
-Freedom for the people!

367
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,485
Three cheers for our comrade!

368
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,894
You'll be a Tito's pioneer
after all, won't you, son?

369
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:42,390
I'm not good at writing,
Comrade Strezovska.

370
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,754
Damn me.

371
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,489
Even when they proclaimed you
a model child,

372
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,792
they didn't Iet your sould rest.

373
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:55,395
I'm not the one to write reports.

374
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:58,201
Peer evaluations.

375
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:05,238
You know it's an honor and
a privilege. A sacred pioneer's duty.

376
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,780
Our little comrades
who've gone astray

377
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,853
must be returned to the right path.

378
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:16,992
Metodija Glishkovski. Nikolche.

379
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,894
Spasko!

380
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:29,201
I read my friends' names.
My God, how they Iied.

381
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,571
They've made things up,
told on others.

382
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:42,312
What about lsaac?
Isaac wouldn't write such a thing.

383
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,901
Was lsaac jailed here too?

384
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,627
Quick, the cart!

385
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:03,358
The peasant!
He should take him to the hospital!

386
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,468
Klimovski! Klimovski! Klimovski!

387
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:11,739
Little brother.
Get up, little brother.

388
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,203
Get away from him!

389
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,939
"See? Running away
is no solution", said isaac.

390
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,811
Maybe it was because
of poor KIimovski

391
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,942
that Isaac decided
to start a war.

392
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:26,045
Our world against theirs.

393
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:46,208
Little brother?

394
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,436
Kitty.

395
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:40,686
Sing, kitty, sing.

396
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:46,969
Y es, kitty, sing. Sing, kitty.

397
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,174
It died.

398
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:03,875
Get a grip.

399
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:18,688
I see dust! They're coming!

400
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,418
LONG LlVE THE SOVlET HERO

401
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:23,532
The kitty is alive!

402
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:28,863
Kitty!
The kitty came back to life!

403
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,186
Catch him!

404
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,852
Catch Comrade Bellman!

405
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,291
Don't look at me, you moron!
After him!

406
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:56,057
Come on! Hurry!

407
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,795
You must catch him
before they arrive!

408
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,075
Catch him! Hold him tight!

409
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:17,081
Carry him! Carry him away!
Come on! Come on!

410
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:26,023
May drought burn you.

411
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,003
Kitty.

412
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,733
Kitty.

413
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,213
Attention!

414
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:50,682
I greet the Yugoslav pioneers!

415
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,516
-Death to fascism!
-Freedom for the people!

416
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,024
Three cheers for a Soviet hero!

417
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:28,649
Respected comrade, people's hero,
knowing your heroic deeds

418
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:33,558
and achievements in the fight
against the fascist occupation--

419
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:36,596
Kitty!

420
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,224
Dear Yugoslav pioneers,

421
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:45,101
the eyes of your proud fathers and
mothers are filled with tears of joy.

422
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,436
They're orphans.

423
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:56,777
Who says you're orphans?

424
01:00:56,919 --> 01:01:02,152
All of you have a mother!
The Party!

425
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:05,886
And you have a father!
The great Stalin!

426
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:20,833
Iet's give a warm welcome
to your comrade Klimovski,

427
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:25,311
who looked the doctors straight
in the eyes and bravely said:

428
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:30,147
"Comrades,
I won't miss today's oath!"

429
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,360
Kitty! Father!

430
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:43,623
Today, when I become a pioneer,

431
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,067
I give a pioneer's word of honor

432
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,597
to diligently learn and work,

433
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:56,901
to respect my parents and adults.

434
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,945
Kitty!

435
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,514
Father!

436
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:08,184
May drought burn you.

437
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:10,952
This is for your own good.

438
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:28,675
For the fatherland with Tito,
forward!

439
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:41,421
For the fatherland with Tito.

440
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:23,354
-Someone should watch the bellman.
-lmmediately.

441
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:08,074
Comrade,
this is the first time for me.

442
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,645
Nothing. Nothing.

443
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:16,209
In front of the enemy!

444
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:21,685
Charge!

445
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:25,292
I give a pioneer's word of honor

446
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,028
to diligently learn and work,

447
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:35,535
to respect my parents and adults.

448
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:38,801
AII things in the world
are interconnected.

449
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:42,105
The case with our bellman
showed me too soon

450
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,237
how true that gibberish
of ours was.

451
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:10,337
The drought seemed to Iast
a thousand centuries.

452
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:13,272
The curse of the crazy Bellman
got us.

453
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,475
Deadly white heat
reigned everywhere.

454
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,144
In the Earth, in the stones,
in the air,

455
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:27,586
in our hands, Iips,
in our breath.

456
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:31,456
Damn me, even in our young souls.

457
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:46,903
Isaac, chase it away, old man.

458
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:52,504
He is a bad person.
Isaac, please, chase it away.

459
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:32,768
Damn me.

460
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,070
That night everyone
in the orphanage

461
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,941
knew that something
was going to happen.

462
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:34,353
He told me, "Run, Lem,
go away. "

463
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:42,932
Get back! Don't run, motherfucker!
Get back!

464
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,939
He stayed.
God knows why.

465
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,206
Come on, tell us where you were.

466
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:57,615
We caught him in front of
your window, Comrade Warden.

467
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:04,152
Let him go. He has done nothing.

468
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,170
Will you tell me what you saw?

469
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:18,469
Will you tell me what you saw?

470
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:25,846
Don't fret. I won't tell anyone.
Party member's honor.

471
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:32,382
From the Warden they took him
to comrade OIivera.

472
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,855
We all knew
she was the master punisher.

473
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:44,195
My beautiful one. A man. A big man.

474
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:14,526
Damn me.

475
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:18,191
I started hating everything.
I was jelous.

476
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,599
Comrade OIivera
became my greatest enemy.

477
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:28,372
The culture is a front for sacrifices.

478
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:33,377
That is why today,
on this great holiday,

479
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:39,044
we uncover the bust of
our comrade Stalin, with pride,

480
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:43,181
a work made with our hands.

481
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:02,367
Hey, Olivera has fallen!

482
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,872
Speak up! Speak up!

483
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:15,050
Speak up! Who's done it?
Who's done it?

484
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:20,419
Take him away.
Get him out of my sight.

485
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,287
The interrogation Iasted
a day and night.

486
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:28,488
Come on. Slowly.

487
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:36,704
Cveta Eftimoska.

488
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:42,539
You want to buy my dead body?
My remains? My corpse?

489
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,002
Everyone was feverish.

490
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:49,174
Every single soul in the orphanage
was sick with fear.

491
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,146
If I knew
it would come to this...

492
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:59,617
It was engraved in his heart
from the earliest age.

493
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:05,063
Often, while playing with friends,
in the height of the game,

494
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,260
Joseph Stalin was known
to suddenly stand still

495
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:14,273
and stare at the setting sun.

496
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:20,939
He especially liked the heavy
red clouds in the evening sky.

497
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:26,020
He is a symbol of the fight against
the exploitation of the proletariat,

498
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:32,218
Ieader of all the diligent
and honest people in the world.

499
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:36,763
Let's see what you know about this.

500
01:15:56,618 --> 01:16:00,213
Kid. Come over here.

501
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:42,358
May you be a great man.

502
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:55,302
-Long live generalissimos Stalin!
-Come on, you're free.

503
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,105
Who's next?

504
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:01,144
Dervutovski Blagojche.

505
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,714
Blagoja Dervutovski!

506
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:11,851
Keyten! You've crossed the line.
You go first!

507
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,889
Isaac Keyten, shut your mouth.

508
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:38,009
Leave him! Get away from him!

509
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:42,947
It was him! I knew it!
It was all his fault!

510
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,846
Come on. Come on, hush.

511
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:21,087
Isaac.

512
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:44,268
They accused him
of the most terrible crimes

513
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:46,939
and Iocked him
in the cellar.

514
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:49,676
The transport was expected.

515
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,117
What future could he have now?

516
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,353
What future could I have?

517
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,392
CON FESSl ON
l, Lem N ikodinoski....

518
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:12,062
Father's looking for you. Hurry up.

519
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:20,172
I was the only one
who could save Isaac.

520
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:23,748
What's that in your hand?

521
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:29,185
Comrade Warden, I want to--
I have to tell you that--

522
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:30,985
Listen carefully.

523
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:34,424
You'll go to an all-federal
competition in Belgrade.

524
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:39,023
I have signed you in.
They'll let you go.

525
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:48,104
Read all the books you can find.
The life and work of Joseph Stalin.

526
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:53,006
This is your chance of a lifetime.
Don't miss it.

527
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:04,617
I don't have time.
They're waiting for me.

528
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:08,456
Come, now. Promise me
you'll be fit as a fiddle.

529
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:17,730
Comrade Warden,
I wanted to tell you that....

530
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:23,638
I wanted to say,
"Isaac is not to blame.

531
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:26,373
I should be Iying in prison
insted of him. "

532
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,412
Promise me.

533
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:46,128
I wanted to... but I didn't.

534
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:49,795
I just stood there with the wrinkled
confession in my hand.

535
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,668
I promise.

536
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:53,940
Damn me.

537
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:28,442
Beat the hell out
of those regular pupils.

538
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:27,799
AII the things in the world
are interconnected.

539
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:31,565
I'm not making an excuse
for myself. I'm guilty.

540
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:36,007
Attention, attention!

541
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:39,978
This is the new Deputy Warden
speaking, Metodija Grishkovski.

542
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:44,711
Comrades, the crime committed
by the orphanage resident lsaac,

543
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:49,813
is proof that Warden Ariton
didn't perform his duties

544
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:53,485
and proved himself
unworthy of our Party's trust.

545
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:59,157
The authorities have decided to
appoint a new orphanage warden:

546
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,461
Comrade Olivera Strezovska.

547
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:03,935
An order from the new warden:

548
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:08,839
Every morning, the siren
will wake us up an hour earlier

549
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:12,606
to extend the time
for morning gymnastics.

550
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:15,079
Death to fascism!
Freedom for the people!

551
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:16,911
Fucking life!

552
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:09,937
Damn me.
Someone had to suffer.

553
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:22,200
Ariton, the Lord doesn't forgive that.

554
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:32,078
For my sake.

555
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:04,411
It's more vital that you forgive me.

556
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,838
Lord, forgive me.

557
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:37,811
What was that?

558
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,630
She made the gratest
sacrifice of all

559
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:04,678
to save his soul from a sin
that's unforgivable.

560
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:11,210
And I, damn me,
what did I do?

561
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:07,534
That Sunday they sent me off
to Belgrade

562
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:10,133
to the all-federal competition.

563
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:13,270
Isaac would be transported
the same day.

564
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:16,716
But they found the cellar empty.

565
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:23,652
They proclaimed him dead.

566
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:49,075
Lem, the die is cast.

567
01:29:56,624 --> 01:29:59,024
I never returned
to the orphanage.

568
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,357
Why did I tell this story?

569
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:12,336
Maybe because I have never again
been so close to the Iight.

570
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:17,809
Isaac, I hope
you will never forgive me.

571
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:20,974
Damn me.

572
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:38,688
Hand over that gas can!
The cameraman wants to shoot!

573
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:10,721
