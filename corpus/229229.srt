1
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,675
I LOVE YOU

2
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,638
4th OF JULY CROAKER FESTIVAL

3
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,352
Let's welcome back
our six finalists to the stage.

4
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,395
They're pretty as can be,
aren't they?

5
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,350
You worked hard. Your parents
worked hard. We're proud of you.

6
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,033
She was born for this.

7
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,514
- Her breasts are so... ample.
- She does exercises to pump 'em up.

8
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,357
Guys, I'm on sexist overload
as it is. Kill the commentary.

9
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,752
"In the spirit of Mother Teresa,
what will be your contribution -

10
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,198
- to your community
and the world at large?"

11
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,357
At summer's end, I plan to become
a serious actress in New York City.

12
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,358
By entertaining the world through
art, I shall serve my country.

13
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,276
Did you feed her this shit?

14
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,560
Work it. Babe!
They're eating it up.

15
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,391
And this year's Croaker Queen is:
Miss Helen Shivers.

16
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,672
That's my girl!

17
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,514
That's my girlfriend!

18
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,396
- How's my hair?
- Hurricane-proof.

19
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,917
It's all about hair. Don't forget it
when you become a big lawyer.

20
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,835
Professional women think it's all
about brains, and ignore the "do".

21
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,276
The "do" is vital. Got it.

22
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,993
- Are you riding with me?
- No. Tell Mom I'll be home late.

23
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,508
- Is Miss Croaker gonna get sautéed?
- A twit with a wit.

24
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:16,115
- Julie. A shooter on the house.
- I can't get past the slime.

25
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,512
How about I take you out
before you leave town?

26
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,876
I don't think so. Max.

27
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,272
We've been friends since forever.
You can't leave without a farewell.

28
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,070
A toast... to us.

29
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,039
To our last summer of immature.
Adolescent decadence.

30
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,518
- Somebody's buzzed.
- Chum bait. Take a hike.

31
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,590
- Easy, easy!
- Barry, they're just friends.

32
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,958
Come on. This is tired.

33
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,872
- I'm just taking care of your girl.
- Thanks, buddy. Let's blow.

34
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,998
Let's beam down to Dawson's Beach.
A little joyride.

35
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,832
Bye.

36
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,354
They're making out
when they hear over the radio -

37
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,311
- that a killer with a hook for a
hand escaped from the insane asylum.

38
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:48,033
- You're telling it wrong.
- Shut up. The girl gets all scared.

39
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,751
She wants to go home.
The boy gets pissed and peels out.

40
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,436
No, the boy goes for help
and the girl stays in the car.

41
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,153
- She hears a scratching sound...
- It's not a scratch, it's a drip.

42
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,440
No, the guy's been hung from a tree.
His feet are scratching the roof.

43
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,516
No, he's been decapitated,
and the blood's dripping on the car.

44
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,151
No, he wasn't decapitated,
he was gutted with a hook.

45
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,032
- That's the way I heard it.
- You're all wrong.

46
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,230
They get to the girl's house and
find a bloody hook in the car door.

47
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,791
That's the original story.
That's the way it really happened.

48
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,635
None of it really happened.
It's a bullshit story.

49
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,830
- No. It's not. It's true.
- I don't think so, Ray.

50
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,278
It's a fictional story to warn girls
of the dangers of premarital sex.

51
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:00,438
You know how terrified I am of
your I.Q., but it's an urban legend.

52
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,197
And they all originate from
some sort of real-life incident.

53
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,553
By that time I'll be finishing my
two-year deal on "Guiding Light", -

54
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,955
- coinciding with your first year
as quarterback for the Steelers.

55
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,797
Then we can elope to Europe
or the Caymans, -

56
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,192
- where I'll let you impregnate me
with the first of three children. -

57
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,353
- before you head off to rehab.

58
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,116
Then we can live happily...
blah. Blah. Blah.

59
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,079
Ray? Where did you go?

60
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,315
I'm gonna hook you!

61
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,153
- Do you really believe that crap?
- It's true.

62
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,075
The hook is really a phallic symbol.
Ultimately castrated.

63
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,232
I'm gonna miss you.

64
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,837
You can always ditch Boston
and come to New York with me.

65
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,994
We can't all sit in coffee-houses
and ramble on our laptops.

66
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,598
- Nobody gets me the way you do.
- I understand your pain.

67
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,593
I hate this.

68
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,551
You're gonna fall for a head-shaven,
body-piercing philosophy student.

69
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,636
- That sounds attractive.
- I'll never see you again.

70
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:52,194
High-school relationships are more
successful than any other kind.

71
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,592
Cite your source.

72
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,990
Are you sure?

73
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,558
- Give me the keys.
- Nobody drives my car but me.

74
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,350
I know, baby, but the Croaker Queen
has to get home now.

75
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,638
- Hey, you two.
- Give me my fucking keys.

76
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,430
Come ride in the back with me.
I'll let you do things to me.

77
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,116
- Nobody drives my car but me.
- Get in the car.

78
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,868
You can't drive for shit.

79
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,388
Can you say "alcoholic"?

80
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,119
What the hell is this crap?

81
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,550
What's wrong with you?

82
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,109
Watch out!

83
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,637
- What was that?
- Is everybody okay?

84
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,430
- I think it was an animal.
- You're bleeding.

85
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,713
- It's not mine.
- It must have been a dog.

86
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,475
Jesus Christ, my fucking car!

87
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,197
- Can't you see where you're going?
- It came out of nowhere.

88
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,353
- A dog couldn't have done that.
- A deer could.

89
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,911
- My dad's gonna freak on my ass.
- It was an accident.

90
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,835
- If it was a deer. Where is it?
- Maybe it ran off.

91
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,516
- I hope we didn't kill it.
- Oh, my God...

92
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,077
- No way.
- I thought...

93
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,313
- I didn't see it.
- There's no way.

94
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,358
This isn't happening.

95
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,070
Check that side.

96
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,711
I couldn't see it.
I swear!

97
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,591
- Is he dead?
- Check his pulse. <i>You</i> rammed him!

98
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,869
I think he's dead.

99
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,436
- Who is he?
- His face is all messed up.

100
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,720
- What was he doing out here?
- We've got to get an ambulance.

101
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,678
What's your hurry?

102
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,038
- The guy's dead.
- You're not a doctor.

103
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,193
Use your brain, Julie.
If we call the police, we're fucked.

104
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,909
- It was an accident.
- Let's think about this.

105
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,632
Think about what? He crossed
the road in the middle of the night.

106
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,113
- You weren't drinking or speeding.
- They won't believe I was driving.

107
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,479
- It's my car. They'll nail my ass.
- That's not true.

108
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,110
I'm drunk as shit. I'm fucked!

109
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,477
We'll call the police
and tell the truth.

110
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,633
It's manslaughter.

111
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,797
- We're gonna fry no matter what.
- Then we leave now.

112
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,520
Are you crazy?

113
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,832
- The grille's busted and bloody.
- We can clean it up.

114
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,314
- We're going to the police!
- We don't have time for your shit!

115
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,190
Let's try to stay calm.

116
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,754
If there's some of the car on <i>him</i>.
You're looking at a hit-and-run!

117
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,639
- Then we dump the body.
- You've lost it.

118
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,032
- Let's pretend we were never here.
- We'll dump him in the water.

119
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,236
When they find him,
the evidence will be washed away.

120
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,029
If they found him at all.

121
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,436
Maybe the undertow could carry him
out to sea.

122
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,717
I won't be any part of it.

123
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,031
I'm scared. Julie.
I'm not like the rest of you.

124
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,275
I don't have the family or money
to get me out of this. Please.

125
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:01,120
This is your future, Julie. Think
about college. Your scholarship.

126
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,150
The guy's already dead. If we go
to the police, we're dead too.

127
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,795
- What do we do?
- Help me.

128
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,438
They're slowing down.

129
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,395
- Who is it?
- It's Max.

130
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,348
Get rid of him.

131
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,673
- Have you got car trouble?
- Actually...

132
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,270
Barry had too much to drink. We
don't want upchuck in the new car.

133
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,797
- It doesn't look so new anymore.
- Yeah. Don't drink and drive.

134
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,520
Daddy's gonna be mad.

135
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,591
- What can I do for you, Max?
- Wipe that grin off your face.

136
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,350
Okay, Max, will do.
Have a good night.

137
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,594
- You got that rich boy act down.
- We'll be seeing you.

138
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,236
Take care. Julie.

139
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,475
Even if his body washes ashore, -

140
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,872
- he'll be eaten by crabs
and small fish.

141
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,589
Maybe we'll get lucky with a shark.

142
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,996
Take him to the side.

143
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,316
Put him down.

144
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,634
- Let's do it.
- Wait.

145
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,237
- Should we find out who he is?
- Why?

146
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,518
- Just to know.
- I don't want to know.

147
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,356
Let's just pretend he's an escaped
lunatic with a hook. Ray, help me.

148
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,035
- I don't think I can.
- Barry, it's not too late.

149
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,797
- You, just shut up!
- Christ. I'll do it.

150
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,828
Get him off me!

151
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,953
My crown!
He's got my crown!

152
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,391
Over here!

153
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,190
- Let's get out of here.
- We're going home now.

154
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:20,153
Never, under any circumstances,
speak about this again.

155
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,599
It's now merely
a future therapy bill. Agreed?

156
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,120
- I'll never mention it again.
- We'll make a pact.

157
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,068
We take this to our grave.

158
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,553
Julie?

159
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,471
- Don't nod! You fucking say it!
- Yeah, okay.

160
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,154
- "We take this to our grave. "
- Let her go.

161
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,236
- You fucking say it.
- We take this to the grave.

162
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,795
It'll be okay.

163
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,317
ONE YEAR LATER

164
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,308
It's time to go.

165
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,791
Move your tired, ugly ass.
We're late.

166
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,758
I changed my mind.

167
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,755
Get your white-as-death corpse
in the car.

168
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,391
Come on!

169
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,270
You're going home for the summer
to get a tan on your pale tail.

170
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,476
Let's go.

171
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,476
Remember. Sun and fun.

172
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,755
Julie? Welcome home. Dear.

173
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,190
I missed you.

174
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,952
How's the snapper?

175
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,918
I really wanted monkfish,
but it's been a bad season.

176
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,836
- Are you on drugs?
- What?

177
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,117
I just wanted an honest reaction.

178
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,995
No, Mom. No drugs.

179
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,716
Then what is wrong?
You look like death.

180
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,398
I've had a rough year.

181
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,431
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT

182
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:15,796
You got some mail.
Your report card came last week.

183
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,794
I know it looks bad.
But the summer session went well.

184
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,717
- It's also your last chance.
- It's not that serious.

185
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,713
What happened to my daughter?

186
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,954
You went away,
and you don't call or visit.

187
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,033
Your father must be turning over
in his grave.

188
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,118
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
LAST SUMMER!

189
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,390
Who sent this? There's
no postmark or return address.

190
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,872
- Why? What does it say?
- Nothing.

191
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,437
Guys, easy...
It's called glass. It breaks.

192
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,079
Good morning.

193
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,953
Well, look what the cat drug in.

194
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,797
Elsa. Hi. I need to talk to Helen.
Can you give me her New York number?

195
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,078
- Her New York number?
- Yeah. I need to talk to her.

196
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,679
Helen doesn't have a New York
number. Try Women's Fragrances.

197
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,630
Frightening, isn't it?

198
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,236
Julie.

199
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,273
- When did you get home?
- Yesterday.

200
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,594
- It's good to see you.
- What happened to New York?

201
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,992
I went for a while.
It didn't really work out.

202
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,553
Somebody sent this to me.

203
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,793
- Somebody knows.
- How?

204
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,715
- I don't know.
- We were so careful.

205
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,476
What if somebody else
was there that night?

206
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,553
- Who? It's been a year.
- I don't know.

207
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,394
Has Barry seen this?

208
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,478
- Do you ever see Barry at school?
- It's a big campus. He <i>is</i> back?

209
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,520
- I saw his car at the gym.
- Did you guys break up?

210
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,830
What are you two doing here?

211
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,392
Hi, Barry.

212
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,637
"I know what you did last summer. "
What a crock of shit.

213
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:58,194
- We need help.
- I'll say, you two look like shit.

214
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,669
You're a prick.

215
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,472
- We can't just ignore it.
- How do you know it's related?

216
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,349
- You did a lot last summer.
- Only one murder comes to mind.

217
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,273
You shut the hell up!

218
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,351
- We didn't murder anyone.
- He was still alive.

219
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,717
He was in the middle of the road.

220
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,509
- His name was David Egan.
- Who?

221
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:34,835
David Egan. He was found
three weeks after we...

222
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,553
His body was caught in a shrimp net.
It was in the paper.

223
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,111
I think the police called it
an accidental drowning.

224
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,432
But he died because of us.
That's certain.

225
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,470
What about Ray? Have you shown
the letter to him? What does he say?

226
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,475
We broke up last summer. Last
I heard, he was working up north.

227
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:13,995
Let's suppose someone was there.
Why send a letter one year later?

228
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,073
It's probably some crack
fucking around.

229
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,035
Max.

230
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,954
- Max, you think?
- Who else? He was there.

231
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,756
You two wait here.
I know what I'm doing.

232
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,240
Go figure. I was just wondering
what happened to that Barry Cox.

233
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:56,238
Hey, Max. Can we talk a second,
in private?

234
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,279
This isn't private enough for you?

235
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,871
What?

236
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,949
We got your letter.

237
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,954
- Don't fuck with me. You saw us.
- What the fuck are you on?

238
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,916
I'll say this once. I'll kill you.
I have no problem with that.

239
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,197
- Get off of me!
- Understand?

240
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,351
Motherfucker.
Don't you test me.

241
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,478
I'll call the cops on your ass.

242
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,749
- Did he admit to the letter?
- He won't bother you anymore.

243
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,993
I scared the shit out of him.

244
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,158
Well. I'll be damned.

245
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,074
So Ray's a fisherman.

246
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,360
Yeah, almost a year now.
I work on that one over there.

247
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,636
That's nice.

248
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,396
Have a nice life, guys.
I'm out of here.

249
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,833
Have you got a minute?

250
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,712
I've got to get back to work.
Call me, we can get together.

251
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,310
We need to talk.

252
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,309
- And you think Max sent it?
- Barry does.

253
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,511
He's probably just screwing around.
He doesn't have much else to do.

254
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:04,317
- So... how's school?
- So, you're a fisherman.

255
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,598
Prophecy fulfilled.
I've become my father.

256
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,993
- I didn't think you knew your dad.
- All I know is he worked the boats.

257
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,794
I know you hold me responsible
for what happened last summer.

258
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,036
No, I'm responsible for
my own actions. I don't blame you.

259
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,514
But I don't want to know you either.

260
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,712
Hello?

261
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,551
Hello?

262
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,120
I KNOW

263
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,278
My fucking jacket!

264
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,190
Hank, is anybody else here?

265
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,636
Just you and me.

266
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,879
You fucker!

267
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,297
Max, you're fucking dead.

268
00:39:23,332 --> 00:39:24,754
Max, you're fucking dead.

269
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,070
Help me!

270
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,030
Help me! Somebody!

271
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,475
What do you want?

272
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,911
I'm sorry.
I swear. We didn't mean it.

273
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,476
One moment please, Officer.

274
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,915
- Julie...
- What happened?

275
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,791
No. For the fortieth time.
I couldn't see his face.

276
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,794
Somebody tried to kill you.
We have to go to the police.

277
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,034
If he wanted me dead. He could
have done it. He's fucking with us.

278
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,237
- Who is?
- Some guy in a slicker.

279
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,710
That narrows it down.
This being a fishing village.

280
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,159
Since you bring it up...
You have a slicker.

281
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,876
- You're not gonna throw this on me.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.

282
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,991
Maybe we should come clean.

283
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,438
No. We made a pact,
and we're gonna keep it.

284
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,832
That's insane. Look at us.
The secret's killing us.

285
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,639
We're not going to the police.

286
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,430
We can put an end to it, and
salvage a small fraction of a life.

287
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:09,870
It was murder. Julie.
Your words. Remember? Murder.

288
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,469
- We find this guy and fix him up.
- Like last night?

289
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,998
He's right. This guy won't go to the
police. We'll find him, talk to him.

290
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,799
How do we find him?

291
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,875
It has to be a friend or family
member of... What was his name?

292
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,838
- David Egan.
- Right. David Egan.

293
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,997
It could still be Max.

294
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,075
- Then find him. Prove Barry wrong.
- I just want for you and me...

295
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,109
Listen to me. Get something.
There is no "you and me".

296
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,588
I can access the local library
and pull up all we need to know.

297
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,274
Egan... David.

298
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,750
- All these articles are about him?
- Yeah. Or at least mention him.

299
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,956
Wait. July 5th, two years ago.
What's this?

300
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,232
"Susie Willis drowned, trapped in
a car near Dawson's Beach. "

301
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,473
- "The driver, Egan, was unharmed. "
- I remember that wreck.

302
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,031
Susie was engaged to David.

303
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,159
Her name was tattooed on his arm.
I saw it.

304
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,230
"Survived by his mother, Claire, and
sister, Melissa, of Maribel County. "

305
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,313
They live in the sticks.
What do you think?

306
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,994
What have we got to lose?

307
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,231
Turn right...
Back there.

308
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,558
Do we just say, "We killed your son
and we were nearby, so... "

309
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,756
We play it by ear.

310
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,436
Angela Lansbury always had a plan.

311
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,389
What if they recognize us?
They could shoot us.

312
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,916
They could've done that already.

313
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,390
Jodie Foster tried this.
A serial killer opened the door.

314
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,391
Well, it was a good try.

315
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,430
Adding "breaking and entering"
to our crimes?

316
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,354
Can I help you?

317
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,713
Hi. Our car stalled down the road.
Can we use your phone?

318
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,238
- The phone's over there.
- Thanks.

319
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,155
Jodie.
Will you call Triple-A?

320
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,119
You got it... Angela.

321
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,918
My name is Missy Egan.
Are you girls from Maribel?

322
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,516
- No, Southport.
- I went to Southport High.

323
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,629
- You looked familiar. What year?
- Class of '88.

324
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:32,035
Your name, "Egan", sounds familiar.
Did you have a brother?

325
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,431
I did, but he was younger than me.
David.

326
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,513
- What class was he?
- '92. But he died last July.

327
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,071
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

328
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,552
Do you live alone?

329
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,119
Yeah. I do.

330
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,229
My daddy died a long time ago
and my mother's in a home.

331
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,518
She didn't take too well
to what happened to David.

332
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,037
Things haven't been the same
since he died.

333
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,638
They're on their way.

334
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,078
I could make you guys a cup of tea
while you're waiting.

335
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,119
- Thanks.
- That's nice of you.

336
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:40,558
I think I remember David.
He had a friend. What was his name?

337
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,952
Didn't he hang out with this guy...?
What was his name?

338
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,796
I didn't know too many
of David's friends.

339
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,152
There was one guy...

340
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:03,034
He stopped by not too long after
David's death, to pay his respects.

341
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,797
He was a really nice guy.
He was cute and smart and...

342
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,557
We were sweet on each other for
a minute or so. But it didn't work.

343
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,475
He never said it. But I think
it hurt him to be around me.

344
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,351
- Where is this old friend now?
- Oh. I don't know.

345
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,751
- Do you remember his name?
- Billy.

346
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,993
- Did he have a last name?
- Blue. Billy Blue.

347
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:42,189
- We should wait back at the car.
- Don't be ridiculous. Stay.

348
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,831
- I don't want to miss Triple-A.
- We appreciate the phone.

349
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,073
Any time. I don't get
too many knocks on my door nowadays.

350
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,597
- Are you okay?
- I wigged out. I'm sorry.

351
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,194
Being in his house
and seeing his sister...

352
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:08,597
- God, do you see what we've done?
- It was an accident.

353
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,833
We killed a man. Then ruined
the lives of everyone he knew.

354
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,154
We're not that powerful.
You're giving us too much credit.

355
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,753
- You forgot your cigarettes.
- Thank you.

356
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,673
- I see you got the car started.
- Yeah, it started right up.

357
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,276
Funny how that happens.

358
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,952
- So what now?
- Now we try and find Billy Blue.

359
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,589
Maybe he wanted to die.

360
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,275
- What?
- David Egan.

361
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,070
His girlfriend died on the same
road, July 4th, one year earlier.

362
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,109
Maybe he was sitting in the road,
waiting for us to hit him.

363
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,592
Yeah, if that will help you
sleep at night.

364
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,595
What happened between us?
We used to be best friends.

365
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,633
We used to be a lot of things.

366
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,632
I miss you.

367
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,075
Hey, Dad.

368
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,237
Is the washed-up has-been
having a moment?

369
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,554
What do you want?

370
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,872
We're doing inventory tomorrow.
I need you there by 10.

371
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,068
I can't. I'm in the parade tomorrow.

372
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,917
Dad put me in charge of the store,
and I want you there by 10.

373
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,312
The outgoing queen
has to ride in the parade.

374
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,029
It's tradition.
There's nothing I can do about it.

375
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:12,110
You and your hair...
It's so pathetic.

376
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,479
- You can leave now.
- So very pathetic.

377
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,916
SOON

378
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:49,035
What?
Oh, my God...

379
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,474
Max...

380
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:29,475
- Are you sure he was dead?
- I saw him... with these crabs.

381
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,679
You do it.

382
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,633
He was there. And he was
wearing your jacket, Barry.

383
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:55,113
- Did the crabs carry him away?
- I believe you, Julie.

384
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,239
- He took the body.
- Why would he do that?

385
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:05,032
Why did he try to run you over,
and make coleslaw on Helen's head?

386
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,830
- Let's go back to the house.
- Where's your jacket, Barry?

387
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,872
Don't you see? He's got us.
We can't go to the police now.

388
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,875
He's watching us and waiting.
What are you waiting for?

389
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,558
What are you waiting for?

390
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,271
What are you doing here?

391
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,796
- I've been looking for you guys.
- You're gonna die.

392
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,635
- Stop it.
- I didn't do anything.

393
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,554
- You're fucking lying!
- Leave him alone. Get a grip.

394
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:51,477
- Wake up, Julie. He's behind this.
- He's after me. Too.

395
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,312
I got a letter.

396
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,837
A letter? I got run over,
Helen gets her hair chopped off, -

397
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,632
- Julie gets a body in a trunk, and
you get a letter. That's balanced.

398
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,635
- You killed Max and took my jacket.
- Max is dead?

399
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:18,035
You always wanted to be our friend,
but were too jealous to handle it.

400
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,237
Fuck you.

401
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,712
We have to stick together.
Help each other.

402
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,392
So if it's not fisherboy here,
who is it?

403
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:41,839
- We think his name is Billy Blue.
- How do you know that?

404
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,152
- David had a friend by that name.
- He's probably a school friend.

405
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,279
According to his sister,
that would make him class of '92.

406
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,638
Elsa was class of '92. Maybe
there's something in her yearbook.

407
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,916
It's hard to believe that's the guy.

408
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,640
His face isn't splattered
on the road.

409
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:10,317
- Maybe Blue's not his real name.
- He could have lied to Missy.

410
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,359
- If we bring the book to Missy...
- She could point him out.

411
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,035
I'm not going anywhere.

412
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,750
High school mugshots...

413
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,396
- I'll go. You've got that parade.
- Forget it.

414
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,109
- You have to, in case he shows up.
- I don't want him to!

415
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,239
This could be our chance.
We could catch him.

416
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,996
I'll go to Missy's. Barry, you go
with Helen. If he shows up...

417
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,549
I'll pound his ass.

418
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,349
- You sound like vigilantes.
- It's July 4th, Ray.

419
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,196
Whatever he has planned is gonna
happen today, unless we stop him.

420
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:59,196
Don't you see? It's that moment
where we have to make a decision.

421
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:05,273
- Let's make the right one.
- I'll do what's smart, not right.

422
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,910
Then let's go.
Leave town. Disappear.

423
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,550
I <i>have</i> disappeared.
Now I want my life back.

424
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,992
We have to face this.
What's it gonna be, Ray?

425
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,159
Barry.

426
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,270
Over there!

427
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,275
Where the hell is he?

428
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,151
Missy?

429
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,713
Please.
Missy...

430
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:39,432
Do you remember me
from the other day? The car trouble?

431
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,636
What are you doing here?

432
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:23,109
Please. We need to talk.

433
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,319
I need to find
your brother's friend. Billy Blue.

434
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,395
- Can you look through the yearbook?
- What's this all about?

435
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:38,556
It has to do with your brother
and last July 4th.

436
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:44,113
- What about it?
- What happened wasn't an accident.

437
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,239
- I know.
- You know what?

438
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,119
He killed himself.

439
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,838
He went up there to die
where Susie died.

440
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,278
The whole town blamed him
for her death.

441
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,833
- So he blamed himself.
- How do you know it was suicide?

442
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,468
He left a note.

443
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:16,556
I hid it from the insurance company.
They don't pay if it's suicide.

444
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:25,238
That don't much matter anymore,
because the money's been spent.

445
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,436
I WILL NEVER FORGET
LAST SUMMER

446
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:33,198
This isn't a suicide note.
It's a death threat.

447
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,471
- What are you talking about?
- Your brother didn't kill himself.

448
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,316
I saw him. I was there. And
whoever sent this was there too.

449
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,678
- Where did you see him?
- We hit him. It was an accident.

450
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,638
- My brother drowned.
- "Susie" was tattooed on his arm.

451
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,191
He doesn't have a tattoo.
You didn't see anything. Get out!

452
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,595
Get out of my house.

453
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,349
Oh, my God...

454
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,108
It wasn't your brother.

455
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:44,350
- I'll be up in the balcony.
- He had a big, huge hook.

456
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:51,718
Everything's going to be all right.
I won't let anything happen to you.

457
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,550
Nicely done, ladies.

458
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:01,236
Now, let's meet last year's winner:
Miss Helen Shivers.

459
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:21,719
As we continue our pageant,
we move into the talent competition.

460
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,432
Oh. Jesus.

461
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,791
Barry!

462
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,758
Somebody help him!

463
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,800
Excuse me.

464
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,636
- What's the problem?
- He's gonna kill him!

465
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,236
- Up in the balcony.
- Everybody stay calm.

466
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,710
Get off of me!

467
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,352
Stay behind me.

468
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,230
Nobody's up here. This is not
my idea of a funny joke.

469
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,951
The fisherman was here.
He killed Barry.

470
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:21,830
There's nobody up here.
Let's go back downstairs.

471
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,399
Watch your step.

472
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:34,350
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, false alarm. </i>
<i>We'll resume in a few minutes. </i>

473
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:44,234
I'm gonna take you home.
Your parents are worried about you.

474
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,949
You have to believe me.

475
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,150
Let me take you home.

476
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:00,830
Excuse me.
We'll be needing this.

477
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,954
Come on.

478
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:14,477
So then he killed him
with a fish-hook.

479
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,349
Did he use the same hook
to cut your hair off?

480
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:22,991
No. He used a scissors. Asshole.

481
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,709
I know I sound delusional.
But it's true.

482
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:33,069
I heard the version with a mental
patient with a hook for a hand.

483
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:42,868
We'll have to take the alley.

484
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:58,112
Look.
You little shit-stick reject...

485
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:02,478
There's been a murder. And
you'll fry in hell if you ignore it.

486
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:07,430
I'll contact Barry's parents,
and we'll put out a search for him.

487
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:12,116
He was probably
just playing a prank on you.

488
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:20,794
Oh, Jesus. I'm just gonna see
if this fella needs help.

489
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,035
It's him...

490
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,998
What's the trouble?

491
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,869
That's him! Behind you!

492
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,315
Behind you!

493
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,911
"Susie Willis killed.
Trapped in car. "

494
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:37,676
"Survived by her father Benjamin,
a local fisherman. "

495
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,588
Elsa...

496
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:05,470
Elsa!
Open the door!

497
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,353
Elsa, open the door!
Jesus Christ, hurry!

498
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,278
What are you doing? Elsa!

499
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,991
Jesus Christ, hurry!
Open the door!

500
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,592
I'm coming.

501
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,993
- The Broad Street entrance is open.
- I'm being attacked.

502
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,594
You're what?

503
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:46,392
Lock the other door.
I'll call the police. Do what I say!

504
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,318
Elsa...

505
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,838
Elsa?

506
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,554
Elsa, where are you?

507
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,398
Ray.

508
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,748
Ray!

509
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:59,998
- What are you doing here?
- It wasn't David Egan we killed.

510
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,230
It was Susie's father. Ben Willis.

511
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:07,599
- But they found David's body.
- I think Willis killed David.

512
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:14,279
- Then we killed Willis?
- But what if he didn't die?

513
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,713
This is crazy.

514
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,553
Come aboard.

515
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:25,713
- We have to find Helen and Barry.
- We will.

516
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,989
You...

517
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,275
It's you.

518
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,830
Billy Blue.
You went to Missy's.

519
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,199
- You're the friend. The fisherman.
- I can explain. Julie, wait!

520
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,957
- Wait.
- Stop it!

521
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,959
- Please, help me.
- Easy, child.

522
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:15,669
I need to call the police.

523
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,469
On the boat! Hurry!

524
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,636
Are you in some kind of trouble?

525
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:13,709
Yes. I'm in a lot of trouble.

526
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:22,276
That's a shame.
Being it's the 4th of July and all.

527
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:27,719
Kids like you should be out
having fun. Drinking, partying, -

528
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:33,000
- running people over, getting away
with murder, things like that.

529
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,313
You...

530
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:43,634
- Ben Willis.
- Good. You did your homework, too.

531
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,599
Welcome aboard, Ray.

532
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,239
Open the door, Julie.
You've got no place to hide.

533
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,358
Come on. Julie.

534
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:46,194
- Happy 4th of July, Julie.
- Please. It was an accident.

535
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:51,115
When you leave a man for dead,
make sure he's really dead.

536
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:45,350
We never killed anyone.
This whole year was for...

537
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:50,514
The guilt was killing me.
I had to know who he was.

538
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:53,274
That's why I went to see Missy.

539
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:58,594
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but I wanted you back.

540
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,878
I couldn't lose you again.

541
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:08,717
I love you, Julie.
No one gets me the way you do.

542
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:13,395
I understand your pain.

543
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:25,474
Do you have any idea
why this man would want you dead?

544
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,470
None.

545
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:31,712
Here it comes.

546
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,079
Well, don't worry.

547
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:52,314
The body will turn up.
They usually do.

548
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:02,196
ONE YEAR LATER

549
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:06,638
I made the dean's list.
Thank you very much.

550
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,430
I miss you too, but I'll see you in
a couple of weeks. I love New York.

551
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:17,030
Of course I love you more.
You know that.

552
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,839
But I've got to take a shower.

553
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,913
- Julie, you got some mail.
- Thanks. Deb.

554
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,955
A towel.

555
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:34,911
Don't start with me.
You can ravage me in two weeks.

556
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,629
I love you too. Bye.

557
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,189

558
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:33,599
