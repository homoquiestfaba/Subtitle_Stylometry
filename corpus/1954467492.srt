1
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,267
Get this on the twix,
will you, Nell?

2
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,067
Chicken feed, Ralph I've said it once
I've said it a hundred times

3
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,074
I know, D.J.
Now, about Seattle...

4
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,076
Don't miss the meeting on the 23rd

5
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,942
I called the airport, Mr. Mulrooney
The Boston plane is on time

6
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,311
Then I'd better be going
Can't keep these people waiting

7
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,872
How about the Henderson deal?

8
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,247
Wire them two million five
Take it or leave it

9
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,309
I wonder if you'd okay this, D.J.

10
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,220
Not another electronics company, Paul
[Snaps Fingers]

11
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,225
We can pick it up for a song And since
we've gone into plastics so heavily...

12
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:43,421
Plastic, toys, electronics
What next?

13
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,624
There's one thing you young fellas
seem to forget

14
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,633
We are in the lumber business

15
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,828
We started out in lumber
and lumber is still number one

16
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,838
Of course, D.J.

17
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,476
But if it'll make you happy,
go ahead and buy it

18
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,808
Well, thank you, sir

19
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,510
- Oh, not that one, Gregg The Rolls
- The Rolls? Right, sir

20
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:08,543
May I have your undivided attention
for 30 seconds, D.J.?

21
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,715
- Yes, Ralph
- I can't emphasize enough

22
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,419
the success of the Seattle deal
depends on your being there

23
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,555
I'll do my best to make it, but in case
I miss, you've got all the facts

24
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,293
That's not good enough They don't
want me or Logan or Winkler

25
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,801
They've been promised D.J. Mulrooney

26
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,862
They want that 50,000 acres of timber
Now, that's our bait

27
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,874
- And don't you forget it
- Of course

28
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,410
But if you're not in Seattle,
the whole deal goes down the drain

29
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:35,641
I'll be there, Ralph
Now, will you please stop worrying?

30
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,149
Ah, there she is

31
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,552
As beautiful as the day
I first brought her home

32
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,284
Remember? We had just put together
that Sagatuck lumber deal

33
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,657
And all the profits went right into
this car I remember perfectly

34
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,561
Yeah Well, that was in the days
when I only had one million

35
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,565
Still had to impress people

36
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,101
- I'll be doing my own driving, Gregg
- Yes, sir

37
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:00,435
Special occasion I'm meeting
some very important people

38
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,202
You've only got a half an hour
to get to the airport

39
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,837
Don't worry I'll make it
I always do, don't I?

40
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,554
Five minutes early Why don't you run
your planes on time?

41
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,564
It was the tail wind, Mr. Mulrooney

42
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,566
Well, it's very important that
I should be here to meet them

43
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,730
- We're very sorry
- Where are they? Where are they? Where...

44
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,738
Grandfather!

45
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:39,377
- Hi, Grandfather
- Hi, Rodney

46
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,903
My goodness, but you've grown
And, Elizabeth...

47
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,382
Well, you look more like your mother
every time I see you

48
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,512
- How is she?
- Fine She told me to give you her love

49
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,558
- And Dad said he'll bring
you champagne from Paris
- Good

50
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,889
That's the sort
of a son-in-law I like

51
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,156
Oh, how were these passengers?
Well behaved, I hope

52
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,960
The perfect travelers It was
a pleasure to have them with us

53
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,058
- Good-bye, Elizabeth
- Good-bye

54
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,069
Good-bye, Rodney

55
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,047
Where are we going, Grandfather?

56
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,785
Oh, I thought maybe we'd head up
the Redwood Highway

57
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,793
I used to take your mother there
when she was your age

58
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,625
Then we'll follow our noses
on up to Seattle

59
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,632
Seattle?
Can we go on the yacht?

60
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,630
I've got a new one now
4,000-horsepower diesel

61
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,764
Does 25 knots,
if she's pushed

62
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,936
- Oh, boy!
- Cost nearly a million dollars

63
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,945
Well, how come
if you're so rich

64
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,607
you drive a funny
old car like this?

65
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,616
"Funny old car"?

66
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,051
I tell you, young man, this is a fine
car You won't find its like anymore

67
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:59,285
- Well, it's certainly a pretty car
- Yes, but how fast does it go?

68
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,520
Oh, fast enough
to get us there

69
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,154
When I get a car,
it's going to be a Maserati

70
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,994
Oh, Rodney, you're always
talking so big

71
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,125
Oh, there's no harm
in that, son

72
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,969
When I was a young lad in Ireland, I always
dreamt of owning myself a jaunting car

73
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,237
Ajaunting car?
Never heard of that make

74
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,507
Well, Rodney, my boy,
it was the Maserati of its time

75
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,038
Real cool Hot stuff
One horsepower

76
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,780
- One horsepower?
- Yes, sir

- Great

105
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,621
Where's the restaurant?

106
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,750
Right here I thought it'd be fun to have
our first meal together in the open air

107
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,455
- Look, Rodney
- "Mulrooney Grove"

108
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,489
Grandfather, are these
wonderful trees all yours?

109
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,901
Every single one of them
Mine, yours, everybody's

110
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,133
What did you do, buy 'em?

111
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,141
All that sign means is

112
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,871
that I had the privilege of seeing
that they'll always be here

113
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,879
- just for people to look at?
- Exactly

114
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,438
My, they're big

115
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,953
Must've taken
a long time to grow

116
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,784
Four thousand years
for some of them

117
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,019
Tuna Ham

118
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:53,224
So beautiful
Like being in fairyland

119
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,371
Don't go too far away now

120
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,931
Rodney's hungry, and there might not
be anything left when you get back

121
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,639
- Having trouble, son?
- No peanut butter and jelly

122
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,477
Oh, dig down They're probably
down near the bottom

123
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,011
You know, she...
she could be the one

124
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,142
I wouldn't if I were you
Don't do it

125
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:57,519
Well, of all of'em I've seen,
she's the one I think I could trust

126
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,684
- You can't trust any of them
- That's right That's right

127
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,754
- But I have to talk to someone
- [Owl] Talk to me

128
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,664
- Anytime
- [BlueJay] And us

129
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,668
Just as much as you like

130
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,829
Well, I have talked to you,
all of you

131
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,169
And there's not one of you
can help me with my problem

132
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,335
- Don't do it, Jasper
- [Owl] Only mean trouble

133
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,574
- What trouble?
- Gnome hunters, that's what

134
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,945
Gnome hunters,
all over the place

135
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,350
Our woods will be full of'em And none
of'em can keep their mouths shut

136
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,889
Blab, blab, blab

137
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,722
- No peace for any of us anymore
- No peace at all No peace at all

138
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,503
My mind's made up

139
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,802
[Screams]

140
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,434
I, uh, didn't mean to frighten you

141
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,477
Oh, you didn't

142
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,844
Yeah, but I'll bet you're
surprised to see a gnome

143
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,849
Oh, not really

144
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:02,013
I was just thinking what a lovely place
this is for gnomes

145
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,648
Are there many of you living here?

146
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,284
Well, that's... that's my problem

147
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,453
If it weren't for that, I wouldn't be
showing myself to a doo-deen

148
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,156
A "doo-deen"?

149
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,096
Well, that's what we
call you big people

150
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,602
Am I the first doo-deen
you've ever spoken to?

151
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,697
Yeah, yeah All my friends
advised against it, but...

152
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,708
Well, I had to talk to someone

153
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,267
Well, if I'm the first doo-deen
you've ever spoken to

154
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,279
how is it you speak
such good English?

155
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,544
Uh, English?

156
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,676
The language we've been talking

157
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,517
Well, now, don't that beat all

158
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,854
And here I've been wondering how come
you spoke such good Gnomish

159
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,325
And me father'd no more'n than
took his eyes off the leprechaun

160
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:49,094
for less time than it takes to say
"Seanny O'Shannon's shillelagh"

161
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,467
when, whoosh, the little creature up
and disappeared on him

162
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,405
You don't really believe in that
silly stuff, do you, Grandfather?

163
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,272
- Why not?
- There's still no peanut butter

164
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,108
- Oh, they probably got the labels mixed
- [Elizabeth] Grandfather!

165
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,444
Grandfather, please,
you've got to come quickly

166
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,541
- I promised him we'd be right back
- Promised who?

167
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,314
- The gnome The gnome!
- The what?

168
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,321
And he's got
a simply awful problem

169
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,483
Oh, not just a gnome, but a gnome with
a problem Now, that is something

170
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,493
- Hey, I found one
- Good

171
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,995
But, Grandfather,
he's waiting to talk to you

172
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,395
- To me? But why me?
- Because I told him

173
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,924
if anyone could help him
with his problem, it was you

174
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,632
- You've got to come He's waiting
- Well, come on, Rodney

175
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,573
We've got to go talk to a gnome

176
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,771
Now, Elizabeth, on the possibility
this little fellow isn't there...

177
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,610
- He'll be there
- About six inches high, I imagine

178
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,173
- Taller than that
- Little yellow cap
and buckles on his shoes?

179
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,185
His hat was green,
and I didn't notice any buckles

180
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,813
I don't understand that
In all the stories about leprechauns...

181
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,858
I didn't say he was a leprechaun
He said he was a gnome

182
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,986
Oh, a gnome
Well, that's different

183
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:54,624
That's the place
I'm here! I've brought him!

184
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,033
Yoo-hoo! Jasper!

185
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,367
- His name's Jasper
- Oh?

186
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,964
- Jasper!
- Jasper!

187
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,977
- Jasper!
- Jasper!

188
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,606
- Jasper!
- Jasper!

189
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,948
The girl, all right,
I maybe could go along

190
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,044
But how about him?

191
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:21,353
You ever seen
a fiercer-lookin' critter?

192
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,361
He, uh...

193
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,193
He does look awful shifty
about the eyes

194
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,597
Jasper! Jasper!

195
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,135
Maybe this is the wrong place
Forests can fool you

196
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,694
But, Grandfather,
this was the place

197
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,400
Well, it could be the little lep...
gnome had second thoughts

198
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,409
on seeing me, I mean

199
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,310
Now, a little girl, that's one thing,
but an old curmudgeon like myself...

200
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,750
- [Crying]
- And it could be in her imagination too

201
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,481
I didn't imagine him!
I did see him!

202
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,489
Of course you saw a gnome, darlin'

203
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,491
But not with these eyes
These up here

204
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,493
That's where all the little folks live

205
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,995
Like gnomes, elves, leprechauns,
whatever you want to call them

206
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,760
But, Grandfather, honest,
I talked to him Jasper!

207
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,301
Jasper!

208
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,236
They're making her into a fool,
and all on account of me

209
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,671
Come on, darling
We best be getting back

210
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,834
Now, you must be
really hungry by now

211
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,209
But he was right there
He was right there

212
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,506
I can't let it end like this
Hey, you!

213
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,678
- She did too see a gnome!
- Who said that?

214
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:26,691
- I think it's him
- Uh-oh Now you've done it

215
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,523
Come on out and show yourself

216
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,928
Don't do it, Jasper Don't do it

217
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,264
What kind of a trick is that
to play on a little girl?

218
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,306
- Come on, darling
- Oh, Grandfather

219
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,273
Hold on, you!

220
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:53,747
- Jasper!
- Seanny O'Shannon's shillelagh

221
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,947
There, Grandfather, you see?

222
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,081
Why

223
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,023
yes

224
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,823
A gnome
You see him, Rodney?

225
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,862
I still think it's
Elizabeth's imagination

226
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,962
Jasper, this is my brother Rodney
and my grandfather

227
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,032
Glad to see you, Jasper
Say hello to him, Rodney

228
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,203
- Hi
- [Jasper] Is this
the wizard you spoke of?

229
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,213
The one with all the solutions?

230
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,545
So you're the gnome
with the problem

231
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,550
Tell him what you told me

232
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:30,384
Well, instead of that, since seeing
is believing with you doo-deens

233
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,390
follow me

234
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,392
Come on!

235
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,188
Well, there's my problem

236
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,825
My old grandpa just lies there

237
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,064
a-growin' more "see-throughish"
with every passin' hour

238
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,073
What's making him
so see-throughish?

239
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:27,010
Well, I'm not an authority on gnomes

240
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,378
but if they're anything like
leprechauns, they live on and on

241
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:34,249
- But only if they want to
- You mean they just fade away?

242
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,722
Jasper, have you any idea what
made him lose his will to live?

243
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,283
Grandpa's given up all hope

244
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,592
of ever seeing me married
and having young'uns of my own

245
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,188
Why is that?

246
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:53,869
Well, Grandpa and me, we're,
uh, we're the last of the gnomes

247
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,908
There's no gnome maidens
for me to marry up with

248
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,136
Well, now, that is a serious problem

249
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,180
Jasper

250
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,615
Jasper boy, is that you I hear?

251
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,983
It is, Grandpa

252
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,784
I'm, uh... I'm talking with some friends

253
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,087
[Grandpa]
Oh, that's nice

254
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,925
That's nice I'm happy for ya

255
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:22,023
They're, uh, doo-deen friends

256
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,764
Mm, good Good
Now, go away... Doo-deens?

257
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,398
Now, Grandpa, before you get
your dander up, they mean to help us

258
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,102
Help from doo-deens?
You gone plumb out of your senses?

259
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,406
It's doo-deens that's been
the cause of all our troubles

260
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,175
I know that, Grandpa Only
these big'uns are, well, different

261
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,944
There ain't no such a thing
as a different doo-deen

262
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,541
That's why, in all my 900 years

263
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,452
I've never let one of'em so
much as lay an eye on my boot

264
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:47,185
- Now, Grandpa, if I may...
- Not one step further, doo-deen

265
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,284
Ailin' I may be

266
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:53,798
but not enough to let you get ahold
of me without puttin' up a fight

267
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,597
- My grandfather just wanted to help
- Help?

268
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,001
Sayin' you could help,
why would you wanna?

269
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,701
Because you've got a problem, and my
grandfather is good at solving problems

270
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,801
Well, you don't say

271
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,143
Jasper told me that there
are rumors about gnomes

272
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,148
living in other forests

273
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,343
Ah, idle cluckin' of gossipy animals

274
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,945
And Grandfather's got a wonderful car,
and he'll drive you anywhere

275
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,991
- Won't you, Grandfather?
- Now, just a minute, darlin'

276
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,789
- And what about the yacht?
- Oh, please, Grandfather

277
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,059
Well, dear, I do have
to be in Seattle

278
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,625
[Grandpa]
Supposin'I was to go with ya?

279
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,366
I hear tell how you big ones
treat free things in the forest

280
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,501
How ya put 'em in cages
and sell 'em as curiosities

281
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,603
Exhibit 'em to other doo-deens

282
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,308
Oh, we'd never do that,
would we, Grandfather?

283
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,552
We'll give you our most solemn word

284
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,487
we won't even mention
your existence to another soul

285
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,048
Nobody'd believe us anyway

286
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,755

288
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,433
Well, not that I got any hopes
of findin' gnomes, mind you

Well, I must say,
Jasper was right for once

329
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,301
- You doo-deens are different
- Thanks, Grandpa

330
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,573
You don't have to keep calling me
Grandpa The name's Knobby

331
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,740
Knobby, just call me D.J.
Everyone does

332
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:35,753
D.J. Don't come much shorter than that
[Laughing]

333
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,154
Grandfather, where do we start
this gnome-hunting?

334
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,193
Well, I figure the most likely place
would be a virgin forest

335
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,821
Now, I happen to know of a 50,000-acre
patch of timber

336
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,196
that's never been touched by...
by doo-deens

337
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,100
- Is it very far?
- [D. J] Oh, we can't make it tonight

338
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,697
We'll have to stop over somewhere
But we'll make it easy in the morning

339
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,870
Jasper, what happened
to all the other gnomes?

340
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,880
Well, I was, uh, too little
to remember much about it

341
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,473
But I've heard it said that
they migrated, a lot of'em

342
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,847
'Tweren't that at all

343
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,751
Well, what about all the fern seeds
failin' and the food gettin' scarce?

344
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,755
- Why, I heard that...
- I don't care what you "heared"

345
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,757
I'm tellin' ya I was there

346
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,851
It was the choppin' down of the trees
that made the gnomes disappear

347
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,556
I remember it
like it was yesterday

348
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,759
Everything was
so pleasant and peaceful

349
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,268
Everybody mindin'
their own business

350
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,965
Then all of a sudden, "Timber!"

351
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,564
Trees started
a-comin'down, a-fallin'.

352
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,974
And a-crashin' like giants,
they came down

353
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:37,003
It was "timber" on the right
and "timber" on the left

354
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,947
And the gnomes
a-panickin' and a-runnin'

355
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,645
and a-fallin' down and
a-bumpin' into each other

356
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,156
And comin' right behind 'em
all the time was the big axes

357
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,021
a-slashin' and a-cuttin'
and, "Timber!"

358
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,583
Grandpa, I remember the...

359
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,993
You remember nothin'
You weren't no bigger'n that

360
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,190
I grabbed you in my arms
and started to run

361
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,461
And right behind me
I hear, "Timber!"

362
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,935
And I looked back
over my shoulder

363
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,598
and here come one of those giants
fallin' right at me

364
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:06,110
- How did you escape?
- I didn't It landed right on me

365
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,510
Did it kill you?

366
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,673
No I ducked down
a rabbit hole

367
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,617
But I was under that there tree
for 40 days and 40 nights

368
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,779
And when I finally
dug myself out

369
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,848
there were dead trees everywhere
and nary a gnome in sight

370
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:24,726
- How awful
- Oh, the carnage

371
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,491
And them infernal axe swingers

372
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,534
They wouldn't give up
They kept a-comin' and a-comin'

373
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,297
And the worst of'em all
was that Mulrooney outfit

374
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,838
- Mulrooney?
- But, Grandfather...

375
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,932
Shh! Don't interrupt
while he's talking

376
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,375
I never seen the blackguard
himself face-to-face

377
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,709
but I seen them henchmen
of his often enough

378

and a-destroyin'.

00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,328
dwell the regal giants
of the forest

492
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,804
the great sequoias,
monarchs of all they survey

493
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:51,103
Pictures, Grandpa,
from right out in the air

494
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,109
Well, take a look
It'll make you feel better

495
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,078
I ain't gonna feel better
till I get out of here

496
00:31:56,147 --> 00:32:01,915
Older than written history itself,
they tower above their surroundings

497
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,420
Look It's the Redwoods

498
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:10,052
Yet, in man's scheme of things,
these great trees have practical use

499
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,289
as well as aesthetic value

500
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,759
Well, what do you know?
My Redwoods

501
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,200
From these forests,
selected trees are taken

502
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,708
And when the lumberjack's cry
of "timber" echoes through the woods...

503
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,710
[Grandpa Yelling]

504
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,214
Them bloody blackhearted
blackguard doo-deens!

505
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:35,309
- [Grandpa Yelling]
- Timber! And another giant comes down

506
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,412
to serve the needs of mankind

507
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,390
- Settle down, Grandpa
- [Click]

508
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,950
Shh Now, calm yourself

509
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,258
[Ringing]

510
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:49,630
Hello Yes

511
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:53,262
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you,
miss, but there's been an accident

512
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,397
A bad accident

513
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,806
Oh, no Not grandfather

514
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:02,437
I'm afraid so It's your
grandfather's Rolls-Royce

515
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,447
Is he hurt?

516
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,973
- Well, he can't talk to you right now
- But where is he?

517
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:11,647
- Where did it happen?
- At the corner of Elm and Grange

518
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,987
And he wants you
to come right away

519
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,288
I'll be right there

520
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,940
- They don't make 'em like this anymore
- You're right there, sir

521
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,946
These new jobs are all right
on the highway

522
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,039
but you take a car like this,
it's built to go places

523
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,448
Yes, sir That'll be 620, sir
Out of 10

524
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,147
Keep the change It's nice to talk
to a man who appreciates cars

525
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:21,021
- Yes, sir Thank you, sir
- [Tires Screech]

526
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,823
- Grandfather, you're all right!
- Of course we're all right

527
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,888
They said there'd been an accident,
that you and Rodney were hurt

528
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:31,025
- Who told you?
- Someone on the telephone

529
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,899
In the car, quickly

530
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,773
Watch out, sir!

531
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:21,977
Yeah All right
Thank you

532
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,819
Only what I expected
Nobody in the hotel saw anything

533
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,915
Why don't you call the police?

534
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:31,120
No, not the police Tell the police,
and the papers would be full of it

535
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,528
That's just what we promised
Knobby wouldn't happen

536
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,124
This is a job
for my own security staff

537
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,635
I can trust my own team,
and that's just what we need now

538
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,504
Operator, would you get me
person-to-person San Francisco,

539
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:47,771
Mr. Ralph Yarby?

540
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,679
- How am I doing, Doc?
- Sound as a dollar

541
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:55,014
- [Woman] Mulrooney Medical
- I only hope D.J. checks out as well

542
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:59,921
- If I can ever get him up here
- Oh, yes He's here

543
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,893
Mr. Yarby, it's for you
D.J.'s on the line

544
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,293
D.J.?

545
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,265
D.J., where are you? We've been
trying to reach you for...

546
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,801
Ralph, they're gone Missing

547
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,837
- Gone? Not...
- That's right

548
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:18,842
- Kidnapped
- Well, have you notified the police yet?

549
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,936
Ralph-boy, they're the last ones
in the world I want to call now

550
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,004
Good thinking, D.J.

551
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,948
The press get a hold of this
and the kidnappers get scared

552
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,212
and the children have had it

553
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,983
Who said anything about children?
Now, listen, Ralph

554
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,219
this is gonna be hard for someone like you
to accept, but you've got to believe me

555
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:39,457
- Do you understand?
- Well, I always understand, D.J.

556
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,897
Well, it's the gnomes
who have been kidnapped

557
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,492
The gnomes

558
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,666
Uh, D.J., something seems to have
gone wrong with the phone

559
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,231
Would you mind
repeating that last?

560
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,811
Can you hear me now?

561
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,510
You're coming through clear now

562
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,644
I said a pair of gnomes
Little people

563
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,086
Now, there's not
a minute to lose

564
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:09,092
I want you to put our security people
on this right away And I mean right now!

565
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,027
Security
Uh, right now Right away

566
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:15,497
And remember, nobody's to know about
this besides our own people

567
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,500
or there's no telling
what might happen

568
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,628
You couldn't be more right, D.J.

569
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,230
Look Where are you right now?

570
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,275
Cedar Creek Lodge

571
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,402
Right I'll fly up there
and meet you there tonight

572
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,470
All right Good-bye
Get me security

573
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,881
This isn't a case for security

574
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,885
What D.J. needs now
is a psychiatrist

575
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,820
- You think he's lost his marbles?
- I'll get in touch with Conrad Ramsey

576
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,823
He's got a place not far from there

577
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,825
An old estate he's turned
into a private sanitarium

578
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,827
D.J. will never sit still
for a psychiatrist

579
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,557
Suppose he thinks he's meeting
a private detective?

580
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:51,295
An expert with a great organization
for handling cases such as this

581
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,395
Well, yes
Yes, I think that might work

582
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,281
[Barking]

583
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,959
I still wish you'd brought a couple
of our own security men along

584
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,962
Our men are good, D.J.

585
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,521
but as you just said, this is a special
case, and it needs a special man

586
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,932
But this Ramsey guy, has he handled
cases like this before?

587
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,936
One after another

588
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,938
Funny I never heard of him

589
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,451
Good evening, gentlemen
Welcome to Five Oaks

590
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,011
Thanks
Quite a place you've got here

591
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,023
You know, this Ramsey
must do all right

592
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,719
This layout makes Brinks and Pinkerton
look like a couple of pikers

593
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:53,457
In all honesty, D.J., you can't even
put them in the same category

594
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,500
Now, don't say
it can't be done

595
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,900
Yarby tells me that you often work
on cases like mine

596
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,770
- Oh, yes, Mr. Mulrooney All the time
- Locating lost gnomes?

597
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,775
Well, gnomes, no

598
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,277
But we have uncovered
some strange things in our time

599
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,144
- Very well, then
- Now, getting back to the little men

600
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,547
You say you first saw them
in the Redwoods?

601
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,450
That's right We took them
as far as Cedar Creek with us

602
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,715
And that's where
they were kidnapped

603
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,690
- Where they disappeared, you mean
- I said they were kidnapped

604
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,353
- and I mean kidnapped!
- Yes, yes, yes

605
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:28,558
Now, during the trip, did anybody else see
them besides you and your grandchildren?

606
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:32,693
Someone else had to see them, of course,
or how would they have gotten kidnapped?

607
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,503
Well, that's a good question

608
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,634
Yes, and that's one that you have
to find the answer to

609
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,702
Everything
you've said thus far

610
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,146
leads me to believe
that you did see gnomes

611
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,184
Of course I saw them!
What do you think I'm doing here?

612
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,448
But not with these eyes
With those up here

613
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,319
That is where all the little people,
the gnomes, the gremlins

614
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,325
or whatever you like
to call them live

615
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,883
[Buzzing]

616
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,021
Ralph, this guy thinks I'm nuts

617
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,031
- Now, D.J., just calm...
- I say he thinks I'm nuts!

618
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,694
- He thinks that I'm nuts!
- Not "nuts, '"Mr. Mulrooney

619
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,763
Just, shall we say, over fatigued

620
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,845
What is this, Ramsey?
Who are these fellas?

621
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,108
Uh, my assistants

622
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,174
- Would you come with me, please?
- Yarby, what have you done?

623
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,619
Yarby, you double-crosser I ought to
break you in a dozen pieces!

624
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,454
Let go of me, you thugs
Let go of me Yarby, you're fired!

625
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:32,690
Why are you doing this to me?

[TV: Gunshots, Shouting]

627
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,861
Don't you think it's about time
for bed, children?

628
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,167
We'll wait up for grandfather

629
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,332
Well, he's liable to be tied up
for a long time

[Phone Rings]

631
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,605
Hello Grandfather?

632
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,013
Oh It's for you

633
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,450
Thank you, Rodney
I'll take it in the bedroom

634
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,388
Wait just a minute
You can hang up now, Rodney

635
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,392
Thank you

636
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,931
[Whispering]
Rodney, that is not nice

637
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,934
Mr. Yarby, am I glad
to hear from you

638
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,664
- How are the children?
- Fine Only...

639
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:18,105
Well, I'm sure
they suspect something

640
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,269
Oh, I was afraid they might
Are you free to talk?

641
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,575
- Yes
- Well, uh

642
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,842
here's the way things
shape up from here

643
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,077
It's much worse
than we thought

644
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,315
D.J. got violent

645
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:35,791
- Oh, how awful
- He's going to be here for quite some time

646
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,990
Dr Ramsey's fixed up a room
for me next to D.J.'s

647
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,999
So, if you want me for anything,
at least for the next couple of days

648
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,365
you can call me
at this number

Oh, me poor legs

832
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,294
I can't even climb out of here,
let alone escape

833
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:26,392
You leave that to me

834
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,494
Maybe if you go
with that Quaxton fella...

835
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,505
be in his show like he said...
you'd make out

forest down the road a piece

for your old grandpa

01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,718
Oh, but never mind him

866
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:26,244
Don't you see? We don't have to

01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:30,122
It's just you and me

Come one step closer

872
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,736
Oh, come on now, little fella
I'm not trying to hurt you

873
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,969
Besides, the gun
isn't even loaded

[Hammer Clicks]

875
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,749
See? What did I tell you?

876
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:56,342

learn to listen to me

877

- once in a while
- [Hammer Clicks]

878
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:05,523
Now, you shouldn't
have done that, little friend

879
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:08,189
You just might have hurt me

880
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:13,361
Fact is,
you might have killed me!

881
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:23,610
All right, Quaxton,

[Quaxton] I'm warning you
Don't make me mad

891
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:55,362
When I get mad, I get dangerous,
and I'll wring your neck if I have to

892
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,303
Now remember, young fella

893
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:00,831
I can make just as much money
with a stuffed gnome

894
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:04,243
So from now on, I think you better
play it my way, huh?

895
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:07,545
I mean it This is your last chance

896
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,778
I'm through being nice, kid

897
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:12,821
Now, you hold still
or I'll break you in pieces

898
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,860
Jasper!
Are you all right?

899
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:20,862
Yeah, but Grandpa's gone and I'm...

900
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,989
I'm worried about him
He's wanting to fade away

901
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:26,701
- You skunk!

904
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,541
Now, now, now, now, please! Watch it
I wasn't trying to hurt him

905
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,579
Honest I wasn't I was only trying
to make a little deal

906
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:40,443
Wait just a minute!
He's my gnome

907
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,450
You said you wanted
nothing more to do with him

908
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,452
- Where's Knobby?
- There's a forest down the road

909
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,750
I said I'd meet him there

910
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,620
Now, look, Mr. Mulrooney
You're a businessman

911
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,886
I have a proposition to make
to you on a good thing

Listen, you're missing a...
You're missing a bet!

913

[Sobbing]

917
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,176
Have you seen anything of an old gaffer
and a couple of kids

918
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:16,582
- in a Rolls-Royce?
- Rolls-Royce? Like that one?

Yes, like that one

[Moaning]

927
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:52,721
Grandpa, there's
somebody tailing us

928
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:55,223
Anybody we know?

929
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:59,284
- It's Mr. Yarby
- Mr. Yarby? Well, well, well

[Tires Squealing]

931
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,299
Keep out of sight, Jasper

932
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,737
All right, Mr. Mulrooney

933
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:14,038
But why, Grandfather?
Why not stop and let them see him?

934
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,510
That would prove
you weren't crazy

935
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,513
Not on your life, honey

936
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,674
It'll be a cold day in the tropics
when D.J. Mulrooney

937
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:25,016
does anything just to prove to Ralph
Yarby that he's got all his marbles

938
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:34,188
Faster, man, faster

939
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,288
Yes, Mr. Yarby

940
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,367
- They're gaining on us!
- Oh, no!

941
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,528
They won't for long
Let's see how well they keep up

942
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,538
when the going gets rough

01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:13,895
Jasper, I thought I told you
to keep out of sight

946
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,905
I'm trying to, Mr. Mulrooney

947
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,999
[Groaning]

948
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,853
- Look where you're going, man!
- I can't see the road for the trees!

949
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:59,039
Don't stop, stupid
Get going! Get going!

950
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:21,228
Get that hood closed
We can't see where we're going

951
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:23,829
I know, Mr. Yarby, but how?

952
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,478
Give her the gas!
Full speed ahead!

953
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,944
I said ahead!
Put on the brakes!

954
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:42,183
Maybe you'd care to try

955
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,261
They're with us again

956
01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:57,670
Well, let's see
how they are on cornering

957
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:13,788
Hold tight, everybody!

958
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,722
Whee! I take it all back,
Grandfather

959
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:20,728

961
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,403

01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,545
Turn! Turn! Turn!

964
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,309
Mr. Yarby, would you
care to drive?

965
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:47,851
Aah!

966
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:57,430
What did we lose now?

967
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,491
Only the rear wheels

968
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:20,013
Look out, Ralph!

970
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:36,198
They don't make 'em
like they used to, huh, Ralph?

971
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,745

- Knobby!
- Grandpa!

979
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,236
You don't think
he's faded away?

01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,704
Oh, no! Knobby!

- It's nice to be here
- Hi

993
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:50,608
And is this the young one who would
like to meet some other gnomes?

994
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,740
Yes, sir l-I sure would

[Chuckling]
Well, all right

996
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:13,664
My boy, if you were afraid that you
were the last of the gnomes, take heart

997
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:16,500
[Laughs] There's lots of us...

1006
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:44,294
I think what the boy's trying to say is,
"Are there any girl gnomes?"

1007

[Laughs] Well, of course
How stupid of me

01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:09,707
And last but not least,
poor Violet there

1049
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,939

The one he wants?
Oh, my goodness

1055
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:45,205
It's not the male
that picks his mate

1056
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:47,340
It's the "she-male"
that picks the date

1057
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,714
It'll all end out all right
It's the oldest law in nature

1058

- I never heard such nonsense
- What are you talking about, Knobby?

1059
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:55,985
You know that whenever we have
a bumper crop of females

1060
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:58,424
we like to give every maiden a chance

1061

with whoever picks him?

What are they doing to Jasper?

1067
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:37,698
Oh, just a little complication

1068
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,700
You know, I thought of it myself

1069
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:42,362

It's like a greased pig chase
back in Ireland

1074
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:03,090
The one who catches him
gets to keep him

1075
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:05,092
It's not very romantic, is it?

1076
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,128
Form your circle!

[Knobby] Watch it, boy!
They're tricky!

1088
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:32,736
For a man to win this game, he's got
to have eyes in the back of his head

- Ow!
