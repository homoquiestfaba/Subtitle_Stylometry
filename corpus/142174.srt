1
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,414
Oh, thank you.
They're pretty peaches.

2
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:29,001
- Yes, ma'am.
- So, how you been?

3
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,129
I'm pretty good,
I reckon.

4
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,924
You had any health problems
since I saw you last?

5
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,845
- Ma'am?
- Have you been sick?

6
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,599
Well, back's been
hurtin' a little.

7
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,059
No, no, it's not your back.

8
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,438
Have you been
bleeding somewhere?

9
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,483
Well...

10
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,446
- Yes, ma'am, a little.
- Yeah.

11
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,452
- Have you been to a doctor?
- Oh, I...

12
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,537
I don't much like
going to no doctors.

13
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,999
Well, I think
maybe you should go.

14
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,960
No, it's not
a venereal disease.

15
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,672
I just think it's some kind of
kidney or some bladder infection.

16
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,800
But it's been around
for a while.

17
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,969
Could lead to some
more serious problems.

18
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,140
Do you want me
to call a doctor for you?

19
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,853
- All right.
- Okay.

20
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,776
You kids get on to bed now.
It's nearly 9:00.

21
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,738
Ah, Mama, can I stay up
just a little bit?

22
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,324
No.
You heard me, mister.

23
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,955
Mama?

24
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,332
What does "fuck" mean?

25
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:53,001
It's a bad word, hon,
for something nice.

26
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:56,588
But what does it mean?

27
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,590
Well, it means making love.

28
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,718
It's how your daddy and me
made your brothers and you.

29
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:07,182
Take his turtles off, hon.

30
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:10,143
- Mike, did you hear me?
- What?

31
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,354
I said get to bed.

32
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,652
Oh, Mike, your lip's
dragging the floor.

33
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,655
- It's gonna freeze like that.
- You act like I'm a kid.

34
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,824
You are a kid, honey.

35
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,884
Valerie, you may as well
take your glasses off.

36
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,429
I know he's been hitting you again.

37
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:31,350
- I see your lip.
- Oh, no.

38
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,102
Oh, it...
it just embarrasses me.

39
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,855
It's okay.

40
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,066
Come on.

41
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,197
He got worse.

42
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,659
I went to the store yesterday
'cause we's out of some things.

43
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:53,163
And he got home from work early,
before I could get back.

44
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,501
He was waiting with a razor strap.
My legs are all cut up.

45
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:02,214
And I got welts the size of
footballs on my back and my legs.

46
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:06,218
I feel guilty, you payin' me money
to tell you to get away from him.

47
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,220
You got to get help.

48
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:13,392
- Legal help.
- You don't know Donnie Barksdale.

49
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,811
He'll kill me if I leave him.
He'll find me.

50
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,021
He said he would.

51
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,655
No, he's not crazy enough
to kill anybody.

52
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:30,075
He's just
an insecure redneck.

53
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,204
What?

54
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,293
I think he's got
a woman on the side.

55
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,628
Yeah, he's been
laying out at night.

56
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,093
Excuse me,
but the school's on the phone.

57
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,345
They say Mike's
in some kind of trouble.

58
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,366
Mrs. Wilson.

59
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,786
Hi. Come on in.
Have a seat.

60
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,915
- Where... where's Mike?
- He's in the infirmary.

61
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,959
Now, it's nothing to get
worked up about. He's fine.

62
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,504
He's got a few...
Sit down.

63
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:26,548
He's got a few,
nicks and bruises.

64
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,427
I think he might have a... have
a pretty good black eye by tomorrow.

65
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,471
But he's...
he's okay.

66
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,766
- He was in another fight?
- Yes, he was.

67
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:41,480
His grades are... are getting
worse too. How's he doing at home?

68
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:46,527
Not much better.
He's real distant.

69
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,112
Well, Mrs. Wilson,

70
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,657
I don't pretend to be
a psychologist, but,

71
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,910
it's obvious to me that your boy's
got a lot of anger in him.

72
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:04,336
Well, it's about this time
last year his daddy passed away.

73
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,588
He's still real
messed up over it.

74
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,467
Yeah. I never knew your husband.
I understand he was a fine man.

75
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,554
Yes, he was.

76
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,892
Well, I don't know how you
feel about therapy, but...

77
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,770
If you think Mike needs somebody to
talk to, I know a gentleman over...

78
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,857
Mike doesn't need a therapist,
Mr. Collins. He can talk to me.

79
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,112
Do you think he will, though?

80
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:34,616
I'm sorry, Wayne. I didn't know
you had anybody in here.

81
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,077
- Oh, hi.
- Ruby wasn't at her desk.

82
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,497
Yeah, she's out sick today.
Mrs. Wilson, this is Jessica King,

83
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,541
- my fiancee.
- Nice to meet you.

84
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,252
You too.

85
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,964
We're just going to be
a couple of minutes. Okay.

86
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:52,801
I gotta go anyway.
I got people waiting.

87
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,887
Thanks a lot,
Mr. Collins.

88
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,141
- I'm real sorry about all this.
- Oh, it's my job.

89
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:02,144
He's just a boy,
that's all.

90
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,357
You're not that Wilson that's
a fortune-teller, are you?

91
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,234
I don't call myself that.

92
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:12,237
- I'd love you to read my fortune.
- I'm pretty booked up.

93
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,781
Do you think we'll live
happily ever after?

94
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,852
What's the matter?

95
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,021
You see something bad?

96
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,815
Of course not.

97
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,276
No, I'm sure you'll
be real happy together.

98
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:18,220
- Hey, how you gettin' along today?
- I'm fine, Buddy.

99
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:22,432
Except the fact I can't keep my car
door from just flying right open.

100
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,893
Have you got the time
to fix it?

101
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:29,106
I can get to it,
about an hour or two.

102
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,149
You wanna wait?

103
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,444
No. I got to get home.
I got people coming.

104
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,363
Hey, you just want...
you just wanna leave it here,

105
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,365
and I'll...
I'll carry you on home?

106
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,577
I can have it to you by... probably
by 6:00. That gonna be all right?

107
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,455
- Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
- All right. All right.

108
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,416
- Buddy?
- Yeah?

109
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,586
I'm a little... I'm
a little low on my money this week.

110
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,213
- I was just wondering if...
- Don't you worry about... No, really.

111
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,049
- No, stop it. Oh, come on, look.
- I feel bad.

112
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,802
For all that
you've done for me,

113
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,430
I just... I just think
the world of you.

114
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,143
You're about the only one
I call a friend to me.

115
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,897
Thank you.

116
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,482
Yeah, you know.
Annie.

117
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,902
I'll get the truck.

118
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,070
Take your time.

119
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,454
How you been, Buddy?

120
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:30,417
I've been having some...
some bad thoughts lately.

121
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,337
But I, you know...
Yesterday, I was feeling so happy.

122
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,756
- Yeah?
- I was feeling on top of the world.

123
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,883
Good on you.

124
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:41,512
I didn't even feel
like I needed my medicine.

125
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,722
I took it anyway.

126
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:47,559
You know, I'm getting...
I'm getting hooked on that stuff.

127
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,104
Well, I think you're gonna have
a lot of happy days, Buddy.

128
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,275
Yeah, you're gonna
get better and better.

129
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:59,321
Well, I believe you
when you say so.

130
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,577
Buddy?

131
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,121
Honey?

132
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,086
Honey, what's wrong?

133
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,803
You have to tell me.
You have to tell me now.

134
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,556
I'll... I'll tell you, hon.

135
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:30,978
If I look
into a blue diamond...

136
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,857
and I think
a negative thought,

137
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,361
am I gonna die?

138
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,613
No.

139
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,992
You're not gonna die.

140
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,369
You're not gonna die,
Buddy.

141
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:54,835
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

142
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,337
Oh, look...

143
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,424
Okay. Well, thank you.
'Cause if you had said ''yes,''

144
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,510
I would have to kill myself
before the sun goes down.

145
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:07,389
Oh, Buddy. Oh, honey.

146
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,684
You don't have
to kill yourself, honey.

147
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,562
- You know I'll always tell you.
- Oh, man.

148
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,981
- I'll always tell you, Buddy.
- Oh, man.

149
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:20,360
You're fine. You can always
talk to me, Buddy. Always.

150
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,613
- Oh, don't use that, honey.
- I feel embarrassed.

151
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,824
- No. Here. Huh?
- Oh, no.

152
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,911
- I can't soil that.
- Buddy, I want you to have it.

153
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:33,040
- This one's Ben's. I don't...
- He'd want you to have it.

154
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,417
Thank you.
Thank you.

155
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,170
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

156
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,089
- All right.
- All right.

157
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,967
I can walk home. You don't
have to drive me. You can...

158
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:49,181
No, no. No, I'm... I'm good.
I'm good.

159
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,725
- Yeah? You sure scared me, hon.
- Oh, yeah.

160
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,019
No, I'm all right.
I'm all right.

161
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,606
All right. You just take it
nice and slow.

162
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,486
Nice and slow.

163
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,011
Could I help you?

164
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,263
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Donnie Barksdale.

165
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:15,642
I'm sorry to bother you so late, but
I believe you know my wife Valerie.

166
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:19,146
Yes, I do.
I know who you are.

167
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,481
Can I come in
and talk to you?

168
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:25,110
It's about my wife.
Something's happened to her.

169
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:31,033
What's happened?
She okay?

170
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,328
Well, no, she's not, ma'am.

171
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,122
Ma'am, I promise.
I'll just take a minute.

172
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,462
All right.
Come on.

173
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,399
What's happened is she's getting
her head filled full of shit...

174
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,777
by a goddamn
Satan worshipper.

175
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,697
Or a damn good con artist,
one of the two.

176
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:14,868
I know she's been coming over
to see you and your damn voodoo.

177
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,871
You tell her bad things
about me, don't you?

178
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,501
You ain't no better
than a Jew or a nigger.

179
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,267
Do you know
what this is?

180
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,310
It's a voodoo doll.

181
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:45,399
I'm going to use this voodoo doll
on you, some of your own medicine.

182
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,609
If you don't stop
seeing my wife,

183
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,862
I'm stickin' me a pin
in this thing every night...

184
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,490
till you learn
to leave folks alone.

185
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,578
Go back to bed.
Everything's fine.

186
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,418
I bet you love those
little children, don't you?

187
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,503
And I bet they need
their mama, don't they?

188
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,966
- What's your name?
- Get your ass out of my house!

189
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:14,469
Don't you threaten me or my kids.
Now, what I do here is my business.

190
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,847
If your wife has any sense,
she'll leave you so far behind,

191
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,390
you'll never find her.

192
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,435
Now you get out of here
before I have you thrown in jail.

193
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,945
Messing with the Devil
is gonna get you burned.

194
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,989
Everybody knows that.

195
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,035
I'll see you soon, boys.

196
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,628
Go back to bed.
Come on.

197
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,771
- Something smells like cat pee.
- It's perfume, Ben.

198
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,398
And you're not supposed to cuss
in front of appointments.

199
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,442
Something smells like cat pee.
Something smells like cat pee.

200
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,444
- Something smells like cat pee.
- Be quiet!

201
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:16,281
He's got a great sense of humor.

202
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,036
Oh, he loves you.

203
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:25,123
Valerie. Oh, honey,
you know, you should 't be here.

204
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,379
I'm sorry about
the other night.

205
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,340
Oh, that's okay.
I can take care of myself.

206
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,843
And I hate
coming over here, but...

207
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:41,640
I really need
to talk to you.

208
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,312
Maybe you could read for me.
Under a bridge or something.

209
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:52,067
All right, I'll read for you. But
you got to start listening to me.

210
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,903
I can't leave him.
Don't you understand?

211
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:59,324
Hon, he's gonna keep hurting you
till he puts you in the hospital.

212
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,493
I don't have anything
to look forward to.

213
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,329
Maybe you can
give me some hope.

214
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,124
Oh, Valerie, hon, I don't know
how to make myself any clearer...

215
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,835
- Valerie!
- Oh, Annie! Annie, it's him! No!

216
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,837
- Calm down. I'll call the law.
- No. No.

217
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,464
No, Annie, no! If you're
my friend, you won't! No!

218
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:19,261
I'll deal with you later,
you goddamn bitch!

219
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,471
You witch!

220
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,849
Get your ass in the truck!

221
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,311
That ain't fast enough!

222
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:31,648
I told you not to come here!

223
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:36,153
- You let her go!
- All right! All right!

224
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:41,950
- Get in!
- Mike, you stay there!

225
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:44,161
What did I fucking tell you?

226
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,247
All right!

227
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,711
Sweet Jesus.

228
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,967
Mike? Y'all bring
Miss Francis her clothes.

229
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,431
Thanks, hon.

230
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,192
Granny.

231
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,486
Hey, Annabelle.

232
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:24,201
Gran... Granny,
what are you doing here?

233
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,453
I brought you
some persimmons, hon.

234
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:30,249
Remember how you liked persimmons
when you was little?

235
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:35,212
Granny, you're not
supposed to be here.

236
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,339
How... How'd you get here?

237
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:39,842
Oh, it ain't far to walk.

238
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:45,597
That boy's got
your granddaddy's eyes.

239
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,020
Well, hon,

240
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,189
I better get back.

241
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:57,359
Looks like
there's a storm coming.

242
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:00,779
No, Granny,
it... it's clear.

243
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:19,131
Annie, always use
your instinct, honey.

244
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:52,080
Now you tell Miss Francis
I'll be home by 9:30, okay?

245
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,458
- Bring back something.
- All right, I promise.

246
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,252
- I love you too, Mama.
- I know. And I love you too, hon.

247
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,047
- Be good. Bye.
- Bye, Mama.

248
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,508
You ready?

249
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,843
I don't know why
I let you talk me into this.

250
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:07,387
'Cause it's time you quit
living like a nun, that's why.

251
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:11,141
Don't worry. You're going to be
the prettiest girl here, next to me.

252
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,602
You still a married man?

253
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:16,355
I don't know about that.

254
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:20,526
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

255
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:23,862
- Do we pay him now or...
- I sign for it later.

256
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:26,073
Is it good?

257
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,535
- Annie, there he is.
- Who?

258
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:32,830
That guy I... That guy I was
telling you about. Look at him.

259
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:36,792
He's right over there by the bar.
Don't he look like Antonio Banderas?

260
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,337
Oh, my God! He saw me! Shit!
He saw me staring at him.

261
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,634
All right, get your cards out. Tell
me if he's gonna come over here.

262
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,719
I don't have my cards with me.
I am off-duty.

263
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,847
Hello, Mrs. Wilson.

264
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,559
- It's Annie.
- Sit down. You're blocking my view.

265
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,356
- Sorry. You remember Jessica?
- Hi, Annie.

266
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,233
I didn't know you were a member
of the country club.

267
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:04,403
I'm not.
I kind of tagged along with Linda.

268
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:08,198
- How nice. It's a great outfit.
- Thank you.

269
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:12,161
- What's Mike up to tonight?
- Moping around his baby-sitters.

270
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,580
Yeah? He's...
He's a great kid.

271
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,374
I was actually thinking you should
have him come down to school and...

272
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:20,419
Come on, Wayne. Let's not talk
shop tonight, all right?

273
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,588
- Let's just have fun.
- Okay.

274
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,424
- Hi there, fun-seekers.
- Hey, there.

275
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:28,677
- How about a dance with Daddy?
- Of course I will, handsome.

276
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,393
Mr. King, I don't know
if you know, Annie Wilson.

277
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:40,355
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I think I've seen you at church.

278
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:44,276
- That is quite a dress, Miss Linda.
- I'm glad somebody noticed.

279
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,947
- You want to give it a try?
- Oh, no. No, I don't think so.

280
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,282
No, thank you.

281
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:54,203
Come on. I asked you to dance,
not walk on hot coals.

282
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:56,955
When was the last time
you danced?

283
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,625
I think it's so long,
I've forgotten how to do it.

284
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:03,921
Well, I'll make you look good then,
'cause I'm a terrible dancer.

285
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,591
Wayne.

286
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,135
I'll dance.

287
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,806
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

288
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,101
Missed your big chance.

289
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:41,250
Thank you.

290
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,641
Somebody
might come in here.

291
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:00,477
I guess you
better fuck me fast.

292
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:16,702
You having a good time?

293
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:22,040
Me neither.

294
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,256
You seen Jessica around?

295
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:35,137
She up and disappeared on me again.
She's got a way of doing that.

296
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:43,020
- What do you think of Jessica?
- She's... She's very beautiful.

297
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:46,732
Yeah, the main thing
about her, she's just...

298
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,276
so full of life.

299
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:52,112
We're a little different
in that respect.

300
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:55,073
Oh.
I'm used to tennis shoes.

301
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,373
This kind of reminds me
when I was a kid.

302
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:06,668
I'd sit out on that porch.

303
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:09,922
I'd have so many thoughts,
just couldn't count 'em.

304
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,090
How'd you
wind up in Brixton?

305
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:15,093
My husband. He got a job here
at the cable plant.

306
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,263
Right.

307
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,935
What?

308
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:28,273
Did... Did you know...

309
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,527
something was going
to happen to your husband?

310
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,533
In an E.S.P. kind of way?

311
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:44,206
- Well, I don't know...
- You don't believe in it.

312
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:49,086
I don't know.
I guess I just...

313
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,465
I don't believe there
are any great mysteries in life.

314
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,552
I kind of figure what
you see is what you get.

315
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:04,434
Well,

316
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:07,312
I didn't know that there
was going to be an explosion.

317
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:11,316
But... the night before,
I had this real bad,

318
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,485
bad dream, you know.

319
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:16,405
I dreamt that I was all by myself.
That Ben...

320
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:20,117
He wasn't
around anymore and...

321
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,328
tried to stop him going to work
the next day, but...

322
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,960
So you can't keep
a good man from work, right?

323
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,344
You kind
of remind me of him.

324
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,683
Wayne?

325
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:48,187
- I've been looking for you.
- I've been right here.

326
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:52,691
I see.

327
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,154
- Hi.
- Hi.

328
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:00,073
Let's go talk to Daddy.
He's feeling real depressed tonight.

329
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:02,034
That big deal
he's working on went bad.

330
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,078
Oh, we got a major crisis
here, Annie. Excuse us?

331
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:08,332
- Okay.
- Bye.

332
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,461
See you later, alligator.

333
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:15,088
- In a while, crocodile.
- Good night, boys.

334
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,216
Go to sleep for Mama.

335
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,969
- What's that, hon?
- Blueberry muffins.

336
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:23,430
Whatcha doin' with muffins
in your pockets?

337
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,557
Miss Francis cooked them.

338
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,893
Yeah, but what are they
doing in your pockets?

339
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:31,980
They're in my pockets 'cause I put
'em there when she wasn't looking...

340
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:34,233
so I didn't
have to eat them.

341
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:38,320
Her blueberry muffins is terrible.

342
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:43,992
Y'all wait here a minute.
Take Ben, hon.

343
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:16,919
When God's fighting for you,
every soldier's important.

344
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,963
When God's fighting for you,
every soldier's important.

345
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,341
God does not give
one to the Devil.

346
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,801
If every child of God
obeyed God,

347
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:26,803
the Devil cannot
wipe you out.

348
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,097
He cannot take you out
before your time.

349
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,099
If you obey God,
I don't care what the Devil...

350
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:35,771
has placed upon your life,
Jesus can deliver you.

351
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:39,441
Jesus came to bring you
out of your prison house.

352
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:43,445
- Mama, is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

353
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:47,199
- You sure?
- Yeah. Time for you to go to bed.

354
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:53,247
I know him. He's
a squirrel-hunting buddy of mine.

355
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,917
- But I don't think that Donnie...
- I'm telling you it was him.

356
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,128
What makes you think he'd want
to bust into your house?

357
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:03,257
Well, his wife,
she's a client of mine,

358
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,468
and he thinks I'm trying
to break up their marriage.

359
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,929
Are you?

360
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,599
Listen,
Donnie's high-strung.

361
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:15,352
You know,
ain't no doubt about that.

362
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:18,021
But I don't think he's the one
that busted into your house.

363
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:21,441
Listen, I appreciate the coffee
and everything. Take care.

364
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:33,412
I just can't get through
a wall of some kind in my head...

365
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:36,665
or... or my soul.

366
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:39,168
Sometimes I don't
even know the difference...

367
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:42,379
between my head or my soul.

368
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,174
I think everybody
has that trouble, Buddy.

369
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:51,054
All right.

370
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:58,478
Your daddy...

371
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:02,357
He took things
away from you when you...

372
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:04,902
when you were a little boy.

373
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,865
Do you understand that?

374
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,039
He... He seen me playing around with
something, like a toy or something,

375
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:20,167
he'd just
take it away from me.

376
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,878
Did he take other things
away from you?

377
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,678
Buddy...

378
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:33,889
You got to find out, hon,

379
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:37,226
why you hate him so much.

380
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,562
My daddy's a good man.
I don't hate my dad.

381
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,024
He's good to Mama and me.

382
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:50,614
Every kid needs a hit with a belt
sometime. I mean...

383
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:55,202
Buddy, you got to try to get past
this wall that you're talking about.

384
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,455
Hon, you need to talk
about your daddy.

385
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,917
Why don't you tell me why I hate
him? You're the goddamn psychic!

386
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:05,420
Huh?
You're the goddamn psychic!

387
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,775
I think I better go.

388
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:29,153
I have to go home,

389
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:34,783
right now.

390
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:37,661
I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

391
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,788
It's all right.

392
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:43,792
I just need...
I just need your help.

393
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:50,132
I just keep thinking about that blue
diamond. I keep thinking about...

394
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:55,137
Buddy, if you think about these
things in your childhood, hon,

395
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:59,266
and you face up to them,
then I will be able to help you.

396
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,812
I know, hon.
I just...

397
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:07,274
I think you got to do
some thinking on your own.

398
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:11,695
Okay.

399
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,781
Oh. You...

400
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:16,783
I'll help you there.

401
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:20,245
- Okay, you put it up there.
- Hey, Ben.

402
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:23,123
- Hello?
- You got a lot of pretty things.

403
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,667
I liked looking at them.

404
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:28,128
You ever seen anybody
skin a squirrel?

405
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,964
You stick a knife
in its belly and zip.

406
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:33,300
That's what I'm going to do
to you and your children...

407
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,469
you ever call
the police again.

408
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,513
I did not.

409
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,903
Mama?

410
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:56,949
Hey.

411
00:35:57,032 --> 00:36:00,828
- How come you're not asleep?
- I don't know.

412
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,874
- What's that bat for?
- Oh.

413
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:09,878
Don't worry, honey.
I'm... I'm just working on my swing.

414
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:16,051
How come we never go
to the cemetery and see Daddy?

415
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:20,097
Well, we went out there
just last month on his birthday.

416
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,892
Honey, I'm real busy,
you know that.

417
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:26,728
Well, it seems like you have time
for a lot of strangers.

418
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:30,190
If we're talking about my
appointments, they're not strangers.

419
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:32,651
They're the ones
that put food on our table.

420
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:35,195
But how come we don't
even talk about Daddy?

421
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,614
Go on, Mike.
I'm trying to read.

422
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:47,684
- Annie?
- We're going to have to frame that.

423
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,728
- It's just a painting.
- That's beautiful.

424
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,648
- Annie.
- Hey.

425
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:56,235
Hey, listen. I know why Kenneth King
wasn't in church today.

426
00:37:56,318 --> 00:38:00,280
- Put your belt on. Why?
- 'Cause his daughter disappeared.

427
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:02,241
Jessica?

428
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:04,243
What do you mean
she disappeared?

429
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,912
Well, Kenneth woke up this morning
and Jessica wasn't there,

430
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,664
and her bed
hadn't even been slept in.

431
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:11,083
Annie, you think
she ran off?

432
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,585
I know her and Wayne were
supposed to be married in June.

433
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:16,588
- Maybe she got cold feet.
- Maybe.

434
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:19,466
Maybe this will clear
the way for you and Wayne.

435
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:23,178
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on.

436
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:26,807
I saw the way y'all were looking
at each other Friday night.

437
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,351
Y'all both just
had stars in your eyes.

438
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,854
Oh, Linda, that's nuts.

439
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:35,691
- Yeah. Annie, love is nuts.
- Come on. Go home.

440
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:39,194
Listen,
I want you to get some rest.

441
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,822
You look terrible, okay?
Bye, boys.

442
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,366
- I got to go.
- Bye, Miss Linda.

443
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:01,383
Ben, get your hand
out of there!

444
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:03,385
That's for y'all's
cake tonight.

445
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:06,847
- What am I gonna ice the cake with?
- I like icin', Mama.

446
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:09,308
Yeah,
I can see that, punkin.

447
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:11,351
Miller!

448
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:14,730
Miller, hon, would you
go ask Miss Francis...

449
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:17,399
if she's got another
can of icing, please?

450
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:20,110
- Mama!
- I'm coming, Ben.

451
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,343
Where you going, son?

452
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:51,225
You wanna ride
in the truck?

453
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:58,440
I got a question for you.
You know my wife Valerie?

454
00:39:58,524 --> 00:40:01,068
She been around
to see your mama lately?

455
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:05,572
Hey, boy,
I asked you a question.

456
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,409
Get my hat.

457
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:19,044
You know, I feel sorry
for you and your brothers.

458
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:22,089
I mean, your mama
being a witch and all.

459
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,466
If she don't stop
her evil ways,

460
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,010
some day somebody's
gonna burn her up.

461
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:30,055
And then you boys
are gonna be without a daddy...

462
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:32,599
or a mama.

463
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:36,562
Hey, Miller?
You all right?

464
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:39,940
He said mama's a witch
and they're gonna burn her up.

465
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,984
Oh, he did?

466
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:50,367
- You better mind your own business.
- I intend to, Donnie.

467
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,586
Motherfucker!

468
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:03,130
Goddamn it! Fuck!

469
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:05,174
Look, fucker!

470
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:08,844
Shoot me!
Shoot me!

471
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:11,471
Shoot me,
you motherfucker!

472
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:14,516
Shoot me! Shoot me!

473
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,827
You all right?

474
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,675
Tuscan Rouge.

475
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,886
What was I thinking?

476
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,849
I want icin', Mama.

477
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:58,018
Hon, you've had icing enough
to put you in a coma.

478
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,062
And from now on,

479
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,064
I want to know where you all are
every minute of the day.

480
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:04,274
All right?

481
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:08,278
Mike, I'm gonna start
driving you and Miller to school.

482
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:12,699
I wish Daddy was here.

483
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:17,496
Well, he's not, hon.
But Mama is. Okay?

484
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:25,712
Eat your cake.

485
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:31,426
- Hello.
- This is Kenneth King.

486
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,055
- Mr. King.
- I imagine you,

487
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:38,100
heard about
my daughter's disappearance?

488
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:39,852
- Yes.
- Well...

489
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:41,895
Mrs. Wilson,
I don't believe in what you do.

490
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:43,939
I'll just be
straight with you.

491
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:48,569
Not only that, I don't like it. But
we've got to the end of the road...

492
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,239
and our investigation looked under
every rock there is to look under,

493
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:55,742
and we'd like you to tell us
what you can to help us.

494
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:59,246
Now, no hocus-pocus
and chanting and carrying on.

495
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:03,208
We know you talk to a lot of folks,
know a lot of folks' business.

496
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:07,254
You might have heard
something or something.

497
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:09,131
The only thing we know is,

498
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:13,093
one of Sheriff Johnson's men
found my daughter's car...

499
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,263
sitting out on the parking lot
of that honky-tonk called AyJay's.

500
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:19,308
But nobody that was there
on Saturday night...

501
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,643
admits to having seen her.

502
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,981
So I'm afraid she might have been
kidnapped or something?

503
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:30,819
Oh, Mr. King,
I'm... I'm sorry.

504
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:33,822
I don't know anything about
your daughter's disappearance.

505
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:36,366
I think
we were just hoping...

506
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:39,995
Is there anything
you can tell us?

507
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:42,456
I could read for you.

508
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:47,336
But that... that's
about all I could do.

509
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:50,047
I need you
to cut the cards for me.

510
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:02,226
Oh, boy.

511
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:10,067
Thank you.

512
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,535
All right.
You ready?

513
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:23,247
Okay.

514
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:33,674
When were you
getting married again, Wayne?

515
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:36,343
- June 20...
- We're supposed to ask questions,

516
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,345
- not you.
- Shut up, Pearl! Goddamn it!

517
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:40,347
Look, I have a hard time
concentrating...

518
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:43,016
with more than one person
in the room.

519
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:47,062
Well, I'm staying right here. I'm
the law, and I need to hear this.

520
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:50,232
Please, ma'am, just...

521
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:51,650
just try to tell us
what you see.

522
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,901
just try to tell us
what you see.

523
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:55,737
I'm trying.

524
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,948
All right.

525
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:18,343
All right,
all I'm picking up...

526
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:22,556
it's like a...
it's a fence.

527
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:25,893
Like a split rail fence.

528
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:28,770
Do you know how many fences
there are in this county?

529
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:33,233
And some pillars, like,
with an opening going through.

530
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,117
And there's lots of white flowers.
I can... I...

531
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:46,830
Yes. And,
is that where Jessie is?

532
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:02,930
Well, that's... that's, all I'm...
all I'm seeing.

533
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:06,391
This is just mishmash. I told you
this wouldn't lead to nothing.

534
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:09,436
You're right. It won't.
I can't concentrate.

535
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:15,234
- I can't do this now. I'm sorry.
- Please, ma'am.

536
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:17,319
I really do hope
you find your daughter.

537
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:21,490
But I'm... I'm just not the person
to help you with this.

538
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:05,779
Hey, Butch.

539
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:41,023
And it was horrible.

540
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:44,026
But that same chain that was wrapped
around her when she was floatin',

541
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:49,198
you know, up in my tree, it was the
same chain that I had in my dream.

542
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:52,284
- I don't know. I just thought...
- Dave?

543
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:57,164
Yes, sir?

544
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:59,208
I could have sworn there
was an eclair in there.

545
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:02,419
I didn't get it.

546
00:50:04,505 --> 00:50:07,216
Tim was in
a little earlier.

547
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,346
So you saw all this
in a dream?

548
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:14,348
It wasn't just a dream.

549
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,475
I don't investigate
somebody's dream.

550
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,062
I think she's dead, Sheriff.

551
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:23,190
And I think she's in a pond.

552
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:26,735
What do you know about this
you ain't telling me?

553
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:30,030
You can get in serious
trouble with holding information.

554
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:32,157
Does it sound like
a place you know?

555
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:34,201
Yeah,
a bunch of places I know.

556
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:37,496
Split rail fence, a pond,
a stretch of woods.

557
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:40,207
- Every raw bone ol' boy got that.
- What about the fiddler?

558
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:43,293
Well,

559
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:45,754
ol' Tommy Lee Ballard
plays a fiddle.

560
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:48,465
But he wouldn't kill nobody.
I've known him since he's a kid.

561
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:52,052
No, no, it's not the fiddler.
Who are his neighbors?

562
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:56,014
Well, his closest neighbor
would be...

563
00:50:57,266 --> 00:51:00,102
Well, let me see here.
I guess...

564
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:04,398
Well, his property borders,
Donnie Barksdale's place.

565
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:08,110
Do you know
Donnie Barksdale?

566
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:12,239
Ma'am?

567
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:21,373
Tim! On the gate!

568
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,668
You did get
a search warrant, didn't you?

569
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,670
I want everything
to be legal and proper.

570
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:29,131
Didn't have to.
Got permission from the owner.

571
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:32,467
Donnie Barksdale
gave you permission...

572
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:36,096
His wife did.
I told her it was routine.

573
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:38,473
We're checking all the ponds
in the county.

574
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,684
Donnie's gone fishing today.

575
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,745
Excuse me. Sheriff Johnson?

576
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:03,665
- How much longer y'all gonna be?
- Long as it takes.

577
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:07,127
All right. You just said you're
gonna be a few minutes.

578
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:09,546
And we're
going on two hours.

579
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,633
Hey, Pearl!
I think I got something!

580
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:45,082
False alarm.
It's just an old bicycle.

581
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:51,255
None of y'all brought a Thermos
of coffee out here?

582
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:16,864
That day at school.

583
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:21,118
You looked kind of strange
at me and Jessica.

584
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:23,662
Did you think
something bad then?

585
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:36,758
Shit.
Come on.

586
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:41,054
- Donnie, he called. I told him...
- Pearl!

587
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:43,182
Shut your mouth!

588
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:45,350
Goddamn it, Pearl,
what are you doing on my property?

589
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:48,854
I'm on Sheriff's business, Donnie.
I got permission from your wife.

590
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:50,856
You think I let that
little ninny talk for me?

591
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:55,444
How'd your arm
get all scratched up?

592
00:53:57,696 --> 00:54:01,241
Stray cat. She didn't like it
when I killed her.

593
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:04,661
- Now what brought you here?
- Just routine investigation.

594
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:06,955
We're checking
all the ponds in the county.

595
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:18,008
- I knew it was you.
- No! You!

596
00:54:21,803 --> 00:54:25,349
Hey! I'm on County business,
Donnie. Don't fool with me.

597
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:28,185
- Hey, Pearl!
- What?

598
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:31,188
- You need to take a look at this.
- Watch him.

599
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:34,274
Hault up, boys!

600
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:45,410
- It's her!
- Donnie?

601
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:51,667
Get those hooks
out of my baby!

602
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:54,878
- Get her off them hooks!
- Cuff him!

603
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:58,257
- No! No!
- Mr. King!

604
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:03,804
- No!
- Get an ambulance!

605
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:05,806
I think he's
having a heart attack!

606
00:55:05,848 --> 00:55:08,433
- I didn't do this!
- Get him out of here!

607
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:10,686
This ain't right!
Pearl!

608
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:15,023
Bitch! Bitch!
Bitch! Pearl!

609
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:31,415
Come in.

610
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:36,253
Somebody might
come in here.

611
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:39,047
I guess you better
fuck me fast.

612
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:42,009
You want some coffee?
Mrs. Wilson?

613
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,014
You want some coffee?

614
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:49,349
No, thank you.

615
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:51,351
Have a seat.

616
00:55:56,857 --> 00:55:59,151
Why... Why have you
called me here?

617
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:02,446
Tomorrow Donnie Barksdale goes
on trial for murder...

618
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:05,616
and I feel
that we have a powerful case.

619
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,618
In fact,
today the coroner verified...

620
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:10,037
Donnie's tissue
under the victim's fingernails.

621
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:13,749
Now, I only have one weak link
I got to worry about.

622
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:17,044
- What?
- You.

623
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:21,423
You see, you're how we found out
where the victim's body was.

624
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:24,760
And how you found out,
well,

625
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:28,055
that might open up
a real can of worms for us.

626
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:32,643
Psychic phenomena,
E.S.P., dreams, visions.

627
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:34,978
The defense
could go to town on you.

628
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:38,273
And if that's not bad enough,
I understand there was bad blood...

629
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:41,276
between you
and Donnie Barksdale.

630
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:43,570
Yeah.
He threatened my kids.

631
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:47,574
That's what I heard. I also heard
that you threatened him right back.

632
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:49,785
Told his wife
to leave him.

633
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:54,665
Donnie's quite
a ladies' man.

634
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,959
Were you involved
with him?

635
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:01,296
- What?
- I can deal with any revelation...

636
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,298
right now.

637
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:06,301
But at the trial
there can't be any surprises.

638
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,639
So, is there anything I need
to know about you or Donnie...

639
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:13,976
or Donnie's wife
or the victim?

640
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:16,478
No.

641
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:18,856
Will that be all?

642
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,984
Yes, ma'am.

643
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:28,198
You know, Mr. Duncan,

644
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:31,743
the victim had a name.

645
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:34,496
It was Jessica King.

646
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,918
Mr. Hawkins, how long have you
worked out at AyJay's?

647
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:42,087
Mr. Hawkins, how long have you
worked out at AyJay's?

648
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,089
About ten years.

649
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:47,718
Now, were you working at AyJay's
on Saturday night, April 8?

650
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:50,345
- Yes, sir.
- And did you see the defendant,

651
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:54,183
- Donnie Barksdale, there that night?
- Yes, sir.

652
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:57,019
Could you describe the circumstances
when you saw him?

653
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:01,857
The circumstances were I come
outside to throw out some trash.

654
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:03,859
And do you recall
what time it was?

655
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:06,195
About midnight,
I reckon.

656
00:58:06,278 --> 00:58:09,823
Anyhow, I seen Donnie Barksdale
out there by his truck...

657
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:13,827
havin' an argument
with this white lady.

658
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:18,665
She scratched his arm
and he slapped the tar out of her.

659
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:21,543
About that time,
I go back inside.

660
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:23,962
Is this the woman
you saw with Donnie Barksdale?

661
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:27,257
- Yes, sir.
- Your Honor, let the record show...

662
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:31,345
that I've just shown Mr. Hawkins
a photograph of Jessica King.

663
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:39,019
You just said that your attention
was drawn to the defendant's pond.

664
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:43,357
Drawn in...
Well, drawn in what way?

665
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:47,569
Me, Wayne Collins
and Kenneth King...

666
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:49,571
went to see a woman,
name of Annie Wilson.

667
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:52,074
What made you think this woman
would be able to help you?

668
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:57,913
Well, word around town
was that she was a...

669
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:04,878
- Well, I don't know the right word.
- Isn't it fortune-teller?

670
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:08,924
- I guess so.
- What did this fortune-teller see...

671
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:11,969
when she looked into
her little crystal ball?

672
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:16,849
Well, she didn't have no ball.
She had these, special cards.

673
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:20,185
What did she see when she looked
into her little special cards?

674
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:22,521
She didn't actually
see nothing then.

675
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:26,108
But next day,
she come to see me and...

676
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:28,068
told me
she had this dream.

677
00:59:28,152 --> 00:59:31,155
- She had a dream?
- Yes, sir.

678
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:35,450
She'd seen this pond and it looked
a lot like Donnie Barksdale's and...

679
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:39,621
then she woke up
from her dream...

680
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:42,749
and she went outside
and looked up in this tree.

681
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:47,796
I'm all ears.

682
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,887
She seen Jessica King...

683
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,598
floatin' in the tree,

684
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:00,476
half-naked, with a chain
wrapped around her.

685
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:02,936
Floatin' around a tree?

686
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:06,356
Yes, sir.

687
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:09,818
Floatin' in a tree,

688
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:11,987
half-naked,

689
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:16,200
with a chain
wrapped around her.

690
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:18,577
Thank you, Sheriff.

691
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:22,581
That little squirrel,
Weems, is just mean and skinny.

692
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:25,167
Never have known
a Weems worth a damn.

693
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,127
Well, he was
just doing his job.

694
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:31,048
Mrs. Wilson?
Can I talk to you for a minute?

695
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:34,426
Just call me later on, okay?

696
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,428
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, bye.

697
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:41,141
Buddy, I got a lot on my mind.
It's not a good time, okay?

698
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:45,395
Mrs. Wilson?

699
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:49,525
You did tell me to do some thinkin'
and talkin'. And I've been thinkin'.

700
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:51,401
What? What?

701
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:55,322
Can you tell me why
I do things to myself...

702
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:57,324
when I think
about my daddy?

703
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,493
All right, well...

704
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:03,789
Bud, you call me later, hon,
and we'll talk, all right?

705
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:06,667
- I need to talk to you.
- Buddy.

706
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,670
I've been thinking about my daddy
and I've been touching myself.

707
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:12,673
- Touching yourself? How?
- Why do I do that?

708
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:14,299
It's not a good time.

709
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:17,636
- Something's bad wrong with me.
- Look, Buddy...

710
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:20,681
And I... I keep thinking
about that blue diamond.

711
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:24,560
You look into the blue diamond,
you won't think a negative thought.

712
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:28,438
I promise. Now, hon, I'm going
through a hard time myself. I'm...

713
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,775
I just... I can't talk
to you now, okay?

714
01:01:35,112 --> 01:01:37,739
You're gonna burn
in hell, Annie Wilson!

715
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:51,587
Now, Mike, I know you skipped
school and went to that trial.

716
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,756
- How'd you know?
- A little bird told me.

717
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,051
It's time you started making things
easier on me instead of harder.

718
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:00,053
I'm very disappointed in you.

719
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:03,599
- The phone's ringing, Mama.
- Second of all,

720
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:06,477
I'm gonna have to testify
at that trial tomorrow.

721
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:09,354
- The phone's ringing, Mama.
- I'm not deaf, Miller.

722
01:02:09,438 --> 01:02:11,607
Let the machine get it.

723
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:15,611
Donnie Barksdale's side, they're
gonna try and give me a hard time.

724
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:18,280
They're gonna call me names
and I...

725
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:20,282
I just want y'all
to be prepared...

726
01:02:20,324 --> 01:02:23,619
if you hear any bad stuff
about me, all right?

727
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:27,164
Now, we're all gonna have to
be sticking together on this one.

728
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:30,000
Annie Wilson, it's Buddy's mother.

729
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:32,628
Buddy's done gone crazy.
He's threatening to kill his daddy!

730
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:36,548
He's got Odell tied up
in the backyard,

731
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:38,634
accusing him
of horrible things.

732
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:42,179
- Have you called the police?
- He said if I did he'd kill Odell.

733
01:02:42,221 --> 01:02:44,515
He wants you.

734
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:49,269
Hey, Buddy.

735
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:55,984
Buddy, put that strap down and
tell me what he's done to you.

736
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:59,279
I'm here, Buddy. Like you said,
you can talk to me, honey.

737
01:02:59,363 --> 01:03:04,701
It's too late for that!
It's too goddamn late!

738
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:08,539
This here is a criminal.

739
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:13,126
And he's gonna be punished.

740
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,671
Bud-Buddy.
Buddy, it's Annie.

741
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:18,841
- You shut up! You shut up!
- It's all right.

742
01:03:18,924 --> 01:03:22,970
- Get away! Where were you?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

743
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:27,474
You knew everything
and you did nothing.

744
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:30,310
You ruined me.
You ruined me!

745
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:34,064
I was just a little boy, Daddy.

746
01:03:34,106 --> 01:03:37,609
It got so I was embarrassed
to go to school, Daddy.

747
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:40,445
How could you do that
to your little boy?

748
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,502
No, Buddy. You put that down.
No, Buddy.

749
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:58,547
You put that down, Buddy.
You put that down. You listen to me.

750
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:01,842
You get away!
You get away! Get away!

751
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:06,305
All right, Buddy. All right.
It's all right. Come on.

752
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:10,100
Why... Why didn't
you help me, Annie?

753
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:11,935
What?

754
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:14,730
Why didn't you
help me?

755
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:18,358
- I had you for a friend and then...
- I am your friend, Buddy.

756
01:04:18,442 --> 01:04:21,111
Now I have nobody.

757
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:23,113
I have nobody!

758
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,627
But I'm gonna...
I'm gonna kill this thing.

759
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:40,088
- No!
- No, Buddy!

760
01:04:45,177 --> 01:04:46,595
No!

761
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:49,431
Help me!

762
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:52,684
- Help me!
- Look at that goddamn thing.

763
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:54,978
And you tell me what kind
of thoughts you have?

764
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,065
You look!

765
01:04:58,148 --> 01:05:00,067
You look
into that thing!

766
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:24,675
Mrs. Wilson? Mrs. Wilson.

767
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:29,221
Mrs. Wilson, your husband,
Ben Wilson Senior,

768
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:31,765
was one of the men killed last year
in the explosion...

769
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:33,767
out at the Reinhold
Cable Plant.

770
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,936
Yes, that's right.

771
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:39,439
And you were left with three small
children to raise on your own.

772
01:05:39,523 --> 01:05:41,984
Yes, sir.

773
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:44,486
How do you provide
for you and your sons?

774
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:51,827
I get a little bit
of money from Social Security...

775
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:53,829
as a result
of my husband's death.

776
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:58,959
And,

777
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:01,295
I also give readings.

778
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:03,380
- Psychic readings.
- Yes, sir.

779
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:06,425
What does being psychic
enable you to do?

780
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:10,637
I see things...

781
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:14,141
and I, you know...
I sense... things...

782
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:16,310
that... well, they
hadn't happened yet...

783
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:19,563
or they were happening
someplace else.

784
01:06:19,646 --> 01:06:24,818
My granny told me that I...
I had a gift that runs in my family.

785
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:27,154
And she told me that
I shouldn't be afraid of it.

786
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:32,326
I should just always use my instinct
and I'd... I'd be all right.

787
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:34,411
So, you're swearing
before this court...

788
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:36,663
that you didn't get your information
about this tragedy...

789
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:39,583
from any other means
than your special ability?

790
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:42,628
- Your gift.
- Yes, sir.

791
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:45,464
I'm swearing that. Yes.

792
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:48,509
- Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.
- Yes, sir.

793
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:51,303
- I have no further questions.
- Mr. Weems.

794
01:06:56,225 --> 01:06:57,684
Mrs. Wilson.

795
01:07:01,605 --> 01:07:04,149
How many fingers am I holding up
behind my back?

796
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:06,193
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Your Honor,

797
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:08,987
my client is sitting in this
courtroom on trial for his life...

798
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:12,533
partly because of powers
that this woman claims to have.

799
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:15,536
Now, in all fairness, I believe
I should be given the opportunity...

800
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:17,538
to test
the alleged powers...

801
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:20,165
instead of having to stand here
and take her word for it.

802
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:23,669
You have a good point.
Objection overruled.

803
01:07:23,752 --> 01:07:29,132
Can everyone in the jury box
see how many fingers I'm showing?

804
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:35,806
How many fingers,
Mrs. Wilson?

805
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:43,397
I don't know.

806
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,691
You don't know?

807
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:51,697
Seven.
Seven fingers.

808
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,408
That... That doesn't
prove anything.

809
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:57,619
Your Honor, I can't do this,
you know, at the drop of a hat.

810
01:07:57,703 --> 01:08:02,082
Well, then, ma'am, how about doing
it at the drop of a dollar bill?

811
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:04,418
What are you trying to say?

812
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,879
I'm trying to say maybe this special
gift of yours doesn't work...

813
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:09,673
unless you're
being paid for it.

814
01:08:09,756 --> 01:08:12,176
Like they say in the army,
''No money, no honey.''

815
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:14,219
No, that's not true.

816
01:08:14,303 --> 01:08:16,221
Are you aware that in Hatcher County
it's against the law...

817
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:18,432
for a psychic to set up shop
and charge people money?

818
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:20,517
Well, I don't charge money.

819
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,561
You just testified
that you do charge money.

820
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:26,023
No. I accept donations.
People give me gifts.

821
01:08:26,106 --> 01:08:30,777
Oh. A distinction
worthy of a lawyer.

822
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:33,322
Mrs. Wilson,
you a rich woman?

823
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:35,407
- No.
- Why not?

824
01:08:35,491 --> 01:08:40,412
If I had psychic powers and could
read the future, I'd be filthy rich.

825
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:42,414
I'd be playing
the Stock Market.

826
01:08:42,456 --> 01:08:45,459
I'd be over in Mobile
betting on the dogs.

827
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:47,794
I'd certainly warn my husband
not to go to work...

828
01:08:47,836 --> 01:08:50,297
on the day I know the Reinhold
Plant's gonna blow up...

829
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:54,593
leaving three little ol' children
to be raised in a carnival sideshow.

830
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:57,971
Well, it doesn't work
that way, sir.

831
01:08:58,013 --> 01:08:59,973
I can't use my gift
for personal gain.

832
01:09:00,057 --> 01:09:05,312
Except for those,
what you call 'em, donations?

833
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:13,570
You've had some personal trouble
with Donnie Barksdale, haven't you?

834
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:20,744
Yes, I have.

835
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:23,664
Just a few weeks ago, you told him...
I believe the exact words was...

836
01:09:23,705 --> 01:09:25,999
you was gonna have
his ass thrown in jail.

837
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:28,836
- But he was threatening my kids.
- Ain't it also true...

838
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:31,839
that a few weeks ago in one of
those famous readings of yours,

839
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,841
when you were doing
your so-called E.S.P.,

840
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:36,176
you told Valerie Barksdale,
Donnie's wife,

841
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,637
that Donnie was just
an insecure redneck...

842
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,640
and that he wasn't really
crazy enough to kill anybody?

843
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:50,357
Yes, I did say that.

844
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,651
Then why today are you
saying he did kill somebody?

845
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:54,653
Wait a second.
I've never said that.

846
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:57,239
You might as well have, ma'am.
You wanted his ass in jail.

847
01:09:57,322 --> 01:10:00,701
- He's on trial for his life.
- I just told the sheriff what I saw.

848
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:04,329
And how could any of us
ever forget that?

849
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:08,208
Jessica King just
floatin' up in that tree,

850
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,794
naked,

851
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:13,338
with a chain...

852
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:15,382
wrapped around her.

853
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:20,804
It must be
so much fun for you.

854
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:23,056
You must be having
the time of your life...

855
01:10:23,098 --> 01:10:26,185
entertaining yourself
with your dreams and your visions.

856
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:29,855
You think it's fun seeing decomposed
bodies in my tree, do you, sir?

857
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:31,857
You think that's fun?

858
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:35,319
Do you think it's fun I have people
trying to strangle me in my sleep?

859
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:37,571
Now I'm sitting here
and I'm blaming myself...

860
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:40,073
'cause some poor crazy man tried
to burn his daddy half to death.

861
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:42,075
And you think I'm sitting here
having fun?

862
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:44,912
I'm sorry, sir.
You're crazy if you think that.

863
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:47,748
No more questions,
Your Honor.

864
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:51,251
You're dismissed.

865
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:06,892
Like they say in Hollywood,
let's just cut to the chase.

866
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:10,187
Did you or did you not
kill Jessica King?

867
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,189
I did not.

868
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:15,901
Did you or did you not see Jessica
King on the night she was killed?

869
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:19,238
Yeah, I seen her.

870
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:21,782
Would you describe
the circumstances, please?

871
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:24,618
Well, I'd been seeing her
for quite a while.

872
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:28,121
Would you clarify what
you mean by "seeing"?

873
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:31,625
I mean, her and me
had been having sex.

874
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:35,379
Okay, go ahead.

875
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:37,714
Well, she called me
about 11:00.

876
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:41,635
So I told her
I'd meet her out at Ay Jay's.

877
01:11:41,718 --> 01:11:44,263
And I told my wife
I was going out for a beer.

878
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:47,724
- What happened after that?
- Well, we got in an argument.

879
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:49,726
She told me she didn't
want to see me no more.

880
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:52,479
- Did she tell you why?
- She said she was getting married...

881
01:11:52,563 --> 01:11:55,149
in a couple of months and she
wanted to stop playing around.

882
01:11:55,232 --> 01:11:58,402
At least
till after the wedding.

883
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,404
And during the course
of this argument with Miss King,

884
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:02,489
did you at any moment
strike her?

885
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:07,619
Yes, sir.

886
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,834
What happened
after you struck her?

887
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,587
Well, she banged her head
pretty hard when she went down,

888
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:19,882
so I... I decided
to take her to the hospital.

889
01:12:19,965 --> 01:12:23,010
- Did you reach the hospital?
- No, sir.

890
01:12:23,093 --> 01:12:25,012
Are you feeling okay?

891
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:28,891
I'm fine.

892
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:32,311
I wanna go back.

893
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:34,938
I don't wanna go
to the hospital. Someone...

894
01:12:35,022 --> 01:12:36,940
Someone might see me.

895
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:41,111
She said she was feeling better,
so I took her back to Ay Jay's.

896
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:45,532
I dropped her off,
then I went on back home.

897
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:50,037
And that was the very last time
that you saw Jessica King alive?

898
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,123
- Yes, sir. The very last.
- Donnie,

899
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:56,502
are you guilty
of the charge against you?

900
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,464
I'm guilty
of cheating on my wife,

901
01:13:00,589 --> 01:13:03,008
of being a bad husband,

902
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:05,594
a bad Christian.

903
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:08,138
But I ain't guilty
of killing Jesse.

904
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:10,641
I swear to God.

905
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:14,019
No more questions,
Your Honor.

906
01:13:14,102 --> 01:13:15,437
Mr. Duncan.

907
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:20,067
Mr. Barksdale,
you're a wife-beater, aren't you?

908
01:13:23,862 --> 01:13:26,824
I've swore to tell
the truth here today.

909
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:31,161
Yeah, I've hit
Valerie before.

910
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:33,664
I guess
it ain't no secret.

911
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:36,875
So, you admit to having a history
of violence against women?

912
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,794
You also admit to having
beaten up the victim...

913
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:40,462
on the night
that she was murdered.

914
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:42,506
I wouldn't exactly say
that I beat her up.

915
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:44,925
You're the expert. You tell me.
Just how badly do you...

916
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:49,263
have to beat a woman before it fits
your definition of ''beating up''?

917
01:13:49,346 --> 01:13:53,058
Now, your story is that you've
been having an affair...

918
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:55,978
with the victim.

919
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:59,439
But tell us why a beautiful
young woman like Jessica King...

920
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:01,441
from one of the finest
families in Brixton,

921
01:14:01,525 --> 01:14:04,653
just about to be married to a good,
decent professional man...

922
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:07,447
and with a bright,
shining future in front of her...

923
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:10,701
Why would a woman like that get
involved with something like you?

924
01:14:10,784 --> 01:14:14,997
I asked her that
myself one time.

925
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,292
She said I was the only man
in town who knew how to fuck.

926
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:23,338
You're really disgusting.
You know that?

927
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:26,675
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Objection sustained.

928
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:29,845
Mr. Duncan, you will refrain from
making those personal comments.

929
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:32,890
I apologize, Your Honor.
It won't happen again.

930
01:14:34,725 --> 01:14:38,228
So, let's get this straight.
Let's clarify this.

931
01:14:38,312 --> 01:14:40,731
You're saying it was
just a coincidence...

932
01:14:40,814 --> 01:14:44,401
that on the very same night that you
physically assaulted Jessica King,

933
01:14:44,485 --> 01:14:46,612
someone else put
her body in your pond?

934
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:48,989
I'm not saying
it was a coincidence.

935
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:51,658
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying I got framed!

936
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:53,911
Oh, well, what an original defense.

937
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:56,371
Did you think of Jessica King
as a stray cat?

938
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:57,998
No.

939
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:00,334
Did you tell Sheriff Johnson that
a stray cat had clawed your arm?

940
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,336
- Yeah.
- Didn't you just tell the court...

941
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:04,338
- Jessica had scratched your arm?
- Yeah, but...

942
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:07,382
Didn't you tell Sheriff Johnson you
got scratched by the stray cat...

943
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:09,426
because she didn't like it
when you killed her?

944
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:11,845
Yeah, but I was lying.
My wife was standing right there!

945
01:15:11,929 --> 01:15:14,765
- How do I know you're not lying now?
- Because I'm not, goddamn it!

946
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:17,309
- It's her, goddamn it!
- Be seated, Mr. Barksdale!

947
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:19,520
She's the reason I'm up here!
She's a goddamn witch!

948
01:15:19,603 --> 01:15:23,232
She's putting spells on
every-goddamn-body in town!

949
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:26,151
Witch! Witch!
Yeah, you run!

950
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:28,278
I'll have order in the courtroom.

951
01:15:28,362 --> 01:15:32,699
In Brixton today, a sensational
murder trial was concluded.

952
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:35,410
Donald J. Barksdale
was found guilty...

953
01:15:35,494 --> 01:15:38,622
in the sex and strangulation
killing of Jessica King,

954
01:15:38,705 --> 01:15:43,210
daughter of the prominent Brixton
businessman, Kenneth King.

955
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:46,380
Is everything gonna be
all right now, Mama?

956
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:48,882
Yeah, hon.

957
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:51,677
We can get on
with our lives now.

958
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:47,399
I guess I'm the last
person you wanna see.

959
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:53,864
How you been?

960
01:16:57,826 --> 01:16:59,745
Terrible.

961
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:05,083
Annie, if you tell me to get going,
I will. I wouldn't blame you.

962
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,669
But I need you
to read for me.

963
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:17,721
Give me a hand.

964
01:17:20,724 --> 01:17:24,478
I feel like I can't
hold on any longer.

965
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:29,358
I know Donnie's mean and everything,
but I feel real lost without him.

966
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:32,402
You know, I ain't never
been on my own before.

967
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:35,614
And I'm scared, Annie.

968
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:39,451
You don't need to be scared, hon.
You'll be fine.

969
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:43,622
You see that
in the cards?

970
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:46,500
Right through here.

971
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:49,795
But can you see
what... what I'm thinking?

972
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:53,090
Can you see that
in the cards?

973
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:55,133
What do you mean?

974
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:57,553
Well,

975
01:17:57,636 --> 01:18:02,641
I've been thinking
some real bad, bad thoughts.

976
01:18:02,724 --> 01:18:05,686
Unchristian thoughts.

977
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:08,147
Like what?

978
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:09,606
Like...

979
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:14,486
I'm glad that girl's dead.
Jessica.

980
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:17,614
She was messin' around with my
husband and deserved what she got.

981
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:19,616
No one deserves that.

982
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:23,162
Like I said,
I know it's unchristian.

983
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:33,672
What? What, are you
seeing something bad?

984
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:38,010
I don't know.

985
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:46,185
It's not clear.

986
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:25,200
Fuck you!

987
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,202
Wayne?

988
01:21:19,171 --> 01:21:21,089
Wayne?

989
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:44,279
It's not normally
like this.

990
01:21:49,785 --> 01:21:53,330
You need
to lie down.

991
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:55,457
I'm really not sleepy.

992
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:59,044
I think if you sleep,
you'll feel better.

993
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:14,184
Thank you, Annie.

994
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:18,522
Oh. It's okay.

995
01:22:40,419 --> 01:22:42,337
Wayne.

996
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:47,426
I don't think
this is a good idea.

997
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:51,054
No.

998
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,058
It's not.

999
01:22:57,394 --> 01:23:00,355
I just thought we could
forget all this for a while.

1000
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:05,027
You want to,
don't you?

1001
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:24,171
I know there's
something between us.

1002
01:23:30,302 --> 01:23:32,221
I can't.

1003
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:36,433
I guess
I still feel married.

1004
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:41,188
You're not, though.

1005
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:46,902
- He's gone.
- I know.

1006
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:50,531
You gotta learn
to deal with that.

1007
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:57,663
The same way I gotta learn to deal
with the fact that Jessica's gone.

1008
01:24:03,085 --> 01:24:05,045
She's dead.

1009
01:24:06,922 --> 01:24:09,424
Oh, Wayne,
I'm so sorry.

1010
01:24:11,593 --> 01:24:14,221
It's okay.

1011
01:24:14,263 --> 01:24:16,765
No, it's not okay.

1012
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:23,814
I... I don't think
Donnie Barksdale killed her.

1013
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:27,901
- No, no, Annie.
- I'm really sorry.

1014
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:30,362
I can't... I can't do this.
It's finished.

1015
01:24:30,445 --> 01:24:33,824
I know. I wanna let
that bastard rot in jail.

1016
01:24:33,907 --> 01:24:36,577
- But he's guilty.
- No, Wayne.

1017
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,620
I see it.

1018
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:44,084
I see he didn't do it.

1019
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:52,092
- Do you see who did?
- I'm trying, but I... I...

1020
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:54,136
I don't know yet.

1021
01:24:54,178 --> 01:24:56,889
What are we gonna do?

1022
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:01,226
Well, if I had
a piece of clothing...

1023
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:05,939
or maybe I could go
out to the pond or see if I...

1024
01:25:07,524 --> 01:25:12,196
It's not over.
Jesus.

1025
01:26:54,965 --> 01:26:56,800
Come on in.

1026
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:04,475
Well,
what brings you out here?

1027
01:27:06,018 --> 01:27:08,896
Well, I'll just come
straight out and say it.

1028
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:11,356
I don't think Donnie Barksdale
killed Jessica King.

1029
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,400
Well, sure he did.
It was an open-and-shut case.

1030
01:27:13,484 --> 01:27:15,027
I'm telling you he didn't.

1031
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:17,738
The person that killed Jessica
is still out there someplace.

1032
01:27:17,821 --> 01:27:20,032
What's the deal? The Barksdales
been threatening you?

1033
01:27:20,115 --> 01:27:22,284
- No.
- I'll talk to Pearl Johnson.

1034
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:25,871
This has nothing to do
with the Barksdales. Listen.

1035
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:27,915
I know that Donnie
didn't kill Jessica...

1036
01:27:27,998 --> 01:27:30,542
the same way that I knew
that her body was in his pond.

1037
01:27:30,626 --> 01:27:34,630
And do you know
who did kill her?

1038
01:27:37,508 --> 01:27:39,426
No.

1039
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:41,720
So, what do you care?
The son of a bitch is in jail.

1040
01:27:41,804 --> 01:27:44,515
I got a warning today.

1041
01:27:44,598 --> 01:27:47,392
I think somebody is
gonna try and kill me.

1042
01:27:47,476 --> 01:27:49,394
What do you
want me to do?

1043
01:27:49,478 --> 01:27:51,396
Reopen the case and find out
who really did it.

1044
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,316
- I can't. He's been convicted.
- Well, you can talk to somebody.

1045
01:27:54,358 --> 01:27:56,318
I've got no basis to open this case.
I'd look like a fool.

1046
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,363
I don't give a damn
how you look.

1047
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:01,490
Now, you listen to me.

1048
01:28:01,532 --> 01:28:04,868
I know you had
an affair with Jessica.

1049
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:07,955
So how do you think you're
gonna look if people find out...

1050
01:28:08,038 --> 01:28:11,792
you had sex with the victim
the night before she was killed?

1051
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:38,819
Do you want money?

1052
01:28:41,738 --> 01:28:45,159
No. I want you
to reopen the case.

1053
01:28:48,453 --> 01:28:51,832
There's a saying about
letting sleeping dogs lie.

1054
01:28:51,915 --> 01:28:55,794
You think you're in danger now?
Look at it logically.

1055
01:28:55,878 --> 01:28:59,506
The real danger begins if this case
gets reopened and someone starts...

1056
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:02,050
worrying that you're gonna have
another one of your damn dreams.

1057
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:17,733
All I know is,
the wrong man's in jail.

1058
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:20,944
I don't care how awful he is.
And I helped put him there.

1059
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,616
I can't live
with something like that.

1060
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:30,954
So you find a way
to reopen this case, sir.

1061
01:29:31,038 --> 01:29:32,956
Or I will.

1062
01:30:08,992 --> 01:30:11,328
Buddy!

1063
01:30:18,669 --> 01:30:21,130
Buddy, I'm here if you...

1064
01:30:48,073 --> 01:30:50,200
- Hello.
- Hi, Miss Francis. I'm back.

1065
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:52,202
- Good.
- How are the boys?

1066
01:30:52,286 --> 01:30:54,746
They're fine. They went to sleep.
You want me to bring 'em over?

1067
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:57,833
No. No. Listen.

1068
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,169
Could we stay over
your house tonight?

1069
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:03,380
- Sure you can. You all right?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

1070
01:31:03,464 --> 01:31:06,383
Come over. I'll make a bed for you.

1071
01:31:06,425 --> 01:31:09,011
- All right. I'm just gonna lock up.
- Okay, doll.

1072
01:31:09,094 --> 01:31:11,054
- Okay, thank you.
- Bye-bye.

1073
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:28,739
Buddy!

1074
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:35,078
Oh! Did you see
Buddy Cole?

1075
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:38,207
Buddy? No. I thought he was
at the hospital over in Benton?

1076
01:31:38,248 --> 01:31:41,627
- Oh, he is. Maybe I imagined it.
- Are you okay?

1077
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:43,629
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1078
01:31:43,712 --> 01:31:48,175
Ever since you told me what you told
me, I feel like I'm going crazy.

1079
01:31:48,258 --> 01:31:50,636
Annie, I can't stand
another night of this.

1080
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,679
I need you
to read for me.

1081
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:03,816
It's no good.

1082
01:32:05,609 --> 01:32:08,946
- Try it again.
- I can't make it happen.

1083
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:19,081
How about
what you said today?

1084
01:32:19,164 --> 01:32:21,124
What?

1085
01:32:22,584 --> 01:32:24,503
The pond.

1086
01:32:24,586 --> 01:32:27,756
What if we did
go back out there?

1087
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,801
Do you think
it might help you?

1088
01:32:30,843 --> 01:32:32,803
I... I...

1089
01:32:32,845 --> 01:32:35,389
I don't know.
Yeah. Maybe.

1090
01:32:35,472 --> 01:32:38,100
Yeah, okay. Well,
it's worth a try, right?

1091
01:32:38,183 --> 01:32:41,353
You mean tonight? No, Wayne.
I can't... I can't do that.

1092
01:32:41,436 --> 01:32:43,897
I got my kids. It's dark.

1093
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:46,608
You know, it's... it is a pol...
it's a police matter now.

1094
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:49,236
How long do you think
that's gonna take, Annie?

1095
01:32:49,319 --> 01:32:53,115
It's gonna sit on somebody's desk
for months. Nothing's gonna happen.

1096
01:32:53,157 --> 01:32:55,242
It's over for them. They've got
their man. It's up to us.

1097
01:32:55,325 --> 01:32:58,745
I know that, Wayne. But I'm
telling you, I don't see anything.

1098
01:33:03,959 --> 01:33:06,253
I can't keep running
from things.

1099
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,556
Maybe if you just
sort of walk around.

1100
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:01,558
All right.

1101
01:34:43,433 --> 01:34:45,352
Oh, shoot!

1102
01:34:57,990 --> 01:35:00,159
Jeez, you all right?
You okay?

1103
01:35:00,242 --> 01:35:02,161
Yeah.

1104
01:35:05,706 --> 01:35:07,624
Yeah.

1105
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:44,870
What are you
doing here?

1106
01:35:52,044 --> 01:35:54,046
You seeing something?

1107
01:36:03,388 --> 01:36:07,434
I've been thinking
some real bad, bad thoughts.

1108
01:36:07,518 --> 01:36:08,769
Annie?

1109
01:36:08,852 --> 01:36:12,064
I'm glad that girl is dead.
Jessica.

1110
01:36:12,147 --> 01:36:15,317
She was messin' around with my
husband and deserved what she got.

1111
01:36:19,238 --> 01:36:22,783
I couldn't sleep.
Met the girls for a drink.

1112
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:26,328
Take off your clothes.

1113
01:36:32,543 --> 01:36:35,546
Aren't you taking yours off too?

1114
01:36:35,629 --> 01:36:39,341
There's a saying
about letting sleeping dogs lie.

1115
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:44,680
You just fucked him,
didn't you?

1116
01:36:46,974 --> 01:36:49,893
Donnie Barksdale?

1117
01:36:51,061 --> 01:36:53,021
So?

1118
01:36:53,063 --> 01:36:56,733
Why would you do this to me?
I love you.

1119
01:36:56,817 --> 01:36:58,986
Maybe I wanted to be
with a man for a change.

1120
01:36:59,069 --> 01:37:01,488
- Watch your mouth.
- You watch your mouth. Fuck you!

1121
01:37:01,572 --> 01:37:04,366
- I'm sorry.
- We're through.

1122
01:37:04,408 --> 01:37:07,161
I don't like being spied on.

1123
01:37:07,244 --> 01:37:10,497
The only reason I'm with you
is 'cause my daddy likes you.

1124
01:37:13,083 --> 01:37:15,002
You horrible little bitch!

1125
01:37:15,085 --> 01:37:17,838
I'll show you a bitch if you
don't let go of me. Let go!

1126
01:37:39,943 --> 01:37:42,279
- I think we better go back.
- Nothing's coming to you?

1127
01:37:44,281 --> 01:37:46,241
No.

1128
01:37:46,283 --> 01:37:48,535
Nothing.

1129
01:37:57,461 --> 01:37:59,379
You know.

1130
01:38:02,257 --> 01:38:06,053
I knew if I got you close enough
to it that you'd see it.

1131
01:38:06,136 --> 01:38:09,473
- Wayne, I told you...
- No, no. It's okay.

1132
01:38:09,556 --> 01:38:11,767
I swear to God, Annie,
it's okay. It's okay.

1133
01:38:11,809 --> 01:38:13,811
I wanted you to.
I swear to God.

1134
01:38:13,894 --> 01:38:17,856
I wanted you to see it so bad.
I mean, that's why we're here.

1135
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:20,484
I'm not some killer, Annie.
I'm not.

1136
01:38:20,567 --> 01:38:23,821
You don't... I mean, do you know
what it was like with her?

1137
01:38:23,904 --> 01:38:27,574
She was so fucking hurtful
and spiteful and all of it...

1138
01:38:27,658 --> 01:38:29,243
Wayne, I'm not gonna...

1139
01:38:29,326 --> 01:38:31,995
But all of it just happened
in this flash of a moment.

1140
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:35,541
- Wayne, I...
- Listen to me. I'm a good man.

1141
01:38:35,624 --> 01:38:38,877
If it had been you instead of her,
none of this would have happened.

1142
01:38:38,961 --> 01:38:41,130
Wayne.

1143
01:38:44,007 --> 01:38:45,968
It's all right, you know?

1144
01:38:46,009 --> 01:38:49,263
I won't... I won't tell.

1145
01:38:52,349 --> 01:38:55,477
I won't...
I won't tell anybody.

1146
01:38:57,187 --> 01:38:59,231
No, Annie...

1147
01:40:12,888 --> 01:40:15,224
You all right, Mrs. Wilson?

1148
01:41:04,106 --> 01:41:07,985
I thought you were supposed to
be in the hospital.

1149
01:41:08,068 --> 01:41:11,822
I escaped, Mrs. Wilson.

1150
01:41:11,905 --> 01:41:14,283
I'm free.

1151
01:41:15,701 --> 01:41:18,620
Buddy, I'm so sorry
I wasn't there for you.

1152
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:23,375
- I should've...
- Now, don't you say another word.

1153
01:41:26,587 --> 01:41:30,299
You was the only one
that was a friend to me.

1154
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,760
And I love you.

1155
01:41:37,264 --> 01:41:40,893
You're the soul
of this town, Mrs. Wilson.

1156
01:41:40,976 --> 01:41:45,105
And you just need to keep doing
what you're doing.

1157
01:42:00,454 --> 01:42:02,372
I washed it.

1158
01:42:17,638 --> 01:42:20,015
Will you come back
into town with me?

1159
01:42:20,098 --> 01:42:22,017
Yeah.

1160
01:42:37,866 --> 01:42:41,203
You know you're
gonna have to go back.

1161
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:45,624
Yes, ma'am, I know.

1162
01:43:18,574 --> 01:43:20,534
Can I have your keys,
ma'am?

1163
01:43:43,182 --> 01:43:44,266
Well,

1164
01:43:44,475 --> 01:43:47,728
I just talked to Wayne.

1165
01:43:47,769 --> 01:43:50,772
He pretty much admitted
to everything.

1166
01:43:50,856 --> 01:43:55,235
I've known that boy
half my life.

1167
01:43:58,906 --> 01:44:01,825
It just goes to show,
you can know somebody and...

1168
01:44:05,579 --> 01:44:07,498
not know 'em.

1169
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:13,545
How's his...
How's his head?

1170
01:44:13,629 --> 01:44:15,756
Well, you put
a pretty good dent in it.

1171
01:44:15,798 --> 01:44:18,717
Oh, no, Sheriff,
I told...

1172
01:44:18,801 --> 01:44:20,969
I told the deputy
it wasn't me who did that.

1173
01:44:21,053 --> 01:44:24,097
It was...
It was Buddy Cole. He saved me.

1174
01:44:24,181 --> 01:44:27,226
- No, ma'am. It weren't Buddy.
- Well, yes, it was.

1175
01:44:27,309 --> 01:44:30,813
- Why don't you just ask Wayne?
- I did.

1176
01:44:30,896 --> 01:44:33,232
He don't remember
what happened.

1177
01:44:33,315 --> 01:44:35,567
Head injuries is funny.

1178
01:44:35,651 --> 01:44:40,781
- I'm telling you, it was Buddy Cole.
- What I'm tryin' to say is,

1179
01:44:40,823 --> 01:44:43,158
it couldn't have been Buddy.

1180
01:44:43,242 --> 01:44:45,702
I... I just called up
at the State Hospital.

1181
01:44:45,786 --> 01:44:49,081
- He told me he escaped.
- Ma'am.

1182
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:53,168
Buddy Cole is dead.

1183
01:44:55,629 --> 01:44:58,132
He hanged himself
in the shower room...

1184
01:44:59,758 --> 01:45:01,677
6:00 this evening.
