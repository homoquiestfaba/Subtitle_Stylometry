1
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,233
<i>Law enforcement officials
have had the hospital</i>

2
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,270
<i>under lockdown since she was
admitted earlier today.</i>

3
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,207
<i>She was discovered
wandering the Hollywood Hills</i>

4
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,643
<i>with multiple stab wounds
and dressed only</i>

5
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,346
<i>in blood soaked bandages.</i>

6
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:36,686
<i>The victim has been
unable to identify</i>

7
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:38,486
<i>her attacker at this time.</i>

8
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,390
<i>Thousands of fans
have flocked</i>

9
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,726
<i>to social networking sites
to express their sympathy,</i>

10
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,465
<i>while others, strangely,
are not so sympathetic.</i>

11
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:50,135
<i>I've never seen
so many cute boys</i>

12
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,638
<i>on the beach
at one time.</i>

13
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:56,276
<i>Wait a minute, why are
we all by ourselves?</i>

14
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:57,710
They were
just intimidated.

15
00:03:57,744 --> 00:03:59,545
That is so true.

16
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:03,684
Wait. Two cute girls
looking for boys. Whoo!

17
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:05,618
Okay, girls.
Let's call it a night.

18
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,489
No point in this bloody rain.

19
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:10,024
Would somebody
get me a blanket?

20
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:11,326
I'm freezing.

21
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,164
Hey, are you coming?

22
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:17,399
I'll catch you later.

23
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,692
<i>L.A. is in such
a sad state these days.</i>

24
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,530
<i>It's always been the go-to place
for people talking bullshit,</i>

25
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,265
<i>but this...</i>

26
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:15,535
<i>This is a whole other level.</i>

27
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:17,571
<i>Reality TV.</i>

28
00:05:17,603 --> 00:05:20,106
<i>The birthplace of the moron.</i>

29
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:24,578
<i>Some of us laugh with them,
but most of us at them.</i>

30
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:27,749
<i>All you have to do
is act like a jackass</i>

31
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:30,653
<i>and the offers
will start rolling in.</i>

32
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:34,591
<i>Welcome to Hollyweird.</i>

33
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:07,662
<i>Famous for being famous?
You know what?</i>

34
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:11,869
<i>I think it's time these people
learn the true price of fame.</i>

35
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:19,843
-Hey.
-Hi.

36
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:21,478
-How are you?
-Good, how are you?

37
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:24,215
I'm good.
Thank you.

38
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,317
Hey, ladies.

39
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,684
What can I get you?

40
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:28,387
Can we just get
the usual, please?

41
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,223
And can
we turn this off?

42
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:31,841
This song really
hurts my head.

43
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,426
Yes, of course.

44
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,862
So, my agent called.

45
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:36,263
Yes. Okay.

46
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:38,123
And they want me on that
show I was telling you about.

47
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:38,732
My God.

48
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:41,469
I know. Isn't it crazy?
I'm going to be on TV.

49
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,738
Okay, you're always
on TV, but...

50
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,100
Yeah, but always for
the wrong reasons.

51
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:46,876
Yeah.

52
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,546
Now at least they'll get to see
how amazing my personality is.

53
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:51,214
And how sweet
and humble I am.

54
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:53,216
-You know?
-Yeah.

55
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,587
My Twitter followers
are going to be insane.

56
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:58,890
I should totally
try and hook you up.

57
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:01,905
Yeah, I mean, I've actually
already been there,

58
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,396
done that with reality TV and...

59
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:04,864
I'm already
a household name.

60
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,232
So I'm concentrating
on my serious acting

61
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,170
and hip hop career now.

62
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,842
So I definitely
won't do reality TV.

63
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:17,444
I mean, you'd be
really good.

64
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:19,348
So...

65
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,649
Well, you'll just
have to wait and see.

66
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:26,756
My God,
save this weather.

67
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,792
I was laying out
in the sun earlier,

68
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:31,662
I can't believe I've spent
a lifetime away from this.

69
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:33,797
My God.
I could not imagine

70
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,398
being pasty white
all year round.

71
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:36,767
Girl...

72
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,803
Thank God you have
that spray tan.

73
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:41,241
Well, yeah. I mean, obviously
I've spent my 21 years

74
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:42,975
out of the sun, which
means I'll have naturally

75
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:44,944
wrinkle-free skin,
like, forever,

76
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:46,746
unlike everyone else
around here. So...

77
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,548
That's what Botox
is for, girl.

78
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,284
Because I really want
to throw this party,

79
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:52,621
I hooked up with this
hot DJ last summer

80
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:54,288
and he can probably
have a friend.

81
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,691
And, they love
English accents.

82
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:58,594
Yeah, tell me about it.

83
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:01,730
I can't go anywhere without
getting loads of attention.

84
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:03,665
Same.
So annoying.

85
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,569
Yeah, it must be
really annoying,

86
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:08,005
people pursuing you for your
English accent all the time.

87
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:12,377
So, anyway, this is the
address you're going to.

88
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,712
Thank you so much for doing this.
I really appreciate it.

89
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,049
Yeah, I mean, you know if my parents
found out they would kill me.

90
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,851
I mean, like,
actually kill me.

91
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:22,621
They think I'm,
like, this princess.

92
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:25,991
So, I wanted to ask you

93
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,828
I was thinking about
changing my look up

94
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,863
and going blonde
for the show

95
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:32,433
because I feel like blond
really accentuates my eyes.

96
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:33,835
What do you think?

97
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:35,453
Like if all of it was blond?

98
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,039
Yeah.

99
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:40,977
I mean, aren't you in, like,
one episode for 15 seconds?

100
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,045
I mean, like, you'd
look great whatever.

101
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,883
I just mean
don't go red.

102
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,685
You're such a doll.

103
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:48,820
I know.

104
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:58,397
Glucose, sugar, and...

105
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:00,300
Close.
One more.

106
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,636
Water.

107
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,405
You already had that one.

108
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:07,408
A 14-year-old girl
walks into a hair salon

109
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,377
carrying a Twinkie.

110
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,046
She sits down, hairdresser
puts a plastic cover on her

111
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,115
and starts
cutting her hair.

112
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:16,618
So the girl kicks back and
starts eating the Twinkie.

113
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:20,056
Not realizing that the hair that's
being cut is dropping onto the Twinkie.

114
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,928
The hairdresser
is trying to be polite.

115
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:27,998
He says, "Young lady, you're
getting hair on your Twinkie."

116
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,934
The girl jumps up,
she smiles real big.

117
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:33,005
She says, "I know.
I'm getting tits, too."

118
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:38,711
I'll give you a clue.
It rhymes with...

119
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,715
Rhymes with...

120
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,816
It rhymes
with street power.

121
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,051
Street power.

122
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,822
Street power.

123
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,394
Press you
for an answer.

124
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:53,662
Man, I can't think
with all this pressure.

125
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,532
Street...

126
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:57,867
Tree flower.

127
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,106
What the fuck
is tree flower?

128
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:05,175
It sounds like something
that would go into a Twinkie.

129
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:07,679
Why do you always
give me a hard time?

130
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:10,148
Flour. Flour. It's not something
that grows out of the ground.

131
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:12,017
It's not something
that has fucking petals.

132
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,821
Flour. F-L-O-U-R.
Flour.

133
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:16,790
I don't give
a fuck anyway.

134
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:19,559
Why are we sitting here playing
guess what's in the Twinkie,

135
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:22,929
and don't eat that shit anyway.
It's fucking horrible for you.

136
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,991
It'll give you cancer.

137
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:15,157
You must be
the bullies?

138
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,163
You look like bullies.

139
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,569
I'm here for the,
you know...

140
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:25,971
One sec.

141
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,548
I'm here
for the exchange.

142
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,822
Okay. First of all, I think
everybody needs to calm down

143
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:42,591
and then we can
get on with business.

144
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:52,318
Twinkie?

145
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:53,569
No thank you.

146
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:55,840
Like I said, if we could
just get on with the exchange.

147
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:57,608
Exchange.
That's the first time

148
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,710
I've ever heard it
called an exchange.

149
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:01,013
But I like it.

150
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,648
It's classy.

151
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:06,119
I've never actually
done this before.

152
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:09,321
And I'm really not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

153
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,124
I'm a little bit
nervous, actually.

154
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:13,127
So if you could just
walk me through this.

155
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,194
I'll walk you
through it, honey.

156
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:17,131
Don't worry. I'll walk
you through it, honey.

157
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:19,034
Here.
This should take care it.

158
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:21,302
Okay, I'm so confused.
I should be paying you.

159
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:25,107
My reputation
precedes me.

160
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:38,306
You've been
walked through.

161
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:39,925
Thank you.

162
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,059
Fuck off.

163
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,234
Get the fuck out.

164
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,172
Okay.

165
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:58,614
Aren't we gonna
get no pussy?

166
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,050
Just eat your fucking
Twinkie, man.

167
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:07,991
<i>Look, you can't
avoid this forever.</i>

168
00:13:08,024 --> 00:13:11,127
<i>I think if you agree to rehab, the
judge might be lenient with you.</i>

169
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,200
<i>Remember, you're not the star you
were anymore. You're another nobody.</i>

170
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,935
<i>That reality show doesn't
count as an acting job.</i>

171
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:20,138
<i>It's time to give up the
dream and get a real job.</i>

172
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:27,187
Hey.

173
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:30,016
<i>the grizzly discovery
in the Hollywood Hills.</i>

174
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:32,777
<i>The mystery continues to unravel
as someone calling himself</i>

175
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:33,687
Here you go.

176
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:36,257
<i>The LA Slasher
has claimed responsibility</i>

177
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,294
<i>for the violent attack
on the reality TV star</i>

178
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:41,830
<i>by posting an incriminating
video online.</i>

179
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,767
<i>The video has
already gone viral.</i>

180
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,252
<i>It was posted earlier today.</i>

181
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:46,703
Thanks.

182
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,782
Hey, sugar tits.

183
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:56,184
Hey.

184
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:57,302
How are you doing?

185
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:58,386
Good.
How are you?

186
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,057
I'm good.
I'm really good.

187
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,225
Hey, I saw that reality
show the other night.

188
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:04,293
Really? What'd you think?

189
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:06,011
-That shit is awful.
-Great.

190
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:07,464
Why'd you even bother?

191
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:10,401
Hey, you should be doing
one of these movies up there.

192
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,203
There might be
a role in it for you

193
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:13,938
if you show me how much
you really want it.

194
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:15,908
-What kind of movie?
-It's like a horror movie.

195
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:18,278
-A horror movie?
-Yeah. We're taking it to Cannes.

196
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,428
You been to Cannes?

197
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:20,546
No.

198
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,082
So, you know
this party we're doing?

199
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:25,118
-You mean the one I'm doing?
-Yeah.

200
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:28,455
I'll bring all the right people.
It'll be crawling with celebs

201
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:31,125
if you make it
worth my while.

202
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:32,960
-You know what I mean, gorgeous?
-I'm good.

203
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:35,097
-All right, well, enjoy your night.
-Absolutely.

204
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,866
-Bye.
-Take it easy.

205
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,377
<i>Leave a message.</i>

206
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,847
Hey, babe.
What are you up to?

207
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,849
I lost my voice.
I went to this rager.

208
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,985
It was amazing.
You should've been there.

209
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:56,321
Hey wait, I'm at work.

210
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:58,524
So, what'd you end up
doing last night?

211
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,194
Hey, did you hear that girl
who's supposed to guest star

212
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,529
on our show next month?

213
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,133
I mean, small
fucking world, right?

214
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,368
That's kinda crazy
and kinda scary.

215
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:10,105
Anyway, guess who I ran into
at the club tonight?

216
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:12,374
That creepy ass producer guy.

217
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:14,443
I don't know about
having him organize our party.

218
00:16:14,477 --> 00:16:16,980
I kinda feel like it's going to
be a bunch of lame old dudes

219
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:19,448
hanging around, just gonna
sit around and stare at us.

220
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:21,419
I know. Like I don't get
enough of that at work.

221
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:24,288
Anyway, let me let you go.
I'll call you later.

222
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,424
I have a hot date tonight
and I got to get ready.

223
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,394
But I love you lots.
Mwa. Bye.

224
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,092
That's awful.

225
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,095
I can't believe all these
people are in my house.

226
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:29,466
I know.
I am so Tweeting this.

227
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,572
I know. I'm sorry. But it's
kinda funny, right? I mean...

228
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,473
Who invited
all these people?

229
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:39,576
Probably a Facebook invite
or something.

230
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,130
Is there any men here?

231
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:44,650
No.

232
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:47,585
No, dude, I know. It's like Star
80 on steroids or something.

233
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:50,023
No, seriously,
it's creeping me out.

234
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:52,459
Someone sent me a link to all that
shit he's been streaming online.

235
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,260
-Did you watch it?
-Hell no.

236
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:56,130
I act in horror movies
for a living.

237
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:59,400
I don't want to watch
that shit in real life.

238
00:17:59,432 --> 00:18:04,272
But, hey, on the upside, they'll probably
be making a movie about this soon.

239
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:09,079
This party is so tragic. It's actually
kind of funny. It's kinda entertaining.

240
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:12,682
My God, I totally see that
douchebag producer over there.

241
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:15,019
-Hey, girl.
-Why do you still hang out with him?

242
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,170
I... because he's rich.

243
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:17,288
That's disgusting.

244
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,023
I know.
He is disgusting.

245
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,624
And now it's raining.

246
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:22,627
-Are you kidding?
-Like it could get any worse.

247
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:24,663
Yeah,
this party sucks.

248
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:27,332
Do we have to stay
at our own party?

249
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:28,668
I don't know.
Want to go eat?

250
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,737
It's not funny.
This is my house.

251
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:33,107
We should just call the cops
and get them to empty it out.

252
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,377
No, but I mean, come on.
It will make for a good story.

253
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,478
You know what's
an even better story?

254
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:39,713
What if The Slasher
showed up tonight?

255
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:41,549
My God,
you would love that.

256
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,585
-Did you watch the news last night?
-Yes.

257
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:45,354
You're sick
in the head.

258
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:47,590
No, I'm just
all about entertainment.

259
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:49,759
I mean,
it's kinda crazy.

260
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:53,664
I mean,
it could be anybody here.

261
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:55,799
Yeah.
Maybe it's you.

262
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,736
Maybe it's me.

263
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,507
Maybe I'm The Slasher. Who
will be my next victim?

264
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,808
That girl over there.

265
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,477
What? The one
with the weave?

266
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,481
Or the one
with the Payless shoes?

267
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:10,551
How's my hair?
How's my tits?

268
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,835
Another one?
You look great.

269
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:13,086
You ready?

270
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,755
Let's go eat. Come on.
I'm starving.

271
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:17,092
I'm not leaving all these
people in my house.

272
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,594
Lock it up, let them stay on the
roof, let's go grab some food.

273
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:21,531
I'm, like,
dying for a milkshake.

274
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,803
Look at this girl.

275
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:35,518
<i>The infamous star of numerous
accidentally released sex tapes</i>

276
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,620
<i>was attending a party
with friends at this home.</i>

277
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:42,526
<i>Several witnesses state she had not
been seen since around 11:30 p.m.</i>

278
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,828
Excuse me. Sir?

279
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:48,299
Can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

280
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,502
Yeah, hey.

281
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:52,271
Well, they wouldn't
let me in the party,

282
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:55,473
but I stuck around because
that smoking hot chick

283
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,509
from one of those sex tapes
was here.

284
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,745
But I heard
someone drowned.

285
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:01,749
I mean, someone
killed that girl.

286
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:05,351
You know, you are one pretty girl.
Is this Channel 6?

287
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:06,654
I usually watch Channel 4.

288
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:07,923
Exciting development.

289
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:09,957
You know, I got a few
comments I could throw in.

290
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:12,694
I wasn't done talking. If
y'all let me say a few words.

291
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:15,597
<i>Because I know y'all's doing that
promo for America's Got Talent.</i>

292
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:17,266
I couldn't make it,
so I was thinking

293
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:19,335
you give me the microphone
and just show off

294
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:21,772
some of my singing abilities.
Wouldn't that be pretty cool?

295
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:24,276
-I mean, you're not talking into it.
-Seriously?

296
00:21:29,346 --> 00:21:31,683
<i>What's going on, guys? We're
coming at you raw right now.</i>

297
00:21:31,717 --> 00:21:33,519
<i>You might know
this girl from...</i>

298
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:36,722
<i>Well, you know
where you know her from.</i>

299
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,491
<i>I wasn't supposed
to do that?</i>

300
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:40,859
<i>All right, man,
I hope she gets home safely.</i>

301
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:42,597
<i>I don't know.
I want to see another tape.</i>

302
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:44,497
<i>I jerk off
to her sometimes.</i>

303
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,299
<i>Like you don't jerk off to her.
Whatever.</i>

304
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:48,236
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

305
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,937
<i>I know we haven't spoken
in a long time.</i>

306
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:51,873
<i>It's your agent,
by the way.</i>

307
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:54,577
<i>I just wanted to call
to say it really sucks</i>

308
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:58,248
<i>about what happened at your house
last night. Well, to the girl anyhow.</i>

309
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:03,688
<i>On the other hand, this is fantastic.
You're all over the news.</i>

310
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,592
<i>No such thing as bad publicity.
Am I right or what?</i>

311
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:09,632
Thank you, thank you,
my wonderful darlings.

312
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:13,969
It means so much to myself

313
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:18,742
and my delicious
little wifey here

314
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:24,750
to have you welcome us to our new
life in Los Angeles, of course,

315
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:27,985
with such wide open arms

316
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:33,694
and such friendly loving smiles.

317
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:55,619
This stuff
is fucking incredible.

318
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:59,690
It's the same sort of thing we have
every week darling, but thank you.

319
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:01,360
You're talking
about the food?

320
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:29,024
Hello.

321
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:29,992
Hello.

322
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:31,729
Who's a good boy?

323
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,998
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

324
00:24:34,031 --> 00:24:36,033
You being a good boy?
Who's a little sweety?

325
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:38,603
Hey.
Who's a little sweety?

326
00:24:46,512 --> 00:24:47,782
Hey.

327
00:24:53,688 --> 00:24:55,857
Yeah?

328
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,026
Aren't you dead yet?

329
00:24:58,058 --> 00:25:02,197
Sweetheart, why don't
we have a little talk outside?

330
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:45,849
Hey.

331
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:48,818
I'm grounded.

332
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:50,854
<i>You're what?</i>

333
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:52,524
Grounded.

334
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:55,728
<i>That's too funny.
Seriously?</i>

335
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,830
<i>No, but you're coming, right?
You have to come.</i>

336
00:25:58,864 --> 00:26:00,834
<i>You have
everything on you.</i>

337
00:26:00,866 --> 00:26:06,039
Yeah. Babe, seriously, they're,
like, really, really mad.

338
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:15,283
So one of those guys
was, like, huge.

339
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:18,588
And he was really
really rude to me.

340
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,690
And the other guy thought
I was, like, a prostitute.

341
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:25,195
Seriously, you can get
your own stuff next time.

342
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:30,302
And by the way,
in other news...

343
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:35,874
I just had the best and worst
dinner party of my life.

344
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:39,011
<i>Hey, what's with you?</i>

345
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:42,015
Nothing. I'm good.
Like, I'm great.

346
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,983
<i>You're acting
kind of strange.</i>

347
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,285
<i>You better
save some for me.</i>

348
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:47,021
I have no idea
what you mean.

349
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,126
<i>Look, just get your ass down
that drain pipe ASAP, okay?</i>

350
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,364
<i>I'm sure you're going to be
flying off that shit anyways.</i>

351
00:26:55,396 --> 00:27:00,202
Seriously, I'm not sure.
Like, I feel like shit.

352
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:04,041
<i>Shut up.
Get over here, like, now</i>

353
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:07,778
<i>before I go over there and tell
your parents a shitload of stuff</i>

354
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,648
<i>they don't want to hear about
their little princess. Okay?</i>

355
00:27:10,682 --> 00:27:14,186
Okay.

356
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:18,190
Give me an hour.

357
00:27:27,968 --> 00:27:30,005
Hey, hon.

358
00:27:30,037 --> 00:27:32,941
I'm sorry about yelling
at you earlier.

359
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:34,644
I shouldn't have done that.

360
00:27:34,677 --> 00:27:38,015
But I just really want
to see you tonight.

361
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:39,682
Call me back.

362
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:41,118
Bye.

363
00:27:51,762 --> 00:27:53,332
<i>Hey, hon.</i>

364
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:56,102
<i>I'm sorry about yelling
at you earlier.</i>

365
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:57,936
<i>I shouldn't have done that.</i>

366
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,307
<i>But I just really want
to see you tonight.</i>

367
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:02,010
<i>Call me back.</i>

368
00:28:57,907 --> 00:28:59,342
Yeah.

369
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:01,714
Well...

370
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:07,486
I'm actually just leaving this event.
I had to make an appearance.

371
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,861
I'd really love to,
but I can't tonight.

372
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:19,200
I have actually to, I have
to go home and feed my dogs.

373
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:23,105
Yeah. All right. Bye.

374
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:04,920
It's me.
Where the hell were you?

375
00:30:04,954 --> 00:30:06,856
I'm on my way home.

376
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,360
Just get your cute butt over
as soon as you can, okay?

377
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,495
<i>I'm here with one of the biggest
pop stars in the world.</i>

378
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:15,032
<i>Thanks for joining us.</i>

379
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:17,434
<i>Have you been following the
news about the L.A. Slasher?</i>

380
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:20,038
<i>I mean I've heard about it. I
don't follow that shit, though.</i>

381
00:30:20,072 --> 00:30:22,007
<i>Do you have any messages
that you want to send</i>

382
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:25,244
<i>to the victims
of the L.A. Slasher?</i>

383
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:28,882
<i>Wait, yeah. Maybe if they had any
talent, everybody wouldn't hate them</i>

384
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:30,584
<i>and the Slasher wouldn't
have gone after them.</i>

385
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:32,854
<i>Ouch. That's pretty harsh.</i>

386
00:30:32,886 --> 00:30:34,888
<i>Do you think the Slasher
would ever go after you?</i>

387
00:30:34,922 --> 00:30:37,291
<i>Why would the Slasher
possibly go after me?</i>

388
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:40,295
<i>I actually have talent unlike these
other fools he's going after.</i>

389
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:42,866
<i>Speaking of talent, you've
been in the spotlight a lot,</i>

390
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:44,500
<i>for everything
but your music.</i>

391
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:46,401
<i>Can you tell us
what's been going on?</i>

392
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:48,571
<i>Whatever. Just trying
to have a good time.</i>

393
00:30:48,605 --> 00:30:51,608
<i>I'm so pissed I didn't win a
Grammy, which I totally deserved.</i>

394
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,377
<i>Only now
I don't even care.</i>

395
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,479
<i>People are unfair to me.</i>

396
00:30:55,513 --> 00:30:58,082
<i>They make up stories about
me to make me look bad.</i>

397
00:30:58,116 --> 00:31:01,420
<i>Reports have surfaced that you've
been spitting on your fans.</i>

398
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:04,389
<i>That is so no true. I love my fans.
I bought them hot chocolate</i>

399
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:06,293
<i>and let them listen
to my new song.</i>

400
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,594
<i>And reports of you peeing
in a restaurant mop bucket</i>

401
00:31:08,628 --> 00:31:11,032
<i>and cursing
a former president?</i>

402
00:31:11,064 --> 00:31:12,933
<i>You know, sometimes
people make mistakes.</i>

403
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:14,569
<i>Haters just try
to tear you down.</i>

404
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:16,939
<i>Just trying
to stay positive, you know?</i>

405
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:19,374
<i>We also heard a lot of
controversy with you speeding</i>

406
00:31:19,408 --> 00:31:21,544
<i>through the neighborhood
that you live in.</i>

407
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:23,387
<i>Your neighbors must hate you.</i>

408
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:26,249
<i>That's the risk you take in the
same neighborhood as a superstar.</i>

409
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:30,020
<i>I mean, they should just know to
look out for me. I'm royalty.</i>

410
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,389
Cinnabun!

411
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:35,394
Cinnabun!

412
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,699
Cinnabun!

413
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,001
Come here, girl!

414
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:47,675
You know not to go outside.

415
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:50,611
Come here, girl!

416
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:56,019
Cinnabun!

417
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:03,294
Cinnabun, come out!

418
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:06,530
Cinnabun.

419
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:15,173
<i>What's going on,
lovely people?</i>

420
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:18,244
<i>We got some raw footage to show you
that just hit the net right now.</i>

421
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:21,280
<i>Just a head's up. It might get a
little gnarly for some viewers.</i>

422
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,652
<i>Twerk it, girl. Twerk it.
Hip hop it out, baby.</i>

423
00:32:24,684 --> 00:32:27,355
<i>Don't make me come over there.</i>

424
00:32:27,387 --> 00:32:31,193
<i>Damn. Look, all right, we're
making a public shout out</i>

425
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:34,295
<i>right now to all of you to stop
using any and all social media</i>

426
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,366
<i>that might be helping
this L.A. Slasher fool.</i>

427
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:38,633
<i>I mean, we're getting
a lot of stories coming out.</i>

428
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,037
<i>It looks like this dude is no
joke, all right? For real.</i>

429
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,743
<i>L.A. Slasher is for real.
God bless.</i>

430
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:48,379
<i>Yo, can we run that tape again?
She was hot.</i>

431
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:51,582
Please, sir,
whoever you are,

432
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:55,553
we urge you,
bring our daughter home

433
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:58,157
<i>A child of privilege,
yes, I give you.</i>

434
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,660
<i>But she does not deserve
to be punished.</i>

435
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:05,332
Bitch, please. She needs
to be put in her place.

436
00:33:05,365 --> 00:33:07,634
Look, I'm actually
doing you a favor.

437
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:52,621
<i>-You're an animal.
-She's our only daughter.</i>

438
00:33:52,653 --> 00:33:54,206
<i>You're an animal.</i>

439
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:55,758
<i>Any... any amount
of money. Any.</i>

440
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:59,530
<i>Everybody hates reality TV,
but they watch it</i>

441
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:03,200
<i>just so they can tell you
about how much they hate it.</i>

442
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:06,371
<i>Whatever problems you have, change
the channel until you find somebody</i>

443
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:09,441
<i>who's worse off and then suddenly
your life doesn't seem so bad.</i>

444
00:34:09,473 --> 00:34:11,677
<i>Let me tell you something,
it is that bad.</i>

445
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,779
<i>Life just keeps going
round and round,</i>

446
00:34:13,813 --> 00:34:16,317
<i>only you have
to clean it, wash it out.</i>

447
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,752
<i>Wash out the shit.</i>

448
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:22,157
<i>The mayor has spoken out
against the L.A. Slasher today</i>

449
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,425
<i>and urges the public
to disregard any material</i>

450
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,328
<i>that's been posted online.</i>

451
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,131
<i>The Mayor is quoted
as saying the L.A. Slasher</i>

452
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:31,666
<i>is a despicable menace
to society.</i>

453
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,839
<i>He's just another fame chaser
looking for his 15 minutes.</i>

454
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:38,174
<i>I'm despicable?</i>

455
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,513
<i>Look who's talking,
you fucking man whore.</i>

456
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,181
<i>What would your wife say?</i>

457
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:44,816
Baby.

458
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,289
Martin.

459
00:34:59,232 --> 00:35:00,734
Mama mia.

460
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:07,611
Martin.

461
00:35:09,979 --> 00:35:12,549
Look what
I got for you, pal.

462
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,218
Look what I got for you.

463
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,352
Lots and lots of this.

464
00:35:16,386 --> 00:35:18,689
A lot of money.

465
00:35:18,722 --> 00:35:22,560
This is a five.
I'm going to keep this.

466
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:26,265
Okay, Martin.

467
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:30,370
Wish me luck.

468
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:32,372
Ladies...

469
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:34,542
Ladies.

470
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:37,946
Buy me another drink.

471
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:30,306
We're out
in the middle of nowhere.

472
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:35,479
I know. I'm not really sure
where the nav is taking us.

473
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:37,014
Why didn't he send a driver?

474
00:36:37,015 --> 00:36:38,516
I don't think
they can afford one.

475
00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:44,490
God. Let's just hope your lovely
car doesn't cut out on us.

476
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:46,325
I've had this car
since I was 17.

477
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:47,726
It hasn't failed me yet.

478
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,897
I love this car,
but like you said,

479
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,999
you've had it
since you were 17.

480
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:54,835
And this is not the place
we want to break down.

481
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:57,372
I mean, what if the
Slasher is out here?

482
00:36:57,405 --> 00:36:59,608
Don't you think it's ironic
that he's picking on girls

483
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:02,477
who are kind of
exactly like us?

484
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,749
Since when does everyone
just want to be famous?

485
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:18,363
-No way are you smoking that in here.
-Really?

486
00:37:18,397 --> 00:37:19,699
Yeah.

487
00:37:19,732 --> 00:37:21,900
God, you fucking health freaks.

488
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:23,503
Let's just do
a little blow.

489
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:25,072
-My God.
-Stop.

490
00:37:25,104 --> 00:37:27,340
-You just killed my lady boner.
-Lady boner?

491
00:37:27,374 --> 00:37:29,110
1987.

492
00:37:29,111 --> 00:37:30,844
Aw, isn't his accent
just really cute?

493
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:32,913
In a short bus
kind of way.

494
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:35,350
No, we are not drunk...
yet.

495
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,019
-Hey.
-Whoo.

496
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:39,388
So you're making
a movie about this.

497
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,925
Yeah, I'm thinking about making
a movie about this Slasher guy.

498
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:43,826
That's how you make money.
Horror movies.

499
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:45,395
Ass sewn to mouth.

500
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,548
All in the name of fun.

501
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:49,966
Yes. Those are
actual films.

502
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:51,736
-With scripts and you know...
-Yeah.

503
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,472
Awesome.

504
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,807
Are you going to put
your pants on first?

505
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,009
I'm taking my pants off.

506
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,145
See? I'm comfortable.

507
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,614
You think this is the casting couch.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,950
-I don't think so.
-It's going to take a little bit more...

509
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:06,387
Come on. Who wants a fucking
role in the sequel or not?

510
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:07,938
Are we being punked?

511
00:38:07,939 --> 00:38:09,456
Well...

512
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:12,159
-Okay, let's stop. I'm getting out.
-Driver!

513
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:14,863
We're fucking late. I can't
believe we're fucking late.

514
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:16,310
This is only going
to take a minute.

515
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:18,433
You know none of us are
going to fuck you, right?

516
00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:20,904
Really?

517
00:38:20,937 --> 00:38:22,039
My God.

518
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,140
I'm going to get out.

519
00:38:23,172 --> 00:38:25,642
Going to find out
what the fuck is going on.

520
00:38:25,675 --> 00:38:27,144
Driver!

521
00:38:32,683 --> 00:38:34,018
Hey, buddy!

522
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:36,522
Move this fucking
piece of shit.

523
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:39,826
I got a fucking red carpet,
got some babes in the back.

524
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:41,495
Move your fucking
piece of shit.

525
00:39:10,062 --> 00:39:12,665
Maybe I wish the Slasher
would come for me.

526
00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:15,601
Aw, sweetie, you're not
famous enough to be abducted.

527
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:19,171
But how cool would that be
if we were actually abducted?

528
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:22,242
Our ratings would go
through the roof.

529
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:26,914
But speaking of, we really do
need to get our ratings up.

530
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,517
I mean, reality TV
is no longer real.

531
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,219
It's totally scripted.

532
00:39:31,253 --> 00:39:34,022
This is real.

533
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:36,091
Yeah, he's really
killing people.

534
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,796
Yeah, but who cares? These
are, like, worthless people.

535
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:40,931
They contribute
nothing to society.

536
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,067
So it's okay
for them to die?

537
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:45,035
I mean, who's really
gonna miss them?

538
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:47,939
We are those people.

539
00:39:47,972 --> 00:39:50,275
It's like he's trying
to get rid of anybody

540
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:52,811
who just wants to be
famous for five minutes

541
00:39:52,844 --> 00:39:54,514
and has no real talent.

542
00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:56,883
It's like some kind
of weird social statement

543
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:59,119
about everything
that's wrong with the world.

544
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:01,989
Well, I actually think
that's a great statement.

545
00:41:30,293 --> 00:41:33,797
I didn't do anything.

546
00:42:14,744 --> 00:42:18,716
<i>Well, hello,
ladies and douchebags.</i>

547
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,888
<i>Thanks for joining me.
It's so nice to have you here.</i>

548
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,256
<i>First up, auditions.</i>

549
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:27,694
<i>Yay. We all know you're not
famous for your talents,</i>

550
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:29,729
<i>but just
for shits and giggles,</i>

551
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:33,101
let's see if there's a brain
beneath all that makeup.

552
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,337
<i>You're not auditioning
for some stupid TV show here.</i>

553
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:40,742
<i>No, no, no.
This is much more important.</i>

554
00:42:40,776 --> 00:42:43,245
<i>Best get
to running those lines</i>

555
00:42:43,278 --> 00:42:46,449
<i>and practice,
practice, practice.</i>

556
00:42:56,861 --> 00:42:59,897
<i>And you, Needledick, you're
going to film these girls.</i>

557
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:02,267
<i>But this time you're the one
who's going to be naked.</i>

558
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,239
<i>You're going to get what you
always wanted, a worldwide hit.</i>

559
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,182
<i>The police are working
around the clock</i>

560
00:43:15,215 --> 00:43:19,187
<i>to remove all the videos placed
online by the L.A. Slasher.</i>

561
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,793
<i>However, the online auditions have
already attracted millions of views.</i>

562
00:43:23,826 --> 00:43:25,428
I think that there's
a lot more to me

563
00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:28,465
than just being
from a very wealthy family.

564
00:43:28,498 --> 00:43:32,904
I'm famous,
and I'm very well liked.

565
00:43:32,937 --> 00:43:34,840
Very well liked.

566
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:37,342
Raging rock and...

567
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:41,113
Shall break the locks
of prison gates.

568
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:46,554
I think I should be a star
of the show because...

569
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:49,957
well, a lot
of people want to watch me.

570
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:56,132
I could play...

571
00:43:57,966 --> 00:43:59,968
I definitely think
it's my great sense of style.

572
00:44:00,002 --> 00:44:04,108
I have great hair,
and I like to have a good time.

573
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:08,946
Fuck.

574
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,253
Why are we doing this?

575
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:17,455
Three, two...

576
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:21,127
<i>A looming fear increases
that the Slasher's antics</i>

577
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,831
<i>may be building to a climax.</i>

578
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:27,201
And we are out.
Whoo. Good job.

579
00:44:27,235 --> 00:44:30,138
Here we go.
Here we go.

580
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:30,972
Hurry up. Come on.

581
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:32,574
Sorry. Sorry. Here
we are. Here we are.

582
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:33,809
Stress level's high.

583
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,010
I've got a great idea.

584
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:37,246
Let's hear this one.

585
00:44:37,279 --> 00:44:40,917
I'm going to go on Twitter so I can
tell the world where I am all the time.

586
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:43,420
So I can get into the tabloids,
like, all the time.

587
00:44:43,454 --> 00:44:46,122
You're crazy. This sounds
like a grand plan.

588
00:44:46,155 --> 00:44:47,492
Lighter. Thanks.

589
00:44:49,928 --> 00:44:50,930
Take that in.

590
00:44:53,031 --> 00:44:53,934
Let it in.

591
00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:59,506
It's fucking moronic.

592
00:44:59,538 --> 00:45:02,209
They might as well give the guy
a map and paint a big fucking X

593
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,260
on their foreheads.

594
00:45:03,261 --> 00:45:04,278
That's a bit drastic.

595
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,583
All right, come on.
Let's get out of here.

596
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:10,051
Let's go.

597
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:11,287
Come on.

598
00:45:14,656 --> 00:45:16,893
<i>Hello, lovely people.</i>

599
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,329
<i>We're here today talking
about the L.A. Slasher</i>

600
00:45:19,362 --> 00:45:22,433
<i>How super exciting.
The critics' reviews are in.</i>

601
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:25,069
<i>Your performance was like
a big freaking horse's ass.</i>

602
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:27,373
<i>It's full of hot wind. I don't
know whether to slap that thing</i>

603
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:28,857
<i>or sadly want
to feed your head.</i>

604
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:30,308
Fucking love you, dude.

605
00:45:30,342 --> 00:45:31,343
We like his mask.

606
00:45:31,344 --> 00:45:32,344
We love the mask.

607
00:45:32,377 --> 00:45:34,314
<i>I don't know. I don't know
if anyone's saying it,</i>

608
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:37,217
<i>but is it just me
or is he doing a good thing?</i>

609
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:39,386
<i>Hey, Sugar,
forget the talking.</i>

610
00:45:39,419 --> 00:45:43,523
<i>Keep the moaning with a big
juicy cock in your ass.</i>

611
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:46,295
We love the L.A. Slasher. We like
what he's doing. We love it.

612
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,563
<i>I mean, I don't know. I'm not
going to arrest a garbageman</i>

613
00:45:48,595 --> 00:45:51,366
<i>because he's throwing away my
garbage, you know what I'm sayin'?</i>

614
00:45:51,399 --> 00:45:54,236
<i>Stuck up English bitch. You
think you're prettier than me?</i>

615
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:56,640
<i>You make me go fucking...
On my fucking fat thighs.</i>

616
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:59,119
Yo, L.A. Slasher, we love
you. Fuck those reality stars.

617
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,343
Fuck those reality stars.

618
00:46:00,376 --> 00:46:03,180
Golddiggers
get famous overnight.

619
00:46:03,214 --> 00:46:05,116
<i>I mean these people
are stupid.</i>

620
00:46:05,149 --> 00:46:08,654
<i>-They're reality TV stars.
-Who gives a?</i>

621
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,565
<i>God, you're pathetic.</i>

622
00:46:18,598 --> 00:46:21,168
<i>A teenage girl
desperate for fame.</i>

623
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:23,671
<i>Let me see, I can't sing
and I can't dance.</i>

624
00:46:23,704 --> 00:46:27,241
<i>I know, I have a womb. I'm
going to get myself pregnant.</i>

625
00:46:27,274 --> 00:46:30,279
<i>You fucking bitch.
So now you got a baby.</i>

626
00:46:30,312 --> 00:46:32,515
<i>And the next spark of genius
that pops into</i>

627
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:35,485
<i>your little fucking pea brain...
porn. I'm sorry.</i>

628
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,155
<i>I mean, sex tapes, because
that's a little more refined.</i>

629
00:46:38,188 --> 00:46:40,658
<i>Why don't you show
your loving family</i>

630
00:46:40,692 --> 00:46:43,161
<i>what you've been
up to these days. Use it.</i>

631
00:46:43,194 --> 00:46:44,763
<i>Enjoy it.</i>

632
00:46:44,796 --> 00:46:48,034
<i>Potato. Potahto.
You're a fucking whore.</i>

633
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:49,568
<i>You should be used
to this by now.</i>

634
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:51,637
<i>You love
people watching, right?</i>

635
00:46:54,073 --> 00:46:56,175
<i>Don't tell me
you're ashamed.</i>

636
00:46:56,209 --> 00:47:00,048
<i>Look, if you don't watch,
she dies.</i>

637
00:47:03,551 --> 00:47:05,421
This is it, bro.

638
00:47:05,454 --> 00:47:07,289
We're the big cats.

639
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:09,292
King of the jungle.

640
00:47:09,324 --> 00:47:12,061
Tigers, man.
Fucking tigers.

641
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:15,166
We're lions. If we're kings of
the jungle, we're fucking lions.

642
00:47:15,198 --> 00:47:19,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hakuna matada.
We're top dogs, baby.

643
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,339
Before we go talking
about the dogs,

644
00:47:21,373 --> 00:47:23,342
let's finish talking
about the cats.

645
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:27,380
Hey. My cousin's giving us
the crown, bro.

646
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:32,053
Your cousin's
in prison... bro.

647
00:47:32,085 --> 00:47:34,221
I told you, if we to do this,
we're going to do this my way.

648
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:37,393
Direct, protected,
and right under the radar.

649
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:24,647
I've got a lot of sex appeal
and, you know,

650
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,750
I just really bring
the boys out to play.

651
00:48:28,885 --> 00:48:32,856
Well, a porcupine walks straight
through a pride of lions.

652
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:34,825
And the cubs may attack
because the cubs

653
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:37,129
are fucking idiots and they
don't know any better.

654
00:48:37,162 --> 00:48:40,465
But the elders,
the elders are smart.

655
00:48:40,498 --> 00:48:42,701
They know better.

656
00:48:42,735 --> 00:48:46,906
Mr. Porcupine is armed.
Mr. Porcupine is ready.

657
00:48:46,939 --> 00:48:51,245
Mr. Porcupine will pierce right
through their skin and fuck them up.

658
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:53,915
See?
We're the porcupine.

659
00:48:53,947 --> 00:48:56,284
So we're
porcupines, amigo.

660
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:58,419
Not the lion.

661
00:48:58,452 --> 00:48:59,788
Or the tigers.

662
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:03,692
Porcupine.

663
00:49:03,726 --> 00:49:07,331
Wake me up
when we get there.

664
00:49:07,363 --> 00:49:09,867
<i>The mayor of Los Angeles
remains missing.</i>

665
00:49:09,899 --> 00:49:12,638
<i>And speculation increases
that the mayor may have been</i>

666
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:15,207
<i>the latest victim
of the L.A. Slasher.</i>

667
00:49:32,293 --> 00:49:33,695
Hey, it's me.

668
00:49:33,728 --> 00:49:36,499
Where are you?

669
00:49:36,531 --> 00:49:38,633
I've been calling you
all day.

670
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,538
The show's looking for you.

671
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,607
Look, this isn't
funny anymore.

672
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,845
I'm coming over.

673
00:49:53,918 --> 00:49:56,554
<i>I just want to be the first to
say from the bottom of my heart,</i>

674
00:49:56,587 --> 00:50:00,860
<i>who gives a?
She's a stupid bitch, right?</i>

675
00:50:00,892 --> 00:50:03,630
<i>Who cares? Hey, Slasher.
Good one.</i>

676
00:50:07,768 --> 00:50:10,496
<i>Hey, Channel 6. Do you see a
direct link between the victims?</i>

677
00:50:10,497 --> 00:50:11,406
Yeah.

678
00:50:11,438 --> 00:50:13,374
<i>They're all hot.</i>

679
00:50:13,407 --> 00:50:15,944
<i>-Do you feel safe on the streets?
-I'm safe.</i>

680
00:50:15,977 --> 00:50:18,280
<i>I don't have a damn thing
to worry about.</i>

681
00:50:18,314 --> 00:50:20,016
<i>Who do you think the Slasher's
next victim will be?</i>

682
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,686
I hope it's not
a hot blonde.

683
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,621
Kardashians got it coming,
I gotta say.

684
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:26,358
There's no victims.

685
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,292
Is there anybody else
you think has it coming?

686
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,594
Do I even need
to say the word Snooki?

687
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:33,431
-Have you watching online?
-I follow the news. Yeah, of course.

688
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:35,268
-Of course.
-I have.

689
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,868
You find it entertaining?

690
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:38,437
All up until the end.

691
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:39,889
Are you watching
the clips online?

692
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,307
I've seen
a few of them, yeah.

693
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:43,644
Are you afraid of the
clips that you've seen?

694
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:44,412
Not at all.

695
00:50:44,444 --> 00:50:46,847
People like watching train wrecks.
It's ridiculous.

696
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,457
Do you think these
people had it coming?

697
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:48,983
Yeah.

698
00:50:49,017 --> 00:50:51,197
So, you agree with what
the Slasher's doing?

699
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:52,288
Wholeheartedly.

700
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,591
I think they're pretending to be
real, but they're really not real.

701
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,327
They just want attention.

702
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,563
Yeah, it's kinda like
Greece with the Coliseum.

703
00:50:59,595 --> 00:51:02,365
We're just watching people kill
each other for fun at this point.

704
00:51:02,398 --> 00:51:03,900
We've come full circle.

705
00:51:03,934 --> 00:51:06,538
Somebody help me!

706
00:51:15,648 --> 00:51:20,421
<i>Everyone is so sick and tired of
seeing your stupid fucking face.</i>

707
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:23,391
<i>And by the way, why do
you call the paparazzi</i>

708
00:51:23,423 --> 00:51:25,460
<i>every time you have
to wipe your fucking ass</i>

709
00:51:25,492 --> 00:51:27,494
<i>and then act like
they're bothering you?</i>

710
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:30,632
<i>Don't forget, they helped you
get you where you are,</i>

711
00:51:30,665 --> 00:51:32,600
<i>you fucking idiot.</i>

712
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:35,938
<i>In all the time you spent
typing away on Twitter</i>

713
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:38,040
<i>and posting selfies
and pictures</i>

714
00:51:38,074 --> 00:51:40,678
<i>of your fucking
breakfast burrito,</i>

715
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:44,683
<i>you did not use your fame for a
good cause or to help anyone else.</i>

716
00:51:44,716 --> 00:51:47,786
<i>You could have rescued a cute
furry fucking cat from a tree,</i>

717
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:54,026
<i>or help an old bitch lady
cross the street or something.</i>

718
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,963
<i>You got married
just for the TV ratings.</i>

719
00:51:56,996 --> 00:52:00,000
<i>Do you even have a soul?</i>

720
00:52:09,779 --> 00:52:12,950
You know, a dog
is a huge responsibility.

721
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,386
No. No.

722
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,156
No.

723
00:52:19,189 --> 00:52:23,461
No, not my baby. No, please.
No, not my baby.

724
00:52:24,996 --> 00:52:27,465
No.

725
00:52:27,498 --> 00:52:29,100
All right, sweetie.

726
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:31,604
Make him sit.

727
00:52:31,638 --> 00:52:34,007
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

728
00:52:35,909 --> 00:52:38,712
Sit for mommy. Sit for mommy, baby.
Sit!

729
00:52:38,746 --> 00:52:41,183
Sit for mommy,
baby, please!

730
00:52:41,215 --> 00:52:42,834
Sit. Sit down now.

731
00:52:42,835 --> 00:52:44,452
-Dear.
-That's a.

732
00:52:44,486 --> 00:52:46,488
Sit, buddy, sit.

733
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:48,757
Sit.

734
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,559
No.

735
00:52:50,592 --> 00:52:51,828
No.

736
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:54,831
No!

737
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:31,140
I have a really big fan base.

738
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,510
And I have a lot
of followers on Twitter.

739
00:54:13,189 --> 00:54:16,528
Okay, welcome to the midnight
meeting of Killers Anonymous.

740
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,831
I'm your fearless leader
tonight, and I'm a killer.

741
00:54:19,864 --> 00:54:21,866
I've identified myself
as a killer.

742
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:25,238
Anyone else here a killer? If so,
signify by raising your hand.

743
00:54:25,271 --> 00:54:27,841
Good to see
you guys here again.

744
00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:30,545
Mark. Quentin.

745
00:54:30,578 --> 00:54:33,014
Big Joe, it's good to see
you out on probation again.

746
00:54:33,047 --> 00:54:34,983
You're a solid dude.

747
00:54:35,015 --> 00:54:38,052
I would trust you with my life.
I mean that.

748
00:54:38,086 --> 00:54:41,757
So, anyway,
that's my share today.

749
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:44,126
I've got six minutes,
so, Delores,

750
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,329
you want to give me
four and two, time that.

751
00:54:46,362 --> 00:54:49,866
And remember about the
can, of course, the fumes.

752
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,004
Remember what we said?
Okay?

753
00:54:53,037 --> 00:54:57,143
Okay. So I've read
the big red book,

754
00:54:57,175 --> 00:54:59,177
and I was thinking
about the fourth step.

755
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,014
You know, we talked about
triggers and what sets us off.

756
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,318
You know. You know
what I'm talking about.

757
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,619
Things that
really get to you.

758
00:55:06,653 --> 00:55:09,056
Anyway, I think it was Thursday.
I was cooking a chicken.

759
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:11,092
You know, I'm getting ready,
cooking dinner.

760
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:13,195
And I'm cutting the chicken up.
I got the knife in there

761
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,697
between the breast bone
and the thigh.

762
00:55:15,731 --> 00:55:19,134
And the fucking knife
sticks in the bone.

763
00:55:19,168 --> 00:55:20,904
You know what I'm saying?

764
00:55:20,936 --> 00:55:22,806
You know how that feels,
you know?

765
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:25,142
When you get the knife
stuck in the bone like that?

766
00:55:25,175 --> 00:55:29,013
I mean, it just...
It just...

767
00:55:29,046 --> 00:55:30,949
Hey, sir, welcome.

768
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:33,217
Welcome. This is the
midnight meeting of KA.

769
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,322
Do you want to join us here?
Yeah.

770
00:55:37,356 --> 00:55:40,360
Come on in. Got a seat here for
you right next to Big Joe.

771
00:55:40,392 --> 00:55:42,596
Don't need to be afraid.
Come on in.

772
00:55:44,864 --> 00:55:45,966
Sir?

773
00:55:47,434 --> 00:55:50,871
Hey, we're here
every week at midnight.

774
00:55:50,905 --> 00:55:53,409
He's probably afraid.
He'll be back.

775
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:57,078
So, anyway, I was saying
this set me off.

776
00:55:57,111 --> 00:55:59,248
And then later in the week
I'm at the dog park

777
00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:01,285
and I swear
I was not stalking anyone.

778
00:57:39,232 --> 00:57:42,370
<i>Guys, it looks like it's a sad day
in the world of autotune pop music.</i>

779
00:57:42,402 --> 00:57:45,005
<i>As one of the world's largest
pop stars got abducted today.</i>

780
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:48,077
<i>From a gym. Can you believe
that little bitch was at a gym?</i>

781
00:57:48,109 --> 00:57:50,178
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love your music.</i>

782
00:57:50,211 --> 00:57:52,081
<i>I do. I love his music.</i>

783
00:57:52,114 --> 00:57:53,516
<i>Whatever.</i>

784
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,277
Better grab a seat.

785
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:20,916
I love party games.

786
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:24,888
Why am I not surprised
at you, you fucking rich bitch?

787
00:58:32,561 --> 00:58:33,563
Hello?

788
00:58:35,298 --> 00:58:38,536
Can anyone hear me? Hello?

789
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:42,041
Look, the sun rises
in the east, sets in the west.

790
00:58:42,074 --> 00:58:45,110
We gotta go east,
I'm telling you.

791
00:58:45,143 --> 00:58:46,945
It's east.

792
00:58:46,978 --> 00:58:49,949
Fucking lost in the middle
of the fucking desert.

793
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,584
Fuck. Fuck.

794
00:58:51,618 --> 00:58:54,389
The sun's over
my left shoulder.

795
00:59:01,562 --> 00:59:06,169
We got to go...
It's gotta be east.

796
00:59:06,201 --> 00:59:09,873
Okay. I can't believe they actually
want me to broadcast this bullshit.

797
00:59:09,907 --> 00:59:13,309
Poor girls, evil men,
are you fucking kidding?

798
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:16,046
Do they have no clue
who these people are?

799
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,317
They're the villains
wasting your time, my time,

800
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:23,456
with their pointless shit
and their fucking idiocy.

801
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:25,391
Fucking idiocy.
Here we go.

802
00:59:25,423 --> 00:59:27,560
We're on
in three, two...

803
00:59:32,265 --> 00:59:35,202
<i>The hunt for the Slasher
continues across Los Angeles</i>

804
00:59:35,235 --> 00:59:37,538
<i>as the families
of these poor victims</i>

805
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:40,276
<i>plead to the public
for any information.</i>

806
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:44,281
<i>The beloved popstar's spokeswoman
said earlier, quote,</i>

807
00:59:44,313 --> 00:59:47,449
<i>"He plays a huge role
in the artistry of this city</i>

808
00:59:47,482 --> 00:59:49,987
<i>and without him
we are weak."</i>

809
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:55,359
<i>You know what?
I'm done.</i>

810
00:59:55,393 --> 00:59:59,498
Wait.

811
01:01:01,803 --> 01:01:05,075
Mommy and Daddy's money
can't save you now.

812
01:01:21,627 --> 01:01:22,394
Please.

813
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:24,698
You've bought your way out
of trouble so many times,

814
01:01:24,731 --> 01:01:28,770
You must think life
is just a big party.

815
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:40,516
Please.

816
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:43,253
Please leave me alone.

817
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:46,024
Please.

818
01:02:03,442 --> 01:02:07,782
Tell me, who do you hate more,
your friends or your enemies?

819
01:02:07,815 --> 01:02:11,386
Or is it hard to tell when you're
stabbing them in the back?

820
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,723
Fuck you, bitch.

821
01:02:15,756 --> 01:02:18,127
That feels good.

822
01:02:36,682 --> 01:02:40,187
Everybody knows me
for having a lot of money.

823
01:02:40,219 --> 01:02:43,690
Well, it's my daddy's money,
but it's mine.

824
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:13,859
<i>Just moment's ago,
a 2000 Honda Civic</i>

825
01:03:13,892 --> 01:03:15,861
<i>was found, which is believed
to be the vehicle</i>

826
01:03:15,894 --> 01:03:18,132
<i>of the L.A. Slasher's
latest victim.</i>

827
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:22,837
<i>Look, we got
some news for you.</i>

828
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:24,740
<i>Another chick got taken today.</i>

829
01:03:24,772 --> 01:03:27,309
<i>Reality TV star.
She's hot as fuck.</i>

830
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:29,411
<i>Ass and titties.
I don't know why she's gone.</i>

831
01:03:29,444 --> 01:03:30,946
<i>I'm sorry, I got
a little emotional.</i>

832
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,815
<i>She's hot.
Let's get her home.</i>

833
01:03:32,848 --> 01:03:35,318
<i>All right, I'm sorry.
Peace and love.</i>

834
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,222
No.

835
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:41,426
No, don't you
fucking touch me.

836
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:44,629
Don't you fucking
come near me.

837
01:03:44,661 --> 01:03:47,365
No, get away from me.

838
01:03:47,398 --> 01:03:49,001
Don't fucking touch me.

839
01:03:49,002 --> 01:03:50,603
My God. You are
the worst of them all.

840
01:03:50,635 --> 01:03:52,672
You have destroyed marriages,

841
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:55,642
grabbed headlines,
dragged names through the mud.

842
01:03:55,674 --> 01:03:58,545
And I want you
to know how that feels.

843
01:04:00,447 --> 01:04:04,720
I'm going to leave you
to work that one out, genius.

844
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:19,269
No.

845
01:04:20,438 --> 01:04:22,308
No. No.

846
01:05:00,951 --> 01:05:02,820
Whoops.

847
01:05:02,853 --> 01:05:06,025
Hi. You're going the wrong
way, you stupid bitch.

848
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:09,763
Go that way, please, because
this is a cat and mouse game.

849
01:05:09,796 --> 01:05:14,402
And you're the little mouse
and I'm the big fat cat.

850
01:05:14,435 --> 01:05:16,704
So, move along.
Go along.

851
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:18,340
Go ahead.

852
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:19,474
Come on, honey.

853
01:05:19,506 --> 01:05:21,276
That way.

854
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,767
Hello?

855
01:08:32,801 --> 01:08:34,971
Hey. Hey!

856
01:08:35,004 --> 01:08:36,706
Can anyone hear me?

857
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:37,874
Help!

858
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:39,276
Please, I need help!

859
01:08:39,309 --> 01:08:42,179
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Please!

860
01:08:43,746 --> 01:08:45,183
Come on, please help me!

861
01:11:11,889 --> 01:11:14,358
Come on.
Come on.

862
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:15,794
Come on!

863
01:12:03,483 --> 01:12:05,318
It's bullshit, man.

864
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:06,919
Freezing my balls off.

865
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,488
Hey, relax, man.

866
01:12:08,521 --> 01:12:11,292
According to this map, it's
right around here somewhere.

867
01:12:11,324 --> 01:12:13,494
What the fuck
you mean relax?

868
01:12:13,528 --> 01:12:16,365
We're out here trying to
find an underground drug lab

869
01:12:16,397 --> 01:12:18,232
in the middle
of the desert

870
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:20,436
with an X marks
the spot map at night

871
01:12:20,468 --> 01:12:22,905
with a fucking torchlight
with the say so

872
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,175
of your goddamned cousin
who's in prison.

873
01:12:25,209 --> 01:12:27,510
Why? Because he fucking
got caught selling

874
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:29,380
said drugs
from said lab.

875
01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:31,382
So excuse
the fuck out of me

876
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,351
if I'm a little anxious
at the moment.

877
01:12:33,384 --> 01:12:35,052
Hey, what
the fuck was that?

878
01:12:35,086 --> 01:12:38,024
Who's out there?

879
01:12:38,056 --> 01:12:40,059
It's probably
just a coyote.

880
01:12:40,092 --> 01:12:41,361
Or an alien.

881
01:13:06,056 --> 01:13:08,193
Jesus. Fuck.

882
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:21,442
I'm so fucking sorry
you got to find out this way.

883
01:13:21,475 --> 01:13:23,344
Dispatch.
Patch me through.

884
01:13:23,376 --> 01:13:26,045
This is narcotics division
officer number 3-0.

885
01:13:26,078 --> 01:13:27,515
No fucking way.

886
01:13:30,051 --> 01:13:31,953
Just let me
help this woman.

887
01:13:31,985 --> 01:13:33,255
Then we can talk, bro.

888
01:13:33,289 --> 01:13:35,591
I'm your bro now?

889
01:13:35,624 --> 01:13:37,159
Fuck you.

890
01:14:42,168 --> 01:14:44,171
Come on, baby.

891
01:14:44,204 --> 01:14:49,211
You, of all people, know you
don't need to be afraid of me.

892
01:14:49,244 --> 01:14:50,413
Come on.

893
01:15:15,508 --> 01:15:17,078
You understand me.

894
01:15:19,446 --> 01:15:20,748
Thank you, baby.

895
01:16:52,623 --> 01:16:56,228
<i>More tears are shed
on reality TV shows</i>

896
01:16:56,261 --> 01:16:59,731
<i>than in all
the funerals of the world.</i>

897
01:16:59,763 --> 01:17:01,666
<i>And it doesn't matter
if the tears are real.</i>

898
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,336
<i>Or if the tears are fake.</i>

899
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,705
<i>You, my friend,
have been sucked in.</i>

900
01:17:05,737 --> 01:17:08,841
<i>Bamboozled.
So enjoy that, people.</i>

901
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:11,845
<i>Because like it or not,
this is us.</i>

902
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,716
<i>We're a people
of savage sentimentality.</i>

903
01:17:15,749 --> 01:17:19,655
<i>Weeping and waiting for fame.</i>

904
01:17:26,862 --> 01:17:30,535
<i>I do not believe
I did anything illegal.</i>

905
01:17:30,568 --> 01:17:33,204
<i>I just want to say one thing
to the American people.</i>

906
01:17:33,237 --> 01:17:37,309
<i>I did an awful awful lot
that was wrong.</i>

907
01:17:37,341 --> 01:17:41,647
<i>I did not have sexual
relations with that woman,</i>

908
01:17:41,681 --> 01:17:43,482
<i>Miss Lewinsky.</i>

909
01:17:43,516 --> 01:17:45,886
<i>I never told anybody to lie.</i>

910
01:17:45,919 --> 01:17:48,622
<i>Not a single time. Never.</i>

911
01:17:48,655 --> 01:17:51,159
<i>These allegations are false.</i>
