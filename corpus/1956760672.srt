[girl 2] Oh, it's the better Gap.

343
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,916
[girl 1] So much better
than the one in Wenatchee.

[girl 2] Ugh. Wenatchee...

345

- None of that is you.

- Yeah. I fell asleep a few times,

Why else would you do this?

No, I've got savings.

Yes. Also, you're in a debate
on who's the better Hepburn.

513
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,291
[Mr. Chu] Who there?

514
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,250
[in Mandarin] Ba, did we wake you?

515
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:15,875
School project.

516
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:17,666
Hi, Ellie Chu's dad.

517
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:24,184
We don't have time to school you
on everything Aster thinks you are,

518
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,625
so we have to be selective.
Deep versus broad-based learning.

519
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,083
- Huh?
<i>- </i>We spy on her,

520
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,750
then cram you on her greatest hits.

521
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,000
Oh, cool.

522
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,833
- Are you ready for this?
- Yes.

523
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,083
[hushed] Are you ready for this?

524
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,083
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

525
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,000
Shh!

526
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,416
So, in <i>No Exit,</i>
three people are trapped in hell.

527
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,041
A door opens, but nobody leaves.

528
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,083
[Paul]
That's nuts. He can't stand these people.

529
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,750
A door opens and he doesn't leave?

530
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,184
[Ellie] He's trapped in hell.
It's a metaphor for existence.

531
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,041
[Paul] My nana hated Minnesota. She left.

532
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,767
[Ellie] Your nana wasn't one of
the great thinkers of the 20th century.

533
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,333
- [Paul] Nana's not trapped in hell either.
- [Ellie groans]

534
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,625
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

535
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:03,333
The hell's got into Munsky?

536
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:09,750
<i>You're like some marvelous, distant,
well, queen, I guess.</i>

537
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,791
<i>You're so cool and fine.</i>

538
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,875
[Hepburn] <i>I don't want to be worshiped,
I want to be loved.</i>

539
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,666
Key thing about <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>
is it's a plea for tolerance.

540
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,270
Check this out. I'm calling it
taco sausage. Do you want a bite?

541
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,916
No. So tolerance...

542
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,291
Two hand foods, one great taste.

543
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,916
Conversation is like ping-pong.

544
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,666
I hit one and then you...

545
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What the...

546
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,625
Oops.

547
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,291
[crowd groans]

548
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,041
- [screaming]
- [giggling]

549
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,291
[crowd gasps]

550
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,958
- [crowd groans, shrieks]
- [Aster continues giggling]

551
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,041
[instrumental spy music playing]

552
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,958
We're writing a profile
on the student we most admire.

553
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,500
Oh, cool, cool.

554
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:30,103
- Views on women in the workplace?
- Does Aster like lean meats?

555
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,583
[both] What are you doing?

556
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:33,791
- I'm good cop.
- Then how come you aren't smiling?

557
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,041
I'll smile when you follow the plan
that I carefully...

558
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:39,208
I'm surprised more kids
haven't asked to interview me. Huh.

559
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:40,916
I'm going in.
I'm going in with my smile.

560
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,833
[announcer]
<i>Looks like The Moose have a man open.</i>

561
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,083
<i>Oh!</i>

562
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,583
[Paul] You're not hungry?

563
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,916
Not if it's not time to eat.

564
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,208
Now that's weird.

565
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,958
Hey, uh, can I ask you a question?

566
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,541
I don't want to try a taco sausage.

567
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,375
Why Squahamish?

568
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:35,083
Just, like, your dad seems so unhappy here
and you also seem kind of unhappy.

569
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,583
- I gotta go.
- No, no, no, wait.

570
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:40,833
No, you're not taking this seriously.
I have a ton of work I have to do.

571
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,333
No, just, you're so smart.
Like, too smart to, like...

572
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,976
Waste my time trying to win you a girl
who'll never look your way?

573
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,666
- No, it just seems weird.
- You're weird!

574
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,750
No... Yes.

575
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,750
- Enjoy your happy life in Squahamish.
- No, no...

576
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:56,083
The thing about <i>No Exit </i>is it's like how
what I really want is to run my own shop,

577
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,916
with new recipes. And... And FYI,
taco sausage is really effing good.

578
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,458
Okay, but I'm the fourth son

579
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:03,833
and my family's been making
the same sausage for 49 years

580
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:06,356
and it doesn't matter
if they're going broke, or out of style,

581
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:07,333
they're Nana's recipes.

582
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,684
If Ma can't have Nana,
at least she can make her sausages.

583
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,628
If I break away, it'll break her heart.
And it's either her heart or mine.

584
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,333
[panting]

585
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,416
So I stay.

586
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:32,666
[Ellie scoffs]

587
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,208
[sighs heavily]

588
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,208
We had to go
where my dad could get a job.

589
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,500
He studied trains?

590
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,083
Engineering.

591
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,333
PhD, no less.

592
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,041
So, uh,

593
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,625
he became the station manager
at Squahamish.

594
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:54,708
To start.

595
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:58,250
The plan was to be promoted
to system engineer.

596
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:00,541
Or anything engineer.

597
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,166
Squahamish was a jumping-off point.

598
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,000
It turns out speaking good English
trumps having a PhD.

599
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,583
Or one from China anyway.

600
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,875
And my dad, he...

601
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,291
Doesn't speak very good.

602
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:18,666
- He's not bad.
- I don't speak very good either.

603
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:22,875
True.

604
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:25,708
What's your excuse?

605
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,375
How do you feel about pot roast?

606
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:38,791
I should get back to the station.

607
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,458
I know, but we've gotta eat.

608
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,291
[sighs]

609
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,684
- [engine starts]
- [boy] <i>Mom!</i>

610
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,375
[girl] Tommy, stop friending my friends!

611
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:51,000
Would you like to weigh in or are you
just gonna scream throughout the meal?

612
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,916
I'll deal with the dog wrestling.

613
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,708
- Mom!
- It's your fault!

614
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,791
[overlapping shouts]

615
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,458
[Paul] Or we could go to your place?

616
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,500
[jaunty instrumental music plays on TV]

617
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,625
[cutlery clinks softly]

618
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,375
[sighs]

619
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,083
Match energy, match strokes,
and just say one thing.

620
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:34,625
Where were you born?

621
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:35,958
In Squahamish.

622
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,166
What about you?

623
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,375
Okay. Good. That wasn't so hard.

624
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,416
But where were you born?

625
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,708
I don't need talking practice.

626
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,083
It just seems
like a really short conversation.

627
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,250
[Ellie sighs]

628
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:58,583
I was born in Xuzhou, China.

629
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,375
When did you come here?

630
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,291
When I was five.

631
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,875
- What do you like about Squahamish?
- Uh...

632
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,083
I've never been anywhere else.

633
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,250
Me neither.

634
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,333
[Mr. Flores]
<i>How does Satan get his message through?</i>

635
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:23,541
Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers,
the immoral persons. [groans]

636
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:29,958
Does he write letters?

637
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,500
- No, he causes us to question.
- [phone vibrates]

638
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,083
Question our lives, our path.

639
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,083
Our very faith in God.

640
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,708
- Satan plants the seed of doubt...
- [phone vibrates]

641
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:46,708
...and, from that seed, grows sin.

642
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:48,625
Sin is everywhere.

643
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,291
We're lucky to live in a good town
like Squahamish.

644
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:57,083
But the world is changing.

645
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,208
Let us stay strong against Satan's call,

646
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:05,333
lest sin creep in and destroy
the good life God has prepared for us.

647
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:07,375
[school bell rings]

648
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,666
You know what it's like to finally meet
someone your age who gets you?

649
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,458
You know where else you can meet
people your age who get you?

650
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:19,541
College.

651
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,483
[Paul] <i>You should send some emojis.</i>

652
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,541
[whispers] I'm not sending her emojis.

653
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:28,125
Do pineapple, owl,
caterpillar with glasses.

654
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,000
[Ellie] What does that mean?

655
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,458
That doesn't mean anything.

656
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,381
[Paul]
Glasses make the caterpillar look smart.

657
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:35,125
Favorite food?

658
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,250
Braised pork over rice. Yours?

659
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,791
[both] Taco sausage.

660
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,708
- Does braised pork have five-spice powder?
- How do you know five-spice powder?

661
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,166
I kind of creeped in your cabinets.

662
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,958
I'm always looking for new spices.

663
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,958
Giving up on the taco sausage?

664
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:51,958
Oh, no way. I've been writing to the paper
in Wenatchee for months now.

665
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,666
If I could just get the guy to taste it.

666
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,416
- The gateway to greatness is Wenatchee.
- Yeah.

667
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,625
Hey, you gotta try it.

668
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,708
What do the other Munskys think?

669
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,916
They haven't tried it.

670
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,125
Taco sausage has a nice ring to it.

671
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,333
Yeah, right?

672
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:16,708
Hey.

673
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:17,791
Yeah?

674
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:20,083
What was your mom like?

675
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,958
Young, funny, dead.

676
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,500
No, before she died.

677
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,458
Young, funny...

678
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,875
fun.

679
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,125
She sounds cool.

680
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Yeah.

681
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,666
I bet she would've tried
the taco sausage.

682
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,000
[laughs]

683
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,083
[chattering indistinctly]

01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:46,333
It's not finding your perfect half.
It's...

1396
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:48,791
the trying...

1397
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:50,375
and...

1398
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:52,708

failing.

1400
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,750
Love is...

1401
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:05,208
being willing to ruin
your good painting...

1402
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:09,166
for the chance at a great one.

1403
01:30:19,833 --> 01:30:22,208
Is this really the boldest stroke
you can make?

1404
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:28,875
You.

1405
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:32,750
Yeah.

1406
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:46,875
[crowd exclaiming]

1407
01:30:48,041 --> 01:30:49,125
[Mr. Flores] Aster!

1408
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
- [door shuts]
- Everyone, please, take your seats.

1409
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:57,291
- [overlapping chatter]
- Everyone, take your seats.

1410
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:58,708
Wait.

1411
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:00,750
So I'm the good painting?

1412
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:04,583
Mommy wants you to know, in case
you are gay, Mommy still loves you.

1413
01:31:04,666 --> 01:31:06,916
- I'm not gay, Mom.
- Thank God.

1414
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,458
I might want to change
our sausage recipe, though.

1415
01:31:09,541 --> 01:31:10,750
Are you insane?

1416
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:12,666
- I love that recipe!
- Whatever Dad said!

1417
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:15,625
[overlapping arguments]

1418
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:18,875
Now that is some divine intervention.

[turns on faucet]

1420
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:39,806
[in Mandarin] This is a lot of dumplings.

1421
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:44,375
Six days, 18 meals.

1422
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,291
To Grinnell.

1423
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,916
We didn't come here
so you could be like me.

1424
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:57,875
We came here
so you could be like your mother.

1425
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:26,041
[in English] You don't mean dead, right?

1426
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:31,041
[in Mandarin] God, I hope not.

[Ellie] You haven't been to church.

1430
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,000
[Aster] I'm busy.

1431
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:21,583
Yeah?

1432
01:33:22,833 --> 01:33:23,833
Yeah.

1433
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:28,083
You need four portfolio pieces
for art school, so...

1434
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,500
Art school?

1435
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:31,041
That's great.

1436
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,833
Yeah, well, nothing's great yet,

1437
01:33:34,333 --> 01:33:35,333
but we'll see.

1438
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:38,875
What's going on with you?

1439
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:41,166
Well...

1440
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:43,625
I'm headed east to Grinnell.

1441
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:47,000
- I'm leaving tomorrow...
- That's great, Ellie. Take care.

1442
01:33:48,916 --> 01:33:49,916
Aster!

1443
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:53,833
I'm sorry.

1444
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,500
It was just...

1445
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:02,833
supposed to be one letter.

1446
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,333
I never meant to hurt you.

1447
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:29,916
Deep down, I probably knew the truth.

1448
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:35,541
You really didn't use enough emojis
in his texts.

1449
01:34:36,791 --> 01:34:38,166
I don't know what they mean.

1450
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:39,458
A puppy or...

1451
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:43,000
- a sausage...
- I should have sent you a sausage emoji?

1452
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:44,958
Fair point.

1453
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:51,291
For what it's worth...

1454
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:56,416
it's not like the thought
never crossed my mind.

1455
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,250
You know...

1456
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,166
if things were different.

1457
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:06,708
Or I was different.

1458
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:13,541
You could never be different.

1459
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:16,833
"Am I sure I'm different?

1460
01:35:17,166 --> 01:35:19,666
- How do I know I'm sure?"
- Hey, I can be sure.

1461
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:21,166
"I mean, what does God think?"

1462
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:23,541
[scoffing] Oh, my God.

1463
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:27,416
- And on, and on, and on, and on.
- And you know, you... you watch.

1464
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,708
Okay? In a couple of years,
I am gonna be so sure.

1465
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:31,833
Good luck with that.

1467
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:43,583
Find something good in Iowa
to believe in, heathen.

1468
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:07,541
I'll see you in a couple years.

I'll keep him busy tasting new ketchups.

Nice write-up in the <i>Town Crier.</i>

1474

Yeah, Munsky Sausages is gonna blow up.

1475
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:16,833
I might get to Iowa before you do.

1476
01:37:16,916 --> 01:37:17,958
I'd better get going then.

1477
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:27,708

1480
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,541
Too smart to be crying on a platform
like a wussy.

1481
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:40,708
I'm not crying.

1482
