00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,110
(soft piano music)

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,070
- [Narrator] In a city full of
people

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,230
we can never feel alone,

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,000
or so I've heard.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,210
Millions of people living in one
place

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,130
talking together,
laughing, crying together,

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,220
rushing down streets powdered
with snow.

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,230
We're fascinated with
the stories and songs

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,090
that help us see into each
other's lives.

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,110
So why is it that we
can't talk to each other?

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,070
What makes us so cold?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,140
Thinking back to Christmas
from my childhood

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,150
I remember going into the
icy wind to sing carols.

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,130
We'd give cards with messages of
love

15
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,190
and plates of warm cookies.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,030
We took care of each other.

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,090
Her doors were always open.

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,060
Somehow that all changed.

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,030
We keep our doors closed now.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,160
We sit in our homes and do our
own things.

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,040
(loud banging from upstairs)

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,120
(chuckling)

23
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,160
The people I live with are
faces lost in the crowd,

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,120
strangers.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,040
I only know them by the
footsteps on my ceiling

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,150
and the voices down the hall.

27
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,180
They push the same buttons
to reach the same floors,

28
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,180
we share the same space.

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,120
I'd never knew they were my
neighbor.

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,120
I had forgotten what a neighbor
was.

31
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,210
(upbeat ukulele music)

32
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,090
- Out, I'm mopping.

33
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,030
Unbelievable.

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,020
(laughing)

189
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,210
Now you really wanna hang out?

190
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,190
- Oh yes you are.

191
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,160
(laughing)

192
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,000
(elevator bell dinging)

193
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,090
(disgusted groan)

194
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,110
- Hey, Scary!

195
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,010
(elevator bell dinging)

196
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,050
- Excuse me.

197
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,200
(elevator bell dinging)

198
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,010
(baby crying)

199
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,150
- Shh...

200
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,090
- It's okay now Otto.

201
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,050
Sorry.

202
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,070
- Hey, oh my body...

203
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,210
(soccer ball bouncing)
(elevator bell dinging)

204
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,050
(disgruntled groan)

205
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,050
- Excuse me.

206
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,150
(elevator bell dinging)

207
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,150
- Floor please.

208
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,200
Thanks.

209
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,180
Muffin, no!

210
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,180
Stop it!

211
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,100
(laughing)

212
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,150
(dog barking)

213
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,020
We are taking the stairs
for your punishment.

214
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,020
(laughing)

215
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,040
- Stupid dog.

216
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,030
- Hey man, I gotta go
back to my apartment.

217
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,170
I forgot something.

218
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,190
- What was it, your homework?

219
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,150
Dude, forget it.

220
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,100
Just take the zero.

221
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,140
- You don't know Miss
Pennywinkle, she'll kill me.

222
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,200
- Oh Pennywinkle, death by
Pennywinkle!

223
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,110
(elevator rumbling)
(screaming)

224
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,080
- You've got to be kidding me.

225
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,220
- [Maggie] No, no, no, no, no.

226
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,180
- What?

227
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,140
- I can't be here right now.

228
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,030
This can't be happening.

229
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,110
- Dude, this guy smells like
Alka Seltzer and baked beans.

230
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,230
- [Chase] Stop smelling him.

231
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,020
- I'm sure it's fine, it's just
stuck.

232
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,130
- I'm stuck on the elevator with
Santa

233
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,020
and his gang of merry elves.

234
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,230
Help me out here.

235
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,020
- Hey!

236
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,120
- Oh shoot...

237
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,050
- I don't care if half of
New York's in a blackout.

238
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,150
- Yeah we have to get out of
here.

239
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,110
- Quit stuffing your face with
donuts

240
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,180
and get us out of here!

241
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,140
- You just made sure we're the
last people they're helping.

242
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,050
Thanks a lot.

243
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,130
(mumbling)

244
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,150
- [Cameron] So what's the deal?

245
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,020
You guys coming to let us out or
what?

246
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,000
- Can you hear us?

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Can you hear us?

248
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,070
- Get out of there.

249
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:55,220
- [Cameron] You are
sorry to hear about that.

250
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,230
That's hilarious.

251
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,200
- [Maggie] Who are you talking
to?

252
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,010
That better be the electrician.

253
00:13:59,010 --> 00:13:59,190
- We're stuck in the elevator
with scary,

254
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,110
te Glee club hobbit

255
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,090
It could be worse.

256
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,120
We could be in here with B.O.
guy.

257
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
- Shut up Tristan.

258
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,150
- Just give us a couple minutes.

259
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,200
This place will stink like a
dead man.

260
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,060
- We're stuck in an
elevator with eight people.

261
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,060
How hard is this to fix?

262
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,090
Okay okay, so what does
your manager have to say?

263
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,170
- Don't push that.

264
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,050
Every time you push a
button, somebody dies.

265
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,180
(laughing)

266
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,160
- Sorry, I didn't know.

267
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,150
- Sorry.

268
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,200
- I should of took the stairs.

269
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,080
- [Maggie] I cannot, this is too
much!

270
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,120
This is really too much
and I have a deadline.

271
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,210
- The stairs?

272
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,080
- You don't think I can take the
stairs?

273
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,160
- I didn't mean it--

274
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,170
- I got a bullet in my
side in Vietnam, alright?

275
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,140
I think I can handle some
stairs.

276
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,180
- Sir, I didn't say you
couldn't, sir.

277
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,210
- Well you had a tone.

278
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,130
It was in your eyes.

279
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,110
And stop looking at me
like you feel sorry for me.

280
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,120
- Oh I don't feel sorry for you.

281
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,220
I feel sorry for me.

282
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,040
(chuckling)

283
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,000
- Figures.

284
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,100
Stupid kid.

285
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,000
You too!

286
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,140
- Okay okay.

287
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,200
We've got an old guy in here.

288
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,230
That should give us some
kind of priority, right?

289
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,020
He could keel over at any
second.

290
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,090
- Are you crazy?

291
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,150
Don't say that.

292
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,090
- Half of New York's in a
blackout.

293
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,070
Does anyone have anything
that would get us

294
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,230
to the top of the priority list?

295
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,190
I've got somewhere to be.

296
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,090
- I'm sorry.

297
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,210
- I've got an interview in, 30
minutes.

298
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,160
- Oh, did you lose your job?

299
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,030
- I'm hiring.

300
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,120
Come on people, get us to
the top of the rescue list.

301
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,180
Someone's got to have something.

302
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,140
- Cancer.

303
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,210
I had a pancreatectomy.

304
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,040
They took out half my pancreas.

305
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,060
- Good.

306
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,060
Good, that's good stuff.

307
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,000
- Medicine?

308
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,160
- Oh yeah, I'm on my last
reservoir,

309
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,040
but it should last me
about 10 hours in here.

310
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,230
- Man if we were stuck
in here for 10 hours

311
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,130
I'd do something I'd regret
like,

312
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,170
hooking up with you

313
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,140
and free falling down the
elevator shaft.

314
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,090
(off putting scoff)

315
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,050
- [Cameron] Can you get someone
down here

316
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,190
what's your name?

317
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,190
What's your name?

318
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,230
- Still having a good day?

319
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,170
I spy with my little eye

320
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,200
a kid who's trying to
hard to play it cool.

321
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,120
- [Cameron] We're stuck in here!

322
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,150
We're with some real winners.

323
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,230
You know what I mean?

324
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,070
- [Maggie] Okay, somebody
really smells in here

325
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,230
and I'm not even gonna be
able to deal with that.

326
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,080
- [Chase] You better stop.

327
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,200
- [Maggie] I am not gonna
survive this.

328
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,220
How are you on the phone right
now?

329
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,090
- I spy with my little eye

330
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,000
a girl who's pretending to hate
someone.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,020
- Okay, okay.

332
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,150
- I spy with my little eye

333
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,210
someone who wants to die early.

334
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,040
(snickering)

335
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,120
Extra points if you figure
out how we can do him in.

336
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,020
(laughing)

337
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,180
- Do you even know who
you're dealing with?

338
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,070
We're all very important people
with important things to do.

339
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,170
- [Tristan] I will show
you how to kiss a girl.

340
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,040
- Well, some of us.

341
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,000
One of us.

342
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,140
They're gonna try to get us out
of here as fast as they can.

343
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,220
How hard is it to push a couple
of buttons

344
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,010
and get us out of here anyway?

345
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,040
(exasperated groaning)
- What?

346
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,110
I can't be stuck in here.

347
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,000
I have a deadline.

348
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,070
Good thing your job's a joke.

349
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,220
- I decide to leave the house
for the first time this week

350
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,010
and this is what happens.

351
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,020
(exasperated groaning)

352
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,020
- What are you missing out on,
Jeopardy?

353
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,220
Hey Chase, no school!

354
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,180
Sick!

355
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,220
- Oh come on.

356
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,070
What are you doing with this?

357
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,130
Soccer's in the fall.

358
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,100
- We've got year round now

359
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,170
or they lose us to the academy.

360
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,040
Go St. Magnus Stars.

361
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,100
- St. Magnus Brats.

362
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,180
That's all I need.

363
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,110
Oh and just throwing this out
there,

364
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,170
if you're not wearing
deodorant, get on it.

365
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,180
(exasperated groaning)

366
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,140
- Scary?

367
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,130
Go tigers!

368
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,140
- Tristan...

369
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,220
- [Maggie] Okay.

370
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,020
- This better not mean
we're missing the game.

371
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,120
- Nope, we're getting out of
here.

372
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,020
It'll be half an hour tops.

373
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,090
Don't worry guys.

374
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,070
(Nutcracker music)

375
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,010
- One hour later...

376
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,090
- Shut up Tristan.

377
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,180
(video game bleeps)

378
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,140
- [Grace] Seriously, a gold eye
ring?

379
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,200
(laughing)

380
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,140
- [Ethan] Here we are.

381
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,000
- Didn't find it?

382
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,210
- [Grace] So the things are good
right?

383
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,190
- Unbelievable.

384
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,160
You do not know how much hair

385
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,040
and lint, and dead skin is on
the ground.

386
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,220
This floor is filthy.

387
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,120
- OCD.

388
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,200
- Misophobia.

389
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,110
- You're doing homework now?

390
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,190
- Hey, back off.

391
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,140
What are you working on?

392
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,170
(soft dismissive grunt)

393
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,040
- Hello?

394
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,200
Anybody home?

395
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,110
Scary!

396
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,020
- Why do you call her scary?

397
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,080
- It's Scarlett.

398
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,070
Tristan just has a nickname for
everyone.

399
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,010
- Yeah, what's yours?

400
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,190
- I don't have one.

401
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,010
- Some friend.

402
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,210
(old man snoring)

403
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,030
- [Ethan] Stay in, stay
in, stay in, stay in.

404
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,110
(laughing)

405
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,180
- Hey um, honey, could you
spare a scrap of paper.

406
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,170
I'll pay you back.

407
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,130
- Hmm?

408
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,150
- Really?

409
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,010
What's the street value
of that, like two cents?

410
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,060
- I've gotta write my
article for Whimsy by 3:00.

411
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,010
Editors don't take excuses,

412
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,230
even if I am trapped with the
devil.

413
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,160
(cell phone ringing)

414
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,230
- Oh hey, yeah I'm gonna be a
while.

415
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,110
I'm stuck in traffic.

416
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,150
Yeah Ariel, I've been meaning to
tell you

417
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,160
how much you mean to me.

418
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
(playful music)

419
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,230
How supportive you are.

420
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,150
I was wondering if I could
thank you over dinner.

421
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,090
(cell phone dialing)

422
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,050
Yeah.

423
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,010
- Hey babe!

424
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,160
Could you do me a favor?

425
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,170
Could you take my pictures
from the Statin Island trip

426
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,090
and burn them?

427
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,110
They just bring up really
bad memories, you know?

428
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,090
You're my hero Ryan.

429
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,050
Love ya.

430
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,000
- What was that?

431
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,090
- Let me think.

432
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,030
What have I been holding
for the last half hour,

433
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,090
and makes a clinking sound when
it falls?

434
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,170
- It's a riddle.

435
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,040
- I've got it.

436
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,140
It's a collection of Matlock
DVDs.

437
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,140
- A squad of cheerleaders?

438
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,200
- Plastic?

439
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,100
Oh, maybe?

440
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,150
- No, it's a rescue squad,

441
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,090
come to save me from insanity.

442
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,100
- How about drugs?

443
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,060
You're familiar with these,
right?

444
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,140
- Yeah, we dope up everyday.

445
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,030
- You sit around in your room
playing video games everyday.

446
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,050
- Yep we're real busy
hacking government secrets.

447
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,070
- Okay, okay.

448
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,140
Alright everybody, we're
gonna make use of this space

449
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,020
a little bit more efficiently,
okay?

450
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,220
- [Bill] What?

451
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,180
- So just shift over.

452
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,140
Yeah you.

453
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,180
Yeah you soccer brat.

454
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,050
Kid with the hair.

455
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,080
(exasperated groaning)
Let's just move it on over.

456
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,090
Shift it over.

457
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,130
Shift it over.

458
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,010
C'mon just scoot over man.

459
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,080
Let's you know, I'm sick
of breathing your air.

460
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,090
Yeah, now everyone gets their
space.

461
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,120
We're all gonna get through this
alive.

462
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,020
Just everyone is gonna be okay.

463
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,150
Okay.

464
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,130
- You can't talk to her or you
won't?

465
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,120
In my day, a man went courting.

466
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,030
- I'm sorry, we don't
really know what girls are.

467
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,020
We can't afford a girl to nerf
our XP.

468
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,160
We're only six quests from
getting capped in Battle Realm.

469
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,220
- Spoiled too.

470
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,100
Do your parents let you
talk to them that way?

471
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,200
- I don't know, we don't talk.

472
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,050
- Oh, you're a poor
little rich boy, are you?

473
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,090
You're mad that they didn't
come to your baseball games,

474
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,030
never mind that they
paid thousands for them?

475
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,030
- Soccer, I play soccer.

476
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,000
- Kids...

477
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,220
Judgmental shadows,

478
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,090
whining about how you
did everything wrong,

479
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,050
and mad at you for being human.

480
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,140
You know, I was lucky to
get food on the table,

481
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,090
and it wasn't easy!

482
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,150
Yeah I yelled, and I made
mistakes but,

483
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,100
at least now they're grown
and adjusted you know?

484
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,200
Now that we don't talk anymore.

485
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,040
They'll understand what I did
for them

486
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,110
when their kids grow up, when
I'm dead.

487
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,160
Can't take the time to let
anyone in?

488
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,140
Every morning we ride
the elevator together.

489
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,080
We smile, avoid eyes.

490
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,000
Nobody takes the time to get to
know

491
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,210
the people we live with.

492
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,110
Nobody bothers to say hello.

493
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,120
- That'll get you murdered.

494
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,200
- Even worse, a date.

495
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,020
(laughing)

496
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,150
- I'm being punished.

497
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,040
No one else has a name in this
big old box besides Scary?

498
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,000
- Huh?

499
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,130
- [Bill] Nothing?

500
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,120
(playful music)

501
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,020
- Is this your box?

502
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,110
- [Maggie] Really, again?

503
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,150
(collective groaning and
commotion)

504
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,120
Really?

505
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,070
Okay...

506
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,180
Are you serious?

507
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,010
- Wake me when this is over.

508
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,030
- I'm Maggie.

509
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,140
- Maggie?

510
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,220
What kind of name is Maggie?

511
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,180
You should be Margaret.

512
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,100
I knew a Maggie once.

513
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,190
She embezzled thousand's from
a women's and orphan's fund

514
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,140
and gained 400 pounds in prison.

515
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,200
- Was that you?

516
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,180
(laughing)

517
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,220
- I'm Ethan, she's Grace.

518
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,080
- You know my name?

519
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,230
- You told me way back, when...

520
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,080
Wait, you don't remember?

521
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,040
Oh boy.

522
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,190
Just a great stalker I guess...

523
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,210
- Ethan, I thought your name was
Sammy.

524
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,150
- What, why?

525
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,060
- Well you're always talking
about playing a Sammy,

526
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,000
I just figured you were
talking about yourself

527
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
in third person.

528
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,080
- Sam's my twin.

529
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,040
- A twin?

530
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,000
- Mmhm.

531
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,210
- That makes so much sense.

532
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,020
I just always thought
we had the same schedule

533
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,120
but when we met up twice in one
hour

534
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,200
you came from a different
direction,

535
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,050
I just thought it was too
much of a coincidence.

536
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,070
I thought you were following
me.--

537
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,220
- No, no, no, I'm sorry.

538
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,000
Sam's a girl.

539
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,200
My twin is a sister.

540
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,220
(laughing)

541
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,070
really.

542
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,220
- Oh, so it is a coincidence
I see you all the time.

543
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,160
Oh, okay.

544
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,010
- Who are you texting?

545
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,060
Is it a girl?

546
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,050
You are such a loser.

547
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,180
Is it Andrea?

548
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,020
She thinks you're a jerk.

549
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,190
Hi, I'm Chase. I like girls!

550
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,210
- Leave me alone Tristan.

551
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,140
- So do you talk?

552
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,160
- Do you ever stop?

553
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,080
- Don't talk to Tristan.

554
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,010
He'll just insult you.

555
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,150
- Aw, I didn't hurt your
girlfriend's feelings,

556
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,090
did I Scary?

557
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,050
Scary!

558
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,140
Scary, do you have Lyme disease?

559
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,050
- Kid, you talk anymore and
I'm gonna rip off my shoe.

560
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,130
I'm not kidding around here.

561
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,160
- You like Star Trek, don't you?

562
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,170
I hear you, the theme music.

563
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,170
You live right below me.

564
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,120
- Sorry.

565
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,190
- Oh no, no.

566
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,230
It's actually great to dance to.

567
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,170
- Yeah, I can hear that too.

568
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,170
Don't worry, it's great to paint
to.

569
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,070
- You're an artist?

570
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,070
You talk about yourself in third
person.

571
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,080
Wait no, your twin.

572
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,040
You pull Sammy's and all
nighters.

573
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,210
You have bad hair days.

574
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,110
You like Star Trek,

575
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,190
and you get up on the roof
sometimes,

576
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,130
and you wear Fierce cologne.

577
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,030
I can stalk too.

578
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,230
- Sorry I doubted you.

579
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,090
- Why do you get up on the roof?

580
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,230
- Just pulling a Sammy.

581
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,050
(laughing)

582
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,010
You know, you can join me
whenever you feel like it.

583
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,210
(disgruntled groaning)

584
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,140
- Oh holy...

585
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,150
You're taking off your face!

586
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,080
- You're such a child.

587
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,110
As you discovered, I'm ancient.

588
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,160
I'm not about to wear
what I was born with.

589
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,170
Think my hair's really
this long little boy?

590
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,010
- Is there anything real about
you?

591
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,210
- Yes, she's as mean as she
looks.

592
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,110
(gagging)

593
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,230
- Do you have a cell phone
Scarlett?

594
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,050
I could call someone to let
them know that you're here,

595
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,040
or you could use mine.

596
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,140
- Why are you bothering?

597
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,040
- Who's she gonna call, her
parents?

598
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,200
They probably don't even own a
phone.

599
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,100
- At least they care about me.

600
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,190
You're a complete jerk.

601
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:48,230
No one likes you, not your
friends, not your mom!

602
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,010
Your dad won't see your games.

603
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,030
- I was beginning to wonder
if you were all there.

604
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,020
- Still am wondering if you are,
moron.

605
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,150
- You have nothing to do
but bother the neighbors?

606
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,060
If you're bored I'll let
you pluck my nostril hairs,

607
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,210
okay kid?

608
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,120
- They should've come for you us
by now.

609
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,220
- Maybe they're all dead.

610
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,070
Think about it.

611
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,170
Mysterious blackout, elevator's
stuck,

612
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,220
and no help for hours?

613
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,210
We get desperate enough

614
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,040
we shimmy up this elevator shaft

615
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,080
and find the place overrun by
zombies.

616
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,210
(chuckling)

617
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,170
- [Tristan] Jeez...

618
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,190
- Kidding.

619
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,190
I'm kidding.

620
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,120
- [Chase] Okay?

621
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,220
- I need a restroom.

622
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,220
- Yeah, I had a quart of
green smoothie for breakfast.

623
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,020
- Chase had a dozen donuts
and a quart of orange juice.

624
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,110
- I'm stiff.

625
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,020
- Are we almost to Grandma's
house yet?

626
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,100
- I am surrounded by insane
people.

627
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,060
- Hey, look what I brought, art!

628
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,070
We can all transcend the
physical world

629
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,090
and forget that we're all
stuck in an elevator together.

630
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,160
- [Maggie] What?

631
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,070
- What is this modern art crap?

632
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,080
- Go ahead, guess what you're
looking at.

633
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,150
It's supposed to reveal
something about your psyche.

634
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,080
- Oh great, your a new ageist.

635
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,070
- A what?

636
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,050
- A hippie.

637
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,160
- This one's called Darkness
Falls.

638
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,220
- Sounds like a bad breakup.

639
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,230
- Sounds like zombies.

640
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,000
I knew it was a zombie
day the moment I woke up.

641
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,220
It was quiet, the apartment was
empty,

642
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,170
to think I almost
escaped New York in time.

643
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,110
- You almost escaped?

644
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,230
- Is it a bear?

645
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,120
- What are you blind?

646
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,130
It's upside down.

647
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,090
It's a mass murder.

648
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,160
Look at all the blood.

649
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,180
- [Maggie] That's stupid.

650
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,040
- Someday we're gonna read
about how some crazed rich kid

651
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,180
did away with his entire
apartment complex.

652
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,140
- Hah, you're right.

653
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,230
Whatever that is, is dead.

654
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,140
- What was it?

655
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,020
- Nothing, I just spilled some
paint.

656
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,180
I didn't expect it to work so
well.

657
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,140
Here.

658
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,230
Let me show you a real one.

659
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,040
- I didn't inspire that, did I?

660
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,060
- You do get a little loud
sometimes.

661
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,230
- That makes me your muse.

662
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,020
You just use me for my body.

663
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,080
(laughing)

664
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,140
- [Chase] Whoa, Tristan,
what if he wakes up?

665
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,140
- [Grace] This is great.

666
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,080
- Dude, look at this.

667
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,200
- You do that one more time,
I'll kick you down the shaft.

668
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,170
- [Chase] Oh no, Tristan.

669
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,150
Tickle his feet with it too.

670
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,230
- Give it to me.

671
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,210
(gasping)

672
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,170
- Figures.

673
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,120
- What are you looking at?

674
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,100
- Pathetic.

675
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,000
I know I should've taken the
stairs.

676
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,040
(soft piano music)

677
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,020
I could've been asleep in my
lazy boy

678
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,000
in front of better shows than
this.

679
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,100
- Three hours later.

680
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,180
- [All] Shut up!

681
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,190
- Up, you can't end your
sentences with a preposition.

682
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,100
My dad would have a fit.

683
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,040
Shut up, your mouths.

684
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,020
- That's it!

685
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,200
This is not how I wanted
to spend my morning.

686
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,160
- [Maggie] And this is how
I wanted to spend mine?

687
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,230
- [Answering Machine] Hello,
please leave a message--

688
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,060
- An answering machine.

689
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,140
Hi, we want to get out of the
elevator.

690
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,130
Right everyone?

691
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:45,080
The children are hungry, and
annoying.

692
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,120
- I'm hungry.

693
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,220
- The old man needs to use the
bathroom.

694
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,110
The cake and the green
smoothie isn't tying you over?

695
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,070
- No.

696
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,220
- I had some grapes,

697
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,020
and Chase didn't even
share one donut with me.

698
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,030
- The kid is living off
grapes as his only sustenance.

699
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,050
- Tell them I have a deadline.

700
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,100
- Why haven't they come yet?

701
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,100
- Please sir, for the sake of
the children

702
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,160
and the dying kid and the
elderly.

703
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,050
- It is crucial I meet my
deadline.

704
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,030
My editor is not gonna believe
I got stuck in an elevator.

705
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,120
Tell--

706
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,230
- That should do it.

707
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,110
- Why didn't you tell
them I had a deadline?

708
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,140
Hello, can you see me?

709
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,100
I'm here.

710
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,210
- You know you're kind of a jerk
right?

711
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,010
- Great, great, just fantastic.

712
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,160
- I have food.

713
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,030
- [TRISTAN] Oh yes!

714
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,090
- That's a good idea.

715
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,090
Does anyone else have food?

716
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,130
Let's put it all together.

717
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,060
- [Grace] Take what you like.

718
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,130
- [Ethan] Okay, there should
be enough for everybody.

719
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,140
Nobody has to starve.

720
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,160
- [Tristan] Rumbly in my tumbly.

721
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,010
- [Ethan] Cannibalism is off the
table.

722
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,160
- What, you want some?

723
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,040
It's for the pain.

724
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,190
You know, we got a lot more in
common

725
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,010
than you like to think kid.

726
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,050
- Why because you think he pops
pills?

727
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,140
He's not that much of a loser.

728
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,180
You know, they drug test
us on the soccer team.

729
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,220
- Oh and you know everything
about your friend, huh?

730
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,150
- [Tristan] Food, it's food,
it's cool.

731
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,110
Give me that.

732
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,190
What do you got?

733
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,130
Oh yes!

734
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,160
It's just the corner.

735
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,230
Open it now, open it now!

736
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,090
- I have some water
bottles and granola bars.

737
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:30,090
- [Ethan] Only granola
bars, that's fine though.

738
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,110
- I have gum.

739
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,130
- [Cameron] Oh good, that's
helpful.

740
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,110
- Scarlett, do you have anything
to eat?

741
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,160
- No Chase, she gets one of
those free

742
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,190
welfare lunches that we pay for

743
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,220
through our hard earned taxes.

744
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,180
- [Bill] Hey...

745
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,160
- I'm fine!

746
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,080
- Hey, pork wagon!

747
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,100
- What?

748
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,070
- Share.

749
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,220
- Dude, you do not know how long

750
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,110
we are going to be in here.

751
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,070
- [Ethan] Stand-up guy.

752
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,030
- Wow.

753
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,050
Scary?

754
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,030
- Wait, is that Fuji?

755
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,110
I'll give you $100 for that.

756
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,070
- Really?

757
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,200
- $100?

758
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,070
That's a little excessive.

759
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,150
- Don't even think about it.

760
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,090
- Come on, it's $100.

761
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,030
Give her the granola bar
instead.

762
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,210
- Dude, you're hardcore.

763
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,030
You make me look sensitive.

764
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,050
- Psst, $100.

765
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,090
(playful music)

766
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,220
- Got anymore water?

767
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,100
- Take it easy,

768
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,080
because the more you take in,
the more pain you'll be in

769
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,230
with no bathroom.

770
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,140
(exasperated groaning)

771
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,010
What?

772
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,040
- Save your smart comments
until after we've eaten.

773
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,090
- How would that be helpful?

774
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,140
Where'd you get that?

775
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,160
- Oh this little thing?

776
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,110
The kid understands business.

777
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,190
- And you don't.

778
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,080
I like granola bars.

779
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,130
(laughing)

780
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,010
- Burn man, she gave away your
gift.

781
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,120
Oh, it's okay.

782
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,140
Don't be sad.

783
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:32,010
(cell phone buzzing)

784
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,060
- Hello?

785
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,040
Hi, Monica!

786
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,210
I know, I've run into a bit of
trouble.

787
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,130
I know, I know, the blackout.

788
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,120
Yeah, at least we have a
generator.

789
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,110
- You're just gonna drink?

790
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,130
You should eat something.

791
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,130
- No, I'm...

792
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,200
I had a really big breakfast.

793
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,030
- He's lying.

794
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,070
He's just sad because
Scary broke his heart.

795
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,130
- [Bill] Hey...

796
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,220
- [Cameron] I'd reassure
you everything is fine

797
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,010
if I could just be there.

798
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,010
- Hey Scary,

799
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,210
this is a gift from Chase.

800
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,130
It's to replace the old one.

801
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,100
- Why can't you just leave her
alone?

802
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,080
- Why can't you just leave her
alone?

803
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,050
It's a love letter.

804
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,070
Do you wanna know what it says.

805
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:21,230
I'll read it because you can't
read.

806
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,210
- Do you love Chase?

807
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,060
Circle yes, or circle no.

808
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,070
- [Maggie] Stop!

809
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,190
Stop it right now!

810
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,020
Get off of him!

811
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,100
- [Bill] It's a confined space!

812
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,060
- What is with you?

813
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,020
- [Maggie] Do something!

814
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,000
- [Bill] Let him go!

815
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,090
- [Maggie] Break it up.

816
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,100
- Would you keep it down?

817
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,080
- [Ethan] Stop.

818
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,050
- Hurry up and kill each other.

819
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,110
I'm on the phone.

820
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,210
- [Ethan] Okay let them
knock each other out.

821
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,180
- You call yourself a friend?

822
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,150
I hate you!

823
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,030
What do you keep me around for?

824
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,040
To laugh at your jokes?

825
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,100
Beat me down

826
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,090
when there's no one left
to be your punching bag?

827
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,100
- I'm in an elevator!

828
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,120
- Keep your enemies close.

829
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,190
Is that why you do it?

830
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,020
- Ethan, stop them.

831
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,220
- I can't breath with you
around.

832
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,210
- Him, grab him!

833
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,110
- I got it, I got it!

834
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,190
Let him go.

835
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,230
- Hello?

836
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,130
Hello?
- Let him go.

837
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,070
- Those punks just cost me
$150,000.

838
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:18,010
- If that bothers you,
don't become a parent.

839
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:22,050
(heavy breathing)
(somber music)

840
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,000
- You sit there.

841
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,030
You sit there.

842
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,000
Don't move.

843
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,160
Oh goodie.

844
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,000
- Stupid kids.

845
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:39,000
- Yeah weird, they make you look
smart.

846
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
- Excuse me?

847
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,010
- I can't believe we
have to put up with this.

848
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,100
So what, you're cursed with
coolness, huh?

849
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,080
No one can make a move
without you giving the okay,

850
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,160
is that it?

851
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,050
It's common enough with tweens.

852
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,200
Can't let anybody else be happy.

853
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,000
Poor little rich boy!

854
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,070
- Oh you're annoying me now, old
man.

855
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:04,100
- Oh your parents must be
real proud of you, huh?

856
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,130
This is what they brought into
the world,

857
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,190
a self-centered bully!

858
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,200
This is what they leave
behind of themselves?

859
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,040
- Well it hurts, doesn't it?

860
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,160
Everything they give out, I'm
gonna give it back harder.

861
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,140
- Don't give me the cats
and the cradle crap.

862
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,020
- Oh I'm sorry, was that
an old person's reference?

863
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,230
- Alright, you're doing this
to get back at your old man.

864
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,160
Fine, I get that.

865
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,150
You're gonna go skydiving
without a parachute,

866
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,190
and set yourself on fire.

867
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,150
(laughing)

868
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,090
but don't come complaining to me

869
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,070
when you turn out to be just
like him,

870
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,020
or worse, him!

871
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,200
He's just gonna turn into me,

872
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,020
and at the end,

873
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,200
you're gonna blame your
old man for everything.

874
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,210
You're gonna cry, wah,
wah, wah, all the way home.

875
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:48,010
And suck him of all his
money and hospital bills

876
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,100
and psychiatric fees,

877
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,190
while you write him letters
about how much he let you down.

878
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,190
But when he's dead and gone,

879
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:59,200
you won't have anyone
to blame but yourself.

880
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,180
(soft piano music)

881
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,110
- [Tristan] Are we through yet?

882
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,160
- [Bill] As far as you're
concerned, yeah.

883
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,100
I'm through with you.

884
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,210
(disgusted scoffing)

885
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,070
- I'll take that.

886
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,190
Boys are dumb, remember that.

887
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,200
- [SCARLETT] That was
interesting.

888
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,060
- Look, I'm only gonna
use this for a second.

889
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,020
Alrighty, little boy?

890
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,140
Only for a second.

891
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,040
Yes!

892
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
You've got internet.

893
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,000
3G huh?

894
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,210
I love you.

895
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,060
I'm gonna type this up
and send it to Deborah,

896
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,220
and it'll be like none
of this ever happened.

897
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,120
One bad, bad dream.

898
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,150
- You're moving, aren't you?

899
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,190
- Yes.

900
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,040
- Well whose gonna keep me awake
all night

901
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,210
with their dancing?

902
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,150
I mean, are you sure about this?

903
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,170
- Don't worry, someone else will
move in.

904
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,060
- Yeah but, I was used to you.

905
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,120
- You'll be happy, they
probably won't be dancers.

906
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,110
- I like dancers.

907
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,040
I mean, were you ever gonna tell
me?

908
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,120
(laughing)

909
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,140
So what was it?

910
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,220
The cockroaches?

911
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,070
Crazy stalkers?

912
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,120
Elevator keeps getting stuck?

913
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,180
(laughing)

914
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,180
I'm giving up on the dream.

915
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,120
I'm leaving New York.

916
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:00,170
I'm sorry, I actually
don't wanna talk about it.

917
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,030
- Are you sure you wanna do
that?

918
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,010
That's the girl's side.

919
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,170
- Scarlett I'm sorry.

920
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,230
- You're sorry?

921
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,210
- Look, Tristan's a jerk.

922
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,160
- Why do you hang out with him?

923
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,180
- Because I'm a jerk too,

924
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,040
and we have a lot of fun but,

925
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,200
you're right, yeah, you're
right.

926
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,090
We take it too far.

927
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:40,210
You're in my cooking class,
right?

928
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,100
- You never talk to me.

929
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,220
- Yeah.

930
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,200
- [Tristan] Oh my gosh.

931
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,030
- I like your ring.

932
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,170
It's really big.

933
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,200
And your shoes too.

934
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,190
You know, you look like
one of those skater chicks.

935
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,170
Do you long board?

936
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,130
- No.

937
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,040
- Oh, me neither.

938
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,140
I mean, I'm not that great.

939
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,100
(laughing)

940
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,030
- [Tristan] Oh man...

941
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,030
- He sucks.

942
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,140
He sucks at talking to girls.

943
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,230
That's why he didn't talk to
you.

944
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,120
- [Scarlett] What?

945
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,230
- [Ethan] Round two...

946
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,000
- Look, one time he waited an
entire year to talk to a girl,

947
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,120
in Kindergarten, and when he
finally did,

948
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,130
he spilled red paint all over
her.

949
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,120
It was a disaster.

950
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,030
- What?

951
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,100
- He didn't talk to you in
cooking class

952
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,120
because he...

953
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,010
Well, you're scary.

954
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:40,030
Wow, thanks Tristan, you can
stop now.

955
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,200
- Chase talks to a lot
of girl in cooking class.

956
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,120
- Yeah exactly, Scary.

957
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,140
That's how Scary you are.

958
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,160
- [Ethan] Unbelievable.

959
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,230
- Okay look, sorry.

960
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,160
- [Ethan] Are you serious?

961
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,160
- Excuse me?

962
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,230
- Look, I'm sorry I
make fun of you so much,

963
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:08,010
but you just make it so easy and
fun!

964
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,080
And it wasn't a love letter.

965
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,100
See look, it's us in an
elevator.

966
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,060
A little family photo.

967
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,170
Isn't it sweet?

968
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,060
- You drew a picture of everyone
in here?

969
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,170
You're terrible.

970
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,080
- Yeah but it's not bad
for stick figures, right?

971
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,120
- You're really messed up.

972
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,110
- And look, you're not the
only one with a nickname.

973
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:35,030
So you can't take it personally.

974
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,000
- You didn't!

975
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,180
- What do you have on me, kid?

976
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:45,010
What, you can't make fun
of me because I'm old?

977
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:45,210
- Are you kidding?

978
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,200
You'll beat me up.

979
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,120
- "Grumpy Old Man."

980
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,020
He got you alright.

981
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,190
- Good.

982
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,230
- Well this is a fun game.

983
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:59,180
Let's come up with a
nickname for you Tristy.

984
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,190
How about the Baby?

985
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,040
Our own little embryo.

986
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,000
- Yeah, I'm reserving
something real special for you.

987
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,150
- I vote man-child.

988
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,000
He hasn't grown up yet,

989
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,070
but he's wearing a cute
little suit for playtime.

990
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,030
- Done.

991
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,110
- [Grace] Yeah.

992
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:22,160
- What about Miss Playboy Bunny
over here,

993
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,190
Overdoes Her Makeup?

994
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,010
- [Grace] What?

995
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,000
- [Cameron] How about
you put her down as--

996
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,060
- It's too late.

997
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,040
She's already down as
My Cougar Girlfriend.

998
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,000
- Ew!

999
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,190
That's not much better.

1000
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:36,000
- And Jumpy Leg and New Ageist.

1001
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
- Jumpy Leg?

1002
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,190
Let's go fight some crime.

1003
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,160
(laughing)

1004
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,000
- Why am I so scary Tristan?

1005
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,180
- Well you're scary because...

1006
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,060
Because you're cute, and
you have a good voice.

1007
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,100
I mean, we've heard you sing.

1008
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,080
So, I think I'm done.

1009
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,140
Chase you can take it from here.

1010
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,130
- Thanks Tristan, you're really
good at talking to girls.

1011
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,180
- [Grace] Hey...

1012
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,230
- I mean, man,

1013
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,080
why don't I have a nickname?

1014
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,180
- The embryo's little shadow.

1015
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,070
- I thought I was the
workaholic.

1016
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:16,190
What are you working on?

1017
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,090
- My article on stupid men.

1018
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,140
- Really?

1019
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:24,010
- Yep, and I have plenty to say.

1020
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:28,000
- Ah yes, you are going to
have a great future with cats.

1021
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,160
- I'm not the crazy cat lover
around here.

1022
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,070
- [Chase] Oh why am I not
surprised?

1023
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,080
- Oh get out, you two dated?

1024
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,220
That's tough luck man.

1025
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,110
- Yeah, isn't that great?

1026
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:42,010
Now I'm the inspiration for
all the man hating articles

1027
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,090
she writes for a lame magazine.

1028
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:46,020
I'm what pays the bills.

1029
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,180
- You don't read my articles.

1030
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,000
- I never thought I'd be so
famous.

1031
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,170
- I don't write about you!

1032
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:54,190
Just because you do the
same stupid little things

1033
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,140
every stupid guy does,

1034
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,000
doesn't make you special.

1035
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,030
- So every guy loves the Red Sox

1036
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,140
even though he lives in New York

1037
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,190
and watches Smallville
reruns in his boxers?

1038
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,030
- [Maggie] Yeah!

1039
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,030
- So, where are you moving?

1040
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,200
- Back to Wisconsin.

1041
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,180
To a much smaller town.

1042
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,220
A place where I can talk to
people and I won't get killed.

1043
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,150
- Seriously, mass murders have
ruined

1044
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,090
small talk in the streets.

1045
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:28,150
(laughing)

1046
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:33,010
- Wouldn't it be nice to just
meet someone up at a corner

1047
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,080
and strike up a conversation?

1048
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,160
- Yeah but they're called
hookers, so...

1049
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,090
(soft piano music)

1050
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,140
- Seriously the population
here is in the millions

1051
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:49,050
and I can't even talk to just
one person.

1052
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,150
- What do you think we're doing?

1053
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,070
- Yeah, we're stuck in an
elevator.

1054
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,130
How often does that happen?

1055
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:01,000
I'm on the subway and I see this
guy

1056
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,140
and he smiles at me, and he
gets off on the next stop

1057
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,160
and I get off on another,

1058
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:09,040
and I think, was that the one?

1059
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,130
Was that the one I was supposed
to meet?

1060
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:15,130
And I couldn't even meet eyes
with him

1061
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:18,100
because I was afraid he was a
psychopath.

1062
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,080
- Well if love were as easy
as finding it on the subway

1063
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,040
we'd find it everyday.

1064
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,170
- And lose it every day.

1065
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,180
- Then you think to yourself,

1066
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,220
what if I just said hi?

1067
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,140
What if I just broke the bounds
of society

1068
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,050
and went over and talked to her?

1069
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:40,200
- How do you talk to
someone you don't know?

1070
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,180
- Pretend to know them.

1071
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,230
- Aren't you my sister's
mother's

1072
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:50,220
cousin's husband's roommate?

1073
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,120
(laughing)

1074
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,080
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

1075
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,160
- You never did that with me.

1076
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,220
Not pretty enough for you?

1077
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,110
- Too...

1078
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,120
Pretty.

1079
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,180
- [Chase] Tristan you're such an
idiot,

1080
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,140
you're the worst teacher ever.

1081
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,160
- Yeah you're right,

1082
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,180
if I heard that from a complete
stranger

1083
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:16,100
I'd think he was crazy.

1084
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,010
- [Tristan] No wonder
coach won't let you goalie.

1085
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,140
That's all you can do.

1086
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,150
(laughing)

1087
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,220
- Spineless!

1088
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,160
You're all spineless!

1089
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,210
I met my wife in Central Park.

1090
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:30,150
She was the daughter
of a political big wig.

1091
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,000
I was a nobody.

1092
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,080
We were from different worlds.

1093
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,140
The odds of us even having
a conversation were nil,

1094
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,000
but you know what I did?

1095
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,100
I asked her where she bought her
scarf.

1096
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,100
Like I care about a scarf?

1097
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:46,000
The worse she could've done was
slap me.

1098
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,120
(laughing)

1099
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,120
- So Cougar,

1100
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,060
that's quite a long second
there.

1101
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,160
Are you ever going to
give me back my laptop?

1102
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,200
Yeah here, you can play with my
purse.

1103
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,090
Don't get into too much trouble.

1104
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,060
- Seriously, how old do you
think I am?

1105
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,020
- I don't really care.

1106
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,160
- That's my cougar.

1107
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,180
- Go for it kid.

1108
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,140
Not even you could handle her.

1109
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,200
(laughing)

1110
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,060
- Hey over here.

1111
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,050
I always wanted to know what was
in this.

1112
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,170
- Don't get too excited.

1113
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,210
There's nothing incriminating.

1114
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:23,010
My murder weapons are in my
other bag.

1115
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:25,040
- What's this?

1116
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,100
- Give it here!

1117
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,200
- It's poetry.

1118
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,020
Sitting in my tree house

1119
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,150
breathing in the putrid air

1120
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:34,010
in the city of sand paper.

1121
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,160
- You can stop reading that now!

1122
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,040
- I didn't know you wrote
poetry.

1123
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,210
- There's a lot you don't know
about me.

1124
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,090
- So how long did you guys
date before you broke up?

1125
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,100
- Too long, and the
breakup was even worse.

1126
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:49,080
Learn from me, don't date
a girl close to home.

1127
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,120
- So let me get this straight,

1128
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,060
you don't want a smoking hot
girlfriend,

1129
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,120
that works for a famous
magazine,

1130
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,050
and makes tons of money?

1131
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,060
- You'll understand when you're
older.

1132
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,150
- Maybe when I'm senile and
stupid.

1133
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,130
- It's one of those
ironies of life I guess.

1134
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,090
You're too young to keep a woman
happy,

1135
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:08,070
and I'm too old for a woman
like that to keep me happy.

1136
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,060
- You're all selfish
little brats in diapers.

1137
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,220
You're not willing to work at
anything.

1138
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:15,000
You don't know what love is!

1139
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,020
- Well I've never had it.

1140
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,060
- Well I have, it's great.

1141
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,060
You should try it sometime.

1142
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,120
- You know what?

1143
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,210
I don't wanna hear about
your past girlfriends.

1144
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:27,130
We're not going out anymore.

1145
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,110
- And I don't wanna hear
about your romantic ideals.

1146
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,120
What, did you fall asleep

1147
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,100
to Sleepless in Seattle last
night?

1148
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,220
Or was it Pride and Prejudice?

1149
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:37,070
Let me guess, you've just
discovered Bollywood romances?

1150
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,210
- [Ethan] Oh man...

1151
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,030
- Such a cheesy romantic.

1152
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,140
- Oh, she broke up with you
didn't she?

1153
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,200
(laughing)

1154
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:51,220
- Okay now that we're
done insulting each other.

1155
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,010
- [Maggie] A children's story?

1156
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,030
- Where'd you get that?

1157
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:00,200
- I always keep children's
books in my bag.

1158
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,180
- Really?

1159
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,220
- Listen up children

1160
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,130
and I'm going to tell you a
story.

1161
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,070
- There aren't any words.

1162
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,140
- Really?

1163
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,160
We'll just have to make some up
then.

1164
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,190
(coughing)

1165
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,090
- Hey!

1166
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,090
Are you paying for that?

1167
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:27,030
- Man you have some
heavy artillery in here.

1168
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,210
I don't even know what
half of this stuff is.

1169
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,140
Give me your face Scary.

1170
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,170
- Don't do you dare call me
Scary.

1171
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,170
- What am I supposed to call
you?

1172
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:38,020
- Scarlett, maybe.

1173
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,120
It seems obvious.

1174
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:43,230
- No, don't.

1175
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,150
Uh, Scarlett looks pretty
without it.

1176
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,140
- Check this.

1177
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,000
I found your color, Scarlett.

1178
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,130
Make over.

1179
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,170
Here.

1180
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,220
- Relax this is gonna hurt you a
lot more

1181
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,020
than it's gonna hurt me...

1182
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,010
- [Tristan] You're doing it
wrong.

1183
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,060
Give it to me.

1184
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,030
Your fingers are too fat.
- No, I got it!

1185
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:03,200
- [Tristan] Chase, you can't--

1186
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,180
- I got it.

1187
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:11,000
- [Ethan] I really hope that
it happens just like you say.

1188
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,130
(laughing)

1189
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,140
But the dragon started to fly
around.

1190
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,010
- Hey!

1191
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,040
Keep it to light colors.

1192
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,160
It's in the middle of the day.

1193
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,110
- Boring.

1194
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,130
- So why don't you ever come to
my...

1195
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:27,090
The games?

1196
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,200
- My dad, he doesn't like me
to...

1197
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:35,230
He doesn't want me to go alone.

1198
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:38,010
- Why would you go alone?

1199
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,090
I'll be there.

1200
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,190
- Yeah, you're playing idiot.

1201
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:49,030
- My parents usually need a
babysitter Friday nights anyway.

1202
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,020
- But they have to let you out
sometime.

1203
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:55,110
I mean, your dad can't be
that protective, right?

1204
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,070
- I don't know, I've seen him.

1205
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,110
He's huge.

1206
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:00,210
I mean, didn't he kill somebody
one time?

1207
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,050
- Well, that was in self
defense,

1208
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:08,160
and besides, bar fights don't
count.

1209
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,000
- Why, why don't they count?

1210
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,210
- Yeah but he still did jail
time for that, didn't he?

1211
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:18,010
- Yeah but, now he's too
smart to get caught, you know?

1212
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,140
(horror movie screech)

1213
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,220
- You jerk!
(laughing)

1214
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,040
Scarlett, how could you help
him?

1215
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,030
- Ew gross, you're grounded from
my purse!

1216
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,150
- Do you have this in black?

1217
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:29,170
- Creepy kid.

1218
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:33,110
Why the nice act all of a sudden
huh?

1219
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,140
- The puppy was really strong...

1220
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:37,040
- You want something don't you?

1221
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,060
I can hear your thoughts

1222
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,140
almost as loudly as my own
breathing.

1223
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,230
- Oh you're still breathing?

1224
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:44,180
I thought you were so old you
were dead.

1225
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,100
How's that for nice?

1226
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,030
- Well it's a start.

1227
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,210
- So is this makeup gonna do
it for the next few years or...

1228
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:04,230
Are we going for surgery?

1229
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,070
- You can never be too careful.

1230
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:09,230
I mean, 10 years you could be
looking like

1231
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:12,100
Grumpy Old Man over there.

1232
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,150
- 20.

1233
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,170
- 15.

1234
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,040
- What?

1235
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,190
50!

1236
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:21,010
- I may be old but I'm not deaf.

1237
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,200
Anybody else brings up how old I
am,

1238
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,130
I'm gonna fake a heart attack
right here.

1239
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,090
- Sorry.

1240
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,200
- You look better without it.

1241
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,020
- You've never seen me without
it.

1242
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,000
- When we first met

1243
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,220
(soft piano music)

1244
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:37,130
at the U2 concert in the park.

1245
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:40,050
We got caught in the rainstorm.

1246
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,220
You ran through this fountain.

1247
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:45,010
All this water rushing down your
face.

1248
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:49,120
You didn't care what you looked
like.

1249
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,070
- No one could see me.

1250
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:56,090
- I did.

1251
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,000
- [Ethan] Gold and, make up--

1252
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,200
- Make up?

1253
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:05,210
Make up?

1254
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,100
You're crazy.

1255
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,050
- So then the dragon went to
his cave and took with him

1256
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:13,150
his favorite--

1257
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:16,000
- I thought you said he was a
dinosaur.

1258
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,200
- Yes...

1259
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,160
- So why is he blowing smoke?

1260
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,200
- Because it is the ice
age and a volcano got him.

1261
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:32,150
So, the dragon invited
the dainty little dinosaur

1262
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,070
into his cave and...

1263
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,060
Then she didn't have to move
away

1264
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,160
and they lived happily ever
after.

1265
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,120
The end.

1266
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,080
- Where'd you get that?

1267
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,030
- Just made it up.

1268
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,200
- No, I meant the book.

1269
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,140
- Oh it's um...

1270
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,020
It is a present.

1271
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:50,220
See?

1272
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:56,120
- Is it me or are children's
books getting weirder?

1273
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,080
(laughing)

1274
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,140
- No, it's just that one.

1275
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,020
I mean, I illustrated it,

1276
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:04,010
but it's kind of just a small
thing.

1277
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:07,010
- No you didn't!

1278
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:09,170
I'm so sorry.

1279
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:11,170
- No it pays the bills.

1280
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:16,190
I actually prefer drawing
people, caricatures.

1281
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,140
I think it tells a better story.

1282
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,100
- Oh no.

1283
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:22,070
I had one of those one time.

1284
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,190
This guy in the park,

1285
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:27,000
he stretched out my neck like a
giraffe.

1286
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,060
He took my worst feature
and he attacked it.

1287
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,180
- Who says that's your worst
feature?

1288
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,030
- There's something worse than
my neck?

1289
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:37,060
- There is nothing I can
say to make that sound good!

1290
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,040
(laughing)

1291
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,160
But that's what I love about
art.

1292
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,120
It...

1293
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,200
Finds the details that
nobody else notices.

1294
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,160
Here,

1295
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,150
I saw them

1296
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:55,090
on the subway.

1297
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:57,170
- [Grace] Who are they?

1298
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:59,090
- I don't know them.

1299
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:02,170
Sometimes it's better that way,
you know?

1300
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:04,210
Nobody can disappoint you.

1301
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,170
Something about them...

1302
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:14,190
The happiness in their
eyes, the way they talked.

1303
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,190
You know, it's what I love best
about art

1304
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,050
is capturing a moment in time

1305
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,020
that you can't bring with you.

1306
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,000
Life is full of goodbyes

1307
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,100
but here on the page, nothing
leaves.

1308
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,080
Affection in the eyes dulls to
boredom,

1309
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:37,030
but here is a memory
from when we were happy.

1310
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,020
People live their own lives,

1311
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,220
they grow up, they go
their own ways, but here

1312
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:49,060
they can always be a part of
you.

1313
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:53,060
- So do you draw out of
happiness or loneliness?

1314
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:57,210
- Both, there's no other way to
create.

1315
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,060
- So this is how you let people
go?

1316
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,220
Capture a moment to say goodbye?

1317
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,170
It's never gonna be real.

1318
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,170
- It's as real as it's gonna
get.

1319
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:20,120
♪ As real as it's gonna get

1320
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,020
- You're hired.

1321
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,010
I want you to sing at my
funeral.

1322
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,130
- Don't.

1323
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:27,110
Don't talk about dying.

1324
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,010
(exasperated sighing)

1325
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,140
- This isn't working.

1326
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:36,040
This is exactly like my June
article, How to Spot a Player.

1327
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,160
- Oh June, good month.

1328
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,060
That's when we broke up, wasn't
it?

1329
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,150
Maybe I should take you on a
date

1330
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:43,210
and you can clear your writer's
block.

1331
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,210
- Maybe!

1332
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,060
- Why don't you just write about

1333
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:47,140
your adventures in the elevator?

1334
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:50,100
- Oh because everyone
wants to read about that?

1335
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,060
- It would be better than
what you dig up on me.

1336
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,140
You can write about how the
floor is covered in lint

1337
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:58,090
and dead skin, and fingernails,

1338
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:00,170
and how we're all stuck in
here with our best friends,

1339
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:03,230
our worst enemies, and
the strangest of strangers

1340
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,090
and how we all won't get out of
here

1341
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:07,160
until we learn some kind of
lesson.

1342
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,120
Here...

1343
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,060
Come on cougar.

1344
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,120
Everyone's got a story to tell.

1345
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,160
Trust me, we'll make
Breakfast Club in an elevator.

1346
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,060
Old person reference.

1347
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:22,060
You wouldn't understand.

1348
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:25,080
- I know.

1349
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:29,120
Write about the one thing
that really scares you.

1350
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,160
- I think the old man hit it
right on.

1351
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,150
- Don't worry, you'll
never be the man I am.

1352
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,160
- How about it kid?

1353
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,180
What scares you the most

1354
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:41,000
about being stuck in this
elevator?

1355
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,220
- Yeah bad idea.

1356
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:45,110
Let's not talk about that.

1357
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:47,200
- Or maybe we can a do a
day in the life of story?

1358
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,150
Anyone famous in here?

1359
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:53,030
Any important jobs?

1360
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:56,070
No Cam sorry, you don't have
one.

1361
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,110
- Good, great.

1362
01:05:57,110 --> 01:06:00,070
You can write about someone else
for once.

1363
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:02,190
- How about a real love story?

1364
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,000
- Okay.

1365
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,200
(soft piano music)

1366
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,120
- She was the grumpy one.

1367
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,110
I was the cheerful one.

1368
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:29,000
We fought, we loved, we did our
own thing.

1369
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:34,090
She had her friends.

1370
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:38,010
I went to work.

1371
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,200
But the kids hung on her every
word.

1372
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:50,070
We had it all you know?

1373
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,110
(sniffling)

1374
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:58,110
And then after she died.

1375
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:02,130
Well I, I lost some money.

1376
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:10,000
The house, you know?

1377
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,200
I had to move from the
house to the apartment.

1378
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:18,090
The kids drifted away.

1379
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:25,080
You can't really blame them you
know?

1380
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:29,160
There's nothing to hold them
there.

1381
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,230
No money, no mother, just...

1382
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,080
A dark shadow hanging over the
place.

1383
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:52,170
I can't even hold a decent
conversation anymore.

1384
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:02,050
You know, the funny thing is

1385
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,060
I inherited her friends.

1386
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,230
There are worse things than
death.

1387
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:11,190
- Mmhm.

1388
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:20,010
- They're just gonna come to my
funeral.

1389
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:23,010
My kids, if I keep them in the
will.

1390
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,150
It won't be long now.

1391
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:32,170
- That's your love story?

1392
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,080
That sucks.

1393
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:45,150
You're not dead yet,
so stop acting like it.

1394
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:47,150
You ever call your kids?

1395
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,140
I didn't think so.

1396
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:55,060
(sniffling)

1397
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:58,070
My dad's already planning his
funeral.

1398
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:00,170
He's got his coffin picked out.

1399
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,050
A PowerPoint put together
with these pictures

1400
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:05,010
and a bunch of cheesy songs on
it.

1401
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:10,170
Says he's gonna make us all cry.

1402
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:13,000
Like it's some sort of joke.

1403
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,130
You are not dead yet.

1404
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:19,130
There are people here that need
you!

1405
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,180
No big deal, people die every
day.

1406
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:30,170
- But not your dad.

1407
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,190
I'm sorry.

1408
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:36,150
- I don't even talk to him
anymore.

1409
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:37,230
Before I left this morning

1410
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:39,080
I sat outside of his room
for like five minutes

1411
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,040
and didn't even say goodbye,
so...

1412
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:46,030
I mean, what if he died today?

1413
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:56,100
So I guess I'm not too broken up
about it.

1414
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,020
- [Bill] People died
on my operating table.

1415
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,080
- Hold on, you're a doctor?

1416
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,220
- What, just because I'm old and
grumpy

1417
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:04,170
I can't be useful for anything?

1418
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:05,130
- No.

1419
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,090
- I'm messing with you.

1420
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:08,160
Yeah, I'm a doctor.

1421
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,220
There's nothing wrong with
death, okay?

1422
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:15,150
It's the ones that are left
behind.

1423
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:18,070
Telling families that their
loved ones didn't make it,

1424
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:20,070
that's worse than death.

1425
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:25,220
That's why the idiot
interns always get the job,

1426
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,050
but when it's unexpected,

1427
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,170
well, we all live with regrets
you know?

1428
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:39,000
We never get the time to make
our peace

1429
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:42,110
or to apologize.

1430
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,080
or just let them know.

1431
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,110
Most people would give anything

1432
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:53,010
to be able to talk to the dead.

1433
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,050
So take your chance and do it,
kid.

1434
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:03,130
Your dad wouldn't want
you to die with him.

1435
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,060
- What about your wife?

1436
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,060
Isn't that what you did.

1437
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:11,230
- I'm old.

1438
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:16,200
I would die with her a million
times.

1439
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,100
(sniffling)

1440
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,030
- I'd look in on your family
Tristan

1441
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,180
and make sure they're alright,

1442
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,180
if you left for college.

1443
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:33,230
- Thanks Scarlett.

1444
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:36,170
- But you don't write
about death, do you Mags?

1445
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:39,210
No you write about how stupid
men are.

1446
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,200
- Oh I talk about death.

1447
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:46,150
Love is dead.

1448
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:51,170
Where are the gentlemen

1449
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:54,230
who stick with you and don't get
bored?

1450
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,020
What happened to the
men in the fairy tales

1451
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,140
who protected you?

1452
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:05,060
- You've watched too many chick
flicks.

1453
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:08,060
- Just have low expectations,
right?

1454
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:12,160
That way you're never
disappointed.

1455
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:17,000
Yeah, movies messed this girl
up.

1456
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:24,080
- Remember the go after your
dreams movies of the 80s?

1457
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,200
Never give up, be the best?

1458
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:32,200
You can do anything if
you try hard enough?

1459
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,200
I shouldn't have listened.

1460
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:43,030
Being the best never made me
happy.

1461
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,210
It just pushed everyone away.

1462
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,020
The stars have it bad.

1463
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,060
Marilyn Monroe,

1464
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,200
very successful, very unhappy.

1465
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,150
- Very hot.

1466
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,020
- Go after your dreams,

1467
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:15,230
but what if your dreams hurt
you?

1468
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:20,020
Sometimes I wish I just
got in a car accident

1469
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,130
and broken my leg

1470
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:25,030
and then none of this would have
happened.

1471
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:27,010
- Then you'd be normal.

1472
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:30,040
- What is normal?

1473
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:33,130
Having a family, kids,

1474
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:39,190
reading a book on a cool
day and going to the beach?

1475
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:41,190
Yeah, I want that.

1476
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,130
- Why can't you?

1477
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,150
- You're an artist Ethan.

1478
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:52,190
Didn't you make sacrifices
to get where you're at?

1479
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,160
- I wish I knew my neighbors
better.

1480
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,120
- Grow up!

1481
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:06,010
You give up too fast.

1482
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:10,010
Life is full of sacrifices
to get what you want.

1483
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,170
- That's what my parents told me

1484
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:15,030
when we had to move out here.

1485
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,060
We left our family, and our
friends,

1486
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:22,100
and our house just so my
dad could get a job here.

1487
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,050
Now we never see him.

1488
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,130
Mom wants a divorce,

1489
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:34,130
and everyone hates me at school,

1490
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:35,190
even the girls.

1491
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,030
- Well of course they hate you.

1492
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:43,200
You're prettier than all of
them.

1493
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,080
They're jealous.

1494
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,160
(chuckling)

1495
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,020
Sorry, that was something

1496
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,160
I heard my mom say to my sister
once.

1497
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,050
Sorry...

1498
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:59,220
- You're not looking too good
there kid.

1499
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:03,070
Is there something you're not
telling us?

1500
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:08,160
- Mags, you're the writer here.

1501
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,060
Do what you do.

1502
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,080
Give it all meaning.

1503
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,040
- I can't.

1504
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,040
- Get that deep?

1505
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:21,010
- I can't write with you sitting
there

1506
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:25,060
when all I can think about
is how mad I am at you!

1507
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,010
- You're mad?

1508
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:30,150
Alright Maggie, let's have it
out!

1509
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,190
What will it be?

1510
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:33,010
This, your pen?

1511
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:36,210
I know, let's talk about why we
broke up.

1512
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:37,220
- Whoa, right now?

1513
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:40,050
I mean, nobody wants to hear
that.

1514
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,090
- Who's Ariel?

1515
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,050
- [Ethan] Seriously?

1516
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:46,090
- The one you were
talking to on the phone?

1517
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:48,220
The girl who's beautiful face
you miss?

1518
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,050
- No one.

1519
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,100
She's--

1520
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,020
- Don't bother talking
if you're gonna lie.

1521
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,120
- You wanna know?

1522
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,210
- Okay.

1523
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,130
- No, don't tell me.

1524
01:15:58,130 --> 01:15:59,180
Tell me!

1525
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,140
No,

1526
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:02,110
don't.

1527
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:04,100
- I wasn't planning on it.

1528
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,140
- [Ethan] Oh please.

1529
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,140
- You never wanted to be with
me, ever.

1530
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,000
Admit it.

1531
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,220
- Who was Ryan?

1532
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:15,080
The guy that you told to throw
out all our old pictures?

1533
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,200
Yeah, I loved our trip to
Statin Island by the way.

1534
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,200
You can't just throw that stuff
out.

1535
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,000
- Ryan...

1536
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,090
(soft piano music)
Is my answering machine.

1537
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:31,070
I wasn't talking to anyone
on the phone, happy?

1538
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,100
- Ariel's my niece.

1539
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:38,070
- Oh...

1540
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:40,030
- Oh.

1541
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:42,170
- Well what was it then?

1542
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:45,210
Was I too smart, too stupid, too
nice?

1543
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,080
Well I tried to be nice
and then you dumped me.

1544
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,220
- I dumped you?

1545
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,120
You broke up with me!

1546
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,050
Yes you did, you said you wanted
to talk!

1547
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,190
- I did wanna talk.

1548
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:59,140
- Well we sure did that.

1549
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:00,110
We talked alright.

1550
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:03,010
I never wanna talk again.

1551
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:05,010
You said you can't be happy.

1552
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:07,130
You blame me because you
don't wanna blame yourself.

1553
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:09,220
You know, you hide under all
this sarcasm,

1554
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:12,070
but take away the heels
and the power jacket,

1555
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:15,150
and you're just a lost little
girl!

1556
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:17,200
- You're just a bully

1557
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,110
who wants to shove me in the
mud.

1558
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:22,120
- Why do you care?

1559
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,090
I'm just a stupid guy.

1560
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:25,110
I can't hurt you.

1561
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:28,130
I can't possibly mean that much
to you!

1562
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,050
Maggie?

1563
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:38,110
- Give me that.

1564
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,020
(answering machine beeping)

1565
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:55,060
- Get us out of here.

1566
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:58,030
We're going to drill a hole
through the elevator floor

1567
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:00,050
if you don't do something about
us.

1568
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,160
- I really need a bathroom.

1569
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,120
- Me too.

1570
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:06,010
- Well quit drinking so much.

1571
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:07,050
- I'm thirsty.

1572
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,170
- You hear that?

1573
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:12,140
Get to us before you have to
mop up an even bigger mess.

1574
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:14,020
- Why aren't they coming?

1575
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,030
- I don't know.

1576
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:18,070
All of New York has a problem.

1577
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:21,050
Maybe it's a setup and
they're trying to kill us.

1578
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:22,170
- Well maybe the last guy you
talked to

1579
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:24,040
had a heart attack and died.

1580
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,050
- [Cameron] Maybe the last
guy I talked to was a Nazi.

1581
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:29,000
- Maybe everybody out there's a
zombie.

1582
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,030
- Zombies again.

1583
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:32,050
Is that camera busted?

1584
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:35,020
You'd think they'd at least see
us.

1585
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:37,130
Hey kid, if you're gonna make
your move

1586
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:39,010
you better make it snappy.

1587
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:42,160
You're about to lose anything
close to a romantic mood.

1588
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:05,040
- Give me your number.

1589
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,000
(soft piano music)

1590
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,020
You want people in your life

1591
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,180
but you're afraid to go and talk
to them.

1592
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:13,170
Well we're stuck in this big
box,

1593
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:15,110
so let's do it already.

1594
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:16,170
Get to know me.

1595
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:23,050
Would you rather

1596
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:26,110
get in a bath filled with razor
blades,

1597
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:31,190
or have a million paper
cuts all over your body?

1598
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,030
Sorry, a little dark.

1599
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:37,090
(laughing)

1600
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:42,100
- Is there lemon juice involved?

1601
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,060
- No.

1602
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,170
- Paper cuts.

1603
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:53,100
Would you rather

1604
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,150
chew two bags of pink
bubble gum in one hour

1605
01:19:56,150 --> 01:20:01,000
or stuff 13 giant
marshmallows in your mouth

1606
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
and have them disintegrate
down your throat

1607
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,040
for the next half an hour?

1608
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:09,110
- Two packs of bubble
gum, if I had some tums.

1609
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:10,070
- No tums.

1610
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:14,020
- That is still my final answer.

1611
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:14,220
- Lame.

1612
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:17,050
(laughing)

1613
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:22,090
- Would you rather go home
to boring old Wisconsin

1614
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:25,090
or stay in the big bad city with
me?

1615
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:30,110
- Is there dancing involved?

1616
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:33,110
- Everywhere you go there's
dancing.

1617
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:38,230
Or are you afraid we're
gonna be them in two years?

1618
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:48,000
(cell phone beeping)

1619
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:53,050
- I give it six months.

1620
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,140
- How, if you're not here?

1621
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,170
- Stay away from my neck.

1622
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,190
- I will try.

1623
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:21,080
(Christmas bells ringing)

1624
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,090
- What's the matter boy?

1625
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:26,220
Don't they take you to the gym?

1626
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:31,010
Don't they let you out
of the office here boy?

1627
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:32,000
- I am so sorry.

1628
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,130
- Wimp.

1629
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:35,210
Back when dinosaurs roamed the
Earth,

1630
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:39,020
it was a man that asked for
the commitment, not the woman.

1631
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,100
- [Cameron] Get off it Bill.

1632
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,140
Just because you're old

1633
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,090
doesn't mean you can say what
you want.

1634
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:44,130
- Yes it does.

1635
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:48,020
- Man I'd love to set
you loose on my dad Bill.

1636
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,170
If he had half your guts.

1637
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,140
- Finally figured out he's
human, huh?

1638
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:55,060
Yeah, kids never forgive
their parents for that.

1639
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:56,100
- See, guts.

1640
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,040
(laptop beeping)

1641
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,160
- No...

1642
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:04,110
The battery died!

1643
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,070
It didn't warn!

1644
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,110
Tristan fix your computer!

1645
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:07,130
- Let me see.

1646
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:11,050
Take a deep breath.

1647
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:12,110
- This can't be happening.

1648
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:14,110
If I don't get this into
my editor, I'm fired!

1649
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:16,050
- Can we text it to your
editor's email?

1650
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:18,070
- Text this whole thing?

1651
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:19,030
No!

1652
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,080
- Give it here.

1653
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,100
We'll text it.

1654
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,210
There's no possible way you can
do that.

1655
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:28,090
- Actually, we kind of can.

1656
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:30,030
It's what we do.

1657
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:32,160
Wait, Scarlett do you have a
phone?

1658
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,180
- Of course she has a phone.

1659
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:36,010
I was being a jerk.

1660
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,010
Come on cougar, hand it over.

1661
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:38,020
Let's see those notes.

1662
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:40,050
- Ignore the cross outs.

1663
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:44,090
Don't save my editor's number
in your phone or you're dead.

1664
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:47,060
- What is this, a foreign
language or something?

1665
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,090
What, is it code?

1666
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,210
- Give it to me.

1667
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:51,180
I can read her handwriting.

1668
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,140
- You can?

1669
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,070
- Sitting on the elevator floor
gives me a new perspective.

1670
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:04,080
First you see a nail,
some lint, some dead skin.

1671
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,010
(soft piano music)

1672
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:11,050
The nail is chipped, pink nail
polish.

1673
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,050
Maybe it belonged to a chronic
nail biter.

1674
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:17,070
Maybe she stood nervously

1675
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:21,130
next to a guy she couldn't talk
to.

1676
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:26,070
We pushed the same buttons
to reach the same floors.

1677
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:28,200
We shared the same space,

1678
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,110
but I could never pick
them up from a line up.

1679
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,130
- Huh, weird.

1680
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,190
I never knew that they were my
neighbors.

1681
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:40,090
I don't think I knew
what a neighbor meant.

1682
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:51,150
- I'll get it.

1683
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,220
- Sorry I can't help.

1684
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:12,190
- If you need it.

1685
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:20,170
(heavy breathing)

1686
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,120
- You too?

1687
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:02,030
- You gonna text a whole
article?

1688
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,100
I can't even get my TV to work.

1689
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,050
- Don't get soft on me now Bill.

1690
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:09,010
You don't wanna disappoint me do
you?

1691
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,180
- Can't even wish the kids a
good morning

1692
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:12,080
without them getting suspicious.

1693
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:16,090
My wife though, she's the
only thing I did right.

1694
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:21,000
The kids hung onto every word.

1695
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:25,110
Maybe I shouldn't have
been so hard on them.

1696
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:27,090
- Why, because they don't visit?

1697
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:28,150
They're losers.

1698
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:31,140
I'd visit you.

1699
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,160
(laughing)

1700
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,170
- I was wrong about you.

1701
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,130
I think...

1702
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,120
- You wanna make a bet?

1703
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,190
- What?

1704
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:46,200
- As soon as they finish
texting that article

1705
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,000
we're getting out of here.

1706
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,020
- Well it's a zombie day so
as soon as we get out of here,

1707
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:54,000
we're dead.

1708
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:04,190
- A goodbye present.

1709
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,110
- My hair's not pulled back

1710
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:16,030
and I'm not wearing that shirt.

1711
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:17,150
- That was the first time

1712
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:20,210
that I met the girl behind the
shoes.

1713
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:23,040
It was the end of a long day.

1714
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:26,050
You were going up 22 stories.

1715
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:28,220
You had that smile that you
have,

1716
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,220
with the lip curling up.

1717
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:36,010
Your ballet shoes were tucked in
your bag

1718
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:40,050
and I knew that you were
the girl dancing above me.

1719
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,080
Grace, don't dance for them.

1720
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:51,200
Do it for yourself.

1721
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:55,040
It's the only way you're gonna
be happy.

1722
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:59,140
- You've captured the girl with
the shoes.

1723
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:02,180
You stole her soul.

1724
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:06,220
Now that you have this, you
won't need her anymore will you?

1725
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:10,080
(cell phone ringing)

1726
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,230
Go ahead.

1727
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:19,030
I'll just wait right here.

1728
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:27,060
- Hey baby...

1729
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,120
No, I didn't forget your party.

1730
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,140
I'm sorry but I love you.

1731
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:36,110
Oh um hey, actually...

1732
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:40,060
There are a bunch of good people
here

1733
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:43,230
who would like to wish you
a merry Christmas, uh huh.

1734
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:45,030
Yeah, hold on.

1735
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:50,040
Can you guys sing We Wish You
A Merry Christmas to Sarah?

1736
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,220
I missed her Christmas party.

1737
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:53,040
Would you mind?

1738
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:57,210
♪ We wish you a merry Christmas

1739
01:27:57,210 --> 01:28:00,050

01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,100
- Hey, yeah.

1747
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:25,130
So...

1748
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:30,130
- Planning on running a
marathon?

1749
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:31,090
Your leg.

1750
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,050
- [Ethan] Yeah, so who's there?

1751
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:37,180
- Make it easy for him.

1752
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,100
Let him down gently.

1753
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:41,150
Oh he'll run.

1754
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:48,150
That's what you're planning
on doing, isn't it?

1755
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:49,110
- Yeah.

1756
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:50,100
- [Bill] Giving up again?

1757
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,090
- Love you too.

1758
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:53,110
See you soon.

1759
01:28:54,150 --> 01:28:55,110
Yeah, bye.

1760
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,220
- Who's Sarah?

1761
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:07,110
- She's my daughter...

1762
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,010
The drawings are for her.
(soft piano music)

1763
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,200
It's kind of her thing,

1764
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:15,100
because even if her mom
isn't in my life anymore,

1765
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,010
we still wanna be able to find a
way to--

1766
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:19,080
- I look happy.

1767
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:25,090
- Well if you can find
happiness in an elevator

1768
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:28,010
you can find it anywhere, right?

1769
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:33,120
- I know why I was happy.

1770
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,180
I was with you.

1771
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:37,070
- Take it with you

1772
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:39,090
when you go to Wisconsin.

1773
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,020
- No, I don't want it.

1774
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:44,100
I want people Ethan.

1775
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,080
I want you,

1776
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:49,050
to take it to your daughter.

1777
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:52,040
Give it to her.

1778
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:55,020
(soft piano music)

1779
01:30:04,130 --> 01:30:07,050
- So what's in this box anyways?

1780
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:12,040
- Sent.

1781
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:15,130
That would be two pages
of bad handwriting.

1782
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:16,200
Scarlett?

1783
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,020
- I got it now.

1784
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,200
- Sweet.

1785
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,080
We would have been done
two minutes ago if Chase

1786
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,130
wasn't on drugs.

1787
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:24,090
Hear that Chase,

1788
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:25,050
if you weren't on drugs--

1789
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,090
- Chase!

1790
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,060
(gagging and commotion)

1791
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,130
- Are you okay?

1792
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:30,150
Bill, help him out, Bill!

1793
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:31,200
- Chase what's going on?

1794
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,110
- [Tristan] Look man, I'm sorry.

1795
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:35,070
- [Cameron] Bill, what is going
on?

1796
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:37,130
- Do you know anything about
this?

1797
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:38,090
- Are you okay?

1798
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:39,090
- What is it, drugs?

1799
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:41,130
What are you taking Chase?

1800
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,200
- I didn't forget my homework
Trist.

1801
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:49,030
I forgot an extra pen.

1802
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:55,160
I didn't take my Lantus last
night,

1803
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:57,060
and those donuts...

1804
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,160
I'm diabetic.

1805
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:04,020
(soft emotional music)

1806
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:04,220
- What?

1807
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:07,150
No, you said pen--

1808
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:11,000
- He tried to take his novolog.

1809
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,060
The thing clicked four times,
it's empty.

1810
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:17,040
- Why didn't you say something?

1811
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,190
- I didn't think we'd be
stuck here for 10 hours okay?

1812
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:22,030
- Kid, what's your BG level?

1813
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:25,050
- 600.

1814
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:29,020
- He should be in the hospital.

1815
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:30,000
He has DKA.

1816
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:34,070
If we don't do something,
he's gonna slip into a coma.

1817
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:35,110
- You knew all along?

1818
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:37,210
Why didn't you say something?

1819
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:40,140
- And how would that have helped
anything?

1820
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:43,040
Look, if he'd wanted you to
know,

1821
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,220
he would've told you.

1822
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:48,120
- This is really stupid man.

1823
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:51,000
If I would've told you,

1824
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,130
you would've called me Sugar
Rush.

1825
01:31:54,130 --> 01:31:56,220
- Bill, what do we do here?

1826
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,100
- He needs insulin.

1827
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:01,060
- Oh well let me check my
pockets!

1828
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,180
(phone dialing)

1829
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:09,020
- Pick up, pick up, come on...

1830
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:09,220
- [Phone operator] Hello.

1831
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:10,190
- Hello!

1832
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:12,080
- Hello?
- Hello?

1833
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,000
- Am I talking to a real person?

1834
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,010
What, were you having
a tea party up there?

1835
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:19,140
We were supposed to be
out here 10 hours ago.

1836
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,020
What were you morons thinking?

1837
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:22,150
- We're not getting out of
here until we help each other.

1838
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:23,110
- [Cameron] We have an
emergency.

1839
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:25,000
- Get my glucometer bag.

1840
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,150
It's in the inside pocket of my
jacket.

1841
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:30,040
- [Cameron] We need to
get him out of here now.

1842
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,070
- Chase, do you need food?

1843
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:34,030
- [Cameron] Yes, yes, get over
here.

1844
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:36,050
- I have a candy bar.

1845
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:38,150
- Why do you still have food?

1846
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:44,160
- I didn't know long we
were gonna be stuck in here.

1847
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,230
I mean we could've
started eating each other!

1848
01:32:46,230 --> 01:32:49,140
- And you were gonna use that

1849
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:51,180
to bargain for your life?

1850
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:53,050
- Look man, just take it.

1851
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:54,010
Come on.

1852
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:57,130
Hey, we are gonna get
you out of this, okay?

1853
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:59,070
You're gonna be okay.

1854
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:01,020
- This?

1855
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:01,220
- Perfect.

1856
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:06,030
- They said 20 minutes to get us
out.

1857
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:07,090
They said they didn't see us.

1858
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:08,150
The idiot switched shifts

1859
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:10,060
and he didn't tell
anyone we were down here.

1860
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:13,070
Do they even look at the
cameras?

1861
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:16,020
They've gotta get an ambulance
down here.

1862
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:17,150
(sighing)

1863
01:33:17,150 --> 01:33:19,000
- Are you okay Bill?

1864
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,230
- He doesn't have that long...

1865
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:23,120
I thought I would be the one

1866
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:26,030
they carried out of here on a
stretcher.

1867
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:27,210
Never leave home without it.

1868
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:31,080
Kid, what's your insulin
sensitivity, 50?

1869
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:37,160
Well, that might not be enough.

1870
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,030
- Wait, you're taking all of it?

1871
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:40,210
Bill, are you sure about this?

1872
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:43,150
You don't look so good.

1873
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,150
Can you last 20 minutes?

1874
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:50,170
- You're giving him the
rest of your insulin?

1875
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:52,170
- How long did you know about
Chase?

1876
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:54,140
You didn't turn off your
pump for him, did you?

1877
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:56,140
- Well, I knew one of us would
need it.

1878
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:58,070
- You did that for us?

1879
01:33:58,070 --> 01:34:00,090
No, no you don't do that!

1880
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:04,050
- Never would have thought
it of me, would ya?

1881
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:08,050
Because it's reckless,
and selfless, and stupid.

1882
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:12,160
I knew as soon as I put it
together.

1883
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,220
What are the odds?

1884
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:16,060
Both of us trapped in here.

1885
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:17,140
Same medication?

1886
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:22,170
Nah, it's too much of a
coincidence.

1887
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:25,190
God has given me a
chance to leave this life

1888
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:28,070
without being a complete jerk.

1889
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:32,080
- But you don't need it, right?

1890
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:34,100
You don't need it!

1891
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:35,060
Hey!

1892
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,090
- Ow, don't...

1893
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:44,160
- Alright you're gonna feel

1894
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,230
like you've been hit by a cement
truck

1895
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:48,000
for the next few hours kid.

1896
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,080
I think he'll be okay.

1897
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,110
You're not leaving us yet.

1898
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,150
- So this is it?

1899
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:59,140
You just give your life for him?

1900
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,060
Why would you do that?

1901
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:05,140
Why would you help some
stupid kids like us?

1902
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:07,140
We mean nothing to you,
we're just strangers.

1903
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:09,220
- None of you are strangers.

1904
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,140
- You're a liar!

1905
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:19,030
You're supposed to be some
grumpy old man.

1906
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:20,120
What a fake!

1907
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,200
- So is that my new nickname
kid, huh?

1908
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,050
Grumpy, fake?

1909
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:27,110
Well, why don't you come
speak at my funeral,

1910
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:31,200
and you and my kids can
trade I hate Bill stories!

1911
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,210
Hey, if you can get them to
come,

1912
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:35,090
I'll even put you in the will.

1913
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:37,020
- You just love this, don't you?

1914
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:38,130
You get everything you want.

1915
01:35:38,130 --> 01:35:41,090
You die like a hero and you
leave the rest of us here!

1916
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:43,060
I knew I hated you.

1917
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:44,210
- Relax kid.

1918
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:46,030
I'm not dead yet.

1919
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:47,060
- Stop making light of this.

1920
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:49,030
- I'm not your dad!

1921
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:50,210
People die.

1922
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:54,150
You've gotta decide how
you treat the living.

1923
01:35:58,190 --> 01:35:59,160
No regrets.

1924
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:07,110
Don't do it like I did.

1925
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:14,040
- Stay with us Bill.

1926
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,220
- I see you, mean little girl.

1927
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:25,020
What was it that made you feel
powerless?

1928
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:28,060
So afraid, you're gonna fade
into nothing,

1929
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,100
and then what?

1930
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:34,060
- Bill don't...

1931
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,090
- You can't show anybody the
real you

1932
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:39,010
except what's on the outside.

1933
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:41,010
You can't let anyone in.

1934
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,120
So why'd you take a chance on
this guy?

1935
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:45,230
You knew better.

1936
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:48,010
You're smarter than that.

1937
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,180
I know, love hurts.

1938
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:56,080
I can't stop loving her either.

1939
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:06,190
There's no fear in love.

1940
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:14,090
- I can't believe you.

1941
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:18,130
Giving your last words like
you think it means something.

1942
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,080
Bill listen to me!

1943
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:25,090
- You wake up in the morning

1944
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:27,130
and think you're all alone

1945
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:32,050
in a building full of strangers

1946
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,120
who are all just like you,

1947
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:38,090
coldness,

1948
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:41,060
and pride,

1949
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:45,030
anger,

1950
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,080
loneliness,

1951
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,080
disease,

1952
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:54,110
fear,

1953
01:37:57,010 --> 01:37:58,030
and ambition.

1954
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:03,230
Friends and enemies, all a part
of you.

1955
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:10,120
- You think you're in here for
us?

1956
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:11,100
To help us?

1957
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:16,080
This isn't some stupid
Christmas TV miracle story.

1958
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,120
- Tristan, he's dying...

1959
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:19,130
- I don't care!

1960
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:21,090
That doesn't give him the right.

1961
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:23,000
You hear me Bill, you are so
full of it.

1962
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,050
Just because you don't wanna
live

1963
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:26,150
doesn't mean you can
ask us to do it for you!

1964
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,170
I won't, none of us will.

1965
01:38:30,010 --> 01:38:31,010
- Baby girl.

1966
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:34,070
You sing your songs.

1967
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:38,230
Don't wait for the world
to give you permission,

1968
01:38:38,230 --> 01:38:40,200
because nobody will.

1969
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,160
- Shut up!

1970
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:48,020
- And you.

1971
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:49,050
- So what?

1972
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:51,140
You gonna let me have it now?

1973
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:55,200
- You're the worst of all of us.

1974
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,230
You remind me of me.

1975
01:38:57,230 --> 01:38:58,190
- Figures.

1976
01:39:00,110 --> 01:39:02,210
- I figure a smart kid like you

1977
01:39:02,210 --> 01:39:05,090
would do something about that.

1978
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:15,040
- What does God get out of this?

1979
01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:19,010
We have to watch you die now?

1980
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:21,160
I sit and watch my dad dying

1981
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:23,170
and I'm not gonna do it again!

1982
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:25,000
You fight through this.

1983
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,120
You stupid coward!

1984
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:29,150
- I knew I liked you.

1985
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:35,160
- What if we were here to help
you?

1986
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:39,050
What about that?

1987
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:44,030
♪ Silent night

1988
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,140

("silent night")

2003
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:37,100
- Chase, wake up.

2004
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:38,110
- [Scarlett] Chase?

2005
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:39,210
- Chase, come on.

2006
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:46,100
Oh man...

2007
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:51,130
- Hey, you coming to my game?

2008
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:55,100
- I don't think you
are going to your game.

2009
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:57,220
I'm not watching anybody else.

2010
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:01,230
- I'll give this back

2011
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:04,050
when you come and visit me.

2012
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:07,210
- Her dad's gonna murder you.

2013
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:10,150
Just saying, Sugar Rush.

2014
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:12,070
- I really hate you.

2015
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:26,110
(soft piano music)

2016
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:42,020
(crowd murmuring)

2017
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:52,040
(siren blaring)

2018
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:04,070
- [Employee] I'm sorry sir,
nobody is allowed through here.

2019
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:05,090
- [Man] You're kidding me.

2020
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:07,000
- [Wife] We have tickets to the
theater

2021
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,100
and we need to go right now.

2022
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:09,050
- [Employee] Sir, I'm sorry,

2023
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:10,020
there's nothing we can do.

2024
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:12,150
Won't you come this way please?

2025
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:16,190
- This is unacceptable.

2026
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:18,010
- I'm really sorry ma'am.

2027
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:19,100
This is just a minor
inconvenience.

2028
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:21,030
Everything will be
cleared up in just a bit.

2029
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:21,230
- But how long?

2030
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:22,190
We need to go.

2031
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:23,230
We have theater tickets.

2032
01:44:23,230 --> 01:44:25,040
- You won't miss your show.

2033
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,070
- [Man] We need to get out of
here.

2034
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:29,030
- [Employee] Paul, please go get
Jones.

2035
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:31,230
(crowd commotion)

2036
01:44:57,030 --> 01:44:58,130
- I should catch the last bus
out.

2037
01:44:58,130 --> 01:45:01,000
- You wanna share a taxi or...

2038
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:03,110
- I've got it.

2039
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:04,170
- Yeah, me too.

2040
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:08,120
I mean, I've already
missed my daughter's party.

2041
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:12,100
I should probably just
go back to my apartment.

2042
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:16,030
If you miss your bus...

2043
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:21,060
- It was really nice to meet
you.

2044
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:22,020
- Yeah.

2045
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:26,070
(cell phone ringing)

2046
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:30,220
I need to answer this.

2047
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,020
Hey, yeah, yeah I know.

2048
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:02,220
- He was old.

2049
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:05,100
Sometimes these things happen.

2050
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,020
- Bad news?

2051
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:25,040
- My editor, she got the
article.

2052
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,060
She hates it.

2053
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:29,100
It was in poor taste to text

2054
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:31,130
and she doesn't know what
she's gonna do with it anyway.

2055
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:34,090
She thinks it's sentimental
trash.

2056
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:40,070
- So she wants more of the
same old crap then, huh?

2057
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:43,180
You know, I could help you out
with that.

2058
01:46:44,210 --> 01:46:45,220
- [Maggie] How?

2059
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:48,120
- I could pick you up around
8:00?

2060
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:53,200
- You've always been the
romantic.

2061
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:58,000
- Never have Maggie, but if
you want me to, I'll try.

2062
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:59,170
(soft piano music)

2063
01:46:59,170 --> 01:47:02,220
- Cameron, if you said
that four months ago

2064
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:06,120
you could've said anything

2065
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:09,090
and I would've come back to you,

2066
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:10,230
but I'm strong now.

2067
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:15,160
- So, what would you do if I
kissed you?

2068
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:19,010
- I'd pretend to be mad.

2069
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:23,200
Maybe write an article about it.

2070
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,180
- That's my girl.

2071
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:33,010
Come here.

2072
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:39,070
- Hey kid, got off the
lawn or I'll shoot you.

2073
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:40,140
- [Tristan] What?

2074
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:42,120
- A message from the old man.

2075
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:44,090
I know the guy.

2076
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:46,050
Come on, I'll give you
a ride to the hospital.

2077
01:47:46,050 --> 01:47:48,010
He cleared you for it.

2078
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:50,200
- Grumpy old man.

2079
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,090
If he tries to die on me,

2080
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:54,230
so help me there's something
I need to say at his funeral.

2081
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:56,180
Right to his kids.

2082
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:59,180
Come on O'Hara, Bill's a
fighter.

2083
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:02,060
We've got more fighting to do.

2084
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,190
Oh hey, Jumpy Leg,

2085
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:09,100
there's some New Ageist waiting
in the back there for you.

2086
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:13,140
Don't you guys gotta go
fight some crime together?

2087
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:18,170
- You know, I'm totally
cool with being friends.

2088
01:48:18,170 --> 01:48:20,080
- Really?

2089
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:21,040
- No.

2090
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:27,000
- Oh it's gonna be a lot harder
to get me back than that.

2091
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,180
- Good, that'll be fun.

2092
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:37,130
(soft piano music)

2093
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,120
- Ma'am?

2094
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:55,120
- But you are going to love your
present.

2095
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:58,220
Mmhm, yeah, I'll bring it by
tomorrow.

2096
01:48:58,220 --> 01:49:01,060
Okay, love you bye.

2097
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:04,030
- Hey buddy, this one's broken.

2098
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:06,210
It's not gonna take you
anywhere.

2099
01:49:14,110 --> 01:49:15,090
- You look familiar.

2100
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,120
Have I seen you before?

2101
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:19,140
Maybe at the supermarket.

2102
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:22,090
Do you shop at Macy's?

2103
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:25,150
- No, I think it was somewhere
else.

2104
01:49:25,150 --> 01:49:27,120
Don't you live on floor 22?

2105
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,140
(laughing)

2106
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:30,210
- Yeah but it might take us a
while

2107
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:33,090
to get there in this elevator.

2108
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:38,140
- Hey people, this one's broken!

2109
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:39,140
You're gonna have to use the one

2110
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:42,080
at the other end of the
building.

2111
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:49,010
- Look Ethan, I'm not gonna be
your muse.

2112
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:52,030
I get mad sometimes

2113
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:54,170
and I laugh really loud, but...

2114
01:49:58,180 --> 01:49:59,190
You don't have to remember me,

2115
01:49:59,190 --> 01:50:03,040
or the way I stand or smile
because

2116
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,020
I'm not going anywhere.

2117
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:10,060
(upbeat happy music)

2118
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:14,210
- Here that box looks heavy.

2119
01:50:14,210 --> 01:50:16,130
Let me grab that for you.

2120
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:17,230
(box crashing)

2121
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:18,190
Oh, sorry!

2122
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:21,060
Sorry.

2123
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:35,100
- Are you sorry you missed
that Christmas party?

2124
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:38,160
- Nah, we can just have one of
our own.
