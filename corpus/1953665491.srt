186
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,332
You know that
I'm gonna love you

187
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,434
no matter what?

188
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,003
I know...

189
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,371
That's why we're married.

190
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,642
Why don't you grow
that giant hand of yours,

191
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,611
and pour me a glass
of champagne, huh?

192
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:18,356
You know, Michael...

193
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:23,962
You just married a vivacious
20...something.

194
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,196
We're going on our honeymoon.

195
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,901
You're talking about twins,
and giantism.

196
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,970
It's our wedding night!

197
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:35,139
It's not like we've been
holding out on each other.

198
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,341
Hardly.

199
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,911
Why can't we talk?

200
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,213
We can talk.

201
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:46,050
Just right now,
you're giving me a migraine.

202
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,252
OK.

203
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:50,955
Just know, this is the voice

204
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:54,192
that you're going to be hearing
for the rest of your life.

205
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,036
[moaning]

206
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,349
Ah...

207
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,418
Oh...

208
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,186
I love you.

209
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,489
Ah...

210
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:25,623
Oh.

211
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,385
I wish you would quit
breathing so loud.

212
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,634
- Hey, Michael
- No, don't talk.

213
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,135
Just take in the moment.

214
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,637
Absorb the beauty.

215
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,007
Come on.

216
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,311
I miss New York.

217
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,479
Already?

218
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,350
I cannot function
outside the city, OK?

219
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:28,386
Besides, it smells
like dead fish out there.

220
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,355
And I prefer
my fish to be live.

221
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,490
And in tanks.

222
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,094
Vivian, you're gonna be fine.

223
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:36,561
No fish.

224
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,262
No sushi.

225
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,365
Just me...

226
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,733
Me and my body.

227
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:54,612
OK. Can you not stare
at me for a little while?

228
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,248
I'm trying to find myself.

229
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,616
You're right here.

230
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,586
No, the book on tape,
or whatever.

231
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,455
You know what?
I'm gonna go.

232
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,157
I'm gonna jazzercise.

233
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,528
Jazzercise?

234
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,074
Oh, my God.

235
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,442
It's a Molton Miller.

236
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,545
Oh, this is a classic.

237
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,646
It's an ass.

238
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,214
It's art.

239
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,417
No, this is going to be worth
a lot of money someday.

240
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,485
I read about him
in an art blog.

241
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,721
It's still an ass.

242
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,159
You know who needs this ass?

243
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,293
Charlie.

244
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,663
Yeah, Charlie needs this ass.

245
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,101
He is so gonna love this ass.

246
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,537
Yeah.

247
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,709
[chatter and laughter]

248
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,284
Wow...

249
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,252
Talk about overdressed, eh?

250
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,520
Walking with a swagger.

251
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,123
He's got that whole vibe
going on.

252
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,458
Right, he waddles.

253
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,894
Oh, Michael.

254
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,197
Where did you bring me?

255
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,531
They said this
was the perfect place

256
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,467
for honeymooners.

257
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,302
Honeymooners? From where?

258
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,770
Iceland?

259
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,541
This is actually what
happy couples look like, Viv.

260
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,211
They're just trying to fill
that God-shaped

261
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,279
hole in the sky with,
you know, mimosas

262
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,581
and fake foliage.

263
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,916
How about them?
They look sweet.

264
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,152
They look like
they are having a blast.

265
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,491
Yeah, well,
speaking of a blast,

266
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,726
I'm just going to have
to get blasted.

267
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,530
Lynn, repeat after me.

268
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,899
I am not a victim.

269
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,234
I am not a victim.

270
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,368
Louder.

271
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,504
Huh?

272
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,938
Louder.

273
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,206
I am not a victim.

274
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,582
[yells, dish shatters]
Oh, my God!

275
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,185
Have you heard
of destructive therapy, Lynn?

276
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,587
It's the process
of smashing objects

277
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,356
to release stress and anxiety.

278
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,958
- No, I don't--
- You're not a victim, Lynn.

279
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,959
Lynn, Lynn.

280
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,761
Come on. Stand up.

281
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,296
Come on. You can do it.

282
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:26,964
Just do it.

283
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,432
Just throw it.

284
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,368
Come on, Lynn.

285
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,602
Throw it.

286
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,371
Throw it, Lynn!

287
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,605
Come on, you're not a victim!

288
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,340
[glass shatters]
Yes!

289
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,675
- Yes.
- Yeah.

290
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,676
How'd that feel?

291
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,777
That felt great.

292
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,214
Oh, no, no, no!
That's my favorite--

293
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,683
Ah, OK, you know what,
it's...yeah.

294
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,518
It's time to go, yeah.

295
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,754
Same time next week, OK?

296
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:53,457
Just go, all right?

297
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,625
All right, OK.

298
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,364
[sighs]

299
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,634
Hello, everyone.

300
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:07,004
My name's Bill,
and I am a sex addict.

301
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,706
(all)
Hi, Bill.

302
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:14,979
I, uh, just can't get enough
of other people's junk.

303
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,315
On Thursday nights
I used to go under

304
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20,551
the dick dock in Cape May.

305
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,353
I was a watcher.

306
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,324
Sometimes...

307
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,625
I was a doer.

308
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,828
But enough about me.

309
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,431
This is a safe place.

310
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,500
What we say in this room
stays in the room.

311
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,803
So, who would like to start?

312
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,607
I would like to start.

313
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,976
Tony, why don't we
give someone else

314
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:45,977
a chance this week?

315
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:50,848
OK, but I would like to get
something off my chest.

316
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,651
Go ahead.

317
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,254
Hello, everyone.

318
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,423
My name is Tony,
and I am a sex addict.

319
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,825
Hi, Tony.

320
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:04,328
I have a taste
for the classics.

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,733
1920s flapper porn,
'50s housewives

00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,739
Anything that's
'60s Danish hardcore.

324
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,674
It's the addiction, Tony.

325
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:17,608
It's OK.

326
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,043
We've all been there.

327
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,779
Anyone else?

328
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,582
I will.

329
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,616
Ah.

330
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,285
Please, share with us.

00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:31,055
Hi. I'm Natasha,
and I am a sex addict.

332
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,857
Hi, Natasha.

333
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:37,361
I love men, women,

Any place.

340
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,736

341
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,780
Oh, yeah.

Oh, my God.

343
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,484
Oh, I love you.

00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,585

- Hey.
- Hi.

351
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,547
Whoa!

352
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,615
Seriously?

353
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,916
I wanted to do that.

354
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,620
I can't.
I don't do sex.

355
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,555
Oh, come on.
It's not that hard.

356
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,623
No.

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,730
Oh...

359
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,399
It's the outfit.
I can't resist.

360
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,566
You're drunk, huh?

361
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,801
Obvious?

362
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,469
Sorry.

What's that noise?
Is someone in there with you?

365
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:35,179
I should probably
tell you this...

366
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:41,619
I listen to police scanners
from various US cities.

368
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,626
Are you on the run?

00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,728
- No.

00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,741
It's my calling.

554
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:08,545
I mean, the full figureds
need clothes too.

555
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:16,019
Do you-- Do you like Adrian?

556
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,654
I do.

557
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,557
Well, Adrian is
the kind of...

558
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,760
Yeah, he's a little bit lost.

559
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:28,231
Well, Adrian's a good boy.
But he's a middle child.

560
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,601
Can we not get
into this, Mother?

561
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:35,038
You and I are gonna
get together later, Melinda.

562
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,606
I've got some pointers
as a professional

563
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,442
to help you deal
with middle children.

564
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,212
Well, uh...

565
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:45,816
I sure would like
Adrian to find somebody.

566
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:49,286
Although God knows, marriage
is like committing suicide

OK, we gotta go.

00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,126
Go? Are you kidding me?

571
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,527
I made you tamales.

572
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:00,130
I can't believe
I didn't serve them.

573
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,065
Since when have
you ever made me anything,

574
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,533
especially tamales?

575
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,203
I am taking Spanish classes,

576
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:09,239
and I thought I would
take in the culture.

00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,808

- OK, Dad.

We haven't decided
what we're gonna do yet.

- I need another drink.
- Me too.

724
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:10,260
- Me three.
- No, no. You cannot drink.

that looks like Elf, do you?

Oh, shit...

733
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,873
My mom has a bong?

734
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,207
Shh!

735
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,612
Mom, I don't even have a bong.

736
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:04,614
Pot is therapeutic.

737
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:05,848
You should know.

738
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,684
You know I smoked?

739
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,719
You didn't say anything?

740
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,955
Why do you think
it always went missing?

741
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:14,624
- I thought it was Adrian.
- No, it was me.

742
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:15,692
Here.

743
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,733
You know, honey...

744
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:27,303
I think things are really over
with your father.

745
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:28,738
Are you OK?

746
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,039
I don't know.

747
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,140
It's just...

748
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:33,776
it's just so hard,
like being right,

749
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,045
like, all the time.

750
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:38,848
You know, maybe
you should take a break.

751
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,254
I have no idea
how to do that.

752
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,828
I feel like I look old.

753
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,730
- You look young.
- No.

754
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,665
Maybe a little too young.

755
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:58,134
No. I look like a puffer fish.

756
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,803
Yes, but a young puffer fish.

757
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:01,938
[laughs]

758
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,946
Oh, I feel so old.

759
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,148
Oh, God.

760
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:19,956
Oh, what is it?

761
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,625
What's wrong?

762
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:24,093
I met someone.

763
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:26,696
Oh, that's fantastic.

764
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:28,865
He hasn't called me back.

765
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:32,635
I like him so much
it makes me feel sick.

766
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:35,938
Oh, sweetie, I understand.

767
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,840
How long has it been?

768
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:38,875
One week.

769
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:41,044
Oh, honey.
Come here, come here.

770
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:44,647
Can I give you some advice,
as your mother?

771
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:46,849
Take one more hit of this.

772
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,851
And then...that's it.

773
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:52,021
One more hit then we'll
take off the rubber band.

774
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,856
No, this is kill--
This is hurting you.

775
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,358
This is why he hasn't called...

776
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,994
- We're gonna take it off.
- No, please don't.

777
00:44:57,996 --> 00:44:59,195
It's gonna break off...

778
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,963
[laughs]

779
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,102
I can't quite do it.

780
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:07,804
Shh...

781
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,675
[laughing]

782
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,118
So what the fuck
are we going to do, huh?

783
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,419
About what?

784
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,723
About the fact
that I'm pregnant.

785
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,658
We should handle
this like adults.

786
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,893
Oh, God.

787
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,995
You know,
I still feel like I'm 16.

788
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:35,732
I have no better idea what
to do now than I did then.

789
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,200
I think we need to fuck...

790
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:38,835
And then decide.

791
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:40,203
Brilliant.

792
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,974
I hope it's Michael's.

793
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:47,076
He probably wants it
more than me.

794
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,914
I think I like you
more than him.

795
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,916
You're supposed to like me
more than him.

796
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,251
You're married to him.

797
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,220
Don't say that word.

798
00:45:57,222 --> 00:46:00,990
It's too permanent sounding.

799
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:03,926
This is not what I thought
it was going to be like.

800
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,928
I feel like...

801
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,898
I feel like a real asshole,
Vivian.

802
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,899
Do you?

803
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:11,234
Yeah.

804
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,172
You know, if it wasn't you
it'd probably be somebody else.

805
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:19,709
Yeah, I guess it's better
to keep it in the family.

806
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:21,444
[doorbell buzzing]

807
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,112
Who the fuck is that?

808
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,747
I don't know.

809
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:31,888
Who is it?

810
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,189
It's Michael, open up.

811
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,791
Hey, uh, come on up.

812
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:37,126
- What is he doing here?
- You gotta hide.

813
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,728
What? Fuck you.

814
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,801
This is great, you know that?

815
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,204
Please don't come out.

816
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,911
So I fucked the maid
on our honeymoon.

817
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:55,912
Seriously?

818
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:59,148
she was there,
and flirting with me.

819
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,984
So I bent her
over the wet bar,

820
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,153
and I fucked her in the ass.

821
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,755
Where was Vivian?

822
00:47:05,757 --> 00:47:08,991
She was in the steam room
or getting a massage -

823
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,226
I don't know.

824
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:11,961
I feel bad.

825
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:12,929
Shit happens.

826
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:14,931
Should I tell her or not?

827
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:16,833
You definitely should.

828
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:19,001
Don't you think that could
just cause unnecessary drama?

829
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:22,171
It's not like I'm ever gonna see
this random maid ever again.

830
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,540
Honesty is always good.

831
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,342
I should talk to Mom, huh?

832
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,144
I don't think so.

833
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,313
She'll just make you
feel better about yourself.

834
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:32,248
Oh, God forbid.

835
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,850
Everyone cheats.

836
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,484
Just forget it ever happened.

837
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,078
[cell phone ringing]

838
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,518
Hello.

839
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,588
Hi. May I speak with
George, please?

840
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,156
This is George.

841
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:15,291
George, hi.

842
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:17,393
It's Dr. Petunia,
Charlie's mom.

843
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,066
Oh... Hi.

844
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,903
Uh, is everything OK?

845
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:31,073
I just wanted to invite you
over for dinner tonight.

846
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:35,244
Oh, that's nice of you.

847
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:38,014
Yeah, how's five o'clock?

848
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:40,917
That's early.

849
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:42,218
OK, 5:30.

850
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,222
My husband gets heartburn
if we eat any later.

851
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:49,926
Um, sure.

852
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:51,494
Sounds like fun.

853
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,197
Great. I'll see you then.

854
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,465
Bye bye.

855
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,181
You seem anxious.

856
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:13,349
Do I make you nervous?

857
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:14,884
No.

858
00:49:14,886 --> 00:49:16,419
I'm just a little...

859
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:18,254
confused.

860
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:20,189
It's to be expected.

861
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:21,457
There's nothing
to worry about.

862
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,259
This is a safe place.

863
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:24,460
This room is safe.

864
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,363
And what happens here,
stays here.

865
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:30,032
I guess I'm just not sure

866
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:33,135
what I'm doing here
without your son.

867
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:34,637
All right.

868
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,907
As you know, Charlie has
taken a vow of abstinence.

869
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:40,443
Did you turn up the heat?
I'm sweating.

870
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:42,345
As a psychologist...

871
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,486
As a psychologist, I feel
this is very unhealthy

872
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,288
for a boy his age.

873
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,490
85 degrees.
Are you trying to kill me?

874
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:58,995
Celibacy at 24 is indicative of
a more deeply rooted issue.

875
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:01,931
Do... do we have a fan?

876
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:05,267
Do you understand what I'm
trying to say here, George?

877
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:09,338
I can't say that I do.

878
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,309
We want you to have...

879
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,350
...with our son.

880
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,619
Just buy him
a couple of drinks

881
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,287
and, and, and, well...

882
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:28,057
I suppose you know
how to execute the rest.

883
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,961
You want me
to date rape Charlie?

884
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:36,032
No. Just think of it as
aggressive seduction.

885
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:41,537
Mrs... Dr. Petunia.

886
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:45,975
If Charlie makes a choice...

887
00:50:45,977 --> 00:50:49,311
I don't think you're
supposed to undermine it.

888
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:51,981
I love my son, George.
I want him to flourish.

889
00:50:51,983 --> 00:50:54,550
I want him to have
a great and prosperous life.

890
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,520
And what he is doing
is psychologically unhealthy.

891
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:58,554
I...

892
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,356
I think you can help.

893
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,760
The damn thermostat
is stuck.

894
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,764
What do you think, George?

895
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,533
Can you help our family?

896
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,340
I, uh...

897
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,598
[phone ringing]

898
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,749
George! I love you!

899
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,253
Answer me!

900
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:06,255
I love you!

901
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:13,829
He's not home.

902
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:16,065
OK.

903
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:19,068
Um, who are you?

904
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,437
His wife.

905
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,340
This is pretty...

906
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:25,307
Awkward?

907
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,076
I didn't know he was...

908
00:52:27,078 --> 00:52:28,377
Straight.

909
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:31,147
Well, yeah.

910
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:33,415
Gay and straight
are just labels.

911
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,417
Sexuality is the
infinite variable.

912
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:38,154
Are you like those
freaky Amish people?

913
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:41,223
George and I are a family.

914
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:44,827
And so whatever he needs,
I agree with, because...

915
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:49,565
Oprah had a book club book
on open marriage once.

916
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:50,633
I didn't read it.

917
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,335
I just held it
so people on the bus

918
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,471
wouldn't talk to me.

919
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:56,572
Well...

920
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:58,674
Yeah, I know.

921
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,876
I mean, I know,
it's not like

922
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:02,278
the most conventional thing.

923
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,813
We're not crazy
sex maniacs or anything.

924
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:07,183
It's just... we gotta do
what we gotta do.

925
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,122
What are you drinking?

926
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:16,659
Lemonade, maple syrup,
brown sugar and prune juice.

927
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:18,460
It's a diet.

928
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:19,695
Are you serious?

929
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,198
Do I look like I'm joking?

930
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,600
Well, aren't you hungry?

931
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:26,335
Starving.

932
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:29,138
But it's a...it's a detox.

933
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,206
It's a cleanse.

934
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,707
It's a rebirth.

935
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:35,311
It's morally condoned anorexia.

936
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,380
Why not just work out?

937
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,716
I run 40 miles a week.

938
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,384
Wow.

939
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:45,487
I don't even cover
40 miles a year.

940
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:48,724
You look great.

941
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,292
Oh, I don't do it
to look good.

942
00:53:50,294 --> 00:53:53,162
I just want to feel like
I'm going somewhere.

943
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:56,365
and I run the fuck
out of that reservoir.

944
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,500
Does it work?

945
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:00,469
No.

946
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:03,939
Some days I just want
to just keep on running.

947
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:06,175
Yeah, me too.

948
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,949
Charlie.

949
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,419
I see you've met Robin.

950
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,188
He loves you.

951
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,424
I thought you were home.

952
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,593
I didn't know you were...

953
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,762
We're married.

954
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,897
That's the word.

955
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,667
I'm gonna let
you guys handle this.

956
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:33,736
I'll be inside
ironing my panties.

957
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:39,375
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

958
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:40,776
I thought we were...

959
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:44,280
We were, we are.

960
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:46,582
I don't believe that.

961
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:48,250
I know what I know.

962
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,287
Is that supposed
to mean something?

963
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,689
I thought we could be
friends who have fun together.

964
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:56,625
We did. We are, right?

965
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,560
I'm gonna die.

966
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,629
This is why I don't date
people in my zip code.

967
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,631
You share a bodega.
You share a post office.

968
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:06,468
You shouldn't be
dating anyone anyway.

969
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,370
You haven't been burned
like the rest of us.

970
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:09,872
The rest of us settle.

971
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:12,508
You are the only person

972
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,743
that I have
thought about for months.

973
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,713
You're gonna like a lot of
people in your life, Charlie,

974
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:19,381
believe me.

975
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:21,550
This is entirely fucked.

976
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:22,918
I'm sorry, buddy.

977
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:25,654
Buddy?

978
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:30,693
You are the only person
that I've ever liked.

979
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:32,561
That's too much pressure.

980
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:38,334
Where have you
been hiding her?

981
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:40,636
She was away for business.

982
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:42,271
You don't love me?

983
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,574
I don't know
what that means.

984
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,646
I need to go.

985
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:52,414
Don't make this weird.

986
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,951
Me, make this weird?

987
00:55:58,421 --> 00:55:59,655
Come on.

988
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,063
You know where I live.

989
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:20,976
Got coffee.

990
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:34,356
[music blaring]

991
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:44,533
No drinking with my
grandchild in your womb, OK?

992
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:48,070
Excuse me.
Two Diet Pepsis, please.

993
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,772
Really smooth, Felicia.

994
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:51,573
- What?
- Well, it's...

995
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,777
OK, so now, you remember.

996
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:57,312
Guys are just like dogs.

997
00:56:57,314 --> 00:56:59,548
But instead of doing tricks
for biscuits, they do tricks

998
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,884
for, uh, you know, the ladies.

999
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:03,685
I know what I'm doing.

1000
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:06,488
Hey.

1001
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,490
Well... Hello.

1002
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:09,658
Do we know each other?

1003
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,095
It's just that
you look so familiar.

1004
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:15,798
Oh, well, yeah,
I used to get Demi Moore

1005
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,800
and Catherine Zeta a lot,
but that was

1006
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:19,568
when my hair was darker.

1007
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,503
Oh, I got it.
It's my aunt.

1008
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:23,372
You look just like
my Aunt Cathy.

1009
00:57:23,374 --> 00:57:26,542
Oh, my... That's chill.

1010
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:27,810
What did you say?

1011
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:29,511
I'm chill?

1012
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:30,879
No, you chill.

1013
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:32,514
Oh, hey, it's OK.

1014
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:34,416
You know, I'm down.

1015
00:57:34,418 --> 00:57:36,819
You're not that down...
Trust me.

1016
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:37,820
What's going on here?

1017
00:57:37,822 --> 00:57:40,522
Nothing.
We're... bitchin'.

1018
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:42,424
I am not bitching.

1019
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:43,826
You're bitching, you bitch!

1020
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:46,562
She doesn't know the lingo,
all right?

1021
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:48,764
No, I'm not familiar
with the current vernacular.

1022
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:51,733
Oh, my God!
I love Vernacular.

1023
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:53,535
I just saw them live.

1024
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:56,505
Here. Take this.

1025
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:58,507
Oh, thank you.

1026
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:00,542
This is mine.

1027
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:03,912
Here.

1028
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,555
Cheers.

1029
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:21,630
Oh, the water feels so...

1030
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:25,167
so cleansing, so sensuous.

1031
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,635
Oh, yeah.

1032
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:28,437
This is helping.
This is better.

1033
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,174
Are you OK?

1034
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:36,545
Your eyes look a little weird.

1035
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:39,414
OK... OK.
I'm great.

1036
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:40,582
I am great.

1037
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:42,718
I am beyond great.

1038
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,586
I am...

1039
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:45,787
Oh, oh.

1040
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,489
I am so...

1041
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:49,825
So, um...

1042
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:54,930
I am so, so, so, so...

1043
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:58,500
Oh, shit.

1044
00:58:58,502 --> 00:59:00,769
Vivian, I think I'm...

1045
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,771
I'm starting to
freak out a little bit.

1046
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:03,972
I'm...

1047
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:05,774
Wait, wait.

1048
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:07,676
- Did you take something?
- No...

1049
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:10,846
Well, maybe just a little...

1050
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:11,980
Ecstasy.

1051
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:13,849
[laughs]
Please don't tell Michael.

1052
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:15,617
Please, please.
He'll judge me.

1053
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:16,919
He's so self-righteous.

1054
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:19,187
He's so, my son.

1055
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:20,455
I won't tell him.

1056
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:22,758
God, it's hot in here.

1057
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,459
I think I'm overheating, Viv.

1058
00:59:24,461 --> 00:59:25,694
I think if I...

1059
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:27,963
Maybe if I just lay down.

1060
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:30,699
No, no, no.
Felicia, no.

1061
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:31,934
Not here, not here.

1062
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:34,703
Just hold on a second, OK?

1063
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:36,138
It's all right.

1064
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:41,543
OK, just relax...

1065
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:44,813
You can lay down
right over here.

1066
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:46,648
Yes.

1067
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:47,950
You've just got to
ride it out.

1068
00:59:47,952 --> 00:59:49,818
- OK.
- Be careful.

1069
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,620
I'm good.

1070
00:59:51,622 --> 00:59:52,955
Oh, it's so hot.

1071
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:53,889
Are you OK?

1072
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:54,790
Yeah...

1073
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,959
Oh...

1074
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:58,860
Oh, this is good.

1075
00:59:58,862 --> 00:59:59,828
It's so...

1076
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,063
It's so cold.

1077
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:02,564
Ahh.

1078
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:03,966
See? You're fine.

1079
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:06,902
Oh, I'm not.

1080
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:09,504
I'm not fine.

1081
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:12,240
I'm the opposite of fine.

1082
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:14,009
Just relax.

1083
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:16,078
No, I can't.

1084
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,646
I can't relax!

1085
01:00:17,648 --> 01:00:19,982
Relaxation makes me anxious.

1086
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:21,583
Oh, God.

1087
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:23,585
This is why
I don't take baths.

1088
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:27,089
You're sitting there waiting
for something to happen.

1089
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:28,857
Just inhale, exhale.

1090
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,692
Inhale and exhale.

1091
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:34,997
Sometimes breathing
is just so fucking depressing.

1092
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:36,932
Are you saying
you want to kill yourself?

1093
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:41,670
Oh, Viv,
I'm a narcissist, sweetie.

1094
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:43,538
We don't kill ourselves.

1095
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,273
We just assassinate
the character

1096
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:47,075
of all the people around us.

1097
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,944
Good.

1098
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:53,115
I mean, 'cause that would be
sad, you know, if you died.

1099
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,685
Can I ask you something?

1100
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,554
Yeah.

1101
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:01,123
Do you think I'm...

1102
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:04,993
If you were a man my age,
would you...

1103
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:09,031
Felicia, you're hot.

1104
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,032
Really?

1105
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:11,900
Yeah.

1106
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:13,101
Thanks.

1107
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:17,305
Maybe it's just me, you know?

1108
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:19,174
It's not his fault.

1109
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,809
Percy, I mean.

1110
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:26,281
I guess it's kind of nice
sometimes, you know.

1111
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,584
What's nice?

1112
01:01:29,586 --> 01:01:32,821
Just knowing that he's gonna
be there when I get home.

1113
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:33,922
Waiting.

1114
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:36,591
No matter what,
no matter when,

1115
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:38,060
he'll be there.

1116
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:40,829
So then what's the problem?

1117
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:44,666
Uh, it's just that
he doesn't look at me anymore.

1118
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:46,835
No one does.

1119
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,939
I'm not the entree anymore, Viv.

1120
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:54,910
I'm the...garnish.

1121
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:57,746
I'm the parsley.

1122
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:00,782
I'm hungry.

1123
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:02,250
Let's go.

1124
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,086
- Ow.
- What?

1125
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:05,754
It couldn't be kicking
already, right?

1126
01:02:05,756 --> 01:02:07,756
No, no, honey.
That's just gas.

1127
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,694
You know they say that being
pregnant is really beautiful,

1128
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:15,030
but it's really kind of gross.

1129
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:16,698
Oh, it's so gross.

1130
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,201
It doesn't get any better.

1131
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:21,336
But it's worth it most days.
Don't worry.

1132
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:25,240
I'm not so sure.

1133
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,042
And you never will be.

1134
01:02:29,947 --> 01:02:33,915
I, I, I really think
I need to dance, right now.

1135
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:37,719
Because if I don't
dance right now, I will die.

1136
01:02:37,721 --> 01:02:38,787

Robin, what are you doing?

1153
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:55,924
What?

1154
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:57,959
I don't even shower naked.

1155
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,794
Oh, we're all adults here.

1156
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:01,263
Fucking my husband.

1157
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:03,531
I mean, are we not?

1158
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:04,566
Are we not?

1159
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,035
- Robin.
- I made you eggs.

1160
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:08,870
I can't eat them, obviously.

1161
01:05:08,872 --> 01:05:11,539
But I, I made them for you.

1162
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,942
- All right, thank you.
- Yeah, thank you.

1163
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,345
Fuck this.

1164
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,016
I'm going running.
Ugh!

1165
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,152
We said thank you.

1166
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:26,021
She seems fine with it.

1167
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:26,821
Yeah.

1168
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:28,023
All right, where is she?

1169
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:30,025
- What?
- Where is she?

1170
01:05:30,027 --> 01:05:31,159
What are you talking about?

1171
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,827
Where the fuck is Vivian?

1172
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,362
Calm down.

1173
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:35,830
Charlie, I can't find her.

1174
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:38,300
And I know that you two,
you have your little

1175
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:41,836
Well, clearly
she is not here.

1176
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:44,239
What the hell
is he doing here?

1177
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:45,840
I'm his alibi.

1178
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,253
Are you fucking my wife?

1179
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:01,323
Michael, I am clearly gay.

1180
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:03,258
How am I supposed
to know these things, Charlie.

1181
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,160
You have a living room
full of pussies.

1182
01:06:05,162 --> 01:06:07,329
They're Adrian's.

1183
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,564
Adrian's. Why does he
get to have so many,

1184
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:11,333
and I can't just have one?

1185
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:13,401
Hmm?

1186
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:15,937
You know, she doesn't love me.

1187
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:17,973
It'll be okay, Michael.

1188
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,079
Is that Vivian?

1189
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:31,119
Hmm?

1190
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:33,888
This is not
what normal looks like.

1191
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,496
Water my plants.

1192
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,433
Michael, no!

1193
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,615
I need a fucking carb!

1194
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:03,251
Oh.

1195
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:14,929
Are you OK?

1196
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:16,097
I'm fine.

1197
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:20,402
Oh... I'm sorry.

1198
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:22,203
Where's Charlie?

1199
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:26,708
He's filling out
some paperwork.

1200
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,312
You jumped out a window?

1201
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:33,114
Yeah.

1202
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:35,483
But it was a second story.

1203
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,119
So...

1204
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:42,490
So, maybe it was
more of a statement than...

1205
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,125
an actual suicide attempt?

1206
01:07:44,127 --> 01:07:45,427
Mom, I went to grad school.

1207
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:47,495
I wasn't trying
to kill myself.

1208
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,533
Then what the hell
were you doing?

1209
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:53,535
I just need some attention.

1210
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:55,036
Oh...

1211
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:58,339
Well, you know, I'm really
not happy about this.

1212
01:07:58,341 --> 01:07:59,541
I'm really not happy.

1213
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:02,444
Nobody's happy, sweetie.

1214
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:04,446
I mean, everyone's just...

1215
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:06,748
They're just pretending.

1216
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:10,151
Anyway...

1217
01:08:10,153 --> 01:08:11,653
The important thing is...

1218
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,024
We, uh...

1219
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,529
We...

1220
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,064
We love you.

1221
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:27,168
What?

1222
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:28,169
What.

1223
01:08:28,171 --> 01:08:29,704
You've never
said that before.

1224
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:32,707
Well, maybe we should start.

1225
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:37,078
You always said
love is a revival

1226
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,147
of your own narcissism.

1227
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:42,083
It's a frivolous cliché
people use

1228
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:43,785
to make them feel better
about themselves.

1229
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:46,421
OK, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Michael.

1230
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:50,658
I don't fucking know
what I'm talking about.

1231
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:15,617
Hey, is everything OK?

1232
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,688
No.

1233
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,492
What are you doing?

1234
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:27,462
I'm meditating.

1235
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:32,300
How's that
working out for you?

1236
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:43,444
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

1237
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:44,812
How do you know?

1238
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:48,816
Your palms are sweating,
and you're shaking,

1239
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:52,587
and you have tunnel vision,
and I...

1240
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:53,788
I can't breathe.

1241
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,460
I have that all the time.

1242
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,463
You do?

1243
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:03,531
Yeah.

1244
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,367
Anxiety's kinda my thing.

1245
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,835
Oh, my God, me too.

1246
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:22,417
Is George home?

1247
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:26,487
No, he's out...

1248
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:27,722
For the day.

1249
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:30,491
Oh.

1250
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:32,560
Don't take it personally,
Charlie.

1251
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,628
You can't take it personally,

1252
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,463
or else it's all
gonna go to shit.

1253
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:37,632
You just got to put
your blinders on.

1254
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:39,234
That's what I do.

1255
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,642
Are there, I mean, others?

1256
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:50,845
Not in the building.

1257
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:57,652
So is this the arrangement?

1258
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:05,293
You know that idea that
everyone has that one person

1259
01:11:05,295 --> 01:11:07,195
that's out there,
that's gonna be exactly

1260
01:11:07,197 --> 01:11:09,497
what you've always wanted?

1261
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,768
I don't think that's true
for everyone.

1262
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:17,672
Neither do I.

1263
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,411
If you want me to stop,
I will.

1264
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:28,483
George and...

1265
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:31,319
I just want him to be happy.

1266
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:33,588
And you can give him
what I can't.

1267
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:44,499
How's your panic attack?

1268
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:49,237
This meditation thing
is fucking bullshit.

1269
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:50,538
I know.

1270
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,307
I much prefer drinking.

1271
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,312
I'm really glad
my husband's penis

1272
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:59,480
introduced us.

1273
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,215
I am, too.

1274
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,353
Don't get any paint
on the floor.

1275
01:12:05,355 --> 01:12:06,521
Your mom will kill us.

1276
01:12:06,523 --> 01:12:08,456
I paint for a living, Dad.

1277
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:12,193
Yeah, well you
track paint on the carpet,

1278
01:12:12,195 --> 01:12:14,662
she'll have an aneurysm.

1279
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,898
Which is why God
made paint remover.

1280
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:22,804
Adrian, I, I, I, uh...

1281
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:24,539
I need your help.

1282
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:25,840
With what?

1283
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:28,643
What's wrong?

1284
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:32,680
Are you sick?

1285
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,415
No.

1286
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:35,550
Is Mom sick?

1287
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:36,951
No, no, no.

1288
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,787
You need to crash with me?

1289
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:41,289
No. I...

1290
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:45,626
I can't get,
a goddamn erection.

1291
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:47,995
Shit.

1292
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:49,697
Yeah.

1293
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,967
Well, you've, um,
you've tried, um...

1294
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54,302
No, I've tried.

1295
01:12:54,304 --> 01:12:56,471
Yes, believe me, I've tried.

1296
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:57,805
Well, if you want I could...

1297
01:12:57,807 --> 01:13:00,308
I can probably get you
some stuff to help.

1298
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,776
No.

1299
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:03,244
Does that work?

1300
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:05,813
I don't know.
I've never, you know.

1301
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:07,615
But you can give it a shot.

1302
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,018
You'd do that for me?

1303
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,653
Sure, whatever.

1304
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,823
All right, then...

1305
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:17,358
Thanks.

1306
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,497
Changing the subject...

1307
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:23,798
Paint thinner.

1308
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,473
So what are you thinking
of naming the baby?

1309
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:37,478
Oh, um...

1310
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,013
Just, whatever.

1311
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:41,416
Robin...

1312
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:45,520
I was thinking Martha,
after Michael's grandmother.

1313
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:48,823
Or Timothy, if it's a boy.

1314
01:13:48,825 --> 01:13:51,426
But actually,
I really like Justin.

1315
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:58,299
I'm sorry.
What do you think?

1316
01:13:58,301 --> 01:14:00,301
I, I don't really care.

1317
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,037
I like Justin.

1318
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:04,772
- Justin's nice.
- Yeah.

1319
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,507
I like that one, yeah.

1320
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:10,378
Would anyone care
for a pig in a blanket?

1321
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,380
Oh, no, none for me,
thank you.

1322
01:14:12,382 --> 01:14:14,315
Robin's on a liquid diet.

1323
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:18,386
Oh, well, appetite is part
of the libido, you know.

1324
01:14:18,388 --> 01:14:22,457
Starvation is an unconscious
way of avoiding sexuality.

1325
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:24,492
Oh, well,
that would make sense.

1326
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:26,894
Sex and my husband
don't go hand in hand.

1327
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:28,896
Welcome to my world.

1328
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:32,567
Sometimes you just
need it though, right?

1329
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:33,768
Yeah.

1330
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:39,874
Actually, you know,
um, there are some people

1331
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:42,109
who go celibate
for years into their marriage

1332
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:46,681
to sublimate their libido,
to have more creative energy.

1333
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:49,650
Yeah, well, my husband
fucks other men, so...

1334
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:50,651
Oh.

1335
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,553
I actually
have my suspicions

1336
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:54,822
that he's top, and a bottom.

1337
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,824
He shaves his butthole.

1338
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:59,794
Charlie would know,
actually, better than me.

1339
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,800
That, that is,
so oversharing.

1340
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,005
So he's a bottom, isn't he?

From that place in Tribeca.
What was the name of that?

- They said any time.

1358
01:17:16,899 --> 01:17:19,967
- But I hate the sun.
- So we'll bring an umbrella.

1359

Uh, spend time together.

Isn't that

You don't want me anymore.

Don't react. Just listen.

1628
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,537
I have no idea.

1629
01:35:44,539 --> 01:35:46,773
What?

1630
01:35:46,775 --> 01:35:48,541
You fucked the maid.

1631
01:35:48,543 --> 01:35:49,776
I fucked your brother.

1632
01:35:49,778 --> 01:35:51,678
Whatever.

1633
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:54,914
Knock, knock.

1634
01:35:57,885 --> 01:35:59,953
Am I interrupting something?

1635
01:35:59,955 --> 01:36:03,790
I actually knew that you
fucked Adrian, Vivian.

1636
01:36:03,792 --> 01:36:06,126
I saw the painting...

1637
01:36:06,128 --> 01:36:07,560
A vagina.

1638
01:36:07,562 --> 01:36:09,028
A little abstract.

1639
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:10,730
I'm just gonna...

1640
01:36:10,732 --> 01:36:14,100
Yeah, well, I also found out
about the maid.

1641
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:17,971
Look, Michael...

1642
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:20,173
Can you pay attention?

1643
01:36:20,175 --> 01:36:21,775
OK.

1644
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:23,143
The maid was a mistake.

1645
01:36:23,145 --> 01:36:24,644
So was your brother.

1646
01:36:24,646 --> 01:36:29,649
Oh, Vivian, that is really,
really messed up.

1647
01:36:29,651 --> 01:36:31,718
Yeah, I agree.

1648
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:36,723
I guess, I just, um,
I don't know.

1649
01:36:36,725 --> 01:36:38,358
I was looking for attention
or something.

1650
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,859
You had mine.

1651
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:42,595
I do love you, Michael.

1652
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:48,668
I just don't know
if I want a child.

1653
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:52,605
I don't think I want to have
my brother's child.

1654
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:57,644
Hey, guys,
I really have to...

1655
01:36:57,646 --> 01:37:00,079
I think you should order
your French fries

1656
01:37:00,081 --> 01:37:02,015
and ice cream online.

1657
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:06,352
Why aren't you
yelling at me?

1658
01:37:06,354 --> 01:37:08,822
I don't know.

1659
01:37:08,824 --> 01:37:10,323
Well, I wish you would.

1660
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:14,394
You are a shitty wife.

1661
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:17,764
Do you know that?

1662
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,734
And I hate to say it,
but it is true.

1663
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:30,210
I know we talked
about it before, but...

1664
01:37:30,212 --> 01:37:35,181
This whole deal is not exactly
what I signed up for,

1665
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:36,983
you know?

1666
01:37:36,985 --> 01:37:38,685
I gotta pee.

1667
01:37:43,724 --> 01:37:45,291
Don't look at me.

1668
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,995
God, I can't
take this anymore!

1669
01:37:48,997 --> 01:37:54,434
I feel fat and sweaty,
and leaky and gross.

1670
01:37:54,436 --> 01:37:56,069
What is wrong with me?

1671
01:37:56,071 --> 01:37:58,438
You're pregnant.

1672
01:37:58,440 --> 01:37:59,906
That's just it, Charlie.

1673
01:37:59,908 --> 01:38:00,907
I can't be a mother.

1674
01:38:00,909 --> 01:38:02,208
I mean, look at me.

1675
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,743
I don't care
about anything enough.

1676
01:38:03,745 --> 01:38:04,744
It's, it's bad.

1677
01:38:04,746 --> 01:38:06,212
Aren't you excited?

1678
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:08,448
Yeah, for all the wrong reasons.

1679
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:10,383
Like, I would like
40 cigarettes, OK,

1680
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:12,018
and a shot of tequila.

1681
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:15,255
Uh-oh.

1682
01:38:15,257 --> 01:38:16,756
Are you all right?

1683
01:38:16,758 --> 01:38:20,026
I think-
I think it's gonna...

1684
01:38:20,028 --> 01:38:22,028
Promise me one thing, OK?

1685
01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:24,964
If anything happens,
that you'll take care of him.

1686
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:29,002
Oh, Minkel...

1687
01:38:29,004 --> 01:38:30,303
Yes, absolutely.

1688
01:38:30,305 --> 01:38:32,272
I'll help you guys
any way I can.

1689
01:38:32,274 --> 01:38:34,474
No, I meant...

1690
01:38:34,476 --> 01:38:36,175
Fuck, ow!

1691
01:38:36,177 --> 01:38:37,710
Oh, never mind.

1692
01:38:37,712 --> 01:38:38,945
Just get the suitcase.

1693
01:38:38,947 --> 01:38:39,946
Fuck.

1694
01:38:39,948 --> 01:38:41,114
It's OK.

1695
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:47,387
Viv.

1696
01:38:48,956 --> 01:38:51,190
Viv, the door is stuck again.
Get me out.

1697
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:55,061
Vivian!

1698
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:59,032
Vivian, the door
got stuck again!

1699
01:39:05,472 --> 01:39:07,340
I don't even know
if the doctor is here.

1700
01:39:07,342 --> 01:39:10,009
We've got to get this pain
killer situation worked out.

1701
01:39:10,011 --> 01:39:11,811
- Back off!
- All right.

1702
01:39:11,813 --> 01:39:13,212
No, wait! Come here!

1703
01:39:13,214 --> 01:39:15,315
I need, I need...
I need some pain killers.

1704
01:39:15,317 --> 01:39:18,051
What can I have at this stage?
The contractions are starting--

1705
01:39:18,053 --> 01:39:19,319
She's a little uncomfortable.

1706
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:20,753
Do you have anything...

1707
01:39:20,755 --> 01:39:23,890
Oh! Oh, give me something!

1708
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:31,030
Oh, that hurts.

1709
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:38,104
I love smoking pot
in the morning.

1710
01:39:38,106 --> 01:39:41,207
I love taking body shots
off of strangers.

1711
01:39:43,177 --> 01:39:45,445
I can't love this baby yet.

1712
01:39:46,513 --> 01:39:47,947
I won't love it.

1713
01:39:47,949 --> 01:39:50,083
No, you don't know that.

1714
01:39:51,852 --> 01:39:54,187
I know you'd love it
enough for both of us.

1715
01:39:55,356 --> 01:39:56,889
Me?

1716
01:39:57,858 --> 01:39:59,926
Michael wants the baby, Viv.

1717
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:04,063
I don't even know if it's his.

1718
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:08,034
I can't take care of a baby.

1719
01:40:08,936 --> 01:40:11,337
You're the most
put together person I know.

1720
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:15,541
That is super sad.

1721
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:21,948
I'm a mother
that's not a mother.

1722
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:23,149
That's sad.

1723
01:40:29,823 --> 01:40:31,491
Ah!

1724
01:40:34,995 --> 01:40:36,896
All right, let's have
you push, OK?

1725
01:40:36,898 --> 01:40:38,297
Go ahead. Push.

1726
01:40:38,299 --> 01:40:39,899
All right, doing good.

1727
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:41,067
Let's have one more on three.

1728
01:40:41,069 --> 01:40:43,302
One... two... three...

1729
01:40:43,304 --> 01:40:46,172
OK... Go.

1730
01:40:46,174 --> 01:40:47,907
You did it.

1731
01:40:47,909 --> 01:40:49,175
Hold it.

1732
01:40:49,177 --> 01:40:50,543
No!

1733
01:40:56,316 --> 01:40:57,850
You did it.

1734
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:11,030
Aw, hey.

1735
01:41:11,032 --> 01:41:12,432
Yeah.

1736
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:24,944
How did that happen?

1737
01:41:25,946 --> 01:41:28,081
Some guy she met on the
missed connections

1738
01:41:28,083 --> 01:41:31,451
section of Craigslist.

1739
01:41:31,453 --> 01:41:33,252
Oh, I love that section.

1740
01:41:33,254 --> 01:41:35,421
I go there all the time.

1741
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:37,223
You do?

1742
01:41:37,225 --> 01:41:41,360
Oh, not for sex...

1743
01:41:41,362 --> 01:41:46,099
I just, I just go there to see
if anybody will notice me.

1744
01:41:47,301 --> 01:41:49,302
Wow, that is so sad.

1745
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:51,504
And so me.

1746
01:41:57,478 --> 01:41:59,112
You left him.

1747
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:04,183
I did.

1748
01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:07,487
Are you having
a panic attack?

1749
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:12,492
No.

1750
01:42:12,494 --> 01:42:13,926
Do you want a Zanex?

1751
01:42:13,928 --> 01:42:16,929
No. No...

1752
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:19,699
This is good.

1753
01:42:21,001 --> 01:42:22,201
I'm good.

1754
01:42:23,237 --> 01:42:25,371
I ate an entire box of pizza.

1755
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:28,374
I feel liberated.

1756
01:42:31,945 --> 01:42:34,113
How's the baby?

1757
01:42:34,115 --> 01:42:35,414
He's good.

1758
01:42:35,416 --> 01:42:38,184
He's cute...

1759
01:42:38,186 --> 01:42:39,519
New...

1760
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:43,356
Asian.

1761
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:46,392
How's your brother?

1762
01:42:47,361 --> 01:42:49,629
Oh, my God, Michael!

1763
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:51,497
Michael!

1764
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:54,167
Charlie, I'm in the bathroom.

1765
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:55,468
Are you OK?

1766
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:59,505
You gotta pull up
on the door and then open it.

1767
01:43:05,045 --> 01:43:06,379
Where did you go?

1768
01:43:06,381 --> 01:43:07,413
Well...

1769
01:43:07,415 --> 01:43:09,549
We had to go to the hospital.

1770
01:43:09,551 --> 01:43:11,050
Is everything all right?

1771
01:43:11,052 --> 01:43:13,085
Yeah.

1772
01:43:14,154 --> 01:43:15,521
You OK?
