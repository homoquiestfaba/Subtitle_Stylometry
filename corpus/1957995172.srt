1
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,843
- So the story goes,

2
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,745
that once upon a yesterday,

3
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:46,213
way back in the dry ages,

4
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,150
ducks ruled the Earf until
some Beat God dude named

5
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,754
Beat Massa X came down from the
stars

6
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:55,623
and brought the blood
sport Beat-Beat Revelation

7
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:58,158
and a comet full of booze to our
world.

8
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,330
He enslaved the ducks with
the fear of being flipped

9
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,465
straight edge again on the spot.

10
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,736
Because as we all know, without
no booze,

11
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,672
they would become un-drunk.

12
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:14,742
The Beat Massa descended upon
them with his unstoppable

13
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:19,379
army of L Black D's and
187ed the known duck world,

14
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,382
in what we now know as the Beat
Wars.

15
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:27,421
And when da land was sucked dry
of all of her fossil boozies

16
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,157
the Beat Massa began the cycle
anew.

17
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,426
The Wet Shit swept across the
land.

18
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,529
187-ing all the peeps,

19
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,864
And 911-ing Mother Earf,

20
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:39,266
refilling the fossil boozies

21
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,402
for the new race of enslaved
peeps to mine for him

22
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,338
all over again.

23
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,238
Us.

24
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,278
In the Wastes of the old
world, Beat-Beat Revelation

25
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,714
is still the only way of life.

26
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:57,619
Where the ultimate prize is the
Quatro,

27
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:59,286
or booze as it was once known.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,591
Whoever controls the
Quatro, controls the Wastes.

29
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:08,630
And only one Quatro oasis
remains; the FP, our home.

30
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:12,867
My name is JTRO.

31
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,335
I'm a RE-NINJ.

32
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,239
A Beat Warrior like my father
before me.

33
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,742
In the many battles we fought,

34
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:24,879
beating off the rage fueled
followers of Beat Massa X,

35
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:27,882
we lost many loved ones.

36
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,788
Until I met CHAI-T,

37
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,390
The Beat Battle Queen from the
Wastes

38
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:40,360
who strengthened the FP with
her tribe of Warrior Ninjawas

39
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:43,296
and helped us finally
bring peace to the FP.

40
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:45,767
Shit was chill.

41
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:47,735
We threw some pups.

42
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,873
Our daughter, CHAI-TRO grew
into a strong young Beat-offer.

43
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,913
But sadly, due to some health
politics,

44
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,783
her brother, JR-TRO took
a dirt nap at birth.

45
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,719
Time passed

46
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,590
until CHAI-TRO discovered
she could beat through time

47
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:12,426
with her feet on her 18th BD.

48
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:15,963
She ventured into the past,

49
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,968
helping us destroy Beat
Massa X's booze comet

50
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:22,770
that was poisoning our Earf.

51
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:28,442
And together, as a family,
we defeated L DUBBA E.

52
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,649
Finally eliminating the Beat
Massa's only remaining weapon

53
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:35,950
from the Beat Wars.

54
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,520
But our cycle's time has finally
come.

55
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,422
The Wet Shit,

56
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,726
a never ending storm
of sobriety from which

57
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,927
there ain't no cure,

58
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,864
has swept across the entire Earf

59
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,299
and is on the FP's doorstep.

60
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,670
Can we save the FP in time?

61
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:00,842
Or will we become stone cold
sober 4Evz?

62
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:53,928
- Duck marks the spot.

63
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,098
- So this is CHAI-QUACK-TICA,
huh?

64
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,331
- What's left of it.

65
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,642
- It's thought it would
be a little bit bigger

66
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,877
considering it used to be the
most advanced civilization

67
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,646
on Earf or whatevz.

68
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,749
- Well, it was once upon a long
ago.

69
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,618
- Yeah. Now no one even
remembers 'em.

70
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,763
- Ducks marks the spot.

71
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,140
Follow my beats, carefs.

72
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:04,819
- Stank!
Whoopsiedooz!

73
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,187
Floppy twat step!

74
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,125
- Balance, yo.

75
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,827
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,637
So do you really think what
we're looking for is here?

77
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,173
- The prophecy was hided
here by the Way Backs.

78
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,642
And only the descendies of
the Way Backs can find it

79
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:29,543
here again.

80
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:31,078
- Oh boy.

81
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,200
Okay, so now what?

82
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,743
- Two, four, eight.

83
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,213
Two pads.

84
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,582
Two peeps.

85
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:09,283
- Too easy.

86
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,962
- Left arrow, right arrow.

87
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,031
- Interesting.

88
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,704
- Three, two, one.

89
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,045
- Okay, well that sounded good.

90
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,213
Now what, four?

91
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,254
- Left arrow, down arrow.

92
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:50,057
- Right arrow, up arrow.

93
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,665
Okay, I'm picking up
what you're laying down.

94
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:58,766
- Copy-roo.

95
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,768
Eightses.

96
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,309
- All.

97
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,044
- All.

98
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,417
- Two, four, eight.

99
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,286
Combo mode unlocked.

100
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,222
- That means don't miss any.

101
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:24,325
- Yeah, I know what that means.

102
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,860
- Three,

103
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,328
two,

104
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,229
one.

105
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,298
Beat-Beat.

106
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:32,333
- Here goes nothing!

107
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,799
Easy. We're on the same team!

108
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,034
- Then keep up.

109
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,840
- Ahh, fuck me.

110
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,730
- Chill.

111
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:37,998
- You gassed?

112
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,833
- I'm not gassed,

113
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,235
I'm just breathing.

114
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,369
- You look gassed.

115
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,243
- JTRO, my youngling.

116
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,813
You has finally come.

117
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,751
- Mom?

118
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,922
- I am her memzies.

119
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:05,759
Left behind to guide y'all
when the time came a-do.

120
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,361
- Time for what a-do?

121
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,763
- Your final battle.

122
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:14,168
The one that decides the
fate of all our peeps.

123
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,136
- Stopping the Wet Shit, right,
I know.

124
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,505
- Faleses.

125
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:20,841
There is no stopping the Wet
Shit.

126
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,944
The Wet Shit is the
planet's defense system

127
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:27,014
leading to a wet age that
reboots the Earf

128
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,283
and refills the Quatro.

129
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,852
It 187'd the ducks

130
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:36,023
as it will y'all if you fails.

131
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,225
- How do we save our peeps?

132
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:42,830
- There is hope. A cure for your
peeps.

133
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,966
The Fountain of 4Evz,

134
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,005
where Bloody Quatro brews
with the power of re-life, yo.

135
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,275
- Wait, so where do we
find this Fountain of 4Evz?

136
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,477
- Not, wherezies.

137
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:58,112
Whenzies.

138
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,413
- Okay, then whenzies?

139
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,949
- The Zero Dark.

140
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:05,019
- The futies.

141
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,420
- Correcty.

142
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,389
Beyond your time.

143
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,325
It hasn't activated in yours
yet,

144
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:15,829
but take heed, unlocking
the Fountain of 4Evz

145
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:18,132
will also unlock him.

146
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,034
- Who?

147
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,902
- Take the Quad-Force.

148
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,307
It will show you the way.

149
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,009
Only the Duckborne can save the
Earf.

150
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:36,016
Take the Quad-Force, it
will show you the way.

151
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,554
Only the Duckborne can save the
Earf.

152
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:40,888
- Mom!

153
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,089
Mom!

154
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,169
- You fresh?

155
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,106
- I never even knew what
she looked like before.

156
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,142
- She had a pretty
cracking rig for a holo-do.

157
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,277
- Yeah, she did.

158
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,294
So, do you know what any of that
means?

159
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,363
- Just the hot goss.

160
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,098
We should get this back to DC.

161
00:14:57,632 --> 00:15:00,134
- Ducks in a barrel.

162
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,014
- Chromedome,

163
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,550
come on back.

164
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:22,657
Trailer Henge, hola.

165
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,497
Anyone at the 248?

166
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,534
Anybody in the 2-4-8?

167
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:38,573
Fuck.

168
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:52,419
Hasta la vista.

169
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:57,525
- She's so
jealous of my hot looks.

170
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,695
She's always fucking worried
that I'm hotter than her.

171
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:01,563
She's right!

172
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:03,397
- Fokliff!

173
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,669
- Time travel? How 'bout I
go back, time travel to my

174
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:11,338
trailer and fucking kick your
ass the way I should have!

175
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:14,542
- So you sent me back in time
so I could tell younger youse

176
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:18,078
and dadzies that y'all
got 10 365s to find a way

177
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,514
to stop the Wet Shit?

178
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:22,584
- Well, technically you sent
yourself back through time.

179
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:25,018
But, yeah, paraphrase.

180
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:25,720
- Hevz.

181
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:26,788
Did it work?

182
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,322
- TBD, yo.

183
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,456
- Well, now what?

184
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,694
- Now we wait for Uncle DC
to interpret the prophecy

185
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:34,629
and then we does what we always
do.

186
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:37,765
The impossy.

187
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:41,736
- Yo.

188
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:42,937
- Yo, Dad-TRO.

189
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:46,574
You really think we're tuff
enough to 187 Beat Massa X?

190
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:49,711
- Winning's not about strength,
CHAI-TRO.

191
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,213
It's about patience and
commitment.

192
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,683
- That's hevz.

193
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,521
- Beliee' dat.

194
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,694
- You rents is always so cryptic
and shit.

195
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:09,531
- A fool who says more than is
necessary

196
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:11,699
only proves that he is weak and
shit.

197
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:18,372
- You're late.
- I know.

198
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,107
I know.

199
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,108
What can I get you?

200
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:22,744
- Me?

201
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,446
- Yeah, you're over 18.

202
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,582
You're awake.

203
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,316
What can I get you?

204
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,288
You know, they say

205
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,558
the perfect drink

206
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:42,095
can help you see the future
and help you erase your past.

207
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:44,532
- The right drink has nothing to
prove.

208
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:48,201
The right drink answers
questions before you even ask.

209
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,203
You heard?
- Yeah, I heard!

210
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,405
- You heard, but do you listen?

211
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,776
- Yes, I listen! Oh my god, dad!

212
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:59,814
The fucking Wastes are up
to their fucking eyeballs

213
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:02,115
in the Wet Shit!

214
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:06,688
And whether you like it or
not, in fucking 7 HRS's,

215
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,690
so are we!

216
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:11,258
You can't get away from
it, it's impossible!

217
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,594
You heard that?

218
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:14,729
- Yeah. I'm not deaf, AK.

219
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,265
Here, sip this.

220
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:25,405
Now, what does that drink tell
you?

221
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,341
- That

222
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,178
the impossible is just
something quitters made up

223
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,615
to feel better about themselves.

224
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:37,451
- Sentence and quitting rolls to
Rage.

225
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:40,922
- I'll drink to that.

226
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:43,457
- You'll drink to anything,
you're an alcoholic.

227
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,227
- And I got that from you.
You're my father. So...

228
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,197
- Doctor said not to drink!

229
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:06,748
- Alright, hit me, what have we
got?

230
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:10,818
- A'ight gather round.

231
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:13,220
It's prophecy mode up in here,
bitch.

232
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,357
Closer.

233
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:20,260
Reading all this quack
makes my ass all tender, yo.

234
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:28,435
Yo!

235
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,439
This ain't the post-apocalypse.

236
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:36,209
It's the post-POST-apocalypse.

237
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:39,446
The Earf 187'd twice
cause of the Wet Shit.

238
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,883
And if it 187's thrice-

239
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:42,950
- Hashtag time's up.

240
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:44,317
- Beliee' dat!

241
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,755
- All right, so what's the
prophecy say?

242
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,657
- Y'all pronouncing it wrong.

243
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:52,359
The Quad-Force ain't no
prophesy,

244
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,895
it's a proph-e-key.

245
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:56,396
- What?

246
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,506
- There is four pieces of the
Quad-Force.

247
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,440
Balance,

248
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:08,776
expeditiousness,

249
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:10,845
aggression,

250
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:12,947
and tempo.

251
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,483
Combined, they unlock
the Fountain of 4Evz,

252
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,653
where the Bloody Quatro flows.

253
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:22,023
The booze of resurrection
itself that brings life and joy

254
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,791
back to the un-lifed, yo.

255
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:28,996
And it slumbers deep
down in the Zero Dark.

256
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,767
In the post-post-POST-apocalypse
and shit.

257
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:35,536
- Jesus-lou-esus.

258
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,943
- But the Bloody Quatro you seek
slumbers

259
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:45,479
in the Fountain of 4Evz
comes with its ass a price.

260
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:50,350
Cause it's the very blood
of the Beat Massa X himself.

261
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,527
CHAI-LATTAY told me a time
would come when I'd have to

262
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,962
lay some knowledge on y'all.

263
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:04,464
Now here I is ready to lay it.

264
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,337
Your mother could also beat
through time,

265
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,906
for she was Duckborne.

266
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,043
As are you, CHAI-TRO.

267
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,679
- Duck what?

268
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:21,048
- Duck Legend tells of a She-Ro
of time

269
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:22,817
known as the Duckborne.

270
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:24,986
- Okay.

271
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,989
- A warrior with the body of a
mortal

272
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:30,490
and the blood and soul of a
duck,

273
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:34,595
whose destiny is to help
187 the evil Beat Massa X

274
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:36,798
once and for all, yo.

275
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:37,632
- What?

276
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:40,034
- All right guys, look, lighten
up.

277
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,903
Are you guys actually fucking
for real with this shit

278
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:42,837
right now?

279
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,705
- This shit's as real as it
gets, JTRO.

280
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,075
It was your mother's duty

281
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:51,746
to beat through time to this
world to defeat Beat Massa X.

282
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,917
CHAI-LATTAY whooped his ass.

283
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,952
Locked him up tight, threw away
the key.

284
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:01,088
- The proph-e-key!

285
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:05,392
- But your mother new
BMX would return, JTRO.

286
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:09,730
As long as the Comet of
Dawn poisoned the Earf,

287
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:10,898
the cycle continues.

288
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,669
The Wet Shit covers the land

289
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:17,572
and Bloody Quatro begin to flow.

290
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:22,610
Re-lifing his ass again
and again and again.

291
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,679
- The fuck are we supposed to do
about it?

292
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:26,747
- She said you'd know when the
time came.

293
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:30,885
But them wheels of time is
rolling, JTRO.

294
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:34,555
It's time we roll together.

295
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,697
- Whoa.

296
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,031
But, I mean, real talk.

297
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:47,467
This shit's pretty bev, hey.

298
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,671
- This shit is a full on duck
blur, yo.

299
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:52,139
- Tell me about it.

300
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:53,406
Now what?

301
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:57,078
- Intruder, yo.
Intruder, yo.

302
00:22:57,111 --> 00:23:00,014
Intruder, yo. Intruder, yo.

303
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,082
- We got company, Yo.

304
00:23:01,115 --> 00:23:03,618
- Then I guess it's about
time we address the duck

305
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,052
in the room.

306
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,070
Who the fuck are you and
what the fuck do you think

307
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:24,071
you're doing in my town?

308
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:28,709
- I'm the weapon of mass
duck-struction, Mr. FP.

309
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,578
So don't make my ass quack!

310
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,179
- What the duck?

311
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:34,582
- I've come for the Duckborne.

312
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:38,085
So toss her on over
and shit won't get wet.

313
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,921
- Come on over here and
I'll show you wet, asshole.

314
00:23:39,954 --> 00:23:41,956
- 187, y'all, 187, y'all!

315
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:48,663
- There you go,
TRO-splaining my fucking ass.

316
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:49,797
Condescending cunt.

317
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,700
- Don't you TRO me unless
you know me, motherfucker.

318
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,035
- Oh, shit!

319
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,136
- Calm-a-do.

320
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,705
- This is calm-a-do.

321
00:23:57,738 --> 00:23:59,707
- Mo' fuckas love running they
mouths til some one shoves

322
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,075
some dirt down they throats.

323
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:02,977
- Shut his fucking mouth!

324
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,746
- The Duckborne or your town,
Mr. FP.

325
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,814
Click, Click!

326
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:07,982
What's it going to be?

327
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:09,250
- Shoot his ass!

328
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:12,954
- Face down and wet or face up
and dry?

329
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:15,656
- Shoot his other eye, for
fuck's sake!

330
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,159
- I ain't going to call all
fucking day.

331
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:19,860
- You going to do something?

332
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:21,128
Or am I going to have to
walk over there and make you

333
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:21,829
do something?

334
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:23,631
- Bap, bap, bap, motherfucker!

335
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:25,266
- Fuck it. Let's bop.

336
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,133
- A'ight.

337
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,069
Bang!

338
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:29,503
Blap!

339
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:30,171
Toasty!

340
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:31,038
- Dadzies!

341
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:31,906
Sik!

342
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,008
King Killa!

343
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,076
De-LOOXE!

344
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:36,510
- Whoooow!

345
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:37,645
Hit a house!

346
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:39,680
- Fuck this!

347
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,285
- I'll wait here.

348
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:58,165
- Yo, 187, yo!

349
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,600
Yeah!

350
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:02,703
- Take that, duck-duck bitch!

351
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:05,840
- What's a matter with
you, you duck fucker?

352
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:07,174
- Fuck duck fucker!

353
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:11,078
- Knock that motherfucker out!

354
00:25:11,112 --> 00:25:14,615
- Put him in a body bag!

355
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:16,083
- Now start quacking, duck face.

356
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:17,651
- Come on!

357
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:19,687
- What the fuck are you doing in
my town?

358
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,055
- You know.

359
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:21,922
This.

360
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:22,857
Click, Click!

361
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:25,760
- Dadzies!

362
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,535
- You on the up and up?

363
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:36,971
- Feel like I just got throat
fucked by a sledgehammer.

364
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,105
- Dadzie!

365
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:40,074
- Hey! I'll fuckin' shoot you!

366
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:40,941
- Yo rentz!

367
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:41,642
- No!

368
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:44,145
Oh, you sloppy fucking drongo!

369
00:25:44,178 --> 00:25:45,846
- Dadzie!

370
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,648
- Just go. I'll catch up.

371
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:51,318
Fuck!

372
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,962
- Oh, shit!

373
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:04,365
- Yo rentz! Dadzies!

374
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:05,699
- Three,

375
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:06,934
two,

376
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:08,135
one,

377
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:10,137
remix!

378
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,268
- Oh geez. What?

379
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:42,269
Where the fuck am I?

380
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:43,904
- Atop of me! Get off!

381
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:45,072
- Geez, sorry.

382
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:46,841
Sorry, it's my first time
travel.

383
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:51,145
Where are they?

384
00:26:52,947 --> 00:26:54,682
- I don't understand.

385
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:56,250
I was right behind them.

386
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,385
- Okay, fine.

387
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:01,222
All right, let's just focus
on what we know right now.

388
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:04,959
Which I guess is fucking
nothing, right?

389
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:06,694
- We need to calm-a-do.

390
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:07,728
Refresh-ifie.

391
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:10,798
At least we have the Quad-Force.

392
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,968
- Yeah, about that. Um...

393
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:20,241
I think CHAI-TRO had it when
that WMD dude fucking took her.

394
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:23,010
- So we've lost our
little CHAI and we've lost

395
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,278
the Quad-Force.

396
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:31,252
- The future, huh? Far out.

397
00:27:32,186 --> 00:27:35,856
- JTRO, come-a-do.
- Okay.

398
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:41,028
Are you okay?

399
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:43,430
I didn't say anything.

400
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,401
Is that CHAI-TRO's?

401
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:50,304
- This way.

402
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,373

They're all gone.

420
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,909
- We never came home.

421
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:02,202
- Without CHAI-TRO, we can't
activate the remix again.

422
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:34,301
- BTRO's death wasn't your
fault.

423
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:36,270
It was his.

424
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:38,405
He wasn't expecting the
unexpected.

425
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:42,544
But it sure as fuck
expected him, you heard?

426
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:47,047
And now yo ass is here so you
won't make the same mistakes.

427
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:49,316
In order to master
Beat-Beat, you gots to master

428
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,052
the four rules of the B.E.A.T.

429
00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:56,023
Gots to keep your shit straight.

430
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:58,258
All evened out and dialed in to
the end

431
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:01,261
no matter what slaps you
upside the cock-sucker.

432
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:06,367
Never ignorant and getting
goals accomplished.

433
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,104
- Yo.

434
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,941
Yo, JTRO.

435
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,511
- Yo.

436
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:18,145
- So it's true.

437
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:19,113
You lost her.

438
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:20,214
- I didn't lose her.

439
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:22,650
- Well, she ain't here. So...

440
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:25,219
In fact,

441
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:28,989
you ain't never brought
her around to see us.

442
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,191
- She wouldn't understand.

443
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:34,428
I mean, you guys,

444
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:38,332
everything we went through
together,

445
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:42,369
it was like another life.

446
00:31:42,403 --> 00:31:44,639
- It wasn't another
life, it was this life!

447
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:46,440
And it still is, JTRO.

448
00:31:46,473 --> 00:31:48,308
- I don't know how to spit
this shit easy, A'ight,

449
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:49,611
I'm just going to blast it.

450
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:54,348
If you lose, little
CHAI-TRO, if you lose her,

451
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:58,152
it's done.

452
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:02,524
Everything is D-U-N, dun.

453
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:04,024
- Forgetting who you was,

454
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:05,359
forgetting who we was;

455
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,462
that's what's made you weak,
dog.

456
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:09,531
- Word!

457
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:14,067
Yo, things only appear
impossible when you forget

458
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,970
how you got here in the first
place, son.

459
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:18,472
- That's some real shit, JTRO.

460
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,341
- I don't know what to tell you
guys.

461
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:23,310
I'm fucking old now.

462
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:28,015
I'm not climbing anymore.

463
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,385
Just feels like I'm falling.

464
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:35,088
Waiting to hit the ground.

465
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,724
- Falling is an accident.

466
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:39,527
Getting back up, that's
a fucking choice, JTRO.

467
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:41,529
- Balance,

468
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:43,297
expeditiousness,

469
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,364
aggression,

470
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:45,466
tempo.

471
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:47,702
JTRO, that is what matters.

472
00:32:47,735 --> 00:32:49,504
Did you forget about that shit?

473
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,407
Forget about us?

474
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,610
- The only one you're going
to be beatin' off is yourself.

475
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:57,110
- Oh, whatevz.

476
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,213
I'm going to go save my fucking
daughter.

477
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:01,348
I'm waking off. Peace.

478
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:10,357
- You tink that worked?

479
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,626
- Mmhmm.

480
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:13,026
- Still got it.

481
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:17,264
- Tanks.

482
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:18,165
- You're welcs.

483
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,267
Any time, Sis-TRO.

484
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,473
- Wow, she's bev.

485
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,144
- Legs go all the way to the
butt.

486
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:38,520
Yo!

487
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:45,058
- Yo, if y'all peepin' this
shit, it means we're all froze.

488
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:47,327
Stone sober as F.

489
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:50,430
A tsunami of Wet Shit
is on the FP's doorstep.

490
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:54,434
But it's all good cause
this is how the proph-e-key

491
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:55,335
say it do.

492
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:58,740
If my calculations is correct,

493
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:00,274
by the time y'all see this shit,

494
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:03,377
WMD and CHAI-TRO's nearing PMC
territory

495
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,347
up north in the 242 where the
wet shit goes all cold, yo.

496
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:10,484
If you find they ass, you'll
find the Fountain of 4Evz.

497
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:14,656
Don't be fearing, JTRO.

498
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:16,356
We all good here in the rewind.

499
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,860
We just got to take a long
ass nap and sort our shit out

500
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,695
till y'all wake us up.

501
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:22,296
See you soon, Ninj.

502
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:23,798
Miss yo ass.

503
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,768
Shit!

504
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:28,302
Peace, hologram.

505
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:30,070
Shit!

506
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:39,747
- Somethin's walk aboutin'.

507
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:41,381
- What kind of somethin'?

508
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:44,552
Oh, fuck me.

509
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,426
Hey.

510
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:55,095
Yo, you guys from around here?

511
00:35:11,546 --> 00:35:14,749
- Just so you know,
this is your faultzies.

512
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,451
We should have runzied.

513
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:19,353
- Oh, come on. It's not
my fault that shit's tough

514
00:35:19,386 --> 00:35:20,454
in the Zero Dark.

515
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:22,724
- Calm-a-do.

516
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:24,157
We'll figure it out.

517
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:26,393
We always do.

518
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:27,862
- Oh, what, you ain't fearing?

519
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:29,631
- I ain't even half fearing.

520
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,498
And neither would the JTRO I
first met.

521
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:34,234
- The JTRO you first met
didn't have so many miles

522
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:35,637
not so carefully driven on him
either.

523
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,209
To the death?

524
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:46,914
- Excuse me?

525
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:55,723
- So you half fearing now?

526
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:17,444
- Good morning, Cranberry juice.

527
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:20,213
- Don't you Cranberry juice me,
duck boy.

528
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:23,350
- Duck man to you, home girl.

529
00:36:25,687 --> 00:36:27,689
- What the Quad-Force?

530
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:29,691
That shit's mine! Give me
backsies!

531
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:31,726
- Ain't giving you backsies
nothin'.

532
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:32,627
Shit's mine.

533
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,461
Fair and circle, boo-itch!

534
00:36:34,494 --> 00:36:36,931
- Oh, and you tie me if you
knew it was real fair, huh?

535
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:38,231
- And circle.

536
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,836
- You're a weirdo. You know
that, right?

537
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,303
- I'm dope as fuck

538
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:44,539
I do what I want.

539
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:46,874
- I'm dope a fuck. I do what I
want!

540
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:47,842
You're a weirdo.

541
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,343
- You don't do shit.
You're tied up as fuck.

542
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:51,612
I'm doing whatever the fuck I
want,

543
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:53,280
when I want.

544
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:54,682
- Cringe.

545
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:57,284
What the fuck you doing
hauling my ass around all these

546
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:59,520
mountains through all this cold
shit, hey?

547
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:00,621
You got the Quad-Force.

548
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:02,523
Do your thing.

549
00:37:02,557 --> 00:37:04,357
Peace the fuck off.

550
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:06,359
- Cause this bullshit ass
shit don't do shit without

551
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,896
your dumb Duckborne ass.

552
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,965
Only you can open the Fountain
of 4Evz.

553
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,700
- Then give it.

554
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:14,001
- Nah. I'm good.

555
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:18,673
- How about you untie me and
we'll find out how good you is.

556
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:22,043
One second with my paws
free and youse is dead.

557
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:24,344
I'm the She-Ro of time, duck
head.

558
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:44,397
- I can't even with all this.

559
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,266
Where the fuck is my life right
now?

560
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:50,872
- Just another step on a
never ending journey, JTRO.

561
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:51,773
- Jesus.

562
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:54,675
How did it come to this?

563
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:57,044
- Why don't you look back every
once a-do?

564
00:37:57,078 --> 00:37:58,546
And memberz?

565
00:37:58,579 --> 00:37:59,446
- Remember what?

566
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:03,383
It's not like my life ever
really made too much sense.

567
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:07,889
I mean, the first what,
18 years of my life,

568
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:10,792
I was just some dip-shit kid
who grew up on some dirt road

569
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:12,560
in the middle of nowhere.

570
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:14,762
I didn't even know it
was the post-apocalypse.

571
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,429
- Post-post-apocy.

572
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,431
- Okay, yeah, exactly.

573
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:19,534
And now look at me.

574
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,903
What, I have magical powers,

575
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:25,673
some time remixing
She-Ro of time daughter?

576
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:29,010
And I'm what, trying to stop
some ancient Beat God tyrant

577
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:31,512
from reawakening, who
wants to destroy the Earf

578
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:32,412
in the future?

579
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:33,581
- Okay.

580
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:36,818
We have a daughter and we're
trying to save the world.

581
00:38:37,952 --> 00:38:39,854
This is our story.

582
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:42,857
And you don't even know half of
it.

583
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,126
- Come on. What is that supposed
to mean?

584
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,595
- Do you even know that
I'm from another planet?

585
00:38:47,628 --> 00:38:49,630
- Wait, what the fuck? You are?

586
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:50,765
- Yes.

587
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:52,700
It's part of what makes me me.

588
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:57,071
- Okay, look, CHAI,

589
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,474
I've always told you that
I fell for who you is.

590
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:04,612
Whatever happened to us in our
past,

591
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,081
it doesn't matter.

592
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:09,817
- Well, it should.

593
00:39:11,853 --> 00:39:14,021
Cause that's how life works,
JTRO.

594
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:19,392
It's a whole series of
whack-a-doo events that makes

595
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:22,096
fuck all sense at the time
that somehow always lead us

596
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:23,231
to today.

597
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:27,568
And you reflect on the
experiences of those wack-a-doos

598
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:29,136
so you can get to tomorrow.

599
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:33,875
Or you can just ignore all that
shit

600
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:38,746
and keep making the same
mistakes 4Evz.

601
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:42,149
It's your choice.

602
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,758
- Got any ideas?

603
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,927
- If we don't beat off to the
death,

604
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,595
they'll 187 us both.

605
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:29,897
- Nobody dies today.

606
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:30,798
- Then keep up.

607
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:34,969
- Tres.

608
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:36,504
Dos.

609
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:38,139
Uno!

610
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:40,741
Beat-Beat!

611
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:19,413
So you got a plan?

612
00:41:19,447 --> 00:41:20,514
Or are we just going to sit
here and beat each other off

613
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:21,515
all night?

614
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,617
- I don't have time for that.

615
00:41:27,555 --> 00:41:28,289
- Hey, take it easy.

616
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:29,223
- This is easy.

617
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:31,025
- Okay, we really doing this
right now?

618
00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:31,959
Okay.

619
00:41:35,696 --> 00:41:36,530
Don't do this, CHAI.

620
00:41:36,564 --> 00:41:38,699
Don't make me pull out the trick
shit.

621
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:39,834
- Please.

622
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,268
You haven't pulled out the
trick shit in a whole pile

623
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:42,903
of 365s.

624
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,681
- What are you trying to prove?
We're too old for this shit.

625
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:57,284
- Oh, enough of this too
old, blah, blah, blah, shite.

626
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:58,986
I'm sick of it!

627
00:42:03,758 --> 00:42:06,527
Remember who you is and
youse can do anything.

628
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:10,131
I know why youse is afraid of
chattin' about the past, JTRO.

629
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:13,334
Because it reminds you
how much time has passed

630
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,870
and how little you think we have
left.

631
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:18,672
But pretending to be who you
ain't

632
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:20,241
is what makes you old JTRO.

633
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:25,813
Beat-Beat is in our blood, yo.

634
00:42:25,846 --> 00:42:27,314
It always has been.

635
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:29,316
It always will be.

636
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,787
So stop letting time
tell you you're D-U-N.

637
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,756
You tell time when you're D-U-N
with it.

638
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:41,729
Now let's go hundo P, JTRO.

639
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:42,763
To the end.

640
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:43,664
A'ight?

641
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:07,721
Chill.

642
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:31,745
- Mi familia!

643
00:43:33,848 --> 00:43:35,182
You've finally come.

644
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:38,986
I'll drink to that.

645
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:47,061
I'm sorry about all that
beat off to the death stuff.

646
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:51,098
But we can't just be letting
any assholes in here, ya know?

647
00:43:58,439 --> 00:44:03,644
- These 242 Pine Mutant Ninjas
are the last of humanity.

648
00:44:03,878 --> 00:44:06,380
Mutated from the Wet Shit.

649
00:44:06,413 --> 00:44:10,718
Evolved to live out here in the
Zero Dark.

650
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:15,189
Lots changed since your time,
JTRO.

651
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:18,092
But, NITRO said you'd come.

652
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:22,096
- All right, how the
fuck are you still like-

653
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:24,365
- What? Alive?

654
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:25,666
- Yeah, duh.

655
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:30,171
- NITRO brewed me up one of
his hibernation cocktails.

656
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:33,274
I woke up 100 whatevz
years later in a cave

657
00:44:33,307 --> 00:44:34,308
on the outside of town.

658
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:36,410
When I emerged,

659
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:39,013
I was surrounded by all
these fucking weirdos.

660
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:42,950
I napped my ass all
the way into the future

661
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:46,387
to help you guys find the
Fountains of

662
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,389
who gives a shit for NITRO.

663
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:50,324
- All right, so where the fuck
is it then?

664
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:51,425
- Okay.

665
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:55,996
It lies high a-top the
highest peak of Mount Bitch.

666
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,265
Deep within the Massa Pad.

667
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:00,834
Invisy's to any but the
Duckborne,

668
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:03,337
blah, blah, blah.

669
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,305
You know the legend.

670
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:06,807
Look, LSS ,

671
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,277
the only way to unlock the Massa
Pad is.

672
00:45:10,311 --> 00:45:11,712
- The Quad-Force.

673
00:45:13,013 --> 00:45:14,081
- Yes.

674
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:16,884
Which you've lost.

675
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,319
- Misplaced. Take it easy.

676
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,187
- Well, whatevz.

677
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:23,224
Luckily, I had a couple
people that spotted your

678
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:26,327
duck homeboy and a young
lady, which I can only presume

679
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,464
is my niece, hiking up the
summit just a few HRS's ago.

680
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:32,066
- For realzies?

681
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:33,167
- Uh huh.

682
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,835
So drink up

683
00:45:34,868 --> 00:45:37,371
before the hot shit comes.

684
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,873
I shall show you the way.

685
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:47,314
- Is we there yet?

686
00:45:47,348 --> 00:45:48,215
- No.

687
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:50,985
- Is we there yet?

688
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:52,253
- No, goddammit!

689
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,454
Shut the fuck up!

690
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:54,922
- Give some ansies!

691
00:45:54,955 --> 00:45:56,457
- What kind of ansies?

692
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,026
- Oh, I don't know, how
about who the fuck is you

693
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:02,830
and why the F-U-K is you
do-sing and all this shit?

694
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:05,199
- A'ight. But shut your
chex guzzler, cause I only

695
00:46:05,232 --> 00:46:06,934
be spittin' this shit once,
okay?

696
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:07,835
You heard?

697
00:46:09,003 --> 00:46:11,005
The Duckborne that came before
your ass.

698
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:12,072
- Gramma-LATTAY?

699
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:16,410
- I'm monologueing,
motherfucker! Shut it, okay!

700
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:21,448
Anyways, your Gramma imprisoned
my Massa's Massa, BMX.

701
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:25,019
My Massa's mission was
to find the Quad-Force

702
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:27,054
and to wake my grand Massa up.

703
00:46:27,087 --> 00:46:30,924
But you and yo rentz slit my
pops ass

704
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,427
and now all this shit's up to me
and shit.

705
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,429
- L DUBBA E was your pops?

706
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:37,965
- He raised my ass. Call it
whatevz.

707
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:40,868
And now we're hitting
up the Fountain of 4Evz.

708
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:43,037
When my Grand Massa's icy cold
ass

709
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,006
harvests the Bloody Quatro
and ages it the perfection

710
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,441
while he sleeps.

711
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:48,576
- Hold up.

712
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,377
Bloody Quatro?

713
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:52,580
- Magic booze that can re-life
anything!

714
00:46:52,614 --> 00:46:54,549
Pay attention, dummy!

715
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:56,618
Jesus.
- Fuck you

716
00:46:56,651 --> 00:46:59,186
and your magic booze boo shit.

717
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:01,922
What's with all this TLDR, hey?

718
00:47:01,955 --> 00:47:03,324
You ain't Duckborne.

719
00:47:03,357 --> 00:47:04,425
I is.

720
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:07,361
So why's your posing ass
wearing all that duck shit?

721
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:11,298
And flashing it all over town?

722
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:16,270
- Because my Massa fucked up,
a'ight?

723
00:47:16,303 --> 00:47:17,871
He took the wrong kid.

724
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,908
You was the Duckborne.

725
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:23,944
The She-Ro of time boo-shit, not
me.

726
00:47:23,977 --> 00:47:24,612
- Hold up!

727
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:27,181
Don't try and gazzump me.

728
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:29,183
What's under that stupid helmet?

729
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:31,285
I know that ain't a real mug,
dummy.

730
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:36,090
- The beats is strong
as F-U-K with my fam.

731
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:38,859
With my mum,

732
00:47:40,494 --> 00:47:41,895
my pops,

733
00:47:42,564 --> 00:47:44,198
with me.

734
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:48,902
And with my sis.

735
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:54,141
- What the H-E dubba L?

736
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:01,382
Bro?

737
00:48:12,092 --> 00:48:14,261
- So we getting close or what?

738
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:17,665
- When the twinkies fade
and the hot shit comes,

739
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:19,534
the Duckborne will be shown the
way.

740
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,639
- Oh, you're so boring!
- Oh, for fucks sake.

741
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:27,074
- What do want me to do?

742
00:48:27,107 --> 00:48:28,475
- Do your shit.

743
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,612
- I don't know what the fuck to
do.

744
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:31,679
- Figure it out.

745
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:40,287
Easy duckets.

746
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,069
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas.

747
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:15,322
- Let's go!

748
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:20,194
- Yo, duck head,

749
00:49:20,227 --> 00:49:21,495
end of the line.

750
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:31,138
- Momzies!

751
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:41,048
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no. You're not D-U-N yet.

752
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:44,017
It's not time. You're not D-U-N
yet.

753
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,653
- Is she a breather?

754
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:49,456
- I don't know.

755
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:50,692
Kinda.
- Kinda?

756
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,661
- I mean, I took one of those
blasts once.

757
00:49:55,563 --> 00:49:56,764
I did okay.

758
00:49:56,798 --> 00:49:58,999
- Barely. And your her size
times two.

759
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:00,735
- What happened? What'd I miss?

760
00:50:00,768 --> 00:50:02,135
Oh.

761
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:03,103
One of those days, huh?

762
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:07,407
Look guys, I don't know
how to sugar coat this,

763
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:11,311
she looks really fucked up right
now.

764
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:16,016
- What the fuck are we going to
do?

765
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:18,720
- The Fountain of 4Evz.

766
00:50:18,753 --> 00:50:20,655
It's the only way to re-life
her.

767
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:22,289
But you better go going
fast because she needs

768
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:23,323
Bloody Quatro now.

769
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,529
- You're the She-Ro of time,
right?

770
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:30,565
- Yeah.

771
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:34,501
Hundo P, that's me.

772
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:36,270
- Then let's go fucking prove
it.

773
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,709
- Guess I'll stay here.

774
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,321
- Hold your horses, dick head.

775
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:29,256
- What are you waitin' for,
motherfucker?

776
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:44,772
- Yo.

777
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:46,340
Dad-TRO.

778
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:47,709
- Dad-TRO?

779
00:51:47,742 --> 00:51:49,544
What do you mean Dad-TRO?

780
00:51:49,577 --> 00:51:51,512
- He's my bro.

781
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:52,780
- The fuck are you talking
about?

782
00:51:52,814 --> 00:51:53,982
- He's got an eye patch.

783
00:51:54,015 --> 00:51:56,751
- So what? A lot of people
wearing eye patches these days.

784
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:59,554
- No one has eye patches
but TROS and you know it.

785
00:52:02,924 --> 00:52:05,860
Sure he's got a lot of Waste
miles on him or whatevz.

786
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:06,728
- Fuck you!

787
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:07,829
- But it's him.

788
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:08,830
Fuck you.

789
00:52:11,933 --> 00:52:12,834
- JR-TRO?

790
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:18,171
The mother F'n fuck, man, you
died.

791
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:19,306
- Yeah, past tense and shit.

792
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:20,908
- Yeah, what kind of and shit?

793
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:23,911
- Let me just hit you with some
BP's.

794
00:52:27,982 --> 00:52:30,417
L DUBBA E found my ass.

795
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:33,420
Gave me a 2.0 at life.

796
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:36,591
He raised me and shit.

797
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:40,595
And we dreamed of a day,

798
00:52:40,628 --> 00:52:42,797
a day where we'd free our Grand
Massa

799
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:46,601
from the cage cast upon his ass

800
00:52:46,634 --> 00:52:48,903
by the ducks and the CHAIS!

801
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:52,573
And together,

802
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:55,510
we'd escape all that and
we'd escape all that boo-shit

803
00:52:55,543 --> 00:52:59,647
and we'd rule the whole wide
Earf 4Evz.

804
00:53:01,248 --> 00:53:04,217
But you all took that dream
when you gave my Massa

805
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:05,620
a dirt nap.

806
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:09,991
So here I is, dose'n what
I can with what I gots.

807
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:11,258
- What?

808
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:12,927
What are you doing all this
shit for that fucking ice cube

809
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,095
over there, man?

810
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:18,733
- Because that ice cube over
there gave me everything!

811
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:23,571
His blood gave my ass what
neither you or mom-CHAI could.

812
00:53:24,505 --> 00:53:25,372
Life.

813
00:53:26,841 --> 00:53:29,577
- We did the best we
could with what we had.

814
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:33,581
- Oh yeah, the road to Rage
is paved with good intentions,

815
00:53:33,614 --> 00:53:34,247
ain'ts it?

816
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:35,550
- Don't you give that shit!

817
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:39,587
If we had access to
magical god booze blood

818
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,923
from another world, don't
you think we would've used

819
00:53:41,956 --> 00:53:42,824
it on you?

820
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:46,627
You're my fucking son.

821
00:53:50,932 --> 00:53:51,799
- Bio-son.

822
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,769
Nothin' more.

823
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:55,703
Click, Click!

824
00:53:55,737 --> 00:53:57,805
Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew!

825
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,841
Freakin' blap

826
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,912
A'ight. Fuck it. Do you're

827
00:54:04,946 --> 00:54:07,014
I got some resurrectin' to get
did.

828
00:54:11,953 --> 00:54:14,387
I'm about to bust a
fuckin' duck up in here.

829
00:54:20,695 --> 00:54:23,430
- Launch Beat
Massa reanimation sequence

830
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:27,434
Initiating. Initiated.

831
00:54:34,407 --> 00:54:35,977
- All right, I got an idea.

832
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,545
- Spill it.

833
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,749
- My fingers are fast as shit!

834
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:44,484
- There comes a very important
time in every adult's life

835
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:47,420
when you need to kick the
living shit out of your sibling.

836
00:54:48,556 --> 00:54:49,891
Today's that day, CHAI-TRO.

837
00:54:49,924 --> 00:54:50,958
- So down.

838
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:54,862
I'm sick of listening to that
poser quack.

839
00:54:54,896 --> 00:54:57,430
- Check it out Ninjas, I'm
ghost-typin'!

840
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,033
- But what are you going to do,
hey?

841
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:06,406
- I'm going to do what I do
best.

842
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:08,042
I'm going to Beat-Beat this
shit right again and send that

843
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:10,878
fuckin' ice cube packing back
to wherever it came from.

844
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:12,847
Let's rock.

845
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:22,089

00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:31,799
I ain't playing no more!

850
00:55:44,812 --> 00:55:47,380
- Oh, I got one too.

851
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:48,950
Let's splash, ninja!

852
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:53,588
- Let's get wet, bitch.

853
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:56,023
- Enter destination.

854
00:55:56,057 --> 00:55:57,024
- All right, mom.

855
00:55:58,092 --> 00:55:59,627
I hope this is what you meant.

856
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,863

Eng'yon power up required.

860
00:56:07,568 --> 00:56:10,037
- How the fuck do I power up the
Eng'yon?

861
00:56:10,071 --> 00:56:12,039
- Excusez-moi. I has

- There ain't no joy in
beating the same ass twice,

876
00:57:00,821 --> 00:57:01,722

877
00:57:01,756 --> 00:57:02,723
- Couldn't tell ya.

878
00:57:02,757 --> 00:57:05,559
I usually just beat ass
right the first time.

879
00:57:06,694 --> 00:57:10,598
- I beat your ass in the ground
the first round, homegirl.

880
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:12,133
- Are you going to do something?

881
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:13,968
Or am I going to have to

- Omega-axe mode!

894
00:58:24,939 --> 00:58:27,842
Crit! Mad crits! Critzilla!

895
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:28,876
Yo, kick it!

896
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:46,761
- Authentication level three.

897
00:58:46,794 --> 00:58:49,563
Authentic-a-tiy-ated.

898
00:58:49,597 --> 00:58:51,332
Eng'yon power up.

899
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:52,600
Powering up.

900
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:56,737
Launch sequence to the Far As
Fuk System in the Woke Galaxy

901
00:58:56,771 --> 00:58:58,672
initiated.

902
00:58:58,706 --> 00:59:01,642
60 S's until launch.

903
00:59:01,675 --> 00:59:03,044
59,

904
00:59:03,077 --> 00:59:04,612
58,

905
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:06,280
57,

906
00:59:06,313 --> 00:59:07,181
56.

907
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:10,851
- Two CHAIs with the same
Beat-Gat.

908
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,055
What is the odds?

909
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:16,290
- There's something dad never
got a chance to teach you

910
00:59:16,323 --> 00:59:17,858
when you was a little bloke.

911
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:19,226
- Save it, Sis-TRO!

912
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,928
- Winning ain't about strength.

913
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:33,374
It's about patience and
commitment, duck head.

914
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:34,275
- Whoa!

915
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:36,110
Ow!

916
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:40,214
Oh no, right in the fuckin'
duck!

917
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:41,282
My duck...

918
00:59:42,316 --> 00:59:45,619
Jesus fuckin' duckin' Christ!

919
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:46,454
- Whatevz.

920
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:48,756
- Bitch
axe-executed.

921
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:54,728
- 30
S's remaining until launch.

922
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:56,130
29,

923
00:59:56,163 --> 00:59:57,832
28,

924
00:59:57,865 --> 00:59:58,933
27.

925
00:59:58,966 --> 01:00:00,067
- Hey, come on. Let's go.

926
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:02,970
- But this whole place is gonna
blow.

927
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:10,077
He's still my bro.

928
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,278
- You're a fuckin' idiot.

929
01:00:11,312 --> 01:00:13,080
- That's not your bro.

930
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:14,181
That's just some asshole
that looks like you.

931
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:15,082
Come on!

932
01:00:16,183 --> 01:00:17,384
Look, CHAI-TRO, I get it.

933
01:00:18,986 --> 01:00:20,788
Okay, look at me and your uncle
AK.

934
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:25,693
- Ow!

935
01:00:25,726 --> 01:00:26,760
- This isn't goodbye.

936
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:31,265
It's just fuck you for now.

937
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:35,703
Let's roll.

938
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:40,040
- 15
S's remaining until launch.

939
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:41,375
14,

940
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:42,943
13.

941
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:44,678
- Oh shit, we got to go.

942
01:00:45,813 --> 01:00:46,914
Have a nice trip.

943
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:48,949
See you next fall,
motherfuckers.

944
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:50,885
Let's roll. H'Yah!

945
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:52,286
- Six,

946
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:53,787
five,

947
01:00:53,821 --> 01:00:54,955
four,

948
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:56,223
three,

949
01:00:56,257 --> 01:00:57,725
two,

950
01:00:57,758 --> 01:00:59,026
one,

951
01:00:59,059 --> 01:00:59,927
zero.

952
01:01:01,395 --> 01:01:02,263
Adieu.

953
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:06,200
- And you can cut all your hair
off.

954
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:07,434
But you're still the same

955
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:10,471
disappointed person that you
always were,

956
01:01:10,505 --> 01:01:12,873
you know what I mean?

957
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:15,709
Holy shit!

958
01:01:20,814 --> 01:01:22,716
What the fuck?

959
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:23,884
What the fuck?!

960
01:01:37,464 --> 01:01:39,733
That Massa Pad's a fuckin'
spaceship?

961
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:41,936
Did you get the shit?
- Yeah, we got the shit.

962
01:01:53,515 --> 01:01:56,250
- What the H just happened?

963
01:01:56,283 --> 01:01:59,453
- I wasn't D-U-N yet.

964
01:01:59,486 --> 01:02:00,955
- Neither was I.

965
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:07,328
- Finally.

966
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:08,963
Feel like I've been waitin' for
hours.

967
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:14,768
- Well done, my JTRO.

968
01:02:14,802 --> 01:02:17,505
Though we will never physically
meet,

969
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:21,909
our pathzies have been evz
interconnected.

970
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:26,480
The sacra-F's we all made
led you to right here.

971
01:02:26,514 --> 01:02:27,515
Right now.

972
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:33,053
This may not be the last time
your abilities are called upon

973
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:35,155
to save your peeps.

974
01:02:39,393 --> 01:02:44,298
This HRS of peace may not last.

975
01:02:44,331 --> 01:02:47,334
But that does not mean
you should jack yourself

976
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:50,137
of enjoying this mome-y-do
you've earned.

977
01:02:57,144 --> 01:03:00,548
The day's come for you
to re-mem and re-flek

978
01:03:00,582 --> 01:03:03,484
on all the shit you've gone
through.

979
01:03:04,485 --> 01:03:05,919
All the faily-dos,

980
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:08,289
all the victories,

981
01:03:09,189 --> 01:03:13,827
all the experiencies that
have led you to right heres,

982
01:03:14,529 --> 01:03:16,463
right nows.

983
01:03:16,497 --> 01:03:18,999
And you'll refreshifie

984
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:24,004
knowing you've finally solved
the riddle of RE-NINJ, JTRO.

985
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:28,610
When your Rage is Extinguished,

986
01:03:28,643 --> 01:03:33,581
Nothing's Impossible on
this Neverending Journey.

987
01:03:33,615 --> 01:03:37,985
Where booze will no longer be
a necessity, but a pleasure.

988
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:43,891
And yes, everything will change.

989
01:03:43,924 --> 01:03:47,494
But y'all's future is
finally y'all's to make

990
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:49,531
wherevz you choose.

991
01:03:51,332 --> 01:03:54,335
The FP isn't a place, my TRO.

992
01:03:55,302 --> 01:03:57,371
It's a fam.

993
01:03:57,404 --> 01:04:01,008
And no matter what
happens or wherevz you go,

994
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:02,976
the FP,

995
01:04:04,211 --> 01:04:06,847
