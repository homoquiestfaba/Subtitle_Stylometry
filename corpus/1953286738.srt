1
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,115
Riley.

2
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,755
Hedda, that outfit looks amazing.

3
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,325
Well, they loved it at city hall!

4
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,627
Yes, it's always impressive when
a priest wears knock off Pucci.

5
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,633
What would you expect?
Vatican drag?

6
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,135
No, but what'd the groom think?

7
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,296
Why do you think they're
shipping her off to Vermont?

8
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,635
Exactly.

9
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,742
Riley!

10
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,144
Hey guys, this is
my other half, Riley.

11
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,341
We've read all about you
on Markus' blog.

12
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,576
Oh, how's the rash?

13
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,845
Yeah! Has it cleared it up yet?

14
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,450
Markus claims to have
writer's block

15
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,215
but all he does is
blog, blog, biog!

16
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,687
I didn't know you had
writer's block!

17
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,251
That's because he hasn't
blogged about it.

18
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,827
I'm just a little stuck
on my new novel.

19
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:58,753
Oh, what's it about?

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,622
It's about a gay couple
having a biological child.

21
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:02,799
So it's horror?

22
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,304
If we had kids, could you imagine
what we would be doing right now?

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,638
Carpooling?

24
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,369
You blogged about my rash?

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,578
Sorry, honey.

26
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,678
Baby.

27
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,324
Hey Zeus.

28
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,420
Do you take change?

29
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,157
You cheap little bitch.

30
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,492
Sodomites, this is about me
for once!

31
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,565
First I want to thank manhunt.net

32
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,364
for sponsoring
my wedding reception.

33
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,302
Welcome!

34
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:48,340
You know, my relatives wanted me
to have a traditional ceremony.

35
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:49,779
Hello?!

36
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,273
You are my family!

37
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,314
You've been with me
through it all:

38
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:57,922
Fat, thin. A horrible addiction
to very expensive handbags.

39
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,689
But now I've got Michael!

40
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,824
Where's Michael?

41
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,660
Where is my man?

42
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,520
Give me back my man!

43
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,720
Oh there you are!

44
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,867
Many of you are thinking you're
not gonna see me again after today.

45
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,434
That I'm gonna disappear like
all the fag hags of your youth.

46
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,432
Well, you're rig ht

47
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:21,405
Finally I found a man who loves
me and my pussy.

48
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:26,382
I said he loves my pussy!

49
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,577
And he's gonna tear it apart
behind that picket fence!

50
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,818
We love you Audrey!

51
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,587
Oh, I love you too

52
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,462
You know I lasted as long as I
could with my boys.

53
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,499
Longer than any fag hag
ever has.

54
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,829
Well...

55
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,871
Any except Violet.

56
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,637
Toss the bouquet already!

57
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,246
The bouquet is yours Violet,
if I had one.

58
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,615
He's working at the
salon tonight.

59
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,690
But you're still together?

60
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,589
Of course.
Darian's perfect.

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,354
I actually think, I'm falling
in love with...

62
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,462
Apparently Dan's cock is so huge -

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,792
that the only way to fit it
in your mouth -

64
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,763
is to suck it while it's still soft.

65
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,662
Is that Beer Can Dan?

66
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,505
Yeah.

67
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,565
What about Darian?

68
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,336
Oh, Darian and Luke
have an understanding.

69
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,844
Uh oh, cock-block.

70
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,015
Deflected!

71
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,422
Luke may have more experience...

72
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,957
But his opponent is tenacious

73
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:42,986
It's battle of the bottoms.

74
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,987
And the biggest loser
comes out on top!

75
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,922
Hey beautiful!

76
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,434
Hey Zeus, you beast!
Look at ya.

77
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,569
Oh, I love it when you tease me!

78
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,638
So, I hear you and Luke
are joining forces.

79
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,932
Yes. God I love that guy.

80
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,277
He gave me his whole email list
he's getting sponsors

81
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,934
Oh, your benefit is going to be
off the hook.

82
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,379
New ink?

83
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,014
Yeah, check it out.

84
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,345
Ten years HIV positive,
still kicking.

85
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,878
You don't have to brand
yourself.

86
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,683
I just want everyone to know
there is life after:

87
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,389
Well, I'll be with you
in sickness

88
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,923
and in health, count on it.

89
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,392
I love you.

90
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,459
Paparazzi!

91
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,595
Next Magazine

92
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:19,696
No more pictures!

93
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,991
You'll ruin their reputation.

94
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,889
I implore you, no photos!

95
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,428
Really, no more pictures.

96
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,664
I gotta go!
See ya'!

97
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,000
Alright, we better go too.

98
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,804
Have a goodnight.

99
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:32,874
Hey, you too!

100
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:49,893
Dude!

101
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,027
What's with the skirt?

102
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,619
Violet?

103
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,925
Hey, I'm almost done.

104
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,393
I'm waiting behind the shrub.

105
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,669
Ok.

106
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,804
She's my roommate.

107
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,465
Yeah, you know man
that's a little weird actually.

108
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,575
Is she watching us?

109
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,843
She's harmless.

110
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,773
Fag hags, Jesus!

111
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:11,915
Hey!

112
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,416
More respect.

113
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,442
She's the last one.

114
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,440

It's Salome.

128
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,038
Got a delivery for me?

129
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,414
<i>Another very big package.</i>

130
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,748
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

131
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,078
Just two drops of
Chanel Number 5.

132
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,523
Still off today?

133
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,897
You wanna chill?

134
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,602
Let's go to Coney Island
and ride the Cyclone.

135
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,809
Yeah, let's do that.

136
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,018
So, how was Audrey's reception?

137
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,222
She was so happy.

138
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,493
I wish you could have been
there to see her face.

139
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,628
That's the one drawback to
owning my own business.

140
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:05,988
Not much free time.

141
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,125
I have my own business.

142
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,996
I think there is a little more
leeway with roving sex parties.

143
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,139
I'm branching out.

144
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,540
Can I use your salon for my

145
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,802
“Lazy Tops and Power Bottoms”
party?

146
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,478
My host bailed after the police
raid you know...

147
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:26,950
What?

148
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,846
You got hickeys again.

149
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,052
Oh, don't!

150
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,153
Who were you with last night?

151
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,155
Clearly an amateur:

152
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,218
Wait, let me get this right.

153
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,527
You watched two people
commit to one another;

154
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,793
Hooked up with some random and
then came crawling into bed with me?

155
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,759
I took a shower first.

156
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,765
Come on D!

157
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,836
I got cock-matized

158
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,102
So, why'd you come over?

159
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,005
Because I wanted
to sleep with you.

160
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,872
But you had sex
with somebody else.

161
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,981
It's not the same thing.
You know that.

162
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,877
You are as bad as I am.

163
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:02,915
Was.

164
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,586
We met at a glory hole.

165
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,982
I know where we met.

166
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,189
I can't do this anymore.

167
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,956
Wait a second...

168
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,827
You can't do this anymore?

169
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,997
Darian, we have an
understanding.

170
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,159
Well, I asked for a new
understanding.

171
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,166
If you can't give me that
I can't do this anymore.

172
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,141
Darian, come on.
You know that I...

173
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:27,833
You know I...

174
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,284
You know the impalas?
In Africa?

175
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,251
Did you know they have like
twenty sexual partners at a go?

176
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,658
And what's amazing is that not
one impala gets upset or angry

177
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,157
or says they can't
do it anymore.

178
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,561
You're right!

179
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,863
I'm gonna take a shower

180
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,700
When I'm out, I wanna find you gone,
my keys on the table

181
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,961
and I don't want you
coming around here anymore.

182
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:54,937
It's over!

183
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,006
But I love you.

184
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,737
Hi, do you have a minute
for future today?

185
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,053
Hi sir do you have a minute
for the future today?

186
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,656
Sorry, nope.
I'm not breeding.

187
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,924
Are you my mailman?

188
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,698
Cute socks!

189
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,334
Salome?
That's you.

190
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,829
My gay husband would kill
for those calves!

191
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,199
Please.
We're in public.

192
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,237
Oh honey its New York-

193
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,339
Everything happens
on the street.

194
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,237
So, Chinese is okay, rig ht?

195
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,309
I can't do it.

196
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,870
I once had the worse gas
off a plate of mu shu pork.

197
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:37,912
I get it, where should we go?

198
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,811
No, I can't do this.

199
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,751
I'm gonna take a pass.

200
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,847
You're gonna pass?

201
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,919
I know I lied on Frisky Friends
but I came clean

202
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,320
I mean, I gave you
my real stats.

203
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,626
Salome

204
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:51,955
I know this sounds cliché but

205
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,730
It's not you...

206
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,962
It's me.

207
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:55,963
Really.

208
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,138
These were for you.

209
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,146
But I have experience.

210
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,187
I have walked the catwalks
in Paris, Milan,

211
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,882
London!

212
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,994
In nothing but pasties.

213
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,060
Here, see?

214
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,163
My collection is designer clothing.

215
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,333
They were designer pasties.

216
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,400
Bradleigh, please I need press,
help me!

217
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:33,429
Please.

218
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,795
For the passion we shared
when we were boys?

219
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,843
Larice, are you threatening me?

220
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,238
Yes.

221
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,250
So, you've seen the line sheet.

222
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,177
Bradleigh's new collection
was inspired by

223
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,753
the latest dinosaur discovered
down in Argentina.

224
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,949
Perfect! Let me know when you
want to come for the pull.

225
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,326
Okay.

226
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,254
Oh no, not again!

227
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,230
What is wrong with me, Riley?

228
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,334
Why do you keep saying that?

229
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,735
Nothing!

230
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,836
It's not you, it's him.

231
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,766
You are surrounded by men
who love you.

232
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,444
Love?

233
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,708
I deserve someone to love me
and my pussy

234
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,814
Like Audrey.

235
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,316
Do you hear me?

236
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,843
Um, I hear you.

237
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,313
Donna I would, if I could.

238
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,217
I've got tools.

239
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,253
Not now, Donna.

240
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,356
Still got my hymen.

241
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,397
What you need, Violet,
is the male version of you.

242
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,188
A fag stag.

243
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,231
A metrosexual?

244
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,197
No, no no no no

245
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,303
A metrosexual will only throw
you off the scent

246
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,403
What is it Salome?

247
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:42,738
I'm going to lunch.

248
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,741
Actually, not lunch.

249
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,342
I'm being taken out
for high-end water:

250
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,874
Can Violet cover reception?

251
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,279
One sec..

252
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,915
A fag stag is special.

253
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,379
He hangs out with gays because

254
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,145
he enjoys their energy and their
attention just like you do.

255
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,522
Does that sort of person
really exist?

256
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,023
I don't think so.

257
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,287
Can I have a carrot?

258
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,765
Nevermind.

259
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:09,998
I probably shouldn't.

260
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,247
My fuck buddy broke up with me.

261
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,915
Oh, no!

262
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,440
Really glad I never officially
moved in

263
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,553
because then I'm not officially
kicked out rig ht?

264
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,889
Sweetheart what happened?

265
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,284
Suddenly after three months
Darian is not a slut anymore.

266
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,920
What does he want?
Monogamy?

267
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,795
Sounds like something
I need lasered off.

268
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,091
I know.

269
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,999
Oh my gosh, Luke.

270
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,363
I think it might be time for us...

271
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,003
Please, don't say it.

272
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:48,871
Grow up.

273
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,336
I can hear that
from anyone but you.

274
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,502
But, maybe it's time.

275
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,411
I don't see what the problem is?

276
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,809
So I play around what's that
got to do with Darian?

277
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,540
But, you know I would
give my heart

278
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,407
A lung, and what's left
of my liver

279
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,078
to have a chance
with a man like Darian.

280
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,022
I mean, do you know
how lucky you are?

281
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,984
Can I tell you
what happened to me?

282
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,427
I met a frisky friend
for lunch today.

283
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,224
And he can't put up with me
for two minutes

284
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,229
I mean, leaves me on the street,
can you believe it?

285
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,868
I'm not even worth
a lousy lunch.

286
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,428
Which frisky friend?

287
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,436
What's his name
and where does he live?

288
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,336
Why, what are you going to do?

289
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,138
Beat him up.

290
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,344
Not only a mailman,
but a Gemini.

291
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,911
Have you known me
to stoop that low?

292
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,016
A Gemini!

293
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,311
Yeah, you dodged a bullet
on that one.

294
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,509
And he was probably bi-polar:

295
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,581
All Geminis are bi-polar:

296
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:38,978
Hi baby!

297
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,191
Good to see you.

298
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,256
Look at that ass in those jeans.

299
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,995
- Thank you.
- Scorching!

300
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,162
I have spammed my whole list.

301
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,321
Every last queen is going
to be at that benefit.

302
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,900
What about our queen mother?

303
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,433
Of course! I've already
poached some

304
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,902
last season Bradleigh
for the silent auction.

305
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,006
There is nothing I wouldn't do
to keep HIV stigma-free!

306
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,868
You should throw her on stage
to revive her high school tap routine.

307
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,636
I do a mean Shim-Sham-Shimmy.

308
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:03,946
Oh really?

309
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,104
Let's see those moves baby.

310
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,013
Oh, no one wants to see my moves,
when we can ogle yours.

311
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,117
Oh, that's not fail:

312
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,948
No, it's not fair at all!

313
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,423
Okay...

314
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,957
next time I get dumped
in the real world

315
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,527
it's going to be
by someone hot like Zeus,

316
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,425
Not some bi-polar mailman.

317
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,496
Tell it, girl.

318
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,134
Why, oh why, can't I find
a straight man?

319
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,234
Why can't I?

320
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,893
Why don't you try
a straight bar?

321
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,037
Who'll go with me?

322
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,007
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

323
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,008
Okay, you don't need
to go anywhere

324
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,972
We will find you a fag stag.

325
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,774
Riley's convinced
that I'll find a straight man

326
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,382
masquerading around
the gay world.

327
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,346
Actually, a fag stag
is urban legend.

328
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,921
Okay, well you have about an hour
to find this mythical unicorn

329
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,149
before mama goes home
for phone sex.

330
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,292
She is not lying.

331
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,693
You know maybe Frisky Friends

332
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,961
is not the best way
to meet a man.

333
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,119
It's a numbers game Markus

334
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,459
It's a numbers game

335
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,396
I'm just saying no more Geminis.

336
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,467
How about the internet?

337
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,036
I talk better that I type baby!

338
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,138
Uh Oh, here comes
the fuck me voice

339
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,204
Look out!

340
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,636
Oh that feels so good

341
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,238
I love it on the right side
of my...

342
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,342
Tuna juice!

343
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,974
Enough about your gash wound.

344
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,044
Thank you.

345
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,408
Stop calling my pussy
a gash wound!

346
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,345
- Okay.
- Hey guys

347
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,677
He?! What's going on?

348
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,519
- Hello Goddess!
- Hey sweetie.

349
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,313
- So good to see you.
- You too.

350
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,353
You guys have fun tonight.

351
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,387
Thank you.

352
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,422
Remember when
Peter and Derek were

353
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,423
looking for a surrogate
for their gayby?

354
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,652
You know they asked Violet,
rig ht?

355
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:25,961
I'm like, HELLO!!

356
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,188
Entrance only,
and still they pleaded.

357
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,263
I'm like find another womb!

358
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,455
How hard can it be?

359
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,622
Seriously half the world
has one!

360
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,663
Who did they find?
Derek's sister:

361
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,236
I understand
it's someone else's egg

362
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,532
She's just a surrogate but...

363
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,333
Don't you think it can catch

364
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,636
I don't know, incest by osmosis?

365
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,307
That's beautiful.

366
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,971
What a beautiful gift of love
from Derek's sister.

367
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,751
It's not as if Derek
could fall pregnant.

368
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,519
Well, he's been trying
for years.

369
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,520
Markus' new novel, actually,
is about a man who gives birth.

370
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,753
Well it's about how life would
be different if men could give birth.

371
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:57,992
Well, I'll tell you.

372
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,288
Abortion clinics
on every corner!

373
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,163
Oh, hold on!

374
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,629
Here comes the coat hanger again.

375
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,362
I'm sorry, your balls are
in the way.

376
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,569
That's not funny!

377
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:09,671
That's not funny at all!

378
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,006
Your color is fantastic.

379
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,074
Who does it?

380
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,176
I was “Done by Darian”.

381
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,545
Who hasn't been?

382
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,318
Darian...

383
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,419
Yeah

384
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,556
Are you still going to
donate your coupon

385
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,191
for the silent auction
Zeus is doing?

386
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,291
Of course.

387
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,552
I also got couple of things
for you.

388
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,161
Stop by the salon alright?

389
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,261
I will.

390
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,029
How about the hottie
right over there?

391
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,334
YOU are SO mean to me.

392
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,338
Wait, who's that?

393
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,771
Riley says that's my fag stag.

394
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:47,906
Unicorn

395
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,011
Sweet, thanks!

396
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,312
Cheers!
Drinks on me.

397
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,324
Oh my God.

398
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,999
Salome.
OH MY GOD!

399
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,160
Are you dead?

400
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,297
What happened to you?

401
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,106
You look...Amazing.

402
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,144
Feed me!

403
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,490
Promise me you won't tell anyone
you found me behind a dumpster:

404
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,356
Okay?

405
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,495
Alright.

406
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,725
I am really worried.

407
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,299
When I don't eat,
I get sleepy, okay?

408
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,469
Salome, you're naturally thin.

409
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,530
If I was you, I'd only be eating

410
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:49,805
And fucking.

411
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,676
Violet, let me tell you something:

412
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,243
Fucking is overrated.

413
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,376
Guys line up around the block
to fuck me.

414
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,675
It is really tiresome.

415
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,842
There is a guy right here in
this diner that wants to fuck me.

416
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,751
Who?

417
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,223
Black guy, Oscar Giovanni
scarf, biceps.

418
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,284
He's behind you.

419
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,053
He doesn't know that he
should know

420
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,253
that l know he's cruising me,
you know?

421
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,732
Wait.

422
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,227
He's actually cruising you.

423
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,301
Oh my god!

424
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,733
Just play aloof.

425
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:28,907
Violet!

426
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,440
Stop with the straw.

427
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,180
You lost him.

428
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,811
And you're gonna keep losing them
until you get off your racket.

429
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,622
My racket?

430
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,850
Your racket is what's stopping you.

431
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,721
Well, I don't look like you.

432
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,628
It's not just your looks.

433
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,460
There is someone for everyone.

434
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,862
I believe that.

435
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,469
Thanks.

436
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,496
Let me ask you something.

437
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,797
Where were you earlier?

438
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:57,872
Out with the boys.

439
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,174
Okay.

440
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,300
Do you know that story
in the news about

441
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,744
the family of peacocks that took
in the orphan elephant?

442
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:05,904
Oh, yes.

443
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,775
And then the elephant ran around
thinking it was a peacock?

444
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,319
So sweet.

445
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,750
It's not sweet.

446
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,357
It's ridiculous.

447
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:15,423
Picture it!

448
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,424
Violet, you are not a peacock!

449
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,527
You are an...

450
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,898
Have you ever thought maybe

451
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,735
your gay friends
just don't wanna share you?

452
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,436
No.

453
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,596
They wanna keep you wrapped up
in their own little world

454
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,365
away from men who want women.

455
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,441
That's a horrible thing to say.

456
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,805
Do you wanna get married
and have kids?

457
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,669
No.

458
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:37,846
See?

459
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,507
The gays have totally
warped your mind.

460
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,779
They do refuse to go
to straight bars.

461
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,519
And they are always insulting
my pussy.

462
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,519
But no, my friends want
what I want.

463
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,432
Okay.

464
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,567
Okay what?

465
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,003
You're not willing
to be coachable.

466
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,236
I am!

467
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,395
I am coachable.

468
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,641
Then I can help.

469
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,912
God...

470
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,806
I ate so much.

471
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,614
I'm just gonna hit
the ladies' room.

472
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,620
I might be a minute...

473
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:24,724
or two.

474
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:33,635
Just pick a number:

475
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,271
10,000 words a day.

476
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,839
I wish...

477
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,565
it's just that... you know

478
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,869
their baby is born
and I've lost the plot

479
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,978
Maybe male mothers
eat their young.

480
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,382
Thanks, that's very helpful.

481
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,444
Baby!

482
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,319
Gays don't breed.

483
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,686
It's what separates us
from the animals.

484
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,359
We should invest in valuable
real estate instead.

485
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,496
Let's do that...

486
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,633
How about that rooftop
at Audrey's reception?

487
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,699
How about...

488
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,825
this valuable real estate, ha?
Right here...

489
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,871
It's looking a bit neglected.

490
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,005
Seriously...

491
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,306
we're not breeders.

492
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,999
We don't have to worry about
the rest of the planet.

493
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,844
Global warming, recycling...

494
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,843
Oh, I would hate to recycle!

495
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,012
So why not write about that?

496
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,942
Because I'm writing
a fantasy, Riley.

497
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,676
Your husband is an idealist.

498
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,590
Doll, I love you...

499
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,014
but I'm not your husband.

500
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,594
It's their word.

501
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,695
It could be our word.

502
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,698
Pear puree?

503
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:40,936
What's this?

504
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,038
Just research...

505
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:45,707
<i>okaY---</i>

506
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,400
I've got an idea...

507
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,613
I wanna take you out
tomorrow night for some solid food.

508
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,071
Cheer you up.

509
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,478
I love you.

510
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,545
I love my husband!

511
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:01,749
I love you

512
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,586
I love my husband!

513
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,753
I love you

514
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,895
Ah... husband

515
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,064
Just found this
at the flea market!

516
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,799
What do you think?

517
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:13,868
Cute, ha?

518
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,133
You can drape it

519
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,565
you can belt it,
you can crimp it!

520
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,731
You can knock it off in China
for 50 cents a pop.

521
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,842
Precisely.

522
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,704
Make that happen.

523
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,074
Remind me to give this splendor
to Donna when she gets back.

524
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:31,653
Oh hey!

525
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,754
Drinks tonight?

526
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:33,988
Markus has writers' group.

527
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,024
I have a dinner date tonight

528
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,786
and I don't plan
on coming home after:

529
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,087
Not another frisky friend?

530
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,159
Why do you say it like that
"another frisky friend"?

531
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,093
What, do you want me
all to yourself? Or what?!?

532
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,504
Wow!

533
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,407
It's about a "day of beauty" coupon
for a silent auction I'm doing

534
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,009
I just gave it to you.

535
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,076
Okay, thanks

536
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,414
I actually wanted to speak with
Darian about another matter'...

537
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,048
I already told you
Darian is with a client.

538
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,645
Hey yo!
Darian, hey!

539
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,419
Am I invisible?

540
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,522
Yeah, to me.

541
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,091
Darian listen, is now a bad time?

542
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,153
Now is good.

543
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,552
Okay, thanks so much
for this coupon

544
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,488
Can we speak in private?

545
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,831
Since when do you care
about private?

546
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:20,769
Okay.

547
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,137
Well D

548
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,598
I wanna invite you to
a nice dinner <i>or...</i>

549
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,673
something romantic
of your choice.

550
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,041
Um.. why?

551
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,976
Well, you know that story
in the book

552
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,046
with Noah and ...animals and

553
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,706
Wait, wait, wait.. Noah's Ark?

554
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,148
And a bird brought Noah a twig

555
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,886
which meant everything
is gonna be okay.

556
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,719
So, you're here as...

557
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,153
as a twig?

558
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,059
I'm here to show you
just how much

559
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,026
I want everything to be okay for us.

560
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:52,595
Wow! Luke... thank you...

561
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,794
for that rare glimpse of sincerity.

562
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,872
And thank you for stopping by...

563
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,506
But this is...

564
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,119
The rest of your stuff..
from my apartment.

565
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,034
<i>Don't... don't cry</i>

566
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,040
<i>You know you like that one...
aah come on!</i>

567
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,104
<i>Goad buy!</i>

568
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:42,216
<i>Put it on there now..
no, on top of it, ok?</i>

569
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:43,942
Put it on there.

570
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,651
Little person.

571
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,688
Um... this is Joey.

572
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:56,924
Say hi Joey

573
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,199
Hey!

574
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,059
Ashley's sitter called in sick...

575
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,533
Ashley?

576
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,703
My mentor from writers group

577
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,702
And how often does
Ashley's sitter call in sick?

578
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,668
Oh... um.. just Fridays...

579
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,815
sometimes Wednesdays.

580
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,317
You couldn't tell me?

581
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,744
You know, sometimes
you're not that easy

582
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,546
to talk to about certain things.

583
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,553
Not that easy to talk to...

584
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,913
Ashley's just running late..

585
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,218
She'll be here any minute.

586
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,796
Markus I just want
what's best for us.

587
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:30,024
You know, to move up,
get ahead, own some property.

588
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,692
You know this gig
can help us save.

589
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,961
Ashley set me up baby sitting
for others too.

590
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,734
Yeah, she's done wonders
for your writing..

591
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,173
I'm really good with kids, okay?

592
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,845
Just look at Joey...

593
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,678
Isn't he adorable?
Just look at him.

594
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,157
Oh, Joey...baby

595
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,656
Welcome to the
“Lazy Tops, Power Bottoms” party.

596
00:26:58,917 --> 00:26:59,895
Show me your dick.

597
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,631
I've just got to make sure
you're not the police.

598
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,159
Here's a bag for your clothes.

599
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,636
Welcome to the “Lazy Tops,

600
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,899
Power Bottoms” party.
$40 please.

601
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,707
I'm on the list

602
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,174
Okay, what are you doing here?

603
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,114
I came to fuck my brains out.

604
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,947
Um.. in front of all these people?

605
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,357
With all these people.

606
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,381
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

607
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,725
You're deliberately trying to hurt me?

608
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,624
Take it easy, Luke...

609
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,892
Haven't you heard about
the impalas in Africa?

610
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:44,872
Hey sweetie!

611
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,368
Hi!

612
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:47,675
Frisky friend 265, Mike.

613
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,776
Hey!

614
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,069
Donnie and I worked together
as flight attendants

615
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,146
Air hostesses!

616
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,247
Oh, yes.

617
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,078
In the unlikely event
of a water landing,

618
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,015
you're all gonna die!

619
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,119
That's nice!

620
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,153
Thank you

621
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,755
I'll be back to get your orders
in a bit.

622
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:01,856
Okay.

623
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,184
Air hostess, ha?

624
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,052
Oh, my ticket out of Idaho.

625
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,018
I got some buddies out West...

626
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,289
That's beautiful country.

627
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,093
Uh, beautiful yeah, but...

628
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,235
all anyone wants for you
is the same old stuff...

629
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,334
you know, get married,
have kids.

630
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,664
I want something different,
you know.

631
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,964
Yeah, I hear you.

632
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,400
Yeah?

633
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,070
Yeah, we're an island
of misfits.

634
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,140
I actually moved here
to be around

635
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,209
more open-minded women.

636
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,439
You still in the friendly skies?

637
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,284
No, I had to give it up.

638
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,713
Oh, after 9/11?

639
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,784
Oh, no!

640
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,785
I just kept ballooning up
on the plane food

641
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,322
No way.

642
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,753
Oh, yes way. I mean Donnie...

643
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,291
Donnie used to have
a 29 inch waist

644
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,193
I mean, I lost most
of what I put on,

645
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,057
I mean, except for my fupa...

646
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,163
but I'm fine with it.

647
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,697
Umm, with what?

648
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,031
Fupa.

649
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,395
Fat Upper Pussy Area.

650
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,033
But... it's a little fupa,
a happy fupa.

651
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,471
I would hate to see
an angry one.

652
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,038
Oh yeah we can't have that.

653
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,474
Uh, what would you recommend?

654
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,282
The chicken cutlet here
is excellent.

655
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,285
But I would stay away from
cheese tonight if I were you.

656
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,021
Why is that?

657
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,782
Clogs up your anal cavity.

658
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,458
I did not know that.

659
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:11,885
Oh, except for goat cheese.

660
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,052
You know there is some enzyme
that makes it okay.

661
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,196
This isn't good dinner
conversation, is it?

662
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,428
No, no, no... be yourself.

663
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,234
Um.. I hear zucchini
is great for down there.

664
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,136
Most veggies are...
okra is the best.

665
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,035
I'm all about anal health.

666
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,507
Oh, me too.

667
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,779
It's just good manners.

668
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,938
So, are you kids ready?

669
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:35,951
Yes.

670
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,882
I'll have the chicken fried
steak, please.

671
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,415
Chicken fried steak, you sir?

672
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,820
- Just a burger:
- Burger:

673
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,024
No cheese!

674
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,153
Oh, that's work,
I've gotta take this.

675
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,318
Okay.

676
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,333
Oh, sweetie he is fine!

677
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,862
I don't know why
you're bothering with dinner:

678
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,506
You're right put in that order;
pronto!

679
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,239
I will honey, I will.

680
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,525
That was the best sex
of my life.

681
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,159
You're so high energy.

682
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,024
You want games?

683
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,000
I'll out-slut you in a second.

684
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,236
Hey, round two at my place?

685
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,173
This time, I'll do all the work.

686
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,330
What are you doing home?

687
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,591
You're supposed to be gone all night.

688
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,136
Well, you're cleaning? It's Friday.

689
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,237
Aren't you supposed to be
bringing queers together?

690
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,303
Well,

691
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,202
It smells like poppers in here

692
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,239
Where did you have your party?

693
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,002
The police raided
our last location, so...

694
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,111
so?

695
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,144
No!

696
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,940
You got home before I could...

697
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,842
Is that shit on my bedspread?

698
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,241
That's not shit.

699
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,551
That is shit!

700
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,150
No, that is definitely not shit.

701
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,422
It's biss.

702
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,489
Biss?

703
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,557
Butt piss.

704
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,054
Oh God! That is so gross Luke,
oh my god!

705
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,127
I'm sorry! Somebody must
have gone

706
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,195
overboard with enemas.

707
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,263
I'm... I'm doing laundry now

708
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,400
Listen I was gonna tell you
but I thought maybe...

709
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,466
You thought maybe I would object

710
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,467
to a gay sex party in my bedroom?

711
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:35,899
That doesn't turn you on?

712
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,140
No, it does not turn me on.

713
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,298
That's the problem.
I'm not one of you.

714
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:41,610
Salome was rig ht

715
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,935
I've just become way too enmeshed
in your world.

716
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,313
Listen, I'm sorry.

717
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,346
I'm gonna wash everything...

718
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,541
It's OKAY because I'm
emancipating myself from this...

719
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,381
Is that biss on the table cloth?

720
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,452
It's not my biss.

721
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,385
I don't care whose biss it is!

722
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,354
And he just left a twenty.
Cheap fucker!

723
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,257
He walked out on you?

724
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,497
Just like that?

725
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,531
Were you being outrageous?

726
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,334
I may have been a little outrageous.

727
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,963
This is more than cosmetic
you know that, rig ht?

728
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,645
Make-up can clear blemishes
and stuff...

729
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,172
but not even top of the line

730
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,281
L'Oreal can fix a fucked-up face.

731
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:24,044
And what we have here
is a fucked-up face.

732
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,011
What are you saying?

733
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,123
I'm saying surgery.

734
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,252
You need to go under knife
and kill the fag hag inside.

735
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,030
Yes, okay.
She's gone.

736
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,566
Just snip her out.

737
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,634
She's dead.

738
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:40,696
Great.

739
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,402
So what are you doing Thursday?

740
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,597
Going outwith... friends.

741
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,632
It's our ritual.

742
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,205
It's your racket.

743
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,342
Are you coachable?

744
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,650
Yes, I'm coachable.
What's happening?

745
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,047
Well, a promoter friend of mine

746
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:01,055
is launching a new weekly party
Thursdays at Fine Feline.

747
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,686
Want to be my plus-one?

748
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,390
You want me to be your plus-one?

749
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:09,154
I celebrate diversity, you know that.

750
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,622
Plus I owe you one.

751
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,494
Salome, wow, I'm...

752
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,036
I'm very flattered.

753
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,599
I'm gonna have a table
with bottle service and everything.

754
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,709
Did you know Markus was running
a nursery out of our apartment?

755
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,079
Maybe.

756
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,740
Why didn't you tell me?

757
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,607
Why is nobody talking to me?

758
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,684
It's all on the blog.

759
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,282
And I'm not going to be able
to go out Thursday.

760
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,456
Why not?

761
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,024
Because you're a cock-blocker.

762
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,592
No, Riley.

763
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,196
It's because I'm never gonna
get what I want

764
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,332
if I keep repeating the same
patterns of behavior.

765
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,162
In other words... cock-blocker:

766
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,195
What should I wear on Thursday?

767
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,602
Uh.. okay let me see...

768
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,570
Let the pussy out of the bag...

769
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:00,079
Dress code: the cattier, the better.

770
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,137
Are you wearing
a fucking cat suit?

771
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,213
Thank you very much.

772
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,156
Hey Violet!

773
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,297
Here kitty, kitty, kitty

774
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,335
Hey stop!
Where are you going so fast?

775
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,470
Home.

776
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:39,267
Isn't this the outfit you wore
to the fetish ball...2007?

777
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,399
Good memory.

778
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,637
Yeah, well I always notice you.

779
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,912
Oh, you might be the only one.

780
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,248
Careful!

781
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,712
Do you ever just feel
like you don't belong anywhere?

782
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,222
Hello.

783
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,359
Why do you think
I was so big into heroin.

784
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,790
You're clean now, right?

785
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,897
Yes, two yea rs.

786
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,729
Damn.

787
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,541
Look... Violet...

788
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,508
Before I came here,
before you ever knew me,

789
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,538
no one wanted a thing
to do with me.

790
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,543
I swear, not anyone.

791
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:28,522
Well, now we have all these
friends and they...

792
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,885
They love us.

793
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,755
They shower us
with all this attention

794
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,954
Yeah, I mean,
that doesn't hurt either:

795
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,629
Well, attention doesn't sleep
with you at night...

796
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,907
well, not with me.

797
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,708
Come here

798
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:55,817
It's alright.

799
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,041
Sorry.

800
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,441
No, it's not you. It's just...

801
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,313
I'm positive, you know.

802
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,609
It's just kissing.

803
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,944
Some people won't even
share the same spoon.

804
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,452
Some people are stupid.

805
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,586
Ah, I'm stupid.

806
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,022
Why am I kissing a gay boy?
God!

807
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,329
I'm retired.

808
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,362
Retired?

809
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,501
I want to be wanted, Zeus.

810
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,000
It's not fair to me, okay?

811
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,304
This fruit fly is finished.

812
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,577
<i>You have one new frisky friend.</i>

813
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,048
<i>Hi! Salome...</i>

814
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,617
<i>My dad owns the general store
of the Idaho town</i> where <i>I grew up</i>

815
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,485
<i>He expected me ta take it aver,</i>

816
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,888
<i>but I came ta New York
ta became an architect.</i>

817
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,762
<i>I'm Vern and Pd love
to hear your story.</i>

818
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,563
Vern?

819
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,497
Violet!
Hey, are you home?

820
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,968
No.

821
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,460
Can we talk?

822
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,704
No.

823
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,931
Are you on that phone line again?

824
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,074
No!

825
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,634
I need love.

826
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,679
Me too.

827
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,351
I miss Darian.

828
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,022
You try too hard,
women don't do that.

829
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,092
I am just being myself.

830
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,024
Exactly.
Stop it.

831
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:58,473
Now just close your eyes
and simply ask the universe.

832
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:05,771
The benevolent universe will
always manifest what you need.

833
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,813
That's not true.

834
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,575
If I fall from a ten-story building,

835
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,116
am I gonna manifest wings?

836
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:17,091
No. But you can manifest a truckload
of mattresses on the street below.

837
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,995
You watch too many cartoons.

838
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,993
What?
It could happen.

839
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,566
Gerald?

840
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:26,827
Salome.

841
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,403
How are you gorgeous?

842
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,800
Can I get you a non-fat soy latte?

843
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:34,601
Yes... what a coincidence.

844
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,540
See Violet, I was just manifesting
a non-fat soy latte.

845
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,578
Fine Feline was major; huh?

846
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,547
So major.

847
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,714
Well, Violet didn't like it.

848
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,151
Not major:

849
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,088
Oh, cat-woman.

850
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,186
Go on Gerald...

851
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:58,992
Don't forget 16 splendas
and a stir-stick, thanks.

852
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,469
Voila.

853
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,898
Notice my lack of effort?

854
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,464
The lesson here is that the universe

855
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,632
would never tell you to put on
a pleather catsuit...

856
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,710
so don't try so hard next time, ok?

857
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,178
Oh, I'm not going back
to Fine Feline again.

858
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,079
You promised you were coachable.

859
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,651
I'm gonna coach myself.

860
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,516
You can't coach yourself!

861
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,919
You'll never manifest a man
that way.

862
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,892
There's more then one way
to skin a cat.

863
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,964
That's funny... not true.

864
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,193
But funny.

865
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,064
<i>Yeah, when we meet, I'll take
you an a tour of lust gems.</i>

866
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,732
<i>I'm very sentimental when it
comes ta architecture.</i>

867
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,242
I adore sentimental men, Vern.

868
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:44,905
<i>We'll start with the Roxy.</i>

869
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,844
The Roxy! You've been?

870
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,985
<i>Spanish inspired interior,
the soaring columns,</i>

871
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,711
<i>it's rococo style rotunda</i>

872
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,922
The Roxy had a rococo rotunda?

873
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,990
<i>I really wish I could have seen it.</i>

874
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,989
Oh my gosh,
I used to go all the time.

875
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,560
<i>Haw?
It was demolished in 1961.</i>

876
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:02,586
The gay club?

877
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,192
<i>No!
The Roxy was a movie palace</i>

878
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:06,591
<i>Where the Rockettes began.</i>

879
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,169
The high-kicking, showgirl Rockettes?

880
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,097
<i>Originally they were
the Roxy-ettes.</i>

881
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,933
<i>Oh, the Roxy.</i>

882
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,940
<i>You know there's a famous
Life Magazine shot</i>

883
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,578
<i>of Gloria Swanson standing
on the rubble</i>

884
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:19,044
<i>in a red baa
as they tare it dawn.</i>

885
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,583
Gloria Swanson in a red boa?

886
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,578
I have manifested a fag stag.

887
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:26,813
You manifested a fag.

888
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,888
Gloria Steinem never wore a boa.

889
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,248
Gloria Swanson.
Vern is straight!

890
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,891
Bradleigh, do straight men
know who Gloria Swanson is?

891
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,064
Norma Desmond?
Only if they're gay.

892
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,130
Come on!

893
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,599
Only gays obsess over faded,
deluded, once beautiful women.

894
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,537
We can relate.

895
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:43,569
See!

896
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,001
Climax Magazine is here.

897
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,541
Marjorie Max.

898
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,766
Violet, skedaddle.

899
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,612
Gentlemen.

900
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:52,713
Marjorie!

901
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:54,749
Right this way.

902
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,586
The inspiration for this season is
punk, Pocahontas and prehistoric.

903
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,684
Clever: I see we're into alliteration.

904
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,792
This frill must be the “prehistoric”.

905
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,991
Pterodactyl in heat?

906
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,634
More or less.

907
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:23,172
Ah, fur. You have no qualms about
killing these cute little critters?

908
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,578
Bradleigh says fur comes from trees.

909
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:26,813
Fir trees.

910
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,780
Look at me, pretending to care.

911
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,981
I just don't see how it
fits in to my story.

912
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,253
I've seen you in Climax before.

913
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,186
I modeled for the magazine
once, yes.

914
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,662
Oh don't remind me,
long time ago.

915
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,893
It was a matinee idol story?

916
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:47,967
Yeah.

917
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,866
This mug once was very lucrative.

918
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,973
And perfect for the "Daddy"

919
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,338
in this fall's editorial shot
by Stephen Miser!

920
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,872
Stephen Miser? Oh be still
my beating heart.

921
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,070
What's the story?

922
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,316
I love Daddy!

923
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,082
But I'm not old enough
to be a Daddy.

924
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,325
Tell you what.

925
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:16,222
You be Climax magazine's “Daddy”
and I'll give Bradleigh's

926
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:20,927
prehistoric line some
p-p-p-placement.

927
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:25,036
Get ready for your close up,
Norma.

928
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,376
Do you have a minute
for the children?

929
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,239
You have got to be kidding me!

930
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,244
Excuse me sir; do you have
a minute for the children?

931
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,319
Baby I'm home.

932
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,259
Jim had a hysterectomy.

933
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,896
Hey Violet is not coming
to your reading,

934
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,087
I think she's boycotting us.

935
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,199
I can't believe I had
to give him a hysterectomy.

936
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,766
It's changed everything.

937
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,101
What?

938
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,202
Jim, in my novel.

939
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:56,995
Sorry for Jim.

940
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,433
How was your day, honey?

941
00:44:58,929 --> 00:44:59,873
Oh great.

942
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,806
Bradleigh says you can join for
our trip to Taipei in November.

943
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:05,913
What trip?

944
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,279
Remember Bradleigh won
Designer of the Year in Taiwan?

945
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:13,182
Right. But, you know in November
I'll be in edits.

946
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,915
Baby, you can bring
your computer to Taipei.

947
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,323
Come on, it's
all-expense paid travel.

948
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,427
It'll advance my career:

949
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,923
A chance to forget babies
and hysterectomies.

950
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,998
Oh my God, don't remind me.
It's so sad!

951
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,897
So, are you in?

952
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,807
Could we maybe swing by
Polynesia on the way to Taipei?

953
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,966
You know, Ashley showed me
this great new site.

954
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:38,170
There's not much red tape,
they make it so much easier.

955
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:39,313
What site?

956
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,940
Adoptakanakababy.com

957
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,317
Baby let's just check it out.
No strings.

958
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,048
It might break up the monotony
of our lives.

959
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,453
The monotony of our lives?

960
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,987
Yeah. You know, maybe that's why
Violet is boycotting us.

961
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,960
Change is good.

962
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,867
Come on baby, relax.

963
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,103
Feels nice?

964
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,305
Yeah, come on.

965
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,867
That smell, is that?

966
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:07,974
Baby oil.

967
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,368
Isn't it wonderful?

968
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,884
Polynesia is on the way
to Taiwan, right?

969
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,746
No...

970
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,885
If you suck cock, hang up now.

971
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,320
If you think you might enjoy
sucking cock in the future,

972
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,926
hang up now.

973
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:29,487
Vern?
Hello, Vern?

974
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:30,797
<i>I'm not gay-</i>

975
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,994
But you go to gay bars, right?

976
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,464
<i>Why in the world would
I do that?</i>

977
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,907
Oh, well I had to ask.

978
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,439
So, what are you into?

979
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:43,010
<i>What do you mean?</i>

980
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,974
I mean, what are you
passionate about?

981
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,243
<i>Web', what I do
Architecture.</i>

982
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,512
<i>I'm especially fascinated
with columns.</i>

983
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:53,787
Columns?

984
00:46:56,513 --> 00:47:00,552
Wanna talk about
thick, rock hard shafts?

985
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:02,323
<i>What about them?</i>

986
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:06,862
How about putting them up
my chimney pot, Mn Architect. Yeah?

987
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,806
Then stucco my flying buttress
to the wall!

988
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,342
<i>Uh, Salome,
I'm just a normal guy.</i>

989
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:16,302
I can do normal.

990
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,275
<i>I want to be up front
and let you know</i>

991
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,506
<i>I'm looking for
a simple kind of woman.</i>

992
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,579
That's me, I'm a simple girl.
From Idaho.

993
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,119
My face is rural too!

994
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,587
I have an ample bosom and a...

995
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,448
well, my whole body
is kind of ample.

996
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,528
I really wanna meet you
and get frisky but

997
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,296
if you're expecting some,
I don't know,

998
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:37,523
thin-hipped bitch who's gonna...

999
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,560
<i>I'm nut!</i>

1000
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:39,559
You're not?

1001
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,869
<i>Nu, I want a keeper, Salome.</i>

1002
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,071
Me, too.

1003
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,576
And it's Violet.
I lied.

1004
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,913
<i>Well, we all fib an Frisky Friends.</i>

1005
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:54,939
So what's your real name?

1006
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,217
I mean, I know it's not Vern.

1007
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,317
<i>Nu, it is Vern.</i>

1008
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,947
Oh, well you have
a nickname or anything?

1009
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,316
<i>My parents call me Chippy.</i>

1010
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,094
So, Vern, what did you fib about?

1011
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,956
<i>I don't know exactly
but I probably did fib</i>

1012
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:15,102
<i>Now that I know your name, Violet,
do you stiff wanna meet?</i>

1013
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,637
Bethesda fountain.
Same time?

1014
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,906
<i>10 am and I'll be wearing red.</i>

1015
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,008
Red hot.
Can't wait!

1016
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,536
You did lie.

1017
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,644
Oh I can't take it this!

1018
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:58,673
Hello?

1019
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,344
Vern you are a liar!
I can't take this!

1020
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,142
No, no I can't!
I can't!

1021
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,151
Help! Help!

1022
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,982
Please!
No, I just can't!

1023
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,088
Get away from me you lunatic!

1024
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,019
Everyone's a fucking freak.

1025
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,161
I just can't deal with this anymore.

1026
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,458
Violet, is that you?

1027
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,665
What are you doing down there?

1028
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:20,330
Did you loose a contact
or something?

1029
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:22,503
Vern?

1030
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,009
You must be Daddy.

1031
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,344
Riley.

1032
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,003
Hi, I'm Jenny.
Matt's mom.

1033
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,576
He looks like a complete angel,
doesn't he?

1034
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:37,550
Don't be fooled.

1035
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,710
He's an absolutely
unmanageable child.

1036
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,622
So was I.

1037
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,057
You have kids?

1038
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,026
I'm gay.

1039
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,294
No, no kids.

1040
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,364
Alright if you worked
a Stephen Miser set,

1041
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,761
You know I don't wanna hear anyone,

1042
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:54,196
I don't wanna see anyone

1043
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,996
Unless it's through my lens.

1044
00:49:56,693 --> 00:50:00,607
Child. Love your Daddy, hmm?

1045
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,241
Mn Miser; I'm

1046
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,343
Poof!

1047
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:04,565
Matt?

1048
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,531
No! I wanna stay with Riley.

1049
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:11,136
Hey it's ok buddy, your mom and I,
we're gonna make plans. I promise.

1050
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,873
Gotta go. C'mon hun.
Sweetie!

1051
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,718
The UN is the first
international building in the US.

1052
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,246
I suppose that concludes our tour:

1053
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,290
I loved it.

1054
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,123
Should we go for drinks?

1055
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,360
Why in the world would I
want to do that

1056
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:39,598
When I can be with you alone.

1057
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,461
Do you go drinking a lot?

1058
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:43,627
I wouldn't say that.

1059
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,242
I may have partied a little
in my youth.

1060
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:49,673
But that is behind me.

1061
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,245
You're so beautiful.

1062
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,455
Your place or mine?

1063
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,516
You don't want to go home together
on our first date?

1064
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,425
No! umm no!
Of course not.

1065
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,657
I'm totally teasing.

1066
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,234
Funny lady.

1067
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,462
Come on. Let me walk you home.

1068
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:50,660
Oh, baby you're home.

1069
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:51,771
I'm almost ready.

1070
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:53,807
So.

1071
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,703
I checked out
adoptakanakababy.com.

1072
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,674
You did?

1073
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,314
And?

1074
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,543
And I didn't see anything
about refunds or exchanges.

1075
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,580
I also never imagined
in my entire gay life

1076
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,988
that the topic of children
would ever come up.

1077
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:18,459
Neither did I. But I guess
secretly I hoped that it would.

1078
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:22,835
What is that?

1079
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:23,937
Markus

1080
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:26,540
I love you

1081
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,506
I want you to have everything
you want.

1082
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:30,639
Even if it's not what you want?

1083
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,773
How will I know if we don't
get a chance to practice?

1084
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:37,650
Oh my god.

1085
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,515
You got me a Toy Pomeranian?

1086
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,313
You wanted a Toy Pomeranian
since you were ten.

1087
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,524
Well, that or a Chihuahua...

1088
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,354
and you know how I feel about rats.

1089
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,525
You've been reading my blog.

1090
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,493
Oh, Thank you.

1091
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,521
I thought you were an ex-Mormon?

1092
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,058
I left the church,
but I haven't been excommunicated.

1093
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,325
Stick with me kid.

1094
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,593
Wait a minute.

1095
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:27,861
If you're not a Mormon,

1096
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:29,662
why can't you enjoy
a glass of wine with me?

1097
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,770
I don't like it.

1098
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,336
You told me you've
never had a drink.

1099
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,608
I haven't.

1100
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:36,304
How do you know
you don't like it?

1101
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,374
Do I need to sleep with a man
to know I don't like it?

1102
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,319
You know them?

1103
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,922
Ah, co-workers.

1104
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,784
Actually they are pretty great.

1105
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:56,720
Umm...we could go out with them
sometime, if you wanted to.

1106
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,326
Where would we go?

1107
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,092
We could go to a gay ban

1108
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,869
I think that'd be too much
anthropology for this architect.

1109
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,036
I told you I'm not very social.

1110
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,769
Where do you go for fun?

1111
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:11,878
To sleep.

1112
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,582
I prefer to have my fun early.

1113
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:16,877
I'm a big fan
of column-watching.

1114
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,352
Column-watching?

1115
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:20,419
Yeah.

1116
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,579
Tomorrow I'll be up before 5
to catch them at sunrise.

1117
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:23,856
Holy fuck!

1118
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:24,957
Sunrise?

1119
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,617
Yeah, sunrise is my favorite
time of day.

1120
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,527
Well, if you want to catch the worm.

1121
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,757
Or if you wanna see
Corinthian columns come to life.

1122
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,525
So, you just uh...

1123
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:35,768
sit there and stare?

1124
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,632
It's a form of meditation for me.

1125
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:38,864
We all have our own way
of getting centered

1126
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:40,837
in this crazy city and that's mine.

1127
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,472
Absolutely sweetie.

1128
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:43,667
I mean whatever it takes.

1129
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,145
You must think I'm freak.

1130
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:47,141
- Most people think I'm a freak.
- Most people think I'm a freak.

1131
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,573
No!

1132
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,412
No, actually I don't.

1133
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,784
And I think columns are magnificent.

1134
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:58,582
Do you want to watch them with me?

1135
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,788
You might have to sleep over
if you did.

1136
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:02,963
Check!

1137
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:10,864
Oh, okay.

1138
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:24,151
Have my babies, have my babies

1139
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:26,519
What?

1140
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,553
Just making sure the condom
is still on.

1141
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:29,621
Of course it is.

1142
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,929
Have my babies, have my babies!

1143
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,825
Move to Idaho
and have Chippy's babies.

1144
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:51,768
Look.

1145
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,138
Look now

1146
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,115
Are you sleeping through this?

1147
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,474
No, just resting my eyes.

1148
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,954
Watch as the sun dances across
the granite at each new moment.

1149
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,222
Watch.

1150
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,063
Look, magic.

1151
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,197
Hey! Guess what?

1152
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,731
You got a dog.

1153
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:18,838
How'd you know?

1154
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:19,906
Women know.

1155
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,510
I also know that you were
never going to get a dog.

1156
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,839
You have to bend over and pick
up the poop. Remember?

1157
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,773
Baby makes Markus happy
so I've changed.

1158
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:32,916
You called a dog Baby?

1159
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,714
You are such a lesbian.

1160
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,880
Markus named him
but thank you Donna.

1161
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:37,956
How's the hymen?

1162
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:39,218
You know my hymen -

1163
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:40,560
hanging in there.

1164
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:43,992
Come over tonight, meet Baby.

1165
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:45,097
Oh, I can't.

1166
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,199
Dinner with Vern.

1167
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,558
Pre-game before Zeus' benefit
at Vlada?

1168
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:49,795
Oh, that's Friday night.

1169
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:50,869
Oh shit!

1170
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,267
I have plans with Vern Friday night.

1171
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:53,767
Vern, Vern, Vern.

1172
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:54,807
Bring Vern.

1173
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,272
Uhm

1174
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,635
I don't think he's gonna
want to go.

1175
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,274
We're all dying to meet him.

1176
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,282
The timing is just not right.

1177
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,712
I'm just not comfortable having him
know about my past.

1178
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:08,915
What's wrong with your past?

1179
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,080
Oh, please don't take it personal.

1180
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:12,292
You know the truth is

1181
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,956
I don't even know if Vern's my type.

1182
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:16,290
So you'd rather be with him

1183
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,155
than with us for a cause
you've always supported?

1184
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,732
Don't worry, I'll stop by.

1185
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:21,897
You act like it's such a burden.

1186
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,002
I said I'll stop by,
so leave it alone.

1187
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,608
Dating is stressful enough without
this extra pressure from you,

1188
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,710
and texts from Luke.

1189
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:34,110
And these super pokes from friends
on Facebook I don't even know!

1190
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:38,985
Love,

1191
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,120
Vern

1192
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,311
It's tough being popular.

1193
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,558
I'm gonna name my first born Daisy.

1194
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:48,895
It's that time of the month, huh?

1195
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,999
- I hate when men do that.
- Why do men always say that?

1196
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:56,669
Wow.

1197
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,101
The billionaire that got away
used to send me pink daisies.

1198
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:05,710
Letting him get away
is the biggest regret of my life.

1199
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,939
Not because we had anything
in common, we didn't.

1200
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,915
But it was this game he loved
called Snooker:

1201
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,019
What's that?

1202
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:14,948
I don't really know.

1203
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,152
And your point is?

1204
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,020
My point is...

1205
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,718
I never bothered to learn Snooker...

1206
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:24,296
and now he's on a yacht in
the Maldives with someone who did.

1207
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,293
Was the sex good?

1208
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:28,998
Standard missionary.

1209
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:30,999
Vern, too.

1210
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:32,670
Really vanilla.

1211
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,040
I mean just...

1212
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,642
we don't have that much
in common, either:

1213
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:36,743
Violet...

1214
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,002
this guy sends you flowers.

1215
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,282
He actually likes you.

1216
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,946
He does, he likes me.

1217
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,881
So he's got possibility.

1218
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,655
And compatibility is not possibility.

1219
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,784
All you've got to do now...

1220
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,117
is fake interest
in what interests him.

1221
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:56,755
And then after that he's yours
to mold any old way you want.

1222
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:00,792
Am I right Donna?

1223
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:06,931
What the fuck do you want?

1224
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:09,775
You should want this.

1225
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,674
He's boring.

1226
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,337
Do you want to be loved,
or do you want to be entertained?

1227
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,214
I want to be entertained?

1228
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:17,817
No, no, no!!

1229
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:19,180
What happened to my
vegan wedding?

1230
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:20,843
Yeah, okay...

1231
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,048
Yes, fine I stole
your stanky ass strap-on!

1232
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:29,263
In a roundabout way, Donna
is supporting what I'm saying.

1233
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:30,397
I doubt that.

1234
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,764
And... what are you saying?

1235
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,338
Compatibility is not possibility.

1236
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,961
Violet...

1237
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,332
learn the Snooker.

1238
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:05,955
You watching me?

1239
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,435
Maybe...

1240
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,272
How are things going
at the salon?

1241
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,736
Ahh...drama.

1242
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,475
Had to fire my receptionist.

1243
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:18,845
She was a bitch.

1244
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:19,911
Yeah.

1245
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,215
Shall we...

1246
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,986
call a truce to the dueling sluts?

1247
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:29,756
Maybe.

1248
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:34,289
You're here!!

1249
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,463
Oh my god! Did you see
the silent auction?

1250
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:39,223
No!

1251
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,595
I made Markus put money
on Liza Minelli's g-string.

1252
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:42,768
And I'm winning!

1253
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,267
You guys are bombed.

1254
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,204
Open bar. Hello!

1255
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:49,365
What can we get you to drink?

1256
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,069
No, nothing I can't be drunk
when I see Vern

1257
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,407
Oh, sorry I missed your reading.

1258
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:55,882
Oh, that's okay.

1259
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,348
Violet turned down a free drink?

1260
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,254
I know, she's... not herself.
I told you.

1261
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,259
Thank you so much for all
your support and encouragement.

1262
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,498
Just wait, I mention you
in my speech.

1263
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:12,764
To think you used to let
people assume

1264
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,902
you were just some dumb stripper:

1265
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:17,903
Cha-ching!
I have found it's best not to

1266
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,266
challenge people's assumptions.

1267
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:22,204
Who said a go-go boy
can't be the hero?

1268
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,102
I know...

1269
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,072
Hey you gonna join us
on Thursday at Gym Bar?

1270
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,509
I won't.

1271
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,317
In fact tonight...

1272
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:33,182
is sort of my cameo appearance.

1273
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,055
Retirement?

1274
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:38,815
What's that about?

1275
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:42,122
Come on. It sounds like you're
running away from home to me.

1276
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:44,064
I'm doing what's best for me.

1277
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,797
Are you sure about this?

1278
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,229
You wanna talk about it?

1279
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:49,798
I'd love to...

1280
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:51,838
but it's the pumpkin hour:

1281
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,032
Congratulations.

1282
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,008
6:30?

1283
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,303
You can't leave.

1284
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:58,411
You're gonna miss my speech.

1285
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,143
No, you can't leave.

1286
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,383
Come on... stay and then...

1287
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,541
Afterwards you can
come back to my place...

1288
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,354
we'll bake cookies, watch Beaches.

1289
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:09,821
I have Kylie Karaoke.

1290
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,856
I love Kylie Karaoke!

1291
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,118
Well, then say yes.

1292
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,585
I'm terrified of rejection.

1293
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,488
Oh, you have never been rejected!

1294
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,091
In your life.

1295
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:23,469
You have no idea.

1296
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,870
And Zeus said you're working
on an anti-violence benefit next.

1297
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,170
And one for the Trevor Project
after that.

1298
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,136
I'm impressed.

1299
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,280
Thanks.

1300
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:35,939
Yeah, Zeus is really insistent
we reach out to

1301
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,049
straight people too, which is...

1302
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,414
kind of intimidating
since I don't know any.

1303
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,318
Except for Violet, but yeah...

1304
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:43,489
always Violet.

1305
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:45,883
This sounds like a great opportunity.

1306
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,654
Who knows there might be
hope for you yet.

1307
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,761
What do you mean hope for me?

1308
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:54,491
Just hope... you break out
of your limited gay world.

1309
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,296
Oh, that's rich coming
from a hairdresser:

1310
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,339
Hair-stylist.

1311
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,235
Whatever:
Still not much hope for you.

1312
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,467
Can you please stop with the games?

1313
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:03,770
You started the games.

1314
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:04,638
Well, I'm through.

1315
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,106
You want to keep playing,
play with someone else.

1316
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,180
I often do.

1317
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:13,209
Max, I just want you to know
that you are this close to having me.

1318
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,617
Luke, I'm really sorry
but I can't talk now.

1319
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,982
He is on the clock.

1320
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,556
Oh, for Heaven sake!

1321
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:24,597
Zeus

1322
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:25,898
kiss me.

1323
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,296
Luke, I am flattered.

1324
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:28,332
Don't be.

1325
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:29,663
Just take me home and ravage me.

1326
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:31,895
Ah Zeus, I've got issues.

1327
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:34,163
Yes, you do.

1328
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:35,668
You got issues too.

1329
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,306
Are we gonna be alone forever?

1330
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:40,140
It depends on your definition
of alone, doesn't it?

1331
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:42,546
How long have you been
in the city now?

1332
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,017
About 4 yea rs.

1333
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,346
4 years and I have never once
seen you with a boyfriend.

1334
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:47,653
Nope.

1335
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,455
You never come
to my sex parties either:

1336
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:51,380
You know I have poz events.

1337
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,025
They're not my thing.

1338
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,121
So what gets you going, big boy?

1339
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,060
It's way off your radar:

1340
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,631
I wonder if you'd even treat me
the same if you knew.

1341
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:04,170
Two boys, one plunger:

1342
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,931
Ewww, no.

1343
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,107
Bartender; can I get a drink?

1344
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:09,208
One second.

1345
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,504
What happened to Violet?

1346
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,104
She just bolted out of here.

1347
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:13,605
What's going on with your BFF?

1348
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,149
My BFF is MIA.

1349
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:18,107
She is umm...

1350
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,515
She's dating somebody.

1351
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,121
What?

1352
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:23,279
Wh...who?

1353
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,254
Who's she dating?

1354
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,229
Unicorn?

1355
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:33,597
The mythical Unicorn!

1356
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:34,700
Shhhh!

1357
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,365
I'm not ready to come out yet.

1358
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:37,971
Oh!

1359
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:40,231
Oh you are fascinating.

1360
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,739
Well so what? I mean
my roommate is gay.

1361
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:47,713
Does he have HIV?

1362
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,048
No.

1363
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,309
But what if he did?

1364
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:52,575
Well then I'd be concerned
for your health and safety.

1365
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:56,220
See, this is why we need
to make HIV stigma-free.

1366
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,192
Why shouldn't HIV have a stigma?

1367
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,259
I mean it is preventable.

1368
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,419
What about 70's high-rises
and pre-fabricated homes,

1369
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,189
they have a stigma, right?

1370
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,601
Okay, but we're talking about people.

1371
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:09,361
People, not buildings.

1372
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,469
What is wrong with you?

1373
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:11,503
You're absolutely right.

1374
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,230
I'm sorry, I'm just frustrated.

1375
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:15,376
I've been after these Biedermeier
chairs on e-bay all day.

1376
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,441
Oh, well...

1377
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,340
If you're outbid, there'll be others.

1378
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:19,536
You're a patient man.

1379
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,342
It's not everyday you find matching
Beidermeier chairs on e-bay.

1380
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,041
Where would they fit in
your apartment?

1381
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,413
I'm shipping them back
to my folks with all the rest.

1382
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,487
Oh, you're moving back?

1383
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,289
Eventually.

1384
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,391
Idaho's not really
column country, I'm afraid.

1385
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,556
Bonneville is one of the fastest
growing counties in the country.

1386
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,258
So there is plenty of work, and
I'll be renovating the homestead.

1387
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:42,668
You'd love my folks.

1388
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,037
Would you ever consider moving back?

1389
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,309
I kinda moved away on purpose.

1390
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:50,733
Me, too.

1391
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,345
But I look around at my friends

1392
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:53,605
and co-workers and...

1393
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,215
they don't mean much.

1394
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,177
I think what really matters is...

1395
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:01,788
who matters.

1396
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,359
Vern,

1397
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,494
teach me about the Snooker

1398
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:09,595
I mean the Beidermeier.

1399
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,157
Why do you love it so?

1400
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,460
Beidermeier is an
unpretentious classic.

1401
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:17,460
Devoid of...

1402
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,834
unnecessary embellishment.

1403
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,075
You can keep taking things off,
you know.

1404
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:37,481
Not to change the subject,
but have you had cheese today?

1405
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,316
I don't think so.

1406
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:44,153
I took this tantric class
on the sacred spot massage.

1407
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,424
Would you let me...

1408
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:47,823
help you release
some of that e-bay tension?

1409
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,565
Babe, you could show Le Corbusier
the golden ratio in a Frank Gehry.

1410
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,835
Now, just relax and trust me.

1411
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:02,415
Ooops, sorry!

1412
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:03,481
My bad.

1413
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:12,291
Who's that?

1414
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:13,358
Oh never mind, just relax.

1415
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:14,754
I got 8 inches for you.

1416
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:19,458
You want my 8 inches?

1417
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:21,767
What, you gonna fuck me twice?

1418
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,406
Most men hold their tension
in the pelvic floor

1419
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,565
which is why the sacred spot
massage is so important.

1420
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:31,912
I mean it really makes you
more peaceful.

1421
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,444
That's why you don't see the gays
marching off to war.

1422
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:38,550
Who's that?

1423
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,483
Shhhh.

1424
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,645
Okay, here we go.

1425
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,493
That's so wild.

1426
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,600
It's good, ha?

1427
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,465
Chippy likes it wild.

1428
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:04,869
Wild is good.

1429
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,242
Hey, I can see you're busy,
but can I borrow a condom.

1430
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,521
Take this blindfold off.

1431
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:27,933
Violet, you can't live like this.

1432
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,428
I got to get you out of here now.

1433
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:30,970
Come on you can stay with me.

1434
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:32,203
Okay, I'll pack.

1435
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:33,567
Let's just go.

1436
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:34,639
Now.

1437
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:35,741
OkaY

1438
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:36,808
Help?

1439
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:37,977
Oh!

1440
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,633
Ashley adopted in Namibia.

1441
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:03,592
How was that experience?

1442
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,432
Better than giving birth,

1443
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:09,232
Actually I'm not so sure,
Africa can be notoriously difficult.

1444
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,402
Joey, play nice!

1445
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,683
So what are you writing
these days?

1446
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,976
No more fiction, no.

1447
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,253
Now I write daily blogs
about my children.

1448
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:24,890
Children?

1449
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,288
Number two is on the way.

1450
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:29,756
Darling, today blogs begin
at conception.

1451
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:33,432
Mommy I gotta go.

1452
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:34,590
Not now.

1453
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,669
Oh she's so cranky when
she's teething.

1454
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,504
I had to go to the doctor to get
some Xanax just to get through it.

1455
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:54,053
It's your other daddy!

1456
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:55,514
He'?-

1457
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:57,713
Hey Matt.

1458
01:11:57,913 --> 01:11:58,891
How are you doing?

1459
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:04,689
Where is my big boy?

1460
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:06,491
Come here!

1461
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,464
Oh, you okay?

1462
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:09,868
We're fine.

1463
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:10,969
I'm Markus.

1464
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,863
Oh Markus, I'm Jenny.

1465
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,771
This is Riley's boyfriend,
I mean partner:

1466
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,036
I never know what to say.

1467
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:18,571
We never know either.

1468
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:19,906
Husband, actually.

1469
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:21,874
Markus is my husband.

1470
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:26,315
Husband, husband, husband

1471
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:38,022
I want these personally
delivered to <i>77</i> 7th Avenue

1472
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:42,998
My boyfriend bought it for me.

1473
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,606
No.

1474
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:47,740
What?

1475
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:50,805
What's so goddamned funny?

1476
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,943
Well, I'm not laughing with you.

1477
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:58,407
What have you manifested?

1478
01:12:58,907 --> 01:12:59,977
He's in your office.

1479
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:06,625
Donna!

1480
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:07,760
Boss?

1481
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,994
I finally found the inspiration
for my fall line:

1482
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,923
Bedouin tents.

1483
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:14,467
Yeah?

1484
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,569
I understand they're
mildew-resistant.

1485
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:20,833
Is it that hideous?

1486
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,076
It's just... not you, is all.

1487
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:25,610
Well,

1488
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,074
Vern likes me this way

1489
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,107
I'm gonna pretend like
I didn't hear that.

1490
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:31,543
I know what you're thinking.

1491
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,381
Yeah, probably.

1492
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,656
What if I wanna get married
and move far, far away?

1493
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,557
What?

1494
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:39,749
Audrey did it.

1495
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:42,452
And I can only assume
she's very happy.

1496
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:43,853
You're not Audrey.

1497
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:46,860
I turned 40 this year; Riley. 40!

1498
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:48,626
I'm like the oldest living fag hag.

1499
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:49,667
Vern...

1500
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:52,465
Vern might be my last chance
to settle down.

1501
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:54,869
Settle just about sums it up.

1502
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:58,101
You are not a woman.
You do not know the pressures...

1503
01:13:58,467 --> 01:13:59,468
I know you!

1504
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:00,511
So?

1505
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:03,445
So you've never covered up.
You've never ignored your friends.

1506
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:06,552
And you told me to kill you dead
if you ever; ever changed fora man.

1507
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:09,951
You told me to kill you if ever;
ever you changed for a man.

1508
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:11,916
How have 1...?

1509
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:15,593
Sure it's just the dog
being housebroken?

1510
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,193
Okay.

1511
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:19,498
Okay?

1512
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:20,531
Okay.

1513
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:21,633
You wanna be an asshole?

1514
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,701
I'm the asshole?

1515
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:24,837
Get over there.
Yes, you're the asshole.

1516
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:26,199
Oh fuck you.

1517
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:27,438
Fuck you!

1518
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:28,506
Yeah, roll the parachute up.

1519
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:29,734
Should we check with Vern?

1520
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:30,775
You know I'm wearing the dress,

1521
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:31,911
but I also got the balls.

1522
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:33,011
Oh that's fine with me because...

1523
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,079
You wanna go check with Baby?

1524
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:36,482
Oh, you're on my hair!

1525
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:46,659
Oww!
No biting!

1526
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:47,793
Ouch!

1527
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:52,823
Oww!
You hit me.

1528
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,467
Bradleigh wants the camera.

1529
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,504
Okay.. that was fucking hot.

1530
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,017
It'd be an honor to model
for your ad campaign, Bradleigh.

1531
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,080
It's Brad-LAY

1532
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,848
Oh, Brad-LAY, sorry.

1533
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,892
That Marc Jacobs ad
was shot in Maine.

1534
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:25,259
Ocean was so icy my junk
just nearly shriveled right up!

1535
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,964
You're new to the city
I take it?

1536
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:30,868
Just got in last Friday.

1537
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,199
We're gonna take a quick photo.

1538
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,174
Hi, I'm Violet.

1539
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,874
Oh, hi I'm Cyd.

1540
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,137
But call me J-Flame...
everybody does.

1541
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:41,814
J-Flame?

1542
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,913
I just realized I don't have
anything that will fit you.

1543
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:49,646
Oh, everything fits me.

1544
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:50,551
I'm sample size.

1545
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:51,281
True.

1546
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:53,183
You got a great look.

1547
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:56,056
I could use the color
in my ad campaign...

1548
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:59,631
or sprawled on my chinchilla rug.

1549
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,826
So lamentably the truth is you're
just too swishy

1550
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,096
to model for Bradleigh.

1551
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:06,605
Swishy?

1552
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:08,036
Swi-SHAY.

1553
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:11,108
But modeling only has to do
with how I look.

1554
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:14,609
Who told you that?

1555
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:24,846
What?

1556
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:26,924
Go do an email blast.

1557
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,186
When you told me last night
you loved me...

1558
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:55,287
Did you mean it?

1559
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,154
Where the hell have you been?

1560
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,591
I haven't seen you in like a week.
I have huge news.

1561
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:03,695
What the hell are you wearing?

1562
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:04,930
Vern took me shopping.

1563
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,327
Okay. Was he the Vern?

1564
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:09,057
Yes, but you know
after your rude interruption

1565
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:11,135
we spent the most amazing
week together:

1566
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,364
And I'm not gonna say anything else
because I don't wanna jinx it.

1567
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:14,673
Hello naked boy in my house.

1568
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:15,740
I'm Andre.

1569
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,134
I'm going to go grab
another cup of coffee.

1570
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:19,609
Anybody else want?

1571
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:21,136
No, thanks.

1572
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,216
He won't leave.

1573
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,977
You might soon be in the market
for a new roommate.

1574
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,280
What do you mean?
You're not leaving.

1575
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,123
Things are moving kinda quickly.

1576
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:31,382
I haven't even met Vern.

1577
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,124
I think that's why
they are going so great.

1578
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,125
I also happen to know that you're
keeping him from Markus and Riley.

1579
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:37,388
How can you be nesting with someone

1580
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:38,925
who doesn't even know
your best friends?

1581
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,691
How could he possibly know you?

1582
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:43,768
What's your huge news?

1583
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:45,767
I found your fag stag.

1584
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:47,970
Fine as fine can be...

1585
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,971
and honey, he is into you.

1586
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:51,242
I know him?

1587
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,242
Yes!

1588
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:53,311
Who?

1589
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:54,979
When am I meeting Vern?

1590
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:56,411
You're not.

1591
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,740
Okay, are you ashamed
of your friends?

1592
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,648
Or you ashamed of yourself, huh?

1593
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:03,282
I could live here.

1594
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,682
Oh boy.

1595
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,423
Oh, Saturday afternoon is great.

1596
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:11,889
Oh, I don't know.

1597
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:13,898
What about you?

1598
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:21,969
I'd really like to go to Central Park.

1599
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,869
We could stroll through the rambles...

1600
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,343
picnic at Cherry Hill...

1601
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:30,706
gaze at the Dakota?
Mmm hmm...

1602
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,252
I prefer to wait for the light.

1603
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,414
There's no traffic.

1604
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:41,826
There's no traffic!

1605
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:43,257
It's one of the ways
I practice patience.

1606
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,420
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1607
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,426
What are you gonna do with me?

1608
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,360
Practice patience.

1609
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:21,331
Lot of men checking you out.

1610
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:27,965
Oh, hi Violet!

1611
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,837
Women, too.
Are you famous?

1612
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:34,172
Look. Gargoyle!

1613
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,045
What in the world
is going on here?

1614
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:42,956
I totally forgot
that this lawn is a...

1615
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:44,356
boy-hive.

1616
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,988
Vern, I am afraid that
something is about to go down

1617
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,026
and I need to tell you.

1618
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:50,492
What is it?
You can tell me anything.

1619
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:52,331
Remember my roommate?

1620
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,399
I was blindfolded at the time.

1621
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,864
He's just the tip of... you know

1622
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,333
all my life I've been a fruit fly.

1623
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,538
What?

1624
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:00,771
Fag hag?
Queen mother?

1625
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:02,431
Every last man in my life is gay.

1626
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:03,775
We'll get through this.

1627
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:04,876
Vernon, run!

1628
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:05,943
No, wait!

1629
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:07,445
What is going on here?

1630
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:08,781
This is an intervention.

1631
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,181
Just give me a minute.

1632
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,373
No, please.
We want him to stay.

1633
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,416
Who are you people?

1634
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:13,348
We're her friends

1635
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:14,418
More than friends.

1636
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:16,947
In a totally not sexual way, but...

1637
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:19,923
This is us at our first pride,
remember that?

1638
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:21,985
You've always been unconditional...

1639
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:25,229
and we support you no matter
who you choose to love.

1640
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,296
But your heterosexuality is
hurting us in the following ways:

1641
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,334
Since you met Vern,
it feels like you're

1642
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,336
becoming someone who's not Violet.

1643
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:35,099
How dare you say
I'm not good for Violet.

1644
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:37,038
Honestly, it's not about you.

1645
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:38,300
It's about hen

1646
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,218
Vern, no.

1647
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,319
Wait!

1648
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:49,353
I haven't even read mine yet.

1649
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:50,546
We just wanna be part of your life.

1650
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:54,051
I knew this was a bad idea.

1651
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:39,266
Free hugs!

1652
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:42,140
Free hugs!

1653
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:44,900
Free hug.

1654
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:01,049
Oh, frisky... great...

1655
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,272
What?!?

1656
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:19,534
You know surrogates
are really hard to come by.

1657
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:22,011
Yes, and expensive.

1658
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:24,774
The best deal is this agency in India.

1659
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:25,814
- Really?
- Yeah.

1660
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:28,318
You give them 20 grand, fly down
there with the egg and the sperm

1661
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,786
9 months later fly back
and pick up your newborn.

1662
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:32,954
Can't they just Fed-Ex the baby back?

1663
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:37,130
Well, Riley and I were thinking
about going the Polynesian route.

1664
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,963
You know Peter and I are gonna
do that for our next one.

1665
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,259
You two should really look into it.

1666
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:42,697
You might get a two-for-one special.

1667
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:44,002
Oh yeah.

1668
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,251
Are you okay, sweetie?

1669
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:01,352
Are you okay?

1670
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:03,155
What's going on?

1671
01:23:04,512 --> 01:23:05,490
You alright?

1672
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:06,959
Just breathe.

1673
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:08,459
Like Lamaze breathing...

1674
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:14,990
like that.

1675
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,067
Maybe we should have
heard them out.

1676
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:21,005
Why?

1677
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,106
We have each other now.

1678
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:24,035
My friends aren't placeholders.

1679
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:27,172
I'm not sure I like your friends.

1680
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:30,274
You're gonna have to give them
another shot.

1681
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,979
Seems like you don't like them
much either:

1682
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:35,517
Well, you're wrong.
I love them.

1683
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:37,550
Remember what you said?

1684
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,317
They are who matters...

1685
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:41,049
to me.

1686
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:42,687
Well, that's a shame
because I thought

1687
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,325
I'd be the one that mattered to you.

1688
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:46,724
Well of course you do.

1689
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,734
I've got a proposal for you.

1690
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,504
These are the renovations
to my homestead in Idaho.

1691
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,143
Outside Idaho Falls.

1692
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:02,181
I hired a contractor and
I wanted you to see the plans

1693
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:03,441
to see if you approved.

1694
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:05,417
It's a Victorian...

1695
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:07,610
lots of acreage, fresh ail:

1696
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:09,084
Aren't your parents still there?

1697
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:10,314
It's 5000 square feet...

1698
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:12,482
and my folks...
my folks would adore you.

1699
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,024
Look... here's my dad.

1700
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:19,028
I'm sure I'd love them.

1701
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:21,460
I just don't know if this
is the life for Violet.

1702
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:24,695
And I got plane tickets,
for the end of November:

1703
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,761
You got plane tickets?

1704
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:28,440
You didn't ask me.

1705
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:29,267
Will you go?

1706
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:32,139
Well, I'm going to Taiwan
with Bradleigh in November:

1707
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,438
I'm sure they'll let you off work.

1708
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:36,343
It's only couple of weeks
and if they don't...

1709
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:38,373
I make enough for two.

1710
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,553
I'd like the facade to stay original

1711
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:43,211
you know how sentimental
I am about architecture

1712
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,517
but the interior needs
to be totally gutted.

1713
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,485
You have this whole thing
worked out, don't you?

1714
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:52,122
They're just plans.
They can change.

1715
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,265
What about my life here?

1716
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:56,761
We'd start a whole new life.

1717
01:24:57,792 --> 01:25:00,136
Why in the world
would I want to do that?

1718
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:01,796
Idaho?

1719
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:03,364
You're kidding?

1720
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:06,178
There's like one decent gay bar
in Idaho.

1721
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:08,336
What are you saying Violet?
You're scaring me.

1722
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:09,413
And it's in Pocatello!

1723
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,242
I'm not a simple girl.

1724
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,587
I'm a complex, subversive woman

1725
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:17,313
and I can't pretend anymore
that I'm not.

1726
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,555
Vern, I have totally
misrepresented myself.

1727
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:23,662
Stop. What did I do?
What did I say?

1728
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:25,163
Nothing.

1729
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,697
Sweet Vern, I'm so sorry.

1730
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:32,404
It's not you... it's me.

1731
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:49,520
I love you.

1732
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:52,751
What did you just say?

1733
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:53,892
I said I love you.

1734
01:25:57,886 --> 01:25:58,830
What's my name?

1735
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:00,257
I am so in love with you.

1736
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:01,331
OkaY

1737
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:03,692
I think you need to go.

1738
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:05,370
But I love you.

1739
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:06,437
Yeah.

1740
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:09,808
You gotta go.

1741
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:57,721
<i>Hello ?</i>

1742
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:00,257
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
before, but I love you.

1743
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:02,426
Do you hear me?

1744
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:03,562
<i>Me tau.</i>

1745
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:06,327
And I know sucking
every last cock in the city

1746
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,226
is not the best way to show you

1747
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,127
but I am madly
in love with you Darian.

1748
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:11,459
<i>It's Dad.</i>

1749
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:12,570
What?

1750
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:14,229
<i>Luke, this is your father.</i>

1751
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:16,433
Oh my god, wrong number.

1752
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:26,317
<i>You have 473 new Frisky Friends.</i>

1753
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:02,816
I love you.

1754
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,892
I feel like I'm stuck in
A Small World.

1755
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:21,336
Hostage on a boat with all
those little Dutch kids singing.

1756
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:22,440
Okay.

1757
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:24,666
I hate this ride.

1758
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,402
Then let's get off it for a while.

1759
01:28:26,934 --> 01:28:27,912
There are other rides, you know.

1760
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,281
I know Riley...

1761
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:30,849
I know.

1762
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:33,747
We don't have to keep going
round and round on the same old one.

1763
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:37,046
No, no we don't.
We can have it all

1764
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:42,920
Now if you'd just get out
of the playpen...

1765
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:57,570
So, what do you really think
about Vern?

1766
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:00,343
I wouldn't kick him out of bed.

1767
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:03,609
That's not saying a whole lot.

1768
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:09,320
Oh my gosh,
did you hear what happened

1769
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:11,455
last night between Riley and Markus?

1770
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:12,522
No.

1771
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,489
I got the craziest text.

1772
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:15,855
What now?

1773
01:29:16,484 --> 01:29:19,294
We'll just wait and look at it
on the blog,

1774
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,361
but you know same old, same old.

1775
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:25,634
How long have those two
been together?

1776
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,432
I don't know, like 50 years.

1777
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,677
Yesterday was a disaster
on all counts.

1778
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:40,950
Hey, do you ever just think
of just like,

1779
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:44,113
I don't know quitting everything and
going back to school or something?

1780
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:45,856
School?
What would we study?

1781
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:47,651
You mean like choose a major?

1782
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:49,293
Yeah, choose a major:

1783
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,865
I'm still undecided.

1784
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:56,891
Me too.

1785
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:01,807
Pull out all the stops.
I want the works.

1786
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:03,040
You got it.

1787
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,002
I'm working Luke's sex party tonight

1788
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:06,443
and this weekend
is my debutante ball

1789
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:10,378
where I will be formally
reintroduced into gay society.

1790
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:11,581
You're coming rig ht?

1791
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:12,683
Absolutely.

1792
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:15,910
How is Luke?

1793
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:17,656
He's fine.

1794
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:20,987
He drunk dialed his dad.

1795
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:22,827
Sounds right.

1796
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:24,755
He meant to drunk dial you.

1797
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,158
If only he wasn't so stubborn,
so sarcastic.

1798
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:30,798
Luke has his problems.

1799
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:33,401
He's so infuriating.

1800
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:36,040
And yet...

1801
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:39,436
he's the only person
I want to wake up with.

1802
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,416
I do not understand why two people
who have so much in common

1803
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:45,710
just wanna pick each other
apart all the time.

1804
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:48,576
You're gonna end up
two bitter old queens

1805
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:50,017
and lord knows
we have enough of those.

1806
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:53,887
Does this necklace
make me look fat?

1807
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:56,187
Oh, come on.
I've missed you.

1808
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:57,791
I missed you too.

1809
01:30:57,919 --> 01:30:59,057
Does it make me look fat though?

1810
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,055
- No.
- Okay, good.

1811
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:03,796
I need to see your penis.

1812
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,494
I love this job.

1813
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:09,165
Uncut.
Like a little calamari.

1814
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,438
Thanks.

1815
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:14,569
Penis please.

1816
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:18,449
Grower?

1817
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:19,550
Bottom.

1818
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:23,453
Hey sweetie.
Thanks

1819
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:25,580
Hey babe.

1820
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:27,525
Go on in.

1821
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:28,786
Don't you need to see my dick?

1822
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:31,564
I'm pretty sure
you're not the police.

1823
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:33,121
Don't you want to?

1824
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:35,462
Go in.

1825
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:38,636
She's not getting it bro.

1826
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,236
Violet, I told him you'd be here.

1827
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:44,806
I'm setting you up.
Hello!?

1828
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:45,910
Fag stag.

1829
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:49,979
But you... sexy dance for men.

1830
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:56,714
You love Bette Midler,
your favorite movie is Beaches.

1831
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:02,091
Oh my god...

1832
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:06,027
You're making me blush.

1833
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:08,100
I don't think I've blushed before.

1834
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:10,024
Alright you guys.

1835
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:13,665
Take it into the back,
I will take over from here.

1836
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:22,080
Hey there.

1837
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:24,273
40 dollars and your dick please.

1838
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:26,683
What the fuck?

1839
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:27,751
Eww

1840
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:29,684
They got breeders back there.

1841
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:31,717
I only threw up a little bit Luke.

1842
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:33,916
Guys I'm just bringing
queers together:

1843
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:35,526
Yeah, queers.

1844
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,661
Split me like a wishbone!

1845
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,265
Okay, that's...

1846
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:42,558
that's pretty queen

1847
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:43,995
That's our Violet.

1848
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,099
Excuse me, do you have a minute
for the children?

1849
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:05,613
How you doing?

1850
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:07,957
You don't have my keys anymore but...

1851
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:10,754
I still have yours.

1852
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:18,862
Darian, I love you.

1853
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:22,165
I do, I love you.

1854
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:23,240
Luke...

1855
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:25,243
What?

1856
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,103
It's not gonna suck itself.

1857
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:33,211
Maybe this time around we
shouldn't begin with a blow job.

1858
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:54,929
Hey there.

1859
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:58,676
I knew you were coming.

1860
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:03,642
Actually, I'm here to see Violet.

1861
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:06,716
These aren't for me?

1862
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:07,986
No.

1863
01:34:12,747 --> 01:34:15,921
Violet, you have a visitor:

1864
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:21,356
Sorry for the mix up.
You understand.

1865
01:34:26,127 --> 01:34:27,367
Hey, how you doing sweetie?

1866
01:34:27,561 --> 01:34:28,505
Good!

1867
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,174
These are for you.

1868
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,241
Thank you very much.

1869
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:35,108
I thought I'd pop in and
surprise invite you to lunch.

1870
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,240
I'm going to lunch
with Riley and Markus.

1871
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:38,506
Couples counseling.

1872
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:39,684
Oh, okay.

1873
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:41,684
Wanna have dinner?

1874
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:43,353
Sure, great.

1875
01:34:43,978 --> 01:34:46,891
Maybe we can all get together
and do something after?

1876
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:49,855
Yes, and you'll be
at my deb. ball, yeah?

1877
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:51,221
With bells on.

1878
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:53,726
Just bells, right?

1879
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:55,299
Right.

1880
01:34:57,725 --> 01:35:01,298
Okay well... give the boys
a hug from me.

1881
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:02,668
I will, I'll call you later.

1882
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,204
Yeah.
Please do.

1883
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:07,040
I'll go to lunch with him.

1884
01:35:08,769 --> 01:35:09,713
You don't eat.

1885
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:10,848
I could learn.

1886
01:35:12,073 --> 01:35:13,211
Where did you find him?

1887
01:35:13,841 --> 01:35:14,819
Gay sex club.

1888
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:16,948
Don't be ridiculous.

1889
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:21,351
How is that possible?

1890
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:23,457
Well...

1891
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:25,989
I'd tell you, but Salome...

1892
01:35:26,153 --> 01:35:28,326
I just don't think you're coachable.

1893
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:38,305
Come on, I gotta piss.

1894
01:35:38,466 --> 01:35:40,844
Guys!
How is it going?

1895
01:35:41,302 --> 01:35:42,280
Good.

1896
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:43,915
They're in love
and I'm here with my baby.

1897
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:44,948
Waaa!

1898
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:46,710
A very colicky baby.

1899
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,885
Still sleeping in the playpen?

1900
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:52,154
My life is an open blog.

1901
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:56,752
I'm sorry, he just needed
a little fluff.

1902
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:01,092
Thank you for the poppers.

1903
01:36:03,791 --> 01:36:04,735
Hey, hey...debutante!

1904
01:36:04,892 --> 01:36:05,836
It's been ages.

1905
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:08,269
It has. I'm thrilled to be back.

1906
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,237
Ah! I can't believe he wants me.

1907
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:16,038
Violet, modesty
has never suited you.

1908
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:17,375
That's true and I love it.

1909
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:20,178
I love that you guys are finally
slobbering over my man.

1910
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:22,514
I've already installed a nanny-cam
in your bedroom.

1911
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:25,051
It's the best sex I've ever had.

1912
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:29,354
Oh my goodness. And it's not
just the sex, we have this spark.

1913
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:31,361
Well, it's not just the sex.

1914
01:36:32,419 --> 01:36:34,194
Darian, what have you done
with Luke?

1915
01:36:34,355 --> 01:36:35,425
I don't know.

1916
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:37,093
But he's trying to steamroll me
into monogamy.

1917
01:36:37,258 --> 01:36:38,236
No I am not!

1918
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:40,235
So Violet how does it feel
to be back?

1919
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:41,805
Feels so good to be home.

1920
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:44,340
And if and when you two
get your bundle of joy

1921
01:36:44,498 --> 01:36:46,273
you better make me
the fairy godmother:

1922
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:48,505
Honey, you already are.

1923
01:36:50,204 --> 01:36:51,376
Get the fuck out of my way.

1924
01:36:52,173 --> 01:36:53,846
Donna, what are you doing here?

1925
01:36:54,108 --> 01:36:55,018
Slumming.

1926
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:56,280
Hey, its Next Magazine.

1927
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:57,915
My Deb ball!

1928
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:00,482
Zeus, get over here.

1929
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:06,127
Paparazzi, no photos.

1930
01:37:09,857 --> 01:37:12,269
I beseech you, no photos!
