Trust me.
I am not a team player.

I am not an athlete.

5
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,123
I don't even know
how to swim,

6
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,191
which is
just one of the sources

7
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,227
of ridicule I've gotten
since freshman year

8
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,962
and the one
that the golden boys

9
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:31,663
of Saint Raymond's swimming
team are enjoying today.

10
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,166
That's Matt Prylek,
our school's best swimmer

11
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,567
and my worst nightmare.

12
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,536

00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,339
the one supplying
all their laughs.

to swim once

that's going on here,

16

so well either.

in this moment

that, in less than a month,

20
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:57,056
I would develop
the most unlikely friendship,

of any school rules

178
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,885
could result
in expulsion

and home schooling
until June.

180
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,357

senior year.

finally come see him, so...

184
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,499
Mr. Prylek,
I'm aware of Matthew's--

185
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,667
Kyle, please.

186
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,669
It so means
Matty's whole life.

187
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,004
Don't let
one stupid...

188

helping yourself.

Oh, sorry.
I didn't realize

193
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,881
you were still
in the meeting.

194
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,686
Uh, Coach Nadley called,
and I reconfirmed

195
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,923

196
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,858
Sorry to bother you.

197

200
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,438
I'll reduce
your suspension...

201

to a one-month
period if you'll--

202
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,009
One month?
Are you out--

203

have to do?

look up to you.

205

Stop all the bullying
immediately.

anti-bullying role model

207

I will restore

make us all look like--

I said I need to--

Come on.
It's just coffee.

232
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,529

233

Isn't that the kid whose
grandma runs the pizza joint?

talking about it.

own show and $50,000.

to do this,

your suspension

of the month.

You just have to appear
to be helping.

249
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,404

then we'll work

this whole thing.

it won't stick to you.

How?

in this for you?

on your own.

353
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,588
It's not that you're
not clean, you know.

354
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,058
I mean, of course you're
clean, but, uh, it's just...

355
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,225
I have to get to class.

356
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,564
Bro, you need my help

357
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,133
with more than just
getting a cooking team.

That's our crew.

364
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:29,087
They c--They can't
even turn up a flame.

365
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,788
You want to bet?

366
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,156
I know these two guys.

367
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,691
They're just
not here yet.

368
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,194
They're the only ones close
to being in my league.

369
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,129
Where was this side of
you out in the hallway?

370
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,630
I know my way
around the kitchen.

371
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,366
When I'm done with you,
there won't be

372
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,001
a room in the house
you've missed.

373
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,469
(LAUGHS)
That's one.

374
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,004
He's really good,
but he's quiet,

375
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,006
you know, shy,
keeps to himself.

376
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,108
Haven't heard a word
from him all last year.

377
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,443
Up until yesterday, I could
have said the same thing

378
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,512
about somebody else
around here.

379
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,514
Maybe he can't talk.

380
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,351
Okay, I got this.

381
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,789
Ahem!

382
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,161
Hi. My name is Matt,

383
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,130
and I don't sign.

384
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,197
(GIRL LAUGHS)

385
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,003
Do you have
a pen and paper?

386
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,406
I can write a note.

387
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,142
Oh. Oh, uh,
let's go outside

388
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,377
into the hallway

389
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,679
so we can talk--

390
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,814
talk--talking.

391
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,016
(AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
No worries.

392
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,852
You're starting to...

393
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,220
embarrass yourself, mate.

394
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,891
(GIGGLES)

395
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,593
And then we win
the contest.

396
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,263
So, uh,
are you on board?

397
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,031
I don't...

398
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,032
know about...

399
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,534
being on TV.

400
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,735
What if...

401
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,769
I have...

402
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,337
to speak?

403
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,739
All the...

404
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,507
guys in
my old school...

405
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,909
always
made fun of--

406
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,444
Anyone tries bullying you,

407
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,379
and they're gonna
get their abs kicked in.

408
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,448
But, hey, girls
must love the accent.

409
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,949
Am I right?
(LAUGHS)

410
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:05,950
Yeah.

411
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,085
The fact that I'm...

412
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,186
cute as a cloud...

413
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,887
doesn't hurt
either, but--

414
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,522
And that's what's
so great about this, too.

415
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,724
I mean, we get to make
all these amazing dishes,

416
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:17,028
and we don't have to talk
or deal with anybody else.

417
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,931
There's the other one,
Bobby Butler.

418
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,266
We have to go
into class, though.

419
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,770

gonna make you a TV star.

00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,567

459
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,035
and thongs?

460
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,304

461
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,842

And then later,

472
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,367
we're gonna have a little
beach party at the lake,

473
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,002
so meet us here
right after the show,

your thongs.

were supposed to be

getting beat up?

sting for an hour...

be taking notes?

how fortunate I am

503
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,904
to be working
with my two talented

504
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,005
underprivileged
teammates

505
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,307

on the Interne--

plenty of time

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,176
to talk later,
but right now,

508
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,645
let's get the first round
of our contest under way.

509
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,315
Here's how it'll work.
Our distinguished judges

510
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,350
will eliminate
one team each show

511
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,985
until we pick our big winner...
Shh!

512
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,520
on the grand finale night.
Wait.

513

And every team captain

so it's anyone's game.

515
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,793
The winner of "Teen Chef"
will go on

516
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,761
to host their
very own TV show.

517
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,297
To be a TV show host
for the Mealtime Network,

518
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,666

00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:42,293
and our team elimination
for week one.

531
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:44,161
(APPLAUSE)

532
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,197
Thanks for being with us.

533
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,369

of tonight's show,

00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,403

536
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,840
RIP: Congrats.

537
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:59,176
Tune in next week,
when we'll lead off

538
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,078
with each team captain
telling America

539
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,347
how they discovered
their signature dishes.

540
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,282
Until next Friday,
good night.

541
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,085
DIRECTOR: Cut!
That's a wrap.

542
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,254
Hey, how would you
like to take over

543
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,756
that assignment
for me next week?

544
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:14,392
I believe
the competition rules

545
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:18,262
state that there shall be no
delegation of a captain's duties.

546
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,499
I got you covered.

547
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,666
Can't wait.

00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,693
Eye contact.

550
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,462
You need to make eye contact
with your audience.

551
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:54,265
Find a friendly face,
and stare them down.

552
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,800
At least you didn't
tell me Gran's advice

553
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,535
to picture them
all naked.

Didn't--
Didn't you hear me?

593
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,577
I heard you when you said you sprained
your hand and were off the team,

594
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:49,580
but now I just heard your buddies
say you were suspended, so...

595
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:52,349
Well, no, I really wanted
to help you on the contest,

596
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:55,185
and I thought if--if you
knew that I'd been suspended

597
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,221
for harassing you, you might--
might think...

598
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,222
I might think what?

599
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,723
That I wasn't
being real

600
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,225
or else I was
pulling some crap.

pulling crap?

602
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,162
I got that spice thing
you wanted.

603
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:06,363
Saffron.

604
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:07,698
I said saffron,

605
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,767
saffron
from a spice shop.

606
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,570

from a warehouse.

609
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:18,309
Why are you really
doing all this?

610
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,346
I feel horrible
about the pool

611
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:25,015
and assembly
and last year.

612
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,717
I was hoping
that we could work

613
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,786
on the contest
together and then...

614
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:32,323
maybe the school's
anti-bullying project?

615
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,740
Hey, Sarah.

616
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,075

What are you doing here?

00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:53,277
Respectfully whispering.

618
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,280
It's just some research
for a blog I'm writing.

619
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,615
In the cooking area?

620
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,850
It's a hot topic
all over town.

621
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:04,888
Where are all
your adoring fans?

622
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,925
I, uh--I--

623
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:10,761
You know,
couldn't...

624
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:12,463
find the one
I was looking for,

625
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:16,233
so, uh, I came here,
and it worked.

626
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,502
She found me.

627
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,170
Well, she doesn't have time

628
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,840
to bask in the glow
of your spotlight.

629
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,478
Too busy, uh, reporting
on pop culture, huh?

630
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,680
Well, it doesn't come
with a TV show,

631
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,115
but someone
should hold a mirror

632
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,383
to the narcissism
of society.

633
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,288
You know, feeding people
isn't such a selfish thing.

634
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,091
And feeding your ego publicly
isn't such a selfless one.

00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,995

00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,030
Um...

638
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:48,132
Are you okay?

639
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:50,367
Um, oh, yeah, yeah.

640
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,769
You know--

641
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:53,337
You know, but people--
people do things

642
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,672
for all kind
of reasons, right?

643
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:55,806
You know,
reasons other people

644
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:56,974
may not even
know about, so...

645
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,142
Right.

646
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,110
And even if I was
doing this for me,

647
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,378
I don't get
much props

648
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,013
from others around
here anyway, so...

without "I"
or "me" in them?

652
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,788
Uh, would that make you

653
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,424
want to spend more
than 30 seconds with me?

654
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,228
(LAUGHS)
There you go again.

655
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,230
No. I--
Nah, I was just--

656
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,399
I was just wondering
if you want to--

657
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:23,400

You spent what
on saffron?

661
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,749
Do you want him
to think I'm sincere?

662
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:41,185
That's a whole day,
both jobs.

663
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:43,587
I'd better get
my money's worth.

664
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,422
This Friday night's
the one...

665
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,091
when you
blow the contest.

666
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:49,193
He must totally
trust you by now.

667
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:50,928
I wouldn't say totally.

668
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,497
Besides, the coach
just left me a message.

669
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,199
He wants to see me
in the morning.

670
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:56,834
This might
already be over.

671
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:58,435
Do you have a world map

672
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,771
that shows the picture
of you in the center?

673
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,272
You made a commitment,

674
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,274
so make sure Dolen
trusts you by Friday.

675
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:08,712
Again, how am I supposed to pull
this off without getting caught?

676
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,581
Well, what do you guys
have planned

677
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,949
for Friday night's
competition?

678
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:14,017
Each team is doing
a different culture's food,

679
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,886
and Tommy hasn't
picked out our culture yet.

680
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,521
Well, the minute
he does, let me know,

681
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:19,356
and I'll tell you
how to screw it up.

682
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,558
I'm pretty sure I can
figure that out on my own.

683
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,860
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, because you've

684
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,461
done so well thinking
for yourself so far.

685
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,430
Let me do the thinking
for the both of us,

686
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,132
all right,
boy brainless?

687
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,611
COACH: Two top teams?

688
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,946
U of Texas and UC.
Which one?

689
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,948
Well, you're gonna
have to guess, boy.

690
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,383
Oh, my God. When?

691
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,051
Yeah, today.
But, I--

692
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:51,755
And then I had to tell 'em
that you were suspended,

693
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:53,824
and he decided
to pass

694
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:57,027
on a potential
disciplinary risk.

695
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,464
You're batting
.500, Matt.

696
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:03,167
You better figure out
a way to get reinstated.

697
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,669

00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,271

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,157
Ladies, would you please
wait for me outside?

880
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,493
You can't hear what I have
to say to these three.

881
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,630
(ENTRY BELL RINGS)

882
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:56,266
Dudes,
you make this so easy.

883
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,876
If I'm going to...

884
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,945
hang out with you...

885
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,114
I'm definitely...

886
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:13,450
gonna need
more stamina.

887
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,557
Okay, Italian.

888
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,325
This is what
you're gonna do.

889
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:23,993
Actually, Tommy
changed things up.

890
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:27,230
Cooking an Italian meal
on Friday's show could be...

891
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,565
misinterpreted.

892
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,967
Then what's the new--
You know, no, no.

893
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,836
I gotta go,
and I gotta get changed.

894
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:33,837
No! Tell me!

895
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:34,871
A luau.

896
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,341
What happened
to your face?

897
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,343
Did you get
in a fight?

898
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,011
I hope
he looks worse.

899
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,646
Talks like a girl now.

900
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,850
TOMMY: My face?

901
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:49,886
Nothing, okay?

902
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,688
Actually, um,

903
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,859
I took on 50 guys at school that
wanted to ask you out, so...

904
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,727
Uh-huh.

905
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,096
Ms. Sykes said that
you and Matt Prylek

906
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,031
are working together
on the school's

907
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,600
anti-bullying
campaign?

908
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,002
(LAUGHS) You two
make a curious team.

909
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,238
Yeah, tell me about it.

910
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,774
I hear you two have
quite a history.

911
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,343
But it could make
an interesting article.

912
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:17,013
How about I interview you two
together for the school blog?

913
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:21,584
How about you do it
at my place tomorrow night?

914
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,921
Me and Gran
are having Matt over.

915
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,924
How about I do it next
Monday between classes?

916
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,293
I don't get a good
vibe from your buddy,

917
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:33,196
and I would prefer to keep
my time with him short.

918
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:36,466
We can always do
my part of the interview

919
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:40,170
over lunch, say, Friday?

920
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,806
I think
we'd be distracted

921
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,008
when you get mobbed
by your groupies.

938
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:11,728
I was ever
in the kitchen cooking

939
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,129
were to help my mom.

940
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:15,131
She taught me
how to make this.

941
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,536
In Philly, I was
overweight big time,

942
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:21,971
so she got me
into swimming,

943
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,507
always said
I'd make the Olympics.

944
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:26,242
I've never
forgotten that,

945
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:29,145
never let anything
hold me back.

946
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:32,048
That's what you gotta do
with this contest, T.

947
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:36,185
Just gotta keep
pushing forward...

948
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,654
no matter what.

949
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,526
Looks great.

950
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:44,561
DENNIS: Thanks, Rip!

951
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:45,995
We thought
we'd highlight

952
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:48,164
the simple British cuisine
of an earlier age.

953
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,333
I feel so blessed
to wear these rags

954
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:53,503
a-and dress like my
impoverished teammates.

955
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:55,305
There are no words.
(LAUGHS)

956
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,076
(APPLAUSE)

957
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,345
RIP: Thank you,
Team Dennis!

958
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,084
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to now

959
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,719
enter the Chunnel
with me as we leave

960
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,387
the United Kingdom...
Whoa!

961
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,924
and we head to France with
our favorite mademoiselles.

962
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,727
(APPLAUSE)

963
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,028
<i>Ou est le mademoiselles?</i>

964
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,863
My foot.
I think it's broken.

965
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:21,864
Mademoiselles?

966
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:23,666
We can help you up.

967
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,503
Mademoiselles?

968
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,573
What are you doing?

969
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:32,709
Your cue to come out was when
Team Dennis left the stage.

970
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:33,676
You're late. Let's go.

971
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,081
I'm so sorry!
Thank you!

972
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,249
According to contest rules,
if you're ever late

973
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,818
for a second entrance,
you're out!

974
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,954
Will, that's terrible!

975
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:48,558
What are you giving them the
heads-up for, you idiot?

976
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,994
Get me a latte. Go.

977
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:57,100
Kyle, it's Matt.
Where are you?

978
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:58,968
Thanks, Bartosh cousins.

979
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,170
And next up for tonight,
Team Tommy.

980
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,305
(APPLAUSE)

981
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,111
ANNOUNCER:
Don't touch that remote.

982
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:10,146
Team Tommy
will be right back.

983
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,581
Matt's gonna
double over in pain.

984
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,683
The pig'll go flying,
hit the ground.

985
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:14,984
Contest over.

986
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,753
Matty's not busted.

987
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,921
Chef Girl-ar-dee
finished.

988
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:21,224
Pizza joint leveled.

989
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:33,002
And we're back
in 3, 2, 1.

990
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,004

992
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:45,948
(APPLAUSE)

993
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,653
RIP: Whew! Somebody sure
turned up the heat

994
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,822
at the Mealtime Network
kitchen with that one!

995
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:53,990
Something funny?

996
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:56,559
Uh, need
to hit the head.

997
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:59,962
I'll--I'll meet you guys
in the parking lot?

998
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:01,798
RIP: We'll be right back
with the conclusion

999
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,033
of this week's
"Teen Chef" episode

1000
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,835
right after
this commercial break.

1001
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:08,304
Stay right where you are.

1002
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,376
And Team Tommy wins
again, thanks to you.

1003
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,078
It was instinct.

1004
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,380
For a second, I thought
it was all over,

1005
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,316
but you surprised me.
Nice save.

1006
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,886
Congratulations.
Dinner's on me tonight.

1007
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,689
Can I invite my teammates
to come too?

1008
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:28,157
Sure.

1009
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,226
You want to catch those
guys before they leave?

1010
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,594
Sure.

1011
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,800
(COUGHS)

1012
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,441
Don't ever do anything
like that again.

1013
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:46,943
Walk home.

1014
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,692
ABBY: I was so nervous
for a second.

1015
00:46:02,694 --> 00:46:03,693
TOMMY: So was I.

1016
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:05,294
Oh, me, too.

1017
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:07,964
Oh, hey, um, Philip and
Bobby already left,

1018
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,899
but Tommy and his grandmother
would love to join us.

1019
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:11,234
W-We'll have to take
a rain check.

1020
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:14,570
Matty and Joe decided
to go for burgers.

1021
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:17,740
It's amazing how much Matt's
changed in such a short time.

1022
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,976
Well, I've been
trying to coach him.

1023
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:22,478
It's not easy raising
a teenager all alone.

1024
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,880
But you know that.

1025
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:28,084
By the way,
love your pizza.

1026
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:29,285
Best in town.

1027
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,287
(CRYING)

1028

(TELEPHONE LINE RINGS)

1029
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,449
Hey.
JOE: Hey.

1030
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,485
Feels like I'm going behind his
back talking to you like this.

1031
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,320
No!
He needs perspective!

1032
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,189
This morning,
I heard him tell Dolen

1033
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:08,825
he wanted them to take a
drive to Hillview later.

1034
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:10,259
What?
Can you believe it?

1035
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:11,661
He's been acting
so weird lately.

1036
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,930
Call him. Tell him
you want to work out.

1037
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,131
Stall him
until I get there.

1038
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,632
Then while
I distract him,

1039
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,835
I need you to plant a
little device in his bag.

1040
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:20,436
No, man, that's so---

1041
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,839
Hey, do you want things to
get back to normal or not?

1042
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:24,473
(HANGS UP)

1043
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:25,608
Hey, Matty.

1044
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,051
Look, I know you're--

1045
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:37,186
Joey.

1046
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,322
Hey, will you
give us a sec?

1047
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:41,324
I want
to talk to Matty.

1048
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:43,860
Well, you better make it quick,
'cause I'm meeting up with Tommy

1049
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,695
after my workout,
and I need your car.

1050
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,430
I'll wait in there.

1051
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,036
Well, what do you want?

1052
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,572
KYLE: Dad always said
kill each other in fun,

1053
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:57,974
but don't raise
your hands

1054
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:00,176
to your brothers
even once in anger.

1055
00:48:00,178 --> 00:48:03,579
I screwed up.
I'll do better

1056
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:06,249
at keeping things under
control from now on.

1057
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,818
We moved up here

1058
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,219
after the fire
in Philly.

1059
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,756
Some cheap
electrical wiring.

1060
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,061
Kyle had taken me
camping that weekend.

1061
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,397
People assume that we
lost our parents

1062
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,333
and our little brother
Eddie in the fire,

1063
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:27,503
but Mom made it out.

1064
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,706
She couldn't
handle it, though,

1065
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:33,309
so we moved her
up here.

1066
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,113
And then Kyle moved us

1067
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:39,782
to Saint Raymond
so we could be nearby.

1068
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:44,186
I come up to see her
whenever I can.

1069
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:48,891
TOMMY: Can I, uh--

1070
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:53,029
I mean, would you like me
to come in with you?

1071
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:56,198
No, but next time,
though.

1072
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,940
Thanks.

1073
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,877
Thanks.

1074
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:13,382
(GIGGLES)

1075
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:14,650
Looks hot.

1076
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,953
Oh, thanks.

1077
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,955
(GIGGLES)

1078
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,990
You already
apologized for it.

1079
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:24,327
I don't want there to be
any weirdness between us.

1080
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:27,330
Bro, can you imagine living
like this every day?

1081
00:49:27,332 --> 00:49:29,665
We can once
I close this deal.

1082
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,335
Kyle, I don't want
to do this anymore.

1083
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:33,936
You're still mad at me?

1084
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:36,272
No. Tommy and I
are friends now.

1085
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:37,974
And these past few weeks

1086
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:40,242
not pushing
anybody around,

1087
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:42,244
I like it.

1088
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:44,280
Plus the whole school
bullying campaign?

1089
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,449
You can still be
Mr. Anti-bullying guy,

1090
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:49,118
and you can still be friends
with Dolen if you want.

1091
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,587
He'll never know you were
the one that screwed him--

1092
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:52,688
No.

1093
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,357
You want college,
swimming career,

1094
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,258
incredible future?
Got it.

1095
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,593
I would
have liked that, too,

1096
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:59,195
but right
after high school,

1097
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,530
I had some instant
grown-up responsibilities.

1098
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,699
I just can't make
the connection.

1099
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,702
I mean, Matt was
being weird up there

1100
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:08,704
because he wasn't
feeling well.

1101
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,806
But he kept glancing
up at his brother

1102
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:12,942
the whole time
he was on the stage.

1103
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:14,944
'Cause he was sick,
you know,

1104
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:17,680
the same way you'd look for your
parents or I'd look for Gran.

1105
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,882
I mean, there's really
no big mystery or drama.

1106
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:22,651
Then tell me
how Tommy losing helps.

1107
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,954
I'm not sure I can
trust you with that.

1108
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:27,189
How am I supposed
to decide if I don't know?

1109
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,524
There's no decision
to make!

1110
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,160
Matty, you and I have
been on the same team

1111
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,828
since the day
you were born.

1112
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,831
How do I know I'm
not gonna get caught?

1113
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,166
If that happened--

1114
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,835
If I get this gig,
college won't matter.

1115
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:40,803
We'll be set.

1116
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:45,574
Yo, Kyle.

1117
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,579
It was really weird,
almost like--

1118
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:52,848
Do I detect
concern for me--

1119
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,851
um, someone
at this table?

1120
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:58,521
I tried.

1121
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:01,090
We're gonna do it
the other way.

1122
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,659
What's the big rush?

1123
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:05,261
You'd better
get in there.

1124
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:06,328
(LAUGHTER)
Hey, come on.

1125
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,930
Play it again!
Play it. Do it.

1126
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,066
Let's hear it! Come on!
Play it again, dude.

1127
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,501
MATT: ...couldn't handle it,
though, so...

1128
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:15,004
(LAUGHTER)
we moved her up here,

1129
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:18,340
and Kyle moved us to Saint
Raymond so we could be nearby.

1130
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,911
I come up to see her
whenever I can.

1131
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,512
This lady's nuts.

1132
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:25,081
Fine. Don't believe me,

1133
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,416
but I'm telling you,
steer clear.

1134
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,185
He just
found out he lost

1135
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,519
his dream college
opportunity because

1136
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:32,555
of his suspension,
and he blames you.

1137
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:35,024
Matt and I are friends.
You don't get it.

1138
00:51:35,026 --> 00:51:37,059
Your whole friendship
has been a joke.

1139
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:39,395
He laughs at you
behind your back.

1140
00:51:39,397 --> 00:51:41,197
The joke's over.

1141
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,498
Stay away, man.

1142
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,608
Hey.

1143
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,378
I was--was running late.

1144
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,616
Sprinted all the way here,
and I, uh--

1145
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:01,951
I tripped.

1146
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,388
Okay.

1147
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,368
Are you all right?

1148
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,304
Will be
in two minutes.

1149
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,306
Matt, you do
anything to him now,

1150
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:25,841
and you're gonna
get expelled.

1151
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:27,443
Look,
keep a low profile.

1152
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:28,844
Take care of him
Friday night

1153
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,646
in the contest
like you were planning to.

1154
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,081
But he's--
Look, next week,

1155
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,682
we'll go out.
We'll get some ski masks

1156
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:36,152
and teach him a lesson
he'll never forget.

1157
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,795
Hey, are we still on to
meet outside the library?

1158
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:47,997
Actually, I'm sorry.

1159
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,132
Now's just not the time,
all right?

1160
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:52,434
Oh, look. There's
your best friend now.

1161
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,838
I-I'm sorry.

1162
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,176
KYLE: Thanks.

1163
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:02,511
Using my place
would have been awkward.

1164
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,380
No, nobody will.

1165
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:07,550
Not even if they
knew who owned it.

1166
00:53:07,552 --> 00:53:09,518
No. No,

1167
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,687
he'll be much
more cooperative now.

1168
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,889
Besides,
I'm running another plan

1169
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:16,859
on a parallel track
just in case.

1170
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,195
Yeah, gotta go. Later.

1171
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,800
Here it is. There are
three teams left.

1172
00:53:24,802 --> 00:53:27,870
We'll help you get rid
of those girls tomorrow,

1173
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,973
and you be ready to do a
little something for us

1174
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:32,308
if we should need it.

1175
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,978
Like what?

1176
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,415
Like something that'll guarantee
you win this contest.

1177
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:41,584
Sweet. But they have
all these strict rules,

1178
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:43,686
and if I get caught
shafting anyone, I'll be--

some time with him.

in the morning.

things going tonight.

out there, so...

though.

over at this other guy.

was, so I Googled him.

I don't know what's
going on with Matt either,

has to do with, um,

01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:41,643
You seem totally okay
with all this.

1399
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:43,011
You're my brother.

1400
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:45,346
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

1401
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,982
And the more I think
about how he set me up,

1402
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:49,817
I can't wait
to burn him.

1403
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:52,053
And you haven't heard
from Dolen yet?

1404
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:55,890
No. Wasn't
expecting to. Why?

1405
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:58,126
No reason.

1406
01:09:58,128 --> 01:10:00,161
Hey, Matty...

1407
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:02,497
I knew you'd
come through.

1408
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:04,532
Things are gonna be
getting a lot better.

1409
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:07,302
Stuff I'll tell you about
later with me and Abby.

1410
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:08,803
Let's just
get through tonight.

1411
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:09,904
Get through?

1412
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:12,407
All the good stuff
starts tonight.

1413
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:14,108
See you there.

1414
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,980
Ready to go through
with our plan?

1415
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:27,689
(LINE RINGS)

1416
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:30,191
I should be the one to refrigerate
the dough at the studio,

1417
01:10:30,193 --> 01:10:31,759
just in case Kyle's
gone totally overboard

1418
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:35,330
and has video surveillance
or something like that.

1419
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:37,332
With all this
who's bluffing who

1420
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:38,933
between you
and your brother,

1421
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:41,135
how do I know you're
not just bluffing me?

1422
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,773
I guess you just
gotta trust me.

1423
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,779
Thanks, Gran.

1424
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,018
Moonlight's pretty bright
for daytime.

1425
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,090
And...

1426
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:04,158
we have a restaurant
to save.

1427
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:09,464
Joey, it's Kyle.
Listen,

1428
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:12,267
as much as I want to trust
Matty, I just don't.

1429
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:14,068
He's supposed to put
the liquid laxative

1430
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,237
into Team Tommy's pizzelle
dough before the show,

1431
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,373
but he was
way too agreeable.

1432
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:20,608
I think he's gonna
double-cross me again,

1433
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,210
so those two little kids

1434
01:11:22,212 --> 01:11:24,145
from Team Doofus are
gonna take care of it.

1435
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:27,815
And now I've got something I
need you to handle. Call me.

1436
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:30,151
Look, just give me
five minutes, all right?

1437
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:32,987
After 30 seconds of nonstop
apologizing and groveling,

1438
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:36,057
I have to tell you
the most incredible story

1439
01:11:36,059 --> 01:11:38,793
that you have to post on your
blog after tonight's show.

1440
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,063
Okay, but only if you tell
me the story in 30 seconds

1441
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:44,766
and spend the rest of the time
apologizing and groveling.

1442
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:46,467
(LAUGHS)

1443
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:49,971
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

The "Teen Chef"
final showdown

01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:54,342
will begin momentarily.

1446
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:56,978
It turns out I need a new
prescription anyway.

1447
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,547
You guys saved me
some serious eyestrain.

1448
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,021
All right, let's go.

1449
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:09,090
Make you guys look poor,

1450
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:10,958
"Oliver Twist" effect.

1451
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,594
Awesome. Let's go.

1452
01:12:13,596 --> 01:12:15,163
You kidding me?

1453
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:16,464
Come on.

1454
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:19,767
231, 232,

1455
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:23,071
233, 234.

1456
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,876
Buddy, uh, the girls
aren't here anymore.

1457
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:31,279
I just...

1458
01:12:31,281 --> 01:12:33,381
love the way
I'm starting to look.

1459
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:47,795

01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:50,331

01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:00,908
who will score and evaluate
each meal progressively

1466
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:03,244
until we're down to dessert
and the selection

1467
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:05,246

Stop!
(AUDIENCE GASPING)

1498
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:34,602
That dough's
no good!

1499
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:35,670
Let's go
to a commercial break.

1500
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:37,238
We'll be right back.

1501
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,241
He told me he messed with
his dough to sabotage him.

1502
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:43,444
My producer's telling me we won't
be going to commercial break.

1503
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:44,645
Sweeps week.

1504
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,681
Nice try, pal,

1505
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:48,349
but this dough
is fine.

1506
01:14:48,351 --> 01:14:49,484
JOE: No, I mean it.

1507
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:50,785
He put enough
liquid laxatives

1508
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:52,153
in there
to suck out

1509
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:53,254
the judges'
small intestines.

1510
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:55,323

1511
01:14:55,325 --> 01:14:56,424
WILL: It's true.

1512

Otto and I saw him

1513
01:14:57,627 --> 01:14:59,026
put something
in the dough today.

1514
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:01,796
No, he didn't,
all right? It's fine.

1515
01:15:01,798 --> 01:15:03,297
I trust Matt completely.

1516
01:15:03,299 --> 01:15:04,265
Thank you.

1517
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,734
Me, too!

1518
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,670
He's my brother!

1519
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,939
He'd never do
anything like that!

1520
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:13,975
If there's any chance
that anyone--

1521
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:15,042
Test it!

1522
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:19,180
I want that dough
tested now.

1523
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:21,015
I vouch for
Matty's integrity.

1524
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:33,961
We'd like to thank the producers
of "Cooking with Zayde"

1525
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:36,697
for allowing us to continue
with our extended live show.

1526
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,199
They'll return next week.

1527
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,201
Our news isn't good.

1528
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:43,337
It appears that
Team Tommy's pizzelle dough

1529
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:44,839
was in fact tainted.
(AUDIENCE GASPS)

1530
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:45,973
And so now--

1531
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:48,075
"Any interference
with ingredients

01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:50,077

said interfering."

1534
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:56,150
Thank you. But the rules
go on to say

1535
01:15:56,152 --> 01:15:58,352
that, if the team captain
decides to dismiss

1536
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:00,154
the offending individual
from the team,

1537
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:03,024
they can go on to redo
the round in question.

1538
01:16:03,026 --> 01:16:05,026
Tommy, you have
a decision to make.

1539
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:08,062
You and Dennis can go head to
head in another dessert round,

1540
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,997
but only if you fire Matt
from your team.

going into this last round,

1547
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:26,247
Team Tommy
was in the lead.

You may want
to take a minute.

Win or lose,
we're a team.

Mealtime Network contest

1551

my own show now.

We here

(LAUGHS)

1571
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,990
Dude!

1572
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,194
It's your speech.

1573
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:50,498
You two are gonna resign
from the team today.

1574
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,299
I'll keep you to help
behind the scenes,

1575
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:54,101
but, uh,

1576
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:56,470
in the fan email that I've
gotten since last night,

1577
01:17:56,472 --> 01:17:59,106
it doesn't seem
like a good idea to...

1578
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:02,743
split our audience's
focus among all of us.

1579
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:05,279
Ooh!

1580
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:06,781
TOMMY: Even though
I'm bummed about losing

1581
01:18:06,783 --> 01:18:08,883
my dream of saving
the pizza parlor,

1582
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:11,018
I realize that, if this had
all happened a month ago,

1583
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,820
I would have bailed
on coming here today.

1584
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:15,456
I would have just curled up and
disappeared under the radar,

1585
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:16,891
but I'm not. I'm here now

1586
01:18:16,893 --> 01:18:18,626
with my teammates,
and no one can break us.

1587
01:18:18,628 --> 01:18:20,294
And what I'm hearing
from this kid,

1588
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:21,629
it seems like we're
not the only ones

1589
01:18:21,631 --> 01:18:23,964
who have been
pushed too far.

1590
01:18:23,966 --> 01:18:25,633
Sounds like this one's
pushing back.

1591
01:18:25,635 --> 01:18:27,668
ANNOUNCER: "Teen Chef"
continues live.

1592
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:30,204
Never mind that we're not
even really urban poor kids.

1593
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:35,009
Our mom's the live-in help
for his family.

1594
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:38,112
Well, was, I guess,
after today.

1595
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:43,984
But our team

1596
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:46,754
is not the rightful
winner of this contest,

1597
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:48,989
and aside from me,

1598
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:52,493
there are three guys who
made Team Tommy lose--

1599
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:54,495
him...
(GASPING)

1600
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:56,897
BOY: What?

1601
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,899
him...

1602
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,404
and especially him.

1603
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:07,942
(CHUCKLING)

1604
01:19:07,944 --> 01:19:10,277
Here's how it
all went down.

1605
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:12,146
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1606
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,238
And that's it.

1607
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:41,742
I'm really, really sorry
for my part in this,

1608
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:44,979
but I want you
to know that my brother

1609
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:46,881
didn't have anything
to do with it.

1610
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,086
My brother says,

1611
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:55,656
"Yes, I did..."

1612
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,960
"and we're a team, too."

1613
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,061
(APPLAUSE)

1614
01:20:01,063 --> 01:20:03,197

1615
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,100
Ladies and gentlemen,

1616
01:20:06,102 --> 01:20:08,068
the real winners
of the Mealtime contest,

1617
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,069
Team Tommy!

1618
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:11,705
(CHEERING)

1619
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,610
Congratulations,
Matt and Tommy.

1620
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:18,612
What are you gonna do
with your prize money?

1621
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:22,449
I--I hear there's this great
old pizza restaurant for sale.

1622
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:24,018
(LAUGHS)
Awesome.

1623
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,253
Hey, maybe you can tape your
new TV show from there.

1624
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:28,989
Yeah!
Sounds good to me.

1625
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:32,126
(CHEERING)

1626
01:20:32,128 --> 01:20:34,461
Ladies and gentlemen,
more with Team Tommy

1627
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:37,131
right after
this short break.

1628
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:38,799
NED: Mm.

1629
01:20:38,801 --> 01:20:40,801
As you
may have guessed,

1630
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:41,936
the demolition's off.

1631
01:20:41,938 --> 01:20:45,306
And as far
as any future work goes,

1632
01:20:45,308 --> 01:20:48,409
why don't you move
to Antarctica?

1633
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,318
Let's hear
from our winners.

1634
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,887
Um, thank you,
everyone.

1635
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:01,355
Um, our...

1636

1640
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,897
Relax, bro.
It'll only sting, like, a week.

1641
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:11,332
Or six!

1642
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:13,300
Ah, ah, ah, hey.

When I'm ready,
I'll walk home.
