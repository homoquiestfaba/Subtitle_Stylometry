1
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,923
Susan!

2
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,429
Victoria!

3
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,894
Hi!

4
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,940
Good morning!

5
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:19,324
Good morning!

6
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,451
Come on.

7
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,287
Stand, Susan.

8
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,845
Stand, Susan.

9
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,811
Stand.

10
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,652
Step, it's right here.

11
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,820
Step.

12
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,007
Okay.

13
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:23,722
I'll give you eh, three,
four minutes in there.

14
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,632
Good job, my Susan!

15
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,803
Okay. And slowly...

16
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,889
no,no,lhaven%
let you go.

17
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,057
See, I'm right here.

18
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,935
I'm right here.

19
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,854
Right here.

20
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:15,732
Okay,
Susan miracle...

21
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:20,571
Hey, hey, okay.

22
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,408
Here we are.

23
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,761
Fred, come and eat.

24
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,723
Eat, eat, eat.

25
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:31,725
Eats.

26
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,478
Eats.

27
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,903
Okay.

28
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,502
Mr. Avidma.

29
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,725
Good morning, Susan!

30
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,191
Whoop dee doo!

31
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,569
Yes.

32
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,079
Fred, sit.

33
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,752
Queen Victoria.

34
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,755
Yeah man.

35
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,862
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

36
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,286
Did you sleep well?

37
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,804
Did you dream?

38
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:20,143
Oh, yes.

39
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,564
Yes, yes.

40
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,107
What did you dream?

41
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,779
That I was
going upstairs.

42
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,701
Very good!

43
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,635
Let me hear you
say the line,

44
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,220
"but wait there's more."

45
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,930
"But wait there's more."

46
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,724
Far too realistic.
Far too genuine.

47
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,808
You've got to
make it totally phony.

48
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,726
TW again.

49
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,936
"But wait, there's more!"

50
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:08,650
What do I do when Fred starts
talking about his dead cat?

51
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,111
Well, you... you play
it by ear that's all.

52
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,779
Play it by ear.

53
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,742
You remind him very nicely
that it's dead, or not.

54
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:19,870
I mean, as soon as
it's alive it's just...

55
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,623
it's just going to
forget it's dead again.

56
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,041
How much Nova
did you get?

57
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,877
Pickles and lox killed
more Jews than Hitler,

58
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,712
we'll be fine.

59
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,047
Can I listen to
music or something?

60
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,382
Sure, 10 minutes.

61
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,051
Did you hear me
say 10 minutes?

62
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,761
Yeah, sure, whatever.

63
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,347
When he's up there by
himself we have no idea

64
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,807
what medication
he's taking, how much.

65
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,810
I'm sure he's been
taking her medication.

66
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,313
I mean, Victoria is
just a nurse's aide.

67
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,731
He's the one
who's responsible

68
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,233
for physically
giving her medicine

69
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,776
and then he
has to take his.

70
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,653
I agree, it's
totally nuts.

71
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:55,989
I forgot the
cream cheese.

72
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,407
Oh, don't even
worry about it.

73
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,660
I'm sure I'm going to have
to make a supermarket run.

74
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,954
I mean, he tries to go
to the store himself,

75
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,288
he forgets what he's
supposed to pick up.

76
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,165
It's insane that he's
even driving, if you ask me.

77
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,875
I know.

78
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,168
Listen, did you
get the three everythings?

79
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,419
Yes.

80
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,341
You know, he hasn't
even paid his taxes yet?

81
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,176
You're kidding me!

82
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,427
That's unbelievable!

83
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,720
This has got to stop.

84
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,138
This has got to
stop on this trip.

85
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,139
That's the end.

86
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,243
Lila, come on!

87
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,169
Hi dad!

88
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,795
Robert, hi!

89
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,299
- Captain!
- Grandpa!

90
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,050
- How are you?
- I'm good!

91
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,930
Oh, you're so
grown up for your age.

92
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,974
Thanks! Everyone
in my school is.

93
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,976
Hi!

94
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,978
How are you doing, dad?

95
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,480
Oh, I love you!

96
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,399
I'm going to go
see where Susan is.

97
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,484
- Hello!
- Hi!

98
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,236
Hi! Nice to see you too!

99
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,280
Did you bring a
book with you?

100
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,489
Yeah.

101
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,880
Hi mom!

102
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,299
Hi! Oh, it's okay.

103
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,218
It's just me.

104
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,969
It's Carol.

105
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,971
Hi!

106
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,848
You're having
a good rest?

107
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,186
Do you want anything,
something to drink, refreshment?

108
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,437
I'll have water.

109
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,939
Water?
Okay, good!

110
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,482
- Nothing for me, thanks.
- Nothing for you?

111
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,028
Okay.

112
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,533
Do you remember?

113
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,952
You're not sure?

114
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,078
Hmm.

115
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:07,371
You don't know.

116
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,331
Hey, look who's here.

117
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:13,085
Lila came.

118
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,212
You think you
had saltines?

119
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,384
- No.
- No.

120
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,219
Okay, all right!

121
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,804
That's all right.

122
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,556
Look, I'm going to
be right back, okay?

123
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,225
- You rest some more.
- Okay.

124
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,393
I love you!

125
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,276
Hi!

126
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,497
Victoria! Can you
come in here a moment?

127
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,376
Yes, Ms.?

128
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,295
Did my parents
get saltines today?

129
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,380
Yes, I gave them
this morning.

130
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,965
Well, ljust want
to make sure

131
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,509
it's clear that the reason
Susan takes saltines

132
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,927
is to keep her blood
pressure up so...

133
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,345
I... I know...

134
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,847
...you're the
one who told me.

135
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,599
I know, but it seems
like we're almost out.

136
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,184
Umm, okay.

137
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,476
You know, Fred,

138
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,562
sometimes he forgets
to do the shopping.

139
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,355
And I... I refused,
I told them I wouldn't,

140
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,149
I'm not going
to drive that car.

141
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,942
No,no,no,no,
you're totally right.

142
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,944
I'm so sorry.

143
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,070
You know what I think
we're going to do,

144
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,282
and then I'm going to
go shopping right now.

145
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,868
Okay, Captain!

146
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,036
Okay.

147
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,210
I told her not to
use the front door.

148
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,377
She keeps doing that.

149
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:43,509
So... sojust
tell me what happened?

150
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:56,146
So Susan, you know,
she went unconscious again,

151
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,315
so I called the
ambulance and l...

152
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,525
I had to get
in with her

153
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,985
and I waited until
she was admitted.

154
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,153
Sure!

155
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,113
And... and then
when I came home,

156
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:09,159
I saw that your father here
just collapsed on the ground

157
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,577
and he couldn't
get up.

158
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:14,623
You know, I'm sorry I don't
know how long that he was there

159
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,958
and I can't be in both
places at the same time.

160
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,292
No,no,no.

161
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,028
Captain!

162
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,030
I'm in the barn!

163
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,032
Coming!

164
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,126
Hey!

165
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,210
Huh?

166
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,336
Come here, sweetie.

167
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,380
- Hey mom!
- Listen,

168
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,257
I want you to
remember that

169
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,176
Fred doesn't like people going
out the front door, right, huh?

170
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,468
Okay.

171
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,720
What were you
doing in the barn?

172
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,723
Me and Gran Susan
used to have tea there.

173
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,475
I haven't heard you call her
Gran Susan in a long time.

174
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:17,728
What's that?

175
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,438
It's an emerald frog.

176
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,148
It's from when we
used to have tea.

177
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,524
Hey, you know, umm,

178
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,444
I want you to
hold on to this

179
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,529
and you show this
to Gran Susan, okay,

180
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,281
a little later on?

181
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,242
And then when it's done you
give that right back to me

182
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,745
I've got to put it back
where it went, okay?

183
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,038
Right now I'm
going to the store.

184
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,164
You come with me please.

185
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:41,335
Go close the barn,
do it first though.

186
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,600
You know, Fred, I've been
thinking about this time

187
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,102
before Carol
and... was born,

188
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,480
you left grandma here to
take care of me in the house.

189
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,607
And I went away to play
with a friend at his house

190
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,442
or something like
that and I came back

191
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,236
and grandma must have
gone out to go shopping

192
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,487
because there
was nobody here

193
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,530
and the door
was locked

194
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,281
and I couldn't
get in the house.

195
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,367
But grandma had
left me a note.

196
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,451
I found it on the door

197
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,786
and it said,

198
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:20,624
the schlizzle is in
the hunschdizzle.

199
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,626
I didn't know what the
hell it was talking about.

200
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,545
The schlizzle is
in the hunschdizzle.

201
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:28,215
And then I realized
hunschdizzle meant dog dish.

202
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,424
So I looked down
in the dog dish

203
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,135
and there was the key.

204
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,679
So I figured it out.

205
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,266
The schlizzle is in the
hunschdizzle is the key

206
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:41,061
is in the dog dish.

207
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,271
Dad?

208
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:50,529
So I understand you
put in a new oil tank.

209
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,324
It's in the basement.

210
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,244
The old one was outside.

211
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,495
I'm amazed they were able to
get the thing down the stairs.

212
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,581
What did it cost you?

213
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,665
Too much.

214
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,252
You have to
do it, right?

215
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,753
By the way, I noticed
while we were driving up

216
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,340
looks like it can really
use some new paint.

217
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:16,597
I got a guy who's
cheaper than the Mexicans

218
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,848
and he cuts the lawn.

219
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,100
Wow, cheaper
than the Mexicans.

220
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,355
I'm not being racist,
I'm being realistic.

221
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,358
So how's the
movie business?

222
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:31,653
That's, uh,
not so realistic.

223
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,447
It's very different than
I thought it was going to be.

224
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,199
I mean, it's all about
the small screen now,

225
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,284
you know, downloads and
all that kind of thing.

226
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:40,787
Well, how did the movie
about the clown do?

227
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,499
Not so well.
People didn't find it funny.

228
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,667
I thought that
was the point.

229
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,877
You're right,
that was the point,

230
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,712
but when people download
something about a clown,

231
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:49,713
they have a
certain expectation

232
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,757
it's going to
be hilarious.

233
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,718
It was during
prohibition

234
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:58,555
and my father was making
wine in the cellar.

235
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,642
So a cop
was walking by

236
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:06,355
and he saw this large
amount of grapes.

237
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,148
Walked to my
father and said,

238
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:12,236
hey, Bub, what are
all those grapes for?

239
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:15,239
My father pointed to me
and my brother and he said,

240
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:17,324
my kids love them.

241
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,909
And he believed it.

242
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,744
Because it was true.

243
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,580
I mean, you still do
love the grapes, right?

244
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,583
But I guess it was also
a lie at the same time.

245
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,669
So what?

246
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,255
That's show business.

247
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:35,926
Bob, sometimes you remind
me of Yogi Berra, you know.

248
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,637
Someone once asked him
what time it was and he said,

249
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:39,847
you mean now?

250
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,600
You know, I saw your
old tennis playing buddy

251
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,436
Steven the other day.

252
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,855
Still plays very well.

253
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,857
Fuck him.

254
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,567
Dad, don't you think
it would be better

255
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,653
if you got some kind
of regular exercise?

256
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,197
I mean, you know,
therapeutic exercise?

257
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:01,660
All that stuff would be...
would be so easy.

258
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,496
Oh, is it time
for our vodka?

259
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,914
Vodka!

260
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,791
Not yet.

261
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,918
Put her on the couch.

262
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,253
Okay.

263
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,591
Okay, Susan.

264
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,473
She can stand.

265
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,519
Hold me.

266
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,979
Okay.

267
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,439
Stand Susan.

268
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,275
Susan, stand.

269
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,819
Okay.

270
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,778
Let her walk.

271
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,322
Okay.

272
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,489
- One step.
- She can walk.

273
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,618
No Fred, she cannot.

274
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:43,660
I got her.
I got her.

275
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,536
- Put her on the couch.
- Okay.

276
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:45,871
I got you mom.

277
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:49,750
Slow.

278
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,844
Okay, okay, great.

279
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,271
You look good mom.

280
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,859
Oh yes.

281
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,862
Yeah.

282
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,781
I'm alive.

283
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,283
Well, that's...
that's good!

284
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,329
Listen, umm,

285
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,706
do you remember when you
went to Goucher College,

286
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,544
remember how you used to
live in a dorm there?

287
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:36,713
Well, that's what it's
going to be like again.

288
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,423
You're going to be
living in a situation

289
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,050
very much
like a dorm.

290
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,343
I mean, back
in those days

291
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,386
when you guys
got married,

292
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,054
you didn't get a
chance to finish,

293
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,556
but now you're going
to have an opportunity

294
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,474
to really finish things.

295
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,892
It's going to be great.

296
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,815
Sounds good!

297
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,692
It is.
It really is good.

298
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,443
I mean, you'll
be close to me.

299
00:21:58,443 --> 00:21:59,570
You'll be
close to Carol.

300
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,696
It's going to
be really good.

301
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:01,989
You'll see.

302
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,657
How is Aris?

303
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,658
Oh, Aris is
doing good!

304
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,034
Both boys are great.

305
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,411
Jess had some
sort of a bug,

306
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,538
but she's more
or less over it.

307
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,957
Okay.

308
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,590
Come on,

309
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:23,844
drink.

310
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,095
Yes.

311
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,725
I want to thank you.

312
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,438
Drink, drink, drink.

313
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,610
UP, UP, up you go.

314
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,612
Drink.

315
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:43,113
Come on.

316
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:47,367
A little bit of
juice, little bit.

317
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,415
Drink, drink.

318
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,125
Swallow.

319
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,461
My dear, swallow.

320
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,562
Hey, what do you think
about Susan living near us?

321
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,605
I like that.

322
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,106
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

323
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,775
But Fred,
he's going to...

324
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,902
he's going to stay
where he is for now.

325
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,863
Why isn't he going
to move with Susan?

326
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,657
Well, ljust think he
wants to stay out here

327
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:29,910
I mean, he's lived here a
really long time and l...

328
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,455
I just don't think
he's ready to leave yet.

329
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,457
You know, eventually he's
going to miss Susan a lot

330
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,084
so he'll probably
move down to the city

331
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,461
and he can even live in
the same building as her.

332
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,796
That's pretty
cool, right?

333
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:44,091
Yeah, yeah, I think it's
going to work out really well.

334
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:50,764
Dad, this is the best
possible situation.

335
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,475
Mom is going to be able
to get the care she needs.

336
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,852
You can be with her
two floors below.

337
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:57,020
You can go to the office
every single day if you want.

338
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,106
And listen, if you're
not happy, you can leave.

339
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,858
I'm not going to make you stay
there if you don't like it.

340
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:02,776
I'm too old.

341
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,487
Could you get me
another vodka please?

342
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,697
Bottled or tap?

343
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,866
Tap, it's all we got.

344
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:27,134
Hi sweetie!

345
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:30,888
The Captain is here
with her mom and Robert.

346
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:36,727
Oh, she's fine.

347
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:39,980
Oh, yes, she's fine.

348
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,024
Hold on.

349
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:43,025
I'll give her to you.

350
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,491
Here, take the phone.

351
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,620
Hold the phone, Susan.

352
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:58,916
Susan, hold the phone.

353
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,751
Hold the phone!

354
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,586
- Fred!
- Calm down, dad!

355
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,129
Give me that!

356
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:05,923
Sit down.

357
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:07,716
I said sit down.

358
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:13,138
Don't treat
someone that way.

359
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,566
Hold on.

360
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,783
Hideaﬂ

361
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:38,664
Oh, I don't... umm,

362
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,805
me too.

363
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:07,067
You put it right
on the table.

364
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,151
Right there?

365
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,820
Oh, my shoes
are untied.

366
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,614
- Hello!
- Hi!

367
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:13,866
Are there anymore
bags in the car?

368
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,033
Oh yeah, just one.

369
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,076
You know what,
let me get it though,

370
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:18,036
because
I have no idea

371
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,913
how this kitchen is
organized anymore, so.

372
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:21,206
Okay.

373
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:22,708
I'll be right back.

374
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,342
Hey Susan!

375
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,261
Do you remember this?

376
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:43,353
That's okay.

377
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,897
Carol, did you
get cream cheese?

378
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,732
- Yes
- I love you

379
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:49,818
You want it across the board
on toasted sesame, Fred?

380
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,361
Sure!

381
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,362
How about you, Susan?

382
00:26:55,365 --> 00:27:00,078
Whoop dee do!

383
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,129
Two across
the board

384
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,964
on toasted sesame
for the youngsters;

385
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,674
I'm going to
make a salad.

386
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,384
I want pie é la Mode.

387
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,929
Aha, not until
after you finish lunch.

388
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,722
Okay.

389
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,849
So what are you guys
doing for the summer?

390
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,976
Actually, so
far me and Jess

391
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:25,187
have made zero
plans for the summer.

392
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:26,104
How about you
and Patrick?

393
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:28,398
What can I do?

394
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,650
If you don't mind,

395
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:33,737
the ones that grandpa
likes, the big ones.

396
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,031
You know, we are
probably going to end up

397
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,366
just staying
in the city.

398
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:39,785
Well, that can
be really nice.

399
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,328
I mean, the summertime
is really quiet

400
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,162
and you really
get to know people.

401
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,373
It's different.

402
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,750
Well, you make it
sound so appealing.

403
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,793
Oh, I'm
sincere about it,

404
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:48,877
it can be very nice.

405
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,256
By the way, how late are
you planning to stay?

406
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:53,715
I mean, I can
always take a train

407
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:57,052
I'm sure we're all going to
leave around the same time;

408
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,263
definitely before
dinner though.

409
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,974
Of being able to avoid
Maestro if possible,

410
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,809
but if I can't,
I guess I can't.

411
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:06,436
Victoria, would you mind
getting me some cream cheese

412
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,896
from the fridge?

413
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:09,231
Okay.

414
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:10,941
Ouch!
Jesus, that's hot.

415
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,945
That oil tank
is the bomb, man.

416
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:18,740
Yeah, you have to finish
help making lunch though.

417
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,034
I just want to see it,
then I'll come help.

418
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,954
All right! Uh, you're going
to help clean up afterwards?

419
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,122
Yeah.

420
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:28,208
But be careful there's a
lot of stuff down there.

421
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,710
Okay.

422
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:40,262
Umm, listen,

423
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:41,847
I think maybe we
ought to consider

424
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,099
packing up a lot
of mom's stuff today

425
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,767
so that Tuesday is not a big
ordeal, you know what I mean?

426
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,227
It's not going
to be a big ordeal.

427
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,979
I'm just going to take
the necessary things.

428
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:51,023
Really, I'd rather
just wait till Tuesday.

429
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:51,940
All right!

430
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:55,068
Hey, how did
it go with Fred?

431
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,738
Fantastic!

432
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,114
Victoria, do we have
a peeler anywhere?

433
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,949
Yeah.

434
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,075
Hold on, I'll get it.

435
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,243
All right! Thank you!

436
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:34,191
How do you like
the salad, Fred?

437
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:35,984
Very good!

438
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,528
- It's great!
- Thank you!

439
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:40,531
Pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

440
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,782
Hey, you can
finish your lunch

441
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,242
you can have
that pie é la Mode.

442
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:44,827
- Great!
- Uh-huh.

443
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,871
When do we hear about the
schools for the Captain?

444
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,540
She's going to
Horace Riverston next year.

445
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,291
She got a scholarship.

446
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,126
- That's great!
- Congratulations!

447
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,378
- Wow, fantastic!
- Than ks!

448
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:56,004
That's so wonderful!

449
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:56,839
I'm so proud of her.

450
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,923
I'm proud!

451
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:00,551
Oh, you know,
well, your dad and I

452
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:01,927
are talking
about that one.

453
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:03,345
My life depends on it.

454
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:04,930
Susan, you're going to be
seeing a lot more of us

455
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:09,101
You're going to get to
see us all the time.

456
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:12,229
Will live in the same building
as you, just two floors below.

457
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,857
- It's going to be wonderful!
- I'm not going.

458
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,525
Oh! Dad, you've got
to at least try.

459
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:19,903
I'm not going
without Ginger.

460
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,947
Where's Ginger?
Did you see Ginger?

461
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,241
I'm not going anyplace
they don't allow pussy.

462
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,208
Grant me strength, idiot!

463
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,542
Oh, I think I
know who's here.

464
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:16,293
Maestro's here!

465
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:18,879
Okay.

466
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:20,923
Listen, I promise, I promise,
I'm going to be nice.

467
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,466
Okay, if you say so.

468
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:25,177
- How are you?
- Maestro's here. -I'm okay.

469
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:26,637
- Hey Bob!
- Hi Carol!

470
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:27,471
- How are you doing?
- How are you?

471
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:28,889
It's good to see you.

472
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,015
Nice to see you!
Did you guys have lunch yet?

473
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:31,308
Yeah. I've got
a special treat

474
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:32,100
I'm making, you might
want to sit down.

475
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,521
You know, Susan is resting
in the other room today

476
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:37,272
so can you come and do
the music session there?

477
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:40,192
We'll just pull my keyboard
into the room and...

478
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:41,401
Move it in.

479
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,153
- Lila, you'll help me, right?
- Yeah.

480
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:44,321
Okay.

481
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:47,282
Do you mind going to the
fridge and get me the...

482
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,493
like the nova, the cream
cheese, maybe some vegetables.

483
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,954
You know, we don't
have any left.

484
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:53,372
Sure, there is.
There was a lot left.

485
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:55,499
I'm going to make
Bob's Bagel.

486
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:59,294
No, I told you,
there's nothing.

487
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,380
What happened to
the Everything Bagel?

488
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,006
- Hi e"eFYbodyl
- Bob! '

489
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,676
- How are you?
- Good to see you!

490
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,261
Oh, you can just take
that stuff straight through

491
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:10,138
We'll be there
in a minute.

492
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:12,391
I got it.

493
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,519
Listen, Carol,

494
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,938
just because you happened
to be a psychotherapist

495
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,190
doesn't mean you see the dark
recesses of everybody's hearts

496
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,692
or their
stomachs either.

497
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:25,195
This has nothing to do with
me being a psychotherapist.

498
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:29,700
You asked if I had brought
three Everything Bagels.

499
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,160
I think you had a personal
interest in those.

500
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,327
That's exactly
my point,

501
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:33,704
if I wanted to
have all three

502
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,539
would I draw attention to
it like that in the car?

503
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,041
Yeah, I think you would.

504
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,376
I like Bob.

505
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,586
I want to give him
something special.

506
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:42,421
He has a personal
relationship with mom.

507
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:43,589
I'd like to
give him a gift.

508
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:44,673
Come on, he works for us.

509
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,133
He's in our employ.

510
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,968
He doesn't need
a gift basket

511
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,219
every time he comes
to our house.

512
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,637
I'm not giving
him a gift basket.

513
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,306
I'm giving him an
Everything Bagel.

514
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,515
He's an artist.

515
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:55,517
Awonderful,
wonderful artist!

516
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,561
Pretty soon he and I are
going to be working together.

517
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,314
He's going to be ticking out
Hava Nagila at a bar mitzvah

518
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:02,441
and I'll be committing the
whole thing to eternal video;

519
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:08,197
And anyway, the two of you
would work horribly together.

520
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:10,199
What have you
got against Bob?

521
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:13,368
I'm Bob.

522
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,204
There can only be one Bob.

523
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:16,580
And speaking
ontologically,

524
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,707
there can only be
one everything.

525
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:20,584
Not three
everythings, not two.

526
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:24,338
There can only be one
everything in the end.

527
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,048
Now, there are
no everythings,

528
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:28,050
so why don't you go in
there and at least help him.

529
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,343
I certainly would be
delighted to help that

530
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:31,136
wonderful artist.

531
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:35,557
What am I
going to do now?

532
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,517
You know Susan,

533
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:38,060
you are my
favorite student

534
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,311
and I promise you

535
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:41,230
we'll sing all of your
favorite songs today.

536
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:45,484
How are you
feeling, mom?

537
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,032
Ah, listen, Maestro,

538
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:55,202
is there anything that I
could do to, you know, help?

539
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,453
You want to help?

540
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,164
Yes, I want to help.

541
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,582
Okay.

542
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:04,086
Well, I'm setting the
chairs up around Susan here

543
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:06,046
so why don't you help me
finish with these chairs?

544
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:06,588
Sure!

545
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:09,716
- Hey Bob!
- Yeah?

546
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,635
Hey Bob!

547
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:16,265
I'm so sorry, it
seems that all three

548
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:18,141
Everything Bagels
have disappeared.

549
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,142
All three of them.

550
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:20,310
That's too bad.

551
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,564
I, umm... I could
give you some carrots.

552
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,691
Oh no, thanks, I'll pass.

553
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:27,818
Sorry dad.

554
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:30,487
Listen, do you think
maybe we could get...

555
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:31,655
We could get
Victoria in here

556
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:35,534
No, let Victoria please finish
cleaning up in the kitchen.

557
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:37,369
I want Victoria
to sing with us.

558
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,453
Okay, go get her.
Go get her.

559
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,414
Victoria!

560
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:43,333
Can you sing with us?

561
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,502
Here we go.

562
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:47,838
Okay, come sit
over here, sweetie.

563
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,840
- Good! Can you sit next to me?
- You can sit by Fred.

564
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,799
Go ahead, sweetie.

565
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,801
Thank you!

566
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:55,137
And come sit over here
between me and Fred.

567
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,309
Lila, would you
do me a favor?

568
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,686
Listen, just for
my own information,

569
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:05,189
just for my own sort of
understanding of things,

570
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:07,774
this whole thing is really kind
of for mom's benefit, right,

571
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:09,193
is it really necessary

572
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,320
that all of us have
to get together

573
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,405
and do the whole
singing bit?

574
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:14,656
Come on!

575
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:15,616
It will be fun.

576
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:16,867
We go over this
every week.

577
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,660
It will be fun.

578
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:21,705
You know something, if you
really want to help your mother,

579
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:24,750
everybody enjoying this
together is extremely helpful.

580
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,876
All right, fine.
I'm sorry. I apologize.

581
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:26,877
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

582
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:29,129
All right!

583
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:33,634
Susan, why don't we start
with our very favorite tune?

584
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,574
Everybody!

585
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,598
I'm sorry, this is
just depressing.

586
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:22,766
I'm just going
to kill myself.

587
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:23,725
I cannot take this.

588
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:25,519
It's not that bad.

589
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,603
I'm sorry.

590
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:27,521
I'm... I'm sorry.

591
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:29,815
Oh, come on, come on.

592
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:32,693
Look, look, I've
got a beat for you.

593
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:35,863
Here we go.

594
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:36,840
Great!
Great!

595
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,677
All right, let's
hear it fellows.

596
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:42,429
Who remember Silvery Moon?

597
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:43,639
- Oh.
- Oh, Silvery Moon.

598
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,723
Come on.

599
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:46,975
- Silvery Moon.
- What's that smell?

600
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,393
Silvery Moon.

601
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:50,020
With a spoon, yeah.

602
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,980
Here we go.

603
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,935
Here we go again.

604
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:51,058
- Very nice!
- Beautiful!

605
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:53,685
Very nice!

606
00:39:58,815 --> 00:39:59,816
Okay.

607
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:18,502
What happened to the
painting of the horse?

608
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:22,589
Umm, Fred gave
it to a museum.

609
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,925
VVhy?

610
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:29,054
Well, it made him feel like a
very wealthy, important person.

611
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:31,640
Is he wealthy?

612
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,850
No.

613
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:14,224
And when she's happy it makes
it much better for all of us.

614
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:15,142
- I used to...
- Thank you! Thank you, Fred!

615
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:21,899
I used to be involved in a
way with the music business.

616
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:24,610
I made boxes

617
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:29,156
and at the time when
there were record albums,

618
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:34,578
we would manufacture and
produce the sleeves, the jackets

619
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:35,829
that the albums
would go in;

620
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:39,124
Broadway shows
and different artists

621
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:41,210
and all kinds of things.

622
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,254
So we really love music.

623
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:48,550
You know, there was
something so romantic about

624
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:50,052
going into a
record store

625
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:53,889
and seeing those big boxes
all lined up on the shelves.

626
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:58,852
I couldn't wait to find
my most favorite new artist

627
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:01,772
and bring that...
that record home,

628
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:06,193
take the packaging off,
smell it, read everything,

629
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,945
even before I
listened to the music,

630
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,280
it was such a
big deal to myself

631
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,866
and all of my
friends growing up.

632
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:17,246
Oh, I didn't know
that people smelled it.

633
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,665
I used to like
to smell books.

634
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:23,710
Well, you know, it's like those
mimeograph smells from school.

635
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,046
We all thought it...
it just meant something

636
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,966
to have such a great
new record and...

637
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:31,677
and every bit of the
sensation attached to it

638
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:33,220
was important to us.

639
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,641
We used to listen to
Glenn Miller and Bing Crosby.

640
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:41,603
Oh, Susan loved
Bing Crosby.

641
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:44,982
I had an album of...

642
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:47,860
for Dumbo,
the movie Dumbo,

643
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:53,198
and each side of each
record at that time

644
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:56,952
was a different song,
you know, it was great.

645
00:42:56,994 --> 00:43:01,123
I never saw an elephant
fly, and oh my goodness,

646
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:06,962
and Pinocchio also was
really great, great music, so.

647
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:11,717
In a little way I was a
part of the music business,

648
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:14,261
as far as the
packaging of it.

649
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:34,883
- Hey Bob!
- Yeah.

650
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,844
Can you come on
in here for a sec;

651
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:37,678
I'd just like
to talk to you?

652
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:38,887
Okay.

653
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:40,889
I guess it's going
to rain anyway.

654
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:41,932
Are you sure?
I think it's clearing.

655
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:43,267
Come on.

656
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:50,107
Okay.

657
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:52,901
Look, I knowl
haven't been entirely

658
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:54,153
what you might call

659
00:44:54,153 --> 00:44:57,072
supportive of the whole
music therapy thing.

660
00:44:57,072 --> 00:45:00,033
Well, the thing is I see
that it has been good for them.

661
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:01,201
I mean, it has really
made a difference.

662
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:03,120
I want to thank
you for that.

663
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,164
The thing that I didn't
get to tell you before was

664
00:45:05,164 --> 00:45:09,710
next Tuesday my mother is going
into a facility in the city.

665
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,378
So like all good things

666
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:13,463
I'm afraid music therapy
is going to come to an end.

667
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:15,257
Oh, that's such a shame.

668
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:17,384
Well, you know, at least I
can still come once a week,

669
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,303
because there's
still Fred to work with,

670
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:23,182
Yeah, I know, I could see
that he really enjoys it.

671
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:26,268
But the thing is
the following week

672
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:29,271
Fred is also going
into the same facility.

673
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:30,856
You know, he didn't say
a word to me about this,

674
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:32,065
are you sure,
becauseifs“.

675
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:34,776
Well, he may not yet
understand it fully,

676
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:37,362
he will definitely be going
into the same place.

677
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:39,239
Ijust had a 10-minute
conversation with him,

678
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,782
we talked about music

679
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:43,160
Bob, you've got
to trust me on this one.

680
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,453
It's my
company's checks

681
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:46,788
that pay for you and
that pay for Victoria

682
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:48,040
and all the
support they get.

683
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,292
He definitely is moving
to that same facility

684
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:51,877
two floors below her

685
00:45:51,877 --> 00:45:53,504
a week after
she goes in.

686
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:56,048
You've got to
believe me.

687
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:57,341
Actually, you
know something,

688
00:45:57,341 --> 00:46:01,512
because I do a lot of
work in these facilities,

689
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:03,931
it's just a keyboard
and a stand.

690
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:06,850
I'll just bring it
into the facility.

691
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,228
Well, I'm not sure
what the facility's

692
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:10,896
policies are about
that sort of thing,

693
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:12,815
It's... it's done
all the time.

694
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:14,441
- Is it?
- I assure you.

695
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:16,193
Well, I'll certainly be
happy to research it

696
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:17,152
and give you
the answer.

697
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:19,446
We could certainly
give it a try.

698
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:20,405
Okay, all right!

699
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:21,865
Fair enough.

700
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:23,242
In the meantime, ljust
wanted to give you this,

701
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:24,785
just sort of a
little thank you.

702
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:28,038
Butjust to say
our extra thanks.

703
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:31,333
- Thanks!
- My pleasure!

704
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,502
Oh, by the way,

705
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:35,379
I downloaded ten minutes
of the film of yours

706
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:36,505
the other day
on my cellphone.

707
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:38,507
No kidding! Which one?

708
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:40,050
It's that clown thing.

709
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,386
That's a comedy,
I think, right?

710
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,099
Well, thank you
for everything!

711
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,351
I appreciate it!

712
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:50,519
Okay.

713
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:51,520
Think about
what I said, okay?

714
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,479
I sure will.

715
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:53,272
Okay.

716
00:46:57,192 --> 00:47:01,822
Hava Nagila Hava
Nagila Hava...

717
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,876
So how did
he take it?

718
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:15,210
Well, it
wasn't great,

719
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,503
but he will
be all right.

720
00:47:18,964 --> 00:47:20,215
I need ajump.

721
00:47:20,257 --> 00:47:21,300
Ajump?

722
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,218
Ajump.

723
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:51,622
That guy shows
up one more time

724
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:54,416
I'm going to have to put
a stake through his heart.

725
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,336
Hey, isn't this where
mom's frog pond used to be?

726
00:47:57,336 --> 00:47:59,046
Oh yeah.

727
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:01,381
I guess they covered it
over after mom got sick.

728
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:04,176
You know, it used
to be just a fountain

729
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:06,470
and then this
frog showed up.

730
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,555
I wonder if
mom kissed it.

731
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:12,392
I mean, that's
how she met Fred.

732
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:14,019
Come on.
Let's go get Susan.

733
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:24,655
Nice night, huh?

734
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:31,161
Here you go.

735
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,175
- Captain?
- Yeah?

736
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:46,426
- Want to play catch?
- Yeah.

737
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:48,011
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

738
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:52,140
Wait for me.

739
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,517
Do I have to?

740
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:01,441
Dad, can I get
you something?

741
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:03,485
No.

742
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:05,946
You want to go outside;
I can get your cane?

743
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:08,991
I don't use a cane.

744
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:10,659
All right! Do you
want to go outside?

745
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:17,666
Fred, have you paid
your taxes yet?

746
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:20,502
No.

747
00:49:20,544 --> 00:49:21,587
VVhy?

748
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:27,092
I don't owe anything.

749
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:41,523
Nice!

750
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:42,733
I got it!

751
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:44,151
I got it with one hand.

752
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:46,445
What?

753
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:48,030
Come on, throw the ball.

754
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,991
Look, come here,
let show you something.

755
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:52,451
See those two trees?

756
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:53,994
Yeah.

757
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,747
You know who Zeus
and Hermes were, right?

758
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,540
They were Greek Gods.

759
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,250
That's right.

760
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,378
Back in the olden days
Zeus and Hermes heard

761
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:05,631
weren't acting the way
they wanted them to.

762
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:06,757
They weren't
being nice

763
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:08,383
and friendly
to the others.

764
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:11,053
They weren't acting with
what the Greeks called xenia,

765
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:13,722
which means
like hospitality.

766
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:16,475
So they decided to
check it out themselves.

767
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:18,685
So they got dressed
up in costumes

768
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:21,355
and pretended to
be ordinary people.

769
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:23,357
So they went walking
around among the Greeks

770
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:25,067
trying to find somebody
who would be nice to them

771
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,069
who would let them stay at
their house for the night.

772
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,404
They couldn't find
anybody to do that.

773
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:31,657
And finally they found
this one poor old couple.

774
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:35,702
They were called
Philemon and Baucis.

775
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:39,248
Would let them stay
over at their house.

776
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,167
In the morning Zeus and
Hermes were so happy

777
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,418
they told Philemon
and Baucis

778
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,295
they could
have one wish.

779
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:47,548
What did they wish for?

780
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:49,299
They wished

781
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:52,177
that they would die
together at the same time

782
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:55,264
so that neither one would have
to go on without the other.

783
00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:57,558
You know what
the Gods did?

784
00:50:57,558 --> 00:51:00,811
They turned them into two big
oak trees standing together,

785
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:02,271
just like that.

786
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,772
They went on
like that forever.

787
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:10,696
So what really
happens after you die?

788
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:18,829
You and me and mommy
and grandma and grandpa

789
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:20,455
but, uh, I don't know.

790
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:24,668
Look after grandma. I'm going
to get some stuff, all right?

791
00:51:24,668 --> 00:51:25,711
All right!

792
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:33,343
You don't mind if I
leave you in Lila's care

793
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,762
for a minute, do you?

794
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:37,222
Okay.

795
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,335
Captain!

796
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:31,879
Over here!

797
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:33,714
We gotta motor!

798
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:35,883
It's time to say goodbye.

799
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:37,217
Coming!

800
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:44,516
Come on!

801
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:17,729
Fred, are you okay?

802
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:26,488
Yeah.

803
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,156
Are you okay?

804
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:28,824
Is everything all right?

805
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:30,951
Stop bothering me.

806
00:58:26,632 --> 00:58:28,050
Good morning, Fred!

807
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,843
Good morning!

808
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,680
Hold on, let me get
that coffee for you!

809
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,806
No, no, no, I'll get it.

810
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:36,975
No, I got it.

811
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:41,063
Just sit.

812
00:58:47,653 --> 00:58:49,238
You know,

813
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:51,240
your son and
daughter, Carol, Bob,

814
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,617
they're coming today?

815
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:55,160
Are they
bringing the boys

816
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,746
and the Captain
with them?

817
00:58:57,746 --> 00:59:00,874
No, they're coming to help
you pack up your things

818
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:03,877
and, you know,
move you into the city.

819
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,046
Why am I going
to the city?

820
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:12,094
You agreed that
it was for the best.

821
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:15,931
Best for what?

822
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:17,099
For you.

823
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:25,774
I wouldn't ever speculate
about the future,

824
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:29,319
not when it has to do with
where I'm going to live.

825
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:31,113
That wouldn't make
sense, would it?

826
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:33,907
Yes, but you agreed.

827
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:37,077
Well, who would be here
when Susan gets back?

828
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:46,128
Fred, you know
they love you, right?

829
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,754
I love them.

830
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:49,965
I know that you do, Fred.

831
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:54,636
How's your husband?

832
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,764
He's fine.

833
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:00,851
How did Ghana do?

834
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:02,728
They lost.

835
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:04,813
I'm sorry.

836
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:06,356
Was it a close game?

837
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:08,650
You know what, I don't
want to talk about that.

838
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,903
I know how you feel.

839
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:13,113
Really?

840
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:17,117
Yes, I think I do,
Queen Victoria.

841
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:19,119
You know, you really
should be with Susan.

842
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:23,290
She doesn't even know
who I am anymore.

843
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:27,878
Yes, but if she sees you
then she'll know who you are.

844
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:31,006
In this I think that
your children are right.

845
01:00:33,884 --> 01:00:35,886
You know, Carol,

846
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:39,223
she told me this
story about you.

847
01:00:39,223 --> 01:00:41,767
She told me that
when they were younger

848
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:44,228
you used to take
the three of them

849
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:47,856
into town on Saturdays
to the supermarket.

850
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:50,025
- She told you?
- Yeah.

851
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:52,194
I mean, who else
would tell me?

852
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:55,322
She said that, uh, you did it
to give, uh, Susan a break.

853
01:00:56,698 --> 01:00:58,992
- She remembered?
- Uh-huh.

854
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:01,078
You see, that's
what I'm saying,

855
01:01:01,078 --> 01:01:03,038
your children,
they love you.

856
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,373
That's very sweet.

857
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:06,375
Uh-huh.

858
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:14,383
Hi dad!

859
01:01:14,424 --> 01:01:16,218
Hello Robert!

860
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:18,053
Well,

861
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:19,680
time to get
ready to go.

862
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,892
We came today so we
could help you decide

863
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:26,854
whatever it is you want
to take so you can be,

864
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:28,981
you know, comfortable
in the new place.

865
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:32,401
Didn't you bring the
boys or the Captain?

866
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:34,403
No, we didn't think the, uh,

867
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:37,239
the timing
was right for that.

868
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:38,699
I'm not going.

869
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:44,204
Dad, look, nobody is saying you
have to go today, all right?

870
01:01:44,204 --> 01:01:46,748
I'd like you to try
and think of us

871
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:50,169
as your family/image
consultants.

872
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:51,879
In other words, we're
going to help you decide

873
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:54,298
what of your possessions
you want to take with you

874
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:56,258
so that you can keep
the same sort of, uh,

875
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:59,011
public persona you've always
had there when you

876
01:01:59,011 --> 01:02:01,221
when you... when
you're in your new place.

877
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:03,182
Nobody is saying you
have to leave today,

878
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:05,476
but the thing is you have
to understand that in two days,

879
01:02:05,476 --> 01:02:09,271
you really do have to
get ready to go.

880
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:16,737
Once I shared space with
a public relations firm,

881
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:19,406
they were sort of
sleazy characters

882
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:22,493
and they did quite a bit of
business with prostitutes.

883
01:02:22,493 --> 01:02:24,953
They offered me a key.

884
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:28,248
The government shut them down
for not paying their taxes.

885
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:29,791
This is
condescending bullshit!

886
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,251
Always, dad,
will you listen?

887
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:33,128
- Bob!
- Same bullshit again and again

888
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,964
I want you to take
a break, okay?

889
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:38,759
Drive into town,
go do some shopping,

890
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,427
come back in
like a half hour.

891
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:41,970
You know what?

892
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:44,139
You are a stubborn old man.

893
01:02:44,181 --> 01:02:45,474
You're getting like a child.

894
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:46,850
No, I'm serious.

895
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:49,353
You have to deal
with what is.

896
01:02:49,353 --> 01:02:51,814
I'm sorry. I'm just
getting tired of this.

897
01:02:51,814 --> 01:02:52,815
These are all yours.

898
01:02:52,815 --> 01:02:56,276
No, just go.
All right! Okay.

899
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:57,528
Excuse me.

900
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:02,157
Don't use the front door.

901
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:10,833
The melon is sweet.

902
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:03,552
Dad, I...

903
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:07,181
you know, I can
really understand why

904
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:09,266
why you want
to stay here.

905
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,619
Freddie, you
know you could, uh,

906
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:30,412
you can always
get me back.

907
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,338
There is no everything,

908
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:43,008
just this place,
and I want to stay here.

909
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,347
Yeah, I know, I know,

910
01:04:49,932 --> 01:04:53,227
but why don't you just give
this other thing a try?

911
01:04:53,227 --> 01:04:56,980
So Oedipus was
very depressed

912
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,149
and his friends
said, Oedipus,

913
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:01,944
you need a vacation,

914
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,612
why don't you
go to New York,

915
01:05:03,654 --> 01:05:07,574
see a few plays, relax?

916
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:13,497
So Oedipus flew to
New York and he got a cab,

917
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:16,500
and the impatient cab
driver turned to Oedipus

918
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,294
and said, where do you
want to go, motherfucker?

919
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:23,298
I need a vodka.

920
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:29,137
Fred

921
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,643
Susan is not
coming back.

922
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:41,150
Her Alzheimer's
is getting worse

923
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:47,447
she just needs more care
than she can get here.

924
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:50,993
Now, you can... you
can live right near her

925
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,954
and you can
see her everyday

926
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:56,582
and we'll both
come and see you too,

927
01:05:56,582 --> 01:06:00,419
us, the boys,
the Captain.

928
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:23,192
Jim!

929
01:06:24,735 --> 01:06:26,528
- Bob!
- Yeah.

930
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:29,364
I've got the whole
Wolfman Jack thing going on.

931
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:31,575
I'm doing good!
Thanks. How about you?

932
01:06:31,575 --> 01:06:33,035
Gee, you look great.

933
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:35,204
How often do you run?

934
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:38,332
Two times a week;
three. What do you do?

935
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:40,375
Well, I get the urge to
workout every so often,

936
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,211
I like to lie
down till it passes.

937
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:43,629
You know, I hear
about you all the time,

938
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:45,589
you're like a big success
story around here.

939
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:48,091
Since I gave
my life to Jesus.

940
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:49,468
That's great!

941
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:51,303
Well, you must still
work pretty hard, right?

942
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:52,554
I still have
time to volunteer

943
01:06:52,596 --> 01:06:54,389
at the animal shelter
on the weekends.

944
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:55,724
No kidding!

945
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:58,727
How's your family, your
mom and dad still around?

946
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:00,354
Yeah, thanks for asking.
They're doing well.

947
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:01,396
They're retired.

948
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:02,564
They live up in Nantucket.

949
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:04,358
They love it.
Hey, how's your folks?

950
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:06,401
I run by their house
every once in a while.

951
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:07,736
I haven't seen
them for a while.

952
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:10,113
Your dad is such
a force of nature.

953
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:11,448
Yeah, he certainly is.

954
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:13,492
Well, they're
doing okay. They're hanging in.

955
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:15,536
Oh, that's great!
How's the film business?

956
01:07:15,536 --> 01:07:17,246
The film business
is very interesting.

957
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:18,789
It's always changing
and evolving.

958
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:21,750
It's taken sort of a turn
towards the Internet now.

959
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,585
That must be so exciting.

960
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:26,755
Yeah, exciting is, uh,
is exactly what it is.

961
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:28,340
You really should
think of working out,

962
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,634
you know, get the
endorphins going.

963
01:07:30,634 --> 01:07:32,261
Listen, I've got to
keep my heart rate up.

964
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:33,303
Good to see you!

965
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:34,763
Great to see you!

966
01:07:34,763 --> 01:07:37,099
Give my regards
to Jim Jones.

967
01:08:55,344 --> 01:08:57,346
Remember the swing
that used to be here?

968
01:08:57,387 --> 01:09:00,140
Yeah, that was fun, huh?

969
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,600
Oh my God! Great!

970
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:07,773
Yeah, yeah, he agreed
to leave this Tuesday.

971
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:09,525
That's great!

972
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:13,362
He's just going to forget
that he agreed to it.

973
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:15,697
He would sit there and
zip his tap water vodka

974
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:17,866
and again not want to go,

975
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:19,868
or if he does go,

976
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,370
he's going to
want to return.

977
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:22,663
Listen you don't mind
if I take the car, right,

978
01:09:22,663 --> 01:09:24,331
I have sort of an idea?

979
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:25,916
No, where
are you going?

980
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:28,210
It won't take long.
I'll be right back.

981
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:14,381
Carol?

982
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:15,924
Victoria?

983
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:18,260
Can I see
outside for a sec.

984
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,929
Don't use the front door.

985
01:10:23,974 --> 01:10:25,434
What's up?

986
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:40,282
What is that?

987
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,658
A ginger cat,

988
01:10:41,658 --> 01:10:43,952
freshly plucked from
the animal shelter.

989
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:47,706
Yeah, but it's not Ginger,
it's another fucking red cat.

990
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:48,749
Bob, you're crazy.

991
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:50,542
I mean, he'll know.

992
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:52,628
I think you've really
gone crazy this time.

993
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:54,421
Listen, your father,
he's not a well man.

994
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:55,923
You cannot play these
kinds of games on him.

995
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:57,966
I'm not
playing any games.

996
01:10:58,008 --> 01:10:59,927
What do you guys
trust me, please?

997
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:01,803
One Time! But what is
this supposed to do?

998
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:03,305
What is this going to do?

999
01:11:05,474 --> 01:11:06,683
Here we go, sweetie.

1000
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:09,603
Come on , come on.

1001
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:11,355
L90tyou.

1002
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:14,525
Just give me one
minute, all right.

1003
01:11:20,572 --> 01:11:22,366
Hey Fred,

1004
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:25,035
look who I found?

1005
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:26,995
Ginger!

1006
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:28,497
Yeah.

1007
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:30,624
I was in the back looking
at the two old trees

1008
01:11:30,624 --> 01:11:33,752
and I see this little
orange ball way up at the top.

1009
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:35,629
And I tried waving, but I guess
she didn't recognize me,

1010
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:37,047
so I climbed up the tree,

1011
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:38,549
and I guess then
she knew me,

1012
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:40,509
because she came
down into my arms

1013
01:11:40,509 --> 01:11:42,427
and here we are
to tell the tale.

1014
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:44,012
Hey guys!

1015
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:45,472
How is it going?

1016
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:47,516
Robert found Ginger.

1017
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:48,892
Watch out!

1018
01:11:53,021 --> 01:11:54,815
Come here, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

1019
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:02,823
Ginger!

1020
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:04,825
He's not going to
answer to Ginger.

1021
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:06,326
Why not?

1022
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:09,746
Here kitty.

1023
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:11,707
Where did you go?
