01:00:20,966 --> 01:00:23,056
Maybe I could sit with you for a minute

919

01:00:24,902 --> 01:00:26,055
That all right?

921
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,930
 How is he?

922
01:00:58,930 --> 01:00:59,830
 He'll be OK.

Hilton thinks the boy's father will lose custody of Lucky,

924
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,330
if they ever find the guy.

925
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:12,550
 From what we saw, he didn't appear to be much of a father

926
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:14,304
anyway.

927
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:15,768
 That's true.

928
01:01:19,672 --> 01:01:22,390
 You know, Hilton came up with this crazy idea

929
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:26,810
that maybe you and I should consider taking Lucky in.

930

 I said, no, of course.

932
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,810
There's all kinds of reasons why we can't.

933
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:48,540
I mean, we're still adjusting and, well, we just can't.

934
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:53,170
 Shouldn't we at least have talked about it?

935
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,950
 Why, you think I should have said yes?

936
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:57,561
 No, no, I just thought--

 Sure.

 Pretty bad, was it?

 Well, of course he was.

961
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:14,610
You know, Jeff always worked alone.

Why?

963

What would you do?

986
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:30,370
 Well, I'd miss it.

987
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:33,670
But the ball would probably hit me in the chest.

988
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,400
 Keeping the ball in front of you, that's good.

989
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,810
 And then I'd see if the guy on third was going home.

990
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:41,710
 That's very good.

01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:44,280

 Well-- I can't tell you why.

01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,200
 All right, yes.

1099
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,200
All right, that's it!

1100
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,200
That's a rally start!

1101
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,200
Let's go, Lucky!

1102
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,200
 No pitcher, no pitcher!

1103
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,700
Little foot, move 'em out!

1104
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,200
Little bingo, baby! Good for the punch!

1105
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,101
Punch it through!

1106
01:11:33,101 --> 01:11:34,666
Hit a screamer, Texas leaguer, out of the yard!

1107
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:35,610
Take 'em deep!

1108
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:37,312
Brown tripper, tater-tot, bat, bat, bat!

1109

1113
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:45,920
Hello?

1114
01:13:52,654 --> 01:13:55,060
Hello?

1115
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:56,270
Hi.

1116
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:59,040
Um, could you tell me where Mr. Godfrey is,

1117
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,250
he didn't show up at our game today.

1118
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,150
 He's dead.

1119
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:06,930
 What?

1120
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:08,250
 Dead.

1121
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,340
Died yesterday.

1122
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:16,585
 Oh.

1123
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:18,050
OK.

1124
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:19,690
Thank you.

1125
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:20,590
Mr. Godfrey?

Mr. Godfrey?

(SHOUTING) Mr. Godfrey!

1128
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:33,080
 What?

1129
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,450
Can't you be quiet.

1130
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:37,100
Some very old people living around here,

1131
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,000
don't you know that?

1132
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,070
 Well, I'm sorry, but the lady in the lobby

1133
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,960
said you were dead.

1134
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,430
 Oh, that's Tilda.

1135
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:46,130
She always pulls that on visitors.

1136
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:49,500
Sick sense of humor on that woman, but a darn good kisser.

1137
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,400
Come on.

1138
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,010
C'mon, I want to talk to you anyway.

1139
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:58,610
 Wow, nice TV.

1140
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:01,150
 Did you see the TV in the lobby?

1141
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:03,190
Nineteen inches and no remote.

1142
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:05,170
It's ridiculous.

1143
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:07,830
You want to-- you want to stay for supper?

1144
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:09,010
It's Thursday.

1145
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:12,520
Actually, I think we have solid food tonight.

1146
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:17,020
 No, actually, I just stopped by to make sure you were OK.

1147
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,390
Maybe some other night.

1148
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,690
Hopefully, another solid food night.

1149
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:23,410
 OK, well, go on.

1150
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:25,060
I'll see you later. - All right.

1151
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:25,960
 Uh, no, Bill.

1152
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:31,800
They're making me leave.

1153
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,660
They're sending me to someplace in New Hampshire.

1154
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:37,000
A place with more hands-on care.

1155
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,780
I've been blanking out lately.

1156
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:42,270
You know, like I did at the game last week.

1157
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:45,660
 Oh well, why don't you let me talk to them?

1158
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:47,770
 Oh no, no, please don't do that.

1159
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:49,460
It's all right the way it is, really it is.

1160
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:52,400
 Well, when are you leaving?

1161
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,770
 Tomorrow.

1162
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:56,980
 Tomorrow.

I-- we-- we've still got a couple of games left,

1164
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:01,330
I mean the kids need you.

1165
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:03,440
Maybe they can put this off for a while.

1166
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,380
 No, no, it's OK, really.

1167
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:08,070
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1168
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:10,960
I just wanted to take that and don't

1169
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,250
open it until you get home.

1170
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:18,180
Bill, you've been a good friend.

1171
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:22,110
Asking me to help with the kids has made me feel useful.

1172
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:24,360
I haven't had many chances to feel like that lately.

1173
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,196
 You should at least say goodbye to them.

1174
01:16:29,196 --> 01:16:34,610
 At my age, you kinda want to limit your goodbyes.

1175
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:37,064
You do it for me, will you?

1176
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:39,940
 OK.

1177
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:45,210
 And Bill, it's good that you care for those kids.

1178
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:46,715
But you take care of you.

1179
01:16:49,515 --> 01:16:51,990
 Me?

1180
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:56,940
I'm fine, just fine.

1181
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:57,930
I'm great.

1182
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:03,370
Just great.

1183
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:09,920
Mr. Godfrey, I'm falling apart here,

1184
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,110
and I don't know what to do about it.

1185
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:15,570
Pain is everywhere, Bill.

1186
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:17,500
It's surrounds us all.

1187
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,580
It hangs in the air waiting for us

1188
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:22,570
and one day it decides to stick.

You can't avoid it.

1190
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:26,795
You can't shake it.

1191
01:17:26,795 --> 01:17:29,652
You can only make your peace with it.

1192
01:17:29,652 --> 01:17:31,965
Now, why don't you go home to that wife of yours.

1193

 My pleasure.

1198
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,640
You know, one of the regrets of my life,

1199
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,200
it's not something I said, something I did,

1200
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:06,200
just that I worried too much, took things too seriously.

1201
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,030
Ruby knew that and she tried to tell me, but I never got it.

1202
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:13,350
I'd sit in the front seat and cringe and let her run

Don't forget that, Bill.

 No, no, no, no, no, everything's fine.

I just need you to tell me everything

1214
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:08,170
you know about Lucky's father.

1215
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:11,730
 Oh, well, I don't know much.

01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:12,660

Doesn't seem to take much interest and his kid.

1219
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:20,290
I've never met him.

1220
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:22,150
 I was afraid of that.

1221
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:24,150
I did some nosing around yesterday.

1222
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:27,480
Put out an APB for the truck and I made some calls.

1223
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,310
 Yeah, what did you find out?

1224
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:32,070
 Well, Lucky Diamond was born in Boston.

1225
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:34,230
And his mother was a 15-year-old runaway.

1226

Other than that, we don't know anything.

1227

And that truck you were talking about?

1228
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,150
 Yeah.

1229
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,560
 That truck belongs to Hilton.

 In here.

01:19:58,968 --> 01:20:00,690
Oh my, I was about to send out a search party.

01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:01,590
Ooh!

1234
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,300
 I just saw Jamie.

 You're kidding?

1238
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:13,910
 So he's logging Hilton's land, he's driving Hilton's truck.

1239
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,280
I'm going over there to get some answers.

1240
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,330
 Who's here?

1241
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:20,400
 Lucky.

1242
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,300
Eunice dropped him by.

1243
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,650
He's out back.

1244
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:25,410
You should have seen his eyes when I showed him the trains.

1245
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:26,890
 Come on, say hello.

1246
01:20:33,507 --> 01:20:34,740
 You're out here running the trains?

1247
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:38,250
 It took me a half hour to figure out how to turn them on.

1248
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,720
We derailed them three times before we

1249
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,920
finally got the hang of it.

1250
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,820
Oh!

1251
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:43,380
Lucky came up with this great idea

1252
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,310
to add a mountain with a trestle.

1253
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:47,220
Now, it'll probably cost a fortune

1254
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,080
but I think we ought to try it.

1255
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,870
 I thought you, um--

1256
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:57,145
I thought you wanted to tear all that stuff out of there.

1257
01:20:57,145 --> 01:21:00,150
 Well, yeah, but that was--

1258
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:01,620
why are you getting upset?

1259
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,700
 I'm not upset.

1260
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:06,000
Just you've never shown any interest in those trains

1261
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,946
before, that's all.

1262
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:12,760
 I was always interested, you just never thought to notice.

1263
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,730
Look, why don't you come join us,

1264
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:15,990
you can talk to Hilton tomorrow.

1265
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:21,240
 No.

1266
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,250
I've got to talk to him tonight.

1267
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:25,540
 OK, fine, fine!

1268
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,900
I just thought it might be more fun for us to do this together.

1269
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:31,920
But I guess that room always has been a little too

1270
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,210
small for three people.

1271
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:36,930
 What does that mean?

1272
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,690
 There's a reason that door was always closed, Bill,

1273
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:45,380
and it wasn't because you wanted to talk about secret guy stuff,

1274
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:47,730
it was because you didn't want to share him with anybody,

1275
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:49,530
not even me.

1276
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,735
 That's not true.

1277
01:21:50,735 --> 01:21:54,510
 It is, Bill, you liked to keep him to yourself.

1278
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:59,370
Baseball, trains, hiking, camping,

1279
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:02,230
you cultivated interests with just the two of you,

1280
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:05,600
I was always the outsider.

1281
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,470
You even invented your own board games that just the two of you

1282
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:09,750
knew how to play!

1283
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:12,120
 We would have included you, if you'd asked.

1284
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,866
 Included me!

1285
01:22:13,866 --> 01:22:15,840
Bill, we're talking about a family

1286
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,490
here, not choosing sides for kickball.

1287
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:20,390
Come on, Lucky.

1288
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:30,260
You know why Nathaniel was an only child?

1289
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:33,670
Why we waited so long to have another baby?

1290
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:35,490
It's because it would have made Nathaniel

1291
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:37,655
seem not quite so special.

1292
01:22:37,655 --> 01:22:41,010
[CRYING] And I don't think you would have

1293
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:42,546
been able to deal with that.

1294
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,800
Well, the trains are all yours, Bill.

1295
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,360
 Hello, Bill.

1296
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:34,548
I love to come out here at night.

1297
01:23:34,548 --> 01:23:38,116
I look at the lake, watch the fish jump.

1298
01:23:38,116 --> 01:23:40,270
The mosquitoes eat me alive sometimes,

1299
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:42,760
but I guess it's worth it.

1300
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,925
 Who's Lucky's father?

1301
01:23:45,925 --> 01:23:49,330
 (CHUCKLING) You're a man who likes to get right to it,

1302
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:50,230
aren't you?

1303
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:55,105
 Did you know his mother?

1304
01:23:55,105 --> 01:23:56,005
 Suzy?

1305
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:01,270
No, not really.

1306
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:04,670
She was a child.

1307
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:09,490
She had no idea what she was getting herself into.

1308
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:13,815
 And just what was she getting herself into?

1309
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:16,070
HILTON: [SIGHS]

1310
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:18,410
 Come on, Hilton.

1311
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:20,630
Where's Lucky's father?

1312
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:24,260
And how were you involved in all this?

1313
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:27,710
 You know, a person can make a lot of mistakes

1314
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:30,710
in the course of one lifetime.

1315
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:34,020
Baseball players are no different.

1316
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:36,080
They drink too much, they gamble,

1317
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,240
they spend too much time at work, not enough time

1318
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,430
with their families.

1319
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:44,940
In short, they're just rotten Joe's just like the rest of us.

1320
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,270
They just have a lot further to fall than most of us do.

1321
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:53,300
 Lucky's father is a baseball player?

1322
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:58,085
 Lucky's father was a baseball player.

1323
01:24:58,085 --> 01:25:03,030
Ben Slaughter, rookie of the year in 1982.

1324
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:06,370
Sweetest swing I ever saw.

1325
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:07,610
 He the guy--

1326
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:10,070
 --who wrapped his car around a tree after

1327
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:13,640
leaving a party in my house.

1328
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:17,930
His blood alcohol was twice the legal limit.

1329
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:21,140
They said he was doing 92 when he hit the tree.

1330
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:28,150
Ninety-two miles an hour on a quiet suburban street.

1331
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:36,420
Suzy Diamond came forward at the funeral

1332
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:40,900
and told me that she was three months pregnant.

1333
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,280
She was 15 years old.

1334
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:48,380
I got her a job in Boston.

1335
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:50,060
She never got married.

1336
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,800
She worked.

1337
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:56,890
She poured everything she had into that boy, Lucky.

1338
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:59,780
And she died about a year ago--

1339
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:02,150
cancer.

1340
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:06,980
Lucky stayed with various relatives but none of them

1341
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:10,160
had any room for him.

1342
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,270
So I brought him here and I paid Jeff Grout to watch him for me

1343
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:17,240
until I could find him a home.

1344
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,190
 Meaning Harper and me.

1345
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:21,620
 You lost a boy.

1346
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:23,720
Everyone in town could see the pain you were in.

1347
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,150
 You set us up.

1348
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:34,200
 I told you nothing happens in this world without a reason.

1349
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,660
 So getting me to coach baseball,

1350
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,040
putting Lucky on my team, that was

1351
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,230
all part of a big ploy to manipulate Harper

1352
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:42,820
and me into adopting him?

1353
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:45,640
Just who do you think you are?

1354
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,880
You can't go around controlling people's lives like that!

1355
01:26:50,490 --> 01:27:00,580
 Bill, when Lucky's mother died, that boy was lost.

1356
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:04,460
I swore to him that I would find him a home.

1357
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,700
I felt I owed him that much.

1358
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,100
 No!

1359
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:11,340
You're playing God with people's lives.

1360
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,220
This is not the Red Sox.

1361

We're not players you can just trade around.

1362
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:19,070
 If I had come to you four months ago

1363
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:21,080
and asked you to take him in, would you have done it?

1364
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,680
Of course not.

1365
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,870
You needed time.

1366
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:28,550
You both needed time.

1367
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:31,200
Coaching those kids gave you that time.

1368
01:27:36,191 --> 01:27:37,090
 You had no right.

1369
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:45,190
 Maybe not, but I did it, and I can't change it now.

1370
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:50,780
 Redemption, Bill.

1371
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,022
We all want redemption.

A chance to set things right.

01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,620
To restore some semblance of order.

1374
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:11,930
We both have a chance to do that now.

1375

[GENTLE, LILTING MUSIC PLAYING]

1377
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:33,190
 You know, Bill, God inhabits the bitter

1378

and the sweet in life.

01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,580

what it meant until that day.
