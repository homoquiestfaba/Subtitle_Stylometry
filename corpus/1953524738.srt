1
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,198
<i>The truth is, on Wall Street</i>

2
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,503
<i>a lot of people just weren't
very good at their jobs.</i>

3
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:40,472
<i>It started out 16 months
ago as a mortgage crisis</i>

4
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,809
<i>and it slowly evolved
into a credit crisis.</i>

5
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,477
<i>We ask about the taxpayers
being on the hook,</i>

6
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,545
<i>guess what?</i>

7
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:52,751
an unusual step for a lame duck
president, but the country...

8
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,521
<i>Trying to be free
market advocate</i>

9
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:58,757
<i>when it's really an
"anything goes" mentality.</i>

10
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,492
<i>On Friday, Congress
finally passed</i>

11
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,095
<i>and President Bush
signed into law...</i>

12
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:04,496
<i>Begin to restore
strength and stability</i>

13
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:10,169
<i>will buy out Wall Street's
bad investments.</i>

14
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,671
<i>A full-blown
financial storm.</i>

15
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:16,575
<i>In just 6 months, 3 of the 5
biggest independent firms</i>

16
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,644
<i>on Wall Street have
now disappeared.</i>

17
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,779
<i>numbers are staggering
they don't begin to explain</i>

18
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,514
the greed and incompetence

19
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:24,516
that created this mess.

20
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:28,153
<i>No regulation, no
supervision, no discipline.</i>

21
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,689
Terrible debt that was
gnified by reckless borrowing

22
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,658
and complex securities.

23
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,726
<i>The idea that you could
lend money to someone</i>

24
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:38,530
who could not pay it back is not
an inherently attractive idea.

25
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,532
<i>I don't know why this
company's coming to Congress.</i>

26
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,634
<i>However it seemed to fly
with people who were making</i>

27
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,136
<i>$10 million a year.</i>

28
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:45,270
<i>They think they can take
that money</i>

29
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,538
<i>and do whatever
they wanna do.</i>

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,340
<i>They decide to punish
the country.</i>

31
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:52,644
<i>Neel Kashkari, the man
in charge of the bailout.</i>

32
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,713
We're supposed to be with the
smartest investors in the
world

33
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,682
and they did it themselves.

34
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,651
<i>I would call it criminal
neglect and incompetence.</i>

35
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:03,822
<i>They're certainly
not worth it.</i>

36
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:07,326
<i>Instead of helping consumers
with mortgages and loans.</i>

37
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,560
<i>People at the top of these
firms chose to look away,</i>

38
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,829
<i>to take more risk
to enrich themselves</i>

39
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,899
<i>and it is truly a crime.</i>

40
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,674
What's our risk?

41
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,309
12 billion.

42
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,845
But we have a real
situation here,

43
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,780
our clients are
about to jump ship.

44
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:32,184
The problem is saving this
company, not the clients.

45
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,685
This company!

46
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,187
We shifted 4 billion
into deposits,

47
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,688
which leaves us with 8.

48
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,692
But that move only buys us
a few more weeks, at best.

49
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,594
I talked to Meryl, they said
they'd ensure the paper

50
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,696
for two weeks but they want
200 million to do it.

51
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,399
Two weeks is nothing, we need
two months at least.

52
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,669
No, it's time for triage.

53
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,337
It's time to dump the
certificates on the market,

54
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:52,905
all of them.

55
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,340
What about the pension
fund investors?

56
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,209
We're talking over
15 billion.

57
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,344
But if other houses
follow suit,

58
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:04,750
Our priority is saving this
house and fuck all the others!

59
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,885
Our responsibility begins
and ends with our partners

60
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,820
and our shareholders
and that's it.

61
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,789
Investors gamble, they lose,

62
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,624
that's the risk that
they agreed to take.

63
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:17,763
why should they complain when
they lose money on the market?

64
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,631
Shit happens, now dump it!

65
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,633
Dump it all
right fucking now!

66
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,369
Even after we dump the stocks
we're still far too exposed

67
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,771
and we've got
no parachute here.

68
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:27,839
I'm gonna take care of that.

69
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,719
Charlotte?

70
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,289
with the secretary of treasury?

71
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:44,723
Will do.

72
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,657
Today.

73
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,792
Understood sir, today.

74
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,760
Thanks.

75
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,704
You heard Stancroft,

76
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,739
the entire company's
in jeopardy.

77
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,407
Yeah, with 51 million
in his pocket...

78
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,676
and you know as well as
I do, this is bullshit.

79
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,478
This is Stancroft and his
fucking pissing contest

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,679
with his goddamn pluggers.

81
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:11,016
but we don't really
have a choice, do we?

82
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:14,753
All right people, listen up!

83
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,788
All right, I've got some
great news for you guys.

84
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,690
In the next three days
we are gonna increase

85
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,959
your incentives by 3 percent.

86
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,428
But I need you to get on
the horn and get all
your top clients

87
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,831
and really push the real
estate growth superfund.

88
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,733
As well, you will be receiving
a memo

89
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,968
in the next couple minutes
detailing all the products

90
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,703
that we need you guys
to unload.

91
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,773
Whoever sells the most
gets the largest bonus.

92
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,708
All right, let's go people!

93
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,976
Move it!

94
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:38,777
Get those numbers!

95
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,745
Sell, sell!

96
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,812
Hey girl.

97
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,882
Hey boy.

98
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,439
The good news,
as we can see here,

99
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,774
is that the tumors
are completely gone.

100
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,043
That's the good news.

101
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,547
Not bad news, just simply
less than good news.

102
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,917
which is why we're seeing a
recurrence of your symptoms.

103
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,418
But you got everything,
right?

104
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,419
Yes, we see this
on occasion.

105
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,587
Even though the tumors
are gone,

106
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,791
as it were as though
the tumor were still there.

107
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:03,562
Hormone injections once a
week, that's the first thing.

108
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,963
It's a tricky balancing act,

109
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:05,931
we'll have to monitor
your levels

110
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,999
until we find the right mix.

111
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,536
Also, your blood sugar level
has sky rocketed.

112
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,605
Again, as a result of the
gland's reaction to the tumor,

113
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,407
so we'll have to treat
you for diabetes.

114
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,942
But she's going to be
all right?

115
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,411
Oh yes, we just have a bit
more ways to get you there,

116
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,413
that's all.

117
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:24,950
What about, um... we were...

118
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:25,951
We were planning on
getting pregnant

119
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,887
before the diagnosis.

120
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,822
At this particular time, it
would be an extremely

121
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,558
high-risk pregnancy, both
for you and the baby.

122
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,829
but once we get you
to acceptable levels
with treatment,

123
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:43,869
which lowers the risk,
then by all means yes.

124
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,904
There's a new gene therapy
that certain patients

125
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,105
have responded well to,

126
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,907
which could get us
to normalcy faster.

127
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,475
It's a little on the
experimental side,

128
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,910
Sign us up, doc.

129
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:52,577
Yeah.

130
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,912
Excellent!

131
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:58,016
I know it's difficult but try
hard to relax and not to worry,

132
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,985
it only adds stress to
your system. Okay?

133
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,586
Thank you.

134
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,454
Thanks doc.

135
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,523
You're welcome.

136
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,026
It seems as if your coverage
cap limit has been reached.

137
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,861
Coverage cap limit,
what's that?

138
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,496
It's standard among
many insurers,

139
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,864
you really should call them.

140
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,535
But regarding today,
we'll need payment

141
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:21,873
Oh, okay... well we can
call in later to
reschedule, we'll talk.

142
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,542
No, no, no... fine, we'll
uh... we'll use the card.

143
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,910
I'm sure it's some
kind of mistake.

144
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,945
If I can get my wallet
out of my pocket...

145
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,947
there you go.

146
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,015
There.

147
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,918
Are you sure you wanna use
the card?

148
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,686
Am I sure?

149
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,487
Not really.

150
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,891
Just call them.

151
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,494
So, should we keep
next Tuesday then?

152
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:45,697
Yeah, why don't you just
call in and we can...

153
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,898
Okay. Thank you!

154
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,499
Thanks.

155
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:47,899
Thank you!

156
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,634
Bye.

157
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,937
Thanks.

158
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,005
Coverage cap?

159
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,915
This is the first time it's
ever been mentioned to me.

160
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,984
Now listen, I'm on the
phone to you guys

161
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,686
at least a hundred
times this year...

162
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,187
someone should've
said something.

163
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,989
Sir, it's clearly
stated in the...

164
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,991
I've been buried in a metric
ton of paperwork from you guys

165
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:17,195
Now, I can't be expected to
catch every line of fine print

166
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,230
from every letter.

167
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:19,931
I work 6, 7 days a week.

168
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:20,932
It's company policy, sir...

169
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,200
I get that it's
company policy

170
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,969
but that's got nothing to do...

171
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,004
I'm sorry, there's
nothing more we can do
for you at this point.

172
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,038
So what you're saying
is go fuck yourself,

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,039
have a nice day.

174
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,142
I sincerely doubt you're
at all apologetic.

175
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,144
You're not supposed to be,
right?

176
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,114
Mr. Baxford, I'm very sorry.

177
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,036
Sorry.

178
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,971
Oh, baby...

179
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,707
Jim, it's just... it's useless.

180
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,242
Don't say that.

181
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,245
It is, I mean, I'm just...

182
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,014
I'm stuck here and I can't work

183
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,984
and I'm sick all the time, and
you've been working so hard...

184
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,720
I'm working for us.

185
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,990
Jim, I read the invoice
and hormone treatments,

186
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:22,994
they cost $300 a shot.

187
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,629
That's on top of all
the other medication

188
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,766
and then the gene therapy,
they could be anywhere from

189
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:30,101
50,000 to 70,000,

190
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,169
and if the insurance
doesn't cover it...

191
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:35,273
I'm not, I can't let you spend
our whole life savings.

192
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,776
Stop, stop! Stop.

193
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,611
Listen to me, we need
the treatments,

194
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,046
you need to get well.

195
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,014
Once we get well we
can have our baby

196
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:47,085
and live the life we
wanna live, okay?

197
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,629
Okay, good night.

198
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:01,700
Good night.

199
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,086
Hey girl.

200
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,155
Hey boy.

201
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,732
What's it look like
I'm doing?

202
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:37,068
Hey... we're not supposed
to get pregnant yet.

203
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,138
We can practice.

204
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,272
Yeah...

205
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:45,143
Yeah?

206
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,916
Jim, I love you so much.

207
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,107
Dude, that sucks!

208
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,742
There's an actual coverage cap
on the insurance,

209
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,111
that means that there's
really literally like,

210
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,913
a limit to how much you
can spend on Rosie

211
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,381
per month for her medical?

212
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:27,886
it says if you get too sick
and it's too expensive,

213
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,154
they stop fucking paying.

214
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:32,257
I was planning on having
by the time I was 60.

215
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,125
I guess if I get sick I'd
be better off swallowing

216
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,261
my own gun.

217
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,430
Rosie's worried out
of her fucking mind.

218
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,231
So what are you gonna do?

219
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,133
I got some money tucked away,
army disability,

220
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,735
stuff like that.

221
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,136
I'll call my broker.

222
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,871
I hear the market's
shit right now man,

223
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,406
what are you invested in?

224
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,475
Structured notes,
whatever's safest.

225
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,477
Fuck, I hope so bro.

226
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:57,215
I'll call in the lunch.

227
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,830
Fuck.

228
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,167
I'm not making enough.

229
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,236
What up you lazy bastards?

230
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,904
What'd you do,
just roll out of bed?

231
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:20,772
It's Jim Baxford.

232
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,173
No, no... second shift.

233
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,775
Lunch for you,
breakfast for us.

234
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,177
Just sit down and shut up,
we already ordered for you.

235
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:31,249
Tom gets the cheeseburger,
Jim... chili.

236
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,785
Cold chili, and he's always
surprised, you know?

237
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:34,953
But he always finishes.

238
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,256
Give me a couple of
days, call the office.

239
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,193
Oh uh, what's going on with
my funds?

240
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,928
<i>Uh... Jim, look I
really gotta...</i>

241
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,498
<i>I'm in a... I'll talk to
you in a couple days...</i>

242
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,268
Hello?

243
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,839
That's what he meant, that's
what he was thinking about.

244
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,308
Fucking hell.

245
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,277
Hey man.

246
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,011
Fucking asshole.

247
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:04,015
My broker, phone
keeps dropping out.

248
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,284
Everybody's cheesed
about their broker these days.

249
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,821
Frank and me just learned
that we have lost 20 percent

250
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,422
of our pension.

251
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,359
Gone, like watery piss
in the wind.

252
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:18,229
I don't know, bad investments
on the part of idiots like us.

253
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,298
to some of those
administration meetings.

254
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,033
Those meetings are bullshit!

255
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,868
Our administrators only
do what's good for them,

256
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,504
no matter how many people go
to those goddamn meetings,

257
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,542
they should call it
collective ball scratching.

258
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,977
You know what me and Freddy
do with our day?

259
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,247
We bust homeless people for
sleeping in the park, or uh...

260
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,017
we bust some stupid
shmuck for jaywalking,

261
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,552
but the real fucking criminals,

262
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,254
they're downtown
on Wall Street,

263
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:47,325
wearing suits that cost more
than any of us make in a year.

264
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,994
And those mother fuckers steal
more money than any asshole

265
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,330
on Riker's Island
ever dreamed of stealing,

266
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,898
and if they get caught,
which they won't get caught,

267
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,367
but if they did they'd
get an ankle bracelet

268
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,069
and put under house arrest.

269
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,305
In their mansions where
the hookers come to you.

270
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,873
Yeah and they spend
the night.

271
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,374
Well the expensive
kind of hookers

272
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,876
that you want to
spend the night,

273
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,277
Wall Street hookers.

274
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,046
Wall Street... pow, pow!

275
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,582
Fuck those guys you know
what I mean, fuck them.

276
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,917
Yeah, you guys are doing a
real good job of cheering

277
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,285
my buddy up over here.

278
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,620
Oh, we're just talking shit,
Jim.

279
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:18,089
I'm sure you'll be all right.

280
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,358
Hey fellas, the usual?

281
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,926
I didn't order fries,
that's his.

282
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,895
All around.

283
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:24,462
Beef for you.

284
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,897
Where's my chili?

285
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:26,431
It's coming!

286
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,565
My fucking chili.

287
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,368
Make sure it's warm.

288
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,402
It's freezing cold.

289
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,570
Great.

290
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,038
I don't know why we come here,

291
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,307
the food sucks.

292
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,308
But the site's good.

293
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,309
At least it's warm.

294
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,178
That's true.

295
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,115
How's Rosie doing, Jim?

296
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,316
She's hanging in there.

297
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,951
It's been a tough year,
you know?

298
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:47,652
She's a fighter.

299
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:48,920
Give her our best.

300
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,054
Yeah.

301
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,323
She's a trooper that one,
Rosie.

302
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,391
She's a good girl.

303
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,627
How's your wife?

304
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,594
Great.

305
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,630
She's cheating on me.

306
00:14:58,632 --> 00:14:59,464
What?

307
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:05,670
If you guys need anything else,
just give me a holler.

308
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,338
What happened?

309
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,441
I'm a cop, I got married,
it's inevitable.

310
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,542
It is.

311
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,478
How did you find out?

312
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,147
I read her text messages.

313
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,082
Erotic reading,
let me tell you.

314
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,150
Well what are you gonna do?

315
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:24,622
whoever he is, or to thank him
from the bottom of my heart

316
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,492
for keeping her occupied
and off my back.

317
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,394
It's a real conundrum here.

318
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,396
Now, can we just talk
about something else, huh?

319
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,364
Talk about his girlfriend.

320
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,033
Who, yours?

321
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:39,470
I heard on the news and
they were talking about

322
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,572
who you'd wanna have
sex with, right?

323
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:46,978
A., your wife or B., before
he could even answer,

324
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,712
she could... blah!

325
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,114
I fucked it up.

326
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,455
Husband and wife are
laying in bed...

327
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,391
the wife says to the husband,
"listen, when I die

328
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:04,429
would you get another
woman in my bed?"

329
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,198
He says, "uh... yeah."

330
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,402
She says "uh, well
will you marry her?",

331
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,472
he says "well, maybe".

332
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,476
She says, "will you let
her use my golf clubs?",

333
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,477
he says "no!

334
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,545
She's left handed".

335
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,415
You guys wonder why
you're divorced,

336
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,218
Hey, you know you
did it right Jim,

337
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,520
you didn't marry a cop's wife.

338
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:33,057
You married a girl
you actually love.

339
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,492
Yeah, I hear that.

340
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,695
She's a keeper that Rosie,
for sure.

341
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,031
Cheers to you guys.

342
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:40,631
Cheers.

343
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:44,035
Jim and Rosie.

344
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,440
<i>Simon Johnson, could you
highlight for our viewers</i>

345
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:53,478
<i>the plutocratic capturing of
American politics?</i>

346
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,214
<i>Well there are several

firm that also has Dan Quayle

353
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,470
Allan Greenspan, head
of the Federal Reserve

354
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,605
leaves to become
a consultant...

355
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,541
Hey girl.

356
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,542
Hey boy.

357
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,610
How you feeling?

358
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,479
A little better.

359
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,548
Good.

360
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,484
Mostly responsible for
deregulating financial
derivatives

361
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,487
<i>and then proceeds to make
millions of dollars</i>

362
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,490
<i>in hedge funds that invest in
those very same derivatives</i>

363
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,292
<i>that he deregulated.</i>

364
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,494
<i>Henry Paulson, CEO
of Goldman Sachs</i>

365
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,696
<i>leaves Goldman Sachs to join
the Bush government</i>

366
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,533
<i>as secretary of treasury
with a 50 million dollar...</i>

367
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,501
I have a treatment
tomorrow, can you make it?

368
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,769
Absolutely.

369
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,172
And about the payment,
uh...

370
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,506
Babe, we gotta use
the cards

371
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,141
until we can get
this thing fixed.

372
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,277
Jim, they just raised the
interest rate on the cards

373
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,511
and I've already put some
bills on there, so...

374
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,612
Babe, it's all right.

375
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:05,516
Well it's just you've been
working so hard lately, and...

376
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,285
I know, I know... what
choice do we have?

377
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,586
I'm doing this for us.

378
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,854
Okay.

379
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,622
You coming to bed?

380
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,157
In a minute.

381
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,559
All right.

382
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:18,262
<i>Chris Dodd, chairman of
the banking committee in
the Senate,</i>

383
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,199
<i>collected 13 million
in campaign funds.</i>

384
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,635
<i>Apparently...</i>

385
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,705
Ahh... ahh!

386
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,742
Ouch... All right,
see you next week.

387
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,811
Let's get outta here.

388
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,641
Jim...

389
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,777
What the hell's going on?

390
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:44,649
but your note's been
d-listed from the exchange.

391
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,652
D-listed, what does
that mean?

392
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,254
There's an investigation
going on right now.

393
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,690
Into what?

394
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:57,895
An investigation into
some investment portfolios.

395
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,897
It looks like a significant
portion of your fund

396
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:05,803
was diverted into paper that
is, well... a little suspect.

397
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,639
Meaning, you don't know...

398
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,640
No, no I don't.

399
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,908
No one knows right now.

400
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,643
You're my broker,
it's what you do.

401
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:16,414
How could you put my money
into anything suspicious?

402
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:23,721
I only invest in clean
deals but it seems the firm
itself is behind all this.

403
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,656
Look, I can't really tell
you anything else.

404
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,658
This thing is a legal snowball.

405
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,695
Look, we'll just have to wait
until the investigation

406
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,463
is through but it...

407
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:35,866
I mean it seems that your
investment was good

408
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,670
and as it should be but then
everything lost its value.

409
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,405
The question is did
the firm have knowledge

410
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,941
that your original investment
was bad?

411
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,344
You just said you only deal
in clean deals.

412
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,812
I do.

413
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,314
I do but I'm the player
here, okay?

414
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,849
Not the whole game.

415
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,786
You're not the only one hurting
because of this.

416
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,990
the investments of a lot
of unfortunate people...

417
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:03,027
Unfortunate?!

418
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,762
Unfortunate people?

419
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,697
You told me, you promised me

420
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,700
I'd make 8 to 10 percent of
my investment, guaranteed.

421
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,703
Yeah, and that is what
my firm told me.

422
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,740
Look, I... I searched it
out, I did my research,

423
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:22,313
my office manager told me to
put my clients into this.

424
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:25,716
What else did you put
the money in to?

425
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,352
Notes backed by
commercial real estate.

426
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,489
I mean look, these looked
like great buildings...

427
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,824
I checked the specs,
I did the research,

428
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:37,028
they looked like they'd
be at full capacity, okay?

429
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,331
Did you, did you inspect
these buildings?

430
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,833
Did you inspect these
properties?

431
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,002
The people that do all
the research told me

432
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,872
that this was the real deal.

433
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:50,508
So what do we do now?

434
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,378
We'll get some information
regarding the investigation

435
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,749
and... look, I'm telling you
it's gonna take a while though,

436
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,351
before this whole
thing is clear.

437
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,920
You're telling me I've lost
all my money.

438
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,755
No, not necessarily.

439
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,758
There's gonna be some
large lawsuits.

440
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,062
I just want my money back.

441
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:13,798
Jim, that's not how
investment works.

442
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,568
I mean, you gotta pay
to play.

443
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,836
This is not a fucking
game to me,

444
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,772
this is my fucking life
savings to me, you fuck.

445
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,774
Look, I understand.

446
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,376
Hey, I feel your pain,
I do.

447
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:27,912
I lost a lot of money too.

448
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:30,414
But that's how investment
works, man.

449
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,916
I'm sorry.

450
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:34,985
It gives and it takes away.

451
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,833
Yeah, how are we doing
with these sales?

452
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:49,867
We're at 20 percent.

453
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:54,939
I totally agree but the
price is falling.

454
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,541
Oh, Jesus.

455
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,076
The price is falling
to where, nothing?

456
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,847
but our clients are starting
to question our credibility.

457
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,982
Well that's good, some
things never change.

458
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,619
All right, you keep
me posted.

459
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,002
Rosie?

460
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:28,906
Sorry I'm late, I had to cover
for one of the guys at work.

461
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:29,840
Everything okay?

462
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,842
Yeah, it's fine.

463
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,444
You know you can tell me,
you know.

464
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:36,514
I know.

465
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,152
The bank called.

466
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:42,052
They did?

467
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,454
What'd they say?

468
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:44,855
I don't know, the machine
picked it up.

469
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:47,057
The message said they
needed you to call

470
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,660
or get down there
as soon as possible.

471
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:52,129
Our mortgage, our interest
rate, something like that.

472
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,597
I mean, I was gonna call...

473
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,467
I'll take care of the bank.

474
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,469
I'll call them tomorrow.

475
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:01,472
And there's this.

476
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,942
It's from my broker.

477
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,979
Jim... what's going on?

478
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,614
Baby, nothing's going on.

479
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,149
Please, you gotta
stop worrying.

480
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:15,653
Let me take care of the
small stuff, all right?

481
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,521
You need to get well.

482
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:22,893
Okay, I'm gonna go draw
a bath, play some music,

483
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,028
light some candles.

484
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,029
Light some candles?

485
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:27,164
Yeah, you should join me.

486
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:27,898
All right.

487
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,601
Okay.

488
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,248
Jim, I don't know
what to tell you.

489
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,919
You're the one who said put my
money in bullshit real estate.

490
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,522
It says right here that I am now
liable for another 60 grand.

491
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:52,923
Are you out of your fucking
mind?

492
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,992
Jim, I told you, no one saw
this coming.

493
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,694
I'm gonna sue you.

494
00:24:56,696 --> 00:25:01,665
Okay just calm down, we'll get
to the bottom of this.

495
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,968
I need you to cover me
for a couple days.

496
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:04,935
<i>No worries, man.</i>

497
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,003
<i>More problems?</i>

498
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:06,704
Yeah, something's come up.

499
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,273
No she's fine, I've gotta
take care of a few things.

500
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,074
Okay, take care buddy.

501
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,810
All right.

502
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,237
So you invested and you lost,

503
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,973
now they want more money
to cover expenses and losses.

504
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,608
I'll file a lawsuit, simple.

505
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,243
So I won't have to pay
the 60 grand?

506
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:49,146
I'll make sure you don't have
to pay the 60,000

507
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,048
or any of the interest they're
laying on top of that,

508
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,018
but... your original
investment,

509
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,287
you'll have to talk to
the ADA about that.

510
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:00,991
I think... your ma would
join that case.

511
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:04,061
Better fucking bet your life
I will.

512
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,997
Now then, I work on
a retainer basis

513
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,999
so I'll need 10 thousand
dollars in advance

514
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,267
to file a civil complaint.

515
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,303
10 grand, I ain't got
10 grand.

516
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:16,574
No problem, lots of lawyers
work for cheap.

517
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,178
Look Jim, I'm not dealing
with your investment.

518
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,013
It looks like there
has been a crime,

519
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,782
and the DA's office is
dealing with that.

520
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,784
Now if this is true, I'd
be happy to assist you

521
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,686
if you decide to
sue for damages.

522
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:32,089
But we have to start by
filing this complaint

523
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:36,126
for injunctive relief to protect
you from the 60,000 demand

524
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,062
and the interest it's going
to accumulate.

525
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:43,200
I'm sorry Jim, but I'm
looking at over 40 hours
of work on your case.

526
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,668
Come back when you've
got the 10 grand,

527
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,236
that's my minimum.

528
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,038
You can borrow the money
or get a credit card

529
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,375
but that's the best I can do.

530
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:53,210
Somewhat ironically
I'm like investing.

531
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:58,649
With attorneys, you
usually get what you pay for.

532
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,051
I'll see what I can do.

533
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,087
Call me!

534
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:06,156
Or not...

535
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,163
You all right?

536
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,865
Yeah, hanging in there.

537
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:18,135
Hey, is that back door supposed
to be open?

538
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,703
How you been man?

539
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:20,804
Hey, what's up man?

540
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,839
Any hold up today?

541
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:29,079
Same old shit, different day.

542
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,281
they expect you to
pay 60 grand now?

543
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,718
It's happening all over, I lost
18,000 in a mutual fund,

544
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
college money for my son.

545
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:39,089
Yeah, my folks lost
their nest egg.

546
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,758
I'm fucked.

547
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,293
Why, you don't have $60,000?

548
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,762
What do you fucking think?

549
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:48,132
You got family you
could borrow from?

550
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,366
Not an option.

551
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:52,369
but I could scratch
up a few bucks.

552
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,138
Yeah, we could take up a
collection with the guys.

553
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,106
Guys, guys...

554
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,909
I'm just gonna
refuse to pay it.

555
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:01,211
We gotta get to the job.

556
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,246
Lunch is on me, all right?

557
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:05,115
Allow me.

558
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:08,118
Thanks guys, I
appreciate it.

559
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,187
Look, hang in there.

560
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,121
It can only get better.

561
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:14,124
Yeah.

562
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,159
Change?

563
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,293
It's for you, sweetie.

564
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,162
Thanks.

565
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:21,932
Later.

566
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:31,308
Jim... I got uh... 10 grand
I can loan you.

567
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,811
Please Jim, listen to me
man.

568
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,179
Sean, forget about it.

569
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:38,949
Look, I don't have a girlfriend,
I don't have a family,

570
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:43,287
I don't have anything...
okay?

571
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,423
Please, let me help you out,
it would mean a lot to me.

572
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:52,162
I might take you up on that,
pay this lawyer.

573
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:56,233
Just hang in there.

574
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,855
It's called an adjustable rate
for a reason,

575
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,389
when the housing
market changes...

576
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,792
so do the interest rates,
that's how that works.

577
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:24,194
Listen, uh... my premiums have
doubled in the blink of an eye,

578
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:26,196
I'm not gonna be able to
keep up at this rate.

579
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,198
Yeah, you got a favourable
deal when you signed.

580
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,267
The terms of which was that
a specified point in time

581
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,804
the interest rate would
reflect the market.

582
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:35,205
Can we refinance?

583
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:39,810
Well your net worth has
taken a significant hit

584
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:41,812
over the last few
days and your wife,

585
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:45,215
she hasn't worked for
a year or so, right?

586
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,950
Yeah, she got sick.

587
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:53,257
But in light of all of that,
refinancing wouldn't be prudent

588
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,225
for our bank at this time.

589
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,226
So you're shafting me?

590
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,528
No, no... it's not me,

591
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,530
it's the guidelines
handed down from above.

592
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:02,299
If it were up to me, I would
help you out.

593
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,268
Uh, you could always try to
sell your house.

594
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,502
I can't sell my house
is this market.

595
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:08,372
I'm sorry, I don't know
what else to tell you.

596
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,841
You could declare bankruptcy,
a lot of people do that.

597
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,043
Fuck you.

598
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,113
That's a fair response,
I suppose.

599
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,327
Hey!

600
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,061
Hey.

601
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,329
You at the bank?

602
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,330
Yeah.

603
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,332
Well what was it about?

604
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,936
Like I said, don't worry
about it.

605
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:39,303
All right?

606
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,337
Mmmhmm.

607
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:44,107
Good.

608
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,337
Ahh... I knew you'd have no
problems coming up with this.

609
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,339
I got it from a friend.

610
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,342
It will and then I'll see if
I can find other investors

611
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,043
who got burned on this

612
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,312
and put together a
collective lawsuit.

613
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:23,347
Collective ball scratching.

614
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,314
What's that?

615
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:25,115
It's just a joke.

616
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,985
Not funny, I guess.

617
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,320
Don't underestimate the
power of a large group

618
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,356
when it comes to
asking for damages.

619
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,124
I hope so.

620
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:36,526
So what do I do about this
letter demanding 60 grand?

621
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,095
I'll contact the other party,

622
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:39,329
I will let them know
I am your attorney

623
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:42,332
and that you will
not be paying.

624
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:45,936
You know, there may be
another way out of this.

625
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:47,604
You take the fall on
this but it could end

626
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,673
all this drama for
you instantly.

627
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:54,111
Would you be willing to write
off your initial investment

628
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,947
and walk away if these guys
let you out of the 60,000?

629
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:59,383
It's something you
should consider.

630
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,084
It could be years before
the real estate market

631
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,386
bounces back.

632
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,087
If for some reason I can get
the court to grant

633
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,356
injunctive relief to
stop these guys,

634
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,493
years of interest on
this claim against you.

635
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,428
This motion, it's gonna
work right?

636
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,665
Most likely, but nothing
in law is for certain.

637
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,433
I'm just offering
this as an option

638
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,369
but if they're willing to let
you play ball and back off,

639
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,438
then you can put it
all behind you.

640
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,707
It'd be nice, huh?

641
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,475
Okay, don't think
about it for too long,

642
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,511
the time to act is now.

643
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:33,150
You just paid me, I can either
file the complaint as planned

644
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:36,420
or I can try and negotiate
directly with them

645
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:39,423
but I need to do one
or the other.

646
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:42,492
I need a day.

647
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,561
Half a day would be better.

648
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,396
All right, I uh...
I got a meeting

649
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,498
with the assistant
district attorney today.

650
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,399
Oh yeah, good.

651
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,201
I'll put that in the letter.

652
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,538
Thanks.

653
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,607
Let me know what happens.

654
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:46,456
I'm sure I double checked
the schedule when you called

655
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:50,193
doesn't have time in his
schedule for you today.

656
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:54,464
I'm sorry, I can leave him
a message if you'd like.

657
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:57,234
Well um, maybe you can answer
a few questions for me.

658
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,503
I'm afraid that I wouldn't
be any help with anything.

659
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:02,539
I'm not even a legal secretary,
I'm just an assistant.

660
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,742
Just the assistant,
that's your excuse?

661
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,744
Do you have any idea
what's going on here?

662
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:10,213
Have you heard of my name
at all?

663
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,481
No, I'm sorry sir.

664
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,549
No, I don't.

665
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,683
You haven't.

666
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:14,751
Myra, coffee please.

667
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,520
I need to speak to you.

668
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:17,487
Mr. Marwood!

669
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,557
Mr. Marwood is very busy.

670
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,125
Please, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

671
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,226
I need to speak to him.

672
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,595
Don't make me have
to call security.

673
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,497
I am security,
you fucking bitch.

674
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:31,668
Get your fucking hands
off me.

675
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,610
So... how did it go today?

676
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,746
The bastard didn't have time
for me.

677
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,549
You had an appointment, man.

678
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,717
Yeah.

679
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,654
You gonna be okay?

680
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,596
<i>You have reached the voicemail
of Patterson Law Group,</i>

681
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:34,564
<i>please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

682
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:38,635
These bastards, they never
answer their fucking phones.

683
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:55,619
Hey uh... about the money,
seriously...

684
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,721
don't even worry
about paying me back.

685
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:00,657
It ain't no thing but
a chicken wing, man.

686
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,858
I appreciate that.

687
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,593
I've done everything,
I went to the DA,

688
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:08,765
I went to the lawyer...
fucking banks.

689
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,600
The system's rigged
motherfucker!

690
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,670
Come on, you know that shit.

691
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:18,608
Yeah.

692
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,678
Yeah it is.

693
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:28,418
Let's go get some alcohol,
make the pain go away.

694
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,355
<i>Perhaps the best example
of how this all works</i>

695
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,890
<i>is in the AIG bailout.</i>

696
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:37,360
<i>When AIG went bankrupt...</i>

697
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,671
Listen lady, I've left him
a ton of messages, a ton.

698
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,406
He's the guy in charge
of prosecuting

699
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:50,707
the brokerage houses,
right?

700
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,375
<i>Yes, that's one of
many cases.</i>

701
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,644
Well I need to speak to him
urgently, like right now.

702
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:59,649
100 cents on the dollar was paid
to the Goldman Sachs debtors.

703
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,917
<i>When a firm goes bankrupt
you don't expect</i>

704
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,652
<i>to get a hundred percent
of those dollars</i>

705
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,988
<i>because it's a bankrupt firm,
it can't pay its debts.</i>

706
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:28,011
Thank you.

707
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,683
You can expect to get maybe 50
cents on the dollar, but no...

708
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,753
<i>the American taxpayer
pays Goldman Sachs</i>

709
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,322
<i>100 cents on the dollar
and all those...</i>

710
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:45,996
<i>were also secretary
of the treasury.</i>

711
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,002
<i>The occupy Wall
Street protests,</i>

712
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:54,471
<i>a few thousand people,
I do not understand</i>

713
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:58,708
<i>why the American people are
not up in arms about this.</i>

714
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,378
<i>These are criminal acts,</i>

715
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,449
<i>this is blatant fraud
and conflict of interest.</i>

716
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:14,024
<i>There's no government
investigation,</i>

717
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:18,795
<i>charges have been laid,
one's even looking into it!</i>

718
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,931
<i>And yet all the information
is there in the open to see.</i>

719
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:25,001
<i>These are criminals walking
in our midst.</i>

720
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,509
<i>And now the banks want
the same piece of faith</i>

721
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:33,743
that we have in our government.

722
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:36,079
<i>The banks have been
trading with ideas,</i>

723
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:39,349
they just have derivatives and
swaps that move back and forth.

724
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,384
<i>This has to stop,
this can't go on.</i>

725
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:45,789
<i>We have to underpin our
dealings with actual wealth,</i>

726
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,792
<i>not pieces of paper
that are simply ideas</i>

727
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,861
<i>from rich men.</i>

728
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:52,395
Hey baby.

729
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:53,396
Hey.

730
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,764
What are you doing here?

731
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,032
You got treatment this
morning, right?

732
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,033
I know, I cancelled it.

733
00:38:57,035 --> 00:39:01,037
Our cards, they declined
last time and the...

734
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,373
the debt people, they've
been calling the house,

735
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:06,876
so I called the bank and...

736
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:11,081
I know what's going on.

737
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,782
We're broke, aren't we?

738
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,785
We had all of our money
in that fund and it's...

739
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,888
it's gone, isn't it?

740
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,826
Jim...

741
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,394
Jim, it's okay.

742
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:28,832
I understand, you... you
were just protecting me.

743
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,401
It'll be okay.

744
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:35,805
I'm gonna get the money back,
I'm gonna fix this.

745
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,974
Oh God, this has been
so hard on you.

746
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:41,878
You're getting gray hair and
wrinkles all because of me.

747
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,849
It's gonna be all right,
you're gonna be all right.

748
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:49,119
No, I'm not.

749
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:52,822
But it's okay.

750
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:57,627
I just, I really... I wanted us
to have a baby.

751
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:00,830
You know I know that he
would look just like you

752
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,600
and I couldn't wish
for anything more.

753
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,969
Baby, don't say that.

754
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:10,840
We're gonna sell the house...

755
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,009
Jim...

756
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,496
It'll be okay, it's...

757
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:36,566
I'm calling my lawyer.

758
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,873
Uh, Jim Baxford
for Mr. Patterson.

759
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,875
<i>One moment please.</i>

760
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:49,913
I uh, I got a letter here saying
they're gonna foreclose on us

761
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:52,649
and uh, the bank's
cutting us off

762
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:54,050
all because of this
bullshit real estate.

763
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:56,152
You offered to waive
my investment

764
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,921
if I knocked off the 60 grand.

765
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:00,990
<i>but you didn't give me
an answer in time.</i>

766
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,492
<i>If I could've gotten
to them earlier...</i>

767
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:03,893
I called you back
the same fucking day.

768
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,895
<i>At the end of a long
Friday after 4 PM,</i>

769
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,964
<i>if I remember correctly.</i>

770
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,634
That means I didn't get back to
them until Monday or Tuesday,

771
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:15,905
What about this motion
you filed, the relief thing?

772
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:17,907
<i>The broker you invested
with went bankrupt</i>

773
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,909
<i>their assets were purchasd
by another company,</i>

774
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,045
<i>there's no one to file a
motion against right now</i>

775
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:24,113
<i>since the broker's in
bankruptcy you need to hire</i>

776
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:26,950
a bankruptcy attorney to lift a
thing called an automatic stay,

777
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:29,018
<i>which really is a pain
in the ass.</i>

778
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,920
What about the real estate
company, what about that?

779
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,989
<i>Well they're also under the
protection of bankruptcy court</i>

780
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,559
<i>It's part of the bankruptcy
law that says you can't take</i>

781
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,661
<i>any action against a
company in bankruptcy</i>

782
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,930
<i>without first hiring another
lawyer and getting permission</i>

783
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,932
from the bankruptcy court.

784
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,001
It's complicated!

785
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,736
Why didn't you tell me
this before?

786
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,004
Why'd I fucking hire you?

787
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,739
<i>I haven't heard from
you in 2 weeks</i>

788
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:51,975
<i>and certainly wasn't privy to
the inner financial workings</i>

789
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:57,013
<i>The bankruptcy filings were
just as much a surprise to me.</i>

790
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,748
<i>So let me give you
my best advice...</i>

791
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,050
<i>pay the 60 grand,</i>

792
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:03,219
I'll file the same injunctive
relief motion we talked about

793
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,021
<i>to try and prevent you
from having to pay</i>

794
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:09,225
<i>and I won't ask your for any
more money from you for me.</i>

795
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,960
<i>How's that sound?</i>

796
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,028
I don't have 60 grand.

797
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,563
<i>Jim, I'll get this one.</i>

798
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:15,999
<i>Call me later...</i>

799
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:19,636
This is all my fault.

800
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:23,106
No, I got sick and I put
us in debt.

801
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:26,042
It's not your fault, it's
the banks, the CEO's,

802
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:31,581
Jim, I just... I hate what
this is doing to you.

803
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,717
I'm sorry.

804
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,319
I gotta go to work.

805
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:47,063
Jim... Jim...

806
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,347
Andy, you wanted to see me?

807
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:06,049
Yeah, come on in.

808
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:12,188
Close the door please.

809
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:16,092
Jim... we've been contacted
by a couple of lawyers

810
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,796
and collection agencies in
the last couple of days...

811
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,030
it seems that you have
a lot of debts...

812
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:22,131
It's not what you think.

813
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:25,068
They've got a judgment
against you,

814
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,071
a lien to garnish your
wages on a monthly basis.

815
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,038
How much?

816
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,074
You keep 800 per month.

817
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:34,811
Right, um... let me speak
to my lawyer

818
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,080
before you give these
guys anything.

819
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:43,186
Jim, I'm sorry but we're gonna
have to let you go.

820
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:45,722
We cannot have employees that
are having financial troubles

821
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:48,191
protecting our money.

822
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:50,059
You get what I mean?

823
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,395
We're a bonded firm,
we'll lose our insurance,

824
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:54,797
we'll lose our clients...

825
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,232
we just can't have
you working here,

826
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:58,234
not under these conditions.

827
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:04,841
Think of how it looks,
and it's not good.

828
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:07,076
Severance...

829
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:10,179
What about my insurance?

830
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:12,882
You can do COBRA
on the insurance.

831
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:16,819
That's 600 a month, how
can I keep her alive on that?

832
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,224
The check is your
official severance,

833
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:23,760
but we owe you back pay,
overtime...

834
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:26,262
you put in a lot of hours and
you've been a loyal employee,

835
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:30,099
so instead of a check I had
them issue it in cash.

836
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,101
It's a bit of a bump, 9,000.

837
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:34,237
Cash is better, I figure
banks and collections

838
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:37,106
will never know,
just between us.

839
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:40,843
I appreciate that.

840
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,913
And I'm gonna need your weapon
and employee ID too.

841
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,744
Jim... hey man, listen...

842
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:17,947
I'm sorry, I didn't know!

843
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,089
<i>I can't answer the phone
right now,</i>

844
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,357
<i>just leave a message.</i>

845
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:51,093
<i>Have a good day.</i>

846
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,430
Hey Jim what's up,
it's Sean.

847
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,033
Look, I didn't know it was
gonna happen, all right?

848
00:48:57,035 --> 00:48:58,367
I'm really sorry.

849
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:02,438
I love you bro,
please give me a call.

850
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:26,696
Rosie?

851
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,744
Rosie?

852
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:48,484
Rosie?

853
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:54,223
Rosie... Baby...

854
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,562
Baby?

855
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:11,474
Oh my God, baby...

856
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:14,543
Oh my God, oh no... Rosie?

857
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,282
Rosie...

858
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,527
911...

859
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:37,800
Rosie, Rosie...

860
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:02,351
God visits us with
many mysteries in life,

861
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:06,288
unexpected death is
the most challenging.

862
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:12,228
when God leaves us speechless
in the face of death,

863
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:16,832
he reminds us all we have
is forgiveness.

864
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:21,637
We must set our anger aside
and look to those

865
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:26,575
whom we have lost,
to found a better life.

866
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:30,579
For who is God,
except the lord,

867
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:33,682
and who is a rock
besides our God?

868
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:35,584
The god who girdles
me with strength

869
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:38,687
and made my way safe.

870
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,724
He made my feet like
the feet of a deer

871
00:52:41,726 --> 00:52:44,760
and set me secure
on the heights.

872
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:47,663
He trains my hands for war

873
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,233
so that my arms can
bend a bow of bronze,

874
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:54,270
you have given me the
shield of your salvation

875
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:56,939
and your right hand
has supported me.

876
00:52:56,941 --> 00:53:01,710
Your help has made me great,
you gave me a wide place

877
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:06,282
for my steps under me
and my feet did not slip.

878
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:09,652
I pursued my enemies
and overtook them,

879
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:13,622
and did not turn back
until they were consumed.

880
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:17,259
I struck them down so that
they were not able to rise,

881
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:19,728
they fell under my feet

882
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,631
for you girdled me with
strength for the battle.

883
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:26,402
You made my assailants
sink under me,

884
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:28,704
you made my enemies
turn their backs to me

885
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:35,778
and those who hated me,
I destroyed.

886
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,411
<i>Hey, you've got
Jim and Rosie.</i>

887
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,713
<i>We're not home right now
but leave a message</i>

888
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:13,682
<i>and we'll call you right back.</i>

889
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,417
<i>Hey Jim, it's Sean.</i>

890
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,686
<i>Uh, you're not answering
your cell,</i>

891
00:54:17,688 --> 00:54:19,722
<i>are you all right?</i>

892
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:21,690
<i>I don't really know
what to say but uh,</i>

893
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:23,959
<i>I'm just thinking of you bro.</i>

894
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:26,295
<i>I hope you're okay,
I love you.</i>

895
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:29,898
<i>Please call.</i>

896
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,009
<i>Hey, you've got Jim and Rosie.</i>

897
00:54:40,011 --> 00:54:41,710
<i>We're not home right now
but leave a message</i>

898
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:44,380
<i>and we'll call you right back.</i>

899
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:46,749
<i>Hey Jim, it's Fred
and Frank.</i>

900
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:49,985
<i>Listen bud, we'd love to get
together for lunch sometime.</i>

901
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:52,788
<i>We'll come over some
night, watch the game,</i>

902
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,923
<i>do some serious drinking.</i>

903
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:58,994
<i>We miss you, pal.</i>

904
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:52,381
Well done, well done!

905
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:54,516
Thank you to my
lovely secretary

906
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,784
who's been working so hard.

907
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:05,861
I think after last week...

908
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:13,102
<i>Mr. Marwood is
extremely busy!</i>

909
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:17,806
It's lovely!

910
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:35,591
Well maybe it's time
for some of us

911
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:40,028
to stumble home.

912
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,964
Have a good weekend guys,
you deserve it!

913
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:44,833
Hello?

914
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:46,135
John, what?

915
00:56:46,137 --> 00:56:48,137
Come on John, it's too late
for that stuff.

916
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:50,439
No, I really don't wanna
talk about this right now,

917
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:52,908
can you just please call me
tomorrow morning?

918
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,844
All right, all right thank
you.

919
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:58,514
Mr. Marwood, I'm Jim Baxford.

920
00:56:58,516 --> 00:56:59,982
Yeah.

921
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:02,985
I left you a bunch of messages,
20 to be exact.

922
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:07,022
I, uh... I'm off the clock
you know, if you wanna talk...

923
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:09,925
I lost my life savings.

924
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,861
My house, my job, my wife...

925
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:16,965
Look Jim, it is not my fault
your wife left you, all right?

926
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:19,134
She didn't leave me,
she's dead.

927
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:22,004
Oh for fuck... come on man.

928
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:23,939
I'm telling you...

929
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:27,643
Just get off of me!

930

<i>in the stability of the

931
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:53,202
<i>the entire political spectrum.</i>

<i>For decades, America

933
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:57,940
<i>unprecedented economic
growth but unfortunately</i>

934
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:01,109
<i>that growth was fueled
by a mountain of debt</i>

935
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:04,246
<i>and now those bills are
starting to come due.</i>

936
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,248
<i>As the economic

00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:10,052

<i>Call this crisis by

old game...</i>

<i>the rich still get richer

941
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:20,929
Thank you everyone
and good night,

942
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:23,098
from New York News 7.

943
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,933
<i>Wow, Dan!</i>

944
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:27,703
<i>This is amazing!</i>

945
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:30,205
<i>How did you do that?</i>

946
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:32,074
<i>You know it was really easy</i>

947
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:35,544
<i>with the new mortgage
incentive rate...</i>

948
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:57,566
<i>So it looks great, we
got rid of everything.</i>

949
00:58:57,568 --> 00:59:00,569
That's great, fantastic.

950
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:02,571
And you think that's going
to be enough?

951
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:04,006
<i>Absolutely, the bank
will look great</i>

952
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:07,743
but our clients... not so much.

953
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:10,112
Okay, it's the only
play we had...

954
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:13,015
we took the shot and
it's looking good.

955
00:59:13,017 --> 00:59:14,716
Am I right?

956
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,285
<i>Yeah, you were right
all along.</i>

957
00:59:16,287 --> 00:59:18,120
Okay, well you know...

958
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:21,189
that's what I like
to hear, you know?

959
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,135
<i>They can destroy companies

00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:55,157
<i>Like many other
financial institutions,</i>

965
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:58,760
<i>Leman Brothers got caught
in this financial storm.</i>

966
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:02,164
<i>The real estate superfund,

hottest products...</i>

<i>7.7 trillion in undisclosed

01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,073
<i>We will be watching

01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:12,841
<i>there are those that believe</i>

971
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:14,376
<i>the government does
have a role to play...</i>

972
01:00:14,378 --> 01:00:16,111
<i>I want to be very clear,</i>

973
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:21,817
<i>I take full responsibility
for the decisions that I made</i>

974
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:24,786
<i>and for the actions
that I took.</i>

975

<i>JP Morgan Chase won</i>

01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:32,060
<i>The loans came with virtually
no strings attached.</i>

978
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:34,196
<i>However, eventually the
bottom dropped out sharply</i>

979
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:37,065
<i>and suddenly, leaving
investors little...</i>

980
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:43,238
The government stepped in

<i>Continue to squander
millions of dollars...</i>

982

01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:55,217
<i>We're not home right now

984
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:57,819
<i>and we'll call you right back.</i>

985
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,389
<i>Mr. Baxford, it's Walt
from the bank calling...</i>

986
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:03,091
<i>uh, we've sent you letters and
left you numerous messages</i>

987
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:05,694
<i>about your mortgage default.</i>

988
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:07,095

<i>the bank has no choice

990
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,699
<i>but to foreclose on your home.</i>

991
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:14,102
<i>If you've got any questions,
feel free to contact me.</i>

992
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:16,772
<i>We're not home right now

993
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:21,243
<i>and we'll call you right back.</i>

994
01:01:21,245 --> 01:01:24,112
<i>I'm not answering
the phone no more,</i>

995
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:28,183
<i>so stop fucking calling,
I don't wanna talk to you.</i>

996
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:39,261
Mr. Baxford.

997
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,138
James Baxford.

998
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,878
Are you James Baxford?

999
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,782
Notice of eviction
due to foreclosure.

1000
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:02,150
You like doing this,

1001
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:04,753
kicking people out
on the street?

1002
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:06,421
I'm sorry sir, but you're gonna
have to sign this document

1003
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:08,156
and pack up your things.

1004
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:11,426
You will have 48 hours
to vacate the premises.

1005
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:13,428
Sir, if you and your belongings
are not out of here

1006
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:16,264
in 48 hours, the sheriff will be
here to remove you forcibly,

1007
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:19,301
so you should sign this.

1008
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,973
Take this piece of paper
and shove it up your ass.

1009
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:29,745
That's fine Mr. Baxford, but
you've been legally served.

1010
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,398
And no loud music!

1011
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,369
And that's not working,
take the stairs.

1012
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:46,448
Speaking of work,
how's Jim?

1013
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,583
I don't know...

1014
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:52,587
I'll give him a call,
see how he's doing.

1015
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:54,656
He's been on my mind lately.

1016
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:18,546
<i>Hey Jim, we've been thinking
about you!</i>

1017
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:22,484
Here I'm gonna put you
on speaker, okay?

1018
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:24,619
Hey man, we miss you
at lunch.

1019
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:26,354
<i>Yeah, you should come
join us.</i>

1020
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:29,157
I need more time guys,
a little more time.

1021
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:31,359
Well you take all
the time you need,

1022
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:32,994
we just want you to know
we're all there for you.

1023
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,362
Yeah, don't run away from us,

1024
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:36,097
we're gonna help you
get back on your feet.

1025
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,633
I really appreciate it guys,
I'll see you soon.

1026
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:39,701
All right.

1027
01:05:39,703 --> 01:05:40,535
All right, man.

1028
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:43,672
Bye.

1029
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:52,474
These are the 2 pieces
you were asking about,

1030
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:55,777
did you bring the dollars?

1031
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,547
Looks good.

1032
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:01,049
So where'd you serve?

1033
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:02,517
10th...

1034
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,585
Keith Stack referred me.

1035
01:07:03,587 --> 01:07:05,086
Stack's a good soldier.

1036
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:05,720
Yeah.

1037
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:09,057
Don't forget your clips.

1038
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:10,525
Hey, I gotta ask you...

1039
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:11,726
Are you in any way,
shape or form

1040
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:13,528
associated with
law enforcement?

1041
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,497
I ain't no cop, I'm
just a private citizen

1042
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:17,599
concerned about his personal
safety, all right?

1043
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:20,068
Yeah...

1044
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:21,202
Grenades?

1045
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:23,738
Oh yeah, I got 2 left,
shrapnel.

1046
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,640
How much?

1047
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:30,211
I'll sell you both for
a hunsky.

1048
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:32,280
For personal protection?

1049
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:33,681
For fun.

1050
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,550
Grenades are fun!

1051
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,820
You take it easy.

1052
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,650
Hey asshole!

1053
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,762
the vice president of a
well-known brokerage firm

1054
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:03,631
<i>was gunned down
while walking to his car.</i>

1055
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:05,733
<i>The killing appears to
have been targeted,</i>

1056
01:10:05,735 --> 01:10:08,436
<i>our correspondent is on
the scene with an update.</i>

1057
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:10,805
<i>Thank you, this is a
developing story, uh...</i>

1058
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:12,974
<i>there are no suspects
at this time,</i>

1059
01:10:12,976 --> 01:10:15,777
<i>however it is believed the
victim may have been targeted</i>

1060
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:18,646
<i>because of his involvement
in the financial sector.</i>

1061
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:20,748
<i>Police are still looking for
clues and a spokesperson</i>

1062
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,684
<i>for them released a statement
earlier today saying</i>

1063
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:24,819
<i>they're treating this as...</i>

1064
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:36,331
A majority of American voters
now believe the United States

1065
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:39,667
<i>could experience a total
economic collapse.</i>

1066
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:42,403
<i>Various types of loans
became available to consumer</i>

1067
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,672
<i>who happily assumed
an unprecedented debt.</i>

1068
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:47,709
<i>...The latest Wall Street firm
to receive federal money</i>

1069
01:10:47,711 --> 01:10:52,280
<i>It's about morality, we
can't let these guys win,</i>

1070
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:53,715
and also we want our money back

1071
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:55,283
<i>from the United
States government.</i>

1072
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:56,718
<i>They gave the banks bailouts,</i>

1073
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,820
<i>we want our bailouts.</i>

1074
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:03,691
The law firm Leman Brothers
currently in bankruptcy

1075
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:05,693
billed over 850 million
in legal fees,

1076
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:08,830
in addition for billing in
massage and lobster dinners.

1077
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:11,733
<i>Around 20 lawyers made
over 40 million each</i>

1078
01:11:11,735 --> 01:11:14,369
<i>before the people who actually
lost money got anything.</i>

1079
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:16,871
<i>The really amazing thing here
is that the government</i>

1080
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:19,307
<i>awarded them the contract
in the first place,</i>

1081
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:21,809
<i>without making sure
they had the capital</i>

1082
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:23,711
<i>to cover these costs.</i>

1083
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:26,581
<i>The people are angry
and rightly so.</i>

1084
01:11:59,015 --> 01:12:05,753
<i>Find out in our full report
right after the break.</i>

1085
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:09,490
<i>...This speculation drove
the value of the fund up...</i>

1086
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:49,597
Charlotte are you reading this?

1087
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:50,932
Let's get some personal
security in this office

1088
01:12:50,934 --> 01:12:52,433
for me right now!

1089
01:12:52,435 --> 01:12:55,837
Of course.

1090
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:59,807
You've gotta be kidding me.

1091
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:00,808
Hey, look at this!

1092
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:01,809
Jim!

1093
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:04,078
What up man?

1094
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,012
How you doing man?

1095
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:06,414
Dude!

1096
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:06,981
How you doing?

1097
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:08,082
Good man.

1098
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:09,550
Hey Jim, good to see you.

1099
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:10,852
How you doing, all
right?

1100
01:13:10,854 --> 01:13:11,819
Yeah, I'm good.

1101
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:13,087
Pretty good.

1102
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:15,857
Oh come on, you don't have
to do that.

1103
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:18,559
I just fucking did,
I miss you guys.

1104
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:19,894
Yeah, me too.

1105
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:20,995
Lunch hasn't been the same.

1106
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:22,096
So what's been going on?

1107
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:23,831
Not a lot, not a lot..

1108
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:26,100
you know just been hanging.

1109
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:28,136
I ain't been working.

1110
01:13:28,138 --> 01:13:31,606
It's tough you know, with
Rosie gone and shit...

1111
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:33,908
it's not good.

1112
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,943
You know, it is what it is.

1113
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:39,447
Anyway, so uh...
I'm moving.

1114
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:41,149
Moving? Where to?

1115
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:44,852
I don't know, different city,
different state.

1116
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:48,656
Everywhere I go I keep seeing
Rosie.

1117
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:49,924
It's driving me nuts.

1118
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:50,892
You get it, right?

1119
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:51,859
I get it.

1120
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:54,162
Hell, I understand.

1121
01:13:54,164 --> 01:13:57,598
I feel like doing the same
thing sometimes.

1122
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,535
No, I don't know why
the hell she won't go.

1123
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:01,669
It's a mystery to me!

1124
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:02,870
She fucking loves you.

1125
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,972
Oh yeah, she loves me.

1126
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:06,874
She loves you, she loves
everybody in the neighbourhood,

1127
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:07,875
that's the problem!

1128
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:08,910
She hasn't bailed
on him yet.

1129
01:14:08,912 --> 01:14:10,878
She loves me, right.

1130
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,882
Well you gotta tell us
where you're going, all right?

1131
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:19,220
with all these fucking
shootings, huh?

1132
01:14:19,222 --> 01:14:21,923
Yeah, it's a hell of a thing.

1133
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:24,926
The whole city's on alert,
look at that.

1134
01:14:24,928 --> 01:14:27,161
Yeah, the brass is afraid
it's gonna escalate.

1135
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:30,097
Really, they'll get him
soon enough.

1136
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:32,500
They'd better, the brass
is screaming.

1137
01:14:32,502 --> 01:14:35,670
Whoever it is really fucking
hates rich bankers,

1138
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:37,538
which only leaves
a million suspects.

1139
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,906
You know whoever
catches this guy

1140
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:40,908
is gonna get a big promotion,
my man.

1141
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,910
Well in that case,
I'll save you the trouble.

1142
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:47,081
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1143
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:50,184
It's me.

1144
01:14:53,056 --> 01:14:55,656
Okay, you had me going for
a minute there, all right?

1145
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,125
I'm serious.

1146
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,732
You'll give me a heart attack,
what's wrong with you?

1147
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:06,968
All right, who got the
Reuben?

1148
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,069
Always with the fingers,
huh?

1149
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:09,537
Sorry.

1150
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:12,073
Don't want that, I'm gonna get
an STD from this sandwich.

1151
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:15,676
You ruined it for me,
I'm serious.

1152
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,979
I'm afraid to eat this sandwich,
I'm gonna get a herpe.

1153
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:19,080
You should put a condom
on your finger,

1154
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:21,282
that's what you should do.

1155
01:15:21,284 --> 01:15:25,253
I think she's been going to
the gym, you notice that?

1156
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:34,055
My wife's ready to pop!

1157
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:36,023
I got him a membership
to our country club,

1158
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:38,025
it was like 90,000 plus.

1159
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:39,360
That is crazy.

1160
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:40,628
You're crazy.

1161
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,029
I owe you too much money.

1162
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:44,065
Hey, did you hear Stancroft...

1163
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,143
Hey Robert!

1164
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:04,245
It's Jim, Jim Baxford.

1165
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:05,279
Jim Baxford!

1166
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:07,214
Hey, it's good to see you.

1167
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:11,786
from that little financial
disaster of ours.

1168
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:14,121
Not quite, but
I'm getting there.

1169
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:16,424
Well it was a tough time man,
we all took a loss.

1170
01:18:16,426 --> 01:18:19,927
I mean, when I told my wife we
couldn't vacation in Barbados,

1171
01:18:19,929 --> 01:18:22,730
she tore a strip off me
the size of Long Island.

1172
01:18:22,732 --> 01:18:25,232
But things get better,
right?

1173
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:27,301
Right, that's what everyone
keeps telling me.

1174
01:18:27,303 --> 01:18:29,470
Trust me, it's true.

1175
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:34,141
Look, um... let me give
you my new business card,

1176
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:37,178
There we go, I've got a couple
of uh, investment ideas

1177
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,879
you might be interested in.

1178
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:40,948
I'll take you for lunch
next week, huh?

1179
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:44,151
I gotta run, it was good
to see you.

1180
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:44,885
Hey you too.

1181
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,021
Yeah, call me.

1182
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:01,168
<i>Next caller,
go ahead please.</i>

1183
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:03,237
<i>I'm glad those bankers
got shot.</i>

1184
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,207
<i>There's no effective laws
in this country anymore,</i>

1185
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:08,776
<i>you get 5 years for
robbing a gas station,</i>

1186
01:19:08,778 --> 01:19:10,945
<i>you destroy America...</i>

1187
01:19:10,947 --> 01:19:12,947
<i>you get 20 trillion
dollars and you walk away?</i>

1188
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:15,182
<i>Violence is not
the solution, Gus.</i>

1189
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:18,185
<i>Isn't violence the official
solution of our government
in Iraq,</i>

1190
01:19:18,187 --> 01:19:18,986
<i>Afghanistan?</i>

1191
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:22,189
Thanks for your comments,
Gus.

1192
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,257
<i>Next caller, who's on the
line?</i>

1193
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,925
<i>Why'd you cut Gus off?</i>

1194
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:28,329
<i>I lost my house and Wall Street
is getting a free ride...</i>

1195
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:33,801
<i>Okay, that's all
the time we have</i>

1196
01:19:33,803 --> 01:19:35,202
<i>on today's show for
call ins.</i>

1197
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:37,204
<i>Let's look at today's market,</i>

1198
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:40,274
<i>the US dollar is trading
at 1.31 against...</i>

1199
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,436
Robert here.

1200
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:11,238
Robert, it's Jim.

1201
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,373
Jim, how you doing?

1202
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:16,310
but I won 50 G in
a poker tournament.

1203
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:18,412
Fucking unbelievable.

1204
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:21,382
Anyway, I need some
advice on what to put it in.

1205
01:20:21,384 --> 01:20:24,318
Oh great, well how
about we have a coffee?

1206
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,352
<i>The place near my office?</i>

1207
01:20:25,354 --> 01:20:26,387
Yeah, same coffee shop.

1208
01:20:26,389 --> 01:20:27,855
<i>Okay.</i>

1209
01:20:27,857 --> 01:20:28,389
See you tomorrow, 9 o'clock.

1210
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:29,256
<i>Sounds great.</i>

1211
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:31,592
All right, see you then.

1212
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:40,567
Yeah but you see,
you see uh...

1213
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:42,569
8-5-6, that's gotta jump
up to 9-2-5.

1214
01:25:42,571 --> 01:25:45,606
No, no... look at the, look
at the right screen.

1215
01:25:45,608 --> 01:25:48,575
No, we gotta sell those shares
right away.

1216
01:25:48,577 --> 01:25:52,312
drop off the other side, we
need more points on that side.

1217
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,381
Shit... I'm not
the boss here...

1218
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:58,452
You have absolutely no say
in this.

1219
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,727
Please, my wife...
she's pregnant.

1220
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:14,268
Maggie, get a hold of
security now!

1221
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:15,669
Hey, what the fuck
is going on?

1222
01:26:18,874 --> 01:26:22,376
Get back to your wife and be
thankful, you prick.

1223
01:26:22,378 --> 01:26:23,744
Get the fuck outta here!

1224
01:26:23,746 --> 01:26:25,779
Go!

1225
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:42,829
Hurry, hurry run!

1226
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:44,831
Go!

1227
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:42,482
Copy that, 38th floor!

1228
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,551
38th floor!

1229
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:56,797
Police are looking into whether
or not today's shooting spree

1230
01:28:56,799 --> 01:28:59,433
has anything to do
with the recent murders.

1231
01:28:59,435 --> 01:29:02,369
Now from what we know, all
of the victims were involved

1232
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:04,805
in the brokerage scandal
but there was a question

1233
01:29:04,807 --> 01:29:07,774
whether or not the fraud
charges could be prosecuted.

1234
01:29:07,776 --> 01:29:10,844
We know that the shooter
is still in the building
at the moment.

1235
01:29:17,419 --> 01:29:21,788
Get outta here.

1236
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:23,523
Out!

1237
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:26,660
Get out!

1238
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:37,137
Whatever it is you want,
this is not the way to get it.

1239
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:42,909
Take a fucking seat,
right there.

1240
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:45,979
Sit the fuck down.

1241
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:54,421
Bet you've never seen your
desk from that angle before.

1242
01:29:54,423 --> 01:29:59,926
I don't know who you
think it is I am but...

1243
01:29:59,928 --> 01:30:02,095
this isn't gonna
accomplish anything.

1244
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:04,865
Did I tell you to speak?

1245
01:30:04,867 --> 01:30:05,932
You wanna know the difference

1246
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:07,868
between a banker
and a gangster?

1247
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:12,906
A gangster always
has a getaway plan.

1248
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:14,975
Okay...

1249
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:23,950
And by the way... I
know exactly who you are.

1250
01:30:23,952 --> 01:30:25,952
You are the guy who fucks
everyday people in the ass

1251
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:29,990
when you're not sitting in your
fucking house in the Hamptons,

1252
01:30:29,992 --> 01:30:31,925
or booking tennis lessons
from your penthouse

1253
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:34,961
overlooking Central Park.

1254
01:30:34,963 --> 01:30:36,863
How do you know all this?

1255
01:30:36,865 --> 01:30:39,933
I've been watching you.

1256
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:43,203
The problem with guys like you

1257
01:30:43,205 --> 01:30:44,871
is you can't stop bragging.

1258
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:49,176
you're making sure that every
magazine in the country

1259
01:30:49,178 --> 01:30:52,145
knows all about
your triumphs.

1260
01:30:52,147 --> 01:30:55,682
Well, you know there are people
that derive inspiration

1261
01:30:55,684 --> 01:30:57,484
from success stories.

1262
01:30:57,486 --> 01:30:59,019
You know maybe you'd do all
the same things I've done

1263
01:30:59,021 --> 01:31:00,153
given the opportunity.

1264
01:31:00,155 --> 01:31:01,688
No, I wouldn't.

1265
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:03,190
I wouldn't sell bad
loans to people

1266
01:31:03,192 --> 01:31:06,893
with small amounts of money.

1267
01:31:06,895 --> 01:31:07,928
You make yourself
real cash based

1268
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:11,932
on fabricated
nonexistent loans.

1269
01:31:11,934 --> 01:31:14,234
You cook the books to
get your bonuses,

1270
01:31:14,236 --> 01:31:16,036
that's what you fucks do.

1271
01:31:16,038 --> 01:31:20,006
But the question is,
why should I let you live?

1272
01:31:20,008 --> 01:31:25,645
You're a salesman, right?

1273
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:26,913
Sell me.

1274
01:31:26,915 --> 01:31:29,649
Sell you...

1275
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:30,917
You know that there's
not a person on this earth

1276
01:31:30,919 --> 01:31:33,954
that's worth over a
hundred million dollars

1277
01:31:33,956 --> 01:31:36,957
that came by
that money honestly?

1278
01:31:36,959 --> 01:31:40,694
The Vanderbilts, the Carnegies,
the Gettys,

1279
01:31:40,696 --> 01:31:44,531
the Morgans, the Hursts,
the Rockafellers...

1280
01:31:44,533 --> 01:31:48,935
They just annexed territories
and licenses and businesses

1281
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:50,270
and killed the native
population

1282
01:31:50,272 --> 01:31:52,539
and imported slaves
and sold guns

1283
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:54,941
to both the north and the
south during the Civil War

1284
01:31:54,943 --> 01:32:02,015
and they're heroes,
they're American heroes!

1285
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:05,151
Take 5 on 38.

1286
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:09,222
Coming down, proceeding
to locate target.

1287
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:14,294
We teach our children, what...
honesty and hard work

1288
01:32:14,296 --> 01:32:16,029
are the keys to success?

1289
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:18,298
My children... my children are
not gonna go off to some war,

1290
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,700
they're gonna go to Yale,
they're gonna go to Harvard.

1291
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:23,570
And it's gonna be the dumb,
stupid, white trash kids

1292
01:32:23,572 --> 01:32:26,006
and the black ghetto kids
that are gonna fight

1293
01:32:26,008 --> 01:32:28,975
America's senseless wars
and they're gonna protect

1294
01:32:28,977 --> 01:32:32,112
American security and business,
and it's gonna be my business.

1295
01:32:32,114 --> 01:32:36,049
richer and richer and
my bonuses are gonna
get bigger and bigger,

1296
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:40,120
and it's the same old story.
It's the bankers and the owners

1297
01:32:40,122 --> 01:32:42,122
and the advisors that get rich!

1298
01:32:42,124 --> 01:32:44,157
And it's the little people,
who buy their stock

1299
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:47,093
and always lose in the end.

1300
01:32:47,095 --> 01:32:52,732
To people like you!

1301
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:56,002
Some people don't recover,
people like me.

1302
01:32:56,004 --> 01:32:58,805
It's a free trade system,
my friend.

1303
01:32:58,807 --> 01:33:00,340
That's capitalism.

1304
01:33:00,342 --> 01:33:03,677
That's competition in
a capitalist society,

1305
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:07,814
that's how the cream
always rises to the top.

1306
01:33:07,816 --> 01:33:12,886
That's how the strong survive
and the weak die off.

1307
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:25,065
Like her?

1308
01:33:25,067 --> 01:33:26,032
That's my wife
you're looking at,

1309
01:33:26,034 --> 01:33:28,168
she's dead because of you.

1310
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:30,136
Come on... I don't give a fuck,

1311
01:33:30,138 --> 01:33:33,306
I have never seen you before
in my life.

1312
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:35,642
But you do know about the real
estate growth superfund,

1313
01:33:35,644 --> 01:33:38,078
That's where you put
your money.

1314
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:42,048
For the commissions,
for the commissions.

1315
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:44,250
That's how it works.

1316
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:48,788
You like competition?

1317
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,056
I love competition.

1318
01:33:50,058 --> 01:33:52,058
You wanna play a little
free market competition,

1319
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:53,259
just you and me?

1320
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:54,828
You and me?

1321
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:57,897
I can't wait.

1322
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:03,069
One weapon, two guys.

1323
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:05,739
Winner lives...

1324
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:18,885
On the count of 3...

1325
01:34:18,887 --> 01:34:22,956
1... 2...

1326
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,093
Well, lookie here!

1327
01:34:27,095 --> 01:34:28,294
I came out on top.

1328
01:34:28,296 --> 01:34:30,196
That's what you
don't understand,

1329
01:34:30,198 --> 01:34:33,099
What's important is that I won,

1330
01:34:33,101 --> 01:34:37,170
doesn't matter how I won,
and you're dead.

1331
01:34:38,105 --> 01:34:40,840
I cheated too.

1332
01:34:49,117 --> 01:34:52,385
Get him outta here!

1333
01:34:52,387 --> 01:34:55,855
Target located and eliminated.

1334
01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:40,226
<i>I'm still alive and free</i>

1335
01:36:40,228 --> 01:36:43,229
<i>and I promise I
will keep killing.</i>

1336
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:45,331
<i>They should all know
that I am out there,</i>

1337
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:47,300
<i>a soldier of the people...
and if the government,</i>

1338
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:51,037
<i>the prosecutors and the
judges fail on their duty,</i>

1339
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:54,107
<i>I will not fail on mine.</i>
