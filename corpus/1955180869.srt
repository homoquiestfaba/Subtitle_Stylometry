1
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,234
What have we got?

2
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,199
Male, age 10,

3
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,076
acute abdomen,

4
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,966
low blood pressure,

5
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:00,932
possible shock.

6
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,499
Looks like
a ruptured viscous.

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,699
Run the blood work.

8
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,611
Call surgery. Look, stay
in the waiting room.

9
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,409
I'll be back
to tell you how he's doing.

10
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:40,015
It's good to be able to come in
here and kneel alone.

11
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:47,932
But sometimes...

12
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,066
You need somebody

13
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:53,399
to kneel beside you.

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,166
May I?

15
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,942
Please.

16
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,532
I'm Alexander.

17
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,274
John Brighton.

18
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:11,699
It's my son, Kyle.

19
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,132
His appendix burst

20
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,366
and...

21
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:18,866
I'm. . .afraid...

22
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:20,869
of losing him.

23
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,199
Sometimes our
burdens are <i>so</i> heavy

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,432
that we can't
find the words

25
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,777
to express what's
in our hearts.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,574
Do you mind if I say
a prayer for your son?

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,876
Please.

28
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,576
You told us, Lord if there was
anything we wanted,

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,866
to come to you.

30
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,966
Well, we come to you now.

31
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,880
This is John, Lord,

32
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,599
whose heart is burdened
and heavy-laden.

33
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,600
He has a son, Kyle,
whom he loves very much

34
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:04,199
and Kyle is sick,
Kyle is deathly sick,

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,376
<i>so</i> we're asking you Lord,
to save Kyle.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,437
And we know you can do it

37
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:12,674
through the blood
that you shed for us.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,010
Heal him Lord...

39
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:17,432
and heal him now.

40
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,276
This we ask in the name

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,066
of thy son, Jesus.

42
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,944
Amen.

43
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:26,699
Well...

44
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,966
We've laid it out before him

45
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,538
like he told us.

46
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,707
The rest. . .
Is up to him.

47
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,570
Thank you.

48
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,199
Thank you <i>so</i> much,
Alexander.

49
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,374
Are you a
chaplain here?

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,539
<i>No, no.</i>

51
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:52,516
But I've
come here many times.

52
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,912
Many times but...

53
00:03:55,933 --> 00:04:00,905
I, ah. . .Won't be
coming anymore.

54
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:02,640
Not now.

55
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:05,204
What were you here
to pray about?

56
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:10,233
My wife. . .My Marjorie.

57
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:13,678
She had cancer...

58
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,046
And she passed away
this morning.

59
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,104
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:26,441
John, you are a lucky man.

61
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:30,381
Marjorie and I, we wanted to have
kids but we never did.

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,132
You have a family.

63
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:36,342
Love your family, John.

64
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:39,280
Love them
with everything you got.

65
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:46,879
And about Kyle. . .trust him.

66
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:50,511
Kyle will be all right.

67
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:55,712
Everett Wayne Anderson.

68
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:05,244
Terry Ernestine Anderson,

69
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,976
where's the camera?

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,707
I gave it
to you.

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,346
It's hanging
on your shoulder!

72
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,541
Oh, oh! I don't believe it.

73
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:23,332
If you need help locating
your sunglasses later,

74
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,266
I'd be happy
to help you look.

75
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:26,974
Thank you
very much.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,037
Kyle Alexander Brighton.

77
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,632
How are those burgers
coming, pastor?

78
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,732
Well, John, they're
sort of a burnt offering.

79
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,099
I thought Kyle
ate a lot.

80
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,732
He does, but now you've got 50
Kyles together in one place.

81
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:07,799
Reminds me of the movie
"the thing that ate Pittsburgh."

82
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,599
So anyway, this account is sitting
there

83
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,432
like this, like this big plum ready to
be picked off the tree

84
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:15,599
you know what
your old man says?

85
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,932
"I think we should stop
and think about it."

86
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,932
What is that
all about, Kyle?

87
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,913
You're majoring
in business, right?

88
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,966
That's right uncle Phil.

89
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,275
Here's your first lesson...

90
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,399
Great-- each minute Kyle
talks with my brother

91
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,006
it takes me an hour
to deprogram him.

92
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:36,707
I call it uncle Phil detox.

93
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:39,599
Listen to me. Candi and I want to
give you something that's

94
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,137
well, a little something
that's real...

95
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,599
A little going away present.

96
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,977
No, no...

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,099
C' mon Kyle, look at it as an
investment in your future.

98
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,478
Now remember, if you want
something in life

99
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,810
you got to go for it.

100
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,676
C' mon Kyle,
pull harder!

101
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,232
Ohhhh!!

102
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,804
You were right, Teri.

103
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,178
I didn't think it would
work but, sure enough!

104
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,866
Ah, you're a good kid, Kyle.

105
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,312
I like you.

106
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,732
Did you see what
Phil did to Kyle?

107
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,866
You and Phil are just
like your dad-- always...

108
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,099
Don't ever say that--
Phil's like dad, I'm not.

109
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,332
Hey, this is me remember,
the one who's on your side.

110
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,299
Why can't he be committed
to one woman and settle down?

111
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,280
Look at him, he's got
a different woman

112
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,280
every time we see him.

113
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,746
John, Phil is not
your responsibility.

114
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:34,078
Let God handle it.

115
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Ah, wait...

116
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,608
<i>I'm...</i>

117
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,966
I'm winded--
I'm never winded.

118
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:59,299
Well, you know what they say
about growing old.

119
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,166
No, what do they
say about growing old?

120
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:05,766
Actually, they don't say anything at
all.

121
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:08,299
But I do remember
you saying

122
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,099
that I'm the one
who's growing old

123
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,932
while you stay
the same age.

124
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:15,005
That's true--you're a cradle
robber. I'm going to go back.

125
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:17,099
You want me to go with you?

126
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,909
<i>No, no. No. No.</i>

127
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,332
You need
the exercise.

128
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,314
You know what they say
about middle-aged men?

129
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,332
What do they say?

130
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,466
The legs are the first to go.

131
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,003
Oh, thanks a lot.

132
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:32,032
You going to
be okay?

133
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:35,199
I'm fine-- I may lie down
a bit, but I'm fine.

134
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,544
All right. See you
in a while.

135
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,104
Oh, Kyle. . .you forgot Johnny.

136
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,113
Ma, I don't
need Johnny.

137
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:49,113
But you've always taken him.

138
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:51,132
I know, but,
keep him here.

139
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,966
I'll be home
lots of weekends,

140
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,866
don't worry, with big bags
of laundry.

141
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,574
So things won't
change that much.

142
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,170
I love you, sweetheart.

143
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,679
I love you too,
mom.

144
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,338
Don't worry.

145
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,904
I'll tell you about
what worries me.

146
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:05,674
What's that, dad?

147
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,866
Well, you letting yourself
be influenced

148
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:10,040
by your uncle Phil's <i>school</i>
of business.

149
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:11,478
Dad.

150
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,999
Now remember, living by God's
principles is not exactly

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,399
on the top of his list
of priorities.

152
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,599
Even though he's my business
partner and my brother

153
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,671
we always don't see
eye-to-eye on things.

154
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,043
Dad, don't worry.

155
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,732
I'm not as dumb
as I look.

156
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:25,337
Dad, I can see
what's going on.

157
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:26,632
Don't worry.

158
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,432
I love you son.

159
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,099
I'm proud of you.

160
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,399
I love you too, dad.

161
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,004
See you squirt!

162
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,199
I'm almost 16-- you can't
call me that anymore!

163
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,232
Okay--try not to flunk out
of <i>school</i> this year, okay?

164
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:43,147
Oh right, and how many academic
scholarships did Mr. IQ get?

165
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,669
Huh?

166
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:50,980
Now they decide
to get along.

167
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,141
Now get out of here,
will ya?

168
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,773
I love you guys.

169
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,710
Fight you for his room?

170
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,475
Don't you mean
my new study?

171
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,672
Oh!!!

172
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,066
They're right
in the palm of our hand.

173
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,299
All we have to do is
squeeze them a little bit.

174
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,599
C' mon John,
use that charm of yours.

175
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,232
Slow down
will you?

176
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:23,769
Don't use such
a big club.

177
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,245
What do you mean?

178
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:27,566
I mean, you don't have to steamroll
every deal, Phil,

179
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,774
I want you to walk a little softer
on this one.

180
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,541
Okay? For once!

181
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,466
It's the way
to do business.

182
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,066
It's the way
you do business.

183
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,199
It's not my way, not
like the Callahan deal.

184
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,232
What about
the Callahan deal?

185
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,399
You promised them the world, then
we couldn't deliver.

186
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,006
No firm could-- you
misled them, Phil.

187
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,944
Lied, really.

188
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,243
Oooo-- here <i>comes</i>
the moral police again.

189
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:50,247
Yeah, I lied! Everybody does.

190
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:52,399
If our word is
no good,

191
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,866
we can't expect their word
to be any good,

192
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,066
then nobody is committed
to the deal

193
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,066
on either side
of the table.

194
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,604
We do not approach
this deal that way.

195
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,004
Fine.

196
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,532
Would you mind knocking?

197
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:11,099
What are you wearing???

198
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,909
Stuff for school.

199
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:16,032
Well, you can just take it back to
wherever you got it.

200
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:18,966
You're not going to go out of this
house dressed like that.

201
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,732
Why not? All the girls
dress like this.

202
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,932
Well you're not going
to dress like this.

203
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,299
What do you want me to do,
wear skirts down to my ankles?

204
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,732
Just do as I tell you,
Teri-- that's enough!!

205
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,499
Look, just because your baby left
for college doesn't mean

206
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,632
you can take your
frustrations out on me.

207
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,442
I'm just doing
nothing...

208
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,499
Stop it. . .Stop it.

209
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,979
Stop it! Stop it!

210
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,343
Stop it!
Slop it!

211
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,299
Hi, honey.

212
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,370
Hi, sweetheart.

213
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,766
How was
your day?

214
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:04,166
Good, I think. We're waiting
to find out any time

215
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:06,340
about that Atlantic Petroleum
account-- we're really close.

216
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,074
Where is the mail?

217
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,080
I don't know,
maybe Teri has it.

218
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,166
Has what?

219
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,202
The mail.

220
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,999
How could I have it?
I just got home.

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,412
You're kidding. That's great!
we got the account.

222
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,066
Oh, wonderful.

223
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:19,808
Well, I found the mail.

224
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,712
It's right here where it should be--
next to the margarine?

225
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:24,566
How did it get in there?

226
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,466
Hold on a second, Phil.

227
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:28,071
Don't look at me.

228
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,666
Well, I didn't put it
in there, John?

229
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,399
Ellen, don't look at me,
it had to be you.

230
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,666
Unless the mail carrier decided to
put it in there.

231
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,566
Ellen, you're getting
nuts on us.

232
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,104
No, she put the mail
in the refrigerator.

233
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,942
Yeah, that's right--

234
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:44,914
probably trying to freeze
some of my assets.

235
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:46,932
At least what I've got.

236
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,970
Well, this is great!

237
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,535
Our next speaker was awarded
Harrison Elementary's

238
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,544
Our next speaker was awarded
Harrison Elementary's

239
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,740
teacher of the year this spring.

240
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,932
I've heard rumors she might run for
<i>school</i> board next year,

241
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,832
and I want to go
on record right now

242
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,066
and say that I will personally
campaign for

243
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:06,732
anyone who runs
against her...

244
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:09,509
Because we simply can't
lose her as a teacher.

245
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:12,776
Please welcome, Ellen Brighton.

246
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:24,047
After 6 long months
of hard work from all of us,

247
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,799
well, maybe not all of 'em.

248
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,746
I think we finally reached

249
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,872
the next plateau
with Atlantic Petroleum.

250
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,676
This time we finally struck oil!

251
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,866
Now if you'll open your
presentation...

252
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:40,732
If every teacher had someone
as supportive as Valerie,

253
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,907
this profession would be
a lot easier.

254
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,410
I'd like to...

255
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,873
I'd like to, um...

256
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,881
I'd like to talk
to you today...

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,799
I-I I must need glasses,

258
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,076
I can't...

259
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,876
I never thought
I'd need glasses.

260
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,732
Um...

261
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,066
Oh goodness...

262
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,638
I'm sorry Valerie, l...

263
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,143
Do you mind if I don't...

264
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:36,113
ls there a doctor!

265
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:31,048
Well, it isn't cancer--
that much we know for certain.

266
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,047
No sign of a brain tumor

267
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,411
that might have caused
you to collapse.

268
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,106
Oh, thank God.

269
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,566
But I'm afraid
the news isn't good.

270
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:42,566
All of our tests are
pointing in one direction.

271
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:46,674
Ellen, we believe that you have a
form of dementia.

272
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,899
It could be Alzheimer's disease.

273
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,799
<i>Why. . Aha...</i>

274
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,337
That's ridiculous.

275
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:58,066
Alzheimer's is an
old person's disease.

276
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,809
You're right.
In the vast majority of cases

277
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,835
it strikes people over 65.

278
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:06,144
But a very small minority contract
it much younger.

279
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,147
Your test results indicate

280
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,841
a 90% probability that
you have the disease.

281
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,677
But what about the other 10%?

282
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,432
Shouldn't we get
a second opinion?

283
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,632
Of course,
we want you to.

284
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:21,637
Nothing would make us happier than
to be proven wrong.

285
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,532
Look, we can
fight this.

286
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,274
Maybe they're
wrong.

287
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,075
They're not wrong.

288
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,166
Sweetheart, we'll get everyone
at church to pray.

289
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:39,966
We can face this
together.

290
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,199
Together-- what are you
talking about?

291
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,066
Pretty soon you are
going to be the one

292
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:47,332
who's going to be facing things all
by yourself

293
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,999
and I'm going to become
more isolated, more alone.

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,999
No, we won't let
that happen.

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,432
The children
and l...

296
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:54,912
No! You're not going
to tell the children.

297
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:55,809
Ellen. . . No!

298
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,835
I don't want Kyle
and Teri to know.

299
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:59,904
Why?

300
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,432
I just...

301
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:07,632
I want my life to be...

302
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:10,637
Normal for as long as possible.

303
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:15,432
Look at Teri, she doesn't even
listen to me now.

304
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:20,132
If she thinks I'm brain-dead I'll lose
her completely.

305
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:24,479
So please, promise me,
don't tell them.

306
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,566
Where have you been? I've been
paging you all afternoon.

307
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,070
We had a doctor's
appointment.

308
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,099
Again?. . .For who?

309
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,273
Are you both okay?

310
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,299
Oh, the appointment was for me.
I'm fine. Just some tests.

311
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,908
I feel fine. Sorry I stole
John from you for a while.

312
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,904
Where have you guys been?
hey uncle Phil.

313
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,466
Hey, Teri.

314
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:12,969
Can you stay for dinner?

315
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,810
No thanks. I'm just gonna talk to
John for a second.

316
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,032
So what's up?

317
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:18,512
So what's up?

318
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,032
Just the biggest deal
of our lives!!

319
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,866
Hello!? I needed to
contact you today.

320
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,966
They invented pagers
just for that purpose,

321
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,966
remember, they go
in your belt?

322
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,174
Phil, there are more important things
in life than this deal.

323
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,499
Such as?

324
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,566
I needed to be with Ellen.

325
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,547
Who were you with today?

326
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:40,038
Ah, gee. . .
clients?

327
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,809
Look, I'm sorry,

328
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,109
I'll try not to
let it happen again.

329
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,432
Want to stay for dinner?

330
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:49,832
Nah, I can't.

331
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,177
I've got a hot date.

332
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:08,670
I'm going to tell
Barbara today.

333
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,836
<i>Good .</i>

334
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:17,280
I'm glad. You need
to tell someone.

335
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:29,270
So do you.

336
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,474
How can he let
these things happen?

337
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,980
I don't know John.

338
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,278
All I know is how much I miss her
even now, my Marjorie,

339
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,179
after all these years.

340
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,775
I've spent a lot of private time
praying in these woods, John.

341
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,646
I don't know if I even know how
to pray anymore.

342
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,375
I didn't either.

343
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,566
I agonized and struggled--
I fought.

344
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:23,639
But the one thing I discovered that I
couldn't do

345
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:26,477
was hold on to her.

346
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,711
I had to let go--
in my mind.

347
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:36,478
I built an altar, right here.

348
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,966
And on it I laid
the one I loved

349
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:44,176
more than anything
in all the world.

350
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,613
I gave her up to him.

351
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:51,966
It's all right if we wrestle with God
on some things,

352
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:56,967
but remember. . .
we can trust his hand,

353
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:01,566
even if we don't
understand his plan.

354
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:06,567
When all is said and done,
we have to trust in him,

355
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:11,712
even though our questions
are not answered.

356
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,332
Now I've gone over the figures and
everything looks fine,

357
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,038
but what we need are the results
of that land survey.

358
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,599
But what we need are the results
of that land survey.

359
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,979
Do you know anything
about it John?

360
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,266
John?

361
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:36,373
I'm sorry, what did you say?

362
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,381
Yes, Alex, I'll take distracted
executives for $300.

363
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,380
He at important meetings seems

364
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,903
frequently pre-occupied and
inattentive.

365
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,732
Who is John Brighton?

366
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,041
That' s correct!

367
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,432
Brighton associates is
now in double jeopardy.

368
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:53,332
All right. All right.
let's keep going.

369
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,666
"William pulled out the canteen and
took a long drink.

370
00:21:56,667 --> 00:22:00,432
The water felt good as it rolled
down his parch-ed throat."

371
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:03,642
Mrs. Brighton,
he said "parch-ed."

372
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:04,805
What?

373
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,999
It's supposed to be
"parched."

374
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,951
Oh, yes, that's
"parched", Jim.

375
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,766
Please continue.

376
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,405
It's Justin.

377
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:19,676
Oh. . .Oh,
of course it is.

378
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,866
I'm sorry.

379
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:25,110
"Down his parched throat.

380
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:27,766
"Then he passed the canteen
to his friends

381
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:31,132
and they each took long drinks until
it was empty."

382
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,766
Do you want me
to go on Mrs. Brighton?

383
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:38,045
No, no, that was fine.
thank you.

384
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:40,809
Um...

385
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,211
Who would like
to continue?

386
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:02,332
I'm not a teacher anymore.

387
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,906
I resigned today.

388
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,599
Valerie was
just terrific, she...

389
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,600
She said that she would get a sub
for as long as I needed

390
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:20,645
and that when I was ready
to come back...

391
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:27,343
Oh, Ellen.

392
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,943
Kyle is coming home this weekend

393
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:42,608
and I think it's time
to tell the children.

394
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:05,432
I'm going to drop
out of college--

395
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,166
you're going to
need help.

396
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:10,466
No, Kyle, I don't want
you to do that.

397
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,799
But I want
to be here.

398
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,871
You've always been there
for us and now it's our turn.

399
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,766
We'll be fine.

400
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:18,337
What I want is

401
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:23,367
for both of you to go on with
your lives, grow, love God.

402
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:28,766
It would break my heart
if you stopped doing that.

403
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:32,966
You don't want to break
your mother's heart do you?

404
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:37,177
What's going to happen
to you, mom?

405
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:47,143
Nobody knows exactly...

406
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:53,584
What will happen
but I'll, I'll probably...

407
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,473
I will lose my memory.

408
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,314
Maybe slowly. . .
and maybe quickly.

409
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,844
I may not...

410
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,804
I may not
know you...

411
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,677
Any of you.

412
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,244
But if that day comes,
I want you to remember

413
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,873
that the real me...

414
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:31,943
ls still there...

415
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:35,380
loving you
as much as ever.

416
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,732
Each of us is in God's hands.

417
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:46,733
And I think he wants us

418
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:50,414
to live each day...

419
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:57,511
Each minute. . .
as best as we can.

420
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:01,879
So should we start now?

421
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,111
Oh! Oh look at it!!

422
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:47,841
It's just as beautiful
as I remembered.

423
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,938
So are you.

424
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:52,573
Even more beautiful than when we
first came here.

425
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:01,105
<i>Whoa').!</i>

426
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:05,199
Whoa! No! No!!

427
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,799
Oh-oh-oh!!

428
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,871
No!! No!!!

429
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,846
I've had such wonderful moments
with you.

430
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:11,811
Oh, I just wish we could
make time. . .stop...

431
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:17,141
Stay like this forever.

432
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:23,877
I love you, sweetheart.

433
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,346
Oh. . . Hm?

434
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:45,372
L. . .I'd better
see to Kyle.

435
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,266
I think he's crying.

436
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:50,076
Honey?

437
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,508
Oh, please God, help her.

438
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:32,973
God, why is this happening?

439
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,204
Bye, Mom.

440
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:53,770
<i>I'm</i> gonna <i>to go
to school now.</i>

441
00:29:55,267 --> 00:29:57,466
All right, Grace.

442
00:29:57,467 --> 00:30:02,746
I'm. . .your daughter, Teri.

443
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,880
This one right here.

444
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:11,932
Teri.

445
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:14,166
Yeah, and that's Kyle.

446
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:16,199
Kyle.

447
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,679
Yeah.

448
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,343
<i>L</i> gotta go-

449
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,904
I'll see you
this afternoon.

450
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,974
Aw...

451
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,199
Are you feeling good,
Mrs. Brighton?

452
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,874
You want to get up
and get dressed?

453
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,299
No! No! No! No! No! No!

454
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,299
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

455
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,280
It's all right.

456
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,280
He's coming back
in a little while.

457
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,302
Maybe I better not go just yet.

458
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:11,938
You go ahead,
Mr. Brighton...

459
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,446
No!!!!

460
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:15,447
...it's important you have some
time for yourself.

461
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,466
<i>Go on now.</i>

462
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:18,140
No! No! No! No!

463
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,305
He's coming back
in a little while.

464
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,538
He's coming back
in a little while.

465
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:36,514
Oh, God help me.

466
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,466
I'm sorry. . .You okay?

467
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:48,947
Sorry, just resting.

468
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:52,466
Oh, I thought you
were. . .Well...

469
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:55,699
Having a heart attack
or something?

470
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,799
Does it look
like I should be?

471
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,833
No, it's not that,
I see you running here

472
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:04,542
every once in a while
but you're not very regular.

473
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,566
Keeping track, eh?

474
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:08,966
I just happened to notice.

475
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:11,566
It's hard to do it every day.

476
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:14,766
Oh, yeah, I heard.

477
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,838
Heard what?

478
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:19,541
Oh well, nothin',
it's just that...

479
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:21,638
What?

480
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,341
Well, I heard that
the legs are the first to go.

481
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,142
Really?

482
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:31,275
The next to go is
your sense of humor.

483
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,566
Julia Sinclair

484
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:37,205
John Brighton.

485
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:38,177
Jingle bell swing
and jingle bell ring.

486
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:39,733
Jingle bell swing
and jingle bell ring.

487
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:43,147
Dancin' and prancin'
in jingle bell square

488
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:46,999
in the frosty air.

489
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,032
Oh, right time

490
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,070
it's the right time

491
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,966
to rock
the night away...

492
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:56,066
Thank you--
thank you very much.

493
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:59,366
Jingle bell time
is a swell time

494
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:03,166
to go ridin' in
a one-horse sleigh.

495
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:06,808
Giddyup jingle horse
pick up your feet

496
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:10,940
jingle around the clock

497
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:14,866
mix and mingle
and a-jinglin' be--

498
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:18,999
that's the
jingle bell rock.

499
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,071
Jingle bell
jingle bell

500
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,332
jingle bell rock.

501
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,142
A"?! body home?

502
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:27,266
Jingle bell chime
and jingle bell time

503
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:30,578
dancin' and prancin'
in the jingle bell square

504
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,912
in the frosty air.

505
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:38,899
What a bright time,
it's the right time

506
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,438
to rock
the night away...

507
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,532
Hello.

508
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,069
Hi.

509
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,310
You all right?

510
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:57,109
Just bubbling
with happiness.

511
00:33:57,134 --> 00:33:59,774
How's Mom?

512
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,999
On a scale of one to ten,
about a minus 4.

513
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,232
How's Dad
holding up?

514
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:10,632
You mean that guy who wanders
through here every now and then?

515
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:13,299
Wouldn't know--
hardly ever see him.

516
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,532
This isn't a family anymore, it's an
asylum.

517
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:19,766
And I get to live here. . .
lucky me.

518
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,066
Look, dad's doing
the best he can.

519
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:25,139
I saw him this week
for about 10 minutes

520
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:28,239
and last week I got 15.

521
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,611
Mom thinks
I'm her cousin, Grace.

522
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:32,632
I don't have parents anymore.

523
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:34,933
I might as well be a boarder.

524
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:36,999
And it's Christmas, Kyle,

525
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,966
do you see any decorations?

526
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:40,947
Do you see any cookies?

527
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:43,966
Dad hasn't even had time to go out
and buy presents.

528
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:47,107
There won't be
a Christmas this year--

529
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:49,032
maybe it's for the best.

530
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:51,912
I mean, why fake it?

531
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:55,413
Okay, pitiful,
let's go.

532
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:56,432
What?

533
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:57,999
I said, let's go.

534
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,233
What are you talking about?

535
00:34:59,234 --> 00:34:59,999
Come on.

536
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,172
Leave me alone. No!

537
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,866
No, you're coming--
we've got work to do.

538
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,938
You're crazy! You belong
in this family.

539
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,037
I know.

540
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,273
Hey-he!!!

541
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,507
Hey Dad,
how are you?

542
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:17,943
Hey Mom,
how's it goin'?

543
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:21,843
Ellen, it's Kyle.

544
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,039
Oh, hello.

545
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,012
Hi, Mom.

546
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:30,172
You look great!

547
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,066
When did you get home?

548
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:39,172
A little while ago.

549
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,099
You ready squirt?

550
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,199
Ready.

551
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,599
What's going on here?

552
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,079
Ah, you'll see.

553
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,080
Okay,
let her rip.

554
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:52,678
Oh, I don't believe that.

555
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,741
Oh!!!

556
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,433
Thank you...

557
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,505
Both of you.

558
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:41,611
God bless us, everyone.

559
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:47,710
Mom, do you want
some hot chocolate?

560
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,999
You're not going to
blow a fuse, are you?

561
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,980
How many amps
you got going?

562
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,733
Dad, don't worry about it.

563
00:36:57,734 --> 00:36:59,907
Okay, if you say so.

564
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:02,107
I'll tell you
what to worry about.

565
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:03,112
Hmmm?

566
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:04,909
Teri's planning to cook Christmas
dinner

567
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:06,038
oh, no.

568
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:08,843
Oh, yeah,
and God help us-- everyone.

569
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,937
Like trying to put the windows up
with the heater on

570
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:15,633
we're going 75.

571
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,233
My hair-- ruining...

572
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:18,542
You have this scarf on.

573
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,706
Anyway it was nothing. I mean, in
Florida when it's raining

574
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:22,179
you put the windows up...

575
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,544
You guys need to know that Teri
is the mastermind

576
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:26,547
behind this entire dinner.

577
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,843
So she's worked really hard
and we need to thank her.

578
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:32,869
Okay, ladies and gentlemen...

579
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,506
Teri's grand opus. . .
Is served!

580
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,348
It's nice when someone lends you
a hand in the kitchen.

581
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:53,933
Well, let's all
give thanks, shall we?

582
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:55,999
You know, I'd like
to say something first

583
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,640
if it's okay.
sure, fine.

584
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,669
Well, um...

585
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,180
Last night I asked Cindy
to marry me...

586
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,202
<i>And she said yes“!</i>

587
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:07,646
All right!
I finally get a sister.

588
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,666
Blessings on both of you.

589
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,146
Thank you Alexander.

590
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:13,199
I didn't realize things had gotten <i>so</i>
serious.

591
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,133
I know, dad.
you've been <i>so</i> busy

592
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:17,136
we haven't had
time to tell you.

593
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,266
Welcome, Cindy.

594
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:19,299
Wow!!

595
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,466
Congratulations.

596
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,299
When's the wedding?

597
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,677
Well, um...

598
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,699
As soon as possible!

599
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,202
Welcome to the family.

600
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,179
Thank you.
welcome!

601
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,933
Something to think about.

602
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,311
Don't get any ideas.

603
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,314
We certainly have a lot to be
thankful for this year.

604
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,866
You' re absolutely right.

605
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:39,266
Let's pray.

606
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:40,575
Oh!!

607
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:44,738
Father on this Christmas day,

608
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:48,433
we want to thank you
for all these gifts of joy.

609
00:38:48,434 --> 00:38:53,383
For our children,
Kyle and Teri...

610
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,573
Everybody told me
not to marry him

611
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,633
but I was stubborn.

612
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:45,999
I knew better...

613
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,266
Or <i>so</i> I thought.

614
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:51,009
I' m sorry, Julia.

615
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:55,266
Thanks, I appreciate
your listening.

616
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,577
You don't interrupt
the way my cockatiel does.

617
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:01,938
Once the legs are gone, what can
you do but sit and listen?

618
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:51,845
Oop!!

619
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,573
Woop!

620
00:41:03,134 --> 00:41:05,766
You ruin everything!!

621
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:08,299
These are my favorite lipsticks.

622
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,166
How did you do this?

623
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,477
Look what she did.

624
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,266
Everything is
completely ruined!

625
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:18,032
Honey, it's
all right.

626
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:20,206
Let me take care
of this.

627
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,511
Mrs. Brighton, don't you
like your breakfast?

628
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:51,014
You need to eat.

629
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:57,533
Oh, you're looking for
your husband aren't you?

630
00:41:57,534 --> 00:41:59,966
You don't like it
when he's gone.

631
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:03,166
But everything is
going to be just fine.

632
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:05,599
He's away on
a little business trip

633
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,978
and he'll be back
tomorrow night.

634
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,207
Tomorrow night.

635
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:12,771
It's pretty isn't it?
you like it?

636
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,013
I'll be right back, I'm just going to
fold some clothes.

637
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,499
Teacher.

638
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,166
Teacher.

639
00:42:57,167 --> 00:43:01,411
The. . .teacher, teacher.

640
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:39,107
Senora??

641
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:44,647
Senora!!!!

642
00:43:46,733 --> 00:43:48,337
Mrs. Brighton!

643
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:51,933
Mrs. Brighton!

644
00:43:51,934 --> 00:43:53,466
Mrs. Brighton!

645
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,310
Mrs. Brighton.

646
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,246
<i>Ay dios mio!!</i>

647
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,773
We at Brighton Associates are

648
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,833
pleased to have
the opportunity

649
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:19,999
to brief you
on the progress

650
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,233
of our southwest
corridor explorations.

651
00:44:22,234 --> 00:44:24,646
We first chartered
this region...

652
00:44:28,267 --> 00:44:29,905
Come on.

653
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:43,566
...number 630
in your prospectus.

654
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:45,666
If you'll turn
to page 16.

655
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:47,166
Before we get
into all that

656
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:50,499
I would like an explanation
as to why

657
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,312
this briefing has been repeatedly
rescheduled.

658
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,580
I'm glad you asked about that and
it is something we...

659
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,841
How far behind schedule are we?

660
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:03,266
Well. . .Well you
have to understand.

661
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,747
Southwest corridor has
never exactly

662
00:45:05,767 --> 00:45:07,747
been explored before so...

663
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:26,845
Aaahh!!

664
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:29,266
Exactly--
the southwest corridor is

665
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:31,999
a very hazardous, cavernous
region of the ocean.

666
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,980
Mr. Brighton,
it's for you.

667
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,536
A family emergency.

668
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:59,066
You and Stephanie will have to run
the meeting without me.

669
00:45:59,067 --> 00:46:01,206
John, that's impossible, they want to
hear from you!!

670
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:02,303
<i>I have no choice.</i>

671
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:03,633
You do have
a choice.

672
00:46:03,634 --> 00:46:04,999
Yeah, you tell me--
what is it?

673
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,741
Are the police
looking for her?

674
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:08,212
I assume so.

675
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:10,333
Well fine, they'll
take it from here.

676
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,333
I mean, what
can you do?

677
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:15,033
Look, we have 2 hours in
there and we've got 'em.

678
00:46:15,034 --> 00:46:17,299
You can't get there
in 2 hours anyway.

679
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,678
I've got to go home.
I have no other choice.

680
00:46:21,867 --> 00:46:23,847
It's funny how this company

681
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:25,847
never seems to be on
your list of choices.

682
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:34,266
How do you think
they liked it?

683
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:37,111
Are you kidding?
you did a nice job.

684
00:46:37,134 --> 00:46:38,966
Thanks for pinch-hitting.

685
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:40,344
No problem.

686
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:42,176
I can't believe John
just bails on us like that.

687
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,770
Ellen was missing.

688
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,066
It's not like he could have
done anything about it.

689
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:49,033
I'm sure she's glad she
married John and not you.

690
00:46:49,034 --> 00:46:51,014
She would have been in
a nursing home a long time ago.

691
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:52,672
That's right.

692
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:10,480
Jeremy, keep reading, quiet.

693
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,481
If you finish up this lesson
you guys get to go to recess.

694
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,447
Psst! Mrs. Edwards.

695
00:47:30,967 --> 00:47:33,106
May I help you?

696
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:39,266
Take your seats.

697
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:40,933
Take your seats, class.

698
00:47:40,934 --> 00:47:42,607
Take your seats.

699
00:47:43,967 --> 00:47:46,447
Matthew, please go
get Mrs. Dewey.

700
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:54,974
Who knows the question?

701
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,037
NO! No!

702
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:02,299
Take your seats.

703
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,733
Take your seats.

704
00:48:03,734 --> 00:48:05,633
Take your seats.

705
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:06,766
Ellen...

706
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:08,199
Take your seat.

707
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,202
Ellen, it's me-- Valerie.

708
00:48:10,234 --> 00:48:12,180
Take your seat.
take your seats.

709
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,770
Take your seats.

710
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,404
Ellen, why don't you
come into my office?

711
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,499
Take your seats.

712
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,933
We could sit down. No!!!

713
00:48:17,934 --> 00:48:19,433
We could sit. . . No! No! No!

714
00:48:19,434 --> 00:48:21,266
Teach! No! No! No!

715
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:23,333
Teach! Teach!

716
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,780
Teach! Teach!

717
00:48:38,267 --> 00:48:41,066
Oh, Mr. Brighton,
I'm <i>so</i> sorry.

718
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:43,666
I went to the laundry room
for just one minute

719
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,647
and she was gone.
I'm <i>so</i> sorry.

720
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:47,613
It's all right, Maria.

721
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:58,099
Ellen...

722
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,433
Hmmm.

723
00:48:59,434 --> 00:49:02,711
I'm <i>so</i> glad you're safe.

724
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,666
She's okay.

725
00:49:17,667 --> 00:49:19,433
Well I'm not!

726
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:21,414
I can't take this anymore.

727
00:49:21,434 --> 00:49:24,176
I'm sorry Teri,
we're all trying.

728
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:33,909
Every day I think the <i>chaos</i> can't
get any worse.

729
00:49:33,934 --> 00:49:36,166
And it does.

730
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:38,545
People keep telling me

731
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:40,999
there's nothing more
I can do for my wife

732
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,832
that she doesn't even know
who I am anymore.

733
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:46,666
I should put her away
in a nursing home.

734
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:49,966
But sometimes she does
know who I am,

735
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:53,676
I can see it
in her eyes.

736
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,699
I'm sorry to be dumping
all this on you

737
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,012
but having someone to talk to just
means <i>so</i> much to me.

738
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,366
No, it's okay.

739
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:09,266
I love to hear you talk.

740
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:10,541
Oh.

741
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:13,232
This time
that we spend together,

742
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:16,771
well, it's just about
the high point of my day.

743
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:22,315
I really appreciate
your friendship.

744
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:25,038
You don't return phone calls.

745
00:50:25,134 --> 00:50:26,374
You don't return phone calls.

746
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,433
You cancel meetings
at the last minute.

747
00:50:28,434 --> 00:50:30,433
You're not available
for consultation.

748
00:50:30,434 --> 00:50:33,899
Every time it happens you
apologize, but nothing changes.

749
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,166
Aren't you the one who's
always preaching

750
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:39,066
about how repentance is some
sort of change of conduct?

751
00:50:39,067 --> 00:50:42,048
I'll change; the company
will change. We'll rebound.

752
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:43,808
Rebound?

753
00:50:43,834 --> 00:50:45,966
Yesterday Robin
and Doug resigned.

754
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:48,470
This morning <i>3</i> sales guys--
you call that rebounding?

755
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,399
Um, excuse me.

756
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,699
May I help you?

757
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,202
Is John Brighton here?

758
00:50:58,234 --> 00:50:59,699
The word's on
the street John,

759
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,974
the accounts are
getting jittery,

760
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,299
the sharks are circling!

761
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,533
I'll make some calls.

762
00:51:03,534 --> 00:51:05,104
That's not enough.

763
00:51:05,134 --> 00:51:07,333
I need you here every day,
I need your word on it.

764
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:09,299
How am I going to do that
with Ellen the way she is?

765
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,899
You put her in a home
for people like that.

766
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,166
Come on, John,
you're young, get a life.

767
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:16,670
She's not people like that!
She's my wife.

768
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,577
I love her!

769
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:35,747
John, Ellen's dying.

770
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:39,010
There's nothing you
can do about that.

771
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:43,540
Please, just go.

772
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:53,266
Hello.

773
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:54,933
Hi. Hi John!

774
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:56,413
Julia.

775
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:58,799
Oh, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

776
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,866
Oh, excuse me. Phil, Julia Sinclair,
my brother, Phil.

777
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,847
Hi. Nice to meet you.
nice to meet you.

778
00:52:03,867 --> 00:52:05,403
I was right around the corner.

779
00:52:05,434 --> 00:52:06,674
I wondered if you were
free for lunch.

780
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,441
Sure.

781
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:10,105
And you're
with...

782
00:52:10,134 --> 00:52:12,444
Julia's ah, just a friend.

783
00:52:12,467 --> 00:52:14,572
Oh. . .Oh,
just a friend.

784
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,266
Have a nice lunch.

785
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,566
Nice to meet you.

786
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:21,444
Nice to meet you.

787
00:52:23,867 --> 00:52:26,132
I can't say I blame him.

788
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:28,545
If it was anyone but family,

789
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:30,740
I'd a gotten the boot
a long time ago.

790
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:33,233
I'm <i>so</i> sorry.

791
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,566
What are you going to do?

792
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:37,945
I don't know.

793
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:42,848
So much of what I did was
for Ellen and our future.

794
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:46,674
Your future isn't over.

795
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:50,211
Would Ellen want you to
give up your life for her?

796
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:52,407
She loved you.

797
00:52:52,434 --> 00:52:54,732
I know what a woman wants
for the man she loves,

798
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:57,199
she wants you to go on and be
even more successful...

799
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,909
For yourself
and Kyle and Teri.

800
00:53:03,134 --> 00:53:05,910
You're such a giving man.

801
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:08,799
You think about everybody
but yourself.

802
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,182
But John. . .
I'm thinking about you.

803
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:19,674
If you ever
need anything...

804
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,271
I'm here for you.

805
00:53:33,967 --> 00:53:37,141
Cindy and I have been praying
about this for a long time.

806
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:40,899
We set the date for our wedding.

807
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,266
It's a week after graduation.

808
00:53:43,267 --> 00:53:45,333
That' s great.

809
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:47,905
Congratulations.

810
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:54,374
I'm happy for you son.

811
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,066
Just wish things could
have been different,

812
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,547
we haven't had
much time to talk.

813
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:01,569
I wanted to be there for you.

814
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,876
Make sure you were
ready for this.

815
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,743
Don't worry Dad.

816
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:08,866
Cindy and I have learned more
about marriage

817
00:54:08,867 --> 00:54:11,643
from watching you and Mom than
you could ever put into words.

818
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,006
Let's go for another set.

819
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:07,408
John!?

820
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:13,539
Her name is Julia Sinclair.

821
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:17,709
She's become a. . .
a dear friend.

822
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,680
She's amazing.

823
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,113
She listens endlessly
to my whining.

824
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,777
I'm just <i>so</i> lonely, Alexander.

825
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,666
I try to remember what it felt like
to have Ellen

826
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:35,648
put her arms around me,
kiss me...

827
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,503
But the memory's fading.

828
00:55:40,534 --> 00:55:44,641
Every morning I see Julia
and I'm alive.

829
00:55:47,834 --> 00:55:50,747
I'm afraid I'm falling
in love with her.

830
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:53,213
I love Ellen...

831
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:57,941
But I just...

832
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:02,967
Sometimes I can't stand the thought
of holding her hand

833
00:56:03,834 --> 00:56:08,408
and just being
<i>so</i> completely alone.

834
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:14,074
Loneliness can be
a terrible thing.

835
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,104
I know-- I'm an expert.

836
00:56:17,134 --> 00:56:20,672
There was a time I thought I had a
loneliness problem,

837
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,533
same as you're feeling now.

838
00:56:23,534 --> 00:56:26,105
I know the signs.

839
00:56:26,134 --> 00:56:31,134
But, John, you haven't got
a loneliness problem,

840
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:38,083
I think the issue
for you is trust.

841
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:43,066
Are you free tomorrow night?

842
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:46,207
I suppose so. . .Why?

843
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:49,237
You'll have to
trust me on this.

844
00:56:49,267 --> 00:56:50,905
All right?

845
00:56:50,934 --> 00:56:53,999
I remember that night
in temple terrace.

846
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,479
God was speaking to my heart--
I knew that.

847
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:57,532
God was speaking to my heart--
I knew that.

848
00:56:57,533 --> 00:57:00,233
And I remember getting
on my knees

849
00:57:00,234 --> 00:57:03,738
on the 18th hole of
the golf course and I said,

850
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:09,012
"Oh, God. . .l give in.

851
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:12,733
"I never wanted
to be a preacher.

852
00:57:12,734 --> 00:57:16,045
"I never wanted to be
anything in the church.

853
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:18,877
"I didn't like the church,

854
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,166
but I'll be what
you want me to be

855
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:24,799
"and I'll do what
you want me to do."

856
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,800
And that call has never left
and God has said,

857
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:35,776
"I want you to continue as long
as I give you the strength."

858
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,178
The voice was <i>so</i> distinct

859
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,199
that I couldn't misunderstand that
call.

860
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,181
And every Christian is
called to ministry.

861
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,305
Did you know that?

862
00:57:46,334 --> 00:57:49,399
The word ministry
means servant, service.

863
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,033
With a call to do
something for other people

864
00:57:53,034 --> 00:57:56,433
that are less fortunate
than we are.

865
00:57:56,434 --> 00:58:00,866
Jesus took on himself the form of
a servant, the Bible says.

866
00:58:00,867 --> 00:58:06,510
He said, "I did not come
to be served, but to serve."

867
00:58:06,534 --> 00:58:08,605
In Mark 10.

868
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:12,699
It's tough to do
the will of God.

869
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,699
We have the highest standard
of living in the world.

870
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,366
The highest standard that
the world has ever known.

871
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,938
And yet as a nation
we're in danger

872
00:58:21,967 --> 00:58:25,899
of leaving God out of our lives.

873
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,710
Oh, please, God, forgive me--

874
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:36,938
forgive me for trying
to do all this on my own.

875
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:44,046
I need you Lord...

876
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,138
Now more than ever.

877
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:54,366
The devil will always have
a ship ready

878
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:57,405
when a man wants
to sail away from God.

879
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:02,011
You see God gave his son,
Jesus Christ,

880
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,080
You see God gave his son,
Jesus Christ,

881
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,637
to die on that <i>cross</i> for you.

882
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:09,443
That's the reason
he was there...

883
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:11,766
John?...

884
00:59:11,767 --> 00:59:14,043
Are you all right?

885
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:17,444
Yeah!

886
00:59:17,467 --> 00:59:19,866
I've got to go
home, Alexander.

887
00:59:19,867 --> 00:59:24,043
I have some things
I need to do.

888
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:25,833
Sure...

889
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:28,610
<i>Let'</i> S

890
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:11,879
Sweetheart...

891
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:18,032
Sweetheart...

892
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:20,843
I know it's been a while,

893
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,711
but I have
something to tell you.

894
01:00:23,734 --> 01:00:26,943
Something to remind you of,

895
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:32,713
because, well, I was reminded
of it myself tonight.

896
01:00:32,734 --> 01:00:36,133
Let's see...

897
01:00:36,134 --> 01:00:39,099
Been a long time.

898
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:44,100
I, John, take you, Ellen,

899
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:48,566
to be my wife.

900
01:00:48,567 --> 01:00:52,966
To have and to hold.

901
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:57,066
To honor and to treasure.

902
01:00:57,067 --> 01:01:00,433
To be at your side

903
01:01:00,434 --> 01:01:03,299
through sorrow and joy,

904
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,366
in sickness and in health.

905
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:11,367
To love and cherish you always.

906
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:17,633
I promise you this

907
01:01:17,634 --> 01:01:21,366
from my heart...

908
01:01:21,367 --> 01:01:25,315
With my soul...

909
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:29,783
For as long
as we both shall live.

910
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:36,447
This is my promise to you.

911
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:43,981
You know, up until now

912
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,074
I thought of taking care of you as
a chore.

913
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:53,632
But I want you to know,

914
01:01:53,633 --> 01:01:57,433
taking care of you is

915
01:01:57,434 --> 01:02:01,746
an honor. . .a privilege.

916
01:02:06,234 --> 01:02:14,449
This bed. . .
Is my altar, Lord.

917
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:19,246
And on it is the woman I love.

918
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:26,613
I give her into your hands.

919
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,766
Well, hi.

920
01:02:57,767 --> 01:02:58,799
Hi.

921
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,299
Come on in.

922
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,506
Thanks.

923
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:03,536
I'm sorry to
surprise you like this.

924
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:05,513
Oh no, it's fine.

925
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,745
I have a feeling we're not going to
be running together anymore.

926
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,680
Isn't it strange?

927
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,199
It was your faithfulness
that drew me to you

928
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,080
and now your faithfulness
is taking you away.

929
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:14,137
John. . .Hi.

930
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:16,366
Phil, I'm sorry
to bother you.

931
01:04:16,367 --> 01:04:20,474
I just wanted to stop by
and tell you, I am <i>so</i> sorry.

932
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,899
You are absolutely right.

933
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,599
About what?

934
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,511
About me holding the firm back.

935
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:28,833
I've giving it a lot of a thought and
I understand now,

936
01:04:28,834 --> 01:04:31,599
you were right about it and the
only solution is for me

937
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,033
to give you my share--
controlling interest.

938
01:04:35,034 --> 01:04:37,133
What are you
talkin' about?

939
01:04:37,134 --> 01:04:39,633
I've given it
a lot of thought

940
01:04:39,634 --> 01:04:42,132
and I just think it's
best for all concerned.

941
01:04:42,133 --> 01:04:44,466
So, I just wanted
you to know that.

942
01:04:44,467 --> 01:04:47,641
So I'm sorry I disturbed
you and...

943
01:04:47,667 --> 01:04:49,366
Michelle.

944
01:04:49,367 --> 01:04:51,066
Michelle. . .Hi.

945
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:51,977
Hello.

946
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,480
So, anyway,
have a nice day.

947
01:04:57,534 --> 01:05:00,378
Who was that?

948
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,110
I think it was
my former partner.

949
01:05:07,434 --> 01:05:10,099
Well, I'm glad you
all could make it.

950
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,733
There's been a few changes here
at Brighton Associates.

951
01:05:12,734 --> 01:05:15,733
We have good news and
we have more good news.

952
01:05:15,734 --> 01:05:20,566
The good news is we're not going
to have anymore problems

953
01:05:20,567 --> 01:05:24,333
with John bailing on meetings and
scaring away clients.

954
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:26,575
What did you do,
hide his pager?

955
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,443
Not exactly.

956
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:30,366
He stepped down
from the company.

957
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,210
What?
what?

958
01:05:32,234 --> 01:05:33,804
You've got to be kidding us.

959
01:05:33,834 --> 01:05:35,933
So what's the
more good news?

960
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:39,381
The more good news. . .
Is that I'm in charge now.

961
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,573
Ah. . .no offense, Phil,

962
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,299
but without John,
I'm not sure we can make it.

963
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,899
Without John?
give me a break.

964
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,799
He hasn't been here
for the last <i>3</i> months.

965
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,399
Come on guys.
we'll be fine!

966
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,299
Where's the old
company spirit here?

967
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,166
Who's going to handle
the European clients?

968
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,932
It took John <i>3</i> years to get them
to sign those contracts.

969
01:06:04,933 --> 01:06:06,810
And they won't even
talk to you, pal.

970
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:08,813
I'll send them flowers.

971
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:13,047
Is anybody
hot in here?

972
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:15,479
Look, I'm with you, Phil,

973
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,606
but I'm not sure we're going to be
able to convince the others.

974
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,380
We'll convince them.

975
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,843
We have to.

976
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:33,166
I see the laundry truck
has arrived.

977
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:34,771
Hi, uncle Phil.
how's it going?

978
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,133
Okay. ls your dad here?

979
01:06:36,134 --> 01:06:38,832
No. Why, what's wrong?

980
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:40,799
Nothin' .

981
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,332
Actually, plenty.

982
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,971
Why?

983
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,980
Your dad turned over the controlling
interest

984
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,999
in the company to me.

985
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,033
Really?

986
01:06:51,034 --> 01:06:53,499
Yeah, really.

987
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,037
It's been a disaster.

988
01:06:56,067 --> 01:06:57,966
I thought that's what
you always wanted.

989
01:06:57,967 --> 01:07:00,299
Yeah, he just dumped everything on
me and split.

990
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,599
The whole office staff is nervous,
some of them have quit.

991
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,599
I'm afraid
if I tell the clients,

992
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,099
I'm going to lose a lot more
than just employees.

993
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,410
He knows how valuable he is
to this company,

994
01:07:10,434 --> 01:07:12,414
he can't just do this.

995
01:07:12,434 --> 01:07:14,744
Look, Dad's been under
a lot of pressure lately

996
01:07:14,767 --> 01:07:16,110
with Mom and everything.

997
01:07:16,134 --> 01:07:18,233
There's a lot of professional people
and places

998
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,407
that can do a much better job
of taking care of your mom

999
01:07:20,433 --> 01:07:22,242
than your dad has.

1000
01:07:22,267 --> 01:07:24,666
You haven't even
seen him with her.

1001
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:28,444
Are they going to put 1 1/2
teaspoons of honey in her tea,

1002
01:07:28,467 --> 01:07:30,310
just the way she likes it?

1003
01:07:30,334 --> 01:07:32,814
Are they going to read to her out
of the Bible

1004
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:35,508
and brush her hair every night?

1005
01:07:35,534 --> 01:07:37,999
Do they even know what her
favorite color is?

1006
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,241
Look, uncle Phil,
I love you a lot.

1007
01:07:40,267 --> 01:07:42,440
I always have and I always will

1008
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:45,433
and I appreciate the things you've
tried to tell me

1009
01:07:45,434 --> 01:07:48,566
about life but, you got
to understand something--

1010
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:50,599
my father,
he lives every day

1011
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,166
according to the principles
of the Bible.

1012
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:57,240
Now, I know that doesn't
mean anything to you,

1013
01:07:57,267 --> 01:08:00,544
but I gotta ask you...

1014
01:08:00,567 --> 01:08:04,105
What principles
do you live by?

1015
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:19,099
If you want to find Dad,

1016
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,604
he's probably at Alexander's.

1017
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,766
And <i>so</i> I did what
you said, Alexander,

1018
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:48,805
I let go of everything
I could think of...

1019
01:08:50,033 --> 01:08:53,242
And I let go of Ellen.

1020
01:08:55,234 --> 01:08:58,408
I gave her over to God.

1021
01:09:00,534 --> 01:09:05,534
I feel. . .peace.

1022
01:09:06,134 --> 01:09:08,580
Thanks, Alexander.

1023
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,303
Hi, Alexander.

1024
01:09:25,334 --> 01:09:30,334
Phil. . .l didn't know
you were here.

1025
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,199
Well, I heard John
spilling his guts,

1026
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,533
I didn't think
I should interrupt.

1027
01:09:35,534 --> 01:09:38,466
Man, what is
going on with him?

1028
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:41,209
He let go of the business,
he let go of Julia,

1029
01:09:41,233 --> 01:09:43,372
he let go of Ellen.

1030
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,999
He doesn't have
anything left.

1031
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,166
I mean, how do you get peace
by letting go of everything?

1032
01:09:49,167 --> 01:09:51,866
I thought you get peace
by having everything.

1033
01:09:51,867 --> 01:09:54,366
Well, it's easy enough
to understand,

1034
01:09:54,367 --> 01:09:57,233
but not <i>so</i> easy
when you try and do it.

1035
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:01,533
You know, I think what matters is
to recognize that it takes

1036
01:10:01,534 --> 01:10:06,199
someone bigger than ourselves
to help us find true peace.

1037
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,866
We weren't designed
to do it alone.

1038
01:10:10,867 --> 01:10:13,733
So how does
John do it?

1039
01:10:13,734 --> 01:10:17,633
He finally recognized
that God was fully capable

1040
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:20,266
of handling anything
we give him to handle

1041
01:10:20,267 --> 01:10:24,233
and that there is no true peace
without that step.

1042
01:10:24,234 --> 01:10:28,533
I thought God helps those
who help themselves.

1043
01:10:28,534 --> 01:10:34,644
How can he if you're too busy
handling things yourself?

1044
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:38,911
You see, God loves us <i>so</i> much,

1045
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:42,973
he gave his only son,
Jesus Christ,

1046
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,470
to die in our place.

1047
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:51,109
Then he raised him
from the dead

1048
01:10:51,134 --> 01:10:54,240
to prove that he was his son

1049
01:10:54,267 --> 01:10:58,666
and to show us that
we too could have eternal life.

1050
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:02,766
If he's willing to do all that without
any help from us,

1051
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:07,011
why should he want to see us
carry our other burdens?

1052
01:11:09,067 --> 01:11:11,206
I don't know.

1053
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:15,533
Well, he doesn't want us
to carry them.

1054
01:11:15,534 --> 01:11:18,933
And the good news is,
we don't have to.

1055
01:11:18,934 --> 01:11:22,814
He's more than capable
of managing our lives

1056
01:11:22,834 --> 01:11:25,508
if we just let him.

1057
01:11:25,534 --> 01:11:29,346
But we need to acknowledge
that we need him

1058
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:34,510
and then learn to trust him,

1059
01:11:34,534 --> 01:11:39,534
to believe in him--
let him take control.

1060
01:11:39,601 --> 01:11:44,573
Invite him to be
the Lord of your life.

1061
01:11:46,534 --> 01:11:49,174
So, is that
what John did?

1062
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:51,181
Uh-hm.

1063
01:11:53,134 --> 01:11:56,308
Is that how he got that
peace he was talking about?

1064
01:11:56,334 --> 01:11:58,133
That' s how.

1065
01:11:58,134 --> 01:12:00,876
You want some of that?

1066
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:06,375
Sounds like too good
of a deal.

1067
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,381
It's always about the deal.

1068
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:13,866
But you know-- you're right!

1069
01:12:13,867 --> 01:12:17,644
It is a good deal.

1070
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:22,548
Phil, why don't you go on
back in the <i>woods</i>

1071
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:25,912
and talk to the Lord.

1072
01:12:25,934 --> 01:12:30,314
Let him take controlling interest in
your life.

1073
01:12:30,334 --> 01:12:34,214
Begin to feel his power at work.

1074
01:12:58,501 --> 01:13:00,811
Listen to Phil, Lord,

1075
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:04,111
just like you listened
to John and to me

1076
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:06,774
<i>so</i> many times.

1077
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,599
God, are you there?

1078
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,705
Can you hear me?

1079
01:13:31,334 --> 01:13:34,577
I think I need you, Lord.

1080
01:13:36,267 --> 01:13:39,578
I'm getting really tired
of doing this on my own.

1081
01:13:43,301 --> 01:13:46,399
I'm just tired of being
a control freak, God

1082
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,904
and telling everybody
what to do all the time.

1083
01:13:52,434 --> 01:13:55,745
Just forgive me, God.

1084
01:13:55,767 --> 01:14:01,080
Forgive me for being <i>so</i>
self-centered and...

1085
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,843
Just such a jerk.

1086
01:14:06,367 --> 01:14:09,177
Forgive me for that,
will ya?

1087
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,840
Could you do that?

1088
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:17,066
Just change me, Jesus.

1089
01:14:17,067 --> 01:14:19,877
Okay?

1090
01:14:21,301 --> 01:14:25,113
I give you controlling interest.

1091
01:14:25,134 --> 01:14:30,550
Just come and take control
of my life.

1092
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:33,066
Will ya?

1093
01:14:33,067 --> 01:14:36,699
And give me peace.

1094
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:42,514
I just give it to you.

1095
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:48,007
Is that a deal?

1096
01:14:49,634 --> 01:14:52,638
Have I got a deal, Lord?

1097
01:14:54,267 --> 01:14:56,474
Deal!!

1098
01:14:57,734 --> 01:15:01,079
It's a good deal!

1099
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:24,382
The test was pretty hard.

1100
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:28,144
I hate chemistry and when
I'm done with this class,

1101
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,613
I'm never getting near it again.

1102
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:35,533
But there is this guy in the class
I-l kinda like him.

1103
01:16:35,534 --> 01:16:40,142
He's cute, but I don't even think he
knows I exist.

1104
01:16:40,167 --> 01:16:44,479
But. . .college is <i>so</i> different.

1105
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:49,500
But lately, I was thinking about
even getting into teaching

1106
01:16:50,667 --> 01:16:56,208
'cuz I-I remembered how much
it really meant to you

1107
01:16:56,234 --> 01:16:59,704
and it's. . .it's kind...

1108
01:17:16,767 --> 01:17:19,771
Teri...

1109
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:28,874
I. . .Love. . .You.

1110
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,799
Mommy...

1111
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,199
You know who I am.

1112
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,306
I love you too.

1113
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:45,007
Mom...

1114
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:47,537
I'm going to go get
Kyle and Dad,

1115
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:49,638
I'll be right back, Mom.

1116
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,374
John!

1117
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,666
Ellen!

1118
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:01,000
Mom!! Ellen!!

1119
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:02,866
Mom!!

1120
01:18:02,867 --> 01:18:06,033
Ellen, honey...

1121
01:18:06,034 --> 01:18:08,071
Ellen?

1122
01:18:09,334 --> 01:18:11,678
She looked
right at me.

1123
01:18:11,701 --> 01:18:13,908
She said my name.

1124
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:18,781
It's all right.

1125
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:24,441
Maybe it was God's gift to you.

1126
01:18:32,967 --> 01:18:36,633
Looks like you finally found
the studs to that shirt.

1127
01:18:36,634 --> 01:18:39,133
Got a little class
working for you there

1128
01:18:39,134 --> 01:18:40,511
just like your
little brother.

1129
01:18:40,534 --> 01:18:41,911
Thanks.

1130
01:18:43,234 --> 01:18:45,578
You know, John, we ah,

1131
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:48,333
we want you back
at the firm.

1132
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:51,400
I want you back
as controlling partner.

1133
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:54,133
Now you don't have
to answer to me right now,

1134
01:18:54,134 --> 01:18:56,799
I. . .l know you got a lot
on your mind and stuff.

1135
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,940
There is one other thing
I want to clear up.

1136
01:18:59,967 --> 01:19:02,948
I ah...

1137
01:19:04,967 --> 01:19:09,313
I need you to forgive me--
for the way I acted,

1138
01:19:09,334 --> 01:19:12,213
for ah...

1139
01:19:12,234 --> 01:19:15,215
Putting the company
ahead of Ellen.

1140
01:19:16,934 --> 01:19:20,006
Will you forgive me
for that?

1141
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:04,809
I, Kyle, take you, Cindy,
to be my beloved wife.

1142
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:07,799
To have and to hold you,

1143
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,371
to honor and treasure you,

1144
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,779
to be by your side
in sorrow and in joy,

1145
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,600
in sickness and in health,

1146
01:20:17,601 --> 01:20:20,946
to love and cherish you always.

1147
01:20:20,967 --> 01:20:25,882
I promise you this
with my heart,

1148
01:20:25,901 --> 01:20:28,999
with my soul...

1149
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,733
As long as we both shall live.

1150
01:20:32,734 --> 01:20:36,113
This is my promise to you.

1151
01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:59,840
Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it?
