Is that everything
you have to say on the matter?

I swear. I swear!

You know what?

How the hell you figure
this wound up

out here in the middle of

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,067
This will work out nice.

44
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:19,674
Just cut me loose.

45
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:21,743
You'll never see me again,
honest. Just cut me loose.

46
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:23,678
Sit on up.

47
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:25,880
Well, you see,
I would cut you loose,

48
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:28,584
but that just violates
my sense of what's right.

<i>By the time I was three,</i>

55
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:31,246
<i>we'd made it to
Coffeyville, Kansas,</i>

of a farmer.</i>

<i>Which is what I am.</i>

62
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,861
We got that hog, stock to feed,

63
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,964
and a root cellar to fill.

64
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,700
There's tractors can do this now
in quarter the time.

65
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,702
Is that right?

66
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:01,803
And here I thought

67
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:03,906
farming was in
your bones, Wyatt.

68
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:07,710
This would be a
good place for you

69
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,211
to raise a family of your own.

70
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:11,880
I know your ma would have
felt that way.

By wisdom is a house built,

74
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:21,856
and through understanding
is it established.

75
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,827
Through knowledge are
its rooms filled

76
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:27,061
with rare and
beautiful treasures.

77
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:30,332
And blessed are those hearts
that are set on pilgrimage.

stick around...

at each other...

00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,746
Thanks for the help, Al.

82
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:46,181
It does me good to be here.

83
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:51,621
Makes me feel like I'm still
connected to Marie somehow.

84
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,856
Give your uncle a hand
with his things.

85
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,926
That is, if you've had
sufficient respite.

86
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:19,113
Thank you, son.

87
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:20,082
Yes, sir.

88
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:21,949
Yeah, I wanted to go huntin'
this mornin',

89
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:24,153
but your pa said he
needed some help.

90
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:27,222
Sure would like to go with you
one of these days.

91
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:29,925
I don't think
that'd go over too well.

Your pa's a good man, Wyatt.

93
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:35,698
I wouldn't let him
marry my sister

if I didn't think so.

Soon enough, you'll be able to

do all the travelin'
and shootin' you want to.

97
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,342
Stop frettin' about it.

98
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:08,097
We'll take two chops
for supper and smoke the rest.

I ain't got time to render this.
Throw it in the pen.

Don't it bother you sometimes,

Don't make no
difference to a hog.

Why'd you settle here?

103

[Henry]
What's that meant to mean?

104
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:01,750
Why? Why the Territory,
of all places?

105
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:04,820
You could stake a claim,

106
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:07,021
hang onto it for a year,
it was yours.

107
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:09,991
Seemed like
a pretty good deal at the time.

108
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,297
Got here before the guns
went off, you know that.

109
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,032
I still don't believe
this is what you wanted.

workin' the crops.

older than you.

Lookie here.

119

What do you think happened?
Some kind of robbery?

- A shootout?
- Shut your nonsense.

121
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:43,018
I'd best go look for the rider.

122
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,986
Yeah, I'll go saddle up.

123
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,122
You tend to this horse
and stay inside till I get back.

124
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,092
But what if it's trouble, Pa?
I can help you.

125
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,928
Go on. Do as I say.

- Is he alive?
- Barely.

132
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:22,323
Was he alone?

133
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:28,330
No, but I dispatched
with a dozen others was there.

134
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:29,130
Give me a hand.

135
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:31,967
He's... he's lost a
lot of blood.

136
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,344
Is he gonna live?

137
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:44,246
Be up to us, I suppose.

138
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:46,347
Too far and too late
to fetch the doc.

139

Well, I can go.
Ride all night if I have to.

140

I'm sure you would.

So?

You'll stay right here.

That is an outlaw.

On the run, shot off his horse.

You think he killed somebody?

just as much as you do.

00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,944
What's that for?

148
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,948
Seal the wound tight
so he don't bleed out overnight.

149
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:24,919
No! Don't never elevate
the feet with a chest wound.

Bullet's gotta come out.
And he won't make the ride.

Half that rope.

167

I'll fetch the doc.

168

You'll stay here
and keep an eye on him.

169

You really think
that's necessary?

170

It ain't not necessary.

00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:52,647
[Wyatt]
I can handle myself

183
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,182
[Henry] You just do as I say.
I'll be back soon as I can.

184
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,217
Come on.

185
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,901
[sudden gasp]

186
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:32,313

198
00:26:58,265 --> 00:26:59,434
Where's Billy at?

199
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,040
[in Spanish]

200
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:10,244

[distant thunder rumbles]

205
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:26,353
Whoa.

206
00:29:38,057 --> 00:29:39,259
He was here.

207
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:43,664
Don't look like it to me.

208
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:47,936
[distant thunder rumbles]

209
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:55,342
If I'm right, he weren't alone.

210
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,616
Whoever it is knows
what he's doin'.

211
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:08,221
Covered his tracks as good
as anyone I've run across.

212
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:11,359
Weren't for this rain,
I'd have found him sooner.

213
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:14,996
[Ketchum] I don't need you
to speechify the inner workings

214
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:17,097
in your halfwit canine mind.

215
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:19,967
I need to know where
he's headed.

216
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:27,307
Well, that don't exactly
narrow it down.

217

[distant bird squawks,

219
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:18,086
[Curry, groggy]
Where am I?

222
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:25,492
Who the hell are you?

223
00:32:26,627 --> 00:32:29,263
M-My pa found you,
close to dead.

224
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,764
He brought you back here.

225
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:32,432
Oh, yeah?

226
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:34,200
Who's your pa?

227
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:35,236
Nobody. Uh...

228
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:37,338
Henry. Just a-a farmer.

229
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:40,207
[pained grunts]

230
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:44,178
[grunt]

231
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:52,285
What, it's only you
and him here?

232
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,256
He here now?

233
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:00,794
He's just out back.

234
00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:05,133
Tendin' to the hogs.

235
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:08,268
Oh, yeah?

236
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:13,640
Well, go fetch him.

237
00:33:27,955 --> 00:33:29,689
Quit mov... moving!

238
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,659
Right now, I don't
want to hurt you.

239
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:34,360
I don't want to hurt you.
Stop moving!

240
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:37,297
Where'd you put my gun
and my satchel? Listen to me!

241
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:38,799
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, mister.

242
00:33:38,832 --> 00:33:39,766
Don't you lie to me!

243
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,169
What'd you do
with my gun and my satchel?

244
00:33:48,307 --> 00:33:51,811
[cries out]

245
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,365
Pa!

246
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:17,503
How'd he get loose?

247
00:34:17,537 --> 00:34:18,739
H-He wriggled free.

248
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,874
Wriggled free?

249
00:34:20,907 --> 00:34:23,878
And got hold of my knife
I left on the bedstand.

250
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:26,847
Well, that's on the both of us.

251
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:30,484
Help me tie the son of a
bitch back up.

252
00:34:43,597 --> 00:34:45,698
[sharp gasps]

253
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:47,434

[audibly straining]

256
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:00,914
Okay.

257
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:05,785
You better think long and hard
on what you got yourself into.

258
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:08,655
Funny, I was about
to tell you the same thing.

259
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,927
What you aimin' to do with that?

260
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:16,663
Gonna dig that
bullet out of you,

261
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,765
maybe get some answers
in the process.

262
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,034
I like what I hear,

263
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:24,372
I might be inclined to give you
something to ease the pain.

264
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:29,976
[Curry grunts]

265
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,912
No.
[grunts]

266
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:34,948
No!

267
00:35:35,948 --> 00:35:37,784
Okay! Listen, listen!

268
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:39,453
No!

269
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:41,621
Let's start with you
tellin' me who you are.

270
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:44,457
[shrieks] I'm law!
I'm a goddamn lawman!

271
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,525
[Curry cries out]

272
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:48,495
He ain't no lawman, Pa,
he was fixin' to kill me.

273
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:49,963
Ready for some whisky?

274
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:52,566
I just told you... I'm law.

275
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,302
[Curry shrieks]

276
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,369
Ask him about the money.

277
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,872
What money?

278
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:00,841
He asked me about it.

279
00:36:01,941 --> 00:36:03,776
Listen. Listen to me.

280
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:04,811
Okay, listen.

281
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:07,915
What's a shot lawman doin'
with a satchel full of cash?

282
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:09,682
Listen!
[pained groan]

283
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:11,684
Listen! If you got a
brain in your head,

284
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:13,553
you need to get
yourself and your boy

285
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:15,021
out of here fast as you can.

286
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:16,490
You hear me?

287
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:22,629
No.

288
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:24,765
Oh, no! No, no!

289
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:26,967
[Curry screams]

290
00:36:30,704 --> 00:36:34,073
[screaming continues]

291
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:37,610
[screaming subsides]

292
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,116
At least we know you won't die

293
00:36:42,148 --> 00:36:44,451
'fore I find out what I
want to know.

294
00:36:51,825 --> 00:36:52,960
Oh God.

295
00:36:56,496 --> 00:36:57,831
Let me have a little more.

296
00:36:57,863 --> 00:36:59,932
Let me...
[panting]

297
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:01,568
[distant horse whinnies]

298
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,572
Riders.

299
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:12,579
Come on, cut me loose.
Come on, cut me loose.

300
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:14,747
[pained cry]

301
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,517
Listen, they gon' be
three of 'em.

302
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:21,421
One's a Mexican.

303
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:23,890
The other's an ugly
son of a bitch

304
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:25,626
with a thick beard.

305
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:26,794
And their leader...

306
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:29,764
their leader looks like a man
you don't want to mess with.

307
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:32,465
And believe me, you don't.

308
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:34,034
Keep back from the window.

309
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:37,171
If you want to live,
you gotta turn me loose

310
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:38,472
and give me my gun, hear?

311
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:40,773
He's lyin'.

312
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:42,810
I said keep back.

313
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,911
Go on.

314
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:09,569
[shell casings clatter]

315
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:40,100
Can I help you?

316
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:42,268
I'm Sheriff Sam Ketchum.

317
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:44,004
These here are my deputies.

318
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,907
We've been scoutin'
for a man on the run.

319
00:38:46,939 --> 00:38:49,476
Lately goes by the
name of Curry.

320
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:51,845
Been shot.

321
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:56,516
Six foot, brown hair,
said to be handsome,

322
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,051
though most would
want him credited

323
00:38:58,084 --> 00:38:59,153
for nothing but devilry.

324
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:04,724
What I do know is,
he's dangerous.

325
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:07,760
You seen anybody around here
answers that description?

326
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:12,131
Say you're a sheriff?
How's it I don't recognize you?

327
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:14,735
We're from way over
in Woods County.

328
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,137
Now, this Curry we're
looking for,

329
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:18,639
he's got a warrant on him there

330
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:20,840
in Missouri and Tennessee.

331
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:24,043
Might also claim he's the law.

332
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:26,780
He's got a history of
such chicanery.

333
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:30,851
Far from it. He's a killer.

334
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:32,619
He will kill again.

335
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,256
You're not fixin' to shoot

336
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:38,057
any of us with that pistol,
are you?

337
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:41,794
So far I got no reason to.

338
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:44,130
[Ketchum]
That's good news.

339
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:52,238
You'll want to think 'fore you
raise that thing up, farmer.

340
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:54,674
Nothing to be
worried about here, friend.

341
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:57,211
Just a little project
I'm working on, that's all.

342
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:01,181
How many people live out here?

343
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:04,351
What difference is that to you?

344
00:40:04,383 --> 00:40:07,353
I'm trying to make sure
you're safe, is all.

345
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:09,122
Wouldn't seem to be
your business,

346
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,758
seeing as how you're
from Woods County.

347
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:14,927
You married?

348
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:16,664
Saw a grave over there.

349
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:20,066
My wife.

350
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,970
Died ten years back
from tuberculosis.

351
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:27,174
My condolences.

352
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:31,210
Horrible way to go.

353
00:40:31,244 --> 00:40:33,713
[whispering]
Tell 'em, Pa. Tell 'em!

354
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:36,250
Marie Hobbs McCarty,
the marker said.

355
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:39,052
Your last name McCarty?

356
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:40,119
That's right.

357
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,590
First name?

358
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:47,627
Henry.

359
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:51,932
So Hobbs was her people,
I'm guessing.

360
00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:55,302
'Cause I noticed a Hobbs ranch
to the east of here.

361
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:56,603
[Henry]
Her brothers.

362
00:40:57,704 --> 00:40:58,738
Uh-huh.

363
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:02,242
Well, from the looks of things,

364
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:04,010
you've been out here a
good many years.

365
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:07,615
Nice situation.

366
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:10,750
All nestled up here
in the hills.

367
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:12,218
Hard to see from a distance.

368
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:16,657
What's any of this got to do
with the man you're lookin' for?

369
00:41:17,756 --> 00:41:19,159
Not much, I'll grant you.

370
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:24,398
Long time ago, uh...

371
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:29,035
was a fella caused some trouble
down Arizona, New Mexico way.

372
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:31,838
Heard he went by the
name McCarty.

373
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:35,842
I was wondering if he
might be your kin.

374
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,313
You got the wrong
pig by the ear.

375
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:41,014
Meaning?

376
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:44,818
I don't know no McCartys
anywhere but here,

377
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:46,919
and all my kin is deceased.

378
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,756
Now I got chores to tend to

379
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:53,392
and scant wood to
cook my supper.

380
00:41:53,425 --> 00:41:56,028
I ain't seen the man
you're after.

381
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:58,031
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

382
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:00,700
Be sure to alert the
good Sheriff

383
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,936
in Chickasha if I should
run across him.

384
00:42:06,305 --> 00:42:07,307
Well, then.

385
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:09,943
I thank you for your help.

386
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:14,414
Looks like another dead end,
boys.

387
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,952
You be sure to lock your
doors tonight.

388
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,956
Stay safe.

389
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:27,927
Come on.

390
00:42:50,082 --> 00:42:51,851
Now you're inclined to
hang onto that?

391
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:53,120
I thought you might be needin'
help.

392
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,921
You wanna tell me how
this got fired?

393
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:57,157
Honest, Pa.

394
00:42:57,189 --> 00:42:58,325
Don't you lie to me!

395
00:42:59,526 --> 00:43:02,229
I wanted to know what it's like.

396
00:43:02,262 --> 00:43:07,033
I am the only boy for 50 miles
that's never fired one.

397
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:09,401
You won't even let me
lay hand on your old shotgun.

398
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:13,105
So if you can't teach me proper,
I gotta do it myself.

399
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:17,477
You get into my things again,
I will crack your crust!

400
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,178
[soft sobs]

401
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:22,248
You're a stupid,
worthless old man.

402
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:25,217
A whole life, and nothin'
to show for it

403
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:26,887
but this rundown old farm

404
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:28,954
and a boy who's gonna
leave you alone to die

405
00:43:28,988 --> 00:43:30,858
as soon as he's able.

406
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:44,771
Let me guess.

407
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:46,907
You gon' tell me that he ain't

408
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:49,075
the sheriff of Woods County,
you are.

409
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:51,544
They ain't lawmen,
they're bank robbers.

410
00:43:51,577 --> 00:43:53,780
Well, what's left of them,
anyway.

411
00:43:55,914 --> 00:43:59,084
Knocked over the Adams Express.

412
00:43:59,117 --> 00:44:01,153
Me and my deputies gave chase,
killed two of 'em,

413
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,555
including the one
carrying the loot.

414
00:44:02,588 --> 00:44:04,523
Bank robbers wearin' badges?

415
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:06,193
That they took off
me and my men.

416
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:08,928
He's the one
impersonating the law.

417
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,332
But you made off with the money.

418
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:15,469
Hell, yeah, I grabbed it.

419
00:44:17,202 --> 00:44:20,006
Then why ain't you back with it
in Woods County?

420
00:44:20,472 --> 00:44:24,076
Oh, I don't know.
Why does it look like?

421
00:44:27,213 --> 00:44:28,281
And my first priority was

422
00:44:28,314 --> 00:44:30,050
getting away from
that bunch alive.

423
00:44:30,082 --> 00:44:32,084
That's why I rode like hell
till I couldn't no more.

424
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:34,153
There's the last thing
I remembered,

425
00:44:34,186 --> 00:44:35,488
till I woke up here.

426
00:44:37,456 --> 00:44:38,557
Look, I know what I'm saying

427
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,125
sounds ridiculous to
you and all.

428
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:41,361
That it does.

429
00:44:41,394 --> 00:44:42,896
Why they didn't shoot you dead

430
00:44:42,928 --> 00:44:44,497
on the spot just now,
I don't know.

431
00:44:45,497 --> 00:44:47,200
But I can guarantee you...

432
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:49,903
they'll be back.

433
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:46,191
Only thing I can't figure

434
00:45:46,224 --> 00:45:47,259
is why the old man

435
00:45:47,293 --> 00:45:49,463
would risk his neck
for a stranger.

436
00:45:50,162 --> 00:45:52,231
Maybe he got offered a
cut of the money.

437
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:55,302
Something tells me
that ain't it.

438
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,439
Any one of us could have
taken him out.

439
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:02,241
Which is what we should do now.

440
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:06,113
- Ride up, finish it.
- Not just yet.

441
00:46:09,448 --> 00:46:11,651
'Cause of some shaky old farmer?

442
00:46:11,684 --> 00:46:15,421
He didn't hold that pistol
like any farmer I've ever seen.

443
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:18,190
There are three of us.

444
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:22,394
We don't run up in a bank,
or ride up on a stage

445
00:46:22,427 --> 00:46:23,930
- without knowing who's in it.
- [Duggan spits]

446
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:27,400
We know Curry's in there.
With our money!

447
00:46:27,432 --> 00:46:29,101
Which is why you're
going to reconnoiter

448
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:31,537
that so-called farmer's place

449
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,305
and make sure Curry
don't skedaddle.

450
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:35,207
[spits] Gladly.

451
00:46:36,608 --> 00:46:38,678
Don't make a move till
we get there.

452
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:41,213
Fine.

453
00:46:42,782 --> 00:46:45,052
- [Ketchum] Duggan.
- I said fine.

454
00:46:50,756 --> 00:46:52,059
[Ketchum sniffs]

455
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:56,262
Come sunup, you and me
will head into Chickasha,

456
00:46:56,294 --> 00:46:57,563
hire some guns.

457
00:46:58,363 --> 00:46:59,599
Understood.

458
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:05,104
On the way, we'll pay a call
on Farmer Hobbs...

459
00:47:05,738 --> 00:47:07,674
find out if he's got
anything interesting

460
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:10,576
to tell us about ol'
Henry McCarty.

461
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,312
- [insects chirping]
- [horses approaching]

462
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,006
[rooster crows]

463
00:48:01,693 --> 00:48:03,697
[roosters clucking]

464
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,035
[Wyatt sniffs]

465
00:48:12,438 --> 00:48:15,175
[Henry] Wyatt.
Come on in.

466
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:19,512
- [Wyatt] I'm almost finished.
- Leave it till morning.

467
00:48:21,847 --> 00:48:22,715
Come on.

468
00:48:32,858 --> 00:48:34,561
[door opens, closes]

469
00:48:43,702 --> 00:48:45,072
[Curry slurps]

470
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:47,740
[Curry clears throat]

471
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:52,279
[Curry slurps, gulps]

472
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:56,582
It'd be a damn sight easier
if I could feed myself.

473
00:48:58,217 --> 00:48:59,419
[Curry slurps]

474
00:48:59,452 --> 00:49:02,222
Be a damn sight easier
not to feed you at all.

475
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:21,775
- You and me ever met?
- That I'd remember.

476
00:49:24,644 --> 00:49:26,213
How long you been a sheriff?

477
00:49:30,383 --> 00:49:35,255
- I'd say onto 18 years now.
- How'd you get your start?

478
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:38,191
I was a deputy for Big
Bill Thompson

479
00:49:38,224 --> 00:49:39,258
in Baxter Springs.

480
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:44,296
Baxter Springs.
Baxter Springs, Missouri?

481
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:49,235
- Kansas.
- Skinny fella, big ears?

482
00:49:51,604 --> 00:49:52,872
Heavyset.

483
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:54,841
Missing part of his
left ear from

484
00:49:54,874 --> 00:49:57,343
a drunk miner taking a
potshot at him.

485
00:49:57,376 --> 00:50:00,814
- I heard it was a drunk whore.
- Oh, you did?

486
00:50:03,548 --> 00:50:05,751
Which part of Baxter Springs
you live in?

487
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:11,356
A boarding house.
Out near Grant's Stage Station.

488
00:50:11,389 --> 00:50:13,159
What was the landlady's name?

489
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:16,529
She weren't no lady.
[chuckles softly]

490
00:50:18,231 --> 00:50:20,534
She a nasty ol' cuss
named Hannah.

491
00:50:23,235 --> 00:50:25,904
You ever run into a
George Crook?

492
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:28,307
You mean General George?

493
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,275
Sumbitch dedicated his life

494
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:32,445
to driving the Caddo out
of the Territory.

495
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:44,858
[silverware clinks]

496
00:50:45,957 --> 00:50:47,327
[Curry slurps]

497
00:50:50,963 --> 00:50:53,867
How in the hell did you end up
in Baxter Springs?

498
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:57,903
Well, like every other fool

499
00:50:57,936 --> 00:51:00,272
dreaming of easy riches
and digging for tin.

500
00:51:00,972 --> 00:51:02,608
Till I realized there
weren't none.

501
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:04,943
Just a bunch of ghost stories
about a mine

502
00:51:04,977 --> 00:51:06,579
near Smokey Hill River.

503
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:09,215
Then I... I was broke.
Work was hard to come by.

504
00:51:09,615 --> 00:51:11,751
I'm lucky Big Bill took
a liking to me.

505
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:15,354
Otherwise I... I don't know
what would have come of me.

506
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:21,461
I... I'm sorry I jumped
your boy before.

507
00:51:23,296 --> 00:51:25,865
I woke up in a strange place,
didn't know who he was...

508
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:29,002
I was being held hostage
in some hideout.

509
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:31,371
This look like a hideout to you?

510
00:51:33,905 --> 00:51:35,909
I overheard what he
said earlier.

511
00:51:36,909 --> 00:51:38,644
He didn't mean any of that.

512
00:51:40,512 --> 00:51:41,614
Yes, he did.

513
00:51:53,758 --> 00:51:54,860
[slurps]

514
00:51:55,827 --> 00:51:56,929
[sighs]

515
00:51:58,097 --> 00:52:02,401
I'll give you one hand free.
Don't make me take it off.

516
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:03,869
All right.

517
00:52:07,006 --> 00:52:08,475
[sighs]

518
00:52:09,642 --> 00:52:11,011
All right.

519
00:52:12,677 --> 00:52:15,414
- [Curry slurps]
- [silverware clinks]

520
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,823
[Curry groans, slurps, sighs]

521
00:52:26,624 --> 00:52:28,294
[Curry chuckles]

522
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:32,798
Was farming what your daddy did?

523
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:37,303
My daddy died when I was 3,
up in Kansas.

524
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:40,774
And he did near everything
but work the land.

525
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,976
I was orphaned at 15.

526
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:47,981
That's 13 years longer
than I knew my folks.

527
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:51,817
[Henry]
Ah. Whereabouts you grow up?

528
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:54,854
New Mexico.

529
00:52:56,454 --> 00:52:58,490
- Which part?
- Fort Sumner.

530
00:52:58,523 --> 00:53:00,326
Born and raised.
You heard of it?

531
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,499
Where Billy the Kid was shot,
wasn't it?

532
00:53:09,802 --> 00:53:11,604
Main reason anyone know it.

533
00:53:13,606 --> 00:53:15,608
[glass filling]

534
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:18,877
I was there the night
it happened.

535
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:23,950
How's that?

536
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:25,985
I was just a boy.

537
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:27,153
I used to make what
money I could

538
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:30,622
doing chores for a fella
by the name of Peter Maxwell.

539
00:53:31,122 --> 00:53:33,892
Same Peter Maxwell
put the Kid up for the night.

540
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:35,660
Same Peter Maxwell
tipped off Garrett

541
00:53:35,693 --> 00:53:37,462
and his deputies, Poe
and McKinney,

542
00:53:37,496 --> 00:53:39,131
the Kid was holed up there.

543
00:53:39,164 --> 00:53:40,832
I was sweeping the stalls.

544
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:43,469
When I saw Garrett walk in
the house, I...

545
00:53:44,035 --> 00:53:45,438
I don't think nothing of it.

546
00:53:46,905 --> 00:53:50,409
But Billy wasn't in there.
Not then, leastways.

547
00:53:50,443 --> 00:53:52,445
- Know how I know?
- How?

548
00:53:52,477 --> 00:53:54,046
He was barefoot
in his shin sleeves,

549
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,747
cutting the meat off
a deer carcass

550
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,616
not 20 feet from where
I was working.

551
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:03,956
I saw him peer through
the barn door,

552
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:06,392
and he saw Poe and McKinney
on the porch there.

553
00:54:07,726 --> 00:54:10,530
He stopped carving,
looked me dead in my eye.

554
00:54:10,563 --> 00:54:14,166
He said, "Keep your head down,
you'll be all right."

555
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,669
So Billy went straight to
Maxwell's room,

556
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:20,407
realized pretty quick
it ain't just Maxwell in there.

557
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:25,544
He called out,
<i>"¿Quien es? ¿Quien es?"</i>

558
00:54:25,577 --> 00:54:27,880
'Cause Billy spoke Spanish
as good as a Mexican.

559
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:30,917
Pat's answer?

560
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:35,955
Two shots. One wide of the mark,
and the other one in the chest.

561
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:42,428
That was the end of
Billy the Kid.

562
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:47,633
And you seen it all.

563
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,035
I most certainly did.

564
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:50,870
Saw the Kid's body get
hauled off too,

565
00:54:50,903 --> 00:54:52,105
wrapped in a bloody sheet.

566
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:55,907
Enough to teach me
that ain't no life for me.

567
00:54:55,941 --> 00:54:58,845
I'd rather stop this crazy
than be part of it anyway.

568
00:55:12,557 --> 00:55:13,992
[knife scraping]

569
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:23,136
[knife cutting rope]

570
00:55:24,235 --> 00:55:25,637
[Henry] Well...

571
00:55:25,671 --> 00:55:27,173
[chuckles] Damn.

572
00:55:27,206 --> 00:55:29,041
If I knew all it took
was a good story

573
00:55:29,073 --> 00:55:30,276
for you to cut me loose.

574
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:31,744
[knife clatters]

575
00:55:33,012 --> 00:55:35,548
You well enough to stay upright
in the saddle?

576
00:55:37,615 --> 00:55:39,885
- Not hardly.
- I want you out of here.

577
00:55:40,686 --> 00:55:43,122
I suppose waiting till sunup
ain't an option?

578
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:45,658
If I was alone out here,
it'd be different.

579
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:47,893
Well, then, I guess I'm ready.

580
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:50,963
Good.

581
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:55,635
Take it.

582
00:56:01,573 --> 00:56:02,775
I'll fetch your loot.

583
00:56:04,776 --> 00:56:06,646
[footsteps]

584
00:56:08,646 --> 00:56:12,251
[gunshots]

585
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:18,925
[gunshot, glass shatters]

586
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:20,959
[Curry grunts, groans]

587
00:56:24,729 --> 00:56:26,832
[Curry pants]

588
00:56:31,202 --> 00:56:33,072
[effort grunts]

589
00:56:34,872 --> 00:56:37,175
[gunfire continues]

590
00:56:38,343 --> 00:56:40,146
- Pa?
- Wyatt! Get down!

591
00:56:40,178 --> 00:56:41,581
[Wyatt pants]

592
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,715
- [gunshot]
- [glass breaking]

593
00:56:43,749 --> 00:56:44,817
I-I think I'm all right.

594
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:47,986
Is... is he hit?

595
00:56:48,954 --> 00:56:50,222
[pistol slides across floor]

596
00:56:55,693 --> 00:56:58,230
He just passed out.
Give me that.

597
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:01,100
I'm better with it
than you think.

598
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:03,002
Not until I teach you proper.

599
00:57:03,035 --> 00:57:04,837
- I've taught myself
- Shush.

600
00:57:06,372 --> 00:57:07,840
[softly] Now, where'd
you get to?

601
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:12,845
[quiet movements below]

602
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:16,615
- [Wyatt] He's under the house.
- [Henry] Shh.

603
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,856
[wood creaking]

604
00:57:28,394 --> 00:57:30,763
[cocks pistol]

605
00:57:38,671 --> 00:57:39,772
- [wood creaking]
- [gunshot]

606
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,145
[creaking resumes]

607
00:57:50,282 --> 00:57:52,151
[softly] I hope you got
good enough with this.

608
00:57:54,153 --> 00:57:56,255
God forbid it happens,
but shooting a man

609
00:57:56,287 --> 00:57:58,323
is different than
hitting a target...

610
00:57:58,356 --> 00:58:00,793
a line you can't
cross back over.

611
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:01,626
I know that.

612
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,329
You couldn't until
you've done it.

613
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:06,798
If he comes in here...

614
00:58:07,832 --> 00:58:09,101
you pull that trigger.

615
00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:12,238
Aim for the chest.

616
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:15,173
And keep firing
until you hit it.

617
00:58:36,294 --> 00:58:37,796
[gunshots]

618
00:58:38,764 --> 00:58:40,932
- [gunshots continue]
- Where you going?

619
00:58:43,202 --> 00:58:44,404
[Wyatt grunts]

620
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,140
[door unlocks, opens]

621
00:58:55,814 --> 00:58:57,183
[Duggan]
Son of a bitch!

622
00:58:57,816 --> 00:58:58,951
Cocksucker!

623
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:01,186
- Fuck.
- [shells clattering]

624
00:59:03,222 --> 00:59:04,823
[shotgun clicks]

625
00:59:08,459 --> 00:59:09,961
[Duggan] Shit.

626
00:59:09,994 --> 00:59:12,230
[indistinct chatter]

627
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:14,733
[Duggan grunts]

628
00:59:16,401 --> 00:59:19,238
[Duggan groans, strains]

629
00:59:20,238 --> 00:59:21,974
[thunder crashes]

630
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:24,243
[Duggan grunts]

- [Duggan screams]
- [bone breaking]

636
00:59:38,923 --> 00:59:42,227
- [Duggan gasps]
- Where's the others? They close?

637
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,496
[Duggan] Go to hell.

638
00:59:43,528 --> 00:59:44,863
- [Henry strains]
- [Duggan chokes]

639
00:59:44,896 --> 00:59:46,331
[Henry] I've been here
too often to let

640
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:49,334
a man of your caliber
overhaul my baggage.

641
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:51,236
- [Henry pants]
- [Duggan gasps]

642
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:54,072
Answer me, or it ends for
you right now.

643
00:59:54,106 --> 00:59:55,441
[Duggan breathes shakily]

644
00:59:55,474 --> 00:59:57,075
[Duggan] Go to hell,
you bastard.

645
00:59:57,108 --> 00:59:59,244
[Duggan whimpers, gasps]

646
01:00:01,412 --> 01:00:03,215
[Duggan struggles]

647
01:00:04,182 --> 01:00:06,284

[thunder crashes]

655
01:00:57,035 --> 01:00:58,871
He was fixin' to kill us both.

656
01:01:01,472 --> 01:01:02,541
I saw.

657
01:01:03,876 --> 01:01:06,078
Probably here to watch
and got greedy.

658
01:01:07,178 --> 01:01:09,182
- [thunder rumbles]
- The others will be coming.

659
01:01:12,383 --> 01:01:14,486
First thing, we gotta get rid
of this body.

660
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,389
How we gonna do that?

661
01:01:22,494 --> 01:01:23,930
We ain't.

662
01:01:29,501 --> 01:01:31,871
[door creaks, closes]

663
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:48,521

- [animal squeals]
- [pigs snort]

665
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:24,523
[Henry] I know it don't
feel like it.

666
01:02:25,323 --> 01:02:27,425
You're lucky it just grazed ya.

667
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:34,233
If you know I found that gun,

668
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:36,903
you know I saw what's
in the back of that closet.

669
01:02:39,371 --> 01:02:40,338
Who are you?

670
01:02:42,506 --> 01:02:43,642
I'm who I am.

671
01:02:45,242 --> 01:02:48,146
Aren't you always preaching
about being honest?

672
01:02:48,713 --> 01:02:50,615
The truth will set you free?

673
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:54,921
I've never lied to you.

674
01:03:03,662 --> 01:03:05,297
Isn't not telling me
the whole story

675
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:06,564
the same damn thing?

676
01:03:12,604 --> 01:03:15,408
I've done things
I wish I could take back.

677
01:03:16,307 --> 01:03:19,077
A long time before you.
Before your ma.

678
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:23,182
Things that
you got no business hearing.

679
01:03:24,316 --> 01:03:27,453
How am I supposed to respect you
if you ain't respecting me?

680
01:03:27,485 --> 01:03:29,487
I am respecting you.

681
01:03:30,722 --> 01:03:32,457
And if you don't
understand that,

682
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:34,360
you ain't heard a
word I just said.

683
01:03:35,494 --> 01:03:39,064
No, I heard it. I just
don't believe a bit of it.

[Billy the Kid]
<i>Keep your head down.</i>

688
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:25,209
Keep your head down.
You'll be all right.

689
01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:26,277
[echoing] <i>You'll be all right.</i>

[horses approaching]

699
01:06:25,329 --> 01:06:26,764
- Whoa.
- [chickens clucking]

01:06:30,501 --> 01:06:32,204
[distant sheep bleating]

701
01:06:34,905 --> 01:06:36,674
- Morning
- [Al] Morning.

702
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:40,678
- Something I can help you with?
- I sure hope so.

703
01:06:42,247 --> 01:06:45,851
Nice place you got here.
Peaceful. Quiet.

704
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:49,521
Bird hunting.

705
01:06:50,454 --> 01:06:52,757
Nothing quite like the
flush of the bevy.

706
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:56,162
You must be quite the shot.

707
01:06:58,563 --> 01:06:59,664
Do what I can.

708
01:07:00,664 --> 01:07:01,833
I envy you.

709
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,503
I don't get to go out hunting

710
01:07:04,535 --> 01:07:05,938
as much as I'd like
to these days.

711
01:07:07,439 --> 01:07:08,908
Something I can help
you with, mister?

712
01:07:11,508 --> 01:07:13,411
My daddy used to hunt pheasant.

713
01:07:13,979 --> 01:07:16,448
It was always
my damn job to clean 'em.

714
01:07:18,316 --> 01:07:21,387
Oh, cutting the skin on
the breast, peeling it back.

715
01:07:22,988 --> 01:07:25,424
But over time, I
figured the best way

716
01:07:25,456 --> 01:07:27,458
to get rid of their innards...

717
01:07:28,593 --> 01:07:32,464
was to split the bird's back.
Get to 'em that way.

718
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:36,767
Is that what you find?

719
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,203
Look, I don't...

720
01:07:38,769 --> 01:07:40,605
mean to be un-neighborly, but...

721
01:07:41,006 --> 01:07:43,642
But get to the point? Sure.

722
01:07:45,876 --> 01:07:47,979
I wanted to ask you a
couple questions about, uh,

723
01:07:48,012 --> 01:07:49,914
your brother-in-law.

724
01:07:51,582 --> 01:07:53,351
Well, what concern is
he of yours?

725
01:07:54,485 --> 01:07:56,221
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

726
01:07:57,354 --> 01:07:59,457
You see, I got this
crazy idea...

727
01:08:00,457 --> 01:08:01,860
there might be more to ol'
McCarty

728
01:08:01,892 --> 01:08:02,794
than meets the eye.

729
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:05,831
[sighs] You supposed be some
kind of lawman or something?

730
01:08:06,564 --> 01:08:08,300
Something like that.

731
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:10,970
Well, I think it's
time you left.

732
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:13,771
Well, we came here for
some answers.

733
01:08:15,807 --> 01:08:17,876
We ain't leaving till I get 'em.

734
01:08:17,909 --> 01:08:19,245
That so?

735
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:25,517
- I should... [grunts]
- [horse neighs]

736
01:08:30,054 --> 01:08:33,291
[sighs] Now how the hell
we gonna pick his ass up?

737
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,464
[Curry groans, whimpers]

738
01:08:40,665 --> 01:08:42,701
[Curry groans, exhales]

739
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:45,903
[labored breath]
Okay. Okay, thank you.

740
01:08:47,071 --> 01:08:48,673
[Curry groans]

741
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,777
- [bed creaks]
- [Curry strains]

742
01:08:53,678 --> 01:08:55,680
[labored breath]

743
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,616
[Curry whimpers]

744
01:09:00,384 --> 01:09:02,486
- Oh, God. Okay.
- [bed creaks]

745
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:06,057
I'm no good to travel. I'm not.

746
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:09,428
You take the boy,
you get out of here.

747
01:09:10,661 --> 01:09:11,829
When Ketchum and his men arrive,

748
01:09:11,862 --> 01:09:13,499
I'll hold them off as
long as I can.

749
01:09:14,398 --> 01:09:16,035
- The hell with that!
- Wyatt.

750
01:09:17,035 --> 01:09:18,671
We got guns.

751
01:09:19,403 --> 01:09:21,473
You already killed one of
them barehanded.

752
01:09:21,505 --> 01:09:24,375
Fill a pack. We're leaving.

753
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:25,876
[labored breath]

754
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,579
[Henry, softly]
I'm warning you.

755
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:29,682
[scoffs softly]

756
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:37,755
[Curry panting]

757
01:09:37,789 --> 01:09:39,858
[birds chirping]

758
01:09:55,005 --> 01:09:56,508
He's back.

759
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:07,384
Leave the rest.

760
01:10:07,419 --> 01:10:09,521
We can't just leave
him here to die.

761
01:10:09,554 --> 01:10:10,856
I am damn sure not
gonna lose you

762
01:10:10,888 --> 01:10:12,656
over something that
ain't our fight.

763
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:13,892
Your pa's right.

764
01:10:13,924 --> 01:10:15,826
I am old enough to make
my own decisions,

765
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,829
whether you are ready
to accept that or not.

766
01:10:17,862 --> 01:10:20,565
Yeah. [grunts]
This is mine to finish.

767
01:10:20,598 --> 01:10:22,034
Go on, now. I'll be all right.

768
01:10:33,044 --> 01:10:35,147
[horses whinnying]

769
01:10:46,523 --> 01:10:48,927
[horses whinnying]

770
01:10:54,531 --> 01:10:55,400
Whoa.

771
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:02,640
[shouts] Curry!
Anybody home?

772
01:11:04,075 --> 01:11:06,077
[shouts] You gentlemen
need something?

773
01:11:07,077 --> 01:11:08,914
We're here for our fugitive.

774
01:11:09,546 --> 01:11:11,784
[Henry] I told you yesterday
I ain't seen him.

775
01:11:12,983 --> 01:11:15,653
[Ketchum] My intuition tells
me that's not true.

776
01:11:17,088 --> 01:11:18,790
I'll make it easy...

777
01:11:18,822 --> 01:11:21,927
you hand him over,
we let you and the boy go free.

778
01:11:23,193 --> 01:11:26,531
[Ketchum] The other option is,
we take him.

779
01:11:26,563 --> 01:11:28,133
And you and the boy die.

780
01:11:29,567 --> 01:11:31,636
You take that deal.
[breathes shakily]

781
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:33,572
I signed up for this,
you didn't.

782
01:11:38,242 --> 01:11:40,611
[Ketchum] See your horses
are already saddled.

783
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:42,848
You can just ride on
out of here.

784
01:11:47,852 --> 01:11:49,621
You and I both know
we'll be dead

785
01:11:49,653 --> 01:11:50,988
before we mount our horses.

786
01:11:54,224 --> 01:11:57,562
[shouts] 'Fore this turns
into some kinda brigasee,

787
01:11:57,594 --> 01:11:59,798
why don't me and you
settle this,

788
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:01,098
knuckle and skull.

789
01:12:01,131 --> 01:12:02,567
[laughs]

790
01:12:04,001 --> 01:12:06,205
You got a lot of fight
for a farmer.

791
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:09,140
That ain't the way
this plays out.

792
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:12,478
[shouts] Bring him up!

793
01:12:25,089 --> 01:12:26,158
Al?

794
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:48,981
[shells rattling]

795
01:12:52,183 --> 01:12:54,052
Listen to me. What's
gonna happen

796
01:12:54,085 --> 01:12:55,220
will happen quick.

797
01:12:55,253 --> 01:12:58,255
I'll stall long as I can,
but I want you to sneak out back

798
01:12:58,289 --> 01:13:00,125
- and hole up at Roger's Mill...
- [cocks gun]

799
01:13:00,157 --> 01:13:01,660
...and wait for me there.

800
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:04,094
Only use this if you have to.

801
01:13:04,128 --> 01:13:06,164
- Let me fight.
- I can't do this right

802
01:13:06,196 --> 01:13:07,998
if I'm worried about
protecting you.

803
01:13:08,031 --> 01:13:09,634
[Curry] Just turn me over.

804
01:13:10,602 --> 01:13:12,571
You don't, they're gonna
kill us all. [breathes shakily]

805
01:13:12,603 --> 01:13:13,371
You and me both know

806
01:13:13,405 --> 01:13:15,005
they're fixin' to do
that anyway.

807
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:17,643
And yet you expect me
to run out into sure gunfire?

808
01:13:18,076 --> 01:13:19,177
[Curry] Your boy's right.

809
01:13:25,116 --> 01:13:26,618
Stay inside.

810
01:13:26,651 --> 01:13:28,687
Stay away from the window.

811
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,222
You have to shoot,
aim for the chest, and...

812
01:13:31,254 --> 01:13:32,957
Keep firing till I
hit something.

813
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:40,098
[door opens]

814
01:13:43,701 --> 01:13:45,571
[door closes]

815
01:13:50,974 --> 01:13:52,177
[Ketchum] I've had
some suspicions

816
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:54,580
about who you are,
Henry McCarty.

817
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:01,586
I got to admit, that name
sticks in me like a thorn.

818
01:14:01,986 --> 01:14:04,256
My curiosity was aroused.

819
01:14:05,756 --> 01:14:08,259
I was hoping Al here
might shed some light.

820
01:14:09,994 --> 01:14:11,830
He wouldn't say shit.

821
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:14,933
Even after my boys were...

822
01:14:14,965 --> 01:14:18,769
what's the word?
Uh, emphatic in their question.

823
01:14:21,004 --> 01:14:23,074
[Ketchum] You probably
concluded I'm no sheriff.

824
01:14:24,008 --> 01:14:26,010
Nor are these men my deputies.

825
01:14:27,077 --> 01:14:28,847
Not a one of us had spent time

826
01:14:28,879 --> 01:14:31,015
in Woods County
before a month ago.

827
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:33,619
What about you?

828
01:14:35,018 --> 01:14:36,354
Where'd you come from?

829
01:14:37,421 --> 01:14:39,924
Every place on earth but this.

830
01:14:42,826 --> 01:14:44,094
So be it.

831
01:14:44,128 --> 01:14:45,296
Last offer.

832
01:14:47,165 --> 01:14:48,900
This tongue-tied piece of shit

833
01:14:48,933 --> 01:14:50,769
for Sheriff Curry in there
and the money.

834
01:14:51,268 --> 01:14:52,704
You get what you want.

835
01:14:53,103 --> 01:14:54,305
I get what I want.

836
01:14:54,972 --> 01:14:57,942
We go our separate ways
without blood spilled.

837
01:14:58,976 --> 01:15:01,713
Not yours, not mine.

838
01:15:02,245 --> 01:15:04,148
Not that boy of yours I
see surveilling

839
01:15:04,182 --> 01:15:05,751
all this through that window.

840
01:15:08,018 --> 01:15:09,186
If I wanted bloodshed,

841
01:15:09,219 --> 01:15:12,156
I'd have busted in there guns
a-blazin' a long time ago.

842
01:15:13,491 --> 01:15:15,127
I believe you know that.

843
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,863
You leave my brother-in-law
right where he is.

844
01:15:19,731 --> 01:15:22,901
Turn and ride your asses
off my property.

845
01:15:22,933 --> 01:15:26,137
You do that, and I'll
let you live.

846
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:28,740
[chuckles, mutters indistinctly]

847
01:15:30,474 --> 01:15:32,376
You hear that, fellas?

848
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:35,046
Is that the talk of a
mild old sodbuster?

849
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:37,081
- [chuckling]
- I think not.

850
01:15:38,348 --> 01:15:39,351
Nah.

851
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:42,688
That sounds like
something else altogether.

852
01:15:44,187 --> 01:15:45,056
Hobbs!

853
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:49,093
Anything you could tell me
might change the equation here?

854
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,196
[spits]

855
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:55,467
Kiss my ass,
you long-winded son of a bitch.

856
01:15:58,803 --> 01:16:01,773
You got a pair, I'll
give you that.

857
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:06,811
Last chance, Al.

858
01:16:10,214 --> 01:16:15,954
You have no idea the hell storm
you fixin' to let loose.

859
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:20,992
Consider me properly warned.

860
01:16:27,799 --> 01:16:30,402
[Ketchum] Easy. Whoa.

861
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:35,005
Easy, fella.

862
01:16:42,412 --> 01:16:44,950
[blows] Goddamn.

863
01:16:46,317 --> 01:16:47,419
Look at that.

864
01:16:48,419 --> 01:16:50,121
I'd say she's done.

865
01:16:50,153 --> 01:16:52,156
Ain't that a thing of beauty?

866
01:16:59,563 --> 01:17:00,499
Wyatt!

867
01:17:02,532 --> 01:17:05,536
[gunfire]

868
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:06,772
Get in!

869
01:17:08,572 --> 01:17:11,241
- [gunfire continues]
- [door slams]

870
01:17:11,275 --> 01:17:12,943
- [glass shatters]
- [Curry grunts]

871
01:17:12,977 --> 01:17:15,380
- [Curry groans]
- [glass shattering]

872
01:17:16,914 --> 01:17:17,916
You still with us?

873
01:17:18,249 --> 01:17:20,485
[groans] Less of me. [grunts]

874
01:17:21,919 --> 01:17:23,889
- Whoa. Whoa.
- [glass breaking]

875
01:17:25,188 --> 01:17:27,291
[Wyatt pants, coughs]

876
01:17:28,392 --> 01:17:30,128
[pistol cocks]

877
01:17:30,161 --> 01:17:31,163
[shouts] McCarty!

878
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,065
You dead yet?

879
01:17:35,866 --> 01:17:37,134
[Henry] I sure ain't.

880
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:38,969
[Ketchum] I'm assuming the fact
I ain't seen

881
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:41,272
my man Duggan this morning

882
01:17:41,304 --> 01:17:44,075
means he must have crossed
paths with you,

883
01:17:44,107 --> 01:17:45,943
and things didn't go his way.

884
01:17:48,345 --> 01:17:51,950
Seeing as how I just killed
your man Al here,

885
01:17:51,982 --> 01:17:53,485
I'd say that squares us.

886
01:17:54,585 --> 01:17:56,120
No more games.

887
01:17:56,152 --> 01:17:58,823
