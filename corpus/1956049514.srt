Now trump has denied all of this

168
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,000
and yesterday in the oval office
he called woodward's book a work

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,060
of fiction, but that's not what
he told woodward on the phone

170
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,360
when he called him just a few
weeks ago to complain that he

171
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,830
hadn't been interviewed for the

172
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,180
book.

173
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:38,700
Woodward recorded the call and

174
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,359
trump was very complimentary.

175
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,330
I spent a lot of time on this,

176
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,500
talked to lots of people --
all right, good.

177
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,130
And as you know and are
living, we are at a pivot point

178
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,830
in history.
Right.

179
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,600
And I would have liked to
have done that and I maximized

180
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,000
my effort.
Right.

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,930
And somehow it didn't get to
you or --

182
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,660
it's really too bad because
nobody told me about it, and I

183
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,530
would have loved to have spoken
to you.

184
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,800
You know I'm very open to you.
I think you've always been fair.

trump says?

Although I guess I shouldn't be

188
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,530
surprised the same guy who can
be tricked into not signing a

189
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,600
piece of paper doesn't realize
everyone around him has a gopro

strapped to their heads.
[ Laughter ]

191
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,530
But, hey, in fairness to trump,

192
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,265
he probably didn't know he was

193
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,929
being recorded.

194
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,330

[ Laughter ]

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,230
The craziest part of this phone
call is when trump explains that

202
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,760
his aides never asked him if he

203
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,080
wanted to do an interview with

204
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:55,760
woodward because they were too

205
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,429
afraid.

206
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,760
It's a chance missed, and I do

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,360

there in terms --

Well, if you would call

Did you speak to Madeleine?

211
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,200
No, I didn't but I --
Madeleine is the key.

212
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,060
She's the secret because
she's --

213
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,900
well, I talk to raj about it.
She's the person.

214
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,560
I talked to kellyanne.
A lot of them are afraid to

215
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,730
come and talk, but you never
called for me.

216
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,460
It would have been nice, Bob, if
you called for me in my office.

217
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,960
I mean, I have a secretary.
I have two, three secretaries.

218
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,260
If you would have called
directly, a lot of people are

219
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,560
afraid.
Seth: So to recap, trump says

220
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,200
Bob woodward's book is a work of
fiction because he never spoke

221
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,360
to woodward because his aides
were too afraid to talk to him

222
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,230
about doing an interview for
woodward's book which is

223
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,700
literally called "fear."
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,530

his lies prove that he's lying.

[ Light laughter ]
"Your book called 'fear' is

226
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,230
totally inaccurate and I would
have told you that if my aides

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,960
weren't too afraid to come talk
to me.

[ Laughter and applause ]

230
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,660
For almost two year's we've had
this frustrating spectacle,

231
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,500
trump's closest aides
anonymously warning us that the

232
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,800
president they work for is
erratic and dangerous but

233
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,730
refusing to actually do anything
about it.

234
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,160
And yesterday we got the most
stunning example of that yet

235
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,900
from an anonymous op-ed in
"the New York times" titled, "I

236
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,200
am part of the resistance inside
the trump administration,"

237
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,130
warning about trump's behavior.
And now the op-ed has put trump

238
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,200
supporters in the weird position
of having to defend the

239
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,830
president's mental health.

240
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,300
Like south Carolina senator

241
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,330
Lindsey Graham who said this

man is a fool, that this man is
crazy, that there's something

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,430
wrong with Donald Trump and it's
just the people around him that

keep us safe, you don't know
what you're talking about.

there saying he's a kook or he's

of the op-ed was Lindsey Graham!

254

That would explain the paragraph

255
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,900
where he calls trump crazier
than a wet mule eating corn

[ Laughter ]

257
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,260
But this week has been a perfect
distillation of the gop's

258
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,230
complicity of the trump debacle
because even as a parade of

259
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,300
trump officials quietly warn the
public that he's unfit for

260
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,460
office, they're letting him hang
around to fill a lifetime seat

261
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,860
in the supreme court with his
hand-picked nominee

262
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,930
Brett kavanaugh.
And in his confirmation hearing

263
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,230
so far kavanaugh has been
exactly the kind of loyal

264
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,400
partisan trump would want.
For example, he's been asked a

265
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,600
series of questions that could
be crucial to the Russia

266
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,330
investigation, like can the
president pardon himself, does

267
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,300
he have to comply with a
subpoena?

268
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,760
And every time he has refused to

269
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,230
answer even those basic

270
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,659
questions.

271
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,860
President Trump claims he has
an absolute right to pardon

272
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,100
himself.
Does he?

273
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,630
The question of self-pardon
is something I've never

274
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,360
analyzed.
Can a sitting president be

275
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,160
required to respond to a
subpoena?

276
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,930
So that's a hypothetical
question.

277
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,800
Seth: No, it's not.
The president's lawyer

278
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Rudy giuliani is on TV every day
talking about how trump would

279
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,660
just ignore a subpoena.
You know, this guy, always

280
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,200

resignation letter shoved up his

ass.
[ Laughter ]

282
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,360
I mean it's mind-boggling that
we're even considering allowing

283
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,860
the president to fill a lifetime
seat on the supreme court while

284
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,730
his own aids warn the public
that he's unfit for office.

00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,700
So happy to be here.
Seth: That's why -- I have to

335
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,100
say, that's why it's so helpful
to have a clip from a movie.

336
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,430
Because I think if you heard
there was a film called

337
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,930
"peppermint," you wouldn't
naturally --

338
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,330
right?
Seth: Think it would be a

339
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,860
scene like that.
Right, you think --

340
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,300
Seth: Yeah.
No.

341
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,400
Seth: Yes, this is --
not that.

342
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,060
Seth: A very -- and I do want
to talk about the film.

343
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,360
But first, I want
congratulate -- you got a star

344
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,030
on the Hollywood walk of fame.
Congratulations.

345
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,630
[ Cheers and applause ]
Yes, I did.

346
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,500
Do you stand it?
I kind of can't believe it.

347
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,230
I saw, you know, Burt Reynolds
today.

348
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,200
Seth: Yes.
Wonderful --

349
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,300
Seth: Rest in peace.
Yeah.

350
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,830
Rest in peace.
And I saw him.

351
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,460
And I thought, "oh, my gosh.
I have a star like he does."

352
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,760
Seth: Yeah.
I mean that's like -- it's

353
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,630
still there.
It's still there right now while

354
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,260
we're talking.
Seth: It's -- yeah.

355
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,800
That's not just like --
unless they've jackhammered

356
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,960
it out.
Seth: I think your safe.

357
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,400
They do that now.
Seth: They do every now and

358
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,560
then jackhammer one out.
You know.

359
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,660
Seth: But I think you're in
the safe zone.

360
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,200
We'll see today.
Seth: Whole family come?

361
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,330
Did a lot --
the whole family came.

362
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,630
Seth: That's really great.
There were a lot of us.

363
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,930
Oh, my gosh.
Seth: That's a beautiful

364
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,130
photo.
Look how proud everybody looks.

365
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,430
Oh, yeah.
My sister, Melissa, my sister,

366
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,600
susannah, my nieces and nephews,
brothers-in-law.

367
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,560
Seth: That's great.
And then --

368
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,860
kids, parents, mom and dad.
Seth: And then you had

369
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,630
Steve carell, Bryan cranston --
I know.

370
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,800
Seth: -- Judy greer, all
came to make speeches.

371
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,660
That was so meaningful.
The kind of weird mix of my

372
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,830
family who are never at
Hollywood things and then three

373
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,560
of my dear friends speak about
me.

374
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,300
It was just -- it was really
cool.

375
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,060
Seth: It's really cool.
It's such an amazing thing while

376
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,800
also just being on the street.
Yes, exactly.

377
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,430
[ Laughter ]
Seth: Yeah.

378
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,760
With gum on it.
Seth: Yeah.

379
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,630
Anyway, do you have one?
Seth: I don't.

380
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,260
Oh, shoot.
[ Laughter ]

381
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,600
Seth: You know, that's one of
things --

382
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,900
oh, that's awkward.
Seth: I'm glad we brought it

383
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,330
up, though.
I am too.

384
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,860
Seth: And again --
I am too.

385
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,700
Seth: You know what?
I do.

386
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,230
Seth: I'm so happy for you.
I don't even need one.

387
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,830
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

388
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,000
That's my star?
You're my star.

389
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,600
So, obviously, this is a -- you
are a vengeful mother in this

390
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,530
film.
Yes.

391
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,860
Seth: You're -- some bad
things have happened to your

392
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,360
family.
And you're taking it out on the

393
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,330
people.
So angry.

394
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm so angry in this movie.
Seth: Is -- was it -- is it

395
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,100
cathartic?
Is it cathartic to have mom

396
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,400
rage?
Deeply cathartic.

397
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,360
Seth: Yeah.
Yes, it is.

398
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,630
It is deeply cathartic to punch
things and to use, you know,

399
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:59,200
learn to use weapons correctly
and for pretend and not for

400
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,600
real.
Seth: Yeah.

401
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,100
But it is.
It's like -- there's something

402
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,830
about making this movie that
plays out every bit of mom rage

403
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,800
you've ever had on the
playground or every bit of mom

404
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,300
rage you've had like when your
child is put in the back of the

405
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,260
class and like a -- and you feel
like they should be in the

406
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,660
front.
Seth: Yeah.

407
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
Or their feelings are hurt.
Seth: I'm glad you never

408
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,400
actually reacted the way you
reacted in this movie.

409
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,130
Right.
Seth: That would be a real --

410
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,000
if any of this stuff was on the
playground, that would be a real

411
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,300
tmz moment.
Yeah.

412
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,300
I'd be wearing something else.

413
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,260
Seth: Yeah, exactly.
Yes, yeah.

414
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,600
Seth: It's the same director
as the film "taken."

415
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,900
Yes.
Seth: It's just --

416
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,100
Pierre morel.
Seth: Yeah, Pierre morel.

417
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,530
Were you drawn to the idea of
doing --

418
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,360
for sure.
I definitely wanted to work with

419
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,660
Pierre.
Because he understands what I

420
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,900
believe so firmly which is that
an action movie is just a drama.

421
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,760
And it's a drama that goes
really far and really off the

422
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,260
chains.
And -- but you have to have the

423
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,100
drama there in order to buy the
rest of it.

424
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,460
Seth: And -- you know,
obviously, the through line of

425
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,060
both of "taken" and this film is
like also parents and family --

426
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,600
right, yes.
Seth: Of what people are

427
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,230
willing to do which I think
anybody can watching those can

428
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,630
associate with the character
immediately when they know

429
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,830
that's -- it's not just a crazy
action movie where people are

430
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,800
doing these things for no
reason.

431
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,430
They actually have a core.
No, it's definitely grounded

432
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,130
in something.
This woman is fighting for kind

433
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,200
of just vengeance for her family
and for justice for something

434
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,000
that happened to them and the
corruption, the broken system

435
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,300
that led to them just being gone
with no reason and no recourse

436
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,030
for anyone.
And she goes off the rails a

437
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,430
little bit.
And it is a fantasy.

438
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,060
It is not a how-to video.
[ Laughter ]

439
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,430
But it is -- it's just
satisfying.

440
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,700
It's just like when the critics
showed up and said that they had

441
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,430
cheered in the movie theater.
And I know they're going to

442
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,060
write -- you know, I don't know
what kind of reviews they'll

443
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,030
write.
But I can imagine.

444
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,000
But I know that they had -- they
had that feeling of, like,

445
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,060
"yeah, get him."
You know?

446
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,930
Seth: It's also -- I feel
like it's been a long time since

447
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,100
the "alias" days -- >> yes.

448
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,530
Seth: Which is surprising.
Because, and I mean this

449
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,960
genially, you look the same.
So you kind look back and go,

450
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,800
"oh, 'alias' was a long time
ago."

451
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,130
Come on.
Yeah, it was.

452
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,630
Seth: Did you have to -- was
it fun to return to sort of your

453
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,600
action roots?
It was.

454
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,000
It had been such a long time
since I had done any action.

455
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,530
I mean, the last thing I did
that was action was "the

456
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,930
kingdom."
and my daughter learned to

457
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,030
crawl.
And she's 12.

458
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,860
So that was a long time ago, you
know?

459
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,430
[ Laughter ]
That's how you kind of --

460
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,730
Seth: Unless she was a really
late crawler.

461
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,530
[ Laughter ]
And yet, she was an amazing

462
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,360
crawler.
And don't cry, too.

463
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,430
Seth: Oh, "peppermint,"
"peppermint," "peppermint."

464
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,960
This is what's happening
right now.

465
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,600
But, anyway, yeah, the funny
thing was that when I actually

466
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,200
started shooting, there would be
things where I would do a take.

467
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,260
And I would say to the director,
"I'm so sorry.

468
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,700
I need to do that again."
I did that as Sidney.

469
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,130
Seth: Oh, really?
Yes.

470
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,330
Seth: Wow.
Which is the character I

471
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,060
played in "alias."
Seth: Yes.

472
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,230
And -- because she is like, I
mean, the way I would walk up

473
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,730
the stairs, I did it so many
times over five years.

474
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,130
I would like, take a couple
steps, and then look back at the

475
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,860
camera and then forward again.
And I was like, "hold on a

476
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,060
second.
Hold up.

477
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,560
That was -- that was -- it's on
abc right now.

478
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,260
Got to do it again.
I'm sorry.

479
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,760
Seth: And did you find -- was
your recovery the same as your

480
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,260
"alias" days?
No.

481
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,200
Seth: Yeah.
No, nothing is the same.

482
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,500
I mean I just -- I got in a
fight.

483
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,860
And this guy had a huge rifle.
And he twisted my hand.

484
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,060
And I was -- it swelled up.
And the crew members are like,

485
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,460
"what happened to your hand?"
And I was like, "oh, don't worry

486
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,560
about it.
We've got to keep fighting.

487
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,730
We've got to make our day."
And then, the next day, they

488
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,800
were like, "your hand doesn't
look good."

489
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,560
And so they brought an X-ray
machine to a trailer.

490
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,630
[ Laughter ]
'Cause they didn't want to want

491
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,360
to stop shooting.
And while they were turning the

492
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,800
camera around, they said, "go
put your hand in this X-ray

493
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,100
machine."
and the guy's like, "it looks

494
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
fine."
[ Laughter ]

495
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,530
And then months later, it's

really amazing, your daughter.

00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,800
a break here.
But she made you a 12-foot --

yes.

Seth: As a birthday present.
She just started fourth

Seth: And that -- I was

527
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,700
thinking, "what does a 12-foot
long scarf look like?"

528

We do birthdays in the morning

531
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,730
at our house for some reason.
And she gave it in the morning

of my birthday.
We're about to leave for school.

And I said, "I can't wait to
wear this."

And she said, "it's chilly
outside today, mama."

it."

from your show before.
There's a personal favorite we

have.
A lot of times, you have people

on your show, people who are
defending the trump

they're a little fast and loose

that we enjoy.

to some degree, you are aware of

597
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,830
some talking points that they're
going to come, and was that one

598

where you just couldn't believe
how happy you were to hear

something that could so quickly
be rebutted?

600
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,800
Well, the thing that's
amazing, these are major

601
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,730
business guys, and they think,
"oh, it's close enough, I'll

602
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,630
just say it," and the president
loves to say such negative

603
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,100
coverage, "everyone is out to
get me," but we're living in a

604
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,400
house of unforced errors.
The president is approaching

very happy to tell you.
[ Light laughter ]

608

There you go.
That clearly makes him a

609
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,730
habitual liar.
So fact checking him every day

610
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,660
doesn't mean it's negative
coverage.

611
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,730
The economy -- I mean, that guy
knows the economy.

612
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,000
What President Obama didn't do
was sell the economy well.

613
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,600
President Trump is a fantastic
salesman, but like a used car

614
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,600
salesman, he's not telling the
truth and it is our job to fact

615
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,960
check him.
So we do.

616
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,930
Seth: When someone like that
comes on, and this happens a

617
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,030
lot, do you think, you know, a
trump-supporting ceo like that,

618
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,100
do you think he actually
believes what he's telling you

619
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,930
or does he just think he's going
to be able to slide it by?

620
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,900
Because, certainly, you would
think he would know that it

621
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,730
happened five times under the
Obama administration.

622
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,460
Without a doubt, but I think
they think, "oh, it's close

623
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,900
enough, and in the world of
President Trump, things are

624
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,430
close enough."
Because one thing he has done is

625
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:10,130
give people confidence, consumer
confidence is up, business

626
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,000
confidence is up, because he
gets people excited.

627
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,700
The problem is there aren't the
facts to back it up and they

628
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,130
don't think anyone is actually
going to check.

629
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,530
And in this short-term
environment, people don't.

630
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,830
President Trump makes people
feel good.

631
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,800
When they watched him on TV, on
"the apprentice," it was

632
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,730
primetime.
They were sitting in their house

633
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,460
on their couch and he's, "I'm
this business guy, I'm this real

634
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,500
estate guy, I don't take
anything from anyone."

635
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,130
People built a relationship and
they trusted that.

636
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,060
Seth: You were in business
for a long time before you were

637
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,930
in television.
What is your take, you know,

638
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,560
coming from the world of
finance, is this idea of trump

639
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,960
is a great businessman, is it a
mirage or is there something to

640
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,260
the idea that he was good at
this other thing before he was

641
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,100
president?
Well, if you were to compare

642
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,260
him to mitt romney, when
mitt romney ran, all of his

643
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,330
peers in private equity backed
him.

644
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,060
When President Trump ran, you
didn't see anyone from the big

645
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,560
real estate universe.
You didn't see any big New York

646
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,930
business people back him.
You saw people in middle America

647
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,530
who wanted a change.
And the thing is he did a

648
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,060
brilliant thing in that he went
to see them.

649
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,900
Those rallies were in places
where I haven't visited.

650
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,000
I don't know if you visited.
And it gave people hope.

651
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,830
The twisted thing is he gave
them hope without an actual

652
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,100
resolution.
He had the smarts to say I'm

653
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,600
going to solve income and
inequality, but he's not doing

654
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,130
it.
When he says, "I'm going to go

655
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,330
after trade," that's a good
idea.

656
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,960
There are issues.
China?

657
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,260
Yeah, there's problems there,
but what he's actually doing

658
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,760
makes no sense.
And he said, "intellectual

659
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,600
property or artificial
intelligence, we're going to go

660
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,860
after that."
President Trump, if you asked

661
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,460
him about ai, no joke, he would
think it was a steak sauce.

662
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
Seth: Yeah.
[ Laughter ]

663
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,860
So what he's offering the
American people --

664
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:01,760
[ cheers and applause ]
He's a brilliant marketer with

665
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,260
no real solutions, and the
country needs solutions.

666
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,800
Seth: You know, he falls back
on the economy every time it

667
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,300
seems like he's cornered.
Is there anything missing

668
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,130
because like you said, consumer
confidence is up, you know,

669
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,660
business confidence is up.
Is there an argument to be made

670
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,400
that he's making a fair point
when he says, "hey, despite

671
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,560
everything and despite how it's
a circus at the white house, the

672
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,630
economy is good," or is there
something that he's leaving out

673
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,800
there?
Well, there's something to

674
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,160
remember.
The economy was good before

675
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,430
President Trump took office.
It was a slow and steady climb

676
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,600
out of the financial crisis.
What Obama didn't do was sell it

677
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,860
very well.
He's a -- somewhat of a, not a

678
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,060
soft spoken guy, but certainly
more humble than trump.

679
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,030
Everyone is.
Seth: Yeah.

680
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,060
[ Light laughter ]
And when trump says things

681
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,360
are great and it's trickling
down, it's not.

682
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,530
We have lots of people with
jobs, and that's great, but they

683
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,600
just don't pay enough money.
And so this idea that things are

684
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,100
going to trickle-down, if you
look at Republicans that running

685
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,500
for office now in the midterms,
they don't talk about the

686
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,030
economy because they know in
their states people aren't

687
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,760
living comfortably.
It's those who don't need to run

688
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,060
again.
They're saying, "look at this

689
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,230
economy, it's great."
It's great for big business.

690
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,060
Right after trump won, I don't
know if you remember, he snuck

691
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,030
out of trump tower and he went
to the 21 club, right?

692
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,430
One of the fanciest restaurants
in New York.

693
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,400
Lots of people love it.
Filled with wealthy people, and

694
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,100
he said, "I'm going to lower
your taxes."

695
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,060
And he did.
So President Trump wanted to

696
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,930
impress and do this for the
wealthiest people and he has

697
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,630
done that.
The concern is that people who

698
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,160
voted for change aren't going to
get that change.

699
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,130
Seth: I showed one of your
greatest hits, and again, I'm a

700
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,300
fan of your work, but I do -- I
think it's only fair to show

701
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,930
what really one of the flubs of
the year.

702
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,330
I have to tell you, I loved it.
We were really happy when you

703
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,860
did it.
I'm glad you were.

704
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,830
My kids were too.
My kids were.

your mom was on TV and you were

706
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,430
a kid, you'd be very happy about
this.

707
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,699
So here you are not as sharp as

708
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,359
you were earlier.

709
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,559
Let's take a look.

00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,300
As California is farting,
excuse me, fighting, the largest

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,000
They're farting.
Well, there are a lot of

713

vegans in California.
Seth: That's true.

714

There are a lot of cleanses

715
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,660
that go on.
So they could be farting.

00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,960
Seth: No, right.
They're farting the wild fires.

717
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,700
They could be farting.
Listen, I did not get into

718
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,960

Seth: Yeah.

says farting.

everybody.
Sorry to do this, but if I may,

00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,630
there's something that's been
bothering me that I need to get

736
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,500
off my chest.
I'm in the elevator earlier

today, just me and this one
other guy.

And when he gets off at his
floor, he turns to me and he

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,430
says, "have a good one," and I'm
like, "have a good what?"

good one," so I'm asking you,
"have a good one what?"

until the doors closed.

And I'm sorry, but I gotta say
it, these casual pleasantries

can all go straight to hell.
At this point in the

spontaneous and profanity filled

746
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,000
rant about casual pleasantries
and how he believes they are the

747

worst thing in the english
language.

are forced to air the video

that words are important and
casual pleasantries are like hot

will never have a good one nor

And if you say "ciao" and you're

on my sack.

expression, "don't be a

stranger," saying, "how could I
be a stranger, you know me."

00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,860
You would never say don't be a
stranger to an actual stranger,

00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,700
at which point, an actual
stranger appeared near his desk

763
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,360
and said, "are you talking to
me," to which Seth applied, "no,

764
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,000
do I know you?"
To which the stranger replied,

765
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,530
"I don't think so."
"Do I know you?"

hell out of my studio, you

said, "yeah?"

00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,700
And then, Seth looked the man
dead in the eye and said, "don't

771
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,060
be a stranger."
Seth then took issue with people

772
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,560
who use the expression, "I can't
even," saying, "you can't even

what?"
"finish the sentence."

Is it, "I can't even dab."
Is it dabbing that you cannot

775
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,760
even?
Because I can dab.

776
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,830
In fact, I can dab cool.
Seth then dabbed a lot and

777
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,060
quickly, and it was upsetting
and bad.

00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,730
And someone hollered from the
audience, you ruined it.

replied, "very good, gentlemen,
looks like my work here is

then, as he was turning to go

787
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,830
back to wherever the hell he
came from, he stopped and said,

788
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,530
"Seth, I have something very
important to tell you."

00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,700
To which Seth replied, "yes,
Albert Einstein?"

790
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,660
At which point, Albert Einstein
looked Seth dead in the eye and

791
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,160
said, "don't be a stranger."
To which Seth replied,

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,800
"[ bleep ] You,
Albert Einstein."

793
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,430
Albert Einstein then playfully
shimmied out of the studio

794
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,300
because as we all know,
Albert Einstein was famously a

795
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,000
little stinker.
Then something happened that we

796
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,630
can only legally show in a
series of courtroom-style

797
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,900
sketches.
Seth stood up on his desk and

798
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,530
shouted, "to everyone who says
it's a jungle out there, no,

799
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:21,900
bish, it's a jungle in here."
He then pulled on a rope hanging

800
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,730
above his desk which lifted a
curtain, revealing a live puma

801
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,900
in the studio, which caused the
audience to panic and stampede,

802
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,700
at which point, Seth said,
"relax, she's not dangerous."

803
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,830
At which point, the puma left
from the stage and tackled

804
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,960
Albert Einstein, biting off his
face and savaging his body,

805
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,330
before casting aside his bloody
carcass like a rag doll.

806
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,400
Following this, the puma turned
and set her sights on the

807
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,460
courtroom sketch artist brutally
savaging him as well, which

808
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,060
necessitated a second sketch
artist to take over drawing

809
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,800
duties.
Even though they were a

810
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,960
decidedly poorer artist and
ultimately, all of this resulted

00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,260

hands and saying, "I can't
