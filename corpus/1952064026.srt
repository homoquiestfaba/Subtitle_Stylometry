There's never going to be
a better time to sell.

86
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:31,187
I don't want to sell.

87
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,156
Look, there's a window
of opportunity right now.

88
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:34,758
It's my home.

89
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,594
I raised my family there.

90

that that road
is going to come through.

94
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:50,240
I don't know why we're talking
about this again.

95

You do what you want
with your part.

96

Mary Margaret,
make sense.

97
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,016
I mean, that development's
going to happen

00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:00,183
whether we like it
or not.

99
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:03,620
I am going to sell
my half.

100
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:06,690
But we can get triple
if we both sell.

101
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:13,363
Is this what you want
or what Nancy Kaye wants?

102
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,835
It's what we both want.

103
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:24,641

what's best for you,

104

what's best
for all of us.

105

Think about moving
where me and Nancy Kaye live.

106
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:33,050
I mean, there's
a great subdivision.

Got three-bedroom houses
with central air and a pool.

108

somebody.

A stray dog, Billy.

365
00:28:58,468 --> 00:28:59,835
What?

366
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:02,538
He's not one of those strays
you used to bring home.

367
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,640
What are you talking about?

368
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:10,278
The ones that I ended up
taking care of.

369
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:14,149
Turn out the lights

371
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,534
I'm in my mom's house.

372
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:33,635
Look, Beth,
I just need to know

373
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:35,371

from Hope.

374
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:37,406
<i>I haven't heard anything</i>

Well, do you have any idea
where she could be?

376
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,677
<i>I have no idea.</i>

377
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:46,348
<i>I thought she was with you.</i>

378
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:47,983
She never checked in.

379
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:49,785
I mean, if I don't hear from her
in the next couple of days,

380
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:53,722

Mm-mm.

411
00:30:57,286 --> 00:30:58,420
I saw you had a bag.

Don't you have
any clothes in it?

413

No.

Do you have a toothbrush?

415

Mm-mm.

416
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,505

What are you doing here?

423
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:55,971
Just thought I'd stop by

424
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:57,940
Okay.

425
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:09,117
So what's wrong?

426
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:14,289
I need to find someone.

427
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,559
Who are you looking for?

428
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,896
The kid I'm with,
I need to find his mother.

429
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:25,601
Well, have you tried
her friends, family?

430
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:27,402
No one knows where she is.

431
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:31,239
Does she have a husband
or a boyfriend?

432
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:35,844
What about the boy's father?

433
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:47,456
Why doesn't Billy look like you?

434
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:49,424
'cause he looks like his father.

435
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:50,625
Why did you name him Billy?

436
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:51,793
<i>'Cause his father's name</i>
<i>was that</i>

437
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:54,096
and his father before him.

438
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:55,663
Hey, could you get
the jumper cables?

439
00:33:55,664 --> 00:33:57,665
Sure.

440
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,308
Where are they?

441
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:09,344
Oh, they died
a long time ago.

442
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:13,748
My mom goes to work every day.

443
00:34:13,749 --> 00:34:15,417
Where does she work?

444
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,818
Hooters.

445
00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:18,286
Oh!

446
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:20,522
She's a dancer.

447
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:22,090
<i>Is that right?</i>

448
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:23,125
Mm-hmm.

449
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:25,593
Okay, now,
take this cable,

450
00:34:25,594 --> 00:34:27,095

right in there.

That's right.

00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:47,549
What can I do for you?

456
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,617
Brakes keep on slipping.

458
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:12,574
Boy, she's walked a mile.

459
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:14,242
She still plays good.

460
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:15,577
I'm kind of partial to her.

Just brake fluid.

Sit down, Billy.

735

I have some bad news.

736
00:54:22,324 --> 00:54:23,757
Is this her car?

737
00:54:38,507 --> 00:54:40,274
Is she dead?

She suffer?

739
00:54:53,055 --> 00:54:56,257
She died on impact.

740
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:59,960

750
00:56:31,886 --> 00:56:35,356
An accident.

Have you ever been to Mexico?

752

I haven't.

She's fine.

I'm not sure.

795
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:52,486
Well, I got to make a run
to the parts store.

796
01:00:18,713 --> 01:00:25,018
(Billy) I'm not very good
at this kind of thing.

But truth is, you just--

You're asking me to do
something I don't want to do,

801
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:50,377
and that's to look at myself.

802
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:55,081
And, well, I'm just afraid
of that truth.

803
01:00:55,082 --> 01:00:59,185
So...

804
01:00:59,186 --> 01:01:00,721
I don't want to look at it.

805
01:01:00,722 --> 01:01:06,026
I lie to people,
and I run.

806
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,035
As far as I run,
as fast as I go,

807
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:18,605
I end up staying
in the same place.

808
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:29,182

01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:11,959
Yes.

816
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,361
He--he spent the night
at the station.

817
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:16,630

<i>Billy.</i>

01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,935
Oh.

821
01:02:21,936 --> 01:02:23,637
Guess he just needed
a place to crash.

822
01:02:23,638 --> 01:02:26,473
I figured you'd want to know
he was okay.

823
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:31,645
Well, thank you
for looking out for him.

824
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:35,248
He's come by, you know,
played with us.

He's good.

826
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:39,820
Taught us old boys
a few tricks.

827
01:02:41,022 --> 01:02:44,024
Well, I expect
you've got things to do.

Maybe you'd like
to come by sometime,

829
01:02:47,361 --> 01:02:48,529
hear us play.

830
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,532
