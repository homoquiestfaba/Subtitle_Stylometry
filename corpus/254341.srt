The second time in this World Cup.

70

All they needed
to do was beat Brazil.

71
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,360
They'd won all
their previous games.

72
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,280
They getthere and
they can't play at all.

73
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,680
Bloody awful timing
on the part oftheir coach.

74
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,040
When I gotthere at 4:40
people were waiting outside.

75
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,400
When I gotto Inco
they'd closed the place down.

76
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,200
Rats had chewed through
the ceiling during the night.

77
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,760
They'd closed itto get rid
ofthe rats, and then last night...

78
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,440
What rats?
- The rats at Inco.

79
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,800
They covered the floor
with flour last night-

80
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,440
- to see ifthe rats
waded around in it.

81
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,320
They can see their footprints.
Weird.

82
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,440
And todaythere's this silver
wedding do on the fourth floor.

83
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,640
They've lived
in the same flatfor 25 years.

84
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,000
Amazing they haven't got arthritis
from all those stairs.

85
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,000
And you get here
at seven minutes pastfive.

86
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,640
I can't stand people being late,
it's bad timing.

87
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,000
Fucking bad timing.

88
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,720
Seven minutes isn'tthat much.
- You're meantto be here at 5.

89
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,640
It bugs me when people
don't show up on time -

90
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,440
- you can't plan things
with people like you.

91
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,280
It's kind of irritating.

92
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,800
Hi, Mum.
I'm fine... yes, I am.

93
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
I am pregnant.

94
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,920
Yes... yes...

95
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,840
8 weeks... just a minute, Mum.

96
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,040
...Hang on.

97
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,360
Mum? I'll call you back
in a moment, all right?

98
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,280
I promise. OK. 'Bye.

99
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,720
Is that it, then?

100
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,280
Yes.
- And it's certain?

101
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,480
Is it OK?

102
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
Yes.

103
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,600
Don'tyou think...

104
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,120
Maybe it's not a good thing...

105
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,080
Will you come in here?

106
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,360
Why?
- Come on.

107
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,360
Can'twe get rid of some ofthis?

108
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,080
Why?

109
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,840
To make room.
- We hadn'ttalked about it.

110
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,480
What do you mean?
- The baby.

111
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,560
We've talked about it
a thousand times.

112
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,120
And you said you wanted kids,
right?

113
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,320
With me?
- Sure.

114
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,800
I'm not having any more abortions,
right?

115
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,280
There's plenty oftime.
- Yes, there's plenty oftime.

116
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,400
But I want it now.
But atyourpace...

117
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,560
Why move mythings?
You can move your things.

118
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,520
I justwantthings to be different.
Now.

119
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,480
No reason
to get pissed off.

120
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,520
I'm not pissed off.

121
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,320
I don'twantto
talk any more about it, OK?

122
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,280
What have you been doing today?

123
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,240
Not much.
I wentto work.

Congratulations.

126
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,240
The old lady left a message
on my machine... exciting, right?

127
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,640
Is it good?
- Not much difference yet.

128
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,400
Oh...
What aboutyou?

129
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,520
How are you taking it?

130
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,560
It's fine.

131
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,240
So your gear works after all.

132
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,080
It's notjust blanks.

133
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,320
What aboutyour tummy?

134
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,960
You can't see anything.
Notyet.

135
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,000
What's with the faggot?
Whythe grunting?

136
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,360
Problems? Are you sure?
- Everything's fine.

137
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,640
He's fine?
He's not bothered any more?

138
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,960
If he's fine, I'm fine.

139
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,320
Oh, that'll be mum.

140
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,680
Hi, Mum.
Hi.

141
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,760
No, Louis has come.
Want a word?

142
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,720
Oh, no, he'sjust left.
...She's phoned 5 times today.

143
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,080
I haven'ttime to talkto her.

144
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,160
It's fine.

145
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,680
So am I, you bet.
And you're going to be a gran!

146
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,800
Take good care of her, right?

147
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,160
Yeah, of course.
- I mean...

148
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,160
Yes.

149
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,800
Can we have a word?
- Yes, but I have to getto work.

150
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,920
We'll take a walk.
- My old baby clothes.

151
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,560
Can't I have them?
- We'rejust going out.

152
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,400
Will you be back?
- I have to getto work, so...

153
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,160
I'll be back shortly.

154
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,200
You knowthat's a cemetery, right?
- Sure.

155
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,120
And Louise's nursery is right here.
- Yeah. So?

156
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,600
It's weird living nextto
a cemetery and an nursery.

157
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,640
Oh, I don't know.
I live over a takeaway.

158
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,720
I once went in there.

159
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,480
Climbed over the wall,
pulled over a few headstones.

160
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,560
It's totally scary, man.
With big guard dogs.

161
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,480
We got out in a hurry.

162
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,520
Have you got any kids?
- Notthat I know of.

163
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,600
Would you want any?
- When all's said and done, yes.

164
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,440
It's whatwe're here for.
- Yeah...

165
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,560
You'd tell me ifyou had any.
- You'd be the firstto know.

166
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,200
Hey, is something up?
- Not at all.

167
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,680
I justwanted to know
ifyou had any.

168
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,360
Are you sure, or what?
- Yeah.

169
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,720
Joe?

170
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,640
How did it go yesterday?
- Itwas shit.

171
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,520
Nothing but coloured bastards.

172
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,280
You always saythat.
- They are always trouble.

173
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,280
Always.

174
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,400
They rush in and feel up the girls.
All ofthem.

175
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,200
You're such a git.
- Itjust isn't right.

176
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,000
I let some ofthem in.
- Just one and there's trouble.

177
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,840
They can't behave,
no matter whatyou do.

178
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,640
They're like wild animals.
Who's he?

179
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,080
My brother-in-law, Leo.
- Oh, you knocked Louise up?

180
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,560
He's going to be a dad.
- Getthe kid educated.

181
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,760
School-wise.
- What do you mean?

182
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,960
The schools are full
of blacks and coloureds.

183
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,080
Things will work out.
- He's so cheerful.

184
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm not racist.
I eatfalafel, too.

185
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,680
You'rejust a git.
- Here comes trouble.

186
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,320
Two monkeys
and you've gottrouble.

187
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,320
You can't come in.
- What?

188
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,760
You can't come in.
- Justfor a look?

189
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,480
No way.

190
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,320
You're serious?
- 100%.

191
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,280
You can't come in.
- Are you taking the piss?

192
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,600
100%... you can't come in.
- Mellow out, man.

193
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,160
Let us in for a look.
- No fucking way.

194
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,440
Let's go in for a look.
- No way.

195
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,400
Fuckyou.
I'm sick of all this.

196
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
They're nothing buttrouble.

197
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,280
They get into a temper
just like that.

198
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,880
Do you knowthem?
- No.

199
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,320
I've seen one ofthem before.
- They're crazy.

200
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,400
He's got a gun.
- Fuck.

201
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,960
Get him inside.

202
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,240
Come and get it, you bastards.

203
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,880
May I come out?

204
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,600
I'd like to go now.

205
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,840
Hi.
- Hi.

206
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,160
I saw a guy get shot.

207
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,360
What?

208
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,920
Down at Louis'.

209
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,960
Some guys weren't allowed in,
and so they used guns.

210
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,480
Who?

211
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,680
I don't knowwho theywere.

212
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,960
Is Louis OK?

213
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,120
Yes, he's OK.

214
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,600
Hi.

215
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,440
Hi.

216
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,880
You don't recognise me?
- No.

217
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,200
I've seen you atthe video store.

218
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,440
You workthere?
- Yeah.

219
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,520
Been waiting long?
- Ten minutes.

220
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,920
I work atthe video store.

221
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,440
Yes.

222
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,480
'Bye.

223
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,800
How are you doing?
- Fine, thanks.

224
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,680
And you?
- Fine.

225
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,760
That's nice.

226
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,280
You work atthe diner, right?
- Yes.

227
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,960
I go there sometimes.
- I thought I'd seen you before.

228
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,080
Yes, I work down atthe video store.

229
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,800
Have you gotthe time?
- No.

230
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,920
Didn'tyou rent Casino lastweek?
- Yes.

231
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
I think I was atworkthat day.

232
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,920
Was it good?
- Yes, itwas OK.

233
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,160
I am going the other way.
See you.

234
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,440
Put itthere.

235
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,800
Where?
- Here, on the wall.

236
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,520
OK.

237
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Or what do you reckon?
- I reckon it'll go fine here.

238
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,480
Itwas also fine in the lounge.
And in the kitchen.

239
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,120
Or here, so you could look
atyourself having a crap.

240
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,800
Put itthere.
- Sure?

241
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,520
Yes.

242
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,840
What do you think Leo'll think?
- Leo'll think it's fine.

243
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,200
You reckon?
- Yes. I'll hang it here, right?

244
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,120
That's right.

245
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,120
There.

246
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,320
Now I've done that, too.
- Two people become three.

247
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm really looking forward to it.
- Are you?

248
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,560
Yes... Baby.

249
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,920
No, I don'tthinkyou can compare
Steven Seagal to Fred Williamson.

250
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,960
Sure you can.
- Impossible.

251
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,600
Anyway, I wasn't comparing.
I just sayWilliamson is king.

252
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,680
You can't saythat.
You can't.

253
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,960
I might as well say
Steven Seagal is king; him, -

254
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,680
- Charles Bronson,
and Franco Nero.

255
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,760
And Fred Williamson.
And Bruce Lee?

256
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,760
Seventies stuff.
- Yes.

257
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,440
And the best ever made.
So what are Bronson and Franco Nero?

258
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,680
They use firearms. Guns,
like everyone else. Timeless.

259
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,120
After all, this is the nineties.
- Yes.

260
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,680
You like Steven Seagal
but not Bruce Lee.

261
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,200
That's whatyou're saying.
- I just said Seagal is better.

262
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Yes, you said Seagal is better.
He's fatter, that's all.

263
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Cutthe crap!
He'sjustwell-built, strong.

264
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,360
You can't saythat!
- He is!

265
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,960
He's a lump.
- Hey! When is Louis coming?

266
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,760
He said he'd leave atten past.
- Ten pastwhat?

267
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
I don't know.

268
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,240
Steven Seagal is fat.

269
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,000
Have you screwed her?
- What?

270
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,520
Her.
- Who?

271
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,920
Her you're thinking about.

272
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,160
What's her name?
- I don't remember.

273
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,200
What did you talk about?

274
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,120
All kinds of stuff.
Films, I think.

275
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,800
Films?
- Yes.

276
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,320
So you didn'ttalk, then.
- Yes, we did.

277
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,520
No, you didn't.
You talked aboutfilms.

278
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,400
You haven'ttalked to each other.
- Really.

279
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,320
It's abnormal.
Have you screwed her?

280
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,680
You haven't screwed her.
You haven'ttouched her, either.

281
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,640
Is thatthe wayyou see girls?

282
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,680
To be talked to, nottouched,
not screwed? It's abnormal.

283
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,160
Kitjo?
- Yes?

284
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,000
How are things?
- Hi.

285
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,000
Hi, Louis.
- Doesn't it need some paint?

286
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,080
I was thinking of replacing it.
- You've got more?

287
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,760
I've got one with Fred Williamson.
- Fred Williamson?

288
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,560
Shall we find it?
- No.

289
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,200
We're going to watch a movie.
- It'll onlytake five minutes.

290
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,360
We're going to watch a movie now.

291
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,920
Or what?

292
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,080
Is there time to go round the shop?
- I'll come with you.

293
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,520
I'll wait here.
- Shall we getyou anything?

294
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,720
Beer.
Three beers. Tuborg.

295
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,000
Hi.
- Good evening.

296
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,160
What do you want?
- I'lljust have a look.

297
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,640
What do you want?
- Iced tea.

298
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,360
Peach.

299
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
Yes, OK, I'll have that one.

300
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,320
And these.

301
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,280
Anything else?
- Yes.

302
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,160
One ofthose?
- Yes.

303
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,800
Anything else?
- No, I don'tthink so.

304
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,920
9, please.
- 9? For that?

305
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,680
It's the same anywhere else.
- No, it isn't.

306
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,880
It's cheaper down the street.
- No, the same.

307
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,760
What's the problem?
- I justthink it's expensive.

308
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,400
Checkyour change.
Or the nigger'll cheatyou.

309
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,200
What did you say?

310
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,440
Nigger.
And you can sit down, Mohammed.

311
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,160
What's the problem?
- You are. I'm tired ofyour kind.

312
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,040
You thinkyou rule the place.
- I'm not listening.

313
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,800
Anything else? If not, you can leave.

314
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,880
Black bastard.
Go home and fuckyour mother.

315
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,040
Get out.

316
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,720
Black bastard.

317
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,480
Black cunt.

318
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm sorry aboutthat.
- What kind offriends have you got?

319
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,680
Sorry.

320
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,960
OK? Sorry.

321
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,760
It's no good.
- No.

322
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,560
I said sorry, OK?
See you later.

323
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,680
There it is.

324
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,640
Take your beer, OK?
- Yes.

325
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Oh? Yes.

326
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,760
Shit... there he goes.

327
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,680
He hadn't reckoned on that.

328
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,120
She's got one, too.

329
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,600
Where do all those guns come from?

330
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,560
What?
- Where do they all come from?

331
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,480
What do you mean?
- You knowwhat I mean.

332
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,000
Lfthey need a gun,
onejust appears.

333
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,200
Yes. It's a film.
- I know it's a film.

334
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,760
Hey, we're watching a film, OK?
- I just don't get it.

335
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,560
How come
they all know about guns?

336
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,120
You think about it a lot?
- Yes.

337
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,000
I don't know.
It's as if...

338
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,240
...all of a sudden
they all know howto fire them.

339
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,560
Even ordinary people like us.
- Why all this talking?

340
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,680
Who's talking?
- I am, because you are.

341
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,880
I wasn'ttalking, Leo was.
- Don'tyou think about it as well?

342
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,720
Doesn't he like this film or what?
- Sure. Let's watch it, OK?

343
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,040
Yeah...

344
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,840
Itjust doesn't look
like that in real life.

345
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,640
I saw a guy get shot a few days ago.
Louis was there as well.

346
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,200
It doesn't look like that,
does it?

347
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,640
I really don't know
whatyou're on about.

348
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,920
One of Louis' friends got shot.

349
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,440
And then he began
beating the guy up.

350
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,840
You beat him up, didn'tyou?

351
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,320
I really don't remember.
- No. You don't?

352
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,680
Not beating him up?

353
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,560
Have you ever shot anyone?
- No.

354
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,040
Any animals?
- No.

355
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
A rabbit?
- No.

356
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,880
Isn'tthat an animal?
- Yes. Have you?

357
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,640
No.

358
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,720
Would you like to?
- No.

359
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,280
Can you get me a gun?
- Whatthe fuckfor?

360
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,000
For fun.
- They're notfor fun.

361
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,960
Can you get me one?
- No.

362
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,880
What do you mean?
- I mean no. Are you stupid?

363
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,600
What do you mean?
- It's only a film.

364
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,240
You watch films, you knowfuck all.
You watch four films a day. OK?

365
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,080
Just don'ttell Louise.
She'd throw a fit.

366
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,080
Can you get me one?
- No.

367
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,280
An Uzi?

368
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,160
Oh. Yes...

369
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,840
He forgotto shutthe door.

370
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,080
But he's shut it now.

371
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,640
And now it's blown up.

372
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,840
Got nothing to do?
- No, nobody's been in.

373
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,040
I've looked atthe figures.
You serve 2000 beefburgers a year.

374
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,240
That's about 30 cows.
- I've only been here 6 weeks.

375
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,040
That makes 231.

376
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,880
Don'tyou ever get bored?
- Sometimes.

377
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,240
What aboutyou?
Are you bored?

378
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
Yes.
- Here?

379
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,080
Sometimes.
- How about doing some washing up?

380
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,040
OK.

381
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,400
Hi.

382
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,720
A cheese burger, a small fries,
and an iced water.

383
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,560
We've no ice, will plain water do?
- Sure.

384
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,920
Seen anyfilms, then?
- Not since the last one.

385
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,480
And thatwasn't long ago.
- Oh, no.

386
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,360
What do you do, then?
- Do?

387
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,080
Otherwise.

388
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,960
I just come here.
Sometimes.

389
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,800
It's fun, isn't it?
- No.

390
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,240
Not specially.

391
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,200
Is itfun atthe video store?
- Sure.

392
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,240

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,560

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,640
Oh? Do you like Bruce Lee?

399
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,440
I don't know him either.
- You don't?

400
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,600

- I've read the book.

You don'twatch manyfilms.

403
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,400
Why not?

404
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,080
I don't know.
I just read lots of books.

405
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,840
So do I, but...
- Oh? What kind?

No, I thinkthey're all good.

I can read a book like this
in a day.

409
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,720
In a day?
OK!

410
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,280

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,080

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,520
Will you see
if it's fallen down there?

415
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,280
Down here?
- Yes.

416
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,800
No, it's not down here.

417
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,440
Fancy going to the cinema one day?

418
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,240
Why?

419
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,400
We could see a film.

00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,240

Something or other.

You always touch me.

433
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,280
What's the matter?

434
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,800
We haven't made love
since I got pregnant.

435
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,320
Do you find me disgusting?

436
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,360
No...

437
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,320

See you.

441
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,120
Good morning.

Not with.
"By".

443

Yes, LastExit To Brookhyn.
The Raven edition.

445
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,920
It's in the cellar.
Down the stairs, turn right.

446
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,080
The other side ofthe green
sliding door, under S.

447
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,760
OK, thankyou.
- Think nothing of it.

448
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,080

453
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,920
Quiet.
- Anyone around?

454
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,560
No.

455
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,000

456
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,400
Have you seen this one?

457
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,160
This one.
- No, I haven't.

458
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,240
Why not?
Do you think it's disgusting?

459
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,200
A bit.

460
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,080
It's quite normal,
getting a blowjob from a fish.

461
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,520
Have you seen this one?
- Which one?

462
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,800
Is it real?
- Yes.

463
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,480
No way.
- Hold it.

464
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,560
Be careful, it's loaded.
With live ammo.

465
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,560
There's something inside?
- Yes.

466
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,760
What are you going to do with it?
- I don't know.

467
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,520
Where did you get it?

468
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,480
You got itfrom Louis, or what?

469
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,120
What are you doing tonight?
- Me? Going to the cinema.

470
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,360
What are we going to see?
- I don'tthinkyou're coming.

471
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,000
Why not?
- I'm going with someone.

472
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,840
You could come.

473
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,000
A girl?
- Yes.

474
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,760
You're taking her out?
- Yes.

475
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,680
That's nice.
- Yes.

476
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,720
No problem, then.

477
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,680
No, should it be?

478
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,840
In that case everyone is happy.
See you.

479
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,760
You don'twantto come, do you?
- No... See you.

480
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,440
You must see
what I boughtyesterday.

481
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,080
Isn't it sweet?
- It's sweet.

482
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,320
I was so happywhen I saw it.
- It's really sweet.

483
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,760
I went in and bought itwithout
even asking how much itwas.

484
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,200
Hi...

485
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,000
Leo... Mika.
- Hi there.

Congratulations.

487
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,240
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

488
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,960
I've also bought some baby clothes.
- May I see?

489
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,680
This way.

490
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,480
This is sweet, isn't it?
- Very.

491
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,840
A natural colour.
- It's lovely.

492
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,160
When you don't know
whatyou're having, right?

493
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,200
I'm trying to give up cigarettes.
It's really hard.

494
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,200
May I hold him?
- Yes.

495
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,880
Try holding him.
- What?

496
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,600
Try holding him.

497
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,600
No.
- Oh, go on.

498
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,000
No, I don'tthink so.

499
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,680
You might as well learn how.
- Itwouldn't do.

500
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,360
Oh, wow, it's late.
We'd better be getting home.

501
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,240
Thanks... Marco, come on,
time to go home.

502
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,000
Itwas nice meeting you.

503
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,880
Your children are really sweet.
- Goodbye.

504
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,760
Hold this.
- Right.

505
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,520
Did you remember her dummy?
- Yes.

506
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,960
OK... I'll phone you.
- Yes.

507
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,600
OK... 'Bye.

508
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,960
Whatwere you thinking of?

509
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,320
Hey, I'm sorry.

510
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,600
Hey, sorry.

511
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,960
Sorry, sorry, sorry...

512
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,200
