Let's see, incense.

347
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,312
'Damn.'

348
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,849
Whoa! Get.. Get.. Ah!

349
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,091
[grunts]

350
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,701
Nice place.

351
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,703
- Shit.
- Are you a lawyer?

352
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,639
Um, yeah, yeah.

353
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,108
But, um..

354
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,876
...don't hold that against me.

355
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,879
[laughing]
A sense of humor. I like that.

356
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,149
You know, brothers take
themselves so seriously.

357
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,851
Well, you'll never catch me
doin' that.

358
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,952
Well, that's good,
it's all about

359
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,453
havin' a little fun, right?

360
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,055
Oh, yeah.

361
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,492
You know, I enjoy having
a nice laugh now and again.

362
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,794
Life's too short,
don't you think?

363
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,562
I sure do.

364
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,399
I see you got a little somethin'
going on here too.

365
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,067
I'm flattered.

366
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,670
This is funny. This is funny.

367
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,239
What's so funny?

368
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,141
It just seems to me
like a sister like you

369
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,044
would have brothers lined up
around the corner because--

370
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,213
"A sister like me?" W-what does
that supposed to mean?

371
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,982
I'm just saying that you got
the tools to..

372
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,484
- I mean--
- I have the tools?

373
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,253
You see, now,
why can't a man and a woman

374
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,988
just go out
and have a good time?

375
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,524
Does it always
have to be about sex?

376
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,492
Never mind.

377
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,429
I should've known better
than to expect anything more

378
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,098
from one of Lenny's friends.

379
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,333
Oh, yeah, what's this?
Your little freak kit?

380
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,235
That came in the mail.
Shopping Network. I-I--

381
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,171
Stop it.

382
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,339
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look, I didn't mean it, really.

383
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,175
Really. Okay?

384
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,010
Come on, I mean, some brothers
can look at a beautiful woman

385
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,912
and not lose their mind.

386
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,713
I mean, I was tellin' the fellas
just this afternoon

387
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,216
"You do not always have to
conduct yourself like dogs."

388
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,385
- I told them that.
- Mm-hmm.

389
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,754
Yeah, as far as I'm concerned,
you can be my sister.

390
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,222
Really?

391
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,024
I could be your sister?

392
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,527
Yeah.
Yeah, you can be my sister.

393
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,563
Okay.

394
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,365
Well, in that case

395
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,835
you should open
that bottle of champagne.

396
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,771
That'll work.

397
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,010
[chuckling]

398
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,816
You are such a gentleman.

399
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,119
I'm just trying
to make you feel comfy.

400
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,020
Whoo!

401
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,157
Whoa.

402
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,393
Here you go.

403
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,829
Little bubbly.

404
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,834
Thank you.

405
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,369
[chuckling]

406
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,341
Do you have a girlfriend?

407
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,077
Excuse me?

408
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,180
You know, I get so tired

409
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,749
of playing all those games,
don't you?

410
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,985
I mean, it's like..

411
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,857
We never say
what we really want.

412
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,592
Now, be serious.

413
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,031
What was your first thought
when I walked in this house?

414
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,101
[chuckling]

415
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:33,138
I mean, you had some music
playing softly.

416
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,707
You had your lights down low.

417
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,177
I mean, come on.

418
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,212
See, that way..

419
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,115
...we can stop wasting time.

420
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,421
I mean, if this is all
you want..

421
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,458
...here it is.

422
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,127
[chuckling]

423
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,330
See, now, you don't really
need to be drinking

424
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,299
'cause then
you'll really start trippin'.

425
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:04,036
Oh, Timmy.
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy.

426
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,307
Put my fire out.

427
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,908
Say what?

428
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,143
Put..

429
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,078
...my..

430
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,413
...fire..

431
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,282
...out.

432
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,322
- Gotcha!
- What?

433
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,723
[doorbell buzzing]

434
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,491
(Woo)
'Better get that.'

435
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,428
Oops! Don't forget the hat.

436
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,699
Sister, huh?

437
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,400
(Hop)
'You ain't watchin'
that porno..'

438
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,203
'...starring Samuel Jackhammer?'

439
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,271
(Frankie)
'Come on out, baby.'

440
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,106
Come on,
open the damn door, boy!

441
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,874
Hey, Tim, what's up, man?

442
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,243
- What's up, fellas, what's up?
- Is that a joint in your mouth?

443
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,877
Oh, hell yeah, here you go, Hop.

444
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,348
Oh, shit, McColly got
the party started up in here.

445
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,917
Hold up. Look,
I-I'm kinda busy now, y'all.

446
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,286
What's going on
with your clothes, Timothy?

447
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,089
Oh, shit, Tim tryin'
to get some trim, y'all.

448
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,557
Who you got in there, boy,
ugly Rita?

449
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,691
Did she get out the kennel?

450
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,792
[barking]

451
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,028
Rita!

452
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,696
Hey, look,
fuck all y'all, okay?

453
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,232
Tim.. Oh..

454
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,769
Uh, I didn't know
that we had more company.

455
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,474
Um, well, fellas,
thanks for coming by.

456
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,210
Um, I'll catch up
to y'all later.

457
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,778
You know how,
you know how it is, man.

458
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,747
Aren't you gonna
invite your friends in?

459
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,882
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,618
And this is?

461
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,887
This is Woo.

462
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,556
Woo, this is the fellas.

463
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,526
'Romaine, Frankie, and Hop.'

464
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,162
Woo?

465
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,197
See, I-I knew
you was part Japan.

466
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,167
Um, we were just leavin'.

467
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,336
Perhaps, we'll join you.

468
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,972
Um, we were just gonna
go to a movie. Somethin' dull.

469
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,307
What movie?

470
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,075
Um, why don't you finish
getting dressed?

471
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,044
You know how I hate to miss
the beginning of the movie.

472
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,019
Home alone, huh?

473
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,121
Did you fuck her?

474
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,156
Can you watch your mouth,
please?

475
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,124
Is that all y'all think about?

476
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,593
Tim, you know that's too much
woman for you, man.

477
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,997
You gotta crawl before you walk,
brah.

478
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,832
(Hop)
'No, Tim, really,
for real though, yo..'

479
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,133
She a ho, ain't she?

480
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,368
(Frankie)
'No doubt.'

481
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,103
Oh, shit,
Tim done paid for a ho

482
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,671
to come up in here
and do some wild shit!

483
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,940
[laughing]

484
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,208
She do parties?

485
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,677
(Frankie)
'Eh, does she do bar mitzvahs?'

486
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,946
(Hop)
'Does she do ho bar-mitzvahs?'

487
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,184
- She's not a ho, okay?
- Oh, shit.

488
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,486
Tim, she either got
to be gettin' paid

489
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,456
or crazy to be up in here
with your ass, fine as she is.

490
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,623
- 'That's right.'
- You know what?

491
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,725
[Woo screaming]

492
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,128
Oh, shit, that's her pimp, Hop.

493
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,130
Wha-what?

494
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,631
I'mma whoop his ass
and take his money.

495
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,636
(Frankie)
'Oh, no.'

496
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:56,141
You use Red Velvet?

497
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,342
Yeah.

498
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,779
My cousin wore Red Velvet.

499
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,250
It's a popular fragrance.

500
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,254
My cousin was a construction
worker, okay?

501
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,022
And one day

502
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,358
he walked underneath
one of those things

503
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,927
that drives the-the beams
into the ground.

504
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:21,933
- Oh, that's a pile driver.
- 'Right. A pile driver.'

505
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,803
They struck water trying
to get him out of there.

506
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:26,905
Sorry.

507
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,782
[whimpering]

508
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,116
Take it.

509
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,756
(Hop)
'Hey, did you see that?'

510
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,425
(Romaine)
'No, see, I gave him the ball'

511
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,861
'because I think a nice
90 mile an hour curveball'

512
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,130
'would cut all that stuff
short.'

513
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,632
Well, um..

514
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,200
I guess you..

515
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,601
..probably need a minute to--

516
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,472
Yes, it's very true.
I do need a minute.

517
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,074
But I want you
to get that outta here.

518
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,343
- Get it!
- I got it.

519
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,828
Okay,
so she's a little high strung.

520
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,464
Hell, no!
That ho crazy as a rope.

521
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,499
Yeah, man,
Woo in Japan must mean

with seven years bad luck.

523
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,572
Tim, salsa night,
Washington Square Park.

524
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,807
Yo, yo, yo, that's where we'll
be when you finish with Cybil.

525
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,510

527
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,851
Y'all just jealous, that's all.

528
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,023
I really don't like
being referred to as a "Ho."

529
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,092
Look, I'm sorry.

530
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:57,195
Now, I see why there are so many
single women in New York.

531
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,333
- They were just clownin'.
- So was I.

532
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,368
I mean, I hope you didn't
take me seriously.

533
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,470
Look, I'm nothin' like my boys.

534
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,038
Come on, I mean,
they're my boys and everything

535
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,007
but, hey, I'm different.

536
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,009
Can we start over?

537
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,245
Why don't you just let me
take you to dinner?

538
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,947
Great.

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,219
[instrumental music]

540
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,559
Well, what are you doing?

541
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,860
Changing.

542
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,395
In my car?

543
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,430
Well, stop the car
and I'll change on the corner.

544
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,866
[cycle bell ringing]

545
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,005
Man, would you get outta here!
Get outta here! Go!

546
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,074
You are so grouchy.

547
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,142
Sorry.

548
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,580
Sweetheart, I'm gonna open up
another bottle

549
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,015
of the old Nightyard.

550
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,983
Beautiful, baby.

551
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,652
What you want,
peach or watermelon?

552
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,054
'They taste the same.'

553
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,023
Watermelon it is.

554
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:02,827
Oh, shit. Babe,
I got one more hot wing left.

555
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,597
- Want it?
- 'Got for it, baby.'

556
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,199
Hey, babe, I'm thinkin'

557
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,736
maybe, me and you should go
to Shakim's party early.

558
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,104
'What do you think?'

559
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,073
I think there'll be none
of that shit tonight.

560
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,375
- Huh?
- 'Sit tight, sweetheart.'

561
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,544
Big Willie cometh.

562
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,913
"Big Willie cometh?"

563
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,382
Come on, Willie,
we got work to do.

[chuckles]

569
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,080
It's a great table.
Really wonderful.

570
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,148
This is the best I could do
without a reservation.

571
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,250
But you'll love the food.

572
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,252
Do they serve spaghetti here?

573
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,954
- 'Spaghetti?'
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,756
Woo, this is a three star
Italian restaurant.

575
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:08,293
You can have any dish you want,
authentically prepared.

576
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,495
And you want spaghetti?

577
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,497
Well, what would you suggest,
Homeboyardi?

578
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,635
Trust me, okay?

579
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,740
Yes, sir.
May I take your order?

580
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,342
Yes, you may.

581
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:27,912
I'd like the pollo al perd..

584
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:41,760
And, uh, for the lady,
the "Giletto Don Cornelio.."

585
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,597
Yes, the number 23. Very good,
sir, I understand.

586
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,332
Uh, how about some wine, yes?

587
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,867
Um..

588
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,436
Una bottiglia di chianti,
per favore.

[chuckles]

591
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,515
Oh, I learned a little Italian

592
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,517
while daddy was touring
in Europe.

593
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,119
I speak a little Italian too,
you know.

594
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,721
[imitates Sylvester Stallone]
Yo, I'm at my house, Mick?
My house stinks.

595
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,190
And that stings!
That stings me.

596
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,160
Stallone, get it?

597
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,729
But you never answered
my question.

598
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,866
Do you have a girlfriend?

599
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,368
Well, as a matter of fact,
not at the moment.

600
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,973
A lawyer and you're not even
spoken for? That's surprising.

601
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:32,210
Well, let's just say
I'm a little old-fashioned.

602
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,845
- Who's this?
- Where did you get that?

603
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,647
- Hey, hey.

608
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,672
Very funny.
Do you think Mr. Don Corleone

609
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,941
can give me some water
next time, please?

610
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,380
I hate weddings.

611
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,682
- Excuse me?
- 'Wait a minute..'

612
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,617
'Oh, my God.'

613
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,720
Tookie!

614
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,288
- Tookie!
- 'Good Lord.'

615
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,360
Tookie! Tookie!

00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,062
(female #2)
'I thought there was something
wrong.'

617
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,097
That's my girlfriend.
Come meet her.

618
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,567
- What up, Took!
- We'll lose our table.

619
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:33,404
[screaming]
Coincidence time or what, girl?

620
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,540
Oh, oh, do you think
I shoulda worn the headdress

621
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,475
like the other bridesmaids?

622
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,612
Absolutely, it's tradition.

623
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,780
Woo, we're gonna lose our table.

624
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,581
- 'Oh..'
- What the..

625
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:47,418
You got a lotta nerve showing
your face around here, Eric.

626
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,654
What the hell is your problem?

627
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,122
(Woo)
'Tookie, you need your glasses.'

628
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,258
This is not Eric.

629
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:57,095
Damn, if you don't look
a lot like Eric.

630
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,998
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Well, damn, I ain't. Okay?

631
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,967
LensCrafters, they have your
shit ready in less than an hour.

632
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,402
I'll be inside, Woo.

633
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,437
What is up with Bryant Gumbel?

634
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,907
He is a little stuffy, isn't he?

635
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,342
I'm trying to loosen him up
a little bit.

636
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,849
What am I doin' here?

637
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,220
[instrumental music]

638
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,838
Mmm.

639
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,979
Hey, I brought you a piece.

640
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,014
No, thank you.
I don't wanna ruin my appetite.

641
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,718
Alright, suit yourself. Mmm.

'Coconut mango.'

643
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,858
Look, I'm sorry about Tookie,
but she just with the, um..

644
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:09,067
- What?
- Would you like a better view?

645
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,202
She looked familiar, okay?

646
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,639
Well, that's not surprising.

647
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,208
Since they all do
from the ass down, Timmy.

648
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,645
Ow. Ow!

649
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,316
Can't they just move this thing?

650
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,819
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir. Hi.

651
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,722
Sir, over here.

652
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,290
You know what? Forget it.

653
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,894
What are you doing?

654
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,996
I am doing
a little redecorating.

655
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,832
- Woo.
- Oh.

656
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,002
Uh, miss, please don't tamper
with the fire extinguisher.

657
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,271
How am I supposed to eat
like this, huh?

658
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,439
Why are we sitting
at the funky table?

659
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,175
As you can see, we're full.

660
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,911
Oh, you're full tonight,
so you sit

661

'We didn't work hard enough
in the fields'

663
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,216

Hey, I am talking
to Ricky Ricardo here.

667
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,858
We might as well be
in the storage room, okay?

668
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,127
Look at all of this, huh?

669
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,195
And what about this rope?

670
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,767

Why you gotta lay your hand
on me though, man?

674
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,292
And don't come back.

675

- Oh, it's like that, huh?
- Yes, it's like that.

676

Signore, uh, your check, sir.

677
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,934
And I took the liberty

00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,971
of wrapping
your pollo alla gratiscucci.

You don't, you don't need those,
do you?

No, not anymore, I don't.

Hey, yo, man, relax, man.

695
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,247
I see you finally got rid
of that crazy girl.

696
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,649
Her name is Woo
and she's not crazy, okay?

697
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,484
Hey, hey, hey,

00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,852
I mean, you know,

[laughing]

701
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,224
[singing continues]

702
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,973
[cheering]

703
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,446
(Woo)
'Tim.'

704
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,050
Whoo.

705
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,654
Hey, Tim. Where have you been?
You're missing all the fun.

706
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,058
Yo, yo, yo, check that out.
Check that out. Hey, hey.

707
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,193
Hey, cutie!

708
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,362
Not you, your booty.

709
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,300
[chuckling]

710
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,203
Actually, I, uh..

711
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,806

Let's step outta here.

719
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,164
- 'Come on.'
- 'See you didn't need that..'

720
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,333
I don't particularly care
for those young men.

721
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,268
'They don't respect women.'

722
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,470
Look, they ain't that bad, okay?

723
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,506
Frankie works

724
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,508

00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,450
[indistinct chatter]

728
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,119
I was, like,
"Smack me, come on. Smack me."

729
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,254
Thank you.

730
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,191
Mm. Mm.

731
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,093
Ah, nah, I don't like spicy.
It's just too--

732
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,295
Oh, live.

733
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,930
Cheese!

734
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,268
So, what were you saying
about propane?

735
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:13,171
Um, Romaine, he's got a CPA.

736
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:18,142
These are some smart, political,
sensitive brothers.

737
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:21,279
[screaming]

738
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,314
(Hop)
'Damn, baby girl,

739
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,815
'and make
the right one jealous.'

740
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:28,319
Me so horny. Whoo! Me so horny.

741
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,620
Hey, mira, why don't you

00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,089

743
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,895
Frankie, why don't you show me

744
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,731
Hey, Woo, why don't you let me

straightjacket?

746
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,671
You are so funny.

747
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,506
'But you know what
I love best about you?'

748
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,007
Oh, no. Hell, no!

749
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,842
Tim, you need to take control
of your woman.

750
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,512
- 'Yeah, what's up?'
- Hey, man, y'all started this.

751
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,181
Rosa! Look here,

752
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,749
- I know you can relate to this.
- Uh-huh.

753
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,384
Looky here.

00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,196
...with a little
Jerry Curl Coffee Cream.

757
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:15,399
And over there,
we have a little Nappy Road.

758
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,536
- Oh, I see the Nappy Road--
- Focus, man, focus.

759
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,771
[speaking in Spanish]

760
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,607
Did she just call me

761
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,609
Hey, yo, later for this shit,

762
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,010
You gonna roll with us

763
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,979
for her medication to kick in?

764
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,781
You lucky Romaine
didn't hurt you.

765
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,251
Oh, excuse me.
I don't think so.

766
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,418
Gimme a quarter.

767
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,786
Gimme got hit by a truck.

768
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:39,357

769
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,559
Please, please, please.

00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,528
There, there, here..
Okay, take it.

(Celestrial on recorder)
'It's me, sugar. You should not
be listening to this machine.'

772
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,307
'You should be out there
searching'

773
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,575
'for the one I predicted.'

774
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,143
'I'm at the club

775
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,411
(Shakim on recorder)
'Yo, Woo, this Shakim.'

776
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,446
'Hit me on the celly, lover.'

777
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,255
Yo, who this?

778
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,324
It's Woo. What's up, Shakim?

779
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,226
Hey, I don't know.
I mean, what's up with you?

780
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,894

Excuse me, could you talk to me,

784
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,901
...around like a basketball.

785
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,904
- 'Shakim.'
- Hold on one second.

786
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,773

00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,684
Aye, fuck what you heard.
It ain't your world, big girl.

791
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,486
- It ain't your world.

792
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,821
Now, what's up?

793
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,122
You comin' through or what?

794
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,491
No, I'm not coming.

795
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,193
(Woo)
'You just don't understand.'

796
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,696
'Look, this is very difficult

797
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,664
Denise!

798
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,667
Denise, I need to talk to you!
Hey! Denise..

799
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,437
- 'You better stop right now.'
- Need a lift? Sucker!

800
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,842
I need to talk to you.
Denise...listen to me. Hey!

801
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,844
Look, I need to talk to you.

802
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,181
Damn!

803
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,450
Ain't this a bitch!

804
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,687
I told you, no.

805
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,056
You know what?
Don't even come through, okay?

806
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,926
- Don't even come through.
- Shak, h-hello?

807
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,863
[scoffs]

808
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,567
Excuse me.

809
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,871
Who's that?

810
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,341
Yeah, yeah, me and her go way,
way, way back.

811
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:40,311
That's, um, the girl
from the picture. Yeah.

812
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,180
- Mm-hmm.
- She-she needed a car.

813
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,318
She didn't have any credit.
So, like a damn fool, I--

814
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,654
Wait a minute.
Did you co-sign for that car?

815
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,225
Well, yeah.
I-I co-signed for the car.

816
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,593
I mean, she needed one.

817
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,928
I didn't know I'd gonna have
to go through hell

818
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,830
to get the car back.

819
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,400
Tim, you're a lawyer. Sue her.

820
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,901
It's not that simple, I mean--

821
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,936
There are people
who watch things happen

822
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,205
and there are people
who make things happen.

823
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,374
- Which one are you?
- Oh, I'm a maker.

824
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,410
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I-I make things happen.

825
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,112
Okay, well, let's get to makin'
somethin' happen, fella.

826
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,180
Come on.

827
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,516
Then let's set it off then, hey.

828
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:21,519
Yeah, that's how I do it,
you know.

829
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,120
You know what I'm talking about,
see? Systematics.

830
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,555
Right.

831
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,357
- Here you go.
- Voila!

832
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,626
Yeah, it's nothin'
but the Benjamin, baby.

833
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,831
(Lenny)
'Where's my money?'

834
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:38,969
I said where's my money,
bitch?

835
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,639
Unh-unh, wait.
Damn it, Lenny!

836
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,376
What is a chicken ho?

837
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,412
Hey, baby, look. Look.

838
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,615
Sweetheart, I thought
I explained this to you, I..

839
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:55,586
You-you know big daddy

840
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:59,290
And-and, you know

And you know big daddy
loves you.

842
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,261
This is one time I thought
we'd do something different.

843
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,996
Oh, look at you.

844
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,165

Let me go right now!

1039
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,575
I don't even like you, Lamar.

1040
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,377
Wait a minute, I just wanna talk
to you, alright?

1041
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,980
- Just give me a second.
- Woo, what's going on?

1042
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,049
What you got to do with this,
nigger?

1043
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,484
Hey, we have no problem.

1044
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,053
What are you,
a fucking regulator?

1045
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,921
This is my woman, fool.

1046
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:00,724
- Go on, tell him.
- Ex-woman, Lamar.

1047
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,393
Okay? And you really need
to get with that.

1048
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,595
Oh, huh! Look here, girl.

1049
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,998
I ain't gonna ask you again.

1050
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,634
Hey, this sister is with me.

1051
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,237
You know, you keep playin'
the hero and you're gonna

1052
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,606
find your ass fucked up.

1053
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,941
Look..

1054
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,776
Oh!

1055
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,014
(man #3)
'Nigga got a gun!'

1056
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,683
- Oh!
- Oh!

1057
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,590
You..

1058
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,462
Lamar, you didn't have
to hit him.

1059
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,697
Yes, I did.

1060
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:44,067
- No, you didn't.
- 'Oh!'

1061
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:47,304
(Woo)
'Oh, now. Now what?'

1062
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:50,273
I know
what you're tryin' to say.

1063
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,808
What you tryin' to say now?

1064
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,243
I know you ain't tryin' to say
nothin'.

1065
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,378
You ain't sayin' nothin'
but a word.

1066
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,981
You had to set her off,
didn't ya, leisure suit?

1067
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,317
- This brother here, man.
- And you know what, Woo?

1068
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,119
Every week there's something
new with you.

1069
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,122
You and Sammy Davis gotta
get the fuck up out of here.

1070
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,490
All I wanted do was just get out
of the house.

1071
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,692
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Come on.

1072
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,396
(Beast)
'Looking like Tweedledee
and Tweedledum.'

1073
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,398
Bringin' up Jerry's kids.

1074
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:21,004
You got me, huh?
You got me again.

1075
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:25,308
Lenny. Lenny put you up to this,
didn't he? That's it.

1076
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,310
Lenny found the finest woman
he could

1077
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,745
and he wants to see
how long it'll take

1078
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,747
before I say, "Fuck it!"

1079
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,351
Well, you know what?
Fuck it!

1080
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,753
Alright? You win, okay?

1081
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,791
I bet you, Woo isn't even
your real name, is it?

1082
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,126
It's cool. It's cool.

1083
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,528
Why don't we just get in the car

1084
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,763
and I'll take you home, okay?

1085
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,100
[car alarm beeping]

1086
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,738
What?

1087
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,175
'My car!'

1088
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,311
What am I supposed to do
with this shit now?

1089
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,280
Don't you say a word!

1090
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:12,622
Is my name Crayola?
Oh, I gets my man.

1091
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:13,957
Well, then, you know
it would've been on

1092
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,225
'cause you know last week
in a grocery store

1093
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,194
me and her
was about to get to boxin'.

1094
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,895
Girl, her baby ain't got
no infamy'

1095
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,664
'or something crazy like that.
I don't know.'

1096
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:24,067
Mnm-mnm, 'cause Lenny told me
that she wanted to get with him.

1097
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,069
- 'Girl, I was fly.'
- Excuse me.

1098
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:27,704
I could've been little fly
if I would've got

1099
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,973
my orange patent leather suit
up out the cleaners.

1100
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,175
I'll be in the cell,
my friend is here.

1101
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,843
- Fine.
- 'Oh, but girl--'

1102
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:35,378
Excuse me.

1103
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,782
Hold on for one second, Purina.

1104
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,418
What?

1105
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,653
My car was stolen
about half an hour ago.

1106
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:46,423
- Have you reported it?
- That's why I came here.

1107
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,857
What took you so long?

1108
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,859
Yeah, but it took me some time
to walk..

1109
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,494
Is there someone
I can talk to--

1110
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,064
First of all you got the wrong
form, so chill out.

1111
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,167
Hello, Purina.
Well, then call me back.

1112
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,270
Girl, use 911, I'll get it.
Okay.

1113
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,738
Here you go.

1114
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,041
Get you a pen here,
and you're all set. Take this.

1115
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:09,145
Now exactly.. Ex-excuse me.
Excuse me.

1116
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,253
Okay, I need to see
your registration please.

1117
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,555
It's in the car. I leave it
in my glove compartment.

1118
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,423
That's awfully dumb.

1119
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,891
You leave your license
in the glove compartment, too?

1120
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,761
Look, it's been a long night,
okay?

1121
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,563
All I wanna do is report
a stolen car

1122
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,198
and get the hell outta here!

1123
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:32,435
Now can I please talk to someone
who's got a GED?

1124
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,704
- Oh, no, you didn't.
- Look, I'm sorry.

1125
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,973
Look, I almost got my GED,
motherfucker

1126
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:38,808
so you can kiss my ass!

1127
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:39,876
Oh, Lord.

1128
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:42,445
I know you better quit trippin'.

1129
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,580
Look, I don't care if you never

1130
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,215
find your little
raggedy-ass car.

1131
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,883
- You hear me?
- What's the problem, Crayola?

1132
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,451
Itty-bitty Negro committee
over here

1133
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,920
don't know what to say
about his mouth.

1134
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,255
- I was--
- Shut up.

1135
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,791
- What'd he do?
- Stolen car.

1136
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,294
- Oh, you stole a car.
- No, I didn't..

1137
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,462
Man, it's my car!
Man, what are you doing?

1138
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,665
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
let's see some ID, brother.

1139
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,433
(Crayola)
'911, what's the emergency?'

1140
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,468
- 'Hi, Purina girl..
- What's going on, Tony?

1141
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,337
Can you see
what's going on here?

1142
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,738
You know this guy?

1143
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,907
Oh, well, kind of,
it's our first date

1144
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,310
you know, but he's okay.

1145
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,278
Well, if you say he's cool.

1146
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:16,680
Listen, baby, I gotta jet

1147
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,316
but, we'll keep an eye out
for your car, ya hear?

1148
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,651
Thank you.

1149
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,821
(Crayola)
'I'm not catchin' a bus
to the party in my gear, okay?'

1150
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:29,359
You fuck her over
and it's your ass.

1151
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,295
I got two words for you, man.
Johnnie Cochran.

1152
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,264
Yeah, huh? Yeah.

1153
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,438
Watch it.

1154
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,944
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

1155
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,446
No, I am not okay!

1156
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:53,049
I am definitely not okay, okay?

1157
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:55,885
Well, I want you to know
this hasn't been the most

1158
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,188
fantabulous date for me either.

1159
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,157
So, maybe you should,
what? Stop crying.

1160
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:04,327
- Stop cry.. I'm going home.
- Mnm-mnm.

1161
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,996
I'mma tell you what you need,
Tim.

1162
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:10,367
You need to relax. Okay?

1163
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,168
Now, listen..

1164
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,903
...if you weren't so uptight

1165
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,572
maybe you wouldn't get
into all the trouble

1166
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:17,540
that you've been getting into.

1167
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,309
Oh, I am the trouble?

1168
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:22,145
Well, yeah, something like that.
Mm-hmm.

1169
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,983
I know what the deal is
with you.

1170
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,919
You're too fine for your own
good. That's what it is.

1171
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:32,889
Yeah, people been tellin' you,
"You so fine," all your life

1172
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,225
and you startin' to believe
the hype.

1173
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,094
That's your problem.
You got fine-itis.

1174
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:39,329
[laughing]

1175
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:44,334
I give up. I give up!

1176
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,568
You know what?

1177
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,505
Here. Here.

1178
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,006
Why don't you take a cab

1179
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,242
to whatever else you decide
to destroy tonight.

1180
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,578
[scoffs]
You know, what, Tim,
don't do me any favors, okay?

1181
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,947
I don't need your little bit
of chump change.

1182
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,161
Taxi!

1183
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,842
Now, you know you wanna go
after her.

1184
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,480
Hey, aren't you..

1185
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,182
Your conscience.

1186
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,419
My conscience
looks like Billy Dee?

1187
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:41,458
Think of me as the Billy Dee
in you.

1188
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,959
Works for me.

1189
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,563
So, why aren't you
going after her?

1190
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,798
For a subconscious,
you got a mighty short memory.

1191
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,467
This isn't mahogany.

1192
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,001
I've got enough problems
on my hands

1193
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,103
than to be worried
about some crazy babe.

1194
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,573
Oh, why don't you spend
a little time with the woman?

1195
00:57:56,573 --> 00:58:00,176
Check her out.
Find out what motivates her.

1196
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:03,446
It'll take some energy,
but, it won't kill you.

1197
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,449
[scoffs]
How do you know that?

1198
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,852
Well, my little brother

1199
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:12,455
if you really like her,
you won't let her get away.

1200
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:15,692
She might be..

1201
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:19,429
...the beginning of something

1202
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:23,833
spectacularly beautiful
in your life.

1203
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:28,204
