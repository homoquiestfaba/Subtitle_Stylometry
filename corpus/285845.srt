1
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:45,228
This is a beautiful house.

2
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:48,748
I would never had know there was
a pig or dog farm outside.

3
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:54,782
Really? I think it's like,
in the middle of nowhere.

4
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:58,751
I would like to use this house for
my next advertising shoot.

5
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:03,667
Do you only use friends
houses for locations?

6
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:07,586
Last time it was my place.

7
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:11,790
That's because your house
like a place.

8
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:18,186
I was so jealous everyday you did
nothing but wear beautiful clothes.

9
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,423
Don't be jealous it was boring.

10
00:03:21,512 --> 00:03:24,549
I wanted to work but my parents
wouldn't allow it.

11
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:29,387
Yeah, but Jum has a good business
using no workers...

12
00:03:29,472 --> 00:03:33,306
...just a few pigs and dogs.

13
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:39,388
Jum said that the staff went home
and they'll be back on Monday.

14
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:44,751
That means this weekend there'll
be only us,

15
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:49,144
...and our mobile phones
don't even work.

16
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:54,783
That fits the plot
for a movie murder scene.

17
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:57,545
You read my mind.

18
00:03:57,632 --> 00:03:59,862
I just tried to call home
but my mobile doesn't work either.

19
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:03,149
I've got to use the house phone.

20
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:09,228
In such a lonely atmosphere,
We might have a sleepless night.

21
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:13,180
Let's find Jum
and get something to eat.

22
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:54,864
If we get drunk I have something
much better wine to offer you.

23
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:58,786
Don't tell me you've got us
a porno movie.

24
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:05,186
Are you nuts? Actually it's
this stuff here you go.

25
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:10,824
That's why you've been
so happy all day.

26
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:18,986
I haven't smoked
any pot for ten years.

27
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:22,946
Yeah, I almost forgot how it tastes.

28
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,626
It's the "Miss-Goy-Brand",
the "herbal specialist"...

29
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:28,829
...personally guarantees the quality.

30
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,822
Here, have some, Jum!

31
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:37,507
No thanks, better not.
I am afraid of getting stoned.

32
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:41,346
The smoke from you is already
more than enough.

33
00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:43,662
It' won't kill, Jum.

34
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:49,829
It's just like a cigarette.

35
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:57,150
Come on, try a bit.

36
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:06,262
Looks like we've forced
a nun to sin.

37
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:10,311
Don't rush it. Slowly, gently.

38
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:36,425
Let's talk about the good old times
before we get too wasted?

39
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:37,945
What shall we talk about?

40
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:41,229
There are so many things,
I don't know where to start.

41
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:46,591
Politics! What do you think
about the present government?

42
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,503
That's way too serious.

43
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:54,747
What about something more fun,
like erotic experiences.

44
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:59,462
Are you crazy?
Your mood changes quickly.

45
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:03,943
A moment ago you were sad,
now you're the naughty nurse.

46
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:09,868
Why do you think it's so bad.
There is nothing wrong with sex.

47
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:17,745
I'm asking all four of you,
are you still virgins?

48
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:30,385
You've all had sex it's natural.
Why do you pretend to be shy?

49
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:33,789
It's so embarrassing. Do you think
it's good to talk about it?

50
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:40,587
I don't know how to start,
it's such a long story.

51
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:57,308
Oh god, a sudden storm,
it's terrifying.

52
00:07:57,512 --> 00:07:58,911
Jum, do you have any candles?

53
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:02,348
Light them or some ghosts
might come, Jum.

54
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:05,105
Quickly! It's fucking dark.

55
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:07,664
It's ok, it's always like here.

56
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:16,626
Even if a cat fart's
there's a power cut,

57
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:20,387
...just like a totally
underdeveloped country.

58
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:25,592
Let's find a way to go some light
into this place.

59
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,981
- I'm scared.
- Don't be afraid.

60
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:31,350
Jum, Maem, Ann quickly.

61
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:33,388
Calm down Goy.

62
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:36,427
But, I'm afraid.

63
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,222
This atmosphere is really
intimidating.

64
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,872
When will the danger be over?

65
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:51,865
Or Meaw wants to take us with her?

66
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:56,264
Don't talk like that. I'm so scared.

67
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:59,947
Maem! Think we should talk about
something a bit lighter.

68
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:06,028
Smoking pot in this kind of
atmosphere will just send you nuts.

69
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:10,105
It's my own fault for smoking ganja,
I'm a sinner...

70
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:12,023
...I'm being punished by the gods.

71
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:23,267
I think we should find
something that's fun to do.

72
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:27,186
Like talking about our most
embarrassing sexual experiences.

73
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:30,423
What do you think?

74
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:34,628
Not a bad idea.
Then it won't be so quiet.

75
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:41,185
I don't know what to say, especially
in this kind of situation.

76
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:48,144
Ok! But when I'm finished don't
you say I've been exaggerating.

77
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:52,544
Right then, who's first?

78
00:09:52,632 --> 00:10:00,107
All right, I'll start. It is a story
that I will never forget because...

79
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:02,183
...it was an will thing
that happened to me.

80
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:06,231
It was the most sinful
sex of my life.

81
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:11,105
I love you so much, Ann!

82
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:14,901
I know, I love you too.

83
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:23,706
Please, not so hard, slow down,
it hurts, I'm bruised.

84
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,663
I can't hold it back anymore.

85
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:35,741
No, my love. Don't. It's only
three weeks until our wedding.

86
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:40,788
I'll wait for the day.

87
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:49,586
Don't be sad.
You do understand me, don't you?

88
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:59,265
I understand but my leg's gone stiff.

89
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,262
Think about something else.

90
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:05,708
It's time for my shift,
I'll call you.

91
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,465
I've gotta go to the ward now.

92
00:11:09,072 --> 00:11:15,705
Be careful tonight I might come
to your room while you're asleep.

93
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:23,585
I'm not afraid that you'll come,
I'm afraid that you won't. Bye bye.

94
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:35,066
Take a seat. Hello, Miss Sawika.

95
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,667
Is there anything you would
like me to do, sir?

96
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:49,310
I called you here as you are
the Deputy-Head of Ward 5.

97
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:55,786
We have a V.I. P patient in your
ward that I would like you...

98
00:11:55,872 --> 00:12:01,583
...to give special care and
attention to.

99
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:04,546
Who is that patient, sir?

100
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:07,871
I cannot disclose this right now,

101
00:12:07,952 --> 00:12:15,540
...as the patient's family
has asked for discretion.

102
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:25,906
But if you take good care of him,
it will be for your own benefit.

103
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:32,349
Yes, sir.
I will do the best I can, sir.

104
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:35,469
Can I leave this with you,
Miss Sawika?

105
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:37,622
Yes, goodbye.

106
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:40,067
May Buddha bless you, my dear.

107
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:47,583
Do you suffer from any
allergies to certain medicines?

108
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:53,022
Not to medicines but love
causes me pain.

109
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:57,103
Do you have any chronic
diseases or ailments?

110
00:12:57,192 --> 00:13:04,030
No diseases, but I've experienced
a repeatedly broken heart.

111
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,906
Where is this scar from?

112
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:15,660
It's an old one.
I got it a long time ago.

113
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:19,712
So let's give you a complete
check up.

114
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,511
I'm always ready and prepared
to prove my masculinity to you,

115
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:25,106
...here in Bangkapi.

116
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:05,387
My sweetheart,
have mercy on me.

117
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:21,109
Ketsinee, Sawika, don't fool
around and forget to check...

118
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:24,707
...the patient's temperature
in room 502...

119
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:29,661
...at 1:00 am. You forgot to
last time, didn't you?

120
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:34,701
Yes, ma'am.
You can call me Kate, Ju.

121
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:40,901
Shit! You're frivolous, aren't you?
Acting all innocent in front of me.

122
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:43,062
Don't forget to take care of the
V.I. P patient...

123
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:44,665
...which the director ordered,

124
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:50,190
In fact you'd better stay
there continuously.

125
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:57,747
I'll go in a minute. But, it's been
less than half an hour since I left.

126
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:06,024
Do you know any details about
the patient, Ju?

127
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:13,348
Not really, I only know that his
parents have done favours for...

128
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:16,183
...the hospital.

129
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:19,867
Ann, take care of him well.
Didn't the director tell you...

130
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:23,024
...to take personal care
of him?

131
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:26,909
I guess he must be
the director's creditor.

132
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:33,591
Shit! I've gotta leave so I can do
a detailed calculation to find out...

133
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:38,381
...how much the director owes
this patient.

134
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:43,550
What are you doing?

135
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:48,581
I like it, don't stop.

136
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:53,707
Do you mean you lost
your virginity to a retard?

137
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:58,024
That's ok as long as
he was handsome.

138
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:00,421
How many times did you do it?

139
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,821
What happened next?

140
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:10,626
What could I do? I had to keep
going but that's not the end of it.

141
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,391
We're here, grandfather.

142
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:23,185
Is this where Lek
has been admitted to?

143
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:29,666
Do you think it's as good as
Boston Hospital, Chai?

144
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:32,710
- Slowly, father.
- Be careful.

145
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:37,422
I just found out that you have moved
Lek to the hospital where Ann works.

146
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:42,632
You cannot tell Ann about this.
It's a family secret.

147
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:47,103
I don't want anyone to know that
the youngest son of...

148
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:52,869
...the Naruebalboripok
family is retard.

149
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:59,551
That's why we sent him
to America for twenty years.

150
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:06,228
Good evening, your honour,
Mr. Damgerng, Mr. Chawee and Mrs. Nai.

151
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:09,190
I see you've all arrived together.

152
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:17,630
Which room, doctor?
I really want to see my grandson.

153
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:20,590
Please, walk slowly, father.

154
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,106
It's here on the left, sir.

155
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:36,822
Hello all, very funny.
This sister is a very good horse rider.

156
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:40,861
I can imagine the expression
on your face.

157
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:44,706
You shouldn't laugh,
it isn't funny, it's distressing!

158
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:48,785
After that I was forced to resign...

159
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:51,705
...and I haven't seen
my boyfriend since.

160
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:58,231
Don't worry, I would've done
the same, Everyone makes mistakes.

161
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,187
Your situation was nothing
compared to mine, Ann.

162
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:04,628
Mine was much more embarrassing.

163
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:08,466
What!
There's something worse than that?

164
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:13,228
Definitely! My case, also happened
many years ago.

165
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:40,066
Quickly, Pong,
I can't take it anymore.

166
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:45,385
Just a second, darling!
Why is it so difficult to get it in?

167
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:53,387
Shit! Why is someone calling now.
We're just getting to the hot stuff.

168
00:18:53,912 --> 00:19:05,107
Hello, what is it, my dear?
Sorry, inspector, how can I help?

169
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:10,750
Sir, yes, sir! I'm free, sir.

170
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:17,021
I'll be there in fifteen minutes,
sir. Goodbye, sir.

171
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:25,061
Sorry, Joy. I must rush.

172
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:27,712
There's just been
a deadly shoot out.

173
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,909
And I have to get there before
the inspector arrives.

174
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:36,669
Pong, are you gonna leave
me in this state?

175
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:41,780
I really want to do it too, Joy.
My dick is going crazy.

176
00:19:41,872 --> 00:19:44,830
But what can I do, darling?
Work must come first.

177
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:51,624
It's always the same, Pong.
Work, work, work.

178
00:19:51,712 --> 00:20:00,507
I'm so sorry, Joy. Don't be angry.
Just wait until I've finished.

179
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:03,868
Then we can carry on until
the house collapses.

180
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,989
But now I really must go.

181
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:12,783
Don't be late, Pong,
I'll be waiting. Drive safely.

182
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:15,508
OK. I'll be back soon.

183
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:24,948
Fuck it, I'll make myself climax.

184
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:29,627
No! It's 7:30 already. Gotta go.

185
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:32,351
It's my first class today too.

186
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:36,220
Damn it! Everything's a mess.

187
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:41,388
Students. Today we will study
the C Major scale.

188
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:46,023
C Major is an increasing scale,
comprising of 7 notes.

189
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:51,470
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti.

190
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:56,672
And then one more time.
All together now three, four.

191
00:20:56,752 --> 00:21:05,547
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do.

192
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:21,947
I'm tried, Let's just talk.
Did you understand that?

193
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:25,548
Do you understand when I speak?

194
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:31,908
Today I'm so happy to teach you know
to Love art, especially water colour

195
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:35,268
When doing art we have to use all
our energy to form our imagination.

196
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,468
Use our imagination to inspire
something tangible. Now, water colours

197
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:41,707
There should be an abundance
of water and colour.

198
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:44,431
Every stroke can make
something beautiful.

199
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,982
Our imagination can form the picture
we are still, but not asleep.

200
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:50,142
Because if were asleep then
we could not be still.

201
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:52,541
Do you understands?
We have to enhance...

202
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:55,590
...our feelings an imagination.
Do you understand?

203
00:21:55,672 --> 00:21:58,982
If you understand imagination,
the we can begin.

204
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:06,627
Where are you going?
You have no soul. This is art.

205
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:09,180
I don't understand.
Do you think I'm mad!

206
00:22:09,272 --> 00:22:12,184
Do you know that insanity
and genius go hand in hand?

207
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:17,062
Before we get started, I would
like you all to introduce yourselves.

208
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:20,622
As there are many new faces
here today.

209
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:25,706
I'm Pimpailin Saipan, 22 years old
and I like to play Thai music.

210
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,182
I'm Panthawil Tonpinij, 20 years old
and I enjoy swimming.

211
00:22:30,712 --> 00:22:34,910
I'm Cholthcha Sutisunthoratham,
23 years old and I like painting.

212
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:47,946
I'm Perapol Jitrangsan,
17 years old and I enjoy rugby.

213
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
What should we do next, teacher?

214
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:18,181
Sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'm imaging to something.

215
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,706
That we're introduced ourselves...

216
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:23,147
...what would you like
us to do next, teacher?

217
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:31,984
As it's your first day,
I think I'll give you an easy task.

218
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:35,189
I want you to write about
the feelings you had...

219
00:23:35,272 --> 00:23:40,141
...when you watched a love scene
which impressed you most.

220
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:42,302
Not long than one page.

221
00:23:42,392 --> 00:23:46,624
When you are finished I
What's your name?

222
00:23:46,712 --> 00:23:49,590
I'm Peerapol Jitrangsan, ma'am.

223
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:54,223
O.K. Perapol I want you to collect
everybody's homework.

224
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:57,907
Then this evening brig
it to my room.

225
00:23:57,992 --> 00:24:02,668
But I have dancing practice then.
Can't someone else do it?

226
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:06,825
Time's up. Ok, a bit later in
the evening is fine, Perapol.

227
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,507
If I'm not in the staff room
the just leave it on my desk.

228
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:13,504
That's all for today everybody.

229
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:29,664
Come this way. Maybe we'll bump
into the school's director.

230
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:32,630
He likes to look for things to eat
in the food court.

231
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:34,543
He's an irregular eater.

232
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:37,430
Is that him?

233
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:43,667
No, that's Mr. Rawaeng he teaches
different styles of painting.

234
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:45,822
- What about him?
- Him.

235
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:49,309
Him with the white face. That's
Mr. Phaitoon. But I don't know...

236
00:24:49,392 --> 00:24:51,781
...who the young lady is.
He teaches miming techniques.

237
00:24:51,872 --> 00:24:53,351
- Is it him?
- Where?

238
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:56,071
The one who's scolding
the student in the red shirt.

239
00:24:56,152 --> 00:24:59,747
That's Mr. Somsak.
He'll be retiring soon.

240
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,663
He teaches criticism of movies.

241
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:05,631
But no one respects
him as he is too arrogant.

242
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:09,182
I'm sure he'll to resign soon.

243
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:10,944
This guy's the schools
resident grandfather?

244
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:13,500
Yep, something like that.

245
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:16,868
What about this old caretaker
that's coming this way?

246
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:22,743
He must have been here before since
the great-grandfather generation?

247
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:28,031
Joy. This is Mr. Johnnie.
Mr. Johnnie is our director.

248
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:30,751
Sir, this is Penpan.

249
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:33,710
Our new teacher for
Thai cinematography,

250
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:38,661
...as well as social development.
She's replacing Mr. Nirut, sir.

251
00:25:38,752 --> 00:25:41,550
What did you say, Biab?

252
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:48,185
Good afternoon, Miss Penpan.
How was your first day, was it hard?

253
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:51,469
Good afternoon Director,
I thought you were.

254
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:57,229
Yes, she thought
you would be much older.

255
00:25:57,312 --> 00:26:05,981
I'm 60 this year. But I guess some
people just don't look their ago.

256
00:26:06,072 --> 00:26:11,100
Can you come and see me later?

257
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:13,831
I would like to talk to you
before you go home,

258
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:16,665
...in case there is something you
would like me to help you with.

259
00:26:16,752 --> 00:26:21,872
I'm always happy to help you.
Please keep that in mind.

260
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:27,629
Certainly, Sir. I'll meet you
as soon as I've finished my class.

261
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,828
Good-bye.

262
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:36,183
Your mouth almost made us
lose our jobs.

263
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:40,106
I'm sorry.
He really looked like a custodian...

264
00:26:40,192 --> 00:26:43,184
...and on that's 90 years old.

265
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:45,911
Who would've thought
he's the director,

266
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:48,460
...and that he'd be
as wrinkly as that.

267
00:26:48,552 --> 00:26:51,385
Forget about it.
Let's find some food instead.

268
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:10,945
You're soaking with sweat. Have you
just finished your dance class?

269
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:14,468
We're off to see some girls.
Come with us.

270
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:18,306
You know Cherry, the one
who studies ballet. She's cute.

271
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:23,261
You go ahead, I have to take this
report to Miss Penpan.

272
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:26,230
I'll call you when I'm finished.

273
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,665
See you later.

274
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:29,549
Good luck, mate.

275
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,664
Sorry Perapol.

276
00:27:41,072 --> 00:27:46,908
I'm really sorry. I saw the others
leave so I thought no one was here.

277
00:27:46,992 --> 00:27:52,271
It's me that should be sorry.
Is there anything you want me to do?

278
00:27:52,352 --> 00:27:55,344
No. But now that I've seen you.

279
00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:58,185
Don't forget to do the homework
I gave you.

280
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:03,546
I won't forget it, ma'am.
When I finish this, I'll do the rest

281
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:06,749
I'll hand in the homework
immediately after the meeting and...

282
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,663
...the concert dance
with my fellow students

283
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:11,550
Whatever. If you can't find me
in my room.

284
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:15,784
You can bring it to my home behind
the university,

285
00:28:15,872 --> 00:28:19,069
...as I've just met the Director...

286
00:28:19,152 --> 00:28:22,906
...and he would like to
see your reports tomorrow.

287
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:27,304
Yes, I can do that. But did you say
you wanted me to come to your home?

288
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:30,828
Yes, It's the second house on the
right from the beginning of the alley.

289
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:32,311
It's not difficult to find.

290
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:52,391
What the fuck is it, this time!

291
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:56,465
Don't answer it. Keep on going,
I'm just getting horny.

292
00:28:56,552 --> 00:29:03,947
I'm sorry, Joy. I must. We can carry
on again after. It won't take long.

293
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:23,186
Hello, who is it?
Yes, sir. Immediately?

294
00:29:23,272 --> 00:29:26,901
No, I'm not busy sir.
I can meet you in 15 minutes.

295
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:29,381
Yes, it's convenient.

296
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,224
It's not damn well convenient,
we're horny!

297
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,587
Why did you fucking interrupt us.

298
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,265
It's nothing, sir.
It's just the T. V

299
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:40,912
I'll see you in a minute sir.

300
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,065
You can't go and see someone else.
What the hell is going on?

301
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:52,141
It's a T. V drama, sir. The stars
are in the middle of an argument.

302
00:29:52,232 --> 00:29:53,711
I'll see you shortly, sir.

303
00:29:55,512 --> 00:29:59,869
That means you're not gonna finish,
are you?

304
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:03,941
I'm sorry Joy but a policeman's
duty is to his citizens.

305
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:08,628
Whatever the situation I must
always be ready to work.

306
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:11,462
Just wait here and
I'll hurry back, my love.

307
00:30:11,552 --> 00:30:15,227
You're so worried about your work,
asshole. Just piss off.

308
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:21,262
I'll be gone for a minute,
when I come back we can do it twice.

309
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:25,061
- Don't be angry, my love.
- Fuck off! Just go to work.

310
00:30:28,072 --> 00:30:34,227
I won't suck up to you, Pong. I can
find someone else to do this for me.

311
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:58,027
In fact you don't have
any work to do, do you?

312
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,822
This must be
professor Penpan's house.

313
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:08,268
Are you there, Ma'am?
I brought you the reports.

314
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:13,943
Teacher, are you there, Teacher?

315
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:28,625
I'm sorry, Perapol.
I'm taking a shower.

316
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:32,261
Come in and wait.
I'm nearly finished.

317
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:45,263
Excuse me,
I'm not troubling you, am I, ma'am?

318
00:31:45,352 --> 00:31:47,741
Make yourself at home, Perapol.

319
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:52,428
It's no trouble. I'm here alone.

320
00:31:52,552 --> 00:31:56,227
Where would you like me
to put the report.

321
00:31:56,312 --> 00:32:00,703
Put them on the glass table,
and don't rush off.

322
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:03,465
Stay and have something to eat.

323
00:32:05,112 --> 00:32:11,790
No problem, I haven't eaten yet and
I can help you prepare the table.

324
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:19,265
The food is in bags. I'll be going
soon could you give me a hand.

325
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:21,946
Yes, teacher.

326
00:32:58,472 --> 00:33:02,704
Are you going to eat now?
Don't you want to get dressed first?

327
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:06,990
You're not hungry yet, are you?
If you could wait just a minute.

328
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:13,022
Take you time. I can wait,
I'm no that hungry.

329
00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:49,910
Help me! Perapol! Help me!

330
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:54,463
What is it, teacher? What is it?

331
00:33:56,672 --> 00:34:01,029
Help me Perapol. It's a huge rat.
My hair's all on end.

332
00:34:01,112 --> 00:34:02,306
Where is it, Teacher?

333
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:05,270
I saw it over there.
Where is it now?

334
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:12,383
Where, where is it?
I'll squash it myself.

335
00:34:12,472 --> 00:34:14,747
Have you found it, Perapol?

336
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:22,950
What is it, Perapol?
Your look so pale.

337
00:34:23,032 --> 00:34:27,184
Are you afraid of rats too?
Come up on the bed with me.

338
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:33,461
I'm not afraid of rats. I want to.

339
00:34:34,192 --> 00:34:39,744
What do you want, Perapol?
Can I help you?

340
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:49,311
Was that it? I can't see how that
can be worse than mine.

341
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:51,383
Actually I'm jealous.

342
00:35:51,472 --> 00:35:55,260
Yeah, it's a small mistake.
You just got off with a student.

343
00:35:55,352 --> 00:36:01,188
It was just taking a youngster's
virginity. It's not bad, trust me.

344
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:03,422
Did your boyfriend come back, Joy?

345
00:36:03,512 --> 00:36:08,381
No, it was much worse then that.

346
00:36:08,472 --> 00:36:10,781
Who would've thought that.

347
00:36:10,872 --> 00:36:15,992
Joy, when you called, I though you
would be coming this evening.

348
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:17,983
Come in.

349
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:21,462
Hello Dao.
This is Pong my boyfriend.

350
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:23,551
Hello.

351
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:25,985
That's all for now, sir.

352
00:36:26,072 --> 00:36:30,907
That's why I started teaching
near here. Because I missed you.

353
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:36,669
I'm sorry, My first day was so busy,
but today is Saturday so I'm free.

354
00:36:36,752 --> 00:36:41,542
It's no problem. You can see me
anytime you're free, sis.

355
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,749
Kaeng is upstairs,
would you like to see him?

356
00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:52,750
Kaeng, you son? It's been 10 years.
He must be a young man now.

357
00:36:52,832 --> 00:36:55,630
Where is my nephew?

358
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:59,705
He's upstairs. He came home late
last night because he was out...

359
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:03,626
...with his friends. I'll call him.

360
00:37:03,712 --> 00:37:07,466
Kaeng sweetie, Auntie Joy is here.

361
00:37:07,552 --> 00:37:10,783
Yes, Mum. I coming. Sorry mum
I was just having a shower.

362
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:15,627
Hello Auntie Joy.

363
00:37:21,592 --> 00:37:26,620
Here's your nephew.
This year he'll be 17.

364
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:29,909
Actually I think he might study
at your school Joy.

365
00:37:29,992 --> 00:37:31,710
Isn't that right Kaeng?

366
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:38,025
Why do you two look so shocked?

367
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:51,109
That situation has haunted
me until this day.

368
00:37:51,192 --> 00:37:54,389
From a sin from an urge,

369
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,191
...a sin that cheats your lover,

370
00:37:57,272 --> 00:38:01,311
...a sin with your own student.

371
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:09,546
But retribution will be with me
until the day I die.

372
00:38:09,632 --> 00:38:15,229
I can't hide from my nephew.

373
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:19,669
I've got to see him sometime.

374
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:24,425
I can't speak about this for
the rest of my life.

375
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,585
Are you still with policeman Joy?

376
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:31,789
We split up 2 years ago.

377
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:36,741
He never forget work and
didn't have a clue about timing.

378
00:38:36,832 --> 00:38:40,666
It's better to stay alone with
an egg plant.

379
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:45,428
Are you still doing yourself with
an egg plant, Joy?

380
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:50,745
Stay in a temple, just for a while.
Don't worry too much.

381
00:38:50,832 --> 00:38:52,060
Don't get too depressed Joy.

382
00:38:52,152 --> 00:38:56,464
Once you listen to my experience
then you'll see that...

383
00:38:56,552 --> 00:39:00,227
...yours and Ann's
story is worthless.

384
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:03,827
What! There's something worse
than mine and Joy's situation.

385
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:08,906
Definitely. Much, much worse.

386
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:17,583
Jack, you don't have to drive
so fast. It is dangerous.

387
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:20,232
You haven't got a clue,
just shut up!

388
00:39:20,312 --> 00:39:21,142
I didn't buy a sports car
to drive slowly.

389
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:23,621
What the fuck
would that be good for?

390
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:26,180
Just lean back,
relax and don't argue, Goy!

391
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:29,264
How can I relax when you're
drive like crazy.

392
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:30,944
Please, watch out, Jack.

393
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:33,227
Sleep, so you won't see
anything then.

394
00:39:36,472 --> 00:39:40,147
How the hell are you
crossing the road?

395
00:39:40,232 --> 00:39:43,542
This is a car, not a dick. If it were
I would have hit you already.

396
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:48,342
I'm sorry. I was just crossing to
get to a fashion shoot.

397
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:51,549
I was using the zebra crossing.

398
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:58,549
Right. Cindy, My mistake.
Sometimes I drive like an idiot.

399
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:03,342
I nearly caused an accident and made
you late or even hurt, Cindy.

400
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:05,707
Stop pinching, Goy that hurts.

401
00:40:12,152 --> 00:40:15,110
What are you looking at?
I'm pissed off, OK!

402
00:40:15,192 --> 00:40:17,831
I almost hit a star.

403
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:23,225
Acting like you're pissed off, with
that stupid expression on your face.

404
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:30,066
I felt sorry for her.
She's a woman, one of the weaker sex.

405
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:44,431
You said we were gonna watch a movie.

406
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:51,065
Here you go, porno. What do you want
to watch, Western, Japanese, Thai.

407
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:52,983
They have them all here.

408
00:40:53,072 --> 00:40:56,985
But I want to watch "Three".

409
00:40:57,072 --> 00:41:00,030
We've tried very hard and it took us
so long to get tickets for it.

410
00:41:00,112 --> 00:41:02,342
It's a full house.

411
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:05,469
I don't want to see that!

412
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:08,942
I want to have sex.
Do you understand?

413
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:10,670
If you don't want to, just go home.

414
00:41:11,432 --> 00:41:16,108
Jack, it's so like you.
Sex on the brain!

415
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,745
I've got to take car to the garage.

416
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:29,188
Don't forget the party tonight
at 10.00 p.m. Pick me up from home.

417
00:41:29,272 --> 00:41:32,662
Yes, my lord and master.
You're so bossy!

418
00:41:37,992 --> 00:41:39,311
DRINK SOLD B Y MEN!

419
00:41:43,272 --> 00:41:48,630
Are you interested, beautiful lady?
Would you can for?

420
00:41:48,712 --> 00:41:50,623
Is it read?

421
00:41:50,712 --> 00:41:54,466
Yes, it is. Ice tea, the cool heart
of Thailand. It's ready.

422
00:41:54,552 --> 00:41:58,181
Ice tea, ice tea sold by
a handsome man.

423
00:41:58,272 --> 00:42:02,231
Flowers.

424
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,308
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

425
00:42:24,912 --> 00:42:26,311
Goy.

426
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:28,344
Hello, Pang!

427
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:29,547
How are you?

428
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:31,543
Same as usual.

429
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,908
We must have lunch sometime,
Gotta go. Bye.

430
00:42:34,992 --> 00:42:36,471
Bye.

431
00:42:40,032 --> 00:42:43,468
Boom, how are you?

432
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:46,271
Things are so heavy!

433
00:42:46,352 --> 00:42:49,424
Why?

434
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:51,510
Really, really heavy.

435
00:42:51,592 --> 00:42:53,503
What, about that gossip?

436
00:42:53,592 --> 00:42:58,222
No, these books are do damn heavy.

437
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:01,065
Talk to you later.

438
00:43:12,712 --> 00:43:14,543
One copy of Cosmopolitan, please,
Thiwa.

439
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:16,748
That's 80 Bath, please.
100 Baht given.

440
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:18,151
Don't worry about a bag.

441
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:20,788
Here's your change.

442
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:25,511
Next week is our annual sale.
Come and have a look.

443
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:27,822
I will if I'm free.

444
00:43:27,912 --> 00:43:32,224
I live just on this road, but rarely
come to buy any books, myself.

445
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:33,711
Good luck, take care.

446
00:43:44,952 --> 00:43:48,069
Sorry for surprising you, sis.

447
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:53,351
Who are you calling, sis?
What do you want?

448
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:55,582
Don't get angry. I just.

449
00:43:55,672 --> 00:43:57,663
What! Do you need passengers?

450
00:43:57,752 --> 00:44:01,108
I'm sorry
but my home is not far from here.

451
00:44:01,192 --> 00:44:07,540
Wait just a minute! You dropped this.
I was bringing it back to you.

452
00:44:08,952 --> 00:44:11,864
Sorry. I thought you were a pervert.
There are so many around,

453
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:15,911
...it's getting scary.
Thank you so much.

454
00:44:15,992 --> 00:44:19,268
Please, call me Chad.
I'm based at the end of the road.

455
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:20,501
Next time try to be more careful.

456
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:22,548
Your purse is very small,
it can fall out easily.

457
00:44:22,752 --> 00:44:25,027
I won't trouble you anymore.

458
00:44:26,192 --> 00:44:29,741
Anyway, thank you Chad.

459
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:46,104
Why do we have to come to
this traders in Thai ducks party.

460
00:44:46,192 --> 00:44:48,342
There's nothing special here.

461
00:44:48,432 --> 00:44:55,065
Soon you will know that this party
has something, for sure. Come on.

462
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:58,462
It's the same everywhere we go.
Just go inside.

463
00:44:58,552 --> 00:45:04,787
Easy, easy! The wounds from
today haven't healed yet.

464
00:45:11,952 --> 00:45:17,310
This is wrong, this isn't a meeting
of diamond traders.

465
00:45:17,392 --> 00:45:23,547
It's a party for people to sell ducks

466
00:45:23,632 --> 00:45:28,911
Ducks! That's why everyone
is asking about our poultry.

467
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:31,142
What did they say to you?

468
00:45:31,232 --> 00:45:36,590
They asked if our ducks had big eggs.

469
00:45:36,672 --> 00:45:46,263
I don't know what they're selling
here but our party is two roads down.

470
00:45:46,352 --> 00:45:48,741
Good. Come on let's go.

471
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:50,823
We'll miss the cutting of the ribbon.

472
00:45:52,272 --> 00:45:54,422
Hello, have you been here long?

473
00:45:54,512 --> 00:45:56,582
My god, why do you look so old?

474
00:45:57,992 --> 00:45:59,266
Carry on.

475
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:03,630
What's up, you great musician?
This is my girlfriend.

476
00:46:04,232 --> 00:46:05,824
See you later.

477
00:46:05,912 --> 00:46:07,709
Hello.

478
00:46:09,192 --> 00:46:12,662
All the old ones are here.
This is my girlfriend, Hello.

479
00:46:14,352 --> 00:46:18,425
I've heard that the minister Chaiwat's wife
had an abortion.

480
00:46:18,512 --> 00:46:21,470
Really, she's pregnant at the age of 40?

481
00:46:21,552 --> 00:46:25,306
The minister is still strong.

482
00:46:25,392 --> 00:46:30,102
Who told that's his kid? It's her secret
husband's kid instead.

483
00:46:30,192 --> 00:46:32,660
It's something wrong for sure!

484
00:46:32,752 --> 00:46:36,825
It's like this, there would be
no compassion for anyone.

485
00:46:36,912 --> 00:46:43,590
It's very ashamed

486
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:51,225
Hello, I haven't seen you for ages.
You're very beautiful now.

487
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:57,547
Thank you. You too. Those diamonds
around your neck are gorgeous.

488
00:46:57,632 --> 00:47:04,105
So beautiful that they hurt you're
eyes, nearly causing a cataract.

489
00:47:04,192 --> 00:47:09,220
It's only a few carats.
Not so expensive, about US$ 72,000.

490
00:47:09,312 --> 00:47:11,507
- Hello, Lady Jintanawadee.
- Hello Goy.

491
00:47:14,672 --> 00:47:20,941
I don't think admire like this kind of party.

492
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:25,706
What's party? I don't understand.

493
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:30,104
It's a swinging party.

494
00:47:30,192 --> 00:47:35,983
People come today because they like it.

495
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:39,862
I'm quite jealous of you.

496
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:42,341
You have a girlfriend with such
an open heart as Goy.

497
00:47:42,432 --> 00:47:46,425
Usually only people 30 years old
or more come here.

498
00:47:46,512 --> 00:47:53,145
But, Goy is probably the youngest
person in the party.

499
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:59,785
Look grey hairs and dark skin Goy.

500
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:05,067
Have you brought me
here for the men?

501
00:48:09,112 --> 00:48:11,182
Calm down, will you, Goy?

502
00:48:11,272 --> 00:48:17,984
They're into swapping. It's a cool
man's party once you've tried it...

503
00:48:18,072 --> 00:48:20,063
...you'll love it.

504
00:48:20,152 --> 00:48:21,949
Love it yourself, you pervert!

505
00:48:23,272 --> 00:48:26,423
Darling, come back!
Where are you going?

506
00:48:32,072 --> 00:48:38,261
Jack you asshole you have
a girlfriend. We're over!

507
00:48:38,352 --> 00:48:45,622
Are you insane,
taking me to give to your friends.

508
00:48:45,712 --> 00:48:49,387
Are you still human?

509
00:48:52,352 --> 00:48:54,502
Fucking hell,

510
00:48:58,472 --> 00:49:00,747
...what's wrong with my car now!

511
00:49:04,752 --> 00:49:08,267
What's wrong? Shit.
Why is today such a bad.

512
00:49:08,352 --> 00:49:12,709
God my telephone is looked
in the car too. What can I do?

513
00:49:21,232 --> 00:49:23,109
What's wrong with your car?

514
00:49:23,712 --> 00:49:25,942
It's you, again.

515
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:30,583
It's small world. I thought that for
today I was out of luck.

516
00:49:30,672 --> 00:49:33,470
Can you have a look at my car Chad?

517
00:49:33,552 --> 00:49:37,591
Thank you for remembering my name.
Let's have a look, Goy?

518
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:47,148
It looks bad. I expect we'll have to
take it to the garage.

519
00:49:47,232 --> 00:49:49,143
Try to start it first.

520
00:49:49,232 --> 00:49:53,942
How can I start it?
I left the keys and phone in the car.

521
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,182
I can't call anyone.

522
00:49:56,272 --> 00:50:00,026
If that's the case,
then we should get out of this rain.

523
00:50:00,112 --> 00:50:03,184
After the it's died down
I'll take you to garage.

524
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:10,225
Whatever, Chad. If I stay here any
longer I'll catch my death of cold.

525
00:50:10,312 --> 00:50:13,145
As long as you don't mind riding
the motorcycle of a poor chap like me.

526
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:17,543
Climb on.
If we stay here we'll drown.

527
00:50:19,192 --> 00:50:21,103
That's twice you've helped me today,
Chad.

528
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:23,228
I'll have to say thank you properly,
some time.

529
00:50:49,632 --> 00:50:52,510
Thank you so much for taking me
out of the rain.

530
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:54,344
But, I'm so very cold.

531
00:50:54,432 --> 00:50:55,547
It might be a bit too dark.

532
00:50:55,632 --> 00:51:00,547
But look at this oil lantern.
Here I'll light it.

533
00:51:08,352 --> 00:51:12,311
Why are you here,
alone with a broken car?

534
00:51:12,632 --> 00:51:18,229
Where's your boyfriend?
The man I see pick you up so often.

535
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:22,988
Don't even talk about him.
He's just a waste of time. Psycho!

536
00:51:27,192 --> 00:51:34,542
I'm sorry I shouldn't have asked.
You're shivering are you very cold?

537
00:51:34,632 --> 00:51:39,342
Cold can't you see my chin shivering?

538
00:51:39,432 --> 00:51:46,144
What can we do?
Unfortunately, my clothes are wet too.

539
00:51:47,072 --> 00:51:52,305
Is it ok if I ask to keep you warm
by holding you close to me.

540
00:51:53,872 --> 00:51:59,424
To embrace is a natural way to
exchange heat throughout the body.

541
00:52:00,032 --> 00:52:02,227
I studied it at school.

542
00:53:28,432 --> 00:53:30,502
That's so sweet.

543
00:53:30,592 --> 00:53:33,868
How can you imagine that,
that is worse than Joy or I?

544
00:53:33,952 --> 00:53:39,026
There's nothing wrong with having
sex with a motorbike taxi guy...

545
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:43,185
...and he sound quite handsome.

546
00:53:43,272 --> 00:53:47,584
Don't tell me that Jack
spotted the two of you.

547
00:53:47,672 --> 00:53:50,232
That's not it. Goy said,
shortly after that,

548
00:53:50,312 --> 00:53:55,830
...Jack was raped through his back
door at the party wasn't he.

549
00:53:55,912 --> 00:54:02,101
Yes, Jack got his retribution.
But for me it wasn't over.

550
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:08,030
It's still raining.
Do you want to play in it?

551
00:54:09,752 --> 00:54:12,346
Can I just rest a bit?

552
00:54:12,952 --> 00:54:17,707
Ok. But can you follow me,
then we can wash each other.

553
00:54:49,992 --> 00:55:02,985
What do you lot want?
Don't come here. Please! Don't!

554
00:55:03,072 --> 00:55:06,906
My god! The Whole lot.

555
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:15,104
The were like giants, and they took
me in every position,

556
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:17,103
...but there was still some luck.

557
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:21,663
What! You think that was lucky?

558
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:27,827
I think it was lucky
because everyone wore a condom.

559
00:55:27,912 --> 00:55:32,303
If they hadn't, now I would
have a baby but no father for it.

560
00:55:32,392 --> 00:55:35,429
I feel so sorry for you Goy.

561
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:41,189
But, yours still isn't the worst
one yet, trust me.

562
00:55:41,272 --> 00:55:46,300
Don't say that your story is
even more bizzar than ours, Maem.

563
00:55:46,392 --> 00:55:52,740
Go on then us, sitting there
so quiet. Did you find a man too?

564
00:55:52,832 --> 00:55:58,748
Don't say that you were raped by
a regiment of Red-Wah soldiers?

565
00:55:58,832 --> 00:56:04,031
This in not about quantity.

566
00:56:04,112 --> 00:56:07,787
It's the most sinful act
a person could do.

567
00:56:07,872 --> 00:56:17,668
It's too difficult to explain.
It happened only about a year ago.

568
00:56:26,672 --> 00:56:28,185
Good morning, boss.

569
00:56:28,272 --> 00:56:31,503
The "Thailand-Daily" Program wants
wants you at the studio...

570
00:56:31,592 --> 00:56:33,310
...no later than 2:00 P.M.

571
00:56:34,232 --> 00:56:36,063
It's almost 1 o'clock now.

572
00:56:36,152 --> 00:56:39,189
Let me clear up some things first,
then we can go.

573
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:41,342
Here's your bag.

574
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:42,751
Thanks.

575
00:56:44,712 --> 00:56:48,466
Mr. Chairote is waiting to show
the presentation you ordered...

576
00:56:48,552 --> 00:56:51,749
...and Ms. Arisa wants to make
suggestions for the advertising...

577
00:56:51,832 --> 00:56:57,987
...budget for Toto Company which
produces "Orgasm"-Condom.

578
00:56:58,072 --> 00:57:00,905
Ask them to meet me, now.

579
00:57:17,512 --> 00:57:20,948
Disgusting! Did you turn your brain
on before you started this job?

580
00:57:21,032 --> 00:57:22,306
Mr. Chairote,

581
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:25,589
...you're not even the tiniest
bit suitable to work for CPDI.

582
00:57:25,672 --> 00:57:29,460
But I did everything just as
you had told me to do.

583
00:57:29,552 --> 00:57:33,067
Don't argue. I would never have
ordered such inferior work.

584
00:57:33,152 --> 00:57:34,665
How can you say such a thing?

585
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:38,586
Do it over again. With a more
suitable ending.

586
00:57:38,672 --> 00:57:40,742
Finish it today
and place it on my table.

587
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:45,064
Today?
How am I supposed to do it in time?

588
00:57:45,152 --> 00:57:48,747
This presentation alone took me
two weeks to complete.

589
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:52,222
If you can't do it,
you can resign.

590
00:57:52,312 --> 00:57:54,701
Once I've returned from recording
the Thai-Politics-Dail-Program,

591
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:57,670
I want to see your work on my desk.
Do you understand?

592
00:57:57,752 --> 00:58:01,222
I understand.
I'll do my best, Ma'am.

593
00:58:04,792 --> 00:58:07,590
Bitch! She gives orders while only
caring about herself, insane Tom-boy.

594
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:10,750
I guess you must have
got in real trouble.

595
00:58:10,832 --> 00:58:13,300
If she's unhappy today,

596
00:58:13,392 --> 00:58:17,146
...she's probably got a lot of
pressure from to the T. V show.

597
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:20,190
Somsri, Arisa can come in now.

598
00:58:20,272 --> 00:58:23,309
Please, Arisa, you may go in now.

599
00:58:23,392 --> 00:58:25,587
I'm in big shit!

600
00:58:25,952 --> 00:58:28,910
I have read your plan,
and you've done an excellent job.

601
00:58:28,992 --> 00:58:31,552
The customers money is
being used well.

602
00:58:31,632 --> 00:58:36,262
Thank you, boss. Is there anything
you would like me to improve or add?

603
00:58:36,352 --> 00:58:39,549
I would like you to try to add
something to our campaign...

604
00:58:39,632 --> 00:58:42,590
...activities so we can introduce
condoms during an...

605
00:58:42,672 --> 00:58:46,460
...activity with Patpong District or
a campaign by the Ministry...

606
00:58:46,552 --> 00:58:49,020
...of Public Health.

607
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:54,266
Yes, boss. I'll complete a summary
ready for your approval immediately.

608
00:58:54,352 --> 00:59:01,702
Regarding our share,
only 10-20% should go to us.

609
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:05,990
This is a social issue with little
impact on business.

610
00:59:06,072 --> 00:59:11,669
Just work on improving their
reputation a bit, that will do!

611
00:59:11,752 --> 00:59:14,505
Fine. I'll get the ball rolling
right away.

612
00:59:22,472 --> 00:59:26,226
Somsri has asked Boonsong to get
the car ready in 5 minutes.

613
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,791
I'm going downstairs.

614
00:59:30,952 --> 00:59:35,343
Who now? Come in.
Somsri, What is it?

615
00:59:35,432 --> 00:59:38,708
The program would like appearing
guests to wear a dress during the show.

616
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:44,263
Ms. Maem, would you like to
change here or at the studio?

617
00:59:44,352 --> 00:59:49,221
Ok, I'll get changed, then we can go.
Can you tell Boonsong to get ready.

618
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:53,703
Somsri, can you take care of
the office whilst I'm gone?

619
00:59:53,792 --> 00:59:57,307
Would you like anyone to accompany
you to the studio?

620
00:59:57,392 --> 00:59:59,667
No, it's not necessary,
I'm all grown up now.

621
00:59:59,752 --> 01:00:02,744
If I go by myself,
then we won't waste any work time.

622
01:00:08,152 --> 01:00:18,266
What are you doing down there?
This is a company not a playground!

623
01:00:18,352 --> 01:00:22,743
I'm sorry, Ma'am. I dropped a 10 Baht
coin down there and...

624
01:00:22,832 --> 01:00:24,823
...I was just trying to get it back.

625
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:28,825
Are you the new guard?
Stand up, so I can talk to you!

626
01:00:28,912 --> 01:00:31,631
Yes, Ma'am. My name's
Kampoon Nongkratok and

627
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:34,988
...I am the new security
Guard, Ma'am.

628
01:00:35,072 --> 01:00:38,144
You look strong and high-spirited,
is that only during the day?

629
01:00:38,232 --> 01:00:40,223
Do you take a nap at night?

630
01:00:40,312 --> 01:00:42,143
I've never slept on duty, ma'am.

631
01:00:42,232 --> 01:00:44,348
And I have an, "Employee
of the Month" certificate,

632
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,992
...form my last employer to
prove it, ma'am.

633
01:00:47,072 --> 01:00:48,824
That won't be necessary.

634
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:54,111
When I come back to the office
we can continue this conversation.

635
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,944
Do you work all the night?

636
01:00:56,032 --> 01:00:58,944
I work from midday
to midnight, ma'am.

637
01:01:06,832 --> 01:01:10,905
She's so vicious but her figure
is so mouth-watering.

638
01:01:14,632 --> 01:01:18,545
Don't sneak up on me like that.
You almost gave me a heart attack.

639
01:01:18,632 --> 01:01:22,227
Don't be so smutty or
you won't e here long.

640
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:24,701
She's the head of this company.

641
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:30,583
Sorry, I'm not well informed,
I've just started here.

642
01:01:30,672 --> 01:01:35,746
Remember! If you really want to
stay here, keep to yourself.

643
01:01:35,832 --> 01:01:38,710
Don't jump, don't leap,
don't boil, don't heat up.

644
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:40,544
Do things just steadily.

645
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:42,941
Thank you so much.

646
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:49,301
Sometimes one needs someone to
soothe, understand and talk with.

647
01:01:49,392 --> 01:01:50,825
Good you understand.

648
01:01:50,912 --> 01:01:53,745
Now I'll show you the company's
C.C.T.V. System.

649
01:01:53,832 --> 01:01:55,629
It covers some important areas.

650
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:06,629
What's wrong now, Boonsong?
Is the car broken?

651
01:02:06,712 --> 01:02:12,309
Sorry, boss.
The car might have the hic-ups.

652
01:02:12,392 --> 01:02:15,350
What? That's the first time
I've heard that.

653
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:17,741
Hurry, or they'll be waiting for us.

654
01:02:17,832 --> 01:02:21,871
Don't worry, boss.
We'll be there in under ten minutes.

655
01:02:32,312 --> 01:02:34,826
Good evening, Anchaleeporn, Boonyod.

656
01:02:34,992 --> 01:02:37,631
It's an honour to
have you as our guest tonight.

657
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:41,864
Sorry, for bothering you during your
afternoon working time like this.

658
01:02:41,952 --> 01:02:46,821
Usually our show is live,
but today we have to tape it.

659
01:02:46,912 --> 01:02:48,868
Yes. Unfortunately next week
the two of us have to go abroad...

660
01:02:48,952 --> 01:02:50,783
...on an urgent matter.

661
01:02:50,872 --> 01:02:55,582
No problem. I'm happy to have
the honour to be on your show.

662
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:59,745
I nearly forgot. This is the famous
columnist Doy Adner.

663
01:02:59,832 --> 01:03:02,392
He will be the guest appearing
before you.

664
01:03:02,472 --> 01:03:04,224
Mr. Adner, this is Maem Premika.

665
01:03:04,312 --> 01:03:05,506
Good Evening, Doy.

666
01:03:05,592 --> 01:03:09,710
We're met before at your book
anniversary party a few months ago.

667
01:03:09,792 --> 01:03:11,623
Do you remember me?

668
01:03:11,712 --> 01:03:17,981
Of course. You are beautiful
by both day and night.

669
01:03:18,072 --> 01:03:22,145
Your last advertisement
was fantastic.

670
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:26,464
Thank you very much, I have to
praise the whole team for it.

671
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,191
Besides, the media, like you Mr. Doy,
gave us great support.

672
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,785
That's why it because so well-known.

673
01:03:30,872 --> 01:03:34,308
I think you both should go and
get your hair and make up done.

674
01:03:34,392 --> 01:03:37,031
It'll be Doy's turn first.

675
01:03:37,112 --> 01:03:38,864
And you, Maem,
could just wait for one minute?

676
01:03:38,952 --> 01:03:42,945
Sure! I've got no urgent
matters to attend today.

677
01:03:43,032 --> 01:03:47,503
We'll have someone brief you on
the script while your waiting.

678
01:03:47,592 --> 01:03:51,028
We're ready for your spot now Doy.

679
01:03:51,112 --> 01:03:52,784
Maem.
Will you wear that dress on set?

680
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:56,148
Yes, is it ok?
I don't have many dresses.

681
01:03:56,232 --> 01:04:00,987
It's very beautiful,
sexy around the chest too.

682
01:05:08,352 --> 01:05:11,662
Ladies and Gentlemen, over the past
2-3 weeks there has been a new,

683
01:05:11,752 --> 01:05:14,824
...much talked about commercial
on the TV.

684
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:17,710
It's about what you just saw.

685
01:05:17,792 --> 01:05:22,183
Today we can talk with the person
who dreamt up this commercial.

686
01:05:22,272 --> 01:05:26,823
She's very famous and has
individually created this commercial.

687
01:05:26,912 --> 01:05:29,142
Who can it be?
It can be nobody else but.

688
01:05:29,232 --> 01:05:32,542
Please put your hands together
for Miss Premika.

689
01:05:40,512 --> 01:05:41,991
Hello and welcome.

690
01:05:43,552 --> 01:05:45,463
Is this,
who everyone rekons is a lesbian.

691
01:05:45,552 --> 01:05:47,144
How can she be a lesbian
she's too sexy.

692
01:05:47,232 --> 01:05:49,746
Look, you can see right up her skirt.

693
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:55,623
Where did you come up with
a concept such as this?

694
01:05:55,712 --> 01:05:59,864
First I must explain. What we are
currently showing is forbidden...

695
01:05:59,952 --> 01:06:01,704
...in this country.

696
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:05,705
I think it works when you can deceive
everyone that at first the plot is...

697
01:06:05,792 --> 01:06:08,511
...one thing but in the end
it's different.

698
01:06:08,592 --> 01:06:12,301
It wasn't just me who made this we all
brain-stormed hard together.

699
01:06:12,392 --> 01:06:15,589
I hold this production in
high esteem.

700
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:17,981
It has something that no
other movie has.

701
01:06:18,072 --> 01:06:24,591
What about the news that
sorry about to ask about this,

702
01:06:24,672 --> 01:06:28,221
but we must ask
that you are in fact a lesbian?

703
01:06:28,312 --> 01:06:32,464
Why, just because a girl works,
has short hair and wears pants,

704
01:06:32,552 --> 01:06:35,350
...does that make her a lesbian?

705
01:06:35,432 --> 01:06:37,900
I had no intention to come
across like that.

706
01:06:37,992 --> 01:06:39,903
It's information from
another source.

707
01:06:39,992 --> 01:06:43,621
It's not news it's just a rumour
don't read too much into it.

708
01:06:44,552 --> 01:06:49,626
I think it's better if we continue
talking about work.

709
01:06:49,712 --> 01:06:54,581
Sorry for bothering you but
could I ask a personal question?

710
01:06:54,672 --> 01:06:59,905
Do you have a boyfriend?
This is a question from our audience.

711
01:07:01,312 --> 01:07:06,511
I'm not answering those kind
of questions. It's private.

712
01:07:06,592 --> 01:07:10,426
Please could we change
the subject?

713
01:07:10,512 --> 01:07:12,980
If you don't want to talk about it,
that's ok.

714
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:15,381
Let's go back to the subject of work.

715
01:07:15,472 --> 01:07:20,341
In the future do you feel you might
want to make a Thai movie.

716
01:07:20,432 --> 01:07:25,301
I'm not sure. At present I think it
will be better to stay in advertising

717
01:07:25,392 --> 01:07:29,670
I don't know what
I would like to do best.

718
01:07:32,912 --> 01:07:35,665
Checking the porn during work
time are you?

719
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:38,869
No, just looking.

720
01:07:38,952 --> 01:07:45,187
Give it here! I'm gonna tell
the boss and get your ass fired.

721
01:07:45,272 --> 01:07:47,149
Don't do it again!

722
01:07:50,072 --> 01:07:53,701
No problem it's in my memory now.

723
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:09,868
Good. They won't be
finished for aged.

724
01:08:17,512 --> 01:08:23,223
Move your hand faster.

725
01:08:24,552 --> 01:08:26,827
Maem. Oh, Maem.

726
01:08:27,832 --> 01:08:30,869
I can't take it any longer.

727
01:08:32,992 --> 01:08:34,505
What are you doing?
Boonsong!

728
01:08:34,592 --> 01:08:37,902
Shit! When did you finish.

729
01:08:38,832 --> 01:08:41,471
What are you doing?
Let's go, you're wasting time.

730
01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:43,941
Nothing boss. I was just.

731
01:08:44,032 --> 01:08:46,500
Nothing? You're insane!

732
01:08:46,592 --> 01:08:49,550
When did you start the car
it wastes so much gas.

733
01:08:49,632 --> 01:08:51,668
Go back to the office.

734
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:05,108
What's this?

735
01:09:10,272 --> 01:09:14,982
How can a book like this get
in my car Boonsong?

736
01:09:15,072 --> 01:09:22,831
It's. I'm sorry, boss. Just a minute
ago I found it in the toilet.

737
01:09:22,912 --> 01:09:30,466
I don't know who left it here.
And when I left it was in my hand.

738
01:09:30,552 --> 01:09:34,943
Boonsong, you're despicable.
Don't let me find out it's yours.

739
01:09:35,032 --> 01:09:37,182
You old enough to know better.

740
01:09:37,272 --> 01:09:40,070
Don't embarrass yourself
by being fired...

741
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:42,222
...for reading porn
during work hours.

742
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:45,463
Go and watch the road.

743
01:10:06,312 --> 01:10:12,547
This must be Chairote's work
I should pressure him more often.

744
01:10:12,632 --> 01:10:15,624
I'll look at it tomorrow.

745
01:11:42,872 --> 01:11:45,181
- Why are you so vile?
- Fuck, Who is that Boon?

746
01:11:45,272 --> 01:11:47,422
This is an office not a sleazy hotel!

747
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:49,901
God, when did you get back?

748
01:11:49,992 --> 01:11:53,029
Look enough to see this.

749
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:56,707
You! Get out of my office...

750
01:11:56,792 --> 01:11:58,942
...now I didn't order
any chicken to be delivered.

751
01:11:59,032 --> 01:12:04,152
Just a minute, hear me out first.
I deliver pizza not chicken.

752
01:12:04,232 --> 01:12:06,063
Now you want to get cocky.

753
01:12:06,152 --> 01:12:11,180
You should leave before
I call your boss.

754
01:12:11,272 --> 01:12:14,344
Boon, Come to my room now!

755
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:22,463
I have to go to her office,
but don't worry it's nothing.

756
01:12:22,552 --> 01:12:26,067
After this and you reckon
it's nothing. I'm so embarrassed.

757
01:12:26,152 --> 01:12:30,782
Tan. Whatever will be will be,
see you later.

758
01:12:31,312 --> 01:12:36,181
I don't know how to scold
you to fit your behaviour.

759
01:12:36,272 --> 01:12:39,548
Why did you do that?

760
01:12:39,632 --> 01:12:44,023
Boon, Why did you behave like
an animal in my office?

761
01:12:44,112 --> 01:12:46,501
I didn't intend to, Ma'am.
My girlfriend came and.

762
01:12:46,592 --> 01:12:55,500
You didn't intend to.
Of course you think it's normal.

763
01:12:55,592 --> 01:12:59,187
Your brain only produces
low-life thoughts.

764
01:12:59,272 --> 01:13:02,230
It's no surprise you became a guard.

765
01:13:05,072 --> 01:13:11,989
I want to know who taught you...

766
01:13:12,072 --> 01:13:18,625
...or did you just follow in
the family footsteps.

767
01:13:18,712 --> 01:13:21,272
Why are you looking at me like that.

768
01:13:21,352 --> 01:13:23,024
Don't you realize your mistake.

769
01:13:23,112 --> 01:13:28,140
I realize it. I'm a person.
You have no right to blame my family.

770
01:13:28,232 --> 01:13:31,269
They're not involved I'm the asshole.

771
01:13:31,352 --> 01:13:38,542
Why can't I criticize you? Who do you
think you are? You're Fired.

772
01:13:38,632 --> 01:13:44,628
I'm Fired? Great, but before I go
I have something to give you.

773
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:50,264
You son of a bitch. Fuck off.
What can a bastard like you give me?

774
01:13:50,352 --> 01:13:52,149
I'm gonna get right in you
I'll be your husband tonight?

775
01:13:52,752 --> 01:13:58,304
What are you doing? Your insane!
Let me go! You Bastard!

776
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:03,068
Polite! Your gonna get in double
for that. I'm gonna split your legs.

777
01:14:03,752 --> 01:14:09,782
Stop you crazy fucker. Let me go.

778
01:14:23,752 --> 01:14:25,902
Are you enjoying it boss?

779
01:14:25,992 --> 01:14:30,907
Do whatever you want,
I'm ready for it!

780
01:15:16,872 --> 01:15:20,990
I can't see how that's worse.
You had it with one guard.

781
01:15:21,832 --> 01:15:24,392
Honestly, Joy?
Did anyone notice?

782
01:15:24,472 --> 01:15:26,622
Or did someone record it on video?

783
01:15:26,712 --> 01:15:35,188
Yes, every gesture,
every action was recorded.

784
01:15:35,272 --> 01:15:37,183
What did you say?

785
01:15:37,272 --> 01:15:47,068
That night everywhere we went was
recorded on the security cameras.

786
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:57,660
How is it? Is it good?

787
01:15:57,752 --> 01:16:00,983
Great. I think if we can sell this.

788
01:16:01,072 --> 01:16:04,030
It's much better than taping
an M.P. from Taiwan.

789
01:16:04,112 --> 01:16:08,185
Whatever, but don't forget to
make me a copy.

790
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:12,231
No problem. How can I keep something
like this to look at all by myself?

791
01:16:15,472 --> 01:16:21,104
With words like that you should
be a singer. Thanks.

792
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:24,830
Was it really as bad as that, Maem?

793
01:16:24,912 --> 01:16:30,862
I believe you now,
yours was the worst.

794
01:16:30,952 --> 01:16:40,224
I think I watched the video and
though the person looked familiar.

795
01:16:40,312 --> 01:16:42,780
What did you do?

796
01:16:42,872 --> 01:16:54,864
There's more. Poon has Aids which
means I contacted HIV from him.

797
01:16:54,952 --> 01:17:00,584
The worst thing a person can do is to
not take precautions when having sex.

798
01:17:06,952 --> 01:17:09,182
You were lucky.

799
01:17:09,272 --> 01:17:16,952
It doesn't matter if you were
wrong you, you always had safe sex.

800
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:25,461
That's better! What a relief!

801
01:17:25,552 --> 01:17:27,782
The electricity's back.

802
01:17:27,952 --> 01:17:31,467
That pot is starting to wear off now.
Do you want another before bed.

803
01:17:31,552 --> 01:17:36,103
It's better if we sleep, we won't
wake up late tomorrow.

804
01:17:36,192 --> 01:17:38,945
I'm taking you on a trip.

805
01:17:40,992 --> 01:17:47,704
Don't change the topic. Everyone else
has talked about themselves.

806
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:51,228
Come on tell us, or we'll kick you.

807
01:17:51,312 --> 01:17:57,228
Ok what do want to know.
My experience isn't that interesting.

808
01:17:57,312 --> 01:18:02,989
Don't be like that, just tell us.
Whatever happened you must tell us.

809
01:18:03,072 --> 01:18:04,744
Yes, don't take advantage of us.

810
01:18:04,832 --> 01:18:08,108
You already know about
our experiences.

811
01:18:08,192 --> 01:18:11,901
You really want to know?

812
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:16,986
Stop beating around the bush!
It's late!

813
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:24,660
Ok then, don't complain,
it's not that interesting.

814
01:18:24,752 --> 01:18:27,505
It happened only a few days ago.

815
01:19:11,832 --> 01:19:13,185
What would you like, Miss?

816
01:19:13,272 --> 01:19:16,230
Jack Daniel's on the rocks, please.

817
01:19:16,312 --> 01:19:21,591
My next song is for all the girls
who are alone tonight. Maybe after...

818
01:19:21,672 --> 01:19:27,065
...this song you might find someone
you want to take home.

819
01:19:29,672 --> 01:19:33,984
How is it.
Have you found anyone yet?

820
01:19:34,072 --> 01:19:41,262
Nope.
Usually the women find me first.

821
01:19:41,352 --> 01:19:42,387
Like the last time.

822
01:19:42,472 --> 01:19:46,021
When that girl that found
you and stole your car.

823
01:19:47,272 --> 01:19:51,470
It's better than you. I heard that
someone got your condo.

824
01:19:57,072 --> 01:20:05,229
When you go out like us,
you expect to loose some things.

825
01:20:05,992 --> 01:20:07,107
Like they say...

826
01:20:07,192 --> 01:20:14,951
..."our labour makes us rich but
a pretty woman can make us poor"

827
01:21:04,912 --> 01:21:10,191
Pong, Hi there. Did you come to
get a ghost or a woman.

828
01:21:10,272 --> 01:21:20,785
I'm always working. Did you hear
about the ghost that lives here.

829
01:21:20,872 --> 01:21:22,828
Are you crazy? What ghost.

830
01:21:22,912 --> 01:21:28,782
I come here nearly everyday
and I've never heard of it.

831
01:21:28,872 --> 01:21:36,381
Really! They said that many
young men have already disappeared.

832
01:21:36,472 --> 01:21:38,622
Disappeared?

833
01:21:38,712 --> 01:21:43,422
If they disappeared that means
they with a woman you fool.

834
01:21:43,512 --> 01:21:47,346
Anyway I've gotta meet my friend.
See you later.

835
01:21:49,552 --> 01:21:52,749
- Be careful, Pay!
- Pong what is it with you?

836
01:21:52,832 --> 01:21:54,709
I'm just warning you.

837
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:24,344
Thank you very much.
That's all for tonight. Good night.

838
01:22:24,432 --> 01:22:27,265
Next some music from our DJ,
Thank you.

839
01:22:32,112 --> 01:22:33,625
Pay, Hi there!

840
01:22:33,712 --> 01:22:37,148
Goh. Is that your wife?

841
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:39,871
Yep.

842
01:22:39,952 --> 01:22:47,267
Goh, I must warn you as a friend.
Singers like us...

843
01:22:47,352 --> 01:22:54,190
...should not take our.
Just look at yourself.

844
01:22:54,952 --> 01:22:58,581
- I understand, thanks.
- Ok go take care of your wife.

845
01:23:05,912 --> 01:23:07,903
After work let's go home together.

846
01:23:07,992 --> 01:23:11,507
I know why you watch me like this.

847
01:23:11,592 --> 01:23:15,744
If I didn't you'd disappear
all night again.

848
01:23:15,832 --> 01:23:19,825
You piss me off,
I said I was working!

849
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,550
That's what you always say!

850
01:23:21,632 --> 01:23:26,148
We'll see if after work you go
somewhere else or not.

851
01:23:30,032 --> 01:23:33,422
Shit, if you drink like that
you'll throw up everywhere.

852
01:23:33,872 --> 01:23:38,309
I'm just gonna take a piss.
Don't go anywhere.

853
01:23:46,912 --> 01:23:49,984
Excuse me, The beauty at the
counter asked me to give you this.

854
01:23:54,192 --> 01:23:57,025
2nd male toilet, on the left.

855
01:24:00,912 --> 01:24:04,985
When my wife comes back, tell her
I went upstairs to see my boss.

856
01:24:05,072 --> 01:24:08,348
Don't worry, I'll tell her.

857
01:24:08,432 --> 01:24:12,391
You've gotta take
risks to find pleasure.

858
01:25:05,072 --> 01:25:06,710
Shall we leave together.

859
01:25:22,272 --> 01:25:24,103
Where are we gonna go?

860
01:25:24,192 --> 01:25:31,542
Are you scared.
I promise I won't sell you.

861
01:25:31,992 --> 01:25:34,062
I know your name is Jum.

862
01:25:34,152 --> 01:25:39,863
I'll ask again shall
we go to your house or a hotel?

863
01:25:46,792 --> 01:25:51,866
You're a busy girl, you slut!
Where's my friend?

864
01:25:53,832 --> 01:25:58,348
I said where's my friend?
Not telling?

865
01:26:01,432 --> 01:26:02,387
Take it easy. Let's talk about it.

866
01:26:02,472 --> 01:26:07,068
Fuck of! Where's my friend?
Tell me where he is?

867
01:26:07,752 --> 01:26:09,265
Calm down. What is it?
We can talk it through?

868
01:26:09,352 --> 01:26:13,391
Fuck you! Stay out of this!
It's between me and her.

869
01:26:15,432 --> 01:26:16,785
Don't be so tough on her.

870
01:26:16,872 --> 01:26:20,990
If you want to be involved!
It's ok with me.

871
01:26:24,872 --> 01:26:27,705
Sorry, Calm down it's ok. You'd
better talk nicely to each other.

872
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:32,229
You see, she's a girl.
You can just talk.

873
01:26:48,352 --> 01:26:50,149
Do you know this guy?

874
01:26:50,432 --> 01:26:55,984
Nope! Probably been an escape
from an asylum somewhere.

875
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:59,472
Do you want me to take him to
the police?

876
01:26:59,552 --> 01:27:04,103
No, it's ok. Just tie him up.

877
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:11,348
Now lets continue with us.
We can come back to him later.

878
01:28:29,592 --> 01:28:34,541
Is that it?

879
01:28:34,632 --> 01:28:36,782
Where's the sin in that?

880
01:28:36,872 --> 01:28:41,263
Or, is it there something else
you've left unsaid.

881
01:28:41,352 --> 01:28:47,746
It's a sin because come morning
all men that have sex will be...

882
01:28:47,832 --> 01:28:50,505
...turned into pigs.

883
01:28:58,072 --> 01:29:01,985
That's hilarious.
You can make a good story.

884
01:29:02,072 --> 01:29:06,190
No one's better at black humour
than you.

885
01:29:06,552 --> 01:29:09,191
Jum if you don't have
anything to tell,

886
01:29:09,272 --> 01:29:12,230
...you don't have to exaggerate
like that. Don't to lie to us.

887
01:29:12,312 --> 01:29:18,865
Please, don't say that the pork we
just ate is really from one of them.

888
01:29:18,952 --> 01:29:23,548
It's exactly that.
How did it taste?

889
01:29:25,032 --> 01:29:28,786
Stop playing about Jum.

890
01:29:28,872 --> 01:29:32,785
It's so late,
maybe we should go to bed.

891
01:29:32,872 --> 01:29:38,788
Your story was hilarious. I've gotta
remember to tell this to everyone.

892
01:29:38,872 --> 01:29:42,547
Be careful they might laugh
in your face.

893
01:29:42,632 --> 01:29:45,704
Who can believe a story about
witches and ghosts.

894
01:29:49,912 --> 01:29:52,984
My god what is it!

895
01:30:00,712 --> 01:30:06,469
Jum what's happened?
How did you do that?

896
01:30:06,552 --> 01:30:08,463
What's up with you?

897
01:30:08,552 --> 01:30:12,227
Don't say that you really
are a witch!

898
01:30:12,312 --> 01:30:17,067
God help me! My friend is a witch.
Please help me!

899
01:30:18,712 --> 01:30:23,422
I'm not afraid of death I've
already got Aids. Do what you will.

900
01:30:23,512 --> 01:30:26,788
It's not time to die.

901
01:30:26,872 --> 01:30:31,866
You've still got time to listen to
more of my story.

902
01:30:33,192 --> 01:30:38,027
Maybe you'll recognise
Some of it.

903
01:30:40,152 --> 01:30:50,630
You have always looked at me
as a misfit. You always spited me.

904
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:54,182
I was the butt of all your jokes.

905
01:30:54,272 --> 01:31:00,666
But I could bear it, I believed
that you were my friends.

906
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:07,749
Even if nobody saw that I was
a person just like you.

907
01:31:09,072 --> 01:31:11,950
Until the most embarrassing time...

908
01:31:12,032 --> 01:31:15,342
I had to endure in my life.

909
01:31:16,432 --> 01:31:22,667
It started like a lovely dream which
nobody could refuse...

910
01:31:24,952 --> 01:31:32,222
...in the end I lost my virginity
without even knowing what happened.

911
01:31:32,312 --> 01:31:34,143
Pay up!

912
01:31:34,232 --> 01:31:41,786
Cool. You had Jum in just 2 days.
I shouldn't have taken the bet.

913
01:31:43,192 --> 01:31:47,026
He's as good as that chap Sura,

914
01:31:47,112 --> 01:31:50,548
...and you mess around with
my younger brother. How dare you?

915
01:31:50,632 --> 01:31:56,628
Good, It was so boring,
it was like sleeping with a tree.

916
01:31:56,712 --> 01:32:02,025
Have you heard the proverb
"Love grows from a seed to a tree"?

917
01:32:04,632 --> 01:32:06,987
Come on, pay up.

918
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:16,430
Refreshing. Gimme yours.

919
01:32:21,992 --> 01:32:26,383
But what I could not stand was
that I was made ignorant and...

920
01:32:26,472 --> 01:32:29,748
...stupid, like a pig or a dog.

921
01:32:29,832 --> 01:32:32,744
People did whatever they liked to me.

922
01:32:34,872 --> 01:32:41,425
I has no real friends,
I was just your slave.

923
01:32:41,512 --> 01:32:47,428
That's when I decided, I wanted get
my revenge on everyone.

924
01:32:47,512 --> 01:32:56,591
That's the reason why
I suddenly left you all.

925
01:32:57,112 --> 01:33:05,030
I went to America. But I didn't go to
study at University, like you thought

926
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:08,309
I went to study witchcraft.

927
01:33:08,392 --> 01:33:12,783
Where did you study.

928
01:33:12,872 --> 01:33:17,070
The same place as that famous Harry.

929
01:33:17,512 --> 01:33:20,948
OK. Do you know a lot of magic?

930
01:33:21,032 --> 01:33:26,060
No, I studied two majors,

931
01:33:26,152 --> 01:33:29,827
...the first one you already
know about.

932
01:33:29,912 --> 01:33:38,502
That every man who sleeps
with me will become a pig by morning.

933
01:33:41,912 --> 01:33:46,064
And the other was curses
to make us horny, right?

934
01:33:46,152 --> 01:33:51,749
Everything that happened to
you was not a curse.

935
01:33:51,832 --> 01:33:58,783
It came from a mixture
that I put in your drinks.

936
01:34:04,112 --> 01:34:10,267
This stimulated your hormones
and threw into a frenzy.

937
01:34:10,352 --> 01:34:15,790
Did you put spell on us to tell you
about our experiences.

938
01:34:15,872 --> 01:34:22,903
No, you told them
because you were high on ganja.

939
01:34:22,992 --> 01:34:29,067
My second major in witchcraft
was how I made our friends disappear.

940
01:34:29,152 --> 01:34:34,351
Just like you were wondering earlier.

941
01:34:34,432 --> 01:34:41,543
Because if anyone finds out that
I am witch...

942
01:34:41,632 --> 01:34:46,945
...they will be turned into this.

943
01:34:56,832 --> 01:35:03,101
And you were the last four
of our group.

944
01:38:37,352 --> 01:38:39,104
Remember well,

945
01:38:39,192 --> 01:38:44,312
if anyone finds out about my
experience and starts telling...

946
01:38:44,392 --> 01:38:46,064
...other people,

947
01:38:46,152 --> 01:38:52,500
...you know what will happen.
