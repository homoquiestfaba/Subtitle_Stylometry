00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,666
What's up, J. D?

171
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,773
Que pasa, J. D?

172
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,293
I lost my board, man.

173
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:40,744
Maybe someone took it.

174
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,215
Took it?
No one takes surfboards
around here, amigo.

175
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,652
[Female Reporter]
In a move that could seriously
hurt his reelection prospects-

176
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,488
[J.D.]
Hey, Harry.
Hey, J.D.

177
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:50,254
Where's your board?
Gone.

178
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,959
I don't know.
Maybe someone stole it.
Stole your board?

179
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,161
Uh-huh.
Motherfucker.

180
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,395
Beer?

181
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:03,102
I don't spend every day
workin' my ass off at the D.M.V.
so you can buy beer, old man.

182
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:06,305
- I didn't buy it.
J.D. gave me one.
- What?

183
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,359
- J.D., did you give him beer?
- No.

184
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:12,378
- Where's your board?
- [Groans]

185
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:13,606
[Farts]

186
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,775
[Farts]

187
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,555
- Rise and shine, ladies!
- [Gasps]

188
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,524
- Come on. Get up.
- Why are you doing this to me?

189
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,896
Come on. Get up.
You know, in some countries,
this is considered torture.

190
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,431
[Exhales]
Listen up.
J.D. lost his board.

191
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,269
So?
Well, so, you guys
should go help him find it.

192
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,870
- He lost the Mooney?
- Yeah, the Mooney.

193
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,808
[Laughs]
That shit didn't happen.
It happened.

194
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:45,711
Seriously, you guys
should go help him find it.

195
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:48,447
He should help me
find the bong.

196
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:52,149
- Oh, God.
- Where is it?

197
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,551
[J.D.] Dude, why?
[Lardo]
I don't know.

198
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,423
I mean,
how does something
like this happen?

199
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,360
Dude, I have no idea.

200
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:03,227
Mooney's gonna kill me.

201
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:08,701
It's just kind of incredible
that your board would
just be gone.

202
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,601
I know.

203
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:18,477
Hey, what's goin' on, guys?
Sparks.

204
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,678
Punk.
Hey, bro.

205
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,515
Where's your board, man?
Dude, my board
got pilfered.

206
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,282
Dude, don't flip out,
all right?

207
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:30,621
I can't fucking believe
this shit. I'm gonna fucking
kill all of 'em!

208
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,226
I mean, they just come and they
just take our fucking boards
like it's nothing?

209
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:40,232
These are our boards,
our property! Fuck them!
Fuck off-

210
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,100
All right, I'm here.
Where's the fire?
Thank you.

211
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,838
Okay, um, can you fold these,
please, and then put them
outside when you're done?

212
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:49,308
Only because I need you
in my life.
Love you.

213
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,175
So, how's things?
Oh, you know.

214
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,180
Same old together one day,
broken up the next,
back together again.

215
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,851
On again, off again.
Sex one day,
no sex the next.

216
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:01,218
It's nice to know
we have the same problems.

217
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:05,457
...theirfucking beating heart
outta their chest
and show it to 'em.

218
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:09,395
Yeah, l- Uh, Anne?
[Bat Pounding Pole]

219
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,762
I'm not fucking around!

220
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,899
Yeah?
That boy's not good
for business.

221
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,971
They just fucked with Sparky,
and Sparky's gonna fuck 'em up.

222
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:23,073
That's just Sparky.
He breaks it, he buys it.

223
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,703
All day!
Pretend this little fuckin'
totem pole's their fucking face!

224
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,780
[Panting]

225
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:35,445
Whoa.

226
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,855
[Anne]
Hey, J.D.
Hey.

227
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,159
- Um, where's your board?
- It's gone.

228
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,459
Hey, J.D.
Hey, Iris.

229
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,647
- How's your mom?
- She's in Vegas
with her new boyfriend.

230
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:48,459
- Did you look up
and down the beach?
- Of course! Aw, please.

231
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:51,236
- Come on.
- Well, wait. Maybe the
tide took it out, dude.

232
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,203
- How many times a year
do I go out?
- A lot.

233
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,572
- And how many times
have I lost my board?
- A lot.

234
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,944
And how many times
have I swum in to get it?
As many times as you lost it.

235
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:03,348
Right. And how many times
was it right there
waiting for me?

236
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,382
Yeah.

237
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,384
Every time.
Exactly, dude.

238
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,121
Every time,
except this fucking time.

239
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:15,727
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Did anyone hear about Reagan
bombing Russia?

240
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:20,264
What?
Reagan's bombing Russia. I heard
it on the radio this morning.

241
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:25,604
Shh. You're that stoned
that Reagan is talking to you
personally through a radio?

242
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,140
No, no.
I'm not that stoned.

243
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:30,941
I'm... that stoned.

244
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:35,180
[Both Laughing]
Dude, me too.
Let's get more stoned.

245
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,850
What am I gonna do, man?

246
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:40,150
Fuck.

247
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,422
This is a symbol
for all that's sacred
to our way of life.

248
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:47,593
So, what?
Is something sacred
to your way of life?

249
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,860
Wake up.

250
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:54,298
A surfboard is the most
sacred thing to our way of life.

251
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,704
It's- It's your girlfriend,
your car and your dick,
all in one.

252
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:01,340
Guys, he's, like,
a Mexican Jesus.

253
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:05,538
So, uh, Jesus,
what do we do?

254
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,041
We do what we do whenever
we don't know what to do.

255
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,116
Oh, no! It's alive!

256
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,624
[Laughs]

257
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,993
Party at the Shelburn house
again, Anne?

258
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,629
Come on. We gotta
meet some new people.
Withering away over here.

259
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:30,802
Oh, God, Iris, please. Shut up.
Have some fun. Lighten up.
I want to have fun.

260
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,122
I really do.
Okay, then have fun.

261
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:35,407
[Groans]
Okay, who's gonna be there?

262
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,508
Well, who do you think?

263
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,544
J.D., Lardo,
the Yard guys,

264
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,847
Mike Moke,
um, James, Bernard-
[Grunts]

265
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,483
What?
What is your problem?
I just... Well, look.

266
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,015
I wanna meet some guys who are
into the same things I'm into.

267
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,513
Um, Iris, boyfriends
aren't into poetry,
painting and art.

268
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,695
Just have some fun,
for me, please? Please?

269
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,067
Yeah, for you. It's easy
for you to say. You've got
sunshine boy out there.

270
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:04,401
Yeah, that's not
that easy.

271
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,539
Know what?
First chance I get,
I'm getting outta here.

272
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,174
I'm going to New York
and I'm gonna be an artist.

273
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,911
You know, I don't care about
being rich or famous, dude.

274
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,714
I just wanna work
and keep my edge.

275
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:18,749
Your edge?
Yeah. My edge.

276
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:23,488
And when I do get a boyfriend,
he'll be into poetry,
painting and art. You watch.

277
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,222
Um, news flash, Iris.
Hmm?

278
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,626
Boyfriends who are
into all that already have
boyfriends of their own.

279
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,693
Crap.

280
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,036
I got an idea.

281
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,275
Oh, really? What?
Let's flash Sparky.

282
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,808
Okay.
You ready?

283
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:49,143
Yeah.
One, two, three.

284
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,886
What the hell
is wrong with you?

285
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,320
[Shouting, Laughing]

286
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:01,977
All right, J.D.,

287
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,093
All right, J.D.,

288
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:06,081
tell me the story
in excruciating detail.

289
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:08,999
All right, so,
I was out on my board,

290
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,304
and then, like, all
of a sudden out of nowhere,

291
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,773
this, like, perfect wave
just comes at me.

292
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,940
So I paddle into it, right?

293
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:20,145
And I get up, and I lay down,
like, this sweet bottom turn,

294
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,180
and then, like,
I was right there, yeah.

295
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,885
I'm right there, and the wave
just starts throwing
its lip over me,

296
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,086
just, like, throwing it
over me like that.

297
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,257
It was, like, the most
beautiful feeling of my life.

298
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,858
And what happened
after that, man?

299
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,863
Uh...
Come on, man.
You had to see something, bro.

300
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:41,299
Yeah, uh, I'm lookin'
around, and...

301
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,404
And I see Del.

302
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,964
Yeah, man.
The first person I saw
on the beach was Del.

303
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,752
Del. Hey, Del.

304
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,087
Oh. Hey, guys.
What's up?

305
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:08,425
Hey.
Hey, hey.
Everything okay?

306
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,197
Yeah. Del, uh, listen.
Do you remember
seeing me this morning?

307
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:15,365
Sure. It was about 8:57,
close to 9:00.

308
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,904
I tell time by the sun,
and I usually get it right
within a minute or two.

309
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:23,475
All right, well, look,
my surfboard got stolen.
Did you see anything?

310
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,761
Yeah.
Did you see... anything?

311
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:28,689
What do you mean,
the souther?

312
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,548
He was drivin' a Datsun 280Z.

313
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,650
It was orange.
Do you remember
anything else?

314
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:38,748
Dudes, you can't get
the right answers in life unless
you ask the right questions.

315
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,660
Whoa.

316
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,859
[Lardo]
"2QAM574."

317
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,436
Uh...

318
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,176
[Sparky]
So, what is
the right question?

319
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:01,270
[J.D.]
I don't know.

320
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:09,321
Really, J.D., if I could find
the guy who did this to you,

321
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:11,288
I would kill him!

322
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:15,176
No. You know what?
I wouldn't just kill him.
[Laughs]

323
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:18,472
I'd beat his ass first,
and then I would kill him.

324
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:21,698
No. You know what?
I'd kick his ass and kill him,

325
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,769
but first, I'd steal his board
so he knew what it felt like.

326
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,574
Shut up, stupid.
Why would he steal J.D.'s
board if he already had one?

327
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,377
What?
If he had a board
to steal, I mean.

328
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,297
I'd steal that one.
Wait. What?

329
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,975
Which one would you...
steal?

330
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,584
I'd steal 'em both, dude.
Yeah.

331
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:45,288
I'm a badass.
Okay, so how are we
gonna find this guy?

332
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:49,327
Oh, she said something
about that souther
in the Datsun, yeah?

333
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:52,664
Yeah, right.
The orange 280Z, huh?
Yeah.

334
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,967
- You stupid blind fucker!
- [Tires Screech]

335
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:59,704
[Screams]
Oh, fuck.
Here we go again.

336
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,738
What-
What, Sparky?

337
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,141
What, Sparky?
What's wrong?

338
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,744
What? I saw a guy
driving an orange 280Z,

339
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,283
but I didn't think
that anyone would
fuckin' steal a board,

340
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:13,418
so I didn't even get
a good look at him!

341
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,887
Dude, relax!
What?

342
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,941
Fuck you. I'm not gonna relax.
[J.D.]You're just
remembering this now?

343
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:22,961
I'm gonna fuckin' kill this guy
after I kill you.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

344
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:24,961
Who, the souther?
Yeah, man.

345
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,063
He was driving around
in this sleazy,

346
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,434
fuckin'
"pick up some pussy"
Valley boy car...

347
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,737
with the board hanging
out the back, dude.

348
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:35,906
Green and yellow,
right?
Yeah?

349
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:39,844
Yeah? Well, how do you know
he was a souther?

350
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:43,748
Dude, he had a fuckin'
typical Ken doll haircut.

351
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:46,318
Total valley boy
faggy-ass shit,

352
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:48,854
and... the fucker
had pants.

353
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:51,157
Like slacks.

354
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:53,960
Pants?
Pants?

355
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:56,693
[Both]
Uh-oh.

356
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,219
Hey, guys,
uh, look who it is.

357
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,301
[Lardo]
It's red bikini girl.
[J.D.] Red bikini girl.

358
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,904
[Lardo]
Coming straight for you.

359
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:09,169
Check it out.
Mm-hmm.

360
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,439
What I wouldn't do to nib
on one of those nips.

361
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,581
Dude, what I wouldn't
do to suck on both
of those nipples.

362
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:39,264
[Together]
A little bit of booty
never hurt nobody.

363
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,046
Your mom home,
Sparky?

364
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,684
Maybe we should go in
and say hi.

365
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,053
Yeah, I don't know.

366
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:57,387
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

367
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,295
Shit.
What?

368
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,868
I'm supposed to meet this kid
today, and I'm selling him
my skateboard.

369
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:12,569
You're selling
your skateboard?

370
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,974
Yeah, they're gonna
shut off our electric
if we don't pay the bill.

371
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:18,174
- Seriously, bro?
- How much?

372
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,578
Sixteen dollars.
Don't sweat it, dude.

373
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:26,017
Uh, we have to figure out this...
uh, what is it-

374
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:29,486
2QAN...
Later.

375
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,788
Later?
Yeah, later.

376
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:34,121
First we're gonna
get 16 bucks.

377
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,430
You ready?

378
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,594
Check this dude out.

379
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:51,960
Mr. C., how ya doin'?
Hey.

380
00:26:51,995 --> 00:26:55,689
So, uh, anyway,
Mr. Candidas.

381
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:59,349
Candianedas.
Uh, okay, so-

382
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,018
So I see this bitchin'
wave coming in, right?

383
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:05,590
I've already heard
this stupid story from
your stepfather, the drunk.

384
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,759
Oh, yeah?
He was in here already?

385
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,859
Oh, that's great. Typical.
Hey!

386
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:13,798
Hey. So, uh, yeah,
I was trying to tell ya
a story, all right? So listen.

387
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,866
So I drop in on this wave,
and I'm, like, totally stoked,

388
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:20,488
and then it was,
like, I'm doin' a cutback
and I lay it down with my hand.

389
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:24,075
And I'm, like,
skimmin' it with my hand,
and the lip starts folding over.

390
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,878
It's, like,
coming over me like this.
And I'm like, "Whoa!"

391
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:28,712
And then I'm like, "Whoa!"

392
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,684
And this giant liquid cavern
of liquid water
from another planet-

393
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:36,187
[Lardo]
Dude, I've been looking
for these all day.

394
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:39,090
Look what I found.
All right.

395
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,490
Yeah, we'll have these.

396
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:45,063
Beef.
Uh, you got any dough?

397
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:47,063
Uh, no. Do you?

398
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,301
Yeah, um,
we're gonna have to
come back for those later.

399
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,969
Yeah, later. Okay.
Catch ya.

400
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,739
[Lardo Laughs]
Let's get outta here.

401
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:57,009
[Chuckles]
Feels kinda good, huh?

402
00:27:57,044 --> 00:27:59,929
[Chuckles]
Feels kinda good, huh?

403
00:27:59,964 --> 00:28:02,814
What?
Helpin' out Sparky's mom.

404
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:05,315
She's a nice lady.

405
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,585
Can you keep a secret?
Dude, yeah.

406
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,623
What-What's up?
Alice is not really his mom.

407
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:14,124
What?
Yeah. She's his grandma.

408
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,661
He just calls her that.
Where's his mom?

409
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:19,831
She bailed, man.

410
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,032
Whoa.

411
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,869
There ya go, son.

412
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:28,071
There you go.
Thank you, sir.

413
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:32,375
This is a nice couch.
Got it at Sears.

414
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,948
Now if the wife asks,
I didn't give you any money.

415
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:40,183
Sure, okay.

416
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,987
Harry, Peggy works
at the D.M.V., right?

417
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:46,122
Mm-hmm.
What?

418
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:49,527
All right. Bye, Marge.

419
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,897
Okay.
We got... 2QUAN574,

420
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,898
1979 Datsun,

421
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:58,703
registered
to a 17-year-old kid
named Brian Kramer,

422
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:02,474
212 South Valley Road,
Valley Village.

423
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,574
Here ya go.
Brian Kramer.

424
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,779
You don't know how much
we appreciate this.

425
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:11,648
Well, do me a favor.
Don't kill him.

426
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:16,552
Oh, and next time you sell Harry
some stolen beer, get somethin'
better than this shit, please.

427
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,655
Fuckin' southers.

428
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,323
Oooh, stand by
with the beer.

429
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,369
[Laughs]

430
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,507
[Coughing]

431
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,145
If you barf,
I am not cleaning that up.

432
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,670
That what dogs are for,
tardo.

00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:48,518
Hey, boys.
[Both]
Red bikini girl.

434
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:53,547
Little bit of booty

[Chuckles]

435
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,198
[Woman]
Do you think
she's had a boob job?

436
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:02,866
[Anne]
Hey, Mom?
Yeah, honey.

437
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,135
Can we, like, have a bottle
of something, please?

438
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,905
Oh, go ahead.
Take the half bottle
of vodka from the bar.

439
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,877
But no drinking and driving.
Okay. Thanks, Mom.
You rock hard.

440
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,413
Yeah, well, I used to.

441
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:16,613
Anne.
Yeah.

442
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,117
- I found it.
- You found your board?

443
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:20,617
[J.D.] Yeah.
Hi, J.D.

444
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,187
- Oh, hey, Brenda.
- What's this about your board?

445
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:28,493
We know where it is. I just
gotta go get it. Can we go back
to my house? I need to change.

446
00:30:28,528 --> 00:30:30,586
[Anne]
Yeah, yeah, sure.

448
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:40,505
Mom, come on!
We talked about this.
Okay, we're going. Geez.

449
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,639

450
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,990
I love you too.

[Iris] Bye.

451
00:30:45,025 --> 00:30:47,307
[J.D.]

452
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:54,085
Oh, there you are,
Johnny boy.
I heard what happened.

453
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,319
Oh, honey.
Mom!

454
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,624
Ja. Herb, the milkman, told me.
Oh, Johnny.

455
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,624
Come on, Mom.
Oh, don't worry.

456
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,563
We'll get it back for you,
my poor baby.

457
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:07,622
We're onto it, Ma,

458
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:14,528
Oh, Johnny.
I give you some stew
to take with you.

459
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,538
La Lumbie.

460
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,716
Come on, sweetheart, huh?

461
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:27,884
Did you miss me?

462
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,649
I need ya now.

463
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,859
Come on now.
Come on.

464
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,664
Here you go, honey.

465
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:43,468
Oh, Johnny, please.
Just try it.
Just try it.

466
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:46,638
All right, all right.
Mm-hmm.

467
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,605
Uh-huh.
Ja. Is good.

468
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,074
Uh, now can I go?
Oh. Ja.

469
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:55,446
Here, Anne. Hold this.
I gotta focus.
Okay, baby.

470
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:59,082
Come on. Come on.
Come to Papa.
Mmm.

471
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,353
[Engine Revs, Dies]
That's it. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

472
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:06,619
[Engine Starts]
Whoo! Atta girl!

473
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,096
Good luck, Johnny.

474
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:16,430
# Oh, Gidget goes to hell #

475
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,137
Whoo.
[Laughs]

476
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:24,809
So get this.
I totally saw this guy
today, man.

477
00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:26,876
He's drivin'
down the road...

478
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:30,949
in this bright-ass orange
"look at me" 280Z.

479
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:33,216
The typical souther.

480
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:37,755
I mean, it seemed like his hair
was personally styled
by Vidal Sassoon.

481
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,188
And, uh, he was wearing pants.

482
00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:44,586
[Anne] What?
[Lardo]
Pants.

483
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,251
# Gidget goes to hell #

484
00:32:50,286 --> 00:32:52,368
# Gidget goes to hell #

485
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:56,341
# She's the center of attention
as she runs into the wave #

486
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:59,944
# Paddles way outside, yeah
waiting for the big one ##

487
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,880
[Knocking]
[Boy]
Come on. I gotta pee.

488
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:05,615
[Exhales]
[J.D.]

These fucking southers,

00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,524
they come to
our beautiful beach...

492
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,495
and they desecrate it,
and I'm sick of it!

493
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,532
It's over, and they're
going to pay now.

- So fucking frightening.

495
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:26,388
Totally.
It turns me on.
What?

496
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:29,172
Whatever.
God, you're so weird.

497
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,708
All right, now here's the deal.
An elite team of us,

498
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:36,612
a band of brothers,
are gonna go tonight,
in La Lumbie...

499
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:41,919

There's somethin'
I need to do.

509
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,632
So, Mike, I know I should
have been more careful.

510
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:33,771
I'm gonna get the board back
and I'm gonna get you
that last payment too.

511
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:38,121
We got an address,
we know where this guy is.

512
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:42,437
So, you know, don't worry.
It'll be easy.

514
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,722
They're gonna run off
to the Valley and probably
get into a bunch of trouble.

515
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,577
Let's go get us
a surfboard.

516
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,416
Mooney's comin' with us.
Now we can take on the

00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,401
That was, like, too easy, man.
We should just get
outta here, bro.

652
00:45:37,436 --> 00:45:40,529
No. We're not goin'
anywhere yet.

653
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,573
There's one thing I hate
worse than a liar.

654
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,347
And that's a thief.

655
00:45:50,382 --> 00:45:52,881
I need to apologize.

656
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,579
My son's done a bad thing here,
and I can understand
you all being upset.

657
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:07,262
- What's your name?
- Mike Mooney.

658
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:10,562
Well, Mike Mooney, I suppose
you have an idea of how
you'd like to handle this.

659
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:16,538
I think we'd like
to handle it ourselves.

660
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:20,566
My son stole a surfboard.
He didn't kill anyone.

661
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,413
It's understood.

662
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,952
All right.
What's up with you?
Nothing.

663
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:31,555
Come on, Iris.
I know you
better than that.

664
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,622
What's goin' on?
What?

665
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,009
Don't "what" me.
What's goin' on?

666
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:38,362
There's nothing
going on, Anne.

667
00:46:38,397 --> 00:46:41,195
Iris. Speak to me.

668
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,736
I know the guy. Okay?
I know him.

669
00:46:45,771 --> 00:46:48,036
You what?

670
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,474
- You got it back.
Right on.
- [Anne] That's awesome!

671
00:46:50,509 --> 00:46:52,541
[Mooney]
That was too easy.

672
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,078
Yeah. Now what the fuck
do we do?

673
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:57,581
Why don't we just,
you know, go home?

674
00:46:57,616 --> 00:47:00,048
What? What?
No, no, no, no, no.

675
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:03,353
Fuck that, J. D!
We came all the way
out to this Valley.

676
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:06,140
We gotta do something
to this fucking guy!
Come on!

677
00:47:06,175 --> 00:47:08,584
[Anne]
Come on, J.D.
You got your surfboard back.

678
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:10,959
There's still time to go
back to the Shelburn house.

679
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,697
Imagine the look
on everyone's face when
you come back with the board.

680
00:47:13,732 --> 00:47:15,631
No! Shh! No.

681
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,202
Getting the board back
is only half the journey.
Totally.

You know what you
gotta do, right?

684
00:47:22,574 --> 00:47:24,706
I mean, you gotta
find this guy.

685
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:27,578
And scare the living
shit out of him.

do we do now?

688
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:36,118
[J.D.]
I don't know.
I'll know it when I see him.

689
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,288
That's it?
We're just gonna wait here
until he comes back?

690
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:41,358
You don't get it, do you?
I can't walk away from this.

691
00:47:41,393 --> 00:47:43,994
I gotta- I gotta either
wait here till he comes,

692
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:45,961
or I gotta go
find the guy.

693

That could take forever.

Do you know how fucking huge
this city is?

695
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,792
He's at Buffalo Records
in Tarzana. He works there.

At least that's-that's where
he worked when we were dating.

You dated this guy?

698

Iris.
He wears pants.

699
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:09,119
- Idiot. You have pants on.
- That's completely different.

700
00:48:09,154 --> 00:48:11,955
He gave me records, okay?
It lasted for, like,
10 minutes.

701
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,189
And then I dumped him,
and he got all freaky.

702
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,693
I didn't know he would do
something like this, J.D.
I'm sorry.

actually trigger a response
in the brain's pleasure zones...

707

this tidbit of information?
Uh...

Look, all I'm saying is,
you know,

812
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:11,243
things are gonna be...
different now.

813
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,721
Man!
[Clears Throat]
I hate this shit.

814
00:54:17,756 --> 00:54:20,388
Start talkin' about
the future,

815
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,914
gettin' all high
and serious.
[Scoffs]

816
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:28,698
Shit. I don't know
what I'm gonna do
in an hour.

817
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:30,600
Yeah, and that's
really fucked.

818
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:33,101
What are you saying, Anne?

819
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:36,671
A lot of people,
they stay in Ventura,
keep partying, surfing.

820
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:40,677
People like who... Harry,
you know, who gets kids
to steal beer for him?

821
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:42,611
Great fuckin' role models, J.D.

822
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,813
You think we should
buy into this shit-

823
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,783
that we should start workin'
and wearin' pants?

824
00:54:46,818 --> 00:54:49,002
Is that it, huh?
Buying insurance.

825
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:51,187
Or get a vacuum cleaner
and shit?

826
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,122
Yeah?

827
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:57,527
You really think that this
is all there is to life?

828
00:54:57,562 --> 00:55:00,087
[Exhales]
Maybe.

829
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,965
[Exhales]

830
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,026
If I thought that,
I would so fucking
kill myself.

831
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,371
[Mooney]
You don't have to,
you know?

832
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,813
You don't have to buy
a vacuum cleaner.

833
00:55:16,848 --> 00:55:19,941
What choice do you have,
Mooney?

834
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:25,522
We need more beer.
[Lardo]
I'll go.

835
00:55:25,557 --> 00:55:27,856
Me too.
[Iris]
Yeah.

836
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,859
Are you okay?
Will you help me,
Lardo?

837
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,900
Those guys are acting
like such guys tonight.

838
00:55:36,935 --> 00:55:39,901
Yeah.
[Laughs]

839
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,070
This pot's having,
like, no effect.

840
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:45,199
Um, you just gotta give it
some time to kick in,
you know?

841
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,808
Careful, dude.

842
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,520
[Sighs]

843
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:01,256
I'm thinkin'
about Iris.

844
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:05,228
Anne's goin' to college.
Probably meet some guy.

845
00:56:05,263 --> 00:56:07,788
Iris is movin'
to New York.

846
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,938
How do you guys
do that anyways?

847
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:19,492
Do what?
Get chicks and all, man.

848
00:56:19,527 --> 00:56:23,012
Easy. Just put
your hand here...

849
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:25,080
inside their leg.

850
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:28,184
And then you just
slide it up.
Slide it up.

851
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,799
It works every time,
man.

852
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:33,380
Yeah. Feels pretty good.

853
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,993
Not your own leg, man.

854
00:56:37,028 --> 00:56:39,223
The chick's.
Oh.

855
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:50,400
Well, Lardo says
apple wine works
pretty good too.

856
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:59,208
It's like... It's just
like driving a car.

857
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:04,421
What would you do
if you were gonna go
on a long road trip...

858
00:57:04,456 --> 00:57:07,117
with... La Lumbie?

859
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:11,544
Mmm, get in,

860
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:14,806
start 'er up...

861
00:57:14,841 --> 00:57:17,999
and take off.
Go.

862
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:21,069
[Laughs]
God, no. Listen.

863
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:25,200
You gotta... You gotta
sweet-talk her a little.

864
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:30,079
Give 'er a little loving,
a little nurturing.

865
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,432
You baby her a little.

866
00:57:32,467 --> 00:57:34,716
You check her, um-

867
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:39,722
You check her fluids-
make sure there's
enough lubrication.

868
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:43,726
You kick the tires...
make sure your rubber
is good.

869
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,559
When you feel confident
and ready,

870
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:51,199
you slide
in the driver's seat.

871
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,437
You tickle the starter
and you turn her over.

872
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:58,273
Then you... You slip it
into drive...

873
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:02,802
and you gently...
start to push her forward.

874
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,781
And then
you're on your way.

875
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:10,253
But that's when you
have to... you have
to listen to her,

876
00:58:10,288 --> 00:58:12,278
really start
to pay attention.

877
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:19,162
And as she starts to warm up,
her temperature starts to rise,
that's when you know,

878
00:58:19,197 --> 00:58:21,892
you know, you can...
you can pump her
a little harder.

879
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:25,600
You know?
And she'll let you know.

880
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,735
When she's ready, she'll-
she'll start to hum.

881
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,907
And when she starts to hum,
you go pedal to the metal,

882
00:58:30,942 --> 00:58:33,376
as hard as you can
for as long as you can.

883
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:35,362
That's... That's
when it's good.

884
00:58:35,397 --> 00:58:37,906
That's when it gets,
you know-

885
00:58:37,941 --> 00:58:40,381
That's, like,
you're a machine...

886
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,951
on the open back road
somewhere in America...

887
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:46,689
with nothing but, like,
forest or cornfields
on either side of you,

888
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:48,520
with stars and sky and-

889
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:53,329
And no traffic lights.
There's no coppers.
There's no worries.

890
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:57,534
That's as-That's
as good as it gets.

891
00:58:57,569 --> 00:59:00,668
That's...

892
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,331
That's being a man.
That's heaven on earth
is what that is.

893
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:14,945
What does all that
have to do with
gettin' women?

894
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,613
[Exhales]
That-

895
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:25,028
You don't have
to worry about it
for a long time,

896
00:59:25,063 --> 00:59:27,362
um, Sparky.

897
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:31,267
## [Reggae, Indistinct]
All right.
Where's the turn?

898
00:59:31,302 --> 00:59:34,302
It's coming, l-I think.

899
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,307
It's either coming,
or we passed it.
What?

900
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:40,141
Turn here.
Turn here!
Okay, okay!

901
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:43,236
[Lardo]
Take the back streets,
all right?

902
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:47,150
Okay. Valley View.

903
00:59:47,185 --> 00:59:49,684
Valley Lane.

904
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,886
Valley Drive.
Great.

905
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,617
They're all the same
stupid name.

906
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,494
Damn. We're gonna miss it.

907
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:00,728
[Anne]
Miss what?
The fight.

908
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:05,568
Lardo, you are so busted.
You wanna see the fight.

909
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:08,905
Yeah. I kind of do.

910
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,173
Okay. Where are we?

911
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:16,646
Lost. Totally,
completely lost.

912
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:19,147
I'm leally, leally lost.

[Laughing]
Not funny, Lardo!

916
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,525
What have you
done to her?

917
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,060

All right, what
just happened?

920
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:47,210
Well, I think
we're out of gas.

921
01:00:47,245 --> 01:00:49,610
You just filled it up.

922
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,316
I only put one dollar in.

926
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,528
Whoa.

927
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:15,537
- Whoa, what?
- You hear that?

928
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,641
I don't hear shit.

929
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:24,204
That's just it.
You can't hear
the ocean.

930
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,518
That's weird.

931
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,723
You can't hear it.
You can't smell it.

932
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:36,257
Yeah.

01:01:38,596 --> 01:01:40,654
Whoa. Shit.

935
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,172
You proud of yourself,
Brian?

936
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:55,611
What got into your head?
Stealing... I know I didn't
teach you that.

937
01:01:55,646 --> 01:01:57,931
What's he doing?
You think this
reflects well on us?

938
01:01:57,966 --> 01:02:00,216
Shh. I can't hear him.
You're damn right
it doesn't.

[Snoring]
Okay, boys.

940
01:02:02,782 --> 01:02:05,243
Shit.
You can come out.

941
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,527
Sparky. Psst!
[Snoring Continues]

942
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:20,301
You got somethin'
to say?

943
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:24,605
Why'd you do it?
Do you even surf?

944
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,444
Then why steal a surfboard?
It was stupid.
Just forget it.

945
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:30,537
Too late for that, Brian.
Just tell him.

946
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:36,651
My girlfriend...
Iris.

947
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,405
She broke up with me
for some, uh, surfer.

948
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,125
So you were just pissed
at some random surfer,

949
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,177
and so you decided
to steal my board?

950
01:02:44,212 --> 01:02:46,388
What's the fuckin'
logic in that, huh?

951
01:02:46,423 --> 01:02:48,564
You got your board back.
This is over.

952
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:51,566
That's not for you
to say.

953
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,504
Now, the way I see it is this.
You have two options.

954
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:57,538
One, you can
call the cops.
[Scoffs]

955
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:01,026
Or two, you can dole out
a whipping for yourself.

956
01:03:01,061 --> 01:03:04,480
What's it gonna be?
I'll take option number two.

957
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:07,017
Dad, these guys are
gonna fuckin' kill me.

958
01:03:07,052 --> 01:03:09,519
Brian, don't embarrass
yourself any further.

959
01:03:09,554 --> 01:03:12,955
You get three swings.
That's all. Fair?

960
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,820
Fair.

961
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:21,429
I got him!
[Grunts]

962
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,397
That's one.
Fuck, Sparky.

963
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,569
- Piece of cake.
- Come on. He's drunk. He
doesn't know what he's doin'.

964
01:03:26,604 --> 01:03:28,755
I said three swings.
That counts.

965
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:30,872
- You got two left.
- Wait a minute.

966
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,474
He said one of you guys
gets three swings.

967
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:37,138
He already took one,
so he's gotta take
the other two.

968
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,285
I mean, that's the rule. Right?
Three swings, one guy.

969
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,719
That's what he said.

970
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,924
Fine.

971
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:52,361
Did you hear that,
Sparky? Huh?
Yeah. Yeah.

972
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:54,162
Two swings.
Two swings.

973
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:57,200
Just get me close.
I can't miss him.
Get in there.

974
01:03:57,235 --> 01:03:59,259
All right, fairy boy.

975
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,273
What the fuck?
Aw, fuck!

976
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:08,311
That's two.
That should count
as two and three.

977
01:04:08,346 --> 01:04:11,314
Keep quiet. Take your licks.

Uh!
I gotta find my tape.

1140
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:28,228
Uh, I got it.
Cool.

1141
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,432
I gotta go to work.
So, I guess
I'll see you.

1142
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,457
[Door Shuts]
[Iris]
Of course.

1143
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:39,024
Hey, uh, you know,
whatever happened back there...

1144
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:41,642
Oh, he just... He just
roughed me up a little.

1145
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:44,046
The fucker, he tore
my shirt.
You're okay, and I'm okay.

1146
01:14:44,081 --> 01:14:46,982
So we're good, right?
You-You're okay?

1147
01:14:47,017 --> 01:14:49,450
You know what?
[Exhales]

1148
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,419
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, right?

1149
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:56,358
Whoa.
[Laughs]
[Laughs]

1150
01:14:56,393 --> 01:14:59,027
Dude, I didn't
make that up.

1151
01:14:59,062 --> 01:15:01,463
It's still good though.

1152
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:03,931
Yeah?
Yeah.

1153
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,517
Later?

1154
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:12,531
Sure.

1155
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:18,614
Hey, I'm really sorry
that prick stole
your board, dude.

1156
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:21,984
- It's not your fault.
- [Scoffs] I know that.

1157
01:15:22,019 --> 01:15:24,509
[Laughs]
Later, gator.
Nice work.

1158
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:30,425
Hey. Later, darlin'.
Tell your mom
I love her stew.

1159
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,828
Tell your mom
I love her daughter.

1160
01:15:32,863 --> 01:15:34,895
You're such a liar.

1161
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,626
What? I'm so totally
committed to you.

1162
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,305
Yeah, you're committed
to something, but...
it ain't me, babe.

1163
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,273
What's that
supposed to mean?

1164
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:51,344
When you figure it out,
call me.

1165
01:15:56,785 --> 01:16:00,856
Hey, Lardo.
What do you think
it all means, man?

1166
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:02,956
What?

1167
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:05,959
The whole thing, dude.
I mean-

1168
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:09,131
This guy gets dumped,
he steals my board.

1169
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:11,098
He doesn't even
know me.

1170
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:14,169
And Del just happens
to be there, and it's,
like, we get this name.

1171
01:16:14,204 --> 01:16:16,503
And because of that,
we go to the Valley?

1172
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:19,507
Yeah, yeah. No, no.
We're building over
in Ventura.

1173
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:24,379
Oh, it's wonderful.
Four stories.

1174
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:27,180
[Lardo]
Brian Kramer, bro.

1175
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:30,919
He turned out to be
not such a bad guy,

1176
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:34,623
just some dude
who got dumped by Iris.

1177
01:16:34,658 --> 01:16:36,490
Bro, she took his heart,

1178
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:40,162
and she just, like,
ripped it up into pieces.

1179
01:16:40,197 --> 01:16:43,029
She's fuckin' vicious,
that girl.

1180
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:49,336
Well, we got your board back.

1181
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:56,545
[Brakes Squeal]
Shit!

1182
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,445
Oh, shit!

1183
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,041
[Groans]

1184
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:09,625
[Sighs]
It looks okay, dude.

1185
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,392
Mmm.

1186
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:14,361
- It doesn't look too bad.
- Whoa!

1187
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,812
Hey, man!
Whoa! No!

1188
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:21,661
[Board Clattering]

1189
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:39,345
[J.D. Narrating]
At that moment, it hit me.

1190
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:43,056
It wasn't about a surfboard.

1191
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,753
It was about the journey-
with my friends.

1192
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,936
Lardo and I are still
the best of friends.

1193
01:17:55,971 --> 01:18:00,676
He has a beautiful daughter now
and always makes the best
of every day-

1194
01:18:00,711 --> 01:18:03,076
in typical Lardo fashion,
of course.

1195
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:08,083
Sparky lived every day
like there was no tomorrow.

1196
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:11,353
He rode his last wave in
at the age of 25.

1197
01:18:11,388 --> 01:18:13,520
He was truly
one of a kind, man,

1198
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:17,192
and I'll always remember
the crazy shit we used
to do together.

1199
01:18:17,227 --> 01:18:20,787
Nobody did it like Sparky.
Miss you, bro.

1200
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:25,867
Iris went to New York
and became an artist,

1201
01:18:25,902 --> 01:18:27,834
just like she said
she would.

1202
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:32,507
She's not rich and famous yet,
but she still keeps her edge...

1203
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:36,102
and visits Ventura
whenever she can.

1204
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:42,414
Anne found a great guy
willing to commit to her.

1205
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,319
She's married,
has a beautiful boy.

1206
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:49,255
And I still remain great friends
with her and her family.

1207
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:56,763
My hero... Mike Mooney.
He's a family man now.

1208
01:18:56,798 --> 01:19:01,670
Still the legend on Pierpont
and hand-shaping surfboards
in the same garage...

1209
01:19:01,705 --> 01:19:03,535
for the love of it.

1210

## [Rhythmic Tapping]

1211
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,495
Hey.

1212
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,372
[J.D. Narrating]
There's been a whole lot
of change in Ventura.

1213
01:19:37,407 --> 01:19:40,671
But then again, lots of things
have stayed the same.

1214
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,843
Like Del.

## [Rhythmic Clapping]

1216
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:53,188
And as for me,
I got a beautiful wife,

1217
01:19:53,223 --> 01:19:55,455
four great kids,

1218
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,125
play music with my friends,

1219
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,755
and still surfing...
in Ventura.
