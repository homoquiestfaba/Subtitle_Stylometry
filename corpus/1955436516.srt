1
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,957
Wait!

2
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,726
Breakfast?

3
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,661
Got everything?

4
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:07,331
I got the discharge papers,
d.D. 214, the works.

5
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,933
Don't worry about anything.

6
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:13,135
Uncle Sam's gonna take
care of me just fine.

7
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:14,569
I know he will, honey.

8
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:17,971
I'd better get kicking.

9
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:21,407
Bye-bye.

10
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,066
Good morning.

11
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:59,001
My name is
Dr. Peter Morgan.

12
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:01,069
It's my first day here.

13
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:05,372
Lot 4. You got 30 minutes
for a verification.

14
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:07,841
After that, I'll have you towed.

15
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:09,509
Thanks a lot.

16
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,329
Hey, buddy.
You got a butt?

17
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:35,798
Hell, take the pack.

18
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,865
I quit.

19
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,933
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

20
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:18,903
<i>Look, I keep telling you,</i>

21
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,971
<i>we can't approve your eligibility</i>

22
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:24,107
<i>until we have complete proof
of disability.</i>

23
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:25,975
- Next!
- Wait wait wait, lady,

24
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:29,278
now, y'all lost my records eight
months ago when I transferred here.

25
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
Now, eight months, and you
still ain't found 'em.

26
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:34,349
Eight months and you been sending me
from one fucking desk to another,

27
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:35,917
telling me the same old bullshit!

28
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,085
In the meantime, I ain't
got no damn benefits.

29
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:39,419
How am I supposed to live?

30
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:41,287
Complete this
emergency-benefits form.

31
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:44,256
Lady, I done filled out
this damn form three times.

32
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:46,992
I ain't filling out no damn more and I
ain't moving till I get my benefits.

33
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,027
Sir, without certification,

34
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,863
we have no actual proof
that you're disabled.

35
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:54,365
You want proof?

36
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:55,999
You want proof?
All right, now, look.

37
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:58,001
I'll give you some damn proof.
You want some proof?

38
00:04:58,003 --> 00:04:59,869
You need some proof? You
need some fucking proof?

39
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:02,037
Here's your goddamned proof!
Here's the motherfucking proof.

40
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,872
Get off your ass.

41
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:06,140
The goddamn proof right here.
There's some goddamn proof.

42
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:07,841
- Outside, okay?
- Now get your ass going and get me some...

43
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:09,809
Outside, okay?
Outside.

44
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,611
- Come on, man! Take it easy.
- Come on, man! Relax!

45
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,017
Yo yo yo, my man!

46
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,019
- I'm sorry.
- Watch out. Watch yourself.

47
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,321
- I'm very sorry.
- Watch yourself.

48
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:26,855
- First-timer?
- Yes.

49
00:05:26,857 --> 00:05:29,157
Luther Jerome, first air cav,

50
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:31,325
and your best hope of survival
in this man's jungle.

51
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,060
- Travis. Pat Travis.
- Come on.

52
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:35,495
<i>What the hell is going on here, Luther?</i>

53
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:37,730
This is the v.A.,
soldier.

54
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:39,965
Now, the enemy is behind those desks.

55
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,867
They got the high ground and you're
crawling on your belly and out of ammo.

56
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:43,968
Now, you only got one chance,

57
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,136
the gospel according to Luther.

58
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,971
Whatever you need, you ain't gonna get.

59
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,139
And whatever you get, ain't worth shit.

60
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,308
- I need a triple bypass.
- Shit, forget it,

61
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,243
unless you got a congressman
in your pocket.

62
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:57,979
Otherwise, the only thing bypassed
around here is gonna be you.

63
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,581
Hey, baby, what's happening?

64
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,050
I need to know what you're talking about.

65
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:05,318
Where you been, bro, down on the farm?

66
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,887
- Yeah.
- The government's come up with a whole new disease

67
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,322
called the creeping cutback.
Hold up.

68
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:11,823
- I'm listening.
- Just a minute.

69
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:13,524
Just tell me, do I need a lawyer?

70
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:14,825
Hey, man!

71
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:17,360
Hold on. Look,

72
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:19,729
vets can't sue for government benefits.

73
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:21,731
That's been on the books
since the civil war.

74
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:25,034
Bet you never seen that in no
training film, did you, bro?

75
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,003
Carton of camels and a pizza.

76
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,738
Pepperoni, mushrooms, anything?

77
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,207
OK, man, you got it.
See you in half an hour.

78
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:35,943
Is there any way around this garbage?

79
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,979
There's always article 99.

80
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:45,416
What's that?

81
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,593
Jesus Christ.

82
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:02,964
Hi. My name is
Dr. Peter Morgan.

83
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:04,598
I was told to report here for processing.

84
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,667
Sara.

85
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:12,471
OK, Dr. Peter Morgan.

86
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,307
As of now, you work
for the federal government.

87
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,709
Filling out these forms properly

88
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:19,310
will probably be the most
significant thing

89
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:22,046
that you will accomplish during
your tenure at this hospital.

90
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:23,580
Do not, I repeat,

91
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:25,481
do not fuck them up, OK?

92
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:28,717
Your beeper number
is 2227-2227.

93
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:30,585
Dr. bobrick.
This new 'tern

94
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:32,086
is being assigned to your section.

95
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:34,154
OK.
What do you say?

96
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:36,089
- Rudy bobrick.
- Dr. Peter Morgan.

97
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:37,490
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

98
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:39,658
You must be kidding
about all this paperwork.

99
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,326
Yeah, dump them anywhere.
Sturgess is operating.

100
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,927
Who's sturgess?

101
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,962
He's probably the best surgeon
in the whole goddamn system.

102
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,231
Come on.

103
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,865
Some system you got here.

104
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:54,602
Morning. Morning.
Everybody have breakfast?

105
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:56,003
<i>- Good morning, doctor.</i>
- Man ♪2:<i> Yes, doctor.</i>

106
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:58,271
Good. Then let's open
the chest.

107
00:07:58,273 --> 00:08:01,507
Morning, Rudy.
Robin, hello.

108
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:03,008
Thank you, l.B.

109
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:06,277
Thanks.
Yeah. Question?

110
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,945
Yes,

111
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,613
Dr. sturgess,

112
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,349
why are we opening the patient's chest?

113
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:15,985
Because this patient has a four
centimeter aneurysm of his ventricle.

114
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,820
How else would you expect
me to get in there?

115
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:19,688
Not so many options,
what do you think, doctor?

116
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,190
Yes, but you see,

117
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:24,759
he was only scheduled
for prostate surgery.

118
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,427
<i>What's your name?</i>

119
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:29,863
My... my name is,
Dr. Felix stone, sir.

120
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:32,999
Look, Felix, I could tell you this
is a revolutionary technique,

121
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,767
going through his chest
to get to his prostate,

122
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,335
but you'd know I'd be full
of shit, wouldn't you?

123
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:38,537
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Wouldn't you?</i>

124
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,038
Here's the problem.

125
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,306
This patient needs
open-heart surgery.

126
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,875
The administration of this
hospital will only authorize

127
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:46,643
a prostate procedure.

128
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:48,845
Now, what good is fixing his prostate

129
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:52,381
if he has a heart attack
every time he tries to use it?

130
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:55,717
Right? Tell him, sid. Tell him the rule.

131
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:58,720
First the ventricles, then the testicles.

132
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,955
But for those of you who
have your heart set on it,

133
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,556
there'll be a prostate procedure

134
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,624
immediately following this one.
Everybody happy?

135
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:07,226
It's just that I thought
open-heart surgery was no longer,

136
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:08,994
you know, authorized, that's all.

137
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:12,130
Look, Felix,
we're here. He's here.

138
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:14,966
Why don't we make the most of this?
Right?

139
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:17,702
We can apologize to him once he
comes out of the anesthetic.

140
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:19,503
All right?

141
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:21,872
Since you're asking
all these hard questions,

142
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:25,008
I'm gonna let you make the first cut
this morning. Why don't you go scrub up?

143
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,810
No, thank you.

144
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:29,711
Anybody?

145
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:31,979
Rudy, they never want
to make the first cut.

146
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:34,648
No guts, no glory, sturg.

147
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,016
You the man.

148
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:38,518
All right, here we go.

149
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,785
Just you and I, sid.

150
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,823
Look, your case will be reviewed.

151
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:47,825
How long will that take?

152
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:51,061
Other people are waiting.

153
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:54,464
Eric!
Next.

154
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,886
Hi, my name is
Dr. Peter Morgan.

155
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:20,520
I was told to report here.

156
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:22,588
Have a seat. I'll let
him know you're here.

157
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,956
Thank you.

158
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,459
Stop panicking, Leo.
There's no provocation.

159
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,295
We're simply following
departmental guidelines.

160
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,463
Our directives are clear and unequivocal.

161
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,067
"Unless an illness
or injury is directly related

162
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,670
to the patient's military service, it
cannot be treated in a v.A. Facility."

163
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,738
Once we weed out all the ineligibles,

164
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,039
staff caseloads will be cut in two.

165
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,241
So just weed them out,
Leo, weed them out.

166
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,375
This excludes half our patients.

167
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,045
Send in Dr. Morgan,
please.

168
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:00,019
<i>Come in, Dr. Morgan.
Good to see you.</i>

169
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:02,388
Thank you.

170
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,057
I don't think you know Dr.
Krutz, our chief of medicine.

171
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,358
- Welcome aboard.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

172
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,992
Have a seat, Peter.

173
00:11:07,994 --> 00:11:09,827
We're glad you were assigned to us.

174
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,830
I believe you want to
specialize in heart surgery.

175
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:16,265
Well, I'm planning on a private practice.

176
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:17,899
Good. Very good.

177
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:20,034
I admire a strong sense of ambition.

178
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:21,268
Thank you.

179
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,003
Some fine doctors
began their careers here.

180
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:26,906
Unfortunately, you are joining
us at a difficult time.

181
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,607
As you probably know,

182
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:30,575
we're facing a serious funding situation,

183
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:33,878
as well as shortages in other areas.

184
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,114
We're all gonna have to make some
hard choices in the coming months.

185
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:39,950
You're gonna find
your most essential skill

186
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:41,751
will be flexibility.

187
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:44,453
I'd call it ingenuity.

188
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:47,255
<i>Unfortunately, there are still
some people around here</i>

189
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:50,558
<i>who are fighting the new changes.</i>

190
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,626
But you won't have that problem

191
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,061
if you start out
with the right perspective.

192
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:57,029
Did I forget anything, Leo?

193
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:58,397
No.

194
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,099
Just, follow the rules.
You'll be all right.

195
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:04,469
It looks like I've got
my work cut out for me.

196
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:06,404
Remember, Peter, my door's always open.

197
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:08,439
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

198
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:09,972
Thank you.

199
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:14,542
Good day.

200
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,778
Good boy.

201
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,480
<i>Dr. sinclair to admissions.</i>

202
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:24,115
<i>Dr. sinclair to admissions.</i>

203
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:48,469
You OK, pop?

204
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:50,637
I'm great, pal.

205
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,072
I just got to get in my truck and...

206
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:56,074
Head home to mama.

207
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,143
- I can get that.
- I got it.

208
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,945
Thanks.

209
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:04,846
Let's do it, pop.

210
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:07,615
Travis. Pat Travis.

211
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:11,418
Polaski's the name.
People call me shooter.

212
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,420
- You a dodger fan?
- No.

213
00:13:13,422 --> 00:13:15,622
Not the Dodgers,

214
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:17,857
just Mickey hatcher.

215
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:19,825
The son of a bitch looks like a farmer,

216
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:21,126
and he never quits.

217
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:22,861
Yeah, kind of like Nolan Ryan.

218
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:24,996
Exactly like Nolan Ryan.

219
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,698
What are the pills for, pop?

220
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,433
I got a little trouble with the pump,

221
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,601
that's all.
What's your problem?

222
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,638
They call it post-traumatic
stress or some bullshit.

223
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,773
But they're taking care of it, right?

224
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:40,441
Yeah.

225
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:44,311
I just got myself an article 99.

226
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:46,913
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

227
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:51,784
"The veterans administration

228
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:53,118

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

240
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:31,402
Hello, "action news"?
Give me Ross Carter.

241
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:34,238
Ross, get down here right away, baby.

242
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,974
I got your lead-in
for tonight. Yeah!

243
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:39,943
Excuse me, girls, you done in here?
We've got a code red.

244
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:41,244
Got another loony on the loose.

245
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:43,112
I'll meet you guys
down in i.C.U.

246
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:06,067
Robin, show time, girl.

247
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:12,139
Sid, Robin, Rudy,
let's go. Come on.

248
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,476
Watch out!

249
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,778
Peter, grab this.
I'm getting hernia.

250
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,380
- What the hell is going on?
- No big deal, just guy with a rifle.

251
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,040
Drop drill!

252
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:00,911
OK, let's rock 'n' roll!

253
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:10,219
Yes, Denise,
I'm admitting a Mr. tenabe

254
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:11,887
as a voluntary psychiatric patient.

255
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:13,688
Yes, all right,
good. Thanks.

256
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,691
So, Mr. tenabe,
the nurse will meet you

257
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:19,326
right down here
and show you to your room.

258
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,961
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

259
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:25,331
What's going on here? This is psychiatric.
What are you doing?

260
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,166
It's probably just another
patient going berserk.

261
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:30,569
Let me check... watch Mr. tenabe.
I'll be right back.

262
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:43,981
<i>Do you remember khe sanh?</i>

263
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:47,083

264
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:54,756

266

267
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,430

268
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:05,831
Triple nickel?

269
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,566
Do you remember?

270
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:10,735
Do you remember?

271
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:22,010
<i>Kill for peace?</i>

272
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:25,012
What do you think you're doing?

273
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:26,613
Put that gun down right away!
You hear me?

274
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:27,847
Look at me when I'm talking...

275
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:33,852
Stay put or I'll staple
your ass to the ground.

276
00:18:33,854 --> 00:18:36,855
Hey, look, look, if you
want to shoot someone,

277
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:38,857
shoot one of those bigwigs
upstairs, all right?

278
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:41,092
<i>They're the ones that...</i>

279
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:43,026
They're the ones that deserve it.

280
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:46,929
Is your head all right?

281
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:48,764
Yeah.

282
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:50,699
<i>What's your name?</i>

283
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,801
Sh... shooter.

284
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:55,302
<i>OK, shooter.</i>

285
00:18:58,073 --> 00:18:59,772
You got a match?

286
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:02,441
Those things will kill you.

287
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:03,575
Look, here's the deal.

288
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,810
You get those bigwigs
to come downstairs here,

289
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,878
and then you got yourself
some important hostages,

290
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,914
and you let these civilians out of here.

291
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,416
All right, leave it to me.
I'm going to take care of it.

292
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,985
Why the fuck should I trust you?

293
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,820
This whole place is full of shit.

294
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:20,923
'Cause I'm still in this place
after seven fucking years.

295
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:22,824
That makes me even crazier
than you, believe me.

296
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:25,326
Are you actually instructing
this man how to take hostages?

297
00:19:25,328 --> 00:19:27,094
What are you doing?
I told you to stay put!

298
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,895
Hostages are a temporary solution.

299
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:31,030
They are not gonna solve your problem.
Do you know that?

300
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:33,098
Fine. Would you like
some shock treatments?

301
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't think he's interested.

302
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:37,201
Do you want me to have him
lie down here now

303
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:39,243
so you can discuss his
relationship with his mother?

304
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,939
He's a deranged individual.

305
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:46,007
You don't know what
you're dealing with, doctor.

306
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:49,677
Look, let's pretend
she does not exist, OK?

307
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,880
The media doesn't give diddly
squat about these little people.

308
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:55,048
What you gotta do now
is you gotta give them names.

309
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,551
Now, your best bet's gonna
be the executive director

310
00:19:58,553 --> 00:19:59,852
and the chief of medicine.

311
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:02,721
You understand?

312
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:05,623
That's gonna get you
three major networks and c.N.N.,

313
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,191
maybe even "Oprah."

314
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:10,194
You are jeopardizing the lives
of innocent people here.

315
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:12,896
Shut the fuck up, lady!
Shut up the fuck up.

316
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,932
If you like your life... if you like
your life, you'll shut the fuck up!

317
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:18,534
Now shut the fuck up!
You hear me? Shut up!

318
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,182
It's all right. I'm just
gonna make the call.

319
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:39,152
Yeah.

320
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:43,289
Give me dreyfoos. Now.

321
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,258
<i>You've got the executive
director on the phone.</i>

322
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,060
It's your move.

323
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:51,962
Listen, these guys are tricky.

324
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:53,496
So remember,

325
00:20:53,498 --> 00:20:54,830
no deals over the phone,

326
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:57,332
they come down here, and then you talk.

327
00:20:58,802 --> 00:21:00,434
No deals.

328
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:04,236
You're not dicking with me, are you?

329
00:21:04,238 --> 00:21:07,471
No. Here.

330
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:11,074
Come on.

331
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:14,510
Now.
Now now, Rudy!

332
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,946
OK, next batter. Anyone?

333
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:19,881
Let's get some oxygen over here!

334
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,083
All right, he's breathing.

335
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:24,851
He's breathing. Who's got the hypo?
Who's got the hypo?

336
00:21:24,853 --> 00:21:26,319
Come on, stick him.
Stick him.

337
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:28,321
You got the oxygen?

338
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:30,656
- Is that all right?
- It's good. It's strong, real strong.

339
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,164
Code blue in the lobby outside!

340
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,865
Morgan, don't you just love this shit?

341
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:46,635
Take that.
Take it!

342
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:49,304
- Boy can't get enough.
- Check... check for any other casualties, OK?

343
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:51,072
- Can do, sturg.
- He's all yours, doctor.

344
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,644
What are you doing with that, Luther?

345
00:21:57,646 --> 00:21:59,779
Don't worry, no gun, no weapons charge.

346
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:02,214
- Go ahead. I'll take care of it.
- Be cool, Luther.

347
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:09,119
Shit.

348
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,854
Come on.

349
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:14,457
Out of the way!

350
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:23,765
Get a gurney.
Get a gurney! Now!

351
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:30,469
Get out of the way!

352
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:35,306
Get it on him, sid.
Get it on him, sid.

353
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:36,807
<i>Get it on him, sid.</i>

354
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:37,908
Here we go.

355
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,242
<i>All right, come on.</i>

356
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:43,879
Come on. On his feet.
On his feet.

357
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:45,981
Come here! You you!
On his feet, let's go!

358
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:49,884
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

359
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:52,086
Ladies and gentlemen, please, now...

360
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:53,754
We'll issue a statement

361
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:56,056
as soon as we've had a chance
to assess the situation.

362
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:58,158
I'm sorry, I can't tell you
anything at this point.

363
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,826
You know as much as I do,

364
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:02,562
but as soon as I find something
out, you'll be the first to know.

365
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,931
Doctor, can you tell us what caused
that man to go on a rampage?

366
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:08,601
Keep depriving these patients of essential
medical services and what do you expect?

367
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:10,102
<i>The administration of this hospital</i>

368
00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:12,037
is only concerned
with one thing... saving a buck.

369
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,406
Any more cutbacks, we're gonna
be operating out on the street.

370
00:23:14,408 --> 00:23:16,674
Patients claim it's difficult
getting admitted, is that true?

371
00:23:16,676 --> 00:23:18,275
Tell 'em to drive right in,
like everyone else.

372
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:20,744
Thank you, doctor. We got it.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

373
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:27,750
Get it off, Bob.
Let's get the blood gas.

374
00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:29,885
Right, sid, intubate him.

375
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,519
- OK, sturg.
- There you go. There you go.

376
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:33,854
Get that blood gas.

377
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:34,921
All right, get him on the monitor.

378
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:37,890
Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in there.

379
00:23:37,892 --> 00:23:40,726
There you go.
Get it on. Get it on.

380
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:42,294
Now see what's going on.

381
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,762
All you, sturg.

382
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:46,965
All right,
he's in v-tach.

383
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,600
Robin, 75 milligrams of Lidocaine.
Let's start a drip.

384
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:51,401
<i>Right.</i>
Let me see the blood gas.

385
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:54,070
- <i>I have it flowing here.</i>
- Give him an amp of bicarb too.

386
00:23:54,072 --> 00:23:57,573
- Great. Thank you.
- We're set. We're set.

387
00:23:57,575 --> 00:23:59,207
You all right there, sid?

388
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,575
Yeah. We got it.

389
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:02,109
All right, everything under control?

390
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:03,643
<i>Good good good.</i>

391
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:05,978
OK, sid, it's all yours.
I'm gonna go take a leak.

392
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:09,914
Listen to me, next time you
treat a cardiac arrest,

393
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,916
make sure the first heart
you check is your own.

394
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:14,218
If it's still beating then you
go to work on the patient.

395
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
If not, you gotta get out of the way.

396
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,021
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

397
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,558
Look, he... he's gonna
be okay, right?

398
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:31,597
How did the press
find out about this so fast?

399
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,798
I have no idea.

400
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,066
Who was that maniac with the gun?

401
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:37,735
Well, technically, he isn't even
a patient in this hospital.

402
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:40,337
He got upset because he
was issued an article 99.

403
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:41,738
Where is he now?

404
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,273
Upstairs in psychiatric,
he's in a locked ward.

405
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,241
Nobody makes any comments to the press

406
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:47,942
unless they clear it
through my office first.

407
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,944
We've gotta keep this from
being blown out of proportion.

408
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,412
Talk to them.

409
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:53,914
Emphasize that he wasn't even
a patient at this hospital.

410
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,849
- He's a veteran, Henry.
- What's the difference?

411
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:58,117
We're not responsible
for every lunatic out there

412
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,985
just because he once wore our uniform.

413
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:04,321
All right, can I have
your attention, please?

414
00:25:04,323 --> 00:25:07,257
<i>Dr. bobrick, 4721.</i>

415
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:09,058
Are you nurse white?

416
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:11,859
- Morgan.
- Yeah.

417
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:13,193
Where the hell you been, 'tern?

418
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:14,861
We've been expecting you since noon.

419
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:17,196
Dr. sturgess asked me to
help with an emergency.

420
00:25:17,198 --> 00:25:20,332
Now that you're here, replace the central
line on the patient in three. Now.

421
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:21,533
Three, shit.

422
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:26,804
Good morning.

423
00:25:26,806 --> 00:25:29,039
<i>Hi.</i>
How are you doing?

424
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:32,875
I'm just gonna change
the central line here.

425
00:25:32,877 --> 00:25:35,343
You might feel just a little jab, okay?

426
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:38,546
Shit! Help!

427
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:41,882
Help! Come on!

428
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:44,150
<i>Thump his chest!</i>

429
00:25:44,152 --> 00:25:46,952
No! No!
Thump him!

430
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:49,054
<i>Hurry!
We're losing him!</i>

431
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,355
<i>Come on!</i>

432
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:53,157
Behind you, Robin.
The defib's ready.

433
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:54,925
Here.

434
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:58,861
No no. All quiet on the western front here.
Let's zap him.

435
00:25:58,863 --> 00:26:02,030
OK, charge. Clear.

436
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:07,501
Come on, partner,
give me a little something.

437
00:26:07,503 --> 00:26:09,636
What do you say? OK,
we got a heartbeat.

438
00:26:09,638 --> 00:26:12,972
Baboom!

439
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:14,840
We're inside the 40, down to the 20.

440
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:16,875
Pay dirt!
Touchdown!

441
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:18,810
Let's give him a milligram
of atropine i.V.

442
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:20,378
And get ready to insert a pacemaker.

443
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,247
The idea's is to treat them
before they stop breathing.

444
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,915
I'm sorry.

445
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,317
Cardiac arrest, a ruptured artery...

446
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,952
This kid just may have talent.

447
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,920
It can't get worse than this.

448
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,188
Give it some time.
It's early.

449
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,256
Shit.

450
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:37,591
Hey, sid.
Hey, Rudy.

451
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:39,092
What do you say?

452
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:42,095
Dr. Morgan,
new admit, room two.

453
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:43,996
- Before Christmas?
- Jesus.

454
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:46,131
You've got to respect
something like that.

455
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:49,434
50 million years of evolution
to produce an ass like that.

456
00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:52,136
Excuse me, Peter, listen, pal,

457
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:54,638
I hope you're not expecting this
kind of treatment all the time.

458
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,707
Everybody is just being nice
to you 'cause you're new.

459
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,809
I'm touched.

460
00:26:59,811 --> 00:27:01,143
Is she flirting with me, or what?

461
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:03,678
I think she genuinely cares about you.

462
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,213
Shit.

463
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:12,852
Jesus Christ, Peter,
you almost killed someone.

464
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,354
Get your shit together.

465
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:20,657
OK, 'tern, let's go!

466
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:23,359
For the next 36 hours,
your buns belong to me.

467
00:27:27,464 --> 00:27:29,397
Excuse me,
Mrs. Travis?

468
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,631
Yes.

469
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:31,898
Hi, I'm Dr. sturgess.

470
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,734
How bad is it, doctor?
Please, I need the truth.

471
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,335
Well, his condition is stable right now,

472
00:27:36,337 --> 00:27:38,536
but he's gonna need bypass
surgery as soon as possible.

473
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,538
Mrs. Travis?

474
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,374
Everything's gonna be OK.

475
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:46,008
We'll take good care of him.

476
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,311
Thank you, doctor.

477
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:52,314
<i>- Can I see him?
- No, not yet.</i>

478
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:56,084
- <i>He needs some rest.</i>
- Thank you.

479
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:02,390
How long you gonna
bullshit the lady, doc?

480
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:05,393
It'll be three weeks
just to get him admitted.

481
00:28:05,395 --> 00:28:07,061
The man will be dead by then.

482
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:10,364
Luther, we'll figure something out.
Don't worry.

483
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:12,432
Who are you kidding?

484
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:15,134
He might as well start
donating his organs.

485
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,277
Hey.

486
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,179
About earlier today,
look, I'm really sorry.

487
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:31,447
I panicked and I freaked out.

488
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:33,348
Really, no need to explain.

489
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:36,884
You know, I'm trying to apologize to you.

490
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:38,585
As long as we're gonna
be working together,

491
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:41,254
I think, maybe you could start thinking
about getting a better attitude.

492
00:28:41,256 --> 00:28:43,022
You won't be here long enough.

493
00:28:43,024 --> 00:28:46,225
No?
Where am I going?

494
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:48,393
Does that mean you're not planning

495
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:50,628
to accelerate your internship?

496
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,929
Cut your research year
and take early boards?

497
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,799
So now you read palms?

498
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:59,133
Am I wrong?

499
00:28:59,135 --> 00:29:00,968
Okay,

500
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,602
so what do I do after my boards?

501
00:29:02,604 --> 00:29:04,971
<i>Surgical residency
in a prestige hospital,</i>

502
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:08,607
then partnership in
a little money-making setup

503
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:11,643
somewhere in Connecticut
or Beverly hills.

504
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:13,478
<i>Did I leave anything out?</i>

505
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,213
No, that sounds good to me.

506
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:17,748
You got me all figured out.

507
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,949
Yeah.

508
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:21,117
The sky's the limit, doctor.

509
00:29:50,948 --> 00:29:52,414
Please!

510
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,482
<i>- They broke in again,
- Rudy.</i>

511
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:57,518
- Beg your pardon?
- They broke in again.

512
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,019
What were they looking for?

513
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:00,754
<i>Anything to hang us with.</i>

514
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:02,822
Today, I committed the unpardonable sin.

515
00:30:02,824 --> 00:30:05,457
I went public with the
administration's dirty laundry.

516
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:07,992
This is some place.

517
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:09,960
I've got to get
Travis into the O.R.

518
00:30:09,962 --> 00:30:11,928
What are you so worried about Travis for?

519
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,863
I mean, we've got a floor
full of patients,

520
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:16,265
and we can't get clearances
to operate on any of them.

521
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,133
Rudy,

522
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:20,268
what have you got?

523
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,004
- <i>Here we go, sturg.</i>
- What x-rays do you have? What could we use?

524
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:25,272
I can get you a gall bladder, pancreas,

525
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:27,941
maybe a loose herniated
disk, you know, a lung...

526
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:30,443
Even if we got the clearances,
which we do not,

527
00:30:30,445 --> 00:30:32,445
we don't have anything to operate with.

528
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:34,480
- All right, then you know what?
- What?

529
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:37,282
It's time to institute emergency
procedures here then. That's what.

530
00:30:37,284 --> 00:30:39,851
Would you be talking about
<i>the</i> midnight procedure?

531
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:42,453
- Forget it, Rudy.
- Yes, its time to do a midnight.

532
00:30:42,455 --> 00:30:43,987
I'm trying to be serious here.

533
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:46,122
Fucking-a.
Let's go. Come on.

534
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:47,656
I'll meet you down there.

535
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:49,290
Come on, we're going do
a midnight requisition.

536
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,659
Peter.

537
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:54,628
You guys have been here too long.
You need a vacation.

538
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,031
Look, you're welcome to come
along with us if you want.

539
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:00,033
No, my record's nice and clean.

540
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:01,801
I think I'll try and keep it that way.

541
00:31:01,803 --> 00:31:03,402
All right.
Suit yourself.

542
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,203
I usually do.

543
00:31:10,142 --> 00:31:12,108
Hey, sturgess!

544
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:16,845
I was wondering, did you ever
want anything else besides this?

545
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,880
There's something else besides this?

546
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:21,382
I hope so.

547
00:31:28,324 --> 00:31:30,590
I sure hope so.

548
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:35,994
Code blue.
We're on our way.

549
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,331
Yeah, we've got intruders
in the basement.

550
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,232
There can't be a code blue.

551
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,766
There ain't no patients down there.

552
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:46,567
Just check it out, all right?

553
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:02,280
Great!

554
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:08,418
Holy Christ.

555
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,887
<i>Sturg?</i>
What?

556
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,222
How come we gotta operate
with spare parts,

557
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,190
and these chimpan-fucking-zees
get all the new ones?

558
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:19,326
I don't know.
I guess they vote republican.

559
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:25,197
- We hit the lottery...
<i>- What did you get?</i>

560
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:27,199
Pacemakers.

561
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:28,633
Look at that.
That's beautiful.

562
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:31,601
Tying off there and contaminate it.

563
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:34,971
- Strip.
- No, why me?

564
00:32:34,973 --> 00:32:36,906
Why is it always me?
Why do I have to strip?

565
00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:38,874
You see someone else built
like a corpse? Strip.

566
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,242
Strip, bobrick.

567
00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:41,810
If you'd call me by my first name,

568
00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:43,732
you'd get a lot further
in these kind of affairs.

569
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:48,915
We back there again?

570
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,549
Listen!

571
00:32:58,057 --> 00:32:59,723
Let's go.

572
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:05,327
Stick your head down!

573
00:33:11,401 --> 00:33:12,967
Contaminated.

574
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:14,301
Get back. Get back.
Get back.

575
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:16,069
<i>Contaminated stuff.</i>

576
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:18,971
Very dangerous.
Very dangerous.

577
00:33:26,914 --> 00:33:28,847
That was good. That was good. Way to go.

578
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,849
Good. Good.

579
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:32,750
Nothing like male bonding.

580
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:35,319
Come on, wait wait.
OK OK OK,

581
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:37,988
so we had a little
professional misunderstanding.

582
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,522
A professional misunderstanding!

583
00:33:39,524 --> 00:33:41,090
You made me look like a complete idiot.

584
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:43,926
You totally disregarded
my expertise, doctor.

585
00:33:43,928 --> 00:33:45,961
- I got it.
- I got the door. I got the door.

586
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:48,263
I got it.

587
00:33:48,265 --> 00:33:49,597
Come on, I'm not gonna bite you.

588
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,532
What are you doing here in psych, anyway?

589
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:53,033
What's your name?

590
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:56,102
Denise, take this, take this, quick.
It's killing me.

591
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:58,104
They didn't have potato salad. I'm sorry.

592
00:33:58,106 --> 00:33:59,972
- Diana.
- Dr. walton.

593
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:01,807
Look, Dr. walton,

594
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:04,009
I don't know what kind
of expertise you have...

595
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:05,710
I ran a
substance-abuse center.

596
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,344
Isn't that good enough for you, doctor?

597
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,946
- Substance abuse?
- Yes, would you get the door, please?

598
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,082
Sure. Of course.
Well, that's great.

599
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,950
But how... how much
moonlighting have you done?

600
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:14,984
What?

601
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,885
How many emergency rooms have you been in

602
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:19,988
at 3:30 in the morning with
some zonked out guy on p.C.P.,

603
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,322
coming at you with a broken bottle?

604
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:23,390
What difference does that make?

605
00:34:23,392 --> 00:34:24,924
You almost killed that guy today.

606
00:34:24,926 --> 00:34:26,992
Stop it.
"Killed him."

607
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:28,426
I stunned him for a couple seconds.

608
00:34:28,428 --> 00:34:29,794
You must be quite a surgeon.

609
00:34:29,796 --> 00:34:31,996
What do you use as an
anesthetic, the electric chair?

610
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:35,832
Don't you think that we should
at least work this out?

611
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:38,768
As a matter of professional courtesy?

612
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,670
Professional courtesy, like, "don't
move, or I'll nail you to the floor"?

613
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:43,505
I said, "staple your ass
to the ground."

614
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:44,906
Don't get dramatic.

615
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,774
Let me pass, doctor.

616
00:34:46,776 --> 00:34:48,909
Thank you.

617
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:50,677
This is nice.

618
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,279
Maybe we should go somewhere
and work this out,

619
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:55,247
deal with this attraction.

620
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:57,349
They broke into my lab again last night,

621
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:58,750
stole all my pacemakers.

622
00:34:58,752 --> 00:35:00,084
We know all about it, doctor.

623
00:35:00,086 --> 00:35:01,318
I have a snow monkey

624
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,120
that's been waiting three
months for a valve transplant.

625
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:06,622
My chimps are becoming flaming neurotics.

626
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,190
They were seen.

627
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:10,992
The thieves were wearing
surgical masks and gowns.

628
00:35:10,994 --> 00:35:13,461
- We know who it was.
- Sturgess.

629
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:15,162
Really?

630
00:35:15,164 --> 00:35:16,696
Was there
a positive i.D.?

631
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,497
No.

632
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,765
We've tried everything. We've
tried threats, suspension.

633
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:22,366
They're not gonna testify against him.

634
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:24,968
Until somebody does, we don't
have a case, do we, Leo?

635
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,003
Without a positive identification,

636
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:29,705
I can't take him in front of a
medical review board, can I?

637
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:32,107
His luck won't last forever.

638
00:35:39,981 --> 00:35:41,613
OK 'tern, let's hustle.

639
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:44,148
You got Abrams in two and a
staff meeting in half an hour.

640
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,017
Let's get it up and get it moving!

641
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:51,621
What a bitch.

642
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:53,823
Mr. Abrams?

643
00:35:53,825 --> 00:35:55,024
<i>Yeah?</i>

644
00:35:55,026 --> 00:35:56,959
Good morning.

645
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:59,394
My name is Dr. Morgan.
I'm here to examine you.

646
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:01,896
It's a waste of time, kid.

647
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:03,564
I've been examined more times

648
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:05,065
than you got wrinkles on your nuts.

649
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:06,633
Well, I can't seem to find your files,

650
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:07,967
so why don't you put that down there.

651
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:10,069
Let's just open up your shirt.

652
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:12,538
Jesus.

653
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,840
Why don't you tell me if this hurts.

654
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,141
Yeah, it hurts.
It hurts.

655
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:18,743
- No, I'm kidding.
- Let's sit you up here.

656
00:36:18,745 --> 00:36:21,512
Why don't you go find me a real doctor?
He'll know what to do.

657
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:23,680
You're still wet behind the ears.

658
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,982
Mr. Abrams,
I am a real doctor.

659
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,583
Yeah?

660
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,117
How come you don't know shit?

661
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,754
Peter? Peter!

662
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:36,256
Come here.
Peter, that's a gomer.

663
00:36:36,258 --> 00:36:38,391
We don't treat gomers.
Didn't anybody tell you that?

664
00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:40,025
What's a gomer?

665
00:36:40,027 --> 00:36:43,028
That's short for "get that mummy
out of my examination room."

666
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,363
Didn't they teach you nothin'
in medical school, 'tern?

667
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:47,665
Don't forget that c.B.C.
On richetti, okay?

668
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:49,166
- <i>Do I ever?</i>
- Come on, let's go.

669
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,001
Wait a second. What do you
want me to do with him?

670
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:52,335
We gotta wrap him up and turf him out.
Let's go. Let's go.

671
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:55,004
Hey, wait a second, wait a second.

672
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:56,071
What do you mean?
We're not treating him?

673
00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:58,039
Listen,

674
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,841
the treatment they
authorize, he doesn't need.

675
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,876
They won't authorize
the treatment that he does,

676
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:05,845
so the idea is to keep him
here until they finally do.

677
00:37:05,847 --> 00:37:07,947
- You understand?
- OK, fine.

678
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:09,615
Where do I turf him?

679
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:11,516
Podiatry. Neurology.
What's the difference?

680
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:13,951
Just as long as you get him out of there.
We need that bed.

681
00:37:13,953 --> 00:37:15,719
Look, we don't do this
because we like it.

682
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:18,421
If we keep him moving,
he won't be discharged,

683
00:37:18,423 --> 00:37:20,423
then he won't die in some
rooming house somewhere.

684
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:21,891
You can't turf him forever.

685
00:37:21,893 --> 00:37:24,460
Eventually, he's just
gonna come right back to us.

686
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,962
That's why it's gonna take all
your skill as a physician

687
00:37:26,964 --> 00:37:29,130
to make sure he doesn't get
back before the weekend.

688
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:30,731
This guy doesn't even have any records.

689
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,566
<i>If he had records, then
we'd have to treat him.</i>

690
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:34,634
<i>They don't want us to do that.</i>

691
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:37,870
Listen, as far as this hospital is
concerned, gomers do not exist.

692
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:40,038
If they did, the whole
system would break down.

693
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,407
<i>All right, don't try to figure it out.</i>

694
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:44,876
<i>When you have any doubts,
just turf the patient.</i>

695
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:46,577
All right, and don't worry about it.

696
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:48,245
We all had to go
through this at one time.

697
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:52,048
We all did it.
It's okay. Just do it.

698
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:57,953
<i>- Learn anything,
- kid?</i>

699
00:37:57,955 --> 00:38:00,822
I think.

700
00:38:00,824 --> 00:38:01,989
Don't think.

701
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:03,790
That's dangerous.
It's very dangerous.

702
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:05,658
Only gets you into deeper trouble.

703
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,428
Gastro is our best bet, believe me.

704
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,997
Order a g.I. Series.

705
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,099
Dr. sturgess
said you wanted me.

706
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:16,300
Yes.

707
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:21,804
I need to order a complete
workup for Mr. Abrams.

708
00:38:21,806 --> 00:38:25,274
I need to order
a g.I. Series. Now.

709
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:27,109
See you later, Vicky.

710
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:30,579
<i>See you, handsome.</i>

711
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,120
<i>Morning.</i>

712
00:38:39,122 --> 00:38:42,156
<i>As most of you know, one of our
most important research facilities</i>

713
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:44,491
<i>was broken into this morning.</i>

714
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:48,294
What some people refer to
as a "midnight requisition"

715
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:52,097
is, in fact, a serious
violation of federal law.

716
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:54,532
<i>Also,</i>

717
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:56,500
<i>as I went through
the corridors this morning,</i>

718
00:38:56,502 --> 00:39:00,003
<i>I counted numerous violations
of this hospital's dress code.</i>

719
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,539
Your appearance says everything
about this hospital.

720
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:11,045
Chinese.

721
00:39:13,115 --> 00:39:15,715
<i>If we may continue?</i>

722
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:17,883
Excuse me.

723
00:39:17,885 --> 00:39:21,152
<i>Sacrifices are being made in
every government department,</i>

724
00:39:21,154 --> 00:39:24,722
<i>including crucial areas
of defense spending.</i>

725
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:26,990
This is a critical period
in our nation's history

726
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:29,525
and we're asking all of you
for your cooperation.

727
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:32,528
They wouldn't deliver.

728
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,030
I'd like to share something with you.

729
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:37,032
Would you come out here, please?

730
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,034
Stand here.

731
00:39:40,036 --> 00:39:43,303
I had these items sifted out of disposal.

732
00:39:43,305 --> 00:39:46,839
From this moment on, every
department without exception

733
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:49,341
will account for each item

734
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:51,309
of its supply issue.

735
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:54,745
- What?
- He wants us to count sheets of toilet paper.

736
00:39:54,747 --> 00:39:58,615
Well, you gotta remember, Washington
has a right to know these things.

737
00:40:00,352 --> 00:40:03,586
At the end of each month, a
special inventory will be taken.

738
00:40:03,588 --> 00:40:07,389
This is a blowup of the form and
samples have been passed out.

739
00:40:08,759 --> 00:40:10,859
Any excess above the allotted amount

740
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:13,828
will be deducted from your
department's operating budget.

741
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,929
I have a question for you.

742
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:16,430
I'm sure you do.

743
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:17,931
So, while we're

744
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:20,066
measuring adhesive tape

745
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:21,500
and counting q-tips,

746
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,603
who's gonna take care of the patients?

747
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:26,905
Or do they just get eliminated
from the operating budget

748
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:28,806
along with the other waste?

749
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:33,576
I think we can adjourn.
Thank you.

750
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,381
- OK.
- Peter, how's Travis holding up?

751
00:40:40,383 --> 00:40:42,383
There have been
no more episodes of v-tach

752
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:44,785
and his sinus rhythm has
been normal for 24 hours.

753
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:48,855
<i>- Dr. rothman, 4721.
- Dr. rothman, 4721.</i>

754
00:40:48,857 --> 00:40:50,756
Excuse me,

755
00:40:50,758 --> 00:40:52,090
what are you doing with his records?

756
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:54,559
Arranging for his discharge, doctor,

757
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:55,893
first thing tomorrow morning.

758
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:57,794
This patient cannot be moved.

759
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:59,862
The decision has already been made.

760
00:40:59,864 --> 00:41:02,965
If you have a complaint, why not
take it up with the director?

761
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:08,636
What if we just order a
full medical review?

762
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:10,471
Come on, Rudy, that takes six months.

763
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:12,773
We can't gomer this guy.
He's been discharged already.

764
00:41:12,775 --> 00:41:14,775
He's not leaving this hospital.

765
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:16,810
We'll hide him or something,
but he's not leaving.

766
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:18,578
- Hide him? Hide him where?
- I have a great idea,

767
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,212
a linen closet, supply closet.

768
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:21,947
Laundry room, nobody will ever
look in the laundry room.

769
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:23,315
- Great idea.
- Wait wait. Who's this?

770
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:25,650
Taking Mr. ponzini
down to pathology.

771
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:27,251
<i>Ponzini?</i>

772
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:28,785
<i>- It's one of O'Brian's.
- Casualties.</i>

773
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:30,920
This guy's going up for
"butcher of the year." O'Brian.

774
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:33,055
- He screwed up again?
- Dangerously close

775
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:35,057
<i>to "most kills by a doctor
in a major hospital."</i>

776
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,060
- Boy.
- Bye.

777
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,461
Wait.

778
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,164
Ponzini.

779
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,666
Hello, Mr. forest.

780
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:50,504
The patient was admitted with pain
in the lower thoracic cavity,

781
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:53,273
projectile vomiting,
and viscous steatorrhea.

782
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:55,908
- Dr. Nelson?
- Pulmonary edema.

783
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,376
No.

784
00:41:57,378 --> 00:41:58,944
Dr. fields?

785
00:41:58,946 --> 00:42:02,047
- I'd say a pulmonary embolus.
- No.

786
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:05,717
<i>The patient is suffering from a
superior mesenteric insufficiency,</i>

787
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:08,052
resulting in a loss of blood
to the lower colon,

788
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:09,753
necrosis,

789
00:42:09,755 --> 00:42:11,755
and a steatorrheic stool.

790
00:42:11,757 --> 00:42:13,690
That happens to be correct.

791
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:16,626
Yes, I know.

792
00:42:16,628 --> 00:42:18,628
Did you have a nice weekend?

793
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,895
Good.

794
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:23,398
You sent a gomer up to gastro.
He never arrived.

795
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,299
Better get your ass in gear and find him.

796
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:27,734
Just one goddamn minute, nurse.
I am a doctor...

797
00:42:27,736 --> 00:42:29,068
You ain't gonna be here long enough

798
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,936
to "just-one-goddamn-minute"
me, 'tern.

799
00:42:30,938 --> 00:42:34,939
When you and all them
other trainees is long gone,

800
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:37,041
I will still be standing right here,

801
00:42:37,043 --> 00:42:39,276
on this floor, in these shoes.

802
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:40,810
And don't you forget it!

803
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:44,981
No calls.

804
00:42:52,254 --> 00:42:54,621
That was quite a performance
this morning.

805
00:42:54,623 --> 00:42:56,956
You never get tired of trying to ridicule

806
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:59,091
the administration
of this hospital, do you?

807
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:01,059
Which is difficult to understand,

808
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:02,794
considering someone with your record.

809
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:05,129
My record?

810
00:43:06,098 --> 00:43:07,897
What record are you talking about?

811
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:10,399
You've managed to amass quite
a list of accomplishments

812
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:12,734
in the five years I've been here.

813
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:15,103
Forgery of unauthorized requisitions.

814
00:43:15,105 --> 00:43:17,572
I thought it'd be good
to start using anesthesia

815
00:43:17,574 --> 00:43:19,240
during operations, don't you?

816
00:43:19,242 --> 00:43:22,643
Ineligible patients treated
with unauthorized procedures

817
00:43:22,645 --> 00:43:24,611
against express orders to the contrary.

818
00:43:24,613 --> 00:43:28,147
Defying administrative
directives and staff bulletins.

819
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:31,650
"Defying staff bulletins."
Now we're getting serious?

820
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:33,918
You don't know how serious.

821
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,687
<i>Any one of these charges
could finish you in medicine.</i>

822
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:38,455
If you could prove them.

823
00:43:38,457 --> 00:43:41,658
Why do you refuse to accept reality?

824
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,860
<i>I have directives to follow.</i>

825
00:43:43,862 --> 00:43:47,029
You not only follow them, you
go them one better, don't you?

826
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:49,998
I operate this hospital in the
best interest of our patients,

827
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,367
not some hotshot doctor
with an ego problem.

828
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:55,470
This hospital operates your own.

829
00:43:55,472 --> 00:43:57,371
Personally, I think you're a disgrace

830
00:43:57,373 --> 00:43:59,172
to the profession of medicine,

831
00:43:59,174 --> 00:44:01,474
and a detriment to the running
of this hospital.

832
00:44:01,476 --> 00:44:03,876
If the regulations hadn't been made

833
00:44:03,878 --> 00:44:07,713
to protect fools and incompetents like
you, I'd have fired you long ago.

834
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:10,382
You know, I want you to know
what an inspiration you are.

835
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:12,984
You'll never know how many
times I said to myself,

836
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:15,519
"quit. Go into
private practice.

837
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:18,688
"I don't need this shit." But
you always change my mind.

838
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,990
See, you're not just another bureaucrat

839
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,826
using these poor bastards to wriggle
your little ass up the ladder.

840
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,461
You're a whole new species.

841
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,864
<i>See, you actually think you're
doing a service for this country</i>

842
00:44:29,866 --> 00:44:32,833
<i>every time you refuse one
of these guys an operation.</i>

843
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:36,970
You think the priorities are cutting
the budget and trimming costs,

844
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:39,572
instead of easing
the suffering and the anxiety

845
00:44:39,574 --> 00:44:42,540
of the people that
this place was built for.

846
00:44:43,876 --> 00:44:45,375
<i>You know what the most amazing thing is?</i>

847
00:44:45,377 --> 00:44:49,145
You don't even know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

848
00:44:52,016 --> 00:44:54,549
Washington.

849
00:45:05,928 --> 00:45:07,227
Excuse me.

850
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:09,829
Excuse me.

851
00:45:09,831 --> 00:45:11,831
I'm looking for one of my patients.

852
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,333
I can't seem to find him.

853
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:14,834
I think he might have been
transferred here by mistake.

854
00:45:14,836 --> 00:45:16,769
His name is Abrams.
He's a gomer.

855
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:19,037
Check inside, they're all in there.

856
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:20,304
Thank you.

857
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:26,175
Mr. Abrams?
Mr...

858
00:45:40,857 --> 00:45:43,791
My god.

859
00:45:53,068 --> 00:45:55,467
There must be some kind of mistake here.

860
00:45:57,904 --> 00:45:59,970
What's in the bag,
Mr. Thomas?

861
00:45:59,972 --> 00:46:02,472
Hey, Randy, where are you going?

862
00:46:02,474 --> 00:46:05,475
<i>Doctor. Doctor.</i>
What? What?

863
00:46:05,477 --> 00:46:07,376
They're all being discharged.

864
00:46:07,378 --> 00:46:10,045
Mr. tenabe's
on the list.

865
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:17,985
Yes, Dr. walton
in psychiatric.

866
00:46:17,987 --> 00:46:19,987
I need to speak to the chief immediately.

867
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:22,723
My patients are being discharged
without authorization and...

868
00:46:22,725 --> 00:46:25,125
she hung up on me.

869
00:46:25,127 --> 00:46:27,260
<i>Diana? Diana?</i>

870
00:46:27,262 --> 00:46:29,962
Welcome to general hospital
where each day we demonstrate

871
00:46:29,964 --> 00:46:32,164
how much easier it is to run
a hospital without patients.

872
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:34,833
I don't need any of your
fucking jokes right now.

873
00:46:36,236 --> 00:46:37,602
<i>What are you doing here, doctor?</i>

874
00:46:37,604 --> 00:46:39,437
I've come to give you a few lessons

875
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:41,806
in Dr. sturgess's course
on basic survival.

876
00:46:41,808 --> 00:46:44,742
Do you always talk like a complete idiot?

877
00:46:44,744 --> 00:46:46,443
Look at this.

878
00:46:46,445 --> 00:46:48,611
My patients can't survive on the outside.

879
00:46:48,613 --> 00:46:50,613
You've got to turf them out.

880
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:52,948
I can't turf them.
It's against regulations.

881
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,416
<i>Dr. walton,</i>

882
00:46:54,418 --> 00:46:56,117
<i>do you want your patients in here,</i>

883
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:59,153
<i>or do you want them out on the street?</i>

884
00:46:59,155 --> 00:47:00,687
Well, what do you think?

885
00:47:00,689 --> 00:47:02,689
<i>Either you screw the regulations,</i>

886
00:47:02,691 --> 00:47:04,924
<i>or these regulations are gonna screw you.</i>

887
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:07,359
You don't have much time.

888
00:47:07,361 --> 00:47:10,762
Here.
Turf 'em.

889
00:47:20,373 --> 00:47:23,507
<i>Nurse daoust, 614.</i>

890
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:24,808
<i>Nurse daoust.</i>

891
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,976
- Who's in there?
- Mr. ponzini.

892
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:28,510
- Ponzini?
- Yes, ma'am.

893
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:32,280
Mr. ponzini died
two days ago, you idiot!

894
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,882
What is he doing in there?
Why wasn't he removed?

895
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:38,318
I'm gonna check into that
right away, ma'am.

896
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,521
Incompetence!

897
00:47:42,857 --> 00:47:46,691
My god!

898
00:47:48,728 --> 00:47:50,060
Mayday!

899
00:47:50,062 --> 00:47:52,796
- <i>Mayday! Ponzini! Mayday!</i>
- Let's go.

900
00:47:52,798 --> 00:47:54,564
Nurse white!

901
00:47:54,566 --> 00:47:56,299
Where are you, nurse white?

902
00:47:56,301 --> 00:47:59,035
Get out of my way.
Get out of my way!

903
00:47:59,037 --> 00:48:01,037
Hand me those patient charts.

904
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:02,905
I want Mr. ponzini's
records.

905
00:48:02,907 --> 00:48:05,307
Mr. ponzini.

906
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:07,842
Well, where is he?
Where is it then?

907
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:10,077
Where is his chart?
That is not Mr. ponzini!

908
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,845
Where is he?
What room?

909
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,080
<i>Room 543.
Why is there...</i>

910
00:48:14,082 --> 00:48:16,982
<i>- The patient in 543 has been.
- Transferred to pathology.</i>

911
00:48:16,984 --> 00:48:18,516
<i>He is alive!</i>

912
00:48:18,518 --> 00:48:20,484
Come with me!
Come with me!

913
00:48:20,486 --> 00:48:22,752
When I find out who's
responsible for this,

914
00:48:22,754 --> 00:48:24,487
it will be their last day
in this hospital!

915
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:26,655
Will you please get out of the way?

916
00:48:26,657 --> 00:48:28,990
I'm telling you, I saw
him transferred myself.

917
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:31,359
He is alive!
Now...

918
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:34,929
You tell me this man is dead.

919
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:36,830
Well,

920
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:38,598
he ain't gonna be needing his lunch.

921
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:43,736
There we go.

922
00:48:46,941 --> 00:48:48,774
Good.

923
00:48:48,776 --> 00:48:51,843
Okay, there we go.

924
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:55,946
Okay, Mr. paithe. On your
back for four hours, please.

925
00:48:55,948 --> 00:48:57,547
It was good.

926
00:48:57,549 --> 00:48:59,215
Nice needlework, nice and clean.

927
00:48:59,217 --> 00:49:02,017
You'll be taking over for me pretty soon?

928
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:03,785
Yeah.

929
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:12,359
Hey, wait a second.
I gotta talk to you.

930
00:49:12,361 --> 00:49:13,760
What is it?

931
00:49:13,762 --> 00:49:15,061
Do you have a problem with me?

932
00:49:15,063 --> 00:49:16,529
Is it my work or something?

933
00:49:16,531 --> 00:49:19,231
No. I think you'll make
a very good doctor.

934
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:21,800
I was wondering maybe... maybe
we could have a cup of coffee

935
00:49:21,802 --> 00:49:24,903
- or something sometime.
- I don't think so.

936
00:49:24,905 --> 00:49:26,571
Why is it every time you look at me,

937
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:28,873
you like as though I've got
something you're afraid to catch?

938
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:31,275
I could never catch what you've got.

939
00:49:31,277 --> 00:49:33,844
Well, maybe it's just what you need.

940
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,082
Look,

941
00:49:40,084 --> 00:49:42,784
I've seen hotshots like you come and go,

942
00:49:42,786 --> 00:49:46,954
with your frat-house grins and your
option on a suite of fancy offices.

943
00:49:46,956 --> 00:49:49,122
All you have to do is stop by
here for a couple of years,

944
00:49:49,124 --> 00:49:51,290
and practice up on some
poor beaten-down bastards

945
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:54,192
who can't go to a malpractice
attorney every time you screw up.

946
00:49:56,129 --> 00:50:00,264
Have you ever bothered to take a
real look at the men in these rooms,

947
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:02,933
or stop to figure out
what's really going on here?

948
00:50:02,935 --> 00:50:05,735
Or am I stupid to think it could
possibly matter to someone like you?

949
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:07,970
Look, I don't know who
you've got me confused with,

950
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,771
but you sure as hell
aren't talking about me.

951
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,274
I'd appreciate if you
stopped giving me this shit.

952
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:15,443
Thanks. I'll remember
not to do it again.

953
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,947
<i>Bad day, kid?</i>

954
00:50:19,949 --> 00:50:22,716
Mr. Abrams?

955
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:26,386
What are you doing here? I've
been looking all over for you.

956
00:50:26,388 --> 00:50:29,856
Idiots made a mistake.
They sent me to urology.

957
00:50:29,858 --> 00:50:32,158
I've been peeing my brains out.

958
00:50:33,794 --> 00:50:36,261
This place is so screwed up.

959
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:38,730
It's like a war going on in there.

960
00:50:38,732 --> 00:50:40,465
War...

961
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:42,967
Tell me about it, kid.

962
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:45,703
You know where
I was on d-day?

963
00:50:45,705 --> 00:50:47,204
Where?

964
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:48,405
<i>Omaha beach.</i>

965
00:50:48,407 --> 00:50:51,207
That was the biggest
screw-up in history.

966
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:53,142
<i>Let me tell you a secret, kid.</i>

967
00:50:53,144 --> 00:50:54,910
I was so scared,

968
00:50:54,912 --> 00:50:57,279
I took a dump in my pants.

969
00:50:57,281 --> 00:50:59,914
That plus two bullets through my helmet,

970
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:02,049
I lost half my platoon.

971
00:51:02,051 --> 00:51:04,051
By the time we made it off that beach,

972
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:07,654
<i>I had a medal stuck on my chest and
my face was in "stars and stripes."</i>

973
00:51:07,656 --> 00:51:11,057
Now somehow I made it through,
and you will too.

974
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:14,326
I don't think so.

975
00:51:14,328 --> 00:51:16,761
Doctors, I've seen them come and go.

976
00:51:16,763 --> 00:51:18,829
You've got the stuff.
You'll make it, kid.

977
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:21,965
Hey, I've been looking for you.
What are your orders, doctor?

978
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:23,766
Why don't you give us a second?

979
00:51:23,768 --> 00:51:25,234
I'll be at the desk.

980
00:51:25,236 --> 00:51:26,969
What the hell am I gonna do?

981
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:30,405
Your best bet is screw up a lumbar
puncture and shoot me down to ortho.

982
00:51:30,407 --> 00:51:32,073
That should be good for two weeks.

983
00:51:32,075 --> 00:51:33,240
No, I can't do that.

984
00:51:33,242 --> 00:51:35,075
Don't get excited, kid.

985
00:51:35,077 --> 00:51:38,945
Use the Alzheimer's scam.
It's foolproof.

986
00:51:38,947 --> 00:51:40,846
<i>I'm gonna send him up to neurology.</i>

987
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,981
Cat scan.
Suspected a-l-z.

988
00:51:42,983 --> 00:51:45,016
You got it.

989
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:48,985
Who are you? I don't know who you are.
What floor is this?

990
00:51:48,987 --> 00:51:51,420
<i>Take care of him, okay?</i>

991
00:51:51,422 --> 00:51:53,522
<i>Dr. Carter, O.R. three.</i>

992
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:55,323
<i>Dr. Carter, O.R. three.</i>

993
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:57,191
Forget it.
No way.

994
00:51:57,193 --> 00:51:59,259
Look, I'm not moving until you admit him.

995
00:51:59,261 --> 00:52:01,761
I'm telling you we're full up.
Turf him somewhere else.

996
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:04,930
- There is nowhere else.
- That's not my problem.

997
00:52:04,932 --> 00:52:07,098
Have you looked at his chart?
Have you even checked his chart?

998
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,834
Do you think you're the first doctor
to ever turf somebody around here?

999
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:11,535
Who told you we had a free bed?

1000
00:52:11,537 --> 00:52:13,937
I did.

1001
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,106
<i>Nurse,</i>

1002
00:52:17,108 --> 00:52:20,042
<i>put the patient in 214.</i>

1003
00:52:20,044 --> 00:52:21,877
<i>Dr. walton...</i>
You owe me, buddy.

1004
00:52:21,879 --> 00:52:24,045
Thank you.

1005
00:52:25,982 --> 00:52:29,283
All right, you know this is
just temporary, Mr. tenabe.

1006
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:32,986
And I'm going to come by and see you
every couple of hours, whenever I can.

1007
00:52:32,988 --> 00:52:36,289
I'm gonna come back around
2:00 and check on...

1008
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:39,025
You don't have to... to hold him.
He can just walk.

1009
00:52:39,027 --> 00:52:41,327
<i>Dr. walton,
report to radiology.</i>

1010
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:44,897
Give him a milligram
of morphine and an E.K.G.

1011
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:47,866
Sturg, we got trouble in turf city.

1012
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:51,702
Get me out of here!

1013
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:54,004
No no no!
No needles!

1014
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:55,338
Get away.
Get away from him.

1015
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,839
They want to hurt me!

1016
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,307
No no no. We're not
gonna hurt you.

1017
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,475
It's the only way to keep
you in the hospital, frank.

1018
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:03,211
If they don't perform the X-ray,
I'll have to discharge you

1019
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,179
and they'll send you back.
Do you want that?

1020
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,080
- No.
- Okay okay. Now, frank,

1021
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:09,582
what you're gonna do you're gonna
put your hands by your side.

1022
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:12,224
Kathleen, Kathleen, get in here!
Kathleen's gonna take care of you.

1023
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:17,455
Guys, do it quick. Do it quick.

1024
00:53:19,725 --> 00:53:21,858
I'm right here, frank.

1025
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,993
<i>Your arms at your side.</i>

1026
00:53:23,995 --> 00:53:26,028
<i>Take a deep breath</i>

1027
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,863
<i>and hold it.</i>

1028
00:53:27,865 --> 00:53:31,333
You look like you could use a drink.

1029
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:32,867
I can't leave the hospital.

1030
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:36,270
Who said you have to leave the hospital?

1031
00:53:41,076 --> 00:53:43,576
Sorry, there's no ice.

1032
00:53:43,578 --> 00:53:45,511
No problem.

1033
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:48,146
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1034
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,387
I liked the way that
you handled that patient.

1035
00:53:57,389 --> 00:53:59,021
Look, ma, no defibrillators.

1036
00:54:03,126 --> 00:54:05,459
- So you left substance abuse for this?
- Yeah.

1037
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:06,893
How come?

1038
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:09,395
I just got tired

1039
00:54:09,397 --> 00:54:11,196
of those
six-figure executives

1040
00:54:11,198 --> 00:54:13,431
bitching about what a bummer life is.

1041
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:16,867
I thought I would come down here and
see what the real world was like.

1042
00:54:16,869 --> 00:54:18,869
You found out.

1043
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:21,605
Big time.

1044
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:23,607
- At least you're over the hard part, though.
- <i>You think?</i>

1045
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:25,976
- Yeah.
- I hope so.

1046
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:34,315
That's good.

1047
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:38,617
I think what you need is another drink.

1048
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,119
I think what I need is to get laid.

1049
00:54:44,556 --> 00:54:46,055
Excuse me?

1050
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:49,591
You don't have a hearing problem, do you?

1051
00:54:49,593 --> 00:54:51,325
No.

1052
00:54:54,129 --> 00:54:55,661
I'm sorry.

1053
00:54:55,663 --> 00:54:57,295
Did I get the wrong impression?

1054
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:03,533
No no no.

1055
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:07,936
It just isn't exactly the way I...

1056
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:10,004
What I expected
is... is all.

1057
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:14,007
You expected...

1058
00:55:15,176 --> 00:55:16,875
What?

1059
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:21,145
More romance?

1060
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:24,047
Shall I go out and get
a candle or something?

1061
00:55:28,186 --> 00:55:29,919
No.
May i...?

1062
00:55:35,158 --> 00:55:37,358
I got a candle.

1063
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:41,994
I was hoping for something
a little larger.

1064
00:55:49,668 --> 00:55:52,001
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!

1065
00:55:52,003 --> 00:55:54,336
Go ahead and walk that
walk, girl, but listen,

1066
00:55:54,338 --> 00:55:56,504
I hear they got teddies on
sale down at j.C. Penney.

1067
00:55:56,506 --> 00:55:58,105
Red lace. Eat your
heart out, Luther.

1068
00:55:58,107 --> 00:56:00,807
<i>Listen, don't you hurt nobody!</i>

1069
00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:02,642
Good morning,
Mrs. mcguinnes.

1070
00:56:02,644 --> 00:56:04,777
My name is Maggie.
Nurse Jones is off today,

1071
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:07,880
so I'm gonna be giving you your
bath before surgery. Okay, Loretta?

1072
00:56:07,882 --> 00:56:10,115
You don't mind if I call
you Loretta, do you?

1073
00:56:14,887 --> 00:56:16,620
Shit!

1074
00:56:16,622 --> 00:56:17,887
That's why you like me, baby.

1075
00:56:17,889 --> 00:56:19,889
The shit is steaming.

1076
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:23,792
Yes yes. Mrs. mcguinnes in 345.
What about her?

1077
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:26,561
What?
I'll be right there.

1078
00:56:38,407 --> 00:56:39,672
- Rudy!
- What?

1079
00:56:39,674 --> 00:56:40,839
Mayday! Mayday!

1080
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:42,407
Quick!

1081
00:56:43,476 --> 00:56:44,741
Sid!

1082
00:56:44,743 --> 00:56:46,542
Mayday!
This is it!

1083
00:56:46,544 --> 00:56:48,710
- Mayday.
- Let's go. Come on.

1084
00:56:48,712 --> 00:56:50,411
You got it.

1085
00:56:54,483 --> 00:56:56,716
There he is.

1086
00:56:56,718 --> 00:56:58,951
- Travis.
- How you doing?

1087
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:03,855
- Now, wait a minute, baby.
- Get out of my way, Luther.

1088
00:57:03,857 --> 00:57:06,023
- Hold on. I got a complaint.
- And I've got an emergency!

1089
00:57:06,025 --> 00:57:08,225
You're not going anywhere until
you listen to what I have to say.

1090
00:57:08,227 --> 00:57:10,827
I am ordering you to get out of my way!

1091
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:12,595
Damn, I love that
come-get-me look

1092
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:14,196
you get in your eye when you get mad.

1093
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:15,997
- Cut out the crap, Luther!
- No!

1094
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,867
Put me down!
Luther!

1095
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:21,669
I live to rocket down these halls.

1096
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,037
Let's go!

1097
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,339
Stop or I'll call an orderly!

1098
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,841
Bring that patient back here immediately!

1099
00:57:27,843 --> 00:57:30,276
Put me down, Luther!

1100
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:38,049
I don't know, I just...

1101
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:40,151
Hello,
Dr. walton.

1102
00:57:40,153 --> 00:57:42,386
I'll talk to you later.

1103
00:57:42,388 --> 00:57:45,188
Okay.

1104
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,323
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

1105
00:57:47,325 --> 00:57:49,491
Good. How did you sleep last night?

1106
00:57:49,493 --> 00:57:51,526
- Good.
- Speaking of great.

1107
00:57:51,528 --> 00:57:54,228
Fine.

1108
00:57:57,132 --> 00:58:00,666
Was last night, like, just good therapy,

1109
00:58:00,668 --> 00:58:03,335
or was it something else?

1110
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:06,504
Because if it was something
else, I really think

1111
00:58:06,506 --> 00:58:08,239
that we should maybe
consider adjoining offices...

1112
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:10,441
I gotta go.
Thanks for these.

1113
00:58:11,911 --> 00:58:15,045
Diana, wait a second.
Wait a second.

1114
00:58:15,047 --> 00:58:17,247
You didn't answer me.
Don't just walk away.

1115
00:58:17,249 --> 00:58:19,148
Look,

1116
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,017
we were both pretty
stressed out last night.

1117
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:23,918
We needed some...

1118
00:58:25,755 --> 00:58:28,155
Human contact. But I think, from now on,

1119
00:58:28,157 --> 00:58:31,457
I'd prefer to keep our relationship
on a professional footing.

1120
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:35,227
Excuse me,<i> Dr.</i> walton?

1121
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:41,498
Hi.

1122
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,200
Excuse me. Do you mind, we're in
the middle of a consultation.

1123
00:58:44,202 --> 00:58:45,668
What're you doing?
What are you doing?

1124
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,670
This is ridiculous. What
do you think you're doing?

1125
00:58:47,672 --> 00:58:49,938
Listen, I hate to tell the lady
that she's bullshitting herself,

1126
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,873
- but you're bullshitting yourself.
- Really?

1127
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:55,176
If all you needed was human contact, then
you could have gone to an a.A. Meeting.

1128
00:58:55,178 --> 00:58:58,077
We had a lot more than just contact.
Come here.

1129
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:14,724
<i>- You know, when I first.
- Went in the army,</i>

1130
00:59:14,726 --> 00:59:16,092
<i>none of the uniforms fit.</i>

1131
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,761
So I... I went to a tailor.
A good tailor.

1132
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,463
He cut it so I had
a pinched-in waist.

1133
00:59:21,465 --> 00:59:23,965
All the girls went
crazy over me, I'll tell ya.

1134
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:26,233
Anyway, this is my album,

1135
00:59:26,235 --> 00:59:30,303
and the first picture
in the album is a horse.

1136
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:33,406
I don't ride, but it's
just that I love horses.

1137
00:59:33,408 --> 00:59:36,075
This is

1138
00:59:36,077 --> 00:59:38,077
when we first landed in north Africa.

1139
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,446
It was dirty, hot, Sandy.

1140
00:59:40,448 --> 00:59:42,714
I had a desk job then.

1141
00:59:42,716 --> 00:59:44,982
I even started smoking a pipe

1142
00:59:44,984 --> 00:59:48,218
because I thought it'd make
me look more distinguished.

1143
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,086
Schmuck.

1144
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:51,253
Heh.

1145
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:52,988
We traveled a lot and...

1146
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:56,091
Now this one.

1147
00:59:56,093 --> 01:00:00,128
This is when we first liberated
a little town in France.

1148
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,130
They billeted me with a Baker.

1149
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,733
Guess what you smelled in this house.

1150
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:08,134
- Bread.
- Bread.

1151
01:00:08,136 --> 01:00:09,969
Bread all over the damn place.

1152
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:13,172
I tell ya, I woke up in the morning
with the smell of bread...

1153
01:00:14,942 --> 01:00:16,841
He had this gorgeous daughter.

1154
01:00:16,843 --> 01:00:20,677
She baked the most fantastic croissants.

1155
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:23,479
What a piece of ass.

1156
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:25,013
What happened?

1157
01:00:25,015 --> 01:00:28,249
I married her.
That's what happened.

1158
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:30,517
<i>Where is she now?</i>

1159
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:33,253
She died about 10 years ago.

1160
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:39,425
I'm... I'm sorry.

1161
01:00:43,197 --> 01:00:45,330
Let's see what else we got.

1162
01:00:47,634 --> 01:00:49,500
I like this.

1163
01:00:49,502 --> 01:00:51,168
<i>That's my old army hat.</i>

1164
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:53,170
Where did you come up
with all this stuff?

1165
01:00:53,172 --> 01:00:55,038
<i>Patient's effects.</i>

1166
01:01:04,615 --> 01:01:06,881
It's a silver star, isn't it?

1167
01:01:15,658 --> 01:01:18,258
I was kinda worried about you, kid.

1168
01:01:20,996 --> 01:01:23,196
But you're OK.

1169
01:01:23,198 --> 01:01:27,132
<i>Dr. Morgan, report
to the director's office.</i>

1170
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:29,801
<i>Dr. Morgan.</i>

1171
01:01:35,908 --> 01:01:38,308
<i>- That's right.
- A whole new shipment.</i>

1172
01:01:40,545 --> 01:01:42,378
A complete cardiac unit.

1173
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,214
<i>Enough for at least
10 surgical procedures.</i>

1174
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:47,182
<i>Wait, just a moment.</i>

1175
01:01:47,184 --> 01:01:49,083
Who's out there?

1176
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:51,051
<i>Dr. Morgan, sir.</i>

1177
01:01:51,053 --> 01:01:52,318
Close the door, please.

1178
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,286
Tell Morgan I'll be right with him.

1179
01:01:56,156 --> 01:01:57,655
What? No no.
Of course not.

1180
01:01:57,657 --> 01:02:00,090
I've had it stored in pathology.

1181
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,259
Good.

1182
01:02:09,332 --> 01:02:11,498
Send Dr. Morgan in,
please.

1183
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,271
You wanted to see me?

1184
01:02:20,774 --> 01:02:23,207
<i>Have a seat, doctor.</i>

1185
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:26,210
<i>I see you're settling
into our routine very nicely.</i>

1186
01:02:26,212 --> 01:02:27,744
Thank you.

1187
01:02:30,882 --> 01:02:33,115
What I wanna say is off the record.

1188
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:34,916
There are gonna be

1189
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:37,418
some radical changes
around here very soon.

1190
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,787
I'm putting together a whole new team.

1191
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:43,557
It can be a very big opportunity.

1192
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,693
But before that happens, I'll
be forced to get rid of certain

1193
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:49,529
dysfunctioning elements.

1194
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:52,965
<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

1195
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:55,133
Not exactly.
No.

1196
01:02:55,135 --> 01:02:58,136
I need someone willing
to supply me with evidence

1197
01:02:58,138 --> 01:03:00,905
of all the violations
being committed around here.

1198
01:03:00,907 --> 01:03:02,873
In strictest confidence, of course.

1199
01:03:04,209 --> 01:03:06,342
You expect me to spy for you?

1200
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:09,310
<i>I don't expect anything, doctor.</i>

1201
01:03:09,312 --> 01:03:11,745
Whatever action you take must be because

1202
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:13,947
you feel it's in the best
interests of this hospital.

1203
01:03:13,949 --> 01:03:16,716
<i>I expect you to do what is correct.</i>

1204
01:03:27,993 --> 01:03:29,559
Think it over.

1205
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:32,194
<i>Yes?</i>

1206
01:03:38,401 --> 01:03:40,100
How are you feeling?

1207
01:03:40,102 --> 01:03:43,169
Afraid I'm gonna live, doc.

1208
01:03:44,805 --> 01:03:46,938
- You feel all right?
- I'm good, yeah.

1209
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:49,340
I heard you were racing
around on wheelchairs before.

1210
01:03:49,342 --> 01:03:51,909
Yeah, I want to get in a league.

1211
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,177
The wheelchair league?

1212
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:56,646
<i>Hey, I'm sorry that we had to
put you down here in this room.</i>

1213
01:03:56,648 --> 01:03:58,414
<i>Hell.
Lots of sheets.</i>

1214
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:00,349
<i>Lots of sheets.
A lot of room.</i>

1215
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:02,117
Don't you worry about a thing.

1216
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:04,552
- I'm not going till you go.
- Okay.

1217
01:04:09,592 --> 01:04:12,426
His lungs are full of fluid.
He's had persistent angina.

1218
01:04:12,428 --> 01:04:14,261
I started a nitro drip.

1219
01:04:14,263 --> 01:04:16,496
Without surgery, I don't think
he's going to last another month.

1220
01:04:16,498 --> 01:04:19,031
- Hey, sturg, Robin.
- Hi. Hi, guys.

1221
01:04:19,033 --> 01:04:22,501
You hear that wolin's got a new shipment
for his "bedtime for bonzo" experiments?

1222
01:04:22,503 --> 01:04:24,269
You believe it?
Pathology...

1223
01:04:24,271 --> 01:04:26,804
They put the stuff meant to
save lives in with the corpses.

1224
01:04:26,806 --> 01:04:29,373
Of course, we're never gonna
check inside the stiffs, are we?

1225
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:31,308
Where did you get this information?

1226
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:33,343
Totally unreliable source.

1227
01:04:33,345 --> 01:04:36,379
I believe it.

1228
01:04:36,381 --> 01:04:38,381
Sturg, do we go?

1229
01:04:38,383 --> 01:04:40,116
Do we have a choice?

1230
01:04:41,052 --> 01:04:42,718
Tonight.
Let's do it.

1231
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,454
<i>Hey, sturg.</i>

1232
01:04:45,456 --> 01:04:47,389
<i>Do you know one thing
I hate about pathology?</i>

1233
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:49,357
- What?
- Nobody ever says thank you.

1234
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,225
Yeah, but when was the
last time anyone down here

1235
01:04:51,227 --> 01:04:53,327
brought an action for malpractice?

1236
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:56,563
- It's an interesting point.
- Well, yeah. Very interesting. The only thing is

1237
01:04:56,565 --> 01:04:59,265
a lot of people are down here
as a result of malpractice.

1238
01:05:03,336 --> 01:05:06,203
Come on.

1239
01:05:06,205 --> 01:05:08,972
What's with you two today?

1240
01:05:08,974 --> 01:05:10,673
Nothing.
He's just trying...

1241
01:05:10,675 --> 01:05:12,975
Hey hey.
Stop.

1242
01:05:12,977 --> 01:05:16,811
Gentlemen, check over there...

1243
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,350
- Did you check?
- I checked.

1244
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:25,852
- Nothing in number two.
- Number two.

1245
01:05:25,854 --> 01:05:27,720
It's ponzini.

1246
01:05:33,593 --> 01:05:35,459
This is it.
Pay dirt!

1247
01:05:35,461 --> 01:05:37,527
Sturg, we hit the jackpot.

1248
01:05:37,529 --> 01:05:40,363
Sturg, bring the bag!

1249
01:05:40,365 --> 01:05:42,998
<i>Bring the bag.</i>

1250
01:05:54,611 --> 01:05:56,510
You wanted to see me?

1251
01:05:56,512 --> 01:05:59,713
Yeah. Whose x-rays
are these?

1252
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:01,981
They're Abrams'.

1253
01:06:01,983 --> 01:06:04,116
It's not an option.
Forget it.

1254
01:06:04,118 --> 01:06:05,517
Wait a second, if we can help Travis,

1255
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:07,285
why can't we help Abrams?

1256
01:06:07,287 --> 01:06:09,287
Because I can give Travis 20 more years.

1257
01:06:09,289 --> 01:06:12,123
The only thing I can give
Abrams is this hospital.

1258
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:16,026
So, what, you get to decide
who gets to live and die?

1259
01:06:16,028 --> 01:06:18,861
Anytime you want the job.

1260
01:06:21,198 --> 01:06:22,697
That's bullshit.

1261
01:06:27,469 --> 01:06:30,069
You're right.

1262
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:31,203
<i>Doctor?</i>

1263
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:34,072
The director wants
to see you immediately.

1264
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,546
<i>- You ignored.
- All my warnings</i>

1265
01:06:42,548 --> 01:06:44,247
<i>and now you've taken your
friends down with you.</i>

1266
01:06:44,249 --> 01:06:46,549
<i>Which is too bad,</i>

1267
01:06:46,551 --> 01:06:50,152
<i>considering what promising
careers they might have had.</i>

1268
01:06:50,154 --> 01:06:52,187
<i>They looked up to you.</i>

1269
01:06:52,189 --> 01:06:54,055
<i>You were their hero.</i>

1270
01:06:54,057 --> 01:06:56,891
<i>Let's just cut the bullshit, OK?</i>

1271
01:06:56,893 --> 01:06:58,525
<i>What do you want?</i>

1272
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:01,828
I want you to place yourself
under voluntary suspension.

1273
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,896
How can I do that?

1274
01:07:03,898 --> 01:07:06,498
I have patients I'm taking care of.

1275
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,000
Those are my terms.

1276
01:07:09,002 --> 01:07:11,902
<i>First, I want that tape.</i>

1277
01:07:11,904 --> 01:07:13,937
All right? Then I want
a written agreement

1278
01:07:13,939 --> 01:07:16,172
exempting handleman and bobrick

1279
01:07:16,174 --> 01:07:18,073
from any and all repercussions.

1280
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:26,445
<i>Good.</i>

1281
01:07:26,447 --> 01:07:28,447
<i>One more thing, doctor.</i>

1282
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:30,849
When you go before
the medical review board,

1283
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:33,751
you'll plead guilty to each of
the charges I bring against you.

1284
01:07:33,753 --> 01:07:37,421
<i>Then you may have your tape
and my letter of agreement.</i>

1285
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:48,530
Now why don't you get out?

1286
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:50,632
I got some real doctors to talk to.

1287
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:04,144
- What are you doing?
- Dr. sturgess placed himself on voluntary suspension

1288
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:07,080
as of 12:00 noon today.

1289
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:09,582
Sturg? Sturg?

1290
01:08:09,584 --> 01:08:11,650
<i>What's going on?</i>

1291
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:13,418
<i>Where are you going?</i>

1292
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,720
What, something happened upstairs?
Get something on you or what?

1293
01:08:15,722 --> 01:08:18,923
I just gotta get out of here and
forget this place ever existed.

1294
01:08:18,925 --> 01:08:21,392
Yeah, but what are we gonna tell
the staff and all those interns

1295
01:08:21,394 --> 01:08:23,494
you're turning into doctors
instead of stockbrokers?

1296
01:08:23,496 --> 01:08:25,829
Just tell them to lay low.

1297
01:08:25,831 --> 01:08:27,664
Follow the directives,

1298
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:28,965
you know? Let the guy think he's won.

1299
01:08:28,967 --> 01:08:31,267
Come on, sturg.
That's bullshit.

1300
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:32,901
<i>- Sturg, can I.
- Ask you a question?</i>

1301
01:08:32,903 --> 01:08:34,335
<i>It's always a little foggy to me.</i>

1302
01:08:34,337 --> 01:08:36,003
Let's just play guess your best.

1303
01:08:36,005 --> 01:08:38,171
Tell me if I'm...
Yes, no, maybe-so here.

1304
01:08:38,173 --> 01:08:40,573
So in other words you're gonna
take yourself a little break,

1305
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,074
just walk away from the hospital.

1306
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,809
And they're gonna take a look around,

1307
01:08:43,811 --> 01:08:45,677
see if the coast is clear, no more sturg,

1308
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,145
then they drop their Dukes.

1309
01:08:47,147 --> 01:08:49,147
<i>And then, bingo, you waltz right back in,</i>

1310
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:52,049
<i>and we're back in business?</i>

1311
01:08:54,353 --> 01:08:56,486
They finally got you, doc?

1312
01:08:56,488 --> 01:08:58,754
Look, is there anything we can do?

1313
01:08:59,823 --> 01:09:03,090
No no, it's best to stay out of this one.

1314
01:09:03,092 --> 01:09:04,624
You sure?

1315
01:09:04,626 --> 01:09:06,158
I appreciate it,
though. Thanks.

1316
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,827
You hold down the fort, okay?

1317
01:09:08,829 --> 01:09:10,695
- Okay.
- All right, I'll see you around.

1318
01:09:10,697 --> 01:09:12,930
- Hey, take care?
- Yep.

1319
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,333
Nurse white?
Excuse me.

1320
01:09:18,769 --> 01:09:20,602
I just completed
Mr. Simpson's exam.

1321
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:22,203
He needs these tests run.

1322
01:09:22,205 --> 01:09:23,604
I told you once:

1323
01:09:23,606 --> 01:09:26,440
We don't treat agent orange cases.

1324
01:09:26,442 --> 01:09:29,509
I know, but... - you would know
this if you read your regs.

1325
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:32,278
And your gomer's back.

1326
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:43,355
So what's wrong?

1327
01:09:43,357 --> 01:09:45,790
It's the end of the line, doc.

1328
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:47,725
They got no place else to send me.

1329
01:09:47,727 --> 01:09:50,661
Come on, we can always
run the old a-l-z scam.

1330
01:09:50,663 --> 01:09:54,397
No no. Don't forget,
we pulled that one twice.

1331
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,832
It's time to pull the plug.

1332
01:09:56,834 --> 01:09:59,467
Come on, Sam. Don't talk like that.
It's not funny.

1333
01:09:59,469 --> 01:10:01,402
Come here.

1334
01:10:01,404 --> 01:10:04,538
Why don't we shut off all this crap?

1335
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,873
Only one little air bubble,

1336
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,574
right there
beside the i.V...

1337
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:10,709
Come on, Sam, you know I can't do that.

1338
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:13,478
But nobody's gonna know.
Nobody, doc.

1339
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,147
- I will.
- What the hell's the answer, doc?

1340
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:17,815
<i>You can't do nothing for me.</i>

1341
01:10:17,817 --> 01:10:21,884
<i>I can't go round and round
this hospital forever, can I?</i>

1342
01:10:21,886 --> 01:10:24,753
I'm sick of living
on the i.V.

1343
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:26,654
<i>Mr. Abrams, you're not
going to have to.</i>

1344
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:28,188
We're gonna run some tests...

1345
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,023
<i>I don't want your tests.</i>

1346
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:32,692
I hate those goddamn tests.

1347
01:10:32,694 --> 01:10:36,729
<i>Believe me, this is
better for both of us.</i>

1348
01:10:36,731 --> 01:10:39,897
Here, take this. I got
nobody else to give it to.

1349
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:42,265
Take it.

1350
01:10:42,267 --> 01:10:45,534
Sam, you keep this.

1351
01:10:45,536 --> 01:10:47,869
Look, everything's gonna be all right.

1352
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:51,239
Okay, doc. I'll be all right.
I'll be okay.

1353
01:10:51,241 --> 01:10:53,441
Yeah. Okay.

1354
01:10:53,443 --> 01:10:55,176
Look,

1355
01:10:55,178 --> 01:10:57,611
I'll be back in a minute.
We'll have a chat.

1356
01:10:57,613 --> 01:11:01,514
Right. Right.

1357
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:22,901
- Hey.
- Why did you leave just like that?

1358
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:25,236
Without saying anything?
Why didn't you call me?

1359
01:11:25,238 --> 01:11:27,738
I was gonna call you.

1360
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,740
You got the staff worked up
enough to go out and riot,

1361
01:11:29,742 --> 01:11:33,143
<i>and you're sitting here playing dropout?</i>

1362
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,881
I'm not playing dropout.
I'm burnt out, is what I am.

1363
01:11:38,883 --> 01:11:42,251
That's not good enough. What about all those
people who went out on a limb for you?

1364
01:11:42,253 --> 01:11:44,820
<i>What about your patients?</i>

1365
01:11:44,822 --> 01:11:47,756
And what about Dr. sturgess'
course on basic survival?

1366
01:11:47,758 --> 01:11:49,157
Are you walking out on that too?

1367
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:51,826
Diana, I really don't need this now.

1368
01:11:51,828 --> 01:11:54,595
Yeah, well, what do you need right now?

1369
01:11:54,597 --> 01:11:56,997
You come into my life,
you come tearing into my life,

1370
01:11:56,999 --> 01:11:59,165
you make me give a damn
about what happens to you,

1371
01:11:59,167 --> 01:12:00,799
and then you slam the door in my face.

1372
01:12:00,801 --> 01:12:02,967
I'm not slamming any door.
I'm telling you the truth.

1373
01:12:02,969 --> 01:12:04,802
I don't believe you.
I don't believe

1374
01:12:04,804 --> 01:12:06,603
you ever got close enough to
anybody to tell them the truth.

1375
01:12:06,605 --> 01:12:08,504
I don't need to be analyzed now.
I really don't.

1376
01:12:08,506 --> 01:12:09,905
Is that what you think this is?

1377
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:13,141
If that's what you think
this is... god damn it.

1378
01:12:13,143 --> 01:12:15,309
Wait a minute, Diana.
Wait a minute.

1379
01:12:15,311 --> 01:12:17,911
Look, you can't trust me
enough to tell me the truth.

1380
01:12:17,913 --> 01:12:21,347
Jesus Christ. Let's just
call it quits right now.

1381
01:12:21,349 --> 01:12:23,615
We'll just cut our losses and say adios.

1382
01:12:23,617 --> 01:12:26,084
Goodbye, Dr. sturgess, it
could have been really good.

1383
01:12:26,086 --> 01:12:27,819
- Do you know that?
- No no no, wait a minute.

1384
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:29,921
All right, I need you, OK?

1385
01:12:29,923 --> 01:12:31,822
I need you.

1386
01:12:36,027 --> 01:12:39,028
I really need to talk.

1387
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:54,339
- Nurse?
- What is it?

1388
01:12:54,341 --> 01:12:57,175
I need a favor. I need to turf a
patient down from the 4th floor.

1389
01:12:57,177 --> 01:12:59,043
Is that your patient in bed 7?

1390
01:12:59,045 --> 01:13:01,378
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
- I think he's dead.

1391
01:13:03,148 --> 01:13:04,514
What?

1392
01:13:04,516 --> 01:13:06,916
I think he's dead.

1393
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:12,954
Sam?

1394
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:17,492
Sam?

1395
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:19,494
One, two, three.

1396
01:13:19,496 --> 01:13:20,995
Sam!

1397
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:22,429
Come on.

1398
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,962
Aw, Sam.

1399
01:13:26,299 --> 01:13:27,798
Sam!

1400
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,334
I couldn't even do that for you.

1401
01:13:33,905 --> 01:13:36,505
Please forgive me.

1402
01:13:38,075 --> 01:13:40,008
God damn it!

1403
01:13:42,112 --> 01:13:44,312
Come to collect your gomer, doctor.

1404
01:13:48,117 --> 01:13:50,984
This man won a silver star, you know?

1405
01:13:52,087 --> 01:13:53,920
That makes him a hero.

1406
01:13:53,922 --> 01:13:58,024
<i>It doesn't make him a gomer.
You understand?</i>

1407
01:13:58,026 --> 01:14:00,659
You better treat him as well
as you treat your father,

1408
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:02,627
so help me god, or I'll break your neck.

1409
01:14:02,629 --> 01:14:03,761
Rodney,

1410
01:14:03,763 --> 01:14:05,529
I'll take care of this.

1411
01:14:06,999 --> 01:14:08,598
Nurse white,

1412
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,866
I want you to run these tests.
I want you to run them now.

1413
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:14,102
I don't give a shit about your
policies or your regulations.

1414
01:14:14,104 --> 01:14:16,037
If I hear one word from you,
I swear to you,

1415
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:17,972
I will bring you up on charges.

1416
01:14:17,974 --> 01:14:20,274
What are you waiting for?

1417
01:14:34,723 --> 01:14:37,190
Sam.

1418
01:15:39,053 --> 01:15:41,453
<i>- Before we begin.
- Our regular meeting,</i>

1419
01:15:41,455 --> 01:15:44,923
<i>would each department present
its inventory forms, please?</i>

1420
01:15:49,429 --> 01:15:51,662
<i>Just pass them all up.</i>

1421
01:15:59,037 --> 01:16:01,637
Is there a problem, doctor?

1422
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:03,138
Problem?

1423
01:16:05,642 --> 01:16:07,208
No problems.

1424
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:09,009
Good.

1425
01:16:11,046 --> 01:16:13,880
Thank you. Thank you all
for your cooperation.

1426
01:16:13,882 --> 01:16:14,981
Now...

1427
01:16:14,983 --> 01:16:17,116
You're gonna make it.

1428
01:16:17,118 --> 01:16:19,151
I know you're gonna make it.

1429
01:16:26,292 --> 01:16:29,593
I think maybe I should have
taken those hostages,

1430
01:16:29,595 --> 01:16:31,528
doc?

1431
01:16:32,597 --> 01:16:35,197
Excuse me, Mr. polaski.

1432
01:16:46,176 --> 01:16:48,308
Son of a bitch.

1433
01:16:56,115 --> 01:16:57,814
Can I help you, doctor?

1434
01:16:57,816 --> 01:17:00,249
I found the camera you hid

1435
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:02,184
to set up sturgess.

1436
01:17:02,186 --> 01:17:04,152
You used me.

1437
01:17:04,154 --> 01:17:06,621
You had the choice
of using what you heard.

1438
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:09,256
You just made the wrong decision.

1439
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:12,826
I believe some sort of
disciplinary action is necessary,

1440
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,527
since you've broken into my office.

1441
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:17,996
What are you doing?

1442
01:17:17,998 --> 01:17:20,031
I don't know,

1443
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:22,133
but I bet you there would
be a lot of people

1444
01:17:22,135 --> 01:17:24,301
interested in seeing this tape.

1445
01:17:24,303 --> 01:17:28,038
Why doctors have got to steal medical
supplies from their own goddamn hospitals

1446
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,040
so that they can
keep their patients alive.

1447
01:17:30,042 --> 01:17:32,108
You know, I... I think
the TV networks

1448
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:35,177
really should take a look at this.
What do you think?

1449
01:17:35,179 --> 01:17:37,045
Go ahead.
Show it.

1450
01:17:37,047 --> 01:17:40,715
We can always add your name to the list
of people being brought up on charges.

1451
01:17:40,717 --> 01:17:42,950
Yeah.

1452
01:17:42,952 --> 01:17:45,285
<i>Go through that door
and you can say goodbye</i>

1453
01:17:45,287 --> 01:17:48,053
<i>to ever doing anything
significant in medicine.</i>

1454
01:17:50,057 --> 01:17:52,023
There's always your job, sir.

1455
01:18:00,031 --> 01:18:01,964
You want me to get that?

1456
01:18:01,966 --> 01:18:03,365
Yeah.
All right.

1457
01:18:07,136 --> 01:18:10,904
Hey.
Is sturgess in?

1458
01:18:10,906 --> 01:18:12,839
Yeah.

1459
01:18:12,841 --> 01:18:14,207
Thanks.

1460
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:17,076
Sorry for calling on you so late.

1461
01:18:17,078 --> 01:18:19,144
I just thought you'd like to see this.

1462
01:18:19,146 --> 01:18:21,079
It's called "three men
in a pathology lab."

1463
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:23,347
The dialogue sucks, but
the action's pretty good.

1464
01:18:23,349 --> 01:18:25,015
Peter, where did you get this?

1465
01:18:25,017 --> 01:18:26,750
Dreyfoos's office.

1466
01:18:26,752 --> 01:18:28,985
Has anybody else seen this?

1467
01:18:28,987 --> 01:18:31,320
The lines are around the block.

1468
01:18:31,322 --> 01:18:33,488
I thought you were leaving us
for Beverly hills, Peter.

1469
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:36,757
Well, my plans got changed.
I was suspended this morning.

1470
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:40,093
- You got suspended?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1471
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:42,829
You're starting to make progress, doctor.
Have a seat.

1472
01:18:42,831 --> 01:18:45,398
Look, I don't have a lot of time.

1473
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,768
I just came by to tell you that
everybody wants you to come back.

1474
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:51,604
Do they realize the risk they're
running to their careers?

1475
01:18:51,606 --> 01:18:53,172
I mean this is very serious.

1476
01:18:53,174 --> 01:18:56,275
Well, we know that we want to
run the hospital with you,

1477
01:18:56,277 --> 01:19:00,445
or there's, not gonna be much
of a hospital left to run.

1478
01:19:07,453 --> 01:19:09,186
We've got enough food for a week,

1479
01:19:09,188 --> 01:19:11,221
have gasoline for the backup generators.

1480
01:19:11,223 --> 01:19:12,755
My man in the media is on the case.

1481
01:19:12,757 --> 01:19:15,224
And we've got enough brothers
to hold off a division.

1482
01:19:15,226 --> 01:19:16,925
Sturg, it's good to have you back.

1483
01:19:16,927 --> 01:19:19,227
I got Ellis and McCarthy
prepped and ready for us now.

1484
01:19:19,229 --> 01:19:20,461
All right, great great.

1485
01:19:20,463 --> 01:19:22,196
We're going to get Travis now.

1486
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:23,764
No, let's hold off on Travis.

1487
01:19:23,766 --> 01:19:25,198
I don't wanna really move him yet.

1488
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,766
So we'll schedule him
for a little later on.

1489
01:19:26,768 --> 01:19:29,301
Now listen, are you sure
you guys wanna do this?

1490
01:19:29,303 --> 01:19:32,704
Sturg, come on, we're back in business
here, pal. Let's rock 'n' roll.

1491
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,553
Okay, let's go, let's go.

1492
01:19:49,555 --> 01:19:51,154
<i>Hey!</i>

1493
01:19:51,156 --> 01:19:52,588
- Where is he?
- In the first bed.

1494
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:54,156
- Excuse me!
- Grant.

1495
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:56,358
- First bed.
- How you doing, Mr. Grant?

1496
01:20:08,938 --> 01:20:11,305
Can you please tell me
what's going on here?

1497
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,173
Yeah, it's an earthquake drill.

1498
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,807
Earthquake drill?

1499
01:20:14,809 --> 01:20:17,242
- See ya up on 3.
- We ain't got no earthquakes here!

1500
01:20:21,514 --> 01:20:23,354
Just a minute, where do
you think you're going?

1501
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:27,350
This patient is
reserved for the O.R.

1502
01:20:27,352 --> 01:20:28,684
Not if we get there first.

1503
01:20:28,686 --> 01:20:30,686
Stop! Stop!

1504
01:20:30,688 --> 01:20:33,188
I'll put you on report
for this, do you hear me?

1505
01:20:35,659 --> 01:20:37,425
What the hell is going on?

1506
01:20:37,427 --> 01:20:39,326
Dr. sturgess,

1507
01:20:39,328 --> 01:20:40,994
<i>just what do you think you're you doing?</i>

1508
01:20:40,996 --> 01:20:43,930
Practicing medicine.
What are you doing?

1509
01:20:50,871 --> 01:20:52,203
What are you doing?

1510
01:20:52,205 --> 01:20:55,105
Semiannual clearance, doctor.
Everything's half price.

1511
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:56,372
No no.
Come on. Come on.

1512
01:20:56,374 --> 01:20:58,407
<i>Let go.</i>

1513
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:01,342
I want you off the floor.
You're suspended.

1514
01:21:01,344 --> 01:21:04,611
- You're not allowed to touch a patient.
- Back off!

1515
01:21:07,315 --> 01:21:09,048
Okay, that's it.

1516
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:11,116
I want everyone out of here.

1517
01:21:11,118 --> 01:21:14,319
I want everyone off of this floor.

1518
01:21:14,321 --> 01:21:15,953
- All good?
- Yeah.

1519
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:19,323
All right, let's staple him up and
get ready for the next one then, OK?

1520
01:21:19,325 --> 01:21:21,458
<i>Attention, all security.</i>

1521
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,726
<i>Report to the nearest exit immediately</i>

1522
01:21:23,728 --> 01:21:25,227
<i>and take up positions outside.</i>

1523
01:21:25,229 --> 01:21:27,162
Red lion to all checkpoints.

1524
01:21:27,164 --> 01:21:30,398
Stand by.

1525
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,239
What are you doing?
Hey!

1526
01:21:43,477 --> 01:21:45,710
Hey! Hey!

1527
01:21:45,712 --> 01:21:47,645
Open the door.

1528
01:21:47,647 --> 01:21:49,346
Damn!

1529
01:21:49,348 --> 01:21:51,781
Copo like a mofo.

1530
01:21:54,385 --> 01:21:55,984
Listen to me.

1531
01:21:55,986 --> 01:21:59,053
I want every security guard
out in front when I arrive.

1532
01:21:59,055 --> 01:22:01,922
I'm instituting emergency procedures.

1533
01:22:09,764 --> 01:22:12,431
All of you come with me.

1534
01:22:26,413 --> 01:22:28,513
That's far enough.

1535
01:22:33,953 --> 01:22:35,519
Disarm that man.

1536
01:22:39,558 --> 01:22:42,358
For $4.25 an hour?

1537
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,694
Bullshit!

1538
01:22:45,696 --> 01:22:47,529
What...

1539
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:52,533
All right, Luther. Before
this goes any further,

1540
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:54,401
I'm willing to listen to your demands.

1541
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:56,302
Only two.

1542
01:22:56,304 --> 01:23:00,139
- Resign.
- And the other one?

1543
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:02,807
Unconditional surrender.

1544
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,883
You're gonna regret this.

1545
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:53,617
<i>- ¶ Hey there, dreyfoos,
- what you say? ¶</i>

1546
01:23:53,619 --> 01:23:56,186
¶ hey there, dreyfoos,

1547
01:23:56,188 --> 01:23:58,354
¶ how many vets
did you kill today? ¶

1548
01:23:58,356 --> 01:24:00,556
<i>¶ how many vets

1549
01:24:00,558 --> 01:24:02,090
<i>- ¶ hey there, dreyfoos,
- what you say ¶</i>

1550
01:24:02,092 --> 01:24:04,425
clear a path through for us, will you?

1551
01:24:04,427 --> 01:24:06,260
Just cut a path right in there.

1552
01:24:06,262 --> 01:24:08,228
That's federal jurisdiction.

1553
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:10,096
You handle this.

1554
01:24:10,098 --> 01:24:11,931
What do you mean,
it's federal jurisdiction?

1555
01:24:11,933 --> 01:24:13,799
<i>- You're gonna have.
- To handle this.</i>

1556
01:24:13,801 --> 01:24:16,902
<i>- What do you mean,
- I'm gonna have to handle this?</i>

1557
01:24:16,904 --> 01:24:18,370
I have no jurisdiction here!

1558
01:24:18,372 --> 01:24:20,705
Wait a minute, how am I supposed
to handle this by myself?

1559
01:24:20,707 --> 01:24:22,640
It's your job.

1560
01:24:22,642 --> 01:24:25,242
If they chained themselves to that bus
stop out there across the street,

1561
01:24:25,244 --> 01:24:26,943
I'll handle it.
But this is your store.

1562
01:24:26,945 --> 01:24:28,644
I don't give a damn about that bus stop!

1563
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,579
Get these people out of here.

1564
01:24:30,581 --> 01:24:33,048
- I can't do anything about it.
- I'll remember you too!

1565
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:35,650
<i>- ¶ V.A. Hospital.

1571
01:24:46,728 --> 01:24:49,161
my god!
It's the press.

1572
01:24:50,931 --> 01:24:53,064
It's Travis.

1573
01:24:53,066 --> 01:24:54,665
Shit.

1574
01:24:54,667 --> 01:24:58,502
One, two, three, four, five. Breathe.

1575
01:24:58,504 --> 01:25:01,238
- One, two, three...
- Got a pulse.

1576
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,739
Four, five, breathe.

1577
01:25:02,741 --> 01:25:04,340
Get him up.
Come on.

1578
01:25:05,509 --> 01:25:07,742
- <i>Go!</i>
- Up!

1579
01:25:07,744 --> 01:25:09,810
<i>We're already 24 hours</i>

1580
01:25:09,812 --> 01:25:12,145
<i>into what appears to be a long siege.</i>

1581
01:25:12,147 --> 01:25:14,514
<i>The veterans,
along with doctors and nurses</i>

1582
01:25:14,516 --> 01:25:16,849
<i>and other medical volunteers
who support them,</i>

1583
01:25:16,851 --> 01:25:19,117
<i>seem to be in no mood for compromise,</i>

1584
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:21,752
<i>as federal marshals finally arrive.</i>

1585
01:25:21,754 --> 01:25:24,521
<i>From here, I can see
the hospital director,</i>

1586
01:25:24,523 --> 01:25:28,491
<i>who is welcoming officials
from the justice department</i>

1587
01:25:28,493 --> 01:25:31,360
and the inspector general,
who flew in tonight

1588
01:25:31,362 --> 01:25:33,695
<i>on an emergency flight from Washington.</i>

1589
01:25:33,697 --> 01:25:35,630
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you.

1590
01:25:35,632 --> 01:25:37,098
What's the latest word from Washington?

1591
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:39,700
Well, same old story, no money.

1592
01:25:39,702 --> 01:25:42,703
¶ Hey there, dreyfoos,
what you say? ¶

1593
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:44,271
¶ hey there, dreyfoos,

1597
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:52,778
<i>sound off!</i>
Good evening, gentlemen.

1598
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,348
- <i>¶ Sound off! ¶</i>
- I'm the inspector general.

1599
01:25:56,350 --> 01:26:00,018
<i>I've come to do some talking
with... with your representative,</i>

1600
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:03,121
Mr. Luther Jerome.

1601
01:26:03,123 --> 01:26:04,622
Mr. Jerome,

1602
01:26:04,624 --> 01:26:06,557
the inspector general's here.

1603
01:26:06,559 --> 01:26:08,859
Let me say, sir,

1604
01:26:08,861 --> 01:26:11,728
the pleasure is dynamic.

1605
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:14,697
The main thing we don't wanna do, Luther,

1606
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:18,400
we don't want to act out
a "Rambo" out here now.

1607
01:26:18,402 --> 01:26:20,902
We've heard it all before, general!

1608
01:26:20,904 --> 01:26:25,072
You've never heard it from me.
I give you my word.

1609
01:26:25,074 --> 01:26:29,075
And if I tell you it's gonna rain,
you can get yourself an umbrella.

1610
01:26:29,077 --> 01:26:31,744
You want an answer?

1611
01:26:31,746 --> 01:26:34,646
Well, here it is!

1612
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:35,880
Let it go.

1613
01:26:46,691 --> 01:26:49,591
Why don't we just take these men
and go right through there?

1614
01:26:49,593 --> 01:26:51,693
It's not that simple,
Henry, for Christ's sake.

1615
01:26:57,566 --> 01:27:01,500
Sturg, they're giving us two hours
to evacuate. Then they're coming in.

1616
01:27:01,502 --> 01:27:02,868
Get the O.R. prepped.

1617
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:05,437
All right, he doesn't have two hours.
Let's get a gurney.

1618
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:27,258
Ready your positions.
There's no green light.

1619
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,126
Take positions.
No green light.

1620
01:27:29,128 --> 01:27:32,062
<i>Repeat, no green light.</i>

1621
01:27:32,064 --> 01:27:34,731
<i>- Nobody shoots.
- Move out.</i>

1622
01:27:34,733 --> 01:27:37,700
Get ready to lock and load.

1623
01:27:37,702 --> 01:27:39,868
¶ ...get it through
your stupid brains ¶

1624
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:41,903

1627

<i>¶ get it through
your stupid brains... ¶</i>

1628
01:27:51,779 --> 01:27:54,780
what's the matter? Didn't you ever
want anything better than this?

1629
01:27:56,116 --> 01:27:59,250
You mean there's
something better than this?

1630
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,060
Hey, sturg.
Ready for you.

1631
01:28:11,062 --> 01:28:14,596
Red lion to all units, stand by.
They're coming in.

1632
01:28:14,598 --> 01:28:16,965
<i>¶ ...you ain't gonna
break our chain ¶</i>

1633
01:28:16,967 --> 01:28:20,902
<i>- 2 kilos, I'm gonna give him.
- 24,000 units of ep.</i>

1634
01:28:22,505 --> 01:28:24,838
You see how enlarged it is?

1635
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,173
All right, let's go to work.

1636
01:28:33,314 --> 01:28:35,981
Cut the lights out now.

1637
01:28:41,788 --> 01:28:43,320
<i>Loss of power.</i>

1638
01:28:43,322 --> 01:28:45,422
- Get light in here.
- <i>Pressure's gone.</i>

1639
01:28:45,424 --> 01:28:47,757
<i>- Where the hell's.
- The backup?</i>

1640
01:28:47,759 --> 01:28:49,692
Come on, stay with me, Travis.

1641
01:28:49,694 --> 01:28:51,760
Get ready to pull the pin.

1642
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:01,301
What?

1643
01:29:01,303 --> 01:29:03,036
<i>Sturgess, they're coming in!</i>

1644
01:29:03,038 --> 01:29:04,937
Peter.

1645
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:07,940
Have you ever pitched relief?

1646
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:10,575
No. <i>- Well, you're up now. Go on.</i>

1647
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:16,446
Everybody ready?
Sutures, please.

1648
01:29:16,448 --> 01:29:18,314
You got it.

1649
01:29:18,316 --> 01:29:20,616
Thanks, sid.

1650
01:29:20,618 --> 01:29:23,084
Okay, let's start the bypass.

1651
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,619
Okay.

1652
01:29:26,621 --> 01:29:28,654
What the hell?

1653
01:29:28,656 --> 01:29:30,789
Luther, Luther, give me the gun.
Stop this.

1654
01:29:30,791 --> 01:29:32,991
Luther, Luther, the war's over.
Stop this.

1655
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:34,892
- This war's just starting.
- Give me this.

1656
01:29:34,894 --> 01:29:37,694
They want this hospital, they're going
to take it away from us, right, boys?

1657
01:29:37,696 --> 01:29:39,962
We got all the patients that we need.

1658
01:29:39,964 --> 01:29:41,964
This is over. It's gone far enough.
It's over.

1659
01:29:41,966 --> 01:29:44,533
Over? What are
you talking about?

1660
01:29:44,535 --> 01:29:46,968
What about all those men out there?

1661
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:49,203
Luther, I'm here because of these men.

1662
01:29:49,205 --> 01:29:53,206
I promised them this day
would mean something.

1663
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:55,374
This is gonna mean something, Luther,

1664
01:29:55,376 --> 01:29:57,576
but we've gotta stop now.

1665
01:29:57,578 --> 01:29:59,911
Don't do it.

1666
01:30:00,847 --> 01:30:02,979
What, are you gonna shoot me, Luther?

1667
01:30:05,183 --> 01:30:07,850
- Pressure's gone.
- We're losing him.

1668
01:30:07,852 --> 01:30:10,552
Epinephrine in now.
Robin, come on.

1669
01:30:11,988 --> 01:30:14,088
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

1670
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:15,722
<i>Epinephrine in!</i>

1671
01:30:17,392 --> 01:30:18,758
Hey, Luther.

1672
01:30:29,001 --> 01:30:31,901
He's right, Luther.

1673
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:46,080
God damn, whose side are these people on?

1674
01:30:53,755 --> 01:30:56,188
I'm gonna get a resolve
on this thing right now.

1675
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:58,523
We're gonna get some answers
and I mean fucking quick.

1676
01:31:00,693 --> 01:31:02,626
<i>- We got a little.
- Company here.</i>

1677
01:31:02,628 --> 01:31:05,862
<i>- Stay with me, Travis.
- Come on.</i>

1678
01:31:08,733 --> 01:31:10,699
He's fading on us.

1679
01:31:10,701 --> 01:31:12,467
<i>All unauthorized personnel,</i>

1680
01:31:12,469 --> 01:31:14,035
<i>this is the FBI.</i>

1681
01:31:14,037 --> 01:31:17,238
<i>You are in violation of federal law.</i>

1682
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:20,207
<i>Evacuate this building immediately.</i>

1683
01:31:20,209 --> 01:31:22,409
<i>- God damn it, I'm losing him.
- Come on, defib.</i>

1684
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:24,043
I got the pressors wide open here.

1685
01:31:25,547 --> 01:31:28,146
Good.

1686
01:31:29,082 --> 01:31:31,082
Clear.

1687
01:31:31,084 --> 01:31:34,685
Hello, pressure.
We're back up.

1688
01:31:34,687 --> 01:31:37,821
There we go. We got a
normal sinus rhythm.

1689
01:31:37,823 --> 01:31:40,690
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

1690
01:31:40,692 --> 01:31:42,224
In a surprise move,

1691
01:31:42,226 --> 01:31:45,227
resistance inside
the hospital has collapsed.

1692
01:31:45,229 --> 01:31:46,895
Marshals went in minutes ago,

1693
01:31:46,897 --> 01:31:48,496
<i>followed by federal officials.</i>

1694
01:31:48,498 --> 01:31:50,664
<i>The siege may be over.</i>

1695
01:31:50,666 --> 01:31:53,767
<i>I'm Chris albee,
channel 10, k.J.M. News.</i>

1696
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,139
- Thank god!
- Hallelujah!

1697
01:32:13,451 --> 01:32:15,784
I'll take care of this.

1698
01:32:19,122 --> 01:32:21,422
If you go in there now,
the patient will die.

1699
01:32:21,424 --> 01:32:24,057
This is one of them. The other
ringleaders are inside.

1700
01:32:24,059 --> 01:32:26,726
I want them all arrested.

1701
01:32:26,728 --> 01:32:29,862
Arrested?

1702
01:32:29,864 --> 01:32:31,964
This operation is unauthorized.

1703
01:32:31,966 --> 01:32:34,066
All of these doctors are under suspension

1704
01:32:34,068 --> 01:32:35,934
and I want them taken into custody, now.

1705
01:32:35,936 --> 01:32:38,102
Go ahead. What's another
patient more or less?

1706
01:32:38,104 --> 01:32:40,804
You never gave a shit before,
why should you start now?

1707
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:43,873
You see what this hospital
has had to contend with?

1708
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:46,275
Yes.

1709
01:32:46,277 --> 01:32:48,143
Yes, I think I do see.

1710
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:50,145
Wait a minute, didn't you hear me?

1711
01:32:50,147 --> 01:32:52,080
I said I want them taken into custody.

1712
01:32:52,082 --> 01:32:53,648
As director of this hospital,

1713
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:55,950
I demand that you arrest them all!

1714
01:32:57,086 --> 01:32:59,186
Take your hand off of me.

1715
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:03,088
I've been in government
service damn near 40 years

1716
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:06,558
and I've seen your kind
from Europe to Saigon.

1717
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,159
It's a sad truth,

1718
01:33:08,161 --> 01:33:10,728
but shit does float to the top.

1719
01:33:10,730 --> 01:33:13,263
You'd better get you a good lawyer.

1720
01:33:13,265 --> 01:33:16,165
Congressional hearings tend
to be hazardous on careers.

1721
01:33:16,167 --> 01:33:19,067
God knows how this one's gonna turn out.

1722
01:33:21,004 --> 01:33:23,237
Go back to work, son.

1723
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:25,072
Yes, sir.

1724
01:33:25,074 --> 01:33:27,007
Let's go, Claude.

1725
01:33:27,009 --> 01:33:29,476
<i>Let's go, men.</i>

1726
01:33:36,117 --> 01:33:38,984
Looks like you finally made it
to Washington after all, sir.

1727
01:33:38,986 --> 01:33:41,353
Congratulations.

1728
01:34:00,606 --> 01:34:03,173
<i>Luth! Luth! Luth!</i>

1729
01:34:03,175 --> 01:34:05,608
<i>Luth! Luth! Luth!</i>

1730
01:34:21,292 --> 01:34:23,892
God.

1731
01:34:29,232 --> 01:34:30,698
You know, I was thinking about

1732
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:34,234
that accelerated internship
program you were talking about.

1733
01:34:34,236 --> 01:34:36,302
I'm in no real hurry.

1734
01:34:36,304 --> 01:34:39,204
There are a lot of interesting
possibilities to research right here.

1735
01:34:39,206 --> 01:34:41,706
<i>I'm serious.</i>

1736
01:34:45,144 --> 01:34:46,409
Hey, Robin.

1737
01:34:46,411 --> 01:34:49,779
<i>Maybe we'd, go for that
cup of coffee sometime.</i>

1738
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:02,222
It's OK.

1739
01:35:04,492 --> 01:35:06,892
Thank you.

1740
01:35:06,894 --> 01:35:09,561
God, thank you.

1741
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,839
<i>Just one minute.</i>

1742
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:24,608
Yes, nurse.

1743
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:28,011
Thought you'd be needing this...

1744
01:35:28,013 --> 01:35:29,245
Doctor.

1745
01:35:37,554 --> 01:35:40,421
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1746
01:35:43,392 --> 01:35:46,259
That's good.

1747
01:35:46,261 --> 01:35:48,694
<i>- Good afternoon.
- As the new director,</i>

1748
01:35:48,696 --> 01:35:52,230
<i>I'm implementing the following regulations
to go into effect immediately.</i>

1749
01:35:52,232 --> 01:35:54,198
<i>First,</i>

1750
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,767
<i>there has been a noticeable laxness
in appearance in this hospital.</i>

1751
01:35:57,769 --> 01:35:59,935
<i>Therefore,</i>

1752
01:35:59,937 --> 01:36:02,237
<i>I am reinstituting the dress code,</i>

1753
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,872
<i>with no exceptions.</i>

1754
01:36:04,874 --> 01:36:06,740
<i>In addition,</i>

1755
01:36:06,742 --> 01:36:09,275
<i>there will be no, I repeat,</i>

1756
01:36:09,277 --> 01:36:11,243
<i>no unauthorized</i>

1757
01:36:11,245 --> 01:36:14,079
<i>medical procedures performed.</i>

1758
01:36:14,081 --> 01:36:17,282
<i>And to help us with our
new program of waste control,</i>

1759
01:36:17,284 --> 01:36:21,251
<i>I have prepared a special inventory form.</i>

1760
01:36:21,253 --> 01:36:23,620
<i>If you will examine this form,</i>

1761
01:36:23,622 --> 01:36:25,221
<i>you will find...</i>
