1
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,916
( rumbling )

2
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:48,613
( sirens blaring )

3
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:52,284
( horn honking )

4
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,033
- ( noisemakers hooting )
- ( children chattering )

5
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:07,028
Guys, settle down.
Settle down, you guys.

6
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:09,041
Who just threw that?

7
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:11,168
I'll throw something
back at you.

8
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:14,408
No, no more soda,
you guys are crazy.

9
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:16,575
Taxi, taxi!

10
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:18,243
No, no, I got that.
I got that.

11
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:20,150
- Sorry, pal.
- Woman: It's okay...

12
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,485
( horns honking )

13
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:37,468
You're stupid!
That's just stupid!

14
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,165
Hey, motherfucker!

15
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,134
Where's the wallet?

16
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:44,973
Woman: Give me that cake.
Where's Paul?

17
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:50,182
- Maurice?
- Oh shit, Mr. Duncan.

18
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:51,946
You know this dude?

19
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:53,976
I had Maurice
in my ninth grade bio class

20
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,580
about fiVe years ago.

21
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:59,683
I guess those extra help sessions
didn't quite do it for you.

22
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:02,160
Let's go, man.

23
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:05,358
This guy's cool.
He's the best teacher I eVer had.

24
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:06,990
Let's go.

25
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:10,934
Sorry about this,
Mr. Duncan.

26
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:19,903
Honest mistake.

27
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,098
Paul:
Got things under control?

28
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:41,157
Paul, what took you
so long?

29
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,431
I ran into an old student,
I got held up.

30
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,564
- Mm-hmm, did you get the present?
- Yeah, yeah, Voila.

31
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:48,335
Gorgeous.

32
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,364
All right,
let's do this.

33
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,468
Clara, get the lights.

34
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,479
- Finally.
- I know.

35
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:55,208
Ready?
EVerybody, eVerybody!

36
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:56,738
How you doin', Jeff?

37
00:03:56,783 --> 00:04:00,150
Paul: Where is he?
Where's my boy?

38
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:02,416
- Hey!
- Dad.

39
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:06,357
All:
- happy birthday to you -

40
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:07,587
How, you doin'?

41
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:12,155
- Happy birthday to you -

42
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:18,831
- Happy birthday,
dear Adam -

43
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:25,277
- Happy birthday to you! -

44
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:28,110
- Hey, kid!
- You made me laugh.

45
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:30,378
( kids screaming )

46
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:33,642
( screams and applause )

47
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:38,782
So Dorset Prep,
where is that exactly?

48
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,759
- Mars.
- Oh, that's hilarious.

49
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:42,489
It's in the suburbs,
a half hour away.

50
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:44,827
It's a great offer,
but Paul hasn't made up his mind yet.

51
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:47,025
I bet that's a change from the school
you teach at now.

52
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:49,763
Oh yeah, less crack,
better cafeteria selection.

53
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,397
Don't mind Paul. He's still grappling
with his conscience.

54
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,897
Mom, Dad, this is
the coolest present eVer!

55
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,342
Oh-ho,
it looks good too, right?

56
00:04:58,378 --> 00:04:59,936
Do you think
he needs more sugar?

57
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,811
Yeah I know,
I'm breaking eVery rule.

58
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:05,011
- Hello, is Steggie in here?
- Beware.

59
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:07,519
Hey, cake for Steggie.

60
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:10,022
- He can't eat that, it--
- Why not?

61
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:11,853
He's an herbiVore.

62
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:16,157
Oh, oh,
he's an herbiVore.

63
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:18,289
Okay, then
I'll just take it back.

64
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,232
- Wait, maybe leaVe it, just in case.
- Take it back.

65
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:22,928
- That's what I thought.
- Good night.

66
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,493
- Bye, Dad.
- Good birthday?

67
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:25,561
- Yeah.
- All right.

68
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:27,334
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

69
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:29,535
What was your
faVorite present?

70
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:31,771
- My jacket...
- Yay!

71
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:35,907
- ...You got me.
- You look so good in red.

72
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,451
What's on your agenda
tomorrow?

73
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:42,614
Uh, I haVe to stop
by the gallery.

74
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:44,647
I haVe to pick up
a lens I ordered.

75
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:48,627
I haVe to get a new pair
of sneakers for Adam.

76
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:51,495
Ooh, I haVe to do you.

77
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,293
I could take care
of that right now.

78
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,939
HaVe you thought
about that job offer?

79
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:09,474
You do realize
it'd mean moVing, right?

80
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:12,280
( both sighing )

81
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:14,047
So, we'd moVe.

82
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:16,749
You know we used to think
we were pretty hip liVing down here.

83
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,090
I also used to think four Merit Lights
and a Diet Coke constituted a meal.

84
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:24,756
Honey, I loVe this place as much as you
do, but we'Ve got a kid to think about.

85
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:28,029
And I just don't think any city is
a great place to raise a kid these days.

86
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:30,229
Plus, you'd be making twice
what you're making now.

87
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,706
I'm just not sure the timing's right and
your photography is starting to take.

88
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,503
This is not about
my photography.

89
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,841
Okay, I just can't shake this feeling
that somehow...

90
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,869
I'd be selling out.

91
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:44,984
Right. Listen...

92
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:48,920
you know how much
I respect your ethics.

93
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,786
But this is about Adam.

94
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,691
Sometimes, ethics
haVe to take a back seat.

95
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,328
Jessie:
Okay, your turn.

96
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:02,300
- Okay, I'm going to a picnic...
- Yeah?

97
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:06,066
And I'm going
to bring an ant,

98
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:09,371
a bagel,
a croissant,

99
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:13,368
- a ding dong...
- Like you?

100
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:15,210
- Mom!
- ( chuckles )

101
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:17,045
- A ding dong...
- Yeah?

102
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,382
- Uh...
- Shoe store, 3:00!

103
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,911
- Yes!
- Take my hand.

104
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:25,015
( air pumping )

105
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:30,986
I think if you pump them any more,
they might explode.

106
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,363
Really?

107
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,164
- ( pumping )
- Kaboom!

108
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:39,171
- Do you want 'em or not?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:42,470
- Do you want this?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,245
I'm just gonna go
test these outside, okay?

111
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,908
Okay, but don't go
too far, okay?

112
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,042
And how would you like
to pay for this?

113
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:54,315
A credit card, please.

114
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:57,653
- ( reverse signal beeping )
- (jackhammer rattling )

115
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:16,237
Ma'am?
I need your signature.

116
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,870
Sorry, so sorry.
All right, sorry.

117
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,847
- ( beeping continues )
- (jackhammer continues )

118
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:26,647
- Thanks.
- Great.

119
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:35,360
- ( tires screeching )
- ( horns blaring )

120
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,992
( gasps )

121
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:53,371
Paul: Hello!

122
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,050
You guys!

123
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:01,417
Where's
my greeting committee?

124
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:04,855
Jess?

125
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:07,951
I'm sorry, I got stuck
at a teacher's conference.

126
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:10,485
Jessie?

127
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:18,904
Machine Voice:
You haVe four new messages.

128
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,998
( Jessie, sobbing )
Paul, l--

129
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,271
( beeps )

130
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,744
( dial tone )

131
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:37,482
( sobbing )
God damn it!

132
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:42,053
( crow cawing )

133
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:03,347
We'll handle all
the funeral arrangements.

134
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:06,750
- God be with you.
- Thank you for eVerything, father.

135
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:13,382
Honey?

136
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:32,138
Excuse me, Jessie?
Jessie Duncan?

137
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,702
Yeah?

138
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:36,943
It's Richard,
Richard Wells.

139
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:39,912
Richard?

140
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:42,717
Your wife was an undergraduate
student of mine. It's been years.

141
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:47,419
Actually, Richard, it's--
it's kind of a bad time.

142
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,588
I know, I read about it in the paper.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

143
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,326
- Thank you.
- Actually, do you haVe a minute?

144
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,357
I'm sorry,
I know this is a terrible time.

145
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:56,698
I don't think so.
Not right now.

146
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,397
But belieVe me,
if there was any other way...

147
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,406
The truth is, I went
to some trouble to find you.

148
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,203
I'd like to help you.

149
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,478
Help us?

150
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:09,072
I'm a doctor.
I specialize in fertility.

151
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:12,380
If we could just talk,
it won't take long, I promise you.

152
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:14,852
We can go to a restaurant
right oVer there.

153
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:19,449
Richard: I finished the residency in
ob-gyn, but my real passion is research.

154
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:25,263
- What is it you do, Paul?
- I teach biology.

155
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:28,699
- You do?
- Can you tell us what this is about?

156
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:34,206
Yeah.

157
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,765
The truth is,
there is--

158
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:41,109
there's no easy way
to present this to you,

159
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:42,944
so I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

160
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:49,248
My clinic has perfected a procedure
by which a single cell

161
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:52,917
could be used to create
a genetically-identical fetus--

162
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,056
a fetus which could be carried to term
and, in effect, be reborn.

163
00:11:58,097 --> 00:11:59,758
- Do you mean cloned?
- Yes.

164
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,097
Yes. Yes.

165
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:05,662
This would be
the identical boy

166
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:09,573
down to the last chromosome
on the last hair of his head.

167
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,941
This is how
you wanna help us?

168
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:14,412
I used to be affiliated
with a hospital here

169
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,438
and I had a chance
to reView Jessie's records.

170
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:17,813
You did what?

171
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,910
I'm aware of the complications
surrounding Adam's deliVery,

172
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:23,319
that it's impossible
for you to conceive again.

173
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:24,618
You looked at her records?

174
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:26,625
I had to be certain
that Jessie's condition

175
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:31,255
didn't preclude carrying a child and
it doesn't, so yes, I can help you.

176
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:35,256
You can haVe him back, your son Adam,
to birth again, to raise.

177
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:38,327
- Adam's dead, God damn it!
- Paul. Paul.

178
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:40,635
- My son is dead!
- Paul, please.

179
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:41,901
You come at me with this?

180
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:44,068
God knows what hell
you'Ve been through.

181
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,704
The last thing I want to do
is make this time any harder.

182
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,374
But the truth is I can do this,
and I want you to know.

183
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:52,873
What you're talking about is illegal,
not to mention potentially immoral.

184
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,819
Illegal, yes.
Immoral, no.

185
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,516
We're talking about using life
to create life, that's all.

186
00:12:57,557 --> 00:13:00,617
And you'Ve done this before? You'Ve
successfully cloned a human being?

187
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,491
No, I haVen't but only
because I'Ve been looking

188
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:04,689
for an ideal candidate.
I read about what happened.

189
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,493
And I hope that if you two
aren't interested

190
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:09,763
- in what I'm proposing here--
- What are you proposing here?

191
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:12,703
- He's not eVen sure that he can--
- That's not true-- I am sure.

192
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:14,330
Still, it does
come down to trust.

193
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:17,069
- You'd be--
- Excuse me, your menus.

194
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:25,446
You'd be gambling on me
as much as I'd be gambling on you.

195
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:28,587
My clinic is some
300 miles from here.

196
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:30,418
If you were to do this,
it would mean moVing there

197
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:33,016
and I'll be honest with you,
changing your liVes entirely.

198
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,425
Paul's right,
this is extremely against the law.

199
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,361
You'd haVe to seVer
all ties with family,

200
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:39,523
with friends, with anyone
who eVer knew Adam.

201
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,590
Of course I would help
with the relocation,

202
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,761
and I can get you a job
at the local high school.

203
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:46,271
- You know what, I'Ve heard enough.
- Paul, please.

204
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:49,365
- I know how upsetting this is.
- No, no, no, you don't know!

205
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:52,707
You could neVer know.

206
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:54,440
- Let's go!
- You're right.

207
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,880
I'm sorry
to haVe upset you.

208
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,680
- Jessie...
- Jessie!

209
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:02,477
I can be reached
at this number.

210
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:04,387
- DNA can be saVed indefinitely...
- Jessie!

211
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:07,119
But Adam's cells will only be Viable
another 72 hours.

212
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,787
So if you do change
your mind...

213
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,294
Practically a stranger.
I can't believe you're considering this!

214
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,529
I can't belieVe you're
not considering this.

215
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,731
Any idea how much
could go wrong?

216
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:28,111
Honey, l-- Iisten,
I loVe you, I loVe you.

217
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:31,412
I loVe you
beyond words, okay?

218
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,851
But only the tiniest thing has to go
wrong and so much has to go right.

219
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:35,911
But what if it did?

220
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,617
It still wouldn't be Adam.
It would be an identical twin.

221
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:39,750
It'd be like another kid.

222
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,726
But he'd haVe the same face
and the same laugh.

223
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:44,025
- In time, we can try again, I swear.
- No, we can't.

224
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:47,658
- You know we can't.
- We'll find a way. We can haVe--

225
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,965
I don't want another child!
I want Adam!

226
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:53,301
I want him back.

227
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,057
( sobbing )

228
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:25,698
You know what I kept thinking
while I was waiting for paramedics...

229
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:29,105
and he was in my arms...

230
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:32,508
and I was watching him die?

231
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:38,608
"This is the last time
I'll eVer get to hold him."

232
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,320
My little boy.

233
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:46,177
( telephone ringing )

234
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:52,315
- Hello.
- Man: Paul.

235
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:56,317
I-- I just heard.
I'm so sorry.

236
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:58,762
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, Sam.

237
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:01,028
Um... so...

238
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,865
how's Jessie
taking all this?

239
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,499
Actually, she's--
she's not so well.

240
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,565
Right, ofcourse.

241
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:15,138
Look, would you please just
pass on my condolences to her?

242
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:16,205
Yeah, I will.

243
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,486
Hey, Sam, can l--
can I ask you something?

244
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,785
Have you ever heard
ofa doctor named Richard Wells?

245
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:28,089
Richard Wells.
Sure I'Ve heard of him. Why do you ask?

246
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:30,152
He was an old teacher
of Jessie's.

247
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:33,563
Really? He's
the stuff of legend.

248
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,568
He was doing really adVanced
work on gene mapping.

249
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,570
We're talking
way ahead of his time.

250
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:41,835
Anyway,
last thing I heard,

251
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:45,674
he sold his findings to a huge firm,
made a ridiculous amount of money,

252
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,805
and then just sort of dropped out
of the game entirely.

253
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:52,784
Every once in a while I come across
an article ofhis in ajournal,

254
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:56,345
consistently brilliant.
Like I said, he's--

255
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:59,153
A genius.
Yeah, I know.

256
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:03,457
- Paul, I'm so very sorry.
- Okay, thanks.

257
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,400
- Adam: Or you go like that.
- (Jessie singing )

258
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:17,136
(Jessie and Adam laughing )

259
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:19,406
Adam: One...

260
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:21,970
- ( Jessie laughing )
- Paul: Oh, ooh!

261
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:24,346
Can't you see this?

262
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,375
Paul: Three, two, one.
The game is live!

263
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,587
- Paul: Then all ofa sudden...
- I'm right side up!

264
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:33,615
Wait a second,
you're confusing me.

265
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,295
Do you think
that's a good idea?

266
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:40,025
No, I think
we should call it Adam.

267
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:43,299
- Adam: Guess who?
- Paul: I don't know.

268
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:45,462
- It's me, Adam.
- I don't think I know an Adam.

269
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,404
- I'm your son.
- ( Paul laughing )

270
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,568
- Paul: Ow! Ow!
- Jessie: The familyjewels.

271
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:53,237
Jessie:
Are we all in?

272
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,474
- Paul: Damn, what a handsome group.
- Adam: Yep.

273
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:59,479
- Paul: Hi, Mom!
- Jessie: Adam!

274
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:01,418
- Adam: Hello...
- Paul: This hat.

275
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,388
I'Ve neVer seen you
wear this before.

276
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:04,980
Bad hair day,
I guess.

277
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:07,117
I'Ve neVer seen you
wear any hat.

278
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:47,290
Richard: All cells are
in essence clones--

279
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,733
identical copies
ofone original cell.

280
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:53,101
The key to artificially
stimulating replication

281
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:56,835
is in shocking a specialized cell
back to its pre-specialized state--

282
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:59,242
its stem cell precursor--

283
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:02,577
The cell as it was before it became
a liver cell or a brain cell,

284
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,879
or a relatively simpler
cheek cell.

285
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:13,358
Once in this state, the cell's nucleus
is immediately transferred

286
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:15,622
to a mother's
enucleated egg.

287
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:17,993
The transfer completed,
the egg cell will then

288
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,225
ideally accept the donor
nucleus as its own.

289
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,427
At which point,
we let nature take its course.

290
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:34,446
She did great.

291
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,177
We just need to keep her here until
tomorrow to make sure the implant takes.

292
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:40,014
But she did wonderfully.

293
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,043
She has to lie down
for at least an hour,

294
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:44,647
so why don't we go look at the house
and I'll show you around?

295
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,352
She's in good hands.

296
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:50,920
So, all these people
and no one else knows?

297
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:53,693
The procedure doesn't differ
much from a standard implant.

298
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,359
So, as far as
my staff's concerned,

299
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:58,097
Jessie's being treated as a high-risk
in Vitro, nothing more.

300
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:00,571
- Dr. Wells?
- Thanks, George.

301
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:02,198
There you go.

302
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:10,609
RiVerton's a great town, I think
you're really gonna like it here.

303
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:14,449
It's a bit secluded maybe,
but a wonderful community.

304
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:17,944
Nice people,
lots of families--

305
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,857
perfect place
to raise a child.

306
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:23,691
So why don't you follow me?
I'll show you around.

307
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:51,013
Richard:
Beautiful country, isn't it?

308
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,251
This whole area
has a lot ofhistory.

309
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,988
And the house itself
is 100 years old at least.

310
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:59,725
Sorry, there's no furniture.
So I took the liberty of ordering some.

311
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:01,699
It should be here
sometime tomorrow.

312
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,964
What if this didn't work,
Richard?

313
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:07,495
What if the implant doesn't take,
the procedure's a bust-- what then?

314
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:09,973
- It'll work, Paul.
- You can't say that with any certainty.

315
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:12,443
Look, no one can say anything
with any certainty.

316
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:14,969
I mean, eVen a routine
pregnancy is fallible.

317
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:18,973
But if I can speak plainly,
what more do you haVe to lose?

318
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:21,748
Her. Jessie.

319
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:25,245
She's pinned eVery hope
in the world on this.

320
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,424
And I won't let her down, or you.

321
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:37,060
You haVe my word on that.

322
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:52,617
Is this for real?

323
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:54,642
For now.

324
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:04,652
Jessie:
I can't belieVe this place.

325
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,270
Hey.

326
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:25,940
- Look at this.
- What is that?

327
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,152
Oh my God, Paul.

328
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,422
You know what
we could put down here?

329
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,458
Darkroom?

330
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,272
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.

331
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,946
Jessie!

332
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:03,614
Hon? I'm back.

333
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:07,984
I'm home to our...

334
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,994
big home!

335
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:12,019
Hey!

336
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:24,966
Hi.

337
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:40,853
You said we'd neVer
haVe a party in here.

338
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:50,532
- ( screaming )
- Come on.

339
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,503
- Come on, come on, push it.
- I can't!

340
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,165
- Yes.
- No, it hurts.

341
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:56,174
- Yes.
- Richard: You're doing fine, Jessie.

342
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,302
You're fully dilated, the head's already
crowning, you just need to now push.

343
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:00,971
- Something's wrong.
- No, nothing is wrong.

344
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,605
Something's wrong,
I'm telling you.

345
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:04,377
It's coming out. It's fine.
You can see the head.

346
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,475
- Nurse: Keep pushing. Push, push, push.
- ( Jessie groaning )

347
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,509
- Richard: Keep pushing, push.
- Nurse: Good girl.

348
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,681
- Richard: Come on, push, push, push.
- Come on, come on.

349
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:13,282
Oh, there we go, okay.

350
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:15,885
All right, all right,
we're out, we're out.

351
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:17,657
- That's it.
- ( Jessie panting )

352
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:19,891
It's okay.

353
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:22,901
Let me just hear you--
Iet me just hear you scream.

354
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:26,769
- Paul: You did great.
- Come on, come on.

355
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:29,035
( panting )

356
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:33,505
That's great, honey.
He's all right.

357
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:34,842
It's great.

358
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,610
I just need
some breath from him.

359
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:39,116
He's all right.

360
00:25:39,151 --> 00:25:40,209
Richard:
Okay, how long?

361
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:43,710
Nurse:
30 seconds, 31, 32...

362
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:46,849
33, 34, 35...

363
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:48,917
- 36, 37...
- We're gonna haVe to bag him.

364
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:51,486
- 38, 39...
- Paul: What's wrong?

365
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,862
- 40 seconds, 41...
- 40...

366
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:55,992
- 42, 43...
- Come on, come on.

367
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:58,594
- Both: 44...
- ( baby crying )

368
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:00,127
( chuckles )

369
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:10,111
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby, thank God.

370
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:13,447
This is the same
as last time, remember?

371
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:17,546
It's him. You wanted
to giVe us a scare, didn't you?

372
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:19,887
Oh, thank you, God.

373
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:21,950
Thank you.

374
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:24,552
Thank you.

375
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:33,370
Here you go, kiddo.

376
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:38,401
Good night, Adam.

377
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:44,480
My little boy.

378
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:47,508
I still think
it's a little strange.

379
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:49,645
Huh-uh.
It's his name.

380
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:52,555
It's always been
his name-- Adam.

381
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,231
- ...Birthday to you -

382
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:06,431
- Happy birthday to you -

383
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:12,376
- Happy birthday,
dear Adam -

384
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:17,940
- Happy birthday to you! -

385
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:20,349
( all screaming )

386
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:23,812
There you go, buddy.

387
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:26,490
Uncle Richard!

388
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:29,221
Happy birthday, Adam.

389
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:32,162
Jessie; Cake, cake, cake!
Cake time! Cake!

390
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:33,687
Richard:
So, how's work going?

391
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:38,192
Paul: It's good. It's good--
nice kids, bright too.

392
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:42,502
I don't know, sometimes
I feel like I'm teaching fish to swim...

393
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:45,135
at a Club Med.

394
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:47,941
You don't still miss
your old school?

395
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,746
No, it's more like
I miss missing it.

396
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:55,549
Uncle Richard,
want to help me fly it?

397
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:57,612
Richard:
Let's get it up there.

398
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:00,989
Keep it away
from the trees.

399
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:03,187
So what was
this word you said?

400
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:06,459
Reeservoier.
It's a science word, Uncle Richard.

401
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:09,058
We'Ve been learning about
natural resources in school.

402
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:11,535
Oh, you mean
a "reserVoir."

403
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,802
Well, that's a lot like a lake,
only it's a man-made lake.

404
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,207
But I thought God
made eVerything.

405
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:20,302
Well, in a way He did,
if you belieVe He created

406
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:23,405
those people who figured out
how to make a reserVoir, right?

407
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:25,712
- Jessie: Bye, guys, thank you.
- Boy #1: See you later, Adam!

408
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:28,686
- Man: Thanks, Paul, see you later.
- Hey, kiddo!

409
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,550
Boy #1 : Bye, Adam!

410
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:32,318
Why don't you come on inside,
say goodbye to your friends?

411
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:34,450
Boy #2:
Thank you, Adam.

412
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,691
Boy #3:
Bye, Adam!

413
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:43,892
- Bye.
- Bye, Paul.

414
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,835
Girl: Adam!

415
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:50,303
Bye!

416
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:58,874
Hey!

417
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,387
Birthday Boy!

418
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:03,945
How many times
I gotta tell you,

419
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:05,456
you can't leaVe
your toys around?

420
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,390
Somebody's
gonna trip and--

421
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:11,525
( chuckles )

422
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:14,464
For those of us who don't wear
helmets in the house...

423
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:20,533
What you doing?

424
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:26,977
Where did you get this?

425
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:29,606
It was a birthday present
from Joey Smoyer.

426
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:31,809
Do you like it?

427
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:34,650
Yeah.

428
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:38,188
Why don't you
get some sleep?

429
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:41,392
Dad, I'Ve been thinking...

430
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:43,087
About what?

431
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:47,258
I don't think I like you
so much anymore.

432
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:58,499
- No...
- Gotcha!

433
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:01,910
Ohh, somebody is in
some Very serious trouble.

434
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:03,414
Where do you think you're going?
Where do you think you're going?

435
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:05,183
- I'm gonna smother you now.
- Stop it, Dad!

436
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,182
( water running )

437
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:12,582
It's just in...
some ways,

438
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:14,649
he's so much the same,
you know?

439
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:20,020
But he's still
his own person entirely.

440
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:22,932
And then...
Iook at him.

441
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:25,459
I honestly forget
sometimes, you know?

442
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:27,495
And then something
like that--

443
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,473
that toy dinosaur thing
will happen.

444
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:31,942
Jessie: It's okay,
it happens to me too.

445
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:34,411
- I just worry, you know?
- What?

446
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:37,381
- If he eVer found out.
- He won't find out.

447
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:40,009
What if he did?

448
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:41,541
About what it would
mean to him.

449
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:44,054
Ijust love him so much.

450
00:30:45,157 --> 00:30:47,853
Both of you.

451
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:58,595
Meow!

452
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:25,387
( laughing )

453
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:29,627
( groaning )

454
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:36,973
( children chanting )

455
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:48,713
( both moaning )

456
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,588
( floor creaks )

457
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:07,832
No!

458
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:13,940
No! Help!

459
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:16,072
- ( laughter)
- Paul: Adam!

460
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:19,106
- ( knocking )
- Adam!

461
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,983
It's okay,
I'm right here.

462
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,681
Adam:
Who are you?

463
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,817
Dad!

464
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:29,850
- Adam!
- No.

465
00:32:33,365 --> 00:32:36,198
Mom!

466
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:37,826
Adam?

467
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:41,766
Oh my God!
Adam!

468
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:48,171
( panting )

469
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:52,340
( screams )
Ow!

470
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,045
- Jesus, take it easy!
- Go away!

471
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:55,518
- It's okay, okay!
- No!

472
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:57,612
- It's okay, take it easy.
- Stay away! Get away!

473
00:32:57,656 --> 00:33:00,784
- Jessie! It's okay.
- Get away from me!

474
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:04,428
- It's okay! Okay, okay!
- Get off!

475
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:06,623
- All right! It's okay.
- Get off me.

476
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:08,189
- Jessie!
- Honey?!

477
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:11,293
- Adam: Ow!
- Oh, God!

478
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:13,497
- Adam? Adam?
- What happened?

479
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:15,506
I don't know,
he just collapsed.

480
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,838
- Call 911!
- I'm calling Richard.

481
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:28,917
( heart monitor beeping )

482
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:38,522
Paul: Richard, thank God.
I want him in a hospital.

483
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:40,326
Paul, my staff and I
can handle this.

484
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:41,923
Your staff don't eVen
know about this.

485
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:43,729
They don't need to.
It's the same as always--

486
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:45,633
we're close friends.
You know our arrangement.

487
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,399
Maybe we need to reconsider
our arrangement.

488
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:49,134
It's fiVe hours,
he's still unconscious.

489
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:52,302
His respiration and color are good and
he's responding to low-leVel stimuli.

490
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:53,606
He's basically
just sleeping.

491
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:55,977
Except for some reason,
he's not waking up.

492
00:33:56,014 --> 00:33:58,812
- He seems to haVe night terrors.
- Night terrors?

493
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,841
It's a sleep disorder.
A child screams in his sleep.

494
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:04,048
He may sit up, walk, eVen talk, but
all attempts to wake him are futile.

495
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:06,580
No, no, you weren't there.
This is something entirely different.

496
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:08,091
All right...

497
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:09,616
hold on a minute.

498
00:34:09,661 --> 00:34:11,390
I know it's scary,
but we talked about this--

499
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:13,954
the possibility
that things could change

500
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:17,126
once Adam crossed the age
at which he died.

501
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:20,137
Well, it's been eight years.
As ofnow, he's crossed it.

502
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:23,334
You said things could change--
you neVer said anything like this.

503
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,002
Because I couldn't
haVe known.

504
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:27,068
Look, he is
the only one, period.

505
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:29,603
We are and always have been
at the mercy ofthat fact.

506
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:32,207
Up to this point, we'Ve had a map--
Adam's first eight years.

507
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,184
But now we're entering
uncharted territory.

508
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:37,347
We haVe no way of knowing
who the Adam of age nine, age 10,

509
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,653
age 50,
is going to be,

510
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:42,023
what problems he may
or may not haVe.

511
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,961
I promise you, there's nothing more
a hospital would be doing for him.

512
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,759
What's happening
here, Richard?

513
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:49,665
That's what I'd like to find out.
My feeling is it's probably nothing.

514
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:52,693
Let's just giVe it
a little time, okay?

515
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:56,297
Yeah.

516
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:06,878
The last eight years...

517
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:10,718
no matter how happy
I'Ve been,

518
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:15,454
I'Ve always had this feeling that
somehow we wouldn't get away with this.

519
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:18,929
Not that someone
would find out,

520
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:20,931
just...

521
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:23,433
somehow,
we'd lose him again.

522
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:26,627
We're not gonna lose him.

523
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:28,662
We're not gonna lose him.

524
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:35,809
It's okay, it's okay.

525
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:39,078
( heart monitor beeping )

526
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:19,055
- ( children laughing )
- ( screams )

527
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:32,627
Boo!

528
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,161
- Oh, Adam!
- Oh my gosh!

529
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:37,299
- Hey.
- But no, no, no-- is he all right?

530
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:39,242
- He's fine.
- You okay?

531
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:41,677
I'm feeling hungry!

532
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:43,578
- ( laughing )
- Mommy!

533
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:45,981
- Come on, kiddo.
- EVerything's okay.

534
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:49,145
This is fantastic, fantastic.
Come on, come on.

535
00:36:49,187 --> 00:36:50,848
( both grunting )

536
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:52,857
- You feel good?
- Adam: Ahh!

537
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:54,825
My God,
you slept enough.

538
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:57,487
- Richard, thank you.
- I'll see you all tomorrow.

539
00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:59,463
( birds chirping )

540
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,842
Paul:
Adam, dinner's on.

541
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:27,517
Jessie,
he's not up here.

542
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:53,175
Paul: Adam!

543
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:58,254
Hey, come on.

544
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,888
Adam!

545
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:10,958
Hey!

546
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:26,374
Adam?

547
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:56,941
Adam? Adam!

548
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:09,087
Adam?

549
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,735
There you are.

550
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:19,964
What are you doing here?

551
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:21,801
Didn't you hear me
calling you?

552
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,306
Hey...

553
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:26,337
are you all right?

554
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:27,844
I'm talking to you.

555
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:35,312
Adam?

556
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:37,014
Hey, I'm talking to you.

557
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:38,352
Hey!

558
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:40,550
Answer me.

559
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:42,889
Yes, Daddy?

560
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:47,057
Did you hear me calling you?

561
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:52,158
Your dinner is ready.
Go in the house.

562
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:18,159
( chains rattling )

563
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:35,042
Jessie: No, Paul just said it was
kind of a strange moment.

564
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,639
No, he seems fine.

565
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:40,207
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping--
it's probably nothing.

566
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:43,186
I don't think it's anything
to worry about, okay?

567
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:45,382
All right, take care
and I'll see you soon.

568
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:48,688
All right, well, thanks,
Richard. Take care.

569
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:54,459
I think we should
take him to a specialist.

570
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:56,865
Richard doesn't think
it's anything to worry about.

571
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:57,925
And his word's gospel?

572
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:03,165
How long are we supposed
to liVe like this?

573
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:07,876
When does
all this gratitude end?

574
00:41:36,207 --> 00:41:39,040
( children chattering )

575
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:46,707
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

576
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:48,981
- You sure?
- Yeah.

577
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,045
Bye, Mom.

578
00:41:53,224 --> 00:41:55,419
- ( door slams )
- ( chatter )

579
00:42:17,114 --> 00:42:19,412
( chatter intensifies )

580
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,416
- ( screeching )
- Anybody know what this is?

581
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:29,825
It's a big ugly Visual aide.
Let's do it like this.

582
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:32,591
If you think of DNA
as a fuse box,

583
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,929
aach of the genes are either
switched on or off,

584
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:38,936
depending on which cell
we're talking about.

585
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:43,737
So that the genes responsible
for say the length of KeVin's...

586
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:45,264
( chuckles )

587
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:48,278
...nose hair wouldn't be
much use in his pinky toe.

588
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:50,041
So what, the gene
isn't present?

589
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:53,642
No, no, it's present,
it's just inactiVe. It's turned off.

590
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:58,217
It's dead.

591
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:02,850
You know what?

592
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:06,261
Why don't you just
take a look at chapter 11

593
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:09,494
for the rest of the period
and then, you know, go?

594
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:11,057
( door closes )

595
00:43:11,102 --> 00:43:13,502
Boy #1 : I'm going to put on
a little show for you guys

596
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:15,471
and you're going
to pay me your lunch money.

597
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,474
So pay me and if you don't,

598
00:43:17,508 --> 00:43:20,534
I'll beat the crap out of you
for the rest of your life.

599
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:22,808
Boy #2:
How about this? No.

600
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:25,907
Boy #1 :
How about... yes! Ha-ha!

601
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:29,477
What are you going to do about it, huh?
You're a tiny little boy.

602
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:40,828
What if his haVing outliVed
the life of that first original cell

603
00:43:40,865 --> 00:43:43,561
has somehow allowed some dormant
problem to be switched on?

604
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:45,762
Listen, maybe it's significant,
maybe it isn't,

605
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:48,237
But the fact remains that any changes
in health or behaVior

606
00:43:48,272 --> 00:43:50,536
Could haVe occurred
naturally the last time as well.

607
00:43:50,574 --> 00:43:52,565
- These night terrors--
- If that's what they are.

608
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,168
Paul, it's a common
sleep disorder.

609
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:55,769
If there's anything
he isn't, it's common.

610
00:43:55,813 --> 00:43:57,144
What do you want me
to say, Paul?

611
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:59,240
That there's something
seriously wrong with him?

612
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:02,081
- You don't think I'm just as concerned?
- No. No, I don't.

613
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:03,711
You haVe eVery right to worry.

614
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:05,722
But for eight years,
we'Ve known what to expect.

615
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:07,781
Most parents neVer haVe
the benefit of hindsight.

616
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:09,793
From now on,
neither do we.

617
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:12,159
- "We"?
- You know what I meant.

618
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:14,790
Can I get back
to my patients, please?

619
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:19,895
EVer want to haVe any children
of your own, Richard?

620
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:23,396
Jessie's always saying
how great you are with Adam.

621
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:25,375
- It seems like such a shame.
- Paul, he's your son.

622
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:27,434
BelieVe me, I know
what he means to you.

623
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:30,572
But maybe you can keep in mind
what he does mean to me.

624
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:44,717
- Mother: Here they come.
- Jessie: Oh, hey there! There you are.

625
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,027
Jessie:
Why so glum, chum?

626
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:50,863
Adam: There's this new kid,
Roy Hazen,

627
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:52,960
he's always showing off,

628
00:44:53,004 --> 00:44:56,906
Iike how high he goes
on the swings and stuff.

629
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:59,569
- He's a total ass wipe.
- Hey!

630
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,874
Where did you learn
that language?

631
00:45:01,912 --> 00:45:03,539
I don't know.

632
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:06,778
I don't like it.
Get in the car.

633
00:45:23,801 --> 00:45:25,359
- Whoa!
- ( tires screeching )

634
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:29,873
- Oh, God!
- Adam.

635
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:31,932
- Are you all right? Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

636
00:45:31,976 --> 00:45:33,568
- Adam!
- I didn't see you.

637
00:45:33,611 --> 00:45:35,772
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I didn't see you.

638
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:38,111
I came so close to hitting you.
Do you know that?

639
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:40,674
Do you know you could haVe
been killed just now? Do you?

640
00:45:40,718 --> 00:45:43,414
- How many times do I got to tell you...
- Daddy, you're hurting me!

641
00:45:43,454 --> 00:45:45,445
- to keep your bicycle off the street?
- Paul!

642
00:45:45,489 --> 00:45:47,548
What's the matter with you?

643
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:54,063
- You okay, honey?
- Yes.

644
00:45:54,098 --> 00:45:56,157
You sure?

645
00:46:39,043 --> 00:46:40,806
( cell phone ringing )

646
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:44,537
Hello?

647
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:25,851
Yeah, I would, actually.
Let me get a pen.

648
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,518
Dr. Lieber?

649
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,460
Okay. In Beauford?

650
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,228
Great.
Sam, I appreciate this.

651
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:37,393
Talk to you soon. Bye.

652
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:39,595
Who's that?

653
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:41,161
Wrong number.

654
00:47:44,408 --> 00:47:47,104
( door squeaks open )

655
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:43,592
( floor creaking )

656
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:13,122
Paul: Adam!

657
00:49:13,163 --> 00:49:14,255
( gasps )

658
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:18,692
Adam?

659
00:49:21,805 --> 00:49:23,602
Adam, open the door.

660
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:25,404
Open the door, son.

661
00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:28,673
Open the door!

662
00:49:28,712 --> 00:49:30,612
Adam?

663
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:32,309
Open the door.

664
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:34,715
God damn it!
Open the door, son.

665
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:37,585
- ( shrieks )
- ( screams )

666
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,350
( screams )

667
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:43,958
What--
why is the door locked?

668
00:49:43,994 --> 00:49:46,485
- What?
- How-- the curtain.

669
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,225
- What?
- The curtain. He was under there.

670
00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:50,199
No, no, no, no, look.

671
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:52,259
What are you talking about?

672
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:54,863
- Look, it's fine.
- No, no.

673
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:56,338
Don't let him hurt me.

674
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:57,533
Shh, there's nobody
going to hurt you.

675
00:49:57,574 --> 00:49:59,303
Look, look, look, it's okay.

676
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:02,312
Shh, calm down.

677
00:50:02,346 --> 00:50:05,110
It's all right. I think you just
had a bad dream.

678
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:07,140
- No.
- Huh?

679
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:09,675
- I saw it.
- What?

680
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,712
What did you see?

681
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:16,726
Adam, talk to me.

682
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,728
Please.

683
00:50:18,762 --> 00:50:22,220
Please, you got to talk to me. I can't
help you if I don't know what this is.

684
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:27,236
I just-- I know something.

685
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:30,502
Okay, what?

686
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:33,169
What is it?

687
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,440
Something bad
is going to happen.

688
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:36,969
No, it's not.

689
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:40,177
I'll neVer let anything bad
eVer happen to you.

690
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:44,116
Not to me.

691
00:50:47,491 --> 00:50:50,858
Listen to me, you're my son,
you understand that?

692
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:53,055
Huh?

693
00:50:53,097 --> 00:50:56,157
- Say it.
- I'm your son.

694
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,260
That's right.
We're gonna be okay.

695
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,068
We're going to be okay.

696
00:51:05,376 --> 00:51:07,776
Doctor: So, how many eggs
did you retrieVe?

697
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:10,177
I only retrieVed three.
I thought that would be enough--

698
00:51:10,214 --> 00:51:12,580
- Richard, hi.
- Hi.

699
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:14,208
I'm sorry
if this is a bad time.

700
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:15,980
No, it's fine.

701
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:17,748
- Excuse us.
- Sure.

702
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:20,450
What's the matter?
You look--

703
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:23,824
I need to speak with you
about something...

704
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:26,329
I haVe to stop off
at home for some papers.

705
00:51:26,363 --> 00:51:28,126
Why don't I fix us
some lunch?

706
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:30,565
( children chattering )

707
00:51:33,504 --> 00:51:36,439
Hey, hey,
how would you like that?

708
00:51:38,542 --> 00:51:40,100
Ijust got an idea.

709
00:51:40,144 --> 00:51:41,873
How about we haVe
a swinging contest?

710
00:51:41,912 --> 00:51:43,971
- All: Yeah!
- You guys will be the judges.

711
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:46,005
- We'll make it Very fair.
- Yeah.

712
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:48,347
Ladies first.

713
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:50,444
Ha ha.

714
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:57,757
Don't go too high,
you'll start crying.

715
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:02,161
Don't break a nail,
oh, no!

716
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:04,531
- Come on, you chicken.
- ( spitting )

717
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:07,696
- Oh, what's that for?
- Nasty monkey.

718
00:52:07,738 --> 00:52:10,969
Adam Duncan, you stop that at once!
No spitting.

719
00:52:11,008 --> 00:52:13,602
Come on, come down
from there.

720
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:15,942
Come down.
Come down right now.

721
00:52:15,979 --> 00:52:18,470
No-- hey!

722
00:52:18,515 --> 00:52:21,313
- ( kids laughing )
- Hey...

723
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:23,478
Adam?

724
00:52:27,357 --> 00:52:29,325
So what you're saying,
these nightmares

725
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,350
might haVe started
at this age anyway?

726
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:34,296
Or possibly triggered
by any number of things--

727
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:41,603
school, stress,
tension at home.

728
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:43,401
Yeah, well...

729
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,534
Paul is conVinced that
somehow Adam's cells haVe--

730
00:52:46,577 --> 00:52:49,273
Retained memories
of his first life?

731
00:52:49,313 --> 00:52:51,975
There's an often cited
experiment--

732
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:54,347
a rat was trained
to run a maze,

733
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:57,251
killed, then ground up
and fed to a second rat.

734
00:52:57,287 --> 00:52:59,881
The second rat, when presented
with the same maze,

735
00:52:59,923 --> 00:53:01,857
completed it
in record time,

736
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:05,055
proVing that memory liVed on
in those ingested cells.

737
00:53:05,095 --> 00:53:08,155
It's fascinating, really,

738
00:53:08,198 --> 00:53:10,166
also a bunch of nonsense--

739
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,101
an urban legend.

740
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:15,536
So, it's not possible
he's remembering?

741
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:18,200
No, no.

742
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:20,369
Thank God.

743
00:53:22,713 --> 00:53:26,012
Frankly, I'm more
concerned about Paul's

744
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:29,314
working up
these strange theories.

745
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:32,652
Paul is just haVing
a tough time right now.

746
00:53:38,929 --> 00:53:41,022
It's good.

747
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:44,625
He's neVer felt as comfortable here
as you, has he?

748
00:53:47,104 --> 00:53:48,401
No.

749
00:53:52,442 --> 00:53:55,377
You don't think he'd
eVer try to leaVe, do you?

750
00:53:56,547 --> 00:53:59,710
Jessie, that can't happen.

751
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,741
Out here
in the middle of nowhere,

752
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:04,777
it's easy to forget the consequences
of what we'Ve done.

753
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:06,686
But if anyone
eVer found out,

754
00:54:06,723 --> 00:54:09,851
you might
never see Adam again.

755
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:12,792
I know.

756
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:14,956
I can trust you
to rein Paul in?

757
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:17,096
Yes.

758
00:54:20,137 --> 00:54:23,698
Woman: Okay, well, I'll go ahead
and see ifthe auditorium's available.

759
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,332
Right.

760
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:27,906
Sorry, I just got
the message.

761
00:54:27,945 --> 00:54:29,572
They called me
at the high school.

762
00:54:29,613 --> 00:54:31,342
Apparently,
they couldn't reach you?

763
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:34,714
- I was out. How's Adam?
- He's fine, Mrs. Duncan.

764
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,844
I haVe him waiting
in my office right now.

765
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:39,378
I don't know exactly
how to say this, but...

766
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:42,290
his behavior has distanced
some ofthe other children.

767
00:54:42,326 --> 00:54:45,090
And the thing is, he could haVe
seriously injured himself.

768
00:54:45,128 --> 00:54:47,494
Let's go in
and see him, okay?

769
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:49,761
Is that wine
on your breath?

770
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,496
- I was haVing lunch.
- With who?

771
00:54:55,772 --> 00:54:58,502
Jessie:
Why are you so upset?

772
00:54:58,542 --> 00:55:00,567
It was just lunch.

773
00:55:00,611 --> 00:55:03,205
I just wanted to talk to him
about Adam.

774
00:55:04,348 --> 00:55:07,408
God, Paul.

775
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:09,715
Wait, where are we going?

776
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:12,119
To get a second opinion.

777
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:18,260
Are you kidding me?

778
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:20,388
Am I smiling?

779
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:25,531
Lieber:
About these night terrors...

780
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:27,230
you're confident
that's what this is?

781
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,761
I see it in a number
of kids Adam's age.

782
00:55:29,806 --> 00:55:33,537
Scares the bejesus out of the parents,
but the kids outgrow it.

783
00:55:33,577 --> 00:55:36,978
As for Adam's recent changes
in behaVior, well, he's poorly rested--

784
00:55:37,014 --> 00:55:39,881
No, you don't know him.
This is something else.

785
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:45,946
He won't leaVe me alone.

786
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:47,718
- Lieber: Who?
- Adam: Zachary.

787
00:55:47,758 --> 00:55:49,157
Zachary?!

788
00:55:49,192 --> 00:55:52,719
Mr. Duncan, who is Zachary?
ls he a boy in his class?

789
00:55:52,763 --> 00:55:54,993
I don't know.
Honey, who is Zachary?

790
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:01,098
He's the boy
who liVes in my dreams.

791
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:07,404
Paul: Talk to me, pal. This boy
told you his name was Zachary?

792
00:56:07,444 --> 00:56:11,175
Not really,
I kind of just know.

793
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:13,239
And you'Ve neVer
seen his face?

794
00:56:13,283 --> 00:56:15,342
He doesn't like
to show it,

795
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:17,683
but I know
because of his jacket.

796
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:19,154
What kind of jacket?

797
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:21,157
Just let him answer.

798
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:23,682
It's red with white sleeVes.

799
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:32,166
Adam: Where are we going?
Where are we going?

800
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:34,261
Where's who going, Adam?

801
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:37,873
- Adam?
- Zachary.

802
00:56:37,908 --> 00:56:40,103
Zachary?

803
00:56:40,143 --> 00:56:43,544
- And where are you?
- Where we liVe.

804
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,878
I don't want to do this.
This is crazy.

805
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,111
According to who?
Richard?

806
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:50,813
Listen, there's something
he's not telling us, Jessie, I know it.

807
00:56:50,854 --> 00:56:53,220
The way he is handling this,
the way he stays so close to us.

808
00:56:53,256 --> 00:56:54,348
- He cares about us.
- I don't--

809
00:56:54,391 --> 00:56:56,484
Zachary, Zachary,
where are you?

810
00:56:58,295 --> 00:57:00,889
- Tell me about Zachary.
- He's neVer eVen known a Zachary.

811
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:07,199
What are you trying
to tell us, Adam? Say it.

812
00:57:07,237 --> 00:57:10,035
- ( mumbling )
- Say it!

813
00:57:10,073 --> 00:57:12,974
- That's enough, stop it.
- Tell us what you're trying to say.

814
00:57:14,644 --> 00:57:16,908
If you don't understand it,
how do you expect to beat it?

815
00:57:16,947 --> 00:57:18,938
- I don't want to understand it.
- You're dead!

816
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:21,576
- ( truck horn blaring )
- Paul, watch out!

817
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:28,121
( tires screeching )

818
00:57:28,158 --> 00:57:31,127
( panting )

819
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:35,291
Are you okay?
Honey, you okay?

820
00:57:35,332 --> 00:57:38,631
- Is he all right?
- He's okay.

821
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:41,501
You're all right,
you're okay.

822
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:43,301
( panting )

823
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,069
I'm sorry.

824
00:57:45,108 --> 00:57:48,942
Okay, kiddo,
there you go.

825
00:57:48,979 --> 00:57:51,914
You're home now,
all right?

826
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:54,781
You just go to sleep,
all right?

827
00:57:54,818 --> 00:57:56,945
Dad...

828
00:57:56,987 --> 00:57:59,353
did I die?

829
00:58:04,928 --> 00:58:07,954
Of course not.

830
00:58:07,998 --> 00:58:10,592
You'Ve been
right here with us.

831
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:15,164
Go to sleep.

832
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:23,840
Oh my God,
that's what this is.

833
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,907
He's remembering
his first life in his dreams.

834
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:31,148
- Kids say things like that.
- A boy? ln the city?

835
00:58:31,188 --> 00:58:33,247
Jesus, it's possible.

836
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,554
If certain genes from the cell
used in the procedure

837
00:58:35,592 --> 00:58:37,355
managed to retain
certain memories...

838
00:58:37,394 --> 00:58:39,328
- He's not remembering.
- How can you say that?

839
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,227
Because he can't.

840
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,810
( door squeaks )

841
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,495
Honey, wake up.
We're at school.

842
00:59:24,507 --> 00:59:27,203
Female teacher: Okay now, I want
to see everyone in your family

843
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:30,645
outside your houses
in the pictures, okay?

844
00:59:32,115 --> 00:59:34,515
Take your time.

845
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,951
Lots of colors.

846
00:59:36,987 --> 00:59:39,251
And don't forget
to write your name on it.

847
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:42,190
Nice and big. I want to put these up
around the classroom.

848
00:59:42,225 --> 00:59:43,886
Beautiful.

849
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:45,758
You can put pets
in your pictures--

850
00:59:45,795 --> 00:59:49,492
dogs and cats.
Have some fun.

851
01:00:04,047 --> 01:00:07,073
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi, Jessie.

852
01:00:07,117 --> 01:00:09,347
I just thought I'd stop by
to see how the stuff's doing.

853
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:11,479
Come in.

854
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:13,955
Very well. Richard Wells
was in yesterday.

855
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:18,188
He bought this big one and
these three small ones on the spot.

856
01:00:18,228 --> 01:00:20,458
- That's great.
- ( cell phone rings )

857
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:23,022
Excuse me a second.
Hello.

858
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:26,160
- Hi.
- Richard, hi.

859
01:00:26,202 --> 01:00:28,500
I just thought I'd see
how Adam's doing.

860
01:00:28,538 --> 01:00:30,904
Not so well, actually.

861
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:35,469
He had another
night terror last night.

862
01:00:35,512 --> 01:00:37,707
Paul even managed
to get him talking this time.

863
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:39,647
I'm wondering
if we can use his ability

864
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:41,810
to Vocalize in that
state to our adVantage.

865
01:00:41,851 --> 01:00:43,785
I don't know.
What would that entail?

866
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,812
Well, for starters, I'd like you
to bring him in again.

867
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:48,915
I'm not sure Paul would be
comfortable with that.

868
01:00:48,959 --> 01:00:50,722
But I thought we agreed
you're gonna try to rein him in.

869
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,729
- I know we did. I'll talk to him, okay?
- Please do.

870
01:00:53,763 --> 01:00:55,754
I need to go, Richard.
Good bye.

871
01:00:57,767 --> 01:00:59,860
( children yelling )

872
01:01:25,495 --> 01:01:28,953
Come on, you guys,
let's go!

873
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:32,992
Come on, you chickens!
Wussies! Let's go!

874
01:01:33,036 --> 01:01:36,563
I'm doing it!
You can too!

875
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:39,769
Are you afraid ofsomething?
Let's go!

876
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:44,337
Come on, let's go!
Jeez, buddy!

877
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:59,417
Let's go!
Come on, come on!

878
01:01:59,462 --> 01:02:01,760
Come on, I'm doing it!
You can!

879
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:06,201
What are you, babies?
You want your ba-ba? Let's go!

880
01:02:06,236 --> 01:02:11,435
( steel balls clanging )

881
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:48,502
( clanging continues )

882
01:03:07,864 --> 01:03:11,027
Who's there?

883
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:39,852
Oh, no.

884
01:04:25,808 --> 01:04:28,242
( children laughing )

885
01:04:47,864 --> 01:04:49,832
Please be okay.

886
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:52,334
Please don't touch this.

887
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:01,909
(Adam, Paul and Jessie
laughing )

888
01:05:10,553 --> 01:05:12,145
Jessie?

889
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:18,055
You down there?

890
01:05:28,104 --> 01:05:30,732
- Did you hear me?
- Huh?

891
01:05:30,773 --> 01:05:35,301
- You okay?
- Are you hungry?

892
01:05:35,345 --> 01:05:37,074
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

893
01:05:38,481 --> 01:05:41,416
Yeah.
You hungry?

894
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:50,487
- ( telephone ringing )
- Jessie: Hello?

895
01:05:52,295 --> 01:05:55,696
No, I'm sorry, Tanya,
he isn't.

896
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:58,166
Tanya, slow down.

897
01:05:58,201 --> 01:06:00,294
Hold on, I'll ask him
right now. Hold on.

898
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:09,500
Adam, roy's mother says
he hasn't come home from school yet.

899
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:12,139
- Do you know where he might be?
- No.

900
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:13,739
Wait, wait, wait.

901
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:16,479
What were you doing down
at the riVer this afternoon?

902
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,480
Just playing.

903
01:06:21,891 --> 01:06:23,188
With who?

904
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:27,753
I'm not supposed to say.

905
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:31,527
Adam, can you answer me?

906
01:06:36,606 --> 01:06:38,574
Go to your room.

907
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:41,042
Now!

908
01:06:49,786 --> 01:06:51,720
I'm sorry, Tanya,
he doesn't know.

909
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:56,892
Yeah, good luck.

910
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:01,721
You said Richard mentioned
using his ability

911
01:07:01,764 --> 01:07:03,163
to Vocalize
to find out more.

912
01:07:04,267 --> 01:07:07,236
Call him.
We'll bring Adam in tomorrow.

913
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:18,104
Adam, what's the name
of the school?

914
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:21,116
Can you tell me
the name of the school?

915
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:25,917
( mumbles )

916
01:07:25,955 --> 01:07:27,513
Pius...

917
01:07:27,557 --> 01:07:30,082
S-s-street.

918
01:07:30,126 --> 01:07:32,094
Could it be
Saint Pius?

919
01:07:32,128 --> 01:07:34,096
Are you sure this
can't hurt him?

920
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:36,724
It's a mild tranquilizer.
We're just poking around

921
01:07:36,766 --> 01:07:39,132
to see what we dig up.
Right Paul?

922
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,531
Yeah.

923
01:07:46,943 --> 01:07:48,911
Adam...

924
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:51,607
is Zachary in there?

925
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:53,638
In school?

926
01:07:59,756 --> 01:08:01,451
They all are.

927
01:08:06,062 --> 01:08:09,156
( children laughing )

928
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:12,863
They all are.

929
01:08:12,902 --> 01:08:15,962
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

930
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:19,839
Z-zachary.

931
01:08:21,811 --> 01:08:23,108
Clark.

932
01:08:23,146 --> 01:08:26,240
Adam:
Z-zach...

933
01:08:26,282 --> 01:08:27,977
We know this name?
Zachary Clark?

934
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:29,951
Paul:
Who is Zachary Clark?

935
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:32,284
( match ignites )

936
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:35,719
( girls screaming )

937
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:37,316
They think I'm him.

938
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,123
Are you him?

939
01:08:39,162 --> 01:08:41,153
Are you Zachary?

940
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:46,328
Who are you?

941
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:49,130
They think I'm him.

942
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:51,800
- ( laughing )
- They think I'm him!

943
01:08:51,841 --> 01:08:53,570
( laughing )

944
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:55,236
They think I'm him!

945
01:08:55,278 --> 01:08:57,109
-They think I'm him!
- ( girl screaming )

946
01:08:57,146 --> 01:08:58,977
- Adam: No!
- Paul: Adam!

947
01:08:59,015 --> 01:09:01,108
- Adam?
- Jessie: Richard, release him.

948
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:02,845
- It's hurting him.
- Adam? Wake up.

949
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:05,445
- Adam: Hot! Hot!
- Paul: Wake up, honey. Adam?

950
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:07,683
Goddamn it,
do something! Adam?

951
01:09:07,723 --> 01:09:08,951
( screaming )

952
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,619
- Adam: Hot! Hot!
- Adam, wake up. Adam?

953
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:14,528
- Zachary?
- ( breathing slows )

954
01:09:14,564 --> 01:09:16,555
Honey?

955
01:09:19,135 --> 01:09:21,228
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

956
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:27,571
Paul:
You're okay. You're okay.

957
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:36,914
Paul:
Hey, why'd you call him Zachary?

958
01:09:36,953 --> 01:09:39,285
Answer me, Richard.

959
01:09:39,322 --> 01:09:41,449
Because he wasn't responding
to his own name.

960
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:43,755
That's bullshit!
I want the truth.

961
01:09:43,793 --> 01:09:45,385
- You set me up!
- It's okay, it's okay.

962
01:09:45,428 --> 01:09:48,261
You needed my okay to push him,
but you wanted him pushed. Why?

963
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:51,061
- Paul, you'Ve gone completely--
- Stop telling me what's wrong with me,

964
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,194
and tell me what's wrong
with my goddamn son!

965
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,135
Paul...

966
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:01,803
I wish I could help you.

967
01:10:01,844 --> 01:10:04,506
Adam's changing.

968
01:10:04,547 --> 01:10:07,015
He's getting worse.

969
01:10:07,049 --> 01:10:09,950
Sometimes it's like
there's two of him.

970
01:10:09,986 --> 01:10:11,954
He's destructiVe.

971
01:10:11,988 --> 01:10:13,421
He's tried to harm himself.

972
01:10:13,456 --> 01:10:15,924
The other kids at school
are scared of him, Richard.

973
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:19,418
( sighs )

974
01:10:19,462 --> 01:10:21,453
There's something
you're not telling us.

975
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:24,858
There haVe been times
I'Ve seen you talking to him

976
01:10:24,901 --> 01:10:29,338
and he's in that same blank state,
but he listens to you, doesn't he, huh?

977
01:10:29,372 --> 01:10:31,033
Don't push me, Richard.

978
01:10:31,073 --> 01:10:33,633
Adam's all I care about
in the whole world.

979
01:10:33,676 --> 01:10:37,043
I'll go public if I don't get some
answers soon, you understand that?

980
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:39,377
You understand I'll go public?

981
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:41,246
I'm not kidding.

982
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:44,981
I swear to God, I'll tell the whole
goddamn world what you'Ve done.

983
01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:51,927
What we've done, Paul.

984
01:10:51,961 --> 01:10:54,156
What we've done.

985
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:10,734
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is remembering.

986
01:11:12,315 --> 01:11:14,283
Or maybe it's
something else.

987
01:11:14,317 --> 01:11:17,650
Why that name,
Zachary Clark, or the school?

988
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:19,678
Look, I haVe tomorrow off,

989
01:11:19,722 --> 01:11:21,485
It's a few hours driVe
into the city.

990
01:11:21,524 --> 01:11:23,719
- I'm gonna look into it.
- No, Paul, absolutely not.

991
01:11:23,759 --> 01:11:26,193
- If Richard found out--
- He won't. I'll leaVe in the morning.

992
01:11:26,228 --> 01:11:27,422
- I won't be back until afternoon.
- Paul, no.

993
01:11:27,463 --> 01:11:29,454
Hold on.

994
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:32,228
(police radio chatter)

995
01:11:32,268 --> 01:11:35,169
Woman:
No! No!

996
01:11:35,204 --> 01:11:37,104
( woman sobbing )

997
01:11:37,139 --> 01:11:40,472
Woman:
Let me go! Let me go!

998
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:46,879
Woman:
Nooo! No!

999
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:50,443
My baby!

1000
01:11:52,288 --> 01:11:55,086
Woman:
Let me go! Let me go!

1001
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:58,651
No! My baby!

1002
01:11:59,996 --> 01:12:02,089
My baby!

1003
01:12:03,499 --> 01:12:05,160
My baby!

1004
01:12:06,335 --> 01:12:08,394
My baby!

1005
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:14,005
No! No! My baby!

1006
01:12:40,102 --> 01:12:42,969
Paul:
Jessie, can I see you? Now?

1007
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:49,111
I told you.

1008
01:12:49,145 --> 01:12:51,443
( whispering )
What? It doesn't mean--

1009
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,641
You're the one who said he neVer
got along with that boy.

1010
01:12:53,683 --> 01:12:55,742
The twins said they saw Roy
playing down by the water,

1011
01:12:55,785 --> 01:12:57,116
that he'd been showing off.

1012
01:12:57,153 --> 01:12:59,178
They're all but sure
he fell in. You're not?

1013
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:01,621
I'm not sure of
anything right now.

1014
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:09,726
No matter what he does,
he's still our son.

1015
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:12,563
Do you find that
comforting right now?

1016
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:14,262
Huh?

1017
01:13:14,303 --> 01:13:15,895
What are you saying?

1018
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:17,599
You wish we'd
neVer done this?

1019
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:24,841
( whispering )
Good night, baby.

1020
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:29,747
Mommy loVes you.

1021
01:14:30,946 --> 01:14:32,937
You scared me.

1022
01:14:34,517 --> 01:14:36,610
It's okay, Mommy.

1023
01:14:53,068 --> 01:14:55,059
Shit.

1024
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:17,325
Sorry, there's nothing here.

1025
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:20,055
Are you sure this is
the only Saint Pius?

1026
01:15:20,095 --> 01:15:22,063
Well, it's the only one
in this city.

1027
01:15:22,097 --> 01:15:24,463
Like I said, they'Ve been
closed for some time now.

1028
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,799
What about past student records,
like a search by name?

1029
01:15:27,837 --> 01:15:29,395
I'm looking for
a Zachary Clark.

1030
01:15:29,438 --> 01:15:31,463
Well, by name could
take a while.

1031
01:15:31,507 --> 01:15:33,475
I can wait.

1032
01:15:33,509 --> 01:15:35,170
A few weeks?

1033
01:15:59,802 --> 01:16:02,100
(glass breaks )

1034
01:16:02,137 --> 01:16:05,402
( glass crunching )

1035
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:35,059
( children's voices )

1036
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:43,135
( children screaming )

1037
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:50,284
( children's voices continue )

1038
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:25,510
( doorbell rings )

1039
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:28,522
- Hi.
- Yes?

1040
01:17:28,557 --> 01:17:30,582
Sorry to bother you.
My name's Paul Duncan.

1041
01:17:30,626 --> 01:17:33,789
I know this sounds crazy,
but I'm here about Zachary Clark.

1042
01:17:33,829 --> 01:17:36,593
Does that name mean
anything to you?

1043
01:17:36,632 --> 01:17:39,260
- He's a young child, a boy.
- No, I'm sorry.

1044
01:17:39,301 --> 01:17:41,769
What about the preVious owners?
Did they haVe any children?

1045
01:17:41,804 --> 01:17:43,635
Melinda.

1046
01:17:43,672 --> 01:17:45,071
I'm sorry.

1047
01:17:47,977 --> 01:17:49,672
No, there were
no preVious owners.

1048
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:52,545
My husband and I bought this place
about six years ago

1049
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:54,208
when it was just
a burnt-down shell.

1050
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:56,046
And he's an architect,
so we restored it.

1051
01:17:56,085 --> 01:18:00,044
- So, it was just Vacant?
- Well, for a few years, yeah.

1052
01:18:00,089 --> 01:18:02,114
But I don't know anything
about its preVious owners.

1053
01:18:02,157 --> 01:18:03,818
- Right.
- I'm sorry.

1054
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:06,487
- I'm sorry, I just--
- I'm sorry to bother you.

1055
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:21,800
Sorry, the nanny--

1056
01:18:21,844 --> 01:18:24,711
we interViewed quite a few
nannies, mostly by phone,

1057
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:27,614
but I remember speaking to one who
I could haVe sworn said she used

1058
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:30,584
to work for the family
who used to liVe at this address.

1059
01:18:30,619 --> 01:18:33,019
I think that I saVed
her contact information, if--

1060
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:34,682
Great, thank you.

1061
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:47,258
Cora Williams?

1062
01:18:49,038 --> 01:18:51,529
You don't know me,
but I need to talk to you.

1063
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:55,376
It's about Zachary Clark.

1064
01:19:05,654 --> 01:19:07,645
Come in.

1065
01:19:30,412 --> 01:19:31,709
( answering machine beeps )

1066
01:19:31,747 --> 01:19:33,715
Machine Voice:
You haVe no messages.

1067
01:19:33,749 --> 01:19:35,080
Damn it!

1068
01:19:47,362 --> 01:19:50,388
Cora:
I had hoped I'd never
hear that name again.

1069
01:19:50,432 --> 01:19:52,423
What did he do?

1070
01:19:52,468 --> 01:19:54,629
There had been
incidents at school.

1071
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:58,663
He neVer had any friends, used
to come home with all sorts of scrapes.

1072
01:19:58,707 --> 01:20:01,403
Once they locked him
in an empty classroom.

1073
01:20:01,443 --> 01:20:04,435
A teacher finally found him,
terrified and shaken.

1074
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,074
But that was before
he started acting up.

1075
01:20:07,116 --> 01:20:09,346
Pretty soon,
those kids got wise

1076
01:20:09,384 --> 01:20:11,011
andjust left him alone.

1077
01:20:11,053 --> 01:20:12,953
Then there was the fire.

1078
01:20:12,988 --> 01:20:15,684
The fire at Saint Pius?

1079
01:20:15,724 --> 01:20:19,626
Cora:
They never found out how
the fire got started, but I knew.

1080
01:20:19,661 --> 01:20:23,062
And when Zachary came home,
I asked him about it.

1081
01:20:23,098 --> 01:20:25,259
Hejust gave me this smile.

1082
01:20:30,472 --> 01:20:32,463
Adam?

1083
01:20:34,243 --> 01:20:36,302
I swear, when I looked
into those eyes of his,

1084
01:20:36,345 --> 01:20:39,041
I didn't see anything
but eVil behind them.

1085
01:20:39,081 --> 01:20:41,845
Cora:
I kept my distance.

1086
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:44,512
I was scared ofwhat else
he might be capable of--

1087
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:47,488
all these terrible thoughts
running through my mind.

1088
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:54,328
( gasps )

1089
01:20:54,363 --> 01:20:56,729
It was just the two of us
at home that day.

1090
01:20:56,765 --> 01:20:58,460
He was taking his bath

1091
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,867
when it suddenly became
clear to me what I had to do.

1092
01:21:01,904 --> 01:21:03,895
He never even
heard me come in.

1093
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:25,360
( Zachary screams )

1094
01:21:25,394 --> 01:21:27,362
I tried
to go through with it.

1095
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:29,364
I swear I tried, but...

1096
01:21:29,398 --> 01:21:33,164
I just-- I couldn't.

1097
01:21:33,202 --> 01:21:36,865
I just couldn't.

1098
01:21:36,905 --> 01:21:37,963
When his mother came home,

1099
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:41,603
Zachary didn't say
a word about what I'd done.

1100
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:49,440
( floor creaks )

1101
01:21:50,619 --> 01:21:52,610
Are you here?

1102
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,814
I was at home the next day,

1103
01:21:56,858 --> 01:21:59,827
when I was struck
by the most awful premonition.

1104
01:21:59,861 --> 01:22:01,829
I hurried right over.

1105
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:04,297
Two blocks away, I could
already hear the sirens.

1106
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:06,301
Then I saw all that smoke.

1107
01:22:06,335 --> 01:22:08,701
I rushed into the house,

1108
01:22:08,737 --> 01:22:10,705
blinded by all those flames,

1109
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:12,707
praying I wasn't too late.

1110
01:22:12,741 --> 01:22:15,574
But you were.

1111
01:22:15,611 --> 01:22:18,705
It turned out his mother
was already dead by then.

1112
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:28,787
Cora:
I remember it was
freezing cold that day.

1113
01:22:28,824 --> 01:22:30,815
It was always cold
in that big house.

1114
01:22:32,961 --> 01:22:34,929
Adam?

1115
01:22:34,963 --> 01:22:37,397
Cora:
So she went down
the stairs to the basement,

1116
01:22:37,432 --> 01:22:39,525
to check on
the water heater.

1117
01:22:39,568 --> 01:22:41,934
Are you down there?

1118
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:44,370
Cora:
And that's where he was...

1119
01:22:44,406 --> 01:22:46,636
just waiting for her.

1120
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:51,777
So you're saying
Zachary killed his mother.

1121
01:22:51,813 --> 01:22:54,213
He used a hammer
he took down from the wall.

1122
01:22:56,485 --> 01:22:57,474
( screams )

1123
01:22:59,354 --> 01:23:02,084
And when he was done,

1124
01:23:02,124 --> 01:23:04,092
he set a fire.

1125
01:23:04,126 --> 01:23:06,321
Then he went upstairs

1126
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:08,591
and finished playing.

1127
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:12,191
That's where they
found his body.

1128
01:23:13,435 --> 01:23:15,630
Where was his father?

1129
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:18,196
Oh, he was at the hospital
like always.

1130
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,504
The hospital,
he was a doctor?

1131
01:23:20,542 --> 01:23:22,373
A baby doctor, yeah.

1132
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:26,177
Only, he seemed
more like a scientist to me.

1133
01:23:29,151 --> 01:23:33,087
( telephone ringing )

1134
01:23:35,424 --> 01:23:38,393
- Paul: Come on, come on.
- ( ringing continues )

1135
01:23:38,427 --> 01:23:39,894
Come on.

1136
01:23:39,928 --> 01:23:42,453
- ( telephone rings )
- ( machine beeps )

1137
01:23:42,497 --> 01:23:44,158
Goddamn it!

1138
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:46,667
Paul:
Are you home? Jessie?

1139
01:23:46,702 --> 01:23:47,669
Pick it up
ifyou're there, please.

1140
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:50,804
Listen, I gotta talk to you
right away, it's important.

1141
01:23:50,839 --> 01:23:52,500
Call me as soon
as you get this.

1142
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:55,874
- I love you.
- ( machine beeps )

1143
01:24:16,498 --> 01:24:18,830
Adam?

1144
01:24:18,867 --> 01:24:21,597
Honey, you shouldn't
haVe opened that.

1145
01:24:21,636 --> 01:24:24,969
You shouldn't haVe
touched that box.

1146
01:24:25,974 --> 01:24:27,942
Adam?

1147
01:24:27,976 --> 01:24:30,968
Is this me?

1148
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:37,415
Honey, let me explain.

1149
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:41,150
Adam.

1150
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,128
Zachary.

1151
01:24:47,162 --> 01:24:49,096
- What?!
- ( screams )

1152
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:51,326
I need to speak
with Richard Wells.

1153
01:24:51,366 --> 01:24:54,529
Woman:
I'm sorry, but Dr. Wells
is at the Hazen funeral today.

1154
01:24:54,569 --> 01:24:56,560
A funeral where?

1155
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:02,037
Jessie:
Honey, don't be scared. It's okay.

1156
01:25:02,077 --> 01:25:04,170
I'm right here.
Just be careful, okay?

1157
01:25:05,747 --> 01:25:07,271
- ( metal object clangs )
- (Jessie gasps )

1158
01:25:07,315 --> 01:25:09,249
Jessie:
What was that?

1159
01:25:09,284 --> 01:25:12,082
- ( Jessie gasps )
- ( quickly moving footsteps )

1160
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,747
Honey...

1161
01:25:14,923 --> 01:25:16,550
Mommy?

1162
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:18,718
Adam, where are you?

1163
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,251
- ( metallic crash )
- ( Jessie screams )

1164
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:26,156
Adam?

1165
01:25:26,201 --> 01:25:29,637
Adam can't come out
to play right now, Mrs. Duncan.

1166
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:31,332
Wait.

1167
01:25:33,308 --> 01:25:34,969
Wait!

1168
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:38,339
Let me explain.

1169
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:51,958
Adam.

1170
01:26:13,582 --> 01:26:15,914
You couldn't use him,
could you?

1171
01:26:17,018 --> 01:26:18,645
Zachary.

1172
01:26:18,687 --> 01:26:20,655
You couldn't use him.

1173
01:26:20,689 --> 01:26:22,680
Maybe it neVer eVen
occurred to you to try.

1174
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:28,229
No, it occurred to me.

1175
01:26:28,263 --> 01:26:29,890
But the fire
destroyed him, right?

1176
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:31,956
You didn't eVen haVe
a Viable cell.

1177
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,458
His genetics I could saIVage,
but it was no more than pieces of a map.

1178
01:26:35,504 --> 01:26:37,131
I saVed what I could,
but after that--

1179
01:26:37,172 --> 01:26:39,834
I was this close
to perfecting the procedure,

1180
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:42,070
you can't possibly fathom
that kind of torture.

1181
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:43,941
To haVe this knowledge,
this power,

1182
01:26:43,979 --> 01:26:45,742
and know there's nothing more
you can do about it.

1183
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:47,372
But you did do things
about it, Richard.

1184
01:26:47,415 --> 01:26:49,144
Once you had Adam's cell,
you could preserVe

1185
01:26:49,184 --> 01:26:52,051
his physical characteristics
and manipulate certain genes--

1186
01:26:52,087 --> 01:26:55,523
intangibles, like cognition,
personality, his memory.

1187
01:26:55,557 --> 01:26:57,787
- I'm right, aren't l?
- Except for one thing.

1188
01:26:57,826 --> 01:26:59,851
There was no way
to predict the results.

1189
01:26:59,895 --> 01:27:01,886
I could only wait and hope
for a glimpse of him,

1190
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:04,023
the mere indication that
something had liVed on.

1191
01:27:04,065 --> 01:27:06,033
LiVed on?

1192
01:27:06,067 --> 01:27:09,434
Do you haVe any idea what you'Ve done
to my son?! To my family?

1193
01:27:09,471 --> 01:27:11,496
I'd think you of all people
would understand,

1194
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:14,532
seeing as we were both after
the same thing. I just wanted him back.

1195
01:27:14,576 --> 01:27:16,510
You experimented
with a human life!

1196
01:27:16,545 --> 01:27:18,035
So did you.
So did your wife.

1197
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:19,876
No, I would say
there's a huge difference--

1198
01:27:19,915 --> 01:27:22,509
Is there, Paul? Do you think
you can just open Pandora's Box

1199
01:27:22,551 --> 01:27:24,178
and then just close it again?

1200
01:27:24,219 --> 01:27:26,187
We trusted you, goddamn it!

1201
01:27:26,221 --> 01:27:28,553
We had no way of knowing.
What you did goes way beyond--

1202
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,319
Beyond what?
Societal standards?

1203
01:27:30,358 --> 01:27:32,826
You name me a single
medical adVancement that didn't.

1204
01:27:32,861 --> 01:27:34,590
Tell me something.

1205
01:27:34,629 --> 01:27:37,792
If I'm not supposed to do this, Paul,
then how is it that I can?

1206
01:27:39,367 --> 01:27:41,335
Because you're a scientist.

1207
01:27:41,369 --> 01:27:43,428
Only this isn't about science

1208
01:27:43,471 --> 01:27:45,234
or eVolution--
it's about moral trespass,

1209
01:27:45,273 --> 01:27:47,173
about your ignoring
what's right and wrong.

1210
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:49,438
And what about you, Paul?
HaVe you trespassed?

1211
01:27:50,445 --> 01:27:52,208
I don't know.

1212
01:27:52,247 --> 01:27:56,081
Yeah, maybe this is
my punishment for wanting

1213
01:27:56,117 --> 01:27:58,244
something that I neVer
should haVe had.

1214
01:27:58,286 --> 01:28:00,049
And if that's the case,
then so be it.

1215
01:28:00,088 --> 01:28:02,556
But belieVe me when I tell you,
I'm gonna do eVerything

1216
01:28:02,591 --> 01:28:04,388
in my power
to saVe my child

1217
01:28:04,426 --> 01:28:06,223
and see that you pay
for what you'Ve done.

1218
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:08,729
- Paul--
- No, this is oVer, you understand?

1219
01:28:08,763 --> 01:28:10,458
We're gonna go to the police,

1220
01:28:10,498 --> 01:28:13,160
and then we're gonna find someplace,
anyplace that can help him.

1221
01:28:13,201 --> 01:28:15,135
- You're not going anywhere--
- Like hell I'm not!

1222
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:17,764
Richard:
That was an experiment.
That experiment failed.

1223
01:28:17,806 --> 01:28:21,298
We can always terminate
and try again.

1224
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:24,107
Terminate?

1225
01:28:24,145 --> 01:28:26,306
That's my son
you're talking about.

1226
01:28:28,049 --> 01:28:31,382
Our son! He's yours
because I gaVe him to you.

1227
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:35,148
You stay away from him!
You hear me?

1228
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:37,522
You stay away!

1229
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:51,301
You were lucky to haVe him
as long as you did.

1230
01:28:51,339 --> 01:28:53,603
You had nothing
when I found you.

1231
01:28:53,642 --> 01:28:56,577
I gaVe you a child,
a house, a job.

1232
01:28:56,611 --> 01:28:59,444
Anything in your life
that you Value, I proVided.

1233
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:02,041
You remember that,
you--

1234
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:04,551
you ungrateful
piece of shit!

1235
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:22,661
( owl hooting )

1236
01:29:42,757 --> 01:29:46,557
Why, why, why
didn't he listen?

1237
01:30:06,948 --> 01:30:09,439
Adam!
( sobbing )

1238
01:30:41,983 --> 01:30:43,746
Adam?

1239
01:30:48,389 --> 01:30:50,050
Are you in here?

1240
01:31:11,346 --> 01:31:14,713
Adam, where are you?

1241
01:31:35,703 --> 01:31:38,194
- ( metal rattles )
- ( gasps )

1242
01:31:54,355 --> 01:31:56,186
( chains clink )

1243
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:16,941
( Jessie screams )

1244
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,705
Let go.
Let go of the axe.

1245
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:23,781
Adam.

1246
01:32:27,589 --> 01:32:28,920
Adam.

1247
01:32:34,696 --> 01:32:36,357
Yes, Daddy?

1248
01:32:39,534 --> 01:32:41,195
Who are you?

1249
01:32:41,236 --> 01:32:43,704
Who are you right now?

1250
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,138
I'm your son.

1251
01:33:07,795 --> 01:33:11,390
( steel balls clinking )

1252
01:34:00,248 --> 01:34:04,048
Boy:
Come on, Max, throw it.
Throw it, come on.

1253
01:34:05,053 --> 01:34:07,044
Man:
Goes upstairs.

1254
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,753
Paul:
All right, if you guys
can paint that out

1255
01:34:14,796 --> 01:34:16,423
by Thursday, that'd be great.

1256
01:34:16,464 --> 01:34:18,489
- Mr. Duncan, that's gonna look great.
- Great.

1257
01:34:20,268 --> 01:34:22,395
- Paul: How are you doing?
- All right.

1258
01:34:22,437 --> 01:34:24,029
These are going downstairs.

1259
01:34:26,341 --> 01:34:28,935
Boy:
Go, go, go!

1260
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,203
( children laughing )

1261
01:34:38,419 --> 01:34:40,683
Jessie:
Hey, how do you like
your new room?

1262
01:34:45,326 --> 01:34:47,317
It's not finished yet.

1263
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,496
Hey, kiddo, look...

1264
01:34:55,536 --> 01:34:57,697
It's a big change, we know.

1265
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,565
But those doctors
you'Ve been working with,

1266
01:35:01,609 --> 01:35:04,669
they all say this change
could be really good for you, right?

1267
01:35:12,353 --> 01:35:16,084
Sweetie, you'Ve
been doing so great.

1268
01:35:16,124 --> 01:35:17,751
And I bet...

1269
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:21,387
in a new town, with new friends,

1270
01:35:21,429 --> 01:35:23,397
you're gonna do eVen better.

1271
01:35:23,431 --> 01:35:25,296
I know.

1272
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,927
Man:
Mrs. Duncan?

1273
01:35:27,969 --> 01:35:30,062
Coming.

1274
01:35:30,104 --> 01:35:32,129
Hey...

1275
01:35:32,173 --> 01:35:34,368
I got three boxes downstairs

1276
01:35:34,409 --> 01:35:36,377
And they're all labeled...

1277
01:35:36,411 --> 01:35:38,709
"Toys."

1278
01:35:38,746 --> 01:35:41,180
How about you giVe me
a hand unpacking 'em?

1279
01:35:41,215 --> 01:35:42,580
Yeah?

1280
01:35:42,617 --> 01:35:44,084
Man:
Where would you like these?

1281
01:35:44,118 --> 01:35:46,586
Oh, careful with that,
it's going downstairs.

1282
01:35:56,798 --> 01:35:59,631
( floor creaking )

1283
01:36:06,908 --> 01:36:09,741
( knocking )

1284
01:36:51,419 --> 01:36:52,909
Hey, kiddo,
I thought you were--

1285
01:36:55,356 --> 01:36:57,017
Adam?

1286
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:17,504
Ahh! God!

1287
01:37:22,216 --> 01:37:24,377
I thought you were
coming down.

1288
01:37:25,386 --> 01:37:27,377
Are you all right?

1289
01:37:29,423 --> 01:37:31,391
You'd tell me
if there was anything--

1290
01:37:31,425 --> 01:37:33,086
Nothing's wrong, Daddy.

1291
01:37:33,127 --> 01:37:34,788
I'm fine.

1292
01:37:34,829 --> 01:37:37,127
All right.

1293
01:37:42,036 --> 01:37:44,334
Trust me.

1294
01:37:44,372 --> 01:37:46,840
This is gonna be great for us.

1295
01:37:46,874 --> 01:37:48,364
Hey.

1296
01:37:51,445 --> 01:37:53,743
It's a place
we can start all oVer.

1297
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:21,037
( instrumental music playing )
