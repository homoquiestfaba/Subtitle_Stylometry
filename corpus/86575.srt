1
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,750
High school is like
the training wheels...

2
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,450
for the bicycle of real life.

3
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,850
It is a time when
young people can explore...

4
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,450
different fields of interests...

5
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,150
and hopefully learn
from their experiences.

6
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,050
In coming to terms
with my own personal setback...

7
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,650
I have been able to learn...

8
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,150
that I don't need to rely
on drugs and alcohol...

9
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,350
and that I'm very lucky...

10
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,350
that more people
besides myself and Kerry...

11
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,150
weren't injured in the accident.

12
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,050
And I have learned...

13
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,150
that to overcome
life's obstacles...

14
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,450
you need faith, hope...

15
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,850
and above all, a sense of humor.

16
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,850
No more education

17
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,450
It's time for celebration

18
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,150
'Cause this is the day
of our high school graduation

19
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,050
We've stayed for the duration

20
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,750
Achieved matriculation

21
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,850
Now we're the newest members
of the general population

22
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,450
God, what a bunch of retards.

23
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,450
God, I know.
I thought that chipmunk face...

24
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,850
was never going to shut up.

25
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,650
I know.
I liked her so much better...

26
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,350
when she was
an alcoholic crack addict.

27
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,550
She gets in one car wreck...

28
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,850
and all of the sudden
she's Little Miss Perfect...

29
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,650
and everyone loves her.

30
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,650
Let's see if they gave me
the right diploma.

31
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,050
- What?
- What?

32
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,750
These assholes are saying
I have to go to summer school...

33
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,050
and take some stupid art class.

34
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,250
Why?

35
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,450
God, I didn't think that
just because you get an "F"...

36
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,350
you have to take the whole class
over again.

37
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,250
Loser.

38
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,850
Wow. This is so bad,
it's almost good.

39
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,750
This is so bad, it's gone past
good and back to bad again.

40
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,250
At least
we'll never have to see...

41
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,750
any of these creepy faces
ever again.

42
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,850
Unless they're
in your summer school class.

43
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,250
Shut up.

44
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,850
- Don't turn around.
- What? Why?

45
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,450
- Don't turn around.
- Damn it.

46
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,150
Oh, my God. You guys,
I can't believe we made it.

47
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,250
Yeah.
We graduated high school.

48
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,250
How totally amazing.

49
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,850
So, what are you guys
doing this summer?

50
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,050
Nothing.

51
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,150
Well, I'm going
to this actor's workshop...

52
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,650
and I'm hoping
to start auditions soon.

53
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,650
Oh, we have to get together
this summer.

54
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,050
Yeah.
That'll definitely happen.

55
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,650
Well, bye, you guys.

56
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
Congratulations!

57
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,950
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Oh, hi.

58
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,350
So, we finally--

59
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,550
What about me?
Am I not even here?

60
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,450
Hey, Enid.

61
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,450
- So, we finally made it, huh?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,050
So, where are you going to go
to college?

63
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,550
We're not.

64
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,250
Really?

65
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,650
Both of you? Why not?

66
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,750
Just because.

67
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,750
Yeah, we made other plans.

68
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,950
I guess
I should have figured...

69
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,550
that you two
would do something different.

70
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,550
So, Todd, what are you
going to be when you grow up?

71
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,050
Well, I'm majoring
in Business Administration...

72
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,150
and thinking of minoring
in Communications, so--

73
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,150
See, that's exactly the type
of thing we're trying to avoid.

74
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,850
Look at this.

75
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,550
Is Stacy Himmler
going out with Rod Harbaugh?

76
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,850
Oh, God. How perfect.

77
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,950
He better watch out, or he'll
get AIDS when he date-rapes her.

78
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,350
Where is the love

79
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,050
You said you'd give to me

80
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,050
As soon as you were free?

81
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,150
Will it ever be?

82
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,650
God, just think.
We'll never see Dennis again.

83
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,850
Good.

84
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,650
No, really.
Think about that.

85
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,950
It's actually
totally depressing.

86
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,950
Is it crazy for an oil company
to care about the environment?

87
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,250
We don't think so.

88
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,350
I already told you
I'm not going to college.

89
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,150
I think it's a good idea
to keep all your options open.

90
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,250
You can even enroll
in the winter quarter.

91
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,050
Actually, you could live here...

92
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,650
and go to the city college
part time...

93
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,550
and still get a job if you want.

94
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,350
Look at me.
I'm not even listening...

95
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,150
to a word you're saying.

96
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,850
Did I tell you who I ran into
at the bagel place?

97
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,350
Who?

98
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,750
- Guess.
- How should I know?

99
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,450
Well, someone from the past.

100
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,350
- Who?
- You give up?

101
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,550
- Yes.
- Maxine.

102
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,150
- Not the Maxine?
- Yeah.

103
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,250
Oh, God. How horrifying.

104
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,850
It's very good.

105
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,550
Jesus.

106
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,850
Check out these people
behind you.

107
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,750
I'm totally convinced
they're Satanists.

108
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,650
So when are we gonna start
looking for our apartment?

109
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,150
Soon.

110
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,250
I have to wait and see how
this summer class goes first.

111
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,950
God, it's so weird that we're
finally out of high school.

112
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,550
We've been waiting for this
our whole lives.

113
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,750
It's such a weird feeling.

114
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,150
Yeah.
It hasn't really hit me yet.

115
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,550
Well, well, well.

116
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,650
If it isn't Enid and Rebecca--

117
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,950
the little Jewish girl
and her Aryan friend.

118
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,850
- You're late, asshole.
- Fine, and how are you?

119
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,550
Did you bring the tape?

120
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,450
You never paid me for that tape
of the Indian dance routine.

121
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,950
Yes, I did.

122
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,550
You Jews
are so clever with money.

123
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,850
Fuck you!
You stupid redneck hick.

124
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,950
Oh, my God.
Look, the Satanists are leaving.

125
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,850
Hey, we should follow them.

126
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,850
Oh, we totally have to.

127
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,550
Oh, my God!

128
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,350
So, what do you do
if you're a Satanist, anyway?

129
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,850
Sacrifice virgins and stuff.

130
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,950
Well, that lets us off the hook.

131
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,650
How the hell
did we get so far behind them?

132
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,850
I don't know.
That's just great.

133
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,850
- Jesus!
- Oh, yay.

134
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,150
Oh, my God. Look at this.

135
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,050
"Wowsville"?
Authentic Fifties diner?

136
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,950
Since when were there mini-malls
in the 1950s?

137
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,950
Who could forget this great hit
from the Fifties, huh?

138
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,550
I feel as though
I've stepped into a time warp.

139
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,550
Hey, check out the awesome
Fifties hairdo on our waiter.

140
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,850
Hi.
My name is Allen...

141
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,850
and I'll be your waiter
this afternoon.

142
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,050
- Hi, Al.
- Can we call you "Weird Al"?

143
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,950
I'd imagine so.

144
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,550
You should check out
the personals.

145
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,050
Maybe our future husbands
are trying to contact us.

146
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,450
Here we go.

147
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,250
"Windsurfing doctor, Mensan IQ,
maverick Sagittarius.

148
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,050
"Let's hit the clubs,
make each other laugh."

149
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,150
You can have that one.

150
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,550
Jesus, listen to this one.

151
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,850
"Do you remember me,
airport shuttle, June 7?

152
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,150
"You, striking blond
with yellow dress...

153
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,950
"pearl necklace, brown shoes.

154
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,350
"I was the bookish fellow
in the green cardigan...

155
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,550
"who helped you find
your contact lens.

156
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,050
"Am I crazy,
or did we have a moment?"

157
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,250
God, that's so pathetic.

158
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,950
I mean, she probably
didn't even notice him.

159
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,450
And he's psychotically obsessing
over every little detail.

160
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,750
We should call him
and pretend to be the blond.

161
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,050
Oh, we totally have to.

162
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,350
It's his machine.

163
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,650
Hi, it's me.

164
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,350
Your striking blond.

165
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,650
Of course I remember you.

166
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,150
Let's get together for lunch
sometime.

167
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,850
How about Friday at 1:00?

168
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,450
Meet me at my favorite
restaurant-- Wowsville.

169
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,950
It's in the mall
on Century Parkway.

170
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,650
See you there, darling.

171
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,850
Oh, yeah, and be sure to wear
that sexy green cardigan.

172
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,450
Oh, it's that comedian
I was telling you about.

173
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,950
- I still live with my mother.
- He's the absolute worst.

174
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,650
So what if she's been dead
for fifteen years?

175
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,650
See?
That's barely even a joke.

176
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,450
Well, it's like I always say--

177
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,650
take my life...please.

178
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,150
Joey McCobb, the weirdest man
in show business.

179
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,850
If he's so weird,
how come he's wearing Nikes?

180
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,250
Joey McCobb is our god.

181
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,950
- I want to do him.
- I bet.

182
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,150
Actually,
he kind of reminds me...

183
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,250
of that one guy
you went out with-- Larry.

184
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,650
God,
what look was he going for...

185
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,650
a gay tennis player
from the Forties?

186
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,150
- Fuck you.
- You dated him.

187
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,850
Why do you have this?

188
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,350
I don't know. You lent it to me
in, like, tenth grade.

189
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,550
Oh, look at how cute I am.

190
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,450
What a little hose bag.

191
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,650
Look, there's my dad
with Maxine.

192
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:56,450
God, look at her.
What a fucking monster.

193
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,050
If he starts dating her again,
I'll kill myself.

194
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,950
Listen, lady, you tell me
you want to relax your hair.

195
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,850
Sing it a lullaby or use this.
It's all I've got.

196
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,550
Hey, what you doing?

197
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,150
You have five minutes
left on your shift.

198
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,450
Well, hello there, young
employee of the Sidewinder.

199
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,350
Look, I already told you guys,
I'm not giving you a ride.

200
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,250
What can you tell me,
young man...

201
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,850
about the various flavors
of frozen yogurt?

202
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,550
I'll be done in a minute.
Can you guys just wait outside?

203
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,150
I don't understand.
I simply wish to know--

204
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,850
Josh, what are you doing?

205
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,150
In addition to our favorites,
chocolate and vanilla...

206
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,750
this week we are featuring
six-gun strawberry...

207
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,450
wild cherry roundup,
and ten-gallon tangerine.

208
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,750
I don't believe
I care for any of those.

209
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,650
What's up, Josh? Give me
two packs of cigarettes today.

210
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,250
Working overtime. Sixteen hours.

211
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,250
And nature's nectar,
wake-up Juice.

212
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,450
And give me
six of these beef jerkys.

213
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,550
I'm hungry enough to chew
the crotch out of a rag doll.

214
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,650
Hey! Hey, you!

215
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,850
How many times I tell you?
No shirt, no service.

216
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,150
Get the hell out of my store.

217
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,450
What do you think this is,
Club Med?

218
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,750
It's America, dude.
Learn the rules.

219
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,650
No, you learn the rules.
We Greeks invented democracy.

220
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,750
- You also invented homos.
- Fuck you.

221
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,450
You wish.
You got to buy me dinner first.

222
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,450
So...

223
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,050
Can we talk about this
in a minute?

224
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,950
Seriously, I'm, like,
this close to being done.

225
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,750
Son of a bitch.

226
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,550
What do you think you're doing?

227
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,350
Turn off that goddamn noise.

228
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,250
Rock 'n' roll, baby.
Freedom of speech.

229
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,850
What do you think this is,
Woodstock?

230
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,150
- That guy rules!
- Who, Doug?

231
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,750
That guy spends more time
in here than I do.

232
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,050
It's my parking lot!

233
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,050
So, Josh,
will you please give us a ride?

234
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,750
- Please, Josh?
- No.

235
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,150
- Please? It'll be super fun.
- Please, Josh?

236
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,550
Look, I don't see
why you guys even need a ride.

237
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,950
You could walk there
in two minutes.

238
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,850
It's just an excuse for us
to spend time with you, Josh.

239
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,350
If this guy freaks out,
will you protect us?

240
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,650
This guy
has every reason to freak out.

241
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,050
This is a pretty fucked up thing
to do to somebody.

242
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,550
I think Josh
is becoming too mature for us.

243
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,650
Oh, look, maybe that's him.

244
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,050
No. It's still
twenty-five minutes too early.

245
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,850
Aren't there
a million places like this?

246
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,850
No. This is the ultimate.

247
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,050
It's, like, the Taj Mahal
of fake Fifties diners.

248
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,950
So, where's the Weird AI guy?

249
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,950
There he is back there.

250
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,550
I can see his hair
bobbing up and down.

251
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,550
I want to make love to him.

252
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,750
I'm gonna tell him
you said that.

253
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,850
So nice to see you again,
ladies.

254
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,250
Hi, Weird Al.
My friend here has--

255
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,650
Shut up!

256
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,150
- She says she wants to--
- Shut up!

257
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,550
Oh, my God.

258
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,750
God, that is obviously him.

259
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,950
Oh, my God. He just ordered
a giant glass of milk.

260
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,650
That's a vanilla milkshake.

261
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,550
Oh, God,
this is totally unbearable.

262
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,150
Fucking asshole!
What's wrong with you?

263
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,850
Oh, my God. It's him.

264
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,950
- Can anybody drive?
- He's insane.

265
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,050
- We should follow him home.
- Forget it.

266
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,950
Come on, Josh. Don't you want
to see where this guy lives?

267
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,950
God, he lives
right in our neighborhood.

268
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,350
He doesn't even look
all that bummed out really.

269
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,850
I know.

270
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,850
Wouldn't he be, like,
totally pissed off?

271
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,150
This type of thing
must happen to him all the time.

272
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,050
Mirror, father, mirror.

273
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:10,750
That piece is entitled
"Mirror, Father, Mirror."

274
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,050
I like to show it...

275
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,250
to people that I'm meeting
for the first time...

276
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,250
because I think it says so much
about who I am...

277
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:24,350
and what it feels like
to inhabit my specific skin.

278
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,250
And this is exactly
what I'm hoping to get...

279
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,250
from each of you
over the course of this summer--

280
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,650
a picture
of your own self-exploration.

281
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:45,950
Now, my own background is
in video and performance art...

282
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,550
but I'm hoping that doesn't
influence you too much...

283
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,450
and you'll find your own ways
of externalizing the internal.

284
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,950
And at the end of the summer,
this class has been invited...

285
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,950
to participate
in a show of high school art...

286
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,950
at the neighborhood
activity center.

287
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,650
The title of the show will be...

288
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:15,150
"Brotherhood and Community:
Art as Dialogue."

289
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,250
Are there any questions so far?

290
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,350
Great!

291
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,050
This is really creepy.

292
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,850
We just need to find out
what apartment he's in...

293
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,650
and we'll stalk him
from a distance.

294
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,650
I'm afraid if I see him,
I'll feel really bad again.

295
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,450
This is girl mail.

296
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,750
This is computer catalogs
and stuff.

297
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,150
"The W.C. Fields Fan Club
Newsletter"?

298
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,950
Oh, my God. The National
Psoriasis Foundation?

299
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,050
- Bingo.
- Did you hear something?

300
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,850
Come on.

301
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,350
What if he recognizes us?

302
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,650
Eww, look at this.

303
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,350
Eww. Gross.

304
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,850
Kinda cute.

305
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,450
It looks like a gross rat.

306
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,150
That's a mongoose.

307
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,150
How much is it?

308
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,050
That's not officially for sale.

309
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:38,350
I might have to hang on to that
for the time being.

310
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,350
So, you looking for anything
in particular?

311
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,950
Do you have any other
old records besides these?

312
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,350
Seymour does.

313
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,550
Who does?

314
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,450
Oh, him. Seymour.

315
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,650
He's the man with the records.

316
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,750
Do you have
any old Indian records?

317
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,850
Indian records?

318
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,150
Yeah. You know, like, old Indian
1960s rock 'n' roll music.

319
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,150
I may have one Hindu 78...

320
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,050
in my collection
from the Twenties...

321
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,450
but it's not really for sale.

322
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,550
I don't really collect foreign.

323
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,550
Those are all 78s.
You play 78s?

324
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,950
Maybe not 78s,
but I can play regular records.

325
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,450
Well, there's
some good stuff in here.

326
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,450
- You like old music?
- Yeah, it's good.

327
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,050
There's some choice LPs
in here...

328
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,650
that reissue some really great
old blues stuff.

329
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,950
How about this one?
Is it any good?

330
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,450
No, that one's not so great.

331
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,050
Excuse me.

332
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,250
This is the one I'd recommend.

333
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,250
It's...

334
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,950
This track alone
by Memphis Minnie...

335
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,350
is worth about $500
if you own the original 78.

336
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,550
I know the guy
who owns the original...

337
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,550
and lent it for use
on this reissue.

338
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,450
Wow.

339
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,750
- How much is it?
- $1.75.

340
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,450
If you don't like it, you can
bring it back for a refund.

341
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,250
We're here every Saturday.

342
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,950
I'm sure it's OK.

343
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,150
Enjoy.

344
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,650
It was so cute
how he had his own little bags.

345
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,650
I thought
I was going to start crying.

346
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,050
Yeah, he should totally
just kill himself.

347
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,050
Oh, here's one.

348
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,250
But you have to share with a...

349
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,050
"nonsmoking feminist
and her two cats".

350
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,850
I don't know.
I kind of like him.

351
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,050
He's the exact opposite
of everything I really hate.

352
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,350
In a way,
he's such a clueless dork...

353
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,850
he's almost kind of cool.

354
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,850
That guy is many things,
but he's definitely not cool.

355
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,050
This would be good,
but there's no kitchen.

356
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,150
Yeah, but...
you know what I mean.

357
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,650
Not really.

358
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,450
Forget it.
I can't explain it.

359
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,850
Oh, my God.
What are you guys doing here?

360
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,650
What are you doing here,
Melorra?

361
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,550
My acting workshop
is across the street from here.

362
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,150
I'm just on my break.

363
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,950
Well, we won't keep you.

364
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,050
I love this place.

365
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,850
It's so, I don't know...
You know, funky.

366
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,750
So, what are you guys up to?

367
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,050
We're looking for apartments.

368
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,350
God, how cool.
Where are you moving?

369
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,550
We don't know yet.
That's why we're looking.

370
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,150
Somewhere downtown.

371
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,050
God, that's so exciting.

372
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,450
Oops, I should go.

373
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,850
Bye, you guys. Call me.
Bye.

374
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,050
Funky.

375
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,850
What, is she black now?

376
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,450
So, I was thinking that when
we look for our apartment...

377
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,450
we have to convince these people
that we're totally rich yuppies.

378
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,350
What are you talking about?

379
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,250
That's who people
want to rent to.

380
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,750
So all we have to do is buy
semi-expensive outfits...

381
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,950
and I think it's no big deal.

382
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,150
It'll be really fun.

383
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,350
Honey,
have you seen my blue spatula?

384
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,550
What, are you making pancakes?

385
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:03,150
Not if I can't find
that goddamn spatula.

386
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,750
That's just great.
When did you do that?

387
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,750
God, how long
have you been standing there?

388
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,950
Hey, look. There's the pants.

389
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,750
Where are we going?

390
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,950
Let's go hassle Josh.

391
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,050
Hassle?

392
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,950
- Oh, look, there he is.
- As always.

393
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,550
Waiting for the bus
that never comes.

394
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,150
I wonder
if he's just totally insane...

395
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,350
or he really thinks
the bus is coming?

396
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,650
Why don't you just ask him?

397
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,550
Hi. What's your name?

398
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,050
Norman.

399
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,050
- Are you waiting for a bus?
- Yes.

400
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,450
I hate to tell you this...

401
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,750
but they canceled this bus line
two years ago.

402
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,850
There are no more buses
on this street.

403
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,950
You don't know
what you're talking about.

404
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,650
Josh!

405
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,550
I bet he's in there jerking off.

406
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,550
I'll bet he never jerks off.

407
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,150
Yeah, he's beyond
human stuff like that.

408
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,950
Should we leave a note?

409
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,550
- Yeah. You got a pen?
- Yeah.

410
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:57,050
"Dear Josh,
we came by to fuck you...

411
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,550
"but you were not home.
Therefore, you are gay.

412
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,750
"Signed Tiffany and Amber."

413
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,450
- You're going to leave that?
- Why not?

414
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,350
Why do we have to go in here?
I hate this place.

415
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,750
Don't worry.
It'll only take a second.

416
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,250
Whoever told you
that bullshit about boiling...

417
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,750
is out of his mind.

418
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,050
Carpet beetles are the only way
to get flesh off a corpse.

419
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,650
I'm just telling you
what he said.

420
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,650
Don't you creeps
ever talk about anything nice?

421
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,950
Don't you ever talk about fluffy
kittens or the Easter Bunny?

422
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,650
Look who's talking,
Little Miss Badass.

423
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,750
Yeah, nice outfit.

424
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,750
Who are you supposed to be,
Cyndi Lauper?

425
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,650
Blow me, doofus.

426
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,550
Oh, my God.
Didn't they tell you?

427
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,850
- Tell me what?
- Punk rock is over.

428
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,350
I know it's over, asshole.

429
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,950
Want to fuck up the system?
Go to business school.

430
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,350
That's what I'm going to do.

431
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,150
Get a job
at some big corporation...

432
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,450
and, like, fuck things up
from the inside.

433
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,250
- You know, I'm not even trying--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

434
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,450
Hey, do you have my money?

435
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,450
Oh, how punk.

436
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,950
You know that tape sucked,
by the way?

437
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,950
- So sorry if it offended Jew.
- Go die, asshole.

438
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,350
- Get a job.
- God, fuck you.

439
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,850
Can we go now?

440
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,850
You know, it's not like
I'm some modern punk, dickhead.

441
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,950
It's obviously a 1977
original punk rock look.

442
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,150
Johnny Fuckface over there
is too stupid to realize it.

443
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,350
I didn't really get it, either.

444
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,350
Everyone's too stupid.

445
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,350
It took me a while before I got
a chance to actually play it...

446
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,150
but once I heard that song,
it was like--

447
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,450
You liked it, huh?

448
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:12,250
There's
some really rare performances.

449
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,350
What about-- Did you like
the Memphis Minnie?

450
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,150
That was good, too.
The whole record was good...

451
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,550
but that one song,
"Devil Got My Woman..."

452
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,650
I mostly just keep playing that
over and over.

453
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,050
Do you have any other records
like that?

454
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,250
There are no other records
like that.

455
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,350
Actually, I have the original 78
in my collection.

456
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,350
It's one of maybe
five known copies.

457
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,550
Wow.

458
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,050
Yeah. Do you want to see it?

459
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,050
I can run upstairs
and get it.

460
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,350
Sure, yeah.

461
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,750
Watch my stuff.

462
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,950
Here we go. It's...

463
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,850
It's only about a B-minus.

464
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,850
It's got
an incipient lam crack...

465
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,750
but it plays decent
as I recall.

466
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,350
- Oops, I dropped it!
- Jeez!

467
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,850
I was only kidding.

468
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,650
Jesus, Seymour,
are you all right?

469
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,150
Yeah, it's just...

470
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,450
it's very valuable.

471
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,150
Now, last week, I asked you...

472
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,950
to try to create
a piece of artwork...

473
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:25,150
that responds to something
you have strong feelings about.

474
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,550
I merely want to help you
find...

475
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,050
the best way
to look within yourselves...

476
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,050
the best key
to your particular lock.

477
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:40,550
And it looks like we have some
really interesting work up here.

478
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,850
Thanks.

479
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,650
What can you tell us
about your piece...

480
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,150
Phillip?

481
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:55,450
It's about The Mutilator.

482
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,150
My goodness.

483
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,250
It's a really great
video game...

484
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,850
about a guy who kills people
with a big hammer.

485
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,450
Oh. I thought maybe this was
supposed to be your father.

486
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,850
What can you tell us
about this piece..

487
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,750
- Enid.
- Enid.

488
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,450
Well, it's kind of a diary,
I guess.

489
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,150
Colorful.

490
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,850
I think that Phillip and Enid
can help us to see that...

491
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,850
there are many different ways
we can express ourselves.

492
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:46,250
We can do things like these
cartoons that are amusing...

493
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,650
as a sort of
a light entertainment...

494
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,850
or we can do work
that is more serious...

495
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,750
in scope, in feeling,
and that deals with issues--

496
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,550
emotional,
spiritual, political...

497
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,050
of great importance.

498
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,750
Who is responsible for this?

499
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,250
I am.

500
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,050
Talk to us about it.

501
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,550
It's my response to the issue
of a woman's right to choose.

502
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,450
It's something
I feel super strongly about.

503
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,750
Isn't this
a wonderful piece, class?

504
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:24,450
This definitely falls into
that higher category of art...

505
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,950
I was speaking of earlier.

506
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,550
In a world where
nothing is what it seems...

507
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,650
in a time of uncertainty...

508
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,750
the future
is about to be placed...

509
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,750
Hello.
Welcome to Masterpiece Video.

510
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,350
How may I help you
this afternoon, sir?

511
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,550
I'm looking for a copy
of "8 1/2".

512
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,450
Is that a new release, sir?

513
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,850
No.
It's the classic Italian film.

514
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,350
Yes, sir.

515
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,650
I'll just check that
on the computer for you, sir.

516
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,850
Hello! How are you
young ladies this afternoon?

517
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,650
May I help you find
a particular Masterpiece movie?

518
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,050
No.

519
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,250
Yes, here it is.

520
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,950
"9 1/2 Weeks"
with Mickey Rourke.

521
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,150
That would be
in the erotic drama section.

522
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:14,050
No, not "9 1/2", "8 1/2".
The Fellini film.

523
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,950
How about this one?

524
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,550
Forget it.
I'm sure it sucks.

525
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,750
All these movies suck.

526
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,550
America's top critics agree--

527
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,550
"The Flower
That Drank The Moon..."

528
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,850
Let's get out of here.
This place makes me sick.

529
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,950
We have to do something fun
tonight.

530
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,050
It's my last weekend of freedom
before I start my stupid job.

531
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,750
I know a party
we could go to later.

532
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,850
Really? Where?

533
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,050
It's a surprise.

534
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,350
Some records
I will pay serious money for...

535
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,350
provided
that they're a sincere V-plus.

536
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,750
Other than that, I just prefer
to have them on CD.

537
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,750
But CDs will never have
the presence of an original 78.

538
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,250
Wrong. A digital transfer,
adequately mastered...

539
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,750
will sound identical
to the original.

540
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,850
Do you have a decent equalizer?

541
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,150
- I have a Klipsch 2B3.
- Obviously the problem.

542
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,050
You expect
a ten-band equalizer...

543
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,950
to impart
state-of-the-art sound?

544
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,750
Dream a little dream.
It's never gonna happen.

545
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,450
I totally, totally hate you.

546
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,850
Come on.
This is a fun party.

547
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,750
Erskine Hawkins and
his orchestra, do you have that?

548
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,650
That's nice, but no.

549
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,950
- "Golden Wedding"?
- Oh, I know that.

550
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,050
That's excellent.

551
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,350
What's the story with
the two cheerleaders over there?

552
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,250
They're Seymour's.

553
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,550
Seymour? No.
You got to be kidding me.

554
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,050
Don't worry about it. I've lived
with the guy for five years.

555
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,550
He's not getting any.
Neither are you.

556
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,050
Hey, you know what?
Listen to me, Joe, all right?

557
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,350
Let me tell you something,
Joe, OK?

558
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,250
You can't score a home run
without swinging the bat.

559
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,450
All right?
Physically impossible.

560
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,250
Watch and learn, padre.

561
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,450
How's it going, Adam?

562
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,350
There's a seat right there.

563
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,450
- Mind if I sit down?
- Yes.

564
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,950
Oh, man. That was cold.

565
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,750
You're all right.

566
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,250
You're pretty sharp.

567
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,650
You're wearing a green dress.
What are you, Irish?

568
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,750
I bet you're Irish.
What's your name?

569
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,050
- Melorra.
- Ah, Melorra.

570
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,350
So listen to me, Melorra.

571
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,650
Let me tell you something.

572
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,550
You seem like
an interesting chick.

573
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,750
What are you doing hanging here
with all these losers?

574
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:42,850
What do you say you and me
go hit some night spots?

575
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:47,050
Well, Melorra,
I'll be right back.

576
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,350
I'm gonna get a beer.

577
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:51,050
No, Enid, wait.

578
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,950
Hey, that's all right.

579
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,450
It has a large center hole
and a hair crack.

580
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,750
But the crack is so tight,
it's completely inaudible.

581
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,650
But a tight hair crack
is just that-- a crack.

582
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,050
I don't collect cracked records.

583
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,750
I only pay premium
on mint records.

584
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,850
Seymour, you know that.
Please.

585
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,650
So, what was all that about
enlarged holes and tight cracks?

586
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,250
I didn't think
you would have any interest...

587
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,450
in this get-together.

588
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,650
If you would have told me
you were coming...

589
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,350
I would have warned you it's not
like a real party or anything.

590
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,550
You're right about that.

591
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,250
So, is this
your record collection?

592
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,150
God, no. This is just junk
I have for sale.

593
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,350
- The record room is off limits.
- Really?

594
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,550
Here.

595
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,250
Are all these records?

596
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,850
I've got about 1,500 78s
at this point.

597
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,650
I've tried
to pare down my collection...

598
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,950
to just the essential.

599
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,350
Look at this room.

600
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,750
This is, like, my dream room.

601
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,950
Look at all this stuff.

602
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,650
You are, like,
the luckiest guy in the world.

603
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,750
I would kill
to have stuff like this.

604
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,350
Please.
Go ahead and kill me.

605
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,050
Oh, come on.
What are you talking about?

606
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,150
You think it's healthy
to obsessively collect things?

607
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,450
You can't connect
with other people...

608
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,450
so you fill your life
with stuff.

609
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,250
I'm just like all the rest of
these pathetic collector losers.

610
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,650
No, you're not.
You're a cool guy, Seymour.

611
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:55,850
Then how come I haven't had
a girlfriend in four years?

612
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,850
I can't even remember the last
time a girl talked to me.

613
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,550
I'm talking to you.

614
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,050
You know,
I bet there are tons of women...

615
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,650
who'd go out with you
in a minute.

616
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,750
I know I could get you a date
in, like, two seconds.

617
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,950
Good luck.

618
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,950
I mean it.
You leave everything to me...

619
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,150
I'm going to be your own
personal dating service.

620
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,850
Yeah, well, we should get back.

621
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,150
By the end of this summer...

622
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,850
you're going to be
up to your neck in pussy.

623
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,750
Jesus.

624
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,450
What about her?
Would you go out with her?

625
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,050
What kind of a question is that?

626
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:25,350
It's totally irrelevant,
because a girl like that...

627
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,850
would never be caught dead
with me.

628
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,350
Yeah,
but put that aside for now.

629
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,150
Would you go out with her?

630
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,350
I really didn't
get a good look at her.

631
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,350
Yes, you did. Whoa.

632
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,850
What about her? Are you
into girls with big tits?

633
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,650
Jesus.

634
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,950
I mean, as long as
she's not a complete imbecile...

635
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,650
and she's even
remotely attractive...

636
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,450
Hey, look, there's Norman.
Hi, Norman.

637
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,850
We need to find a place
where you can go...

638
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,350
to meet women
who share your interests.

639
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,850
Maybe I don't want to meet
someone who shares my interests.

640
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,650
I hate my interests.

641
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,550
List your five main interests
in order of importance.

642
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,550
I'd have to put
traditional jazz, blues...

643
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,250
and then ragtime
at the top of the list.

644
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,450
Right, so let's just say music.

645
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,850
That way, we only use up one.

646
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,850
All right.

647
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,950
Can we go in here for a second?
Just for a second.

648
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,350
Just stopping by to say hi.

649
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,950
This is my friend Seymour.

650
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,950
OK.
Well, we'll see you later, Josh.

651
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,350
Josh, what you goddamn doing?

652
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:45,250
Clean up that fucking mess!
Jesus.

653
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,950
So, was that your boyfriend?

654
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,050
Josh?
He's nobody's boyfriend.

655
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,850
He's just this guy that
Becky and I like to torture.

656
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,050
But do you...
Are you going out--

657
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,550
Oh, my God.
We have to go in here. Come on.

658
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,850
Yeah, sure. Very funny.

659
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,550
Come on. Please?

660
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,450
Becky and I
have been dying to go in here...

661
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,050
but we can never find any boys
to take us.

662
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,650
- I would really rather not.
- Come on. Please?

663
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,250
Just for a minute.
It'll be a riot.

664
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,350
- I don't think so.
- Please. Please.

665
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:29,950
Oh, my God.
Look at all these creeps.

666
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,050
OK. Can we go?

667
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:37,950
This place is a total riot.

668
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,950
What are you doing?

669
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,250
Oh, my God.

670
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,750
Who would actually have sex
with this thing?

671
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,750
"Corporate Slut".
Sophisticated.

672
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,250
Come on. Can we go?

673
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,950
Seymour, you have to lend me
the money to buy this.

674
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,550
I don't really have
a lot of money on me right now.

675
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,450
Come on, Seymour. Please?

676
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,450
I don't want this showing up
on a credit card statement.

677
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,850
I'll get put
on some weird mailing list.

678
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,750
- It's not that much.
- That's not the point.

679
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,050
Gimme all your money, bitch.

680
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,550
Where did you get that?

681
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:26,250
You'll never believe it.
Guess.

682
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,850
Where?

683
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,150
Anthony's.

684
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,350
No way. When?

685
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,950
Just now.
I went with Seymour.

686
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,650
You cunt.

687
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,850
Excuse me.

688
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,450
I can't read
the trivia question.

689
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,950
"Where on the human body
is the Douglas pouch located?"

690
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,450
Oh, God.

691
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:04,950
Slightly below
the uterus on a female.

692
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,150
Wow.

693
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,050
He does that every single day.

694
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,550
I'll have a decaf-mocha to go.

695
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,050
One decaf-mocha.

696
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,250
Can I get you--

697
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,050
No, I do not want a biscotti
with that.

698
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:32,050
God. How can you stand
all these assholes?

699
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,950
Some people are OK...

700
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,150
but mostly I just feel like
poisoning everybody.

701
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,950
At least the wheelchair guy
is entertaining.

702
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,550
He doesn't even need
that wheelchair.

703
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,150
He's just totally lazy.

704
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,850
That rules.

705
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:47,650
No, it really doesn't.
You'll see.

706
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,950
You'll get totally
sick of all the creeps...

707
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,450
and losers and weirdos.

708
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,150
But those are our people.

709
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,150
Yeah, well.

710
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,750
So, when are you going
to get a job?

711
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:06,050
I'm working on it.
Got a few leads.

712
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,750
Don't worry about it.
I'll get a job next week.

713
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,650
God, I can't believe you went
to Anthony's without me.

714
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:17,850
Oh, sweetie.

715
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,350
Honey, would you come in here
for a minute?

716
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,850
Sweetie, you remember Maxine?

717
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,850
I'm going to go to bed.
I'm really tired.

718
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:39,350
Honey, I made spaghetti.
You don't want some?

719
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,750
No. I have to get up early
for class tomorrow.

720
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,850
It's really quite something
to see you all grown up, Enid.

721
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:49,550
I'd love to know
what you're doing now.

722
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,750
I can't help but feel...

723
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,250
I had some small part
in how you turned out.

724
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,250
What are you studying?

725
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,250
You were always
such a smart little girl.

726
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,850
I'm taking a remedial
high school art class...

727
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,250
for fuck-ups and retards.

728
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:14,050
Who is this, Enid?

729
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,550
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.

730
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:20,150
And what was your reason for
choosing him as your subject?

731
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,450
I don't know.
I just like Don Knotts.

732
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,550
Interesting.

733
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,750
What do we have here, Margaret?

734
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,050
It's a tampon in a teacup.

735
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:35,550
I can see that.

736
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,950
What can you tell us about it?

737
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,850
First of all,
what kind of sculpture is this?

738
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,050
It's a found object.

739
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:44,350
That's where an artist
takes an ordinary object...

740
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,250
and places it
in an artistic context...

741
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,350
and thus, it becomes art.

742
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:49,450
But what can you
tell us about it...

743
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,150
in regard
to your artistic intent?

744
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:58,350
Well, I guess I see the teacup
as a symbol for womanhood.

745
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,750
Such as tea parties
in the olden days...

746
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,050
but instead of tea...

747
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,250
I was trying to kind of
confront people with this--

748
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:09,050
This shocking image
of repressed femininity.

749
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,150
Right. Exactly.

750
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:14,150
Well, I think it's a really
wonderful piece...

751
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,050
and it illustrates perfectly
what I was saying...

752
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:22,950
about not being afraid
to use controversial imagery.

753
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:27,350
Oh. Well, this looks like
the work of Phillip.

754
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,750
Hey, you see that guy
over there?

755
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:39,550
- Which one?
- The blond guy over there.

756
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,450
He gives me, like,
a total boner.

757
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:47,450
He's, like, the biggest idiot
of all time.

758
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,950
You guys
up for some reggae tonight?

759
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,150
OK, you're right.

760
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,050
Sometimes
I think I'm going crazy...

761
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,850
from sexual frustration.

762
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,050
And you haven't heard
of the miracle of masturbation?

763
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,450
Heads up.

764
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,250
My band's playing here
on Friday night...

765
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:16,350
and there's going to be
a bunch of cool bands playing...

766
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,850
and you don't have to pay...

767
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,150
if you show them this flier
at the door.

768
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:22,950
You should come check it out.

769
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,650
Which band is yours?

770
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,950
It's Alien Autopsy.

771
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,350
Oh. Bitchin'.

772
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:35,050
Yeah, well...

773
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,250
maybe I'll see you there.

774
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,550
Yeah. Thanks.

775
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,150
God, what a dork.

776
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,950
You're just jealous.

777
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,850
Trust me, at this point,
I'm past the fact...

778
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,250
that every single guy
likes you better than me.

779
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,850
Oh, face it. You just hate
every single guy...

780
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,150
on the face of the earth.

781
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,250
That's not true.

782
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,650
I just hate all
these extroverted, obnoxious...

783
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,150
pseudo-bohemian losers.

784
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,350
The Donnie G show.
Donnie G!

785
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,750
Nothing but classic rock...

786
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,150
coming at you
this beautiful evening.

787
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,250
You're listening to KFTO--

788
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:12,150
God, that asshole's voice
is so hateful.

789
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,850
No wonder
I never listen to the radio.

790
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,050
Relax, Seymour. Relax.

791
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,550
He's just so shrill
and loud and piercing.

792
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:22,150
I feel like I'm being
jabbed in the face.

793
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,350
"KTO coming at you
on this beautiful evening."

794
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,850
- So...
- Thank you.

795
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,950
Why'd you bring the record?

796
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,250
I brought it
so he can autograph it.

797
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,650
He's going to be amazed
to see it.

798
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:38,750
It's one
of only two known copies.

799
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,550
I can't believe they have him
as the opening act...

800
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:41,850
and not the headliner.

801
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:44,450
It's-- What an insult.

802
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,650
There's gonna be lots of girls
to pick from at this bar.

803
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,550
I'm not holding my breath
in that department.

804
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,950
What, are we
in slow motion here?

805
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,750
What are you, hypnotized?

806
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,550
Have some more kids,
why don't you?

807
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,750
Jesus Christ, move it!

808
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,850
Seymour! God.

809
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,450
I can't believe these people.

810
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,550
They could at least turn off
their stupid sports game...

811
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:21,950
until he's done playing.

812
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,650
Thank you.

813
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:36,850
Don't go away.

814
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,250
We got Blues Hammer
coming up in just a minute.

815
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,150
Hey, check that out.

816
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:47,550
She's nice, but, you know...

817
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:49,750
Offer her a seat.

818
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,150
- I'll do it.
- No, no, no, no.

819
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:54,650
Wait. Let me think of something
to say to her first.

820
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,050
That was great music, huh?

821
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,150
Yeah, I just love blues.

822
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:24,950
Actually, technically,
what he was mostly playing...

823
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,450
would more accurately be
classified in the ragtime idiom.

824
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,150
Although, of course,
not in the strictest sense...

825
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:36,450
of the classical
ragtime piano music...

826
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:41,050
like that of Scott Joplin
or Joseph Lamb.

827
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,550
Authentic blues
has a more conventional...

828
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:47,450
twelve-bar structure
in its stanzas.

829
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:50,450
Oh. If you like
authentic blues...

830
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,850
you really gotta check out
Blues Hammer.

831
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,450
They're so great.

832
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,250
All right, people,
are you ready to boogie?

833
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:52,250
'Cause we gonna play
some authentic...

834
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,750
way-down-in-the-delta blues.

835
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,450
So get ready
to rock your world!

836
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:08,450
Well, I been plowin'
behind the mule, son

837
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,650
Picking cotton all day long

838
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:16,850
Yes, I been plowin'

839
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,450
Picking cotton all day long

840
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,750
I said, Lordy, baby

841
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,450
But my woman she be gone

842
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:37,750
Now I remember why I haven't
been anywhere in months.

843
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,150
It's simple for everybody else.

844
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,850
You give them a Big Mac
and a pair of Nikes...

845
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,050
and they're happy.

846
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:46,350
I can't relate to
ninety-nine percent of humanity.

847
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,450
I can't relate to humanity,
either...

848
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,350
but I don't think
it's completely hopeless.

849
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,650
Well, it's not
completely hopeless for you.

850
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,150
I'm not even
in the same universe...

851
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,950
as those creatures back there.

852
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,150
We just need
to find you a place...

853
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,250
where you can meet someone...

854
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,450
who isn't a complete idiot,
that's all.

855
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,950
Why do you care so much
if I get a date or not?

856
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,450
I don't know.

857
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,150
I guess I just can't stand
the idea of a world...

858
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,050
where a guy like you
can't get a date.

859
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,750
What is this, Seymour?

860
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,150
Oh, that.

861
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,050
I borrowed that from work
about fifteen years ago.

862
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,950
I guess it's mine now.

863
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,850
What are you,
a Klansman or something?

864
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:34,350
Yeah, I'm a Klansman.

865
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,650
You know
the Cook's Chicken franchise?

866
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,550
"Four-piece Cook's special...

867
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:44,450
"deep-fried with side and slaw.
It's outrageous!"

868
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:47,950
Yeah, well,
Cook's is just a made up name.

869
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,950
Back in 1922...

870
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,150
they were originally called
Coon Chicken Inn.

871
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,350
That's an early painting
of their first logo.

872
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,650
How come everybody
doesn't know this?

873
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,250
It's ancient history.

874
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:26,450
Same reason nobody knows about
this Lionel Belasco record.

875
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,950
I was more interested in
the whole Cook's phenomenon...

876
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,350
when I was about your age.

877
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,650
Sort of lost interest
when I started working for them.

878
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,050
You work for Cook's Chicken?

879
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,050
For nineteen years.

880
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,650
Were you a fry cook
or something?

881
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,750
Nothing so glamorous, actually.

882
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,250
I'm an assistant manager
at their corporate headquarters.

883
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:53,250
Jesus. I'd go nuts if I had
to work in an office all day.

884
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,450
So I don't really get it.

885
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,550
Are you saying that things
were better back then...

886
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,150
even though
there was stuff like this?

887
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:05,650
I suppose
things are better now, but...

888
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,050
I don't know, it's complicated.

889
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,250
People still hate each other...

890
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,850
but they just know
how to hide it better.

891
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:14,450
Can I borrow this?

892
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:16,750
For what?

893
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:18,250
I promise
I'll take good care of it.

894
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,750
They're very sensitive about
that kind of stuff at work.

895
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:25,150
Don't you trust me, Seymour?

896
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:29,650
Let's address discussion
to this piece.

897
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,050
I don't like it.

898
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,350
Can you tell us why?

899
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:38,050
I don't know.

900
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,950
I think it's totally weird.

901
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,850
It's totally offensive.

902
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,150
Yeah. I agree.

903
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,350
It's not right.

904
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:47,450
Well, these are
all valid comments, but...

905
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:49,150
I think we should see
if the artist...

906
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,950
has anything to bring to this.

907
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:56,250
Well, I found this when
I was doing some research...

908
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,350
and I discovered
that Cook's Chicken...

909
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,750
used to be called Coon Chicken.

910
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:05,550
So I decided to do my project
based on this discovery...

911
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:09,550
as kind of a comment
on racism...

912
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:12,050
and how it's whitewashed over
in our culture.

913
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,350
Did you actually
do this painting?

914
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:19,450
Well, no,
it's more of a found art object.

915
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:22,850
How do you think this addresses
the subject of racism?

916
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,150
It's complicated.

917
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,650
I guess I'm trying to show...

918
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,450
how racism used to be
more out in the open...

919
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,450
and now it's hidden
or something.

920
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,750
And how do you think
an image like this...

921
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,350
helps us to see that?

922
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:40,250
I'm not sure.

923
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,550
I guess because when
we see something like this...

924
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,250
it seems really shocking.

925
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:52,250
And we have to wonder
why it's so shocking.

926
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,350
I don't really
know what to say, Enid.

927
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,350
I think
it's a remarkable achievement.

928
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,250
I'm going to let you handle
the 4:30 crowd by yourself.

929
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,950
That way, I can evaluate your
performance while it's slow.

930
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:15,850
Then we'll ease you
into the big crowds, all right?

931
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:18,050
- You can count on me, sir.
- Cool.

932
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:26,150
Do you serve beer
or any alcohol?

933
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,950
I wish.

934
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:29,750
Actually, you wish.

935
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,650
After about five minutes
of this movie...

936
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:33,550
you're going to wish
you had ten beers.

937
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:44,550
What are you doing? You don't
ever criticize the feature.

938
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:45,850
Why?
What's the difference?

939
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,850
I mean,
we already got his money.

940
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,950
Look, that's the policy, OK?

941
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,550
If you want to make up
your own rules...

942
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,950
open up your own theater.

943
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,950
And let me have lots of butter
on it.

944
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,450
Here you go.

945
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:16,150
Smothered in delicious
yellow chemical sludge.

946
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:22,750
What the hell is wrong with you?

947
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,250
What?

948
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,150
I was just joking around
with the customers.

949
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,650
- It's my shtick.
- Well, lose it.

950
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:32,050
And why aren't you
pushing the larger sizes?

951
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,250
Didn't you get training
about up-sizing?

952
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,250
Yeah,
but I feel really weird.

953
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:38,850
It's pretty sleazy.

954
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:43,250
It's not optional!

955
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:49,050
Jesus.

956
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,050
Hi. Can I get a medium 7 Up?

957
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,350
Medium?

958
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:59,050
Why, sir, do you not know
that for a mere 25 cents more...

959
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:01,050
you could purchase
a large beverage?

960
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,050
And you know,
I'm only telling you this...

961
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,950
because we're such good friends.

962
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,450
Medium
is really only for suckers...

963
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,650
who don't know
the concept of value.

964
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:12,450
What are you talking about?

965
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:14,950
What kind of loser gets fired
after one day?

966
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,950
Look, I told you.
The manager was a total asshole.

967
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,150
I'll get another job.

968
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:23,150
Besides, I have some ideas
to make money in the meantime.

969
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:30,250
I can't believe you're selling
some of this stuff.

970
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:33,250
Fuck it.
Everything must go.

971
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,050
I remember this hat.

972
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:43,650
This was during
your little old lady phase.

973
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:46,550
How much is this?

974
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,850
That's not for sale.

975
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,750
Wait a minute.
It says five dollars.

976
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,750
I know, it's...

977
01:02:58,750 --> 01:02:59,950
That's a mistake.

978
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,850
I'm not selling it.

979
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,750
What was that all about?

980
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,150
I thought
"everything must go".

981
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,650
Yeah, right.

982
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:17,950
Like I'd let some asshole
with a soul patch own Goofy Gus.

983
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:20,750
How much for this dress?

984
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,450
God, I can't believe
you're selling that.

985
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,650
That's five hundred dollars.

986
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:32,550
- What?
- Five hundred.

987
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,650
You're crazy.
It should be, like, two dollars.

988
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:38,150
I was wearing that
when I lost my virginity.

989
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,450
Why do I care about that?

990
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,150
Why do you want it?

991
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,850
It would look stupid on you
anyway.

992
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:46,850
God! Fuck you!

993
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:52,050
So, now are you going to get
a regular job?

994
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:58,450
Do you want to do something
tonight?

995
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,350
I can't.
It's Seymour's birthday tonight.

996
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,350
Oh, shit.
What time is it?

997
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:05,850
I'm supposed to go to the store.
I was going to make him a cake.

998
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,850
Do you still want to go shopping
tomorrow?

999
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:10,050
Yeah, I guess. Call me.

1000
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,150
Since when can you make a cake?

1001
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,250
OK, you can open your eyes now.

1002
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:38,550
Oh, hey. Thanks, Enid.
I really appreciate it.

1003
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,650
No, blow it out, doofus.

1004
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,150
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1005
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:53,550
Oh, it's just my stupid back.
I'll be all right in a minute.

1006
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,850
What is that?

1007
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,150
It's...

1008
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,250
It's just this elastic thing
I have to wear sometimes...

1009
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,950
for lumbar support.

1010
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:08,550
What, like a girdle?

1011
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,350
Maybe now you can understand
why I can't get a date.

1012
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:16,750
Well, at least
you're not the only one.

1013
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,050
I think only stupid people
have good relationships.

1014
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:23,050
That's the spirit.

1015
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:26,050
Actually, there is this one guy
I have a crush on right now...

1016
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,550
but...
totally fucked-up situation.

1017
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:32,750
Oh, yeah?

1018
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,650
Yeah. You met him, remember?
That guy Josh.

1019
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,150
But I can't do anything
about it...

1020
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,350
because Becky
would totally freak out.

1021
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:41,850
Why?

1022
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:43,950
Just forget it.
It's complicated.

1023
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,450
Aren't you going to get that?

1024
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,050
Let the machine get it.

1025
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,650
I have no desire to talk to
anyone who might be calling me.

1026
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,550
I knew it. It's my mother.

1027
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:05,650
Hi, I'm calling for...

1028
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,950
You placed an ad in "The Weekly"
over a month ago, and...

1029
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:11,850
well, I'm the blonde
in the yellow dress.

1030
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:13,550
At least, I think I am.

1031
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,550
I saw the ad
when you first placed it...

1032
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:17,350
but I was in this relationship
at the time...

1033
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:19,350
so I cut the ad out, and...

1034
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,950
and I'm not
in a relationship anymore.

1035
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,650
God, this is really confusing.

1036
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,850
Don't!

1037
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,450
Anyway, if you still want
to talk to me...

1038
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:30,150
I can be reached at 555-2673.

1039
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,850
That's my work number...

1040
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:36,050
and my name is Dana.

1041
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:38,450
OK! Bye.

1042
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,250
Wow.

1043
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,450
What was all that about?

1044
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:47,850
It's just somebody's idea
of a joke.

1045
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,050
That didn't sound like
a joke to me.

1046
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:55,350
What, did you place an ad
in the personals or something?

1047
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:58,650
Yeah, a long time ago.

1048
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:02,450
She called before. It's just
somebody trying to humiliate me.

1049
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,850
I think
you should call her back.

1050
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,050
Oh, look.
We have to get these.

1051
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:24,750
You know, I can't afford
stuff like this right now.

1052
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,850
Look, I'm sick of waiting.

1053
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:28,150
I mean, we have to get stuff
if we're ever going to move.

1054
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,150
Aren't these the greatest?

1055
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:37,750
What? They're nice.

1056
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:41,850
I can't imagine spending money
on plastic cups.

1057
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:44,550
You don't have to.
I'll pay for everything now...

1058
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:46,850
and you can pay me back
when you finally get a job.

1059
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:48,150
You're insane.

1060
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:51,150
So, are we still going
to that thing tonight?

1061
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,650
What thing?

1062
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:55,650
You know, that guy's band
is playing tonight.

1063
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,150
Alien Autopsy.

1064
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:59,850
Actually,
Seymour's big date is tonight.

1065
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,650
And I kind of want to be around
when he calls...

1066
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,450
you know, so I can hear
how badly it went.

1067
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:05,550
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.

1068
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,250
That was great.

1069
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:15,350
Jeez, thanks a lot for cooking.

1070
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,750
I love to cook.

1071
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:22,650
Most women wouldn't invite a guy
over on the first date, but...

1072
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:24,850
I think you should trust
your instincts.

1073
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:26,150
When I talked to you
on the phone...

1074
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:30,350
you just seemed so...
I don't know, so harmless.

1075
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,850
Thanks.

1076
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,550
I love this song.

1077
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,350
Isn't it great?

1078
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:03,550
Doesn't it
make you want to dance?

1079
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:06,150
- Come on.
- No, I don't really dance.

1080
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:08,450
Come on, Seymour.
Don't be silly.

1081
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,250
Anybody can dance.

1082
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:12,150
Here, follow me. Watch my feet.

1083
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:14,650
No, really.

1084
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,550
Come on, Seymour.

1085
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,750
Just feel the music.

1086
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:21,650
Loosen up.
It's all in your head.

1087
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:24,750
Here, let's put down
your bowl of ice cream.

1088
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:27,050
Wow, it's 9:00 already.

1089
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:29,350
If we're gonna make that movie,
don't you think we should go?

1090
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:32,750
OK. Party pooper.

1091
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,850
I'm so excited
to see this film.

1092
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:52,650
Dustoff Varnya
is such a brilliant director.

1093
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:54,150
Did you see his last film...

1094
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:55,950
"The Flower
That Drank The Moon"?

1095
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,450
It was glorious.

1096
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:00,750
Must have missed that one.

1097
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,450
Then again, what do I know?
I like Laurel and Hardy movies.

1098
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:07,150
Really?
I never really cared for those.

1099
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:10,150
Why does the fat one always have
to be so mean to the skinny one?

1100
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:30,850
- Hello?
- Hey. It's me.

1101
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:34,350
- Oh, hi.
- So, what happened?

1102
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:36,950
Actually,
it's still kind of happening.

1103
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:40,650
She's over here right now.
I think it's going pretty well.

1104
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,850
- What? You're joking.
- Yeah, so I better go.

1105
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:45,650
It's not really
the best time to talk, OK?

1106
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:48,450
What, are you going to have sex
with her on your first date?

1107
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:53,250
Jesus! I'll talk to you
later, OK? Bye.

1108
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,450
That was my mother.

1109
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:21,150
Do you still want
to do something tonight?

1110
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,650
What happened to Seymour?

1111
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,750
I can't believe this.
He actually scored.

1112
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:28,150
God, how repulsive.

1113
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,150
So, should I come over?

1114
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:34,250
Actually, I was just about
to go out with some friends.

1115
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:37,650
What are you talking about?
Who?

1116
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:39,850
Just some people from work.

1117
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:43,750
I don't believe you.

1118
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:47,050
You said you were busy, so...

1119
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:50,250
Look, I better get going.

1120
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:53,050
I guess I'll call you tomorrow.

1121
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,950
Boo!

1122
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,150
Please.

1123
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,550
Boy.

1124
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:45,250
So, where have you been?

1125
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:46,950
I've been looking
all over for you.

1126
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:49,250
I've been wandering the streets
day and night...

1127
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:50,950
trying to find you.

1128
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,050
Really?

1129
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:54,950
No. Joe told me where you are.

1130
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:00,250
But how come you never call me
anymore?

1131
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:05,050
I'm sorry.
I've just been really busy.

1132
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:11,150
So, how are things going with...

1133
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:13,650
What's her name? Dana?

1134
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:17,350
Pretty well.
Surprisingly, you know.

1135
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:20,450
It's good.

1136
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:25,850
What do you do together? Is she
into your old records and stuff?

1137
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:30,750
Yeah, sort of. I mean,
she doesn't dislike that stuff.

1138
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,050
Anyway, she's trying.

1139
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,250
Actually, we're supposed to go
antique shopping...

1140
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:37,150
for her apartment
this afternoon.

1141
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,550
Sounds good.

1142
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:42,250
So, we should get together.

1143
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:47,750
I'll definitely give you a call
this week or something.

1144
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,850
Are you trying to get rid of me?

1145
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:52,550
No, no, no.
It's just that I...

1146
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:54,850
I should be going
in a few minutes, and...

1147
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:01,150
Aren't you even going to ask
how I'm doing?

1148
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,850
Sorry.

1149
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:06,650
So, how are you?

1150
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:11,250
I don't know.
Good, I guess.

1151
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,250
Oh, hello.
Guess I'm a little early.

1152
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:25,550
- This is Enid.
- Hello.

1153
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:28,750
It's great to finally meet you.

1154
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:32,650
So, how do you two
know each other?

1155
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,950
I'm kind of surprised
he hasn't mentioned me.

1156
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:37,750
- We're old friends.
- Really?

1157
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,750
Yeah. Very close.

1158
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,650
In fact, I was standing
right next to him...

1159
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,150
the first day you called.

1160
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:45,950
You know, if it wasn't for me...

1161
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:48,350
he would have never
called you back.

1162
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,950
- Is that right?
- I would have--

1163
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,850
Well,
I've really got to get going...

1164
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:56,450
but I'll stop by and see you
sometime, Seymour.

1165
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:01,350
It really was great to meet you.

1166
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:06,750
Now remember,
the art show is this Saturday...

1167
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,350
7:30 p.m., sharp.

1168
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,250
Oh, and Justin.

1169
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,050
I'm sorry.

1170
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:22,450
I'm gonna really miss
all of you people.

1171
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:25,350
I hope that each of you
feels as if you'll be...

1172
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:28,650
taking away something
from this experience.

1173
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,550
Thanks.
So long, everyone.

1174
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:40,850
Enid, can I speak to you
for a moment?

1175
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:43,350
- Uh-oh.
- Don't worry, it's nothing bad.

1176
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:45,450
I got a call
from a close friend of mine...

1177
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:47,450
at the Academy of Art
and Design...

1178
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:50,550
and she tells me I'm allowed
to place one student...

1179
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:54,050
from your graduating class for
a full one-year scholarship...

1180
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:57,250
and I took the liberty
of submitting your name.

1181
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,950
As far as I know
it includes housing...

1182
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:01,950
and meals and everything.
It's really quite an offer.

1183
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:06,750
Let me know as soon as you can,
Enid.

1184
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:09,350
This could be a really great
thing for you.

1185
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:19,650
Pumpkin? Honey?

1186
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:21,150
I'm coming in.

1187
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:24,750
Well, I have some good news.

1188
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,950
What is it now?

1189
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:27,550
Are you still looking for a job?

1190
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:29,050
I guess.

1191
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:32,050
Maxine thinks she can get you
a job at Computer Station.

1192
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:35,750
Normally, you have to have
a lot of references....

1193
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,850
and at least
two years of experience...

1194
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:40,650
but she thinks
she can convince them.

1195
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:44,150
Tell her to forget it.
I don't need her help.

1196
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:49,650
OK, that's...

1197
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:52,850
You know, if that's...

1198
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,050
If-- Mm-hmm.

1199
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:13,250
Awful! Just awful!

1200
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,250
I will take care of it,
I promise you.

1201
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,250
I will handle it.
Thank you.

1202
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:21,050
Excuse me.

1203
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:23,650
I'm sorry, I need to speak
with her for a second.

1204
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:25,650
- Well, enjoy the show.
- Thank you.

1205
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:26,750
Yes, what is it, Phyllis?

1206
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:27,950
I am sorry...

1207
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:30,150
but you are simply going to have
to remove that painting.

1208
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:32,150
Several of the parents have
complained about it already.

1209
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:34,650
Well, I will do no such thing.

1210
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,150
Then I'm going to go over there
and take it down myself.

1211
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,850
I think we should
give the artist a chance...

1212
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:43,150
to talk with the parents about
her intentions with this piece.

1213
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:46,250
We should be promoting
discussion as a solution...

1214
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,550
instead of censorship.

1215
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:49,150
- Censorship?
- Yes.

1216
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,750
Oh, that is such a big word
for you, Roberta.

1217
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:53,850
Excuse me.

1218
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:56,650
- Do not touch that--
- OK, I have a solution.

1219
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:57,950
Thank you, everyone,
for your patience.

1220
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:03,250
Margaret, have you seen Enid?

1221
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:06,150
- I don't think she's even here.
- You're kidding.

1222
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:11,350
- All right. There we go.
- Thank you very much.

1223
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,350
So-- Excuse me.

1224
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,550
So there's this stupid art show
I'm going to tonight...

1225
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,050
and I want you to be my date.

1226
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:30,350
There's something
I want to show you.

1227
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:33,450
Yeah, I...
I don't think I should.

1228
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:34,550
Of course you should.

1229
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:36,850
I'm already
a million hours late. Come on.

1230
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,350
I better not.

1231
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:43,750
OK, well, forget the art show.
Let's do something else, then.

1232
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:47,250
I really wish I could,
Enid, but...

1233
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:51,250
Dana just got out
of a really bad relationship...

1234
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,950
and I don't want her to have
the wrong idea, you know?

1235
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:55,550
Hey, what's happening?

1236
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:01,350
Where'd you get those pants?

1237
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:05,450
They were a present from Dana.

1238
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,750
You like them? They a good fit?

1239
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:12,750
Yeah, whatever. I mean,
what do I know about clothes?

1240
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,250
It's nice to have somebody
do all the work for me.

1241
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,350
I'll just be in my room.

1242
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:26,250
What's her deal, anyway?

1243
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,750
Did she actually tell you
that you can't see me anymore?

1244
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:31,450
No. No, I mean...

1245
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:35,750
Not exactly. She just...

1246
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:42,150
She just doesn't understand how
I would know someone like you.

1247
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,450
What does that mean,
"someone like me"?

1248
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:47,550
Just someone so young.

1249
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:55,250
Don't worry.
I won't bother you anymore.

1250
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:51,750
Do you remember me?

1251
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:56,050
Sure. Sure.

1252
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:06,350
You're, like, the only person
in this world I can count on...

1253
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:10,650
because, no matter what,
I know you'll always be here.

1254
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:16,650
Well, that's what you think.

1255
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:20,850
I'm leaving town.

1256
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:28,250
Where are we? This is
such a weird neighborhood.

1257
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,750
This is a totally normal,
average neighborhood.

1258
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:33,850
3128.

1259
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:35,850
- That must be it.
- Great.

1260
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:41,050
What? What's wrong with it?
It looks totally normal.

1261
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:42,650
What? I said great.

1262
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:44,150
Yeah, I can tell
you really love it.

1263
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,350
What am I supposed to say?

1264
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:48,150
"Gee, I can't wait to live
in some depressing shit-hole...

1265
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:49,350
"out in the middle of nowhere"?

1266
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:51,950
You know, you hate every single
place that we look at.

1267
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:56,250
Why don't you just tell me
you don't want to live with me?

1268
01:21:58,450 --> 01:22:02,250
Because you'll totally freak out
and act like a psycho about it.

1269
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,250
What?

1270
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:05,550
You're the psycho.

1271
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:08,650
You've totally ignored me
ever since high school ended.

1272
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:12,550
You're still living out some
stupid seventh-grade fantasy!

1273
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:13,850
"Your own apartment."

1274
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:15,550
Fuck you.

1275
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:18,650
Have fun living with your dad
for the rest of your life.

1276
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:27,950
God. Fuck you, too.

1277
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,150
Pumpkin?

1278
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,650
Pumpkin?

1279
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:39,150
Honey?

1280
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:40,750
What's wrong?

1281
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:46,050
Nothing.

1282
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:47,550
Because, honey,
if something's wrong...

1283
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:50,050
I'd love it
if we could talk about it.

1284
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,350
It's nothing.
It's just some hormonal thing.

1285
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:55,950
Don't worry about it.

1286
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:59,750
OK, because I have some
very, very important news...

1287
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,850
to talk about...

1288
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:06,250
and if you're not feeling well,
we can do this some other time.

1289
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:09,950
What?

1290
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:15,550
Well, Maxine and I have been
seeing a lot of each other.

1291
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:17,450
And we were thinking
it might be really best...

1292
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:20,950
for all of us
if at the end of the summer...

1293
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:22,650
she came here to live with us.

1294
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,450
We could really just see
how we got along together...

1295
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:28,150
and see if this is--

1296
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:45,050
Is this your first death mask?

1297
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:47,450
All artists have to suffer.

1298
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:50,950
Just a minute.

1299
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:55,750
I brought the application
for the art academy.

1300
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,950
I just hope it's not too late.

1301
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:02,250
I am so sorry
about what happened, Enid.

1302
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:04,450
What do you mean?

1303
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:06,650
Well, the whole business
with the art show...

1304
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:10,550
and the newspaper--
it's just absolutely...

1305
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:12,650
They're forcing me
to give you...

1306
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:15,550
a non-passing grade
in the class.

1307
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:19,950
Can't I still get a scholarship
to the art academy?

1308
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:22,550
- Well, I'm sorry, Enid--
- Can you help me out here?

1309
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:25,550
- I can't breath under this mask.
- Excuse me.

1310
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:29,050
That's fine. Just breathe.
Don't worry about it.

1311
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:50,150
Hey, what are you doing here?

1312
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:52,250
I needed to see you.

1313
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,550
What's up?

1314
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:57,050
Can you at least let me in?

1315
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,650
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1316
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:02,950
Look, I just need someone to be
nice to me for five minutes...

1317
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:05,250
and then I swear
I'll leave you alone, OK?

1318
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:07,750
What's the matter?

1319
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:11,250
Do you have anything to drink?

1320
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:13,950
There might be some root beer.

1321
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:17,750
- What's this?
- That's Dana's.

1322
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:20,150
We're supposed to be saving it
for our two-month anniversary.

1323
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:21,350
You better not--

1324
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:33,550
I mean, you like me,
right, Seymour?

1325
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:35,050
We're good friends, right?

1326
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:37,650
Yeah, sure. Of course.

1327
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,050
What is this?

1328
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:57,250
Dana got it when
we went shopping for antiques.

1329
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:58,750
She said
it didn't go with her stuff...

1330
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:01,250
so she gave it to me.

1331
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:05,350
Said it would go better
with my old-time thingamajigs.

1332
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:11,150
Jesus, how can you stand her?

1333
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,250
How come all that time I was
trying to get you a date...

1334
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,750
you never asked me out?

1335
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:21,550
You're a beautiful young girl.

1336
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:23,750
I couldn't imagine
you'd have any interest in me...

1337
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:27,750
except as an amusingly cranky
eccentric curiosity.

1338
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:30,850
At least you're not like every
other stupid guy in the world.

1339
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:33,850
All they care about
is guitars or sports.

1340
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:36,350
I hate sports.

1341
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:44,450
Maybe I should just move in
with you.

1342
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:48,050
I could do the cooking
and dust your old records...

1343
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:49,950
until I get a job.

1344
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:58,050
You know what my number one
fantasy used to be?

1345
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:01,250
What?

1346
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:04,350
I used to think about one day...

1347
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:08,550
just not telling anyone and
going off to some random place.

1348
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:15,750
And I'd just disappear...

1349
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:18,050
and they'd never see me again.

1350
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:20,550
Do you ever think about stuff
like that?

1351
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:24,350
I guess I probably did
when I was your age.

1352
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:29,050
You know what we should do?

1353
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:32,450
We should just get in your car
right now and just drive off.

1354
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:34,850
Just find
some totally new place...

1355
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,450
and start a whole new life.

1356
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:38,550
Fuck everybody.

1357
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:43,950
I'm not
in any good condition to drive.

1358
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:46,950
I'm serious.

1359
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:49,050
I'm just so sick of everybody.

1360
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:51,850
Why can't I just do what I want?

1361
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:54,350
What do you want?

1362
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:58,250
What do you want?

1363
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,850
Don't you like me?

1364
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:25,650
Boy, I never expected
anything like this to happen.

1365
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:31,250
Yeah, well, me, neither.

1366
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:34,250
You must know I always...

1367
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:39,950
Did you mean all that stuff
about moving in with me?

1368
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:46,350
I was just thinking out loud.

1369
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:53,050
I mean, you've got this thing
with Dana, and...

1370
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:54,750
I'm not gonna let you
fuck that up.

1371
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:58,450
Yeah, but I don't know,
I just...

1372
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:04,150
I really need to get some sleep.

1373
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:09,550
Good night.

1374
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:44,450
Right. One second.

1375
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:49,450
- Sorry. Go ahead.
- We're almost done.

1376
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:52,250
Hi. Yeah.
No, it's excluded.

1377
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:55,150
They've already paid
the earnest money.

1378
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:56,350
Well, let's see
if they bring it up...

1379
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:59,550
if they notice it
on the final walkthrough.

1380
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:00,750
Right.

1381
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:03,950
Great. Sounds good.

1382
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,950
- Yes!
- We did it!

1383
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,650
- Great job.
- Thank you.

1384
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:12,950
I'm proud of you.
I'll catch you guys later.

1385
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:14,950
I'm going to start
the paperwork.

1386
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:21,450
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Have a seat.

1387
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:28,750
So, what brings you down here?

1388
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:37,650
I just really feel like
I need to say something to you.

1389
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:42,250
I've never said this
to anyone before.

1390
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:44,750
Believe me, I've...

1391
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:47,850
I've stayed in horrible
relationships for years...

1392
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:50,150
just so I wouldn't have
to do this.

1393
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:53,150
What are you trying to say?

1394
01:30:55,850 --> 01:31:00,050
Maybe it's not such a good idea
that we keep going out.

1395
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:12,150
It's Enid. Leave a message.

1396
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:15,250
Seymour, here.

1397
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:18,750
I really want to talk to you.

1398
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:20,950
I've been thinking about
what you said...

1399
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:23,650
about moving in here, and...

1400
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:28,450
Yeah, so just...

1401
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:30,150
give me a call
when you get a chance.

1402
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:31,550
OK. Thanks. Bye.

1403
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:44,450
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other day.

1404
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:46,550
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1405
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:48,250
I really do want
to move in with you.

1406
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:50,450
Look, I don't know.

1407
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:55,650
I was thinking maybe I should
just live alone, you know?

1408
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:59,750
I've decided to rent that place
that we looked at...

1409
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:03,450
and I start moving in
next week.

1410
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:07,050
Please let me come with you.
Please.

1411
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:10,050
Look, I don't know. I don't
think it's such a good idea.

1412
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:12,550
Of course it's a good idea.
It's our plan.

1413
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:14,650
Yeah, but how are you going
to pay rent and everything?

1414
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,450
You don't even have a job.

1415
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:19,650
I'll get a job tomorrow.
I promise.

1416
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:22,650
Maxine said she could get me
a job at Computer Station.

1417
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:26,450
Please, Becca.

1418
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:30,350
Tonight,
I have a very special partner--

1419
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:33,750
one who is
a performance artist...

1420
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,950
in sign language for the deaf.

1421
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:38,450
Please welcome to the stage...

1422
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:43,750
Well, here's where the fun
never stops.

1423
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:46,250
She could at least have
the decency to call me back.

1424
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:50,850
Wasted time, trying to logically
figure out the female brain.

1425
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:53,150
That's for sure.

1426
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,850
Maybe she got another boyfriend.

1427
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:00,150
Yeah, well,
thanks for cheering me up.

1428
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:15,150
Oh, God.

1429
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:27,350
It's Enid. Leave a message.

1430
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:33,050
Oh, come on.

1431
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:36,350
Hey, look at it this way...

1432
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:39,350
at least
things can't get any worse.

1433
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:50,950
Seymour!
Just the man I want to see.

1434
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:53,150
Step in here for a minute.

1435
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:57,650
Have a seat.

1436
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:02,750
What can you tell me about this,
Seymour?

1437
01:34:12,650 --> 01:34:14,050
So, what do you think?

1438
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,550
It's fine.

1439
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:22,750
- Where's all your stuff?
- There.

1440
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:29,450
That's all you're bringing?

1441
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:31,050
No. I'm gonna pack up the rest
tonight.

1442
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:33,350
I'll bring it over
sometime tomorrow.

1443
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:35,750
What time?

1444
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:38,450
I don't know. Noon?

1445
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:41,150
All right, cool. Just make sure
you're here by then...

1446
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:43,650
because we got
a lot of stuff to do.

1447
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,550
Oh, wait.

1448
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:48,050
I got to show you this.
It's really cool.

1449
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:55,450
Isn't it great?

1450
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:31,350
A smile is something special

1451
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:34,450
A ribbon is something rare

1452
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:37,050
So I'll be special,
and I'll be rare

1453
01:35:37,150 --> 01:35:41,550
With a smile
and a ribbon in my hair

1454
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:45,450
To be a girl they notice

1455
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:48,050
Takes more than a fancy dress

1456
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:51,250
So I'll be special,
and I'll be rare

1457
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:54,450
I'll be something beyond compare

1458
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:56,950
I'll be noticed
because I'll wear

1459
01:35:56,950 --> 01:36:02,650
A smile and a ribbon in my hair

1460
01:36:32,650 --> 01:36:35,250
What's wrong with you, retard?
It's 3:30.

1461
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:39,850
Oh, hi. Enid's stepmother
told me that she'd be here.

1462
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:41,450
She's not at home?

1463
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:43,750
No, they told me
that she'd be here.

1464
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:45,850
Well, where the fuck is she?

1465
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:48,050
She was supposed to be here
three hours ago.

1466
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:51,850
Do you mind if I wait?
I really need to talk to her.

1467
01:36:57,850 --> 01:36:59,050
Are you sure she wasn't there?

1468
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:01,650
I mean, maybe she was just
hiding from you or something.

1469
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:04,050
Why would she be hiding from me?

1470
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:06,050
I don't know.

1471
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:08,050
Where is she, then?

1472
01:37:09,850 --> 01:37:11,150
Maybe she's with Josh?

1473
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:14,650
Josh?
Why would she be with Josh?

1474
01:37:14,650 --> 01:37:18,550
I really don't know enough
about it to...

1475
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:22,150
But why did you say
that she was hiding from me?

1476
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:23,850
Did she say anything to you
about me?

1477
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:27,250
Yeah.
She thinks you're a dork.

1478
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:29,450
She said that?

1479
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:35,250
What do you expect? I mean,
considering how we met you...

1480
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:37,250
What do you mean?

1481
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:39,350
She didn't tell you about that?

1482
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:43,050
What are you talking about?

1483
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:46,550
On that pathetic
fake blind date?

1484
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:49,650
What fake blind date?
What are you talking about?

1485
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:55,650
Here.

1486
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,050
Look.

1487
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:33,750
Did you have a good laugh
at my expense?

1488
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:36,350
What do you mean?

1489
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:39,050
Do you think that's funny?

1490
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:42,550
Here, is that funny?

1491
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:44,650
I'll show you something funny.

1492
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:51,350
- Hey. Damn it. Come on.
- Get--

1493
01:38:57,250 --> 01:39:00,650
Not so cool now, are you,
good-looking boy?

1494
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:02,650
- What's going on?
- Call the cops, man.

1495
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:03,850
- Citizen's arrest.
- You!

1496
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:05,350
Call the cops!

1497
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:06,550
Get the hell out of my store!

1498
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:09,050
All right.
Hey, no need to get violent.

1499
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:10,250
I'm outta here.

1500
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:39,150
Are you OK?

1501
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:49,050
You seem a little stoned.
What are you on?

1502
01:39:50,350 --> 01:39:52,050
High on life.

1503
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:55,050
Look, Seymour,
I came by to tell you...

1504
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:58,650
how really, really sorry
I am about everything.

1505
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,250
I know you probably
totally hate me.

1506
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:01,650
You don't have to say--

1507
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:04,450
Please. Don't say anything.

1508
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:07,250
I know I'm a total
disappointment to everyone.

1509
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:12,150
I just quit my job
this morning...

1510
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:14,250
and then I had a fight
with Becky...

1511
01:40:14,350 --> 01:40:16,150
because I told her I wasn't
going to move in with her...

1512
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:20,250
and she really
just wants to kill me.

1513
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:25,250
And there is just no way
to explain how I feel.

1514
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:26,550
I don't...

1515
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:32,450
I guess I'll just have
to figure myself out.

1516
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:34,650
Enid, I'm not mad at you.

1517
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:36,250
I know I'm just a dork.

1518
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:38,750
Seymour, you are not a dork.

1519
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:42,050
Sure I am.

1520
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:58,150
You are such a stupid idiot.

1521
01:40:58,150 --> 01:41:00,450
Did you even look through
the rest of the book?

1522
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:06,250
See?

1523
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:19,850
You're like...my hero.

1524
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:34,850
Thanks for waiting.

1525
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:42,150
Is he going to be OK?

1526
01:41:42,150 --> 01:41:44,350
I think he'll be fine.

1527
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:56,050
What are you going to do now?

1528
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:00,450
I'm not sure.

1529
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:05,550
I'd better get going.
I'm going to be late for work.

1530
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:10,750
Call me, OK?

1531
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:25,750
I have to admit things are
starting to look up for me...

1532
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:28,350
since my life turned to shit.

1533
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:30,950
Remember what I said
when we first started?

1534
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:32,650
This little break-up might be...

1535
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:34,850
the very best thing
that ever happened to you.

1536
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:39,550
I think I'm ready
to get back to my old life.

1537
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:41,850
You think that's too soon?

1538
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:46,250
Why don't we start with that
next week?

1539
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:49,150
Thank you.

1540
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:50,650
Don't thank me.

1541
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:52,750
You're doing all the work.

1542
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:16,850
- Is he done?
- Yes.

1543
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:18,250
Seymour,
did you have a chance...

1544
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:19,750
to think about what
you might want for dinner...

1545
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:20,850
while you were in here?

1546
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:23,050
No, I haven't.

1547
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:25,850
Maybe we could discuss it
in the car.

1548
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:27,050
Did you want mashed potatoes?

1549
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:28,950
See you next week.

1550
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:59,650
Not so funny now, tough guy,
are you, huh?

1551
01:51:11,550 --> 01:51:13,350
Motherfuckers!
