1
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:08,977
<i>Yeah, you okay?</i>

2
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,641
<i>We have it.</i>

3
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,305
<i>Andreas, we have it.</i>

4
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,633
<i>It works.</i>

5
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:18,472
Jorgen.

6
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:41,876
It gives me great pleasure

7
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,937
to welcome

8
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,345
the director of the institute
and my old friend,

9
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:46,853
Dr. Andreas Jacobsen.

10
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,648
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Pereira.

11
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:05,826
Seventy-five years ago,
Mrs. Nellie Edvardsen,

12
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:07,841
overcome with guilt
by the fortune

13
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:09,498
her late husband's
family had amassed

14
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,357
producing mustard gas
during World War I,

15
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,513
founded our institute

16
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,060
so that the wonders of science

17
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:18,326
could instead be used
to help mankind.

18
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:20,281
In the 1950s,

19
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:24,304
the institute identified
over-population

20
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:28,293
as mankind's single
greatest long-term threat,

21
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:31,418
the cause of all the catastrophes
we are seeing today--

22
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:33,520
extreme climate and
weather events,

23
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:37,130
and the devastating impact
on food and water security.

24
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:41,262
Among the many solutions we
conceived so many years ago,

25
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:42,523
one...

26
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:45,421
which seemed then
so ambitious, so

27
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:46,718
out of our grasp

28
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:48,671
has finally borne fruit.

29
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:50,913
And today we are proud to unveil

30
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:53,843
what we fervently believe
to be the only practical,

31
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:58,147
humane and inclusive remedy
to humanity's greatest problem.

32
00:03:58,607 --> 00:03:59,474
My colleague,

33
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:03,349
Dr. Jorgen Asbjornsen
will now present his findings.

34
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,466
Are you ready, doctor?

35
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,293
Yes, I'm ready.

36
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:36,713
Please take your seats.

37
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:41,148
Please sit down, ladies
and gentlemen, please.

38
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:42,937
Please take your seats,
ladies and gentlemen.

39
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:44,711
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

40
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:46,672
Thank you, thank you.

41
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:55,820
Dr. Pereira, esteemed colleagues.

42
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,789
Five years ago,

43
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:02,507
building on the research of our
predecessors at the institute,

44
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:05,497
my team and I
discovered a process

45
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:08,480
by which all organic
material can be reduced

46
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:12,411
at the cellular level
by a ratio of approximately

47
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:15,935
2,744 to one.

48
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:20,148
Such a process converts
a man of 1.8 meters

49
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,460
to just 12.9 centimeters.

50
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:26,132
A wide array of flora and fauna

51
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,281
were subjected in this process

52
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:32,522
and with the exception
of some fish and shellfish,

53
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:36,077
absolutely no side effects
were detected.

54
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,218
Please, lights.

55
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:44,761
Once the safety of the
procedure was confirmed,

56
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:47,121
{\an8}thirty-six brave volunteers

57
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,957
{\an8}joined my wife
Anne-Helene and me

58
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:53,347
{\an8}as the very first humans
to undergo cellular reduction.

59
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:56,535
The process is short
and painless,

60
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:59,665
with only the mild
discomfort of removal

61
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:02,977
and replacement of dental
and other prosthetics.

62
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:06,294
The subjects are placed
under light sedation,

63
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:07,803
and after a brief rest,

64
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,830
fully recover within
an hour or two.

65
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,310
Once completed,
our little village,

66
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,584
just seven meters
by eleven meters,

67
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:26,435
was place inside
a gas-permeable enclosure

68
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:30,145
designed to protect us
from the hazards of weather,

69
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:33,005
animals and insects.

70
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,024
Thus we set about
to live together

71
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:38,016
in the world's
very first self-sustaining

72
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,017
community of the small.

73
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:44,475
I hold here in my hand

74
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:47,045
all of the uncompostable waste

75
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:50,916
produced by 36 people
over four years.

76
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,460
In this afternoon's session,

77
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:04,882
we will outline our proposal for a
two to three-hundred year transition

78
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:08,186
for the world to transform
from big into small.

79
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:09,904
But for now,

80
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:13,428
I'd like you all to meet
some very special people.

81
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:19,924
Bravo!

82
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,375
Yes!

83
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:26,626
Bravo!

84
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:48,346
And look,
there is little Ronnie Nesthritt,

85
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,150
the first small baby ever born.

86
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:54,596
And his new little
sister Ulrikke.

87
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,175
<i>of the Edvardsen Institute,</i>

88
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:50,800
<i>himself now only ten centimeters
tall and weighing just 18 grams,</i>

89
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:52,879
<i>explained the rationale
behind the invention.</i>

90
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:56,744
Wow! That is wild, isn't it?
Just wild.

91
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:58,151
Say, Holly,

92
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,784
you can go ahead and put
the take-out order in, thanks.

93
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,540
-Is that you?
-Yeah.

94
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:28,118
You hungry?

95
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:30,946
I ate about an hour ago.

96
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:32,891
I didn't know when
you were coming.

97
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:34,573
You knew I was bringing food.

98
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:36,308
I called you and
asked you specifically.

99
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,252
-I just had sesame chicken.
-And then you go and eat.

100
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,629
I'm still hungry.

101
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:41,703
<i>screams premeditation.</i>

102
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,437
<i>Yet relatively few people
knew about his new book.</i>

103
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:47,586
Did you see the news today?

104
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,759
About the little Swedish man?

105
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:51,158
Norwegian.

106
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,715
Yeah, Helen called to
tell me to turn on the TV.

107
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:56,559
What won't they think of next.

108
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,661
Unbelievable. Biggest thing since
landing on the moon. Bigger.

109
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:00,378
Mm.

110
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:01,854
I don't get it.

111
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,464
Why would anybody want
to do that to himself?

112
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:07,155
They can shrink people down,

113
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,288
fly to mars,

114
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:13,106
and they can't cure
my fibromyalgia?

115
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,818
And all this fuss
about the environment

116
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:21,600
though the world's gonna
end tomorrow.

117
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:24,446
I'm in pain.

118
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:26,634
I can't breathe.

119
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:28,337
Doesn't that matter?

120
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:30,778
Lots of people are in pain, Mom.

121
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,458
In all sorts of ways.

122
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:03,657
Hola Carmen.

123
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,188
<i>Are you ready?</i>

124
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:06,586
<i>Strong, strong.</i>

125
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:10,686
<i>Is it usually or more like...</i>

126
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:11,967
tingling?

127
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:14,149
-More like tingling.
-Tingling. Okay.

128
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:18,535
{\an8}<i>This downsizing thing is simply
runaway train technology</i>

129
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:20,597
{\an8}<i>that's having a
devastating impact</i>

130
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:22,285
<i>on our world economy.</i>

131
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:25,715
<i>We're losing billions of dollars
in consumer spending already.</i>

132
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:27,360
<i>It's hurting us
in construction,</i>

133
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:29,782
<i>automobile, housing,
and defense.</i>

134
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:31,648
<i>And then of course,
when we get to politics,</i>

135
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:33,836
{\an8}<i>-Israelis shrinking Palestinians,
-Ron...</i>

136
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,109
{\an8}<i>African dictators</i>

137
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:37,125
{\an8}<i>-shrinking rival ethnic groups.
-Ron. Look, Ron.</i>

138
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:39,607
{\an8}<i>In any major transformation
of society,</i>

139
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,475
{\an8}<i>are there serious growing pains?</i>

140
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:42,403
{\an8}<i>Sure.</i>

141
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,426
{\an8}<i>But at current mass and volume,</i>

142
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:47,022
{\an8}<i>human life on Earth
is unsustainable.</i>

143
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:49,350
You know, that one guy
makes a good point.

144
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:52,000
This family on my block
just moved away to get small,

145
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:53,804
now their house
is just sittin' there.

146
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,593
Makin' everybody's values take
a dive is what they're doin'.

147
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:59,001
Just when I'm tryin'
to refinance.

148
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:01,619
Marlene thinks I should
do it just to lose the weight.

149
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:05,295
You and me both, buddy.

150
00:12:05,944 --> 00:12:08,436
Hey, Dee, is that take-out
order about ready?

151
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,251
Hey, honey, I brought food.

152
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:15,087
I'm not hungry.

153
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:23,998
What's wrong?

154
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:26,350
I have a splitting headache.

155
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:28,748
The store was
super busy and

156
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:31,310
Carla was a total
bitch on wheels.

157
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:32,975
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

158
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:35,037
Here, wait, let me
do the neck thing.

159
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:37,779
Yeah, do the little neck thing.

160
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:39,912
Mm.

161
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:41,512
Just relax, honey.

162
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:44,348
Let me take all the weight.

163
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:49,422
Okay, here's the beautiful
formal living room

164
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,173
with the wonderful fireplace.

165
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:53,944
And come around here,
we have

166
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:56,640
a nice big breakfast
area for the kitchen.

167
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:58,490
Big eating area.

168
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,818
And this kitchen
is just a complete wow.

169
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:04,787
No, it's awesome. Just...

170
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:06,981
maybe we should look again
at that place in Benson.

171
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,271
Come on, let's just
check out the rest.

172
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:11,031
This is great in here,

173
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,476
double oven,
six burner gas stove.

174
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:16,327
It's got this wonderful
butler's pantry over here.

175
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,144
-Oh, hey, Sean.
-Oh, hey, Paul, how you doin'?

176
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:00,035
Good.

177
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,478
Do I look fat?

178
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,861
No, you look very handsome.

179
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,353
Anesthesiology, huh?

180
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,571
My wife says I put people to sleep
even without the drugs, so.

181
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:17,054
Surprised you're still awake.

182
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:19,140
He uses that joke
like twice a week.

183
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:21,038
What's your field, Paul?

184
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:22,326
Uh, occupational therapy.

185
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:23,059
Okay.

186
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,061
Oh, like-like career counseling?

187
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:27,116
Uh, no, it's just like
physical therapy

188
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:29,960
but focused on workplace
injuries and rehab,

189
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:32,796
repetitive stress, lower back,
that sort of thing.

190
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:34,640
A lot of shoulder problems.

191
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,996
I-I'm in-house over
at Omaha Steaks.

192
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:39,426
-He does a lot of paperwork.
-Yeah, well...

193
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,473
I get a little carpal tunnel
of my own from time to time.

194
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:42,534
Tell me about it.

195
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,122
Medicine these days is
all about covering your ass.

196
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:47,971
But weren't you pre-med
down in Lincoln?

197
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:50,464
Good memory, yeah.
I put in two years

198
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:51,995
uh, then my mom got real sick

199
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,221
so I moved back to Omaha
to take care of her.

200
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,378
I wanted to be
a surgeon, actually.

201
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,776
You know, we might've ended
up working together.

202
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,359
I...you could've been
my anesthesiologist.

203
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:03,883
-How 'bout that?
-Yeah.

204
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:20,989
Oh, my God! No way.

It's Dave, Dave Johnson.

209
00:15:40,576 --> 00:15:41,748
And Carol!

210
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:42,630
Can I have a hand?

211
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,162
I-I heard he was coming.

212
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:45,240
I had no idea.

213
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,013
He never struck me as the kind
of guy who'd go get small.

214
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,382

{\an8}-Hey.
-Hi.

221
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:09,231
{\an8}Hope we're not intruding.

222
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,168
{\an8}-No.
-No, Dave.

223
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:12,793
{\an8}Hey, Andy?

224
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:14,926
{\an8}Could you get Carol a, uh...

225
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:17,301
{\an8}Uh, gin and tonic.

226
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:18,808
{\an8}A gin and tonic.

227
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:20,153
{\an8}With lime.

228
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:21,465
{\an8}With lime.

229
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,694
Well, actually, we weren't
planning on coming at all at first.

230
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,068
{\an8}But then, you know, we started
getting all the e-mails.

231
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:30,623
{\an8}Plus my sister was
having a lump removed.

232
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:32,724
{\an8}I mean, she's-she's fine,
thank God.

233
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:34,545
{\an8}But I still needed to see her.

234
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,959
{\an8}So, what's traveling like?

235
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:37,983
{\an8}How'd you guys get up here
from New Mexico?

236
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,626
Oh, gosh, it's great.

237
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:42,540
Yeah, the airlines are getting
more and more small-friendly.

238
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:44,485
All the seats are first-class...

239
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,950
So after a couple of years in
Florida, we moved out to Vegas.

240
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:47,771
And that...

241
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,677
{\an8}Yeah, I think that's the
last time we talked.

242
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:51,607
{\an8}Yeah. Well, Vegas wasn't

243
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:53,552
{\an8}such a good choice for me,
as it turns out.

244
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,146
{\an8}Got into some real bad habits.

245
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:56,545
{\an8}Pretty much hit rock bottom.

246
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,080
Tell ya, any other woman
would've run for the hills.

247
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:01,603
Carol, man, she's a saint.

248
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:02,893
She stuck with me.

249
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:04,949
But I really had to come
clean about everything.

250
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,301
I-I mean everything.

251
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:08,051
You know...almost.

252
00:17:08,722 --> 00:17:10,363
So, the decision to...

253
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:11,870
Well, that's the thing.

254
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:13,449
We both needed the change.

255
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:15,808
Hit the reset button.
Start all over.

256
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:17,559
Well, and plus, it
must feel good to know

257
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:18,850
you're really making
a difference.

258
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,029
You mean all that crap
about saving the planet?

259
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:22,083
Yeah.

260
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,689
Downsizing is about
saving yourself.

261
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:26,673
I-It takes the pressure right off.

262
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:27,900
Especially money pressure.

263
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:31,697
I'm just not driven and ambitious
like the rest of my family.

264
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:33,751
And now, Carol and I,
we live like kings.

265
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:36,909
I'm still living in the
same house I grew up in.

266
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,482
I mean, Audrey's
dying for us to move

267
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:41,100
but we're really strapped.

268
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,388
I mean, shit, I just finished
paying off my student loans.

269
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,438
Yeah, well...

270
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:49,509
Listen, if you ever start
thinkin' about it seriously,

271
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:51,689
here's my two cents, uh...

272
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:54,512
There's a lot of small communities
croppin' up out there, but

273
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,520
don't mess around.

274
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:57,161
Leisureland's where
you wanna be.

275
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:00,335
Best houses, best appliances,
best doctors.

276
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:02,109
They book all the
big concert tours.

277
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:03,374
They got all the
great restaurants.

278
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:05,539
The kids love
Cheesecake Factory.

279
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:07,117
And Leisureland's
got three of 'em.

280
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:10,109
And hey, I'm not just saying
all this for the referral credit.

281
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:10,937
Just so you know.

282
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:16,499
I liked little Carol.
She's got a lot on the ball.

283
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:18,443
She's reading books she
always wanted to read.

284
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:19,990
She's taking Italian.

285
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:21,435
And she's never been fitter.

286
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:23,139
Well, they sure seem happy.

287
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,709
Dave says he's getting
pretty good on the drums.

288
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:28,739
Next year, they're taking
the kids out of school

289
00:18:28,764 --> 00:18:31,435
to spend six months at a
sister city in Tuscany.

290
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,794
Cooking classes, yoga,
wine-tasting,

291
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:36,177
the whole nine yards.

292
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:42,472
<i>Hey, Saf, Audrey, it's Milo.</i>

293
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:43,832
<i>Bad news.</i>

294
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:46,840
<i>Your mortgage application at
First National bounced back.</i>

295
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:49,464
<i>The underwriter didn't like
the income to debt ratios--</i>

296
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:50,848
<i>they're a little excessive.</i>

297
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:53,207
<i>I-I don't know if you
can come up with</i>

298
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,957
<i>another ten-fifteen
percent down.</i>

299
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:57,247
<i>If you could, maybe
goose it up a little bit...</i>

300
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:00,517
And then we'll be able to tell
right away if it's for us or not.

301
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,755
Yeah, so let's not
waste a lot of time.

302
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,598
Maybe if we get to Santa Fe early,
we can get a massage.

303
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:07,060

I'm Jeff Lonowsky,
Senior Product Specialist

313
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:14,685
and happy homeowner here
at Leisureland Estates.

314
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,068
You havin' a good time?

315
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,991
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

316
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:21,844
Come on, guys, you're a heck
of a lot bigger than I am.

317
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:24,501
Make some noise!
Are you havin' a good time?

318
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,346
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

319
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,861
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

320
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,682
That's more like it.

321
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:32,907
So, what do you
think of my place?

322
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,758
Pretty nifty, huh?

323
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,038
It's the house of my dreams.

324
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,538
Heck, I'd say this is the
house of anybody's dreams.

325
00:20:40,595 --> 00:20:43,228
Why, an average guy like me
would have to work twenty,

326
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:46,482
thirty, maybe forty years
to afford a place like this,

327
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:47,459
if ever.

328
00:20:47,986 --> 00:20:50,447
And just wait till
you see what's inside.

329
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,216
Oh.

330
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:01,982
Jeff?

331
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,135
You've gotta stop inviting
guests over without telling me.

332
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,261
Oh, sorry, Laura.
I was only--

333
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:12,339
I mean, I finally just got in the
tub to relax after such a busy day.

334
00:21:12,364 --> 00:21:13,770
Busy doing what, sweetheart?

335
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,301
Oh, no end of things.

336
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:17,831
First I took a tennis lesson
and had a massage.

337
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:18,574
Nice.

338
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,879
And then after a gourmet
lunch with the girls,

339
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,467
well, we couldn't help ourselves

340
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:25,443
so we popped into that new
Loget's jewelry store downtown.

341
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:28,640
Uh-oh, Loget's. What's
than gonna cost me?

342
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:33,017
Now, Jeff, you hush.
I was really good.

343
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:36,001
Just another diamond bracelet.

344
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,775
Just a diamond bracelet?
That doesn't sound like you.

345
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:43,748
You're right, I don't
like to break up a set.

346
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:47,429
So, I got matching
diamond earrings

347
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:49,702
and a matching diamond necklace.

348
00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:52,954
All conflict-free,
and set in platinum.

349
00:21:53,118 --> 00:21:54,345
How much, Laura?

350
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,919
Oh, but Jeff, they look so good
on me, and you should see--

351
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:58,341
How much, Laura?

352
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:00,982
-Well, Jeff...
-I said how much?

353
00:22:01,825 --> 00:22:03,223
Eighty-three dollars.

354
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:05,902
Eighty-three dollars?
Are you crazy?

355
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,942
Why, that's practically our food
budget for two whole months!

356
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:10,067
Ah!

357
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:50,542
Putting it all together, if you
liquidate your current home,

358
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:52,431
cars and other assets,

359
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,385
and purchase a
Regency-level estate--

360
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:57,580
remember that's a 12,000
square foot equivalent home

361
00:22:57,605 --> 00:23:02,425
on a 1.5 acre equivalent lot--
at a base price of $63,000.

362
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:04,378
Then the Health and
Fitness package--

363
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:06,605
that's $4,500, you're
gonna wanna get that.

364
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:10,863
It's gym, pool, sauna, steam,
hot tub, and a tennis court.

365
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:12,605
Then the medical
procedures for two adults.

366
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,183
That's $15,000.

367
00:23:14,472 --> 00:23:16,612
But does insurance
cover any of that?

368
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,891
No, but at the Regency level you
qualify of a substantial discount.

369
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:22,884
And don't forget the
federal tax credit.

370
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:23,852
-Right, right.
-Right?

371
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:26,508
So, taking a look at
your current debt,

372
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:29,150
you retirement and
your other savings,

373
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:33,297
you are at $152,000 in equity.

374
00:23:33,383 --> 00:23:35,633
People, that is a very
comfortable number.

375
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:38,288
Comfortable? That doesn't
sound like nearly enough.

376
00:23:38,313 --> 00:23:39,389
-Yeah.
-Well, no.

377
00:23:39,414 --> 00:23:41,295
See, you have to look
at this column, Audrey.

378
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,507
Equivalent value.

379
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,011
You're solidly inside
the Blue Chip zone.

380
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:51,308
In Leisureland your $152,000
translates to $12.5 million--

381
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,364
to live on, for life.

382
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:54,880
I mean, come on!

383
00:23:54,905 --> 00:23:56,411
-Oh.
-Well.

384
00:23:58,092 --> 00:23:59,842
Hold on, if this is
such a good thing,

385
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:01,445
how come
you haven't done it?

386
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:03,022
I would do it in a heartbeat

387
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:04,770
but my husband had
a hip replacement

388
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:06,200
so he's ineligible.

389
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,482
So, what do you think?

390
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:10,709
Would the Regency level
be your first choice?

391
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:14,139
Or should should I show you
something a little more deluxe?

392
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:19,728
Honey, why don't you
just go ahead and pick.

393
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:21,150
I just want you to be happy.

394
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:24,478
That's a good husband.

395
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:26,125
Take a look at this.

396
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,696
Hey, how much for
the hotdog cooker?

397
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:32,968
Four dollars.

398
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:34,905
I'll give you a dollar.

399
00:24:35,202 --> 00:24:36,069
Sold.

400
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:39,594
Keep up with the exercises.
Don't get lazy. Look.

401
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:41,450
I laminated it for you,

402
00:24:41,475 --> 00:24:43,561
so you literally have
no excuse not to do it.

403
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:44,975
Okay, thanks, Paul.
Thanks a lot.

404
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,727
You bet.

405
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,297
Maybe someday me and
my wife will get small

406
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,438
and we'll come down
and see ya.

407
00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:50,575
Well, I'd love that.
But in the meantime...

408
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,880
-Okay?
-All right.

409
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,849
-Just 15 minutes every night.
-Okay.

410
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:55,262
-It'll change your life.
-Thanks, Paul.

411
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,247
See ya, Dave.

412
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:58,411
We're here to wish Paul Safranek

413
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:00,778
farewell as he moves
on to Leisureland.

414
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:02,700
And we wish him
nothing but the best.

415
00:25:02,763 --> 00:25:04,411
Good luck to you and Audrey.

416
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:06,160
Thanks, Bob.

417
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:07,918
Thanks, Bob.

418
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:16,510
And you guys didn't
consider Treasure Island

419
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:17,512
out in Palm Desert?

420
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,174
Well, we checked it out, but

421
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,909
I mean, I liked it all right.

422
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:23,105
But Audrey thought they were
a little stingy with the amenities.

423
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:24,238
I mean, especially given
what they're charging

424
00:25:24,263 --> 00:25:25,676
in monthly maintenance.

425
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:29,254
And I just turned to Paul
and said, "Okay, you win."

426
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:30,504
Let's go for it.

427
00:25:30,622 --> 00:25:32,629
We're just gonna
miss you so much.

428
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,822
Oh, Gina, I'm gonna
miss you too.

429
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,392
Well, look, it's not
like we're dying, okay?

430
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:39,728
We're just relocating.

431
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:42,559
And we'll be back at least
once a year. Maybe more.

432
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:50,879
-Hi, Dad.
-Sweetheart.

433
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:55,422
Yeah, well, sorry your mom
couldn't bring herself to come.

434
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:57,141
But she sends her love

435
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:59,922
and we're expecting you at
the house tomorrow afternoon.

436
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:03,352
-Glad you could make it, Larry.
-Hey, Paul.

437
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:05,039
What can I get you, Dad?

438
00:26:05,136 --> 00:26:06,269
Um...

439
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,745
Look, why don't I--
here, you guys visit. Um...?

440
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,179
-Beer.
-Yeah.

441
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:13,062
-Just any beer.
-That's great, okay, comin' up.

442
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,717
I wish Mom weren't
taking it so hard.

443
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:18,944
Well, you know your mother.

444
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:22,264
Frankly, I was a little skeptical
about it myself at first.

445
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,140
Say, you remember Jerry Gross?

446
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:27,499
Well, I called him
the other day.

447
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,476
He and Bev retired down there.

448
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:32,226
Did the whole shrinking thing
that you kids are doing.

449
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:35,305
He says they're getting along
just fine, never better.

450
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:37,149
He says he feels
younger every day

451
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:40,141
and that a dollar buys a
thousand dollars worth of stuff.

452
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:43,434
Of course they need that with
all the medication Bev takes.

453
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,583
But, uh... yeah.

454
00:26:45,893 --> 00:26:48,362
You know, I... I see the appeal.

455
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:51,441
Apparently there's zero crime,
I keep telling your mother.

456
00:26:52,428 --> 00:26:53,397
It's very safe.

457
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,108
Yeah, we worry.

458
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:02,306
When I was younger and,
and uh, and then I-I lost the...

459
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:03,299
Hey...

460
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,292
You guys are the ones
getting small, right?

461
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:10,308
Uh, that's right, my wife and I.

462
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,269
Good for you.

463
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,335
No offense, but um...

464
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:19,999
do you think
if you're that small

465
00:27:20,077 --> 00:27:22,022
you should still have all the
same rights as the rest of us

466
00:27:22,047 --> 00:27:23,585
normal-sized people?

467
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,350
I mean, like the right to vote?

468
00:27:27,717 --> 00:27:28,717
Why wouldn't we?

469
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,882
Oh, well, jeez, let's see, um...

470
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,623
You don't buy
as many products,

471
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,132
you're not paying
as much sales tax,

472
00:27:34,157 --> 00:27:36,420
some of you aren't even
paying any income tax.

473
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:37,664
I mean, you're not really

474
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,241
participating in our
economy, are you?

475
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:40,816
-Hey.
-I mean, in fact you're costin' us

476
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:42,550
-Hey. Hey!
-money and jobs.

477
00:27:42,648 --> 00:27:43,589
That's enough.

478
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:45,672
We're just having
a good time here.

479
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:49,361
Hey, I'm just askin' a simple
academic question, all right?

480
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:50,487
-You know what, I think you guys
-Hey, Tim, Tim...

481
00:27:50,512 --> 00:27:51,737
should have a quarter
of a vote at most.

482
00:27:51,762 --> 00:27:53,135
-I mean, that's pretty generous.
-Tim.

483
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:54,143
Take a seat, Tim.

484
00:27:54,168 --> 00:27:55,518
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Why don't you take a walk.

485
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:56,924
Cool your jets, big guy!

486
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:59,097
You know what, maybe an
eighth of a vote, if that.

487
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:01,108
And you could use a
little small, buddy.

488
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,321
Yeah, sit down.

489
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:04,886
Hey!

490
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,113
Hey!

491
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:09,699
Can I get a normal-sized beer
for a normal-sized guy?

492
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:18,616
I keep thinking
I forgot something.

493
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,278
Moving to town, are you?

494
00:29:58,614 --> 00:29:59,560
How's that?

495
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:02,599
I see you're moving
to Leisureland.

496
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:05,068
You look like a
nice young couple.

497
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:07,169
Thanks.

498
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,450
Where you from?

499
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:09,473
Uh, Omaha.

500
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,239
Spokane.

501
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:12,793
Nervous?

502
00:30:13,903 --> 00:30:16,614
Yeah, you know, uh,
a little.

503
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,911
Don't be.

504
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,591
It's the best thing
you'll ever do.

505
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:27,863
With your permission,

506
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:31,104
I'm going to record your answers
to the following questions.

507
00:30:31,784 --> 00:30:33,042
May I begin the recording?

508
00:30:33,597 --> 00:30:34,722
-Sure.
-Yeah.

509
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:40,089
Please state your
full legal names.

510
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,808
Audrey Lustig Safranek.

511
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:45,862
Paul Norris Safranek.

512
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:49,707
And do you,
Audrey Lustig Safranek,

513
00:30:49,886 --> 00:30:52,878
and you,
Paul Norris Safranek,

514
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:55,245
understand that,
of your own free will,

515
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,667
you will undergo the
permanent and irreversible

516
00:30:57,692 --> 00:30:59,589
medical procedure
commonly knows as

517
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:00,980
"downsizing?"

518
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:02,885
And that following
the procedure,

519
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:04,682
your bodies will
be approximately

520
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:08,431
.0364% of their current
mass and volume?

521
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:09,611
Yeah.

522
00:31:09,932 --> 00:31:11,971
I'm-I'm sorry Paul,
I need a yes or no.

523
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,393
Yes.

524
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:14,572
Yes.

525
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:16,283
Great, thank you.

526
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:20,706
And do you give full consent
to Gateway Medical Services

527
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:21,886
to administer

528
00:31:21,911 --> 00:31:24,857
the medical procedure commonly
known as “downsizing?”

529
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,527
Yes.

530
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:26,620
Yes.

531
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,760
And do you understand
that there exists

532
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:33,182
an approximately one
in 225,000 chance

533
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:35,040
that the procedure could result

534
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:39,150
in injury, permanent
disability or death?

535
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,029
-Yes.
-Yes.

536
00:31:48,857 --> 00:31:49,685
Yes.

537
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,500
Safranek? Paul Safranek?

538
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:07,914
Yes.

539
00:32:16,505 --> 00:32:18,005
It's actually Sa<i>fra</i>nek.

540
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,934
Sa<i>fra</i>nek.
Come with me, sir.

541
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:21,091
We're together.

542
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:21,950
Oh.

543
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:24,821
Someone will escort you to the
women's facility shortly.

544
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,603
You will be separated of
approximately five hours.

545
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:30,892
Following the procedure, you'll
be reunited in the recovery room.

546
00:32:31,831 --> 00:32:32,627
Okay.

547
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:36,472
-So this is it, then.
-Yeah.

548
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:40,214
-I'll see you tonight.
-Yeah.

549
00:32:40,948 --> 00:32:42,261
I'll see you on the other side.

550
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:47,401
I love you.

551
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:49,097
And I love you, too.

552
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,492
Okay, let's get you up here.

553
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:21,881
All clear!

554
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:20,916
Oi, we got some real
fat one this time.

555
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:22,640
Hey, how's everybody
doin' today?

556
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,609
Hey, Miss Joyce, doin' good.
How you doin'?

557
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:27,453
Me, I'm great. Just getting
ready for the weekend.

558
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:18,545
I see you've decided to join us.

559
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,107
Is this...?

560
00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:21,912
Is it over?

561
00:39:22,298 --> 00:39:23,783
Welcome to Leisureland.

562
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:25,134
Can you tell me your name?

563
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:27,846
-It's Paul Safranek.
-Okay, good.

564
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,558
I bet you're hungry.

565
00:39:37,484 --> 00:39:38,570
Oh, my God.

566
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:40,726
Isn't that cute?

567
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:42,383
People just love that.

568
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,091
I'll bring you a little
snack in a moment.

569
00:39:44,122 --> 00:39:45,128
Thanks. Um,

570
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:47,567
I think my wife was supposed
to be here with me.

571
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:48,497
What's her name?

572
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,529
Audrey Safranek

573
00:39:49,771 --> 00:39:51,099
Let me see.

574
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:53,521
We do have an Audrey Safranek
scheduled for today

575
00:39:53,546 --> 00:39:55,851
but I don't show her
transferred over yet.

576
00:39:55,899 --> 00:39:58,477
She's probably just held up
in dental. I'll go check.

577
00:39:58,727 --> 00:39:59,828
Thank you.

578
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:07,521
Mr. Safranek,
you've got a call.

579
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:09,755
Oh, thank you.

580
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,013
Hello?

581
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:12,318
<i>Paul?</i>

582
00:40:12,404 --> 00:40:16,083
Oh, Audrey, thank God.
Where are you, honey?

583
00:40:16,357 --> 00:40:18,802
<i>Don't be mad at me.
Please don't be mad.</i>

584
00:40:19,177 --> 00:40:20,708
<i>It's hard enough as it is.</i>

585
00:40:21,193 --> 00:40:23,232
What's hard?
Wait, what are you talkin' about?

586
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:25,158
<i>Oh, Paul!</i>

587
00:40:25,415 --> 00:40:27,056
<i>They shaved my head.</i>

588
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:31,251
<i>And then they started shaving
my eyebrows and I just thought,</i>

589
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:33,368
<i>"What am I doing?"</i>

590
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:36,538
<i>I can't leave my family.
I can't leave my friends.</i>

591
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,819
<i>-And I'm sorry, Paul, I just can't.</i>
-Where are you?

592
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,424
Are you at the airport?

593
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:45,127
Don't hate me.

594
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:47,541
Please don't hate me.

595
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:50,127
<i>Okay, okay. Take it easy. Just</i>

596
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,287
get in a taxi and come back

597
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:53,881
and we'll talk about this, okay?

598
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:57,202
We'll go back to Omaha and we'll
think this through together.

599
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,391
Wait.

600
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,094
You're not leaving me here.

601
00:41:05,148 --> 00:41:06,883
Can't you understand how I feel?

602
00:41:06,955 --> 00:41:08,260
I feel terrible.

603
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,627
I let you down, I feel awful.

604
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,294
But then-

605
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:13,660
then I realized
I was just doing this

606
00:41:13,685 --> 00:41:15,786
because I w-I was trying
to make you happy and

607
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:18,520
I should've been thinking
more about myself.

608
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:20,680
Thinking about yourself?

609
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:22,466
Thinking about yourself?!

610
00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:24,880
You know, you haven't
even asked me how I am!

611
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:25,958
<i>Don't yell.</i>

612
00:41:26,058 --> 00:41:27,644
<i>Don't yell at me
or I'll hang up.</i>

613
00:41:27,691 --> 00:41:32,011
Do you have any idea what
I have been through today?

614
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,165
Audrey, if you don't come
back here right now...

615
00:41:36,065 --> 00:41:37,847
And see you all small?

616
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:40,558
I'm upset enough already.

617
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:42,089
You're upset?

618
00:41:42,862 --> 00:41:44,073
You're upset?

619
00:41:44,174 --> 00:41:46,963
I'm the one who's
five fucking inches tall!

620
00:41:48,283 --> 00:41:49,533
Well, we're sure sorry to hear

621
00:41:49,558 --> 00:41:51,307
Mrs. Safranek couldn't
make it today.

622
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:53,114
Sa<i>fra</i>nek.

623
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:54,435
Sa<i>fra</i>nek.

624
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,927
Well, it's not a half-bad
idea to scout things out

625
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:58,685
get everything ready for her.

626
00:42:05,554 --> 00:42:07,202
The net blocks a lot of UV rays,

627
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:09,101
but you still might
wanna put your hat on.

628
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,649
And anytime you
wanna to somewhere,

629
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,711
you just hop in
one of these bad boys.

630
00:42:13,788 --> 00:42:15,889
And if they're in
short supply, well,

631
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:16,952
you can always share.

632
00:42:17,085 --> 00:42:19,842
It's fun to share. I know, I've
met some super people that way.

633
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:21,022
Just super.

634
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,447
Yeah, isn't that somethin'?

635
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,339
Over to your right there,

636
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:50,660
that big, white oval building is
one of our seven Sports Centers.

637
00:42:50,714 --> 00:42:51,690
That's the one that houses

638
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:54,003
the largest indoor skiing
facility in the world--

639
00:42:54,028 --> 00:42:56,136
you know, relatively speaking.

640
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:58,116
And over there is Lake Chester...

641
00:43:31,271 --> 00:43:32,373
Look familiar?

642
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:33,794
The Barrington.

643
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:35,873
My sister's got one.
She loves it.

644
00:43:36,168 --> 00:43:38,848
Well, sir, here is the uh,
key to your kingdom.

645
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:41,451
Welcome to the good life.

646
00:43:44,232 --> 00:43:47,170
Oh, they uh, stocked the
kitchen with standard items...

647
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:49,398
but one thing I should warn
you about is the dairy--

648
00:43:49,423 --> 00:43:50,452
it takes a while
for your stomach

649
00:43:50,477 --> 00:43:51,709
to adjust to the milk
and the cheese,

650
00:43:51,734 --> 00:43:54,204
so go easy on it. Somethin'
about the bacteria.

651
00:43:54,274 --> 00:43:55,993
And be careful about
the hot water.

652
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,081
It's on one central system and
they got that cranked really high.

653
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:00,808
Surprised they haven't
had a lawsuit yet.

654
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:02,620
Oh, but you didn't
hear that from me.

655
00:44:03,366 --> 00:44:04,475
Thanks Matt.

656
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:06,559
You're a nice guy.

657
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:11,203
And Paul?

658
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:13,993
Thanks for helping the planet.

659
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:28,797
Aaah!

660
00:45:29,156 --> 00:45:30,149
Fuck!

661
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:46,043
Safranek?

662
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:50,434
That's me.

663
00:45:52,673 --> 00:45:53,548
Okay!

664
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,799
<i>And now from the United States,</i>

665
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:14,430
<i>where for many years, both the
Department of Homeland Security</i>

666
00:46:14,478 --> 00:46:17,032
<i>and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service</i>

667
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:19,556
<i>have been warning about
the ease with which</i>

668
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:20,899
<i>downsized people--</i>

669
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,610
<i>from illegal immigrants
to potential terrorists--</i>

670
00:46:23,673 --> 00:46:25,759
<i>could penetrate U.S. borders.</i>

671
00:46:25,798 --> 00:46:28,282
<i>Last week's discovery
in Eugene, Oregon</i>

672
00:46:28,307 --> 00:46:31,126
<i>provided new evidence
to support that claim.</i>

673
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:33,330
<i>Brian Fakler brings us up to date.</i>

674
00:46:34,337 --> 00:46:35,991
{\an8}<i>This Target is just one of</i>

675
00:46:36,016 --> 00:46:38,150
{\an8}<i>thousands of big-box
stores around the country</i>

676
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:40,628
{\an8}<i>that import almost a million
tons of goods weekly,</i>

677
00:46:40,653 --> 00:46:41,987
{\an8}<i>most of it from Asia.</i>

678
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:45,213
{\an8}<i>Last week, workers here in Eugene
opened a suspicious TV box</i>

679
00:46:45,238 --> 00:46:48,801
{\an8}<i>and discovered 17 downsized
stowaways from Vietnam,</i>

680
00:46:48,887 --> 00:46:50,621
{\an8}<i>14 of them already dead,</i>

681
00:46:50,646 --> 00:46:53,832
{\an8}<i>two more dying hours later
at a local hospital.</i>

682
00:46:54,137 --> 00:46:57,770
{\an8}<i>On Friday, the lone survivor,
a woman named Ngoc Lan Tran,</i>

683
00:46:57,795 --> 00:47:01,137
{\an8}<i>was transferred to a hospital at
Leisureland Estates in New Mexico,</i>

684
00:47:01,162 --> 00:47:04,457
{\an8}<i>widely considered the country's
top medical center for the small.</i>

685
00:47:04,535 --> 00:47:07,652
<i>Doctors were forced to amputate
a portion of an infected leg,</i>

686
00:47:07,677 --> 00:47:10,783
<i>and today her condition
is described as fair but stable.</i>

687
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,785
<i>According to a statement from the
Department of Homeland Security,</i>

688
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:15,439
<i>Ms. Tran claims to
have been jailed</i>

689
00:47:15,464 --> 00:47:17,885
<i>for her political and
environmental activism,</i>

690
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:19,728
<i>and was miniaturized
against her will</i>

691
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,533
<i>in a Vietnamese prison facility.</i>

692
00:47:21,613 --> 00:47:24,565
<i>If true, this would bolster
claims by human rights groups</i>

693
00:47:24,613 --> 00:47:26,917
<i>that repressive governments
around the world...</i>

694
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:40,968
So, do we need to review any of
the terms of the settlement?

695
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:42,099
No.

696
00:47:42,354 --> 00:47:44,311
It's all pretty clear.

697
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:47,027
I really wish you'd
taken her first offer.

698
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:48,628
I know.

699
00:47:48,747 --> 00:47:49,731
All right, well.

700
00:47:49,973 --> 00:47:52,598
Just step back a little.
Don't want you to get hurt.

701
00:48:10,381 --> 00:48:11,295
Um.

702
00:48:11,842 --> 00:48:13,427
As large as you can, please.

703
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:20,878
Nice weather down here.

704
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:24,191
Turned real cold back in Omaha.

705
00:48:24,879 --> 00:48:25,722
Uh-huh.

706
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:27,574
Wind chill.

707
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:14,734
Hey, Paul.

708
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:16,452
Thanks, man, you were right.

709
00:49:16,477 --> 00:49:18,329
Raising my monitor
really did the trick.

710
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:20,815
My neck feels better, there's
no more tingling in my arm.

711
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:22,511
I would've never
made the connection.

712
00:49:22,536 --> 00:49:24,574
That's great, I'm really
glad I could help.

713
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:29,695
Thank you for
calling Land's End.

714
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:31,952
My name is Paul,
how can I help you today?

715
00:49:55,252 --> 00:49:56,651
Ciao, bello.

716
00:49:57,596 --> 00:49:58,862
Hi, Carol.

717
00:50:12,682 --> 00:50:13,721
Hey, pal.

718
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,056
Why the long face? Huh?

719
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:18,487
Look around you, buddy.
Life is good.

720
00:50:19,643 --> 00:50:21,502
I made a mistake, Dave.

721
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:24,869
Biggest mistake of my life.
Should've stayed where I was.

722
00:50:24,894 --> 00:50:26,510
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

723
00:50:26,612 --> 00:50:29,588
Look, I know divorce can put a
dent in anyone's self-esteem.

724
00:50:29,822 --> 00:50:32,260
And what Audrey did to you
was beyond the pale.

725
00:50:32,502 --> 00:50:33,447
I mean, I hate her.

726
00:50:33,643 --> 00:50:35,096
I-I barely know her.

727
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:37,455
You may not hate her,
but I hate her guts.

728
00:50:38,127 --> 00:50:40,166
You, you just gotta get back
in the saddle, that's all.

729
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,361
Ah, maybe someday.

730
00:50:42,926 --> 00:50:44,301
If you want my advice,

731
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:46,356
single moms is the way to go.

732
00:50:47,115 --> 00:50:49,114
Yeah, they got the whole kid
thing out of their system,

733
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:50,295
and they just wanna party

734
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:51,365
No, that's okay, I'm--

735
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,006
And if you don't want an
emotional connection, which

736
00:50:53,172 --> 00:50:54,953
understandable, you just uh

737
00:50:55,022 --> 00:50:57,787
well, we have all sorts of ways you
can have a good time down here.

738
00:50:57,819 --> 00:50:59,100
No strings attached.

739
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,476
-Just put it on the old credit card.
-No, I'm good.

740
00:51:01,624 --> 00:51:03,187
-Really.
-Okay, yeah.

741
00:51:03,366 --> 00:51:05,459
In fact, I started
seeing someone.

742
00:51:05,764 --> 00:51:06,733
Oh, yeah?

743
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:09,037
Single mom, actually.

744
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:12,360
Mm-hmm, now we're talkin'.
Good for you.

745
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:21,927
Paul, this is so good.

746
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:23,294
Thanks.

747
00:51:25,612 --> 00:51:27,612
The recipe called
for chervil, but

748
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:29,417
you can't get chervil here yet.

749
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,542
-So, I used dill.
-Hm.

750
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:34,797
Well, whatever it is,
it's super-yummy.

751
00:51:36,809 --> 00:51:38,403
It's the little things, you know?

752
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:42,207
I mean, except for there being
no birds or insects,

753
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:43,590
you'd think you're
in the normal world

754
00:51:43,615 --> 00:51:44,981
and then somethin' happens

755
00:51:45,138 --> 00:51:46,646
and you realize we're not.

756
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:48,707
I mean, not that substituting
dill for chervil

757
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:50,864
is that big a thing, but
you know what I mean.

758
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:52,399
Like last month,

759
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,624
my parents came down
to visit Jonah and me--

760
00:51:54,649 --> 00:51:55,524
Mm-hmm.

761
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,321
and it's like this whole production

762
00:51:57,352 --> 00:52:00,266
with the carrying boxes, and of
course Jonah gets freaked out

763
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:02,445
by Grandma and Grandpa
being so huge and scary.

764
00:52:02,516 --> 00:52:03,352
Mm.

765
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:05,814
One night they took us out
for dinner at Fleming's,

766
00:52:05,913 --> 00:52:07,413
-you know, real nice,
-Mm-hmm.

767
00:52:07,647 --> 00:52:10,788
and Jonah and are
sitting on the table

768
00:52:10,813 --> 00:52:12,283
in those special seats.

769
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,979
And the big people wouldn't
stop staring at us.

770
00:52:15,537 --> 00:52:18,373
Plus, the restaurant brags about
how small people are welcome,

771
00:52:18,412 --> 00:52:20,279
and then they charge
a huge minimum.

772
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:21,750
They should charge
big people extra.

773
00:52:21,783 --> 00:52:23,436
They're the ones
dragging down the world.

774
00:52:23,524 --> 00:52:24,352
I know.

775
00:52:24,454 --> 00:52:26,102
Big people look at us
like we're freaks.

776
00:52:26,141 --> 00:52:27,571
They're the freaks.

777
00:52:28,008 --> 00:52:31,031
Oh, did you hear about all that
gas being released in Antarctica?

778
00:52:31,056 --> 00:52:33,094
From the ice? The methane?

779
00:52:33,204 --> 00:52:35,759
Oh, I haven't really been following
the news that much lately.

780
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:37,446
Apparently it's a big deal.

781
00:52:37,633 --> 00:52:39,781
Scientists are saying
the more the ice melts,

782
00:52:39,806 --> 00:52:42,633
the more methane comes out
making more ice melt.

783
00:52:42,961 --> 00:52:45,477
Apparently we're already
way beyond the tipping--

784
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,560
It's my upstairs neighbor.

785
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:53,778
Well, it's the strangest thing,
I-there wasn't a peep for months

786
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,052
I don't even think he was here--

787
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:57,285
and then suddenly, it's

788
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,770
party, party, party.

789
00:52:58,795 --> 00:53:00,441
I had to call security
the other night.

790
00:53:08,803 --> 00:53:09,717
Dusan!

791
00:53:11,207 --> 00:53:12,535
Hey, Dusan!

792
00:53:13,512 --> 00:53:14,441
Dusan!

793
00:53:15,184 --> 00:53:16,074
Yes?

794
00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:17,648
You mind turning
 down the music?

795
00:53:17,673 --> 00:53:20,390
I'm trying to have a
quiet evening down here.

796
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:24,984
Hello, my friend.

797
00:53:25,281 --> 00:53:26,648
Hello, Dusan.

798
00:53:27,085 --> 00:53:28,273
May I come in?

799
00:53:29,492 --> 00:53:30,320
Certainly.

800
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:36,682
So, listen, Pete,

801
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:37,940
Paul.

802
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:40,032
-Paul.
-Paul.

803
00:53:40,057 --> 00:53:41,057
And Kristen.

804
00:53:41,082 --> 00:53:43,604
-Ah, hello, Kristen.
-Hi.

805
00:53:43,747 --> 00:53:47,177
I'm sorry I'm disturbing
your nice little dinner.

806
00:53:48,263 --> 00:53:49,279
Listen...

807
00:53:49,498 --> 00:53:51,607
as I was saying, Paul,

808
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:54,028
I'm having one more, you know,

809
00:53:54,075 --> 00:53:55,841
little party at
my place tonight.

810
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:58,018
Not big like last time.
Very small.

811
00:53:58,096 --> 00:54:00,088
Just a few close friends.

812
00:54:01,061 --> 00:54:02,014
No!

813
00:54:02,428 --> 00:54:04,303
Is that a rose?

814
00:54:04,592 --> 00:54:06,569
-Yeah.
-A real rose?

815
00:54:08,004 --> 00:54:09,886
Where'd you get a real rose?

816
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,832
It's a new store, uh,
Full-Sized Flower Mart.

817
00:54:14,824 --> 00:54:16,449
How much they're
charging for this?

818
00:54:17,051 --> 00:54:17,996
Dusan!

819
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:19,754
Dusan!

820
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:24,657
Quoi, ma Cherie?

821
00:54:24,759 --> 00:54:26,275
<i>What are you doing down there?</i>

822
00:54:26,322 --> 00:54:29,087


823
00:54:30,891 --> 00:54:32,375
Oui, ma Cherie. J'arrive.

824
00:54:34,507 --> 00:54:35,374
Anyway,

825
00:54:36,413 --> 00:54:37,491
as I was saying,

826
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:40,257
Paul, if tonight
noise disturbs you,

827
00:54:40,282 --> 00:54:41,628
just come upstairs talk to me.

828
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,495
Don't make big show
like last time,

829
00:54:43,574 --> 00:54:45,082
yelling like crazy man.

830
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:47,990
We're neighbors.
Neighbors are friends.

831
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:50,475
What's better even,
come to the party.

832
00:54:50,628 --> 00:54:53,261
Thanks, but like I said, we

833
00:54:53,339 --> 00:54:55,073
just want to have
a quiet dinner.

834
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,698
Just try to keep it down, okay?

835
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:00,492
Yes, darling, of course.

836
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:01,312
Shh, shh.

837
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:02,426
Shh.

838
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,567
Oh.

839
00:55:08,825 --> 00:55:10,864
Thanks for a really nice time.

840
00:55:11,528 --> 00:55:12,981
Plus the cooking and all.

841
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:15,655
Sorry I have to leave so early,
but you know, the sitter...

842
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,594
Yeah, yeah. No...

843
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:19,337
I was...

844
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:24,609
Up one floor.

845
00:55:24,641 --> 00:55:25,281
<i>What?</i>

846
00:55:25,306 --> 00:55:26,123
Yeah, one more.

847
00:55:26,148 --> 00:55:27,601
-Gracias
-Oh, gracias, tio.

848
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,761
Anyway, uh,

849
00:55:34,816 --> 00:55:37,886
I was hoping uh, Sunday
we could bring Jonah.

850
00:55:38,512 --> 00:55:40,340
I... I'd love to meet him.

851
00:55:40,442 --> 00:55:42,231
Yeah...maybe.

852
00:55:58,123 --> 00:55:59,889
-Something wrong?
-No.

853
00:56:01,717 --> 00:56:03,725
You're a wonderful guy, Paul.

854
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,264
And I really enjoy
hanging out with you.

855
00:56:07,623 --> 00:56:08,592
Uh-huh.

856
00:56:08,685 --> 00:56:10,857
But, if I'm honest
about how I'm feeling,

857
00:56:10,912 --> 00:56:14,091
I just-it might be uh--
it might be too soon for me.

858
00:56:14,116 --> 00:56:15,272
It's fine, I get it.

859
00:56:15,304 --> 00:56:16,716
-No, no...
-I get it. No, it's fine.

860
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,467
I just mean if we're
bringing Jonah into it...

861
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:21,175
Have a nice night.

862
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:22,496
No, I...

863
00:56:23,058 --> 00:56:24,113
Paul!

864
00:56:48,647 --> 00:56:49,811
A rose!

865
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:10,761
Paul!

866
00:57:12,656 --> 00:57:13,789
You come.

867
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:16,387
And you bring the rose.

868
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:18,800
-It's a peace offering.
-Oh.

869
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,533
Look, everyone.

870
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,377
This is Paul, my neighbor.

871
00:57:22,402 --> 00:57:23,815
And look at what he brings me.

872
00:57:23,924 --> 00:57:25,674
A real fucking rose!

873
00:57:27,056 --> 00:57:29,806
You think any of these other
ungrateful sons of bitches

874
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:31,673
think to bring
something to Dusan?

875
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,321
No. You're the only one.

876
00:57:33,392 --> 00:57:34,446
I like you.

877
00:57:35,968 --> 00:57:39,054
But, I know I said
it's only little party,

878
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:41,351
but I make two, three phone
calls to very close friends,

879
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:42,492
look what happens.

880
00:57:42,517 --> 00:57:43,731
Everybody comes.

881
00:57:43,756 --> 00:57:47,708
There's nothing else to do in this
fucking city after 10 o'clock.

882
00:57:47,747 --> 00:57:50,450
Now, this I do not understand.

883
00:57:50,911 --> 00:57:54,020
It's not as if so many people
have work in the morning.

884
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,710
You know, this is worst trait
about small people--

885
00:57:56,904 --> 00:57:58,256
they're lazy.

886
00:57:58,335 --> 00:58:00,819
Not all, not all. But lazy.

887
00:58:00,889 --> 00:58:04,147
Like...this lazy son of a bitch.

888
00:58:04,683 --> 00:58:05,785
Konrad!

889
00:58:06,402 --> 00:58:08,363
What's that you're
saying about me?

890
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:10,035
What lies are you telling?

891
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,779
Just that in small world
no one wants to work.

892
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:14,029
What did you expect?

893
00:58:14,185 --> 00:58:16,911
It's the wonderful thing
about becoming small.

894
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:18,697
Because you're immediately rich.

895
00:58:18,931 --> 00:58:20,626
Unless you're very poor.

896
00:58:20,837 --> 00:58:22,924
Then you're just small.

897
00:58:23,854 --> 00:58:25,400
Konrad's a sea captain.

898
00:58:25,575 --> 00:58:26,442
Oh?

899
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:29,099
Never more than ten meters
away from his boat.

900
00:58:29,155 --> 00:58:29,944
Oh.

901
00:58:30,061 --> 00:58:31,896
I do like my boat.

902
00:58:33,405 --> 00:58:34,772
There she is.

903
00:58:35,029 --> 00:58:36,944
Sonja, my beauty.

904
00:58:37,238 --> 00:58:41,295
You see, I'm from
many generations.

905
00:58:41,373 --> 00:58:44,428
All the way back to my
grandfathers, my father--

906
00:58:44,453 --> 00:58:45,725
all sea captains.

907
00:58:46,897 --> 00:58:49,279
So, what brings you
to Leisureland?

908
00:58:49,357 --> 00:58:50,428
Dusan.

909
00:58:50,589 --> 00:58:53,128
He even convinced
me to become small,

910
00:58:53,245 --> 00:58:56,948
mostly for the women
and the parties.

911
00:58:57,134 --> 00:59:01,009
And, frankly, my wife
had all the money,

912
00:59:01,098 --> 00:59:04,021
and after she left,
things became a bit tricky.

913
00:59:04,121 --> 00:59:05,825
Oh, I can relate.

914
00:59:06,322 --> 00:59:09,822
It's quite wonderful
to be small, don't you think?

915
00:59:10,687 --> 00:59:13,275
I'd say it has its
pluses and minuses.

916
00:59:13,539 --> 00:59:15,750
Next week I'll be
in the Seychelles,

917
00:59:15,955 --> 00:59:18,070
and two weeks after that, I'll be

918
00:59:18,104 --> 00:59:21,237
sailing with friends for a
month on Lake Titicaca.

919
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:24,659
Can you believe I've never
been to Lake Titicaca?

920
00:59:24,883 --> 00:59:27,399
Well, how does the boat
get from place to place?

921
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:28,915
I mean, you can't sail it.

922
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,180
FedEx, my dear boy.

923
00:59:31,616 --> 00:59:34,225
Sonja travels faster than I do.

924
00:59:36,421 --> 00:59:38,460


925
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:56,448
How'd you get a tiny
harpsichord down here?

926
00:59:56,854 --> 00:59:58,683
Well, I didn't--I had
to have it raised.

927
00:59:58,784 --> 00:59:59,636
Well, how?

928
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:07,085
Excuse me, who is that?

929
01:00:07,421 --> 01:00:08,913
-Who's that?
-Yeah.

930
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,796
That's little Ronni.

931
01:00:11,235 --> 01:00:12,478
That's little Ronni?

932
01:00:12,728 --> 01:00:14,422
-The first small baby ever born.
-Yeah.

933
01:00:14,447 --> 01:00:15,657
-Back in Norway?
-Shit.

934
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:17,118
-That's little Ronni.
-Yeah.

935
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:18,970
You should go talk to him.

936
01:00:24,297 --> 01:00:25,618
Sorry, uh...

937
01:00:25,828 --> 01:00:27,274
Sorry, excuse me, um,

938
01:00:27,366 --> 01:00:29,600
is it-is it true you're little Ronni?

939
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,842
Well, maybe not
so little anymore.

940
01:00:31,913 --> 01:00:33,288
But yeah, it's me.

941
01:00:33,486 --> 01:00:34,501
Wow, that's...!

942
01:00:34,563 --> 01:00:36,368
Do you thi-hey-would it be
cool to get a selfie?

943
01:00:36,393 --> 01:00:37,727
-Yeah, man, get in here.
-Awesome.

944
01:00:37,783 --> 01:00:39,595
Thank you so much,
I really appreciate it.

945
01:00:39,962 --> 01:00:40,892
Thank you.

946
01:00:40,998 --> 01:00:42,248
-Get in here.
-Wow.

947
01:01:30,134 --> 01:01:31,454
Thank you, so are you.

948
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:45,175
What is that?

949
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,075
No, I need to know.
I-I have allergies.

950
01:01:58,792 --> 01:01:59,987
Wait! Wait.

951
01:02:03,332 --> 01:02:04,269

Having fun?

958
01:04:57,817 --> 01:05:01,372
Enough with the
fucking doorbell.

959
01:05:03,277 --> 01:05:06,504
Good morning, Mr. Dusan.
We come clean for you.

960
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,181
So you had fun last night, yeah?

961
01:05:30,939 --> 01:05:32,650
You didn't know were so lucky

962
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:35,072
to have exciting
neighbor such as me.

963
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:37,642
Well, I've never been
to a party like that.

964
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,558
I've nev-there were
so many Europeans.

965
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:41,765
Did you know little Ronni
was here? I mean...

966
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:45,003
-he is historic.
-And boring, you know.

967
01:05:45,027 --> 01:05:46,564
Good-looking dumb
Norwegian guy

968
01:05:46,598 --> 01:05:49,082
goes around the world
having sex with everyone--

969
01:05:49,107 --> 01:05:53,102
women, men, hermaphrodites,
dogs, goats, monkeys.

970
01:05:53,644 --> 01:05:56,261
He'll be the first small
baby to die of syphilis,

971
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:58,956
but... historic.

972
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:02,192
Well, apparently he still lives
in the original colony, you know,

973
01:06:02,217 --> 01:06:04,700
over in Norway. I've always
wanted to see that.

974
01:06:04,872 --> 01:06:06,075
It's all right.

975
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,368
You've been there?

976
01:06:08,712 --> 01:06:11,094
Yeah, I go once or twice a year.

977
01:06:11,321 --> 01:06:13,813
Konrad too. We make
business there.

978
01:06:13,938 --> 01:06:15,821
Very good business.

979
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,280
Must be somethin' to see. I--

980
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:19,437
You know, you can't even
get pictures of it online?

981
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,015
Yes, my friend.

982
01:06:21,696 --> 01:06:24,250
The world is filled
with things to see.

983
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,911
You know, I don't know you, Paul

984
01:06:26,974 --> 01:06:28,763
but I like you,
I like you very much.

985
01:06:28,865 --> 01:06:30,255
And my advice is

986
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:33,896
get out of this disgusting
little fucking apartment

987
01:06:33,929 --> 01:06:35,545
and open your eyes.

988
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:37,303
Don't be so American.

989
01:06:37,558 --> 01:06:39,120
You're nice guy, Paul,

990
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,324
but little bit pathetic guy.

991
01:06:41,483 --> 01:06:43,701
Last night you dance,
 you laugh

992
01:06:43,726 --> 01:06:45,593
but inside you cry.

993
01:06:47,746 --> 01:06:49,457
Who are you to talk
to me that way?

994
01:06:50,925 --> 01:06:52,855
I'm Dusan Mirkovic,
your neighbor.

995
01:06:52,895 --> 01:06:54,011
Neighbors are friends.

996
01:06:54,036 --> 01:06:55,550
Friends tell friends the truth.

997
01:06:57,095 --> 01:06:59,524
Okay, maybe sometimes
I'm a little bit asshole,

998
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:01,384
but the world needs assholes.

999
01:07:01,409 --> 01:07:03,175
Otherwise where
would shit go out.

1000
01:07:05,204 --> 01:07:06,063
Dusan...

1001
01:07:06,157 --> 01:07:08,142
-Bye.
-Thank you.

1002
01:07:13,741 --> 01:07:15,515
When I think of big
people becoming small

1003
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:17,336
-Mm-mm.
-all the new small cities

1004
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:19,712
in the world, I see opportunity.

1005
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,498
I ask myself, Dusan,

1006
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:25,169
why the people they
want to become small?

1007
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:26,701
To help the environment?

1008
01:07:26,779 --> 01:07:28,115
Please.

1009
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:30,491
The become small
to have the things

1010
01:07:30,516 --> 01:07:32,398
which until now were
only for the rich,

1011
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:35,202
which, by the way, is the
genius of the concept.

1012
01:07:35,727 --> 01:07:39,984
So I say to my brother Srdjan--
I work with my brother.

1013
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:41,519
He's still big.

1014
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,425
My wife, too, by the way.

1015
01:07:43,849 --> 01:07:44,747
I say,

1016
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:47,786
why not bring very special items,

1017
01:07:47,811 --> 01:07:50,513
luxury items, to the
small consumer?

1018
01:07:50,553 --> 01:07:54,342
The-The things that nobody
else is thinking to bring?

1019
01:07:54,926 --> 01:07:55,941
Such as?

1020
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:59,230
Well, Cohiba Esplendido.

1021
01:07:59,269 --> 01:08:01,519
Cuba. Best cigar in the world.

1022
01:08:01,652 --> 01:08:03,754
How much you pay for this
when you big?

1023
01:08:03,926 --> 01:08:05,871
Forty-five, fifty dollars.

1024
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,240
When you small,
I sell you this cigar

1025
01:08:08,302 --> 01:08:09,779
for one dollar.

1026
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:14,416
And from this one Cohiba,
we make about 2,000 cigars.

1027
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,047
Okay, maybe they're not
actually made in Cuba.

1028
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:21,396
Maybe they're rolled by
little Albanians in Bujanovac

1029
01:08:21,421 --> 01:08:22,483
but who cares?

1030
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:24,233
And this is just one thing.

1031
01:08:24,344 --> 01:08:29,249
There's perfume, cologne,
brandy, port, Calvados,

1032
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,289
truffles, caviar, pfft.

1033
01:08:31,383 --> 01:08:32,812
Is all that legal?

1034
01:08:33,406 --> 01:08:36,414
Baby, this is Wild West.

1035
01:08:36,902 --> 01:08:38,722
Who has time
chasing after some

1036
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:41,300
fucking Serbian guy
five inches tall

1037
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:43,348
over a few cigars
and some wine.

1038
01:08:44,134 --> 01:08:47,469
My brother and I are
now in seven small cities

1039
01:08:47,494 --> 01:08:50,188
around the world.
Seven.

1040
01:08:50,305 --> 01:08:54,166
And Paul, listen, anything
you want, I can get for you.

1041
01:08:54,191 --> 01:08:55,602
Anything, anytime.

1042
01:08:55,627 --> 01:08:56,901
Excuse me a minute.

1043
01:09:11,202 --> 01:09:12,249
Hello?

1044
01:09:15,663 --> 01:09:17,108
Uh, can I talk to you
for a minute?

1045
01:09:20,562 --> 01:09:23,069
Na-pro-shien. What this do?

1046
01:09:30,965 --> 01:09:34,778
Uh, Naproxen.
I-It's a anti-inflammatory.

1047
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:36,723
It's for pain and swelling.

1048
01:09:41,317 --> 01:09:43,504
And this one, what this one do?

1049
01:09:44,426 --> 01:09:47,200
Uh, well, Vicodin. That's
also a pain killer,

1050
01:09:47,231 --> 01:09:50,669
but...you wanna be really
careful with that one.

1051
01:09:50,889 --> 01:09:53,108
Pain killer? Pain killer good.

1052
01:09:53,194 --> 01:09:56,366
Listen, I-- this is not
my apartment and, uh,

1053
01:09:56,475 --> 01:09:58,881
you know, I'm sure you're
probably in a lot of pain, but

1054
01:09:58,952 --> 01:10:00,960
y-you shouldn't steal pills.

1055
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:02,612
I no steal.

1056
01:10:02,706 --> 01:10:04,253
They too old, no good.

1057
01:10:04,278 --> 01:10:07,253
Mr. Dusan, he say me okay
I take away things.

1058
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:09,206
Pill for sick friend.

1059
01:10:16,936 --> 01:10:20,155
Okay, I finish now.
Bathroom clean.

1060
01:10:23,214 --> 01:10:25,285
Well, whatever's wrong
with your friend,

1061
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:28,308
I can see that you have a really,
really bad prosthetic foot

1062
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:30,636
and I'm sure it's causing you
pain in your right hip and knee,

1063
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:33,027
probably your other knee,
your lower-back.

1064
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:35,574
How you know this thing?

1065
01:10:36,269 --> 01:10:37,418
You doctor?

1066
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,572
Occupational therapist.

1067
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:41,822
Wait a minute.

1068
01:10:42,299 --> 01:10:43,533
I-I know you.

1069
01:10:45,056 --> 01:10:46,697
You're the--oh, my God.

1070
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:48,986
You're that woman from
a couple of years ago,

1071
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:49,916
the dissident.

1072
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:52,470
From Thailand or something?
What's your name?

1073
01:10:53,231 --> 01:10:55,285
Tran Ngoc Lan. Vietnam.

1074
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:57,638
Tran Ngoc Lan from Vietnam.

1075
01:10:57,716 --> 01:10:59,021
Yes! that's right.

1076
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,833
that's--and I
remember that you-you

1077
01:11:00,858 --> 01:11:02,146
lost your leg below the knee.

1078
01:11:02,255 --> 01:11:04,099
that's-that-
that's you!

1079
01:11:04,654 --> 01:11:05,521
Wow!

1080
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:10,485
Uh, Dusan!

1081
01:11:10,837 --> 01:11:13,344
Hey! Do you know
who this is here?

1082
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,493
Of course, the famous
Ngoc Lan Tran.

1083
01:11:15,624 --> 01:11:17,631
Dramatic escape from
Vietnamese prison,

1084
01:11:17,656 --> 01:11:20,749
almost died, so now,
she can clean my house.

1085
01:11:21,497 --> 01:11:24,708
America, big land of opportunity.

1086
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:32,396
Push up, push again.
Push, push, push.

1087
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,616
Okay, that's--now take your
heel back towards you.

1088
01:11:35,114 --> 01:11:36,474
Even harder if you can.

1089
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:38,427
Even--yeah.

1090
01:11:38,999 --> 01:11:39,788
Yeah.

1091
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,648
You-you put your hand
right here, now--

1092
01:11:41,733 --> 01:11:43,741
Feel that. Okay. See
that crunching?

1093
01:11:43,815 --> 01:11:45,628
You hear it?
Yeah, that's arthritis.

1094
01:11:45,729 --> 01:11:48,120
That's already...pretty bad.

1095
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,378
Paul,

1096
01:11:49,789 --> 01:11:51,336
you're full of surprises.

1097
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:55,078
You can do this but you work
shit job answering phones?

1098
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:56,672
Well, when I moved down here,
I didn't think I'd be working

1099
01:11:56,697 --> 01:11:58,523
so I let my license expire and...

1100
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:00,391
now, I'd have to get it
in a whole 'nother state.

1101
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,625
It's a whole...it's a boring story.

1102
01:12:05,003 --> 01:12:06,660
I hate to say it, but...

1103
01:12:06,761 --> 01:12:08,104
if you don't do
something pretty soon,

1104
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:09,503
you're gonna need a new knee.

1105
01:12:09,712 --> 01:12:11,141
Maybe even a new hip.

1106
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:13,157
You gotta go to a specialist
as soon as you can

1107
01:12:13,182 --> 01:12:14,915
a-and get a whole new foot.

1108
01:12:15,032 --> 01:12:16,282
In the meantime,

1109
01:12:16,325 --> 01:12:18,646
I could make some adjustments
on the existing prosthetic.

1110
01:12:18,671 --> 01:12:21,224
And maybe give you some
pointers on how to walk better.

1111
01:12:21,327 --> 01:12:22,943
I just hate to see you
needlessly suffer

1112
01:12:22,968 --> 01:12:24,396
after all you've been through.

1113
01:12:24,451 --> 01:12:26,991
Okay. I finish work
you come with me.

1114
01:12:27,455 --> 01:12:29,736
Yeah, no, I can get my tools,
I can do it right here.

1115
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:33,080
No. I say you before my
friend sick, need pill.

1116
01:12:33,177 --> 01:12:35,599
You come with me my house.
Help her.

1117
01:12:35,716 --> 01:12:37,122
You help her.

1118
01:12:37,616 --> 01:12:41,202
I...I don't think I was clear.
I can help you with this

1119
01:12:41,235 --> 01:12:43,030
but I'm not a doctor, so

1120
01:12:43,055 --> 01:12:44,164
your friend, whatever's
wrong with her,

1121
01:12:44,189 --> 01:12:45,597
she's gotta go to a
clinic or a hospital...

1122
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:47,180
No! Clinic no good.

1123
01:12:47,205 --> 01:12:49,041
I bring her clinic
wait too long time.

1124
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:52,369
Stupid doctor say no help
for her, no do nothing.

1125
01:12:52,473 --> 01:12:56,160
He no good stupid doctor in
big world, now he small.

1126
01:12:56,708 --> 01:12:57,792
You come with me.

1127
01:12:58,701 --> 01:13:00,194
You come with me now.

1128
01:13:01,038 --> 01:13:01,717
Uh.

1129
01:13:04,521 --> 01:13:05,537
Come.

1130
01:13:23,305 --> 01:13:24,446
You live near here?

1131
01:13:24,727 --> 01:13:26,188
No, still far.

1132
01:13:27,473 --> 01:13:29,238
Maybe we should grab a car.

1133
01:13:30,191 --> 01:13:31,965
No need car. Take bus.

1134
01:13:45,336 --> 01:13:47,188
If-If you don't mind my asking,

1135
01:13:47,234 --> 01:13:49,265
you were so famous a
couple of years ago,

1136
01:13:49,298 --> 01:13:51,180
I mean, everybody was
talking about you.

1137
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:53,012
I just would've thought
you'd have been

1138
01:13:53,121 --> 01:13:55,441
giving speeches
or writing books.

1139
01:13:55,763 --> 01:13:57,935
How'd-How'd you wind up
cleaning houses?

1140
01:13:58,318 --> 01:13:59,771
Need money for live.

1141
01:14:00,232 --> 01:14:04,311
After TV box, I stay hospital

Gracias, doctor.

1206
01:19:55,325 --> 01:19:57,253
Have you tried to move her
every couple of hours

1207
01:19:57,278 --> 01:19:59,083
so she doesn't get bedsores?

1208
01:20:00,715 --> 01:20:02,301
We should probably do that.

1209
01:20:04,528 --> 01:20:06,575
Come, there you--okay.

01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:58,119

01:20:58,635 --> 01:20:59,846
Paul Safranek.

1229
01:21:09,602 --> 01:21:10,813
Let's see...

1230
01:21:10,886 --> 01:21:13,839
The Extra Large is
available in glacier,

1231
01:21:13,864 --> 01:21:18,183
pebble, tulip, cayenne,
moss and aubergine.

1232
01:21:18,597 --> 01:21:22,066
<i>Cayenne, is-is that like red?</i>

1233
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:25,417
It's-It's a brownish red.
It's more like brick.

1234
01:21:25,878 --> 01:21:27,573
<i>No, I don't like brick.</i>

1235
01:21:28,511 --> 01:21:30,284
<i>Do you think moss is pretty?</i>

1236
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,456
You know, I-I don't know, lady.

1237
01:21:32,481 --> 01:21:34,245
Why don't you just
pick a color please?

1238
01:21:34,751 --> 01:21:36,228
<i>Don't be short with me.</i>

1239
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:38,454
What did you say?

1240
01:21:53,707 --> 01:21:54,520
Shoe.

1241
01:21:58,417 --> 01:21:59,526
Where's Gladys?

1242
01:21:59,744 --> 01:22:01,010
Oh, she die.

01:22:03,003 --> 01:22:04,198
I'm so sorry.

1245
01:22:04,301 --> 01:22:06,551
I think maybe I give
her too much pill.

1246
01:22:06,786 --> 01:22:09,192
Anyway, she die
very happy smiling.

1247
01:22:10,461 --> 01:22:12,539
Okay, you fix foot now.

Near my village

01:23:00,229 --> 01:23:01,315
You know,

1262
01:23:01,698 --> 01:23:05,518

01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:08,222
Stay tree then

01:23:12,121 --> 01:23:13,613
-Yes.
-Yeah, sounds beautiful.

1266
01:23:15,363 --> 01:23:17,269
How do you say butterfly

1267
01:23:18,136 --> 01:23:19,136
<i>Con bu'ó'm.</i>

<i>Con bu'ó'm.</i>

1270
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:27,695
Kon booyem.

1271
01:23:27,766 --> 01:23:28,993
You miss your village?

1272
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:30,811
No more village.

1273
01:23:31,476 --> 01:23:34,022
Government make the
people go away put water

1274
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:37,101
all over, all over everywhere.
Too much water.

1275
01:23:37,539 --> 01:23:38,594
Too much water?

1276
01:23:38,766 --> 01:23:41,157
Big water for make electricity.

1277
01:23:41,336 --> 01:23:42,180
Oh, a dam.

1278
01:23:42,266 --> 01:23:44,914
-Yes, dam. They make dam.
-Dam. Uh-huh.

1279
01:23:45,305 --> 01:23:47,516
Many village no more.

1280

01:23:53,142 --> 01:23:55,548

She die prison.

01:24:07,263 --> 01:24:10,779
Too cold. Chest fill up bad.

1286
01:24:25,196 --> 01:24:26,946
-What happen?
-Nothin'.

1287
01:24:29,079 --> 01:24:30,785
No, just, no...

1288
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,090
-What you do?
-No, nothing, nothing, I just--

1289
01:24:33,636 --> 01:24:35,019
You stupid man!

1290
01:24:35,044 --> 01:24:37,448
You needed a new foot anyway.
We'll get you a good one.

1291
01:24:37,534 --> 01:24:39,800
Is that so hard to understand?
Jesus!

1292
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:41,592
Don't say Jesus bad way!

1293
01:24:41,617 --> 01:24:43,521
What, now I'm supposed
to watch my language?

1294
01:24:43,677 --> 01:24:44,967
You're worse than my mother.

1295
01:24:45,068 --> 01:24:46,787
I feel sorry for your mother.

1296
01:24:46,818 --> 01:24:49,123
I sure she suffer too
much for your fault.

1297
01:24:54,128 --> 01:24:55,714
Not do so fast!

1298
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:59,190
Vacuum cleaner need time
same direction clean good.

1299
01:25:09,426 --> 01:25:10,980
Yeah, and you can take these,

1300
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:13,894
these are samosas from
a couple of days ago.

1301
01:25:14,308 --> 01:25:16,824
Thank you, yes.
I take all these.

1302
01:25:16,918 --> 01:25:19,590
Oh, I think this is saag paneer--

1303
01:25:19,683 --> 01:25:21,301
might be a little bit old.

1304
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:27,471
Oh, in prison
we die for such food.

1305
01:25:31,332 --> 01:25:33,808
Okay, not too many leftover
entrees today

1306
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:35,886
but I threw in lots of
baked potato soup.

1307
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:37,316
Thank you, Roger.

1308
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:39,185
There you go.

1309
01:25:39,482 --> 01:25:41,990
Hey, finally got yourself
a helper, huh, Ngoc Lan?

1310
01:25:42,295 --> 01:25:44,732
This Paul. He break my foot.

1311
01:25:46,923 --> 01:25:48,008
How'd you manage that, buddy?

1312
01:25:48,033 --> 01:25:49,509
It's a long story,
we're sorting it out.

1313
01:25:49,542 --> 01:25:50,839
He stupid!

1314
01:26:02,229 --> 01:26:04,643
<i>Hola, Señor Cárdenas.</i>

1315
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:06,150
<i>¿Hambre?</i>

1316
01:26:06,517 --> 01:26:09,032
<i>Ay, sí, chinita. Gracias.</i>

1317
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:13,234
<i>God will repay you.</i>

1318
01:26:13,499 --> 01:26:15,140
<i>How's your lung?</i>

1319
01:26:15,866 --> 01:26:17,671
<i>How's your lung?</i>

1320
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:20,333
<i>I feel a little better today.</i>

1321
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:21,708
<i>Gracias.</i>

1322
01:26:22,021 --> 01:26:23,028
<i>Bueno.</i>

1323
01:26:23,357 --> 01:26:25,653
Okay, over here, this way.

1324
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:33,047
<i>Mucho dolor, verdad?</i>

1325
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:34,399
<i>Yes, it hurts a lot.</i>

1326
01:26:34,434 --> 01:26:35,880
Oh, it looks really painful.

1327
01:26:35,905 --> 01:26:37,805
<i>I give him baths and scrub him</i>

1328
01:26:37,939 --> 01:26:41,173
<i> and put herbs,
but nothing helps.</i>

1329
01:26:41,328 --> 01:26:44,127
I bet that's ringworm

1330
01:26:44,152 --> 01:26:45,635
which I don't know
how to say in Spanish.

1331
01:26:45,674 --> 01:26:48,346
But ringworm is a fungus, so

1332
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:49,721
you want it dry.

1333
01:26:49,776 --> 01:26:53,096
<i>Seco. Seco. No baño.
No baño. No agua. No agua.</i>

1334
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:54,096
And uh...

1335
01:26:54,157 --> 01:26:55,643
see if I can pick something
up at the drugstore

1336
01:26:55,668 --> 01:26:56,885
and bring it for him tomorrow.

1337
01:26:56,910 --> 01:26:58,048
Yes, you bring.

1338
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,629
<i>Mañana medicina.</i>

1339
01:26:59,958 --> 01:27:00,977
<i>Mañana medicina.</i>

1340
01:27:01,256 --> 01:27:02,587
<i>-Mañana medicina.
-Gracias, doctor.</i>

1341
01:27:02,612 --> 01:27:04,067
Okay, next. Let's go.

1342
01:27:04,122 --> 01:27:05,356
<i>-Gracias, doctor.
-Gracias.</i>

1343
01:27:05,497 --> 01:27:07,278
-Let's go!
-I'm comin'.

1344
01:27:11,515 --> 01:27:12,562
Take care for him.

1345
01:27:12,656 --> 01:27:14,273
-See you next time.
<i>-Gracias.</i>

1346
01:27:15,728 --> 01:27:17,595
So that's it?
We go home now?

1347
01:27:17,736 --> 01:27:19,853
Now we go church pray Jesus.

1348
01:27:49,944 --> 01:27:52,537
You come back tomorrow
pick me up eight o'clock.

1349
01:27:52,562 --> 01:27:54,406
Yeah, okay, I'll be here.

1350
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:07,302
Good morning, Mr. Dusan.
We come clean for you.

1351
01:28:27,809 --> 01:28:31,004
Answering telephones was not
dignified enough for you.

1352
01:28:31,029 --> 01:28:33,403
Now you progress
to cleaning toilets.

1353
01:28:33,504 --> 01:28:35,121
I love you, Paul.

1354
01:28:35,442 --> 01:28:38,426
I really love you.
You're such a funny guy.

1355
01:28:38,461 --> 01:28:39,711
Hilarious.

1356
01:28:39,929 --> 01:28:41,344
Like I said,

1357
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:43,624
you're too much nice guy

1358
01:28:43,812 --> 01:28:46,511
and a little bit...pathetic guy.

1359
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:48,269
It's just until
she gets a new foot.

1360
01:28:48,325 --> 01:28:49,981
-When will that be.
-I don't know.

1361
01:28:50,046 --> 01:28:52,343
The doctor said a month,
maybe six weeks.

1362
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:54,531
-Ah, that's an eternity.
-I know.

1363
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,620
Meantime she's stuck
with a peg leg,

1364
01:28:56,645 --> 01:28:58,839
which is almost as bad
as having nothing at all.

1365
01:28:58,886 --> 01:28:59,831
I mean, look at her,

1366
01:28:59,878 --> 01:29:02,034
she's waddling around
like a goddamned pirate!

1367
01:29:03,987 --> 01:29:06,362
Paul! You no talk
with Mr. Dusan!

1368
01:29:06,456 --> 01:29:08,206
You go upstairs with Veronica!

1369
01:29:09,197 --> 01:29:11,001
-Paul!
-I heard you.

1370
01:29:11,447 --> 01:29:13,080
Don't worry, Paul.

1371
01:29:15,837 --> 01:29:17,587
Dusan will save you.

1372
01:29:29,398 --> 01:29:30,399
Wow.

1373
01:29:32,254 --> 01:29:34,411
Yeah, Miss Tran,
take everything.

1374
01:29:36,423 --> 01:29:39,501
Mr. Konrad and I are
leaving day after tomorrow

1375
01:29:39,603 --> 01:29:41,743
and don't know when
we'll be back.

1376
01:29:42,555 --> 01:29:44,524
Okay good. Thank you.

1377
01:29:44,641 --> 01:29:46,579
Paul, Mr. Dusan say
I take all the food.

1378
01:29:46,604 --> 01:29:48,133
You go find me big box.

1379
01:29:48,209 --> 01:29:49,505
In a minute.

1380
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:52,615
First there's something
very important to discuss.

1381
01:29:54,553 --> 01:29:55,459
Me?

1382
01:29:55,787 --> 01:29:57,826
This is the situation.

1383
01:29:58,147 --> 01:30:00,162
I don't know exactly what,

1384
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:02,263
but something big-- very big-

1385
01:30:02,288 --> 01:30:04,928
is happening at the
original small colony.

1386
01:30:04,953 --> 01:30:06,717
You know, the one in Norway.

1387
01:30:07,459 --> 01:30:09,264
They want me to
go there right away

1388
01:30:09,289 --> 01:30:11,545
with a very important delivery.

1389
01:30:11,701 --> 01:30:13,404
It's too complicated to explain.

1390
01:30:13,435 --> 01:30:16,756
Top secret and... very urgent.

1391
01:30:17,051 --> 01:30:21,090
Most important they are
offering us very big money.

1392
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:22,465
Very big.

1393
01:30:22,989 --> 01:30:25,761
That means we need extra help

1394
01:30:25,847 --> 01:30:28,612
to do this quickly,
make them happy.

1395
01:30:28,712 --> 01:30:31,305
And I'm sorry to say, we need
the same excellent helper

1396
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:33,017
who is currently helping you.

1397
01:30:33,118 --> 01:30:34,087
Him.

1398
01:30:34,699 --> 01:30:36,066
That's right, Ngoc Lan,

1399
01:30:36,152 --> 01:30:38,707
I have to go with
these guys to Norway.

1400
01:30:40,937 --> 01:30:43,601
So... you say...

1401
01:30:43,843 --> 01:30:46,046
Paul go with you Norway?

1402
01:30:46,579 --> 01:30:48,150
That's the situation.

1403
01:30:48,548 --> 01:30:50,158
Emergency situation.

1404
01:30:50,189 --> 01:30:52,275
And deeply humanitarian.

1405
01:30:53,524 --> 01:30:55,297
I mean, Ngoc Lan, I will

1406
01:30:55,438 --> 01:30:58,141
be able to help when I get
back one-hundred-percent

1407
01:30:58,188 --> 01:30:59,782
when the new foot, and--

1408
01:30:59,883 --> 01:31:01,344
You leave Wednesday?

1409
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:02,865
Yes.

1410
01:31:04,232 --> 01:31:05,701
And how long you go?

1411
01:31:09,408 --> 01:31:11,268
Ten days. Maybe more.

1412
01:31:17,057 --> 01:31:19,057
Okay, yes, Norway.

1413
01:31:19,268 --> 01:31:20,885
I go Norway too.

1414
01:31:21,537 --> 01:31:23,271
No, no, no, not you.

1415
01:31:23,888 --> 01:31:25,177
Only Paul.

1416
01:31:25,521 --> 01:31:26,747
I go Norway too.

1417
01:31:26,818 --> 01:31:28,357
Paul, you help me
on the trip.

1418
01:31:29,808 --> 01:31:31,276
But you're very busy here

1419
01:31:31,301 --> 01:31:33,683
with humanitarian
activities on your own.

1420
01:31:33,823 --> 01:31:35,714
And your cleaning business.

1421
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:38,801
Veronica and other ladies
know every place.

1422
01:31:38,903 --> 01:31:40,450
They do for me,
I pay them good.

1423
01:31:40,512 --> 01:31:41,895
No problem I go.

1424
01:31:42,509 --> 01:31:45,320
Norway colony people
invite me so many time

1425
01:31:45,345 --> 01:31:46,790
but I never go.

1426
01:31:46,884 --> 01:31:49,048
Feel so, so guilty.

1427
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:51,876
They so nice people.

1428
01:31:52,637 --> 01:31:53,489
What?

1429
01:31:54,043 --> 01:31:55,536
Who invited you?

1430
01:31:57,143 --> 01:32:00,143
When I hospital so long time
after TV box,

1431
01:32:00,572 --> 01:32:02,838
people all over world

1432
01:32:02,979 --> 01:32:06,369

flower, candy,

1433
01:32:06,565 --> 01:32:07,916

1434
01:32:08,518 --> 01:32:10,089
So many letter.

1435
01:32:10,182 --> 01:32:12,667
One letter very special
I never forget.

1436
01:32:13,018 --> 01:32:15,307
From Jorgen Asbjornsen.

1437
01:32:16,892 --> 01:32:19,439
You got a letter from
Jorgen Asbjornsen?

1438
01:32:20,252 --> 01:32:22,330
Dr. Asbjornsen write me

1439
01:32:23,127 --> 01:32:25,502
say he feel so, so bad

1440
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,471
I suffer for his fault.

1441
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,181
He say he painful.

1442
01:32:31,284 --> 01:32:34,190
He never think make small
so bad for people.

1443
01:32:35,777 --> 01:32:38,582
Dr. Asbjornsen letter
make me feel so good.

1444
01:32:39,059 --> 01:32:40,762
I write letter too,

1445
01:32:40,863 --> 01:32:44,082

01:32:47,327 --> 01:32:50,281
He say me make trip

1447
01:32:50,984 --> 01:32:52,632
But I too busy.

1448
01:32:53,285 --> 01:32:54,597
Always too busy.

1449
01:32:54,622 --> 01:32:58,512
Now Jesus give me
special gift, go Norway.

1450
01:33:00,757 --> 01:33:04,289
Thank you Mr. Dusan,
thank you Mr. Konrad.

1451
01:33:06,337 --> 01:33:07,165
Yes.

1452
01:33:07,368 --> 01:33:09,220
I go Norway too.

1453
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:10,704
So happy.

1454
01:33:11,298 --> 01:33:13,493
Thank you special time.

1455
01:35:14,204 --> 01:35:15,407
Paul, look.

1456
01:35:15,782 --> 01:35:19,017
This Jorgen Asbjornsen.
And his wife.

1457
01:35:20,525 --> 01:35:23,001
Oh, my God. Jorgen Asbjornsen.

1458
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:25,859
Hello.

1459
01:35:26,484 --> 01:35:27,820
This is such an honor.

1460
01:35:27,929 --> 01:35:29,132
I know, I know.

1461
01:35:29,408 --> 01:35:30,455
See, Paul?

1462
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:32,439
Jesus smile for me.

1463
01:35:32,516 --> 01:35:35,688
I say Paul I want visit
Norway only for meet you.

1464
01:35:36,243 --> 01:35:37,102
It's true.

1465
01:35:37,354 --> 01:35:39,299
-I'm Anne-Helene.
-Hello.

1466
01:35:39,541 --> 01:35:41,033
Please, sit. Join us.

1467
01:35:41,487 --> 01:35:42,698
Thank you.

1468
01:35:42,885 --> 01:35:44,694
We're watching the world go by.

1469
01:35:44,913 --> 01:35:46,007
Sounds great.

1470
01:35:47,132 --> 01:35:48,616
You have no idea how terribly

1471
01:35:48,641 --> 01:35:51,625
grief-stricken we were
by Miss Tran's case.

1472
01:35:52,182 --> 01:35:55,706
Jorgen has lost so much
sleep over all the abuses.

1473
01:36:06,104 --> 01:36:07,846
It's humbling, huh?

1474
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:12,081
Nature is such
a patient sculptor.

1475
01:36:12,242 --> 01:36:14,242
Grinding a tiny bit

1476
01:36:14,374 --> 01:36:18,359
each day slowly, slowly
for thousands of years to

1477
01:36:18,437 --> 01:36:22,343
make such a supremely
beautiful thing.

1478
01:36:24,909 --> 01:36:26,221
What a waste.

1479
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,534
What a dreadful waste.

1480
01:36:41,145 --> 01:36:42,901
You'll have to excuse Jorgen.

1481
01:36:42,926 --> 01:36:46,246
These past few days has
been especially hard.

1482
01:36:46,795 --> 01:36:49,389
Such a big decision to make
and so quickly.

1483
01:36:49,965 --> 01:36:51,926
Normally when
we visit the Colony,

1484
01:36:51,951 --> 01:36:54,525
we like to spend a few
days in Honningsvåg.

1485
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:56,122
But then the news came...

1486
01:36:57,196 --> 01:37:00,102
and uh, yeah,
well, here we are

1487
01:37:00,336 --> 01:37:02,149
suddenly imposing on you.

1488
01:37:02,329 --> 01:37:04,149
We scarcely had
the time to pack.

1489
01:37:05,558 --> 01:37:07,136
I'm sorry, w-what news?

1490
01:37:08,074 --> 01:37:10,089
Why, the methane release.

1491
01:37:10,214 --> 01:37:12,917
In Antarctica. You must
know about the methane.

1492
01:37:13,771 --> 01:37:14,701
Yeah...

1493
01:37:15,099 --> 01:37:17,709
that's not-that's not
new, is it? I mean--

1494
01:37:18,098 --> 01:37:19,606
New or old,

1495
01:37:20,496 --> 01:37:21,817
it's the end.

1496
01:37:23,226 --> 01:37:25,726
It's the end of everything.

1497
01:37:28,054 --> 01:37:32,319
The world has already seen
five major extinctions,

1498
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:34,179
and now there will be another.

1499
01:37:34,655 --> 01:37:36,741
I...I didn't want to believe it.

1500
01:37:36,835 --> 01:37:38,327
None of us did, but

1501
01:37:38,507 --> 01:37:42,491
there we were in Helsinki,
big and small.

1502
01:37:42,702 --> 01:37:47,460
Climatologists, bacteriologists,
demographers, physicists,

1503
01:37:47,522 --> 01:37:49,069
immunologists,

1504
01:37:49,286 --> 01:37:52,497
26 Nobel Prize
winners among us.

1505
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:55,830
We built all the models,
did all the math,

1506
01:37:56,104 --> 01:37:58,799
and all conclusion
was consistent.

1507
01:37:59,756 --> 01:38:02,905
Homo Sapiens will soon
vanish from the Earth.

1508
01:38:04,194 --> 01:38:06,999
It is now an
actuarial certainty.

1509
01:38:08,381 --> 01:38:10,616
No matter how
the end will come--

1510
01:38:10,897 --> 01:38:13,413
environmental disaster,

1511
01:38:13,569 --> 01:38:15,116
pandemic disease,

1512
01:38:15,158 --> 01:38:16,529
unbreathable air,

1513
01:38:16,554 --> 01:38:19,151
impotable water,
not enough food,

1514
01:38:19,252 --> 01:38:23,463
nuclear winter, some
combination of them all.

1515
01:38:24,237 --> 01:38:29,807
Relatively soon the Earth will
indeed purge itself of human life,

1516
01:38:30,699 --> 01:38:33,480
and God knows how
many other species.

1517
01:38:35,035 --> 01:38:37,894
Do you really mean extinction?
What about downsizing?

1518
01:38:38,003 --> 01:38:39,847
Yeah, yeah, too little too late.

1519
01:38:40,011 --> 01:38:43,089
Only three percent of the
world has miniaturized.

1520
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:45,519
There simply isn't enough time.

1521
01:38:49,159 --> 01:38:53,104
Not a very successful
species, these Homo Sapiens,

1522
01:38:53,267 --> 01:38:56,063
even with such great
intelligence.

1523
01:38:56,212 --> 01:38:58,806
Barely 200,000 years.

1524
01:38:59,093 --> 01:39:01,959
Alligator has survived
200 million years

1525
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:04,741
with a brain
the size of a walnut.

1526
01:39:09,024 --> 01:39:10,976
People have been predicting
the end of the world

1527
01:39:11,001 --> 01:39:12,672
for thousands of years.

1528
01:39:13,852 --> 01:39:15,641
And now it's really happening.

1529
01:39:18,265 --> 01:39:20,640
I guess somebody
had to be right someday.

1530
01:39:22,187 --> 01:39:23,304
So sad.

1531
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:26,250
Very sad.

1532
01:39:40,652 --> 01:39:42,348
Okay, I go sleep now.

1533
01:39:42,738 --> 01:39:44,019
Good night, Paul.

1534
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:46,504
Good night, Ngoc Lan.

1535
01:39:49,532 --> 01:39:50,267
Ay.

1536
01:39:51,017 --> 01:39:51,939
You okay?

1537
01:39:52,197 --> 01:39:53,368
I fine.

1538
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:56,138
You know, maybe I should
take a look at your leg.

1539
01:39:56,404 --> 01:39:58,208
Okay, yes, you look.

1540
01:40:03,005 --> 01:40:04,138
Oh, yup.

1541
01:40:04,818 --> 01:40:05,615
Wow.

1542
01:40:06,622 --> 01:40:09,294
That peg is really
making the skin chafe.

1543
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:11,184
Okay.

1544
01:40:18,981 --> 01:40:20,137
You know,

1545
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:23,637
if somebody told me
ten years ago

1546
01:40:23,762 --> 01:40:26,075
that one day I'd be
five inches tall,

1547
01:40:26,135 --> 01:40:27,096
divorced,

1548
01:40:27,193 --> 01:40:30,053
helping a famous Vietnamese
dissident get a new foot

1549
01:40:30,115 --> 01:40:32,678
while cruising up
a fjord in Norway

1550
01:40:32,803 --> 01:40:35,748
discussing the end of the
world with Jorgen Asbjornsen,

1551
01:40:36,611 --> 01:40:38,689
I would've said he was crazy.

1552
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:15,129
I'm sorry.

1553
01:41:15,801 --> 01:41:17,621
I'm sorry. I-I thought--

1554
01:41:18,301 --> 01:41:19,879
Jesus, I'm such an idiot.

1555
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,207
No.

1556
01:41:22,996 --> 01:41:23,879
Please.

1557
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:25,449
I want.

1558
01:42:02,556 --> 01:42:04,049
Morning.

1559
01:42:06,559 --> 01:42:07,738
Good morning.

1560
01:42:11,447 --> 01:42:12,720
What's that sound?

1561
01:42:13,408 --> 01:42:14,494
A greeting.

1562
01:43:48,456 --> 01:43:49,307
Wow!

1563
01:43:49,425 --> 01:43:52,034
That's it, that's
the original colony.

1564
01:43:52,318 --> 01:43:55,060
Wait, and there's no net?
No walls?

1565
01:43:55,085 --> 01:43:56,546
No, we've been lucky.

1566
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:59,523
We are too close to the
sea for the mosquitoes.

1567
01:43:59,847 --> 01:44:01,767
And over the years,
we realized

1568
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:04,573
that the birds, they
preferred the lemmings.

1569
01:44:04,783 --> 01:44:07,174
But yes, this is
where we started

1570
01:44:07,276 --> 01:44:09,049
many years ago.

1571
01:44:44,258 --> 01:44:46,258
Jorgen, good to see you.

1572
01:44:47,172 --> 01:44:48,196
Welcome.

1573
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:50,001
No, no.

1574
01:44:50,071 --> 01:44:51,431
Jorgen!

1575
01:44:51,767 --> 01:44:53,392
Anne-Helene!

1576
01:44:53,615 --> 01:44:55,199
Oh, thank God you're here!

1577
01:44:55,224 --> 01:44:57,888
Why didn't anyone
tell me?

1578
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:01,515
Oh, I love you so much.

1579
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:05,204
I love you both so much.

1580
01:45:05,487 --> 01:45:07,634
Oh, ever since the decision,

1581
01:45:07,659 --> 01:45:09,737
I didn't feel right
without you here.

1582
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:11,825
And you know
how I am when I worry.

1583
01:45:11,850 --> 01:45:13,793
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

1584
01:45:13,818 --> 01:45:16,020
Ask anyone here,
they tell you.

1585
01:45:16,045 --> 01:45:18,196
Sorry to interrupt, Jorgen,

1586
01:45:18,221 --> 01:45:20,439
but we need your
advice immediately.

1587
01:45:20,464 --> 01:45:22,275
Yes. Excuse us, Solveig.

1588
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:25,619
Of course, darling. You've
got important things to do.

1589
01:45:26,773 --> 01:45:29,788
Oh! Dusan, Dusan, Dusan!

1590
01:45:29,882 --> 01:45:32,859
Bless you for coming so quickly.

1591
01:45:35,406 --> 01:45:38,468
Solveig, my darling,
I'm always happy to help

1592
01:45:38,493 --> 01:45:41,336
in difficult times, in easy
times, in happy times.

1593
01:45:41,361 --> 01:45:44,738
Is always a pleasure to come and
visit you and your lovely village.

1594
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:47,593
Oh, it is lovely, isn't it?

1595
01:45:47,728 --> 01:45:51,040
I can't bear to think
I won't see it again.

1596
01:45:51,494 --> 01:45:54,220
You know, I'm the one
who made this colony

1597
01:45:54,245 --> 01:45:56,204
 possible in the first place.

1598
01:45:56,322 --> 01:45:59,079
I've been coming since
I was just a baby.

1599
01:45:59,275 --> 01:46:01,400
I remember one time--

1600
01:46:02,196 --> 01:46:04,798
Wait. I know you.

1601
01:46:05,235 --> 01:46:07,579
You were in my dream last night.

1602
01:46:08,134 --> 01:46:12,649
You were a horse or a pony--
something very strong.

1603
01:46:12,798 --> 01:46:17,720
And I mounted you and rode you
through a dangerous forest.

1604
01:46:18,688 --> 01:46:21,352
-Okay.
-And here you are.

1605
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:23,165
Right before we leave.

1606
01:46:23,798 --> 01:46:25,696
Another miracle.

1607
01:46:26,478 --> 01:46:29,041
You are coming with us,
aren't you?

1608
01:46:29,446 --> 01:46:30,883
Where are you going?

1609
01:46:32,563 --> 01:46:33,672
In there.

1610
01:46:34,367 --> 01:46:35,852
Would you like to see?

1611
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:49,352
Where this go?

1612
01:46:49,844 --> 01:46:51,344
To the vault.

1613
01:46:52,469 --> 01:46:54,063
-The vault?
-Oh, yes.

1614
01:46:54,313 --> 01:46:57,664
We've been working on it almost
since the very beginning.

1615
01:46:58,212 --> 01:47:00,509
When Jorgen made
his big discovery,

1616
01:47:00,556 --> 01:47:03,501
I said, look, Jorgen,
you're a genius,

1617
01:47:03,626 --> 01:47:08,071
and downsizing is a genius idea.
No one is questioning that.

1618
01:47:08,196 --> 01:47:11,806
But what if people
don't accept it?

1619
01:47:11,868 --> 01:47:14,728
What if it doesn't
come out on time?

1620
01:47:15,231 --> 01:47:17,745
Anyway, this is what
they came up with.

1621
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:19,668
On my suggestion.

1622
01:47:20,143 --> 01:47:24,283
Torvald, be a sweetheart and
give our friends a little tour.

1623
01:47:24,994 --> 01:47:26,244
Well, sure.

1624
01:47:26,799 --> 01:47:28,508
The tunnel leads to a vault

1625
01:47:28,533 --> 01:47:31,807
1.6 kilometers inside
the Earth's lithosphere

1626
01:47:31,856 --> 01:47:35,145
and is encased in a double
layer of Inconel 625.

1627
01:47:35,387 --> 01:47:39,130
In addition to maintaining a
broad spectrum of biodiversity,

1628
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:42,958
the vault is equipped with
fields for growing foods,

1629
01:47:42,983 --> 01:47:46,755
forests for lumber, livestock
for animal husbandry.

1630
01:47:46,859 --> 01:47:49,763
The residential
areas are spacious

1631
01:47:49,788 --> 01:47:53,421
and easily expandable to provide
for future generations.

1632
01:47:55,005 --> 01:47:57,606
Wait, but that's not
all underground?

1633
01:47:57,669 --> 01:47:58,606
Oh, yes!

1634
01:47:58,653 --> 01:48:01,989
Our new small size
makes it possible.

1635
01:48:02,038 --> 01:48:04,944
Otherwise we never could
have dreamed of preserving

1636
01:48:04,969 --> 01:48:08,637
so much of the world
in a single safe place.

1637
01:48:08,894 --> 01:48:10,434
This is brilliant.

1638
01:48:11,254 --> 01:48:14,567
Isn't this brilliant? It's like-
It's like Noah's Ark.

1639
01:48:14,816 --> 01:48:17,778
Yes. exactly!
It's Noah's Ark!

1640
01:48:17,887 --> 01:48:20,652
So, how-what do you do for
power, is it nuclear?

1641
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:22,965
No, no, 100% geothermal.

1642
01:48:23,031 --> 01:48:25,265
And we have interoperable
organic systems

1643
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:27,937
to manage production of
artificial sunlight,

1644
01:48:28,023 --> 01:48:32,125
oxygen, CO2 elimination,
water purification, and so on.

1645
01:48:34,867 --> 01:48:36,961
And how long will you
stay down there?

1646
01:48:37,375 --> 01:48:41,023
Torvald, how long is it?
8,000 years?

1647
01:48:41,101 --> 01:48:42,718
Well, something like that.

1648
01:48:42,773 --> 01:48:45,648
Just until the surface
environment stabilizes.

1649
01:48:48,957 --> 01:48:51,621
It's not unprecedented
what we are doing here.

1650
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:54,347
Less than a hundred
thousand years ago

1651
01:48:54,472 --> 01:48:56,972
humans underwent
a near-extinction.

1652
01:48:57,433 --> 01:48:59,316
Maybe 2,000 survived.

1653
01:48:59,457 --> 01:49:00,902
And from that handful

1654
01:49:00,934 --> 01:49:03,291
came all of the billions
of people you see today.

1655
01:49:03,355 --> 01:49:05,675
Rebooting the species.
It's nothing new.

1656
01:49:05,715 --> 01:49:07,183
Yeah, exactly.

1657
01:49:15,324 --> 01:49:16,543
My friends.

1658
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:18,738
Many years ago,

1659
01:49:18,863 --> 01:49:22,004
when we discovered
cellular miniaturization,

1660
01:49:22,169 --> 01:49:24,896
the world which had
seemed so doomed

1661
01:49:24,993 --> 01:49:27,719
felt suddenly so full
of possibilities.

1662
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:32,867
So, until very recently,
I maintained hope

1663
01:49:32,985 --> 01:49:35,839
that the contingency plan
we embark upon tomorrow

1664
01:49:35,886 --> 01:49:38,285
could remain simply that--

1665
01:49:38,675 --> 01:49:40,136
a plan.

1666
01:49:41,746 --> 01:49:42,875
But...

1667
01:49:43,456 --> 01:49:45,134
history has spoken.

1668
01:49:45,995 --> 01:49:50,237
And this is our final dinner in
the place we've called home

1669
01:49:50,315 --> 01:49:52,151
for so many years.

1670
01:49:52,629 --> 01:49:55,919
Yes, we are sad to leave,

1671
01:49:57,105 --> 01:50:01,090
and terribly sad
for the reasons why.

1672
01:50:02,402 --> 01:50:06,043
But man is too beautiful,

1673
01:50:07,195 --> 01:50:10,044
too improbable a life form

1674
01:50:10,069 --> 01:50:13,812
to be allowed to disappear
forever from the cosmos.

1675
01:50:16,543 --> 01:50:17,801
Now then,

1676
01:50:19,215 --> 01:50:22,371
I would like to ask the
surviving members of the

1677
01:50:22,426 --> 01:50:24,801
original colony to stand.

1678
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:38,985
Ah, look at him.

1679
01:50:39,101 --> 01:50:40,742
Little Ronni.

1680
01:50:40,875 --> 01:50:43,118
How he has grown.

1681
01:50:47,909 --> 01:50:49,878
I ask you again

1682
01:50:50,011 --> 01:50:52,636
as I asked you
so many years ago.

1683
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:55,531
Generations to come,

1684
01:50:55,711 --> 01:50:58,179
perhaps all of humanity
will thank you

1685
01:50:58,204 --> 01:51:00,422
for your bravery
and commitment.

1686
01:51:00,934 --> 01:51:02,371
But you must ask yourself

1687
01:51:02,396 --> 01:51:05,270
whether you are truly ready
to enter a new world.

1688
01:51:05,551 --> 01:51:07,973
For there will be
no turning back.

1689
01:51:10,082 --> 01:51:11,816
Are you ready?

1690
01:51:12,901 --> 01:51:14,111
<i>I am ready!</i>

1691
01:51:14,471 --> 01:51:15,565
<i>I am ready!</i>

1692
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:16,897
<i>-I am ready!
-Yes!</i>

1693
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:18,303
<i>I am ready!</i>

1694
01:51:18,584 --> 01:51:20,202
Is everyone ready?

1695
01:51:26,149 --> 01:51:27,376
We are ready!

1696
01:51:27,688 --> 01:51:28,877
We are ready!

1697
01:51:29,336 --> 01:51:30,554
We are ready!

1698
01:51:30,954 --> 01:51:32,149
We are ready!

1699
01:51:32,759 --> 01:51:33,790
We are ready!

1700
01:51:34,391 --> 01:51:35,477
We are ready!

1701
01:51:36,196 --> 01:51:37,266
We are ready!

1702
01:51:37,781 --> 01:51:38,891
We are ready!

1703
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:40,703
We are ready!

1704
01:51:41,242 --> 01:51:42,507
We are ready!

1705
01:51:43,025 --> 01:51:44,096
We are ready!

1706
01:52:09,334 --> 01:52:10,404
Paul!

1707
01:52:12,389 --> 01:52:13,279
Yeah.

1708
01:52:13,778 --> 01:52:15,496
Can you come down here?

1709
01:52:20,457 --> 01:52:23,738
Where you go?
I look many place for you.

1710
01:52:25,012 --> 01:52:26,200
I was just here.

1711
01:52:26,645 --> 01:52:29,464
I talk with Mr. Dusan,
he say fat lady pay,

1712
01:52:29,489 --> 01:52:30,770
he ready go back.

1713
01:52:31,057 --> 01:52:32,087
I happy for that.

1714
01:52:32,112 --> 01:52:35,596
Too long time away from Señor
Cardenas and Mrs. Lopez.

1715
01:52:35,971 --> 01:52:38,253
Oh, I worry too much for them.

1716
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:40,379
Ngoc Lan, you can't just be

1717
01:52:40,426 --> 01:52:43,707
worried for a few little people
thousands of miles away.

1718
01:52:43,813 --> 01:52:45,876
You have to look at
the big picture.

1719
01:52:46,938 --> 01:52:48,282
Why you say like this?

1720
01:52:48,829 --> 01:52:52,673
Because...Mr. Cardenas
and Mrs. Lopez,

1721
01:52:53,125 --> 01:52:54,852
they don't stand a chance,

1722
01:52:55,493 --> 01:52:56,829
None of us do.

1723
01:52:57,182 --> 01:52:58,432
It's over.

1724
01:53:00,573 --> 01:53:02,104
You want go with them.

1725
01:53:02,534 --> 01:53:04,940
And I want you to come with me.

1726
01:53:06,557 --> 01:53:07,987
You crazy man!

1727
01:53:08,034 --> 01:53:10,995
Always I know you stupid.
Now I see you crazy too.

1728
01:53:11,073 --> 01:53:12,347
How am I crazy?

1729
01:53:12,432 --> 01:53:13,565
You heard them.

1730
01:53:13,628 --> 01:53:16,057
This is the only chance for
the survival of our species--

1731
01:53:16,082 --> 01:53:17,378
that's huge!

1732
01:53:17,403 --> 01:53:18,884
You want to help people?

1733
01:53:18,909 --> 01:53:21,097
These are the people
that you should be helping.

1734
01:53:21,968 --> 01:53:25,109
The future of humanity
is down that hole!

1735
01:53:25,531 --> 01:53:27,195
Who you help down there?

1736
01:53:27,476 --> 01:53:30,578
People here need help,
not down stupid hole!

1737
01:53:32,383 --> 01:53:34,539
Mr. Dusan, Mr. Konrad,

1738
01:53:34,586 --> 01:53:35,945
talk to crazy Paul.

1739
01:53:35,970 --> 01:53:38,492
He want go down hole,
me go with him.

1740
01:53:38,537 --> 01:53:39,693
Paul, Paul, Paul...

1741
01:53:39,834 --> 01:53:42,217
Why do you want to do
such a silly thing?

1742
01:53:42,723 --> 01:53:44,772
Dusan, these people are
actually trying to do something

1743
01:53:44,797 --> 01:53:48,199
to save the human race.
I wanna be a part of that.

1744
01:53:48,255 --> 01:53:49,724
Okay, fine, you want to help

1745
01:53:49,763 --> 01:53:51,998
then do what I did,
give them a semen sample.

1746
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:53,279
I did it too.

1747
01:53:53,484 --> 01:53:55,374
A much more
pleasant way to help.

1748
01:53:55,788 --> 01:53:57,468
If I'm not supposed to be
a part of this thing,

1749
01:53:57,507 --> 01:53:59,257
then w-what am I doing here?

1750
01:54:00,438 --> 01:54:02,180
Why didn't I become a doctor?

1751
01:54:02,594 --> 01:54:05,415
Why did I downsize?
Why did my wife abandon me?

1752
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:08,125
Dusan, how did you just
happen to be my neighbor?

1753
01:54:08,164 --> 01:54:09,366
And-And Ngoc Lan,
why are you

1754
01:54:09,391 --> 01:54:11,251
the only person who
survived that box

1755
01:54:11,391 --> 01:54:12,996
and you just happen
to be cleaning

1756
01:54:13,021 --> 01:54:14,606
Dusan's place on that day?

1757
01:54:14,682 --> 01:54:16,151
And-And had you
not lost your leg,

1758
01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:18,252
I wouldn't have tried to
help you, which, as usual,

1759
01:54:18,277 --> 01:54:19,370
I screwed up.

1760
01:54:19,432 --> 01:54:21,221
And why did I screw it up?

1761
01:54:21,339 --> 01:54:23,112
So that I could be here

1762
01:54:23,292 --> 01:54:26,846
right at the exact moment
to go down into that tunnel.

1763
01:54:27,466 --> 01:54:31,172
I finally have a chance to
do something that matters.

1764
01:54:31,337 --> 01:54:33,368
Oh, Paul, come on,
now you're talking crazy.

1765
01:54:33,485 --> 01:54:35,931
These people,
they're wonderful, but--

1766
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:37,290
It's like a cult.

1767
01:54:37,485 --> 01:54:39,547
It's a cult. You know,
and the extinction, well,

1768
01:54:39,665 --> 01:54:42,384
it's not gonna happen for, you
know, maybe few hundred years.

1769
01:54:42,415 --> 01:54:44,493
Has nothing to do with you.
Forget it.

1770
01:54:44,610 --> 01:54:47,438
Besides, you think they won't
behave like people always behave?

1771
01:54:47,509 --> 01:54:49,853
They're all gonna go insane
down there and kill each other.

1772
01:54:49,993 --> 01:54:51,946
They'll go extinct
long before we do.

1773
01:55:02,829 --> 01:55:05,586
Don't worry, darling.
He said it himself.

1774
01:55:05,611 --> 01:55:07,665
Nothing he ever wants
to do works out.

1775
01:55:45,265 --> 01:55:47,093
It's a beautiful day, huh?

1776
01:55:47,992 --> 01:55:50,718
I mean, knowing this is the
last time I'll see the real sun,

1777
01:55:50,743 --> 01:55:53,265
it makes it so... vibrant.

1778
01:55:57,113 --> 01:56:01,145
I ask you question.
You say me truth. Okay?

1779
01:56:01,276 --> 01:56:02,244
Of course.

1780
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:04,471
Other night on boat...

1781
01:56:04,643 --> 01:56:06,502
what kind of fuck you give me?

1782
01:56:07,117 --> 01:56:08,000
What?

1783
01:56:08,062 --> 01:56:10,171
What kind of fuck you give me?

1784
01:56:10,968 --> 01:56:13,093
What kind? I don't...

1785
01:56:13,164 --> 01:56:15,500
American people,
eight kind of fuck.

1786
01:56:15,623 --> 01:56:18,904
Love fuck, hate fuck,
sex-only fuck,

1787
01:56:18,998 --> 01:56:20,904
break-up fuck, make-up fuck,

1788
01:56:20,929 --> 01:56:23,576
drunk fuck, buddy fuck,
pity fuck.

1789
01:56:23,715 --> 01:56:26,309
Okay, I-I have no idea
where you heard that.

1790
01:56:26,426 --> 01:56:27,583
Third host family.

1791
01:56:27,608 --> 01:56:29,895
Okay, Th-that is just wrong.

1792
01:56:29,986 --> 01:56:32,080
Okay, there's a whole spectrum

1793
01:56:32,105 --> 01:56:34,830
of-of emotions and-
and motivations.

1794
01:56:35,197 --> 01:56:37,782
And don't say "fuck", i-it's vulgar.

1795
01:56:37,876 --> 01:56:41,267
Say something else like, you know,
"make love" or I don't know.

1796
01:56:41,433 --> 01:56:43,378
So... was love fuck?

1797
01:56:46,745 --> 01:56:48,323
Okay, what is this all about?

1798
01:56:52,019 --> 01:56:54,566
You look for me,
you want help me,

1799
01:56:54,777 --> 01:56:56,379
you make fuck with me,

1800
01:56:56,543 --> 01:56:58,535
now you go down stupid hole.

1801
01:56:59,317 --> 01:57:01,082
So I try to think

1802
01:57:01,645 --> 01:57:03,465
what kind fuck you give me.

1803
01:57:04,684 --> 01:57:06,621
I think maybe pity fuck.

1804
01:57:06,746 --> 01:57:07,598
For leg.

1805
01:57:07,676 --> 01:57:10,168
No, no, Ngoc Lan,

1806
01:57:10,715 --> 01:57:12,754
I care about you deeply.

1807
01:57:13,293 --> 01:57:15,965
You are such an
extraordinary person

1808
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:18,387
and I just admire you so much.

1809
01:57:19,362 --> 01:57:21,338
More than anything,

1810
01:57:21,448 --> 01:57:23,386
I want you to come with me.

1811
01:57:26,785 --> 01:57:29,019
People always say me I strong.

1812
01:57:30,933 --> 01:57:32,808
Okay, maybe Vietnam

1813
01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:36,371
I organize many protest,

1814
01:57:36,879 --> 01:57:38,683

1815
01:57:38,933 --> 01:57:40,504

1816
01:57:40,901 --> 01:57:43,221
I only person survive TV box.

I walk around no foot.

1818
01:57:45,706 --> 01:57:47,432
Take care of other people.

1819
01:57:48,065 --> 01:57:49,510
But I woman.

1820
01:57:49,987 --> 01:57:51,143
Feeling.

1821
01:57:53,423 --> 01:57:54,563
I'm sorry.

1822
01:57:54,891 --> 01:57:56,266
I really am.

1823
01:57:57,813 --> 01:58:00,852
It's so easy for me
to see who you are.

1824
01:58:01,282 --> 01:58:03,641
But if I don't do this,
who am I?

1825
01:58:04,495 --> 01:58:06,565
I mean, really. Who <i>am</i> I?

1826
01:58:07,273 --> 01:58:09,046
You Paul Safranek.

1827
01:58:09,742 --> 01:58:11,414
You good man.

1828
01:58:14,703 --> 01:58:16,062
Look, there's butterflies!

1829
01:58:16,984 --> 01:58:18,773
Look, Ngoc Lan! Butterflies!

1830
01:58:19,848 --> 01:58:21,809
Kon booyem! Kon booyem!

1831
02:00:04,692 --> 02:00:06,442
I guess this is it.

1832
02:00:07,841 --> 02:00:08,927
Konrad.

1833
02:00:10,037 --> 02:00:11,615
Very nice to have met you.

1834
02:00:12,279 --> 02:00:13,646
Pleasure was mine.

1835
02:00:14,208 --> 02:00:16,013
Good luck in there, Paul.

1836
02:00:27,089 --> 02:00:28,690
Take care of yourself.

1837
02:00:29,862 --> 02:00:30,846
I will.

1838
02:00:31,729 --> 02:00:32,768
You too.

1839
02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:36,010
I will miss my funny neighbor.

1840
02:00:52,281 --> 02:00:53,688
Your bible.

1841
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:59,167
But it's in Vietnamese.

1842
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:02,175
Words not matter.

1843
02:01:03,651 --> 02:01:05,057
Remember me.

1844
02:01:18,667 --> 02:01:20,089
You go away now.

1845
02:02:13,579 --> 02:02:14,649
Excuse me.

1846
02:02:14,727 --> 02:02:15,782
Hi, uh...

1847
02:02:15,868 --> 02:02:18,665
Is it just me or are
we walking uphill?

1848
02:02:18,789 --> 02:02:21,172
Yes. Prevents flooding.

1849
02:02:21,359 --> 02:02:24,359
-Tunde.
-Oh, hi. Paul.

1850
02:02:25,251 --> 02:02:26,680
It's just a few hours climb

1851
02:02:26,847 --> 02:02:28,862
before we begin
the descent to the vault.

1852
02:02:29,003 --> 02:02:30,518
Well, how long
is the whole walk?

1853
02:02:30,704 --> 02:02:32,823
Eleven hours.
Something like that.

1854
02:02:33,165 --> 02:02:35,759
See you down there.
Stay hydrated.

1855
02:03:31,715 --> 02:03:33,363
Wait!

1856
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:35,775
Wait!

1857
02:03:37,204 --> 02:03:38,634
Thank you so much.

1858
02:03:39,450 --> 02:03:41,168
-Wait, my bag.
-Leave it.

1859
02:03:41,262 --> 02:03:42,215
No, no, no!

1860
02:03:42,286 --> 02:03:44,825
I told you nothing ever
works out for this guy.

1861
02:03:44,851 --> 02:03:47,523
-Get my bag out!
-It's going to blow! Run!

1862
02:03:50,309 --> 02:03:51,739
Paul!

1863
02:03:52,301 --> 02:03:53,692
Ngoc Lan!

1864
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:03,893
I was thinking about
what you were saying.

1865
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:05,854
And I realized you were right.

1866
02:04:06,376 --> 02:04:08,353
I <i>am</i> Paul Safranek.

1867
02:04:09,228 --> 02:04:10,853
And what you were asking...

1868
02:04:12,501 --> 02:04:14,321
It <i>was</i> a love fuck.

1869
02:05:35,149 --> 02:05:36,672
And to think...

1870
02:05:37,969 --> 02:05:40,133
one day all of this...

1871
02:05:44,398 --> 02:05:46,709
Now maybe you
understand little bit

1872
02:05:46,734 --> 02:05:49,195
how I feel
after survive TV box.

1873
02:05:55,550 --> 02:05:57,847
When you know
death come soon,

1874
02:05:58,909 --> 02:06:01,339
you look around
things more close.

1875
02:07:07,698 --> 02:07:09,917
Wait here, I'll be right back.

1876
02:07:10,332 --> 02:07:13,605

02:07:19,766 --> 02:07:21,024

I know. Stop obsessing,
will you?

1882
02:07:52,428 --> 02:07:54,170
<i>Hola, Señor Cardenas.</i>

1883
02:07:55,146 --> 02:07:57,537
<i>-Oh, Hola, Paul.
-Are you hungry?</i>

1884
02:07:57,562 --> 02:07:59,951
<i>A lot. What did you
bring me today?</i>

1885
02:08:00,146 --> 02:08:02,693
<i>Ah, I think it's chicken.</i>

1886
02:08:02,918 --> 02:08:04,535
