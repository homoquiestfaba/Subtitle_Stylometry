1
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,620
Hi. Can I have a 7 and 7?

2
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:47,431
You look like an athlete.

3
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,100
I'm sorry?

4
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:54,404
You look athletic.
You know, like an athlete.

5
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:58,674
We're here
for a basketball game.

6
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:02,045
I knew that.

7
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:08,450
You don't see
too many girls in here.

8
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:13,522
Yeah. No, it's just
a close bar for me.

9
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:17,691
It's just... Close place
to get a drink, whatever.

10
00:03:23,564 --> 00:03:25,465
Shh, shh.

11
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:18,180
Go get dressed, hon.

12
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,215
There's no school today.

13
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:25,787
You don't got school today?
- It's Columbus Day.

14
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,390
Well, go get dressed
and wash your face.

15
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:35,629
Listen. I... I, uh...

16
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:38,298
I had a nice time.

17
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:42,870
Hey, do you, um...

18
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,440
Do you think I could
get a hundred dollars?

19
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:48,609
You wanna borrow
a hundred dollars?

20
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,510
Well...

21
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:53,246
You work at that place,
don't you?

22
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:55,615
No.
- Yeah. You do.

23
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:58,317
No. It's just...
I could really use it.

24
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:02,320
Look, I don't got
that kind of money.

25
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:03,787
Well, why not?

26
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,689
Aren't you, like,
a ballplayer and all that?

27
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:08,626
Look, I'm sor...

28
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:15,466
I had a nice time.

29
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:33,416
You wanna get
something to eat?

30
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,384
Is he coming?

31
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:55,769
Look at this. You're gonna
need some new shoes, huh?

32
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:57,571
Mm-hmm.

33
00:05:59,273 --> 00:06:01,408
I'll take the dog out for you.

34
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:31,869
I'm gonna be late.

35
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,770
Almost forgot
about you, huh?

36
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,040
All right, let's...
Uh-oh.

37
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:58,548
Come on.

38
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:13,796
Fuck.

39
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:23,671
Sunny!

40
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:29,644
We'll go eat.

41
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,701
You know what you want?

42
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,171
Go ahead. Read it
and tell her what you want.

43
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:46,980
All right, we'll just have two
of the 2.99 breakfast specials.

44
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:48,782
That's scrambled?

45
00:09:48,784 --> 00:09:50,917
Scrambled.

46
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,986
And coffee comes
with that, right? - Yeah.

47
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:54,854
Do you have your
players card? - Oh, yeah.

48
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:03,061
Got ya.

49
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:06,165
This is nice, huh?

50
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:25,515
Well, I'm gonna
call a car.

51
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:27,851
And they can take you to
Jenny's, if that's what you want.

52
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:29,019
Okay.

53
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:32,521
That'd be nice.
You get the day off.

54
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:34,190
Can I go get a pie?

55
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:36,125
They sell pie
at breakfast?

56
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,470
Well, I mean,
it's definitely a flood.

57
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:50,104
I know it's a flood,
but it's, you know,

58
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:52,140
not a natural one,
and that's...

59
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:58,012
Okay.

60
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:00,782
Okay. Yeah.

61
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:04,751
Well, you're probably fine,
but I'm here if you change your mind.

62
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:07,788
Mm-hmm.

63
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,224
There's no direct extension, but
anybody here can help you start a policy.

64
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:12,825
Yeah.

65
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,961
It's a call center.

66
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:17,195
Mm-hmm.

67
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:28,540
Hi. Sorry.
- Hold on a minute, will ya?

68
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,975
Max, um,

69
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:35,846
I was hoping that if... if, um,
Ted comes walking through here,

70
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:39,116
could you maybe
just tell him I'm around?

71
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:41,185
If I'm around, sure.

72
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:44,989
Actually, looks
like Ted needs you.

73
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:49,726
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

74
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:51,661
They're gonna use the lot.

75
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,963
We can triple the investment.

76
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:55,999
Okay.

77
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:58,134
You wanted to see me?

78
00:11:58,136 --> 00:12:00,270
We're getting a new
software package, okay?

79
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:04,205
Which means all of us are
gonna have to use the computers.

80
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,941
I'm just bringing everyone in in person
to see if there are any issues with that.

81
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:10,878
Yeah, that sounds great.
- All right.

82
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,115
So you got a big investment coming up?
- Yeah, what, on the phone?

83
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,650
You know the dirt lot
across the street?

84
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,585
They're gonna run
a gas line through it.

85
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:19,986
I know the guy
who's got the lease.

86
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:21,621
He doesn't know
anything about that.

87
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:24,124
We take over the lease,
we could triple it.

88
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,259
I always mean to invest.

89
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:28,228
You know,
you always hear about that.

90
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,596
"Invest for the future."
So...

91
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:31,997
You want in?

92
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,736
I mean, we could maybe
give you a share for... 2.000.

93
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:40,673
And I could triple it?
- That's what we're talking about.

94
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:43,876
But you gotta come in soon, by
the end of the week. We close on Friday.

95
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:47,579
Okay. I will.

96
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:50,048
Good. Give me your cell.
We'll work on the details later.

97
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,283
You know what? It's new, so I
can never remember the number.

98
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:56,119
Look it up on the phone.
- I don't have it with me.

99
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,188
It's at home. I don't like
to take personal calls at work.

100
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,590
Hey, give it to me later.
This will be good.

101
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:02,959
Yeah.
- Yeah. Shh.

102
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,902
Thought you
were going home.

103
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:15,937
Oh. Yeah.
I'm just waiting on a car.

104
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:21,776
How far are ya?
I can take ya.

105
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:23,778
Well, what about Ted?
I mean, don't you gotta work?

106
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:27,716
I'll take you, I'll come back.
Come on.

107
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,223
What's this?

108
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,993
Oh, uh,
that's just work.

109
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,097
You take pictures?

110
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:46,064
Portraits. Part-time,
at the mall.

111
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:48,133
That's really nice.

112
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,806
All right.

113
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,942
Maybe I can come in for a
minute and use the bathroom?

114
00:13:56,944 --> 00:14:00,411
Um, yeah, you know,
Sunny is kind of shy.

115
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,680
Oh.
- Is that okay?

116
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:04,148
Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,349
Sunny?

118
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:08,152
That's her name?

119
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:10,021
Uh, yeah.

120
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:11,355
Sunny.

121
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:14,758
Let me see.

122
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,227
I don't know.
I think these are narrow.

123
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:18,828
Here.

124
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,232
All right. What do you say?
We go with these, huh?

125
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:23,867
Hmm?

126
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:31,874
Come on. They got the little...
pink stripy guys on 'em.

127
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:33,275
What about Keds?

128
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:37,346
What's the difference,
Sunny, right?

129
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:41,082
If they had 'em here,
I'd get 'em.

130
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:44,685
I want what I had.

131
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:47,220
Well, we're here now,
and these are fine.

132
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:52,793
I still gotta get stuff for your party,
and I gotta get back to work.

133
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:56,430
Hi.

134
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:58,031
Go get your stuff.

135
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,867
I can charge these, right?

136
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:03,969
So which is it?

137
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,905
You're gonna
wear 'em or not?

138
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,175
All right, fine.
Fuck it.

139
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,445
One cheeseburger meal?

140
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:13,779
Yeah.

141
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:15,747
And a shake.

142
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,917
Just with a normal drink, like
a coke, and also a number three.

143
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,785
6.37.

144
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:53,815
What, are you...
What, are you... You're not hungry?

145
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,317
You don't wanna eat?

146
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,940
Are you gonna eat
the Happy Meal or what?

147
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,441
I'm gonna go get a shake.

148
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:01,277
You know what? No.

149
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,245
We're going.
Come here.

150
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,414
Take your food...

151
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,349
so you can eat it at home.

152
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:09,518
Here.

153
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,388
Can't look for shoes for you
all day and then have you throw a fit.

154
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,291
Hi. Can I have a car
at the Galleria Mall, please?

155
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,328
Yeah, how much
is that gonna be?

156
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:30,336
It's gonna be
a minute, so...

157
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:32,171
might as well eat.

158
00:17:32,173 --> 00:17:34,941
Let's take the bus.

159
00:17:34,943 --> 00:17:37,910
I'm not taking the bus.
- I can eat on the bus.

160
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,614
We're not taking
the fuckin' bus, Sunny,

161
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:44,149
so eat that or I'm
gonna take it away!

162
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,592
Come on.

163
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:11,608
It's too late to go back
to work now too.

164
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:23,051
All right,
I'll be back in a bit.

165
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:37,064
I can give you five dollars.

166
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:39,934
Yeah. Leave it
on the table there.

167
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:18,001
How's your girl?

168
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,537
Oh, she's good.
- Yeah?

169
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:24,007
Yeah.

170
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:27,376
She's growin'.

171
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:38,220
Sonny, right?

172
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:41,590
Uh-huh.

173
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:45,560
Like Sonny and Cher?

174
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:50,298
No, it's not a man's name.
It's... It's...

175
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,200
S-U-N-N...

176
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:56,236
It's like the sun,
you know?

177
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,039
Sunny.

178
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:10,616
You still dancing?

179
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:14,453
I never danced there.

180
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:41,544
Mom, these are too hard.

181
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:43,413
What?

182
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:50,586
Oh, God. Don't eat it.

183
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,756
It's okay.

184
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:57,058
It's not okay. It's not okay.
You gotta eat.

185
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,228
We can order pizza.
- Honey, we can't.

186
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:04,632
You want some soup?

187
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:06,734
Just microwave it,
and it'll become soft.

188
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,163
Let's see.

189
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,633
It's good.

190
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:46,603
It's hot. Be careful.

191
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,408
This isn't fair.

192
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,348
Look, I just
wanted to see, uh,

193
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,785
maybe what was going on
with the money, you know.

194
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,789
'Cause, um,

195
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,559
I got this investment
coming up.

196
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:13,595
No, it's with work.

197
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:19,868
You can come here.

198
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,603
Please. I never said that.

199
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:24,606
No, that is not true.

200
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:27,308
Yeah, well, you know what?
I'm not the one...

201
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,476
Why don't you stop
worrying about me?

202
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:31,644
Why don't you
stop worrying about me?

203
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:33,246
Yeah? Well, when?

204
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:15,652
Come on.

205
00:23:18,457 --> 00:23:20,157
Yes!

206
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:23,692
I can't take you every day though.
You know that, right?

207
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,227
I know.
- Good.

208
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:35,570
Yeah, I liked
being a waitress.

209
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,240
It was great 'cause you got to eat.
You know?

210
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:41,575
Be no good for me.

211
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:44,811
I eat enough dog shit
as it is.

212
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:47,247
You like it?
- What, the job?

213
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:49,216
I love it.
It's the best.

214
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:54,488
But you know what?

215
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,790
Every month, this guy
gives me five bucks a pop...

216
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:01,394
for some names,
their socials, e-mails.

217
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:02,962
What's he do with them?

218
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:04,463
Mm-mm-mm.

219
00:24:04,465 --> 00:24:06,666
It's 400 bucks though.

220
00:24:06,668 --> 00:24:08,768
Jesus.

221
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,303
I could see if he needs
some more.

222
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:14,371
Huh? No.

223
00:24:14,373 --> 00:24:18,842
Well, I can get you a deal
for your little girl.

224
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:21,345
If you want
some portraits of her.

225
00:24:21,347 --> 00:24:23,814
It iher birthday tomorrow.

226
00:24:23,816 --> 00:24:27,483
I gotta get back. Come by tonight.
I'm on till 9:00.

227
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:30,553
I'll try. Like... Like,
how much would that be?

228
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:32,555
Just come by.

229
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:35,225
So, how are we today, good?

230
00:24:35,227 --> 00:24:36,926
Yeah.

231
00:24:36,928 --> 00:24:39,661
That is quite a little blouse
you got there.

232
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:43,932
Oh, don't forget
about our little talk.

233
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:50,572
Hey, you mind if I ask...

234
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:53,342
Wha... You work
for a separate company, right?

235
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,678
What do they pay?

236
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,413
5.85.

237
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:02,650
Is that part-time only?

238
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:04,619
After 11:00 or mornings.

239
00:25:07,455 --> 00:25:09,989
So, like, who would I talk to
if I wanted to, you know...

240
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:11,590
I used to...

241
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:24,269
Hey.

242
00:25:24,271 --> 00:25:25,803
Mrs. Harwood?

243
00:25:25,805 --> 00:25:27,605
Oh. Jerome.

244
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:29,474
Angela is fine.
- Sorry.

245
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:31,876
Harwood's her dad's name.
I'm sorry I'm late.

246
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:36,314
Next time if you, um...
You can't leave her here this long.

247
00:25:36,316 --> 00:25:38,449
Yeah, no, sometimes,
she goes home with friends.

248
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:42,919
But, uh, you know, today I had the car,
so I-I... I told her to wait.

249
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,554
Do you have a minute?

250
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:45,689
Uh, yeah.

251
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:47,291
Yeah.

252
00:25:49,627 --> 00:25:53,597
Uh, have you ever tested Sunny
for reading difficulties?

253
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:57,633
No.

254
00:25:59,468 --> 00:26:01,603
No. I know.

255
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:05,473
I will. You know?
If you think that I should.

256
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:07,075
You know, we're not...
we're not always right.

257
00:26:07,077 --> 00:26:10,010
And she's young,
and dyslexia is tricky.

258
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:12,413
But we just
recommend testing.

259
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:15,516
Okay.

260
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:17,318
That's something
the school does, right?

261
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,953
I often recommend
private consultation.

262
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,622
It's...
Well, it's better.

263
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:23,623
It's faster.

264
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,958
And, uh, you must know someone
who could help.

265
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,361
Why would I know someone?

266
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:29,729
Being a nurse.

267
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:36,803
All right, listen.
You know what?

268
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:40,605
I'll, uh... If you have a test or whatever,
I'll let her take it,

269
00:26:40,607 --> 00:26:42,808
but I don't know anybody.

270
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,678
'Cause I'm not
a fuckin' nurse.

271
00:26:48,014 --> 00:26:50,682
Sun, come on.

272
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,922
Well, I gotta get back to the mall and pick
up some shit for my big new nursing job.

273
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:04,694
I'll probably get some pretty nice pills
if I was a nurse.

274
00:27:15,905 --> 00:27:18,107
I was thinking we'd go get
your picture taken.

275
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:21,377
You wanna do that?

276
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:23,911
That way we'll always see what you looked
like right before you turned eight.

277
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,051
Thank you.
Sorry about the mess.

278
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:38,892
So... this is Sunny, huh?

279
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:42,596
Hey there, cutie.

280
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:43,996
Just let me move this.

281
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:46,866
Okay.

282
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:51,036
You wanna have
a seat up here?

283
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,843
Up.

284
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,445
All right.

285
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,448
Ah, oh.

286
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,683
Ohh!

287
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,185
There we go.

288
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,755
Okay.

289
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,467
Like it?

290
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:27,103
Yeah.

291
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,671
Looks great.

292
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:36,645
You wanna get in there?
- Oh, no, it's okay.

293
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:38,913
It's not like I'm gonna
charge you, Angela.

294
00:28:38,915 --> 00:28:39,947
Ah.

295
00:28:43,752 --> 00:28:45,619
All right.

296
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:46,987
Do one, me and you?

297
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:53,226
Think of something
that makes you both happy.

298
00:28:57,064 --> 00:29:00,133
You want one of just you?
- Oh, God, no. No.

299
00:29:00,135 --> 00:29:03,002
Sunny, there's some,
uh, toys out there.

300
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:05,939
Do you wanna play outside
while we finish up?

301
00:29:13,913 --> 00:29:17,516
You know, it's nice,
what you got... you two.

302
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:19,151
Yeah.

303
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:21,253
My sister tried
to adopt a girl.

304
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:23,921
Turned out it wasn't even
the agency's to give.

305
00:29:23,923 --> 00:29:26,757
Louise paid $20.000 for her.

306
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,226
Jesus.

307
00:29:28,228 --> 00:29:30,694
They still never
seen the kid.

308
00:29:30,696 --> 00:29:34,631
It was all in China, so it was a
real mess. Finally just gave up.

309
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,932
I'm sorry.

310
00:29:36,934 --> 00:29:39,835
So you like it here better?

311
00:29:39,837 --> 00:29:41,871
You like taking pictures?
- Oh.

312
00:29:41,873 --> 00:29:44,907
It is a dream come true.

313
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:48,277
Hey, Sunny's got
a birthday party tomorrow.

314
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:50,746
You... You should come by.

315
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:53,081
Of course, I still gotta
get stuff for it.

316
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,683
I could bring some coleslaw
or something.

317
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:57,151
Yeah.

318
00:29:57,153 --> 00:29:59,120
Hey, Sun, you ready to go?

319
00:30:00,022 --> 00:30:02,056
Come on.

320
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:04,626
Hey, you know,
my sister is visiting.

321
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:07,561
Uh, she's gonna come by
if you wanna meet her.

322
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:10,197
Oh, yeah, we should go.
It's late for her.

323
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:13,033
Uh, could I keep one
of the wallets?

324
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:16,770
I mean, I won't take one of
your copies. I'll make a copy.

325
00:30:16,772 --> 00:30:18,872
No, I...
I don't need them all.

326
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,875
You ready to go?
Wanna say good-bye to Max?

327
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:25,544
Good-bye, Max.

328
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:28,947
Okay.
Thank you.

329
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,152
Listen. I gotta run a quick errand.
You wait here for me for a sec?

330
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:36,987
Can I have some gum?
- Honey, I don't have any gum.

331
00:30:36,989 --> 00:30:39,023
Can I go buy some gum?

332
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:40,958
All right.

333
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:45,262
Here. But just gum, all right?
We meet back on this bench.

334
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:47,798
I don't wanna have to go looking
for you. So two minutes, okay?

335
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,966
Okay.

336
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:59,075
Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah.

337
00:30:59,077 --> 00:31:02,745
What's, like, the cheapest I could
get in on a cell phone?

338
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:05,582
The pay-as-you-go phone
would be the least expensive.

339
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,187
This one.

340
00:31:16,024 --> 00:31:17,858
Great.

341
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,595
Um, do I get my own number with this?
- Of course.

342
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:23,363
The phone plus the first
30 minutes is 59.99.

343
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:30,637
Thank you.

344
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:40,879
Hey.

345
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:42,214
Come on.

346
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:50,689
All right, go get in.
I gotta make a call.

347
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:53,124
You got a cell phone?
Can I get one?

348
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:56,628
You can see it in a minute.
Just go... go get in.

349
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:01,633
I know. Listen.

350
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:03,935
If you get me two grand,

351
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:07,370
I won't come after
any of it anymore, okay?

352
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:14,744
I told you already.
I'm gonna invest it.

353
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:17,279
Well, I don't got an account,
so you gotta wire it.

354
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:18,914
No, I'll pick it up.

355
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:24,052
Well, you can call her then.
All right?

356
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:27,055
But don't call this number though.
Call... Call us at home.

357
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:31,292
Are we headed
to the car wash?

358
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:32,994
Yeah.

359
00:32:34,697 --> 00:32:37,197
It's got games on it!
- Yeah, just...

360
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:41,168
Don't...
I just got the thing.

361
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,804
You can play with it later,
all right?

362
00:32:43,806 --> 00:32:47,141
It wouldn't have games on it if
you weren't supposed to play 'em.

363
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,113
Just don't break it, all right?

364
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:55,415
Mm-hmm.

365
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,953
All right, who has the ticket?
- Me!

366
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:03,422
All right, what's the number?

367
00:33:03,424 --> 00:33:05,690
Four, seven, two...

368
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,324
Two... one, six...

369
00:33:07,326 --> 00:33:09,026
one, six... 0.

370
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,395
0.
Enter.

371
00:33:11,397 --> 00:33:12,997
Roll the window up.
Roll the window down.

372
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:15,833
Oh, here we go!
Here we go!

373
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:18,836
Spaghetti!
Look!

374
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:21,271
Here we go.
Here come your pinecones.

375
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:24,708
Here we go.

376
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,110
Whee!
Pinecones!

377
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:29,279
Here they come. Mixing bowl!
We're in the mixing bowl!

378
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:32,716
Rinse. Whoa!

379
00:33:32,718 --> 00:33:33,983
All right, we're gonna get...
- Mom! Mom!

380
00:33:33,985 --> 00:33:35,484
What? What?

381
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:37,453
Oh, we're leaking!
We're leaking!

382
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:40,155
Do it! Do it! Do it!
- I'm gonna do it.

383
00:33:40,157 --> 00:33:42,157
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

384
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,380
Oh, no, no, no!
Don't shut it off!

385
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:10,282
Don't shut it off.
It's wet.

386
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:12,218
No.

387
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,453
Crap.

388
00:34:14,455 --> 00:34:17,957
Come on.

389
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,861
Damn it.

390
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:32,170
It's fine. It's fine.

391
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:34,471
It's not gonna start.
It's not gonna start.

392
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,908
I'll just come back
and get it.

393
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:47,216
At least it's clean, right?
- I guess.

394
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,289
Sunny, go on up ahead.
I gotta make another call.

395
00:34:56,959 --> 00:35:00,061
Uh, yeah. No, I have done
a little, um...

396
00:35:00,997 --> 00:35:02,531
House Helpers.

397
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:05,566
Tonight?

398
00:35:07,803 --> 00:35:11,138
Um, I mean, doesn't somebody gotta,
like, show me around or something first?

399
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,544
Uh... Yeah, no...
No, I can meet her.

400
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,949
No, I actually know
that building. Um...

401
00:35:24,852 --> 00:35:27,020
Yeah, no, I know it.
It's where...

402
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:29,255
I know it.

403
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:31,291
Okay. Thanks.

404
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:34,493
Who was that?

405
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:35,927
Nobody.

406
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,461
Let's take the bus.

407
00:35:37,463 --> 00:35:39,964
Sunny.
- It'll be quick.

408
00:35:45,904 --> 00:35:47,872
You wanna take the bus
the rest of the way?

409
00:36:15,332 --> 00:36:17,032
One way.

410
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:40,920
Hey, Cheryl.

411
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:42,622
Does your kid still
do any babysitting?

412
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,223
I'll go check.

413
00:36:47,928 --> 00:36:50,128
You need a sitter?

414
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,596
Oh, I was looking
for your sister.

415
00:36:51,598 --> 00:36:53,365
She moved out.

416
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,501
Oh, okay. I didn't know that.

417
00:36:56,503 --> 00:37:00,071
I'll watch your kid. I've watched
my cousins. So, you know...

418
00:37:00,073 --> 00:37:03,340
I think I gotta find a girl.
- Really, I can do it.

419
00:37:03,342 --> 00:37:06,277
Just if Sunny wanted
to get at you, and she said...

420
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:08,479
You know, I don't know.
Just... You're a boy.

421
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:11,515
I don't think it's
gonna work out. I'm sorry.

422
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:23,692
Get under the covers?

423
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:28,230
Good.

424
00:37:29,232 --> 00:37:31,400
All right.

425
00:37:31,402 --> 00:37:33,034
Good night, sweetheart.

426
00:38:14,974 --> 00:38:18,642
Hi. I need a cab at the corner
of Trop and Eastern.

427
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:45,768
Listen, can you stop by the
check-cashing place up on Trop...

428
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,736
and just give me a minute?

429
00:38:49,472 --> 00:38:51,740
It's 24 hours.

430
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:53,441
I'll be right out.

431
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:06,652
Hi. I'm-I'm picking up
a wire. Jerome.

432
00:39:12,793 --> 00:39:15,728
You would like that
in money order?

433
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,163
No, cash. Thanks.

434
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,403
Wait. That's supposed
to be 2.000. right?

435
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:28,306
The service fee was $153.

436
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:30,208
He didn't pay that
when he sent it?

437
00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:36,814
Do you do, uh...

438
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:39,050
You do payday loans?

439
00:39:39,052 --> 00:39:41,619
Do you have an account?
- No.

440
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:44,088
Credit card?
- Yeah.

441
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,624
Just give me your card number
and you can apply.

442
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:48,391
For how much?

443
00:39:48,393 --> 00:39:49,659
Um...

444
00:39:53,264 --> 00:39:55,098
I could get 200?

445
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,666
It's 25 per hundred.

446
00:39:57,834 --> 00:39:59,768
Okay.
- Wait one moment.

447
00:40:14,817 --> 00:40:17,517
Thank you for waiting.
I appreciate it.

448
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:30,352
Oh, God.

449
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:40,361
My girl.

450
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,485
I had a bad dream.

451
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,588
It's okay, sweetie.
Just go back to bed, okay?

452
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:16,393
Just think of some
nice things, okay?

453
00:42:16,395 --> 00:42:17,928
Tomorrow's your birthday.

454
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:22,199
Can I sleep with you?

455
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:24,868
Oh, Sunny, please, I got
to go to work tomorrow.

456
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,438
Is someone with you?

457
00:42:30,374 --> 00:42:33,342
Just go think of some nice things,
sweetheart.

458
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:35,810
Balloons.

459
00:42:46,922 --> 00:42:50,457
Hey, thank you
for coming out so early.

460
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:54,895
It's my kid's birthday, so I'm
trying to get the car back for it.

461
00:42:54,897 --> 00:42:56,797
Is this a Triple "A" call?

462
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:59,833
Yeah, yeah. It's my ex-husband's
card though.

463
00:43:01,702 --> 00:43:03,469
What's wrong?

464
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:06,472
Well, they ran it through the wash,
and they turned it off.

465
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:09,709
And the thing don't start up
when it gets wet, so...

466
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:11,944
Can you pop the hood?
- Yeah.

467
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,651
All right.

468
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,658
Thank you. Here, can I...
can I give you something?

469
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,827
No, no.
It's all right.

470
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:31,361
Thank you.

471
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:34,264
Do you want the card?
- No. Don't worry about it.

472
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:43,006
Hey, happy birthday, baby!

473
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:45,507
You got the car back!
- Yeah.

474
00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:47,509
You wanna stay home today,
help me get ready for your party?

475
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:50,345
Really?
- Yeah. Why not?

476
00:43:50,347 --> 00:43:52,381
It's once a year.
Jesus.

477
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:54,049
I'll take it off with you.

478
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:55,817
Okay.
- Okay.

479
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:57,519
Just remind me to call in sick.
- Okay.

480
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:59,388
Go get your coat.

481
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,489
Hurry up!
- I'm hurrying.

482
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:15,835
Baby, don't get...

483
00:44:15,837 --> 00:44:18,038
Don't get crayons
in little packs like that.

484
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,307
I was gonna give them out.
- I know, but I can just get a big box.

485
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:22,908
Put it back.

486
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:26,712
What's this?
- Coconut cups.

487
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:31,983
Sweetie, we've got cups.
- Not coconut cups.

488
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,821
I know.

489
00:44:36,823 --> 00:44:39,557
It's junkie.
You can put it back.

490
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:41,926
They have a balloon machine where
you can make your own balloons.

491
00:44:41,928 --> 00:44:43,027
Yeah?

492
00:44:44,896 --> 00:44:46,830
Oh, yeah.

493
00:44:46,832 --> 00:44:48,398
It's cool.

494
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:53,470
Yeah, but I don't think
we need that.

495
00:44:53,472 --> 00:44:56,506
Why don't you get some regular
balloons and, um, party hats?

496
00:44:56,508 --> 00:44:58,742
Did you get party hats yet?
- No.

497
00:44:58,744 --> 00:45:01,811
You gotta get your party hats, and then...
and then, uh, we gotta go.

498
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:15,356
Okay, that'll be 42.30, please.

499
00:45:31,705 --> 00:45:34,607
It's gonna be a great party.
- Mm-hmm.

500
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:35,975
You're gonna see.

501
00:45:45,084 --> 00:45:46,718
Whew!

502
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:55,861
Sunny, he wants
to talk to you.

503
00:45:57,397 --> 00:45:58,797
It's for your birthday.

504
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:05,902
Hello.

505
00:46:06,771 --> 00:46:08,538
I stayed home today.

506
00:46:10,808 --> 00:46:12,742
We're having a party.

507
00:46:14,978 --> 00:46:16,512
Eight.

508
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:22,851
Mm-hmm.

509
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:27,656
Okay. Bye.

510
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,024
I love you too.

511
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:45,639
Here they all are.

512
00:46:47,508 --> 00:46:48,942
Hi.
- Hey!

513
00:46:48,944 --> 00:46:51,144
Hi, you two. Come on in. Come on in.
Thank you for coming.

514
00:46:51,146 --> 00:46:52,612
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

515
00:46:54,649 --> 00:46:57,183
Hi.

516
00:46:58,919 --> 00:47:01,219
Hi. Ooh! Presents.

517
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:03,555
Yeah, put 'em there.
That's good.

518
00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:07,091
Uh...

519
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,469
Come on.
Let's go outside.

520
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:26,243
Hello.
- Hi.

521
00:47:26,245 --> 00:47:27,845
I'm Louise.
- Michael.

522
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:30,947
Michael. Nice to meet you.
My husband Adam.

523
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:32,181
How you doing?
- Hi.

524
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,017
Hey there.
- Hey.

525
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,752
Pics.

526
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:38,254
Great.

527
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:40,556
I wanted to introduce you
to someone.

528
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:42,525
Who?
- My sister and her husband.

529
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:44,659
They're in town from Toronto,
and I wanted to bring 'em over.

530
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,595
This is, uh, Louise.

531
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,796
Oh.

532
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:52,867
Hi.
- And her husband, Adam.

533
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:53,934
Hi.

534
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,605
Yeah, I love the decorations.

535
00:47:58,607 --> 00:48:00,206
Do you guys need a drink?

536
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,208
No, I'm good.

537
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,878
Okay. You sure you don't...
- No, I'm good.

538
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,713
Yeah. Excuse me. Thanks.

539
00:48:06,715 --> 00:48:08,615
Blow out the candle.
Yeah!

540
00:48:08,617 --> 00:48:11,718
Did you make a wish?
That's for you.

541
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,286
You want cake? Wait. She gets the
first piece. Sorry. I screwed up.

542
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:23,929
Hey, you need
some help with that?

543
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:26,064
I'll show you something.

544
00:48:26,066 --> 00:48:28,866
You put it like this and pop
your fist over on top of it.

545
00:48:28,868 --> 00:48:30,768
Ooh.

546
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,169
There you go.

547
00:48:33,305 --> 00:48:36,007
That's not good
for our counter, okay?

548
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:38,075
Oh. I'm sorry.

549
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:42,145
It's okay.
Say "thank you", sweetheart.

550
00:48:42,147 --> 00:48:44,013
Thank you.

551
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,854
I'm gonna get a beer.
You want one?

552
00:48:51,856 --> 00:48:54,123
Uh, yeah. Sure.

553
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,328
You okay?
- Yeah.

554
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:04,299
Oh, uh, Max, this is my neighbor,
Michael, from upstairs.

555
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:05,767
Hi.

556
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:07,969
How old are you, Michael?
- Sixteen.

557
00:49:09,605 --> 00:49:11,339
I said
he could drink.

558
00:49:13,074 --> 00:49:17,945
You, uh, drive around in one
of those big black S.U.V.s?

559
00:49:18,846 --> 00:49:20,247
I don't got a car.

560
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:27,853
Time.
There's the silent "E."

561
00:49:27,855 --> 00:49:31,057
"There... were...

562
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:35,293
four lit-tle rab-bits...

563
00:49:35,295 --> 00:49:36,728
That's right.

564
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:39,831
in... their"...
- Their.

565
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,199
Sunny, you having fun?

566
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,935
Who gave you that?
- Louise.

567
00:49:44,937 --> 00:49:46,604
It was nothing.

568
00:49:46,606 --> 00:49:48,305
Yeah, it's a nice book.

569
00:49:53,612 --> 00:49:54,979
She really...

570
00:49:56,214 --> 00:49:58,081
She's eight now, right?

571
00:50:02,853 --> 00:50:04,988
I think she could
use a tutor.

572
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:10,960
Hey, Sunny, you wanna come in?
There's one more present for you.

573
00:50:15,298 --> 00:50:17,232
Sunny is really wonderful.

574
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:22,838
I'm happy to watch her for
an afternoon if you need it.

575
00:50:24,841 --> 00:50:26,208
Sure.

576
00:50:28,743 --> 00:50:30,844
Maybe even tomorrow
if you'd like.

577
00:50:30,846 --> 00:50:34,047
I mean, we're only here
for another day or two.

578
00:50:34,049 --> 00:50:36,416
And, uh...

579
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:38,218
You know, I could...

580
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,087
I could do more
reading exercises with her.

581
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:44,957
Yeah, she usually goes to this after-school
thing until I get off work.

582
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:49,395
Well, I could pick her up,
or we could do it here.

583
00:50:49,397 --> 00:50:51,430
I mean, we're staying
at a hotel...

584
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:53,365
You don't have
to pick her up.

585
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:55,134
I can't pay you.

586
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:56,868
Oh. No.

587
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,436
God, I wouldn't...

588
00:51:03,275 --> 00:51:06,110
You wanna do that? Sun?

589
00:51:06,112 --> 00:51:09,147
You wanna meet Louise
to do some reading?

590
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,415
Sure.

591
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:24,894
You have a nice birthday, Sunny?

592
00:51:26,696 --> 00:51:27,796
Uh-huh.

593
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:31,433
A lot of work for me,
you know.

594
00:51:40,176 --> 00:51:42,242
Make sure these gifts
get put away, yeah?

595
00:51:43,378 --> 00:51:45,245
Hey, Sunny,
come here a second.

596
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:46,780
Come here a second.

597
00:51:49,451 --> 00:51:51,819
What's this say?

598
00:51:51,821 --> 00:51:54,221
"Go...
- Yeah?

599
00:51:54,223 --> 00:51:56,255
into...

600
00:51:56,257 --> 00:52:01,427
Don't... Don't go into...

601
00:52:01,429 --> 00:52:08,000
Mr. Membredin"...

602
00:52:12,938 --> 00:52:14,972
That's okay.
That's good.

603
00:52:16,475 --> 00:52:19,810
Here. Just make sure
it goes inside, okay?

604
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,948
Hey.

605
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,416
Come here.

606
00:52:28,486 --> 00:52:30,754
I take you for granted.

607
00:52:33,524 --> 00:52:36,092
Come here.

608
00:53:03,452 --> 00:53:05,051
Hey.

609
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:13,392
Sunny, wake up.
Wake up.

610
00:53:13,394 --> 00:53:16,128
Hey. Sunny.
Where's my white bag?

611
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,097
Huh?
- My white purse, honey!

612
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:20,199
Where is it? This is
really fucking important!

613
00:53:20,201 --> 00:53:22,034
Were you kids
playing around with it?

614
00:53:22,036 --> 00:53:24,336
Sunny, get up and help me find it!
Get up!

615
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:25,937
Okay.

616
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,142
Get up. Are you up?
Are you helping?

617
00:53:42,988 --> 00:53:44,555
Are you looking?

618
00:53:44,557 --> 00:53:47,491
Will you please look?

619
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,497
Yeah, I think some...
I've been robbed.

620
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:58,967
Yeah. $2.000
and the bag that it was in.

621
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,169
Cash.

622
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,571
Okay.

623
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:05,574
That's right.

624
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:11,078
Yes. 1367 Sombrero.

625
00:54:12,848 --> 00:54:15,583
Okay. Well, when?

626
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,352
Yeah.
Thank you.

627
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:22,122
Are you sure you didn't see it?
- No.

628
00:54:22,124 --> 00:54:24,058
Seen anybody with it?

629
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:29,462
I didn't fucking
call into work!

630
00:54:29,464 --> 00:54:31,931
Sunny, damn it! You were
supposed to remind me!

631
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:41,073
Here. Watch some TV
until they get here.

632
00:54:41,075 --> 00:54:42,908
Okay.

633
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,210
Try and think
if you've seen it.

634
00:54:49,115 --> 00:54:51,315
Shit!

635
00:54:53,486 --> 00:54:55,318
All right.
All right, all right, all right.

636
00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:07,230
I was gonna
invest it tomorrow.

637
00:55:07,232 --> 00:55:09,465
It was going
to the office tomorrow.

638
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:12,001
It was gonna be one day.

639
00:55:12,003 --> 00:55:14,970
Did you see anyone with it?
- No, I would've told you.

640
00:55:14,972 --> 00:55:16,939
Do you have insurance?

641
00:55:17,574 --> 00:55:20,175
No.

642
00:55:20,177 --> 00:55:21,577
That your daughter?

643
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:25,179
Yeah. Sunny.

644
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:26,581
Sun.

645
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,186
Did you see anyone
with your mother's purse?

646
00:55:32,188 --> 00:55:36,124
Tell him if you saw it!
I had a lot of money in there, Sunny.

647
00:55:36,126 --> 00:55:38,626
I didn't see it.
- Well, somebody must've fucking taken it, huh?

648
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:41,694
I'm gonna lose it on you if you fucking don't tell me!
- Please. Ma'am.

649
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:48,000
Uh, I don't have the time for this
right now. I gotta go to work.

650
00:55:48,002 --> 00:55:50,236
You work at night?
- It's a new thing.

651
00:55:50,238 --> 00:55:52,405
It's not all night.

652
00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:54,306
Is someone else in the house?

653
00:55:57,476 --> 00:55:59,344
What do you mean?

654
00:55:59,346 --> 00:56:02,280
Is there someone else here to
watch her while you're away?

655
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:04,983
Yeah, somebody's comin'.

656
00:56:05,952 --> 00:56:07,419
When?

657
00:56:07,421 --> 00:56:10,955
I had a sitter, and I just
put her to bed, all right?

658
00:56:10,957 --> 00:56:13,958
She's fine. She's...

659
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,593
It's a couple nights a week,
all right? We got a big dog.

660
00:56:16,595 --> 00:56:20,164
See, I can't leave here knowing you'll
be gone. It's endangerment.

661
00:56:25,303 --> 00:56:29,439
Look, we can take her.
We can take her.

662
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:31,407
There's a children's room
down there.

663
00:56:31,409 --> 00:56:33,309
I'm not supposed to, but...

664
00:56:35,211 --> 00:56:37,446
You can come pick her up
when you're finished.

665
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,589
She's not gonna get any...
She's not gonna get any sleep.

666
00:56:48,591 --> 00:56:50,992
Sunny. Hey.

667
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:53,561
Sunny, come on.

668
00:56:53,563 --> 00:56:56,396
Wake up, sweetie. You gotta go with
these guys for a few minutes.

669
00:56:56,398 --> 00:56:58,765
Okay?
- Why?

670
00:57:00,201 --> 00:57:02,235
Cause', um...
Come on. Sit up.

671
00:57:02,237 --> 00:57:06,039
'Cause I gotta go out, and you
can't be here on your own.

672
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:08,208
Let me see... see your foot.
Okay?

673
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:14,446
I've, uh... I know.
- The tongue's wrong.

674
00:57:14,448 --> 00:57:16,615
Okay. I'll fix it.

675
00:57:16,617 --> 00:57:19,418
Here, take your blanket.

676
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,487
Let's put your coat on.

677
00:57:37,436 --> 00:57:39,035
Okay.

678
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:47,743
Go with this officer.

679
00:57:47,745 --> 00:57:49,345
Thank you.

680
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,608
You're here kind of early.

681
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:24,676
Hi.

682
00:58:24,678 --> 00:58:26,845
Uh, you're here early.

683
00:58:26,847 --> 00:58:29,514
I know. I was, um, just trying
something out.

684
00:58:29,516 --> 00:58:32,517
I was looking for something
part-time. Um...

685
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:35,787
We missed you yesterday. You're staying home
from work, but you're coming in for this?

686
00:58:37,457 --> 00:58:39,723
I know. I meant to call.
It was my kid...

687
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,792
You should get home.

688
00:58:41,794 --> 00:58:45,429
I know. I'm... I'm
about to go home soon.

689
00:58:45,431 --> 00:58:47,364
See you soon.
- Yeah.

690
00:59:28,903 --> 00:59:30,704
Hey, Sun.

691
00:59:36,144 --> 00:59:37,910
Where did you go?

692
00:59:44,284 --> 00:59:46,418
I was just trying
something out.

693
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,354
It was really bright
in there.

694
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,891
Well, we're both
gonna sleep soon.

695
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:08,671
I know your father's
not around, and...

696
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:13,876
I know you'll never
get that back.

697
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,748
But I'm just me, and, uh...

698
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,265
Good morning.

699
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:41,569
How's the new
program coming?

700
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:45,206
It's really a lot easier for me
to just use the big book.

701
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,674
Yeah.

702
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:49,944
Well, we all gotta be on board
on this one, okay? Right?

703
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,545
Yeah.

704
01:00:54,281 --> 01:00:57,816
Did you, uh... Did you manage
to get enough sleep?

705
01:00:57,818 --> 01:01:00,852
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
Um, listen.

706
01:01:00,854 --> 01:01:03,488
You know, today's the day
that... uh...

707
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:05,791
Right.

708
01:01:05,793 --> 01:01:08,960
Listen. I, um...

709
01:01:08,962 --> 01:01:11,896
I had it wired to me,
so I could get you cash.

710
01:01:11,898 --> 01:01:15,299
It doesn't have to
be cash, Angela. No.

711
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:18,669
Well, my kid had a party,

712
01:01:18,671 --> 01:01:22,806
and there were a lot of new people
at the house, and, uh...

713
01:01:22,808 --> 01:01:25,475
I... Somebody...

714
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:27,978
I don't know.
We can't find it.

715
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,314
And, uh, somebody must've stole it.
- You don't have it?

716
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:33,583
Well, I'm still trying
somethin' else.

717
01:01:34,885 --> 01:01:36,785
Why didn't you
tell me this sooner?

718
01:01:37,754 --> 01:01:39,388
I had it.

719
01:01:41,558 --> 01:01:43,525
You know, let's meet
in my office in an hour.

720
01:01:43,527 --> 01:01:45,494
Don't... Don't you have
other people?

721
01:01:45,496 --> 01:01:47,563
Come to my office
in an hour.

722
01:01:53,534 --> 01:01:57,004
Everything all right?
- Did you see my white bag at Sunny's birthday party?

723
01:01:57,006 --> 01:02:00,474
No.
- It had all my back child support in it.

724
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,744
It's gone.
- You should call the police.

725
01:02:03,746 --> 01:02:06,379
I called the fuckin' police.
They can't do anything.

726
01:02:06,381 --> 01:02:09,482
What about that kid upstairs?
- What about him?

727
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:12,285
I'm sorry, Angela.

728
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:13,686
God.

729
01:02:17,658 --> 01:02:22,494
Listen, um, Louise really
enjoyed meeting you.

730
01:02:24,363 --> 01:02:28,633
Uh... Thanks for letting her teach
some today. She misses it.

731
01:02:28,635 --> 01:02:30,435
She fell
for your little girl.

732
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:33,705
Maybe they could, uh...

733
01:02:33,707 --> 01:02:36,440
Maybe Sunny could
visit 'em sometime.

734
01:02:36,442 --> 01:02:38,742
Looks like Ted
wants to see you.

735
01:02:41,912 --> 01:02:43,880
Fine.

736
01:02:45,382 --> 01:02:47,050
Thanks.

737
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,554
I thought you said an hour.

738
01:02:52,556 --> 01:02:54,990
You know what? In the end,
it is just completely inappropriate...

739
01:02:54,992 --> 01:02:58,527
that you're cleaning up this place while
you are an employee of the company.

740
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:00,962
I was just trying somethin' out.
I don't...

741
01:03:00,964 --> 01:03:03,532
I probably...
I don't have to do that.

742
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:05,334
It's like
a couple nights a week.

743
01:03:05,336 --> 01:03:07,902
Don't you think you should get
something that pays better?

744
01:03:07,904 --> 01:03:10,838
A little more steady, so you're not
spread so thin? Especially with your kid.

745
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:16,544
Yeah.
- Yeah.

746
01:03:16,546 --> 01:03:19,347
I mean, we all have to be
with this program right now.

747
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:23,383
This is a custom database, and it just isn't
gonna work if we're not all doing our part.

748
01:03:23,385 --> 01:03:25,919
Yeah.

749
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:29,956
So, with you cleaning up while
you're working, it's just all too...

750
01:03:33,493 --> 01:03:34,893
You know.

751
01:03:36,028 --> 01:03:37,628
Yeah.

752
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:43,968
So look, just, you know,
finish up your calls today.

753
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,970
You can leave early
if you want to.

754
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:49,107
And, um, take this.

755
01:03:49,109 --> 01:03:50,707
Like a severance.

756
01:04:37,718 --> 01:04:39,018
Hello?

757
01:04:39,987 --> 01:04:41,621
Max?

758
01:04:42,823 --> 01:04:44,757
I gave you this number?

759
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,895
No. No, I'm not coming in.

760
01:04:49,897 --> 01:04:52,130
That's it.

761
01:04:52,132 --> 01:04:56,635
It's 'cause that's the end
of my time there.

762
01:04:58,504 --> 01:05:00,906
Uh, 'cause, uh...

763
01:05:00,908 --> 01:05:02,874
Yeah, I don't know why.

764
01:05:07,512 --> 01:05:09,580
Yeah?

765
01:05:09,582 --> 01:05:10,981
Like what?

766
01:05:14,753 --> 01:05:18,221
No. No, I don't wanna meet
Louise for dinner, no.

767
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:23,725
They... They have a good time?

768
01:05:26,095 --> 01:05:29,765
Did... Did Louise have a nice time
today with Sunny?

769
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:32,067
'Cause I haven't
been home yet.

770
01:05:39,908 --> 01:05:41,976
You can drive, right?
- Mmm.

771
01:05:41,978 --> 01:05:44,745
You didn't see my white bag
at Sunny's party, did you?

772
01:05:44,747 --> 01:05:46,647
No.

773
01:05:46,649 --> 01:05:49,950
All right, listen. Wanna
make a hundred bucks?

774
01:05:49,952 --> 01:05:52,719
All I want you to do
is take my car out of town.

775
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:54,688
Just stick it someplace.
- Where?

776
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:58,225
Lake Mead, maybe.
Just hide it.

777
01:05:58,227 --> 01:06:01,661
Do you wanna
do it or not?

778
01:06:01,663 --> 01:06:04,730
Your car that tan LeSabre?
- Yeah.

779
01:06:04,732 --> 01:06:06,866
You gotta pay me now
though.

780
01:06:06,868 --> 01:06:09,535
All right.
Here.

781
01:06:09,537 --> 01:06:11,703
You can't tell anybody about this,
and you gotta keep it clean...

782
01:06:11,705 --> 01:06:14,138
because I'm gonna report it and I'm
gonna get some insurance out of this.

783
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,241
Whoa, whoa. I'm not gonna steal
your car, Angela.

784
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:18,943
I don't want you to steal it. I want you
to take it and stick it somewhere.

785
01:06:18,945 --> 01:06:21,044
What if you report it
and I'm still driving it?

786
01:06:21,046 --> 01:06:24,181
Well, I don't know, you know? I'll wait
for you, you know? You could call me.

787
01:06:24,183 --> 01:06:25,782
Nah, nah.

788
01:06:26,718 --> 01:06:28,118
Fuck it.

789
01:06:30,755 --> 01:06:32,689
It's too late now anyway.

790
01:06:43,568 --> 01:06:45,101
What the fuck
is this now?

791
01:06:45,103 --> 01:06:48,237
We didn't feed Casey.
- You didn't feed him, you mean.

792
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:50,205
You didn't feed Casey!

793
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,912
So what'd you guys do?
Couldn't clean all this up?

794
01:06:56,914 --> 01:06:58,713
It just happened.

795
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,650
We can't keep this dog
like this.

796
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:04,784
Are you gonna help out
or what?

797
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:41,986
Oh, God.
What happened?

798
01:07:41,988 --> 01:07:44,822
Uh... Shut it, Case.
Jesus.

799
01:07:44,824 --> 01:07:48,825
The dog just got
to the couch.

800
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:51,127
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

801
01:07:51,129 --> 01:07:53,797
Hello again, Sunny.
- Hi, Louise.

802
01:07:56,032 --> 01:07:58,300
Can I... What?
- Hi.

803
01:07:58,302 --> 01:08:04,672
Um... Oh, um, Sunny and I
had a wonderful afternoon.

804
01:08:04,674 --> 01:08:06,908
And I just wanted
to make sure that...

805
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:08,843
Um...

806
01:08:09,979 --> 01:08:13,014
C-Can we talk outside?

807
01:08:16,018 --> 01:08:20,220
I... I would love to
see you two again,

808
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:23,790
and I... I wanted
to make sure...

809
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:25,392
that you were
planning to visit.

810
01:08:25,394 --> 01:08:29,029
I mean, I'm inviting you
to visit.

811
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:31,865
It-It would be like
a long vacation.

812
01:08:31,867 --> 01:08:33,966
Um, I have an extra room,

813
01:08:33,968 --> 01:08:37,903
and I know a wonderful
children's therapist.

814
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,373
I, myself,
was a schoolteacher,

815
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:42,875
and...

816
01:08:42,877 --> 01:08:45,645
Sunny needs something more
than she's getting.

817
01:08:56,888 --> 01:09:00,157
Uh, okay. I mean, Max knows
where you guys are,

818
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:03,159
so, uh, I'll talk to him
about it later.

819
01:09:03,161 --> 01:09:05,695
Well, if you tell me when,

820
01:09:05,697 --> 01:09:08,698
I could send tickets.

821
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,833
Okay.
I'll talk to Max.

822
01:09:10,835 --> 01:09:13,403
And I gotta see what kind
of vacation time I got.

823
01:09:13,405 --> 01:09:16,839
It's hard for me
to get away from work.

824
01:09:16,841 --> 01:09:21,309
Well, maybe just Sunny then.
And you could come visit later.

825
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:28,417
I could enroll her in this great intensive
children's program for reading.

826
01:09:30,386 --> 01:09:33,187
She's getting better.

827
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:38,192
And it's really far
for her, you know?

828
01:09:38,194 --> 01:09:41,361
Yeah, but...
- Okay. I can't talk right now.

829
01:09:41,363 --> 01:09:44,230
There's been a robbery
or somethin' here.

830
01:09:44,232 --> 01:09:47,167
And I mean...

831
01:09:49,135 --> 01:09:51,437
Thank you for watching
her today. Thank you.

832
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:54,973
I appreciate it. I really enjoyed
meeting you and your husband.

833
01:09:54,975 --> 01:09:57,376
You seem like nice people.
All right?

834
01:09:57,378 --> 01:09:59,178
Thank you.

835
01:10:06,852 --> 01:10:09,821
Sunny.
Turn that off.

836
01:10:09,823 --> 01:10:13,024
Honey?

837
01:10:13,026 --> 01:10:15,893
Go get Casey's leash
and get your shoes on.

838
01:10:21,332 --> 01:10:23,066
Yo!

839
01:10:24,869 --> 01:10:26,303
200.

840
01:10:27,505 --> 01:10:29,806
Go put Casey
in the car.

841
01:10:31,175 --> 01:10:33,341
I still need the car.
- When you get back.

842
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:38,179
Look, the best thing you can do
is just forget I ever asked.

843
01:10:39,849 --> 01:10:41,916
You're a good kid.

844
01:10:46,088 --> 01:10:47,955
Where are we going?

845
01:10:50,258 --> 01:10:52,459
Just give me a minute, okay?

846
01:11:13,347 --> 01:11:14,947
Come on.

847
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:41,070
Go take him out, sweetie.

848
01:11:43,107 --> 01:11:46,009
Go ahead. Just go and take
him out and tell him to sit,

849
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:49,077
and then come back inside.

850
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:52,981
Honey, look. We're gonna let
Casey go to a new home.

851
01:11:52,983 --> 01:11:54,817
Where?

852
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:57,319
I don't know where,
but somebody will take him.

853
01:11:57,321 --> 01:11:59,254
Okay?
We can't.

854
01:11:59,256 --> 01:12:03,157
I know you don't understand right now,
but you will.

855
01:12:08,297 --> 01:12:10,031
All right, listen.

856
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:11,966
I know it's hard
right now.

857
01:12:13,068 --> 01:12:14,468
But...

858
01:12:16,504 --> 01:12:18,904
It's just hard
right now.

859
01:12:18,906 --> 01:12:20,306
That's all.

860
01:12:23,243 --> 01:12:25,177
So are you gonna
help me or what?

861
01:12:38,891 --> 01:12:41,226
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

862
01:12:41,228 --> 01:12:44,195
Come here.

863
01:12:44,197 --> 01:12:46,496
Listen, Casey, sit.
Come on. Come here.

864
01:12:46,498 --> 01:12:49,533
Come here, buddy.
Come here. Sit. Sit.

865
01:12:49,535 --> 01:12:51,468
Sit, buddy. Come on.

866
01:12:53,471 --> 01:12:55,439
You're a good dog.

867
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:15,457
Sunny?
- Casey!

868
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:17,291
Sunny, shut the door!
- Casey, come here!

869
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:19,126
Sunny! Close the door.
- Casey!

870
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,929
Sunny, shut the goddamn door!
- Casey!

871
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:25,032
He's gonna be okay.
I need some help too!

872
01:13:55,962 --> 01:14:00,065
We're gonna meet Max for some Chinese
food. Won't that be good? Huh?

873
01:14:00,067 --> 01:14:02,632
He's gonna treat us, so you can get
whatever you want.

874
01:14:19,082 --> 01:14:21,016
Do you wanna go eat?

875
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:31,693
Come on.

876
01:14:33,262 --> 01:14:34,696
Hmm?

877
01:14:37,433 --> 01:14:40,635
All right. You can stay in the car
alone if that's what you want.

878
01:14:55,382 --> 01:14:56,983
Hmm.

879
01:14:58,251 --> 01:15:01,019
Hey, you two.
- Hey.

880
01:15:01,021 --> 01:15:03,555
I hope it's okay. I ordered you
something. I didn't know.

881
01:15:03,557 --> 01:15:05,590
I wasn't sure.
- Yeah, yeah. No, that's fine.

882
01:15:05,592 --> 01:15:09,394
That's good. Here.
What is this? Chicken?

883
01:15:09,396 --> 01:15:11,663
Come here, honey.
Make yourself a plate.

884
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:17,735
Fuckin' believe this?

885
01:15:17,737 --> 01:15:20,004
What the hell happened?
Were you sleeping with him?

886
01:15:20,006 --> 01:15:22,039
No. No.

887
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:24,608
It was the money.
I had...

888
01:15:26,678 --> 01:15:28,779
It's not important.

889
01:15:28,781 --> 01:15:31,247
You want me to talk to him?
- And say what?

890
01:15:36,086 --> 01:15:37,587
I lost my other job.

891
01:15:39,089 --> 01:15:42,325
You know, Louise and Adam
are going back tomorrow.

892
01:15:42,327 --> 01:15:45,727
I mean, she refused to leave
before I talked to you.

893
01:15:45,729 --> 01:15:47,261
Yeah, yeah.

894
01:15:47,263 --> 01:15:49,363
I've seen her.

895
01:15:49,365 --> 01:15:51,732
We talked already.

896
01:15:51,734 --> 01:15:55,369
No, they, uh... they wanna
give you some money.

897
01:15:57,239 --> 01:15:59,073
Some real money.

898
01:16:01,442 --> 01:16:03,676
Can we, um...

899
01:16:03,678 --> 01:16:06,046
Can we talk for a second,
you and me?

900
01:16:10,684 --> 01:16:13,386
Hey. Hey, Sunny.

901
01:16:13,388 --> 01:16:15,387
You wanna go check out
the desserts for a minute?

902
01:16:15,389 --> 01:16:16,789
Okay?

903
01:16:19,225 --> 01:16:20,626
Please?

904
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:30,268
It's their adoption money,
Angela.

905
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:33,671
There's $20.000.
and it's yours.

906
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,341
They wanna help Sunny.

907
01:16:42,847 --> 01:16:45,581
What?
No, I mean...

908
01:16:48,318 --> 01:16:51,487
I don't believe it. I mean, uh...
That would really help.

909
01:16:51,489 --> 01:16:55,458
Um... What, do they just have
a lot of money or something?

910
01:16:56,493 --> 01:16:58,627
They wanna help her
as a family.

911
01:16:58,629 --> 01:17:02,263
They wanna help her with who they know,
where they are.

912
01:17:02,265 --> 01:17:03,865
Where are they?

913
01:17:03,867 --> 01:17:07,302
I mean, you'd still be able
to see her and everything.

914
01:17:07,304 --> 01:17:10,171
But they'd wanna
take care of her,

915
01:17:10,173 --> 01:17:12,807
and you're just...
you're just you.

916
01:17:12,809 --> 01:17:14,675
Now, without a job and...

917
01:17:16,744 --> 01:17:19,313
What?
- She wanted me to really talk to you about this.

918
01:17:19,315 --> 01:17:20,881
See if we could
work something out.

919
01:17:20,883 --> 01:17:23,350
It'd have to be clear-cut.

920
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:25,252
They can't go through
another mess.

921
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,357
That's crazy.

922
01:17:37,697 --> 01:17:39,297
Hey, Sunny?

923
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:43,335
Sunny, come on back, honey.
It's okay.

924
01:17:43,337 --> 01:17:45,236
Think about it.

925
01:17:45,238 --> 01:17:47,738
You know what?
I'm not gonna think about it.

926
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,907
It's not even legal.

927
01:17:49,909 --> 01:17:51,475
What's legal?

928
01:17:55,647 --> 01:17:57,715
You're gonna pay
for all this, right?

929
01:17:57,717 --> 01:17:59,415
I don't think
you can smoke in here.

930
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:01,351
I could give a shit.

931
01:18:02,786 --> 01:18:05,722
Call me.
- Jesus.

932
01:18:05,724 --> 01:18:08,558
I'll call you.
- Sweetheart, come on. We gotta go.

933
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,160
I didn't even eat anything!

934
01:18:10,162 --> 01:18:12,195
Louise is a nice person.
All right?

935
01:18:12,197 --> 01:18:13,929
I'm just trying
to help you both.

936
01:18:13,931 --> 01:18:18,534
Hey, can we get a, uh... a to-go
thingy over here, please?

937
01:18:20,503 --> 01:18:22,171
Come on.

938
01:18:25,807 --> 01:18:28,341
Would you be careful,
please!

939
01:18:31,913 --> 01:18:33,847
Didn't we get
you shoes already?

940
01:18:33,849 --> 01:18:35,782
You're gonna kill
yourself in these.

941
01:18:39,687 --> 01:18:42,422
Do you know a place?
- They're all closed.

942
01:18:42,424 --> 01:18:44,490
They're not all closed!

943
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:52,598
All right, here.
Here's a nice place.

944
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,333
We're gonna get you
some things here.

945
01:18:54,335 --> 01:18:56,936
Hey, honey, you want
a little tiger toy?

946
01:19:02,775 --> 01:19:05,310
You need undies?
Hmm?

947
01:19:07,746 --> 01:19:10,481
All right. What about the sneakers?
- They don't have any.

948
01:19:10,483 --> 01:19:13,483
What are you talking about?
They got big bins back here. - Not kids.

949
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:21,591
Excuse me. Do you have any sneakers?
Kids' sneakers?

950
01:19:21,593 --> 01:19:24,327
S. Aqu.

951
01:19:24,329 --> 01:19:29,231
Yeah, no, I saw. But I only saw
slippers and like big men's shoes.

952
01:19:29,233 --> 01:19:33,535
I need kids' sneakers,
for a little girl.

953
01:19:33,537 --> 01:19:34,970
No se.

954
01:19:34,972 --> 01:19:37,572
No, you don't know
or no, you don't have any?

955
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:44,578
Lo siento.

956
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:53,254
Her goddamn shoes
are falling off her feet.

957
01:19:53,256 --> 01:19:54,989
You want her
to go barefoot?

958
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:59,926
Can you try a little bit harder
maybe with some fucking English!

959
01:20:04,565 --> 01:20:05,865
I'm sorry.

960
01:20:13,905 --> 01:20:15,573
What do you wanna do?

961
01:20:17,309 --> 01:20:19,910
I wanna go find Casey.

962
01:20:45,368 --> 01:20:47,469
Honey, I don't even know
where to look.

963
01:20:47,471 --> 01:20:51,507
I... think
it was somewhere here.

964
01:21:09,624 --> 01:21:12,992
Casey!
Come here, boy!

965
01:21:29,575 --> 01:21:32,043
He'll be better off, okay?

966
01:21:32,045 --> 01:21:34,579
Sunny.
Come on.

967
01:21:34,581 --> 01:21:36,881
Casey!
- Get in the car right now.

968
01:21:36,883 --> 01:21:39,017
Or I'm gonna leave
without you. Come on.

969
01:22:09,612 --> 01:22:11,712
Here, honey.

970
01:22:13,482 --> 01:22:15,783
Will you go in and get like a travel
toothbrush or something?

971
01:22:18,053 --> 01:22:20,721
For me, or for you?

972
01:22:20,723 --> 01:22:23,591
Uh, why don't you
get us both one, okay?

973
01:23:46,734 --> 01:23:48,835
I got some toothpaste too.

974
01:23:48,837 --> 01:23:50,236
Good.

975
01:23:53,907 --> 01:23:55,640
You know,

976
01:23:56,843 --> 01:23:59,110
Louise likes you a lot.

977
01:24:02,215 --> 01:24:04,950
Just even after
meeting you a few times.

978
01:24:08,855 --> 01:24:10,955
She knows about how your dad's
not really around...

979
01:24:10,957 --> 01:24:13,691
and how...

980
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:16,994
you need school help.

981
01:24:24,503 --> 01:24:25,902
She's nice.

982
01:24:26,637 --> 01:24:28,571
She is nice.

983
01:24:43,118 --> 01:24:46,287
How would you feel about letting
them help you out for a little while?

984
01:24:48,991 --> 01:24:50,958
Up where they live.

985
01:24:58,733 --> 01:25:00,267
For me.

986
01:25:00,269 --> 01:25:01,868
Okay.

987
01:25:15,615 --> 01:25:17,016
Okay.

988
01:25:50,948 --> 01:25:53,316
Sunny. You stay in the car
a sec, okay?

989
01:25:53,318 --> 01:25:55,250
Can I play
on the phone?

990
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:58,086
Uh, I need the phone
for a minute,

991
01:25:58,088 --> 01:26:00,322
but you can play
with it after.

992
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:08,630
Hey.

993
01:26:08,632 --> 01:26:10,064
Um,

994
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:14,602
why don't we talk more
about, uh,

995
01:26:14,604 --> 01:26:16,903
helping her?

996
01:26:20,107 --> 01:26:22,809
Yeah, I mean,
she said she would,

997
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:25,844
but she doesn't know
what it means.

998
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:29,615
It's not Canadian
money, is it?

999
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:32,951
No, I don't care if they come.
I just don't want to see them.

1000
01:26:35,788 --> 01:26:37,322
I don't know.

1001
01:26:38,891 --> 01:26:42,193
I'm not going home.
That's for sure.

1002
01:26:42,195 --> 01:26:44,862
Look, I'll go to a motel
and I'll call you.

1003
01:26:49,234 --> 01:26:51,002
Back in a second, okay?

1004
01:27:02,647 --> 01:27:04,714
Hey, baby,
we got a room.

1005
01:27:04,716 --> 01:27:06,416
You wanna...
You wanna go on up?

1006
01:27:08,052 --> 01:27:10,318
I'll meet you up there
in a second? Okay?

1007
01:27:12,121 --> 01:27:14,889
Here. It's Room 220.

1008
01:27:14,891 --> 01:27:16,824
Give me the phone back, okay?

1009
01:27:31,272 --> 01:27:34,274
Yeah, I'm at the Ponderosa.

1010
01:27:34,276 --> 01:27:36,877
It's past Decatur.

1011
01:27:36,879 --> 01:27:38,878
It's Room 220.

1012
01:27:41,081 --> 01:27:42,982
You gotta give me
some time though.

1013
01:27:48,455 --> 01:27:50,423
I don't know. Um...

1014
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:54,426
You know what?
Just... Just come.

1015
01:28:19,417 --> 01:28:21,350
What's this, a movie?

1016
01:28:21,352 --> 01:28:23,485
Did you press something we're
gonna have to pay extra for?

1017
01:28:23,487 --> 01:28:25,320
No. Geez!

1018
01:28:40,435 --> 01:28:42,436
Why don't you
go wash your face?

1019
01:28:42,438 --> 01:28:45,072
Why?

1020
01:28:45,074 --> 01:28:47,942
Just go wash up a little
while we're here, you know?

1021
01:29:07,361 --> 01:29:09,060
He's out.

1022
01:29:09,062 --> 01:29:11,162
It's pretty late, Anna.

1023
01:29:11,164 --> 01:29:13,431
He'll be here in a minute.
- Will he?

1024
01:29:13,433 --> 01:29:15,333
Yes, he will.

1025
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:44,026
Where's Louise and them?
- You said you didn't want to see her.

1026
01:29:44,028 --> 01:29:46,995
I know, but where are they?
- They're in the car.

1027
01:29:52,034 --> 01:29:53,801
You want me to come in?

1028
01:29:55,436 --> 01:29:57,204
No.

1029
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:03,043
They give you the money?

1030
01:30:04,813 --> 01:30:06,213
Yeah.

1031
01:30:30,036 --> 01:30:31,570
You gettin' something
out of all this?

1032
01:30:36,042 --> 01:30:39,509
Listen, I'm not doing it here.
- Wait a minute. You said...

1033
01:30:39,511 --> 01:30:43,079
You said to meet here.
- I know, but I can't do it here.

1034
01:30:43,081 --> 01:30:44,480
I'm...

1035
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:48,418
All right. I'm gonna go get Sunny,
and you guys...

1036
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:50,987
you guys just pull up.

1037
01:30:50,989 --> 01:30:54,223
Pull up to the side up a ways.
And you follow me, yeah?

1038
01:30:54,225 --> 01:30:57,059
How do I know
you won't just take off?

1039
01:30:58,094 --> 01:30:59,561
I won't.

1040
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:03,398
Whatever you want.

1041
01:31:11,907 --> 01:31:14,208
Come on, baby.
They're here. Let's go.

1042
01:31:19,514 --> 01:31:21,415
Sunny, come on.
Get your coat.

1043
01:31:36,096 --> 01:31:37,495
Let's go.

1044
01:33:12,351 --> 01:33:13,751
Hey.

1045
01:33:15,419 --> 01:33:16,619
Here.

1046
01:33:18,589 --> 01:33:20,190
So,

1047
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:23,058
listen, they, uh...

1048
01:33:26,296 --> 01:33:30,065
Louise is gonna take you up
to Canada for a while.

1049
01:33:30,067 --> 01:33:32,534
And...

1050
01:33:32,536 --> 01:33:35,671
that's where you'll be taught
better and everything.

1051
01:33:35,673 --> 01:33:38,072
I've never been, so, uh...

1052
01:33:38,707 --> 01:33:41,142
What about my clothes?

1053
01:33:41,144 --> 01:33:43,077
They're gonna have
new things for you.

1054
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:44,479
Toys.

1055
01:33:45,748 --> 01:33:47,482
Books and...

1056
01:33:49,651 --> 01:33:51,651
A little vacation.

1057
01:33:51,653 --> 01:33:53,220
You know?

1058
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:57,424
Come on.

1059
01:33:57,426 --> 01:33:59,659
Come outta the car, okay?

1060
01:33:59,661 --> 01:34:01,495
Let's go see Max.

1061
01:34:17,676 --> 01:34:19,677
Hey there, cutie.

1062
01:34:22,781 --> 01:34:24,748
She'll be okay.

1063
01:34:30,488 --> 01:34:32,389
Help me out a little, huh?

1064
01:34:35,759 --> 01:34:38,461
I'm gonna see you soon.

1065
01:34:38,463 --> 01:34:40,797
I'll come up and see how
you're getting on up there.

1066
01:34:40,799 --> 01:34:43,366
You can call me whenever
you want. Okay?

1067
01:34:43,368 --> 01:34:45,234
Here.

1068
01:34:50,606 --> 01:34:53,475
I'll give you the phone,
like you wanted.

1069
01:34:53,477 --> 01:34:56,611
You want that?

1070
01:35:07,455 --> 01:35:09,322
Go on with Max.

1071
01:35:10,591 --> 01:35:12,425
Go ahead with Max.

1072
01:35:15,129 --> 01:35:17,664
Don't be difficult, Sunny.

1073
01:35:17,666 --> 01:35:19,566
Louise is with him.

1074
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,737
You guys drivin' up?

1075
01:35:25,739 --> 01:35:27,739
I don't know.

1076
01:35:27,741 --> 01:35:30,309
Doesn't she need papers
or somethin'?

1077
01:35:30,311 --> 01:35:31,810
They got all that.

1078
01:35:37,883 --> 01:35:39,450
All right.

1079
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:43,554
Huh?
Go on ahead, okay?

1080
01:35:53,296 --> 01:35:56,132
I'll see you soon!

1081
01:35:57,367 --> 01:35:58,667
Hey.

1082
01:35:59,903 --> 01:36:01,871
Think of me.

1083
01:37:05,629 --> 01:37:07,230
Shit.

1084
01:37:16,373 --> 01:37:18,908
It's, uh... It's fine.
I'll, uh... I'll get it goin'.

1085
01:37:20,443 --> 01:37:22,477
It just needs a minute.

1086
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:25,247
I can call someone.

1087
01:37:25,249 --> 01:37:27,316
I'll get it started.
Just go.

1088
01:37:31,955 --> 01:37:33,555
Okay.

1089
01:37:58,278 --> 01:38:00,379
Come on.

1090
01:38:09,555 --> 01:38:12,457
The car got wet.

1091
01:38:15,461 --> 01:38:18,829
It got wet.
It won't start.

1092
01:38:18,831 --> 01:38:20,731
Oh, God, come here.

1093
01:38:26,471 --> 01:38:28,672
Come here.

1094
01:38:45,321 --> 01:38:47,555
I can take a look
at the car.

1095
01:38:47,557 --> 01:38:49,857
It just needs a minute.
Just go.

1096
01:38:55,730 --> 01:38:58,365
I have to tell Louise...
- Just go!
