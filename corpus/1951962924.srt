1
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:05,517
There it is.
Oh, the first snowflake of the season.

2
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:11,615
Come on, little fella. Come on.
That's it. That's it.

3
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:16,352
You can do it. You're almost here.
You're almost here.

4
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,825
Come on.

5
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:33,443
Technical definition of a snowflake
is ice crystals surrounding a particle of dirt.

6
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,979
lt's buttery, supple.

7
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:45,620
And with a clean finish.
Just like Christmas is supposed to taste.

8
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,286
So, technically, you are eating dirt.

9
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,987
-Could l get one with onions and mustard?
-Sure.

10
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,977
l'm sorry. l'm...

11
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,772
Oh! l'm sorry. Excuse me.

12
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,852
Hey!

13
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,067
A wise man once said,
''The best Christmas present

14
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:39,578
''is a happy family all wrapped up
with each other.''

15
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,079
Or maybe it was a wise woman.

16
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,708
Men don't usually think that clear.
Like this guy.

17
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,912
He ain't had a clear thought
since he left his wife and three kids.

18
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:53,049
He may think he has it all,
but he'll learn different, soon enough.

19
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,028
Now, let's move on from naughty to nice.

20
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:02,528
<i>Meet Benjamin Armstrong.</i>
<i>He writes love songs.</i>

21
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,332
<i>But he has yet to find</i>
<i>that one true love of his own.</i>

22
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,500
Merry Christmas.

23
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,719
Merry Christmas.

24
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:47,674
Did l say nice? l meant real nice.

25
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:54,518
-Want some?
-Oh, a candy cane for me? What? Hey! Hey!

26
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:09,125
Now, over on the fancy side of town
lives Nancy Taylor.

27
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,003
She's nice, too.

28
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,165
As far as money goes,
she don't have a worry in the world.

29
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,267
l tell you what she does fret about,
her three kids.

30
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:25,581
<i>She's on the job 24/7.</i>
<i>Mom and dad, teacher, chauffeur, cook, cop.</i>

31
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,482
Give me that. That was mine.

32
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,181
<i>She's so busy</i>
<i>being everything for everybody,</i>

33
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,417
<i>there's nobody left for her.</i>

34
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,351
Better watch out, girl.

35
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,696
Santa's coming to town.

36
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,800
<i>Next on VH1,</i>
Behind The Music <i>looks at J-Jizzy.</i>

37
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,668
-Mom, come quick. Dad's on TV.
-Yeah, come on.

38
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,505
l know, l know. Your father's always on TV.
But you know what?

39
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,773
He's gonna be here, live in the flesh,
at the front door in the next five minutes,

40
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,677
and you guys aren't even close
to being ready.

41
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,773
-l am.
-Me, too.

42
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,781
<i>-...the scandalous parties...</i>
-Kind of.

43
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,720
<i>-...is that what you want them to think?</i>
<i>-No, actually, that's not</i>

44
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,121
<i>-what I want them to think, Ronique.</i>
-Mom. Come on.

45
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,659
<i>-You see, that's only one side of me.</i>
-One side? Try your only side.

46
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,428
<i>My name may be on a lot of things,</i>

47
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:14,626
<i>-but the music, that's where my heart is at.</i>
-Heart?

48
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,066
<i>-In fact, I've dedicated an entire year...</i>
-What heart?

49
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,297
<i>...to the development</i>
<i>of my new Christmas CD.</i>

50
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,569
<i>You know, that's going to get me</i>
<i>spiritually closer to my fans,</i>

51
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,803
<i>and, of course...</i>

52
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,438
<i>Which camera</i>
<i>are we working with here? Family.</i>

53
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:33,413
<i>But if family's so important,</i>
<i>then why your recent custody problem?</i>

54
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,953
Yeah. How about that? Why?

55
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,149
<i>Ronique, I've been advised not to</i>

56
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,988
<i>comment on matters</i>
<i>currently under adjudication.</i>

57
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,327
-Yeah, especially one's you're gonna lose.
-Mom, you're fighting with the TV again.

58
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,299
-Yeah.
-Yes, l am.

59
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,460
But we want to spend Christmas vacation
with Dad.

60
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,525
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

61
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,164
-Even if he's too busy to be there.
-Shut up.

62
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,574
Well, you can see him tonight,
but he's gonna be here in a hot second

63
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,976
and you guys are not even close
to being ready.

64
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,775
Please, go get your coats on.

65
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,876
-And put some pants on.
-And put on some pants.

66
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,945
-No pants...
<i>-Ain't nothing more precious to me</i>

67
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,583
<i>than my three beautiful children.</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

68
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,303
Come on, guys.

69
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,917
Come on, John-John.

70
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,822
You go ahead.
l'm gonna wait five more minutes.

71
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,122
-Just five more.
-Five minutes.

72
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,202
He's coming. l know he is.

73
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,748
This is all a waste of time.
This is nonsense, man. Every day...

74
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,479
Hold on, hold on, man.
You're always thinking big, man.

75
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,681
You got to think big, not eat big, bro.

76
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,623
Look, we're sitting out here in the cold,
waiting for this herb,

77
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,559
'cause you want to give him a CD?
Come on, man, we got a job.

78
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,617
-Look...
-Let me tell you something.

79
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,097
Once Jizzy hears my stuff, man,
he's gonna vibe to it, just like you did.

80
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,101
l like your songs, even the whack ones,
but this is stupid.

81
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,967
Look, once he hears my music,
he's gonna put me down.

82
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,133
l put you down.
We all gonna come up, all right.

83
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,539
Yo, J! What up?
Looking good, J. What's good?

84
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,179
-You just get off me.
-Deal with you, Jizz.

85
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,154
l got a number one track. l got some
hot tracks right here for you, bro.

86
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:54,056
l got some hot tracks.
l got one right here, baby. Number one.

87
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,167
J-Jizzy, what's up, man?
Ben Armstrong, man, l been calling you.

88
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,997
Check it out, man.
l got some hot tracks right here, man.

89
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,867
A lot of heart in these tracks, right up here.

90
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,270
-l've been doing work...
-You're not sexy, player.

91
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,774
-l know that, but...
-Sexy.

92
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,207
Rottweiler!

93
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,580
You ready to go to work now?
That's my man.

94
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,248
Get off me. Get your Jizzy Gear off me.

95
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,198
Where's my shoe? Where's my shoe?
Zip me up real quick. Did you zip?

96
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,724
-l'm not zipped. My back is showing.
-Are you ready?

97
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:42,900
-Hey, kids, are you ready for Santa?
-Yeah!

98
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,877
All righty. Santa, come out here.

99
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:57,520
-You know, l really should be Santa.
-Santa has to have a lap. You're the elf.

100
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,355
Look over there.

101
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,125
-Okay, so, Mr. Famous didn't call again?
-Unbelievable.

102
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,535
The man will spend $50,000
to fight me in court,

103
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,938
but can't spend three hours with his kids
on his regular night.

104
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,500
Well, if l had to deal with that rotten rapper,
l'd be angry too.

105
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,677
They had three beautiful babies, Brenda.
lt couldn't have been all that bad.

106
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,208
-No, it wasn't all bad.
-Well, l wouldn't know.

107
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,154
Oh, we know you wouldn't know.
At the rate you're going, you'll never know.

108
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,665
Be back in 30 minutes.

109
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,396
-l mean it.
-Look, Mommy, Santa.

110
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,438
Come on, girl,
you can't find a couple of hours

111
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,906
to go to dinner with a nice man?
Even a not-so-nice man.

112
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,840
Take it from us,
there's no shortage of those.

113
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,744
Please, it's not like l'm opposed
to finding someone.

114
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,374
You know, especially someone
who's nice and likes kids

115
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,577
and isn't all about himself, you know?

116
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:04,316
l mean, between John-John's piano lessons
and Emily's ballet and Mikey's football,

117
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,154
how am l supposed to even find the time
to go out on a date?

118
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,319
No, seriously.
You know what l want more than anything?

119
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,454
-What?
-A compliment.

120
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,226
-A compliment?
-Seriously, just a compliment.

121
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,291
-From who?
-Obviously not us.

122
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:20,998
A man. Hello. A nice normal man
who doesn't have an agenda,

123
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,405
who's not trying to hook up
or get busy with me.

124
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,239
You know, imagine this, right?

125
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:30,408
l'm standing in front of a store, a guy
walks by, he sees me, he doubles back

126
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:35,750
and says, ''Wow, you look really amazing.''
And then he leaves. And that's it.

127
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,689
Okay, little girl, you're next. Show time.

128
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,283
-Go and see Santa.
-Who are you?

129
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,797
-l'm Santa's number one elf.
-More like numbers one through 10.

130
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,332
-Nice tights.
-Tell your momma.

131
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,993
-Tell your momma, too.
-Here we go.

132
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:54,062
Ho, ho, ho, little girl.
And what would you like for Christmas?

133
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,164
Besides everything.

134
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:59,575
l don't want anything for me.
Just for my mommy.

135
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:05,174
-Really? What's your name, little girl?
-l'm Emily, and that's my mom.

136
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,479
-Which one is it? The one on the right?
-Yeah.

137
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,658
Santa? Santa?

138
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,362
Yes. Yes. Yes.

139
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,201
See, it's like this. My mommy...

140
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,644
Here, fat boy. l wrote it, you bring it.

141
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,047
Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do that.

142
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,729
Fine. Okay, cool.
Next time you can be Santa.

143
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,100
No. No, no, no, no, no.

144
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,935
Those kids are bad, man.
Little bunch of greedy little kids.

145
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,440
Oh, man, you're telling me.

146
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,741
-See that one kid hit me?
-He hit you with the Holyfield.

147
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,214
And good. Bad kid, man.

148
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:16,513
-Except for this one little girl.
-Yeah, what did she want?

149
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,819
All she wanted was for some dude
to come up to her mother

150
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,757
and just give her a compliment.

151
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,022
Yeah, it seems like her parents split up
a few years back,

152
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,395
and l guess
her mother's been real sad lately.

153
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:32,460
-Was her momma fine?
-Well, you know, l'd have to say,

154
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:38,966
she is probably one of the most
beautiful women l think l've ever seen.

155
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,478
-Yeah.
-That should be easy.

156
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,015
Beautiful people get compliments
all the time.

157
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,983
l should know, l ain't never got one.

158
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,215
Oh, come on, man.
You're gonna find that special somebody.

159
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,157
-You think so?
-Okay, maybe not, but...

160
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,286
Hi, l was wondering
if l could change Emily's ballet class

161
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,650
to the Monday class.

162
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,350
l know l already changed her
from the Tuesday class to the Friday class.

163
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,893
-l was just hoping...
-Mom!

164
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,485
Oh! Yes.

165
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,429
l can't wear this.
lt ain't got one wrinkle on it.

166
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,127
l'm sorry, baby, can you please turn
that music down, John-John?

167
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,463
Mom! Homework.

168
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:42,030
-You need help with your math, baby?
-l think the food is ringing.

169
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,089
Hey, didn't l tell you
to stay out of my room?

170
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,022
l was just playing.

171
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:05,758
-Yeah, with my special toy.
-Yeah, they're all special, aren't they?

172
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,958
-Who wants a story?
-l do!

173
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,933
-l do.
-l don't.

174
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,862
-l don't.
-l still do. A Christmas story.

175
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,101
Okay, Christmas story coming right up.

176
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:22,512
And, Mikey, you just sort of listen,
and, John-John, just cover your ears.

177
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:29,881
-Man, Mom looks old.
-Old people are supposed to look old.

178
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:33,447
Not nasty old. But how's she gonna
get Dad back looking like that?

179
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,050
-l don't think she wants Daddy back.
-Sure, she does.

180
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,653
-She just doesn't know it yet.
-You're crazy.

181
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:42,258
Momma's beautiful,
and a nice man's gonna tell her.

182
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,269
-What man?
-The one Santa's getting her.

183
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:50,001
-Here it comes with the Santa stuff again.
-Come on, guys. Who wants a story?

184
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,574
Okay.

185
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,843
<i>The Twelve Days of Christmas.</i>

186
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,775
So what y'all think?

187
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,514
Sounds like a spiritual.
lt's like an old spiritual, boss.

188
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,618
Oh, yeah.
l'm sure all the saints was thinking,

189
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,460
''Holy, holy, holy,''
with the nasty booty shaking scene.

190
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,898
That's so spiritual. Yeah.

191
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,664
Rottweiler! Not sexy.

192
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,474
Grande cappuccino for Eric.

193
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,181
Well, what's this one about, light skin?
Let me guess.

194
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:47,191
''The love l lost in the rain
in the summertime.''

195
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,524
How about, ''Jamal gets his butt kicked
for not letting me concentrate?''

196
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:55,464
See, that's your problem. You're not writing
songs the consumers want to hear.

197
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,661
We want to hear songs like...

198
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:11,314
-That's what people want to hear.
-Which muffin's mine, man?

199
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,511
None of them. You didn't pay for no muffins.

200
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,555
-Oh, my bad.
-Wait. You're gonna take my muffin?

201
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,559
You sneezed on this one, too. You know
what would be good with that song?

202
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,085
lf you put a... What you looking at, man?

203
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,094
-l think that's her.
-Her who?

204
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,292
The little girl's mother from yesterday.

205
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,358
-That's her.
-Oh, yeah.

206
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,028
lt's the one who wants a compliment.

207
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,006
Give me your jacket. Give me your jacket.

208
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,804
-Give me your shoe.
-Give me your jacket.

209
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:45,479
-What you got in this jacket?
-My businesses.

210
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,191
Man!

211
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,321
There's a stubborn grease stain.
Do you think you can get that out?

212
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,860
Excuse me. Can you put this
with the rest of my stuff?

213
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,339
You are a very attractive woman.

214
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,783
He said attractive?

215
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,621
He said l was attractive.
That's what he said, right?

216
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,786
Okay.

217
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,569
Get out of here. What?

218
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,042
Yeah. A man hits on you and then leaves.
l don't buy it.

219
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,476
Well, it wasn't like
he was trying to sell anything.

220
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,913
He just came in, said what he said,
and then he left.

221
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,417
-What'd he look like?
-Good.

222
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,544
-So let's go and find him.
-No.

223
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,214
Find him? We don't even know him.
How are we going to find him?

224
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,121
Well, how are we gonna know
unless we find him?

225
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,319
Yeah, okay, and then we find him,
then what?

226
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,788
What do you mean
you don't know his name?

227
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,355
-l tell you, he no customer here.
-What about the coat he dropped off?

228
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,401
Smelly, disgusting thing?

229
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,939
Okay, maybe we should be looking
in a bakery.

230
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,497
You guys, we should just go.

231
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,543
-What's wrong, man?
-Nothing. No problem.

232
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,878
Come on, man. l know you, man.
What's wrong?

233
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,078
Nothing. l told you, boss,
the album's good. lt's good.

234
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,450
Good?

235
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,012
Well, you know when l say good,
l mean good in a great way.

236
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,756
lt's got the necessary ''G's.'' lt's got girls,
it's got gangsters, it's got Gucci.

237
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,925
-Yeah, but what don't it got?
-J, it just don't have no heart.

238
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,835
No heart? Come on, man!
l know every song on the record, okay?

239
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:50,840
<i>Black Christmas. Three Thugs.</i>
<i>I Got Doodoo On My Shoe.</i> Come on.

240
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,878
-Yeah, yeah, fabulous. Each and every one.
-But?

241
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:57,972
But we still one song short, J.
We want Christmas in the air,

242
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,075
fabulous brotherly love,

243
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:04,452
the jingle... The spirit song.
We that song short.

244
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,253
Remember this?
Can't stop, won't stop. Huh?

245
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,487
-Can't stop, won't stop!
-Yes.

246
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,290
Okay? Can't stop...

247
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,603
A Christmas song short. l can do that.

248
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:27,507
-That was a really good dinner, Momma.
-Yeah, what's up with that?

249
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,547
Well, if you guys like what l did for dinner,

250
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,673
just wait till you see
what l made for dessert.

251
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,617
-Made?
-Dessert.

252
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,780
-What's her problem?
-She looks happy.

253
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,622
-She is happy, and l know why.
-Yeah? Why?

254
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,390
'Cause l asked Santa to give her
her wish, and he did.

255
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:49,560
How many times do l have to tell you?
Santa does not give wishes.

256
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:54,833
-That's genies, stupid.
-He does give wishes, and you're stupid.

257
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,467
Hey, hey, hey, you three.
l don't want to hear any of that.

258
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,704
But, Momma, he started it.

259
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,875
l will not cut into this cake
until l feel some love in this room.

260
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,414
-There we go.
-Hey, all my peeps.

261
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,423
-And there it went.
-Daddy!

262
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:17,326
-Look at all my shorties!
-You're supposed to call first, James.

263
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,591
That's me calling, right now.

264
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:26,327
Hello? Yeah, Kim, he's right here.
Thanks so much for the heads up.

265
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,571
Hey, well, you know, l was in the vicinity,

266
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:34,874
and l knew you wouldn't mind me
dropping this off personally.

267
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:39,815
Oh, you know, l'd like it a lot better
in the mail. You can just set it on the table.

268
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,184
Hey, l ain't missed nobody's birthday
or nothing, did l?

269
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,952
Nope. Mom just made it
because she's a really great mom

270
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,994
and she makes things.
You want to stay for dessert?

271
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:54,828
No, l can't do that. No dessert for me.
Actually, my dessert's out in the car.

272
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,068
Well, thanks for the check, James.

273
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,297
Daddy, wait. Guess what happened today.

274
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,571
A man saw Mommy
and said she looked nice.

275
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:09,045
-ls that so? Your mommy does look nice.
-Yep.

276
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,639
Yeah. And at these prices,

277
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:15,015
your mommy could be looking
a whole lot better.

278
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:19,045
l mean, your mommy got a lot of paper.
Your mommy got so much paper,

279
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,321
when she walk down the street,
trees get scared.

280
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:32,231
We checked all of them.
Body shop, butcher shop, camera shop.

281
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,171
Pet shop, grocery store,
Korean grocery store.

282
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,176
-Got it, got it.
-That's a pretty dress, Mommy.

283
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:43,010
-Oh, that's no dress, sugar. That's paint.
-Don't corrupt that child.

284
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,105
Oh, hush.

285
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,548
Anyway, since it doesn't seem
like he works anywhere,

286
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,087
we think
maybe he was in the Starbucks next door.

287
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:54,751
-How was he acting? Caffeinated?
-l don't know. Maybe.

288
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,384
That's it then. l'll take the first shift.

289
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,122
You're kidding.
We're gonna stake out a Starbucks?

290
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,289
Well, they have better coffee
than the body shop.

291
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,856
-You want to find him, don't you?
-Well, yeah, but...

292
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:06,734
-All you've been thinking about?
-Yes.

293
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:11,072
l know. Yes, l want to see him.
l would love to see him.

294
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,805
-Mommy, l got to go.
-Emily, you just went.

295
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,077
No, not to the bathroom. There.

296
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,920
-So, the mom wants to take you out?
-Yeah.

297
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,989
-lsn't that what you want? She's beautiful.
-Yeah, she's beautiful.

298
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,058
-So what's wrong?
-This. This is what's wrong.

299
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,202
See, l don't know that she wants to meet me.

300
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:47,177
So, if l did meet her, me, as Benjamin,
if l met her, that would be a lie.

301
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,079
-But Santa...
-Santa?

302
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:55,881
-Santa knows that she wants to meet me.
-Like Santa knows, he's watching, knows?

303
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:59,753
No, no. Santa... Santa knows...

304
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,554
-Oh! Right.
-...that she wants to meet me.

305
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,960
lf l did that, then l would be exploiting
the confidential information

306
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,329
for personal gain, and that's not cool.

307
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,496
-What?
-lt's the betrayal of the Santa trust, man.

308
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,769
Come on, man! Look, that would be true
if you were a doctor or something.

309
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,708
But you work in a mall, dawg, part time.

310
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,772
How about this? l meet her out once. Right?

311
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,715
Maybe at a coffee shop
or somewhere, right?

312
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,515
And l'll step to her
and l'll make something up.

313
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,149
Make something like,
''Yeah, baby, l'm from out of town,

314
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,455
''and l sell office supplies.''
Something like that.

315
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,894
Right? 'Cause it's boring.
See, office supplies, that's boring,

316
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,627
and chicks don't dig that boring stuff, right?
You hear me on that, right?

317
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,829
Yeah, the office. Salt, can l get some salt?

318
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:52,334
You see, that way it's twofold,
because, as Santa, l fulfill my obligation.

319
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,379
But technically,
l don't betray the child's trust.

320
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,577
And that's what's important.
Obligation and trust go together.

321
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,050
-Let me ask you a question.
-Got it.

322
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,485
Say a little snot-nose kid
like the one, you know?

323
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:08,458
What if he came to you,
''You know, Santa, l stole a Escalade.

324
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:14,226
''l need you to get me some rims,
some spinning rims.''

325
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,097
Does that betray
the whole Santa trust thing?

326
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:23,038
Okay, but why would a child come up to me
and say he stole an Escalade? l don't...

327
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,339
Because you work in a mall, dawg,
part time!

328
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,378
That's why you ain't Santa.

329
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,851
You know what? Look, l'm leaving.

330
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,083
We've been sitting here like ninnies for,
what, an hour?

331
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:43,389
And for what? l may be a housewife,
but l'm not that desperate. l'm leaving.

332
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,897
Okay, okay, okay.
Your next one is definitely decaf.

333
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,798
lt's crazy that we're sitting here
like Starbucks stalkers.

334
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:54,032
They're gonna name a drink after us,
the Crazy Lady Lattes.

335
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,171
Wait a minute.

336
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:08,574
-Why did we come here?
-l'm gonna pick up my jacket.

337
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,178
And they better not have cleaned it.

338
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,887
-Hurry up, man.
-Yeah.

339
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:23,623
-Hey, look. 1 2 o'clock.
-That's not him.

340
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,661
Yeah, but he's big.
You know, like the jacket big?

341
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,215
-He's got a friend. Guys.
-Oh, my God.

342
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,120
-Oh, my God, it's him.
-Oh, God, he's gorgeous.

343
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,590
-Do you think he's coming in here?
-He ain't moving.

344
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,092
Oh, God, please don't come in here.

345
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,287
Okay, how about l go next door
and bump into his friend, yeah?

346
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,557
No, no, l'll go. lt'll be less obvious.

347
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,223
-No, no, neither.
-Less obvious?

348
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,235
<i>-Titanic</i> meet iceberg.
-Oh, you want to throw it out?

349
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,702
-What does that mean?
-Oh, whatever.

350
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,432
-Got to go find your man.
-No. No.

351
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,200
What did you do with the stuff
that was in the pockets?

352
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,765
l use it to scare away rats.

353
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,573
-You're the guy with the guy?
-What?

354
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,512
The good-looking guy in the car. What's
his name? What's he do? What's he make?

355
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,517
My friend wants to meet him.

356
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:18,420
-By the way, l'm Brenda.
-l'm Jamal.

357
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,890
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

358
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,984
Nice to meet you, too. Oh, the guy.

359
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,425
-Girl.
-l know.

360
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,300
Oh. Oh, get ready, girl.
Here he comes. Here he comes.

361
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,895
No, no.

362
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,614
-There. That guy, right there.
-My man?

363
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,819
Hey, hey! You, chocolate love! Come back.

364
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,249
-Hey.
-Hi. Again.

365
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,581
Yeah.

366
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,750
-From the cleaners, right?
-Yeah, right, right, from the cleaners.

367
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,518
-So, you're buying sweets?
-Sweets? Oh, yeah!

368
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,928
Yeah, l'm getting some sweets.

369
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:39,766
-Sweets for your sweetheart?
-No. No, l don't have a sweetheart.

370
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:46,670
-You?
-No, no, no. Totally free. Single.

371
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,438
-Right.
-Yeah.

372
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,744
-Cool, cool, yeah. So...
-So...

373
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,579
So, you know, l'm from out of town.
l was just walking by.

374
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:03,423
l had a little craving
for some petit fruit jelly beans, you know,

375
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,485
so l just came on in, you know.

376
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:09,294
l sell office supplies,
and it gets kind of boring, you know.

377
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,497
What about you?

378
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:15,096
l'm from town.
Single mother with three kids.

379
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,275
-And l just bought a stapler.
-That's good. That's good.

380
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:25,373
-Well, so if you ever need anything...
-l'm sure l'll need whatever you have.

381
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,509
By way of office supplies.

382
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,784
-l guess, you know, paper clips, pens...
-Pens. So many pens.

383
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,292
You know, 'cause l'll be,
''Oh my God, l need a pen.''

384
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,886
-You need some pens?
-l need a pen, and l don't have a pen.

385
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:42,592
-But you have pens.
-Then l'm your guy.

386
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,569
-Benjamin Armstrong.
-Nancy. Will you go out with me?

387
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,375
-l'd love to.
-Great.

388
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,589
l'm not cleaning that up.

389
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:44,118
-You look fabulous.
-Okay. Work it, work it.

390
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:48,798
-Pop them collars.
-Yeah. Oh, and your purse, darling.

391
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,629
-Thank you.
-Bye, Mom.

392
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,397
Remember to have fun.

393
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:25,660
Wow!

394
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,477
Hey, there. That's real nice,
but you know what's missing there?

395
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,749
-What's that?
-The mohair swatch. Where's the mohair?

396
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:22,190
-l told you, mohair.
-Mohair, done.

397
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,061
J-Jizz. J-Jizzy? Hello? Hello?

398
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:32,765
Hey, boss,
what about your Christmas album?

399
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,565
Come on, man, you sweating me again?
Christmas album.

400
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,869
Look, we gonna use the song right there.

401
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:41,435
-What? <i>I Love Ho-Ho-Hoes?</i> Or the one...
-No, no, no. The one right there. Yeah.

402
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,003
That's the one we're using. Yeah, that one.

403
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:49,281
Let me see if l got this right. We're using
<i>I Saw Mommy Capping Santa Claus?</i>

404
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:53,119
-That's...
-Yeah, what's wrong with that, huh?

405
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,126
Hey, you know what, Delicious?
l've been watching you lately, man.

406
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,253
You've been stressing a lot
about this Christmas album.

407
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,557
l'm gonna tell you something, man.

408
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,326
You gonna mess around
and give yourself an ulcer.

409
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,198
You want to spend the rest of your days
drinking buttermilk?

410
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,499
-lt could be gas.
-No more drinks. None of that.

411
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,405
Just buttermilk, buttermilk, buttermilk.

412
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,569
Me? l got to worry
about my spring line right here

413
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:18,581
that's missing the mohair swatch
like l asked for. Mohair.

414
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,480
Just keep on stressing yourself out.

415
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,985
-Don't stress.
-Yeah.

416
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:32,560
That was not sexy. That was karate.

417
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,898
-John-John, hurry up and get dressed.
-l am dressed.

418
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,803
Your pants are on the bed.
Put them on or you don't eat.

419
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:45,400
Fine. l don't want to eat with that guy.
l don't want to meet him.

420
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,446
-l don't want to be on the same planet.
-l hear Pluto's nice.

421
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,775
Shut up.

422
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:54,350
-How do l look?
-Bootylicious.

423
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,578
-Yeah?
-Yeah, Momma.

424
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,779
Okay.

425
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,184
-Beautiful flowers for a beautiful woman.
-Thank you.

426
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,388
This is for you.

427
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,591
-l'm Mikey.
-lt's a pleasure to meet you, Mikey.

428
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:15,305
-And this little princess must be Emily.
-l'm not a real princess. Just for pretend.

429
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,103
Pretend? Well, you could have fooled me.

430
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:24,142
-And this must be the man of the house.
-So you're him, huh?

431
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,810
Mom, is this the best you could do?

432
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:32,618
Actually, it's not the best she could do.
l'm sure she can do a lot better.

433
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,420
But me, l'm on cloud nine.

434
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,724
Why don't l show you around
the rest of the house?

435
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,808
-You guys tired?
-Yes.

436
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,316
-No.
-l mean, no.

437
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,717
-Did you guys have fun today?
-Yeah.

438
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,687
No.

439
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,487
-Well, Benjamin liked you guys a lot.
-Does Dad know about him?

440
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,255
-No. He doesn't.
-Why not?

441
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,197
Because your dad and l lead different lives,
and we can do what we want.

442
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:55,570
-So why are you afraid to tell him?
-l'm not afraid. l just...

443
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,973
Well, l wanted to make sure
this was getting serious

444
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,671
before l said anything.

445
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:05,842
-ls it?
-Yeah, l think maybe it is.

446
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,286
You want to talk about this?

447
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:24,699
Okay, well, let me know
if you change your mind, okay?

448
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,975
You got us into this mess.
You're gonna get us out.

449
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:43,447
An eyeglass holder and a telescope
and a laptop.

450
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,285
A VideoNow...

451
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,848
You go tell that big red rat what l told you.

452
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,861
-Santa's not a rat.
-Yeah, whatever.

453
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:55,023
-Thanks. Bye.
-Where are you going? Hey! Hey.

454
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,657
Don't you want, like, a baseball glove?
Or a friend?

455
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:58,861
-You want a friend, right?
-l don't play sports,

456
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,871
and you're kind of starting to creep me out.

457
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:08,678
-And what's your name little girl?
-You know me. l'm Emily.

458
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:12,614
Oh, Emily.
Emily, the little girl who wants a bike, right?

459
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,346
No, the girl who asked you
to send a nice man to her mommy.

460
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,253
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, l remember.

461
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:23,783
And how is that working out?
Does Mommy want another color?

462
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:28,423
No, she likes him fine.
lt's my brother. He hates him.

463
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,463
-Yeah? Which one?
-John-John.

464
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,029
And how did you know l have two brothers?

465
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:41,408
Well, Santa knows all the brothers,
sweetheart. He knows all the brothers.

466
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,743
John-John says you got to get rid of him.

467
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:47,841
'Cause if you don't,
he's gonna give him the treatment.

468
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:52,378
-And what might that be?
-See, tomorrow we're going bowling.

469
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,983
And John-John says,
if Benjamin shows his face, he's gonna...

470
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:22,479
Sweetie, it's okay. lt's okay. You know,
we're this close to a strike, okay?

471
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,852
You'll get it next time. All right?
There we go.

472
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:32,556
-John-John, you're up.
-That's right. Come on, John-John.

473
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,703
So, everything's all good, right?

474
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:48,643
Nancy, she's great.
Everything l ever wanted.

475
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:52,170
Well, don't sound so excited, light skin,
but they're looking at us.

476
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,945
-Hey!
-Hey!

477
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,280
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

478
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:02,621
lt's crazy, though. l've always dated
these creative types my whole life.

479
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,558
-For better or worse.
-l'm not doing the Santa thing

480
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,119
and spying on her kids.

481
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,059
l'm lying to her face

482
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,195
about being some regular dude
selling office supplies.

483
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,707
And out of the blue, here comes this sweet,
straight-arrow of a guy

484
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:22,906
and l can't stop thinking about him.
l could really fall for him.

485
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,915
l done told Brenda so many lies,
l'm starting to believe them.

486
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,043
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

487
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,919
Just 'cause l got to lie,
that don't mean you got to lie.

488
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,583
Well, what do you think?
That you're executive

489
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,890
and you can hang out with an elf?

490
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:46,196
Right. Right.
Okay, so what exactly is your job?

491
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,003
A bounty hunter? Really?

492
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,838
-He just doesn't seem the type.
-That's what l said.

493
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,743
But then he scooped me up
in his big gummi-bear arms,

494
00:41:55,813 --> 00:42:01,911
and he said, ''But l found you, didn't l?''
And l just... l just melted.

495
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:07,784
Oh, my goodness. That is so sweet.
And l see he inspired the new hairdo.

496
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,224
Let's not tell him it's not all real.

497
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,628
l could just kill him.
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

498
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,927
l think Benjamin's nice.

499
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,595
Well, l think he stinks.
Same as your buddy Santa Claus.

500
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,570
Hey, you take that back.

501
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,370
Why? He dumps that punk on us,
then won't get rid of him.

502
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:29,936
That's it. The treatment,
it starts right here, right now.

503
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:04,539
You know, l just don't get it.
Do you get it? 'Cause l don't.

504
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:08,442
-Maybe he's just better than you.
-Nobody is that good.

505
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:12,312
He knows everything.
Benjamin ain't better than me.

506
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,917
You ain't giving him no inside information,
are you?

507
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,685
What's inside information?

508
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,887
lt's important stuff that's just between us,
me and you.

509
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:29,125
l don't tell anybody anything. Except...

510
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,966
-Except who?
-Santa. He gives me anything l want.

511
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,303
Santa?

512
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,138
-Santa's real, John-John.
-No, he's not.

513
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,234
-Yes, he is.
-Yes, he is.

514
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,869
No, he ain't!

515
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:46,211
Go to the mall for yourself and see.
He's there.

516
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:52,150
Step up, step up. Come on, come on.

517
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,190
Man, you're one big elf.

518
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:00,560
Come on. Here we go. Here we go. All right.

519
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,031
So what's your name, little...
l mean, young man.

520
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,399
Save it, okay?
l need you to get rid of somebody for me.

521
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,131
Santa doesn't like the sound of that.

522
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,935
l know you sent that Benjamin guy
'cause of my sister.

523
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:12,737
But now he just won't leave.

524
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,869
And my mom's just too nice
to tell him to buzz off.

525
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,640
Well, what would you like Santa to do?

526
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,241
You must have another hard up mother
somewhere. Give her Benjamin.

527
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,581
Well, Santa doesn't normally
do returns, son.

528
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:26,282
But give him time to think about it.

529
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,382
Well, think fast,
'cause l really, really want this guy gone.

530
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,190
-l'll think about it, young man.
-Thanks.

531
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,394
l'm all right. l'm all right.

532
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,187
Good evening, sir.

533
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:19,467
-Notice anything different?
-No.

534
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,711
Are you sure?

535
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,711
You hear that? lt's nothing.

536
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:31,821
Silence. The kids are at Robin's.

537
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:35,689
Okay. Yeah.

538
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:40,788
No. l mean, you know, it's just...

539
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,927
-What's wrong?
-l don't know, it's just us.

540
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:51,200
You are amazing. John-John, he hates me.

541
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,904
-He does not hate you.
-Trust me. He hates me.

542
00:46:54,978 --> 00:47:00,143
He is a kid. He also hates homework
and broccoli and a lot of other things.

543
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:04,483
Exactly, and l'm the big green
leafy vegetable of boyfriends.

544
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:09,058
-Did he say something to you?
-No, not to me directly.

545
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:17,194
You should talk to him. Just tell him that
you want to be a part of his life.

546
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,061
All our lives.

547
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:35,549
Okay, deuce to seven lowball.
Aces and straights count as high.

548
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:39,020
How can you all sit here and play
this stupid game like nothing's happening?

549
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:42,581
-'Cause some of us needs the money.
-Yeah, right.

550
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,719
Don't you get it? They're alone right now.

551
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,730
-So?
-So?

552
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:51,062
Stuff might happen.
Then we'll never get rid of that punk.

553
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:56,037
-What sort of stuff? Like kissing?
-Don't even say that.

554
00:47:56,106 --> 00:48:00,133
Sweetie, he's a good man.
Your momma could do a lot worse.

555
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,202
l don't care how nice he is. He ain't my dad.

556
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:09,676
l'll take two. No, no, three. No, no, no, two.

557
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,347
-Benjamin?
-Benjamin?

558
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:15,050
Just the man l wanted to see.

559
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,059
My mom put you up to this, right?

560
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:29,128
l mean, you two are hooking up
no matter what l think,

561
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,642
so buy the kid a pretzel.
Maybe that'll shut him up.

562
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,734
Okay, first of all,
your mother didn't put me up to this.

563
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,939
-All right? And nothing's been decided.
-Yeah, right.

564
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,643
Did you want salt or do you want the plain?

565
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,345
-Man.
-lt's a joke. lt's a joke.

566
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,884
What is that horrible sound?

567
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,756
l can play better than him.

568
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,521
You're talking about him
on the keyboard over there?

569
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,654
-Yeah.
-You can play the keyboard?

570
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,788
Yes.

571
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,599
-Hold on one second.
-Wait, where are you going?

572
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:10,377
John-John.

573
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,420
Okay, sit down. Show me what you got.

574
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,055
All right, l will.

575
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,596
Okay, just concentrate. You got it.

576
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,103
There you go, all right.

577
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:54,120
There you go, there you go. All right.

578
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:01,387
-That's it. See?
-Yeah.

579
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,972
See? See?

580
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,341
That's the focus right there.
That's what l'm talking about.

581
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:28,157
Now, l want you to just give me two.
Just like ding, ding. Here we go.

582
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,716
There you go. That's it. That's it.

583
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,428
That's it. There you go.

584
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,834
See? They love it. They love it.
This is the keyboard, give me five. Like this.

585
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:48,537
Then you go keyboard. Tickle the keys.
Tickle the keys. There you go. Like that.

586
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,945
That's the keyboard five.
Give me the keyboard five.

587
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:56,283
No. No, l'm ready to go home.

588
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:59,117
No, come on, let's do it one more time.
Just one more time.

589
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:03,853
John-John, come on. We're just gonna do
it one more time, then we'll go. John-John.

590
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,328
You know, we're gonna go ahead
and lock this up now.

591
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,833
Jizzy, the album is not ready yet.

592
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,635
-Not ready?
-No.

593
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:19,698
Have you seen the cover art on this?
That cover art is cold, man.

594
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:23,837
This CD would sell
with no music on the album.

595
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,077
You know why?
Because my picture is on the cover.

596
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,452
Well, let's lock it up. Excuse me. l'm allergic

597
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,580
to stuff that don't make sense, Jizzy.
The album is not ready.

598
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:36,091
-Oh, yeah.
-Come on, you're killing me here.

599
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,559
We need a song, Jizzy. A song.

600
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:43,361
Okay, l know it could sell blank,
but people don't sell blank CDs, okay?

601
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:48,800
l tell you what.
Whatever is on this disk goes on the album.

602
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:52,467
All right. Whatever you say, boss.
lt's not a big deal.

603
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,739
lt's just our careers
and reputations on the line.

604
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:58,042
Whatever's on this, that's...

605
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,117
lt's just your album, man. There you go.

606
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,744
That's what your new album sounds like.

607
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:44,818
lt just needs a harp or something.

608
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:55,329
-Can't stop.
-Won't stop. Yeah. Yes.

609
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,177
Hey. So, are they asleep?

610
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:07,706
Out like a light, every last one of them.
So, how did it go with John-John?

611
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,552
-Yeah, yeah. lt went cool. lt was cool.
-Yeah? Really?

612
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,453
Yeah, it was real cool for about 30 seconds.

613
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,959
-Momma, l need water.
-Coming, baby.

614
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,819
-Don't go anywhere.
-Don't you worry about it.

615
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,699
l will not go anywhere.

616
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,573
-Hello.
-Hello, Benjamin Armstrong?

617
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,080
<i>-Yeah, who's this?</i>
-l been listening to your CD.

618
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,707
l'm kind of feeling it, you know.
l was wondering

619
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:44,185
-if me and you could do some business.
-Okay.

620
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,381
<i>You know who this is, right?</i>

621
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,726
Yeah, l think this is the call
l've been waiting for my entire life.

622
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,357
That's right.
The call you've been waiting for all your life.

623
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,424
Yes. Halle Berry.

624
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:03,500
<i>The call from the number one</i>
<i>record producer in the world.</i>

625
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:08,567
None other than J-Jizzy.
Can't stop, won't stop. That's right.

626
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:13,881
Now, what l want you to do is tomorrow,
2:30 sharp, me and you, breakfast.

627
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:17,042
Cool. Cool. l'm there at 2:30. Yes!

628
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,450
Yes! l got the...

629
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,013
-Hey! Baby, baby.
-What happened?

630
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,026
-l just...
-Oh, my God.

631
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,755
l just sold my...

632
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:32,426
My catalog.
l just sold my whole catalog of pens.

633
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,801
-Wow.
-That's great.

634
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,870
The garlic from dinner. l'm so sorry.
l'm gonna go brush my teeth.

635
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,107
-Tell Robin l'll call her in the morning.
-All right, cool.

636
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,411
Robin, what's up?
She says she'll call you tomorrow.

637
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,049
-Who's this?
-Who's this?

638
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,288
Didn't l just finish talking to you
on the phone?

639
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,689
-Hey, who was on the phone?
-He said J-Jizzy.

640
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,895
Did you enter some type of contest
or something?

641
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:12,032
More like l lost one.

642
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:15,635
-lt's my ex-husband.
-Your... Your...

643
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,206
Ex-husband. Yes.

644
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:25,844
l'm sorry. Yes, J.

645
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:29,085
May l ask who was that
that just answered the phone?

646
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,559
Nobody. What is it?

647
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:35,428
What is it? Well, our son,
John-John, just called me up.

648
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,056
He sounded very weird on the phone.

649
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:41,092
Well, if you talked to your son every once
in a while, he wouldn't sound so strange.

650
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,502
<i>Goodbye, J.</i>

651
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,964
Sorry.

652
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:49,237
Have a dude answer the phone.
Try to get me jealous.

653
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,639
-That's my ex-husband.
-J-Jizzy is your ex-husband.

654
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:55,845
-Yeah.
-So that means he's the pops, he's...

655
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:58,410
-He's John-John's pops.
-Yeah.

656
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,821
-And Emily and Mikey, too. So what?
-All three, the whole...

657
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,916
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
lt has nothing to do with us.

658
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:06,757
-Right. No, baby, l know. lt sure doesn't.
-l know. l know.

659
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,094
-lt doesn't. lt doesn't. lt doesn't.
-Wait.

660
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,001
l can't believe l just said that
and actually meant it.

661
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:16,505
You know, l've been lying to myself,
you know, for years, saying,

662
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:20,532
he doesn't have this hold on me.
Just lying, lying, lying, you know?

663
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,271
He was preventing me
from actually having a life.

664
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:23,642
-And then you.
-Me.

665
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:27,114
You. You. You set me free.

666
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,352
-No problem. You're welcome.
-Wait.

667
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,615
What? What, are you leaving?

668
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,858
l'm sorry. l thought you were finished.
You weren't finished?

669
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:41,090
l was finished, but l...

670
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:45,225
The kids are asleep,
and l was thinking that...

671
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:51,535
Yeah. You know what?
l'm sorry, but l'm going to call you.

672
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,508
l'm going to call you.
By the way, the whole speech,

673
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:57,774
it really hit right here. The game is free,
the free thing, it's...

674
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,246
Well, l...

675
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:04,648
Benjamin. l was... Hello. Wow.

676
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:16,928
Yo, man, you are not gonna believe
what happened.

677
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,663
l'm over at Nancy's house, right? My cell
phone rings out the blue. Guess who it is?

678
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,864
J-Jizzy! He wants to buy my song.

679
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,531
-That's good.
-Yeah, that's good, that's good.

680
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:28,065
-No! lt's not.
-lt's good until Nancy's phone rings.

681
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,669
And guess who it is? J-Jizzy again, man.

682
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:34,114
lt turns out that J-Jizzy
is Nancy's ex-husband.

683
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,584
-She's his ex-wife!
-Yeah, l knew that.

684
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,816
You knew?
Man, how come you didn't tell me?

685
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,914
How could you leave me...

686
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,258
What is all this?

687
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,193
-Work.
-You're an elf.

688
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:57,535
l'm not an elf. Elfstein, 2223.
Bounty, yeah, we'll catch him.

689
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,842
l'm a bounty hunter
just like you're an office...

690
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,343
Whatever, man. l'm telling...

691
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,903
l just don't know what l'm gonna do, Jamal.
What am l gonna do?

692
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,973
You know, all my life l've been looking
for two things, all right?

693
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:11,077
There's true love, and my big break.

694
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,180
-Now if l choose one, then l lose the other.
-Why?

695
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,350
What do you mean why, man?
What am l gonna say to Nancy?

696
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:19,793
Okay, yeah, by the way, Nancy.
Yeah, baby, yeah.

697
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,491
l don't sell pens, baby.
No, no, l don't sell pens.

698
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:26,262
l'm just this shysty song-writing Santa,

699
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,204
who, now l have to dump you
and kiss up to your ex-husband.

700
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:34,537
And then, what about J-Jizzy? This is what
J-Jizzy is gonna say. He gonna be like,

701
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:38,047
''Yeah, Mr. Songwriter.
Yeah, let me tell you something.

702
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:43,575
''l will buy your song, but by the way,
have fun taking care of my kids.''

703
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,053
That's ugly.

704
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,919
-Jamal. Baby, who's there?
-Nobody, baby.

705
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:52,450
This lieutenant lost his mind and came by.
Go to sleep.

706
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,267
Look, Three-Card Monte.

707
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,932
Yeah, we should run down to Hell's Kitchen.
We used to give it to them.

708
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:08,307
Same game. You just can't get caught

709
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,108
in the same room at the same time
with either one of them.

710
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:15,048
You're right. lt is the same. l just move here.
They're over there, l move here.

711
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,245
-Cool. Cool.
-And one other question. Hey, but wait.

712
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:29,189
-l mean, he's a decent-looking man.
-No, Delicious, you're talking about sass.

713
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:33,964
There's sass behind this man.
Look at him, man. He's coffee-bean black.

714
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:37,438
Women love a coffee-bean black balladeer.

715
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:40,135
That white turtleneck don't hurt neither.

716
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,837
-And the caramel hat...
-Makes me hungry.

717
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,436
Yeah, it makes you want to have

718
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:47,074
a Reese's Cup or something.
You know what l mean?

719
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,051
-Women like Reese's Cups.
-Yeah. He looks like cookies and milk.

720
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,643
That's what we should call him,
Cookies and Milk.

721
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,188
Cookies and Milk. That's... You know what?

722
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,884
That's better than Peaches and Herb.
Cookies and Milk.

723
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,587
Cookies and Milk. There's two of them,
but it's just him with the...

724
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,629
-Yeah.
-...milk shirt.

725
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:04,428
We'll release the CD.
lt'll have one free chocolate chip cookie

726
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,991
-with each CD.
-Call it <i>Munchies.</i>

727
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,799
<i>-Munchies,</i> yeah.
-That's the name of his album.

728
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,702
l like it, man. l'm liking that.

729
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,971
So, how was that?
l mean, l could step it up a little bit,

730
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,536
you know, if you want it
a little bit more up-tempo.

731
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,482
Or l could dial it back,
if you want to vibe with it a little bit.

732
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,314
You know, just vibe.

733
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,513
<i>You need to head on down</i>
<i>to our business affairs office</i>

734
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:28,216

01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:48,108
Okay, all right.
But l haven't signed a contract yet.

741
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:50,577
<i>Well, you'd best take care of that then.</i>

742
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,810
-Kimmelfarb.
-He's white.

743
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,615
He's white.

744
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:59,712
Right, right. Kimmelfarb. Got it.
Cool, all right.

745
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,361
Look, baby, l can't make you any promises.

01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,957
-We don't even know if he's in there.
-l don't care. l just want to see him.

747
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:14,470
-You can drop me off. l'll wait.
-l'm not gonna drop you off, John-John.

748
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:17,802
Baby. Don't get out of this car. Boy!

749
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:25,841
Cramp.

750
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,146
Ben, where you at?

751
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,947
Listen, l can't make it, okay?
l'm stuck at J-Jizzy's studio.

752
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,545
You're gonna have to fill in for me.

753
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:37,285
That's right. lt's time.
lt's time for you to step up.

754
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,828
Be the man. Be the big red one.
Be the suit, baby.

755
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,228
-How're you guys doing?
-Just trying to keep up with this one.

756
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:43,925
Yeah, you've gotten so big.

757
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,198
Santa.

758
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:53,901
Hey, did you find Sydney?

759
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,008
He wasn't where he was supposed to be.

760
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:01,483
Well, okay, well, let's get it started.
We can get it all legal later.

761
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,577
Hey, is that Nancy? You know...

762
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,346
l guess diarrhea can hit you at any time.

763
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,730
Dad!

764
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:27,503

01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,584
John-John, why don't you go to the kitchen
and get yourself a soda?

769
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:41,145
Okay. l'll let you guys fight now.

-lf you gotta go, you gotta go.
-Yeah.

01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:11,147
You wash your hands? Just playing.
Stay away from the fruit.

773
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,485
Anyway, we'll get down there.
They're getting started.

774
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:17,492
How many songs you got in you, Benjamin?

Okay. Don't even worry about that.

01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,614
l'm gonna make him a smoothie
or something. There's got to be...

782
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,550
Just grab the pieces
that fell on another piece.

783
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,611
That's fine, right there. Yeah, that's good.

784
01:03:54,997 --> 01:04:00,060
That's right, little Cindy.
What do you mean you didn't get your bike?

785
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,408
This isn't about you or me.
This is about John-John.

786
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,035
l told you l was going to make time for him.

787
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,579
-Right there.
-Not right now.

01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,343
-lt's always not right now.
-Over there.

789
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,214
You wanna know why
he had to see you today?

790
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,116
Why he was holding onto you so tight?

791
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:22,453
l met a man, James. Yeah, a man.
A nice, normal man.

792
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,925
A man that John-John
actually made a connection with,

793
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:28,225
-and it scared the daylights out of him.
-l don't got time for this right now.

794
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,424
l'm working on an album. Right, Delicious?

795
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,729
He does not have time.
He is working on an album. Trying...

796
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:36,033
-Stay out of this, Delicious.
-Mind your business.

797
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,934
l'm working on an album. Okay?

798
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,807
l gotta turn it in.
The deadline is Christmas Eve.

799
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,280
Everybody's gonna be there.
BET, <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

800
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:47,782
This is why you want the kids
for the holidays.

801
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,647
You don't even care about Christmas.

802
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,984
You need them for the cameras
so Daddy can sell a few more CDs.

803
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,024
-You are whacked.
-And you're pathetic.

804
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:59,926
l just pray that the judge sees through you
faster than l did.

805
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,693
Judge gonna also see
that you done gained weight.

806
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:09,265
Where's Mr. Songwriter at?
Come on, let's do this.

807
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,197
And a bike, too.

808
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,106
And a puppy, too.

809
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:20,012
Okay, a puppy. You're gonna get it.
Come on.

810
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,776
Come on, it's okay. l'm Santa. lt's okay.

811
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:27,380
-Go, go.
-No, l don't want to. l don't want to.

812
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,236
l got you. l got you!

813
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,512
l got you!

814
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:23,134
Yo, an album deal, man.
Yeah, with J-Jizzy, l swear to God.

815
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:27,266
-Look, man, that's great news. There you go.
-You know what this means, right, Jamal?

816
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:31,302
-Benjamin Armstrong is a real songwriter.
-Well, check this out.

817
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,871
-l'm a real bounty hunter. That's right.
-Man, not so tight.

818
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,679
Hey, y'all be careful with him, man.
He's worth 500 bucks.

819
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,159
l gotta go dookie.

820
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:49,391
-You ain't gotta go to no bathroom.
-l want to go dookie.

821
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:56,471
All right, it's time for stockings.
Now, be careful with the glitter, okay?

822
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,734
-Okay, Mommy.
-All right.

823
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,240
-Fun, fun, fun.
-Thank you.

824
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,438
Okay, why the long face?

825
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:10,178
Benjamin and l were supposed to go
look for a tree today.

826
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,584
l don't know what happened.
l guess he just forgot.

827
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:15,317
Honey, there could be 100 reasons
why he ran out like that.

828
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:19,452
-Maybe he's never coming back.
-Now, honey, men are like trees.

829
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,587
Rough, sturdy, but dull,

830
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:24,997
until a woman gets her hands on him,
gives him a little personality.

831
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:27,865
-Then once you've done all that...
-They leave you for a shrub.

832
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,771
No, they dry up, their limbs shrivel,
and they become a fire hazard.

833
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,639
-No and no.
-Saved by the bell.

834
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:43,618
Now, if you don't like this, there's another
one hanging from my rear view mirror.

835
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:47,949
They're kissing.

836
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:56,662
Kids, Brenda, let's go
and have some cocoa. Yeah?

837
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,462
-What about the tree?
-Momma's chopping it down,

838
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,196
-right now, baby.
-Yeah.

839
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,828
-Let's just... Come on. Come on.
-Wait. Wait.

840
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,807
-Look, about the other night...
-You don't have to say a word.

841
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,475
-Actually, yes, l do.
-Then just let me go first.

842
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:18,008
We have a beach house in Santa Barbara,
and we go there every Christmas,

843
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:21,682
you know, me and the kids. Just us.
You know, our family.

844
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:26,591
And l'd love it if you would come
with us this year.

845
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,893
-l'll be right back.
-Okay.

846
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,831
Man, l gotta do it now. l gotta do it now.

847
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:41,434
Okay, the pens, Santa. No. What do l do?

848
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:45,411
-Pens, songwriter, Santa.
-Okay.

849
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:51,351
No, Santa, pens, songwriter.
Santa, pens, songwriter. Santa, pens...

850
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:58,525
-What's wrong?
-That was my attorney.

851
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:02,223
He ruled in Jizzy's favor.
He gets the kids for Christmas.

852
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:10,464
-So you didn't say nothing to her?
-No, man, how could l?

853
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:14,771
She just lost her kids for Christmas.
l just couldn't put that on her.

854
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:19,337
And Jizzy, to her, sucks as a father.

855
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:22,213
-Yeah, but he's still their father.
-What?

856
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,051
l said he's still their father.

857
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:29,181
This guy butters your bread just a little bit
and now you rolling with it?

858
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,089
-No. No.
-lt sounds like you're rolling with it.

859
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,186
Look, if the judge agrees with him,
how come l can't?

860
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:38,758
You don't understand, man.
You just don't understand.

861
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:42,099
Okay, choose. Which one do you want
to take with you to see your dad?

862
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,901
l don't know. Which one's the bike?

863
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:48,740
Santa's still working on that one.
l want you to pick one of these.

864
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:52,178
-l want that one.
-Okay, good choice.

865
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,513
-l hope it's a race car.
-Here you go.

866
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,245
l want you.

867
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:03,080
l can't go, baby.

868
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:05,922
But you'll only be gone a week, right?
And then, when you get back,

869
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:09,624
we can all have our very own
special Christmas. Okay?

870
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:14,367
l'll get it!

871
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,874
Okay, come in.

872
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,309
-Hello.
-Hi, Melody Oates.

873
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:26,746
J-Jizzy sent us to fit the kids
for the party tonight.

874
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,113
-Nobody called?
-No.

875
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:32,244
lf they try them on,
we can hem them right here.

876
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:35,256
l'm sorry. When exactly did my kids
become The Jackson Five?

877
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:39,124
-l ain't being Michael.
-Sorry, ma'am, l'm just doing my job.

878
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,498
Kim? Get him here now.

879
01:11:48,065 --> 01:11:51,228
This is a new low, J, even for you.

880
01:11:51,301 --> 01:11:55,567
You got what you wanted. You got the kids
on the most special day of the year.

881
01:11:55,639 --> 01:11:58,938
You want to parade them around
like a damn circus act.

882
01:11:59,009 --> 01:12:03,469
-Look, this is just a party.
-Yeah, a party for you. Not them. You.

883
01:12:04,748 --> 01:12:07,216
You know what? l see what this is all about.

884
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:11,311
-You just mad 'cause you lost.
-The kids are the losers in this, J.

885
01:12:11,388 --> 01:12:15,757
Not me or you. They could have had
a real Christmas, a normal Christmas.

886
01:12:15,826 --> 01:12:18,192
-With a real family.
-With who?

887
01:12:18,261 --> 01:12:19,888
You and that chump
you've been running around with?

888
01:12:19,963 --> 01:12:22,727
He's not a chump, J. He's a grownup.

889
01:12:22,799 --> 01:12:26,291
Unlike this 40-year-old spoiled brat
in a cheap chinchilla.

890
01:12:26,369 --> 01:12:28,394
l'm 35, l'm not spoiled, and guess what?

891
01:12:28,472 --> 01:12:30,997
We gonna see how much of a man he is
when he hook with me.

892
01:12:31,074 --> 01:12:32,701
l can't wait for you to meet.

893
01:12:32,776 --> 01:12:35,939
l gotta thank my lucky stars that l met him,
because l just hope, one day,

894
01:12:36,012 --> 01:12:37,274
we can get married.

895
01:12:42,853 --> 01:12:44,184
Excuse me.

896
01:12:45,455 --> 01:12:46,854
Excuse me.

897
01:12:46,923 --> 01:12:51,019
-Hold on, man, you can't just...
-Shut up! l got something to say.

898
01:12:51,094 --> 01:12:54,222
Why are you doing this?
You said you were gonna help me.

899
01:12:54,297 --> 01:12:57,357
You send us this guy, and now
my mom says she's gonna marry him.

900
01:12:57,434 --> 01:12:58,958
She loves him, you fat jerk.

901
01:12:59,035 --> 01:13:00,832
Now Mom and Dad
will never get back together.

902
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:03,839
-Okay, now, hold on.
-l hate you. l hate you.

903
01:13:09,379 --> 01:13:16,182
l'm... Santa is sorry. Okay?
He didn't mean for this to happen.

904
01:13:16,253 --> 01:13:19,552
That man is never gonna
see your mother again, okay?

905
01:13:21,324 --> 01:13:22,655
l promise.

906
01:13:28,131 --> 01:13:30,361
Jamal, l'm out. l'll be back.

907
01:14:08,271 --> 01:14:10,205
-Hello?
<i>-Hey, Nancy.</i>

908
01:14:10,273 --> 01:14:12,867
Hey, Benjamin.

909
01:14:14,177 --> 01:14:16,441
Listen, about the beach house.

910
01:14:18,481 --> 01:14:20,779
Something came up.
l'm not going to be able to make it.

911
01:14:22,219 --> 01:14:25,484
That's cool. We can just
do the holidays somewhere else.

912
01:14:25,555 --> 01:14:27,455
l can't do that, either.

913
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:32,790
ln fact, l can't do us anymore. l just...

914
01:14:34,998 --> 01:14:37,796
l won't be seeing you again. l'm sorry.

915
01:14:37,868 --> 01:14:39,460
Wait. What? Hello?

916
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:04,686
The kids are fine. They're watching a video,
and these are for you.

917
01:15:04,761 --> 01:15:09,323
-Thanks.
-lt's okay. lt's okay.

918
01:15:09,399 --> 01:15:11,765
What happened?

919
01:15:11,835 --> 01:15:16,363
Mommy and Benjamin broke up. Sorry.

920
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:22,173
-Mom. Don't cry.
-That's okay. l'm gonna be okay.

921
01:15:26,049 --> 01:15:27,380
She'll get over it.

922
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:30,476
l didn't just do this for me.
l did this for all of us.

923
01:15:30,553 --> 01:15:36,150
Don't you want Dad back? l do.
l mean, sure, they fight all the time,

924
01:15:36,226 --> 01:15:40,492
but that's what people
who love each other do. They fight.

925
01:15:40,563 --> 01:15:44,465
-l liked Emily's wish better.
-Whatever.

926
01:15:46,169 --> 01:15:48,433
Hey, everybody, we are coming at you live

927
01:15:48,505 --> 01:15:51,531
from the J-Jizzy Christmas album
release party

928
01:15:51,608 --> 01:15:54,270
for J-Jizzy's <i>Rockin' Christmas.</i>

929
01:15:58,214 --> 01:16:02,116
Yeah, Christmas is a very
special time for me.

930
01:16:02,185 --> 01:16:04,813
-lt's very spiritual.
-Yeah, l got them. They just pulled up.

931
01:16:04,888 --> 01:16:09,951
Time to spend time with the children,
your loved ones, family.

932
01:16:10,026 --> 01:16:14,190
And this Christmas,
l intend to spend most of it with my family.

933
01:16:14,798 --> 01:16:17,096
-Dad! Over here!
-Kids are here.

934
01:16:18,802 --> 01:16:23,432
Do l look like l'm finished right now? Put
them in the dressing room or something.

935
01:16:23,506 --> 01:16:25,667
-We ain't got time for that. Let's go.
-What?

936
01:16:25,742 --> 01:16:29,769
Yeah, l love you, too.
As l was saying, l love family.

937
01:16:49,866 --> 01:16:50,958
Wow!

938
01:16:56,773 --> 01:16:59,071
-All aboard.
-Come on, kids. Free rides.

939
01:17:01,378 --> 01:17:04,814
Look. Look there. And there. And over there.

940
01:17:08,418 --> 01:17:11,251
All right, come on. That's enough of that.
Let's go. We gotta go this way.

941
01:17:11,321 --> 01:17:15,223
What are you looking at? You're not here
for fun. You're here to work, all right?

942
01:17:16,393 --> 01:17:18,088
What l thought was gonna be
the perfect Christmas

943
01:17:18,161 --> 01:17:20,254
is shaping up to be the worst Christmas.

944
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:25,393
-Okay. This is not the worst Christmas.
-Yeah, you've got us, and we're your girls.

945
01:17:25,468 --> 01:17:27,595
No, you're right, you know.

946
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:29,865
And James does know
how to throw a good party, right?

947
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:32,931
-Yeah.
-l'm sure the kids are having a good time.

948
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:40,576
Look at me.

949
01:17:42,185 --> 01:17:44,380
-Come on. Come on.
-Wow.

950
01:17:45,555 --> 01:17:48,422
<i>-You're the gal I always dreamed of.</i>
<i>-What do you mean, Mike?</i>

951
01:17:48,525 --> 01:17:51,187
<i>When I was in the war,</i>
<i>I thought about you all the time.</i>

952
01:17:51,294 --> 01:17:53,194
<i>Oh, golly,</i>
<i>I have every single one of your letters,</i>

953
01:17:53,263 --> 01:17:56,824
<i>and I always remember Christmas Eve</i>
<i>you sent me a special something.</i>

954
01:18:01,704 --> 01:18:05,640
Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you.
Thanks for coming.

955
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:09,444
You know she's talking about
marrying this chump, right?

956
01:18:09,512 --> 01:18:13,778
l can't afford for that to happen.
That's gonna make me look stupid.

957
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:15,909
-You know what l'm gonna do?
-What's that?

958
01:18:15,985 --> 01:18:17,748
l'm gonna marry her.

959
01:18:19,322 --> 01:18:21,313
-Then l'm gonna dump her.
-What?

960
01:18:21,391 --> 01:18:22,483
What?

961
01:18:25,428 --> 01:18:28,158
Hey, what's up, shorty? What's going on?

962
01:19:05,802 --> 01:19:10,535
-The mall is closed.
-Let me in. l need to see Santa.

963
01:19:13,176 --> 01:19:14,541
Santa died.

964
01:19:19,415 --> 01:19:23,511
-Don't listen to him, kid.
-Can you let me in?

965
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:29,317
From the looks of things, l'd say
what you need is a good nose blowing.

966
01:19:29,392 --> 01:19:32,759
-l just need to see him.
-lt's Christmas Eve, son.

967
01:19:32,829 --> 01:19:38,927
-lt's a little late to be hauling out your list.
-Please, l gotta give back the wish. Please.

968
01:19:42,572 --> 01:19:44,472
Let me see what l can do.

969
01:19:45,842 --> 01:19:48,538
Probably get fired for this.

970
01:19:48,611 --> 01:19:51,842
l hope you ain't one of them
teenage cat burglar types.

971
01:19:51,915 --> 01:19:54,145
-No, l'm a good kid.
-Okay.

972
01:19:55,318 --> 01:19:58,287
-All right, go on.
-Thank you.

973
01:19:58,354 --> 01:19:59,946
Merry Christmas.

974
01:20:56,879 --> 01:21:00,508
-John-John?
-Santa, you're here.

975
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:08,819
-Where's your mother?
-She's at home, crying. Emily's crying.

976
01:21:08,891 --> 01:21:12,554
Everybody's crying,
and it's all because of me.

977
01:21:12,629 --> 01:21:18,067
My dad doesn't even love my mom.
Benjamin does. Can you bring him back?

978
01:21:21,437 --> 01:21:25,806
Please? lt's all l want for Christmas. l swear.

979
01:21:32,248 --> 01:21:33,545
Benjamin?

980
01:21:38,888 --> 01:21:43,257
Hey, you know what you need?
You need a good long vacation.

981
01:21:43,326 --> 01:21:46,227
-Okay.
-Right, like l have time for a vacation.

982
01:21:46,296 --> 01:21:48,696
-Let's go to a beach.
-Oh, God.

983
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:53,130
-Hello?
-Yeah, it's me.

984
01:21:53,202 --> 01:21:57,639
Did John-John come over there?
l still need him!

985
01:22:01,611 --> 01:22:04,045
l'll stay here, just in case he comes back.

986
01:22:05,682 --> 01:22:07,445
So, that's the story.

987
01:22:09,452 --> 01:22:11,784
All l can say, John-John, is that l'm sorry.

988
01:22:11,854 --> 01:22:15,381
l'll keep saying l'm sorry till April
if you want me to.

989
01:22:16,859 --> 01:22:19,657
Who are you gonna be then? Easter bunny?

990
01:22:25,234 --> 01:22:27,293
This is the most recent picture we got,
right there.

991
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:28,359
The father is where?

992
01:22:28,438 --> 01:22:31,498
He's right over there.
He's distraught and everything.

993
01:22:31,574 --> 01:22:34,839
-Find my shorty, man.
-All right. l want eyes up high,

994
01:22:34,911 --> 01:22:38,608
-in case he's wandering in the perimeter.
-Eyes up high.

995
01:22:38,681 --> 01:22:40,672
-All right, go.
-We're on our way now.

996
01:22:41,551 --> 01:22:42,916
ls there any word on the child?

997
01:22:42,985 --> 01:22:45,078
-You can't come through here, ma'am.
-No, l'm his mother.

998
01:22:45,154 --> 01:22:46,178
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

999
01:22:46,255 --> 01:22:51,124
-Well, we gotta get you back to that party.
-Yeah.

1000
01:22:52,061 --> 01:22:53,995
-Let's go.
-All right.

1001
01:23:10,213 --> 01:23:12,204
He's my son. He's my son.

1002
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:14,943
-l just think we just need a second to sort...
-Where is he?

1003
01:23:15,017 --> 01:23:16,644
-Where is John-John?
-Okay.

1004
01:23:16,919 --> 01:23:17,943
Yeah.

1005
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:22,279
Wow. Check out all the cops.
l wonder what happened.

1006
01:23:24,293 --> 01:23:25,487
You happened.

1007
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:28,761
Let's go.

1008
01:23:29,365 --> 01:23:32,596
-Let him through.
-l'm a bounty hunter. Okay?

1009
01:23:33,035 --> 01:23:36,562
Delicious, do not handle me.
l know when l'm being handled. Stop.

1010
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,574
-Where is our son?
-Look, l tell you this much.

1011
01:23:39,642 --> 01:23:43,043
lnstead of all this time-out stuff,
maybe you should try peeling his butt

1012
01:23:43,112 --> 01:23:44,272
when you find out where he's at.

1013
01:23:44,347 --> 01:23:47,282
Why? Because he ruined
your precious party?

1014
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,784
And where's Mikey? Where's Mikey?
There's all of these people,

1015
01:23:49,852 --> 01:23:51,479
you don't even know where Mikey is.

1016
01:23:56,926 --> 01:24:00,623
-Look up in the balcony.
-Mommy. Help, Mommy.

1017
01:24:00,696 --> 01:24:05,326
Mikey! Hold on, baby.
Do something. James, do something.

1018
01:24:06,602 --> 01:24:09,765
-Mikey.
-Mikey, hold on, baby. Hold on.

1019
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,767
Don't move, kid. Someone's coming to help.

1020
01:24:12,842 --> 01:24:16,334
-James! Don't just stand there. Help him.
-Rottweiler!

1021
01:24:19,816 --> 01:24:22,580
Mikey, Mikey. Come on, come on.

1022
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,387
Reach. Reach!

1023
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:31,688
-Come on.
-Mom.

1024
01:24:31,761 --> 01:24:33,126
John-John.

1025
01:24:38,334 --> 01:24:39,892
Hold on, Mikey.

1026
01:24:43,339 --> 01:24:46,001
-Reach. Reach. Reach hard.
-Mommy.

1027
01:24:46,075 --> 01:24:47,906
Mikey, hold on, baby.

1028
01:24:52,715 --> 01:24:54,580
Come on, Mike. Come on.

1029
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:57,517
-Help me, Santa, help me.
-Reach.

1030
01:24:57,587 --> 01:24:59,851
Come on, l got you. l got you. Just reach.

1031
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:04,724
l got you.

1032
01:25:19,308 --> 01:25:22,175
Now, you know,
l wasn't about to let that happen.

1033
01:25:24,947 --> 01:25:26,312
Stop it.

1034
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:37,820
-Go on.
-Mommy.

1035
01:25:38,528 --> 01:25:39,517
Mom.

1036
01:25:46,502 --> 01:25:48,493
-Benjamin?
-Benjamin?

1037
01:25:48,571 --> 01:25:49,902
Benjamin?

1038
01:25:49,972 --> 01:25:51,564
How do you know Benjamin?

1039
01:25:51,641 --> 01:25:53,370
Better question,
how do you know Benjamin?

1040
01:25:53,442 --> 01:25:55,637
-How do you know him?
-Yeah, how do you know her?

1041
01:25:55,711 --> 01:25:57,770
Who? Okay.

1042
01:25:59,615 --> 01:26:03,779
Exactly. A really laughable,
simple explanation.

1043
01:26:05,922 --> 01:26:08,584
Well, make me laugh then, Mr. Songwriter.

1044
01:26:08,658 --> 01:26:11,855
Songwriter? You're a songwriter?

1045
01:26:11,928 --> 01:26:15,591
He's no songwriter, Daddy.
He's Mommy's boyfriend.

1046
01:26:16,299 --> 01:26:17,425
What?

1047
01:26:20,369 --> 01:26:24,567
-You're Santa Claus also?
-Well, it's only seasonal.

1048
01:26:25,975 --> 01:26:30,241
-Pays close to nothing, but l'm Santa.
-A lot of surprises.

1049
01:26:33,115 --> 01:26:36,744
But it turns out to be
one of the best gigs l've ever had.

1050
01:26:39,155 --> 01:26:42,318
You know, as a struggling songwriter
l've had a lot of gigs.

1051
01:26:42,391 --> 01:26:46,828
l'm glad you enjoyed the journey,
'cause your days as a struggling songwriter,

1052
01:26:46,896 --> 01:26:49,956
they far from over. You're fired, chump.

1053
01:26:50,032 --> 01:26:53,024
Delicious!
l want that cut pulled immediately.

1054
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:57,901
A couple of problems with that, boss.
First, the album's already been shipped off,

1055
01:26:57,974 --> 01:27:01,000
and second,
that's the best song on the whole album.

1056
01:27:01,077 --> 01:27:04,478
So you might want to keep that one
on there, just for sales and all.

1057
01:27:04,547 --> 01:27:06,412
Okay, then, since you like the song so much

1058
01:27:06,482 --> 01:27:10,077
you can spend the rest of your days
listening to it. You fired!

1059
01:27:10,152 --> 01:27:13,019
-l'm fired?
-But, Daddy, he is right. lt is a great song.

1060
01:27:13,089 --> 01:27:15,023
-And you fired, too!
-What?

1061
01:27:15,091 --> 01:27:20,393
As my son.
ln fact, everybody's fired, as my fans.

1062
01:27:20,463 --> 01:27:26,925
l want you all out. Everybody, get out!
Rottweiler! Routine 919. Sexy exit.

1063
01:27:32,341 --> 01:27:35,504
-Yeah, that's sexy.
-Get off!

1064
01:27:35,578 --> 01:27:37,512
-Dad!
-John-John.

1065
01:27:46,322 --> 01:27:48,916
That day at the mall.

1066
01:27:48,991 --> 01:27:53,360
My wish. The compliment.
Emily told you, didn't she?

1067
01:27:55,398 --> 01:27:58,595
Yeah. That's where the lie began.

1068
01:27:59,669 --> 01:28:02,263
But right here is where that lie ends.

1069
01:28:07,043 --> 01:28:08,101
Dad.

1070
01:28:09,412 --> 01:28:12,176
You okay? You want me to come with you

1071
01:28:12,248 --> 01:28:14,375
so you don't have to spend
Christmas alone?

1072
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:16,941
Alone? l got plenty of company.

1073
01:28:22,992 --> 01:28:25,620
That ain't the reason
why you can't come with me, though.

1074
01:28:25,695 --> 01:28:28,630
-What?
-You ought to be with your momma.

1075
01:28:28,698 --> 01:28:32,327
l mean, she got this whole holiday thing
down to a science.

1076
01:28:32,401 --> 01:28:34,392
Fact is, she always did.

1077
01:28:38,274 --> 01:28:42,904
-And you're right. lt's a good song, too.
-Told you.

1078
01:28:42,978 --> 01:28:45,674
Hey, you know l love you
and your momma, right?

1079
01:28:45,748 --> 01:28:47,340
-Yeah.
-And your brother and your sister.

1080
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:54,015
l love all of y'all. Sometimes l get
carried away with this whole J-Jizzy's thing.

1081
01:28:54,523 --> 01:28:58,550
l say stuff that hurt people's feelings,
but l don't mean it.

1082
01:28:58,627 --> 01:29:02,085
-Merry Christmas, Dad.
-Yeah, merry Christmas.

1083
01:29:05,501 --> 01:29:06,798
Hey, Dad.

1084
01:29:13,709 --> 01:29:15,870
Rottweiler. Daddy's leaving.

1085
01:29:19,982 --> 01:29:22,280
So l knew the truth
was gonna come out sometime.

1086
01:29:22,351 --> 01:29:25,286
Just want to say l'm sorry.

1087
01:29:25,354 --> 01:29:29,347
You really are one of the best things
that's ever happened to me.

1088
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:34,052
Mikey, keep up with them race cars,
all right?

1089
01:29:35,431 --> 01:29:39,800
Emily, you really are a princess.

1090
01:29:42,004 --> 01:29:43,369
l'm sorry.

1091
01:29:59,822 --> 01:30:01,346
Keyboard shake?

1092
01:30:17,706 --> 01:30:20,504
What you waiting for? Go get him!

1093
01:30:20,576 --> 01:30:24,512
-Yeah, Mommy, go get your man.
-Yeah, go get him.

1094
01:30:57,313 --> 01:30:58,678
Hey, Santa.

1095
01:31:03,586 --> 01:31:05,383
l think l need a pen.

1096
01:31:18,901 --> 01:31:20,766
Daddy fired John-John.

1097
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:24,034
What's worse than that is
Daddy fired me, too.

1098
01:31:24,106 --> 01:31:28,202
So now l'm on my own, looking
for some hot new talent to cut a cool record.

1099
01:31:28,277 --> 01:31:30,006
Anybody interested?

1100
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:33,605
Merry Christmas.

1101
01:31:33,682 --> 01:31:35,547
Well, l just want a kiss on that.

1102
01:31:35,618 --> 01:31:38,246
-They want to kiss all the time.
-Yeah.

1103
01:31:40,356 --> 01:31:41,653
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1104
01:31:41,757 --> 01:31:43,588
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1105
01:31:44,093 --> 01:31:45,890
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1106
01:31:48,230 --> 01:31:51,529
Well, l guess a wise woman
was right after all.

1107
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:56,697
The best Christmas present
is a happy family all wrapped up together.

1108
01:31:56,772 --> 01:31:59,764
Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas.

1109
01:32:00,342 --> 01:32:03,334
l know. l know.
What would you do without me?

1110
01:32:03,412 --> 01:32:05,607
And to all a good night.

1111
01:32:09,818 --> 01:32:13,185
l almost forgot. Merry Christmas!

1112
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:43,608
Why is it every time you gotta win?

1113
01:32:44,386 --> 01:32:46,217
Why can't l have one?

1114
01:32:49,058 --> 01:32:50,889
Why can't l have one?

1115
01:32:55,264 --> 01:32:56,492
The end.
