Radu, who coveted the 
 bloodstone, to which his

7
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,760

 rightful heir.

12
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,120
Stefan destroyed him with a 
 stake through the heart,

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,720
infused me with his own 
 blood and lay me down

14
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,120

 of the Bucharest Police.

192
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,400
And as I said it earlier, I'm 
 Mel Thompson, US Embassy Now,

193
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,640
this may sound a little 
 strange but yesterday

194
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,960
afternoon, your sister Michelle 
 was found unconscious

195
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,600
in her hotel room.

196
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,360
Then she walked away from scene 
 of the accident and

197
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,480
disappeared.

198
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,680
We think she may be suffering 
 from shock.

199
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,840
She appeared to be dead.

200
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,400
I examined her myself.

201
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,320
Obvious misdiagnosis 
 Lieutenant.

202
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,680
On behalf of the Department 
 of Police I apologize for

203
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,080
terrible mistake.

204
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,960
According to witnesses 
 at the accident, she

205
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,640
did not appear injured.

206
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,920
Now, we are confident she's 
 going to turn up.

207
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,440
Your sister's possessions.

208
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
One thing more.

209
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,480
Do you know, what is this?

210
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,000
Uh, it looks like some 
 kind of um, antique?

211
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,480
Looks expensive, huh?

212
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,760
You're not accusing her of 
 stealing it, are you?

213
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,640
Oh, no, no, no, no.

214
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,480
No evidence is stolen.

215
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,960
But before leaving Romania 
 show us the receipt.

216
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,160
Of course.

217
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,800
I'm sure Michelle has 
 it somewhere.

218
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,640
Thank you.

219
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,000
For you.

220
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,920
Thank you.

221
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,840
Nothing.

222
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,200
We will uh, find her.

223
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,960
But if you see first, 
 call me, yeah?

224
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,760
Ha, let's go my friend.

225

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,680
[women singing]

227
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,680
Yes, please, has Rebecca Morgan 
 checked in there yet?

228
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,760
[phone rings]

229
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,080
[phone ringing on other end]

230
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
Uh, hello?

231
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,400

 You are nevermore.

(SINGING) From shallow 
 grave he will rise.

238
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,400
You ride the night shrouded 
 in your desecrated veil.

239
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:12,400
You bring the sleep upon 
 your lips so pale.

240
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:20,760
Baptised in flame your 
 soul won't be reborn.

241
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:28,520
Entrapped, the souls cry 
 beneath the gravestone.

242
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,720
[heavy metal music playing]

243
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,280
(SINGING) Do you believe 
 in heaven?

244
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,680
Do you believe in hell?

245
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,880
Do you believe in all 
 the things this

246
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,680
world will never tell?

247
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,080
It came to me in a dream, 
 nightmare of despair.

248
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,640
Shapes of memory haunt me now, 
 no faith you can ever repair.

249
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,840
[heavy metal music playing]

250
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,080
[crying softly]

251
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,960
Home.

252
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,960
Please, have some, Polenka.

253
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,400
I make it myself.

254
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,200
Uh, no thanks, Professor.

255
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,880
I'm on duty.

256
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,360
Thank you.

257
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,920
What is it?

258
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,200
Polenka, plum brandy.

259
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,840
A Romanian special too.

260
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,040
Noroc.

261
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,240
Mm, it's delicious.

262
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,640
Strongest alcohol 
 known to man.

263
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,880
Well, excuse me, Professor, but 
 about the American girls?

264
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,680
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.

265
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,560
Madame Ovila and her 
 two friends.

266
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,800
They are in a monastery at 
 Prejmer doing research in the

267
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,200
neighboring villages.

268
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,800
What exactly did their 
 research involve?

269
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,000
Vampires, the legends 
 of Castle Vladislav.

270
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Professor, could you tell 
 us what this is?

271
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,840
Hmm.

272
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,960
Hmm, interesting.

273
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,040
Once upon a time perhaps 
 I could have told you.

274
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:32,600
But now, sad to say, my memory 
 is going bye-bye.

275
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,960
Professor, is there 
 a telephone

276
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,040
there a--at the monastery?

277
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,720
Telephone? (LAUGHS)

278
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,000
Uh, then maybe you can show 
 it to us on the map?

279
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,880
Yes, yes, of course.

280
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,560
Let's see, Campoverde, 
 [inaudible]

281
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,040
highway here.

282
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,400
Monastary, here.

283
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,040
It's not easy to find.

284
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,680
But if you like, I'll come 
 along, show you the way and

285
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,280
have a Polenka with my 
 old friend Carl.

286
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,080
[music playing]

287
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,480
Uh, professor?

288
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,400
Huh?

289
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,360
Wake up, we're here.

290
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,840
Oh, oh, oh yes, yes, yes.

291
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,000
Carl!

292
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,480
Carl [inaudible], come and say 
 hello to your old friend

293
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,040
Nicolei Popescu.

294
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,440
Hello?

295
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,360
Is anybody here?

296
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,920
Michelle?

297
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,200
Mara?

298
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,320
Lilian?

299
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,720
[car horn beeps]

300
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,840
[ringing bell]

301
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,040
Hello!

302
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,040
Michelle?

303
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,520
Castle Vladislav, home of the 
 legendary king of vampires.

304
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,720
Wow, does anybody 
 live in there?

305
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,000
Not for many, many years.

306
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,520
The descendents lie 
 in tombs there.

307
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,240
And it belongs to the 
 Vladislav family.

308
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,240
But they left Romania a 
 long, long time ago.

309
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,040
Huh, let's go and see the older 
 part of the castle.

310
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,080
The descendants of Vladislavs 
 lie buried here in

311
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,480
unconsecrated ground.

312
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,320
Professor, what exactly is the

313
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,040
legend of Castle Vladislav?

314
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,760
An obscure old story about King 
 Vladislav, the vampire,

315
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,560
who made piece with the 
 people of the region.

316
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,680
I remember he had two sons.

317
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,240
But sad to say, I forgot 
 the details.

318
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,480
But don't worry.

319
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,080
I have it in a book somewhere.

320
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,640
What in the world?

321
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,800
That's a fresh grave.

322
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,200
No, professor, wait for us.

323
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,640
Oh, watch out.

324
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,040
Yes, please, be careful.

325
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,080
Wait, Professor, where 
 are we going?

326
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,720
This is my own secret 
 way into castle.

327
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,360
Want to come have 
 a look around?

328
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,520
I really don't think we 
 should go in there.

329
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,440
Why not?

330
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,800
It's unoccupied.

331
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,320
I am director of historical 
 museum.

332
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,480
I'm sure, Ms. Morg--

333
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,400
I would love to see 
 it, professor.

334
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,800
Good.

335
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,040
Nicolai Popescu comes 
 prepared, huh?

336
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,440
Come.

337
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,400
[ominous music playing]

338
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:40,040
This is a secret passageway 
 to main path of castle.

339
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,440
I discovered it years ago when 
 I was with the university.

340
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,840
Oh, man.

341
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,920
Now we are below the castle.

342
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,600
I think it's getting kind 
 of late professor.

343
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,400
Maybe we ought to head back.

344
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Soon, my friend, soon.

345
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,120
The throne room is somewhere 
 on this level.

346
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,200
Someone's here.

347
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,840
You know, it's getting 
 dark you guys.

348
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,240
I think we should leave.

00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,320
Michelle?

352
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,640
Lillian?

353
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,760
BECKY: Lillian?

354
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,320
Mara?

355
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,680
Anybody hear me?

356
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,040
[radu emanating sound]

357
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:01,120
Oh, you dared to enter 
 my father's house?

358
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,840
I've been told that this 
 place is deserted.

359
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,640
Please forgive us.

360
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,320
I am Nicolai Popescu, director 
 of historical museum.

361
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,040
Trespassers are 
 forbidden here.

362
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,520
Leave my house at once.

363
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,240
Yes, sir, we're very sorry.

364
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,640
Thank you.

365
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,040
Bye-bye.

366
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,440
Jesus, who was that guy?

367
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,080
A Vladislav, I suppose, come 
 to reclaim his heritage.

368
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,440
BECKY: Well, 
 I want the police to

369
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,680
look into him too.

370
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,080
MEL: Definitely.

Well, I had a marvelous day.

373
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,320
Call me in the morning 
 and we will

374
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,760
find the Book of Vladislav.

375

BECKY: Thanks 
 for everything, Mel.

382
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,240
Well, hey, aside from the 
 fact that we committed a

383
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,840
felony that could get me 
 permanently banned from the

386
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,120
I'll call you first thing 
 in the morning.

387

Michelle?

388
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,840

You're scaring me.

396
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,360
Stay there, Becky, 
 don't look at me.

397
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,680
Michelle, please, tell me 
 what's going on so I can help

398
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,720
you.

399
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,040
I shouldn't have called you.

400
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,320
You can't help me.

401
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,400
I can.

402
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,920
But you have to tell me 
 what's happening.

403
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,320
I can't.

404
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,440
Then tell me what this is.

[Radu emanating sound]

406
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,200
Give it to me, Becky.

407
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,400
I need it.

408
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,520
What's wrong with 
 you, Michelle?

409
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,840
You look sick.

410
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,240
I have to go now.

411

[dark choral music playing]

419
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,120
Pitiful little goddess of the 
 temple, the bloodstone is not

420
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,840
for creatures such as you.

421
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,600
No, please.

422
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,960
Please leave me alone.

423
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,800
You are my fledgling.

424
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,200
Embrace me as your master 
 and all that is

425
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,280
mine will be yours.

426
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,440
You killed my friends.

427
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,840
Spurn me and I will torment 
 you to eternity.

428
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:55,560
Soon enough you will beg 
 me for deliverance.

429
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,520
Patience, pretty one.

430
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,840
We have all the time 
 in the world.

[Mummy whispering]

432
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:49,160
I bear you an offering, Mummy, 
 the most holy of holiest.

433
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,600
What troubles you, child?

434
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,040
My hunger.

435
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,760
For love.

436
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:33,600
Love is for mortals, 
 not for such as we.

437
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,760
I loved my brother Stefan.

438
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,920
And always I had not 
 taken his life.

439
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:49,080
Tormenting him was such 
 a sweet pleasure.

440
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:53,560
Stefan yearned for peace.

441
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,240
You were his deliverer.

442
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,880
Now there's only 
 my fledgling.

443
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,680
And she resist my mastery.

444
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,920
Curse Stefan for polluting 
 her with his goodness.

445
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,240
Destroy her before 
 she destroys you.

446
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,960
My desire for her 
 is more sublime.

447
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,040
I yearn to see her.

448
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,720
Stefan, to eternity.

449
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,240
I turned in the papers for 
 two men to investigate

450
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,760
[inaudible].

451
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,880
If big boss approves we will 
 have answers by next week.

452
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,160
I saw Michelle last night.

453
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,080
You did?

454
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,000
Where?

455
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,680
Outside the hotel.

456
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,800
She tried to run away.

457
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,680
But I caught up with her.

458
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,800
She begged me for the stone.

459
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,760
And then she ran off again.

460
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,720
Terrified, like someone 
 was after her.

461
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:32,160
More and more this sounds me 
 like a case of stolen goods.

462
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,400
Oh, where'd you learn that?

No.

Popescu's secret library.

467
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,840
All the precious books I saved 
 from the bonfires of books.

468
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,840
The book of Vladislav is here 
 somewhere, somewhere.

469
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,040
Let's get to work.

470
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,760
Aha, just as I thought.

471
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,720
The legend of King Vladislav 
 the vampire.

472
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,080
Here is the story of King 
 Vlad and the bloodstone.

473
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,120
The bloodstone?

474
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,360
The bloodstone?

475
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,200
A mythical relic said to drip 
 blood of the saints.

476
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,680
A stupid story, Dracula.

477
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,400
Bella Lugosi was Hungarian.

478
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,680
Like Zsa Zsa Gabor.

479
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,960
What are you talking about?

480
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,160
Zsa Zsa Gabor.

481
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,360
Zsa Zsa Gabor.

482
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,120
Here's in an etching.

483
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,440
It looks similar to your 
 sister's antique.

484
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,120
It looks exactly like it.

485
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,040
Look.

486
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,640
Please.

487
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,000
Could be stolen, yes?

488
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,120
Perhaps.

489
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,840
You mean like a--a reproduction 
 or something?

490
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,640
Or the real thing.

491
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,440
Excuse me, but mythical 
 objects, by

492
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,280
definition, are not real.

493
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,640
This story tells of the rivalry 
 between King Vlad's

494
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,440
sons, Stefan and Radu.

495
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,160
Radu?

496
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,720
She called that name last night, 
 as if he were standing

497

there watching us.

498
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:01,320
Hey, come on you guys, we're 
 talking fairy tales here.

499
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,440
Mel, I saw her.

500
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,840
Whatever is going on here 
 is not a fairy tale.

I'm deep within my heart.

Now it beats no longer cause 
 you ripped it all apart.

I am no mortal.

I am not a man.

507
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,880
Now I'm just a memory you 
 cannot understand.

01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,840
Help me please.

557
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,160
I don't want to die.

558
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,040
I love you, Michelle.

559
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,080
You're not going to die.

560
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,040

562
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,600
Radu!

563
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,360
No!

564
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:38,920
Please!

565
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,680
No!

566
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,040
Who are you?

567
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,240
What do you want?

568
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,840
Run, Becky, get away.

569
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,000
Leave with my sister alone!

570
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,560
[Radu emanating sound]

571
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,720
Embrace me fledgling.

572
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,680
Accept your destiny.

573
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:11,000
You will remember this 
 as a day of joy.

574
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,400
-Michelle, don't.

575
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,920
[radu emanating sound]

576
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,320
MICHELLE: Go home!

577
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:32,520
The castle is too far 
 to race the sunrise.

578
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:37,800
We will rest here the day 
 and--and travel by night.

579
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:13,840
Fear not pretty one, soon your 
 mortal feelings will cease to

580
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,040
cause you pain.

581
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:47,680
If what you say is true, the 
 vampire Radu is here in

582
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,840
Bucharest and your sister 
 is his disciple.

583
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,840
Hey, come on, you guys.

584
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,520
You're getting a little 
 carried away.

585
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,040
Look, what we should do is call 
 Lieutenant Marin and get

586
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,160
him over here.

587
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,320
And we'll tell him 
 the whole story.

588
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,240
Oh yeah, he'd really 
 believe us.

589
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,880
I'm not even sure I do.

590
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,400
My point exactly.

591
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,040
Look, there's got to be a 
 rational explanation here.

592
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,840
I mean, this is reality.

593
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,000
Vampires don't exist.

594
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,080
There was blood all over her.

595
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:19,600
She said she killed someone 
 and drank his blood.

596
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,840
I'm sorry, I don't buy it.

597
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,040
The man who took her, 
 he looked like

598
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,320
some kind of ghoul.

599
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,320
It was the same man we 
 saw at the castle.

600
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:37,240
I read last night, the 
 legends of Vladislav.

601
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:41,640
There is the story about the 
 sorcerer, [inaudible], consort

602
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:48,000
to King Vlad and mother to Radu, 
 who was entombed alive

603
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,760
in a forest near Bucharest.

604
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:58,040
If indeed Radu is stalking 
 Bucharest, this may be the

605
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,720
place that he will sleep.

606
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,920
Will you show us where 
 it is professor?

607
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,040
Of course.

608
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,440
I will accompany you.

609
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:14,320
The tools of the fearless 
 vampire hunter.

610
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,680
We should need them 
 for our adventure.

611
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,120
Are you coming, my friend?

612
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,920
Vampire hunting?

613
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,240
Afraid not, professor.

614
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,560
Look, Rebecca, I like you.

615
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,760
And I know this has been a 
 terrible strain on you.

616
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,200
And I want to help you 
 any way I can.

617
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,280
But I'm also here representing 
 the US State Department.

618
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:43,600
And what you two are proposing 
 to do, it's just plain nuts.

619
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,080
The bloodstone, the legend, the 
 empty grave, what does it

620
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,800
take to convince you?

621
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,200
Call me when you come 
 to your senses.

622
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,920
You think this is crazy, professor?

623
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,160
Well, yes, a little.

624
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:33,080
Because you don't believe me?

625
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:36,160
No, because I do believe you.

626
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,800
Here lies a prison 
 of the damned.

627
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,360
No man shall enter the gate, nor 
 commune with inhabitants

628
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,760
of this unholy place.

629
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,560
Maybe Mel was right.

630
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,520
Maybe we should just 
 call the police.

631
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,800
There is nothing to fear 
 in the daylight.

632
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,720
Oh my god.

633
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:41,280
Heaven help us.

634
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,480
It's true.

635
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,760

But fear and suffering are the 
 true pleasures for such as we.

663
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:27,840
There's vessel here which 
 feeds the leg.

 like a fountain.

Give me the dagger fledgling.

673
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,720
It's a magical object.

674
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,800
You must never, ever touch it.

675
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,760
Give it to me.

676
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,560

 her in ways that
