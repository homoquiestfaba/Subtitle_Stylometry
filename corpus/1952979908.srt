l guess this

is human after all.

91

'Cause l'm going
into the [indistinct]

93

Apparently, Mr. K.,

of these things
in existence.

95
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,380
lt's like ultra rare
Holy Grail shit.
Right, Tobes?

96
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,592
Yeah, this being
the last hurrah and all
is the best time as ever

97
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,345
to unleash the terror,
the blood,
the boobs!

98
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,929
More blood!
More boobs!

99
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,223
Hurray for boobs.

100
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,351
What was it like
working here,
l mean,

101
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,353
Hog heaven, right?

102
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,938
No, nerdgasm.
l saw the movie
Hungry Hungry Hippos

103
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,732
1 3 times!

104
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,610
l see
no nutritional value
in that whatsoever.

105
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,362
Hey, you asked!
And besides,

106
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,946
it gave
you an excuse
to almost talk

107
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,448
to a certain
concession employee.

108
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,033
Wait. Almost?

109
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,118
So you
haven't even like--

110
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,745
No. Okay?
We haven't even.

111
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,914
We're taking it slow.

112
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,875
Mm-hm. And by "slow"
he means turn the other
way and walk fast.

113
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,794
So you haven't
even talked to her?

114
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,629
lt's like this.

115
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,965
A girl like Desi
is never gonna
go out with me

116
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,884
so l figure, why not
hold on to the hope

117
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,427
instead of suffer
the disappointment?

118
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,804
You should
at least talk to her

119
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,430
before you go
back to school.

120
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,474
At least
then you could
make a piece.

121
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,142
Yeah, look who's
talking potsy!

122
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,977
Well, what the fuck
does that mean?

123
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,312
Oh, nothing.

124
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,106
Yeah, nothing, just--

125
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,108
Look, Kevin Bacon
and Elvis Presley.

There you go, kids.

Oh, l'll lighten

when the bulldozzers

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,102
So remind me
why we're here
instead of Schneideman's.

143
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,645
Because l pulled
the short straw

144
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,355
and got stuck
with baby sitting duty.

145
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,482

[horn honking]

147
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,278
Until then, l
gotta keep an eye
on the old man

148
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,612
make sure he doesn't
pull any shenanigans.

149
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,489
Well, Mr. Sourpuss.

150
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,950

l don't know, Orson.

158
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,990
Looks like last licks
for us oId bones.

159
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:16,077
l'm gonna miss all this.

160
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,331
This was my favorite part.

161
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,959
The preparation
and anticipation.

162
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:27,172
The threading,
spIicing the reeIs,

163
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,758
and always racing the clock.

164
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,553
Betty and l , we never
missed a single listing.

165
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,182
ln the gate
and don't be late.

166
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,228
You taught me that.

167
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,438
My rosebud.

168
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,399
Well, who needs
to be on time now

169
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,277
when you've got
demanding video

170
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,279
and high definition crap?

171
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,950
You can get anytime at home.

172
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,245
Who needs the old
night out under the stars

173
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,413
with some movie magic anymore?

174
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,458
That's what you
were all about. Right?

175
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,546
Magic tricks
and slight of hand.

176
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,799
Nobody cares
for magic anymore.

177
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,051
Nope.
[sighing]

178
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,387
The world gets smaller.

179
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,472
And soul mates fade away

180
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,059
Iike oId Kodak fiIm stock.

181
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,686
But nothing's gonna stop me

182
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,230
from sharing a bit
of that magic tonight!

183
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,941
Right?
[chuckling]

184
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,736
But, much like anything else--

00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,905

187
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,581
Now she's gone.

188
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,418
Now this pIace
is pretty much gone.

189
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,298
And like tomorrow,

190
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,718
I may be gone, too.

191
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,597
Fade to black. Right?
[chuckling]

192
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,850
Or maybe a smash cut!
[laughing]

[door bangs open]

194
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,146
Jumping Jesus!

195
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,315
Heart hopping Christ,
you're Iate, man.

196
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,317
Sorry, boss, l've been, uh,

197
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,028
l've been dealing with some--
[coughing]

198
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,696
Family matters.

199
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,865
Well, there's no need
for excuses now,

200
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,284
l'm already done
threading the first film.

201
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,870
Good God, man!

202
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,372
What have you been
sticking your dick into?

203
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,874
You look like hell
on a hand grenade.

204
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,084
l've been under the weather.

205
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,129
Look, why don't you
just go check in
with concessions,

206
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,714
see if Desi needs some help?

207
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,466
Sounds good. Okay.

208
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,051
And for Christ's sake, man,

209
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,387

lt's your old friend,

00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,505
Yes, my ghouIs and gaIs,

[horns honking]

223
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:27,060
Sit back, poke a hole
in the bottom of your
pop-corn bag,

224
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,146
cuddle up
to the closest corpse

225
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,191
and prepare yourself

226
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,819

Excuse me, Dr. Weems.

236
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,746
Miles Munson's
lab work is ready.

237
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,706
Tell him l'll be right in.

238
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,416
[whispering]
Okay.

239
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,086
(Miles)
l never heard
of a sperm bank

240
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,629
turning anyone
down before.

241
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,214
You can imagine
my nervousness

242
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,216
when they suggested
l see a urologist.

243
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,051
lt isn't anything
serious, is it?

244
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,428
Life-threatening, no.

245
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,764
As a matter
of concern, yes.

246
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,934
Have a look
in there, Miles.

247
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,440
(Miles)
Wow! Look
at them aII go.

248
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,486
(doctor)
That is an exampIe
or normaI sperm.

249
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,656
And that
is your sperm.

250
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,618
[ominous music]

251
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,536

[suspenseful chord]

253
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,373
That doesn't look good.

254
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:17,712
Miles, there's
a new medication l'd
like to suggest you try.

255
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,632
lt's called
Spermupermine.

256
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,552
Now, it can't increase
the sperm you generate

257
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,471
but what it can do,

258
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,182
is strengthen the sperm
you already produce.

259
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,892
Spermupermine?

260
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,896
Yes. lt hasn't been
approved by the FDA yet,

261
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,524
but it is available
to test subjects.

262
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,610
Luckily for you,
l'm on the research board.

Uh, morning, Larry.

287
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,015
Hey, you still
single, buddy?

288
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,766
Unfortunately.

289
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,852
My wife's
college roommate
just got divorced

290
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,645
and moved to town.
Perfect for you.

291
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,397
You should
take her to dinner
tomorrow night.

292
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,149
Absolutely not.
No way, no more
blind dates.

293
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,109
Not after last time.

294
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,570
Come on, she's perfect.
You should just do
this, okay?

295
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,906
She's cute.
She's not looking
for anything serious.

296
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,074
Just a little
companionship.
You know?

Come here.

l just had a horrible
shooting pain
in my balls.

308
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,344
You think you
sat on your balls

l don't know.

310
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,556
Oh! You twisted the veins
in your testicles.

No, l'm all right.

Ugh. l just need
a little bit of air.

334
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,707
l'm sorry. Excuse me
for one second.

335
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,208
l don't know

with the pills
that you gave me,

337
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,337

the least bit aroused

through my testicles.

340
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,304

00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,073
l think so.

346
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,412
Give me the sample, Miles,

347
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,247

under the microscope
right away.

00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,876
l don't think you're
gonna need a microscope.

What's wrong with me?

353
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,850
It's impossibIe,
but it wouId appear

354
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,895
that the Spermupermine
has had an adverse
effect on your system.

355
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,939
It's not onIy strengthening
your spermatozzoa

356
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,524

to gargantuan proportions.

358
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,114
And traditionaIIy, when
a man experiences arousaI,

359
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,950
his testicles produce
more sperm.

360

362
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,455

363
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,707

for analysis.

368
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,890
Discontinue use
of the medication immediately.

lf you feel your
sperm enIarging again

370
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,229
you get it out of your

May l use your bathroom

388
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,112
Of course.

Hon, Louise says
that Miles showed
up at her door,

398
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,811

screaming. Wha--

(Larry)
Louise, Miles twisted a vein

He feeIs bad about it.
Don't make a fuss
over it.

He's a good guy.

Testicles can't.

540
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,038
Now that's for sure.

541
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:32,418

[panting]
Oh, my God.

(TV presenter)
This just in.
The tadpoIe-Iike creature

546
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,181
is running rampant
as it heads downtown.

547
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,560
Five are dead aIready
and unconfirmed reports

548
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,396
claim the slimy beast
is now the sizze
of a house

549
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,148
and growing!

550
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,775
Military leaders
are described as "testy"

551
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,612
when asked how to defend
against this gargantuan goo.

552
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,781
The military
is doing its best

553
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,910
to determine
what it would take
to rub one out of this sizze.

554
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,579
What are we
gonna do?

555
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,415
We gotta get
the authorities.
Come on!

556
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,626
Citizzens are asked
to use whatever
protection they can

557
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,087
and avoid the creature's
immediate vicinity

558
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,757
which authorities
are calling,
"the wet spot".

559

at the epicenter
of the crisis zzone

564
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,277
with a sperm creature
which has now risen
to five stories high

565
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,614
and apparently still growing
has been wreaking havoc
on New York.

566
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,992
The Mayor is insisting
that all New Yorkers
remain in their homes

567
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,828
until further--
Oh, my God.

568

577
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,410
The spermicide is having
absolutely no effect.

578
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,412
What does this
sperm want, doc?

579
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,249
What every sperm
wants, General.
To fertilizze an ovum!

580
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,584
There's not an ovum
on God's green earth

581
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,419
big enough
for that thing.

582

(Miles)
Wait! I just
figured it out.

583
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,631
The Statue
of Liberty.

584
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,092

my latest and greatest
moving picture.

1397
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:01,765
A film so scandalous,
so intense,

1398
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:04,017
that it was banned
from every film festival

1399
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:05,435
in fear of mass hysteria,

1400
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,604

Deathication,

1404
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:15,445
comes with a very
serious warning.

1405
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,405
This film
was specifically produced

1406
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:20,033
to elicit the effect
of pure terror on the audience

1407
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:22,035
to a complete
and total sensory immersion

1408
01:32:22,119 --> 01:32:23,703
to the images on screen

1409
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,414
using the latest
in cinematic technology.

1410

The lights of which
we can have revealed here

1411
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:30,835
in fear
of government confiscation.

1412
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,964
The following visuals
printed on this very
film stock

1413
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:37,259

visceral, biological response

in the human nervous system
in the most,

01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:41,221
hm, nefarious of ways.

of inflamed anal tissue

1437
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:36,359
similar,
to the effects of sodomy.

1438

will rape you
with your own feces.

1440
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:42,616
And that, my friends,

1441
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:46,202

the horrific effects
of, Deathication.

1602
01:42:56,503 --> 01:42:58,171
What the hell
is going on?

1603
01:42:58,213 --> 01:43:01,048
When there's no
more room left in hell,

1604
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:02,842
"The dead
shall fuck the earth."

1605
01:43:02,885 --> 01:43:05,553
Or something like that,
it's like,

1606
01:43:05,637 --> 01:43:06,846
with the final reel.

1607
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:08,097

1612
01:43:16,815 --> 01:43:18,482
Here you go, kid.

1613
01:43:18,567 --> 01:43:19,942
Six rounds wiII

1614
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:21,277
(Mayna)
What about you?

1615
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:22,820
Don't worry about me.

1616
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:24,697
Now you came

1617
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:26,908
Yeah, hopefully
Ryan stayed in the car.

1618
01:43:26,992 --> 01:43:29,118
He's got the keys.

1619
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:31,037
Get back to your car,

1620
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:33,873

and drive fast.

1621
01:43:33,957 --> 01:43:36,209
What do we tell him?

1622
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:37,793
Tell them whatever!

1623
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,795
Tell them to bring
the cops, the army,

1624
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,089
the goddamn hazzmat suits.
Bring them all!

1625
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:44,050

What was it
you said, Orson?

1633
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:16,374
Nobody who takes on
anything big and tough

1634
01:44:16,458 --> 01:44:18,751
can afford to be modest.

1635
01:44:18,835 --> 01:44:20,795

1676
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:12,281
Well, the best we could
do is use it on us.

1677
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,408
Before we become zzombies.

1678
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:17,536

Now put
the gun on my head
and pull the trigger.

1685
01:46:36,431 --> 01:46:38,682
The bullet should
take us both out.

What? ls that the best
idea you've got?

Why's that?

Fantastic! Now
that's an ending.

1767
01:51:01,905 --> 01:51:03,072
Fuck Hollywood!

1768
01:51:03,156 --> 01:51:04,740
Really? Boring.

1769
01:51:04,824 --> 01:51:05,866
Boring?

1770
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:07,409
Not enough tits.

1771
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:09,745
Actually, it was
kinda bittersweet.

1772
01:51:09,829 --> 01:51:12,164
You know?
Like the ending of E.T.

1773
01:51:12,248 --> 01:51:14,375
Why does everything
gotta be E.T. with you?

1774
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:15,584
Come on. Let's go.

1775
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:17,252
E.T.'s gay.

1776
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:20,506
How-- He's a plant.

1777
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:23,008
He can't be gay.
He's a pla--
He's a plant.

1778
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:25,052
Would you be gay
if you were a plant?

1779
01:51:25,136 --> 01:51:27,429
[IiveIy music]

1780
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:44,154
[screaming]

[hard rock music]

1782
01:52:12,559 --> 01:52:14,727
lt is
a biological anomaly

1783
01:52:14,811 --> 01:52:18,147
the likes of which
the medical community
has never seen.

1784
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:20,441
Miles' unique
body chemistry

1785
01:52:20,525 --> 01:52:22,901
clashed with the Plutoneide
and the Spermupermine

1786
01:52:22,944 --> 01:52:25,696
mutating his spermatozzoa
during spermatogenesis

1787
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:28,073
in a way that no one
could've expected.

1788
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:29,950
Spermatium are
by their very nature

1789
01:52:30,034 --> 01:52:32,411
a very determined
and resilient organism

1790
01:52:32,454 --> 01:52:35,080
genetically programmed
to overcome all obstacles

1791
01:52:35,165 --> 01:52:37,249
defy all odds
and hit the target.

1792
01:52:37,333 --> 01:52:39,668
or die trying.

1793
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:41,003
Perhaps--

1794
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:43,088
You can view
this disaster

1795
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:45,799
as a kind
of cautionary tale

1796
01:52:45,884 --> 01:52:48,594
against the misuse
of a yet to be
fully understood

1797
01:52:48,636 --> 01:52:50,929
era in atomic energy.

1798
01:52:51,014 --> 01:52:53,432
God help us all.
