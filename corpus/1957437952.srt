00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,831
Hmm...

4
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,703
Something different
about you today.

5
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:05,906
You did something
with your hair?

6
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:08,975
Those new pajamas?

7
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,847
Feet look bigger.

8
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,582
You look taller.

9
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:16,583
What is it?

10
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:17,584
Huh.

11
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:20,087
It's your birthday.

12
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:21,855
The big 1-2.

13
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:23,990
Happy birthday, kiddo.

14
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:26,927
Wow, you look older,
you look wiser.

15
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:28,462
Thank you, dad.

16
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,398
That's a fast 12 years.

17
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:35,402
Alright, why don't you go
get ready for school,

18
00:01:35,404 --> 00:01:36,837
and then you can help me
with the decorations

19
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:39,039
for your party.

20
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,907
I can't wait for my party.

21
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:01,695
We're doing it, captain.

22
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,966
Oh!

23
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,872
Look at how I tied that one now.

24
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:16,042
Oh, oh, ew.

25
00:02:24,987 --> 00:02:25,986
(Laughs)

26
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:29,923
Yeah.

27
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:33,894
So, well,
I talked to your teacher

28
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:35,495
and he talked to all parents

29
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:38,532
and there are no allergies,
so you feel free

30
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,767
to pass these bad boys out
at recess.

31
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,736
Are you sure?

32
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,906
I mean,
I hardly know these kids.

33
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:47,707
Well, I know
that you're the new kid,

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,777
but cupcakes are the fast track
to friendship.

35
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,913
Plus, they all RSVPed
to your party already,

36
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:56,216
so they're coming, you know,
sounds like friendship to me.

37
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,651
I know.

38
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:00,787
Alright, it's time to boogie,
birthday girl.

39
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,556
Alright? Before the bus comes.

40
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,990
Thanks for everything.

41
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:05,625
The place looks great, dad.

42
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:07,194
I can't wait for later.

43
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:08,929
You're welcome.

44
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:11,565
Yeah, well, you know what
we have time for though?

45
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,800
Oh, no, the bear got out.

46
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,874
(Growling & grunting)

47
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:27,147
(♪♪♪♪♪)

48
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,251
Ah, good morning, Mr. Jay.

49
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:06,753
Salutations, Barry, my boy.

50
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,121
Well, just as you'd like it
two creams.

51
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,623
Ooh, perfect.

52
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,258
And uh, a few sugars
we won't mention.

53
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,292
Oh, I know you better
than that.

54
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,960
(Mr. Jay laughs)

55
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,929
Alright, well,
here's today's paper as well.

56
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:18,532
You don't happen to have
tomorrow's, do you?

57
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:19,966
Huh?

58
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,636
- Oh.
- (Laughing)

59
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,972
How dare you?

60
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,874
- It's perfect.
- BARRY: Oh.

61
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:31,111
You always go the extra mile
to take such good care of us.

62
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:33,947
Commendable, my boy,
commendable!

63
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:38,084
I always say try your best
and you'll be your best.

64
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:41,187
Enjoy this fine, fine morning,
Bartholomew.

65
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:43,089
Enjoy your walk, Mr. Jay.

66
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,198
Ms. Ashcroft, good morning!

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,700
Ah, Pepper, hi.

68
00:04:53,702 --> 00:04:55,001
MS. ASHCROFT:
I got any packages?

69
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,804
Let me check.

70
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:03,610
Um, no, no,
it's not looking like it.

71
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:06,012
That's funny,
I'm expecting something.

72
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,347
Well, I will keep my eye out
for you.

73
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,182
- Mhmm.
- And also, Ms. Ashcroft, um,

74
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,351
we have to keep Pepper
on a leash.

75
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,053
Look, I'm sorry.
It's a building policy.

76
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:16,089
Yeah, next time.

77
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,759
(Sighs)

78
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:22,996
MS. ASHCROFT:
Oops. (Laughing)

79
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,967
When you gotta go,
you gotta go, right?

80
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:29,102
I'll clean it up.

81
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:30,270
Let me know about that package.

82
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:31,371
Will do.

83
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:34,874
Phew.

84
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:42,315
An accident?

85
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:46,219
BARRY: Uh, yeah, well, it appears that Ms.
Ashcroft's dog,

86
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,722
Pepper, um, had too much coffee.

87
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,224
(Laughs)

88
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,892
See you later, pal.

89
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,029
Oh, by the way,
you haven't seen

90
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:58,098
that little Miss Fix It
around here, have you?

91
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,165
Huh?

92
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,801
The uh, the maintenance guy.

93
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:04,938
He's not exactly
a maintenance guy.

94
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,640
That's Jess.

95
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:07,407
Terrific.

96
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,408
Have you seen her?

97
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,076
Nope.

98
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,144
But if you needed some help
with something,

99
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:12,746
I'm glad to do it.

100
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,180
If your air conditioning
is broken, I can fix it.

101
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:15,915
Thank you. No, I wanted...

102
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,886
I wanted to introduce myself
to the young lady.

103
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:21,821
Yeah, yeah, I can't help you
with that.

104
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:22,789
RICK:
Okay.

105
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,058
You missed a spot.

106
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,860
BARRY:
Oh, thanks, Rick.

107
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:27,727
I'm your friend.

108
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,129
Yes, you are.

109
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:33,066
Yeah. Watch your step, yeah.
Watch your step.

110
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,737
(Gasps)

111
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:38,738
Hi, Bianca.

112
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,440
What happened here?

113
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,976
Well, Ms. Ashcroft's dog,
Pepper,

114
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:44,044
apparently couldn't hold it.

115
00:06:44,046 --> 00:06:45,412
Well, I'm glad to see

116
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:47,147
you're on top of these things,
Barry,

117
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,982
'cause corporate's
been hinting at an inspection.

118
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:51,451
So I need this place to look
spotless at all times.

119
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,819
You understand?

120
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,688
Especially, the lobby,

121
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,190
'cause it's the first place
they walk in and we always...

122
00:06:57,192 --> 00:07:00,093
Always make
a good first impression.

123
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,796
You know, you have it
pretty good here, Barry.

124
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,030
BARRY:
Yep.

125
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:06,399
Flexible hours,
a short commute.

126
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,034
And let's face it,
you get to live in a building

127
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:12,338
that you could never afford
to live in.

128
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,041
So many perks to this job.

129
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:19,179
Well, that's why I plan
on working really hard

130
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:21,114
at keeping the job.

131
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:22,415
That's great.

132
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,367
Uh-uh. No, no.

133
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:45,872
Come on. Come on. Come on.

134
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,307
JESS:
Surprise.

135
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:48,475
Got you a coffee.

136
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:52,145
Oh, well, thank you very much.

137
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:53,947
Perfect timing,
we just ran out.

138
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,349
Oh well, just a little thank you
for showing me the ropes.

139
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,419
It's not exactly easy
being the new girl.

140
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,321
Yeah, well, my daughter
is the new girl in the school,

141
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:03,423
so I totally get it.

142
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:05,859
Well, she's really lucky
to have a cool dad like you

143
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,893
to help her through it.

144
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,261
I don't know about cool,

145
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:09,996
but we're definitely
making it through.

146
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:10,930
Uh, today's her birthday.

147
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,298
Aww.

148
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,867
Well, to the birthday new girl.

149
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,001
To the birthday new girl.

150
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,375
So, um...

151
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,878
Where do you like to go
when you go out around here?

152
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,479
I'm still kind of exploring.

153
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:28,114
Uh, uh...

154
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,086
Um, well, to tell you the truth,

155
00:08:33,088 --> 00:08:35,388
um, other than the little market
around the corner,

156
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,457
I don't think I've been out
since I've been here.

157
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:40,093
- What?
- Yeah.

158
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,429
Well, uh, we definitely need
to change that.

159
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:45,231
You think so?

160
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,432
I'm gonna go try out
that new deli tomorrow night.

161
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:48,234
You should totally come
with me.

162
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,809
Uh, look, I would love to,
but I can't.

163
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,577
It's... it's Emily.

164
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,578
Oh.

165
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,347
No, my daughter, Emily.

166
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,449
It... it's a little thing
we do every week.

167
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:04,584
It's a little
father-daughter thing.

168
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,152
It's kind of... Taco Tuesdays.

169
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:08,321
Totally get it.

170
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:10,323
BIANCA: <i>Barry, Mrs.
Bettencourt needs help with the groceries</i>

171
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:12,926
<i>in the garage. ASAP.</i>

172
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:16,329
Copy that, Bianca.
I'll be right there.

173
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,033
Thank you for the coffee.

174
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:23,369
I'm coming.

175
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,948
They're for everyone.
Feel free.

176
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:40,954
- Wow, love the frosting.
- Thanks.

177
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,155
Me and my dad made them.

178
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:43,523
ALEX:
Hmm, in that case,

179
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,458
I can't wait to try the cake
later.

180
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,160
- You're coming?
- Yep.

181
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,028
My mom said I could leave
my piano lessons early.

182
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,163
Oh, hey, birthday girl.

183
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,267
- Do you want a cupcake?
- No, thanks.

184
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:55,635
This dress was really expensive

185
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,604
and I don't wanna get
anything on it.

186
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:59,038
How about you two?

187
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,506
They're really good.

188
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:04,911
It's really cute that
you brought cupcakes though.

189
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:07,146
I remember I did that
for my birthday one time.

190
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,414
In kindergarten.

191
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:11,484
Never too old for cupcakes.

192
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,952
That's what I always say.

193
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:15,555
ANNE:
But thanks for the invite.

194
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:18,157
Oh, I saw you RSVPed,
I'm glad you can make it.

195
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,193
We wouldn't miss a chance
to welcome a new member

196
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:21,127
into the group.

197
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,929
Should be fun.

198
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:25,565
I got a lot of snacks and games,
and I have a piٌata.

199
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,267
That sounds amazing.

200
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,202
(Mr. Alpert whistles)

201
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:32,005
Alright, let's get back inside,
everyone!

202
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,673
It's mind mode in time!

203
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,275
Oohhoo.

204
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:46,286
(♪♪♪♪♪)

205
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:48,154
(Grunts)

206
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:49,622
You still got it.

207
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:54,627
(Door closes)

208
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,930
Hey, birthday girl.

209
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,233
Well...

210
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:01,567
How did it go?

211
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:02,635
Great.

212
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:04,170
The cupcakes were a big hit.

213
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:05,505
Alex took three of them.

214
00:11:05,507 --> 00:11:07,073
Awesome.

215
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,541
And I scored a goal in practice.

216
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,243
Of course, you scored a goal
in practice.

217
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:11,311
You know why?

218
00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:13,980
Because you're a monster.

219
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:17,417
(Grunting)

220
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:20,320
Well, in that case, I think
that's good cause for, uh,

221
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:22,255
an early birthday present.

222
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:24,290
I mean, I know you're supposed
to wait until you cut the cake

223
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,292
usually, but what do you say
we...

224
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:27,627
(Clicks tongue)

225
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:29,562
...bend the rules a little bit?

226
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,231
Yeah? You think so?

227
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,135
Hmm. Nah. I think it's better
to actually...

228
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:37,236
Oh, okay, well, oh well.

229
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:42,608
(♪♪♪♪♪)

230
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,611
(♪♪♪♪♪)

231
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:47,347
It's the one in the window.

232
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:48,982
Yeah, well, you know,

233
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:50,383
you wouldn't stop
talking about it every time

234
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,452
we went by the store,
so I figured, mmm,

235
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:54,354
what the heck.

236
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:56,322
It'd be a good party dress
for you.

237
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:57,423
Can I wear it tonight?

238
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,225
Of course.

239
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:00,660
Go put it on, your friends
are gonna be here soon.

240
00:12:00,662 --> 00:12:03,529
I can't believe this dress
is actually mine.

241
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:04,630
Put it on.

242
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:16,376
Hmm.

243
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,583
Shouldn't they be here by now?

244
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:26,352
I don't... look, maybe
they're just fashionably late.

245
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:31,791
No, no,
they're not fashionably late.

246
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,459
They are definitely late.

247
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:38,364
They looked at me straight
in the eyes

248
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:39,766
and said they were coming.

249
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:42,335
Well, uh...

250
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:44,103
Things happen, you know.

251
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:47,774
Maybe they had a hard time
getting a ride or may...

252
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:50,209
maybe they got abducted
by aliens.

253
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:51,778
All of them?

254
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,213
Uh, kids are funny
when it comes

255
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:55,748
to adjusting to new people.

256
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:59,485
Alright?

257
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,320
You've only been here
a couple of weeks.

258
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:05,591
It's my fault.

259
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:07,693
It's bad timing, I'm sorry.

260
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,231
Yeah, but I don't get
why they lied.

261
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:16,536
That's what kids do when they
don't know what else to do.

262
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,806
But you know what?

263
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:23,109
It's not too late for us
to have some fun.

264
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,811
Alright? Let's enjoy this.

265
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:27,180
I'm not gonna let
a bunch of kids get us down.

266
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:31,350
You like cake, I think.

267
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,518
Oh, I know you like cake,
'cause you're my kid.

268
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,220
And I like cake.

269
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:36,155
So you must like cake.
Do you want some cake?

270
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:37,590
Yeah, I guess I like cake.

271
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:38,691
That's the spirit.

272
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,326
You like wishes too, right?

273
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:42,595
Who doesn't like wishes?

274
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:45,598
Well, then let's have some cake
and make some wishes, baby.

275
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:52,138
Okay, dad.

276
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:58,711
Happy Birthday, dear Emily,

277
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:03,249
happy birthday to you.

278
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,488
Woah, nice lung capacity.

279
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,822
What are you,
a trumpet player now?

280
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,825
Alright, it's time to do
the honors.

281
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:14,327
Come on, cut the cake.

282
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:15,661
Okay, wish time, right?

283
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:17,864
It's wish time.
Anything you want.

284
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,704
Alright, yeah.

285
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:27,540
First piece goes
to the birthday girl.

286
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,910
(Knock on door)

287
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:35,148
That must be Alex.

288
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,582
Oh, good.

289
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,551
We're gonna need some help
with that cake.

290
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,461
- Hey.
- BARRY: Alex, my man.

291
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:50,396
Welcome to the party, pal.

292
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,832
Thanks, Mr. B.

293
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,300
- Happy birthday again.
- Thanks.

294
00:14:54,302 --> 00:14:55,401
Sorry, I'm late.

295
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:57,403
Piano lessons took forever!

296
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,211
Hey, where is everyone?

297
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:06,779
It's okay, who needs 'em?

298
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,681
My real friend's here.

299
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:09,782
More cake for me.

300
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,584
And you get an H.

301
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:12,785
Look how lucky you are.

302
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,953
ALEX:
Yum.

303
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,655
- Ice cream?
- ALEX: Duh.

304
00:15:15,657 --> 00:15:16,923
(Laughs)

305
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:18,758
I like this kid.

306
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,660
I like this kid. Alright.

307
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:40,379
(Sobs)

308
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,484
Emily!

309
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,686
Emily!

310
00:15:49,691 --> 00:15:52,358
Hey.

311
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,694
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what's wrong?

312
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,762
What's going on?

313
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:57,930
This.

314
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:04,370
(Sobbing)

315
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:08,841
Hey, listen.
These kids are...

316
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,576
Uh, look...

317
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:17,350
Just let this be
a valuable life lesson.

318
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:21,654
What, that it stinks
to be the new kid?

319
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:24,257
No, it's way more important
than that.

320
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:28,494
Oh, yeah, what?

321
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:30,429
It's about...

322
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:31,864
(Sighs)

323
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:32,965
When...

324
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:36,669
When it... when it...

325
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:42,541
When it comes to friendship,
it's way more about quality.

326
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:46,646
Not quantity.

327
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:48,347
You understand?

328
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:53,052
Yeah, but what am I supposed
to do about them?

329
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,654
You're supposed to ignore 'em.

330
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:56,722
That's what bullies do.

331
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,992
Yeah, bullies, they can't wait
to get a rise out of you.

332
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:01,761
I mean, nothing makes
them happier than seeing

333
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:05,631
the result of their actions.

334
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,833
And seeing how you respond
to it, right?

335
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:08,968
So the best thing
that you can do

336
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,770
is you just don't respond.

337
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:13,773
You just ignore them.

338
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,541
It drives them crazy.

339
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:16,942
And as soon as they realize
they can't get a rise

340
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:18,577
out of you,
they leave you alone.

341
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:23,649
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

342
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:25,685
Yeah, it makes sense.

343
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:27,887
Hey, and also check this out.

344
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:36,395
Look, from what I can tell,
you and your friend,

345
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:39,398
your real friend, Alex,
had a great time tonight.

346
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:42,802
Yeah, I guess
that was pretty fun.

347
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:44,403
Yeah, it was fun.

348
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:49,542
(Barry laughs)

349
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,745
Thanks for making me
feel better.

350
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:59,518
Look, I'm really, really proud
of you for toughing it out

351
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,654
through the rough patches.

352
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:03,522
It's all gonna get better soon,
I promise.

353
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:06,692
Yeah, it was actually
what I wished for.

354
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:10,563
Oh, don't tell me
what you wished for.

355
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:11,931
It won't come true.

356
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:16,035
Oh.

357
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:19,705
Would you look at that,
it's 12:01.

358
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:21,774
Another year gone by.

359
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:25,444
Thanks for everything, dad.

360
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:28,381
You're welcome.

361
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:31,984
Hey, I love you.

362
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,988
Happy birthday.

363
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,925
Boop.

364
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,000
Go to bed.

365
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,835
Happy birthday!

366
00:18:53,908 --> 00:19:01,013
(♪♪♪♪♪)

367
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:05,551
Emily, get out here,
it's an emergency.

368
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:07,887
What, what? What's wrong?

369
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:09,555
Well, uh...

370
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,193
You know how usually
on your birthday,

371
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,896
I give you an early present
and then... and then...

372
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:18,931
and then
I give you a late present.

373
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:21,700
This year, uh, I'm just...
I'm just so sorry.

374
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,538
I... I just couldn't help it.

375
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,707
An electric guitar!

376
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,509
Now we can really jam.

377
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,781
Hey, you stuck with it
on the acoustic and I told you,

378
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:39,018
if you worked hard, you'd get
an electric soon, so yeah.

379
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,186
(Laughs)

380
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:42,755
Yeah!

381
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,992
(Grunts)

382
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,833
Who puts a package there?

383
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,179
"To a deserving gentleman."

384
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:13,786
(♪♪♪♪♪)

385
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:43,682
Hmm.

386
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:46,986
Must be made in Italy.

387
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,922
Hmm.

388
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,929
Well, hello there.

389
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:06,772
(Clicks tongue)

390
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,576
Oh.

391
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:17,650
Bianca.

392
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:23,789
Morning, Mr. Jay.

393
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,090
Late for work, gotta go.

394
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:28,627
Handsome chapeau, monsieur,
tre bien.

395
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:30,129
Bend those knees.

396
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:31,630
I'd race you,

397
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:34,066
but it would be embarrassing
for you.

398
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,634
(Laughs)

399
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:44,009
Nice of you to join us, Barry.

400
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,644
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

401
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:47,046
Like, I... I got this
really random delivery

402
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:48,881
and I just...

403
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:51,684
You just thought you'd hold up
the entire staff meeting,

404
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:55,187
even though you literally live
six floors above our heads,

405
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,223
yet you somehow managed
to be late.

406
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:00,960
Yeah, like... like I said, guys,
I'm really sorry.

407
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:02,995
BIANCA: You're on very
thin ice and take off

408
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:04,296
that ridiculous hat.

409
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:06,665
Besides the fact
that it's horribly tacky,

410
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:09,735
we have a dress code
and I'd like you to follow it.

411
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:11,337
Will do.

412
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:13,038
BIANCA: I'm not gonna
sugarcoat this people,

413
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,374
the head honchos are coming in
from corporate

414
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,742
for the annual inspection,

415
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:18,077
- but we don't know when.
- (Gasps)

416
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:22,815
But rest assured, they'll come.

417
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:28,754
So I need you to stay alert,
because it's quite simple.

418
00:22:28,756 --> 00:22:33,158
If you let me down,
I'll let you go.

419
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,094
Okay?

420
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:36,261
Great.

421
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:50,109
Barry.

422
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:50,976
Quick question.

423
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:51,944
Yes, Rick.

424
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:54,713
If you're here...

425
00:22:54,715 --> 00:22:56,782
...who's running
the chocolate factory?

426
00:22:56,784 --> 00:22:59,051
Oh, that is a good one, Rick.

427
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:00,185
- That's good.
- Yeah.

428
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:01,854
Quite a statement, kid.

429
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,024
Say hi to the lollipop gang
for me.

430
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:06,959
The... that's...

431
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:10,396
It's a Lollipop Guild
and that's The Wizard of...

432
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:13,265
- I kinda like it.
- What?

433
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,867
- That hat.
- Huh?

434
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:17,069
It's you, it's very cool.

435
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:19,204
Oh, well.

436
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:21,040
- Check it out.
- Hmm?

437
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,043
Oh.

438
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:27,279
(Laughs)

439
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,714
So you do have some moves.

440
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:29,882
Yeah, I do have some moves.

441
00:23:29,884 --> 00:23:31,283
- Let me try this one.
- Uh-huh.

442
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,152
I'll probably screw it up,
but let's see.

443
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:36,455
Oh.

444
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,023
What?

445
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:39,858
That was very impressive.

446
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,062
You know, but, um,
I know a couple things, too.

447
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:44,329
I got a little something also.

448
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:46,165
Pah! Huh, huh?

449
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:47,266
Yeah, you do have some move.

450
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:48,333
We should form a team.

451
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:49,368
- We should.
- Yeah.

452
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,070
Alright, see you later.

453
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:52,171
Alright, I'll talk
to your people,

454
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:53,305
you talk to my people.

455
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,175
(Pepper barking)

456
00:23:56,177 --> 00:23:57,876
(Grunts)

457
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:04,316
Good morning, Ms. Ashcroft.

458
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,452
Is there something
I can help you with?

459
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:08,854
And also, I would really like
to thank you for keeping

460
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:10,155
little Pepper here
on the leash.

461
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,390
We really appreciate that.

462
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:12,825
Well, before you thank me
too much,

463
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,159
I just want you to know

464
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,894
that he got loose
for a little while.

465
00:24:17,198 --> 00:24:18,430
Oh, is he okay?

466
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,399
The dog's fine.

467
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:21,900
The alley, not so much.

468
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:23,068
He ripped up all the bags.

469
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,304
He made a real mess out there.

470
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:26,405
We'll take care of it.

471
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:27,272
MS. ASHCROFT:
You will?

472
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:30,042
Yeah, absolutely.

473
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:32,411
Pepper says he's very sorry.

474
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:33,345
Aren't you, Pepper?

475
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,413
Yes.

476
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:38,751
You have a good day.

477
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:43,522
How was school?

478
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,490
It was okay.

479
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:45,457
How's work been?

480
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:47,326
Uh, not too bad.

481
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:50,395
I got my last clean-up
of the day and then I'm finito.

482
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:51,897
I appreciate you hanging out
with me though.

483
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:53,031
Helps pass the time.

484
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,533
I like hanging out with you.

485
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,435
You're kind of a goof.

486
00:24:56,437 --> 00:24:57,402
Hey.

487
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:10,282
Thanks, Pepper.

488
00:25:12,787 --> 00:25:14,920
Do you need my help
with anything?

489
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:17,122
Uh, no, you sit this one out.

490
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:18,357
I'm going in.

491
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,458
Thanks.

492
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,408
Started 5:22.

493
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,211
This is Captain
Very Burdenedday,

494
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:41,480
at the USS Condo Elite.

495
00:25:41,482 --> 00:25:44,883
I've been sent on a mission
to the garbage,

496
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:50,422
to wrangle their dreaded
intergalactic trash monster.

497
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,496
Stop, stop.

498
00:25:57,498 --> 00:25:59,565
You stinky trash monster.

499
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:02,367
Oh, no, it's such
a stinky trash monster.

500
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:04,269
Oh, oh, never fear.

501
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,309
This garbage is no match
for my space sanitizer.

502
00:26:15,015 --> 00:26:18,116
(Laughs)

503
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:25,090
(♪♪♪♪♪)

504
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:28,360
Sir, it seems to be working.

505
00:26:28,362 --> 00:26:31,396
The... the... the... the...
the stench is eliminated.

506
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:34,399
And it smells so fresh
like clean cotton.

507
00:26:35,402 --> 00:26:36,869
(Laughs)

508
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,505
Alrighty.

509
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:42,407
Go do your homework.

510
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:44,943
I'll clock out
and meet you up there.

511
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,116
Bravo, Barry!

512
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:53,518
Bravo, my friend!

513
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,087
You had me worried there.

514
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:58,223
Those trash monsters
can be tricky.

515
00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,591
(Laughs)

516
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:03,195
Especially,
the wicked waste creature,

517
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:06,098
I hear he is the stinkiest.

518
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,267
Jeez. I had no idea
you were even there.

519
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:10,102
Well, I'm so glad I was.

520
00:27:10,104 --> 00:27:13,138
I never knew that you were
this witty and imaginative.

521
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,640
Yeah, well, you know,
when you have a job

522
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:16,575
as monotonous as mine,
you know, some fun

523
00:27:16,577 --> 00:27:18,243
it makes the day go by faster.

524
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:20,112
Well, it was very, very funny.

525
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:22,281
Well, I'm glad I could give you
a chuckle.

526
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:24,383
Have you ever thought
you may have missed

527
00:27:24,385 --> 00:27:28,553
your calling out here
performing for the swill cans?

528
00:27:28,555 --> 00:27:31,657
You have an innate ability
to share joy.

529
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:34,593
And that's in short supply
these days.

530
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:38,030
Well, I guess I have kind of
always been an entertainer.

531
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:41,033
And always loved theatre,
used to play the guitar

532
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,267
and write music.

533
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:44,937
You have the soul of an artist.

534
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:46,538
And... and so, then what?

535
00:27:48,142 --> 00:27:49,942
Life.

536
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:51,476
You know, I started a family,
had to get a real job.

537
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:52,678
Oh, poo!

538
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,413
Poo!

539
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:58,116
Never call never by its name
and it'll never show up.

540
00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:01,687
It's never too late to uh, make
a big change.

541
00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:04,589
You know, redefine yourself,
switch gears!

542
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:06,258
BIANCA:
<i>Barry, get up here. Pronto.</i>

543
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,726
<i>I have some potential tenants
here.</i>

544
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,594
- Duty calls.
- (Chuckles)

545
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:15,667
Barry, we need to find a way
to unleash your talent you know,

546
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:19,071
uh, to get you out there
where people can see you.

547
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,205
Come by my office.

548
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:22,307
Uh, pop in after work

549
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:25,143
and we can discuss
a possible career change.

550
00:28:25,145 --> 00:28:28,246
Oh, look I...
I appreciate the offer, but I...

551
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,247
BIANCA: <i>Barry,
I'm watching the street cameras</i>

552
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,016
and you're not moving!

553
00:28:31,018 --> 00:28:32,084
I'm coming.

554
00:28:34,154 --> 00:28:36,621
You know, on second thought,
I'll see you tomorrow.

555
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:39,691
Excellent.

556
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:41,360
(Chuckles)

557
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,197
We have a great community here.

558
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:47,366
Uh, we have great art pieces.

559
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:49,568
We have three condos up there.

560
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,504
Uh, our lounge, our bar area
is over here.

561
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:54,673
Uh, as you can tell, we have
restaurants and coffee shops

562
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:56,074
and all kinds
of wonderful things

563
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:57,542
like that over here.

564
00:28:57,544 --> 00:28:59,644
And, oh, you know,
what you're gonna like?

565
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:01,546
- Our spa.
- Yes.

566
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:02,748
Come check out the spa.

567
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:11,289
(♪♪♪♪♪)

568
00:29:37,117 --> 00:29:44,189
(♪♪♪♪♪)

569
00:29:56,236 --> 00:30:00,672
Bartholomew, my boy,
right on time.

570
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:04,709
Punctuality shows an appetite
for success.

571
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:05,811
The hat.

572
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:10,449
Barry, I happen to be
an excellent judge of character

573
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:14,319
and I see that you have a knack
with people.

574
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:17,589
No, I mean, the way that
you care for your daughter,

575
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:19,524
and the excellent job you do
around here,

576
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,660
the way you handle
that Gorgon of a boss,

577
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:23,395
you always have a smile
on your face

578
00:30:23,397 --> 00:30:25,363
for everybody who comes
through the door.

579
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,366
Most people would get cranky
and hard-edged,

580
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,402
but not you, my boy, not you.

581
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:32,137
But just, you know,

582
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:33,472
trying to turn a negative
into a positive, you know.

583
00:30:33,474 --> 00:30:34,773
I do.

584
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:36,608
I really do, Barry.

585
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,479
And that's why I think
the job I have in mind for you

586
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:44,249
is tailor made,
not to mention your name.

587
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:45,383
My name?

588
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,121
Bartholomew Barry Burtonday?

589
00:30:49,123 --> 00:30:51,289
It's so close to birthday,
you never noticed that?

590
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:53,625
Sorry, I'm so confused.

591
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,193
Wha... what's the job?

592
00:30:55,195 --> 00:31:00,232
Barry, welcome to my world.

593
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:01,600
I give you...

594
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:07,239
...the International
Birthday Network

595
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:11,810
or as we like to call it
"I.B.N."

596
00:31:11,812 --> 00:31:13,678
Everybody, say hello to Barry.

597
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,147
(Chuckles)

598
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:16,648
Hi.

599
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,718
What... what do the people
at IBN do?

600
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,255
Hank, put down the donuts.

601
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:28,727
Warm up that VCR
and cue up the intro tape.

602
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:30,629
Intro tape?

603
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:32,430
My boy.

604
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,199
This way.

605
00:31:34,201 --> 00:31:35,467
Follow me.

606
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:38,503
I'm so confused.

607
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,573
(Blowing dust)

608
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,785
Finn, you shouldn't have
expected the chickens to come.

609
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,920
They don't trust you.

610
00:31:54,922 --> 00:31:56,588
They think you wanna eat them.

611
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,622
Oh, hi.

612
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,391
We didn't see you come in.

613
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:00,559
Come on in, come on in,
you're always welcome.

614
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:01,893
That's you?

615
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:04,329
What?

616
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:05,564
MR. JAY: <i>For those of
you who haven't met...</i>

617
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:06,631
Wow.

618
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,733
I'm Mr. Jay.

619
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:10,268
Well,
that's what my friends call me

620
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,471
so you should, too, always.

621
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,840
I'm the emperor
of birthday land.

622
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:18,577
Hi, your excellency.

623
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:19,544
No, no, Finn.

624
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:20,879
No titles, no titles.

625
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:22,881
There's a time and place
for everything.

626
00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:26,651
This is my friend, Finn,
a little red Irish fox.

627
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,953
Well, top of the mornin' to ya.

628
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:30,889
(Indiscernible speech)

629
00:32:30,891 --> 00:32:32,857
Now I have a story about Finn.

630
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:35,760
Once upon a time,
it was Finn's birthday,

631
00:32:35,762 --> 00:32:38,830
so his best friend Loopy,
the Wolf invited

632
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:42,801
all the other wolves,
and the foxes, and the coyotes,

633
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:47,572
and the coywolves over
for a big, big party.

634
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:49,407
But none of them showed.

635
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,244
Aww, poor little guy.

636
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,012
It's heartbreaking.

637
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,547
Loopy called us

638
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:57,515
the International
Birthday Network,

639
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,718
and we called all
the nicest animals

640
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,753
from all over the world.

641
00:33:01,755 --> 00:33:05,790
From the London Zoo,
Charles the Cheetah.

642
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,294
No one should be ignored
on their birthday.

643
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:12,530
MR. JAY: From the
Tallowmere Captain MaCaw.

644
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:16,801
From the Amazon,
Tallullah, the crocogator,

645
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:21,373
and from the continent
of Africa, Honey.

646
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,340
Honey?

647
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:23,708
Yes, that's his name.

648
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,977
Honey, the honey badger.

649
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:27,779
I thought I would come
and visit you

650
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:28,780
on your birthday.

651
00:33:28,782 --> 00:33:30,548
I hope it's okay?

652
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,816
Oh, sure it is.

653
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:33,885
We'll all play some games
we will.

654
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,988
Do you have a birthday crisis
or emergency?

655
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,724
Call IBN.

656
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,328
We are a major
charitable organization

657
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:48,800
and we will create a unique
and exciting birthday party

658
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:50,502
for you.

659
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:52,003
For absolutely free.

660
00:33:52,005 --> 00:33:53,538
On us!

661
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,841
Everyone, let's do
the birthday poem.

662
00:33:56,843 --> 00:34:00,945
It's your birthday,
our favorite day,

663
00:34:00,947 --> 00:34:04,316
we bet you know
what we will say.

664
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:06,985
Happy Birthday!

665
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:08,586
Oh!

666
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,922
I haven't had
a piece of cake yet.

667
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,059
Oh, Tallullah, there's yours.

668
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:16,061
Honey, have a nice big slice.

669
00:34:16,063 --> 00:34:18,430
There you go, Charles.

670
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:21,533
Captain, I haven't forgot you,
Loopy,

671
00:34:21,535 --> 00:34:23,902
and the birthday boy.

672
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:29,007
Well, this goes on
for several more hours.

673
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:30,775
But you get the gist, huh?

674
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,077
Isn't that fantastic?

675
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,345
Wonderful.

676
00:34:35,816 --> 00:34:38,383
Uh, and I'll tell you
the inspiration for it.

677
00:34:38,385 --> 00:34:40,452
The uh, origin story.

678
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:43,988
I am little Finn, the fox, yeah.

679
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,623
When I was a little shaver,

680
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,926
I got the royal chef
two years in a row.

681
00:34:47,928 --> 00:34:50,528
My birthday came,
I got all excited.

682
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,464
I was waiting, you know,
for my party,

683
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,965
for clowns and ponies.

684
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,467
You know what I got?

685
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,901
Nothing.

686
00:34:56,903 --> 00:34:58,403
Heartache.

687
00:34:58,405 --> 00:35:02,540
Now, not one friend
came to wish me.

688
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:06,411
Well, on my day of days,
the candles were reflected

689
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:10,115
in my fat, salty tears,
running down my chubby face.

690
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,487
And that is when I decided
that no other little kid

691
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:19,124
would ever have to be sad
and lonely,

692
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:23,895
depressed and rejected,
on his, you know, special day.

693
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:26,131
We only get one, Barry.

694
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:31,002
One a year to celebrate
and be celebrated.

695
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,670
That is why I invented

696
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,874
the International
Birthday Network and that is why

697
00:35:35,876 --> 00:35:39,477
I want you to take my spot.

698
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:42,480
Wait, wait, wait.

699
00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:44,682
You want me to take your spot?

700
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:48,520
(Sighs)

701
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:53,792
You know what, Barry,
I'll tell you something.

702
00:35:53,794 --> 00:35:57,495
I'm not as young as I once was.

703
00:35:57,497 --> 00:35:58,863
(Laughs)

704
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,633
I can't load the wagon
like I used to.

705
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:04,502
And let me tell you something,
the truth is those stairs.

706
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:07,872
Those relentless,
punishing stairs.

707
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,180
Uh, so it seems like
a really unique and you know,

708
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:16,981
wonderful opportunity.

709
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:18,683
I mean, I... I really love
to help kids and all of that,

710
00:36:18,685 --> 00:36:21,653
but the problem is
is that I work too much.

711
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:24,055
You know, whenever I'm off,
I have to be with Emily.

712
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:27,525
Well, take her with you,
they're birthday parties.

713
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:28,593
They're better with kids.

714
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,899
Okay, so, um...

715
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,201
- Hypothetically...
- MR. JAY: Yeah.

716
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:38,636
What does something
like this pay?

717
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:42,674
Well, it's what I do
and I do okay.

718
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:43,908
Yes, you do.

719
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,177
I think you need a change.

720
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:49,180
So you keep your day job
for a while.

721
00:36:49,182 --> 00:36:52,083
Simultaneously,
apprentice for me

722
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,919
and if everything goes well,
we'll talk numbers.

723
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,087
Huh?

724
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,589
What do you say?

725
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:09,901
BARRY:
You know what?

726
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:11,503
I'm in.

727
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:13,972
(Laughing)

728
00:37:13,974 --> 00:37:15,773
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, shoot.

729
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,941
What's with...
what's with the gloves?

730
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,711
- Oh, hot glue gun.
- Oh.

731
00:37:19,713 --> 00:37:22,747
Yeah, heat blisters
from making puppets.

732
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:25,783
Don't wanna, you know,
gross out the kiddies.

733
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,985
(Laughing)

734
00:37:28,922 --> 00:37:30,622
Excellent.

735
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:31,856
Nice job.

736
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,826
So you're like a event planner?

737
00:37:34,828 --> 00:37:35,827
No.

738
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:37,762
Well, yeah, I guess.

739
00:37:37,764 --> 00:37:39,197
No, not really.

740
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,767
Look, you remember that wish
that you made?

741
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:44,636
I think it came true.

742
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,004
Really?

743
00:37:46,006 --> 00:37:48,806
Yeah, things are about to change
and...

744
00:37:50,577 --> 00:37:51,843
...we're about to bring
a lot of cheer

745
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:54,145
to a lot
of lonely birthday kids.

746
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,581
We? What's this we stuff?

747
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,016
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
you're coming with me.

748
00:37:58,018 --> 00:37:59,317
I am?

749
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,785
BARRY:
Yeah, the more the merrier,

750
00:38:00,787 --> 00:38:01,986
it's company policy
apparently.

751
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,924
Okay.

752
00:38:05,926 --> 00:38:08,693
That will be a good
father-daughter bonding thing

753
00:38:08,695 --> 00:38:10,328
and we get to give back.

754
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,697
I think it's a really,
really nice thing to do.

755
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:14,732
Oh, then it's official.

756
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,768
We're in the birthday business,
kid.

757
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,036
(Making noises)

758
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:19,871
Let me see those power chords.

759
00:38:19,873 --> 00:38:21,105
Ready? Go.

760
00:38:24,578 --> 00:38:26,244
Nice.

761
00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:30,048
Barry, Emily, I want you
to meet our team.

762
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:33,151
This is my dear friend,
Michelle.

763
00:38:33,153 --> 00:38:36,020
She was the assistant
superintendent

764
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:40,024
of public schools around here
for years and years.

765
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:44,195
And she has contacts
with every social worker

766
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,264
and school psychiatrist.

767
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:50,802
She's overqualified to throw
a perfect birthday party.

768
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:54,606
That is Rita, my high school
drama best friend.

769
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:57,375
She was something
in Much Ado About Nothing.

770
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:01,846
She's our office manager
and she keeps things going

771
00:39:01,848 --> 00:39:03,748
like clockwork around here.

772
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:06,718
Ooh.

773
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,655
Ink jam, happens all the time.

774
00:39:10,657 --> 00:39:14,892
And of course, this is Hank,

775
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:19,364
my sister's oldest
and is true with most things.

776
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:22,767
The less said the better.

777
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:26,170
I wish I could help you,

778
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:29,273
but I'm not
a very mechanical guy.

779
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:30,842
If you wanted
a defense attorney,

780
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:33,244
then I can give you
a couple of hands.

781
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,812
You know, I think I'm good,

782
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:36,814
but I will definitely
think about it.

783
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:38,216
No biggie.

784
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:39,350
I was on my way back
from the gym,

785
00:39:39,352 --> 00:39:42,186
thought I stop by and say hi.

786
00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:44,689
Right on.
Way to get that workout in.

787
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:46,424
No biggie, it's a lifestyle.

788
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,793
You know, I do tris, bis

789
00:39:48,795 --> 00:39:51,663
on Mondays and Wednesdays
and legs and chest

790
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:53,831
on Thursdays and Saturdays.

791
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,433
(Grunts)

792
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:58,870
- Nice glutes there, Bell, yeah.
- Thanks, pal.

793
00:39:58,872 --> 00:40:00,672
Hey, Barry.

794
00:40:00,674 --> 00:40:02,340
Hi, we... we got a little
heater problem going on here?

795
00:40:02,342 --> 00:40:03,675
Uh, yeah.

796
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:05,276
I think it's the battery

797
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,744
and if I don't fix it
before the inspector comes,

798
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:08,413
Bianca is going to flip.

799
00:40:08,415 --> 00:40:10,448
Uh, you know what, I think
I had the exact same thing

800
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,083
happen to me
a couple of months ago.

801
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:13,818
I think I know exactly
what to do, alright?

802
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:20,124
(Indiscernible speech)

803
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,159
JESS:
You fixed it.

804
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:22,827
That was magical.

805
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:25,229
Well, I'm gonna take
a little cool down jog.

806
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:30,702
See if I can beat
this lactic acid build-up.

807
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:32,470
You fight that acid, pal.

808
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:34,972
Hey, you hungry?

809
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,107
Huh?

810
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:37,475
Do you wanna go get some pizza?

811
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,711
I punch out at 5:00
and I am starving.

812
00:40:39,713 --> 00:40:41,312
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

813
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:42,980
Hold on here a sec.

814
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,982
Who told you that pizza
is my weakness?

815
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:47,719
(Chuckles)

816
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:49,787
Oh, yeah, let's go.

817
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:51,289
Alright, thank you.

818
00:40:53,293 --> 00:40:54,358
Ready.

819
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,861
- Oh, what a gent.
- Yes.

820
00:40:56,863 --> 00:41:00,765
(♪♪♪♪♪)

821
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:06,804
(♪♪♪♪♪)

822
00:41:06,806 --> 00:41:08,506
JESS: Yeah,
but it's not about the money.

823
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,876
I think
it's a really good cause.

824
00:41:11,878 --> 00:41:13,111
I could not agree
with you more.

825
00:41:13,113 --> 00:41:14,178
I mean, I'm serious.

826
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,880
Like, that's amazing.

827
00:41:15,882 --> 00:41:17,482
That's what's so cool about you.

828
00:41:17,484 --> 00:41:20,384
I mean, everybody else is
so hung up on themselves and...

829
00:41:20,386 --> 00:41:21,786
you really care about people.

830
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,489
BARRY:
I try.

831
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:25,990
(Chuckles)

832
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,227
What?

833
00:41:29,229 --> 00:41:30,795
What, um... that's funny?

834
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:32,196
No, no, I'm sorry, no, um...

835
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,464
Oh.

836
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:34,799
You had a little something.

837
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:35,767
Yeah, I had a little something.

838
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:37,201
(Laughing)

839
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,503
BARRY:
Oh, man.

840
00:41:45,078 --> 00:41:48,246
These two are getting
awfully close, for now.

841
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:52,784
(Indistinct chatter)

842
00:42:02,962 --> 00:42:05,797
Alright, class, next week
is going to be

843
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:09,000
our school-wide spelling bee
and the winners of that

844
00:42:09,002 --> 00:42:10,401
will advance to the finals.

845
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:18,943
And then the champions win
a trip to go to Disney World.

846
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:21,045
(Cheering)

847
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:23,581
I know, yeah, yeah, I thought
that would get your attention.

848
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,550
I love spelling bees.

849
00:42:25,552 --> 00:42:28,186
So last year,
Tristen was our big winner.

850
00:42:28,188 --> 00:42:31,255
(Applause)

851
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:35,126
But this year's competition
is very stiff.

852
00:42:35,128 --> 00:42:38,462
Emily at her last school,
she was the champion.

853
00:42:38,464 --> 00:42:42,300
And then she placed
top 10 in the state finals.

854
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:45,369
(Applause)

855
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:48,606
Wow, Emily, you were at an event
people actually showed up to.

856
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,274
What was that, Tristen?

857
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,976
Nothing, Mr. Alpert.

858
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,879
Okay.

859
00:42:54,881 --> 00:42:57,248
You know what,
it's time for some real fun.

860
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,616
Break out your math books.

861
00:42:58,618 --> 00:42:59,517
STUDENTS:
Oh.

862
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,385
Oh.

863
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,095
How was school?

864
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:12,363
Okay.

865
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:14,198
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

866
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,166
You sure?

867
00:43:15,168 --> 00:43:16,534
Yep.

868
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:25,376
If, uh, cookies, and sprinkles,
and frosting, uh,

869
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:27,211
don't put a smile on your face,
something's wrong.

870
00:43:27,213 --> 00:43:29,313
What's going on?

871
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,149
It's just Tristen's been
bugging me lately.

872
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,986
Like any chance she gets.

873
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,587
And then her friends
just really need to chime in

874
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:39,123
just so they can feel cool.

875
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:42,159
Yeah, you know what,
that's what bullies do.

876
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,128
They recruit the weak minds
around them.

877
00:43:45,598 --> 00:43:49,133
But I need you to prove
that you're above that.

878
00:43:49,135 --> 00:43:50,268
I know.

879
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,169
I just...

880
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,973
I didn't react how you said
and I waited till I got home

881
00:43:55,975 --> 00:43:57,174
to start crying.

882
00:43:58,378 --> 00:43:59,510
Well...

883
00:44:01,114 --> 00:44:03,147
I'm proud of you
for not letting them

884
00:44:03,149 --> 00:44:04,415
get a rise out of you.

885
00:44:05,952 --> 00:44:08,953
But I'll say this I don't like
people making you cry.

886
00:44:08,955 --> 00:44:10,221
So what I'm gonna do is
is I'm gonna go down

887
00:44:10,223 --> 00:44:11,622
and talk to that principal
of yours.

888
00:44:11,624 --> 00:44:13,624
No, don't.

889
00:44:13,626 --> 00:44:15,092
That will just make
things worse.

890
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:20,298
I just...
I miss my old school.

891
00:44:23,403 --> 00:44:26,337
And I miss mom, and...

892
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:29,674
I just want my life back.

893
00:44:32,178 --> 00:44:33,978
I know you do.

894
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:38,182
But I need you to understand
that I need your help.

895
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,054
There are little kids out there
that need your help, too.

896
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:44,722
You're so much like your mom.

897
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:47,158
You know how much she liked
to help people.

898
00:44:50,697 --> 00:44:52,163
So, what do you say?

899
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:57,001
Wanna get with your old dad
and get ready for the most epic

900
00:44:57,003 --> 00:45:00,104
father-daughter mission
in the galaxy?

901
00:45:00,106 --> 00:45:02,039
(Growls)

902
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:08,512
(♪♪♪♪♪)

903
00:45:31,004 --> 00:45:32,570
Alright, team, what do we got?

904
00:45:32,572 --> 00:45:34,739
Kid's name is Chase.

905
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:37,508
We just received a call
from his mother, Stacy.

906
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:42,013
And let me tell you,
she's a wreck.

907
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,316
Chase has asthma and can't play
sports like the other kids,

908
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:47,685
so they make fun of him
in gym class.

909
00:45:47,687 --> 00:45:50,755
He gets terrific grades,
does really well

910
00:45:50,757 --> 00:45:56,460
in science class,
and absolutely loves dinosaurs.

911
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:01,332
Mum invited Chase's entire class
and not one kid showed.

912
00:46:01,334 --> 00:46:03,234
Well, that means
that we're going to have

913
00:46:03,236 --> 00:46:05,636
to make an extra special
birthday for him.

914
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:11,208
Alright, people, let's gear up
and make a birthday!

915
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,610
- Hank.
- Yeah?

916
00:46:12,612 --> 00:46:14,712
We talked about this,
that's my line.

917
00:46:14,714 --> 00:46:17,181
Right, sorry.

918
00:46:17,183 --> 00:46:20,484
Alright, people, let's gear up
and make a birthday!

919
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,657
Woah!

920
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:31,529
(♪♪♪♪♪)

921
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,210
Barry, my boy.

922
00:46:46,212 --> 00:46:50,081
I present to you
your new wheels.

923
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:54,752
Feast your eyes
on the birthday mobile.

924
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:57,488
Try to keep it under a 100,
will you?

925
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:00,758
Woah, I've never seen anything
like this before.

926
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:07,765
Who needs a Peloton
when you can ride in style

927
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:10,234
and get a workout.

928
00:47:11,104 --> 00:47:12,803
The kids love it.

929
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:15,573
But wh...
why not just take a car?

930
00:47:15,575 --> 00:47:17,441
Tradition, Barry.

931
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:19,710
Tradition, like the hat.

932
00:47:22,615 --> 00:47:24,815
Well, is this thing even legal
to drive on the road?

933
00:47:24,817 --> 00:47:27,718
We use the back roads, Barry,
the back roads.

934
00:47:30,156 --> 00:47:31,455
(Laughs)

935
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:39,864
(♪♪♪♪♪)

936
00:47:46,706 --> 00:47:49,440
BARRY:
Roar!

937
00:47:49,442 --> 00:47:51,509
Are you Chase?

938
00:47:51,511 --> 00:47:54,211
Oh well, I am T-Rex

939
00:47:54,213 --> 00:47:57,515
and this is my trusted
side kick, Emsaurus.

940
00:47:57,517 --> 00:47:59,917
Hello, wish you
a happy birthday!

941
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,653
BARRY:
Happy Birthday, rarr.

942
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:05,556
Happy Birthday, roar!

943
00:48:05,558 --> 00:48:10,895
(♪♪♪♪♪)

944
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:23,541
Look how cool that looks!

945
00:48:23,543 --> 00:48:26,577
Oh, bravo, my friend,
so well done.

946
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,479
Exquisite.

947
00:48:30,383 --> 00:48:33,584
That was wonderful.

948
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:36,654
And Chase's mom
has already contacted us

949
00:48:36,656 --> 00:48:40,591
singing your praises.

950
00:48:40,593 --> 00:48:41,959
The kid had a blast.

951
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:45,296
He said it was
his best birthday ever!

952
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:46,830
Ooh, man.

953
00:48:46,832 --> 00:48:48,399
This uh, birthday business
is really exhausting.

954
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:50,801
Well, you already worked a job,
today.

955
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,437
You're an animal, Barry.

956
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:55,206
Oh, your indefatigable.

957
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:56,473
Huh?

958
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,242
It means
you don't tuck around easy.

959
00:48:58,244 --> 00:48:59,643
It's a good thing.

960
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,513
Go home and get some rest,
both of you.

961
00:49:02,515 --> 00:49:04,248
And come back tomorrow.

962
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,283
(Laughs)

963
00:49:06,285 --> 00:49:07,518
Alright.

964
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,986
Good night, everybody.

965
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,288
Let's go, kid.

966
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,624
Boys, what do you think?

967
00:49:13,626 --> 00:49:15,459
Don't you think
Barry's something?

968
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:17,561
Oh, yeah, he's a howl.

969
00:49:17,563 --> 00:49:20,831
(Laughing)

970
00:49:23,236 --> 00:49:26,003
Oh, very good.

971
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,472
A good day, eh?

972
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:33,844
I'm very happy.

973
00:49:37,316 --> 00:49:39,016
(Indiscernible speech)

974
00:49:56,435 --> 00:49:57,534
(Snores)

975
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,805
Wake up, it's almost time to go.

976
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:05,776
Five more minutes.

977
00:50:05,778 --> 00:50:08,712
You better get up
or you're gonna be late.

978
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,314
Role reversal?

979
00:50:10,316 --> 00:50:11,782
Weird.

980
00:50:11,784 --> 00:50:14,485
I got a bus to catch!

981
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:15,786
Okay, honey, have a good day.

982
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:18,856
I love you.

983
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:41,345
BIANCA:
Barry.

984
00:50:44,684 --> 00:50:46,517
Barry, open up.

985
00:50:52,558 --> 00:50:55,893
Barry, open up, you're late!

986
00:50:55,895 --> 00:50:58,062
BIANCA: Barry, I can hear you.
Barry!

987
00:51:00,066 --> 00:51:01,098
Bianca.

988
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,434
Barry, I can hear you.

989
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,639
Oh, oh wow, it's really late.

990
00:51:08,641 --> 00:51:09,606
Oh.

991
00:51:11,677 --> 00:51:13,010
BIANCA:
Barry!

992
00:51:13,012 --> 00:51:15,979
Barry! Barry!

993
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:19,483
Barry, open this door!

994
00:51:19,485 --> 00:51:21,118
Barry, get out here.

995
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,820
If you're not out here
in three seconds, you're fired!

996
00:51:25,558 --> 00:51:26,990
Barry!

997
00:51:28,728 --> 00:51:29,960
Oh, hi, Bianca.

998
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,795
Oh, jeez,
you don't look so good.

999
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,065
Yeah, I don't know
what happened.

1000
00:51:35,067 --> 00:51:36,967
But you know, whatever got
into me, something did

1001
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:40,904
but it's like at 3:00 a.m.
last night, it's a headache,

1002
00:51:40,906 --> 00:51:44,007
- fever, explosive diarrhea.
- BIANCA: Oh.

1003
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:45,642
- Massive amounts.
- BIANCA: Oh, my.

1004
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,645
You don't even want to know
the details.

1005
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,414
It could be catchy.

1006
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:52,783
You might wanna keep
your distance, save yourself.

1007
00:51:52,785 --> 00:51:55,886
Oh, you know what, Barry,
that's a tough break.

1008
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:57,721
But you could have called
the office,

1009
00:51:57,723 --> 00:52:02,126
because what if today
was the corporate inspection

1010
00:52:02,128 --> 00:52:04,128
and you weren't there
to greet them, Barry?

1011
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,863
That's my mess up.

1012
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:07,831
Yeah, see, you're fresh
out of mess-ups, Barry,

1013
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,833
and as a matter of fact,
you're out of sick days, too.

1014
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,136
So if this happens again,
you're gonna be looking

1015
00:52:12,138 --> 00:52:15,739
for a new job and I'd imagine
a new place to live,

1016
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:17,574
so are we clear here?

1017
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:18,876
Crystal.

1018
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:19,977
BIANCA:
Okay.

1019
00:52:19,979 --> 00:52:21,845
Get well...

1020
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,780
soon.

1021
00:52:22,782 --> 00:52:23,781
Okay?

1022
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,152
God... God bless you,
you're an angel.

1023
00:52:38,464 --> 00:52:39,897
Sounds really cool.

1024
00:52:39,899 --> 00:52:41,665
You should have seen
the dinosaur costume.

1025
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:43,500
(Laughs)

1026
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:47,104
Wait, so you're like
a camp counselor for lame kids?

1027
00:52:47,106 --> 00:52:49,072
They're not lame,
a lot of them are just shy

1028
00:52:49,074 --> 00:52:51,608
and have a hard time
making friends.

1029
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,544
I mean, it makes sense.

1030
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,479
You would know how that feels.

1031
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:56,447
Okay, class.

1032
00:52:56,449 --> 00:52:57,214
Got me there.

1033
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,849
Take out your notebooks.

1034
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:02,886
We are going to prep
for the spelling bee.

1035
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,722
Better pay attention,
I'm coming for you.

1036
00:53:08,661 --> 00:53:13,730
We have a little girl named Anne
and she loves to play music.

1037
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,099
She just learned how to play
the piano.

1038
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:17,601
But she doesn't know
any other kids

1039
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:19,536
that she can play music with.

1040
00:53:19,538 --> 00:53:22,105
Wait, what.

1041
00:53:22,107 --> 00:53:24,208
A rock and roll party?

1042
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:28,178
Oh, I think we got this.

1043
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,580
Let's go.

1044
00:53:32,952 --> 00:53:36,620
Yeah!

1045
00:53:36,622 --> 00:53:40,524
It's a Birthday Palooza.

1046
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:46,196
Let's gear up
and make a birthday!

1047
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:48,966
(Laughing)

1048
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,221
- You ready to rock?
- Yeah.

1049
00:54:11,223 --> 00:54:12,789
Yeah!

1050
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,904
Well, hello there,
you must be Anne.

1051
00:54:29,742 --> 00:54:32,276
A little birdie
told us a secret.

1052
00:54:32,278 --> 00:54:33,844
Said you like to play music.

1053
00:54:33,846 --> 00:54:35,012
EMILY:
I play guitar.

1054
00:54:35,014 --> 00:54:36,013
- How about you?
- Piano.

1055
00:54:36,015 --> 00:54:37,581
EMILY:
Cool.

1056
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:39,082
ANNE:
But I really want a keyboard.

1057
00:54:39,084 --> 00:54:40,617
Oh, gosh, I don't know
what to do about that.

1058
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:41,718
What?

1059
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:45,322
I think your mom
got you something.

1060
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,292
You might wanna open that.

1061
00:54:48,294 --> 00:54:51,628
Dig in, come on, yeah!

1062
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,031
- What!
- This is awesome!

1063
00:54:55,267 --> 00:54:56,867
Hey, you know,
we should test it out.

1064
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,602
I just so happen to have
my guitar.

1065
00:54:58,604 --> 00:55:01,805
And I brought my drum kit
and if it's okay with mom,

1066
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:03,073
we do a little jam session.

1067
00:55:03,075 --> 00:55:04,975
Can we, mom?

1068
00:55:04,977 --> 00:55:06,777
Of course you can, honey.

1069
00:55:06,779 --> 00:55:09,012
Rock and roll, yeah!

1070
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:15,719
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1071
00:55:24,296 --> 00:55:25,963
Yeah!

1072
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:27,598
Happy Birthday, Anne!

1073
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,932
EMILY:
Happy Birthday!

1074
00:55:30,336 --> 00:55:31,802
Oh no, thank you.

1075
00:55:31,804 --> 00:55:35,372
Thank you very, very much.

1076
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:36,907
Alright, goodbye.

1077
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:37,975
Bravo!

1078
00:55:37,977 --> 00:55:40,243
Bravo, you two!

1079
00:55:40,245 --> 00:55:44,815
Anne's mother just called,
another an five-star review.

1080
00:55:44,817 --> 00:55:48,752
And most importantly,
the kid had a blast.

1081
00:55:48,754 --> 00:55:50,387
(Cheering)

1082
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:53,290
Oh, the requests,
they're pouring in.

1083
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:55,726
So, go home, get a little rest,

1084
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:58,962
and then tomorrow
we do it all again!

1085
00:55:58,964 --> 00:56:01,832
(Cheering)

1086
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,836
Ow!

1087
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,376
(Alarms buzzing)

1088
00:56:12,378 --> 00:56:13,977
(Grunts)

1089
00:56:16,115 --> 00:56:18,682
Feeling better, Barry?

1090
00:56:18,684 --> 00:56:20,651
Well, I have this corn
on my foot.

1091
00:56:20,653 --> 00:56:22,352
- Terrific.
- Listen, my toes are hurting...

1092
00:56:22,354 --> 00:56:26,723
So, if any of you have any work
that you can't get to,

1093
00:56:26,725 --> 00:56:29,059
feel free to dump it on Barry,
'cause I am certain

1094
00:56:29,061 --> 00:56:30,794
he is eager to make up
for lost time,

1095
00:56:30,796 --> 00:56:32,863
- isn't that right, Barry?
- Well then... absolutely.

1096
00:56:32,865 --> 00:56:34,231
Hey, you guys have anything,
give it to me.

1097
00:56:34,233 --> 00:56:35,365
I'm glad to do it.

1098
00:56:35,367 --> 00:56:36,233
That's the spirit.

1099
00:56:36,235 --> 00:56:37,768
It's my pleasure.

1100
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,870
Now we know corporate's coming
any day.

1101
00:56:39,872 --> 00:56:41,738
In fact,
it could be any minute.

1102
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,440
We just don't know

1103
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:48,311
which is why we must always
be prepared.

1104
00:56:50,249 --> 00:56:52,783
Yeah, go, get to work, go!

1105
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:57,020
Hey, Jess, hey Bar.

1106
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:59,423
Someone had a serious accident
combined with a really bad

1107
00:56:59,425 --> 00:57:01,958
aim issue over the men's room
by the gym.

1108
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,360
BARRY:
Oh, joy.

1109
00:57:03,362 --> 00:57:04,795
Yeah, it's a pretty ugly
over there,

1110
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:08,331
I'd to take a mop and a bucket.

1111
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,901
Yeah, oohwee, this guy,

1112
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:14,971
always going the extra mile
even if it means toilet duty.

1113
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:18,975
Ooh, I gotta go, got a big
malpractice case today.

1114
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:23,013
They are so boring
and so lucrative.

1115
00:57:23,015 --> 00:57:25,449
GG and TTYL.

1116
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:27,250
Too hip, gotta go!

1117
00:57:27,252 --> 00:57:29,186
(Humming)

1118
00:57:32,858 --> 00:57:35,425
Oh.

1119
00:57:35,427 --> 00:57:37,327
Oh no, oh.

1120
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:42,933
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1121
00:57:42,935 --> 00:57:45,969
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1122
00:57:45,971 --> 00:57:46,970
No.

1123
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,387
Hey, Barry, Ms. Ashcroft's dog
got out again.

1124
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:06,890
There's a river of pee
in the lobby.

1125
00:58:06,892 --> 00:58:08,091
You gotta get down here fast.

1126
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:20,337
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1127
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:29,546
Barry, I could use your help
in here.

1128
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,149
I'm in a real crunch.

1129
00:58:32,151 --> 00:58:38,421
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1130
00:58:47,132 --> 00:58:49,866
Barry, meet me at electrical.

1131
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:52,169
We need to change
the light bulbs, stat.

1132
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:56,439
Copy, I'll be right there.

1133
00:58:56,441 --> 00:59:02,512
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1134
00:59:16,295 --> 00:59:18,395
(Vocalizing)

1135
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:21,164
Hey, Barry.
The restaurant across the street

1136
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:22,499
just filled up our dumpster.

1137
00:59:22,501 --> 00:59:24,134
You might wanna work it out.

1138
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:32,442
HOTEL WORKER 4:
Barry.

1139
00:59:35,214 --> 00:59:36,580
Yeah, I'll be there in a jif.

1140
00:59:40,018 --> 00:59:41,117
Oh!

1141
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:05,442
Well, Bartholomew, my boy,
aww.

1142
01:00:05,444 --> 01:00:08,411
You don't have your usual
characteristic spark.

1143
01:00:08,413 --> 01:00:10,313
Long day?

1144
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,581
Oh, Mr. Jay,
I'm so glad it's you.

1145
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:13,083
I thought it was Bianca.

1146
01:00:13,085 --> 01:00:15,018
She's been on me extra hard
today.

1147
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,354
Oh, don't let Bianca
get to you.

1148
01:00:17,356 --> 01:00:20,223
You should have empathy
for the poor, sad, tragic,

1149
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:21,958
wretched thing.

1150
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,029
She takes herself and her job
far too seriously.

1151
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:27,497
Yeah, well, we have this
inspection thing happening

1152
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,366
and apparently,

1153
01:00:29,368 --> 01:00:31,935
if we don't score high,
it's all on her, so she's been,

1154
01:00:31,937 --> 01:00:32,669
you know...

1155
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:33,970
Well, that's what it is.

1156
01:00:33,972 --> 01:00:35,505
She's under stress.

1157
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:38,008
Wonder when her birthday is.

1158
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:40,477
If anyone needs some cake
and puppets, it's her.

1159
01:00:42,948 --> 01:00:48,518
Yeah, well, I punch out
in 15 minutes, so uh...

1160
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,354
We'll uh... we'll do
the birthday talk after that.

1161
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:55,025
Oh, Barry, Barry,
I know you're tired.

1162
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:56,426
I get it.

1163
01:00:56,428 --> 01:01:00,196
But as I always say,
birthdays come,

1164
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,299
whether we're ready for them
or not.

1165
01:01:02,301 --> 01:01:04,000
You're making magic,

1166
01:01:04,002 --> 01:01:07,003
you're changing lives,
the children are happy.

1167
01:01:07,005 --> 01:01:09,339
We're booked
for the next two weeks.

1168
01:01:09,341 --> 01:01:12,242
Success is a result
of a daily commitment

1169
01:01:12,244 --> 01:01:13,710
to excellence.

1170
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:17,514
And daily means today.

1171
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:23,987
Daily commitment.

1172
01:01:28,527 --> 01:01:32,295
People, this is very serious.

1173
01:01:32,297 --> 01:01:34,531
We are booked solid.

1174
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:36,666
I'm overjoyed.

1175
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:40,337
And we have
to use every trick we know

1176
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:43,740
to give these kids
the best day of their lives.

1177
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:47,711
Barry, Emily, team,
in this neighborhood alone,

1178
01:01:47,713 --> 01:01:53,550
we have had six requests
for Mr. Jay's big time puppets.

1179
01:01:56,688 --> 01:01:59,055
Hank.

1180
01:01:59,057 --> 01:02:02,759
No, Magic Marker.

1181
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:05,996
We're starting right here.

1182
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,568
Alright?

1183
01:02:30,756 --> 01:02:32,756
Ah, that's how you make
the pizza, huh?

1184
01:02:32,758 --> 01:02:34,290
That's how you make the pizza,

1185
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,259
you make the pizza like this.
Okay?

1186
01:02:36,261 --> 01:02:37,727
When you make the pizza,
you gotta go big with the pizza,

1187
01:02:37,729 --> 01:02:39,696
huh?

1188
01:02:39,698 --> 01:02:41,731
Nobody eats a little pizza,
you gotta make a big pizza.

1189
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:54,544
Happy birthday to you!

1190
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,215
Hey, bravissimo, bravissimo!

1191
01:02:59,217 --> 01:03:02,419
Fettucine, spaghetti, lasagna.

1192
01:03:02,421 --> 01:03:04,287
Ah, that is the only Italian
I know.

1193
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:08,825
(Alarms buzzing)

1194
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,828
(Chuckles)

1195
01:03:14,766 --> 01:03:16,766
(Grunts)

1196
01:03:22,574 --> 01:03:25,175
(Chuckles)

1197
01:03:35,654 --> 01:03:36,820
(Cheering)

1198
01:03:36,822 --> 01:03:38,421
(Laughs)

1199
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:44,394
Go, ah, go.

1200
01:03:44,396 --> 01:03:46,396
(Grunting)

1201
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:54,771
(Overlapping speech)

1202
01:03:57,709 --> 01:04:00,677
(Grunting)

1203
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:02,278
Help, help.

1204
01:04:04,282 --> 01:04:06,282
(Cheering)

1205
01:04:06,284 --> 01:04:09,152
Happy Birthday...

1206
01:04:09,154 --> 01:04:11,454
...to you.

1207
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:23,466
Three birthday parties
in one day.

1208
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:26,503
That's the happy birthday
hat-trick.

1209
01:04:33,512 --> 01:04:35,578
So my air conditioner,
it's acting up.

1210
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,481
I think it's defective
or cursed.

1211
01:04:39,384 --> 01:04:41,451
No, it's just you need
to turn it on

1212
01:04:41,453 --> 01:04:44,287
when you want it cold
and off when you want it off.

1213
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,624
So, on means cool?

1214
01:04:48,527 --> 01:04:49,592
I see.

1215
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,427
Huh, I didn't get that.

1216
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,599
Alright, well, good night.

1217
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,434
Hey, Jess,
how about you and I...

1218
01:04:59,704 --> 01:05:02,605
How about I order some food
and you and I catch a movie?

1219
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:06,209
I don't think so, Rick.

1220
01:05:07,712 --> 01:05:09,345
You'd rather go out,
'cause you've been

1221
01:05:09,347 --> 01:05:10,346
so cooped up, right?

1222
01:05:10,348 --> 01:05:12,282
Well, how about this,

1223
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:14,217
I can get reservations
in your own town,

1224
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:15,685
'cause I got conexiَns.

1225
01:05:15,687 --> 01:05:17,820
I'm just tired.

1226
01:05:17,822 --> 01:05:20,623
You weren't too tired
to have pizza with Barry

1227
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,292
the other night.

1228
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:23,960
What?

1229
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:26,296
Barry, the stuff he said
about you.

1230
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:27,797
He thinks you're great.

1231
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,966
He's right, good night.

1232
01:05:41,446 --> 01:05:42,679
Think you can handle
the birthday missions

1233
01:05:42,681 --> 01:05:43,947
without me this weekend?

1234
01:05:43,949 --> 01:05:45,748
Well, you know,
it won't be easy,

1235
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,584
but I'm sure you'll have
a really great time

1236
01:05:47,586 --> 01:05:50,653
at Alex's sleepover,
so that makes me happy.

1237
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,323
I can't wait, I'm gonna show
him some stuff on the guitar

1238
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:55,391
and he's gonna teach me
some piano.

1239
01:05:55,393 --> 01:05:57,260
Yeah, well, rock and roll.

1240
01:05:57,262 --> 01:05:58,928
And we're gonna practice
for the spelling bee,

1241
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,731
because I have to demolish
Tristen.

1242
01:06:03,235 --> 01:06:04,834
You know what,
I'm so proud of you,

1243
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:07,704
putting all that work in,
it's gonna pay off big time,

1244
01:06:07,706 --> 01:06:09,372
I'm telling you.

1245
01:06:09,374 --> 01:06:10,740
Thanks, dad.

1246
01:06:13,245 --> 01:06:14,877
Hey, Alex's mom's outside.

1247
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:20,883
EMILY:
Okay, bye.

1248
01:06:27,726 --> 01:06:29,626
Hey, dad.

1249
01:06:29,628 --> 01:06:31,661
Yeah, did you forget something?

1250
01:06:31,663 --> 01:06:33,997
No, I just wanted to say
that it's been the best

1251
01:06:33,999 --> 01:06:35,898
birthday week in a long time.

1252
01:06:37,736 --> 01:06:40,503
Okay, bye!

1253
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:44,540
I'm not crying, you're crying.

1254
01:06:47,412 --> 01:06:50,446
Alright, people, let's blow out
some candles.

1255
01:06:50,448 --> 01:06:51,481
Yeah!

1256
01:06:51,483 --> 01:06:54,284
(Overlapping chatter)

1257
01:07:08,433 --> 01:07:13,603
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1258
01:07:19,978 --> 01:07:22,011
This is my destiny, not yours.

1259
01:07:22,013 --> 01:07:23,980
This is mine, I got it.

1260
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,083
(Grunting)

1261
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:29,352
I can't do it, go ahead.

1262
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,926
Escalibur!

1263
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:43,599
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1264
01:08:04,422 --> 01:08:06,956
RICK: "International
Birthday Network."

1265
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,791
Hmm.

1266
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:14,030
I wonder, if Bianca knows
you're playing party planner,

1267
01:08:14,032 --> 01:08:18,034
when you should be getting
ready for the big inspection.

1268
01:08:18,036 --> 01:08:20,103
Hmm.

1269
01:08:20,105 --> 01:08:23,373
Won't be able to afford
pizza dates now, will you,

1270
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:24,574
when you're out of your job?

1271
01:08:24,576 --> 01:08:25,975
(Laughs)

1272
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,810
No, you won't.

1273
01:08:36,788 --> 01:08:38,888
Aardvark.

1274
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:41,991
A-A-R-D-V-A-R-K.

1275
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,459
Aardvark.

1276
01:08:45,897 --> 01:08:49,632
How about...

1277
01:08:49,634 --> 01:08:51,534
...hippopotamus?

1278
01:08:51,536 --> 01:08:56,506
H-I-P-P-O-P-O-T-A-M-U-S.

1279
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:57,440
Hippopotamus.

1280
01:08:57,442 --> 01:08:58,808
It's excellent.

1281
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:00,476
You're right,
you're gonna crush this.

1282
01:09:00,478 --> 01:09:03,413
Now, eat protein.

1283
01:09:03,415 --> 01:09:04,180
Brain food.

1284
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,816
Brain food.

1285
01:09:06,818 --> 01:09:09,018
(Laughs)

1286
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,664
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1287
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:22,632
Code red, people.

1288
01:09:22,634 --> 01:09:23,800
We have a code red here.

1289
01:09:23,802 --> 01:09:25,635
Corporate inspection is today,

1290
01:09:25,637 --> 01:09:28,738
I need all units in the lobby
in five minutes.

1291
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:32,708
Repeat,
all units, lobby, five minutes.

1292
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:36,078
(Sighs)

1293
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:40,750
You've got this.

1294
01:09:42,187 --> 01:09:43,453
(Sighs)

1295
01:09:44,189 --> 01:09:46,889
This is what we dreamed for.

1296
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,491
Today is the day,

1297
01:09:48,493 --> 01:09:51,828
the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1298
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:56,766
At 1:00 p.m., those doors
will open and in will walk

1299
01:09:56,768 --> 01:09:59,735
the most influential people
from corporate,

1300
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:05,074
sent here to inspect
our every move.

1301
01:10:05,977 --> 01:10:08,177
Now I know this goes
without saying,

1302
01:10:08,179 --> 01:10:11,747
but any failure to complete
the given task today,

1303
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:15,218
will result
in immediate termination.

1304
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:19,021
I don't have time for it,
not today, remember.

1305
01:10:19,023 --> 01:10:22,124
'Cause today,
we prefer keeps.

1306
01:10:28,032 --> 01:10:30,066
Well, that's a pretty good
speech.

1307
01:10:30,068 --> 01:10:31,133
Mm.

1308
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:43,145
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1309
01:10:43,147 --> 01:10:44,580
MR. ALPERT:
Hello, everyone.

1310
01:10:44,582 --> 01:10:46,115
You know what time it is.

1311
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:48,651
It's time for those
marvelous minds to get together.

1312
01:10:48,653 --> 01:10:50,186
Oh, yeah.

1313
01:10:50,188 --> 01:10:51,921
It's spelling bee time!

1314
01:10:51,923 --> 01:10:55,024
(Cheering)

1315
01:10:57,762 --> 01:11:00,062
Hey, Emily, you're going down.

1316
01:11:00,064 --> 01:11:01,831
D-O-W-N.

1317
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:03,032
Down.

1318
01:11:04,035 --> 01:11:06,135
It's time to spell, kids.

1319
01:11:12,744 --> 01:11:17,313
Hank, this is our best birthday
month since 1993.

1320
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,581
(Chuckles)

1321
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:20,616
Barry sure takes the cake.

1322
01:11:20,618 --> 01:11:23,319
Puts candles on it, too.

1323
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:27,956
Birthday joke.

1324
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,624
Sorry to interrupt, boss,
but, well, we thought

1325
01:11:29,627 --> 01:11:31,928
you'd be best suited
to take this one.

1326
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:35,765
International Birthday Network,
Mr. Jay speaking,

1327
01:11:35,767 --> 01:11:39,302
president, CEO, founder,
and emperor of birthday land.

1328
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:41,003
Oh, thank goodness.

1329
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,238
Hi, yeah.

1330
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,106
It's my son, Jason.

1331
01:11:44,108 --> 01:11:46,008
You see today's his birthday
and his so-called friends,

1332
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,610
they said they'll throw him
a party

1333
01:11:47,612 --> 01:11:49,779
and they flat out left him
in the lurch.

1334
01:11:49,781 --> 01:11:51,981
Mhmm.

1335
01:11:51,983 --> 01:11:53,282
I'm sorry,
I'm talking too fast.

1336
01:11:53,284 --> 01:11:54,850
Then I'll get right to it.

1337
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,586
Jason's threatening to run away
from home

1338
01:11:56,588 --> 01:11:57,653
and I just don't know
what to do.

1339
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,089
That's terrible.

1340
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:01,991
It's terrible.

1341
01:12:01,993 --> 01:12:04,026
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that,
but you made the right call.

1342
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:07,263
We deal with this sort of thing
all the time.

1343
01:12:07,265 --> 01:12:12,168
We'll make sure that Jason
has an extra special birthday.

1344
01:12:13,304 --> 01:12:15,338
Well, isn't it my lucky day.

1345
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:16,973
Yes, of course.

1346
01:12:16,975 --> 01:12:20,376
My address is 849,
Juniper Street,

1347
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:23,112
City Laments, 10019.

1348
01:12:23,114 --> 01:12:25,348
Right, thank you.

1349
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,049
Alright, there we go.

1350
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,985
Hmm, not bad.

1351
01:12:34,659 --> 01:12:41,330
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1352
01:12:48,139 --> 01:12:49,205
MR. JAY:
Barry!

1353
01:12:49,207 --> 01:12:51,974
Barry, we have an emergency.

1354
01:12:51,976 --> 01:12:54,744
Code 47B.

1355
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:58,080
The kid's name is Jason,
he likes pirates.

1356
01:12:58,082 --> 01:12:59,915
Wh... what's a Code 47B?

1357
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,885
Code 47B, poh...
potential runaway.

1358
01:13:04,722 --> 01:13:06,188
Oh, well, that's bad.

1359
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,757
Yeah, very.

1360
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:10,393
Um, well, look,
we'll take care of it.

1361
01:13:10,395 --> 01:13:12,294
Um, I'll be ready to rock
as soon as I punch out, okay?

1362
01:13:12,296 --> 01:13:14,830
No, we can't wait that long.

1363
01:13:14,832 --> 01:13:15,898
What do you... what do you mean?

1364
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,767
Today's the inspection day.

1365
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:19,435
Corporate has their people
coming down here to greet us.

1366
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:21,070
Bianca will fire me on the spot.

1367
01:13:21,072 --> 01:13:23,806
So lobby duty takes precedent.

1368
01:13:23,808 --> 01:13:26,075
It's uh... it's nice
to finally know

1369
01:13:26,077 --> 01:13:28,844
your true priorities.

1370
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,181
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1371
01:13:32,183 --> 01:13:33,783
Come... come... come back.

1372
01:13:37,055 --> 01:13:38,688
Uh, um.

1373
01:13:48,866 --> 01:13:50,966
Uh, God, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

1374
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,201
I think I have an idea.

1375
01:13:57,075 --> 01:14:02,745
Truncate,
T-R-U-N-C-A-T-E.

1376
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:03,746
Truncate.

1377
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:06,282
That is correct.

1378
01:14:06,284 --> 01:14:08,150
Good job, Emily.

1379
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:10,219
MR. ALPERT: You move on to
the finals against Tristen.

1380
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:11,921
Well, isn't this exciting.

1381
01:14:11,923 --> 01:14:14,356
Two returning champions
going head-to-head

1382
01:14:14,358 --> 01:14:16,726
for the biggest spelling prize
in the school.

1383
01:14:41,219 --> 01:14:42,351
I might as well
update my resume,

1384
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:43,753
this is never gonna work.

1385
01:14:43,755 --> 01:14:46,756
Oh, no, it's perfect.

1386
01:14:46,758 --> 01:14:48,390
It will fool your own mother.

1387
01:14:48,392 --> 01:14:49,992
Here, put this on.

1388
01:14:49,994 --> 01:14:51,327
BARRY:
What is that?

1389
01:14:51,329 --> 01:14:55,364
It's for the kid's party,
he loves pirates.

1390
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,199
Wait, wait, wait,
here's the secret weapon.

1391
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:01,771
Look, I'm Captain Mickey MaCaw.

1392
01:15:01,773 --> 01:15:05,241
Who wants to bury some treasure?

1393
01:15:05,243 --> 01:15:06,408
Arr.

1394
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:08,043
That's a start.

1395
01:15:10,014 --> 01:15:15,785

1396
01:15:45,016 --> 01:15:47,049
Come on, come on.

(♪♪♪♪♪)

1398
01:16:29,327 --> 01:16:31,160
Hey, Mr. Jay, yeah, hi,
I got to the location

1399
01:16:31,162 --> 01:16:32,461
where the party's
supposed to be

1400
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:33,996
and it's nothing
but an empty field.

1401
01:16:33,998 --> 01:16:35,064
I mean, there's not even
a house here.

1402
01:16:35,066 --> 01:16:36,966
It's... there's nothing.

1403
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:39,635
It's uh... I... I think that
we've been birthday bamboozled.

1404
01:16:41,038 --> 01:16:42,571
Yeah, yeah.

1405
01:16:44,876 --> 01:16:46,609
Okay, alright,
I'm coming back to base.

1406
01:17:00,358 --> 01:17:01,490
Hey, Bianca.

1407
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:04,026
Rick here, uh unit 2A.

1408
01:17:04,028 --> 01:17:05,594
Yeah, listen.

1409
01:17:05,596 --> 01:17:08,097
That darn air conditioner,
it's acting up again.

1410
01:17:08,099 --> 01:17:11,300
Yeah, second time this week,
yeah.

1411
01:17:11,302 --> 01:17:13,669
Could you send Barry?

1412
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:17,106
Yeah, he's got a real knack
for fixing that thing.

1413
01:17:17,108 --> 01:17:18,107
Right.

1414
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:20,042
Oh, I love that guy.

1415
01:17:20,044 --> 01:17:22,511
Oh, he's terrific.

1416
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:23,579
Yeah.

1417
01:17:23,581 --> 01:17:25,114

1418
01:17:25,116 --> 01:17:26,315
Thank you.

1419
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,186
Yeah, I love that guy.

1420
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:34,423
Barry, this is Bianca, over.

1421
01:17:36,994 --> 01:17:40,362
Bianca for Barry, over.

1422
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:43,499
We have a malfunctioning AC
in unit 2A

1423
01:17:43,501 --> 01:17:47,069
and I need you up there fast,
quick, and in a hurry.

1424
01:17:47,071 --> 01:17:48,337
Where's this guy?

1425
01:17:49,573 --> 01:17:52,541
(Humming)

1426
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,209
Hey Barry, do you know
where I put my...

1427
01:18:04,689 --> 01:18:06,322
No.

1428
01:18:06,324 --> 01:18:07,589
No, no, no, no.

1429
01:18:07,591 --> 01:18:08,724
(Grunts)

1430
01:18:08,726 --> 01:18:14,964
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1431
01:18:39,023 --> 01:18:43,559
Hi, um, you guys
must be the inspectors.

1432
01:18:43,561 --> 01:18:47,997
Well, let me introduce you
to our manager, Bianca.

1433
01:18:47,999 --> 01:18:51,734
She's really excited
to meet you guys.

1434
01:18:54,038 --> 01:18:58,741
MR. ALPERT: Okay, Tristen,
please spell for us questionnaire.

1435
01:18:58,743 --> 01:19:00,275
Okay, that's easy.

1436
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,311
Uh, that's questionnaire.

1437
01:19:02,313 --> 01:19:08,684
Q-U-E-S-T-I-O-N-A-I-R-E
Questionnaire.

1438
01:19:11,255 --> 01:19:15,357
I'm sorry, that is incorrect.

1439
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:19,328
Emily, can you please correctly
spell questionnaire?

1440
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:21,797
And if you do,
you will be the new champion.

1441
01:19:27,171 --> 01:19:34,176
Q-U-E-S-T-I-O-N-N-A-I-R-E,

1442
01:19:34,178 --> 01:19:36,345
questionnaire.

1443
01:19:36,347 --> 01:19:39,481
Your winner
and new spelling bee champion,

1444
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:42,317
Emily Burtonday!

1445
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,285
I did it.

1446
01:19:45,222 --> 01:19:47,056
Mr. Alpert,
if it's alright with you,

1447
01:19:47,058 --> 01:19:50,259
I'd like to give the trophy
to Emily.

1448
01:19:50,261 --> 01:19:53,162
Well, that is the most honorable
demonstration of sportswomenship

1449
01:19:53,164 --> 01:19:55,130
I've ever seen, go ahead.

1450
01:19:55,132 --> 01:19:56,331
Thanks, Mr. Alpert.

1451
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:06,608
Here. You outspelled me
and you deserve it.

1452
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:07,843
And I'm sorry for the way
I treated you

1453
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,678
the last few weeks.

1454
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,181
I used to be the new kid
and I got picked on a lot, too.

1455
01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:13,782
I know exactly how it feels.

1456
01:20:13,784 --> 01:20:15,717
So it was really dumb of me
to do it to you.

1457
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:17,186
You were the toughest
competition I ever had,

1458
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:18,153
you know.

1459
01:20:18,155 --> 01:20:19,455
TRISTEN:
Really?

1460
01:20:19,457 --> 01:20:20,722
I bet we'd make
a pretty good pair

1461
01:20:20,724 --> 01:20:22,524
in the state-wide
team challenge.

1462
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,760
Yeah, I bet we would,
if you let me be a partner.

1463
01:20:24,762 --> 01:20:27,129
I'd like that, if you'd show up.

1464
01:20:27,131 --> 01:20:34,136
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1465
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:55,224
Come on. Come on.

1466
01:20:55,226 --> 01:21:01,563
(♪♪♪♪♪)

1467
01:21:26,357 --> 01:21:28,524
29-minute round trip,
not so bad.

1468
01:21:31,362 --> 01:21:32,794
Oh, here she is.

1469
01:21:32,796 --> 01:21:34,696
Here I am.

1470
01:21:34,698 --> 01:21:35,831
Where's Barry?

1471
01:21:36,834 --> 01:21:40,435
Uh, Barry...
Barry went to, uh, go...

1472
01:21:42,907 --> 01:21:44,873
Uh, he's right there.

1473
01:21:45,876 --> 01:21:46,775
Barry.

1474
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,577
Hi, Bianca.

1475
01:21:48,579 --> 01:21:50,212
Look, I'm sorry that I'm late,
it... it was an emergency.

1476
01:21:50,214 --> 01:21:52,848
I... I had something
I had to take care of.

1477
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:56,852
Where was your emergency,
on the Seven Seas?

1478
01:21:56,854 --> 01:21:59,588
I am so sorry,
this is so embarrassing.

1479
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:02,291
Um, Barry, you leave me
no choice.

1480
01:22:04,828 --> 01:22:06,895
Are you gonna fire me?

1481
01:22:06,897 --> 01:22:08,897
You know how important today
was to the building, Barry.

1482
01:22:08,899 --> 01:22:11,533
Just in time for the fireworks.

1483
01:22:11,535 --> 01:22:13,936
I just want you to know
that we do not condone

1484
01:22:13,938 --> 01:22:16,972
this behavior and our dress code
is strictly enforced

1485
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:18,907
at all times.

1486
01:22:18,909 --> 01:22:21,443
Barry, I'm gonna have
to let you go.

1487
01:22:21,445 --> 01:22:23,278
Shocker.

1488
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,213
You're fired!

1489
01:22:24,215 --> 01:22:26,582
Not so fast, Ms. Bianca.

1490
01:22:26,584 --> 01:22:28,717
I believe the building's owner
and general manager

1491
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,652
may take issue with that.

1492
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,554
Huh?

1493
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:34,223
Surprise!

1494
01:22:34,225 --> 01:22:35,724
The secret's out.

1495
01:22:35,726 --> 01:22:38,293
Bianca, you poor thing,
when you were talking

1496
01:22:38,295 --> 01:22:41,563
to corporate,
you were talking to me.

1497
01:22:41,565 --> 01:22:45,367
No, I've been writing letters
to a Mr. Jeffrey.

1498
01:22:45,369 --> 01:22:47,002
My card.

1499
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:50,772
John Jameson Jeffery,
all my initials are Js.

1500
01:22:50,774 --> 01:22:54,009
My friends call me Mr. Jay.

1501
01:22:54,011 --> 01:22:57,479
You shouldn't, not ever.

1502
01:22:57,481 --> 01:23:01,883
And here you have already met
my beloved team

1503
01:23:01,885 --> 01:23:06,388
and here is my new top guy.

1504
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:08,457
Wait, Mr. Jay,
you own the building?

1505
01:23:08,459 --> 01:23:09,992
Every floor.

1506
01:23:09,994 --> 01:23:12,594
You didn't think I made
my living with balloons

1507
01:23:12,596 --> 01:23:13,629
and puppets, do you?

1508
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:15,297
Had to pay the bills, son.

1509
01:23:15,299 --> 01:23:18,033
You proved today that your heart

1510
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,035
- is in the right place.
- What?

1511
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:23,572
You took the birthday oath
and you dedicated yourself

1512
01:23:23,574 --> 01:23:25,340
to make sure that
no little shaver

1513
01:23:25,342 --> 01:23:28,410
will ever go lonely
on his day of days.

1514
01:23:28,412 --> 01:23:33,048
And today when his job
was in jeopardy,

1515
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,351
he showed us that he knows
what matters most.

1516
01:23:36,353 --> 01:23:37,853
It was my honor, sir.

1517
01:23:37,855 --> 01:23:42,624
And if it weren't for a snake
in the grass,

1518
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:46,895
Barry would have never left
his post and lost his job.

1519
01:23:47,931 --> 01:23:50,465
What do you mean,
what snake in the grass?

1520
01:23:50,467 --> 01:23:54,336
That sneaky, slippery,
slithering...

1521
01:23:54,338 --> 01:23:55,871
snake.

1522
01:23:55,873 --> 01:24:02,544
A reptile,
in a cheap, knock-off suit.

1523
01:24:03,714 --> 01:24:05,314
You think you're smart,
don't you?

1524
01:24:05,316 --> 01:24:08,016
You know who you are?

1525
01:24:08,018 --> 01:24:11,920
You are a bad boy
and a party pooper.

1526
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:14,756
The kind who walks around
here with an expression

1527
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:17,492
like he got a sour stomach
and a tooth ache.

1528
01:24:19,496 --> 01:24:20,829
Excuse me?

1529
01:24:20,831 --> 01:24:24,566
Oh, how's that Jason doing,
hmm?

1530
01:24:24,568 --> 01:24:25,967
I'm sorry, who?

1531
01:24:25,969 --> 01:24:28,036
Your alleged son.

1532
01:24:28,038 --> 01:24:30,072
Let me tell you something.

1533
01:24:30,074 --> 01:24:34,843
When you try to pull a con
by making a phony call

1534
01:24:34,845 --> 01:24:38,747
to a major charitable
institution, Rick,

1535
01:24:38,749 --> 01:24:40,682
if that's your real name,

1536
01:24:40,684 --> 01:24:44,119
you should make sure
that the number is blocked.

1537
01:24:45,823 --> 01:24:48,990
That's preposterous,
you have no proof of anything.

1538
01:24:48,992 --> 01:24:51,960
See, that's where you're wrong.

1539
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:55,464
Once we found out Barry
was sent on a wild goose chase,

1540
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:57,499
we pulled up our phone records,

1541
01:24:57,501 --> 01:24:59,701
got some help
from our pals downtown,

1542
01:24:59,703 --> 01:25:02,838
and traced the number
right back to you.

1543
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,874
Yeah, as an attorney,
you would probably know

1544
01:25:05,876 --> 01:25:09,544
that attempting to defraud
a charitable organization

1545
01:25:09,546 --> 01:25:11,046
is a crime.

1546
01:25:11,048 --> 01:25:13,048
There must be...
there must be some mistake.

1547
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:18,019
Well, the biggest mistake is me
letting people like you

1548
01:25:18,021 --> 01:25:19,921
live in my building.

1549
01:25:19,923 --> 01:25:21,056
You can't be serious.

1550
01:25:21,058 --> 01:25:24,092
I'm very serious, very serious.

1551
01:25:24,094 --> 01:25:26,695
And I would suggest
that you consider

1552
01:25:26,697 --> 01:25:28,930
this conversation
your eviction notice.

1553
01:25:28,932 --> 01:25:30,899
I want you out by tonight.

1554
01:25:31,969 --> 01:25:35,003
Man, man.

1555
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:36,538
Can I keep my parking spot?

1556
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,839
Uh-uh.

1557
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,408
What about my gym membership?

1558
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:41,176
No.

1559
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:43,412
This is not fair.

1560
01:25:43,414 --> 01:25:45,046
- It's not fair.
- Well.

1561
01:25:45,048 --> 01:25:48,650
It's not fair, it's not fair,
it's not fair.

1562
01:25:48,652 --> 01:25:50,419
It's just not fair!

1563
01:25:50,421 --> 01:25:51,520
It's not fair!

1564
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:56,191
Barry, I am so proud of you.

1565
01:25:56,193 --> 01:26:01,696
Your apprenticeship
has been nothing short of a wow.

1566
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,865
You are ready to take over.

1567
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:06,768
My doctor has recommended
that I might think

1568
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:10,071
about slowing down, retiring,
buy a pool and...

1569
01:26:10,073 --> 01:26:11,807
(Indiscernible speech)

1570
01:26:11,809 --> 01:26:14,876
So, I'm leaving you
this entire building,

1571
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:17,112
the International Birthday
Network

1572
01:26:17,114 --> 01:26:19,714
and most importantly,
the puppets.

1573
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:24,453
You are now officially
Mr. Birthday.

1574
01:26:24,455 --> 01:26:29,858
I dub you the second emperor
of birthday land.

1575
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,827
Well, I'm a little overwhelmed.

1576
01:26:31,829 --> 01:26:33,862
Speech, speech, speech, speech.

1577
01:26:33,864 --> 01:26:35,230
Speech!

1578
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:38,233
Uh, uh, well, uh...
as a second emperor

1579
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,836
of the... the...
the birthday land, I guess,

1580
01:26:40,838 --> 01:26:45,841
I would like to declare this day
every year, uh, Mr. Jay Day.

1581
01:26:45,843 --> 01:26:47,909
MR. JAY:
Oh, Barry!

1582
01:26:50,848 --> 01:26:52,547
Mr. Jay.

1583
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,986
Dad, I won.

1584
01:26:57,988 --> 01:26:59,120
What!

1585
01:26:59,122 --> 01:27:00,055
Yeah.

1586
01:27:00,057 --> 01:27:02,524
No, you did not.

1587
01:27:02,526 --> 01:27:06,895
Everybody,
my daughter is officially

1588
01:27:06,897 --> 01:27:09,698
the Spelling Bee Champion
of the universe.

1589
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,967
(Cheering)

1590
01:27:11,969 --> 01:27:14,135
Oh, good for you!

1591
01:27:14,137 --> 01:27:16,004
- Well done!
- BARRY: Well done.

1592
01:27:16,006 --> 01:27:17,639
Check it out.

1593
01:27:17,641 --> 01:27:18,840
Oh.

1594
01:27:18,842 --> 01:27:20,609
I made friends with Tristen.

1595
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:22,277
BARRY:
Excellent.

1596
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:24,212
They finally came around
just like you said.

1597
01:27:24,214 --> 01:27:25,680
And they even want to be a part

1598
01:27:25,682 --> 01:27:27,983
of our next big
birthday mission.

1599
01:27:27,985 --> 01:27:28,850
Really?

1600
01:27:28,852 --> 01:27:30,185
Yeah.

1601
01:27:30,187 --> 01:27:32,554
- Awesome! We have elves.
- Okay.

1602
01:27:32,556 --> 01:27:35,991
We have elves, oh!

1603
01:27:35,993 --> 01:27:37,292
(Growls)

1604
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:38,593
(Laughing)

1605
01:27:41,932 --> 01:27:45,534
EMILY: A year of change
isn't so awful after all.

1606
01:27:45,536 --> 01:27:49,271
And an awful lot
can change in a year.

1607
01:27:49,273 --> 01:27:51,673
I'll never forget my dad
for making me smile

1608
01:27:51,675 --> 01:27:53,575
during those tough times.

1609
01:27:53,577 --> 01:27:56,878
He encouraged me to hold
onto hope a little bit longer.

1610
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,549
And he said, eventually
things will get better.

1611
01:28:00,551 --> 01:28:02,083
And they sure did.

1612
01:28:02,085 --> 01:28:04,286
My next birthday
was a full house.

1613
01:28:04,288 --> 01:28:06,021
Happy birthday!

1614
01:28:06,023 --> 01:28:08,557
EMILY: And I loved
every minute of it.

1615
01:28:08,559 --> 01:28:10,892
It was like all of a sudden
I had all these new aunts,

1616
01:28:10,894 --> 01:28:13,728
and uncles, and friends.

1617
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:15,830
Like the family
I always wanted.

1618
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,165
Oh, thank you, my love.

1619
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:18,033
Let me see that ring.

1620
01:28:18,035 --> 01:28:19,634
Oh.

1621
01:28:19,636 --> 01:28:21,202
Aww, right.

1622
01:28:21,204 --> 01:28:22,237
Huh, yeah?

1623
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,772
You did good.

1624
01:28:23,774 --> 01:28:25,607
EMILY:
And thanks to social media,

1625
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:27,142
the International
Birthday Network

1626
01:28:27,144 --> 01:28:29,778
truly became a real network.

1627
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:32,747
Turns out, Tristen's a wiz
on the computer.

1628
01:28:32,749 --> 01:28:34,849
She was able to get us
over a million likes

1629
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:37,118
in the first week
and really helped us bring

1630
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,054
the IBN into the 21st century.

1631
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:45,794
Happy birthday, dear Emily,

1632
01:28:45,796 --> 01:28:50,932
happy birthday to you!

1633
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:53,168
And many more!

1634
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:56,171
(Cheering)

1635
