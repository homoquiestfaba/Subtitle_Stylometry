1
00:01:24,032 --> 00:01:25,450
<i>I met the two great loves</i>

2
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:29,754
<i>of my life
when I was 10.</i>

3
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:33,458
<i>One was the girl
next door.</i>

4
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:35,159
<i>The other...</i>

5
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:38,396
<i>a mail order bride...
so to speak.</i>

6
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:49,523
<i>Two love stories that
changed my life forever.</i>

7
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,415
<i>Papa! Mail.</i>

8
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:10,422
Huh.

9
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:19,514
This is your wife.
I have a wife?

10
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,616
You will.
This is Sharmila.

11
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:24,936
When you are 22,
you will marry her.

12
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:27,805
But, I don't
love her.

13
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:31,158
Love-shmove.
Here.

14
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:33,812
Go get the milk
for mommy.

15
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:38,466
<i>Yes, we were now in America.</i>

16
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,101
<i>But as you can see,</i>

17
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:44,489
<i>my father held on to
some of his Indian ways.</i>

18
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,658
The Karma Kid
has his ears on.

19
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,760
Huh?

20
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,718
Hurry up,
Smith!

21
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,385
Lickety lick!

22
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:04,425
It's "lickety split!"

23
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:09,964
<i>That was the girl next door.</i>

24
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:12,433
<i>Her name was Amy.</i>

25
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,106
How doing,
Mr. Wilson?

26
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:21,125
<i>My father told me,</i>

27
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:23,393
<i>if you want to get
along with Americans,</i>

28
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:28,032
<i>you should always ask them,
"How doing?"</i>

29
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,268
How doing,
Swanson family?

30
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,223
<i>As for me,</i>

31
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:38,543
<i>I just wanted to be
a good old American boy.</i>

32
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:44,048
<i>And yes,
my name is Smith.</i>

33
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,753
<i>You see, my father
believed,</i>

34
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:50,410
<i>to pursue
the American Dream,</i>

35
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:53,257
<i>you had to have
an all-American name.</i>

36
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:57,295
<i>But what my father
didn't know,</i>

37
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,214
<i>was that "Smith"</i>

38
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:01,549
<i>was a very
common American...</i>

39
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,384
<i>last name.</i>

40
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:12,910
<i>I studied hard
to be American.</i>

41
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,681
<i>Every Thursday,
I watched "Happy Days."</i>

42
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:20,718
<i>My favorite movie was
"Saturday Night Fever."</i>

43
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:23,387
<i>And...</i>

44
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:28,175
<i>I longed to eat
all-American food.</i>

45
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:30,478
<i>So it was time
to be a man.</i>

46
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:34,916
<i>Time to take a bite
of the American Dream.</i>

47
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:50,047
<i>♪ Well you can tell
by the way I use my walk ♪</i>

48
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:52,817
<i>♪ I'm a woman's man
no time to talk ♪</i>

49
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,652
<i>♪ Music loud
and women warm ♪</i>

50
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,143
<i>♪ I've been kicked around
Since I was born ♪</i>

51
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,445
<i>♪ And now it's all... ♪</i>

52
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,377
<i>What was I thinking?
I was a vegetarian.</i>

53
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:15,540
<i>There were a few
cowboys in this town.</i>

54
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,110
<i>Some of them did not care
for this little Indian boy.</i>

55
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,862
Nice bag,
Pocahontas.

56
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,347
I'm not that
kind of Indian.

57
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,750
Well the only good
Indian's a dead Indian.

58
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:30,571
<i>And Billy MacNamara
was one of them.</i>

59
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:37,678
Get him, boys!

60
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:14,386
You boys tryin' to get
yourselves killed?

61
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,500
No, sir.
We're just...

62
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,169
p-playing.

63
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,437
Well, you better go
play somewhere else.

64
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:22,807
Yes, sir.

65
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:24,792
You're, uh,
Captain Mack's boy?

66
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:26,060
Yes, sir.

67
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:27,205
Well, I'd rather not have
to tell your daddy

68
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:28,813
what you've been up to.

69
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,414
We ain't up to
nothin', sir.

70
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:32,567
Well, good.
Let's keep it that way.

71
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:34,602
Have a nice day, boys.

72
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,862
<i>But there was one cowboy</i>

73
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,732
<i>that made up for
all the others.</i>

74
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,100
<i>Butch Brunner.</i>

75
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:53,304
<i>The Lone Ranger.</i>

76
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:59,594
<i>And I wanted
to be his Tonto.</i>

77
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:10,488
Come here, boy.

78
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,439
You know how much
this would cost

79
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,096
in that stupid
grocery store?

80
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,709
Um...
Two dollars!

81
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:16,911
Conversion, please.

82
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,646
Uh, 125 rupees.

83
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,248
Exactly.
That's too much!

84
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:21,983
Cost me only pennies.

85
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,651
You have to
be smart, Smith.

86
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:27,421
Wait.

87
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:29,624
Come and see your
Jack-o'-ladder.

88
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,959
"Jack-o'-lantern."

89
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,613
Here is
your pumpkin.

90
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:38,282
It's supposed
to be big.

91
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:39,867
We have a couple
of months.

92
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,720
It will grow big.
Bigger than your head.

93
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,623
And, orange?

94
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,024
A red marker
fixes it.

95
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,026
Red and yellow
make orange.

96
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:52,146
But pumpkins are
supposed to be round.

97
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,548
Round-shmound.

98
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,427
You will use whatever
I give you.

99
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,868
Here, take
these to mami.

100
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,104
Damn, kids.

101
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,094
In India you take
whatever you get.

102
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,774
No questions.

103
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,476
And don't forget
your shoes.

104
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,011
<i>Yes, papa.</i>

105
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:09,057
Just because we live
in this country

106
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,383
does not mean we have
to become heathens.

107
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,559
Smith!
Smith!

108
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:27,919
I'm sorry I ate animal.
I'll never do it again.

109
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,467
One.

110
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,802
<i>It was the dreaded
Uthak-baithak.</i>

111
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,372
I'm sorry I ate animal.
I'll never do it again.

112
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:36,740
Two.

113
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,620
<i>Punishment reserved for
the worst of transgressions.</i>

114
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm sorry I ate animal.
I'll never do it again.

115
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:41,679
Three.

116
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,923
<i>It was not a violent
punishment,</i>

117
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,715
<i>but a humiliating one.</i>

118
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,094
I'll never do it again.

119
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,337
<i>Spanking would've been
a blessing in comparison.</i>

120
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:51,438
I'll never do it again.
Five.

121
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:53,317
<i>The mere mention
of Uthak-baithak</i>

122
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:55,242
<i>could bring
tears to my eyes.</i>

123
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:58,012
I'm sorry I ate animal.
I'll never do it again.

124
00:09:58,113 --> 00:09:59,479
Six.

125
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:01,225
You eat chicken again,
you will be banished,

126
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:02,950
straight to India.
Understood?

127
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:05,607
<i>I'm sorry I ate animal.
I'll never do it again.</i>

128
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:07,121
<i>Seven.</i>
Papa, it's enough.

129
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:08,445
No, he needs
to finish.

130
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:09,579
You will do
all ten.

131
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:11,242
You understand,
chicken boy?

132
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:16,101
I'm sorry I ate animal.
I'll never do it again.

133
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,181
Eight.

134
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,505
What's going on, Papa?

135
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,633
Never you mind.

136
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,623
Come, help me in
the kitchen, Asha.

137
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:23,980
But, mami, I have
to study with Betsy.

138
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:26,741
Go help, mami.
Asha.

139
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:29,376
Keep going.

140
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:32,034
I'm sorry I ate animal.
I'll never do it again.

141
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:33,414
Okay, that's enough.

142
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:36,500
Go to your room
and study.

143
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:37,869
Wait.

144
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,603
Where's the milk change?

145
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,390
I'm sorry I spent
the milk change on chicken.

146
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,848
I'll never do it again.

147
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:53,818
<i>One.</i>

148
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,303
<i>The term "human anatomy"</i>

149
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,182
<i>comprises a consideration
of the various structures</i>

150
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:00,124
<i>which make up
the human organism.</i>

151
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,703
<i>In a restricted sense,
it deals merely with the parts</i>

152
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,005
<i>which form the fully
developed individual,</i>

153
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,542
<i>and which can be rendered
evident to the naked eye,</i>

154
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,367
<i>by various methods
of dissection.</i>

155
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,746
<i>In addition to deciding</i>

156
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:11,914
<i>who I would marry,</i>

157
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:15,489
<i>my father had decided
my profession, too.</i>

158
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,025
<i>I was to be a doctor.</i>

159
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:20,194
<i>Specifically,
a neurologist.</i>

160
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,433
<i>Fortunately, there were
certain distractions.</i>

161
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:29,201
<i>And I wasn't the only one
who was roused by them.</i>

162
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:44,101
<i>Every neighborhood
has that one family</i>

163
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:47,688
<i>that marches to
its own drumbeat.</i>

164
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:50,657
<i>In our neighborhood,
it was the Brunner's.</i>

165
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,364
<i>They were the
talk of the town.</i>

166
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,333
<i>The subject of rumors
at Bible study.</i>

167
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,836
<i>The gossip at
the local hair salon.</i>

168
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,876
<i>Like lions in
the Serengeti...</i>

169
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:14,298
<i>They were beasts to
be admired, and feared.</i>

170
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,752
<i>But more than admired them,
I loved them.</i>

171
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:20,555
<i>In fact, I thanked them.</i>

172
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,557
<i>Were it not for their moments
of unbridled lawn sex,</i>

173
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,361
<i>I would not have Amy.</i>

174
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:29,680
<i>My first love.</i>

175
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,265
Hmm.

176
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,484
<i>There she was,</i>

177
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:36,387
<i>a touch of Heaven
a mere 30 yards from me,</i>

178
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:39,490
<i>yet a Heaven
unreachable.</i>

179
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,847
<i>A distance I was
unable to cross.</i>

180
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:58,119
<i>I still remember the first
time she spoke to me.</i>

181
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,518
Wanna be
my partner?

182
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,054
<i>Would I?
Are you kidding?</i>

183
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:28,505
Huh?

184
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:30,807
<i>Which in Hindi
means "yes."</i>

185
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:34,328
<i>Is everybody partnered up?</i>

186
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:35,595
Okay.

187
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:38,265
And, five, six,
seven, eight.

188
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,972
<i>♪ My baby moves
at midnight night ♪</i>

189
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,943
<i>♪ Goes right until
the dawn ♪</i>

190
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:09,664
<i>♪ My woman takes
me higher ♪</i>

191
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,932
<i>♪ My woman keeps... ♪</i>

192
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:11,412
<i>What are you staring at,</i>

193
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:14,669
<i>pervert?</i>

194
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,123
You should talk to her instead
of being a Peeping Tom.

195
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,759
Oh, god.

196
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:24,027
Smith, come here.

197
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,296
Do I smell
like curry?

198
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:27,515
Yes.

199
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,633
This smell
is impossible!

200
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,086
I thought Patrick
likes Indian food?

201
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:34,154
Shh!

202
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:35,622
I'm studying
with Betsy.

203
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:38,724
You remember that, and I
won't go telling mami and papa

204
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:41,361
about your little
sick habit.

205
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:44,715
Smith, you want to get
along around here?

206
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:48,568
Rule one: don't go telling
mami and papa everything.

207
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:50,504
They'll never
understand, anyway.

208
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,572
<i>Ah! There were rules.</i>

209
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:54,641
<i>I had no idea.</i>

210
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,560
I need to rid
of this smell.

211
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:58,796
<i>I resolved to pay
closer attention.</i>

212
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,400
Nalini, this
is good news.

213
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:07,271
The Ramesh Bhai is
offering 250,000 rupees

214
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:08,739
for Sharmila.

215
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,107
That's...

216
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:14,544
Five thousand dollars.

217
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,780
Not bad for
our chicken boy.

218
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:18,342
<i>We can put it
towards the gas bill,</i>

219
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,727
finally get some
heat in here.

220
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,251
It's so cold
at night, papa.

221
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:23,181
Put on another sweater
if you're so cold.

222
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:25,672
You're so conjoos.
Just put the heat on.

223
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:26,907
I'll light
the fire.

224
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,176
Let me just enjoy
my chai first.

225
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:30,794
She's beautiful.

226
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:33,097
They look
lovely together.

227
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,698
Mami!

228
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,694
How many times must
I remind you to remind me

229
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:37,885
that the chai is hot?

230
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:40,504
Papa, I brought
you a saucer, now.

231
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:42,490
Oh.

232
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,323
<i>As my parents debated</i>

233
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,042
<i>my matrimonial value,</i>

234
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:48,979
<i>my sister was about to
get away with murder.</i>

235
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,016
Papa will never let
you go before supper.

236
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,952
Learn from
the master.

237
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:56,269
Bye!

238
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:59,256
Bye!

239
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,259
See?
Told you.

240
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,010
She's not
having supper?

241
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:06,480
Well, Betsy, no?

242
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:08,849
Who is Betsy?

243
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,050
Uh...

244
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:11,818
Papa,
we're a family.

245
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,586
We should have
dinner together.

246
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,744
Like in India,
on the table.

247
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,147
Bye!

248
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,317
<i>Stop.
Come in here.</i>

249
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,485
Where are
you going?

250
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,538
Ah...
outside?

251
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:34,425
<i>Nothing doing.
Go back to your studies.</i>

252
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,993
But my eyes hurt.

253
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,061
Come here, Patel.

254
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:39,363
Come now.

255
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:42,400
Go set
the table, okay?

256
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,501
Hm? We're gonna eat
in a few minutes.

257
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:47,047
You don't want his eyes
to get worse, do you?

258
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:48,370
Here, now.

259
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,377
Ruko.

260
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,379
Thank you, Patel.

261
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:00,394
<i>It hasn't been
easy for Smith.</i>

262
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:02,262
<i>He has no friends here.
Everyone makes fun of him.</i>

263
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:04,631
<i>At least in India he had
someone to play with.</i>

264
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,323
<i>I never hear
the boy complain.</i>

265
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:07,191
We're much
happier in India.

266
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,391
I had Lata.

267
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:09,520
I didn't my own dishes,
I didn't wash my own clothes.

268
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:10,804
I never cleaned
my own toilet.

269
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,884
Here, no Lata,
no servant, no nothing.

270
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:13,885
I'm doing it all.

271
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:15,466
Be patient, mami.

272
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:18,635
When we go back, we will
live like rajas and ranis.

273
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:21,972
We will live the American
Dream, in India.

274
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:24,341
<i>I don't want to
live like a queen, papa.</i>

275
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,109
<i>I just want
someone to talk to.</i>

276
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,272
You don't even let me
invite that Avon lady in.

277
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:29,396
She's no friend.

278
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:30,991
Besides, you have
the make up.

279
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:32,443
And the Wilson's, when they
brought us an apple pie,

280
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,445
I could have returned the favor
with a spinach paneer.

281
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:36,103
But you said "no."

282
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,588
The Wilson's.

283
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,501
They come to my house and tell
me that my gods are worthless.

284
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:42,192
That only that
the Jesus saves.

285
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,760
Still nice
people, papa.

286
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:45,239
Give them the spinach
paneer and you'll see

287
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:48,015
a cross burning in our
vegetable garden.

288
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:52,285
Besides, none of us
liked the apple pie.

289
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:53,686
I liked the apple pie.

290
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,038
Oy, chup!

291
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,373
See that?

292
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:58,802
Today it's the apple pie,
tomorrow it's the Jesus.

293
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:01,160
I swear I will send that
boy back to India,

294
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:02,062
he keeps it up.

295
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:04,998
<i>More talk of banishment.</i>

296
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,000
Smith!

297
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:10,787
Get the axe.

298
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,439
The axe?
The axe.

299
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,326
Yes, go get
the axe.

300
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,205
<i>It seemed like
a harsh punishment</i>

301
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,530
<i>for merely
liking apple pie.</i>

302
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,451
The Wilson's.

303
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,188
Good.
Keep practicing.

304
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,360
So this Halloween thing
is coming up again.

305
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:35,679
Yes, can I go
this year?

306
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,981
Maybe you would like
to go as a doctor.

307
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:41,051
A neurosurgeon.
It pays to specialize.

308
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:45,255
Yes...
or, maybe Darth Vader?

309
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:46,624
Doctor Vader?

310
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:49,493
Does he specialize?

311
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,678
Um...
kind of.

312
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:54,391
And just our luck,
it falls on Diwali this year.

313
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:56,183
Definition, Diwali.

314
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:58,185
The festival of lights.
Our new Year.

315
00:18:58,209 --> 00:18:59,209
Good.

316
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:02,355
Well, let's see what
mami can put together.

317
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:04,345
Go ahead, keep chopping.
Chop chop.

318
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,945
So, what do you think
of these all-American

319
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:11,948
metal grilling contests?

320
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:14,351
It's not a contest,
it's a barbecue.

321
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:16,019
I know barbecue.

322
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,532
I'm just saying, do you think
we should have one on Sunday?

323
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:19,590
Sunday's no good.

324
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,558
Everyone will
be in church.

325
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:24,494
Ah, forget it, then.

326
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:26,847
The Brunners never
go to church.

327
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,149
The Brunners, huh?

328
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:33,387
Okay.
Get the wood inside.

329
00:19:43,698 --> 00:19:45,765
Patel, where is
your papa?

330
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:47,205
His tea's
getting so cold.

331
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,496
Hm?

332
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,610
It is done.

333
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:57,778
What is done?

334
00:19:57,879 --> 00:19:59,768
The Brunners are
coming over Sunday

335
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:02,366
for a metal
grilling barbecue.

336
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,684
You invited them?

337
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,569
<i>Of course
I invited them.</i>

338
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,115
But when the square bricks

339
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:09,218
start coming
through the windows...

340
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,841
...don't blame me.

341
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,976
What...
what will I make?

342
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:15,855
Oh, I could make them
apple pie, or maybe the corn,

343
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,714
uh, Patel,
what-what do they eat?

344
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:20,384
Uh, hot dogs, hamburgers...

345
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,351
Uh-huh?
Nonsense.

346
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:23,452
We will cook vegetables
on the grill.

347
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,989
The onions, the eggplants,
the chili pepper.

348
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,007
All from our
home-grown garden.

349
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:29,509
They will love it.

350
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,472
Papa, uh, I think we should
really give them something

351
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,162
that they will eat,

352
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:34,041
or something
that they will like.

353
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,732
When you go to Rome,
you do what the Italians do.

354
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:56,036
<i>It was Sunday.
Sweet Sunday.</i>

355
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:57,971
<i>And the Brunners
would soon arrive</i>

356
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:00,173
<i>for a metal
grilling contest.</i>

357
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:13,863
<i>While my mother was in
the kitchen, trying to</i>

358
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:17,874
<i>figure out how to prepare
vegetables for grilling...</i>

359
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:21,361
<i>My father was in the backyard
adding a little more charcoal</i>

360
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:23,897
<i>to that old grill.</i>

361
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,567
<i>And my sister, she was
priming herself</i>

362
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:30,737
<i>for another study
session with the Betsy.</i>

363
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,877
<i>It was Sunday,
and the Brunners...</i>

364
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:38,562
<i>the sweet Brunners...</i>

365
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:40,464
<i>were only a half
an hour away.</i>

366
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:44,034
What's cookin'?

367
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,488
<i>Or not.</i>

368
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:50,000
Dad, it's customary
to ring the doorbell

369
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:51,868
and wait for them to open
the door for you.

370
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:53,781
Oh, honey, it's fine.
We're guests.

371
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:55,829
Hello?
Anybody home?

372
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,697
<i>Papa!</i>

373
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,565
<i>Papa, who are they?</i>

374
00:22:00,668 --> 00:22:01,835
They're here
already?

375
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:06,940
You see, I warned you
about these people.

376
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:12,045
Welcome.
Welcome to my home.

377
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,957
Hey, buddy.
Good to see ya again.

378
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,535
So is it two
o'clock already?

379
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:20,196
Oh, no, it's just...
we wanted to come over early

380
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,732
and help you guys out.
Brought a couple beers.

381
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:22,839
Uh-huh.

382
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,607
So who are these
pretty ladies?

383
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:26,927
This is my wife
and daughter.

384
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:28,262
Who's who?

385
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,850
I'm Nalini.

386
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:35,151
Melanie.
<i>Nalini.</i>

387
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:37,153
Melanie... I dated
a Melanie once.

388
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:41,759
I'm Asha.

389
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,083
This is my daughter,
and this is my wife.

390
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,015
Smith!
Come in here!

391
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:52,001
I can see why you keep this
beauty locked up, Oscar.

392
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:53,202
Bhaaskar.

393
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,288
Basker?
Bhaaskar.

394
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:57,641
<i>Butchy.</i>

395
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:58,792
Butchy.

396
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:00,060
I'm sorry, this, uh...

397
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:01,805
This is my sweetheart
here, Nancy.

398
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:02,829
Oh, he is
too cute.

399
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:04,848
Hi, it is so nice
to meet you guys.

400
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:06,561
It's nice to
finally meet you.

401
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:08,085
How are you?

402
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,520
We brought you
apple pie.

403
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:10,838
No.
Yes.

404
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:12,616
Too much trouble.
<i>Yes, yes, of course.</i>

405
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,901
<i>I mean, you just
have to bake it.</i>

406
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,035
But it's like
two hours at 350.

407
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,448
Just in time for dessert.

408
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:18,078
And our little
angel, Amy.

409
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,429
Amy,
get in here.

410
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,530
May I come in Mr. and Mrs. Bhatnagar?

411
00:23:21,554 --> 00:23:22,666
<i>Come in, honey.</i>

412
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:23,767
Come on.

413
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:24,601
Come in right here.

414
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:26,637
This is Amy.
Hello.

415
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:36,847
My son.

416
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:37,948
Oh!

417
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:41,968
Hey, buddy.

418
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:43,436
You know Amy,
right?

419
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:45,760
Yeah, we're both in
Mrs. Reynold's class.

420
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:47,057
Oh.
Oh.

421
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:51,011
You got a whole church
goin' on here.

422
00:23:51,112 --> 00:23:52,896
Looks like
Little Boy Blue.

423
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:56,332
Dad, it's Krishna.
He's a Hindu god.

424
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:58,535
That's right!
Very good.

425
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:00,370
Very good.

426
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,505
Huh.

427
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,516
Is this little
cutie pie you?

428
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:09,490
Oh, that is Sharmila.

429
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:13,132
Smith's wife
when he turns 22.

430
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>I wanted to tell her</i>

431
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:15,369
<i>it wasn't true.</i>

432
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,769
<i>That if she wanted to,</i>

433
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,473
<i>I would marry her
right now.</i>

434
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:21,002
And this is
Asha's husband,

435
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,227
when she turns 18.

436
00:24:28,683 --> 00:24:31,418
So, let us
go grilling!

437
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,587
Let's do it.

438
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:34,921
Uh, show me around.

439
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,795
<i>What do you think?</i>

440
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:43,847
So, uh, what are
we eatin' here?

441
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:45,248
The vegetables.

442
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,067
Oh, and Nalini
made rice.

443
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:48,785
And delicious naan.

444
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:51,788
Grilled vegetables, huh?
Never thought to do that.

445
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:52,900
So, what's naan,
like a chicken

446
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,608
or a beef
or somethin'?

447
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,075
It's a bread.

448
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:57,678
We are vegetarian.

449
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,096
Huh...

450
00:25:00,214 --> 00:25:03,250
Well, we are definitely
not vegetarian.

451
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:05,318
How could you
know that?

452
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:07,253
I'd like to eat
a vegetarian meal.

453
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:09,577
<i>Well, today's your
lucky day, sweetheart.</i>

454
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:10,890
But me
and your mom...

455
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:12,676
we got, uh,
certain needs.

456
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:16,679
I'll be back,
Oscar.

457
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:25,956
<i>That's a barbeque,
buddy.</i>

458
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:26,973
That meat
is done.

459
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:28,758
No, uh, uh, uh.
I got it.

460
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:30,082
<i>We're almost
done here.</i>

461
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:32,645
Ooh, that is good.

462
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:34,598
I'm off to study.
Bye.

463
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,782
<i>See ya later.</i>

464
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:36,415
<i>Bye.</i>

465
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:37,884
<i>Say hello to the Betsy.</i>

466
00:25:37,985 --> 00:25:39,436
Smell it.

467
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:42,989
Let's eat!

468
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,226
<i>Ah, look at
that, huh.</i>

469
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,078
Thank you.
Oh, dear.

470
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,306
So, O-Oscar,
what made you wanna

471
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,314
come to the U.S.
of A. anyway?

472
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:54,193
Well, it's always been
my dream to work in America.

473
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:55,118
As a CPA.

474
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,321
Huh. Uh, th-that's
like a doctor?

475
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,189
A certified public
accountant.

476
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,257
Ah.
Oh.

477
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:02,803
Melanie,
do you have a job?

478
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:03,710
Why should she?

479
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:07,313
I make a base
salary of $32,698.

480
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:08,692
What?
Plus the overtime.

481
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:10,050
No!

482
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,540
Butchy, baby, you are
in the wrong business.

483
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:14,387
Hm.

484
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:15,584
How much
do you make?

485
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:17,996
Well, I'm... You know,
I'm... about that.

486
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,310
It's... No, it is
not that much.

487
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:22,489
But we do manage
to get by. We're good.

488
00:26:22,513 --> 00:26:24,458
<i>Yeah, I'm savin' up,
uh... you know,</i>

489
00:26:24,503 --> 00:26:25,731
I wanna open
my own garage...

490
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:26,449
Mm-hmm.

491
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,577
...like a-like a car
garage, you know?

492
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:29,157
<i>It's not a reliable
business.</i>

493
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:30,547
We've got the Japanese
making cars now,

494
00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:32,422
that never break down.
So what do you expect?

495
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,940
There you go
again, sweetie.

496
00:26:33,964 --> 00:26:36,003
I mean, I've been thinking
about maybe getting a job.

497
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,594
Well, what you need is
a job that has a future.

498
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:41,164
Smith here is going
to be a neurosurgeon.

499
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:43,016
Why a neurosurgeon?

500
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:44,729
Because it pays
to specialize.

501
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:45,085
Hmm.

502
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,496
Oh, my God,
that is so cute.

503
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,048
Right, but h-h-how do you
know he's gonna end up

504
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:49,500
doin' what you
want him to do?

505
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,636
Because if you are
a good obedient boy,

506
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,272
you do exactly what your
father tells you to do.

507
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:57,063
<i>Exactly.</i>
Huh.

508
00:26:57,164 --> 00:26:58,348
<i>Okay.</i>

509
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:00,394
<i>What you need to
do is ask yourself,</i>

510
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,268
what is your
specific skill set?

511
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:02,919
Oh.

512
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,520
What talents
do you possess?

513
00:27:04,544 --> 00:27:05,004
Ooh.

514
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:06,990
Okay, skill set.
I like that.

515
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:08,352
You know I've got
talents, honey.

516
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,041
Skill set, yeah.
Yeah.

517
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:10,409
In the bedroom.

518
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,795
That's my skill set.

519
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,830
<i>It's true.</i>

520
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:16,449
Oh, honey<i> .</i>

521
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,752
Uh... all right,
here we go.

522
00:27:18,852 --> 00:27:21,254
Oscar, look at that.
Uh huh.

523
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:23,767
That's for you, sweetheart.
Thank you, my darlin'.

524
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:24,457
Thank you so much.

525
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:25,868
You want me to
take your plate?

526
00:27:25,892 --> 00:27:26,526
Okay, she's good.

527
00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:28,444
All right, kids,
before we eat,

528
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:29,880
<i>who wants to
play a game?</i>

529
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,447
Uh, me.
Me, too!

530
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:33,343
All right, this is
a very serious game, okay?

531
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,835
It's called, uh,
Don't You Dare Laugh.

532
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:36,753
Uh-uh.

533
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:38,398
<i>So we all look at each
other real serious,</i>

534
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:40,066
<i>and-and the first person
who laughs, loses.</i>

535
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:40,824
<i>Ready?</i>

536
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,561
One, two,
three, go.

537
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,597
Right here, Oscar.
Right here.

538
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:51,784
Ahhh!
I couldn't...

539
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:53,653
You laughed.

540
00:27:53,754 --> 00:27:55,155
<i>It was Sunday.</i>

541
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,424
<i>Sweet Sunday.</i>

542
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,581
<i>And while my neighbors
were at church,</i>

543
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:00,926
<i>trying to
reach Heaven,</i>

544
00:28:01,028 --> 00:28:03,813

00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:05,915

Me, too.

560
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,274
See ya at school.

561
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:06,143
Yeah, see ya.
Bye.

562
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:06,759
Hey, daddy.

563
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,446
Hey, sweetheart.

564
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:10,936
Smith, what are
you doin'?

565
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:11,848
How doing, Butch?

566
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,249
<i>Come on in here.</i>

567
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:18,087
Wow.

568
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,789
Really cool motorcycle.

569
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,992
Thank you, buddy.

570
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,310
It says "Indian."

571
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:25,312
I am Indian.

572
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,047
<i>Yep.</i>

573
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:30,083
Wait.
What is that?

574
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:31,184
This?

575
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:33,925
That's like
a good luck bell.

576
00:29:34,026 --> 00:29:36,977
It keeps all the evil spirits
away when you're ridin'.

577
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:39,342
I think every
bike needs one.

578
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:42,312
Really?
Even mine?

579
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,046
Sure.

580
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:45,915
Cool.

581
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,433
Yep.

582
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:48,935
<i>Smith, come on!</i>

583
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:50,269
<i>Time to make
the table!</i>

584
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,522
I have to go.

585
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:54,707
Your motorcycle
is really cool.

586
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:57,377
I wish I had
a bike like yours.

587
00:29:57,478 --> 00:29:59,362
Bye, Butch.

588
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:03,450
See ya later.

589
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:17,024
I cannot understand
why this mortgage

590
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,614
is not a priority to you.

591
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,518
Why the charge card bill
is not a priority.

592
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
<i>I know what you're get...</i>

593
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:24,664
<i>I'm not-I'm not
sellin' my bike.</i>

594
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:25,749
What costs this much?

595
00:30:25,773 --> 00:30:27,283
I'm not gonna talk
about that anymore.

596
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:28,174
I'm not sellin' my bike.

597
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:29,319
Okay, fine.
Keep it.

598
00:30:29,343 --> 00:30:30,921
Keep your toys.
That's fantastic.

599
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:32,923
But how am I supposed to
pay for our kid's shoes?

600
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:34,674
She doesn't even have
shoes that fit, Butch.

601
00:30:34,698 --> 00:30:36,143
<i>I gotta send
her to school.</i>

602
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,151
Mom?

603
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:40,170
Yeah, baby.

604
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:40,920
What's for dinner?

605
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,633
<i>Something special,
sweetheart.</i>

606
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:44,662
Something your, uh, mom's
been preparin' all day.

607
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:46,475
It's called
a TV Dinner.

608
00:30:46,576 --> 00:30:48,054
Be ready in five
minutes, baby.

609
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:49,940
Yeah, five minutes,
'cause it's a damn TV Dinner.

610
00:30:49,964 --> 00:30:52,249
<i>God, I don't wanna be
this person, Butch.</i>

611
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,184
<i>You just...
you push and you push,</i>

612
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,808
<i>and it's excuse
after excuse.</i>

613
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:56,753
<i>It's not just me.</i>

614
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:57,620
<i>How am I supposed to afford</i>

615
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,389
<i>anything at
the grocery store?</i>

616
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,424
<i>I'm a joke at
the grocery store!</i>

617
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:02,969
I'm the lady clippin'
every coupon...

618
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:03,659
Yep.

619
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,660
...buyin' cheap TV Dinners

620
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:06,428
'cause that's
all I can afford.

621
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:21,411
My parents are
at it again.

622
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,085
Amy...
get inside, please.

623
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:30,620
Your mother needs you.

624
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:33,706
But dad, I wanna
go with you.

625
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:35,008
Smith.

626
00:31:35,108 --> 00:31:38,220
Promise me you'll take care
of my little girl, all right.

627
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:43,783
Dad.

628
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,842
I'm sorry.
I'm...

629
00:31:52,943 --> 00:31:54,928
It's okay.

630
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,085
Just-just promise me
that you'll never

631
00:31:57,109 --> 00:31:59,782
leave us until you
go to marry that girl.

632
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:01,601
I promise.

633
00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:05,004
Don't worry.
He'll be back soon.

634
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,072
Yep.

635
00:32:07,173 --> 00:32:08,340
I'm gonna go inside.

636
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:11,143
Okay.

637
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:12,378
<i>Bye, Smith.</i>

638
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:14,514
Bye.

639
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,398
<i>Love-shmove.</i>

640
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,966
<i>Who needs it?</i>

641
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:57,223
She's pretty, no?

642
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:01,461
I have a surprise
for you.

643
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,995
What is it?

644
00:33:03,096 --> 00:33:05,015
It's a surprise from papa.

645
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,916
Is this my costume?

646
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:10,202
It's your very own,
home-grown...

647
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:13,539
Jack-o-landon.

648
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,875
Mami, that's
not a pumpkin.

649
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:19,011
I know.

650
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:22,198
I'm sorry, Patel.

651
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:26,435
Is my costume ready?

652
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,672
Getting there.
Coming along.

653
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:31,640
I need it by morning.

654
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:32,641
It's all in the note.

655
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:34,143
Don't worry, Patel.

656
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:35,611
Be ready by the morning.

657
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,730
Who am I going to be?

658
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,050
It's a surprise.

659
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:47,473
Mami, can I have
a real pumpkin?

660
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:51,310
We'll see.

661
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:53,913
Mmm.

662
00:33:54,014 --> 00:33:55,899
Come on, go wash
up for supper.

663
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,533
Just the two
of us tonight.

664
00:33:57,634 --> 00:33:58,467
Where's papa?

665
00:33:58,568 --> 00:34:00,136
Papa is...

666
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:03,088
working overtime,
and Asha is studying.

667
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:05,258
With the Betsy.

668
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,577
Hmm?
Yeah?

669
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:11,030

<i>I turned to Ganesh,</i>

<i>the remover of obstacles,</i>

687

<i>the god of safe journeys.</i>

688
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:23,019
<i>And I asked that he
bring Butch home safely</i>

689
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,954
<i>from his present travels.</i>

690
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:44,189
Wake up, doofus.

691
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:52,831
Go to bed.

692
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:07,846
I had the best night, Smith.

693
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:12,284
I was charming
and wonderful.

694
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:14,236
Do you like it here?

695
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,974
I love America.

696
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,311
The boys are so handsome.

697
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:25,331
Not as handsome as
my little brother, but...

698
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:30,987
Can you keep a secret?

699
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,040
<i>This was serious.</i>

700
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:39,412
You know,
Patrick and I...

701
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,047
we're in love.

702
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:43,099
<i>Very serious.</i>

703
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,756
<i>With my sister
already paired</i>

704
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,898
<i>with a suitable
boy in India,</i>

705
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:49,438
<i>the punishment
would surely be...</i>

706
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:51,474
<i>banishment.</i>

707
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:54,410
He's smart, and charming.

708
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:56,579
He thinks I'm beautiful.

709
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:00,683
When we first
saw each other,

710
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:03,853
we just knew.

711
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,489
You just know.

712
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,927
<i>Whoo!</i>

713
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,746
Oh.
Your hero's home.

714
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:15,848
Bet he's wasted.

715
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:19,602
<i>I sold my bike!</i>

716
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:21,504
To a guy with
some money.

717
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:23,873
Yeah.
Honey, I'm home.

718
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:28,961
Yep.
Wasted.

719
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:30,780
<i>Butchy.</i>

720
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:31,881
<i>Are you okay?</i>

721
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,017
Yeah.
Great!

722
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,385
Got a little
somethin' for ya.

723
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:38,554
Where's your bike?

724
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,556
A big wad of these.

725
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,691
Here you go.

726
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,460
What did you do?
I sold it.

727
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,562
I sold my bike.

728
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,764
'Cause I love you.

729
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,310
I didn't want
you to do it.

730
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:52,535
Ah, it's all right,
I'll get another one.

731
00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:54,887
Smith!

732
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,391
Butch sold his bike, buddy!

733
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:01,310
Gone!

734
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:03,189
You're the only
Indian I got now.

735
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,634
Ha.

736
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:09,752
Go to bed.

737
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,754
<i>Thank you, Lord Ganesh.</i>

738
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:14,290
<i>Thank you.</i>

739
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:22,632
Good night.

740
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,967
Good night.

741
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:01,854
Where is mami?

742
00:39:01,955 --> 00:39:03,989
"Where is mami?"
Just sit down.

743
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:09,404
Your silly costume broke
the sewing machine needle.

744
00:39:09,505 --> 00:39:11,172
And she's out
trying to fix it.

745
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,798
But I need it
for school.

746
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,733
Chup.
Eat your breakfast.

747
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:19,105
Mami will bring it
to school for you.

748
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:22,858
Asha!
Breakfast!

749
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,071
I work the overtime,

750
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,230
and this is what
I have to show for it.

751
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,790
How doing?
How doing?

752
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:40,425
Um, it's very important.

753
00:39:40,526 --> 00:39:42,461
I need a sewing needle.
It's, uh...

754
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:43,829
Read the sign, lady.

755
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,641
We don't open for
another ten minutes.

756
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:46,498
Um, okay.

757
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,001
But it's-it's for today,
uh, sewing a, uh,

758
00:39:49,102 --> 00:39:51,436
Halloween costume.

759
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:54,373
Please?
One needle.

760
00:40:27,524 --> 00:40:29,291
Come on!

761
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,261
Bye, papa!

762
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:34,257
<i>Remember I won't
be home for supper!</i>

763
00:40:34,347 --> 00:40:35,347
<i>I know, I know.</i>

764
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:37,066
<i>Studying with the Betsy.</i>

765
00:40:38,684 --> 00:40:40,953
Hey, where's your costume?

766
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:42,087
Whoo!

767
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:57,663
Come on, get in the car.
I'm already late.

768
00:40:57,687 --> 00:40:58,737
I'll ride my bike.

769
00:40:58,838 --> 00:40:59,838
No you won't.

770
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:09,765
Ah!

771
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:23,562
All right, okay,

772
00:41:23,663 --> 00:41:27,333
Let's finish up with
the Jack-o-lanterns.

773
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:31,703
And now is your last chance
to check your costumes.

774
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:42,531
I hope your mama gets here
before the costume contest.

775
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:46,035
In future,

776
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,025
make sure your mama
reads the notes

777
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:49,572
that we send home.

778
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,896
And if she needs help
understanding them,

779
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,955
she can always call me.
Okay?

780
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,114
<i>There were many things</i>

781
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,938
<i>my mother, with her master's
degree in English Lit</i>

782
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:03,168
<i>did not understand.</i>

783
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:05,154
<i>But English was
not one of them.</i>

784
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:10,476
Damn stupid needle.

785
00:42:14,247 --> 00:42:15,414
<i>Okay.</i>

786
00:42:15,515 --> 00:42:18,567
<i>Now, who is
going to win...</i>

787
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:21,503
this genuine light saber

788
00:42:21,604 --> 00:42:25,157
that I got off
Obi-Wan Kenobi. Hm?

789
00:42:25,258 --> 00:42:27,442
<i>Well, let
the voting commence.</i>

790
00:42:27,543 --> 00:42:29,528
Cindy, you go first.

791
00:42:35,568 --> 00:42:37,236
Okay.

792
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:39,349
<i>Now who votes
for Cindy?</i>

793
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,731
<i>Steven, stand.
Come on.</i>

794
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:57,039
<i>Who votes for
the Swanson boys?</i>

795
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,008
<i>Okay. Billy.</i>

796
00:43:07,744 --> 00:43:08,744
<i>Good job.</i>

797
00:43:08,768 --> 00:43:10,102
How many votes
for Billy?

798
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:14,022
Amy.

799
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,687
How many votes
for Amy?

800
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,445
Okay.
Has everybody gone?

801
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:37,556
<i>Oh, Smith, sweetie,
that's okay.</i>

802
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,314
You can stay seated.

803
00:43:39,415 --> 00:43:41,283
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

804
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:42,718
I vote for Smith.

805
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:45,597
Billy, that's not funny,
he doesn't have a costume.

806
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:47,956
That's the best little
Indian boy costume

807
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,974
I've ever seen.

808
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,844
I mean, who else
votes for Smith?

809
00:43:52,945 --> 00:43:54,246
Come on.

810
00:43:54,347 --> 00:43:56,347
He's not that kind
of Indian, stupid.

811
00:43:56,371 --> 00:43:58,601
All right.

812
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,837
Amy and Smith,
sittin' in a tree.

813
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,907
K-I-S-S-I-N-G!

814
00:44:05,008 --> 00:44:05,841
<i>Billy!</i>

815
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,109
First comes love,
then comes marriage...

816
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,579
Thank you.

817
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:21,090
Smith, wait up.

818
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,092
Slow down.
Can I walk with you?

819
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,961
It's a free country.

820
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:28,030
Hey, watch.

821
00:44:33,436 --> 00:44:34,653
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

822
00:44:34,754 --> 00:44:36,888
<i>I could smell
the Johnson & Johnson</i>

823
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:39,358
<i>rising up from her hair.</i>

824
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:40,175
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

825
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,110
<i>Oh, no.</i>

826
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,211
<i>That's okay.</i>

827
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,513
Um, what happened
to your costume?

828
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:46,337
My mom was supposed
to bring it.

829
00:44:46,361 --> 00:44:47,783
I guess she forgot.

830
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:49,295
Yeah, I made my own
costume 'cause I knew

831
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,787
my parents would forget
to buy me one.

832
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:54,806
Hey, if your mom never
makes your costume,

833
00:44:54,907 --> 00:44:56,708
then we can make one up.

834
00:44:56,809 --> 00:44:59,198
We could be like
the two hobos or something.

835
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:01,483
My dad's got a bunch
of extra suits.

836
00:45:01,584 --> 00:45:02,498
I mean,

837
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,877
if you wanna go
trick-or-treating with me.

838
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:05,417
Okay.

839
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:06,135
Okay.

840
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,236
You got a date.

841
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,331
Come over as
soon as possible

842
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:09,967
so we can hit
a lot of houses.

843
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:10,991
Okay.
Okay.

844
00:45:11,023 --> 00:45:12,641
Bye.
See ya later.

845
00:45:12,742 --> 00:45:13,642
Okay.

846
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:17,646
<i>K-I-S-S-I-N-G.</i>

847
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,497
<i>Indeed.</i>

848
00:45:23,653 --> 00:45:24,820
Mami!

849
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:26,322
<i>I'm in the kitchen!</i>

850
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,968
Papa said you were going to
bring my costume to school.

851
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,492
So sorry, beta.
I tried

852
00:45:30,593 --> 00:45:31,760
But the needle broke.

853
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:32,894
Twice.

854
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,397
So no costume?

855
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:38,167
I finished it.
Finally.

856
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,835
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

857
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:41,736
It's a Diwali present!

858
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:44,306
Diwali present?
But it's Halloween.

859
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:45,963
You can have it
after dinner.

860
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,176
And after our tea.

861
00:45:48,688 --> 00:45:49,688
Come on, why don't you
finish your homework quickly,

862
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:52,268
before papa comes home
and doesn't let you out.

863
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:53,315
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

864
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,351
<i>Just my luck.</i>

865
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:59,104
<i>Diwali fell on
Halloween this year.</i>

866
00:45:59,205 --> 00:46:01,573
<i>So much to do.
So little time.</i>

867
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:17,739
Slow down.

868
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,685
You can not rush God's
invitation to our home.

869
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,142
You must invite each god,

870
00:46:21,243 --> 00:46:23,094
one at a time.

871
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:24,379
<i>One at a time?</i>

872
00:46:26,282 --> 00:46:27,894
<i>For the first time
in my life,</i>

873
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,185
<i>I saw the advantage
in believing in...</i>

874
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:31,286
<i>one god.</i>

875
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:39,127
I'm done.

876
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,063
Can I go put my costume on
and go trick-or-treating?

877
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:45,522
You're going
to eat first,

878
00:46:45,601 --> 00:46:48,324
then you're going to put
up the lights for Diwali.

879
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,909
Can you do that?

880
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,277
Or you can stay home.

881
00:47:22,983 --> 00:47:23,983
Mami!

882
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,674
The trick-or-treaters
are here!

883
00:47:25,698 --> 00:47:27,866
I need my costume!

884
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,780
I hope you like it.

885
00:47:31,881 --> 00:47:32,781
Enjoy, Patel.

886
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:33,549
Mami, come.

887
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,994
The game is
about to begin.

888
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,074
Papa, let's give the children
real treats this year, no?

889
00:47:38,098 --> 00:47:38,720
Nonsense!

890
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:40,821
There's nothing more
real than money!

891
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:44,693
Ah, mami,
they're almost here!

892
00:47:45,061 --> 00:47:46,261
Come!

893
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:51,433
Trick-or-treat!

894
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:54,285
What do we have here?

895
00:47:54,387 --> 00:47:55,647
Mami, what do
you call this?

896
00:47:55,671 --> 00:47:57,055
No wait, don't tell me.

897
00:47:57,156 --> 00:47:57,856
Count Dracula!

898
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,330
No, no, no,
that's not it.

899
00:47:59,354 --> 00:47:59,975
Uh...

900
00:48:00,076 --> 00:48:00,976
shoot, it escapes me.

901
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:04,095
You, of course,
are guitar player.

902
00:48:04,197 --> 00:48:06,798
But do you know how to
play the sitar, huh?

903
00:48:08,835 --> 00:48:11,336
And you are
a punching man.

904
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:13,738
Can we just have
our candy, mister?

905
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,290
Okay.

906
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:17,070
Okay, these
are real coins.

907
00:48:17,143 --> 00:48:19,778
Try and grab as much
as you can with one hand.

908
00:48:22,515 --> 00:48:24,833
<i>Shoot!</i>

909
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:25,900
It's a trick!

910
00:48:26,763 --> 00:48:27,763
That's right.

911
00:48:27,787 --> 00:48:30,188
Trick-or-treat.
You got tricked.

912
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,341
Here's candy.

913
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:38,624
Are you Indian?

914
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:39,797
Why, yes I am.

915
00:48:39,899 --> 00:48:41,844
<i>Then where are your
feathers, chief?</i>

916
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:44,236
Oh, that is a very
original joke.

917
00:48:44,337 --> 00:48:46,271
<i>Uh, dude,
it's Halloween.</i>

918
00:48:46,372 --> 00:48:47,489
Not Christmas.

919
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,690
What a dick.

920
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:53,428
We have to
go back home.

921
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:56,031
I know, papa.

922
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:57,332
<i>Mami!</i>

923
00:48:57,433 --> 00:48:59,417
Coming, Patel.

924
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:00,902
Papa, please
give the candy.

925
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:02,614
Please be nice to
the children this year.

926
00:49:02,638 --> 00:49:04,861
I don't want to spend
all my day tomorrow

927
00:49:04,885 --> 00:49:08,426
cleaning the soap and
the eggs off the windows.

928
00:49:08,527 --> 00:49:09,944
Coming, Patel.

929
00:49:11,931 --> 00:49:12,931
Boo!

930
00:49:15,334 --> 00:49:16,551
Butch.

931
00:49:16,652 --> 00:49:18,819
What's with the Christmas
lights, buddy?

932
00:49:18,843 --> 00:49:19,988
It's Diwali.

933
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:21,089
Tamale?

934
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:22,024
Diwali.

935
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,192
Diwali.
The festival of lights.

936
00:49:24,293 --> 00:49:26,328
Very good.
Very good.

937
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:27,262
So where's that
boy of yours?

938
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,541
He's supposed to go
trick-or-treatin'

939
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,031
with this little tramp.

940
00:49:30,132 --> 00:49:32,350
Oh, come in.

941
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:33,401
Boo!

942
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,437
You got me.

943
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:40,792
Smith.
Come on.

944
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:43,461
So, what do you think?

945
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,697
Oh, terrific, mami.

946
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:48,717
This is a better
than a surgeon.

947
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:51,186
I am not going
out like this.

948
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:52,554
What the hell is that?

949
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:54,489
He's Ganesh.

950
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,575
Ah, another one of
them Hindi gods.

951
00:49:56,676 --> 00:49:57,776
<i>A Hindu.</i>

952
00:49:57,944 --> 00:50:00,389
Hindi is the language,
Hindu is the religion.

953
00:50:00,413 --> 00:50:01,546
Yeah, I know.

954
00:50:01,648 --> 00:50:02,947
He's the god
of journeys

955
00:50:03,048 --> 00:50:05,684
and the remover
of all obstacles.

956
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:07,652
I think he's beautiful.

957
00:50:07,753 --> 00:50:09,054
<i>My gratitude to you,</i>

958
00:50:09,155 --> 00:50:10,756
<i>Lord Ganesh.</i>

959
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,425
All right, well,
you kids go have some fun,

960
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:14,870
and Smith,
promise you'll, uh,

961
00:50:14,894 --> 00:50:16,172
protect this
little girl

962
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:19,047
from all those witches
and goblins and whatnot.

963
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:20,249
I promise!

964
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,400
I'll be fine.

965
00:50:25,071 --> 00:50:26,805
Bye, beta.

966
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:30,309
Don't worry, your daughter
is in good hands.

967
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:32,244
Yes, all four of them.

968
00:50:32,345 --> 00:50:33,611
Get it?

969
00:50:33,713 --> 00:50:37,182
That was a joke, because
Ganesh has four hands,

970
00:50:37,283 --> 00:50:39,061
and what Nalini was
trying to say is that,

971
00:50:39,085 --> 00:50:41,786
if your daughter is with
my son who is Ganesh,

972
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:44,389
she's got four arms
protecting her.

Smith, tonight is not
about the costumes.

1030
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:18,737
It's about
the candy.

1031
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:20,495
And we've only
got eight pieces,

1032
00:53:20,596 --> 00:53:22,430
not including
the religious stuff.

1033
00:53:22,454 --> 00:53:24,843
We can't go home unless
we have at least 50.

1034

Hmm?

1044
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:45,987
You don't want a dead soul
getting inside you, right?

1045
00:53:46,088 --> 00:53:48,755
There could be a mass murderer
living inside you,

1046
00:53:48,779 --> 00:53:50,296
and you wouldn't
even know.

1047
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:53,828
Okay.

1048
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:54,929
Let's go through.

1049
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,975
Hold your breath
and count to three.

1050
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:59,133
One,

00:53:59,234 --> 00:54:01,035

Hey, Amy.

00:54:25,027 --> 00:54:26,628
Who's the elephant boy?

1056
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:28,496
Leave him alone.

1057
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:30,648
He's my cousin.

1058
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:37,305
You don't look like you're
from around these parts.

1059
00:54:37,406 --> 00:54:38,256
No.

1060
00:54:38,357 --> 00:54:40,575

1061
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:43,078

1063
00:54:44,646 --> 00:54:46,348

<i>in quite
the predicament.</i>

1066
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:10,827
<i>I started praying
to Lord Ganesh</i>

1067
00:55:10,851 --> 00:55:13,575
<i>to remove all obstacles
from Amy's path</i>

1068
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:15,293
<i>and the danger
from mine.</i>

1069
00:55:15,394 --> 00:55:16,844
Smith, shut up.

1070
00:55:16,945 --> 00:55:18,613

1071
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:20,848

1072
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,788

00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:27,989
Go.

1074
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:30,958
Trick or treat,
Pocahontas!

1075
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,344
Go! Yee-haw!

1076
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,090
Boy.

1077
00:56:09,114 --> 00:56:11,316
Hope Stan
didn't hurt her.

1078
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:13,318
Gimme the bow.

1079
00:56:13,419 --> 00:56:16,871
Billy, you sure you
want to do this?

1080
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,823
Shut up, Steve.

1081
00:56:18,924 --> 00:56:20,024
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1082
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,726
Could you
let me go, please?

1083
00:56:21,827 --> 00:56:23,361
I need to
find my friend.

1084
00:56:23,462 --> 00:56:25,530
She'll be dead
in a few minutes.

1085
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:27,199
It's all your fault.

1086
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,090
Put the bow
down, boy.

1087
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,991
I'm outta here.

1088
00:56:37,092 --> 00:56:39,994
Butch,
is that you?

1089
00:56:40,095 --> 00:56:41,873
That's right, buddy.
Where's Amy?

1090
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,666
I think she, uh...

1091
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:46,167
<i>Right here.</i>

1092
00:56:46,268 --> 00:56:49,003
Billy, this
is my dad.

1093
00:56:49,104 --> 00:56:51,205
Uh, hello, sir.

1094
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:54,108
What are you doing
there, cowboy?

1095
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:55,510
I was just playing.

1096
00:57:12,778 --> 00:57:16,848
So why were
you being mean?

1097
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:20,418
Amy's the only girl
who's ever nice to me.

1098
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:22,721
Now her and Smith
are hanging out.

1099
00:57:22,822 --> 00:57:24,889
She doesn't
like me anymore.

1100
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,258
Huh.

1101
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,561
Well, here's the thing
about girls, Billy.

1102
00:57:30,662 --> 00:57:31,840
You're gonna have
a much better chance

1103
00:57:31,864 --> 00:57:32,597
at being friends
with them

1104
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:35,666
if you aren't trying
to beat 'em up.

1105
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:37,736
You understand me?

1106
00:57:37,837 --> 00:57:39,704
Yes, sir.

1107
00:57:39,805 --> 00:57:41,572
All right, you
know what to do.

1108
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:57,622
Sorry, guys.

1109
00:57:57,723 --> 00:57:59,390
See you at school.

1110
00:58:06,398 --> 00:58:08,466
<i>I had failed Butch.</i>

1111
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:13,371
<i>I had not protected
his daughter.</i>

1112
00:58:13,472 --> 00:58:15,306
<i>It was a night
I wanted to forget.</i>

1113
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:51,860
Y'ello!

1114
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,529
Anybody home?

1115
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:56,598
Rise and shine!

1116
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,368
How doing, Butch?
How doing?

1117
00:59:00,392 --> 00:59:02,037
Looking good, Bhaask.

1118
00:59:02,137 --> 00:59:03,804
I gotta get me
a pair of those.

1119
00:59:03,828 --> 00:59:04,305
Oh.

1120
00:59:04,406 --> 00:59:05,573
So, what
is happening?

1121
00:59:05,641 --> 00:59:07,152
I was gonna go
hunt some big game.

1122
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:08,486
Thought I'd take
little Smith with me.

1123
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:09,521
You know,
could be fun.

1124
00:59:09,545 --> 00:59:10,378
Toughen him up
a little bit.

1125
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:11,746
Big game,
yeah, sure.

1126
00:59:11,847 --> 00:59:12,881
Toughen him up.

1127
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:13,982
Smith, come!

1128
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,126
Uh, no, I don't think...

1129
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,428
No, no,
it's okay, mami.

1130
00:59:16,529 --> 00:59:18,029
The boy needs
to toughen up.

1131
00:59:18,053 --> 00:59:19,187
Hey, buddy.

1132
00:59:19,288 --> 00:59:21,132
Do you want to go play
the big game with the Butch?

1133
00:59:21,156 --> 00:59:22,040
Oh, yes.

1134
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,541
Good, then go
get ready.

1135
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:24,692
Oh.

1136
00:59:24,793 --> 00:59:25,927
No, it's okay.

1137
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:27,473
Wear somethin'
warm, buddy!

1138
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,464
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

1139
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,802

Look at this,
Smith.

1160
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,820
Fresh tracks.

1161
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:45,156
A doe and a buck.

1162
01:00:45,257 --> 01:00:47,225
What is a doe?

1163
01:00:47,326 --> 01:00:49,127
It's a deer.

1164
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,496
Come on, let's find
a place to hole up.

1165
01:00:57,736 --> 01:00:59,013
<i>And never put your
finger on the trigger</i>

1166
01:00:59,037 --> 01:01:01,204
<i>until you're about
to shoot, you get it?</i>

1167
01:01:01,228 --> 01:01:02,707
<i>Hmm, okay.</i>

1168
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:04,808
All right, right now
we're on safety.

1169
01:01:04,832 --> 01:01:05,832
Okay.

1170
01:01:05,878 --> 01:01:08,378
Another thing is,
never run with a loaded gun.

1171
01:01:08,402 --> 01:01:09,947
It's dangerous
and stupid.

1172
01:01:10,048 --> 01:01:11,983
Is that clear?
Yes, Butch.

1173
01:01:12,084 --> 01:01:14,235
All right, get your
gun out here.

1174
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:16,087
All right.

1175
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:17,856
Let's see what
happens, huh?

1176
01:01:17,957 --> 01:01:20,425
<i>♪ Don't take your
guns to town son ♪</i>

1177
01:01:20,525 --> 01:01:24,228

1178

1179
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,636
You see anything?

1180
01:01:31,737 --> 01:01:33,905
No, but when they
come, watch out!

1181
01:01:34,006 --> 01:01:35,006
Blam, blam!

1182
01:01:35,107 --> 01:01:35,673
Blam, blam, bam!
Hey, whoa, watch...

1183
01:01:35,774 --> 01:01:37,108
Hey, hey.
Hey, Smith, no.

1184
01:01:37,209 --> 01:01:38,765
It ain't
"blam, blam," buddy.

1185
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:39,610
Uh-uh.

1186
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,046
Hunting is
a sacred thing.

1187
01:01:42,147 --> 01:01:44,249
This is real.

1188
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:47,152
Look at the, uh,
American Indian.

1189
01:01:47,253 --> 01:01:48,953
When he kills
an animal, he...

1190
01:01:49,054 --> 01:01:50,554
he bends down
in front of it

1191
01:01:50,578 --> 01:01:52,856
and thanks it for giving its
life for him and his people.

1192
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,641
You know?

1193
01:01:53,742 --> 01:01:56,610
And he-he says
prayers for it.

1194
01:01:56,711 --> 01:01:58,767
Then he uses every
bit of that animal,

1195
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:00,214
every bone
and tendon,

1196
01:02:00,315 --> 01:02:03,717
every bit of
meat and fur.

1197
01:02:03,819 --> 01:02:06,020
Nothing gets wasted.

1198
01:02:06,121 --> 01:02:07,438
You understand that?

1199
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,674
Yes, Butch.

1200
01:02:12,444 --> 01:02:14,913
Surprised your dad
let you go hunting.

1201
01:02:15,014 --> 01:02:16,113
Actually,

1202
01:02:16,214 --> 01:02:19,517
I don't think my father
understands big game hunting.

1203
01:02:22,588 --> 01:02:23,621
Hmm.

1204
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,873
Big game...

1205
01:02:41,974 --> 01:02:43,290
<i>hunting...</i>

1206
01:02:43,391 --> 01:02:44,792
Nalini!

1207
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:46,193
Oh, my god.

1208
01:02:46,294 --> 01:02:48,262
Oh, my god.

1209
01:03:01,426 --> 01:03:03,310
Butch.

1210
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:06,096
Butch.
Yeah, buddy.

1211
01:03:06,197 --> 01:03:08,216
Is it okay to
hunt squirrel?

1212
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:10,517
Sure, you can
hunt squirrel.

1213
01:03:31,133 --> 01:03:32,189
What'd you
shoot at?

1214
01:03:32,213 --> 01:03:33,123
A squirrel.

1215
01:03:33,224 --> 01:03:33,991
Did you get him?

1216
01:03:34,092 --> 01:03:35,493
I don't know.

1217
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:38,362
Let's go check it out.

1218
01:03:38,464 --> 01:03:39,641
<i>Just keep looking at the map,</i>

1219
01:03:39,665 --> 01:03:42,283
and see anything that
shows "hunting ground."

1220
01:03:42,384 --> 01:03:43,461
Big game,
look for it.

1221
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:44,385
Why are you
looking outside?

1222
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:45,286
What is big game?
I am looking outside.

1223
01:03:45,387 --> 01:03:47,188
You look at
the map, please.

1224
01:03:52,878 --> 01:03:54,312
Wow, Smith.

1225
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,381
That's some shootin'.

1226
01:03:56,482 --> 01:03:57,398
It's alive.

1227
01:03:57,499 --> 01:03:59,277
Maybe we can take
the bullet out.

1228
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:01,652
No, the bullet
went clear through.

1229
01:04:01,753 --> 01:04:03,854
This guy's
a goner.

1230
01:04:05,557 --> 01:04:07,925
What have
I done?

1231
01:04:08,026 --> 01:04:09,961
Can we do
the prayer?

1232
01:04:11,913 --> 01:04:14,582
Yeah, we can, uh,
we can do the prayer.

1233
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:18,903
Uh...

1234
01:04:19,004 --> 01:04:21,506
great spirit,

1235
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:25,342
mother Earth, father sky,

1236
01:04:25,443 --> 01:04:32,783
uh... sister tree,
brother leaves.

1237
01:04:32,885 --> 01:04:34,251
Before you all,

1238
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:36,687
we wanna thank
this squirrel,

1239
01:04:36,788 --> 01:04:40,190
this generous squirrel
for giving his life

1240
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:43,394
so that we may
live and learn.

1241
01:04:43,495 --> 01:04:46,247
Smith, repeat after me.

1242
01:04:46,348 --> 01:04:49,099
Squirrel, we thank you.

1243
01:04:51,102 --> 01:04:53,471
Squirrel, we thank you.

1244
01:04:58,309 --> 01:05:00,110
It is done.

1245
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:03,481
<i>I had killed an animal
without being provoked,</i>

1246
01:05:03,582 --> 01:05:06,751
<i>but Butch...
had cleansed my soul.</i>

1247
01:05:06,852 --> 01:05:08,630
<i>All right, let's
pack it up, huh?</i>

1248
01:05:12,524 --> 01:05:13,691
And now we're lost.

1249
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:15,342
Where the hell are we?

1250
01:05:15,443 --> 01:05:17,478
I tried to
tell you twice,

1251
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:19,191
but you wouldn't
listen to me.

1252
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:21,292
If it's important,
you must speak up.

1253
01:05:21,316 --> 01:05:22,016
I tried.

1254
01:05:22,117 --> 01:05:26,103
Now our son might kill
something or someone.

1255
01:05:26,204 --> 01:05:27,927
All right, buddy,
let's get home

1256
01:05:27,951 --> 01:05:29,618
and cook up that
squirrel, huh?

1257
01:05:30,425 --> 01:05:33,144
You mean like eat it?

1258
01:05:33,245 --> 01:05:34,878
Yeah, I mean eat it.

1259
01:05:34,979 --> 01:05:36,047
But, I... But...

1260
01:05:36,148 --> 01:05:38,015
Shh, shh, shh.

1261
01:05:38,116 --> 01:05:40,000
Look, look.

1262
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:41,536
<i>Shh, shh, shh.</i>

1263
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,037
You see that?

1264
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:50,077
Stay here, don't move.

1265
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:08,079
Butch!

1266
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:09,413
Butch!

1267
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:17,038
Ow, son of a... That hurts.

1268
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,584
But you told me not to
run with a loaded gun.

1269
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:21,142
Just drive, Smith.

1270
01:06:26,498 --> 01:06:28,599
Yeah, this is Red Hawk.

1271
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:32,737
Uh, got a man down,
a little hunting accident.

1272
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:34,538
We're heading West
on I-47.

1273
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,374
I think we
just passed 213.

1274
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:42,346
Keep an eye out for a blue
and white Dodge truck...

1275
01:06:42,447 --> 01:06:43,748
with a...

1276
01:06:43,848 --> 01:06:46,484
with a little Indian
fella behind the wheel.

1277
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:48,051
Gonna need an ambulance.

1278
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:57,762
Dammit, Smith!

1279
01:06:57,862 --> 01:06:59,363
Watch the road, buddy.

1280
01:07:08,623 --> 01:07:10,224
Smith?
Smith?

1281
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,145
<i>Take care, you know.
We'll call an ambulance.</i>

1282
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:22,236
<i>Hang in there,
Red Hawk, Over.</i>

1283
01:07:22,337 --> 01:07:23,804
Copy that.

1284
01:07:23,905 --> 01:07:25,873
You heard him, Smith.

1285
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,876
You got two miles to
keep us on the road.

1286
01:07:28,977 --> 01:07:32,280
There's probably gonna
be some cops there, too.

1287
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,348
Whatever they
ask you, just...

1288
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:37,551
plead the fifth.

1289
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,787
Plead the fifth, yes.

1290
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:42,206
Wait, Butch,
what is the fifth?

1291
01:07:43,675 --> 01:07:46,444
Butch, Butch,
what's the fifth?

1292
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:47,778
Butch?

1293
01:08:01,459 --> 01:08:02,559
Smith!

1294
01:08:02,728 --> 01:08:04,545
Mami, Papa!

1295
01:08:04,646 --> 01:08:05,679
Are you okay?

1296
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,148
Are you hurt, papa?

1297
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,682
Huh, are you hurt, beta?

1298
01:08:08,783 --> 01:08:10,901
Are you injured, son?

1299
01:08:12,704 --> 01:08:14,054
What-what is...

1300
01:08:14,155 --> 01:08:16,273
Oh, ew.

1301
01:08:16,374 --> 01:08:17,558
Did you kill that?

1302
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,143
Answer the policeman, Smith.

1303
01:08:19,244 --> 01:08:20,578
Uh, I...

1304
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,112
plead the fifth.

1305
01:08:24,382 --> 01:08:25,549
<i>All right, good work.</i>

1306
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:32,439
<i>Did you shoot
Butch Brunner?</i>

1307
01:08:32,463 --> 01:08:33,741
I plead the fifth.

1308
01:08:33,842 --> 01:08:34,975
<i>Make a note, Dick.</i>

1309
01:08:35,076 --> 01:08:37,576
<i>He pleads the fifth to
shooting Butch Brunner.</i>

1310
01:08:37,677 --> 01:08:39,078
Okay, we got that, son.

1311
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:40,965
You know, personally,

1312
01:08:41,066 --> 01:08:43,484
I-I would have
plead the second.

1313
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:45,197
You do what you
feel is right.

1314
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:45,905
Yeah, pleading the second

1315
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:48,171
would have been
the way to go, kid.

1316
01:08:48,273 --> 01:08:49,356
Definitely.

1317
01:08:49,457 --> 01:08:51,758
Now...

1318
01:08:51,859 --> 01:08:54,162
what about this?

1319
01:08:56,831 --> 01:08:59,233
I plead the fifth?

1320
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:01,890
He can't plead the fifth
on a squirrel, can he?

1321
01:09:01,914 --> 01:09:04,739
Uh, no, on a possum
you can plead the first,

1322
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,542
but only if you haven't
already plead the fifth,

1323
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,287
and he's already
plead the fifth.

1324
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,034
<i>Which negates
all of your rights</i>

1325
01:09:11,129 --> 01:09:11,996
to plead the first.

1326
01:09:12,097 --> 01:09:15,365
You're in a heck of
a pickle here, Smith.

1327
01:09:15,466 --> 01:09:17,855
What can I plead that
will cover everything?

1328
01:09:17,879 --> 01:09:19,353
<i>Oh...</i>

1329
01:09:19,454 --> 01:09:21,622
I... Can he plead insanity?

1330
01:09:21,723 --> 01:09:24,408
Squash, squid, squirrel.

1331
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,446
How old are you, son?

1332
01:09:28,448 --> 01:09:29,280
Ten.
<i>Ten?</i>

1333
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,325
<i>Why didn't you tell
us you were ten?</i>

1334
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:33,483
He can't plead the
fifth until he's 13.

1335
01:09:33,584 --> 01:09:34,819
Right!

1336
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,032
I thought because of his
extensive knowledge of the fifth

1337
01:09:38,056 --> 01:09:39,923
that he would
be at least 13.

1338
01:09:40,024 --> 01:09:41,247
Me, too, but he's ten.

1339
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:42,376
<i>Hmm.</i>

1340
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:43,611
I'm sorry, Smitty.

1341
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:48,081
You can't plead the fifth.

1342
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:51,535
What can I plead?

1343
01:09:51,636 --> 01:09:52,636
How's Brunner?

1344
01:09:52,737 --> 01:09:53,871
<i>He's gonna live.</i>

1345
01:09:53,972 --> 01:09:54,638
<i>You get a statement?</i>

1346
01:09:54,739 --> 01:09:55,973
Yeah.

1347
01:09:56,074 --> 01:09:57,974
Said the kid's a hero.

1348
01:09:58,075 --> 01:09:59,960
<i>Saved his life.</i>

1349
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:01,929
<i>You hear that, Smitty?</i>

1350
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,815
You're off the hook.

1351
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:09,069
So, off the record...

1352
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,706
why don't you tell us
what really happened.

1353
01:10:11,806 --> 01:10:13,457
<i>And so I did.</i>

1354
01:10:13,558 --> 01:10:15,947
<i>It was a relief to hear
that Butch was okay,</i>

1355
01:10:15,971 --> 01:10:17,844
<i>and he called me a hero,</i>

1356
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:21,882
<i>and it was good to tell
the policemen my story.</i>

1357
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:25,769
<i>It was a story I was sure my
parents would not appreciate,</i>

1358
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:28,148
<i>but these men thought it
very interesting,</i>

1359
01:10:28,172 --> 01:10:32,776
<i>and for some reason,
very funny.</i>

1360
01:10:32,877 --> 01:10:36,363
<i>The story caused
a bit of a stir,</i>

1361
01:10:36,464 --> 01:10:39,366
<i>and was published
in the local paper,</i>

1362
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:41,669
<i>along with a photo
of my family.</i>

1363
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,872
Okay, everybody,
say, "How doing?"

1364
01:10:44,973 --> 01:10:46,240
How doing?

1365
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:48,609
<i>We quickly became
the talk of the town.</i>

1366
01:10:52,547 --> 01:10:54,531
<i>And being an election year,</i>

1367
01:10:54,632 --> 01:10:57,901
<i>the article caught the attention
of some politicians.</i>

1368
01:10:58,002 --> 01:11:00,804
I am honored to bestow
the key to the city

1369
01:11:00,905 --> 01:11:03,206
to Smith Butt Naked.

1370
01:11:03,307 --> 01:11:04,608
Bhatnagar.

1371
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:06,443
Oh, uh, Mr. Smith.

1372
01:11:06,544 --> 01:11:08,989
Let's give him a round
of applause, shall we?

1373
01:11:15,186 --> 01:11:16,820
<i>Before I knew it,</i>

1374
01:11:16,955 --> 01:11:18,956
<i>I was telling
my story on TV,</i>

1375
01:11:19,057 --> 01:11:20,280
<i>and believe it or not,</i>

1376
01:11:20,358 --> 01:11:22,292
<i>I was invited to The White House</i>

1377
01:11:22,427 --> 01:11:26,864
<i>to meet the president
of the United States.</i>

1378
01:11:26,998 --> 01:11:30,367
<i>I was no longer
just an Indian.</i>

1379
01:11:30,468 --> 01:11:32,002
<i>I...</i>

1380
01:11:32,103 --> 01:11:37,041
<i>was a Bee Gee.</i>

1381
01:11:37,142 --> 01:11:40,610
<i>It was the pinnacle of
my American boyhood.</i>

1382
01:11:53,959 --> 01:11:57,527
Ah, the maharaja
has finally returned.

1383
01:11:57,629 --> 01:11:58,428
Good.

1384
01:11:58,529 --> 01:12:00,752
Go change and come
help me in the garden.

1385
01:12:00,776 --> 01:12:01,776
Jesus Christ.

1386
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:02,949
What did you say?

1387
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:04,451
Nothing, papa.

1388
01:12:04,552 --> 01:12:06,804
You think you are
a superstar now, huh?

1389
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,772
Gallivanting all
over the town.

1390
01:12:08,873 --> 01:12:11,374
But you're no local
hero around here.

1391
01:12:11,475 --> 01:12:14,911
You want to come in,
into your father's house?

1392
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:17,698
Show your respect.

1393
01:12:20,519 --> 01:12:22,369
Ah!

1394
01:12:27,892 --> 01:12:31,361
Jeetay Raho.

1395
01:12:33,175 --> 01:12:34,398
<i>It was good to receive</i>

1396
01:12:34,422 --> 01:12:36,423
<i>my father's blessings...</i>

1397
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:43,957
<i>but sadly, the blessings
did not quite reach...</i>

1398
01:12:44,058 --> 01:12:45,476
<i>the Brunners.</i>

1399
01:12:54,753 --> 01:12:57,938
Oh, man.

1400
01:12:58,039 --> 01:12:59,890
Honey, we gonna
talk about it.

1401
01:12:59,991 --> 01:13:03,827
Are we gonna talk,
or argue?

1402
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:05,168
This isn't fun, Butch.

1403
01:13:05,192 --> 01:13:06,730
It's not fun.

1404
01:13:06,832 --> 01:13:08,566
All right?

1405
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:10,684
I just have to know...

1406
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:12,785
how I'm supposed
to pay the mortgage.

1407
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:14,755
I already told you,
I... My...

1408
01:13:14,856 --> 01:13:17,491
<i>I can't work!</i>

1409
01:13:17,592 --> 01:13:19,593
<i>When my leg heals.</i>

1410
01:13:19,694 --> 01:13:20,894
My mother can help.

1411
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,830
I don't want your
damn mom's help.

1412
01:13:22,854 --> 01:13:23,854
Just let her.

1413
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,566
I mean, what's wrong
with that?

1414
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,184
I can't...
I can't do that.

1415
01:13:27,285 --> 01:13:29,586
I can't let her help.

1416
01:13:36,444 --> 01:13:39,046
When my leg heals,
I'm gonna...

1417
01:13:39,147 --> 01:13:42,882
do what I do,
and I'm gonna fix it.

1418
01:13:42,984 --> 01:13:45,635
I promise.

1419
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:55,012
No, you're not.

1420
01:14:10,478 --> 01:14:11,645
Smith?

1421
01:14:11,746 --> 01:14:13,147
<i>And then...</i>

1422
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:14,804
I have to tell
you something.

1423
01:14:14,828 --> 01:14:18,585
<i>The worst thing
imaginable happened.</i>

1424
01:14:18,686 --> 01:14:22,005
<i>Amy told me she and her
mother were moving far away...</i>

1425
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:25,925
<i>to another school,</i>

1426
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:28,061
<i>to live with
their grandmother.</i>

1427
01:14:31,299 --> 01:14:32,999
<i>And dummy that I was,</i>

1428
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,869
<i>I got mad at her.</i>

1429
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:38,272
<i>From that moment on...</i>
Smith!

1430
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:40,762
<i>I decided I wasn't going
to see her anymore.</i>

1431
01:14:55,106 --> 01:14:56,957
Bye, daddy.

1432
01:14:57,141 --> 01:14:59,843
Bye, sweetheart.
Come here.

1433
01:14:59,944 --> 01:15:02,012
I'll see you soon, okay?

1434
01:15:51,863 --> 01:15:54,531
<i>I wished I had not
gone hunting that day.</i>

1435
01:15:58,586 --> 01:16:01,905
<i>I wished everything could
go back to the way it was...</i>

1436
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:07,678
<i>before hunting,
before fame.</i>

1437
01:16:10,214 --> 01:16:12,716
<i>Before I had ruined...</i>

1438
01:16:12,817 --> 01:16:14,951
<i>the Brunners' lives.</i>

1439
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,207
Hello?

1440
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,755
<i>...the various stages of
its intrauterine development,</i>

1441
01:16:41,779 --> 01:16:43,668
<i>from the fertilized ovum...</i>
Doofus.

1442
01:16:43,714 --> 01:16:45,349
Amy's on the phone.

1443
01:16:49,887 --> 01:16:51,888
Hello?

1444
01:16:51,989 --> 01:16:54,791
Hi, Smith.
It's Amy.

1445
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:56,593
Hi.

1446
01:16:56,694 --> 01:16:59,096
Sorry I didn't say
goodbye to you.

1447
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:01,331
<i>It's okay.</i>

1448
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:03,433
Um, how's school?

1449
01:17:03,534 --> 01:17:05,202
<i>Okay.</i>

1450
01:17:05,252 --> 01:17:06,887
Are you coming back?

1451
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:09,422
<i>No.</i>

1452
01:17:09,523 --> 01:17:11,224
Oh.

1453
01:17:11,325 --> 01:17:13,710
I'm running away, Smith.

1454
01:17:13,811 --> 01:17:15,896
I wanted to say
goodbye to you.

1455
01:17:15,997 --> 01:17:17,147
Where are you going?

1456
01:17:17,248 --> 01:17:19,015
<i>To New York.</i>

1457
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:21,751
<i>I can't stay here...</i>

1458
01:17:21,852 --> 01:17:23,352
It's smells like mothballs,

1459
01:17:23,376 --> 01:17:25,321
and my-my grandma
can't cook, and...

1460
01:17:37,218 --> 01:17:40,253
I think that...

1461
01:17:40,354 --> 01:17:43,356
That my parents
are splitting up.

1462
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,126
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1463
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:53,951
Smith.

1464
01:17:53,953 --> 01:17:55,135
Yes?

1465
01:17:55,236 --> 01:17:57,370
<i>I miss you.</i>

1466
01:17:57,471 --> 01:18:00,207
I miss you, too.

1467
01:18:00,224 --> 01:18:03,827
I wish you were here,
my Ganesh.

1468
01:18:03,928 --> 01:18:06,362
I wish I was
there, too.

1469
01:18:06,463 --> 01:18:07,798
<i>My grandma's coming.</i>

1470
01:18:07,899 --> 01:18:09,900
<i>I have to go.</i>

1471
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:12,702
Bye.
<i>Bye.</i>

1472
01:18:18,876 --> 01:18:20,510
<i>New York?</i>

1473
01:18:20,611 --> 01:18:23,213
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

1474
01:18:23,314 --> 01:18:25,966
<i>Why didn't I try
and stop her?</i>

1475
01:18:26,067 --> 01:18:29,102
<i>She was calling me to
save her, and I said...</i>

1476
01:18:29,203 --> 01:18:31,738
<i>nothing?</i>

1477
01:18:38,106 --> 01:18:39,106
You scared me.

1478
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:39,996
Where's Smith?

1479
01:18:40,097 --> 01:18:41,198
He's in his room.

1480
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:43,244
Tell him it's time
to chop the wood.

1481
01:18:43,268 --> 01:18:45,002
I'll go get him.

1482
01:18:46,754 --> 01:18:47,754
Smith?

1483
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,080
Smith?

1484
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,667
Smith!

1485
01:19:34,768 --> 01:19:36,502
<i>Smith!
Smith?</i>

1486
01:19:36,603 --> 01:19:38,371
<i>His bike's not here.</i>

1487
01:19:38,472 --> 01:19:39,567
Let's go look for him.
Get in the car.

1488
01:19:39,591 --> 01:19:41,091
Papa, they couldn't be far.

1489
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:42,292
He could be, come on.

1490
01:19:42,316 --> 01:19:43,734
Let's get in the car.

1491
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:11,338
My Ganesh.

1492
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:13,022
I knew you'd come.

1493
01:20:13,123 --> 01:20:16,092
At your service.

1494
01:20:16,193 --> 01:20:18,061
I have to catch
the 9:55 bus.

1495
01:20:18,162 --> 01:20:20,196
The 9:55 bus?

1496
01:20:20,298 --> 01:20:22,766
But what about
money, food?

1497
01:20:22,867 --> 01:20:24,534
I packed a bunch
of sandwiches,

1498
01:20:24,558 --> 01:20:26,926
and I borrowed some money
from my grandma.

1499
01:20:27,028 --> 01:20:30,407
I'll pay her back
once I land on my feet.

1500
01:20:30,508 --> 01:20:32,825
Amy, I don't
want you to go.

1501
01:20:32,827 --> 01:20:34,310
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

1502
01:20:34,411 --> 01:20:38,048
I can't protect you
if you're in New York.

1503
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:40,299
But...

1504
01:20:40,401 --> 01:20:42,335
I don't like it here.

1505
01:20:42,436 --> 01:20:44,637
I know, Amy, but...

1506
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:47,273
I don't want to lose
my best friend.

1507
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:12,065
I thought I'd give you
a ride home, cowboy.

1508
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:14,301
Okay, thank you.

1509
01:21:16,554 --> 01:21:19,673
Were you planning on
writing when you got there?

1510
01:21:19,675 --> 01:21:21,641
<i>Any idea where you
two were going?</i>

1511
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:23,676
Smith wasn't going anywhere.

1512
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:26,113
He just came over
here to stop me.

1513
01:21:26,197 --> 01:21:27,880
Hmm.

1514
01:21:27,982 --> 01:21:31,084
You're just all by
your lonesome, huh?

1515
01:21:31,185 --> 01:21:33,269
You sure are brave.

1516
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:38,292
Actually...

1517
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:41,094
I've decided to stay.

1518
01:21:41,195 --> 01:21:43,814
I'm happy to hear that.

1519
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,733
<i>Looks like Smith is, too.</i>

1520
01:21:46,834 --> 01:21:47,600
Why don't you get
back inside

1521
01:21:47,701 --> 01:21:51,838
before we all
catch cold, huh?

1522
01:21:51,939 --> 01:21:53,189
Bye, Smith.

1523
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:55,375
Bye, Amy.

1524
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,761
Bye, dad.
<i>Bye, sweetie.</i>

1525
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,807
Let's go.

1526
01:22:14,812 --> 01:22:16,035
<i>Why would he run away?</i>

1527
01:22:16,096 --> 01:22:16,830
<i>It makes no sense.</i>

1528
01:22:16,931 --> 01:22:18,198
<i>You're the one</i>

1529
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:19,165
<i>that got upset with him
for being a local hero.</i>

1530
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:21,211
<i>You don't think
he has any feelings?</i>

1531
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:21,929
<i>If you ask me,</i>

1532
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:25,738
<i>he has too many
damn feelings.</i>

1533
01:22:25,873 --> 01:22:28,174
<i>Where are we going, papa?</i>

1534
01:22:28,275 --> 01:22:29,042
<i>It's the park,</i>

1535
01:22:29,143 --> 01:22:30,861
<i>where kids go to play.</i>

1536
01:22:32,563 --> 01:22:33,897
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

1537
01:22:33,921 --> 01:22:34,598
<i>Move!</i>

1538
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:37,033
<i>Move out of the way.</i>

1539
01:22:39,837 --> 01:22:41,737
<i>So many damn kids.</i>

1540
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,327
What are they
playing at night?

1541
01:22:54,351 --> 01:22:55,018
How the hell do I know?

1542
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:56,329
Someone must have
seen him.

1543
01:22:56,353 --> 01:22:57,530
He's the local damn hero.

1544
01:22:57,554 --> 01:22:58,598
You check over there.

1545
01:22:58,622 --> 01:22:59,355
Be careful, papa.

1546
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,623
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1547
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:01,691
How doing?

1548
01:23:01,792 --> 01:23:03,292
I'm looking for
a young boy,

1549
01:23:03,316 --> 01:23:04,694
Smith Bhatnagar.

1550
01:23:04,795 --> 01:23:05,795
Bhatnag?

1551
01:23:05,863 --> 01:23:07,597
I've never heard of him.

1552
01:23:07,698 --> 01:23:09,900
Yeah, you know,
man, Smith.

1553
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:12,779
He's the kid that saved
the dude that shot himself.

1554
01:23:12,803 --> 01:23:13,036
Yes!

1555
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:14,971
Oh, yeah.

1556
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,706
That was cool.

1557
01:23:16,807 --> 01:23:17,807
Is Smith here?

1558
01:23:17,842 --> 01:23:19,792
That's what
I'm asking you.

1559
01:23:19,893 --> 01:23:21,644
Oh...
Oh.

1560
01:23:21,745 --> 01:23:22,612
Well, I don't know, dude.

1561
01:23:22,713 --> 01:23:25,448
Yeah, we just got here.

1562
01:23:25,549 --> 01:23:26,766
Nalini!

1563
01:23:26,867 --> 01:23:27,550
<i>Thank you.</i>

1564
01:23:27,652 --> 01:23:29,735
<i>No, nothing, nothing.</i>

1565
01:23:29,836 --> 01:23:31,938
Let's check these people.

1566
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:33,039
Excuse me.

1567
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,640
<i>I'm looking for a little...</i>

1568
01:23:44,368 --> 01:23:46,757
I will never again lie
about where I'm going

1569
01:23:46,781 --> 01:23:47,804
and with whom.

1570
01:23:47,905 --> 01:23:48,905
Two.

1571
01:23:48,972 --> 01:23:50,556
Never, ever.

1572
01:23:50,657 --> 01:23:52,546
We ought to send
you back to India.

1573
01:23:52,647 --> 01:23:53,563
Shame on you.

1574
01:23:53,664 --> 01:23:55,095
I will not.

1575
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:57,731
I will never again lie
about where I'm going

1576
01:23:57,831 --> 01:23:59,299
and with whom.

1577
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,234
Three.

1578
01:24:07,824 --> 01:24:11,244
Butch, what do
I tell my parents?

1579
01:24:11,345 --> 01:24:13,129
Just tell 'em the truth.

1580
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:16,065
I bet your dad will think
you're a real stud.

1581
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:16,899
Really?

1582
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,867
Sure.

1583
01:24:17,968 --> 01:24:20,637
Running after girls,
saving their lives?

1584
01:24:20,737 --> 01:24:24,407
You're like a knight
in shining armor.

1585
01:24:24,508 --> 01:24:26,476
Thanks, Butch.

1586
01:24:27,845 --> 01:24:31,113
Smith, I got you something.

1587
01:24:34,251 --> 01:24:36,486
Whoa.

1588
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,138
For my bike?

1589
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,540
Yep.

1590
01:24:40,641 --> 01:24:43,559
Thanks, Butch.

1591
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,830
Listen, buddy, don't sweat it.

1592
01:24:46,931 --> 01:24:48,497
You're still a kid.

1593
01:24:48,599 --> 01:24:50,700
The best is yet to come.

1594
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:52,736
All right?
Hmm.

1595
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:55,004
Let's go.

1596
01:25:01,028 --> 01:25:03,417
I will never again lie
about where I'm going

1597
01:25:03,441 --> 01:25:04,630
and with whom.

1598
01:25:04,731 --> 01:25:06,933
Twenty.

1599
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:11,187
Mami, what is happening?

1600
01:25:11,288 --> 01:25:13,673
Never you mind.

1601
01:25:13,774 --> 01:25:16,693
And you will never see
that boy again, ever.

1602
01:25:16,794 --> 01:25:19,629
And wipe that nonsense
off your face.

1603
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:22,032
India will definitely
shape you up.

1604
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:27,487
So where the hell
were you?

1605
01:25:27,588 --> 01:25:30,256
Amy decided
to run away, so...

1606
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:31,875
<i>I had to try
and stop her.</i>

1607
01:25:31,976 --> 01:25:35,461
I rode to her grandmother's
house and told her not to go.

1608
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:39,081
She decided to stay.

1609
01:25:39,182 --> 01:25:41,851
<i>Telling the truth felt so good,</i>

1610
01:25:41,952 --> 01:25:45,472
<i>I decided to
let it all out.</i>

1611
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:47,874
I love her.

1612
01:25:52,263 --> 01:25:54,708
You rode all the way
across town on your bike

1613
01:25:54,732 --> 01:25:56,850
to chase after a woman?

1614
01:25:56,951 --> 01:26:00,053
What is wrong with you?

1615
01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:02,655
What is wrong
with our children?

1616
01:26:02,756 --> 01:26:05,424
Whores, all of them.

1617
01:26:05,525 --> 01:26:10,663
<i>Rule one... never tell
mami and papa everything.</i>

1618
01:26:10,964 --> 01:26:12,464
<i>How could I have forgotten?</i>

1619
01:26:12,488 --> 01:26:13,616
Go to your room.

1620
01:26:13,717 --> 01:26:17,553
We'll deal with you
in the morning.

1621
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:32,785
<i>My poor sister...</i>

1622
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:36,956
<i>in love and about
to be banished.</i>

1623
01:26:37,057 --> 01:26:39,926
<i>I wondered if her
heart would ever mend.</i>

1624
01:26:43,397 --> 01:26:45,598
<i>What would I do
without my sister?</i>

1625
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:56,576
<i>That night, my parents
called India,</i>

1626
01:26:56,677 --> 01:26:58,812
<i>an expensive
and rare event.</i>

1627
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:02,916
<i>They stayed up very late
talking to the family,</i>

1628
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:05,402
<i>and deciding
my sister's fate.</i>

1629
01:27:19,149 --> 01:27:21,517
Our hopes for you,
our dreams for you,

1630
01:27:21,618 --> 01:27:24,520
they have all
been destroyed.

1631
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,491
What suitable Indian boy
will marry you now?

1632
01:27:28,592 --> 01:27:32,212
You've been enjoyed.

1633
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,730
<i>Okay, mami, we keep
this in the house.</i>

1634
01:27:34,831 --> 01:27:37,333
But from now on,
it is decided.

1635
01:27:37,434 --> 01:27:40,102
You will go to school,
and that is it.

1636
01:27:40,203 --> 01:27:43,606
No more extra-circular
activities.

1637
01:27:43,707 --> 01:27:44,901
You want to study
with someone?

1638
01:27:44,925 --> 01:27:46,709
Mami and I will need
to meet her first,

1639
01:27:46,711 --> 01:27:48,878
and she will need to
study in our house,

1640
01:27:48,902 --> 01:27:51,087
but no more studying
with the Betsy.

1641
01:27:52,733 --> 01:27:54,634
<i>And as for you...</i>

1642
01:28:04,945 --> 01:28:06,945
Go ahead, mami,
show him the picture.

1643
01:28:10,183 --> 01:28:16,422
Patel, this is
your daddy and baba.

1644
01:28:16,523 --> 01:28:18,190
You remember my parents?

1645
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:20,514
He was three when
we moved to Pune, papa.

1646
01:28:20,538 --> 01:28:22,939
I know that.

1647
01:28:25,932 --> 01:28:28,685
You are going to
live with them...

1648
01:28:28,786 --> 01:28:32,188
<i>in Lucknow.</i>

1649
01:28:32,289 --> 01:28:33,522
But-but...

1650
01:28:33,624 --> 01:28:36,409
that's in India.

1651
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:38,995
Yes.

1652
01:28:41,798 --> 01:28:44,367
Best thing for you, Patel.
Why?

1653
01:28:44,468 --> 01:28:46,953
Why?

1654
01:28:47,054 --> 01:28:49,132
Because he needs to go back
and remember the things

1655
01:28:49,156 --> 01:28:50,957
that you so easily forgot.

1656
01:28:51,058 --> 01:28:54,577
<i>Respect, honor, virtue.</i>

1657
01:29:01,285 --> 01:29:04,420
When will you
come see me?

1658
01:29:07,941 --> 01:29:09,275
Don't worry, Smith,

1659
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:12,996
we'll all be
together again...

1660
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:15,331
in just a few years.

1661
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:27,744
<i>I never did get to watch</i>

1662
01:29:27,845 --> 01:29:28,712
<i>my sister bloom</i>

1663
01:29:28,813 --> 01:29:32,015
<i>into the beautiful
woman she became.</i>

1664
01:29:35,052 --> 01:29:37,253
<i>But she continued
to love Patrick,</i>

1665
01:29:37,354 --> 01:29:39,355
<i>even more than before.</i>

1666
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:50,066
<i>As for Amy, well...</i>

1667
01:29:52,369 --> 01:29:56,990
<i>she lingered on my mind
for some time to come,</i>

1668
01:29:57,091 --> 01:30:01,110
<i>a heaven,
half a world away.</i>

1669
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:10,286
<i>My family never did move
back to India to rejoin me.</i>

1670
01:30:10,387 --> 01:30:13,405
<i>They told me how lucky
I was to have escaped,</i>

1671
01:30:13,507 --> 01:30:17,543
<i>to grow up to be
a respectable boy in India.</i>

1672
01:30:17,644 --> 01:30:21,347
<i>I went to med school
and became a doctor,</i>

1673
01:30:21,448 --> 01:30:27,887
<i>specializing in neurology,
like my father expected.</i>

1674
01:30:27,905 --> 01:30:30,556
<i>At 22, I married Sharmila,</i>

1675
01:30:30,657 --> 01:30:32,692
<i>as I was told I would.</i>

1676
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:36,529
<i>What no one
told me was that...</i>

1677
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:40,933
<i>I would fall madly
in love with my wife.</i>

1678
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:44,921
<i>This was
a wonderful surprise.</i>

1679
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:48,022
<i>I bought a large house for her,
and for a little while,</i>

1680
01:30:48,058 --> 01:30:51,260
<i>we lived like
rajas and ranis.</i>

1681
01:30:54,398 --> 01:30:57,176
<i>I'd like to say we lived
happily ever after, but...</i>

1682
01:31:00,153 --> 01:31:02,455
<i>life has a mind
of its own.</i>

1683
01:31:06,026 --> 01:31:08,595
<i>Over the years,</i>

1684
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:11,196
<i>my mother would send me
letters on a cassette.</i>

1685
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:17,203
<i>She kept me connected to
the place I left behind.</i>

1686
01:31:20,273 --> 01:31:22,909
<i>My mother's voice
made me feel at ease.</i>

1687
01:31:30,183 --> 01:31:33,052

Smith?

1728
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:02,602
You won't believe it.

1729
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:04,804
I shot a 98.

1730
01:34:04,988 --> 01:34:06,289
You shot a what?

1731
01:34:06,373 --> 01:34:08,507
The golf!
I broke 100.

1732
01:34:08,842 --> 01:34:11,360
Now is 98 good
in the golf?

1733
01:34:11,461 --> 01:34:13,429
Good?
It's excellent.

1734
01:34:14,564 --> 01:34:16,766
Great, papa.
I'm very happy for you.

1735
01:34:16,867 --> 01:34:18,517
<i>You're finally back home.</i>

1736
01:34:18,618 --> 01:34:19,535
Come on, hurry up.

1737
01:34:19,636 --> 01:34:21,380
We have to go to Namata's
kid's birthday party.

1738
01:34:21,404 --> 01:34:22,304
I'm coming.

1739
01:34:22,405 --> 01:34:25,458
So many damn
birthday parties.

1740
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:28,977
Ah, I see you found
your old bike.

1741
01:34:29,078 --> 01:34:30,813
You saved it
all these years?

1742
01:34:30,914 --> 01:34:33,048
Oh yes, just for you.

1743
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,433
Don't be ridiculous.

1744
01:34:34,534 --> 01:34:36,051
It's for Asha's kids!

1745
01:34:36,153 --> 01:34:37,153
<i>Oh, boy, okay.</i>

1746
01:34:38,138 --> 01:34:39,138
Come on, papa.

1747
01:34:39,189 --> 01:34:41,074
I'm coming.

1748
01:35:39,933 --> 01:35:42,301
Smith?

1749
01:35:42,402 --> 01:35:44,137
How doing, Butch?

1750
01:35:45,856 --> 01:35:48,290
Look at you, buddy,
all grown up.

1751
01:35:48,391 --> 01:35:52,161
Wow.

1752
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:56,064
See, uh, you still
got your old bike.

1753
01:35:57,434 --> 01:35:59,046
I see that you
got yours back.

1754
01:35:59,070 --> 01:36:02,871
Yeah, yeah, took a while,
but she came home.

1755
01:36:02,972 --> 01:36:05,424
Cool.

1756
01:36:05,525 --> 01:36:08,637
My father tells me you have
your own service station now?

1757
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:09,144
Yeah.

1758
01:36:09,246 --> 01:36:10,045
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1759
01:36:10,146 --> 01:36:12,248
And, uh, you became, uh,

1760
01:36:12,349 --> 01:36:14,650
that doctor your dad
wanted you to be.

1761
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:16,518
Yeah.

1762
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:20,422
And the brain surgeon who
couldn't save his wife.

1763
01:36:22,058 --> 01:36:25,878
Yeah, I was, uh, sorry to
hear about that, buddy.

1764
01:36:29,048 --> 01:36:31,433
How's Amy?

1765
01:36:31,534 --> 01:36:34,586
You asking, uh,
or you asking?

1766
01:36:34,687 --> 01:36:37,072
Both.

1767
01:36:37,173 --> 01:36:38,173
She's good.

1768
01:36:38,258 --> 01:36:40,092
She's, uh, got a kid.

1769
01:36:40,193 --> 01:36:41,844
Teaching fourth grade.

1770
01:36:41,945 --> 01:36:45,014
Living over at her
grandmother's house.

1771
01:36:45,115 --> 01:36:48,183
And no, she's not married.

1772
01:36:50,537 --> 01:36:53,537
You probably remember how to
get over there, don't you?

1773
01:36:53,561 --> 01:36:56,346
I'm sure I can
