Where The Wild Things Are
timing and subtitle by pee-jay

3
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,730
Hey Claire! Wanna see something great?

4
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,780
Who else was there?

5
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,600
It's an igloo.

6
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,390
- And?
- I made it.

7
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,340
Yeah. My brother.

8
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,580
- Hey Claire!
- I can't.

9
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,270
We're supposed to go tomy dad's
that weekend.

10
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,150
The snowplows left some snow across
the street and I dug a hole into it.

11
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,440
Max, go play with your friends!

12
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,460
You! Go that way!

13
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,060
You! Go that way!

14
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,090
No! Don't talk to me like that!
You're just a fence!

15
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,310
Go play with your
own fence friends!

16
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,900
Now move out!

17
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,090
- Hey, Claire. What's up? You ready?
- Hey, Claire.

18
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,090
Claire, is that your brother?

19
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,210
The kid is dead.

20
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,660
Yeah!

21
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,960
The kid's so dead!

22
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,710
Max! Go away!

23
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,110
- We got him!
- Yeah!

24
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,320
W got him!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

25
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,090
You okay?

26
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,260
Alright now. Let's go!

27
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,090
Hey. I'm home!

28
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,050
Hey. What's wrong?

29
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,670
Claire and her stupid friends
smashed my igloo.

30
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,230
And she didn't do anything about it.

31
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,360
I'm sorry, honey.

32
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,770
I'd have done something about it.

33
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,770
Max, what have you done?

34
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,270
No. I don't want to bother you,
just... just quickly...

35
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,930
Can you tell me exactly,

36
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,880
what Mr. Lasseter didn't like
about the report?

37
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
What am I suppose to do?

38
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,860
No, I'm just tired and I've got
a rough day here and...

39
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,010
I can not afford to lose this.

40
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,990
I know. I know it. I, uh...

41
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,240
but I better get started because
I'd like to turn it in the morning.

42
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,930
No, I hear you. I hear you and this
will be the last time. I promise, okay?

43
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,910
Thanks.

44
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,540
Hey.

45
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,070
Hi.

46
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,860
I could use a story.

47
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,310
Sure.

48
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,590
There were some buildings...

49
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,290
These were these really
tall buildings...

50
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,720
and they could walk.

51
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,560
Then there were some vampires.

52
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,270
One of the vampires bit the tallest
building and his fangs broke off...

53
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,790
then all his other teeth fell out...

54
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,990
then he started crying...

55
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,530
and then all the other vampires...

56
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,420
said Why are you crying?

57
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,880
Aren't those just your baby teeth?

58
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,780
And he said,

59
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,650
No, those are my grown-up teeth...

60
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:01,310
And the vampires knew that
he couldn't be a vampire anymore

61
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,640
so they left him.

62
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,420
The end.

63
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,500
...and the sun is the center
of our solar system.

64
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,900
It's the reason all the planets
are here.

65
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,390
Its warmth gives us sunlight,
makes our planet livable.

66
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,070
Now, of course the sun won't always
be here to keep us warm,

67
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,600
It, like all things, will die...

68
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,240
and when it does, first it'll expand,

69
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,810
enveloping all the surrounding
planets, including Earth,

70
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,960
before consuming them rapidly.

71
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,990
The sun, after all, is just fuel
burning ferociously,

72
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,570
and when it runs out of fuel...
well... it'll be gone.

73
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,730
Well after that, the solar system
will go dark... permanently.

74
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,190
I'm sure by that time,

75
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,910
the human race will have fallen
to any number of calamities...

76
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,230
...war, pollution, global warming,

77
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,909
tsunamis. earthquakes, meteors...

78
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,270
but hey, who knows, right?

79
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,810
Mom? Mom, come up here!

80
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,020
Max, I'm busy!

81
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,910
I rebuilt the fort!

82
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,660
You gotta get inside it,
the lava's coming.

83
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,290
Oh, oh! And it's a rocket ship,
and it's gonna take off!

84
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,770
You want me to
save you a seat?

85
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,910
- You're really... nice.
- ...Cute.

86
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,830
- No.
- You're really.

87
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,270
Hi, sweetie.

88
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,040
Claire, it's almost dinner!

89
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,870
Get your stuff off the table, please.

90
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,420
Hey, shhh.

91
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,580
Mom, what is that?

92
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,980
Pâté.

93
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,480
Frozen corn?
What's wrong with real corn?

94
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,295
Frozen corn is real, alright?

95
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:37,070
And get off the chair, please.

96
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,100
And go tell your sister to clear
her stuff off the table.

97
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,970
CLAIRE GET YOUR STUFF OFF
THE DINING ROOM TABLE!

98
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,960
Max, don't pull that now.

99
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,040
Max, get off the counter, get off.

100
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,380
I have a friend here...
you're embarrassing me.

101
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,240
Woman, feed me!

102
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,810
Max, get off. Get off the counter!

103
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,240
Get off the damn counter MAX! Now. NOW!

104
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,570
- I'll eat you up!
- Get down!

105
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,680
- GRRRAAR!
- Get off!

106
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,240
Stop! Get over here!

107
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,000
What's wrong with you?
This is not the acceptable behaviour!

108
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,330
That is acceptable!

109
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,360
No dinner for you, Max!
Go to your room. Now!

110
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,390
OW! You bit me! That hurt!

111
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,040
Connie, he can't treat you like that.

112
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,580
Max! What is wrong with you?

113
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,740
You're out of control!

114
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,430
Not my fault!

115
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,920
Max!

116
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,820
Max!

117
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,210
Max!

118
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,740
Max!

119
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,360
Noooo!

120
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,030
I hate you!

121
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,410
Hello?

122
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,090
That's it. Tear 'em all down.
Tear 'em down.

123
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,130
Come on! We've got a few more
to go over here.

124
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,360
Is anyone going to help me?

125
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:39,461
We liked them. They were nice.

126
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,990
I mean, this is a problem.
Don't you see this is a problem?

127
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,250
- I will...
- No, I'll just do it myself...

128
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,100
- ...help?
- ...as usual.

129
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,740
Um, Carol, could I talk to you
for a second?

130
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,730
Oh, Douglas, not right now. I'm busy.

131
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,890
Okay.

132
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,380
Can you hear me from up here?

133
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,480
And I'm the only one
who cares enough to do this.

134
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,690
Or this!

135
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,720
Carol, is this really necessary?

136
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,828
Ask K.W. You ask K.W. if it's necessary.

137
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,960
- She's not here. She left.
- I... She left?

138
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,110
She left. Exactly.
That's why, it's necessary.

139
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,010
Um... I will help.

140
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,020
Okay, okay, good. Come on.
Come on. Here ya go.

141
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,480
- Thank you.
- Uhh... glad to help.

142
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,560
Who else wants lend a hand?

143
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,680
What do you think, Judith?
Should I help, too?

144
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,110
No, you shouldn't help him!

145
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,700
I just thought it would
make him feel better.

146
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,610
Good idea, Ira. Go stand in this hut
over here before it gets wrecked.

147
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,520
- I know, I know I shouldn't.
- Ira, you're not helping.

148
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,160
- Go in the hut.
- I'll stand right over here.

149
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,900
- No!
- Ira!

150
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,410
This is crazy!

151
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,140
No, no it was crazy already.
I'm just eliminating the crazy.

152
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,780
I don't think the crazy
has been eliminated.

153
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,430
Isn't anyone gonna be
on my side anymore?

154
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah, well, I guess not.

155
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,130
Fine,

156
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,330
I'll just be on my own side,

157
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,830
by myself.

158
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,730
Nobody cares. I'm the only one that
cares that we don't stay together.

159
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,330
I'm the only one that
cares about that so...

160
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,590
See? I care.

161
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,230
Carol?

162
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,560
You don't care and just stand there
and whisper to each other about me

163
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,750
- like you always do.
- Oh yeah, that's true.

164
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,750
But I know what I'm doing.

165
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,070
- Ira, what is it?
- I don't know.

166
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,180
Hello.

167
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,600
See, this guy gets it.

168
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,770
Hey... um... weird little... ...thing.

169
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,000
I like the way you destroy stuff.
Good technique.

170
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,260
There's a spark to your work
that can't be taught.

171
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,390
Thanks.

172
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,780
Alright, see that one over there?

173
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,410
You get that one, I'll get this one.

174
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,830
- See who can do it faster. Okay?
- Okay.

175
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,810
Go!

176
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,370
Hey, what are you doing?

177
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,630
I... I...

178
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,200
- I'm just helping.
- By smashing our houses?

179
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,400
- These are your houses?
- Yeah.

180
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,200
- What's wrong with them?
- What do your houses look like?

181
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,750
I bet his houses are funny looking.

182
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,900
Look, we worked very hard on these.

183
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,060
Then you, sir, showed up
and started "helping."

184
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,400
- I'm cold.
- Who are you?

185
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,210
Are you one of K.W.'s new friends?

186
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,110
Oh, are you Bob or Terry?

187
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,970
I don't even know who that is?

188
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,630
- He looks like a Bob.
- Things are getting crazy here.

189
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,730
- This thing's dangerous.
- You're scaring me.

190
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,060
You know what I say,
if you've got a problem,

191
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,230
eat it.

192
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,660
- It's the only way to solve these
types of issues. - Yeah. The only way.

193
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,710
Oh, he's probably got
those little bird bones.

194
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,920
I hate bones.

195
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,510
You haven't those little bird bones
that are gonna cut up my mouth, do you?

196
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,550
- No, I don't have bird bones.
- You better not!

197
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,460
You'd better not be difficult to eat!
Did you even think of that?

198
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,100
God, you're selfish!

199
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,520
I hope, you don't taste
as selfish as you look.

200
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,790
- Um... let's eat it!
- Stop!

201
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,720
Stop!

202
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,830
BEEEEEE STIIIIIIILL!

203
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,870
Why?

204
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,040
Because...

205
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,170
Because...

206
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,930
- Why?
- Well because... you can't eat me!

207
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,540
You didn't know that, so I forgive you.
But never try it again.

208
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,750
Why not?

209
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,820
I... I have powers from another land.

210
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,230
Powers...

211
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,910
From ancient times.

212
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,350
Don't make me show you.

213
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,950
I had to show these Vikings once--

214
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,010
Viking? What's a Viking?

215
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,150
They wear horn hats, and they're big--

216
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,910
bigger than all of you!

217
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,870
One time they attacked me
in my ice fortress.

218
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,420
They tried to cave in the roof,
but I'd made it too strong.

219
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,840
I told them to be still,
but they didn't.

220
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,440
I conquered them.

221
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,050
I had to make their heads explode.

222
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:29,300
And then they realized that I knew
all the secrets to the world.

223
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,000
And then you know what happened?

224
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,040
They made me their king.

225
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,110
Wow.

226
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,290
- King?
- You were a king?

227
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,910
I knew, there was something special
about him. I told you, guys.

228
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,190
So wait, you exploded their heads?

229
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,710
Oh come on. Our heads are bigger.
You can't explode big heads!

230
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,680
No, their heads were bigger
than yours, believe me.

231
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,460
But you're so small.

232
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,480
Small is good. My powers are able
to slip right through the cracks.

233
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,960
What if the cracks are closed up?

234
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,139
Then I have a re-cracker that
goes right through that.

235
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:04,620
But what if we have some
sort of material

236
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,090
that re-crackers can't
get through?

237
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,360
Then I have a double re-cracker
which can get through

238
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,930
anything in the whole universe,

239
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,680
and that's the end, and there's nothing
more powerful after that ever. Period.

240
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,480
- Wow, he does sound powerful.
- He's a double re-cracker.

241
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,510
Yeah, yeah, but there has to
be some material somewhere,

242
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,150
maybe really deep underground
that if we  combined it with --

243
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,370
Quiet!

244
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,680
- Something...
- Be quiet!

245
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,960
I'm sorry. So you were their king
and you made everything right?

246
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,050
Yeah.

247
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,440
Well uh, you know...
what about loneliness?

248
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,590
What he's saying is,
will you keep out all the sadness?

249
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,050
I have sadness shield.
It keeps out all the sadness.

250
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,310
It's big enough for all of us.

251
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,140
I just do this to loneliness.

252
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,710
Pooooww.

253
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,930
- Wow.
- I knew it! I knew it!

254
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,980
When he showed up, I saw it.

255
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,190
Why don't you guys
ever listen to me?

256
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,160
You're right, Carol, I didn't see it.

257
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,690
I don't understand.

258
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,820
He doesn't look like a king.
If he could be king, I could be king.

259
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,240
Shhh.

260
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,800
Um, were you the king
where you came from?

261
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,930
Yeah. Yeah, for twenty years.

262
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,300
- That's impressive.
- That's incredible, right?

263
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,880
Looks like we found our king.

264
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,550
- You are our king, right?
- Yeah.

265
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,870
Yeah. I am.

266
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,630
Oh, I'm so relieved.

267
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,050
Sorry, we were gonna eat you.
We didn't know you were a king.

268
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,720
- That was insane.
- Yeah. Yeah. I mean...

269
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,390
- Oh my god! It's K.W.
- What?

270
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,140
- What?
- Oh! Hi, K.W.!

271
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,300
K.W., it's good to see you.

272
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,050
I thought you were with your
new best friends, Bob and Terry.

273
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,000
What are you, guys, doing?

274
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,950
- Who's that?
- K.W. get in here.

275
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,830
You gotta hear this.
We finally got a king.

276
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,590
- That's true!
- A very impressive one.

277
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,190
Hey, K.W. we got a king!

278
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,430
You and me could go for a walk
and I'll tell you all about it. Anytime.

279
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,980
You could carry me like a little baby.

280
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,090
Uh... yeah. Anyway, I don't know
if I'm sticking around.

281
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,840
I just came back to...

282
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,450
...to get that one stick I left here.
Anyone see it?

283
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,650
I'll help find it, K.W.
I'm good at finding sticks.

284
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,340
- K.W., he's very powerful!
- Shh, shh. Stop. Don't push her.

285
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,440
She'll figure it out for herself.
Just leave her be, okay?

286
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,230
King.
King, this way, your majesty, please.

287
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,890
Oh, Look!
He's going to make us happy, Judy.

288
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,820
Yeah,

289
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,930
but happiness isn't always
the best way to be happy.

290
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,480
Judith, stop.

291
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,230
He's small for a king.
Am I nuts? He's small.

292
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,250
Yeah, that's
what I said.

293
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,320
- Alexander, shhh!
- Sorry.

294
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,390
I like it better when we have a king.

295
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,950
I like Carol better when we have a king.

296
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,440
Hey, what happened to our houses?

297
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,240
Oh... um, they fell down.

298
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,510
Are those... other kings?

299
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,290
No, they were here
when we got here.

300
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,990
I never saw them.
Never even noticed them.

301
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,310
You okay?

302
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,860
Yeah.

303
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,630
You are now the king.

304
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,130
And you will be a truly great king.

305
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,170
Oh it looks good on him, look.

306
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,330
He looks great.
Huh king?

307
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,680
- It looks perfect!
- King! King!

308
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,300
- It looks perfect, Carol.
- We have a king.

309
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,340
- Fresh King!
- Fine.

310
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,810
- Oh, I Know this! I know this part!
- "KING! KING! KING! KING!"

311
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,710
Hey King! What's your first
order of business?

312
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,160
Let the wild rumpus start!

313
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,960
- Perfect answer!
- Yeah!

314
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,130
Come on!

315
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,560
Come on, king!

316
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,010
Alright K.W. Get in.

317
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,060
Guys! Follow me!

318
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,660
What?

319
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,100
You're funny looking.

320
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,590
That's all.

321
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,510
Hey, King! King-King! Watch this!

322
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,820
Hey!

323
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,810
Hey! Jumping guy!

324
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,470
Jumping guy!

325
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,650
Hey, Mister!

326
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,760
Wait up!

327
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,450
Hey Jumping guy!

328
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,720
- Hey!
- Hey King, watch this!

329
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,370
Alright tree, we'll settle this later.

330
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,720
Oh look. Everyone wants to
be friends with the new guy.

331
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,460
Well, this is our family.

332
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,820
I hope you can see how excited
they are to have a king.

333
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,340
Sometimes they have an odd way
of showing it, I mean,

334
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,850
they act weird, you know, and...
it hurts other people's feelings.

335
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,580
- Ira, my love.
- What?

336
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,560
- Come here!
- Okay.

337
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,320
Oh, that's Judith and Ira.
They're in love.

338
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,560
What were you thinking?

339
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,050
Watch me! Look!

340
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,300
That's Alexander.

341
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,290
Look! I hate this tree!

342
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,690
Well, he just wants an attention.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

343
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
77...

344
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,770
78...

345
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,250
...no, wait. No, no, that was...

346
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,810
- That's Douglas.
- ...yeah that's it, 78.

347
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,880
I count on him for everything.

348
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,930
If I was stranded on a deserted island
and could only take one thing,

349
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,950
it would be Douglas. We could
share him if you want, King.

350
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,800
Yeah. Sounds good,
I might need one of those.

351
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,320
Douglas, no no no, stop, that's not
the way I want you to do it.

352
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,540
- Oh, sorry.
- Here, I'll show you.

353
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,000
How that happened?

354
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,850
An accident.
I don't know, how that happened.

355
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,040
We haven't formally met. I'm Ira.

356
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,280
I put the holes in the trees;
maybe you saw one of those?

357
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,780
Come here.

358
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,850
Or maybe not. Anyways, it's what I do.

359
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,360
Not really important like things you do.

360
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,840
Oh, and this is Judith.

361
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,720
Ah, he don't really need to know me.
I'm kind of a downer.

362
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,500
King, that's not true.

363
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,750
- Hey, let me see your face. - You could
introduce me to the king if you want.

364
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,510
Let me see your face.

365
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,360
Oooh. What is that?
Don't worry, let me see it.

366
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,580
Oooh, good shot, Douglas!

367
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,367
Almost got me.

368
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,250
Almost got me, Douglas.

369
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,940
We'll get him next time, won't we?
Yes. Yes, we will. We will.

370
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,150
Hey, what are you doing?

371
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,560
Is she the one you were mad at
when you were smashing stuff?

372
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,100
Yeah... No! No, no, um...

373
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,210
I thought she said she wasn't
gonna come back.

374
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,530
Well, it looks like she's back now.

375
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,430
Yeah.

376
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,970
Yeah, I hope so.

377
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,830
I'm gonna get her!

378
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,280
No! No! Don't! Don't! She's doesn't
like that kind of thing. Come back!

379
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,800
- Come back here!
- Ira, my love. Come here!

380
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:29,900
- Hey king!
- Uh, King, I wouldn't recommend that.

381
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,630
Stop it!

382
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,730
Hey stop it!
Go pick someone else's nose!

383
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,950
Max, look out!

384
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,870
Gotcha!

385
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,810
Alexander, get over there and be social.

386
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,350
Let's be like this forever!

387
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,380
- You guys never think this is me,
but this is really me. - Max!

388
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,080
He's starting things off right,
our king.

389
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,820
- Wow, this guy gets things done.
- That was... That was great.

390
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,840
Yeah, that was.

391
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,770
That was fun. We forgot how to have fun.

392
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,440
- That's truth, Carol.
- I mean, I didn't, but...

393
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,030
No. No. You didn't, Carol.

394
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,100
- Hey, K.W., your toe's in my ear.
- Good! You're keeping it warm.

395
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,070
- Hey, who's on my face?
- Oh, I'm sorry Carol.

396
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,610
Let me move.

397
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,920
Oh, I like this.
Let's be like this forever.

398
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,100
The king having a problem?

399
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,560
My foot's stuck under this fat guy.

400
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,580
There.

401
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,320
- Thanks.
- I'm K.W.

402
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,870
- I'm Max.
- I know.

403
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,280
Hey, so are you gonna stay?

404
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,470
- Well...
- They all want you to.

405
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,990
It's complicated.

406
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,970
I don't even know how
everything got this way.

407
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,720
Things seem better now, though.

408
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,420
Yeah. Well, they are.

409
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,460
Okay, king

410
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,170
Who are Bob and Terry?

411
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,800
Oh they're really good friends of mine.

412
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,770
I don't even know
how to describe them,

413
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,030
they're just different
from everybody here.

414
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,510
...It's just different.

415
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,630
- Well, do you like them more than--
- You ask a lot of questions.

416
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,180
What's your story?

417
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,050
Why'd you come here?

418
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,120
Well...

419
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,420
I'm an explorer and I travel a lot.

420
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,910
And I travel by a sea,

421
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,730
- Right.
- I used to travel by air.

422
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,530
Oh, so obviously you have no home
or family?

423
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,510
I had one of those... but I...

424
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,620
- But you ate 'em all.
- No!

425
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,140
No. I just bit one of 'em, that's all, and...

426
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,290
they went crazy.

427
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,890
I don't like frozen corn.

428
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,170
I'm sorry. That's why you left?

429
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,840
They act like I'm a bad person.

430
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,260
- Well, are you?
- I don't know.

431
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,690
I don't know.

432
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,450
Well, I'm glad you came.

433
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,400
It'll be good to have someone around
who doesn't eat everybody.

434
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,470
I mean, you just bite everyone.

435
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,730
Biters aren't so bad, eaters are
the one's I just can't stand.

436
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,930
I have no plans to eat anybody.

437
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,440
Alright. Good.

438
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,790
Good night.

439
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,840
Good night K.W.

440
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,450
Good night.

441
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,100
- Night Ira.
- Night.

442
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,920
Good night Douglas.

443
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,370
Good night Carol.

444
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,730
Good night Judith.

445
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,020
Good night.

446
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,790
Good night, Judy.

447
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,460
Good night, Darling.

448
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,440
Good night Alex.

449
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,170
- Good night, King
- Good night.

450
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,220
- Oh! Good night, King.
- Yeah, good night, King.

451
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,940
Oh, this is nice.

452
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,520
Good night everybody.

453
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,980
Everybody sweet dreams.

454
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,490
I didn't want to wake you up, but I
really want to show you something.

455
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:43,580
Okay.

456
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:47,480
And on the way I can
show you your kingdom.

457
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,220
This is all yours.
You're the owner of this world.

458
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,940
Everything you see is yours.

459
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,590
Oh, except that hole right there--
that's Ira's.

460
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,230
But, I mean the tree's yours,
but the hole is Ira's.

461
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,330
But everything else is yours...

462
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,090
except that rock over there,
that's not yours,

463
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,100
that little rock next to the big rock.

464
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,050
But everything else in the kingdom,
except for that stick,

465
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,150
that little stick right there,
that's not yours...

466
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,160
I want you to be king forever Max.

467
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,480
Yeah. Definitely.

468
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,110
Well, this part of your kingdom
is not so good.

469
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,640
Why?

470
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:34,670
Look. This used to be all rock,
and now it's sand,

471
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,760
And then one day it's gonna be dust.
And then the whole island will be dust.

472
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,760
Then...

473
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,270
And I don't even know
what comes after the dust.

474
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,270
Carol?

475
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,540
Did you know the sun was gonna die?

476
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:54,860
What?

477
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,350
I never heard that.

478
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,410
Oh, come on!

479
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,620
That can't happen.

480
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,690
You're the king. And... look at me.
I'm big!

481
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,900
How can guys like us worry about
a tiny little thing like the sun. Huh?

482
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,860
Carol, what was that?

483
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,640
Oh, it's that dog.

484
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,240
Don't feed it,
it'll just follow you around.

485
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,080
Carol, wait up for me!

486
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,460
Wow.

487
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,230
Did you make this?

488
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,600
Yeah. Yeah.

489
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,380
It's very good.

490
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,650
We were gonna make
a whole world like this.

491
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,550
Now, everyone used to come here,

492
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,060
but you know...

493
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,830
you know what it feels like
when all your teeth are

494
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,080
falling out really slowly and...

495
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,820
you don't realize and then you noticed
that they're really far apart

496
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,750
And then one day...

497
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,830
you don't have any teeth anymore.

498
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,810
Yeah.

499
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,790
Well it was like that.

500
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,630
Alright, put your head right here.

501
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,630
Right here.

502
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,160
And now watch.

503
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,760
Wow. I wish I could live in there.

504
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,370
Yeah.

505
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:27,370
It was gonna be a place where only things
you wanted to have happen would happen.

506
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,720
Yeah.

507
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,180
I guess if that's not going to happen,
I'll just probably end up

508
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,780
eating my feet off.

509
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,320
Carol, we can totally
build a place like that.

510
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,720
- Really? - We're gonna start
with the perfect fort.

511
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,180
And then we're gonna
build the city around it.

512
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,890
Because you've gotta be realistic,

513
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,360
I mean, when we started
with a perfect fort

514
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,440
and then we're gonna build
the underground complex

515
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,710
that's gonna tie everything together.

516
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,510
I like your brain, Max.

517
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,720
Hey! I'm not gonna eat
my feet off anymore.

518
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:07,990
Why?

519
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,410
Max is gonna build a fortress!

520
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,710
Yeah, it's gonna be as tall as
twelve of you and six of me.

521
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,750
And only we can get in.
We can have an ice cream parlor.

522
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,280
A swimming pool with a bottom
that's also a trampoline.

523
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,470
Hey, where were you?
We were just here.

524
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,770
And anyone that gets in there
that we don't want there

525
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,690
will get their brains cut out.
The building will do it automatically.

526
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,480
How does it know which brains
to cut out?

527
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:31,430
Okay, there will be a fake tree
but it's not a tree, it's a tunnel.

528
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,490
So anyways, it's not a tree,
it's a tunnel,

529
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,650
and it'll lead you into the fort
through a compartment.

530
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,310
Ira, do you want to be in charge of the
tunnels because you make great holes?

531
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,670
- Wow. Wow.
- I don't want my brains cut out!

532
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,860
- This fort's already making me happy.
- Does anybody ever hear me?

533
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:58,210
We'll take care of each other, and
we'll all sleep together in a real pile.

534
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:02,090
- What do you think? - I don't think
anything like this ever works, really.

535
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,730
But if it did.... I don't know,
I don't know. I don't know anything.

536
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,610
But I do like sleeping in a real pile.

537
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,220
Carol, will you be in charge
of building it?

538
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,320
Oh. Uh...

539
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,510
You should definitely
be in charge, Carol.

540
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,890
You're the only one
who could pull it off.

541
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,390
Yeah, well... You're right, but...

542
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,680
K.W., don't you think that
Carol should build it?

543
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,740
Yeah. He's the only one who can.

544
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,820
I build it, if he doesn't want to.

545
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,980
Well...

546
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,090
Really want to do this?

547
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,260
- Oh, yes.
- I think it's a perfect idea.

548
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:36,040
Well, alright if you all want to do it,
and you want me,

549
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,010
I'll be honored.

550
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,370
- Judy, you would have
been good too. - Yeah.

551
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,090
A little more that way. A little more.
Yeah right there.

552
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,220
Yeah!

553
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,710
- How about here? You like it here?
- Yeah. Put a mark there.

554
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,790
One more put there and then we can
put the other mark over there.

555
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,920
Yeah. A little more this way.

556
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,720
It's five, Carol.

557
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:35,630
And then seven Douglases across
we'll have the other mark.

558
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,340
- What have you been eating?
- Rocks.

559
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,220
Rocks? What did I tell you
about eating rocks?

560
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,370
- That's six.
- You're getting a little paunch.

561
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,410
Hey Douglas.

562
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,570
- Hey, K.W..
- Hey, King.

563
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,710
How about here?

564
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,660
It needs seven Douglas's,
no more, and no less.

565
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,450
- Seven chubby Douglases.
- Hey, Carol.

566
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,990
It's gonna be part castle, part fort,
part mountain, and part ship.

567
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,750
We'll have a laboratory so we can
build robots to do stuff for us,

568
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,000
our own detective agency,
and our own language.

569
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:09,960
And we'll make a machine that can take
our legs off and that way we can float.

570
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,180
Alright, Carol!

571
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,710
You smiled.

572
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,540
You can't deny that was a good idea.

573
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,040
I didn't deny it.

574
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,870
I believe part of that idea was mine.

575
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:26,450
What part?

576
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,250
The part where I said,
"Yeah. Good idea."

577
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,140
I got it! I got it.

578
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,840
I like the tunnel, Ira. Impressive!

579
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,140
Oh! Why thank you, King.

580
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,850
Great beams, Douglas. Strong.

581
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,850
Thanks. They're just the standard beams
I always do.

582
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,540
What were you doing with Carol just now?

583
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,190
Just talking.

584
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,390
Oh, a secret, huh?

585
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:25,200
Well let me ask you something.
How does it work around here?

586
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,030
Are we all the same,
or are some of us better than others?

587
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,790
You like to play favorites, huh, King?

588
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,590
Ow.

589
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,580
No. I like all you guys equally.

590
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,400
Don't give me that!
I can see how it is!

591
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,880
The King has a favorites,
that's really cute.

592
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,380
Ow. Stop.

593
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:44,200
Do you have a favorite color?
Hey, can I be your favorite color?

594
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,230
You know what?

595
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,570
You can't do that back to me.

596
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,050
If we're upset, your job is
not to get upset back at us.

597
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,060
Our job is to be upset.

598
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:17,140
If I get mad and want to eat you,
then you have to say,

599
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:22,620
"Oh, okay! You can eat me! I love you!
Whatever makes you happy, Judith."

600
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,410
That's what you're supposed to do.

601
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,250
Come on, Max.
Let's go get those sticks.

602
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,210
Yeah... okay.

603
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,530
I hope you heard me, King.

604
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:35,590
Ow.

605
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,890
Yeah, he heard you, Judith.
Everyone always hears you.

606
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,790
You think you have power, K.W.?
That's not real power.

607
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,740
I'm talking to you!

608
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,630
No. Not you.
Still talking to K.W.!

609
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,110
Don't worry about Judith.
She's a downer.

610
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,767
Now you figure it out.

611
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,040
Hey, you should talk to
Bob and Terry about it.

612
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,600
Come on!

613
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,680
King!

614
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,380
Seriously, they're really smart.

615
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,950
They have the answers to everything.

616
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,270
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming!

617
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,400
Well, what do you think?

618
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,690
This is Bob and Terry.

619
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,780
They love it, when I do this to them.

620
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,810
Bob, Terry, this is the Max,

621
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,810
he's the biter I was telling you about.

622
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:00,880
Say hi.

623
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,520
Hi.

624
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,360
He wanted to ask you guys some advice.

625
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,220
Go ahead, they're not judgmental.

626
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,620
You mean just ask them?

627
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,110
Yeah.

628
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:21,940
They say it's better for you, if you
can ask the question in seven words.

629
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:26,210
Um... Okay... Um...

630
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,850
How.

631
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,500
Do.

632
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:40,520
I. Make.

633
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,440
Everyone.

634
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,560
O. Kay.

635
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,700
Oh, yeah. I didn't think of that.

636
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:59,890
Wow, they really get to the heart
of it, don't they?

637
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,440
Aren't they great?

638
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,310
What if they came
and lived with us?

639
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,310
Bob, Terry, why don't you
come live with us?

640
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,510
We're building something great!

641
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,000
Oh good! Right Max?

642
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,160
What about Carol?

643
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,170
He's Carol.

644
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,790
I can like him and still be friends
with Bob and Terry.

645
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,580
Hey, Douglas!

646
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,100
Hey! Where's Carol?

647
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:53,750
He's in the fort.
Aft section, main chamber.

648
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,320
Carol! Carol! The fort looks great!

649
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,520
Yeah, thanks, we were all
working really hard on it.

650
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,550
Where have you been?

651
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,720
K.W. took me to see her friends
Bob and Terry.

652
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:17,920
They really wanna meet you.
They may even stay over.

653
00:56:23,878 --> 00:56:26,328
Oh, this is the famous Bob and Terry?

654
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,850
What? K.W. told you about me?

655
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,950
- Hey, guys.
- What'd she say?

656
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,300
- Really? - Oh, precious!
Little Bob and Terry get carried!

657
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,700
Excuse me. My voice?
Oh, thank you!

658
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,170
Thank you. Well, sometimes...

659
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,190
I know. I know.
I'm a very lucky man.

660
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,690
Hey. Hey, do you guys know any jokes?

661
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,660
Who's there?

662
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,980
Loud interrupting cow wh--

663
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,250
That's hilarious!

664
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,880
They're amazing, K.W.

665
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:07,130
Max, what's wrong with the fort?

666
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,890
I though you said it'd be automatic.

667
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,840
What?

668
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,920
I thought you said if anybody
got in here we didn't want,

669
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:16,460
the fort would automatically
cut their brains out.

670
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,460
Carol?

671
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,480
Oh, well...

672
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,740
I thought that then, but...

673
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,770
I kinda decided that if we know them,
they should keep their brains.

674
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,380
Even if we don't know them that well...

675
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,200
I think you should apologize
to Bob and Terry.

676
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,410
I don't apologize to owls.
Owls are stupid.

677
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:45,350
Carol, that's hateful.

678
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,270
Why did you bring them here?

679
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,930
This place was supposed to be for us!

680
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,920
They're not sleeping in our pile!

681
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,730
Gee, you're the best king ever.

682
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,950
You've changed everything.

683
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,350
Hey Carol.

684
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,810
I don't get why she likes them so much.

685
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,170
And I couldn't even understand,
what they were saying,

686
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,270
all I heard was squeaking.

687
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,270
I couldn't really understand
what they were saying either.

688
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,060
- Really?
- Yeah.

689
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:59,170
Everybody's mad at me.

690
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,340
Is there anything you can do to...

691
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,270
you know...

692
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,370
There's something I like to do,
that sometimes makes me feel better.

693
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,490
What is it?

694
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:26,440
Okay. We're gonna have a war! And we
are gonna completely clobber each other!

695
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:30,680
- Clobber each other?
- Yeah, with huge dirt clods.

696
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:33,630
I used to do it a ton
when I was a little kid.

697
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,860
Yeah, we haven't had a dirt clod fight
in a long time...

698
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,890
Yeah. It's the best way
to have a fun together.

699
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,210
Yeah. Life was simpler back then,
with the dirt clods.

700
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,840
- Yeah.
- So, who wants to be a bad guy?

701
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,060
Okay. I'll pick one then.

702
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:55,530
- Okay you're a bad guy.
- Yeah, saw that coming.

703
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,390
...And then you're definitely a bad guy.

704
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,980
- What? Ah... Damn.
- And you can pick one other.

705
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,970
Ummm... I'm bad... really.

706
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,730
- Okay. We pick you.
- No.

707
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,080
No, I can't be a bad guy.
I'm the king. I'm a good guy.

708
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,920
I'm a bad guy! I'm a bad guy!

709
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,870
- Okay. You can be a bad guy.
- I'm a bad guy!

710
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,020
- Judy, I'm with you.
- Yeah. I heard.

711
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:15,470
And you... uh...

712
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,190
- He's with you.
- And am I a good guy?

713
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,770
Yes, of course, you have the best arm.

714
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,620
Hey, where were you?

715
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:27,330
I'm just making sure, Bob and Terry
still have their brains.

716
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,430
- K.W.!
- They do.

717
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,920
Hey K.W.! You wanna be on my team?
With the bad guys..

718
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:35,970
No! No-no, no. You're with us.
You're a good guy.

719
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,850
Hey, come on.
K.W., be a good guy.

720
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:44,630
Okay. So, you're on my team.
You and me and Carol.

721
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,110
Hi, K.W.

722
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:53,250
So what we are gonna do is we're
gonna try to kill the bad guys...

723
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,410
by beaning them in the head
with these dirt clods.

724
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,260
We're gonna try to find
the biggest pieces...

725
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,200
- You didn't see that coming!
- Get out!

726
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,080
- Rumpus!
- Yeah. You'd better run!

727
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:08,730
Oh, Wait! We didn't make
the official starting noise!

728
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,330
Alright, come on!

729
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,120
Look out for the bad guys!

730
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,970
We got them pinned down!
They can't even move!

731
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,840
- Fire on three!
- Okay!

732
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:36,110
One, two, three!

733
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,340
You guys are gonna...

734
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,580
Wait-wait-wait-wait!
I have an idea!

735
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,400
Come out!

736
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,070
No!

737
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,190
Why not?

738
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:59,490
Ahh, because you're gonna hit us
in the head with dirt.

739
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,770
Come out!

740
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:04,680
Nooo!

741
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,500
Why not?

742
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,500
Because when I said you were gonna
hit us in the head with dirt,

743
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:09,860
you didn't say anything.

744
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:13,410
That means you're planning to hit us
in the head with dirt.

745
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,960
Man, they really have us figured out.

746
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,260
Yeah.

747
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,150
Okay! Let's go!

748
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,830
Charge!

749
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:26,380
C'mon!

750
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,485
Ira! Get Carol.

751
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,870
Ooh, good shot. I'm gonna get you!

752
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:49,180
Hey, who threw Richard?
He's on our team now.

753
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,690
- Gotcha!
- No animals!

754
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,520
Owww! It really hurts. It's hurting!

755
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,730
Yeah! Come on!

756
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,990
- Hey, Douglas. Get the goat.
- Okay.

757
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,290
- Knock his legs down.
- I got it.

758
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,450
Owww!

759
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,890
That's cheating.
I'm not gonna play anymore.

760
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:19,390
- Alexander come on! Fight with us!
- Do it again. - Okay.

761
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,630
That's... That's not fair.

762
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,330
- Are you crazy?! - Alexander you
are supposed to get hit, it's a war.

763
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,680
That wasn't fair. Douglas hit me,
when I was hurt.

764
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,810
You can't hit someone,
when they're hurt.

765
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,850
- I quit.
- Get back in here right now.

766
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,505
Alex! Count to ten.

767
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:34,990
- Things will be better.
- Alex, better don't you cry!

768
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,080
If I count to ten then
you'll be gone Ira?

769
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:40,170
- Don't you dare talk to Ira
the way I do! - Knock it off!

770
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,940
Owww! That's my eye!

771
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,510
Hey! Come on!

772
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,800
Get out! Now!

773
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,420
Yeah!

774
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,990
Oh! Carol, sorry.

775
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:09,770
What happened? Somebody stepped
on your head?

776
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,010
What are you doing?

777
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:13,400
What?

778
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,250
You stepped on my head!

779
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,500
What do you mean? It's a war.
Douglas just did it.

780
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:21,870
Yeah but he did by accident.
You did it on purpose!

781
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,040
And he didn't step on
the face part of my head!

782
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,075
It was a joke.

783
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,260
I was just joking.

784
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,780
Sure you were.

785
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:35,910
Like you aren't always looking for
an opportunity to step on my head.

786
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,870
'Cause that's what you do.

787
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,520
Fine, fine. You know what?

788
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:47,440
This is exactly why I never don't want
to do anything with you anymore.

789
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,720
Go ahead.

790
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:51,110
Step on my head.

791
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:54,050
No. Forget it. I'm not going
to step on your head

792
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,150
just to make you feel better.

793
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:01,220
Let's go, Douglas.

794
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,870
Carol, I think you did the right thing,

795
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,370
you know, not stepping on her head.

796
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:30,780
Thanks, Max. But I'm done.

797
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,940
I don't know, why I came back here.

798
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,070
I'm glad I met you, I guess.

799
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,420
So King. What's going on?

800
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:56,410
This is how you rule a kingdom?
Everyone fighting?

801
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,700
The bad guys feel bad.
Hell. Everyone feels bad.

802
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,970
Yeah. I'm still sorta dizzy
and my eyeballs feel loose.

803
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,850
Oh can it, Ira.
Everyone's eyeballs feel loose.

804
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,720
No!

805
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:15,200
Max will bring K.W. back.
He'll keep us all together.

806
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,410
He has powers. He told us.

807
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:20,300
Right, Max?

808
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,290
Show us.

809
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:52,390
Oh, somebody broke the king.

810
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,650
I don't get it.

811
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,780
Oh wait, I do. It's stupid.

812
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,010
I think he's done now.

813
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:05,890
That's what we waited for?

814
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,110
Carol?

815
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,180
Hi.

816
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,060
Is that from the dirt clods?

817
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,440
Yeah,

818
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,980
it's from when you had Douglas hit me.

819
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,370
I'm sorry about that.

820
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,130
It's okay.

821
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,540
No one really listens to you, huh?

822
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,820
Oh, you've noticed.

823
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:15,670
Yeah. I guess you're not...
used to that being a king and all.

824
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,480
I really messed this place up.

825
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:35,780
You're not really a king, huh?

826
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:39,890
You're just regular.

827
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,050
I knew it.

828
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,780
I don't even know
if there's such a thing as...

829
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:54,110
a king who can do all the things
you said.

830
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,520
Look,

831
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:59,560
I don't care,

832
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,670
just don't ever let Carol find out.

833
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:53,830
Hey, Max.

834
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,500
What's that?

835
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:59,570
Well, I was thinking we needed a place

836
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,880
where the king is secret.

837
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:05,550
Like a secret chamber for the king.

838
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,430
Well, I don't understand... What...

839
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:11,550
Well, you know like a...
like a small place.

840
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,760
With a door that's not so big.

841
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,910
I don't know...

842
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,630
I didn't picture it with
a secret doors.

843
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:27,350
What if it were a big place
with big secret doors.

844
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,140
That's not really how it would be done.

845
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,300
It's more like... it's like a...

846
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:43,940
About that big?

847
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,260
Everybody get out here!

848
01:12:58,820 --> 01:12:59,890
Wake up.

849
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,540
Everybody wake up!

850
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:05,150
And get out of here!

851
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,790
- Ira, what is that?
- Everybody wake up!

852
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,120
It's Carol.

853
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:13,010
Oh, I knew it was gonna happen.

854
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:16,720
It's all wrong. It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

855
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,150
Judith, what's happening right now?

856
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,170
Judith?

857
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:21,870
Wake up and come out here.

858
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,020
What is it?

859
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,320
Get out here!

860
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:26,440
It's wrong!

861
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:28,830
- I can't even look at it.
- What is it?

862
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,150
The fort. We gotta tear the fort down.

863
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,030
What?

864
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,380
- It wasn't supposed to be like this.
- No, Carol!

865
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:37,350
You said we were all going to
sleep together in a real pile,

866
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,770
and now you want a secret room
and K.W. is gone for good

867
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,780
And now I have to worry
if the sun is gonna die.

868
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:44,540
- The sun?
- Look at it. It didn't come up!

869
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:46,150
- It's dead.
- What?

870
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:47,420
- Oh my God!
- Dead!

871
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:49,420
- Carol, stop it!
- It's dead! It's dead.

872
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,700
- You're scaring everybody.
- It's morning.

873
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,660
The sun's not dead. It's just nighttime.

874
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:56,510
How do you know?
I can't trust, what you say.

875
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:58,790
Everything keeps changing.

876
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,200
Oh, come on, Douglas.
We're ripping it down.

877
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:02,170
Carol, we're not ripping the fort down!

878
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,150
It was supposed to be a place
where only things you wanted

879
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,990
to have happen would happen.

880
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,580
Come on Douglas, do what I tell you.

881
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:10,340
No! We all live here, not just you.

882
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:14,550
It's everybody's.
It's Judith, and Ira, and everybody.

883
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,670
Oh, finally!

884
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,170
You were supposed
to keep us safe.

885
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,030
You were supposed to take
care of us, and you didn't.

886
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,530
- Carol.
- I'm sorry!

887
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,580
- That's not good enough.
- Carol.

888
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,190
You're a terrible King!

889
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,750
- Carol!
- What?

890
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,660
He's not our King.

891
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:29,560
What?

892
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,410
Don't say that.

893
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,450
How could you say that?
Don't you dare say that.

894
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,720
There's no such thing as a king.

895
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,600
Don't you say that!

896
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:42,180
He's just a boy pretending to be
a wolf pretending to be a king.

897
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:44,490
- That's not true!
- He's just like us.

898
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,420
- Ahh! Why don't I listen to myself?
- No! No!

899
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:47,630
That's not true!

900
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:51,190
Look, I just went along with it because
I knew you wanted it so much.

901
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,420
- Don't say that!
- No! Carol, stop it!

902
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:54,930
- Carol.
- Oww!!

903
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:56,650
Stop it!
What are you doing?

904
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,720
- Carol!
- What?

905
01:14:57,770 --> 01:15:01,530
- That was my favorite arm.
- Well, I was just holding on to it.

906
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:02,730
- You pulled away.
- What?

907
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:04,624
- Carol, stop it!
- You lied!

908
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:07,020
- You're out of control!
- I am not out of control!

909
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:09,830
You were supposed to take
care of us. You promised.

910
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,420
I'll eat you up!

911
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,480
Come back, Max!

912
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,770
Max!

913
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:38,400
Max!

914
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:44,480
C'mon. C'mere.

915
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,430
Get in, get inside!

916
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,190
Get in. Crawl inside my mouth.
I'll hide you!

917
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,070
- Hi, Richard.
- Max.

918
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,530
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

919
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:16,750
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

920
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,200
I can smell him!

921
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:21,800
I just want to talk to him.

922
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:24,550
- You're out of control!
- I'm not out of control!

923
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,500
- You were going to eat him!
- No, no... I wa--

924
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,990
I wasn't going to...
I do not know... I just said it.

925
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:39,170
Am I as bad as he says I am?

926
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,930
Just go away.

927
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:46,560
I just wanted us all to be together...

928
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,260
Can you believe him?

929
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,550
He doesn't mean to be that way,  K.W.

930
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,780
He's just scared.

931
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,880
Well, he only makes it harder.

932
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,930
And it's hard enough already.

933
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,050
But he loves you.

934
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,780
You're his family.

935
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:43,640
Yeah.

936
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:46,980
It's hard being a family.

937
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:57,730
I can't breathe that well in here.

938
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,650
Can you get me out?

939
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:38,730
I wish you guys had a mom.

940
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,790
I'm gonna go home.

941
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:14,010
Carol!

942
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:24,470
Max.

943
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,680
Well... Umm... Yeah.

944
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:38,750
Yeah.

945
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:53,180
So whatever happened with you
and the Vikings?

946
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:59,090
Well, in the end, I had to leave.

947
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:00,980
Why?

948
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,150
I'm not a Viking or a king or...

949
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,340
anything.

950
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,700
So what are you?

951
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,240
I'm Max.

952
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:31,220
Well, that's not very much, is it?

953
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,820
Hey Max?

954
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:08,660
Yeah?

955
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,990
When you go home will you say
good things about us?

956
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,830
Yeah, I will.

957
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:23,020
Thanks, Max.

958
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,410
You're the first king
we haven't eaten.

959
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,110
Yeah, that's true.

960
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,550
See ya.

961
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,570
Bye, Max.

962
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,020
Bye.

963
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:58,680
Don't go.

964
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:01,720
I'll eat you up, I love you so.
