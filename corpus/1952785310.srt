what I'm doing, Margaret.

363
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:39,268

for a boy without a father.

00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:18,303
Duncan: No! Let her go!

536
00:23:18,337 --> 00:23:20,639
You'll crush her!

537
00:23:20,673 --> 00:23:23,408
[Grunts]

538
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,443
Belloc: [Laughs evilly]

539
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:27,746
Duncan: I said let her go!

540
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:35,454
Isabel: Duncan.

541
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:44,629
Duncan: Aah!

542
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:54,239
Belloc: [Snarling]

543
00:23:54,273 --> 00:23:56,408
Duncan: Let me go!

544
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:09,387
[Footsteps pounding]

545
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:13,892
Belloc: [Snarling]

546
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:17,529
Duncan: Where are you taking me?

547
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:22,200
Belloc: [Roars]

548
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:24,603
[Laughs]

549
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:25,937
Excellent.

550
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:26,905
Duncan: Huh?

551
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:30,208
Belloc: Duncan...
Let me look at you.

552
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:33,145
Duncan: Why don't you just
kill me and get it over with?

553
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,548
Belloc: If I wanted to
kill you, you'd be dead.

554
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:49,528
[Inhales deeply]

555
00:25:05,978 --> 00:25:07,946
Duncan: [Gasps lightly]

556
00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:26,264
Belloc: We are an ancient race, Duncan,
so old we became myths to the humans.

557
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:34,039
They call us invaders, when it is
they who have infested our world.

558
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,850
Duncan: Where are we?

559
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:48,920
Belloc: Home, Duncan,
your true home.

560
00:25:48,955 --> 00:25:50,222
Duncan: No way.

561
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:51,556
This isn't my home.

562
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:55,026
That doesn't change just
because my father's a Kaiju!

563
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:57,429
Belloc: I am not <i>a</i> Kaiju.

564
00:25:57,463 --> 00:26:00,498
I am Belloc, <i>king</i> of the Kaiju!

565
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:05,237
Though you are my
son, you are weak.

566
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:08,006
Duncan: [Breathing heavily]

567
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,207
Unh!

568
00:26:09,242 --> 00:26:11,109
I'm strong enough!

569
00:26:11,143 --> 00:26:12,177
Belloc: No.

570
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:15,046
The human world has
made your heart soft.

571
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:22,087
You must be hard and remorseless
if you are to rule over the Kaiju.

572
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:22,721
Listen.

573
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:23,955
They're assembling.

574
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,523
They've caught our scent.

575
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:26,224
Come.

576
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:29,928
Duncan: [Grunts]

577
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:35,302
Belloc: There is a war coming, Duncan,
between Human and Kaiju,

578
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,335
a war that could end

579
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:38,403
everything.

580
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:41,072
It is a terrible burden to bear.

581
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:44,843
But for the good of all,
you have no choice.

582
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:47,612
Duncan: You think I'm going to
be king of these creatures?

583
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,115
I am not a monster!

584
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:52,217
Belloc: You are my son!

585
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:56,688
You are half-Kaiju, Duncan, superior
to everyone you have ever known.

586
00:26:56,722 --> 00:26:59,424
Duncan: That's why
you brought me here?

587
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:03,161
You ignore me for 16 years, and
and you expect to train me for

588
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:06,031
something that I
don't even want?!

589
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:08,033
[Gasps]

590
00:27:14,573 --> 00:27:18,209

593
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:35,927
Belloc: I'm your king.

594
00:27:35,961 --> 00:27:38,229
This is my son.

595
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:40,465
You desecrate our race!

596
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:42,467
You shame our ceremony!

597
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:46,638
Bad enough you keep us from
exterminating the human vermin.

598
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:48,840
Now you <i>mate</i> with them.

599
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:51,443
Belloc: Who challenges
their king?!

600
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:52,944
You, abaddon?

601
00:27:52,978 --> 00:27:54,646
Or you, astaroth?

[Hisses]

603
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,317
Belloc: I thought as much.

604
00:27:59,352 --> 00:28:01,853
Then I make my choice.

605
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:04,823
This is Duncan, my heir!

606
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:05,490
Duncan: Huh?

607
00:28:05,524 --> 00:28:09,527
W-what happens now?

608
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,528
Ugh!

609
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,298
Aaaaaaaah!

[Bird crying]

620
00:29:00,446 --> 00:29:01,746
What?

Duncan: Ken, it's me.

628
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:54,632
Ken: Duncan?

629
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,800
Duncan: Wait up.

630
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:59,070
Before you open the door,
you need to know... I look weird.

631
00:29:59,104 --> 00:30:00,071
Ken: Yeah, I know.

632
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:02,006
Duncan: No, I mean
weirder than before.

633
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,842
Compared to this, I
used to look great.

634
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:08,012
So brace yourself.

635
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:10,081
Ken: Okay.

636
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:11,115
You want a soda?

Duncan: So, you're
not freaked out?

638
00:30:13,452 --> 00:30:14,586
Ken: Not really.

639
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,054
Belloc's all over the tv.

640
00:30:16,088 --> 00:30:19,224
Our Kaiju alert level is red,
which is like the highest.

641
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:22,961
Compared to that, you're
just not that shocking, man.

642
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,631
Besides, when Isabel told me
your old man was Belloc...

643
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:27,065
Duncan: She told you?

644
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:28,633
Ken: She tells me everything.

645
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:29,968
We're best friends.

646
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:33,705
It's like we have some kind of
deep, mysterious connection.

647
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:35,173
Duncan: Uh, yeah.

648
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:36,407
You can totally tell.

649
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:38,910
Ken: So, your dad's
king of all monsters.

650
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:39,377
Cool.

651
00:30:39,411 --> 00:30:40,845
Duncan: No, not cool.

652
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,714
First of all, he did this to me.

653
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:44,015
That's why I came here.

654
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,618
My mom is going to seizure
when she sees this.

655
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:49,287
Ken: It's not that bad, bro.

656
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:52,323
So, your mom...
she's human, right?

657
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:53,057
Duncan: Huh?

Ken: Cool.

660
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,163
Duncan: Yeah, so, not only is my dad, you
know, a monster, but he's psychotic.

661
00:30:59,198 --> 00:31:00,198
I'm not big enough.

662
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:01,332
I'm not tough enough.

663
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:04,736
I'm a total disappointment to him
unless I do everything his way.

664
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,304
He... [Fly buzzing]

665
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:09,741
Y-your dad...
he's on a trip or something, right?

666
00:31:09,775 --> 00:31:11,109
Ken: Yeah, pretty much.

667
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:12,977
Duncan: When does he get back?

668
00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:14,746
Ken: Yeah.

669
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,247
That's a good question.

670
00:31:16,282 --> 00:31:18,182
We're friends, right?

671
00:31:18,217 --> 00:31:22,854
I mean, you can keep a secret?

672
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:24,889
I think my old man is
a spy or something.

673
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,857
Duncan: Mm-hmm.

674
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:28,760
Ken: He can't talk about it,
obviously, but the pieces fit.

675
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:33,331
He's always vanishing for months at a time,
then reappearing without explanation.

676
00:31:33,365 --> 00:31:34,232
Duncan: Hmm.

677
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:35,400
That could explain it.

678
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:37,302
Ken: You can't
tell anyone, okay?

679
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:38,937
Duncan: Consider
your secret kept.

680
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:42,640
And if you could refrain from
mentioning that it was my dad

681
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:48,346
who crashed the party last
night, that would be great.

682
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,049
Ken: What were you doing
at that party anyway, bro?

683
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,483
Duncan: Isabel invited me.

684
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:54,018
Ken: Isabel invited you?

685
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:56,988
Duncan: No, no, she just
told me about the party.

686
00:31:57,022 --> 00:31:59,223
Ken: But Isabel was
there, at the party?

687
00:31:59,258 --> 00:32:00,425
Duncan: Yeah.

00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,630
Yes, this is Ken Rogers.

691
00:32:05,664 --> 00:32:09,634
Who is this?

692
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:10,535
Margaret: Duncan?

693
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:14,038
Duncan: [Sighs] Hi, mom.

00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:14,772
[Dog barking]

695
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,742
Barnes: Half of megtaf is scouring
the desert for him, Margaret.

696
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:19,844
If Belloc's out there,
we'll find him.

697
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:23,014
Margaret: Colonel Barnes, maybe
you should send out <i>all</i> of

698
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:27,885
megtaf, since half of it is having
difficulty finding a 120-foot giant.

699
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,253
Barnes: But mar...
[Receiver slams]

Margaret: Ugh!

701
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:31,122
Duncan: Easy, mom.

702
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:34,559
It's not Barnes' fault
Belloc is back.

703
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:35,960
Margaret: [Sighs]

704
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:42,900
Well, it's certainly not your fault, and
it's.. Duncan, are you blaming me for this?

705
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:47,839
Duncan, everything I've done,
every choice I've made... coming

706
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:52,010
here, the deal, megtaf...
it's all been to protect you.

Duncan: Well, it
didn't do much good.

708
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:57,215
Nothing can stop the biggest
monster in the world.

709
00:32:57,249 --> 00:33:01,252
Margaret: Your father is a great many
things, but he is not a monster.

710
00:33:01,286 --> 00:33:06,124
You don't know the things he's been
through, the good things he's done.

711
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:10,495
I don't expect you to
understand, but I did love him.

01:03:55,928 --> 01:03:58,196
<i>Aaaah!</i>

1247
01:04:19,886 --> 01:04:24,489
<i>[Both grunting and gasping]</i>

1248
01:04:24,524 --> 01:04:27,359
<i>[Rumbling]</i>

1249
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,867
<i>>> Duncan: Mom!</i>

1250
01:04:59,031 --> 01:05:01,966
Belloc: [Growls]

1251
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,367
You did not kill them.

1252
01:05:03,402 --> 01:05:05,202
Duncan: I wanted to.

1253
01:05:05,237 --> 01:05:07,271
But it wouldn't have
changed anything.

1254
01:05:07,305 --> 01:05:09,373
Margaret: It would have
changed <i>you.</i>

1255
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:11,742
<i>>> Belloc: But you</i>
<i>did</i> beat them.

1256
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:14,245
I wouldn't have
thought it possible.

1257
01:05:14,279 --> 01:05:17,815
Perhaps there <i>was</i> value
in leaving you with your mother.

1258
01:05:22,087 --> 01:05:25,389
Duncan: You don't have to
go back there to that cage.

1259
01:05:25,424 --> 01:05:26,690
I'll free you.

1260
01:05:26,725 --> 01:05:29,693
Belloc: You will stay with your
mother for the time being.

1261
01:05:29,728 --> 01:05:32,696
And I... Will be nearby.

1262
01:05:32,731 --> 01:05:34,398
[Engine turns over]

1263
01:05:55,253 --> 01:05:57,154
Barnes: Holy hello, kid.

1264
01:05:57,189 --> 01:05:58,222
What did you do to 'em?

1265
01:05:58,256 --> 01:05:59,156
Duncan: Nothing.

1266
01:05:59,191 --> 01:06:00,157
They're cold-blooded.

1267
01:06:00,192 --> 01:06:01,125
They're hibernating.

1268
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:02,860
Barnes: What about you?

1269
01:06:02,894 --> 01:06:07,465
Duncan: I'm not like them.

1270
01:06:07,499 --> 01:06:10,601
Barnes: What are you geniuses
waiting for, a written invitation?

1271
01:06:10,635 --> 01:06:12,837
Let's get these popsicles
in the freezer.

1272
01:06:12,871 --> 01:06:13,838
Jenna: Hi.

1273
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:14,939
Duncan: Hey.

1274
01:06:14,973 --> 01:06:17,208
Jenna: So, I figured out who.

1275
01:06:17,242 --> 01:06:19,844
Thanks for saving homecoming.

1276
01:06:19,878 --> 01:06:20,778
[Scoffs]

1277
01:06:20,812 --> 01:06:23,447
Like any of that
stuff matters now.

1278
01:06:23,482 --> 01:06:25,349
Duncan: It mattered to you.

1279
01:06:25,383 --> 01:06:28,819
Jenna: So, I'll see
you at school Monday?

1280
01:06:28,854 --> 01:06:29,920
Duncan: I don't know.

1281
01:06:29,955 --> 01:06:31,522
You still want me
to go to school?

1282
01:06:31,556 --> 01:06:32,623
Margaret: Oh, yeah.

1283
01:06:32,657 --> 01:06:33,791
You're going to school.

1284
01:06:33,825 --> 01:06:36,760
Duncan: Then I'll see you there.

1285
01:06:40,832 --> 01:06:44,034
Margaret: Looks like our
Duncan: You know what, mom?

1286
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:48,405
I think I'll find
my own way home.

1287
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:52,209
[Grunting]

1288
01:06:52,244 --> 01:06:53,611
[Laughs]

1289
01:06:53,645 --> 01:06:54,912
Whoo!
