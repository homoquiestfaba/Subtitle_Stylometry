00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:17,389
(woman panting softly)

2
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:27,599
You know why you don't have a daddy?

3
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:30,701
'Cause Daddy couldn't love you.

4
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:36,972
He couldn't love
an ungrateful little maggot like you.

5
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:39,952
I only have you here

6
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:42,682
to collect some money
every now and again.

7
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:46,619
You're disgusting.

8
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,787
You're filthy

9
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,797
and disgusting.

10
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:56,631
But you're Mommy's little boy.

11
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,739

CYRUS: MIND OF A SERIAL KILLER

28
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:05,104
Woman: If you could ask anything
to the person who took your mother,

29
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,106
Mr. Adams, what would it be?

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,938
Adams: Maybe... why?

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,840
Why indeed.

32
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:19,841
And that is exactly the question
we will try to answer

33
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:22,684
on this episode of "Last Steps."

34
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,383
Man: Wow, that's powerful.

35
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:28,019
I should have thought of it myself.
It's good. It's gold.

36
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:32,293
It's like Emmy gold. If we cut
into it with the nursery rhyme thing,

37
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:36,166
and then we bookend it
with a little speculation

38
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:38,899
and some conjecture-- oooh!

39
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:41,601
God, goodbye cable. Hello prime time.

40
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:43,666
- Yeah.
- All right, let's get this thing.

41
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,076
Oh wait. Light's not right.
We should wait till the sun moves.

42
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:47,909
We can't. We've got a live one.

43
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,644
Some guy called and said we have
to meet him at his house at 10:00.

44
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:52,208
- A townie?
- Yep. Let's go.

45
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:54,550
All right.

46
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:57,614
I'm standing in front
of the Featherbone Bar.

47
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:59,682
This is the last known place

48
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:03,218
that Vicky Alvarez,
Tina Holt and Chloe Esveign

49
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:07,029
were last seen on that fateful
spring night over five years ago.

50
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:12,300
Their disappearance and that of
over 200 other Easter State students

51
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:16,298
still remains one of the most perplexing
mysteries of our time.

52
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:20,109
Some say they fell victim
to the fabled Highway Hunter,

53
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:23,206
others that they simply
vanished into thin air,

54
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,310
into what some locals call
the tri-county triangle

55
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:29,083
due to their unexplained disappearance.

56
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:33,286
Police investigations have just led
to more unanswered questions.

57
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:35,726
Join us as we try to uncover

58
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:39,198
what happened to these three girls
and so many others

59
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:41,530
on "Last Steps."

60
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:43,934
Cameraman: And we're good.

61
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,904
So who do we got?

62
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,567
Um, I... some local--

63
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,237
claims he knows what really happened,
doesn't want us disparaging the town--

64
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,270
didn't want me to run
the story, actually.

65
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:56,305
- A nutcase?
- Probably. At least he's talking,

66
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,977
which is more than some
of the other locals are willing to do.

67
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,715
Before we can discuss
what a serial killer does,

68
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:04,246
we need to discuss
what a serial killer is.

69
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,488
Some people would try to categorize
them in the same group

70
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:10,758
as mass murderers,
but this would be incorrect.

71
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:13,322
While both serial killers
and mass murderers

72
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:15,300
may kill a large number of people...

73
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:18,099
The reason they kill and the period
of time over which they kill

74
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:19,730
is completely different.

75
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:22,606
Reporter: Where are these killers
typically found?

76
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:25,338
Albert: Anywhere that there is
a large enough population

77
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:28,973
to support prostitutes,
the kind of people that won't be

78
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:30,710
noticed if they go missing.

79
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,480
However serial killers can and have
also operated

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,215
very successfully in rural areas.

81
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:37,155
Make sure you get everything, okay?

82
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,590
- What about the release?
- We'll get it afterwards.

83
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:41,651
Work with me, Tom, okay?

84
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:44,854
(doorbell rings)

85
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,332
No one home.

86
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:50,495
He said 10:00.

87
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,070
Man: Yeah, come in.

88
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:59,203
Hi, it's Maria Sanchez
with "Last Steps."

89
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,736
I know who you are.

90
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,341
I have my cameraman with me.

91
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:06,682
I'm in here.

92
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:09,321
- Turn it on.
- Okay, hold on.

93
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:12,254
Now hold the damn door.

94
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:14,192
- Sorry sorry.
- (door creaks)

95
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:23,229
You're early.

96
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,737
Um, sorry, sir.

97
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,498
(clock chiming 10:00)

98
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:38,539
So you want to know about Cyrus.

99
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:41,679
- Cyrus?
- Cyrus Danser.

100
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,782
The Highway Hunter,

101
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:47,588
the County Line Cannibal--
whatever you want to call it.

102
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:51,660
He was a good man.

103
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:54,531
Did his best with what God gave him.

104
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:59,469
Just liked his privacy.
Guess that's why people talk.

105
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:05,368
And?

106
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:09,041
And that's it. I've said my piece.

107
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:12,212
Let the dead lie.

108
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:15,619
All those people are gone,
Cyrus is gone.

109
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:18,123
So your story's just gonna open wounds

110
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:20,683
that have been long healed
and best left unopened...

111
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:24,430
hurting people that
don't need hurting no more.

112
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:25,795
- Mr.--
- Emmett.

113
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:28,460
Emmett, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to seem rude,

114
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:31,664
but the state police
and the local police and the FBI

115
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:34,731
have all been trying to figure out
what happened to "those people"

116
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:38,608
and you just blurt out that some guy
named Cyrus Danser killed them?

117
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:40,135
All?

118
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,240
I'm sorry, I find that
a little incredible.

119
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,046
I guess that's your right, ain't it?

120
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:48,111
I've seen your show.
I find that a lot incredible.

121
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:50,349
- Mmm.
- Huh.

122
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,053
But that don't change what I said.
That don't change the truth.

123
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:56,358
Does it?

124
00:06:56,396 --> 00:07:00,025
So I'd appreciate it if you'd turn
that camera off right now. Right now.

125
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:02,626
Okay. Why us?

126
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,864
Why not go to the authorities?

127
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:08,271
No need. He's gone.
All those people are gone.

128
00:07:08,308 --> 00:07:10,868
Nothing gained.
But you-- you run that show,

129
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,538
we're gonna have people coming
from all over into this town

130
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,980
like maggots on meat.
This is a small town.

131
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:19,178
And small-town people like
to keep to themselves.

132
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:21,710
- Mmm.
- So I reckon there's no need

133
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:25,122
for you to keep digging and bothering
people-- or even run that show.

134
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:26,921
"Is there? Is there? Is there?"

135
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,157
We don't run the show to bother people.
We run the show to inform the public

136
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:32,528
and to give the victims' families
a little bit of closure.

137
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:34,556
- Oh, closure?
- Yes, closure.

138
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:37,035
One of the victims, Vicky--

139
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,368
- Alvarez.
- Thank you, Vicky Alvarez?

140
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:41,635
She was a pretty girl.
Had sparkling green eyes.

141
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:45,201
It is terrible what he did to her.

142
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:48,339
- I remember.
- Remember?

143
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:51,612
Yeah, I remember them all.

144
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:55,815
Vicky Alvarez, Santa Fe, New Mexico.

145
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,918
You know Jan Bletcher?

146
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,427
Shreveport, Louisiana.

147
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:06,023
And Tiffany Beano? Davenport, lowa.

148
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,260
- How?
- Pictures.

149
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:13,500
Driver's license, school IDs--
I kept 'em.

150
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:38,828
Yeah, I look at each one
every Sunday after church.

151
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,663
Just not right that people
forget you were here.

152
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:47,604
You want closure, there's closure.

153
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,098
If they're in that box, they're gone.

154
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:54,113
Oh my God, there's like--

155
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:57,480
there's like 100 IDs in here.

156
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:01,385
You take those and you talk
to their families. Let 'em know.

157
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:04,822
- But no story.
- I won't mention the town's name,

158
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:08,624
- but I'm sorry, I can't kill the story.
- I am not bargaining with you, miss.

159
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,224
Now I'd appreciate it if you'd leave.

160
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:17,136
I would really-- I would really
like to finish that interview.

161
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:22,530
Look, Emmett, the story's gonna
get done with or without your help.

162
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:26,272
Okay, if you want to spare your town,
I can help you with that.

163
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,746
If you want to tell Cyrus's
side of the story,

164
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:30,578
I can also help you with that.

165
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:33,415
But if you don't want to talk then
I'm gonna let the entire world know

166
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:38,220
that some sick fuck named Cyrus Danser,
world's largest serial killer,

167
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:40,351
lived right here in Arkham Heights, USA,

168
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,657
and the whole town knew about it
and didn't say anything

169
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:45,357
because they didn't want company.

170
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:48,993
You sure are a fast talker, ain't you?
You don't know shit about Cyrus

171
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,299
or what he went through or this town.

172
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:53,703
Look, if my side of the story
is inaccurate, it's because

173
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,198
nobody in this town will talk to me.
If there's a side of Cyrus's story

174
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:59,438
that I'm missing, you being
one of his friends,

175
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,845
I think that he would want you
to talk to me about it.

176
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:04,975
Don't you think Cyrus would want that?

177
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:07,851
I think I know what Cyrus would want.

178
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:12,347
I'll tell you the truth--
the whole truth.

179
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:13,882
But no camera.

180
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:17,124
It's television. I need footage.

181
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:19,063
Emmett: I don't want you
using any of it.

182
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:20,895
I don't want it going out
into the world.

183
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,368
It's none of their damn business.

184
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:26,236
- And no mention of the town.
- Absolutely.

185
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:29,799
Agreed. But just let him,
you know, record it for audio,

186
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:32,140
just for reference so I don't
get anything wrong.

187
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:36,478
- I think you owe that to Cyrus.
- I reckon I know what I owe Cyrus.

188
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:41,687
- What's your name?
- I'm Tom.

189
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:44,588
Why don't we take a breath of air?

190
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:47,787
Okay. I'll just be outside.

191
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:58,532
Are you nuts negotiating with that guy?
We should call the cops.

192
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:01,131
- After the interview.
- What if there is no interview?

193
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:03,608
What if he just walks out that door
with a shotgun and shoots us?

194
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,407
He's not going to, okay?
He's not a killer.

195
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:08,641
Oh yeah, he's just best friends
with a guy

196
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:10,444
that makes John Gacy
look like a sweetheart.

197
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,383
You didn't turn the camera
off in there, did you?

198
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:14,249
- No.
- Thank God.

199
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,187
Why did you say
we wouldn't use any footage?

200
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:18,713
Because it worked.
And once it's in the can--

201
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:21,226
Oh yes, in the can. And if he sues?

202
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,889
Oh my God-- Jethro? What's he gonna
give the lawyer as a retainer?

203
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:27,525
A can of motor oil? Hurry up, get this.

204
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:31,230
This is Maria Sanchez.
It's been five years

205
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,671
since the mysterious disappearances
on highway 213 in Arkham Heights

206
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:38,074
have stopped. It's also been
five years since Cyrus Danser,

207
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,602
the man thought responsible
for those disappearances,

208
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:42,443
himself disappeared.

209
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:44,643
A coincidence? No.

210
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:48,017
We at "Last Steps" are about
to bring you an exclusive interview

211
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,454
with a man who could not only
answer those questions,

212
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,721
but can prove that his answers are true.

213
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,094
Stay tuned for our exclusive interview
with the best friend

214
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:00,793
of the County Line Cannibal.

215
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,630
I thought you said he was
the Highway Hunter.

216
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:04,329
I did, but I liked his answer better.

217
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,930
- Cut it.
- You all ready?

218
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,998
Yeah yeah. Grab it.

219
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,602
Are you sure you want
to know all of this?

220
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:13,669
I mean, it's not a very
pleasant story, miss.

221
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:16,614
And in the end, I don't think
you're gonna like it.

222
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:19,083
Why don't you just let me worry
about that, okay?

223
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:20,983
All I need from you is the truth.

224
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,988
- That I got plenty of.
- Good.

225
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,650
But you're not gonna use
any of the footage.

226
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,091
No. No, I swear.

227
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:31,392
- On what?
- On my life.

228
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:33,160
Come on.

229
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,134
Fair enough.

230
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,467
- (beeps)
- The worst part

231
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:40,802
is just not knowing.

232
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,636
I mean, how do they know without a body?

233
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,379
Sometimes when I hear
the phone ring I rush to it.

234
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,613
I hope

235
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:56,554
and pray that it might be her.

236
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,525
It never is.

237
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,028
- (beeps)
- Folks around here can't remember

238
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:05,826
exactly when the Dansers
moved into that old house.

239
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,995
But the older folks speculate,

240
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:13,563
it was back before the interstate
ran past our little town.

241
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:18,035
But who can remember back that far?

242
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:20,568
And why would they want to?

243
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:36,126
All right.

244
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:38,562
(woman laughs)
We're here, aren't we, baby?

245
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:40,122
- Just take a step.
- Okay.

246
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:47,569
Here we go, ready? It's okay.

247
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,576
We're almost there.
Just a few more steps.

248
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:54,239
That's all right.
Watch your step, all right?

249
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,771
- You ready?
- Ready.

250
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:02,213
(chuckles)

251
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:06,123
A farm? You bought a farm?

252
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,684
Not a farm, our farm.

253
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:11,219
It's our home-- 100+ acres.

254
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:15,394
100 acres?! How'd you pay for this?

255
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:18,062
My veterans' benefit package
from when I was a POW.

256
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,038
- Your benefits?
- They paid me for all the time

257
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:22,836
- I spent in that camp.
- Baby, that was supposed to be

258
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,400
our starting-out money
to move to the city!

259
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:28,470
You spent it on this?

260
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,379
This! On this?!

261
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,748
- Sugar, this is our future.
- Our future?

262
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:36,118
Do you even know how hard it is
to run a place like this?

263
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:37,747
- I can learn.
- Learn?

264
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,782
The closest you've come
to making a living on a farm

265
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:43,090
is having supper at my daddy's.

266
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,893
Do you even know how to plow a field?

267
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:48,560
Sugar, you grew up on a farm,
you can show me.

268
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:53,265
The only thing I'm gonna show you
is the couch, Cyrus Danser.

269
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:57,242
I didn't marry you so I could move
from my daddy's farm

270
00:14:57,276 --> 00:15:00,541
to another one. All those nights

271
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,608
I spent worried about you
in that prison camp,

272
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:10,020
not eating 'cause I was
worried half to death,

273
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:13,492
all the nights sitting at home

274
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:15,426
crying and for what?

275
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:16,621
(screams)

276
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:20,723
So you could spend
all our money on a farm?

277
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:25,962
That was my money too, Cyrus.

278
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,372
I earned it waiting for you.

279
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:49,959
Go on, unpack!

280
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:55,523
She did many things wrong, but she
was definitely right about that farm.

281
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,461
I'm going into town.
Do you want anything from the store?

282
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:02,667
No.

283
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,506
Good. 'Cause we can't afford it.

284
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:10,180
People felt sorry for old Cyrus.

285
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:13,708
See, he didn't have any skills
to speak of.

286
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:16,620
Couldn't tend his crops, fix an engine

287
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:19,625
or even milk a cow.

288
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:23,095
But one thing he could do
which earned him the respect

289
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:25,029
and, dare I say it,

290
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,658
the fear of every man in town

291
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,535
was hunt.

292
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:33,197
And that there fear worked for Cyrus.

293
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:36,470
See, his wife wasn't exactly
what you'd call a modest type.

294
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:38,500
You should be ashamed of yourself.

295
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,545
I'm a married woman.

296
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,105
What makes you think
I want to have a drink with you?

297
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,948
I just thought you might be thirsty.

298
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:49,113
Well, I have a cola.

299
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:51,680
That's not exactly
the type of drink I had in mind.

300
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:54,124
(laughs)

301
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,025
Simon?

302
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:58,360
Hey, Cyrus, we were just talking.

303
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:01,093
- Talking?
- Just talking.

304
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:04,934
You done-- talking?

305
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:09,235
- Yes sir.
- Then you should go.

306
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:12,806
Yes sir.

307
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:19,718
We all kind of felt sorry for Cyrus.

308
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:22,220
So we got real happy when he bought

309
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:24,484
that small plot of land
down the road from him.

310
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:27,390
Off of 213A.

311
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:29,758
Everyone got real happy.

312
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:33,231
I figure I could put a gas pump
out back for cars off the interstate;

313
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:35,825
Sell fresh game.
I'm pretty fair with a gun.

314
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:38,063
Most of those folks
they never tasted fresh game before.

315
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:40,902
You might want to throw a grill
in there too, give them cooked food.

316
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,340
People on the go
like that sort of thing.

317
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:46,470
It seemed to make sense
for all the people in the town

318
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:49,310
and they all wanted
to lend a helping hand.

319
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:52,078
I thought things might start
looking up for Cyrus

320
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:54,518
until the day the stand
was supposed to open.

321
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:57,249
Oh boy.

322
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,521
- (rock music playing)
- Emmett: It was a horrible thing.

323
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,825
See, his missus,
she was a fine-looking thing

324
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:08,322
in her early 20s with a glint
of city living in her eyes.

325
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:12,133
They say his name was Tom or Bob

326
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:14,230
or one of them really short names.

327
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:19,636
He had that glint of big-city living
in his eyes too.

328
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:23,375
Folks think he was tall
and blond and blue-eyed,

329
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:27,716
but they don't really care.
Why should they?

330
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:31,951
She didn't fit in.
Oh, she tried hard enough at first,

331
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:34,960
but it just never really took.

332
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:38,225
Some people are made for a simple
country life and some aren't.

333
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:40,892
She wasn't.

334
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:45,666
So it didn't take anyone by surprise
when she up and left with the child.

335
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,246
(moaning)

336
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:11,919
(screaming)

337
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:26,068
No, stop!

338
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,794
(choking)

339
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:20,355
(distorted baby fussing)

340
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,568
Hungry, ain't you?

341
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:42,945
No one left

342
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:45,382
to feed you anymore.

343
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:55,993
But Daddy won't let you go hungry.

344
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:59,789
No.

345
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,264
I won't let you know that pain.

346
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:09,806
I won't let you know
the pain this world's got.

347
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:14,779
- (baby crying)
- I won't.

348
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:23,345
(bones crunch)

349
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:29,255
Are you telling me that he killed
his wife, her lover and his child?

350
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:32,058
You don't listen very good,
do you, miss?

351
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:35,260
I didn't say anything about killing
no wife or child or lover.

352
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,634
All I'm saying is a salesman came off
that long stretch of freeway right there

353
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:42,402
with a shiny new gas grill

354
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:44,409
and left with a wife and a boy.

355
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:48,174
At least that's what they say around
here and that's all they say.

356
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:50,875
People didn't think it was strange
that his wife just left?

357
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,613
No one was shocked.
All the ladies knew she would leave him,

358
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:58,214
maybe even before she did.
They would just stare at her

359
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:01,226
and say, "Look at the way she dresses.

360
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,990
Look at the way she acts.

361
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,463
Just look at her," they would say.

362
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:09,558
I guess people have a way
of putting two and two together.

363
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:13,002
Maybelle who owns a little
dress shop down on Main Street,

364
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,040
she was the first to notice.

365
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,564
Maybelle: Roadkill?

366
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:19,805
Cyrus, no one is gonna eat
nothing called roadkill.

367
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:21,210
Try it.

368
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:24,113
I will not eat anything
you scraped up off a highway.

369
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:26,481
It's just blended scraps
leftover from the butcher.

370
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:30,414
It's a sin to waste meat.

371
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:33,118
Not some skunk you hit on the way over?

372
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:35,888
Nothing I didn't kill
with my own two hands.

373
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:45,033
Mmm, mmm.

374
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,267
Oh my, this is the best hamburger
I ever had.

375
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:50,298
- Mmm.
- (crunches)

376
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:52,776
Mmm, oh.

377
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:55,780
Just a small little bone.

378
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:58,408
- Let me try.
- No, you get your own.

379
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,748
Mr. Danser gave this one to me.

380
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:02,481
Order me one more.

381
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,455
Emmett: And despite her protest

382
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,459
she had to admit he was right.
Everyone did.

383
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:10,826
The whole town must have
passed through that stand that day.

384
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:14,799
Everyone asked the same question,
heard the same answer

385
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,801
and had the same reaction:

386
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:19,326
it was the best damn burger ever.

387
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:22,807
And so no one ever asked about it again.

388
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:24,638
Why would they?

389
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:29,272
Sometimes towards sundown
just before Cyrus was closing up shop

390
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:32,750
and Maybelle was finishing up
her third roadkill burger,

391
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:34,446
she asked another question.

392
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:36,647
Can you believe
she hasn't been here all day?

393
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:39,555
Did you see what she wore
to church the other day?

394
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:41,525
- Shameful!
- And the way she flirts.

395
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,393
- I know.
- And the way she treats poor Cyrus.

396
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:47,125
- Shameful.
- White trash, pure and simple.

397
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,232
It is late.

398
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:53,102
I would have expected you
and the missus could have come up

399
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:55,470
with a better name
for your patty burger, Cyrus.

400
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:57,304
But then again I would have expected

401
00:24:57,342 --> 00:25:00,140
your wife to be here to help you
on your opening day.

402
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,511
- (whispers) Shameful.
- The missus is gone.

403
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:05,210
- Gone with that salesman.
- But--

404
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,218
Gone!

405
00:25:08,253 --> 00:25:09,845
The young'un too.

406
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:15,587
They left a note.

407
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:17,492
Emmett: That was all he said.

408
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:20,692
Tanny looked at Maybelle,
they both looked at Cyrus,

409
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:25,226
and they saw in his eyes a hurt
and a shame and a loss

410
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,932
and a man who just didn't
want to talk about it.

411
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:31,704
And so they didn't.
And no one ever asked about it again.

412
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:34,041
- Why would they?
- (door opens, closes)

413
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:12,075
- (beeps)
- Well, the typical serial killer

414
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:15,086
is white, male,

415
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,213
late 20s to 30s.

416
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:21,556
He kills his victims by use
of extreme and personal violence--

417
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:24,528
beating, stabbing, strangulation.

418
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:28,021
Would probably deny any
responsibility for his crimes.

419
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:32,002
However psychosis or
mental illness is very rarely present.

420
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:34,870
These people are usually
very intelligent.

421
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:38,741
Doctors believe that serial killers
lack the voice of conscience

422
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:41,644
which keeps most of us
from doing things we should not.

423
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,446
And he uses this to escape
detection and hide his identity.

424
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:48,783
In background,
in personality, in appearance,

425
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,813
he can be extremely, extraordinarily

426
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:54,951
ordinary.

427
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:57,757
And that is probably the key

428
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:01,562
to his extraordinary talent for murder.

429
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,398
After all, who would suspect him?

430
00:27:04,436 --> 00:27:08,304
Whatever happened that day
between that man and his wife

431
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,207
took a terrible toll on him.

432
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:14,007
I knew it. I saw it.

433
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:17,504
Over the next 20 years or so,
I saw that man change

434
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,677
in ways God never intended
a man to change.

435
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:25,247
See, time didn't do nothing
to heal old Cyrus's wounds.

436
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,283
I guess it didn't want to.
So Cyrus, he took to healing his own

437
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:32,889
the best way he knew how--
hunting and tracking.

438
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,730
He could take a buck at 150 yards
downwind with a single shot.

439
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:43,263
He'd sit crouched in a field
for 10 hours-- more sometimes--

440
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:46,402
with that gun perched on his shoulder
looking down that scope,

441
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:49,937
silent as a needle
falling through water.

442
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:53,247
And tracking--
there wasn't a creature God made

443
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:55,515
that knew the land
better than old Cyrus.

444
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:57,522
- (sobbing)
- He could sneak up on a deer

445
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:59,490
and touch him on the nose.

446
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:00,957
The deer wouldn't know what hit him.

447
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:02,153
(gunshot)

448
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:05,721
But no matter what that man did,
there was no healing the pain.

449
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:10,334
You could see it in his eyes.

450
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:13,861
They just went silent like
a bad garage-sale painting;

451
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:16,999
flat-- they didn't say a thing.

452
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:20,569
They didn't want to. And Cyrus?

453
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:23,604
Well, he was about as quiet as his eyes.

454
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:27,751
Oh, he would talk to take
an order or tell you a price,

455
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:29,617
but mostly he'd just grunt at people.

456
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:32,384
If he liked you or you were
from the town, he'd add in a nod.

457
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:34,085
That was pretty much it.

458
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:36,356
Those college kids
when they'd come down there,

459
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:38,955
he wouldn't talk to them at the stand.

460
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:42,524
They'd drive 92 miles just to say
they had roadkill for dinner.

461
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:45,502
City folks, they're strange.

462
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:48,404
Um, speaking of college kids,

463
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,705
you said to me earlier on
that Vicky Alvarez,

464
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:54,268
that what he did to her was terrible.

465
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:57,907
Um, what do you mean by terrible?

466
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:01,112
Emmett: It seems Tina and Vicky had
taken the other one out drinking

467
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:04,384
to help her get through catching her
boyfriend cheating on her.

468
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:06,288
That was a bad idea.

469
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:09,020
- (rock music playing)
- (cheering)

470
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:12,825

Yes, you do.

479
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:42,021
You taste like tequila.

480
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,925
Who knew she had it in her?

481
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:46,692
I guess she isn't taking
this whole Luke thing very well.

482
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:49,165
Yeah, I know.

483
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,570
(ringing)

484
00:30:00,545 --> 00:30:01,978
Ooh!

485
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:06,316
- Okay, time to get her out of here now!
- Why?

486
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:08,376
Because she's starting to act like you.

487
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,413
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- Uh, she's acting like a tramp.

488
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:15,187
- Thanks!
- Well, let's face it.

489
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:17,889
I'm the smart one,
she's the sweet one and you're--

490
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:19,794
Yes?

491
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,822
The reason we get free drinks.

492
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:24,925
No thank you, I'm driving.

493
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,335
Eh.

494
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:32,436
- Did he call?
- About 20 times.

495
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:34,911
Good. I don't feel well.

496
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:37,437
It's okay, hon. We'll get the check.

497
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:39,143
- Did he call?
- Yes!

498
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:41,414
Good. (sniffles)

499
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,718
- Oh, I don't feel good.
- It's okay. We're leaving.

500
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:45,848
- Here.
- (moans)

501
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:48,758
- Hey, where are you girls going?
- Back to school.

502
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:51,626
No, we're gonna get roadkill. Come on.

503
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:53,927
- Maybe we could join you?
- (laughs)

504
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:56,934
- Uh, no.
- Your friend hit on me.

505
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:59,368
She's drunk and stupid. Now do you mind?

506
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:00,894
We just want to play.

507
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:06,140
Oh, you want to play, lover?

508
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:08,043
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You like it rough?

509
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,603
Yeah sure.

510
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,308
Good.

511
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:19,551
(groans) God damn it.

512
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,321
Emmett: The liquor didn't help at all.

513
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:28,526
Just made her bounce back and forth
between mad, bad and sad.

514
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:32,094
- (sobbing)
- Like a bass flipping around on a hook

515
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:33,968
before you net it.

516
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:35,996
No, I don't want to hear it.

517
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,374
Okay, just-- study partner my ass!

518
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:46,245
No, I will not come over.

519
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,678
No, we're-- we're at the roadkill
and if you want to talk

520
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:54,055
you can drive
your cheating ass out here.

521
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:56,822
- (phone clicks)
- He's coming.

522
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:58,563
Great.

523
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:09,834
(car doors slam)

524
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:11,899
What the fuck?!

525
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,309
Hey, mister, is this place closed?

526
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:16,712
Hey, mister, I'm talking to you.

527
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:19,683
What, are you deaf and dumb?
I asked if this place was closed.

528
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:22,846
Okay, bad idea. We should go.

529
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:28,854
Sorry about that.

530
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:32,021
It's just that we drove
all the way here from the college

531
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:35,362
and I just wish you could open it up
for just three little burgers.

532
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:43,434
Fine, you old redneck.

533
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:46,410
Who wants to be stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere anyhow?

534
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:49,538
Go ahead, get in your piece of junk
and get the hell out of here.

535
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:07,158
And you'd better leave
before I kick your ass.

536
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:09,496
(giggling)

537
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:18,538
Tina: You're kidding me, right?

538
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:20,737
No, he's on his way.

539
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,441
Oh great. That's just great.

540
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:26,473
So what are we supposed to do
until he shows up?

541
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:30,954
Ah! All right.

542
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:34,425
- Lay off it.
- I could totally use a drink right now.

543
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:40,162
- Tina?
- Ha. No.

544
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:42,291
- I'm driving.
- Oh, that's all right.

545
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,859
- It means more for us.
- (screams)

546
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:47,633
- You want to play, bitch? Let's play.
- Oh my God.

547
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:50,197
- Oh my God, get us out of here.
- (glass shatters)

548
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:52,266
- Hurry up.
- (engine starts)

549
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,801
Go, hurry up!

550
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:57,644
- Okay okay okay.
- Go!

551
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:07,019
- Do you see them?
- No.

552
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:08,787
- Should we go back?
- Hell no!

553
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:11,159
There's gotta be an on-ramp
up here somewhere.

554
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:12,823
- (smashes)
- (screams)

555
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,798
- Whoo!
- (laughing)

556
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,961
- Get 'em, boy!
- You like it rough, bitch?

557
00:34:18,002 --> 00:34:20,800
- Stop.
- Hit 'em again.

558
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:26,037
- (screams)
- Vicky: You have to drive faster.

559
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:27,305
Deer!

560
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:35,411
(girl panting)

561
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:46,156
♪ You better watch when
the sun goes down... ♪

562
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:48,188
- Oh God.
- (dialing)

563
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:55,197
Oh shit.

564
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,732
Fucking pick up, Luke.

565
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:01,940
- (dialing)
- (siren blaring)

566
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:10,343
The mass murderer,
while he does kill many people

567
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:13,824
in one attack, when that attack is over

568
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:15,826
his mission is complete.

569
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,124
Serial killers represent
a different and,

570
00:35:18,163 --> 00:35:20,961
in my opinion, a much more
dangerous threat to society.

571
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:24,901
While they may not kill as large
a number of people in one attack,

572
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:28,030
they will kill for a number of years

573
00:35:28,072 --> 00:35:30,302
as long as they remain undetected.

574
00:35:30,341 --> 00:35:33,572
Emmett: The next day was
pretty much a normal one for old Cyrus:

575
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:37,012
wake up, open the stand, sell food.

576
00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:39,710
Pretty much normal.

577
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:44,211
Except the holiday weekend coming up
put a big dent in his supplies.

578
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:47,588
He needed to do
a bit of hunting to keep up.

579
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,820
People from all over the tri-county

580
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:52,659
wanted roadkill
for their family barbecue.

581
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:55,165
It tasted good,

582
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,465
kept you young and he sold it
at a right fair price.

583
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:02,736
So all in all it was turning out
to be a pretty good day

584
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:05,242
for Cyrus and the stand.

585
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:09,746
That is until that boy showed up
with the sheriff.

586
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:15,446
Can you spare a moment, Cyrus?

587
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:18,047
It looks like you've had a busy day.

588
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:20,319
That reminds me-- I promised the wife

589
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:22,849
I'd pick up a few pounds
of sausage for the holiday.

590
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:29,862
Anyhow, this boy's lady-friend
went missing last night

591
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:33,359
with her roommates.
Caught him plowing someone else's field.

592
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,131
I wouldn't bother you except she was
supposed to meet him here last night

593
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:40,144
and never showed up.

594
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:43,270
Recognize them?

595
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:54,350
- No.
- Well then,

596
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:57,020
we'll be getting out of your hair.

597
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:59,552
- That's it?
- Son,

598
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:01,462
I got two squads to cover

599
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:04,093
the third largest county in the state,

600
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:06,695
which doesn't give me the luxury
to drop everything I'm doing

601
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:08,501
to look for your girlfriend who ran off

602
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,474
because you got caught
with your pants down.

603
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:12,499
So you're not even gonna look for her?

604
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:14,409
We did look.

605
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:18,074
She's probably back at school with them
friends. If I was you, I'd look there.

606
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:20,141
But she called from somewhere near here.

607
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:23,051
Then maybe you should start
looking somewhere near here.

608
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:25,078
But I ain't got time.

609
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:30,260
Well, thanks a lot, Sheriff.
(whispers) Redneck.

610
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,195
I don't believe I heard you.

611
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,165
Thank you, sir.

612
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,030
Git.

613
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:43,707
Can I get that sausage from you, Cyrus?

614
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:49,136
Emmett: Now Luke had put
Cyrus in a terrible mood

615
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,842
and that was a bad thing
for anybody to do.

616
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:55,341
See, infidelity just didn't
sit right with Cyrus...

617
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:58,321
- No, not a thing.
- ...given his history.

618
00:37:58,356 --> 00:38:00,692
No, I'm gonna stay here
and look for her.

619
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,391
(buzzing)

620
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:21,010
(whimpering) Tina?

621
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,173
Tina?

622
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:33,248
Tina, wake up.

623
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,816
Tina, please wake up.

624
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:56,637
Emmett: So when he got home that night

625
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,672
he was in a particularly bad mood.

626
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:03,554
And those two boys from the bar
were going to catch hell 'cause of it.

627
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:07,687
See, there just wasn't enough space.

628
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:11,491
Two cars crashing at the same time,
well, it just never happened before.

629
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:15,759
He just hadn't planned for it.

630
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,430
So he put those boys out in the barn
and the girls in the basement.

631
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:24,908
It just didn't seem right,
them sharing a room in his house,

632
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:28,036
none of them being married and all.

633
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,915
(gasps)

634
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:34,645
(grunting)

635
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:38,721
Oh! What the fuck?

636
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:40,951
Don't cuss.

637
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:46,785
Oh yeah? Well, who the fuck are you

638
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:48,765
and why the fuck am I chained?

639
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:52,498
Jesus Christ!

640
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:55,472
Oh, sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean that.

641
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:59,641
But, God, you killed him.

642
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:01,838
What were you boys doing
with those girls?

643
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:03,346
Nothing. Chasing them.

644
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:05,144
We were just playing-- for fun.

645
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:07,344
Emmett: That was a
real bad thing to say.

646
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:09,410
See, you can say
what you want about old Cyrus,

647
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:11,149
but chasing girls for fun,

648
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:14,590
- that was just plain rude.
- It was all his idea, please.

649
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,389
- Please don't kill me.
- Shh.

650
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:20,090
Emmett: And Cyrus hated rude.

651
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:23,157
- I can go?
- To those trees.

652
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,965
- And then?
- And then I'm coming after you.

653
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:30,303
The town's five miles north from there.
You make it there, you're free to go.

654
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,468
And if I don't?

655
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:36,638
- I kill you.
- Why?

656
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:39,548
For fun.

657
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:41,814
- What?
- Git.

658
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:47,317
Emmett: Now normally Cyrus would
have killed him right then and there

659
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:49,155
and that would have been that.

660
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:52,856
But that there chasing-for-fun thing...

661
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:55,866
now that was the worst thing
he could have said.

662
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:02,897
Please, mister, I don't want to die.

663
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,669
Run.

664
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:10,970
Emmett: There were only two things
that were for certain that night:

665
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:12,983
that boy was gonna die

666
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:16,009
and he was gonna die
a wiser and politer man.

667
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:19,921
So when he thought he had made
his point, he ended it--

668
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:22,084
- quick.
- (knife swooshes)

669
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:24,060
He wasn't trying to be mean about it,

670
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:27,030
but he felt he owed it to the boy
and those three girls.

671
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:29,362
- (thuds)
- And that was that.

672
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,200
The use of fantasy is very common
among serial killers.

673
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:37,105
Often this fantasy has occurred
well in advance of any crime.

674
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:40,770
However for the serial killer,
fantasy becomes a compulsion.

675
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:42,837
And the subsequent behavior

676
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,849
keeps true to the original
flavor of the fantasy.

677
00:41:45,883 --> 00:41:48,852
The fantasy becomes the motive

678
00:41:48,886 --> 00:41:52,879
and establishes
the offender's signature.

679
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:56,621
It's been rehearsed in the killer's mind

680
00:41:56,661 --> 00:42:00,153
and the roles have been cast.

681
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:03,656
He's only waiting for a victim
to fill that final role.

682
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:05,692
Sometimes the victim will even be called

683
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,897
by a name that is important
to the killer.

684
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:11,738
(moans)

685
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:16,201
Emmett: Well now, the bad part
for Vicky, though no fault of her own,

686
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:19,148
was, well, she kinda reminded
Cyrus of the missus.

687
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:23,279
- And that...
- 'Bout time you woke up.

688
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:26,484
...that just never played out no matter
how many times he tried it.

689
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:28,116
I had to fix my own dinner.

690
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:33,322
What the fuck? Where am I?

691
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:35,355
Don't you cuss.

692
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,367
Whores cuss. My mama cussed.

693
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,232
I told you that before.

694
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,734
Who the hell are you?

695
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:50,338
Why am I handcuffed
to this fucking chair?

696
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:52,611
Three years married and you forget?

697
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,016
- Just like you.
- Mister, we aren't married.

698
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,350
Get these goddamn handcuffs off of me!

699
00:42:57,388 --> 00:43:01,085
It's Cyrus! And you take
the Lord's name in vain again,

700
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,457
I will slit your throat.

701
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:07,487
You already broke enough
of His commandments.

702
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,540
Take these handcuffs off me, Cyrus?

703
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:24,571
Why? You go see your boyfriend,
the salesman?

704
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:28,051
- What salesman?
- I see the way you look at him.

705
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,417
- You think I'm stupid!
- No.

706
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,253
Well, I'm not!

707
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:36,487
No, baby.

708
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:39,962
So I can eat.

709
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:42,625
Damn.

710
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:51,234
Are you gonna stay put?

711
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:52,970
- Yeah.
- Huh?

712
00:43:56,013 --> 00:43:57,708
(keys jangle)

713
00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:33,509
(forced) Mmm.

714
00:44:33,551 --> 00:44:36,349
Baby.

715
00:44:36,387 --> 00:44:38,514
- I need a knife.
- Why?

716
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:42,784
So I can cut my steak.

717
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:48,392
(chuckles)

718
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:58,500
I had a pretty good run
at the store today.

719
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:02,308
Just about sold out of meat.

720
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:05,543
I told you, baby girl,
we'd make things work here.

721
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:10,043
Just like I p-promised your daddy.

722
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:14,186
Just like I promised you.

723
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:21,392
Damn.

724
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:28,262
Keys!

725
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:32,600
Keys?

726
00:45:32,643 --> 00:45:35,669
Oh.

727
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:38,682
(engine cranks)

728
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:41,116
Going to see him, ain't you?
You don't like it around here?

729
00:45:41,152 --> 00:45:44,349
Ain't good enough here for you?
Huh? Is that what it is?

730
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:46,754
You think he does it better than I do?
Well, I'll show you.

731
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,884
I'll fucking show you. I'll show you.

732
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:52,962
- (yelps) No.
- (grunting)

733
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:55,625
- Huh?
- (sobbing)

734
00:45:57,701 --> 00:45:59,498
No!

735
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:13,913
(Vicky sobbing)

736
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:21,789
What?

737
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:24,890
You all sad because you can't
go see your boyfriend?

738
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:27,625
Please. (sobbing)

739
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:30,862
Please just let me go home.

740
00:46:36,574 --> 00:46:40,135
This is your home. Come on.

741
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:42,873
- Come on.
- No! No.

742
00:46:42,913 --> 00:46:45,381
(baby's crying echoes)

743
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:47,907
Now you've done it.

744
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:50,250
You went and woke up the baby.

745
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:52,380
What? I don't know--

746
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:02,729
Are you just gonna stand there
and let him cry?

747
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:04,734
What? No!

748
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:08,932
He's hungry.

749
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:11,305
- Feed him.
- Who?

750
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:13,435
Feed him!

751
00:47:13,477 --> 00:47:15,672
Oh! Okay, don't hurt me, please.

752
00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:19,111
I'll feed him. Where's the bottle?

753
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,278
The boy don't need no bottle.
It ain't healthy.

754
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,516
What do you mean?

755
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:27,820
- (screams)
- Get up.

756
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:30,326
No. No.

757
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:33,387
Climb them stairs, woman!

758
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,398
There you go. Come on.

759
00:47:35,432 --> 00:47:37,423
Mommy's coming. Go ahead.

760
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:41,336
- But I-- I don't-- I don't hear--
- I can't stand that crying.

761
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:44,273
- Now make it stop!
- Okay, no. Please.

762
00:47:44,308 --> 00:47:46,071
Mommy's coming.

763
00:47:54,352 --> 00:47:56,586
(screams) Oh God, it's dead.

764
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,056
Liar! Don't lie to me.

765
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,524
Please, no.

766
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,188
- No.
- No son of mine...

767
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:08,824
- (handcuffs clicking)
- ...is gonna go hungry.

768
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:11,801
Now you feed him
or there'll be hell to pay.

769
00:48:11,835 --> 00:48:13,803
(sobbing)

770
00:48:15,105 --> 00:48:16,868
Go on.

771
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:21,902
Oh.

772
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:45,200
Well, he ain't gonna feed himself.

773
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:00,541
(sobbing continues)

774
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:18,628
(Cyrus moans)

775
00:49:18,669 --> 00:49:21,365
If you rock him,
he'll go out like a light.

776
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:31,075
He likes that Rock-a-Bye song.

777
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:34,144
Sing.

778
00:49:34,184 --> 00:49:38,314

779
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:43,049

Who told you to bring
that thing in here?

791
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:31,366
Huh?

792
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:34,639
You think that's what I need?

793
00:50:34,678 --> 00:50:37,272
Another mouth to feed?

794
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:39,714
Like you're not enough?

795
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:43,015
Huh? Do you see what I do
to put food in your mouth?

796
00:50:43,053 --> 00:50:46,580
And now you want me to feed
another little bastard, huh?

797
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:48,591
He don't eat much.

798
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,358
He don't eat much.

799
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:58,165
Let me see that thing.

800
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:04,270
Oh, he is kinda cute, huh?

801
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:07,802
You know what kind of doggies
don't eat much?

802
00:51:08,812 --> 00:51:10,803
(puppy yelps, bones crack)

803
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:13,680
Dead ones.

804
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:27,897
(whispers) Cyrus?

805
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:32,535
Cyrus, are you awake?

806
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:47,770
(gasps)

807
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:10,300
(lock clicks)

808
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:40,993
I told you--

809
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:43,431
- hell to pay.
- Please don't hurt me.

810
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,935
I'll do anything. I'll stay.

811
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:47,903
- I promise I'll stay.
- Oh no, baby girl.

812
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:49,303
We're way past promises.

813
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:52,240
You're trying to embarrass me
in front of the whole town.

814
00:53:58,782 --> 00:54:00,943
(Vicky wheezes, coughs)

815
00:54:05,255 --> 00:54:07,314
Gonna let the whole world know

816
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:09,416
that I married a whore!

817
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:11,450
No, please.

818
00:54:12,496 --> 00:54:15,294
I promise I'll stay.

819
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:20,266
- (whimpering)
- You want to let everybody know?

820
00:54:20,304 --> 00:54:23,205
- No.
- Huh?

821
00:54:25,342 --> 00:54:28,641
Well, let's let 'em know!

822
00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:35,351
(screams)

823
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:46,352
No more. No more, please.

824
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:48,364
- Please.
- All right.

825
00:54:48,398 --> 00:54:50,628
No more lies, woman.

826
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:58,235
- You told them, didn't you?
- No.

827
00:54:58,275 --> 00:54:59,503
Please.

828
00:54:59,543 --> 00:55:02,410
You did. Oh, you did.

829
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:05,006
After you promised
you wouldn't tell anybody.

830
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:18,553
No! (screaming)

831
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:26,362
(gurgling)

832
00:55:35,312 --> 00:55:37,507
(metal clatters)

833
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:47,289
I told you not to move.

834
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:51,161
(screams)

835
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:54,289
You know, when you strangle someone,

836
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:58,290
they go through these phases

837
00:55:58,335 --> 00:55:59,927
with their eyes.

838
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:03,030
Maria: How do you feel
about his upcoming execution?

839
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:05,473
I just think it's wrong that he's--

840
00:56:05,509 --> 00:56:08,535
that he's gonna get a shot
and go to sleep.

841
00:56:08,578 --> 00:56:12,981
First it's fear and anger.

842
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:16,577
I think he should be in prison.
I think he should suffer.

843
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,181
I've been in prison for 12 years.
My life is not normal.

844
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,021
I can't go out.
There's nothing I can do.

845
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,358
And I think he should suffer.

846
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:28,023
I think he should know what
it feels like in a real prison.

847
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,764
Second, total panic.

848
00:56:32,803 --> 00:56:35,237
I am not afraid of him!

849
00:56:35,272 --> 00:56:37,365
He may haunt me.

850
00:56:37,407 --> 00:56:40,103
He may have half my brain,
half my body, but--

851
00:56:40,143 --> 00:56:44,239
I may have to fight him off,
but I'm not afraid of him.

852
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:48,249
Third, complete surrender.

853
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:51,645
I just--

854
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:54,953
I just think about the other
parents of the other girls

855
00:56:54,991 --> 00:56:57,824
and I'm just sorry for them--

856
00:56:57,861 --> 00:56:59,852
that I lived

857
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:02,262
and their children died.

858
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:06,531
And last they get this...

859
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:10,468
1,000-yard stare.

860
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:12,270
And then nothing.

861
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:16,268
But does his execution help me?

862
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:20,174
No.

863
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:22,014
If you're still

864
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:24,486
raping a bitch as she's dying,

865
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:27,285
when her body goes
into those final spasms,

866
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:29,554
her pussy

867
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:32,494
grabs your dick and pulls on it
as if it's milking it.

868
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:35,364
I like that part a lot.

869
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:51,043
- Look out!
- Shh shh, be quiet, Tina.

870
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:53,345
What? Where are we?

871
00:57:53,383 --> 00:57:55,317
A deer jumped out and you hit it.
You remember?

872
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:58,014
Yeah, I remember, but what the hell?

873
00:57:58,054 --> 00:58:00,022
- (rattles)
- I don't know.

874
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:02,217
I can't see-- my glasses.

875
00:58:02,259 --> 00:58:04,489
- Chloe, where's Vicky?
- I don't know.

876
00:58:05,629 --> 00:58:08,257
(gasps, screams)

877
00:58:08,298 --> 00:58:10,698
- Oh my God.
- (shrieking)

878
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:14,399
- Chloe: Tina, what is it? Just tell me.
- Vicky!

879
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:17,873
Vicky, Vicky.

880
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:19,739
Oh my God.

881
00:58:19,776 --> 00:58:22,609
- Chloe: Tina, what is it? Just tell me.
- Vicky!

882
00:58:22,646 --> 00:58:24,409
Vicky, please!

883
00:58:26,883 --> 00:58:28,817
- (Vicky moans)
- Chloe: What is it?

884
00:58:31,454 --> 00:58:35,117
- Vicky, Vicky.
- Oh my God, is she all right?

885
00:58:36,726 --> 00:58:40,184
Tina. Tina, what is it already?
Tell me, please?

886
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:42,391
I can't see!

887
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:47,294
Vicky.

888
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:53,834
Vicky.

889
00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:57,970
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

890
00:58:58,014 --> 00:58:59,777
Vicky.

891
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:02,546
- (thuds)
- No-ooo.

892
00:59:02,586 --> 00:59:04,554
(girls sobbing)

893
00:59:09,192 --> 00:59:11,456
No.

894
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:13,894
God no.

895
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:18,557
Emmett: He spent a good minute
or two examining her face,

896
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:21,298
turning her head from side to side

897
00:59:21,338 --> 00:59:23,670
to take in every bit of Vicky's pain.

898
00:59:25,809 --> 00:59:27,236
He liked it.

899
00:59:27,495 --> 00:59:29,438
He liked it because he knew it.

900
00:59:31,081 --> 00:59:33,345
Kinda got a dumb look
to her now, don't she?

901
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:36,079
Leave her alone, you bastard!

902
00:59:38,588 --> 00:59:41,022
Emmett: She was next and she knew it.

903
00:59:41,057 --> 00:59:44,720
She should have been quiet,
but she was rude.

904
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:47,059
And rude is bad.

905
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:50,362
What made the statement
particularly rude was that it was true.

906
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,632
True rude is much worse
than rude for rude's sake.

907
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:56,799
Man: Fucking whore.

908
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,001
When I'm done with you
I'm gonna do your little fucking kid.

909
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:03,274
Emmett: No one really asked
about who his father was.

910
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:05,804
Or where he went to.

911
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:10,513
About how his mother put bread
on the table before she left one day.

912
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:15,718
Or about what state workers do
to little orphan boys at night.

913
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:19,861
It wasn't anyone's business.

914
01:00:19,896 --> 01:00:22,023
Old Cyrus knew.

915
01:00:23,967 --> 01:00:26,834
Vicky knew too. Cyrus told her.

916
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,395
He liked sharing with his guests.

917
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:31,100
I told her not to move.

918
01:00:31,141 --> 01:00:35,578
Emmett: He was polite. It made
him feel closer to them, I guess.

919
01:00:35,612 --> 01:00:39,207
Sometimes a person
just needs someone to talk to.

920
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:41,774
And he wanted them to know

921
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:44,685
that other people suffer
in this world too.

922
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:47,053
They weren't alone really.

923
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:52,586

No, stop!

(moans)

951
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:08,663
He butchered them alive
and then fed them to other people?

952
01:03:08,698 --> 01:03:10,461
He killed most of them first,

953
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,162
but that "bastard" comment--
that really bothered him.

954
01:03:15,438 --> 01:03:18,305
He didn't particularly like
butchering them. He said that.

955
01:03:18,341 --> 01:03:22,004
But the moments leading up to it--
that he liked.

956
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:25,139
He said that fear was a pure emotion.

957
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:28,344
That look of fear in their eyes
always made him feel clean,

958
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:30,579
so he always butchered one
in front of the others.

959
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,588
So that he could see
that look in their eyes.

960
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:33,987
Jesus.

961
01:03:34,023 --> 01:03:37,982
Jesus had nothing to do with it.
It was need.

962
01:04:05,054 --> 01:04:07,284
Don't you cry, ma'am.

963
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:11,289
She's in a better place.

964
01:04:11,327 --> 01:04:14,490
Uh...

965
01:04:16,232 --> 01:04:19,326
I got something planned
real special for you tonight.

966
01:04:24,641 --> 01:04:27,109
Real special.

967
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:38,647
(gasps)

968
01:04:47,597 --> 01:04:50,327
If he killed all of them,

969
01:04:50,366 --> 01:04:52,561
how did that lead
to the beginning of the end?

970
01:04:52,602 --> 01:04:55,127
The cheating boyfriend.

971
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:57,639
It seems he had relatives
in the state capital.

972
01:04:57,674 --> 01:05:00,541
Cyrus?

973
01:05:00,577 --> 01:05:04,377
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I figured closing time'd be best.

974
01:05:04,414 --> 01:05:08,316
This here's Trooper Davis,
state police detective.

975
01:05:10,486 --> 01:05:13,421
It seems that boy
from the other day, well,

976
01:05:13,456 --> 01:05:15,788
his daddy's got some pull
at the capital.

977
01:05:15,825 --> 01:05:18,555
- Anyhow--
- Anyhow...

978
01:05:18,595 --> 01:05:22,053
it seems the missing ladies contacted

979
01:05:22,098 --> 01:05:25,534
Mr. Pendergrass at 6:58 PM.

980
01:05:25,568 --> 01:05:27,468
You close at 7:00, right?

981
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:30,063
It seems they can track those
cell phones

982
01:05:30,106 --> 01:05:32,939
with triangulation and GPS.

983
01:05:32,976 --> 01:05:36,036
Global positioning system.

984
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,207
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

985
01:05:40,216 --> 01:05:44,346
You do know what time
your stand closes, right?

986
01:05:44,387 --> 01:05:46,548
7:00.

987
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:48,819
(chuckles) 7:00.

988
01:05:48,858 --> 01:05:51,053
There was one other thing.

989
01:05:51,094 --> 01:05:54,120
There was another call 45 minutes later.

990
01:05:54,163 --> 01:05:56,529
- Do you know where that call was from?
- No.

991
01:05:56,566 --> 01:05:59,364
Not 100 yards from your front door.
So...

992
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:04,471
you should have seen them.

993
01:06:06,209 --> 01:06:08,177
I don't recall.

994
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:11,009
You don't recall three

995
01:06:11,047 --> 01:06:13,242
fine young things like them?

996
01:06:13,283 --> 01:06:15,148
No.

997
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:17,152
Let me tell you how this works:

998
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:20,553
some spoiled prick
calls my boss and tells him

999
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:23,218
his girlfriend's missing.

1000
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:26,285
And the local police,
well, they just ain't doing anything.

1001
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:29,355
So they drag my ass down here

1002
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:31,594
to find 'em. Now if I don't find 'em,

1003
01:06:31,634 --> 01:06:35,161
my boss is gonna throw
a whole world of shit on me.

1004
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:37,764
And I don't like shit on me,

1005
01:06:37,807 --> 01:06:40,367
so I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1006
01:06:41,544 --> 01:06:44,274
I want you to think real carefully
before you answer.

1007
01:06:46,683 --> 01:06:48,742
Did you see those ladies?

1008
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,384
I don't recall.

1009
01:06:53,423 --> 01:06:56,324
Then maybe you'd better
start thinking real hard

1010
01:06:56,359 --> 01:06:59,886
or maybe I'm gonna come back here

1011
01:06:59,929 --> 01:07:02,625
and ask a couple of questions tomorrow

1012
01:07:02,665 --> 01:07:06,066
with the local state health boys

1013
01:07:06,102 --> 01:07:09,128
and maybe we can do a couple
of inspections while you're thinking.

1014
01:07:09,172 --> 01:07:10,571
Maybe.

1015
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:16,240
Well?

1016
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:19,612
If you suddenly happen to recollect

1017
01:07:19,649 --> 01:07:22,243
you call me.

1018
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:28,146
- Sheriff: Sorry about this, Cyrus.
- Yeah.

1019
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:30,785
Davis: Real sorry.

1020
01:07:32,195 --> 01:07:34,561
I'll see you tomorrow.

1021
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:40,263
Emmett: Now I can't tell you what
went on in Cyrus's mind that night

1022
01:07:40,303 --> 01:07:42,669
'cause I didn't really understand it.

1023
01:07:42,705 --> 01:07:46,334
But the next morning, I figure
old Cyrus saw the writing on the wall

1024
01:07:46,376 --> 01:07:48,844
plain as the writing
on that trooper's card.

1025
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:51,847
And that writing said it was the end.

1026
01:07:53,316 --> 01:07:57,047
I guess the only choice Cyrus had left
was how the end was going to happen.

1027
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:03,350
If I'd known what he was going to do,
I might've tried to talk him out of it.

1028
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:05,827
It wouldn't have worked,
but I'd have tried.

1029
01:08:05,862 --> 01:08:09,195
See, trying to talk old Cyrus
out of anything

1030
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:11,962
was like trying to talk
water out of being wet.

1031
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:14,561
It just don't happen.

1032
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:22,543
And I don't know what he said
to that old boy on the phone,

1033
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:26,241
but it got his attention
and he'd be there soon enough.

1034
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:31,344
I guess the truth screams,
no matter how long it takes.

1035
01:08:37,727 --> 01:08:41,094
And I can't tell you how long he just
looked at her, because I don't know.

1036
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:43,121
I'm guessing it was awhile.

1037
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:46,135
And he would have kept looking
except for the siren we fixed up.

1038
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:48,137
(buzzing)

1039
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:50,139
That's what woke her.

1040
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:53,199
(whimpers)

1041
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:06,882
(sobbing)

1042
01:09:14,197 --> 01:09:16,825
- Shh.
- (sobbing continues)

1043
01:09:23,139 --> 01:09:25,369
Shh.

1044
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:36,341
Yeah.

1045
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:38,546
Shh.

1046
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:43,720
I got something real special for you.

1047
01:09:45,828 --> 01:09:47,887
Don't you move.

1048
01:09:59,675 --> 01:10:01,905
Vicky...

1049
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:07,945
she told me.

1050
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:11,578
About Luke.

1051
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:16,258
I know what it's like, miss,

1052
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:18,522
to be left...

1053
01:10:20,496 --> 01:10:22,259
to be cheated on.

1054
01:10:26,202 --> 01:10:29,035
- It's a powerful pain.
- (moaning)

1055
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:35,133
- (screaming)
- Unless you get rid of it...

1056
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:41,509
you can't find any peace at all.

1057
01:10:44,387 --> 01:10:46,753
Just...

1058
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:55,787
(sobs)

1059
01:10:55,831 --> 01:10:58,527
I want you to have peace before you go.

1060
01:10:58,568 --> 01:11:00,866
Please.

1061
01:11:04,907 --> 01:11:07,467
Oh my.

1062
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:09,444
The way I see it

1063
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:12,845
this old boy owes you an apology.

1064
01:11:14,283 --> 01:11:15,773
I don't want it.

1065
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:18,446
And we ain't gonna stop...

1066
01:11:19,755 --> 01:11:21,985
until we get one.

1067
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:24,390
Isn't that right?

1068
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:31,295
No!

1069
01:11:31,334 --> 01:11:33,131
(grunting)

1070
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:39,766
(Luke screaming)

1071
01:11:50,486 --> 01:11:52,818
Watch this.

1072
01:11:55,825 --> 01:11:59,124
Emmett: I reckon it was about then
that first siren went off.

1073
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:01,755
- (buzzing)
- And what Cyrus did next

1074
01:12:01,797 --> 01:12:03,992
made Chloe have what you might call

1075
01:12:04,033 --> 01:12:06,399
one of those moments of epiphany.

1076
01:12:06,435 --> 01:12:09,427
It always did with every one of them.

1077
01:12:09,472 --> 01:12:12,908
He placed the bat on the ground
right in front of her,

1078
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:15,911
turned his back toward her
and stared at Luke in the eye.

1079
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:22,112
He could have said anything,

1080
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:24,949
but Cyrus always said the same thing.

1081
01:12:24,987 --> 01:12:27,615
Now make it stop.

1082
01:12:27,657 --> 01:12:30,922
Emmett: And Chloe,
she was happy to oblige.

1083
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,827
They always were. She turned around

1084
01:12:33,863 --> 01:12:36,923
and ran up those stairs
right past that siren.

1085
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:40,959
- The door was locked.
- God! Please, somebody help me!

1086
01:12:41,003 --> 01:12:43,096
- Emmett: It always was.
- Please!

1087
01:12:43,139 --> 01:12:46,165
So she must have headed
back down those stairs

1088
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:48,369
and that's when she noticed the tunnel.

1089
01:12:48,411 --> 01:12:52,780
Been there the whole time.
You couldn't see it from the cages.

1090
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:55,750
That was sorta the plan.

1091
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:01,078
She may not have known where that
tunnel led, but she had to be thinking

1092
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:03,717
whatever was ahead of her

1093
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:06,023
is better than what was behind her.

1094
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:11,097
And what was ahead of her
was a locked trapdoor.

1095
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:16,068
But it'd be opening soon enough.

1096
01:13:16,105 --> 01:13:19,268
Just as soon as that car
tripped the second siren.

1097
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:21,242
- (buzzes)
- (Chloe yells) Please!

1098
01:13:21,277 --> 01:13:23,575
Emmett: Chloe probably
had about two seconds

1099
01:13:23,612 --> 01:13:27,139
before she'd realize the door'd open
onto the old road near Cyrus's house.

1100
01:13:27,183 --> 01:13:30,084
She probably had about another
second before she realized

1101
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:32,610
the car coming down that road
was about to kill her.

1102
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:47,227
That's still more time
than that trooper had

1103
01:13:47,269 --> 01:13:51,103
before his swerve to avoid what
he probably thought was a deer

1104
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:55,042
that had jumped out on the road.
See, Cyrus had that door rigged

1105
01:13:55,077 --> 01:13:58,740
to open just as that car
would get to it.

1106
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:27,705
Well, I guess that's
the end of the story.

1107
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:30,109
I warned you it ain't no fairy tale.

1108
01:14:32,815 --> 01:14:35,648
(exhales) It's getting late.
I guess you all want to leave.

1109
01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:39,381
Um, just one more thing.

1110
01:14:40,956 --> 01:14:43,516
The door trap...

1111
01:14:43,559 --> 01:14:46,050
how did he time that out?

1112
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:50,495
You know, I never really figured it out
and he tried to explain it to me,

1113
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:52,592
but I never got it.

1114
01:14:52,635 --> 01:14:54,865
You know, you can go over there with me.

1115
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:56,565
Maybe you could figure it out.

1116
01:14:56,605 --> 01:14:59,574
- You mean it's still there?
- Sure, the house-- everything.

1117
01:15:03,112 --> 01:15:04,909
You'll take us there?

1118
01:15:04,947 --> 01:15:07,575
I had a feeling you were
gonna ask me for that.

1119
01:15:08,651 --> 01:15:10,551
No problem at all.

1120
01:15:10,586 --> 01:15:12,713
That would be--
that would be great, right, Tom?

1121
01:15:12,755 --> 01:15:14,620
(flatly) Yeah, great.

1122
01:15:14,657 --> 01:15:16,522
I don't think we should be doing this.

1123
01:15:16,559 --> 01:15:19,084
Yes, we should absolutely be doing this.
Yes yes yes.

1124
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:21,528
- Don't-- don't.
- We just agreed to go see

1125
01:15:21,564 --> 01:15:23,725
a place where people
have been slaughtered.

1126
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:25,358
- Yes yes!
- Like he just happens

1127
01:15:25,401 --> 01:15:28,336
to have a bunch of IDs?
Like, what? Are you high?

1128
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,964
- They are not his.
- Of course they're not his!

1129
01:15:31,006 --> 01:15:33,566
They're of his victims.
He killed a bunch of fucking people!

1130
01:15:33,609 --> 01:15:36,737
- No, he didn't.
- Oh yeah, he just what, collects them?

1131
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:40,112
Please please pull it together, okay?
For me can you pull it together?

1132
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:45,583
Emmett: Watch your step.

1133
01:15:50,492 --> 01:15:53,359
- Oh yeah.
- Maria: Oh, I want to get all this.

1134
01:15:53,395 --> 01:15:55,886
- All of it.
- Emmett: This is where it all happened.

1135
01:15:55,931 --> 01:15:59,230
Right here, right here, right here.
Life and death.

1136
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:03,329
The whole universe
in this one little room.

1137
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,740
Oh, is, uh-- is that the signal?

1138
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:08,743
- (buzzes)
- Tom: Oh shit!

1139
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:11,940
Hey, don't cuss in this house.
That's not right. People died here.

1140
01:16:11,981 --> 01:16:14,142
(whispers) I'm sorry.

1141
01:16:14,183 --> 01:16:17,914
- I guess it still works.
- Yeah, goddamn right.

1142
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:20,421
That means a car
is passing along the road.

1143
01:16:20,456 --> 01:16:23,448
It'll end up here
in a couple of minutes.

1144
01:16:23,492 --> 01:16:25,426
Yeah.

1145
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:28,021
Hey, get footage of these cages

1146
01:16:28,063 --> 01:16:30,497
and get the rest of the room, okay?

1147
01:16:30,532 --> 01:16:34,024
Emmett: Huh, at least
that's how we tried to time it.

1148
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:37,903
I don't know why I say "we,"
because it was all Cyrus.

1149
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,374
It seems in the war he used to

1150
01:16:40,409 --> 01:16:43,276
have these booby traps
and a soldier would step on it

1151
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:45,712
and knock him into another soldier
and that soldier would

1152
01:16:45,748 --> 01:16:48,012
get knocked into another one
and on and on and on.

1153
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:51,110
We didn't have any mines.

1154
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:53,519
We had two little tripwires.

1155
01:16:59,595 --> 01:17:01,859
That's better.

1156
01:17:01,897 --> 01:17:05,355
The car would run over that wire
and set that off

1157
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:08,165
and let Cyrus know
he had about one minute,

1158
01:17:08,203 --> 01:17:12,663
which was enough time to let them
run like rats out that hole.

1159
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:17,077
But he would leave the bat
for them to hit him right there.

1160
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:23,482
The timing was the tricky part,

1161
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:26,818
so we added another wire and rigged it
so the trapdoor would open just in time

1162
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:29,289
for the last one
to run out onto the road

1163
01:17:29,325 --> 01:17:31,088
before the car got 'em.

1164
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:34,829
And then we'd have a lot more
to work with.

1165
01:17:36,799 --> 01:17:39,893
- Tom!
- I'm getting a few shots of this door.

1166
01:17:41,637 --> 01:17:44,231
Jesus, these people tried to claw
their way out of here.

1167
01:17:46,141 --> 01:17:48,609
See, that's the look
I was talking about.

1168
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:51,044
There is no Cyrus. It's you.

1169
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,945
Now that ain't true at all.

1170
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:55,507
I spoke to him today while you
and your cameraman were setting up.

1171
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:58,577
Yeah. Oh, I'm sure you did.

1172
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:01,088
What, with that state boy dying,

1173
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:04,650
we figured it'd be best for Cyrus
to pull up stakes and move.

1174
01:18:04,693 --> 01:18:07,389
He only moved about six hours
away from here.

1175
01:18:07,429 --> 01:18:10,762
About the same amount of time
I've been talking to you.

1176
01:18:10,799 --> 01:18:15,236
Well, if you're not him, then how
do you know about everything?

1177
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:18,000
Well, he told me.
He'd call me and he'd say,

1178
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,804
"Come pick up these cars I got."

1179
01:18:20,843 --> 01:18:23,277
See, I run a scrapyard

1180
01:18:23,312 --> 01:18:25,644
about 18 miles down the road from here,

1181
01:18:25,681 --> 01:18:30,550
mostly crushing washers and dryers,
farm equipment and cars--

1182
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:33,248
things that people don't need anymore.

1183
01:18:34,623 --> 01:18:38,923
You know, we would sit
and have breakfast.

1184
01:18:38,961 --> 01:18:42,624
Cyrus would mostly talk
about how his week went.

1185
01:18:42,664 --> 01:18:46,623
I'd nod. You see,
what I figure is a man needs

1186
01:18:46,668 --> 01:18:48,966
someone to talk to once in a while.

1187
01:18:49,004 --> 01:18:51,632
Yeah, just clear his conscience.

1188
01:18:51,673 --> 01:18:54,267
Like I did with you.

1189
01:18:54,309 --> 01:18:57,472
Don't! Don't you fucking move.

1190
01:18:57,513 --> 01:19:00,710
Tom, get the goddamn door. Tom!

1191
01:19:09,058 --> 01:19:11,458
- (moans)
- Emmett: Hey, Cyrus.

1192
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:18,630
It's you.

1193
01:19:20,035 --> 01:19:22,560
Emmett: I feel it's a real
kind of compliment

1194
01:19:22,604 --> 01:19:25,471
that Cyrus confides in me
and lets me keep my tongue.

1195
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:29,440
He knows that I wouldn't let the cat
out of the bag or spill the beans.

1196
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:32,504
Why would I? We've been working together

1197
01:19:32,548 --> 01:19:34,641
since the first day that stand opened.

1198
01:19:34,683 --> 01:19:36,742
I feel kinda guilty

1199
01:19:36,785 --> 01:19:40,380
because I'm the one
that suggested that whole grill idea.

1200
01:19:40,422 --> 01:19:42,117
People on the go
like that sort if thing.

1201
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:43,454
I just might.

1202
01:19:44,493 --> 01:19:46,324
(chuckles)

1203
01:19:46,361 --> 01:19:48,921
I'll be goddamned.

1204
01:19:48,964 --> 01:19:51,865
- I guess I'll leave you two.
- (sobs)

1205
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:55,631
- I've really got to pick up your van.
- Please please.

1206
01:19:55,671 --> 01:19:59,232
You know, you remind him of his missus.

1207
01:19:59,274 --> 01:20:02,971
I don't see it, but I guess he does.

1208
01:20:04,113 --> 01:20:06,274
I guess he does.

1209
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:17,357
(door opens)

1210
01:20:17,392 --> 01:20:19,257
(door closes)

1211
01:20:19,294 --> 01:20:21,353
- (beeps)
- Maria: Let's get this thing.

1212
01:20:21,396 --> 01:20:24,058
Oh wait. Light's not right.
We should wait till the sun moves.

1213
01:20:24,099 --> 01:20:25,623
We can't. We've got a live one.

1214
01:20:25,667 --> 01:20:28,500
Some guy called and said we have
to meet him at his house at 10:00.

1215
01:20:28,537 --> 01:20:30,129
- A townie?
- Yep. Let's go.

1216
01:20:30,172 --> 01:20:31,901
All right.

1217
01:20:34,309 --> 01:20:37,540
- Cyrus: Are we done?
- No, we need to flip for your single.

1218
01:20:37,579 --> 01:20:39,877
Cyrus: Is this about the Highway Hunter?

1219
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:41,439
The who?

1220
01:20:41,483 --> 01:20:43,951
They say he killed over 200 people
and just disappeared.

1221
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:45,749
Really?

1222
01:20:45,787 --> 01:20:48,415
Would you frame up? Thanks.

1223
01:20:48,457 --> 01:20:50,687
I'm sorry, you were saying?

1224
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:54,423
It happened about five hours
from here-- Arkham Heights.

1225
01:20:55,797 --> 01:20:58,197
You ask around.
People will know something.

1226
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:00,292
Mr. Adders, we need you to sit down.

1227
01:21:00,335 --> 01:21:01,495
Sorry.

1228
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:05,237

1229
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:08,640
Thanks.

But the fantasy is never
totally fulfilled

1251
01:24:24,706 --> 01:24:28,142
and the anger and the resentment
are never resolved,

1252
01:24:28,176 --> 01:24:31,907
so tragically the cycle of fantasy
and murder repeats itself.

1253
01:24:31,947 --> 01:24:36,077
There's always that desire
to reenact the sequence

1254
01:24:36,118 --> 01:24:38,882
in the quest for ultimate fulfillment.

1255
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,254
The fantasies and thought processes
must come from somewhere.

1256
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:45,953
And we can only assume that the origins

1257
01:24:45,994 --> 01:24:48,963
lie in the person's personal history.

at any one time

We've got five of them
incarcerated in this facility.

1317

All of them are on death row.

1318
01:27:47,742 --> 01:27:50,176
Maria: There are those like myself
who question

1319
01:27:50,211 --> 01:27:53,146
the death penalty,
say it's only legalized murder,

1320
01:27:53,181 --> 01:27:56,412
- that minorities are--
- Look, I know all the arguments.

1321
01:27:56,451 --> 01:28:00,148
That death sentences are unfairly
dealt out to minorities.

1322
01:28:00,188 --> 01:28:03,954
That an innocent man might
be executed in error.

1323
01:28:05,393 --> 01:28:08,226
Those arguments don't
stand up with serial killers.

1324
01:28:08,263 --> 01:28:10,857
First, most serial killers are white.

1325
01:28:10,899 --> 01:28:14,858
Second, the question
of executing an innocent man

1326
01:28:14,903 --> 01:28:16,894
isn't really an issue.

1327
01:28:16,938 --> 01:28:19,873
The question isn't if, but how many.

1328
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:24,979
Look, I'm all for talking
to these serial killers

1329
01:28:25,013 --> 01:28:26,571
to find out why they did it

1330
01:28:26,615 --> 01:28:29,243
and to capture and prevent
others from doing it.

1331
01:28:29,284 --> 01:28:32,913
But once that is done,
justice should be swift.

1332
01:28:34,055 --> 01:28:37,923
The death sentence may not
necessarily be a deterrent.

1333
01:28:37,959 --> 01:28:42,191
But it is a good means
of administering justice.

1334
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:44,960
Maria: I only have a few more questions.

1335
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,562
No no no, let me ask you
a couple of questions first.

1336
01:28:49,604 --> 01:28:52,732
How many lives does a man have to take

1337
01:28:52,774 --> 01:28:56,107
before we deem his life unworthy?

1338
01:28:56,144 --> 01:28:59,409
How god-awful does a man have to be

1339
01:28:59,447 --> 01:29:02,280
before we pronounce him
beyond salvation?

1340
01:29:03,318 --> 01:29:06,219
How many death sentences
need to be handed down

1341
01:29:06,254 --> 01:29:08,848
before the first one is carried out?

1342
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:11,791
I want you to answer
those questions for me first.

1343
01:29:11,826 --> 01:29:16,058
Oh, by the way, the guy
you interviewed earlier--

1344
01:29:16,097 --> 01:29:20,500
the Satanist who gouges
his victims eyes out--

1345
01:29:22,804 --> 01:29:26,672
sits around watching television,
piling his pentagrams up

1346
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:30,269
and paying attention
to the needs of his fan club.

1347
01:29:30,311 --> 01:29:33,769
His state-paid-for psychiatrist

1348
01:29:33,815 --> 01:29:37,182
said he apparently
is very happy with his life.

1349
01:29:37,218 --> 01:29:41,746
He's healthy, robust and doesn't need
any medications to sleep.
