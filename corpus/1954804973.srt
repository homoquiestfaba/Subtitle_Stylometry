1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,130
One more.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,590
One more.

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,380
Where's the rest
the track team?

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,040
Went home.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,540
Come on!

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,800
KIDNAPPED IN FULL DAYLIGHT
Based on actual events

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,810
God.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,730
- Anne, I have something for you.
- What? What?

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,130
- Close your eyes.
- What is it?

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,660
Close your eyes.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,030
Stretch out your hand.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,690
- What is this?
- Happy birthday a month.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,520
How old do I have? 6?

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,350
It has a lot of
pets in your room.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,880
So who will pick up
the movie tonight?

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,590
- Who ever gets.
- The Panthers did not.

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,830
Come on! It's Drew Barrymore.

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,820
Why not get the movie
I wanted to see Adam Sandler?

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,560
Okay.

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,000
See you tonight.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,820
- I will take the new CD you wanted.
- Cool.

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,630
- In my house at 19:30.
- Thanks for the teddy bear!

23
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,440
Looking for something?

24
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,840
- Where is your trophy?
- Where is your hair?

25
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,450
I missed you.

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,210
It was time that was not eating well.

27
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,880
- More potatoes?
- I could eat.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,410
Anne brings more to his brother.

29
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,610
Tom is already grandinho to catch them.

30
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,500
Honey, I think
should bring them.

31
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,740
- He's closer.
- Potatoes.

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,520
- Opened?
- Do not look at me.

33
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,190
Liar!

34
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,580
I got it. I did it!

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,300
I got it, Dad!

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,420
They said they had
beauty or brain.

37
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,370
- Now we know.
- Quiet.

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,530
My God. Gotta
Garry and tell Paige

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,660
- Now?
- Come on, Mom.

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,390
- Please, please.
- His brother has just come home.

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,100
Let it go, okay, Mom.

42
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,710
But do not stay up too late.

43
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,900
What, practically
I'm in college.

44
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,340
Until midnight and
not a minute more.

45
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,770
Well, Dad ...

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,130
Thank you. It is for the new CD

47
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,380
- We are so proud of you.
- I love you.

48
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,180
This is awesome!

49
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Hilltop Mall, Kearney,
Nebraska, 17:30 H

50
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,920
Sorry.

51
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,340
Help!

52
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,040
Help!

53
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,370
Somebody help me!

54
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,390
Somebody help me!

55
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,080
Help!

56
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,870
The vehicle is registered in
name of one Don Slaughty.

57
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,130
- Who?
- Slut, Slut Don.

58
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,240
And Anne appears as Slut
the major driver.

59
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,570
What? You know?

60
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,920
I open.

61
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,010
No, it was the home of Paige.
It was a few hours ago.

62
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,670
- And went to the mall.
- She'd buy a CD.

63
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,640
- He called for Paige?
- Elaine.

64
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,920
Witnesses saw as the
forced to enter into a van.

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,220
19:30 H
Kidnapping two hours more

66
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,370
Should not have yelled.

67
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,450
Why did you do that?

68
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,290
Answer me, why he cried?

69
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,290
Because he was grabbing me.

70
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,330
Well, sit down.

71
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,640
Come, sit.

72
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,310
Here.

73
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,190
It's a turkey,
two white occupants.

74
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,190
A 17 year old girl ...

75
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,610
It is believed that it is dangerous.

76
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,450
In most abductions
contact the family.

77
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,520
So let's install here
to trace the call.

78
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,640
Dave, I need it in the fax.

79
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,630
For money? A ransom?

80
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,710
Do not know yet. So we
to prepare ourselves if by chance you call.

81
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,440
So hopefully, nothing else?

82
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,540
- You must stay here.
- Doing nothing?

83
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,220
In the case of the kidnapper to call.

84
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,050
- Splendid!
- Tom, let them do their job.

85
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,930
Lord, what is happening?
Where is Anne?

86
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,900
We have to do
some questions.

87
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,390
- No problem.
- Understand that can be annoying.

88
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,330
Go down.

89
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,290
God, please.

90
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,160
- No. ..
- Be quiet.

91
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,800
- Just stay quiet.
- Do not hurt me.

92
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,700
Do not tell anyone.

93
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,620
I promise I will not say,
I will not say anything

94
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,130
Please let me go.

95
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,690
Please do not do it.

96
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,470
I propose a deal.

97
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,930
If you take the tape, let you go.

98
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,250
It's funny.

99
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,850
Time is running out.

100
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,240
Lost.

101
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,720
Could untie my hands?
I think we are still bleeding.

102
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,590
Let me see.

103
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,590
- Be quiet.
- Do not do it.

104
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,580
- There is something in the face.
- Do not touch me.

105
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,610
Let me go!

106
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,140
Family home slut, 22:35, Kearney,
Nebraska, 5 hours after the abduction

107
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,560
There are many reporters out there.

108
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,260
The more people come
Anne's face on television,

109
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,290
more options
that will let us know.

110
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,450
And there will be fewer places
this guy can hide.

111
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,590
You have the picture of Anne.
What are we waiting for?

112
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,070
Maybe not
goes as planned.

113
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,890
The gunman may
panic.

114
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,180
And it is a risk that
we have to consider.

115
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,730
Well, the story is already out there or
That is, is all over the news.

116
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,510
Put a photo of Anne help.

117
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,850
We should do that.

118
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,940
Tell us what you do, Mike.

119
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,910
- Here it comes.
- Detective ...

120
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,240
- Lord ...
- A question ...

121
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,120
There are approximately 5 hours,
Anne slut 17 years

122
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,170
was kidnapped
Hilltop Mall

123
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,970
by a white man
unidentified.

124
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,730
Anne measures 1.50 m.

125
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,030
Has brown hair
and blue eyes.

126
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,370
And it is with a blouse
Pink and blue jeans.

127
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,650
We ask all people here and
neighboring cities that remain watchful

128
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,740
and inform local police if
see Anne and her abductor.

129
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:34,020
When they were last seen
were in a dark blue van

130
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,380
with Louisiana plates.

131
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,810
- Detective ...
- Detective ...

132
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,790
Detective, the FBI is involved
in this investigation?

133
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,160
Well, if there is some indication that
Anne has been taken from the Nebraska

134
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,990
certainly will contact the FBI.

135
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,430
- Detective ...
- Detective ...

136
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,400
Not sure that almost 5%
of abducted children

137
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,990
are killed in the first
3 hours of the abduction?

138
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,210
That depends on
many circumstances.

139
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,960
And it is true that after
24 hours statistics

140
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,590
that are found alive
are virtually nil?

141
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,050
So we enlisted the help and
cooperation of all in this matter.

142
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,710
That was all. Thanks.

143
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,650
That's all there is?

144
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,280
I'm still here!

145
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,530
I'm still here!

146
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,210
Help!

147
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,190
Help me!

148
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,140
I can not move!

149
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,680
Please, please
I can not hold.

150
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,670
Please help me out.

151
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,290
I can not move!

152
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,600
Please.

153
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,300
My God, please
please help me.

154
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,520
My God, my God.

155
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,530
Please help me.

156
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,430
Please
help me or I'll drown.

157
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,620
I saved his life.

158
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,770
You're mine.

159
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,850
Family House Slut, Day 2

160
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,890
That's it.

161
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,850
- Are we ready?
- What do I say?

162
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,690
Stay calm and try to keep it
on the line as long as possible.

163
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,940
Very good. Ready?

164
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,890
Hello?

165
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,260
No, do not give interviews.

166
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,970
Imbeciles!

167
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,820
- If you see or hear another reporter ...
- I'll handle this.

168
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,470
Yes, I'm in the house now.

169
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,080
- Lady Slut.
- How did you here?

170
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,330
Get out now.

171
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,060
- You are making a mistake.
- Out of my house!

172
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,370
- Get it here.
- Tom, all is well.

173
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,540
We changed a little here.

174
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,030
- I can see.
- She is the Renalds agent, FBI.

175
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,510
FBI?

176
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,000
The plate was from Louisiana and can
be leaving the state with her.

177
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,850
And that translates into a
federal investigation.

178
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,600
So can Anne
be anywhere.

179
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,390
Arthur, Nebraska, Day 2

180
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,070
Come on, keep walking.

181
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,330
Try walking barefoot
with bleeding feet.

182
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,760
- Shows character.
- The bleeding feet?

183
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,540
Pain.

184
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,500
I am a family friend.
Are waiting for me.

185
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,200
Come on! Come on!

186
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,270
Come on!

187
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,240
Yes!

188
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,500
I really thank you.
It is best to get her out of here.

189
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,130
This will help.

190
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,990
I do not think well leave.

191
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,780
Elaine does not think about it.

192
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,140
You need rest.
Awake 36 hours.

193
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,460
Even a few hours
sleep in my house

194
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,670
away from it all would
very well for you.

195
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,720
Thanks, Diane.

196
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,740
Take care of everything here.

197
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,560
Okay, Mom.

198
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,440
Torrington, Wyoming, near the
Nebraska border, Day 2

199
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,080
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

200
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,080
What's your name?

201
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,030
You can grab a cookie, Anne.

202
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,040
What's your name?

203
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,220
They call me Jack.

204
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,300
As the Jack Rabbit.
Fast and strong.

205
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,540
Should do much exercise.

206
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,260
It's always good to find something
do. Help cool the mind.

207
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,910
You're fine.

208
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,530
Very good.

209
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,190
You may eat another.

210
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,950
My grandmother and my sister
were from a Catholic school.

211
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,720
If we confess our sins

212
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,860
then He is faithful and just
and forgive our sins.

213
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,540
Maybe.

214
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,310
You know? There are probably many
people looking for me.

215
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,670
Perhaps I should say
someone I'm fine.

216
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,200
Perhaps there would be less
problems that way.

217
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,020
Want to call home and say:
"Damn, I'm your daughter?"

218
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,770
I can say that was my idea.

219
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,460
Not even have to be my
parents can call a friend.

220
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,660
And say what went on vacation?

221
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,170
Yes, of course.

222
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,960
Closes it.

223
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,540
The sink!

224
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,000
Diane meets.

225
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,800
- What do I say?
- Say hello, be natural.

226
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,960
Come on, answer.

227
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,880
Hello? Hello?

228
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,640
Hi, Elaine is?

229
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,750
No, not Elaine
it is now.

230
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,430
- You know him?
- Anne?

231
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,250
- Yes.
- Anne where are you?

232
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,860
I'm fine. At least
I'm not sore or anything.

233
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,310
- How we'll bring you home?
- Hopefully soon.

234
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,060
I could say to Elaine
I called?

235
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,590
Are you ...? Anne?

236
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,080
- We track?
- No, not last long enough.

237
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,920
Holiday, waiting
that said vacation.

238
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,350
- Hung up before.
- You took too long.

239
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,920
Calls another person,
another friend.

240
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,110
Alive. Anne is alive, we
tell that to Don and Elaine

241
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,530
Sure.

242
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,410
Kate, I want a recording?

243
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,850
Hi, Elaine is?

244
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,750
No, not Elaine
it is now.

245
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,180
- You know him?
- Hear that?

246
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,700
- Looks like highway traffic.
- Of course.

247
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,590
Anne where are you?

248
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,900
I'm fine. At least
I'm not sore or anything.

249
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,250
- Listen.
- How we'll bring you home?

250
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,160
Hopefully, soon.

251
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,900
I could say to Elaine
I called?

252
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,850
They listened carefully to
Elaine said she?

253
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,080
The gunman should be with her.

254
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,880
Why not ask the mother.

255
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,750
I knew we'd be here.

256
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,020
Whatever it is by what is
spending is targeted.

257
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,040
- Hello?
- Paige?

258
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,650
My God!

259
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,620
My god is alive!
Where are you?

260
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,760
- Okay?
- I'm fine.

261
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,580
Do not worry.

262
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,180
Just ... want some
Holiday equity.

263
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,240
Good girl.

264
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,640
I think we can now
start our vacation.

265
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,500
- She called?
- Yes.

266
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,710
- Elaine, I could hear well.
- What'd she say?

267
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,060
Also called Paige.
We have the tape.

268
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,400
- Did you hear his voice?
- We know which track to follow?

269
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,840
Did little to track down but we know
who called for a highway phone.

270
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,930
Listen.

271
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,440
- Hello?
- Paige?

272
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,210
My God!

273
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,900
My god is alive!
Where are you?

274
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,340
- Okay?
- I'm fine.

275
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,130
Do not worry.

276
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,620
Just ... want some
Holiday equity.

277
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,100
Wait. Listen carefully
the last thing she said.

278
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,200
I'm fine. Do not worry.

279
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,730
Just ... want some
Holiday equity.

280
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,030
Anne did not say vacation
quality but of fairness.

281
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,380
Just ... want some
Holiday equity.

282
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,440
- What does it mean?
- Equity.

283
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,700
Wyoming is the state of equity.

284
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,170
How is she so smart?

285
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,290
Yes it is.

286
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,660
That the authorities in Wyoming
should be aware of a blue van.

287
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,880
At least we have
where to start.

288
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,270
Somewhere
Wyoming, Day 2

289
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,610
So where do we go on vacation?

290
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,590
The Washington?

291
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,850
With all those trees

292
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,410
or the desert, Nevada?

293
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,140
Or Ukon?

294
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,490
Nobody will find us there.

295
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,040
Always wanted to go to Ukon.

296
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,340
Some boys were gathered

297
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,630
in the canteen.

298
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,790
A song in the Jukebox.

299
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:16,060
At the bar, in a solitary game,

300
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:21,240
sat the dangerous
Dan McGroove

301
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,580
and seeing their luck

302
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,450
was his lover

303
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,690
a girl named Lou.

304
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,400
Somehow it
involving the eyes

305
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,540
and held the gaze

306
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,430
like a charm.

307
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,960
As he looked at me and

308
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,220
as a man who
living in hell.

309
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,500
His face covered
practically by the hair

310
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,030
and his look depressing.

311
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,880
I thought my day was over.

312
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,820
He looked at the green liquid
in your cup

313
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,890
and a drop fell, one by one.

314
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,110
And then he was alone

315
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,160
when the moon
terribly light.

316
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,370
I saw mountains and valleys

317
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,730
but silence is the same here.

318
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,110
And then suddenly

319
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,430
the music changed.

320
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,280
So soft that frightened
just listen to it

321
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,010
and feels his life is wiped

322
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,110
of all that once wanted.

323
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,510
They stole it from you.

324
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,080
The woman he loved, his
love was a lie of the devil

325
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,760
that God had forgotten her

326
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,120
and the best for you
was to shrink and die.

327
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,910
The heart cry of despair.

328
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,980
And kills you slowly.

329
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,750
I think not
can remain so.

330
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,810
So the danger is
out there in the world.

331
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,410
Nor have
a black dress.

332
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,280
Livingston, Montana, Day 5

333
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,450
Go down.

334
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,910
And do not slam the door.

335
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,260
Perfect.

336
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,690
I've thought of everything.

337
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,280
Let's live in the mountains.

338
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,290
Work the land.

339
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,380
- But stay away.
- It is far.

340
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,280
It's the best part of it.

341
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,050
You have to eat the food.

342
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,930
Eat.

343
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,710
Eat!

344
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,590
My grandmother always said,

345
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,720
Tonny, eat or anything
will not eat again.

346
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,360
Probably learned
with his English family.

347
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,030
- English?
- Yes.

348
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,440
And why are you here?

349
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,840
I'm not that bad.

350
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,400
See.

351
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,140
Thanks for dinner.

352
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,280
Yes

353
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,730
I have a gift for you.

354
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,740
Want me to put?

355
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,790
No, put in another finger.

356
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,860
At the other finger.

357
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,940
Yes

358
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,830
Yes

359
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,670
Beautiful.

360
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,020
I have to urinate.

361
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,180
911, what is your emergency?

362
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,700
- We are in Montana?

- Anne slut.

365
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,330
Tony says it is called,
I do not know his surname.

366
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,100
No, do not know.

367
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,990
I had never seen before.

368
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,430
Kidnapped me in a

369
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:18,060
Yes, guns and knives.

370
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,370
- Do you know where?
- In a cabin in the woods.

371
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,470
Where is he now?

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,680
Livingston, Montana, Day 5

375
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,380
Search in all files
by Tony or Anthony

376
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,160
that matches the description
our suspect.

377
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,170
How much time will come
someone to the hut?

378
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,310
Already there. My team
is the surrounding.

379
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,870
Apparently listen
voices inside.

380
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,830
- Come get some, right?
- Yes, they will.

381
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,980
- You have to save it.
- We do our best, ma'am.

382
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,410
... Peace and love

383
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,160
She left a message.

384
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,760
- How are there not?
- What?

385
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,870
- What was that?
- They are not there.

386
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,020
- But you said ...
- Yes, sorry.

387
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,620
- Were there.
- Sit far?

388
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,350
- Prometheus.
- Where were they?

389
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,560
- They promised that would bring.
- Sorry!

390
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,150
- I promised!
- But were not there.

391
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,420
They heard voices.
They said it was there.

392
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,170
Was there and left a message
saying they were heading north.

393
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,580
You are in Livingston,
know that, right?

394
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,360
- Calm down, Tom
- Not so simple.

395
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,540
I do not understand this,
yes it is very simple.

396
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,220
- Did you hear, go to the north.
- Wait a minute.

397
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,680
You take a long time.

398
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,720
We can not expect
things have resolved themselves, Dad.

399
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,590
- Stay calm.
- No, wait no more, Dad.

400
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,180
I will go alone!

401
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,860
- Mike!
- I care.

402
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,740
What are we doing here?

403
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,720
Just expect phone calls.

404
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,230
Anne is out. You are in Livingston
and we know it's there.

405
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,080
We are hoping e. ..
I'll bring it back.

406
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,960
- Tom, you have to stay calm.
- Me calm down?

407
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,350
We sit here day.
This is crazy!

408
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,300
- We must go after her!
- What are you doing?

409
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,580
- I'll look for my sister.
- The police are doing this.

410
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,410
So they are not doing
a good job, huh?

411
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,480
Lord Timbrook,
Please let me go.

412
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,230
- That does not help his family.
- This is not helping Anne.

413
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,050
You have to stay here with her parents!

414
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:52,570
Out of my way!

415
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,700
- Sorry.
- I understand.

416
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,700
Why do it?

417
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,110
Why?
Why call the police?

418
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,030
Just for you!

419
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,190
Eventually, I'll put a bullet
in your head right now.

420
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,310
Anthony Steven Wright is called.

421
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,640
Also known as Tony Zappa.

422
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,130
Arrested 20 times before 18.

423
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,950
And there were several orders of prison
due to assaults and injuries.

424
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:08,980
Mike recalls the incident of
Shopping in America last month?

425
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,890
- They closed the mall.
- Yes.

426
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,730
For a manhunt.
We were two months ago this guy.

427
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,680
Finally cornered him at the mall,

428
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,970
We had all access to
completely blocked entry and exit

429
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:22,980
yet escaped.

430
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,150
We are dealing here
Tony Zappa.

431
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,340
Was raised by his grandmother
in Minnesota.

432
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,890
Send someone to talk to her
and see what we can learn.

433
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,520
Meanwhile I'll fly
to Montana tonight.

434
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,560
- I'm with you.
- No, I better stay here.

435
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,610
- He has to go.
- We want Mike to be there.

436
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,290
I know this girl.
I know how to think.

437
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,530
Can I help you.

438
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,730
Need to be there.

439
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:02,190
Okay, the plane leaves in half
hours, please do not be late.

440
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,720
It is the grandmother of Tony Zappa?

441
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,810
Who cares?

442
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,550
We have to make some
questions about Tony.

443
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,300
Not deep enough.

444
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,590
Please do not kill me well.

445
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,820
Want to die?

446
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:19,140
- Please do not.
- Keep digging.

447
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:54,300
- Does not have to do this!
- Yes I am!

448
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,260
- Why?
- Because he lied to me!

449
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,570
- No, I lied!
- Yes, you lied!

450
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,770
He said he would go together
north.

451
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,040
We will!

452
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,190
I trusted you.

453
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,920
- So cava.
- Make yourself!

454
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,910
- Grab it!
- Or what? Kill me?

455
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,310
It is I who gives the orders.
Get it now!

456
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,320
Yes, I created it.

457
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,680
His father did not stop beating him.

458
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,570
I will not repeat.

459
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:33,310
I thought we understood.

460
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,270
Get up, stand up.

461
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,420
Tony, please do not kill me.

462
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,970
I will not kill you.

463
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,160
He loves his grandmother.

464
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,330
It is a good Christian.

465
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:38,230
No! Tony, please get off!

466
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:41,100
No! Please!

467
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,380
No, get off!
Please, Tony.

468
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,640
- No!
- Be quiet.

469
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,860
Please, please.

470
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,810
No. Please no.

471
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,990
Please!

472
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,130
Please, Tony. Stop.

473
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,030
Protect my daughter.

474
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,210
Deer Lodge, Montana, Day 6

475
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,720
Come on.

476
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:18,980
Wash out there.

477
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,640
Come on.

478
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:28,380
Go wash up.

479
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,550
Get dressed.

480
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,520
You are beautiful.

481
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,050
Be right back.

482
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,110
Stay there.

483
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,460
The fugitive manhunt
Anthony Steven Wright

484
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,270
also known as Tony Zappa.

485
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,300
Authorities are looking for
throughout the state of Montana

486
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,850
the student of Nebraska
disappeared on Friday afternoon.

487
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:16,670
The Slut appeared in public
the first time today

488
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,570
to go to the kidnapper.

489
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,360
Be who you are,

490
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:27,050
will do everything possible
to bring Anne home.

491
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,180
Please let her go.

492
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:35,230
Honey, I love you.

493
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:38,600
- Saudades.
- Mom.

494
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,310
Be strong.

495
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,520
We will not surrender.

496
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,200
- What was that?
- What?

497
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,210
I heard something.

498
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,200
Zappa is known by the FBI
as Jack Rabbit,

499
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,440
for his incredible ability to
escaping from police siege

500
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:11,540
in the central United States.

501
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:15,290
Zappa, kidnapped Slut
at Hilltop Mall.

502
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,460
See that? I am the Jack Rabbit.

503
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:20,610
He was seen driving a van
dark blue stolen

504
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:22,680
with Louisiana plates.

505
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,830
We need a new car.

506
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,540
Come on!

507
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:58,300
- Why?
- We need another car, come on.

508
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,070
No, I say, why me kidnapped?

509
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,160
Tired of being alone.

510
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:26,300
Laurel, Montana, Day 6

511
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,090
Put everything in the bag.

512
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,790
Let's take it.

513
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:06,110

01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:16,040

- Where?

515
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,310
Very good. The car was stolen
Louisiana Frank Larbert.

516
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:46,090
Was 80 and was a former policeman.

517
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:48,710
Zappa was right when the
stole the car.

518
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:52,990
- Frank died two days later.
- My God.

519
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,580
Take a look at this.

520
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,290
We are not far away.

521
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:42,610
Flathead Lake, near
Rollins, Montana, 16:15 H

522
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:29,210

Not now! Not now!

524
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:37,600
Damn!

525
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,000

01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,660
Come here. Come here now!

527
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,400
Lying, lying!

528
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,690
Look out the window, sees something?

529
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:37,130
- You see something?
- No, it's too dark.

530
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,630
- You lie!
- No.

531
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,030
Do not lie to me.

532
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:01,030
Delta team in place.
Confirm the location.

533
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,680

535
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,620
- You are surrounded.
- God!

536
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,400
God!

537
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,360
Do not shoot. It's a girl.

538
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,170
This is all your fault.
It's your fault.

539
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,980
Caught us.

540
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,880
I have not in sight.

541
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:27,360
Repeat. Without sight.

542
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,960
Let's call 911
and talk to them.

543
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:32,350
No, do not want to talk!
They want to kill me!

544
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:35,040
It's okay, we want to live.

545
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:38,810
Everything will be alright.

546
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:45,290
Is pointing to the girl.

547
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,750
- How far?
- Nearly one meter.

548
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:50,590
Have intercepted phone?

549
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,830
Yes, the cabin links
come straight here.

550
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:56,180
Not going back to prison.

551
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,760
I'll talk to them.

552
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,080
I'll call them.

553
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:10,140
... Surrounded.

554
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,260
Well done, Tony.

555
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,930
Careful what you'll say.

556
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:26,690
- Tony Zappa?
- No, I am.

557
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:29,770
Not the Zappa, is Anne.

558
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,480
- It's who's calling.
- What?

559
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:33,240
I know, this is new.

560
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:35,490
- The hostage making the connection.
- Let me talk to her.

561
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:37,990
- Mike, this is a case of the FBI.
- I know her.

562
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,060
So I brought it, right?

563
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:50,030
Caution, do not reveal who knows,
if Zappa is listening.

564
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:58,120
Here is Mike Timbrook.
I'm with the police.

565
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:05,180
- Hello, this is Anne.
- Anne, are you okay?

566
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:10,400
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Tony wants to see me?

567
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:14,860
Not sure.
Want to talk to you.

568
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,360
No, do not want to talk to them.

569
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:18,760
It's a trick, I want
close the window to get hit.

570
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:21,710
If I approached the bush, I swear!

571
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:29,460
I'm here.

572
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,640
Anne, we are here to meet
a viable solution for everyone.

573
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:39,050
Tell Tony that nobody
will shoot from cooperating.

574
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,910
Try, wait.

575
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,340
- They want to cooperate.
- I will not cooperate.

576
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:49,480
That was what my grandmother said.

577
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,720
I said: Whatever
tell you, Tony.

578
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,530
What do you think your grandmother
I would say at this point?

579
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:04,720
Anne, are you there?

580
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,150
Tony wants to talk to his grandmother.

581
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,640
Give us one minute
and pass the link.

582
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,700
What do you think you're doing?

583
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,550
This is not the policy of the FBI.

584
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:25,760
Every minute that this man should be
the phone, Anne will remain alive.

585
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:02,360
- Hello?
- Grandma?

586
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,120
Grandma, I am.

587
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:08,640
- Tony?
- Yes.

588
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,870
It's true what they say in
TV about you and that girl?

589
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,330
I'm afraid, grandmother.

590
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:21,530
Do not be afraid
Jesus, Tony.

591
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,710
I'll kill her.

592
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,970
Then I'll shoot myself.

593
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:35,140
Put the gun to my chest.

594
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:41,720
- I'll kill myself.
- Do not talk nonsense, not listen.

595
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,300
Strike team, get ready.

596
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:48,880
I'll pray for you.
Ask forgiveness from Jesus.

597
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,520
In the name of Jesus Christ,
our Lord,

598
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,990
prays that brings peace
and away the Satan.

599
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:02,230
Grandmother.

600
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:14,670
We have problems.

601
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:18,400
Shoot. Again, shoot
when possible.

602
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:23,150
First you and then me.

603
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,890
It's the only way.

604
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,560
It's the only way.

605
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:42,000
- What are you doing?
- Let's get out now.

606
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:45,030
Promise you will not hurt him.

607
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:52,380
If you shoot, will
to shoot us both.

608
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:11,430
Okay.

609
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:16,210
Tony Zappa, has 30 / 2
to free the girl

610
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:18,090
and surrender.

611
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,660
Tony has to get out now!

612
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,260
Okay.

613
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,330
Lay down your arms!

614
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,810
Listen to me.

615
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,350
I promise that nobody will shoot
you, but have 20 seconds

616
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,560
before the FBI assault.

617
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:47,690
And I can not stop them.

618
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,200
If I leave will shoot me.

619
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,160
Tony, nobody will shoot you!

620
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,830
Lower your weapons!

621
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,040
You have to throw the gun
for us and onto the floor.

622
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:34,080
Just do what
are saying. Will be well.

623
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:37,710
- Just do it.
- I'll put the gun down.

624
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:39,370
- Okay.
- Do not shoot me.

625
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,310
- Do not shoot me.
- Raise the arms in case ...

626
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:14,150
Do not shoot!

627
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:17,030
Do not shoot me!

628
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,800
You betrayed me!

629
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,260
You were fantastic.

630
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,860
Thank God.

631
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,700
I have something of yours.

632
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:59,570
He left it in some
place, girl?

633
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,110
Come on, let's go home.

634
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:11,620
Yes? Come here.

635
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:07,700
Thanks.
