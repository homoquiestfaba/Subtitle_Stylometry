1
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,164
Five thousand years ago...

2
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,334
a fierce warrior known
as the Scorpion King...

3
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,419
Ied a great army on a campaign...

4
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,421
to conquer the known world.

5
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,591
After a vicious campaign
which lasted seven long years...

6
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:16,344
the Scorpion King and his army
were defeated...

7
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:20,097
and driven deep into
the sacred desert of Ahm Shere.

8
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,373
One by one,
they slowly perished...

9
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,375
under the scorching sun...

10
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:53,089
until only the great warrior himself
was left alive.

11
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,223
Near death...

12
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:06,477
the Scorpion King made a pact
with the dark god Anubis...

13
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,230
that if Anubis
would spare his life...

14
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:11,941
and let him conquer his enemies...

15
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:14,652
he would give him his soul.

16
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,830
Anubis accepted his offer
and spared his life.

17
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,444
Anubis gave theScorpion King
command of his army...

18
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,324
and like an evil food,
they was hedaway...

19
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,701
all that lay before them.

20
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:16,297
When his task was done...

21
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,301
Anubis forced the Scorpion King
to serve him for all time.

22
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,270
His army was returned
to the sands from whence they came...

23
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:39,278
where they wait, silently...

24
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,614
to be awakened once again.

25
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,421
Alex?

26
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,341
What wereyou thinking,
a mummy had come back to life?

27
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,093
I'll tell you a story some time.

28
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,262
What are you doing down here?
I told you to wait for us in the temple.

29
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,139
- But, Dad, I saw--
- No "buts." It's dangerous down here.

30
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,934
- But I saw your tattoo.
- You saw what?

31
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,520
On a wall by the entrance.
There's a cartouche just like it.

32
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,939
With the pyramid and the eye...

33
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,858
and the two kings and everything.

34
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,860
- Really?
- Yeah.

35
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,988
Okay. Well, I'll be up to take
a look at that in a minute.

36
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,616
In the mean time, I want you
to wait for us up there.

37
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,618
Pick up your stuff,
and I'll see you up in the temple.

38
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,286
Go.

39
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,581
Go on.

40
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,625
And what should I do?

41
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,127
I don't know. Surprise me.

42
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,672
- Build a better mouse trap.
- Okay.

43
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,882
While your mother goes
and desecrates another tomb.

44
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,898
Go away.

45
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,571
- Those are poisonous, you know.
- Only if they bite you.

46
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,656
What was all that about?

47
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,409
Oh, nothing.
Alex wanted to show me something.

48
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,245
I swear...

49
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,747
the kid gets more and more
like you every day.

50
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,083
What, you mean
more attractive, sweet...

51
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,335
and devilishly charming?

52
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,921
No, he's driving me crazy.

53
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,756
Now, where were we?

54
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,759
Hammer and chisel.

55
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,683
All right, all right!
Let's do it your way.

56
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,185
Thank you.

57
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,080
Ever since I had that dream...

58
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,459
this place is all
I can think about.

59
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,754
Ever since you had that dream,
I haven't had a decent night of sleep.

60
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,841
I feel like I've been here before.

61
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,968
I know I've been here before.

62
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,263
Evy, nobody's been here before,
not in at least 3,000 years.

63
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,265
Except for these guys.

64
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,981
Then how do I seem to know
exactly where I'm going?

65
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,498
Let's go.

66
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,243
Knock, knock. Anybody home?

67
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,415
You two check out that stuff,
see if it's there.

68
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,377
I'll sort out the O'Connells.

69
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,764
You know, if you move that fast enough,
you can almost write your name.

70
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,600
I just had a vision.

71
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
It was like my dream...

72
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,980
but it was real.

73
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,482
It was like I was actually here
in ancient times.

74
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,026
Well, if you actually were here...

75
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,696
could you show me
how to open this thing?

76
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,197
Hold this.

77
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,175
- Now you're starting to scare me.
- I'm starting to scare myself.

78
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,179
What is this?
Look at the state of this rubbish.

79
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,431
The Egyptians never had a clue.
Look at that stuff.

80
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,893
It's all chintz and stuff.
Look at that.

81
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,688
Cheap pottery, this.
Ancient rubbish.

82
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,860
Jacques,
something's hit me head!

83
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,028
Shut up, Spivey.

84
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,863
This place is cursed.

85
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,785
We don't want to wake the gods.

86
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,893
That's the emblem
of the Scorpion King.

87
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,396
He's supposed to be pure myth.

88
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,399
No trace of him has ever been
found before. No artifacts.

89
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,401
No archival evidence.

90
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,487
Maybe they didn't want
any body to find him.

91
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,531
- Let's open this.
- Evy, I don't know.

92
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,659
-I don't have a good feeling about this.
-It's only a chest.

93
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,744
No harm ever came
from opening a chest.

94
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,038
Right, and no harm ever came
from reading a book.

95
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,916
- Remember how that one went?
- Come on. We can't stop now.

96
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,252
Just remember,
I was the voice of reason here.

97
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,378
For once.

98
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,296
Rubbish.

99
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,590
Dreck. Chintz.

100
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,425
Only half of this--

101
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,098
God, that hurt!

102
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,453
Hon? Let's do it your way.

103
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,308
The bracelet of Anubis.

104
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,610
I'll take care of this.

105
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,451
Oh, my God

106
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,329
It's a bit late for that!

107
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,665
- Put it in your rucksack.
- Let's leave it here.

108
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,293
- It's a bit late for that!
- What's it say?

109
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,254
"He who disturbs this bracelet...

110
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,465
shall drink from the Nile."

111
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,258
That doesn't sound too bad.

112
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,864
Jacques is gonna make
a nice fillet out of you, my son.

113
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,659
Oh, please.

114
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,662
Spivey! Jacques!
Let's get the hell out of here!

115
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,498
Come on.

116
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,352
This is bad, Evy.

117
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,605
- We've had bad before.
- This is worse.

118
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,437
Mom? Dad?

119
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,981
I can explain everything.

120
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,845
The Book of the Dead gives life.

121
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,848
And the Book of the Living...

122
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,853
takes life away.

123
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,855
I thought that was my job.

124
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,693
We're getting close.

125
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,058
Did you acquire it?

126
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,422
We're getting very close.

127
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,273
We found him.

128
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,069
We found him! We found him!

129
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,297
Step aside there.
Out of the way.

130
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,179
Imhotep.

131
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,181
It's him. It's lmhotep.

132
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,563
Now we must raise
those that serve him.

133
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,857
Get out of my way.
Get out of the way.

134
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,484
Get out of my way
or I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

135
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,987
He means it.
He shot someone before.

136
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,363
Give it to me.

137
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,492
The opportunity passed us by.

138
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,246
- We need that bracelet.
- We need it before it opens.

139
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,044
Enough.

140
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,715
My dear Hafez...

141
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,718
I told you
I should have handled it.

142
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,930
I did not want
your past history...

143
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,640
to cloud the issue.

144
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,017
Don't worry. We know where it is.
We'll take care of it.

145
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,686
No, we'll take care of it.

146
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,564
I have a different chore
for you now.

147
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,691
Where is the bracelet?

148
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,527
It's on its way
to merry old London.

149
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,781
Then London is where we must go.

150
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,051
I think the bracelet
is some sort of guide...

151
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,220
to the lost oasis of Ahm Shere.

152
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,973
Evy, I know what you're thinking...

153
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,766
and the answer's no.

154
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,810
We just got home.

155
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,313
That's the beauty ofit.
We're already packed.

156
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:57,567
Why don't you just give me
one good reason?

157
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,652
It's just an oasis...

158
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,030
darling.

159
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,117
A beautiful...

160
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,618
exciting...

161
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,288
romantic...

162
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,959
oasis.

163
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:19,172
The kind with the white, sandy beach
and the palm trees...

164
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,257
and the cool, clear, blue water?

165
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,887
We could have some of those big drinks
with the little umbrellas.

166
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:30,141
- Sounds good.
- Sounds too good. What's the catch?

167
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,810
Supposedly it's the resting place
of Anubis's army.

168
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:35,354
You see? I knew there's a catch.
There's always a catch.

169
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,356
How did I know that?
And let me guess.

170
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,067
It was commanded
by that Scorpion King guy?

171
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,820
Yes, but he only awakens
once every 5,000 years.

172
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,823
And if someone doesn't kill him,
he's gonna wipe out the world.

173
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:48,868
- How did you know?
- I didn't, but that's always the story.

174
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,871
The last known expedition
to actually reach Ahm Shere...

175
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,708
was sent by Ramses the Fourth
over 3,000 years ago.

176
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,669
- He sent over a thousand men.
- None of them was ever seen again.

177
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,755
- How did you know?
- I didn't, but that's always the story.

178
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,007
- Did I mention the pyramid of gold?
- Twice.

179
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,384
Alexander the Great
sent troops in search of it.

180
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,386
- Hooray for him.
- So did Caesar.

181
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,430
- Look what happened to his career.
- And Napoleon.

182
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,807
Yeah, but we're smarter than him.

183
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,476
- Taller too.
- Exactly.

184
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,604
- That's why we're gonna find it.
- Because we're taller?

185
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:21,067
- That's why I loveyou.
- Nice try.

186
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,506
Mom!

187
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,675
What do I do with this chest?

188
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,677
Sucker weighs a god dang ton.

189
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,929
Alex, watch your language.

190
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,597
Rather weighty, this.

191
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,403
Evy, that first weird dream of yours
was exactly six weeks ago, right?

192
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,530
Yes, but what's that
got to do with anything?

193
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,285
It just happens to coincide
with Egyptian New Year.

194
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,330
That's right.
What a coincidence.

195
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,542
Maybe.

196
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,086
All I'm saying
is let's be cautious.

197
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:34,390
If anything happened to you,
I would never forgive myself.

198
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,622
You and Alex are the only thing
that matter to me.

199
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,123
Well...

200
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,753
the Bembridge scholars
have been begging me...

201
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,214
to run the British Museum.

202
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,067
Cripes, how do you get
this thing off?

203
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,069
Have I kissed you today?

204
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,539
I hate it when you do that.

205
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,998
Why?

206
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:44,126
- Makes me agree to anything.
- Anything?

207
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,260
Those knickers are not mine.

208
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,888
Jonathan.

209
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,349
Alex, behave yourself
for five minutes, all right?

210
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,685
You betcha.

211
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,822
- Happy to be home?
- Couldn't be happier.

212
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,366
It's the Year of the Scorpion.

213
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,410
- Neat.
- Thought you might like that.

214
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,789
So I killed the mummy and his minions
and stole his scepter.

215
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:23,833
Oh, you're so brave.

216
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,877
And rich.
Did I mention rich?

217
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,254
What do you think I'm doing here?

218
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,135
- Sorry, we must be in the wrong house.
- You said this was your house.

219
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,720
- I didn't.
- Call me!

220
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:40,057
- You're not Sheila's husband?
- No.

221
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,769
If you work for Johnny,
I was gonna pay him back on Tuesday.

222
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,063
I don't know any Johnny.

223
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,482
We are looking for
the bracelet of Anubis.

224
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,319
Oh, good for you. Good thing to have,
the old bracelet of Anubis.

225
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,070
Where is it?

226
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,907
Ah, you're looking here
for the bracelet. I see.

227
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,326
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

228
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:01,454
Mr. O'Connell,
you try my patience.

229
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:05,082
Mr. O'Connell? Hold on a minute.
You've got the wrong ma--

230
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,792
That bracelet.
Now I remember.

231
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:10,129
- I lost it in a card game.
- For your sake, I hope not.

232
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,178
It can't be.

233
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:26,646
- Where's your wife?
- My wife?

234
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,105
You mean Evy.

235
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,359
I think she went off to Baden-Baden
orTibet or something.

236
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,737
The girl's a free spirit.
Did I mention I was single now?

237
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,663
Egyptian asps
are quite poisonous.

238
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,207
It's downstairs.

239
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:52,004
There's a safe.
The combination is 3-20-58.

240
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,422
393-something.

241
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,424
It's in the safe downstairs.

242
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,093
I told you!

243
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,761
And your point is?

244
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:02,431
- I told you so you wouldn't kill me.
- When did we make that arrangement?

245
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,862
Jonathan, I thought I said
no more wild parties.

246
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,156
Well, when you're popular--

247
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:21,492
I'm serious. If you've lost
that key, you're grounded.

248
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:24,620
I haven't lost it. I just can't find it.
There's a difference.

249
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,498
Well, you better
start finding it then.

250
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:30,001
I will, Mom.
There's nothing to worry about.

251
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,795
Good evening.

252
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,967
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

253
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,428
I'm looking for the chest,
of course.

254
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,056
Give it to me now.

255
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,021
Get out of my house.

256
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,272
Whoa, Mom.

257
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,733
- Maybe not the best idea.
- Alex, get back there.

258
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,989
Definitely not the best idea.

259
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:02,366
I think it's time
to yell for Dad now.

260
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,411
- I will kill you and take it anyway.
- I think not.

261
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,666
Ardeth.
What are you doing here?

262
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,710
Perhaps explanations
are best kept for later.

263
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,378
Ardeth Bay.

264
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,506
Lock-Nah.

265
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,674
Hey, folks,
knowing my brother-in-law...

266
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,927
he probably deserves whatever
you're about to do to him...

267
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,386
but this is my house.

268
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,555
I have certain rules
about snakes and dismemberment.

269
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,478
Shoot him!

270
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,466
Whoa, Mom!

271
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,177
- Where did you learn to do that?
- I have no idea.

272
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,476
That I learned from your father.

273
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,730
I'll take that.

274
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,951
Not bad for a Medjai.

275
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,168
Let go!

276
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,013
- What's in the chest?
- The bracelet of Anubis!

277
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,405
They must not get the bracelet.

278
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,282
Get it and get out of here!

279
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,873
Mom, look out!

280
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:15,833
Evelyn!

281
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,188
What'd you do this time?

282
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,482
I haven't done anything
to anybody.

283
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,860
- Lately.
- Come on!

284
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:06,509
Rick!

285
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,345
Look out, Rick!

286
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,565
Dad! Dad!

287
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,110
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

288
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:32,243
What the hell are you doing here?
Scratch that. I don't care.

289
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,453
Who are those guys
and where are they taking my wife?

290
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:37,456
My friend, I'm not sure...

291
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,041
but wherever this man is...

292
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,544
your wife will surely be.

293
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,965
Hey, I know him.
He's the curator.

294
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,551
- He works at the British Museum.
- Are you sure?

295
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,596
Better believe him. He spends more
time there than he does at home.

296
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,392
Okay, you're here.
The bad guys are here.

297
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,477
Evy's been kidnapped.
Let me guess.

298
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,563
They once again removed
the creature from his grave.

299
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:03,900
Not to point fingers, but isn't it your
job to make sure that doesn't happen?

300
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:07,361
That woman with him knew things
no living person could possibly know.

301
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:09,906
She knew exactly where
the creature was buried.

302
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:13,117
We hoped she would lead us to
the bracelet. She obviously did.

303
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:14,785
Now they have it.

304
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,788
I wouldn't get
too nervous just yet.

305
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:20,750
Is that gold?

306
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,793
When I stuck it on,
I saw the pyramids at Giza.

307
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,922
Then whoosh-- straight across
the desert to Karnak.

308
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,966
You have started a chain reaction that
could bring about the next apocalypse.

309
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,637
You, lighten up.
You, big trouble.

310
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,639
You, get in the car.

311
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,606
I am sorry if alarmed your son,
but you must understand.

312
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:47,610
Now that the bracelet's on, we have
7 days before the Scorpion King awakens.

313
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,111
We? What we?

314
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:51,906
If he is not killed,
he will raise the Army of Anubis.

315
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,992
- I take it that's not a good thing.
- Oh, he'll wipe out the world.

316
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,328
The old "wipe out the world" ploy.

317
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,459
Whom ever can kill
the Scorpion King...

318
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:05,503
can send his army back
to the Underworld...

319
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:08,297
or use it to destroy man kind
and rule the Earth.

320
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:12,552
They dug up lmhotep 'cause he's tough
enough to take out the Scorpion King.

321
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:13,803
That is their plan.

322
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:30,069
Alex, I got a big job for you.
Stay here and protect the car.

323
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,488
- I could do that.
- Protect the car?

324
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,533
Come on. Just because I'm a kid
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

325
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,743
- I know.
- Dad!

326
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:41,706
If you see anyone come running out
screaming, it's just me.

327
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:44,250
Maybe you should stay here
and watch him.

328
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,710
Now you're talking.

329
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,758
- You want the shotgun?
- No, I prefer the Thompson.

330
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:03,895
If l were to say to you, I'm a stranger
traveling from the east...

331
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,897
seeking that which is lost--

332
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,608
Then I would reply that I am
a stranger traveling from the west.

333
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,277
- It is I whom you seek.
- Then it is true.

334
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,405
- You have the sacred mark.
- What, that?

335
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,949
That got slapped on me
in an orphanage in Cairo.

336
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,535
That mark means
you're a protector of man...

337
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,622
a warrior for God, a Medjai.

338
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:25,583
Sorry.
You've got the wrong guy.

339
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,587
Mr. Hafez.

340
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,469
They found him.

341
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,191
Imhotep.

342
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:32,770
Do not be frightened.

343
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:35,231
I am not afraid.

344
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,636
You know...

345
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,266
a couple of years ago, this would've
seemed really strange to me.

346
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,940
Lord lmhotep will be much pleased.

347
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,827
Where is it?

348
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,829
Where is the bracelet?

349
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:35,208
I think I know.

350
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:39,545
At the very top of the gold pyramid,
there was a huge diamond.

351
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:41,005
How huge?

352
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:44,008
It was so big,
it would refect the sun...

353
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,344
and wink at distant travelers...

354
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:49,305
beckoning them to their deaths.

355
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,702
Get off. Get off.

356
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:16,916
Oh, my God.

357
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:19,502
You wait!

358
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:22,171
I'll put you in your grave again.

359
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:25,258
Our thinking was, not if we
put you in your grave first.

360
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:28,261
Burn her!

361
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:29,470
You bast--

362
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:46,362
- Open it! Open it!
- I'm trying!

363
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:10,094
- Hurry up!
- Come on, come on!

364
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,222
- You broke it!
- Be quiet!

365
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:16,267
If there's gonna be any hysterics,
they'll come from me!

366
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:01,646
Go, go, go, go! Go!
