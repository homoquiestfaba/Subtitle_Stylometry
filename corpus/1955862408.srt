00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,293
KISS ME.

4
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:06,560
NO.

5
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,862
KISS ME! NOW.

[muffled protests]

8
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,895
SHE MUST BE SOME GIRL.

9
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,677
TELL HER SHE'S LUCKY...

10
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,380
WHOEVER SHE IS.

(Sergio)
THE "LUCKY" GIRL'S NAME
WAS HATTIE.

13
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,334
ONLY SHE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT SHE WAS ALL THAT LUCKY.

14
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,036
'CAUSE, YOU SEE, TO HATTIE,
WE WERE JUST FRIENDS.

15
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,606
BUT TO ME, SHE WAS, WELL--
SHE WAS MORE.

16
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,873
MUCH MORE.

17
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:04,545
AND IF I HAD MY WAY,
SOMEDAY SHE WOULD BE MINE.

18
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,314
(woman)
SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

19
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,449
[male voice straining]

SAY YOU'RE SORRY!

20
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,517
[straining]
(woman)
SHE'S KILLING HIM.

21
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,651
WHAT'D HE SAY?

22
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,853
[man straining unintelligibly]

23
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,888
IT'S GOOD HE'S SORRY.
[coughs]

24
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,957

WONDERFUL!

25
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,991
AAH!

26
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:18,992
NOW THAT THAT'S
ALL OVER WITH,

27
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,995
BREAKFAST IS ON THE HOUSE.

28
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,464
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

29
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,732
I'M A GOOD PATRON
OF THIS PLACE.

30
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,434
NEVER HAVE I BEEN TREATED
LIKE THIS!

31
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,837
YOU CAN EXPECT TO HEAR
FROM MY LAWYER.

32
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,971
YEAH, WELL YOU CAN TELL HIM
FROM ME

33
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,005
THAT PINCHING MY ASS
ISN'T ON THE MENU.

34
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,374
(woman)
DID YOU PINCH HER ASS?

35
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,542
(man)
WHAT? NO.
DID YOU PINCH HER ASS?

36
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,410
NO. NO.
YOU PINCHED HER ASS!

37
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:37,745
HOWARD,
YOU PINCHED HER ASS!

38
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,480
[couple leave arguing]

39
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,751
PLEASE.
YOU NEED TO BE
IN THERAPY.

40
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,687
YOU'RE A PIG.
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH YOU.

41
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,723
HEY!
HEY, MISTER!

HEY.
AAH!

44
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,362
DON'T BE AFRAID, LADY,
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

45
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,563
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

46
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,631
HERE, YOU DROPPED YOUR WALLET
BACK OVER THERE.

47
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,733
COUNT IT, HOWARD.
THESE PEOPLE ARE THIEVES.

48
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:00,901
THEY'RE THIEVES.
COUNT IT!

49
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:01,969
COUNT THE MONEY.

50
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,004
VICKI, SHUT UP!

51
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,873
THANKS.

52
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,608
HATTIE'S SOMETHING ELSE,
ISN'T SHE?

53
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,610
SHE'S GOT A REAL FLAIR
FOR THE WAY SHE FEELS.

54
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,479
YEAH, SHE'S GOT A FLAIR,
ALL RIGHT--A REAL FLAIR.

55
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,748
STOP TALKING TO HIM.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

56
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,584
[engine starts]

57
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,486
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER NOT TO LET
HER GRAB YOU BY THE COLLAR,

58
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,987
'CAUSE IF YOU SLIP HER,
YOU CAN GET IT.

59
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,054
BUT IF SHE GETS YOU
BY THE COLLAR,

60
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:24,124
SHE'S GOT YOU
AND YOU GOTTA GIVE.

61
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,459
I'M GONNA MARRY HER.

62
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,695
YEAH?
YEAH. YEAH.

63
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,829
WELL, LET ME GIVE YOU
A LITTLE ADVICE.

64
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,432
DON'T WEAR A TIE
TO THE WEDDING.

65
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,133
[chuckles]
ALL RIGHT.

66
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,402
CLOSE THE WINDOW.

67
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,669
OKAY. SEE YA.

68
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,429
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

69
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,600
UH, MR. LINZER,
I'M GONNA GO NOW.

70
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,034
ANYTHING YOU NEED?

71
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,470
NO. GO, GO.

72
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,539
HOW COME YOU DON'T COME
TO OUR HOUSE

73
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:46,640
FOR DINNER ANYMORE,
SERGIO?

74
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:47,808
YOU MAD AT US?

75
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,578
I'LL COME.

76
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:51,912
YOU SAY YOU'LL COME,
BUT YOU DON'T COME.

77
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:52,746
I WILL.

78
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,548
YOU SAY YOU WILL,
BUT YOU DON'T COME.

79
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,850
LEAVE THE BOY ALONE.

80
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,051
LOOK AT THE LOOK
ON HIS FACE.

81
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,620
CUPID DANCES
ON HIS EYELIDS.

82
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,589
HA.

83
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,024
I'LL COME.

84
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,759
I WILL.

85
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,163
[bells on door jingle]

86
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:20,073
DO YOU REMEMBER BEING
IN LOVE LIKE THAT?

87
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:32,252
MAN, OH, MAN,
HAVE I GOT A STORY

88
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,854
OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
LAST NIGHT.

89
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,490
I WAS JUST MOPPING--
MOP, MOP, MOP--

90
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:38,492
WHEN THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
COMES INTO THE STORE,

91
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,260
AND SHE'S DRESSED RICH,
BUT NICE.

92
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,962
AND I SAY,
"LOOK, WE'RE CLOSED."

93
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,631
BUT SHE DOESN'T MOVE.
SHE JUST STAYS RIGHT THERE.

94
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,132
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WEREN'T DREAMING?

95
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,767
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT,

96
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,503
SO I BIT MYSELF
AND IT HURT.

97
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:52,172
YOU'RE LUCKY, SERGIO.
THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU.

98
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,207
NOTHING EVER HAPPENS TO ME.

99
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,709
BUT I'M GONNA CHANGE
ALL THAT.

100
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,044
OH, YEAH?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

101
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,912
I'M GONNA GO
AND SEE THE WORLD.

102
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,814
YOU'RE GONNA GO SEE
THE WORLD?
YEAH.

103
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,115
WHERE YOU GONNA GO?

104
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,817
I DON'T KNOW,
FRANCE MAYBE,

105
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,653
OR ITALY, OR AFRICA.

106
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,588
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE
DIFFERENT PLACES FOR A CHANGE?

107
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,922
I DON'T KNOW.
I LIKE IT HERE.

108
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,091
SEE, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ME AND YOU.

109
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,226
I HAVE ASPIRATIONS.

110
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,062
I'M SAVING MY MONEY
TO SEE THE WORLD,

111
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,196
AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
A DIME.

112
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,933
BUT I'M GONNA BE MANAGER
OF LINZER'S SOMEDAY, YOU KNOW.

113
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,234
I'M GONNA HAVE PLENTY
OF MONEY THEN.

114
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,236
YEAH, "SOMEDAY."

115
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,138
WHO NEEDS MONEY, ANYWAY?

116
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,206
EVERYBODY NEEDS MONEY.

117
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,542
YOU GOTTA HAVE MONEY
TO GO PLACES,

118
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,578
TO SEE DIFFERENT
NEW THINGS.

119
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,313

120
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,049
(Sergio)
I CAN'T, I'M S--

00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,818
NO, I--TOMORROW.

122
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,187
TOMORROW, ALL RIGHT?
TOMORROW.

123
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,255
HATTIE.

124
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,694
WHAT IF--
WHAT IF I SAVE MY MONEY?

125
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:47,795
COULD I GO WITH YOU?

126
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,163
YOU WANT TO SEE THE WORLD
WITH ME?

127
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,666
YEAH.
COULD I GO?

128
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,202
YEAH.
YEAH, IF YOU WANT TO.

129
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,604
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.

130
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,572
THAT DOES IT.
THAT DOES IT.

131
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,776
TOMORROW I'M MARCHING DOWN
TO MR. LINZER,

132
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,311
AND I'M DEMANDING
TO BE MADE MANAGER.

133
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,313
YOU SEE?
THAT'S ASPIRATION.

134
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,782
BUT YOU BETTER HURRY 'CAUSE
I'M NOT WAITING FOREVER.

135
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:11,151
SIR, COME ON,
GIVE ME A BREAK.

136
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,653
GET OFF MY CAR.

137
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,021
HEY, I'M SORRY.
I'M GOING WITH HATTIE.

138
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,322
I'M SORRY. THANK YOU.

139
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,924
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

140
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:17,991
SO, UM...

141
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,893
WHAT ARE YOU--WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING TO DO FIRST?

142
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,261
I MEAN, YOU GOT A LOT
OF DREAMS, DON'T YOU?

143
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,663
YEAH.

144
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,964
WHAT'S THE FIRST ORDER
OF BUSINESS?

145
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,065
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

146
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,901
[conversation fades]

147
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,165
[paper tears]

148
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:11,311
MR. LINZER, CAN I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU?

149
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,848
MR. LINZER.

150
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,083
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

151
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,286
DROP IT.

152
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,288
MR. LINZER,
WE'RE LIKE FAMILY.

153
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,690
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

154
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,725
[sighs]

155
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,660
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

156
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:27,928
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

157
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,798
YOU CARE FOR OTHER PEOPLE,
LIKE YOUR FATHER.

158
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,265
GOD REST HIS SOUL.

159
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,001
TIMES ARE BAD.

160
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,969
THIS PLACE IS DOING
VERY BAD.

161
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,404
I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA
LOSE THIS PLACE

162
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,405
TO THE BILL COLLECTORS.

163
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,207
NO.
MM.

164
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,342
I DON'T MIND HAVING NOTHING.
I AM A MAN.

165
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,077
BUT MRS. LINZER...

166
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:47,815
I CAN'T WATCH HER LIVE
LIKE A DOG.

167
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:51,151
NO, I LOVE HER MORE
THAN THE AIR I BREATHE.

168
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,986
I WOULD RATHER DIE

169
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,455
THAN TO TELL HER I COULD NOT
PROVIDE FOR HER.

170
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,760
BUT YOU DO PROVIDE.
YOU PROVIDE HER WITH EVERYTHING.

171
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:03,330
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE...

172
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:08,001
TO LOVE SOMEONE SO MUCH...

173
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,171
YOU WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR THEM?

174
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,041
I DO.

175
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,276
YOU DO.

176
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,012
BURN THIS PLACE!

177
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,247
BURN?

178
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,182
IF THERE WERE A FIRE--
A SMALL FIRE--

179
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,316
THE INSURANCE
WOULD SAVE ME.

180
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,385
YOU WANT ME TO BURN
THIS PLACE?

181
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,386
NOT A BIG FIRE.

182
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,821
A SMALL FIRE.
A STRONG FIRE.

183
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:28,822
A GOOD FIRE.

184
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:32,860
JUST ENOUGH TO BURN EVERYTHING
TO THE GROUND.

185
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,199
SERGIO...

186
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,370
I'M DESPERATE.

187
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,505
I'M SIMPLY DESPERATE.

188
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,174
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.

189
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,009
BUT THIS IS--THIS IS
YOUR LIFE, MR. LINZER.

190
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,044
EVERYTHING THAT YOU
WORK FOR

191
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,179
IS BUILT AROUND YOU
RIGHT NOW.

192
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,446
YOU CAN'T JUST
BURN IT DOWN.

193
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,083
IT'S LIKE A MEMBER
OF YOUR FAMILY, MR. LINZER.

194
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,019
LOOK--LOOK AT THE OVENS
IN THE KITCHEN, HUH?

195
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,287
AND HOW 'BOUT THESE WALLS?

196
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,222
W-WHAT ABOUT THE WINDOWS

197
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,891
AND THESE BEATEN UP
WOODEN FLOORS?

198
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:07,194
MR. LINZER, LOOK,
IT'S LIKE A PART OF YOU.

199
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,496
IF YOU BURN THIS DOWN,
IT'S GONNA BE GONE.

200
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,965
YES, I DO LOVE
THIS PLACE. YES.

201
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,500
THEN YOU'LL FIND A WAY
OF PAYING THE BILLS.

202
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,935
YOU'VE HAD HARD TIMES
BEFORE.

203
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,437
OH, SERGIO...

204
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,773
SERGIO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

205
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,842
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PAY ME RIGHT AWAY.

206
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,376
OH, NO, NO, NO.

207
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,146
I WANT YOU TO BE PAID.
[register rings]

208
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,481
HERE...

209
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,150
TAKE IT.

210
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,293
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA BURN
THIS PLACE DOWN?

211
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,867
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

212
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,505
OKAY.

213
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,175
OKAY.

214
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,478
SERGIO, I PRAY
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO YOU,

215
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,248
BUT IT HAPPENS
TO EVERY MAN.

216
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:05,385
YOU WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN TWO THINGS YOU LOVE.

217
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:09,022
ALL I LOVE IS HATTIE.

218
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,831
[sighs]
SO...

219
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,833
YOU SAID YOU'D ASK.

220
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,235
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY
RIGHT NOW.

221
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:26,039
I SAID I'D WAIT,
BUT NOT FOREVER.

222
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,374
SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY.

223
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,977
YOU KNOW, I'M SAVING
EVERY PENNY I GOT,

224
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,979
BUT AT THIS PACE
I'M GONNA BE AT LEAST 110

225
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,247
BY THE TIME I HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY.

226
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,183
AND BY THEN
HATTIE'S GONNA BE IN FRANCE...

227
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,051
WITH SOME FRENCH GUY.

228
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,152
YOU KNOW, TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH,

229
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,888
I LIKE YOU, SERGIO.

230
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,390
YOU'RE NO RICHIE RICH,
BUT YOU GOT A GOOD HEART.

231
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,425
IF IT WERE UP TO ME,
I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM

232
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,094
WITH THE TWO OF YOU
GETTING TOGETHER.

233
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:50,097
BUT SHE'S GOT THIS IDEA
ABOUT SEEING THE WORLD.

234
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,066
SO I TELL HER, "HATTIE,
WATCH NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.

235
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,134
SAVE YOUR MONEY."

236
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,238
(Sergio)
I WOULD NOT GIVE UP.

237
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,408
I WORKED, AND I SAVED,
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT HATTIE.

238
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,878
EVERY DAY MY LOVE FOR HER
JUST GREW MORE

239
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,180
AND MORE AND MORE

240
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:10,383
UNTIL SOMETIMES I WOULD FORGET
TO BREATHE.

241
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,119
[thud]

242
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,121
HE FORGOT TO BREATHE AGAIN.

243
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,456
HMM.

244
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,658
(Sergio)
I KNOW THIS MAY
SOUND STRANGE,

245
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,528
BUT I PICTURED US
AND THE PLACES WE WOULD GO.

246
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,198
IT DIDN'T MATTER TO ME
IF IT WERE LONDON, OR PARIS,

247
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:28,201
OR FRANCE, OR SOME HOT,
SWEATY JUNGLE SOMEWHERE.

248
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,904
YOU SEE, THE FEELING WAS
ALWAYS THE SAME

249
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:34,474
BECAUSE I WAS WITH HATTIE
AND SHE WAS WITH ME.

250
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:38,511
WELL, LOOKING BACK NOW,
IT WAS ALL SO SIMPLE THEN.

251
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,280
AND THAT'S WHEN IT ALL
WENT WRONG.

252
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,916
[sirens blaring]

253
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,286
[dispatch radio droning]
[overlapping orders]

254
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,131
[firemen shouting
indistinctly]

255
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,500
(fireman)
GET IN THERE.
RIGHT THERE.

256
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:27,060
SERGIO. SERGIO.

257
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,329
THANK GOD.

258
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,398
THANK GOD YOU ARE OKAY.

259
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,665
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

260
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,034
I'M--I'M FINE.
I'M OKAY.

261
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,602
SERGIO.

262
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,653
HEY!

263
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,457
IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOU?

264
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,159
PLEASE, HATTIE, PLEASE.

265
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,460
RIGHT NOW I GOT
A LOT OF THOUGHTS

266
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,529
FLYING THROUGH MY HEAD,
OKAY?

267
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,132
MR. LINZER IS WATCHING HIS LIFE
GO UP IN FLAMES.

268
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,399
WHAT COULD BE WORSE
THAN THAT?

269
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,469
THINGS.

270
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,338
THINGS THAT YOU'LL
NEVER KNOW.

271
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,606
THINGS?
YES, THINGS.

272
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,677
LIKE WHAT COULD BE
SO SPECIAL?

273
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,347
LIKE...

274
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:26,486
I DON'T HAVE A JOB.

275
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,289
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO SELFISH?

276
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,790
SELFISH?

277
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,259
EVERYBODY ELSE IS
AROUND HERE.

278
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,061
NOBODY'S THINKING
OF SERGIO CUCHO,

279
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,562
AND WHERE'S SERGIO
GONNA SLEEP TOMORROW,

280
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,364
OR HOW SERGIO
GONNA EAT TOMORROW.

281
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,799
AND IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
I'M NOT RICHIE RICH.

282
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,469
THAT PLACE WAS EVERYTHING
I HAD, HATTIE.

283
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,803
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

284
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,273
FROM NOW ON,
I'M JUST GONNA THINK OF ME.

285
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,176
SERGIO CUCHO, ME.

286
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,184
[distant siren]

287
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,342
[broken glass tinkles]

288
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,237
[door opens, bell jingles]

289
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,173
OH, SORRY, I--

290
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,774
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SURPRISE YOU.

291
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,711
FIRES MAKE PEOPLE
JUMPY, HUH?

292
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,180
[chuckles]

293
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,316
UH...ARE YOU THE OWNER?

294
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,252
NO, I JUST WORK HERE.

295
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,154
I MEAN,
I USED TO WORK HERE.

296
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,423
YEAH, YEAH.

297
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,492
WHO ARE YOU?

298
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,295
UH, I'M JUST A GUY
WHO LIKES FIRE, THAT'S ALL.

299
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,095
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE LATE.

300
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:19,566
YOU SHOULDA BEEN HERE
YESTERDAY.

301
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,568
I'M JERRY FITZPATRICK.

302
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,436
NICE MEETING YOU.

303
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,871
OH, UM, I'M SORRY.

304
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,307
OH. OH, BOY.

305
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,209
ARE YOU
WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT?

306
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,610
UH, NO, NO.

307
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,413
NO, I'M NOT.
JEEZ.

308
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,847
WH--WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

309
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,349
SERGIO.
AND I DON'T--

310
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,717
I DON'T KNOW
WHO STARTED THE FIRE.

311
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,387
I DIDN'T SAY YOU KNEW
WHO STARTED THE FIRE.

312
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,554
YEAH, BUT YOU
WERE THINKING IT.

313
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,323
I WAS THINKING
NO SUCH THING.

314
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,557
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

315
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:45,892
WHAT I WAS THINKING WAS,

316
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,827
"THAT KID LOOKS LIKE
AN HONEST KID."

317
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,596
YEAH. YEAH.
[loud clatter]

318
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,698
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

319
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,266
GOOD. GOOD.

320
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,203
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

321
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,338
[sighs]

322
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:01,941
WANNA GO FOR A RIDE?

323
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,443
HUH?

324
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,911
FEEL LIKE TAKING
A RIDE SOMEWHERE?

325
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:08,215
THIS--THIS AIR WE'RE BREATHING,
IT'S NOT VERY GOOD FOR YOU.

326
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,583
IT'S, UH--
IT'S HURTING MY LUNGS.

327
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,419
I USED TO HAVE ASTHMA
AS A KID.

328
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,553
YEAH.

329
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,389
WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL
WE'RE BREATHING IN HERE, HUH?

330
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:20,193
(Sergio)
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
THAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING?

331
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,861
(Fitzpatrick)
I WORK FOR MR. LUMPKE.

332
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,463
DRUGS?

333
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,931
[chuckles]

334
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,967
MR. LUMPKE MAKES WIGS.

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,702
WHAT, WIGS LIKE IN HAIR?

336
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,639
HAIR FOR WOMEN.
TOUPEE FOR MEN.

337
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,808
SEE THIS HAIR I HAVE
ON TOP OF MY HEAD?

338
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:36,976
YEAH.

339
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,446
ONE OF THE FINEST TOUPEES
MADE TODAY.

340
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,414
THAT'S NOT YOUR HAIR?

341
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,816
[chuckles]
AMAZING, ISN'T IT, HUH?

342
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,618
YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A LIVING
DOING THAT?

343
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,887
A VERY GOOD LIVING.

344
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,458
HAIRLESSNESS IS A SCOURGE
THAT MUST BE STOPPED.

345
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:54,394
(Sergio)
JERRY SEEMED
LIKE A NICE ENOUGH MAN,

346
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,263
AND SO I TOLD HIM
ABOUT ME AND HATTIE.

347
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,964
THAT NOW SINCE
I HAD NO JOB,

348
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,800
I HAD NO CHANCE
OF GOING AWAY WITH HER.

349
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,604
JERRY SAID HE KNEW
ABOUT A JOB.

350
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,539
[door shuts]

351
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:07,707

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,008
SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT,

353
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,278
BUT MR. LUMPKE'S
VERY, VERY EAGER TO MEET YOU.

354
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,545
COME ON. COME ON.

355
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,381
[door opens]

356
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,549
SERGIO. TOM LUMPKE.

357
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,684
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

358
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,718
SAME.

359
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,253
I HOPE WE'RE NOT
INCONVENIENCING YOU.

360
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,389
NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

361
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,725
WELL, JERRY HERE
CAN SOMETIMES SEEM IMPOSING.

362
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,960
I'M A TERROR.
[laughter]

363
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,796
WELL, SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

364
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,598
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE,
FOR PETE'S SAKE.

365
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,466
[chuckling]

366
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,504
SIT.
THANK YOU.

367
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,839
WELL...

368
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,709
JERRY TELLS ME THAT YOU WORKED
AT THAT STORE

369
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,011
WHERE THEY HAD
THAT TERRIBLE FIRE.

370
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,779
YEAH.

371
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,449
WAS ANYONE HURT?
NO.

372
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,017
GOOD.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

373
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,019
RELIEVED HERE.

374
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:57,023
I'M SURE YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY JERRY BROUGHT YOU HERE.

375
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,691
YEAH, WELL, HE SAID THERE
WAS SOMETHING ABOUT A JOB.

376
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:02,028
WELL, A JOB, YES.
A JOB OF SORTS.

377
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,398
LET ME EXPLAIN.

378
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,467
WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING
TO DRINK? JERRY--

379
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,868
NO, NO, NO.

380
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,537
WHAT'S THE JOB?

381
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,805
[sighs]

382
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,741
I HAVE A SON YOUR AGE,

383
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,977
AND HE'S...

384
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,479
NOT AS GOOD A BOY AS YOU.

385
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,449
BUT HE'S THE ONLY FAMILY
I'VE GOT.

386
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,016
I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH.

387
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:28,588
BUT SOMETIMES
HE CAN BE DIFFICULT.

388
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,824
HE CAN BE VERY,
VERY DIFFICULT.

389
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,926
YOU SEE, MY SON...

390
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,065
MY SON...

391
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:42,068
MY BOY...

392
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,038
SET THAT AWFUL FIRE.

393
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:51,010
Y-YOUR SON STARTED
THE LINZER FIRE?!

394
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,011
YES.

395
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,880
AND HE WILL GO
TO JAIL.

396
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,515
YOU SEE, HE'S BEEN
IN TROUBLE BEFORE,

397
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:56,616
SO HE WILL GO TO JAIL.

398
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,017
AND THAT'S NOT
WHERE HE BELONGS

399
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,486
BECAUSE DOWN INSIDE

400
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,520
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

401
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,121
HE'S A BOY WITH TALENT!

402
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,623
EVERY DAY
I ASK MYSELF,

403
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,492
WHY COULDN'T HE BE
AN ORDINARY KID, YOU KNOW?

404
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,060
BUT IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.
IT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING.

405
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,996
WHY WOULD HE--

406
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,998
WHY WOULD HE BURN DOWN
MR. LINZER'S STORE?

407
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,866
BELIEVE ME, I DON'T KNOW.

408
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,704
BUT HE DID IT.

409
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:20,039
HE DID IT.

410
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,141
AND IT'S KILLING ME.

411
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,743
IT'S KILLING ME, SERGIO.

412
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,045
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

413
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,620
[sighs]

414
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,822
IF SOMEONE
WERE TO TAKE THE BLAME

415
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,989
FOR THAT FIRE...

416
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,426
SOMEBODY WHO'S NEVER BEEN
IN TROUBLE BEFORE.

417
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,728
THEY WOULD RECEIVE
A MINIMAL SENTENCE.

418
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:42,995
VERY MINIMAL.

419
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,096
PROBATION AT MOST.
