1
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,967
- All right,
let's come right this way.

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,602
Here we go.

3
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:12,540
All right.

4
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:13,473
Be right back with coffee.

5
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:14,842
- Thank you.
- Sure.

6
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,950
- Stop kicking me now!

7
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:22,884
- Please.

8
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:27,922
- It's breakfast!

9
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:28,923
- Look, they
don't have french fries.

10
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:30,925
We talked about this in the car.

11
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,392
It's breakfast.

12
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,194
I don't think they have
them until lunch, honey.

13
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,462
You're just gonna have to deal.

14
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,698
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:38,231
- Then I want a
donut, I want a donut.

16
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,233
- I don't think
they have donuts, either.

17
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:44,038
We'll figure it out.

18
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:46,941
- Yeah.
- You can have eggs, bagels.

19
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:50,912
Juice.

20
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,313
What do you want?
- I want orange juice!

21
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,749
- I want pancakes!

22
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,283
- Okay, that we can do.

23
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,451
- Not hungry?

24
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,020
- Not like french fries.

25
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:01,923
- How far is the train station?

26
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,156
- About a half hour walk.

27
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:08,328
No rush.

28
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:12,399
Okay, you guys can
do some coloring.

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,069
I'll be back with coffee.

30
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:16,804
thank you.

31
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,875
All right, I need the two
of you to check, all right.

32
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,710
If you kick her under
the table again,

33
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:23,711
we're gonna have.

34
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,747
- Josh, stop it!

35
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:27,715
It hurts.

36
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,020
Look, now I have just done the
worst coloring in the world.

00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,752

young people deserve to

41
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,761
Our programs are tuition
free and always will be,

42
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:16,363
but giving as little as
five.

43
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,438
- Hey, how ya doing?

44
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,607
- Hey.

45
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,809
- Hey, you wouldn't
happen to have

46
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:28,943
another smoke I
could bum, would ya?

47
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:32,379
- Yeah, sure.

00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,984
Go to manginavenueproject.org,

50
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:40,387
where you can donate, volunteer,
and help our youth grow.

51
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,891
- This
just came across my desk.

52
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,660
In local news, an investigation

53
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,662
is underway after
a Richmond woman

54
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,864
was found dead in her
home early this morning.

55
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,766
Lincoln County
investigators confirm

56
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,701
that signs of a
struggle were evident,

57
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:56,369
and this case will be
treated as a homicide.

58
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,772
Motive has yet to be determined.

59
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,439
However, there were no signs

60
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,975
of a forced.

61
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:04,712
- I'm out here job hunting
and not having much luck.

62
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,214
- Oh, where
are you applying?

63
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,482
- I hit up all these
stores really except-

64
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,218
- There's
a lot of stores.

65
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,451
- Yeah.

66
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,620
Do you got, I'm sorry, I don't.

67
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,453
- Do you need a light?
- Yeah, thank you.

68
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,258
They're not hiring
here, are they?

69
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,962
- Well, I was gonna say
I wouldn't, you know.

70
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,598
- Really, not a good place?

71
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,236
- I only work here
because I'm trying

72
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,837
to save up to go to school.

73
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,540
It's just like absolute.

74
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:33,541
- Yeah.

75
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,408
Can I fucking help you?

76
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,078
- What, are you
out here begging for change?

77
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,514
- Ah, hell no!

78
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,315
Have a nice day.

79
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,451
- Whoa,
whoa, I just got here!

80
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,620
Where you going?

81
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,222
- How'd you fucking
find me, man?

82
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:50,858
- Little birdy named Rick.

83
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:52,994
Come on, Ry-guy,
you know I still got

84
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:53,628
connections at Two Way Street.

85
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,865
Hey, it's been too
long, little brother.

86
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,299
- Yeah, whose fault is that?

87
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:08,609
- Hey, remember that place
up north in the sticks

88
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,511
Mom used to take us to?

89
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:12,780
You know, up in the country
there, we used to go camping.

90
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,447
Remember that?

91
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,817
Those were good times, brother.

92
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,918
Real good times.

93
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,921
Simple living back
then, too, right?

94
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:21,022
- Yes, it was.

95
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,459
You know, I moved up there
after you got locked up.

96
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,930
Had a nice little
construction job.

97
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:31,032
This old guy Teddy, man.

98
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,836
A good thing going,
too, for a few, anyway.

99
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:35,837
- Well, come on, let's go.

100
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,171
I'll give you a ride.

101
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:38,139
- To New Hampshire?

102
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:40,775
Yeah, right.

103
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,610
Sweet minivan,
though, soccer mom.

104
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,279
- Fuck off, man.

105
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:46,180
It's Crystal's.

106
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:47,949
- Ah.

107
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,717
- I'm serious.

108
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,384
Come on in, man.

109
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:56,324
You know, give us a chance
to make up for lost time.

110
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,458
Who knows, maybe
we get up there,

111
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,296
and we find work for both of us?

112
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,165
You never know.

113
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,666
- No, man.

114
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,538
- You afraid of Case Manager
Ricky finding out, is that it?

115
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,473
After all that guy's
done for you, right?

116
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,408
- You sound just
like that bitch.

117
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,111
- You know as well as I do,

118
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,747
fucking Two Way Street
ain't no different

119
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,649
than being on the inside, man.

120
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:23,751
Come on, man.

121
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,687
I owe you one.

122
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,234
- Oh, lookie what we got here.

123
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,347
You making little home movies?

124
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,553
Wait a minute, who the
fuck are these people?

125
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,924
Thought you said
this was Crystal's.

126
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,097
You fucking stole this!

127
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,666
- About an hour
before I ran into you.

128
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,134
- Goddamn, man!

129
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:15,937
You know I'm trying to
step away from this life!

130
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,771
- Yeah, me, too.

131
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:17,872
- Fuck that!

132
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:18,973
You can let me out right here.

133
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,308
Pull over.

134
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:22,209
- Come on now.
- Nah, fucking pull over!

135
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:24,078
- Just calm down, will ya?

136
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,146
Hear me out.

137
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,747
Hear you out, what?

138
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,616
- Crystal broke
up with me, okay?

139
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,951
- Oh, come on.

140
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:32,420
- No, seriously, man,
she broke up with me.

141
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,221
Just help me out, okay?

142
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:37,525
After that, clean
slate, all right?

143
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,160
I'm trying to start over new.

144
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,028
I'm trying to be a new
person here, all right?

145
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,064
- Oh, off to a great start.

146
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:45,533
- I'm not pulling you
back in, Ryan, okay?

147
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,736
This is just to get
us up there, right?

148
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:52,173
And then honest living,
honest living, man.

149

Trust me.

150
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,249
- I need a fucking smoke.

00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,553
All right.

it's like something in
me changes, you know?

162
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:43,357
- That's a scientific theory.

163
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:46,494
It's habitat selection theory.

No, seriously, it's this thing.

167
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:55,136
It was on NPR, and
they looked at animals

168
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,971
that grew up in a
zoo versus animals

169
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,775
that grew up in the wild,
and the animals in the wild,

170
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:02,176
they had better
social functioning,

171
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,111
better psychological
functioning,

172
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:07,248
better physical
health, and it was just

173
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:08,649
from being surrounded by nature,

174
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,284
and it's the same thing with us.

175
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:40,748
- Oh, no way.

176
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:42,983
No way!

177
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,486
- What, Ry?

178
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,821
- Fuck!

179
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,022
Look at this shit, man.

180
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,323
Don't nobody stay here.

181
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:52,493
What the fuck was I thinking?

182
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,203
What are you doing?

183
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,478
- Come on, man.

184
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:13,414
Place looks like it's
closed for the season.

185
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,348
Maybe for good.

186
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,819
No one will even
know we're here.

187
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,855
- Yeah?

188
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:23,190
They will if you use
that fucking crowbar.

189
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:24,959
- Come on, it'll be fun.

190
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,193
Just check it out, you know?

191
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:27,761
- Hold up.

192
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,367
- Ah, Ry guy.

193
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:49,850
- No fishing, remember?

194
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,385
Clean slate, motherfucker.

195
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,920
- All right.

196
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:56,023
We'll put everything back
exactly how we found it.

197
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,224
I promise.

198
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:58,058
- Mm hmm.

199
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:32,793
- Nice.

200
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,497
- No.

201
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:37,364
- Take your pick, man.

202
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,400
- Nah, man.

203
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:41,202
Nah, I'm cool.

204
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,336
Put that shit back.

205
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,204
- Yeah, okay.

206
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,540
You say that now until you run

207
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:48,342
into a fucking bear or
something out in the woods.

208
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,977
I'd reconsider, my friend.

209
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,213
- Are you scared of bears now?

210
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,782
- There's all kinds of
shit in these woods, man.

211
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,016
- Ain't like we're
staying here anyway,

212
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,151
so who gives a shit?

213
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,118
Come on, let's go.

214
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:01,755
What are you doing?

215
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:05,259
- What's the rush, man?

216
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,093
- What?

217
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,400
- Look at this place.

218
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,371
We gotta find
somewhere to crash.

219
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,607
This is great.

220
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,642
- Wait, you wanna
like squat here?

221
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,511
Are you fucking stupid?

222
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:25,913
I came here for one reason
and one reason only,

223
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,148
and now that shit
ain't happening,

224
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,783
so why the fuck would I stay?

225
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,952
- I ain't driving
back, Ry-guy, okay?

226
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:34,121
It's two hours up
and two hours back.

227
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,223
At least your
buddy Teddy owes us

228
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,559
a good night's sleep, man.

229
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:41,696
I'm just gonna lay
here and lay low, man,

230
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,797
figure out our next move.

231
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:44,666
Trust me.

232
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:00,548
- I'm fucking starving,
and you're buying.

233
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:30,712
- Hey, how ya doing?

234
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,483
Do you guys sell cigarettes?

235
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:39,320
- Yeah.

236
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,307
- Oh, Jesus.

237
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,609
Thank you.

238
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:03,110
- You all set?

239
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:07,014
- Yeah, I just need the one
pack, the lights, please.

240
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm no professional.

241
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,322
I just like to have a
few when I'm on vacation.

242
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,728
- All set?
- Yeah.

243
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:26,200
Yeah, I think that'll do it.

244
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,067
How much?

245
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,505
- 27.50.

246
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,525
Something I can help you with?

247
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:52,893
- Just browsing.

248
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:56,531
- Penny, out back.

249
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:05,507
- She's nice.

250
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,614
- Jesus.

251
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:14,047
- Hey, how much is
all this shit, man?

252
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,149
No prices anywhere.

253
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:31,031
Is this fresh?

254
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,273
Oh, I got them wasabi peas.

255
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:44,646
You like them, right?

256
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:58,192
- I'd check that if I
were you, my friend.

257
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,094
- Why don't you
mind your business?

258
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,396
- Show him.

259
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,399
Then give him a one,
and you give him a 10.

260
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:12,473
- Oh, shit, got him!

261
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,143
- Thanks.

262
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,546
You know, I didn't even notice.

263
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:24,886
Thank you.

264
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:28,188
Thanks again, appreciate it.

265
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:31,458
- Hey, how much for
a pack of smokes?

266
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,368
I want this one.

267
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,070
- Whoa, no, no,
no, don't do that.

268
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,607
- Oh, you're awake now, Pepe?

269
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,308
How much?

270
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,944
- 7.25.

271
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,582
No, 7.75.

272
00:16:54,616 --> 00:16:56,718
- Prices just
magically went up, huh?

273
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:57,652
- Like that.

274
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,419
- That's the price.

275
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,188
- Are you sure?

276
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,525
Or are you just trying
to swindle us now, too?

277
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,128
Give me two packs, the lights.

278
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,143
- What?

279
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:34,622
- 55.60.

280
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:38,860
- 55?

281
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:41,963
- If you don't like
it, you can leave.

282
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,035
- Okay.
- It is what it is.

283
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,039
- I got that, you pay.

284
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:00,648
- Tell you what, Dick,
since you're just making up

285
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:03,183
numbers, why don't we make
up a number of our own?

286
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:07,055
This is what we're
gonna give you.

287
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,488
- There you
go, buddy.

288
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:10,257
Fucking old bastard.

289
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:15,730
- Get the fuck out, get
out of my fucking store!

290
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,130
- Gimme the bat.

291
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:17,966
- You fucking crazy, old man?

292
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,199
- Give it to me!

293
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,267
- Get the
fuck out of here!

294
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,468
- Get the fuck back!

295
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:23,938
What are you doing?

296
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:24,772
What are you?

297
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,173
Get the fuck!

298
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,709
Don't fucking do that.

299
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,411
- Grandpa, what's going on?

300
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,648
- Oh, shit.

301
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:36,618
- Penny, go on out back, honey.

302
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:45,660
- Come on over here.

303
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,260
I gotta tell you something.

304
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,530
- Leave her alone,
you son of a bitch.

305
00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:51,599
Penny, go out back now.

306
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:54,434
- Come on, I just gotta
tell you something.

307
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,970
Come on, it's a secret.

308
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,139
- Hey, what the fuck?

309
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,441
Come on, no, man, we gotta go!

310
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,778
- Come on over here,
it's about your grandpa.

311
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:09,984
Come on, come on, sit on
my lap, like Santa Claus.

312
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,754
- What the
fuck are you doing?

313
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,489
- Shut up.

314
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:18,993
How old are you?

315
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,095
- 15.

316
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,431
- No way, 15?

317
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,572
They didn't make 'em like
this when I was a kid.

318
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,643
- Leave her alone, please.

319
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:37,111
Just take your stuff and go.

320
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,882
- I think you deserve
to hear something.

321
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:45,385
Okay?

322
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:49,857
Your grandpa is a
fucking con artist.

323
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:54,428
He was just making
up random prices

324
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,963
for everything we were buying,

325
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:01,102
and we caught him.

326
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:03,437
We called him out on it.

327
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:12,479
And we told him, we're not
gonna stand for your stuff.

328
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:21,723
So he ran and he was gonna
call the police on us!

329
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,694
Like we were robbing him.

330
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:28,328
Can you believe it?

331
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:37,672
That's when my brother got
angry, and he broke your phone.

332
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:50,852
I'm not gonna hurt
you, Penny, okay?

333
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:55,890
Or your piece of shit
grandfather over there.

334
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:02,329
But I just wanted you to
know that he's the bad guy.

335
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:08,335
Not us.

336
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,508
And if I were you,
I'd tell my grandpa

337
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:20,848
he needs to start running
an honest business, okay?

338
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:25,787
Come here.

339
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:43,171
Now get the fuck off me.

340
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,931
- Okay, gun it.

341
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,352
- Sean,
it's not gonna work.

342
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:35,089
We need to put something
under the wheel for traction.

343
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:40,393
- Okay, I'm gonna
take a walk up.

344
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:41,762
I'm gonna see if my
uncle's got anything

345
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,231
lying around that
might help us out.

346
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:45,266
- Do you want me to do it?

347
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,068
- No, no, I got this.

348
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:48,002
- Okay.

349
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,004
- I'll be right back.

350
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:16,330
- What?

351
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:19,200
- That's what I'd like to
know, what the fuck was that?

352
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:26,473
- Just having a little fun, man.

353
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:46,694
What do we have here?

354
00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:58,099
Car doesn't like
the mud, does it?

355
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,003
- Not at all.

356
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:08,442
- Can we give you a push?

357
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:10,311
- No, thank you, but,
honestly, I'm fine.

358
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,879
My husband-
- No, it's not a problem

359
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:13,180
at all.

360
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:14,682
Two guys are better than one.

361
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,819
Or none in this case 'cause
your husband isn't here.

362
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,354
- Well, he should be right back,

363
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,957
so it's no problem really.

364
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:26,527
Okay, you guys really don't
have to do this right now.

365
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,696
- Hey, puppy, that's
a good doggie.

366
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:32,433
What kind is he?

367
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,568
- It's a girl, and
her name is Danny.

368
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:36,470
She's just a mutt.

369
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:37,805
- Nothing wrong with that.

370
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,175
- Come on, man, let's go.

371
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,980
- Okay, you ready?

372
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:50,985
Okay, we're gonna start
rocking it back and forth,

373
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:53,054
and then when we get her going,

374
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:56,057
give it a little gas, but
not too much, all right?

375
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:58,125
Be gentle.

376
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:13,707
- Cool, you guys get it out?

377
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,409
- Hey, honey, yeah, these
guys were driving up

378
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,945
and were nice enough
to stop and help.

379
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:20,414
- The fuck you
gonna do with those?

380
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:21,749
- You know, that is a
really great question,

381
00:26:21,782 --> 00:26:24,151
and it's not one I have
an answer to right now.

382
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:28,389
Ro, I just met these
guys over at Dick's.

383
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:29,356
- Oh, seriously?

384
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:32,059
- Yeah, your man
here was gonna let

385
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:34,862
that old bastard at the
store steal all your money.

386
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:36,464
- What?

387
00:26:36,497 --> 00:26:38,899
- Yeah, Dick shortchanged me.

388
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:41,168
I didn't notice, but this
guy, he called him out on it.

389
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:42,203
It was awesome.

390
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:45,406
- Got a cigarette?

391
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,174
- Oh, yeah.

392
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:50,010
You know what, I think
I'm going to join you.

393
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:50,878
You don't mind, right?

394
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:53,981
- You got a light?

395
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:55,416
- Oh, shit, yeah.

396
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:57,718
Somewhere, I got it.

397
00:26:58,886 --> 00:26:59,820
Here we go.

398
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:01,755
I'm Sean, by the way.

399
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:03,057
This is my wife Rosanna.

400
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:09,930
I appreciate the help,
again.

401
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:12,466
I should have you guys follow
me around everywhere I go.

402
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,037
- That's my brother Rick.

403
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:18,639
Ricky.

404
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:19,508
I'm Dave.

405
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:21,775
- You guys live around here?

406
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:23,477
- No.

407
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:27,314
- Are you visiting?

408
00:27:27,348 --> 00:27:29,016
- We got some friends up there.

409
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:30,651
We're gonna do a little fishing.

410
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:31,919
- Oh, Laurie and Reuben.

411
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:34,088
They have a cabin
just up the road.

412
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:36,390
- Nope, don't know 'em.

413
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:40,828
- They ran a construction
business out of there.

414
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:43,330
- Oh, really?

415
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:45,332
- Well, yeah, they've
been close for a few years now,

416
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:46,867
ever since the owner got sick.

417
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,204
- Teddy?

418
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,540
- Yeah, Teddy.

419
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:54,041
My Uncle Brian,
whose cabin we're at,

420
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:55,242
they were best friends.

421
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:57,811
- So you know Teddy then?

422
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,813
- You can recognize
him by his first name.

423
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:04,685
We actually work for
Wickstrom Building.

424
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:09,624
Well, I mean, that was
years ago, long time ago,

425
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:12,126
but I mean, so we came up here,

426
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,695
we're gonna do a little
pro bono work on the cabin.

427
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:19,700
You know, help the
family out a little bit.

428
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:21,268
We know what they
been going through,

429
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:23,304
and it must be tough
for them, you know.

430
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:25,372
- That's sweet of you guys.

431
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:26,473
- That's really nice.

432
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:31,011
- Yeah, you know, Ted
was really nice to me,

433
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:34,014
and, you know, I'll
never forget it,

434
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:38,185
and just felt like
the right thing to do.

435
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:44,158
And, of course, I wanna
take this guy fishing.

436
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:48,095
- Yep, fishing, it's
the fucking best.

437
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:52,466
- Yeah, I haven't
been fishing in years.

438
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,770
- Well, thanks so
much, you guys.

439
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,806
It was really nice to meet you.

440
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,641
- Yeah, I mean, thanks again.

441
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:01,175
Can't thank you enough.

442
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,743
And we're just up the
hill on Respite Road,

443
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:04,979
so anything you
guys need, you know,

444
00:29:05,012 --> 00:29:06,413
anything at all, you know.

445
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:08,249
Stop by for a beer.

446
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:11,986
- Nice to meet you.

447
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:29,436
- I don't like that you talked

448
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,105
to them people in the
first fucking place,

449
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:32,473
but I think they bought it.

450
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:42,383
- How about that girl, huh?

451
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:56,030
- That was weird.

452
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:58,132
Did Brian say Laurie
and Reuben would be

453
00:29:58,165 --> 00:29:59,266
out this weekend, too?

454
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,835
- Yeah, they should be there

455
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:04,071
cleaning out the rest
of Teddy's stuff.

456
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:30,598
All right, come on, Danny girl.

457
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:32,600
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, uh uh,

458
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,002
I don't want her off the leash.

459
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,671
- Come on,
she's not gonna go far.

460
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:38,138
- Come on, babe.

461
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,073
- You know, it's
her favorite spot.

462
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,307
She gets to run around free.

463
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:42,376
If we keep her inside
all day, that's torture.

464
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,311
Hey, check it out.

465
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:47,915
That's a trail cam.

466
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:49,684
They're motion
sensored, so you know,

467
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:51,885
you get a sense of the
wildlife in the area,

468
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,655
see what comes around at night.

469
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:54,855
- That's really cool.

470
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:55,824
- Yeah.
- You think we can take

471
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:56,990
it down and check it out?

472
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:01,862
- Well, you know, we'd
have to take it inside

473
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:03,497
and hook it up to a computer.

474
00:31:03,531 --> 00:31:05,032
It's the only way to really
go through the photos

475
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,601
and see what's on there.

476
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:10,037
- Never mind, it's okay.

477
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,871
Come on.

478
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:14,642
Let's go, good girl.

479
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:38,700
- Shit, this is the life, huh?

480
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,643
Use a goddamn coaster, please.

481
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:50,411
- Huh?

482
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,415
- Use a coaster.

483
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:56,083
That's what they're there for.

484
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:58,952
You don't wanna leave
rings on the table.

485
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:02,289
- Okay, so this
Susie Homemaker shit

486
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:04,224
is getting a little
fucking weird, Bob.

487
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,694
- What, man?

488
00:32:06,728 --> 00:32:07,662
We're supposed to make it look

489
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:08,763
like we're never here, remember?

490
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:10,030
- Okay.

491
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:17,739
Not bad, huh?

492
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:26,947
How about that little
wifey down the road, huh?

493
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:37,759
What do you think she's
doing with that guy?

494
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:38,893
- I don't know.

495
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:40,027
He must have
something you don't.

496
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:45,432
- A
new hybrid of wild animal

497
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:48,736
has found its way into some
of the more urban areas

498
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,137
of North America.

499
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:55,242
Appearing very wolf-like,
these stealthy predators

500
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:58,546
have slipped unnoticed
into our cities.

501
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:02,684
A medium-sized carnivore
howling among us

502
00:33:02,717 --> 00:33:04,519
is going to do very well.

503
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:26,240
- We've
gotta get outta here.

504
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:27,876
- We are,
we are getting out of here.

505
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,711
We're going to the
cabin, you know?

506
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:32,246
Yeah, but no, I mean,

507
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,548
not a weekend, for good.

508
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:35,482
- Yeah.

509
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:37,685
You know...

510
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:42,489
I am gonna tell him.

511
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,528
Tomorrow, FYI.

512
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:47,461
- Okay.

513
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:49,363
- I'm gonna walk right in there

514
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:51,766
and I'm gonna say,
you know what,

515
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,269
it's been a long time coming,

516
00:33:55,302 --> 00:34:00,307
and I deserve a fucking raise.

517
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:01,308
- Yeah, that's good.

518
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,344
- Excuse me?

519
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:06,413
- No,
it's just I've heard

520
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:08,482
this routine before.

521
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:13,922
- What, no, fuck, Danny!

522
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:14,822
Shit!

523
00:34:17,257 --> 00:34:18,358
Danny!

524
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:23,865
Danny!

525
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:28,603
Fuck.

526
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:37,277
Danny.

527
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:45,085
Danny!

528
00:35:53,054 --> 00:35:53,888
- Hey.

529
00:35:55,923 --> 00:35:56,924
Dan, let's go.

530
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,293
Come on, babe.

531
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:02,764
Where is she?

532
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:06,534
Why didn't you wake me?

533
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:08,970
Danny!

534
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,506
- Ro, I already looked
everywhere for her.

535
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:14,441
- Okay, I'm going
to go up the road.

536
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,878
You go into the woods in case
she crossed through there.

537
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:18,546
- Sure, I'm just
gonna put something on.

538
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:19,514
Maybe a jacket.

539
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:20,815
- Yeah, take your time.

540
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:23,483
- I'm sure
she'll come back.

541
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:27,487
- Oh yeah.

542
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:42,402
Morning.

543
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:44,939
- Going out for a smoke.

544
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:09,831
- Hey.

545
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:16,904
You guys haven't seen our
dog run up here, have you?

546
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:19,173
- Nah.

547
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,844
I mean, I just woke
up, so maybe she did.

548
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:27,247
You need some help looking?

549
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,516
Come on, I'll go with ya.

550
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:41,095
- You know, you don't
look much like your brother.

551
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:44,098
- Yeah, foster brother.

552
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:49,604
Me and Dave used to hang
out when we were teenagers.

553
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:52,840
His moms took me in
when she found out

554
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:54,208
I was living on the street.

555
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:57,444
I think his dad was only into it

556
00:37:57,477 --> 00:37:58,946
because I came with a paycheck.

557
00:38:00,148 --> 00:38:03,283
His mom was nice,
real nice, to me.

558
00:38:05,987 --> 00:38:08,656
Anyway, you don't look
much like your husband.

559
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:09,524
- That's true.

560
00:38:10,525 --> 00:38:11,358
Danny!

561
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:16,798
- I want a dog someday,

562
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,433
when I have a house and a yard.

563
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,870
- We have this really tiny
apartment in the city,

564
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:25,273
so she's not used
to being off leash

565
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,975
and in the woods where
there are coyotes.

566
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:28,843
Danny?

567
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:35,448
- Goddamn it.

568
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:40,453
You stupid fucking idiot.

569
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,761
I'm never gonna hear
the end of this.

570
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:47,662
Not a chance.

571
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:54,802
- Danny!

572
00:39:00,274 --> 00:39:03,010
- Damn, girl, you
must run a lot.

573
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:05,412
You even run when you walk.

574
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:08,883
Making me realize how
out of shape I'm in,

575
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:09,817
trying to keep up.

576
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:12,385
- Hey.

577
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:16,224
- Hey, anything?

578
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:17,091
- No.

579
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:20,328
You know, I don't think
she came up this way.

580
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:22,096
How's it going?

581
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,964
- Danny!

582
00:39:24,464 --> 00:39:25,299
What up?

583
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:28,803
- All right, well, you were
the last one to see her,

584
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:30,905
so where do you think she is?

585
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:32,106
- Well, I was thinking
maybe we go back,

586
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,841
we get the car,
drive around a bit.

587
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,878
- Why would we do that when
she's probably out in the woods?

588
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:39,981
- Yep, no, you're right.

589
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:46,087
Hey, thanks for all your help.

590
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,921
- Thanks.

591
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:48,589
- No problem, good luck.

592
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:28,229
It's crooked.

593
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,521
Oh, shit!

594
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:58,326
Aw, fuck.

595
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:00,227
Help me get the fucking
thing open, man!

596
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,744
What the fuck are you doing?

597
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:19,914
- You know, I kinda
miss the place a little.

598
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:21,515
- Hey, guys!

599
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:24,585
Oh, sorry, sorry, didn't mean
to scare y'all like that.

600
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:27,688
It's okay,
it's okay, come on in.

601
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:31,459
I knew where the key was,
so we just let ourselves in.

602
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:35,262
So I used to work for Teddy.

603
00:41:36,564 --> 00:41:39,333
I'm Ryan Edwards.

604
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,902
Anybody remember me?

605
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:44,205
Oh, probably not.

606
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:47,074
Joey, you were real little.

607
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:49,810
- I'm sorry, what are
you doing in our house?

608
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:52,680
- Ruben, right?

609
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:53,547
- Yeah.

610
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:59,153
- So me and your pops
was real tight, okay?

611
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:01,455
I just wanted to say hello.

612
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:02,923
I know he hasn't
been doing too good,

613
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:06,394
and we was in the area
so we wanted to come by.

614
00:42:06,427 --> 00:42:08,295
We saw the place was empty.

615
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:11,098
I remembered the moose
key, so, you know,

616
00:42:11,132 --> 00:42:13,968
I just thought, well,
that would be all right.

617
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:17,204
- Listen, Teddy died
almost 10 years ago.

618
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:20,509
- Oh.

619
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:23,811
I guess it's been
longer than I thought.

620
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,648
- Yeah, we're actually up here

621
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:28,849
to finally clear the place out.

622
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:30,317
We're gonna be tearing
this cottage down

623
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:31,952
and selling the property.

624
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,823
- Wow, okay.

625
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:39,960
- Were you
in touch with him

626
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:41,562
when he was sick or something?

627
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:43,064
- No, no.

628
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:48,969
I just been gone
a while, I guess.

629
00:42:50,938 --> 00:42:54,241
To be honest with you,
I'm looking for work,

630
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:59,046
and I just thought
I'd come up here

631
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:01,749
and maybe Teddy, he'd still
have the business going,

632
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:06,754
and see if he had
anything for me.

633
00:43:07,388 --> 00:43:07,721
- Oh, oh.

634
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:14,462
Well, you know, Ryan,
I'm actually thinking

635
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:16,831
of starting the
business back up again.

636
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:19,366
You know, maybe relocating
to the next town over.

637
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,602
You know, you could
give me your resume.

638
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:26,073
I think I do remember you,
and Teddy really liked you,

639
00:43:26,107 --> 00:43:28,809
so, I mean, you know,
that could work out great.

640
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:30,077
- Serious?

641
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:31,412
Like, I mean, you...

642
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:34,982
This is real?

643
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,320
Thank you, guys, so much.

644
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:43,023
You don't know what
this means to me.

645
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:47,328
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what the fuck

646
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:48,462
are you doing?
- Oh, God.

647
00:43:48,496 --> 00:43:51,031
- Your car keys and your wallet.

648
00:43:51,065 --> 00:43:54,268
- Bobby, I know
these people, man.

649
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:55,136
- No, you don't.

650
00:43:56,505 --> 00:43:57,838
They don't care about you, man.

651
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:00,509
Let's go.

652
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:01,976
You, too, let's go.
- All right.

653
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:05,446
Laurie, Joey, do whatever he
asks, just do whatever he asks.

654
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,680
- Please, don't do this.

655
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:09,950
- I'm doing you a favor.

656
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:12,920
These people don't
give a fuck about you.

657
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,924
They're just telling
you what you wanna hear

658
00:44:16,957 --> 00:44:18,659
because we broke
into their cabin.

659
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:21,195
Give me your fucking purse.

660
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:24,431
You got something for
me, buddy, huh, huh?

661
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:25,432
Is that it?

662
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:26,635
- Yeah.
- You got anything else?

663
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,269
- No, no,
that's it, that's it.

664
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:37,077
- Guys, please, it's okay.

665
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:39,046
Everything will be all right.

666
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,214
- Okay.

667
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:41,148
They're not gonna hurt us.

668
00:44:41,182 --> 00:44:42,183
They just want our money.

669
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:43,083
Isn't that right?

670
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:46,086
You're not gonna hurt
us, are you, pal?

671
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:49,423
No.

672
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:51,892
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, what are you doing?

673
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,374
Fuck!

674
00:45:07,408 --> 00:45:10,010
Go get him, what are you doing?

675
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:13,047
The fuck are you doing?

676
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:18,886
- Wait, wait, wait!

677
00:45:31,432 --> 00:45:33,033
- Took care of that bear for ya.

678
00:45:47,716 --> 00:45:50,951
- We can't just
leave him like this.

679
00:45:50,985 --> 00:45:52,286
- What, do you wanna
call an ambulance?

680
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:17,278
- There's another one.

681
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:20,114
- Well, it's a popular area.

682
00:46:20,147 --> 00:46:22,850
She's got her orange
on, she's fine.

683
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:27,354
- Danny!

684
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,311
- Holy shit.

685
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:55,816
- Oh my God, Danny!

686
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:00,622
Hi, baby, oh my God!

687
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:03,457
I can't believe it!

688
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,258
- Hey, hey!
- Have you just been

689
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:05,593
here this whole time?

690
00:47:05,627 --> 00:47:06,393
Oh my God!

691
00:47:06,427 --> 00:47:08,329
Did Ricky find you?

692
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:28,783
- Oh, hey, looks like
Laurie and Ruben made it up.

693
00:47:28,817 --> 00:47:29,651
- Yeah.

694
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:32,853
Hmm.

695
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:52,306
- What the fuck is that?

696
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,443
The fuck?

697
00:47:58,312 --> 00:48:00,381
Oh, hell yeah!

698
00:48:00,414 --> 00:48:04,451
Fucking Merry Christmas,
motherfucker!

699
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:16,865
Don't drink and drive.

700
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:23,237
- What was he thinking?

701
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:27,241
What the fuck was
he fucking thinking?

702
00:48:27,274 --> 00:48:30,612
Fuck, man, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

703
00:48:32,346 --> 00:48:34,415
- What the fuck are
you doing, Ryan?

704
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:35,583
- Fuck!

705
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:39,754
- Fucking fool, fucking.

706
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,262
- Shit, shit, shit.

707
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:49,129
Where's he going?

708
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:02,309
What up?

709
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,117
- You planning your escape?
- What?

710
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,385
No, man, I ain't doing nothing!

711
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:12,419
What the fuck?

712
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:18,125
Are you gonna shoot
me now, too, huh?

713
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:20,227
You gonna fucking
shoot me now, too?

714
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,362
Your own fucking brother!

715
00:49:29,571 --> 00:49:32,574
Why'd you have to
kill those people?

716
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,475
Why?

717
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:50,324
- Look, they showed up,
and I did what I had to do.

718
00:49:51,058 --> 00:49:52,627
- You fucked me.

719
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,228
- I was helping you!

720
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:55,530
You fucked me!

721
00:49:57,665 --> 00:50:00,501
You never even introduced
me to those people!

722
00:50:00,535 --> 00:50:02,604
It's like you're
ashamed of me, man!

723
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,542
You didn't even
tell 'em my name!

724
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:12,947
- You're fucking crazy.

725
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,652
I never had a chance
to tell 'em your name

726
00:50:17,685 --> 00:50:19,888
'cause you started
fucking killing everyone!

727
00:50:23,525 --> 00:50:25,158
I'm fucked.

728
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:26,260
I'm so fucked.

729
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,495
- Come on, Ry-guy.

730
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:29,931
This was supposed to be fun.

731
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:32,132
Ry-guy!

732
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:36,470
Hey, we can't be done yet!

733
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:39,507
Come on, no one will ever
know, if we stick to the plan!

734
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:42,810
- You ain't stuck with the
plan since we got up here!

735
00:50:42,844 --> 00:50:45,412
- Okay, that's
true, that's true.

736
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:48,148
But just hear me out, okay?

737
00:50:48,181 --> 00:50:50,450
We'll dump the car and the van,

738
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:53,253
and then we'll walk back and
we'll clean the cabin, man.

739
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:56,189
We gotta make it look

740
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:57,859
like we were never
in that place, right?

741
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,096
Hey, we're in this together.

742
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:09,269
I need you, Ryan.

743
00:51:16,678 --> 00:51:18,012
- We out by morning.

744
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:20,949
Then we're fucking done.

745
00:51:21,816 --> 00:51:23,150
Never wanna see you again.

746
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:26,286
Just like old times.

747
00:53:00,648 --> 00:53:02,182
- You know, Crystal said

748
00:53:02,215 --> 00:53:04,552
she was all done
wasting time with me.

749
00:53:06,788 --> 00:53:08,089
There wasn't gonna be shit.

750
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:12,325
I grabbed her.

751
00:53:16,097 --> 00:53:17,197
I didn't mean to, man.

752
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:24,105
Fucking cut me pretty good
with the kitchen knife, though.

753
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:27,108
She was so scared.

754
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:39,520
I just wanted to
hold her, you know?

755
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:42,557
Quiet her down.

756
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:46,761
Get that knife away from me.

757
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:51,733
Guess I don't know
my own strength, huh?

758
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:56,303
I didn't realize how
hard I was squeezing her.

759
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,246
I just left her there.

760
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,684
Probably found her by now.

761
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:19,060
- Fuck!

762
00:54:30,905 --> 00:54:32,507
So that was it this whole time.

763
00:54:37,178 --> 00:54:38,513
Played me again.

764
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:45,920
What the fuck is wrong with me?

765
00:54:50,925 --> 00:54:52,693
What the fuck is wrong with you?

766
00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:56,363
- I needed an out, and
you gave me one, man!

767
00:54:56,396 --> 00:54:57,532
Bring you up north.

768
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:02,270
You kept saying how you were
gonna change things, you know?

769
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:03,436
Kept talking about Teddy

770
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,274
and how great
things are up here.

771
00:55:07,575 --> 00:55:08,810
I wanted in on that.

772
00:55:10,278 --> 00:55:11,646
I wanted a clean slate.

773
00:55:17,652 --> 00:55:19,587
You really had
nothing all along.

774
00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:24,258
- I had a shot and
you fucked it all up,

775
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,062
just like everything
else you touch.

776
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:31,032
- You had nothing,

777
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:36,304
and you ain't gonna be shit,
just like your big brother.

778
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:19,213
- So how did the
talk with Mark go?

779
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:22,083
- It was good, yeah.

780
00:56:24,285 --> 00:56:26,587
We didn't really get
into numbers or anything.

781
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:28,990
Just more, it was productive.

782
00:56:29,023 --> 00:56:32,560
We got the ball moving.

783
00:56:32,593 --> 00:56:33,426
- Okay.

784
00:56:35,897 --> 00:56:38,799
- It was a
missed opportunity.

785
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:40,368
I'll try again.
- Yeah.

786
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:44,471
- Holy shit!
- Jesus Christ!

787
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:48,376
- No, but I am better
looking, though.

788
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,878
- You guys scared
the shit out of me.

789
00:56:50,912 --> 00:56:53,214
- I thought you heard
us coming up the driveway.

790
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:59,220
- So, what's up, guys?

791
00:57:00,821 --> 00:57:03,357
- Just wanted to come by
and borrow some sugar.

792
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:09,297
Sorry, you folks, I
know it's really late.

793
00:57:10,598 --> 00:57:14,568
We're cooking some brownies,

794
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:19,640
and we realized we
were out of sugar.

795
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:25,646
- Yeah, we must have some.

796
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:28,950
- See that, they got some.

797
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:32,286
Hey, hey, hey, it was
a joke, all right?

798
00:57:33,587 --> 00:57:35,056
Just doing that neighborly
thing, you know?

799
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:39,593
Like, hey, can we borrow
some sugar, right?

800
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,900
Actually, we were heading out,

801
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:50,938
and wanted to take you up
on that beer, you know,

802
00:57:51,806 --> 00:57:53,074
if the invite is still open.

803
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:56,410
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

804
00:57:56,444 --> 00:57:58,946
You want one, too, Rick, was it?

805
00:58:00,047 --> 00:58:01,082
- Ricky!

806
00:58:01,115 --> 00:58:02,717
- Hmm?

807
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:03,651
- You want a beer?

808
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:07,154
- Fuck yeah.
- All right.

809
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:12,360
What the fuck?

810
00:58:12,393 --> 00:58:13,094
You drank the whole thing.

811
00:58:34,048 --> 00:58:35,683
So where's the pup?

812
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,190
- She has a way of
getting into trouble.

813
00:58:43,224 --> 00:58:44,425
She likes to run into the woods,

814
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:46,594
and that's exactly
what she did today.

815
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:48,496
Spent half the day
looking for her.

816
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:50,064
Thanks for that, by the way.

817
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:52,533
- Yep.

818
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,937
- Maybe Mommy needs to get
herself a little hamster.

819
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:03,377
- Couldn't help but
overhear you guys

820
00:59:03,411 --> 00:59:05,446
talking about Danny
being on lockdown.

821
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,355
You know, it's
whatever the boss says.

822
00:59:16,957 --> 00:59:18,259
- Sounds like
he's not the only one

823
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:19,727
on a short leash.

824
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,430
- Look, I just don't want
her going out into the woods.

825
00:59:22,463 --> 00:59:25,032
- You know, it is for the best.

826
00:59:25,066 --> 00:59:27,902
Few years back, we
had another dog Linda.

827
00:59:27,935 --> 00:59:30,337
Unfortunately, she got
dragged into the woods

828
00:59:30,371 --> 00:59:33,307
by a pack of coyotes.

829
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,342
- Y'all should be
worried about coyotes.

830
00:59:39,346 --> 00:59:42,917
They like to pretend they're
something they're not

831
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:43,951
to fuck with you.

832
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:46,954
Just like people.

833
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,192
You can't trust 'em,

834
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:55,162
and they lie to
get what they want.

835
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,069
Did you know that
coyotes will send one out

836
01:00:02,103 --> 01:00:06,006
from the pack to make
friends with your dog?

837
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:11,612
They'll run around and play,

838
01:00:14,348 --> 01:00:16,117
have a great time,

839
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:23,924
when, really, coyote's just
leading him right to a trap.

840
01:00:25,126 --> 01:00:29,497
Next thing you know,
poor, stupid mutt

841
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:36,605
is surrounded, and they
just fucking rip it apart.

842
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:44,111
- I'm done talking about this.

843
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:49,350
- So, how's everything
going at Teddy's?

844
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:51,152
You guys got a lot
more work to do?

845
01:00:51,185 --> 01:00:51,986
- All done.

846
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:57,158
Moving on to the
next job tomorrow.

847
01:01:03,532 --> 01:01:07,501
What, what's the matter,
big guy, hmm?

848
01:01:07,536 --> 01:01:09,003
- Get the
fuck off me, Bobby.

849
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:10,738
Don't push me, man.

850
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:14,675
- These guys have to go.
- Don't fucking push me.

851
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,678
- That's good for you guys.

852
01:01:17,711 --> 01:01:18,913
You know, finding work.

853
01:01:18,946 --> 01:01:21,650
It's been real hard out
here for everyone, so.

854
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:23,417
- I'm gonna go up to bed.

855
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,687
- Come on, is it
something I said?

856
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,623
- No, just tired.

857
01:01:28,657 --> 01:01:30,257
Can you clean up, please?

858
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:33,595
- Good boy.
- Yeah, okay.

859
01:01:33,628 --> 01:01:34,495
I'll be right up.

860
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:38,633
- You gonna be in the doghouse,
you don't get in there.

861
01:01:43,404 --> 01:01:44,905
Give me a smoke.

862
01:01:44,939 --> 01:01:46,407
- Fuck you.
- No.

863
01:01:52,746 --> 01:01:54,516
- You know, it is getting late,

864
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:58,719
so I should probably
call it, too.

865
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,390
- Get in there, man.
- Yeah.

866
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:10,097
- Give me a fucking
smoke or what?

867
01:02:16,503 --> 01:02:19,206
Whoa, you got a hot tub, man?

868
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,542
- Yeah, yeah, we do.

869
01:02:20,575 --> 01:02:22,644
- That's fucking nice.

870
01:02:22,677 --> 01:02:24,812
- All right, guys, step
back, it's gonna get smokey.

871
01:02:33,988 --> 01:02:35,456
Well.

872
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:43,897
So.
- Nice catch.

873
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:47,368
- What have you guys
got going on after this?

874
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:50,304
- What the fuck, man?

875
01:02:50,337 --> 01:02:52,206
- All over you.

876
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:55,376
- You know, guys, I hate
to cut the night short,

877
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:59,280
but it's been a hell of a day.

878
01:03:00,147 --> 01:03:01,616
You know, I'm a little fried.

879
01:03:04,118 --> 01:03:06,487
You can finish that
beer if you want,

880
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:10,824
but I'm just gonna clean
up a little bit and then-

881
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:14,228
- Get that fire going again.

882
01:03:14,261 --> 01:03:15,429
- Again, man.

883
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:16,997
- You know, it was
good to see you guys.

884
01:03:19,133 --> 01:03:21,101
Best of luck on the
new job tomorrow.

885
01:03:25,306 --> 01:03:27,308
- I think he
wants us to leave, Dave.

886
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:32,413
Hey, can we
get one for the road?

887
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:36,283
- You know what,
those are yours.

888
01:03:36,317 --> 01:03:37,217
Have at 'em.

889
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:54,968
- I don't like
those guys at all.

890
01:03:55,002 --> 01:03:56,437
- Yeah, I know, hon.

891
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,172
- No, they're super sketchy,

892
01:03:58,205 --> 01:04:00,575
and who knows if they even
did work at that cabin

893
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:01,942
or worked for Teddy at all.

894
01:04:03,712 --> 01:04:04,945
- I wouldn't go that far.

895
01:04:04,978 --> 01:04:06,046
I mean, Laurie and
Ruben are up here,

896
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,448
Ruben-

897
01:04:07,481 --> 01:04:08,949
- You're seriously
defending them right now?

898
01:04:08,982 --> 01:04:10,752
They're lying through
their fucking teeth, Sean.

899
01:04:10,785 --> 01:04:12,486
- Ro, keep your voice down.

900
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:15,155
They might still be out there.

901
01:04:54,662 --> 01:04:55,864
- Oh my God.

902
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:57,632
You have to tell them
to leave right now.

903
01:05:02,403 --> 01:05:05,072
- This is the fucking life, huh?

904
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:08,510
Good stuff, huh?

905
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:12,112
Told you we should
go on vacation, man.

906
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:14,982
Fucking this is the life.

907
01:05:15,015 --> 01:05:16,483
- Vacation?

908
01:05:16,518 --> 01:05:17,652
Motherfucker said vacation.

909
01:05:17,685 --> 01:05:19,253
- We're away, man,
that's all that matters.

910
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:21,121
- We're in
someone else's hot tub.

911
01:05:21,155 --> 01:05:22,690
- Who gives a fuck, man, huh?

912
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,761
It's our hot tub now.

913
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:34,234
I can hold my breath for
fucking almost 30 seconds, bro.

914
01:05:36,871 --> 01:05:38,338
- I'm timing it, oh, fuck.

915
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:40,040
Party's over.

916
01:05:41,609 --> 01:05:43,343
Get up, get up.

917
01:05:43,377 --> 01:05:44,411
- Are you kidding me?

918
01:05:47,715 --> 01:05:49,383
No offense, but what the fuck?

919
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:52,587
I said goodnight to
you guys three times.

920
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,254
Three times!

921
01:05:55,422 --> 01:05:58,025
Can you please just do
me a favor and go home?

922
01:05:58,058 --> 01:06:01,094
- "Come on, I said goodnight
to you three times!

923
01:06:01,128 --> 01:06:03,464
"Why are you guys still here?

924
01:06:03,497 --> 01:06:05,165
"I want you guys to leave."

925
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:06,467
- You sound just like him.

926
01:06:08,603 --> 01:06:11,573
- I'm just trying to have a
nice evening with my wife, okay?

927
01:06:11,606 --> 01:06:14,141
I'd just appreciate it if
you guys gave me a break.

928
01:06:18,746 --> 01:06:19,581
Why not?

929
01:06:23,885 --> 01:06:25,820
- What the fuck you doing, man?

930
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:26,955
Shut up.

931
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,358
- If you two don't get
off my property right now,

932
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:32,627
I'm calling the fucking cops.

933
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,361
- Whoa.
- Ro, Ro,

934
01:06:34,394 --> 01:06:35,930
it's all right.
- We gotta go.

935
01:06:35,964 --> 01:06:37,130
- No, it's not.

936
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:39,066
They've overstayed their
welcome long enough.

937
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:40,334
You were never welcome.

938
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:41,736
You just strolled
over, unannounced,

939
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:43,237
invading our privacy.

940
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:44,706
- Ro-

941
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:45,640
- Look, I asked you nicely,
and now I'm telling you,

942
01:06:45,673 --> 01:06:47,040
get the fuck out of here.

943
01:06:47,074 --> 01:06:50,143
- Hey, hey, hey, just
take it easy, huh?

944
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:51,078
- Right here.

945
01:06:51,111 --> 01:06:52,580
- Just having, we're having fun.

946
01:06:52,614 --> 01:06:54,682
- Yeah, we were, too, before
you two animals showed up.

947
01:06:54,716 --> 01:06:57,519
You're rude, we
don't even know you.

948
01:06:57,552 --> 01:06:59,386
Who knows what you're
really doing up here.

949
01:06:59,419 --> 01:07:01,656
- What?
- Just leave now!

950
01:07:01,689 --> 01:07:03,691
- What are
you gonna do, huh?

951
01:07:03,725 --> 01:07:04,592
You gonna call the cops?

952
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:05,860
- I will if I have to.

953
01:07:05,894 --> 01:07:07,094
- You sure
you wanna do that?

954
01:07:07,127 --> 01:07:10,297
- Look, everybody
just calm down.

955
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,666
Nobody's gonna call the cops.

956
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,433
We don't even have
cellphone reception up here.

957
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,073
Oh God, Jesus Christ.

958
01:07:20,107 --> 01:07:21,141
- What the fuck?

959
01:07:21,174 --> 01:07:22,342
- Fuck.

960
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:24,378
- Look, guys, guys,
look, this whole night,

961
01:07:24,411 --> 01:07:27,147
this whole situation, it's
just gotten out of hand,

962
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,651
and I think it's time
we say goodnight.

963
01:07:30,652 --> 01:07:31,553
- Okay, goodnight.

964
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:33,755
- Please.

965
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:36,490
- What the fuck you doing, man?

966
01:07:36,524 --> 01:07:38,325
- You gotta help
me, I can't see shit.

967
01:07:45,934 --> 01:07:47,467
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, hold on.

968
01:07:47,501 --> 01:07:48,368
Wait, wait, wait.

969
01:07:53,675 --> 01:07:54,776
You gotta help me, man.

970
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:56,878
I can't even fucking see.

971
01:07:58,546 --> 01:07:59,948
Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay.

972
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:04,986
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, fuck.

973
01:08:05,452 --> 01:08:05,887
Shit.

974
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:09,891
- Is that yours?

975
01:08:13,193 --> 01:08:15,429
- Hey, man, hey, my bad.

976
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:21,936
- Yeah, no, yeah, it's fine.

977
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,136
- My bad.
- It's fine.

978
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:26,608
- I'm really sorry.

979
01:08:26,641 --> 01:08:29,844
- Yeah, no, you're
good, it's fine.

980
01:08:35,382 --> 01:08:36,985
Thank you, guys.

981
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:38,118
- You're a lucky lady.

982
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:43,123
Really, really lucky.

983
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:49,764
- Where do we go?

984
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:52,100
- We're going.
- Moose Lane?

985
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:55,469
- Ricky, Ricky, Ricky.

986
01:08:55,502 --> 01:08:56,738
- Goodnight, fellas.

987
01:08:56,771 --> 01:08:58,372
- Thank you.

988
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:10,018
- You tell them our cellphones

989
01:09:10,051 --> 01:09:11,552
don't have reception up here?

990
01:09:11,586 --> 01:09:13,320
What, are you insane or stupid?

991
01:09:13,353 --> 01:09:14,689
- I just
wanted them to leave.

992
01:09:14,722 --> 01:09:15,723
- Yeah, I did, too, that's why I

993
01:09:15,757 --> 01:09:17,224
threatened to call the cops.

994
01:09:17,257 --> 01:09:20,928
- Well, I didn't want
them to feel threatened.

995
01:09:20,962 --> 01:09:22,597
- You didn't want them
to feel threatened?

996
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:24,464
Why don't you ever stand up
for yourself or your wife,

997
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:25,499
your fucking family?

998
01:09:47,522 --> 01:09:49,691
- Fuck this shit,
man, it's clean.

999
01:09:51,526 --> 01:09:53,094
- Keep scrubbing, motherfucker.

1000
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:56,229
- You know, we
could use some seltzer.

1001
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:40,568
- Told you, I
just wanna make sure

1002
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:41,636
this fucking shit is cleared up.

1003
01:11:44,437 --> 01:11:45,606
So come on, put the-

1004
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,741
- It's
fucking fine, man.

1005
01:11:46,774 --> 01:11:48,743
- Nah, let's put these...

1006
01:11:50,745 --> 01:11:51,579
This'll work.

1007
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:54,916
Let's dump this shit on here.

1008
01:11:58,451 --> 01:11:59,887
- Can't see shit, man.

1009
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:01,122
- Ro!

1010
01:12:01,155 --> 01:12:02,355
- Look at
this, it looks like-

1011
01:12:02,389 --> 01:12:03,791
- Ro!

1012
01:12:03,825 --> 01:12:04,625
- What the fuck?

1013
01:12:04,659 --> 01:12:05,927
- Ro!

1014
01:12:07,762 --> 01:12:11,899
Hey, guys, guys.

1015
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:16,237
You seen Ro around?

1016
01:12:19,507 --> 01:12:20,373
- Ain't seen her.

1017
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,945
- You sure?

1018
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:28,149
She went for a run this morning.

1019
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:29,917
She usually comes
right through here.

1020
01:12:31,418 --> 01:12:34,421
We were hoping to be
on the road by now, so.

1021
01:12:40,094 --> 01:12:40,928
Okay.

1022
01:12:43,264 --> 01:12:44,464
Thanks anyway.

1023
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:53,007
No, no, you know,
I gotta say this.

1024
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,342
I'm sorry, but, with
all due respect,

1025
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:57,645
last night, come on, guys.

1026
01:12:57,678 --> 01:13:00,480
I'm trying to have a relaxing
evening with my wife.

1027
01:13:00,514 --> 01:13:01,916
You guys just show
up out of the blue.

1028
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:04,051
This guy was clearly
shit-faced already,

1029
01:13:04,085 --> 01:13:05,953
and then you're pounding beers,

1030
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:09,323
and you're overstaying
your welcome by a mile!

1031
01:13:09,357 --> 01:13:11,025
And then you get
into my hot tub,

1032
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:12,860
and then you throw
up in the hot tub?

1033
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:14,595
I mean, that wasn't cool!

1034
01:13:14,629 --> 01:13:16,163
- Why don't you shut
your bitch mouth?

1035
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:17,999
Wasn't cool?

1036
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:21,636
Do you know what I was
gonna do to you last night

1037
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:24,138
before this cocksucker
decided to toss his cookies?

1038
01:13:25,006 --> 01:13:26,841
You should be thanking him.

1039
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:30,778
He saved your fucking life.

1040
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:31,712
- No!

1041
01:13:31,746 --> 01:13:33,214
No!

1042
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:35,850
What the fuck are you doing?

1043
01:13:35,883 --> 01:13:37,151
- You did something to her!

1044
01:13:37,184 --> 01:13:38,019
Where is she?

1045
01:13:38,052 --> 01:13:39,320
- No, no, no.

1046
01:13:39,353 --> 01:13:40,154
Fuck!

1047
01:13:45,492 --> 01:13:46,761
- Get out of my way!

1048
01:13:46,794 --> 01:13:48,829
Get out!
- No, no!

1049
01:13:48,863 --> 01:13:49,964
- Stand back, move it!

1050
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:50,898
- Fuck you!

1051
01:13:50,932 --> 01:13:52,233
- Stop it, what are you doing?

1052
01:13:53,701 --> 01:13:55,603
- Oh, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

1053
01:13:57,605 --> 01:13:58,773
Oh, what the fuck?

1054
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:01,575
Wait, no!

1055
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:02,442
Bobby, no, no!

1056
01:14:12,153 --> 01:14:12,987
- Fuck you.

1057
01:14:23,496 --> 01:14:24,899
- What are you doing?

1058
01:14:24,932 --> 01:14:26,400
- Guess you didn't
feel it fall out.

1059
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,009
Just getting rid of
all the evidence.

1060
01:15:07,108 --> 01:15:08,009
Oh, fuck.

1061
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:15,149
Ro!

1062
01:15:41,942 --> 01:15:43,344
- You've gotta help me, please!

1063
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:45,179
These two guys attacked
my husband up the hill,

1064
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:46,447
and I-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1065
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,682
Two punks came in here
yesterday, robbed me,

1066
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:52,253
messed up my store,
smashed my phone.

1067
01:15:52,286 --> 01:15:53,087
- Do you have a cellphone?
- Probably the same two guys

1068
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,523
you're talking about.

1069
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:55,689
- Do you have a car?
- No, I don't have a car.

1070
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:56,557
- Is there anybody
else here who can help?

1071
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,426
- I cannot help you.

1072
01:15:58,459 --> 01:15:59,360
- They are coming!

1073
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:02,096
- Penny, lock the door.

1074
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:07,068
- Ro!

1075
01:16:08,269 --> 01:16:09,203
Fuck.

1076
01:16:09,236 --> 01:16:10,404
Ro!

1077
01:16:10,438 --> 01:16:12,206
Ro, come on, I ain't
gonna hurt you.

1078
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,508
Let me in!
- No.

1079
01:16:13,542 --> 01:16:14,708
- Let me in!
- You are a fucking liar!

1080
01:16:14,742 --> 01:16:16,210
- No, no, no, no!
- I saw what you did!

1081
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:19,548
- No, come on, that was
all Bobby, I swear to God!

1082
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:23,552
I didn't kill that family, he
killed that family, all right?

1083
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:25,386
I was protecting Sean.

1084
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:27,621
I had nothing to do
with any of this.

1085
01:16:27,655 --> 01:16:28,856
My brother is-
- You're just like him.

1086
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:30,958
You are, no, you're
just like him!

1087
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:32,426
- No, I'm not!
- Get out of here!

1088
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,661
We called the cops, all
right, they're on their way.

1089
01:16:33,694 --> 01:16:35,996
- Good, great, I've
never been happier

1090
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:37,798
to hear that in my goddamn life!

1091
01:16:37,832 --> 01:16:40,067
Call the cops, please!

1092
01:16:40,101 --> 01:16:42,303
We'll go, we'll go get your car.

1093
01:16:42,336 --> 01:16:43,637
- No way I'm going with you.
- Then we'll go right

1094
01:16:43,671 --> 01:16:45,507
to the police, okay?

1095
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:46,740
- I don't care-
- I will not hurt you.

1096
01:16:46,774 --> 01:16:48,008
- I don't care what
you have to say.

1097
01:16:48,042 --> 01:16:49,009
- Trust me.
- I don't believe you,

1098
01:16:49,043 --> 01:16:50,044
all right?
- Come on!

1099
01:16:50,077 --> 01:16:51,846
You gotta let me in!

1100
01:16:51,879 --> 01:16:53,481
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1101
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:56,884
Fuck!

1102
01:16:56,917 --> 01:16:57,818
I'm coming in!

1103
01:19:11,385 --> 01:19:13,220
- I'm gonna get-
- Get off of me!

1104
01:19:13,254 --> 01:19:14,488
No!
- No, no, no, no.

1105
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:15,322
- No!

1106
01:19:15,356 --> 01:19:17,024
Stop, stop, stop it.

1107
01:19:24,031 --> 01:19:25,933
- Shut up, fucking
stop fighting me.

1108
01:19:32,806 --> 01:19:35,776
- Please, I'm
pregnant, I'm pregnant.

1109
01:19:42,182 --> 01:19:45,786
- You fucking goddamn fucking
motherfucker!

1110
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,763
Fucking goddamn it!

1111
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,131
Fucking bitch!

1112
01:20:24,825 --> 01:20:25,859
Ow!

1113
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,755
- Ro.

1114
01:21:35,797 --> 01:21:37,164
Don't do it, please.

1115
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:42,704
Just give me the gun.

1116
01:21:44,371 --> 01:21:45,906
We're okay, we're okay.

1117
01:21:50,779 --> 01:21:52,379
We're okay, okay.

1118
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,063
All right, sir, I've got

1119
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:11,298
two units heading
there right now.

1120
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:12,667
They should be there
in about five minutes.

1121
01:22:13,601 --> 01:22:14,803
You did the right thing.

1122
01:22:15,904 --> 01:22:16,704
- Thank you.

1123
01:23:47,461 --> 01:23:48,395

1124
01:23:49,263 --> 01:23:50,698

Get the fuck away from me!

1128
01:23:55,402 --> 01:23:57,337
