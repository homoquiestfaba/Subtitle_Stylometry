00:00:01,485 --> 00:00:04,318
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:19,608
(light dramatic music)

3
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:28,120
- He'll be at the bar.

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,378
Let him see you, then I'll rope him in.

5
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:32,513
- I know my part, Tony.

6
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:36,680
- It's jobs like this that
give me an ulcer. (chuckling)

7
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:46,639
(jazz piano music)

8
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:52,992
- Hey, buddy!
- Hey.

9
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:59,478
- Pete, two dry ones and
make the lady a Gibson.

10
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,811
- Tony, uh, is she with you?

11
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:05,951
- Well actually, she's with you.

12
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:08,230
- Hello, I'm Jayne.

13
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,424
- Sammy.

14
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:11,201
- Oh yeah, I know all about you

15
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:13,849
and I love what I heard so far.

16
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,972
- I don't get it.

17
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:17,805
- Well let's just say Frank

18
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:19,888
likes to take care of his friends.

19
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:22,006
- I'm only here for one
night but Frank thought

20
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:26,207
it would be nice if we could
spend some time together,

21
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:27,707
if you don't mind.

22
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,005
- Hell no.

23
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:33,275
- Well, I'll let you two get acquainted.

24
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:35,775
Sammy, gimme a call next week.

25
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:39,836
(dramatic music)

26
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:43,494
- I wish all Frank's friends
were as cute as you are.

27
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,974
I'm very, very happy with this.

28
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:49,106
(giggling and smooching)

29
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:51,536
- What do you say, uh, we get outta here?

30
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:52,369
- Okay.

31
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:55,019
- Throw this on.

32
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:06,700
- Oh, you're a real tiger.

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,694
- How bout that, huh?

34
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:09,802
- I don't know Chicago that well

35
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:12,233
so you will have to show it to me, okay?

36
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,517
- Yeah, you know, this is my town.

37
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:16,246
I grew up 10 blocks from here

38
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:19,115
so I'll show you anything you wanna see.

39
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:21,339
- Everyone said you own the west side.

40
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:23,339
- Yeah, good part of it.

41
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:25,453
Let me tell you something.

42
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:27,935
We're gonna have a good
time tonight and nobody,

43
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:31,185
I mean nobody is gonna bother us, okay?

44
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:34,309
What the hell's going on here?

45
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:35,833
(suspenseful music)

46
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:36,716
- Put these on.

47
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:37,549
- You two are dead,

48
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:38,674
do you know that?
- Shut up, get in.

49
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:40,081
- You're makin' a big
mistake, I didn't do nothin'.

50
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,974
- Oh yeah, you try to keep
the west side for yourself

51
00:02:41,974 --> 00:02:43,669
without letting Frank have a taste.

52
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:44,825
- Yeah, you thought you were
gonna get away with that,

53
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:45,658
didn't you?

54
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:46,748
- No, I didn't wanna
get away with anything.

55
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:47,581
- Shut up!

56
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,520
- What are you doin', what are you doin'?

57
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,853
(gun bangs)

58
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:59,174
(dramatic music)

59
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:09,004
(faint speaking)
- See?

60
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:13,865
FBI, Tony's been trying
to make a move against me.

61
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:16,702
He thought today was the
day, well, actually it was.

62
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:18,830
- God damn, you scared the shit outta me.

63
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,132
Why the hell didn't you let me know?

64
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,668
I could've played along.

65
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,518
I know Frank wouldn't
make a move against me.

66
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:24,781
- 'Cause you're such a big shot?

67
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,521
(gun bangs)

68
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:29,271
(dramatic music)

69
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:55,463
(light jazz music)

70
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,734
It's been a long time,
Frank, you look fabulous.

71
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,377
How do I look?

72
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:04,854
- Very expensive.

73
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:07,348
- You always find a way to
afford me when you needed to.

74
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:08,888
- I never mind paying for quality, Jayne,

75
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:12,059
just as long as I get what I paid for.

76
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:13,721
You ever bump into Peter Quinn?

77
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,457
- Some monkey on your payroll?

78
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:17,558
- He's been carrying for me, profits,

79
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:19,877
from Detroit, St. Louis, Phoenix.

80
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:20,829
- Lot of cash?

81
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,699
- Yeah but he's been coming up short

82
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,238
his last six deliveries
and you, of all people,

83
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:27,717
know how I hate being ripped off.

84
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:30,717
- You have such a bad temper, Frank.

85
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,167
- I want you to show this
son of a bitch just how bad.

86
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,920
He'll be in tonight, I
don't want him leaving.

87
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,175
I mean really, Jayne, I want
you to make a point here, okay?

88
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:46,342
Then you bring me my cash.

89
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:50,610
In this envelope, his hotel information,

90
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,087
and something in there extra for yourself.

91
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:54,123
- Thank you.

92
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:58,873
- I love the personal touch
you bring to your work, Jayne.

93
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:01,956
You still wearing those silk panties?

94
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,888
- Thanks for thinking of me.

95
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:16,264
(dramatic music)

96
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:32,466
- Hey Mom, I'm sorry I'm late.

97
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:34,546
- Lunch has been ready for a half hour.

98
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:36,414
- What's wrong, is it Dad?

99
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,432
Did something happen to him?

100
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:38,885
- No such luck.

101
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,080
- Well, was it Grandma?

102
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,057
- You want me to run down today's list?

103
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:44,479
Let's see, I don't know
how to handle money,

104
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,046
I'm raising you all wrong,

105
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:48,600
and how could I ever let
a man like your father go?

106
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,991
Oh, and there were two
other major incidents

107
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:53,305
from before I was 10
but she's saving those

108
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:54,780
for our next chat.

109
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,258
- I love Grandma but she can
be a real pain in the ass.

110
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:59,841
- Agreed, and watch your mouth.

111
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:02,986
Lunch is served.

112
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:04,865
- So, what set off the
explosion this time?

113
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,706
- Well, let's just say things
are a little tight right now

114
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:10,663
and I thought I could
ask Grandma for help.

115
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,069
Big mistake.
(light dramatic music)

116
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:14,449
- But you never ask anybody for help.

117
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:15,536
Just how broke are we?

118
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,248
- Let's just say the bank
would really appreciate

119
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,528
a mortgage payment as soon as possible.

120
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:20,570
You think if I ask the manager out,

121
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,309
he might give us a break?

122
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,477
- That's not funny.

123
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:26,943
I'm old enough to handle some
of the problems around here.

124
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:28,421
- Uh-uh, problems are my department.

125
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:30,680
Your job is to pretend like
you're getting an education

126
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,601
and to drive me crazy, which, by the way,

127
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,101
you do quite well.

128
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:40,476
- 3,280 dollars, Jesus, Mom.

129
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:42,556
- With interest accruing weekly.

130
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,263
- Are they gonna kick us outta the house?

131
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:47,810
- No, no way, this is our house, kiddo.

132
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,019
I'm not gonna let that happen, okay?

133
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:54,186
I just have to win the lottery
by Friday, we'll be fine.

134
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,059
- I'm gonna help out, I promise.

135
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,559
- Okay, thank you.

136
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:16,207
- Yeah, you know that
job you told me about?

137
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,427
Yeah, I'm interested.

138
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:19,844
Okay, 20 minutes.

139
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:28,007
- So, what do you need the bucks for?

140
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:30,261
Did you get a girl pregnant or something?

141
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:31,827
(chuckling) As if...

142
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:34,080
- It doesn't matter what it's for.

143
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,165
- I'm just saying,
Steve's kinda particular

144
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:37,292
about who does his deliveries.

145
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:40,065
You two may not get along,
you're not exactly his type.

146
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:42,223
- I wanna work for him, not kiss him.

147
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:46,984
- (scoffs) Shit, don't say
that kinda shit to his face.

148
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:48,546
Piss this guy off, he's
gonna have your gonads

149
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,129
on a butcher block.

150
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,605
(tires screeching)

151
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:59,355
(dramatic music)

152
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:17,911
- [Carey] He doesn't look that tough.

153
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:20,540
- Yeah, well he shot
two guys that I know of.

154
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,790
One of 'em died, just be cool, alright?

155
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:33,771
(exhaling loudly)

156
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:36,758
'Sup man?
- 'Sup, baby?

157
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,197
Is this him?

158
00:10:39,197 --> 00:10:40,030
- Yup.

159
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:48,682
- Boyd tells me you need some cash.

160
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,245
Well, how much?

161
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:53,078
- 3,000.

162
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:56,953
- I ain't gonna pay you no 3,000 okay?

163
00:10:56,953 --> 00:11:00,343
But I will give you 200 for
making a delivery for me.

164
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,760
It won't take you 30 minutes.

165
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,220
- What's in it?

166
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,929
- Who gives a damn?

167
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:11,762
- I do.

168
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:16,563
- You are the wrong guy for this job.

169
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:20,086
Boyd, do you know any more
assholes who don't like cash?

170
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:24,071
- Look, I don't give a
shit what it is, it's just,

171
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:25,869
I'm gonna need more than 200.

172
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,072
- Well, you're gonna have
to make more deliveries

173
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:28,572
for me, won't you?

174
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:32,913
If, if you do a good job for me this time.

175
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:38,976
Here's the address.
(dramatic music)

176
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,473
- Steve said the guy'd be here at one.

177
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:05,541
It's ten after and I don't see shit.

178
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,291
- You're in this now.

179
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:11,801
Go check it out.

180
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:14,801
(suspenseful music)

181
00:12:55,745 --> 00:13:00,055
(hitting loudly and grunting)

182
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:04,222
(punching and kicking)
(grunting loudly)

183
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:19,706
(dog barking)

184
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:45,447
(knocking on door)

185
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:48,530
(elegant jazz music)

186
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:53,172
- Whoa.
- You must be Quinn?

187
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:54,005
- Yeah.

188
00:13:56,814 --> 00:14:00,200
Frank never sent anybody
that looked like you before.

189
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,907
Usually get the broken
noses with the silk suits.

190
00:14:03,907 --> 00:14:05,602
- You and Frank have been
working for a long time

191
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:08,850
so maybe he just thinks
you've earned a bonus?

192
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,350
- And that bonus would be you?

193
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:16,713
- What, are you gonna count it all here?

194
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:18,796
- Nope, lost time for me.

195
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:26,195
A gentleman always
offers the lady a glass.

196
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:29,445
- Sorry, sometimes I forget my manners.

197
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:40,637
(seductive music)

198
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:50,379
I gotta remember to thank Frank for this.

199
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:53,065
- Thank you, ching ching.

200
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:53,898
- Yeah.

201
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,791
(smooching)

202
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,224
Ahh, take it easy with that.

203
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:11,130
Men like you always like to be treated

204
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,297
like bad, bad little boys.

205
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,782
- What do you mean men like me?

206
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:22,310
- I mean lying assholes

207
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,173
who try to screw over their
boss and get away with it.

208
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:28,214
(dramatic music)

209
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:30,631
- What are you talking about?

210
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:35,115
(gagging)

211
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:42,501
- You've been skimming
for the past six months.

212
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,458
You're not even ambitious.

213
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:52,445
3,000 here, 7,000 there when
you're carrying a million?

214
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:54,745
Hey, what is that.

215
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,503
(muffled mumbling)

216
00:15:56,503 --> 00:15:57,807
- You know what?

217
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:59,057
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

218
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,267
- I've always felt that
it was so important

219
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:06,267
that a man knows why he's gonna die.

220
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:09,362
(groaning)

221
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,986
So, maybe you're not gonna be
so stupid in your next life.

222
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:15,319
(gun bangs)

223
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:20,823
(dramatic music)

224
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:22,331
- Jimmy, it's me.

225
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:23,199
- There's not a problem, is there?

226
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,891
- Just took me a while to say goodbye.

227
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,677
- So, everything worked out?

228
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,664
- Yeah, everything worked out.

229
00:16:28,664 --> 00:16:31,964
I'll see you in 24 hours, okay?

230
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:34,637
I kiss you, I miss you, bu-bye.

231
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:35,470
- Bye.

232
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:01,479
- Do you know what time it is?

233
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,630
It's way past your curfew, Carey.

234
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,927
- Sorry.

235
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:07,272
- Well, where have you been?

236
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:09,832
Can you look at me when
I'm talking to you?

237
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:10,697
- I hung out with Boyd for a while.

238
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,697
It wasn't very much fun.

239
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,351
- Carey, what happened and
what is going on with you?

240
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:19,744
- Jesus Christ.

241
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:21,805
(tires screeching)
(gun firing)

242
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:25,898
(windows shattering)
(dramatic music)

243
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:27,584
Down, stay there, they
might still be out there.

244
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:30,053
- It's alright, Mom, I'm okay.

245
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:32,970
(tires screeching)

246
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:39,123
- My God, did you get a license plate?

247
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:40,135
- We don't need one.

248
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:40,968
- What do you mean we don't need one?

249
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:43,571
How will the police know who did it?

250
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,413
Do you know who did this?

251
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,399
Is that what this is about?

252
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,316
Talk to me!

253
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:52,031
Did Boyd do this?

254
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,280
Did you get in some stupid fight with Boyd

255
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,759
and he comes back to kill you?

256
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,711
- It wasn't Boyd.

257
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,878
- Explain it to me, Carey.

258
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:02,953
- I did something really stupid today.

259
00:18:02,953 --> 00:18:05,426
I tried to do a guy this
favor by delivering a package

260
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:07,464
and it got all screwed up.

261
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:09,703
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, delivery
for what and to who?

262
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:12,372
- This guy Steve, he gave
me a package of cocaine

263
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:15,045
and I got robbed and I
never made the delivery

264
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:17,054
and he probably thinks I ripped him off.

265
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:17,887
- Cocaine?

266
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:21,241
Is that what this is about,
you're dealing drugs now?

267
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:23,152
What is in your head?

268
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,356
God.

269
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:27,506
- You said we needed the
money, I thought I was helping.

270
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,633
- So this was Steve.

271
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:30,191
- Yes but I can get the
whole things straightened out

272
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:31,256
with one phone call.

273
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:32,708
- Me first.
- No, Mom.

274
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,701
If you call the police,
they're going to arrest me

275
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,616
and send me away for a hundred years.

276
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,476
- No, Carey, they're probably
going to give you probation,

277
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:41,309
which is exactly what you deserve.

278
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:45,239
Okay, let's just think about
this for a second, okay?

279
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:49,406
- Mom, Steve's a dealer,
they'll get me on transporting.

280
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:55,145
- How could you do this to us, Carey?

281
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,425
- I know I'm a drain on your money

282
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:03,942
and I thought I could make
some of that up by doing this.

283
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,419
I didn't think.

284
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:08,400
- Look, I know that I lay a
lot of problems on you, okay?

285
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,288
And I know that you were
just trying to help.

286
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:11,934
You're a good kid but you know what?

287
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:16,577
The stunt that you pulled tonight
was stupid, really stupid.

288
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:17,827
- I'm so sorry.

289
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,117
- Okay, wipe your eyes.

290
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:27,842
I still gotta make that phone
call, hand me the phone.

291
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:43,756
Operator, I need to place a
person-to-person call, please.

292
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,339
San Antonio, Texas.

293
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,342
Mrs. Iris Adams.

294
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:11,125
- Get a good shot of that entrance wound.

295
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,708
I wanna see those powder burns.

296
00:20:18,189 --> 00:20:21,022
My, my, my, the games people play.

297
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:25,888
What do you think, Victoria's Secret?

298
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:27,805
- Yup, 70 bucks a pair.

299
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:32,400
My wife likes 'em.

300
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,064
Whoever your killer is, we found red

301
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:37,952
and bleached blonde hair
strands in the sink.

302
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:38,945
- Hey, Miller?
- Yeah.

303
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:41,266
- Make sure we get a good
description from the hotel staff

304
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:42,765
for a composite, okay?

305
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:43,598
- [Miller] Yeah, detective.

306
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:45,141
- So what's the deal, Stan,
girls like to wash their hair

307
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,459
before or after they
shoot a guy in the face?

308
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:51,337
- Definitely after,
this babe took her time.

309
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,244
She really liked doing this guy.

310
00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:54,246
The prints are all smudged in there

311
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:57,194
so I'm gonna get on the FBI
and have them move their ass.

312
00:20:57,194 --> 00:21:00,409
I'll see if we can have them photo match.

313
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:01,787
- I guess safe sex means having to wear

314
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:03,093
a bullet-proof vest these days.

315
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:05,343
(laughing)

316
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,590
(light dramatic music)

317
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:39,514
- Mr. Bianci, this is
Darrell at the hotel.

318
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:42,255
Your hot little friend just left.

319
00:21:42,255 --> 00:21:45,359
She got a cab to Union Station, sir.

320
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,200
- Does everybody in this
room know what happened?

321
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,827
Quinn paid off like he was supposed to.

322
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,896
That bitch, Jayne Ferre,
I sent to whack him

323
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,136
took the drop herself, is
walking around with my money.

324
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:57,126
Now, I know you worked with Jayne

325
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:58,825
when she used to do freelance jobs for us.

326
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,301
You know how she thinks

327
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:03,538
and she's got a nuclear fucking
device between her legs.

328
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:07,376
That's how she got Quinn, that's
not how she's gonna get me.

329
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:08,468
You're gonna take care of this?

330
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:09,772
- Yeah, we'll take care of this, Frank.

331
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:10,780
- Yeah?

332
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,470
- Take care of it.

333
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,720
(mumbling)

334
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,650
(light dramatic music)

335
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,284
- Hi baby, it's me.

336
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,748
- I know you and Grandma
have been fighting a lot

337
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:25,916
but it'll be nice to see the old pain.

338
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,843
- Don't worry about me,
Carey, this isn't a vacation.

339
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:31,274
I called your grandmother
because we need a place to stay.

340
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:33,341
Our house is no longer safe.

341
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:34,785
Does any of this ring a bell?

342
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:35,787
- Yes, ma'am.

343
00:23:35,787 --> 00:23:38,620
- I kiss you, I love you, bye-bye.

344
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:46,041
- Your grandmother knows
what you've been up to

345
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,996
and she isn't too happy

346
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:49,829
with either one of us.

347
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:14,521
(stabbing and grunting)

348
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:20,207
- Check down there.

349
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:23,457
(light dramatic music)

350
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:29,380
- Still, San Antonio's cool

351
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,522
and it'll be nice for us to
spend some time together.

352
00:24:31,522 --> 00:24:35,605
- Oh yeah, it'll be one
big happy family reunion.

353
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:37,892
Let's just hope we don't
have to suffer the wrath

354
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:39,599
of your grandmother's moon pie.

355
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,598
- Pardon me, I think you
can go to the counter now.

356
00:24:41,598 --> 00:24:42,598
- Oh, sorry.

357
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,314
Hello uh, Shaw, I have reservations

358
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:48,994
for the next train to San Antonio, please.

359
00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:50,411
- [Woman] Shaw...

360
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:53,810
(gasping)
- Sorry, miss.

361
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,714
- These are electronic tickets

362
00:24:54,714 --> 00:24:56,125
and your credit card was denied.

363
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,665
- What?

364
00:24:57,665 --> 00:25:00,229
That can't be right, please, try it again.

365
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:03,195
This card is up to date, there
shouldn't be any problem.

366
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:05,798
- She's gotta be here somewhere.

367
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:07,360
- Transaction denied.

368
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,312
We have two seats left, can
you pay for them or not?

369
00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:11,697
There are other people who
want tickets on this train.

370
00:25:11,697 --> 00:25:13,261
There's another one tomorrow at noon.

371
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,953
Perhaps you can get the fare by then.

372
00:25:14,953 --> 00:25:17,786
- Great, thanks for all your help.

373
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,374
- [Carey] What are we gonna do now?

374
00:25:22,374 --> 00:25:23,242
- We're gonna drive.

375
00:25:23,242 --> 00:25:24,762
- All the way to San Antonio?

376
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:26,994
- It's not that far, where's
your spirit of adventure?

377
00:25:26,994 --> 00:25:27,894
It'll be fun.

378
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:30,536
I'll be Butch Cassidy and you
can be Sundance Kid, let's go.

379
00:25:30,536 --> 00:25:32,036
- Who?
- Forget it.

380
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:39,903
We can make it, we can
scrape together enough

381
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:42,008
so we eat at Burger King once.

382
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,998
- Maybe Grandma can help
us out with some bucks.

383
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:45,669
- The last thing your
grandmother is gonna do

384
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,835
is pay for our fare when she
thinks we've mooched off--

385
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:49,128
- Oh, I'm sorry!

386
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:51,545
- It's okay, are you alright?

387
00:25:52,746 --> 00:25:55,776
- As a matter of fact, no,
I'm not doing too well.

388
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:57,379
I'm in a real jam.

389
00:25:57,379 --> 00:25:59,614
My sister just had a coronary this morning

390
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:02,148
and she's my only kin and
she's been asking for me.

391
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:04,340
So I've got to see her, I
was gonna take the train

392
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,110
to San Antonio but now
that it's sold out, I mean,

393
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,943
I didn't book my ticket
in advance, I blew it.

394
00:26:14,564 --> 00:26:17,029
I couldn't help but
overhear what you two said

395
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:20,862
at the counter and I
know it is forward to ask

396
00:26:22,862 --> 00:26:26,919
but would you like to
have a traveling buddy?

397
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,304
I'd gladly pay for the gas
and the travel expenses

398
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:32,430
and I'll pay for the cost
of your ticket, of course.

399
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,751
- You know, there are a
lot of car rental services

400
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:36,144
here at the station.

401
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,092
- My driver's license is expired.

402
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:40,195
If I get pulled over,
it's just gonna be a mess.

403
00:26:40,195 --> 00:26:41,365
- I'm sorry, but--

404
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:42,989
- Come on, Mom, she's in a bind.

405
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:44,185
- What am I gonna do?

406
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,010
I mean, my sister is in intensive care

407
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,088
and I might never see her again.

408
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:50,538
I mean, the doctor is so pessimistic.

409
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:53,788
- Lighten up, Mom, be a Good Samaritan.

410
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,064
- What's your name?

411
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:57,686
- Jeanquis Dumois.

412
00:26:57,686 --> 00:26:59,115
- Well, that's pretty unusual.

413
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:02,948
- I'm an actress, they
call me Jayne with a Y.

414
00:27:05,762 --> 00:27:08,063
- Okay, Jayne with a Y, why not?

415
00:27:08,063 --> 00:27:09,143
Another driver would be nice

416
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:11,063
and we really could use the money.

417
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,418
We're on our way to San
Antonio to see my mother.

418
00:27:13,418 --> 00:27:15,281
- Well, that's perfect, this is so sweet.

419
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:18,114
Okay partners, let's hit the road.

420
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:21,946
- We're just in lot eight.

421
00:27:21,946 --> 00:27:24,783
I'm Emily Shaw and this is my son, Carey.

422
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:27,606
- It is so nice to meet you, very nice.

423
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:28,598
- Hey, let me help you with that.

424
00:27:28,598 --> 00:27:29,859
- [Jayne] Oh, yeah.

425
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:32,609
(dramatic music)

426
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:34,998
- There's three of you guys.

427
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:36,363
You got three guns against one broad

428
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,034
and she takes one of you out?

429
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:40,486
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,
are you the Three Stooges

430
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:41,900
or are you professionals?

431
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,873
Now you're telling me she left
the god damned train station?

432
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,381
Find her, okay?

433
00:27:48,381 --> 00:27:52,548
Find her, I want this bitch's
head on my kitchen table.

434
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:05,792
- Do you mind?

435
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,397
- What movies were you in?

436
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:15,251
- Mostly arties, independent productions.

437
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:17,312
You probably haven't seen any of them.

438
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:19,658
- Don't bet on it, my son is an authority

439
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:22,554
on any female who's ever
stood in front of the camera.

440
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:26,765
Actresses, if they're hot,
rock stars, supermodels,

441
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:29,560
oh, and let's not forget anybody
who's ever been in Playboy.

442
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,774
- God, Mom, I'm not a total dork, okay?

443
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:35,965
- I don't think you're a dork.

444
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,075
And you?

445
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:39,610
You're a real television Mom.

446
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,783
- What's that supposed to mean?

447
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:42,603
- Hey, it's a compliment.

448
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:46,879
I mean, you're taking care
of the house and the kid,

449
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:51,046
this station wagon work,
just not my thing, you know?

450
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,023
- Mark?

451
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:06,509
These are the reports we
just received from Dallas,

452
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:08,692
Chicago, and New York.

453
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:12,299
We've got several killings
from the last couple years,

454
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:15,444
all male victims, wrists
handcuffed, then shot,

455
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:19,406
all the victims had ladies'
panties in their mouths,

456
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:21,264
and all had criminal records.

457
00:29:21,264 --> 00:29:22,681
Meet Jayne Ferre.

458
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,012
- My, my, my.

459
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:28,570
- Yeah, beauty and the beast

460
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,070
rolled into one nasty package.

461
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:35,746
One guess who Chicago PD
say she used to soldier for.

462
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:37,324
- Don't tell me it's Frank Bianci.

463
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:38,914
It's too early in the
morning for that shit.

464
00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:40,631
- Is this fresh?

465
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:42,140
- Help yourself.

466
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,616
- Yeah, our dead friend in the hotel

467
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,372
used to work with Bianci, too.

468
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:49,344
She whacked him last night
then she did that gorilla

469
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:52,660
over at the station this morning.

470
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,789
We found a hair sample on his clothes

471
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:55,531
that matched what we found in the sink.

472
00:29:55,531 --> 00:29:57,693
- So, why the train?

473
00:29:57,693 --> 00:29:59,120
- Probably thought the security

474
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,606
might be easier to get through?

475
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:03,592
We've got some surveillance
tapes from Union Station.

476
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:06,192
She followed some woman and a teenage boy

477
00:30:06,192 --> 00:30:09,609
out to the parking lot and left with 'em.

478
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,326
- We'll get this photo
out to the highway patrol.

479
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:14,871
I'll call the state police.

480
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:17,538
Stan, I don't want her arrested.

481
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:22,486
She may be traveling with this
woman or taking her hostage.

482
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:25,373
Let's just locate her
and move on her quietly.

483
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:28,564
The last thing we need's
another bloodbath.

484
00:30:28,564 --> 00:30:30,897
- Yeah, that's a good point.

485
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:41,219
(coughing)

486
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:42,969
- I'm done, I'm done.

487
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:53,295
Hi.

488
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:54,261
- Where in the hell have you been?

489
00:30:54,261 --> 00:30:55,248
- I had a little problem.

490
00:30:55,248 --> 00:30:58,178
I cannot talk now but um, I have to drive.

491
00:30:58,178 --> 00:30:59,371
- Drive?

492
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:00,887
Jayne, I don't wanna hear this shit.

493
00:31:00,887 --> 00:31:02,948
What about the money, who are you with?

494
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,226
We have a deal.

495
00:31:04,226 --> 00:31:05,548
- I'm with my brand new friends

496
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:08,238
and everything's fantastic.

497
00:31:08,238 --> 00:31:10,278
You know, I'll call you
when we hit New Mexico.

498
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:11,557
How much time you think it will be?

499
00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:13,304
- [Emily] Uhh, about three hours.

500
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,943
- [Jayne] I'll call you
back in three hours.

501
00:31:14,943 --> 00:31:18,860
- Jayne, this is bullshit,
now what's goin' on?

502
00:31:20,702 --> 00:31:22,535
- Yeah, so how is she?

503
00:31:25,164 --> 00:31:27,473
Is she still in ICU?

504
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:29,604
Okay, well listen to me, okay?

505
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:31,724
You tell her that I'm on my way

506
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:34,447
and you tell her that I
love her so much, okay?

507
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:37,185
You tell her that, you promise?

508
00:31:37,185 --> 00:31:38,018
Okay, bye.

509
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:42,624
- How's your sister?

510
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:45,877
- Bad, the sooner we get
to Texas, the better it is.

511
00:31:45,877 --> 00:31:47,270
- You know, I used to live in San Antonio

512
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,560
when I was first married,
what hospital is she in?

513
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,106
- Umm, San Antonio Hospital?

514
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:54,080
- Really?

515
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,922
Well, I don't know that one.

516
00:31:54,922 --> 00:31:58,157
Are you sure you don't mean
St. Mary City Hospital?

517
00:31:58,157 --> 00:32:00,026
- Is this an interrogation, Emily?

518
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:04,193
- Uh, no, no, I'm sorry,
it's none of my business.

519
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:12,236
How old are you, Carey?

520
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:13,069
- 16.

521
00:32:13,963 --> 00:32:15,880
- Did you have sex yet?

522
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,238
- Excuse me.

523
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:19,905
- It will come soon.

524
00:32:20,794 --> 00:32:23,877
Sorry, Mommy, I didn't mean anything.

525
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:29,297
So, why are you two going
to Texas, what's your story?

526
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:31,168
- I got in a little trouble back home.

527
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:32,768
- I thought it would be nice for Carey

528
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,793
to spend some time with his grandmother.

529
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:35,822
- What happened to the marriage?

530
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:38,364
Did he drink, gamble, cocaine,

531
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:40,772
or just a fucking asshole like the others?

532
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,569
- Well, a little bit
of all three, I guess,

533
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:46,236
and do you mind with
the language, you know?

534
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:51,162
(dramatic music)

535
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:52,202
Steve?

536
00:32:52,202 --> 00:32:55,265
(suspenseful music)

537
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,098
Honey?

538
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:03,220
Steve?

539
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:08,149
Fucking suck.

540
00:33:11,455 --> 00:33:15,205
- Men suck, they're
lying, cheating scumbags.

541
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,122
Do you love your Dad, Carey?

542
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,183
- Well, I don't see him very much

543
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:22,441
but he's basically a reformed asshole

544
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:25,219
so he can teach me not to get
into deep shit all the time.

545
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:28,448
- Hey, enough with the garbage mouth.

546
00:33:28,448 --> 00:33:30,333
- I piss my Mom off a lot.

547
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,294
- Well, you know what?

548
00:33:31,294 --> 00:33:32,767
I piss my Mom off, too.

549
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:35,565
(giggling)

550
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:38,815
(light dramatic music)

551
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,355
(chattering)

552
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:49,674
(phone ringing)

553
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:51,183
- Winston.

554
00:33:51,183 --> 00:33:52,016
Uh-huh.

555
00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:55,786
- So, are you sure this cop

556
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:57,449
doesn't have his head up his ass?

557
00:33:57,449 --> 00:33:58,411
- Yeah, it's them.

558
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,698
We ran the plates and have an
ID on the people she's with.

559
00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:04,341
Woman by the name of Emily Shaw.

560
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:06,516
The kid's her son.

561
00:34:06,516 --> 00:34:09,157
We don't know if Jayne's
holding them or not.

562
00:34:09,157 --> 00:34:11,097
I gave orders to back off.

563
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:14,237
Last sighting was about 40
miles outside of Prima Point.

564
00:34:14,237 --> 00:34:15,775
- Okay, I'll take it from here.

565
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,948
- We still have a deal, right?

566
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:19,620
- You nail her, I still get my end.

567
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,701
- You've been on the
organization's payroll 10 years.

568
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:24,201
You still have to ask me that?

569
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:27,682
(phone ringing)

570
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:28,515
- Yeah?

571
00:34:28,515 --> 00:34:31,361
- Listen up, the bitch is
somewhere east of Prima Point

572
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,770
in a piece of shit gold Toyota Corolla

573
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,066
with a broad and a kid, get there.

574
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:38,459
- Well, they already got a half day on us.

575
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:41,887
- This is a no-excuse
situation, get there now!

576
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:42,970
- Okay, okay.

577
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:47,634
Gold Toyota Corolla shouldn't
be that hard to spot.

578
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:48,673
What about the Mom and her kid?

579
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:49,923
- No witnesses.

580
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:52,228
- Why don't you make yourself useful

581
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:55,030
and find out where the
fuck Prima Point is, huh?

582
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,947
(tires screeching)

583
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:06,032
(light dramatic music)

584
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:11,006
- Emily, you don't think we
could push it just a little?

585
00:35:11,006 --> 00:35:14,129
Because at this rate, we
won't be in Texas for a week.

586
00:35:14,129 --> 00:35:17,774
- We'll get there but this
car doesn't push, sorry.

587
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:20,525
- It's just that I wanna
get out of this damn state.

588
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:21,413
There's nothing but low-lifes

589
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:23,738
and scumbags as far as I can see.

590
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:27,571
- Geez, does that attitude
help you get parts?

591
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,973
- I'm going to tell you the truth.

592
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:36,223
(light dramatic music)

593
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:42,578
I'm a syndicate hit woman and
I've killed over 20 people.

594
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:44,815
Actually 21 with the guy I
just stabbed this morning

595
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:47,025
at the train station.

596
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:49,130
Yesterday, I shot a crime
boss and I stole from him

597
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,820
a million dollars in cash.

598
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,060
The mob's killers are after me

599
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,310
and now your lives are in grave danger.

600
00:35:59,388 --> 00:36:01,638
(laughing)

601
00:36:03,137 --> 00:36:04,536
- Funny, Jayne.

602
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:07,057
(laughing)

603
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:09,400
- Well, it's just the
best I could come up with.

604
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,279
- It's very good.

605
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:12,529
(laughing)

606
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,251
- Okay, who's starving?

607
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:16,299
- Me.

608
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,617
- We're not gonna stop,
wait until we cross

609
00:36:18,617 --> 00:36:20,223
the state line at least.

610
00:36:20,223 --> 00:36:21,695
- I can't do it, Jayne, I'm sorry.

611
00:36:21,695 --> 00:36:23,730
When she says she's
empty, she ain't lyin'.

612
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,708
- Okay, let's fill her
up and then we get going

613
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,596
and we make up some time, okay?

614
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:31,763
- Okay, thanks for your
permission and the advice.

615
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:49,845
(light dramatic music)

616
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:54,553
- Jesus H. Christ.

617
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:59,950
I mean, my brain is gonna fry
before we find this bitch.

618
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,129
- God, I told you the food
would suck, it's crap.

619
00:37:03,129 --> 00:37:05,740
- It's available, and when it's
the only food you can find,

620
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,147
well, that makes it
pretty good if you ask me.

621
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:09,530
- Well, I don't recall asking you.

622
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,363
- Oh, really?

623
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:14,695
- If you two don't stop, I'm
gonna put you both in timeout.

624
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:17,762
- You're right, Dad, I'm sorry about that.

625
00:37:17,762 --> 00:37:19,977
It's no big deal, I don't
wanna sound picky, Emily,

626
00:37:19,977 --> 00:37:22,313
but it's just like, I'm used
to the finer things in life

627
00:37:22,313 --> 00:37:24,982
and good food is just
one of those delights.

628
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:26,192
- Oh, really?

629
00:37:26,192 --> 00:37:29,173
Okay, well, baby you can
stay here with her highness

630
00:37:29,173 --> 00:37:31,756
while I go to the ladies'
room and then pay our check.

631
00:37:31,756 --> 00:37:35,923
- Hey, this is for the gas
and the lunch is on me.

632
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:42,484
- Pretty generous, Jayne.

633
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:45,109
- Generous deserves generous.

634
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:46,359
- Okay, thanks.

635
00:37:49,448 --> 00:37:50,531
I'll be back.

636
00:37:54,765 --> 00:37:56,866
- Can I confide something in you?

637
00:37:56,866 --> 00:37:58,199
- Sure, I guess.

638
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:02,807
- You look exactly like
my first boyfriend.

639
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:05,557
Same deep eyes, yeah, same smile.

640
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,046
I guess you never forget
your first love, Carey.

641
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:12,718
- I wouldn't know.

642
00:38:12,718 --> 00:38:14,652
- Of course you will.

643
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:17,143
Women are just gonna eat you up.

644
00:38:17,143 --> 00:38:18,887
You know that, right?

645
00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:20,220
- IF you say so.

646
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:27,441
- So, tell me about the girls at school.

647
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:29,147
Come on.

648
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:33,642
- I don't think I can
talk to you about this.

649
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:36,355
I mean, my Mom would be really
pissed if she found out.

650
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,446
- Well you know what?

651
00:38:37,446 --> 00:38:39,863
Your Mom's not here, come on.

652
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:44,668
This is gonna be between you and me.

653
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:51,185
- Um, what do you wanna know?

654
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:56,332
- Well, for instance, have you
ever felt a woman's breast?

655
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:04,796
Do you like mine?

656
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,345
- They're beautiful.

657
00:39:14,763 --> 00:39:17,279
- Well, we're all set
if you two are finished.

658
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:18,764
I mean, I know you're in a real hurry.

659
00:39:18,764 --> 00:39:20,670
- Yeah, I'm ready, Carey?

660
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,753
- Yes, ma'am.

661
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,151
- Carey said he was in
some kind of trouble

662
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:28,714
but he wouldn't say what.

663
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,172
I mean, obviously he's a very good kid,

664
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:33,090
it couldn't be that bad.

665
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,394
- Yes, he is a very good kid but um,

666
00:39:35,394 --> 00:39:39,311
it's kind of family
business if you don't mind.

667
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,532
- You know, kids get into
trouble when they're a teen

668
00:39:43,532 --> 00:39:45,175
and it's okay, it's normal.

669
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,242
Carey shouldn't feel guilty.

670
00:39:47,242 --> 00:39:48,843
He should be able to be himself.

671
00:39:48,843 --> 00:39:49,927
- Okay, I know it's normal

672
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:52,233
but it's between me and Carey, okay?

673
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:54,379
- Okay, it's just like, I hated it

674
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:55,652
when my Mom wouldn't get off my back.

675
00:39:55,652 --> 00:39:56,485
(loud rock music)

676
00:39:56,485 --> 00:39:57,492
(tires screeching and horn honking)

677
00:39:57,492 --> 00:39:58,492
Hey!
- Sorry!

678
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:01,342
(glass shattering)

679
00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:02,175
What are you doing?

680
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:05,592
You coulda killed me you fucking asshole.

681
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:08,300
Did you see that?

682
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,154
Limp bastard almost killed me.

683
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:12,806
I should rip his fucking head off.

684
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:14,582
- Well, you scared him
half to death anyway.

685
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:15,645
At least you're not hurt.

686
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:17,965
- Of course I'm hurt, what do you think?

687
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:20,319
He's not gonna get away
with this, let's go.

688
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,069
(dramatic music)

689
00:40:31,225 --> 00:40:33,736
We've gotta catch this
motherfucker son of a bitch.

690
00:40:33,736 --> 00:40:36,569
- Can we just let this go, please?

691
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:39,225
(engine racing)
- What are you doing?

692
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:40,058
Jesus!

693
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:43,539
Jayne!

694
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:44,706
Get off of it.

695
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:52,066
If you ever pull a stunt like that again,

696
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,826
I will throw you out of this car

697
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:57,904
and I will make you walk,
do you understand me?

698
00:40:57,904 --> 00:40:59,654
Do you understand me?

699
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:02,935
You may not have any regard for your life

700
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:05,478
but I am not gonna let
you kill my son and me

701
00:41:05,478 --> 00:41:07,648
and if you would like to continue
riding through the desert

702
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:09,192
instead of walking, then I suggest

703
00:41:09,192 --> 00:41:11,376
you get your act together.

704
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:14,293
- I'm sorry, Emily, I'm very sorry.

705
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:17,848
It's just all these things
with my sister, I mean,

706
00:41:17,848 --> 00:41:21,518
we're so close and I'm so sad and upset.

707
00:41:21,518 --> 00:41:24,351
Please, don't leave me here alone.

708
00:41:26,248 --> 00:41:27,635
- Jayne, I can't--
- I'm sorry.

709
00:41:27,635 --> 00:41:31,802
I'm sorry, everything is
gonna be fine, I promise.

710
00:41:34,446 --> 00:41:36,913
- Alright but any more bullshit

711
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:40,240
and I mean any more bullshit
and I will pull this car over

712
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
and let you out, agreed?

713
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:45,330
I mean this and I don't swear.

714
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,129
- [Jayne] I know you mean this,
everything's gonna be fine.

715
00:41:48,129 --> 00:41:49,379
I swear to God.

716
00:41:50,415 --> 00:41:53,082
- Fine, let's just get to Texas.

717
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:56,001
- I bet nobody screws with you

718
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:58,133
without you ripping them a new A-hole.

719
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,883
- I still have my hearing, Carey.

720
00:42:02,685 --> 00:42:04,507
(engine clunking)

721
00:42:04,507 --> 00:42:06,503
Oh no, oh God.

722
00:42:06,503 --> 00:42:08,503
That did not sound good.

723
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,523
- [Carey] Overheated?

724
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:13,854
- No, I think a lot worse than that.

725
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:16,604
(dramatic music)

726
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:22,397
- [Jayne] What's wrong with it?

727
00:42:22,397 --> 00:42:23,696
- [Emily] What do you think,
kiddo, did we throw a rod

728
00:42:23,696 --> 00:42:25,762
or is it the thermostat?

729
00:42:25,762 --> 00:42:27,255
- [Carey] I don't know,
Mom, you're the gearhead.

730
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:30,097
- [Emily] It's not the
rod 'cause we got oil.

731
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:32,964
- Jesus, we're stuck in
the middle of nowhere.

732
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:35,030
Where the hell are we
gonna find a mechanic?

733
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,863
- Well, let's try your cell phone.

734
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,849
- Out of service area,
Jesus, this is unbelievable.

735
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:44,936
- Maybe somebody back at the restaurant

736
00:42:44,936 --> 00:42:45,893
would know who to call.

737
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:47,688
- It's 20 miles back.

738
00:42:47,688 --> 00:42:49,605
- I'll flag down a car.

739
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,523
- Hey!

740
00:42:58,815 --> 00:43:01,637
- We shoulda caught up to 'em by now.

741
00:43:01,637 --> 00:43:03,766
This is the only place for miles.

742
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:06,992
Let's see if these rednecks know anything.

743
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:09,742
(dramatic music)

744
00:43:25,556 --> 00:43:28,723
(engine racing)
- Hey!

745
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:32,479
- We have to get out of here.

746
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,432
- Then we better start walking.

747
00:43:33,432 --> 00:43:36,360
- I told you it's 20 miles back, wake up.

748
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,193
- Well you know what?

749
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:38,698
Somebody should stay here with the car.

750
00:43:38,698 --> 00:43:40,671
So why don't you hang
out and with any luck,

751
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,323
we'll be back for you in a few hours.

752
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:45,228
- Oh no, no, no, no, you're
not leaving me here alone

753
00:43:45,228 --> 00:43:47,016
in the middle of nowhere, no way.

754
00:43:47,016 --> 00:43:47,900
Then move it.

755
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,311
The faster we get back to the restaurant,

756
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:52,172
the faster we can get
the car fixed, princess.

757
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:54,922
(dramatic music)

758
00:44:08,868 --> 00:44:10,602
- Some dirtbag says he saw
'em here not an hour ago

759
00:44:10,602 --> 00:44:11,685
headed south.

760
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:16,091
Apparently, Jayne went
apeshit on some guy's jeep.

761
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:19,478
Messed up his windshield
with her fucking fist.

762
00:44:19,478 --> 00:44:22,145
I still like that fucking broad.

763
00:44:28,385 --> 00:44:29,829
- [Emily] That's the
fifth car that's passed.

764
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:32,482
These people don't even look twice.

765
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:34,146
- How far do you think we've gone?

766
00:44:34,146 --> 00:44:36,515
- Probably about three miles.

767
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:37,901
- I think I'm gonna die out here.

768
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:40,311
- That's entirely probable.

769
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,811
- Hey, here comes another car.

770
00:44:44,756 --> 00:44:46,938
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey!

771
00:44:46,938 --> 00:44:49,355
- Slow down!
- Hey, stop, hey!

772
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,247
- Get out of my way, you
guys, I know how to do this.

773
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:00,327
- Oh, brother.

774
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:04,160
Give me a break, it's
the way the world works.

775
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:07,928
See?

776
00:45:09,236 --> 00:45:10,069
Hello.

777
00:45:13,705 --> 00:45:14,702
- Is there a problem, ladies?

778
00:45:14,702 --> 00:45:16,227
- Yeah, thank God, our car broke down

779
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:17,867
about three miles that way.

780
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:19,263
- Hop on in and we'll go take a look.

781
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,077
- Thank God, thank me.

782
00:45:21,077 --> 00:45:24,077
(upbeat rock music)

783
00:45:43,637 --> 00:45:46,387
(dramatic music)

784
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,311
- Well Bob, it's real quaint, isn't it?

785
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:32,172
- Bob's dead.

786
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:33,064
Blind drunk by dinnertime

787
00:46:33,064 --> 00:46:34,430
but he sure knew his way around cars

788
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,728
and I could tell you what
he'd say about this one.

789
00:46:36,728 --> 00:46:38,007
- [Emily] Time to give it a good burial?

790
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:39,618
- Eh close, 'cause
bringin' her back to life

791
00:46:39,618 --> 00:46:41,400
is gonna take two, maybe three days.

792
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,305
- Three days?

793
00:46:42,305 --> 00:46:45,168
- Your cylinder's cracked,
your fuel injector's shot.

794
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:47,033
Look at all this oil.

795
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:47,866
I'm gonna have to do a rebuild

796
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:48,798
and I just don't have the parts, ma'am.

797
00:46:48,798 --> 00:46:50,996
- I thought it was the thermostat, Fred.

798
00:46:50,996 --> 00:46:52,988
- I think it's fucking bullshit.

799
00:46:52,988 --> 00:46:54,721
- Listen, you must have your sources

800
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:56,589
or else you and Uncle Bob
wouldn't have been able

801
00:46:56,589 --> 00:46:58,517
to stay in business
all these years, right?

802
00:46:58,517 --> 00:46:59,509
- Problem is, I just don't know

803
00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:00,691
when I'm gonna be able to get to it.

804
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:02,419
I've got this Rabbit over
here, it's been here two days.

805
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,769
My truck needs some TLC.

806
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:05,703
- Hey, you know what?

807
00:47:05,703 --> 00:47:07,504
Screw the Rabbit and screw your truck.

808
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:09,785
You're gonna have those
parts and have us on the road

809
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,726
in 24 hours and if you're trying
to screw us with the bill,

810
00:47:12,726 --> 00:47:16,476
I'm gonna be all over
you like flies on shit.

811
00:47:17,722 --> 00:47:19,818
Do you know what I mean, boy?

812
00:47:19,818 --> 00:47:21,635
- Yes, ma'am.

813
00:47:21,635 --> 00:47:23,069
Go ahead and take a room over at the motel

814
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:24,637
'til I get you fixed up.

815
00:47:24,637 --> 00:47:26,821
- I like to hear that.

816
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:28,399
So, the rooms are on the house, right?

817
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:30,552
- Absolutely, I wanna
be fair to you ladies.

818
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:31,552
- Fantastic.

819
00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:36,199
- Phew.

820
00:47:38,173 --> 00:47:41,009
- [Emily] You certainly
handled that situation, Jayne.

821
00:47:41,009 --> 00:47:42,306
- [Jayne] Let's see if
they have indoor plumbing.

822
00:47:42,306 --> 00:47:45,263
I desperately need a bath.

823
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:48,513
(light dramatic music)

824
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:58,378
(phone ringing)

825
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,211
- Hey.

826
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:00,401
- Baby, it's me, listen.

827
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:01,445
You're not gonna believe this.

828
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,849
The car I was getting a
lift in just broke down

829
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:06,101
and now I'm stuck in
the middle of nowhere.

830
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:06,934
- You're not gonna tell me

831
00:48:06,934 --> 00:48:08,577
there's a problem with the money, are you?

832
00:48:08,577 --> 00:48:11,529
- No, it's fine, it's fine,
of course I've got the money.

833
00:48:11,529 --> 00:48:12,829
What are you thinking?

834
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:14,383
I just don't know when
the car's gonna be fixed

835
00:48:14,383 --> 00:48:15,859
and time is running out

836
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:19,109
and I can feel Frank's guys closing in.

837
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:23,757
Won't your rescue me, hmm?

838
00:48:23,757 --> 00:48:25,841
(giggling)

839
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:27,315
- Alright, where is it?

840
00:48:27,315 --> 00:48:29,939
- [Jayne] Highway 54, I
think it's like 200 miles

841
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:32,862
on this side of the state line.

842
00:48:32,862 --> 00:48:34,664
- Alright, sweety, I'm on my way.

843
00:48:34,664 --> 00:48:37,331
- Okay, love you, kiss you, bye.

844
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:49,030
- You got to admit it, Mom, she's hot.

845
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,144
- I know you're in hormone overdrive.

846
00:48:51,144 --> 00:48:54,131
I've been watching you ogling her all day.

847
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,448
- I guess her Mom didn't
teach her to mind her manners.

848
00:48:56,448 --> 00:48:58,965
- Well, you can't always make
your kids do what's right.

849
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:00,920
- You mean, like me?

850
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,503
- No, I didn't mean you at all.

851
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:07,166
- I did the wrong thing.

852
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:08,907
That's why we're here in this mess

853
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:10,305
in the middle of the desert.

854
00:49:10,305 --> 00:49:13,660
(light dramatic music)
- Hey, we both screwed up.

855
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,571
I'm still trying to get the hang

856
00:49:14,571 --> 00:49:17,393
of this single-parent thing.

857
00:49:17,393 --> 00:49:19,424
- I think you're doing great.

858
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:21,147
- Great parents don't
get their houses shot up

859
00:49:21,147 --> 00:49:22,122
because they're not keeping

860
00:49:22,122 --> 00:49:25,540
a close enough eye on their kids.

861
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,707
- I'll tell Grandma it was my fault.

862
00:49:28,707 --> 00:49:30,434
- Halvsies?

863
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,517
- Mom, I really am sorry.

864
00:49:35,685 --> 00:49:37,102
- I know you are.

865
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,517
Shower time, kiddo.

866
00:49:40,517 --> 00:49:43,296
I'm gonna see if I can scare
us up something to eat.

867
00:49:43,296 --> 00:49:46,213
(smooching loudly)

868
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:52,497
- [Man] What do you think,
they high tail into Mexico?

869
00:49:52,497 --> 00:49:53,659
- My people tell me there's no way

870
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,940
they made it out of the country.

871
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,949
I've done my part, now you do yours.

872
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:59,782
Don't call here again.

873
00:50:00,837 --> 00:50:01,670
- Any word?

874
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,498
- Nope, seems Jayne Ferre's
pulled a vanishing act.

875
00:50:04,498 --> 00:50:05,998
- The FBI says no.

876
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:09,371
I tried to keep this thing quiet

877
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:11,871
but they got their own source.

878
00:50:13,141 --> 00:50:15,199
She's on the 10 Most Wanted List, man,

879
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,412
and the interstate
kidnapping brings the feds,

880
00:50:17,412 --> 00:50:18,495
sure as shit.

881
00:50:20,593 --> 00:50:23,093
Damn, I hate to lose a collar.

882
00:50:25,436 --> 00:50:28,436
A lot of people want this woman bad.

883
00:50:30,577 --> 00:50:32,420
- That schmucky cop
claims he would have heard

884
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,086
if they left the state.

885
00:50:35,086 --> 00:50:37,627
So that means they're behind us.

886
00:50:37,627 --> 00:50:41,794
We are gonna look under every
rock around every cactus.

887
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,770
(light sultry music)

888
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,337
(water running)

889
00:51:29,717 --> 00:51:33,884
- Well you know what, your
Mom's not here, come on.

890
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,858
This is gonna be between you and me.

891
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:46,755
Did you ever feel a woman's breast?

892
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:58,891
- I knew you were there, young man.

893
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:01,058
Do you wanna wash my back?

894
00:52:28,927 --> 00:52:30,682
Hey!
(pounding on wall)

895
00:52:30,682 --> 00:52:31,515
What's up?

896
00:52:33,422 --> 00:52:34,255
Shit!

897
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:39,985
(dramatic music)

898
00:52:39,985 --> 00:52:40,985
- Oh my God.

899
00:52:50,672 --> 00:52:53,449
(knocking on door)

900
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:56,418
- Hey honey, can you take
some of this stuff, please?

901
00:52:56,418 --> 00:52:57,251
Thank you.

902
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,667
Why aren't you dressed yet?

903
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:02,114
- Um, I fell asleep for
a couple of minutes.

904
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:03,458
- Oh okay, here.

905
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:07,125
- Jayne, there's food
here if you're hungry.

906
00:53:11,216 --> 00:53:13,218
Here, I think you'll be more comfortable

907
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:15,591
in your own room with the door closed.

908
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:16,622
- What's the matter, Emily?

909
00:53:16,622 --> 00:53:19,766
You afraid I'll corrupt
your boy's virgin eyes?

910
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:20,978
'Cause you're a virgin, aren't you?

911
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:23,145
- Oh, get out of here, go.

912
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,094
God.

913
00:53:27,094 --> 00:53:28,713
- Mom, I have to tell you
about something I saw.

914
00:53:28,713 --> 00:53:30,026
- Oh believe me, we all saw it.

915
00:53:30,026 --> 00:53:31,807
That's how she gets her kicks.

916
00:53:31,807 --> 00:53:33,584
Look, new rules, from now on,

917
00:53:33,584 --> 00:53:35,232
I don't give rides to strangers anymore

918
00:53:35,232 --> 00:53:36,338
and you don't go near any girls

919
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,007
that I don't do an FBI
background check on first.

920
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,871
- No Mom, I have to tell you.

921
00:53:40,871 --> 00:53:42,737
- Carey, if I don't wash off this day,

922
00:53:42,737 --> 00:53:44,654
I'm gonna scream, okay?

923
00:53:46,562 --> 00:53:49,812
(light dramatic music)

924
00:54:05,531 --> 00:54:09,698
- You shouldn't have to worry
about this money stuff, Mom.

925
00:55:52,128 --> 00:55:56,128
(speaking in foreign language)

926
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:06,288
- I don't believe this.

927
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,233
I do not believe this.

928
00:56:10,598 --> 00:56:11,681
Hey, wake up!

929
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:17,625
(tires screeching)

930
00:56:19,235 --> 00:56:21,916
I don't fucking believe this.

931
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:23,999
This is too fucking easy.

932
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:32,045
- [Jayne] Wake up!

933
00:56:32,045 --> 00:56:33,175
- Jayne, what are you doing?

934
00:56:33,175 --> 00:56:34,390
- Where is he?
- Who?

935
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,471
- Your fucking son.

936
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:36,736
- I don't, I don't know.
- Where is he?

937
00:56:36,736 --> 00:56:38,117
Don't bullshit me.

938
00:56:38,117 --> 00:56:40,178
- What's wrong, what did he do?

939
00:56:40,178 --> 00:56:41,739
- He stole something from me.

940
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:42,824
- What did he steal?

941
00:56:42,824 --> 00:56:44,606
- My fucking suitcase full of money.

942
00:56:44,606 --> 00:56:46,856
- Can you put the gun away?

943
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,234
- Ohh, he's gonna take
care of Mommy's bills.

944
00:57:02,234 --> 00:57:04,055
How sweet, where is he?

945
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:07,331
- I don't know, Jayne,
I honestly don't know.

946
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:08,960
- Miss Perfect wouldn't
lie to me, would she?

947
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,543
- No.
- Get dressed.

948
00:57:12,998 --> 00:57:15,176
- Whoa, whoa, boy, did you guys pick

949
00:57:15,176 --> 00:57:17,206
the wrong place to hold up.

950
00:57:17,206 --> 00:57:20,069
- Hey listen, uh, the owners of that car,

951
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,558
what room are they in?

952
00:57:21,558 --> 00:57:22,891
- They're in 4D.

953
00:57:25,832 --> 00:57:28,760
(hitting loudly)

954
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,679
(shotgun clicking)

955
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:33,429
(dramatic music)

956
00:57:35,045 --> 00:57:38,024
- Let me tell you, bitch, if
you wanna see your kid again

957
00:57:38,024 --> 00:57:40,107
move the fuck over there.

958
00:57:41,857 --> 00:57:44,357
(guns firing)

959
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,471
(guns firing)

960
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:00,912
- Who are they?
- Get the fuck in the corner

961
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:01,912
and shut up!

962
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:04,059
- Go!

963
00:58:10,893 --> 00:58:13,810
(shotgun clicking)

964
00:58:17,068 --> 00:58:21,722
(grunting)
(gun banging)

965
00:58:21,722 --> 00:58:24,062
- [Jayne] Let's go!

966
00:58:24,062 --> 00:58:26,993
(gun banging)

967
00:58:26,993 --> 00:58:27,826
- Shit.

968
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,395
Ah, you stupid bitch, you
see what you did to me?

969
00:58:36,395 --> 00:58:38,041
- You want some more, Arty?

970
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:41,208
- Jayne, sweetheart, call an ambulance

971
00:58:42,859 --> 00:58:45,480
and we'll call it even, okay?

972
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,313
You know me, I'm a man of my word.

973
00:58:57,976 --> 00:59:00,020
(shrieking)

974
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:02,187
(yelling)

975
00:59:03,246 --> 00:59:05,996
Can't believe you shot me, Jayne.

976
00:59:08,469 --> 00:59:10,802
(gun bangs)

977
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:13,939
- Stop or I'll kill you.

978
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,477
He said he was going
home, where do you live?

979
00:59:43,477 --> 00:59:45,039
I'm not playing cutesy games here.

980
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,663
- Screw you, Jayne, and
all the trouble you're in.

981
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:48,659
This has nothing to do with me and Carey.

982
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:50,030
- It had nothing to do with you

983
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:53,193
until Carey stole my God damned money.

984
00:59:53,193 --> 00:59:55,361
Do you know how many lives that's worth?

985
00:59:55,361 --> 00:59:58,006
- Yeah, I got a pretty good
idea back at the motel.

986
00:59:58,006 --> 01:00:01,434
- So now we can do this the
easy way or the hard way.

987
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:03,865
The easy way is that
you give me your address

988
01:00:03,865 --> 01:00:05,927
and I have my money back

989
01:00:05,927 --> 01:00:09,223
and I won't see you and Carey ever again.

990
01:00:09,223 --> 01:00:12,586
The hard way is that I'm gonna pull over

991
01:00:12,586 --> 01:00:14,902
and cut you apart piece by piece

992
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,485
and believe me, I know how to do this

993
01:00:16,485 --> 01:00:19,636
so you're gonna stay conscious for hours

994
01:00:19,636 --> 01:00:22,842
and you'll tell me what I wanna know.

995
01:00:22,842 --> 01:00:24,425
Your choice, Momma.

996
01:00:26,141 --> 01:00:28,243
- What are you gonna do to
Carey when you find him?

997
01:00:28,243 --> 01:00:29,806
- Get back what he stole from me.

998
01:00:29,806 --> 01:00:30,846
- And then what are you gonna do?

999
01:00:30,846 --> 01:00:32,033
- Nothing I don't have to.

1000
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:33,184
- I don't believe you.

1001
01:00:33,184 --> 01:00:34,185
(laughing)

1002
01:00:34,185 --> 01:00:38,218
- Well, you better because
I'm all you've got.

1003
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,702
I always like to wound first.

1004
01:00:40,702 --> 01:00:44,119
One more time, where do you fucking live?

1005
01:00:45,397 --> 01:00:46,567
- Long Beach.

1006
01:00:46,567 --> 01:00:49,475
- There ya go, thank you, baby.

1007
01:00:49,475 --> 01:00:51,863
- So, how much money did Carey steal?

1008
01:00:51,863 --> 01:00:56,673
- Oh, much more than you'll
ever see in your lifetime.

1009
01:00:56,673 --> 01:00:59,302
(giggling)

1010
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:01,271
Oh, you think that's funny?

1011
01:01:01,271 --> 01:01:03,073
- No, it's not that,
I'm just thinking about

1012
01:01:03,073 --> 01:01:04,701
what you said earlier when I asked you

1013
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:06,870
who you really were.

1014
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:07,823
You said you were a hit woman

1015
01:01:07,823 --> 01:01:09,188
who stole a million dollars.

1016
01:01:09,188 --> 01:01:10,772
That was the truth, wasn't it?

1017
01:01:10,772 --> 01:01:13,945
- I told you, I'm not a liar.

1018
01:01:13,945 --> 01:01:16,409
- You're gonna kill us both, aren't you?

1019
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:18,632
- Well, it's up to you.

1020
01:01:18,632 --> 01:01:22,549
- We know who you are,
so we have to go, right?

1021
01:01:26,052 --> 01:01:28,052
Isn't that right, Jayne?

1022
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,979
(screaming)
(tires screeching)

1023
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:39,276
(hitting and grunting)

1024
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:47,814
(hitting and horn honking)

1025
01:02:00,065 --> 01:02:03,315
- Emily!
(horn honking)

1026
01:02:06,904 --> 01:02:07,737
Shit.

1027
01:02:22,121 --> 01:02:22,954
Emily?

1028
01:02:25,915 --> 01:02:28,998
You left something in the car, Emily.

1029
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:39,297
Looks like you don't live in Long Beach

1030
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:42,297
but in Studio City, you little liar.

1031
01:02:43,589 --> 01:02:45,453
You know you're not gonna see that little

1032
01:02:45,453 --> 01:02:47,870
beautiful son of yours again.

1033
01:02:48,794 --> 01:02:52,377
It's too bad, he was
sure a sexy hot thing.

1034
01:02:54,218 --> 01:02:57,301
Well, maybe I can fuck his brains out

1035
01:02:58,272 --> 01:03:00,689
before I blow his brains out.

1036
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:05,734
Hey, Mommy, listen to that, would you?

1037
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,464
Would you see us screwing?

1038
01:03:09,464 --> 01:03:13,631
Couldd you see me doing
that to your own little boy?

1039
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:20,437
Okay, seems like you wanna rot
here, so that's fine with me.

1040
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:25,125
Anyway, I don't need you anymore.

1041
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:26,875
I've got what I want.

1042
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,592
(dramatic music)

1043
01:03:56,031 --> 01:03:58,459
Well, this is what I'm
saying, is this fucking kid

1044
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:01,173
just ripped me off and
headed for Los Angeles.

1045
01:04:01,173 --> 01:04:02,341
So, as soon as she reaches a phone,

1046
01:04:02,341 --> 01:04:04,773
she's gonna call him and
warn him not to stay home

1047
01:04:04,773 --> 01:04:06,932
and we're never gonna get the money back.

1048
01:04:06,932 --> 01:04:08,841
- You want me to clean this up for you?

1049
01:04:08,841 --> 01:04:10,704
- Would you do that, babe?

1050
01:04:10,704 --> 01:04:11,599
Oh, I'm sure you'll find her.

1051
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,728
She's probably still on the highway.

1052
01:04:13,728 --> 01:04:14,561
- You know, you ought to be careful

1053
01:04:14,561 --> 01:04:17,261
'cause this could get way out of control.

1054
01:04:17,261 --> 01:04:19,968
- Hey listen, if you take care of that,

1055
01:04:19,968 --> 01:04:23,174
I'm gonna take care of you bigtime, okay?

1056
01:04:23,174 --> 01:04:25,135
Just look for the bitch on the highway.

1057
01:04:25,135 --> 01:04:27,468
See you soon, babe, bye-bye.

1058
01:04:28,924 --> 01:04:31,674
(dramatic music)

1059
01:04:33,963 --> 01:04:36,963
Oh, Jesus, look at that, poor thing.

1060
01:04:38,493 --> 01:04:40,410
- Mark Winston, please.

1061
01:04:42,653 --> 01:04:45,342
- I haven't heard from
my guys in over two hours

1062
01:04:45,342 --> 01:04:47,382
so we're gonna need to be
a little more hands-on.

1063
01:04:47,382 --> 01:04:49,165
- I don't blame you a bit, Frank.

1064
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:51,653
Soon as I get a lead,
I'm gonna let you know.

1065
01:04:51,653 --> 01:04:53,218
- That's very good 'cause
you're on my short list,

1066
01:04:53,218 --> 01:04:55,968
so this problem better be solved.

1067
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:02,063
- (mumbling) Motherfucker.

1068
01:05:02,063 --> 01:05:04,813
(dramatic music)

1069
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:16,253
- Hey!

1070
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:17,586
Stop, hey, stop!

1071
01:05:32,602 --> 01:05:35,435
Hey, please stop, help me, please!

1072
01:05:38,483 --> 01:05:39,483
Please stop!

1073
01:05:40,779 --> 01:05:42,029
Please help me.

1074
01:05:48,368 --> 01:05:49,201
- Are you okay?

1075
01:05:49,201 --> 01:05:50,196
I almost ran you over.

1076
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,068
- I need a ride.

1077
01:05:51,068 --> 01:05:53,480
- Of course, come on in.

1078
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,167
- Thank you so much.

1079
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:58,417
(light dramatic music)

1080
01:06:04,147 --> 01:06:05,559
- My name's Alex Tyler.

1081
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:07,053
- I'm Emily Shaw.

1082
01:06:07,053 --> 01:06:08,573
Look, Emily Shaw, I know
it's none of my business

1083
01:06:08,573 --> 01:06:09,939
but how'd you end up out here?

1084
01:06:09,939 --> 01:06:11,772
- Uh, I was carjacked.

1085
01:06:13,324 --> 01:06:14,319
- And they stranded you?

1086
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,254
- Yeah, I really need to get to a phone

1087
01:06:16,254 --> 01:06:17,504
to call my son.

1088
01:06:18,397 --> 01:06:19,700
- You can use mine.

1089
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,033
- Ah, thank you.

1090
01:06:25,297 --> 01:06:27,630
- Come on, come on, come on.

1091
01:06:28,983 --> 01:06:31,065
Come on, Carey, pick up the phone.

1092
01:06:31,065 --> 01:06:32,565
Pick up the phone.

1093
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:34,891
Pick up!

1094
01:06:36,597 --> 01:06:38,014
Come on, come on.

1095
01:06:39,044 --> 01:06:41,711
(phone ringing)

1096
01:06:44,294 --> 01:06:45,640
Can you please, please, please

1097
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,065
get me back to Los Angeles?

1098
01:06:47,065 --> 01:06:49,344
My son is in trouble, I have to get home.

1099
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:51,662
- Oh, miss, if your kid
is in some kind of danger,

1100
01:06:51,662 --> 01:06:53,312
you should call the
local police department

1101
01:06:53,312 --> 01:06:54,496
and send them to your house.

1102
01:06:54,496 --> 01:06:55,913
- I can't call the cops, trust me.

1103
01:06:55,913 --> 01:06:58,562
Please, I'm begging you, please.

1104
01:06:58,562 --> 01:07:01,312
- Okay but there's one condition.

1105
01:07:02,465 --> 01:07:03,918
- Anything.

1106
01:07:03,918 --> 01:07:06,042
- You're gonna have to trust me.

1107
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:06,875
- What?

1108
01:07:08,865 --> 01:07:10,304
- I'm an agent with the FBI.

1109
01:07:10,304 --> 01:07:11,852
- Oh God, you're a cop.

1110
01:07:11,852 --> 01:07:12,893
Christ.

1111
01:07:12,893 --> 01:07:14,292
- If you want my help,
you're gonna have to tell me

1112
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:15,639
just exactly what happened

1113
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:18,388
because I don't believe
this carjacking story.

1114
01:07:18,388 --> 01:07:19,952
So what are you, a dealer?

1115
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:21,068
You screw over your
connection or something?

1116
01:07:21,068 --> 01:07:21,901
- No.

1117
01:07:21,901 --> 01:07:22,734
- Then what about your boy?

1118
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:25,274
- It's nothing like that.

1119
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,792
- Then why is someone after him?

1120
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,748
And why are you so afraid
to call the local police?

1121
01:07:28,748 --> 01:07:29,581
- Because if I call the cops,

1122
01:07:29,581 --> 01:07:30,868
I'll never see him again.

1123
01:07:30,868 --> 01:07:31,786
- Sounds like you've got yourself mixed up

1124
01:07:31,786 --> 01:07:33,290
with some very bad people.

1125
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:35,382
- No, one very bad woman
and if she finds him,

1126
01:07:35,382 --> 01:07:37,311
she's gonna kill him.

1127
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:39,336
- Alright look, Emily, if what
you're telling me is true,

1128
01:07:39,336 --> 01:07:43,086
then we don't have a
choice, call the police.

1129
01:07:46,315 --> 01:07:47,815
- Hey hello, LAPD?

1130
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:51,441
My name's Alex Tyler, I'm
an agent with the FBI,

1131
01:07:51,441 --> 01:07:52,941
badge number 6871.

1132
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:56,190
Yeah look, we have a hostage situation

1133
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:59,958
potentially developing at
the home of a Ms. Emily Shaw.

1134
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:04,077
Yeah, it involves a minor,
we're heading over there.

1135
01:08:04,077 --> 01:08:07,596
- (giggling) And the best is yet to come.

1136
01:08:07,596 --> 01:08:09,786
Thank you, thank you, thank you, darling.

1137
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:11,263
And you can shoot her if you want.

1138
01:08:11,263 --> 01:08:12,263
- Thank you.

1139
01:08:15,031 --> 01:08:19,198
Don't worry, Emily,
everything's gonna be alright.

1140
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:36,261
- Thanks, man.
- No worries.

1141
01:08:55,304 --> 01:08:58,554
(light dramatic music)

1142
01:09:01,784 --> 01:09:05,534
- Better not leave this
lying around, genius.

1143
01:09:21,715 --> 01:09:24,465
(dramatic music)

1144
01:09:32,591 --> 01:09:35,841
(light dramatic music)

1145
01:09:46,277 --> 01:09:48,386
- [TV Reporter] The woman,
whose name is Jayne Ferre,

1146
01:09:48,386 --> 01:09:51,403
is a suspect in the
slaying of Director Quinn

1147
01:09:51,403 --> 01:09:52,798
in Los Angeles.

1148
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:56,031
Ferre was seen traveling with
a woman, Mrs. Emily Shaw,

1149
01:09:56,031 --> 01:09:58,051
whose car was found at a motel.

1150
01:09:58,051 --> 01:10:01,309
Reserve caution in public,
as Ferre is considered armed

1151
01:10:01,309 --> 01:10:03,039
and extremely dangerous.

1152
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:05,382
Anyone with any information
is urged to contact

1153
01:10:05,382 --> 01:10:06,772
the Los Angeles Police Department.

1154
01:10:06,772 --> 01:10:09,966
(phone ringing)

1155
01:10:09,966 --> 01:10:10,799
- Winston.

1156
01:10:13,424 --> 01:10:15,074
Uh-huh, put him through.

1157
01:10:15,074 --> 01:10:16,192
- My name is Carey Shaw.

1158
01:10:16,192 --> 01:10:18,219
I think I know where Jayne Ferre is.

1159
01:10:18,219 --> 01:10:19,052
- Where are you?

1160
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:20,425
- I'm at home, I'm in LA.

1161
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:22,034
What about my Mom, is she alive?

1162
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:23,119
- Hold on, hold on.

1163
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:24,812
Where do you think you saw Jayne Ferre?

1164
01:10:24,812 --> 01:10:26,783
- I was with her all day.

1165
01:10:26,783 --> 01:10:29,339
What about my Mom, is she gonna be killed?

1166
01:10:29,339 --> 01:10:31,314
- Hey calm down, we have
no evidence of that.

1167
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:33,471
Now, why would you think that Jayne Ferre

1168
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,156
would wanna kill you and your Mom?

1169
01:10:36,156 --> 01:10:37,508
- 'Cause I stole her money.

1170
01:10:37,508 --> 01:10:39,959
The million dollars they
said on TV that she robbed.

1171
01:10:39,959 --> 01:10:42,185
I made a big mistake, I
didn't know who she was

1172
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:43,621
and I stole it.

1173
01:10:43,621 --> 01:10:45,920
- You're saying you have
one million dollars in cash

1174
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,308
with you right now?

1175
01:10:47,308 --> 01:10:48,349
- I have it here.
- And nobody else

1176
01:10:48,349 --> 01:10:49,561
knows you have it?

1177
01:10:49,561 --> 01:10:50,472
- Only Jayne and my Mom.

1178
01:10:50,472 --> 01:10:51,925
I just got home a few minutes ago.

1179
01:10:51,925 --> 01:10:53,463
- Okay Carey, listen up.

1180
01:10:53,463 --> 01:10:55,371
I want you to stay right where you are.

1181
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:56,934
I'm gonna send some detectives over

1182
01:10:56,934 --> 01:10:58,612
and I want you to tell
them everything, okay?

1183
01:10:58,612 --> 01:11:01,313
You stay in the house and
you stay off the phone.

1184
01:11:01,313 --> 01:11:03,399
I don't care if it rings,
you don't pick it up.

1185
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:05,743
If Jayne Ferre calls and
it gets a buys signal,

1186
01:11:05,743 --> 01:11:07,435
she'll know you're
home, you understand me?

1187
01:11:07,435 --> 01:11:08,500
- Okay.

1188
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,670
- We'll be there in 10 minutes, alright?

1189
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:12,181
- Yes, sir.

1190
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:13,514
- You sit tight.

1191
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:29,052
Mr. Bianci, Detective Winston.

1192
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:30,525
I got some great news for ya.

1193
01:11:30,525 --> 01:11:32,374
Seems that kid who was
riding around with Jayne

1194
01:11:32,374 --> 01:11:34,321
and his mother is back in town.

1195
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:36,539
He says he's got the
million dollars with him.

1196
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:37,733
Can you believe that?

1197
01:11:37,733 --> 01:11:38,876
He says he stole it from her.

1198
01:11:38,876 --> 01:11:39,709
- What?

1199
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:41,437
- He called me at the
station not two minutes ago.

1200
01:11:41,437 --> 01:11:43,371
I'm on my way to him as we speak.

1201
01:11:43,371 --> 01:11:45,210
My bet is that Jayne's
coming back after his ass

1202
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,620
to collect that money.

1203
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:47,453
- Okay, listen to me.

1204
01:11:47,453 --> 01:11:49,007
I wanna talk to him, okay?

1205
01:11:49,007 --> 01:11:51,327
I want to talk to him myself.

1206
01:11:51,327 --> 01:11:53,800
I'm coming over to take care
of the situation personally.

1207
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,717
Pick me up.

1208
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:01,064
(phone ringing)

1209
01:12:11,384 --> 01:12:12,995
- Come on, Carey, pick up the phone.

1210
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,495
Pick up the phone.

1211
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:18,032
(phone ringing)

1212
01:12:19,387 --> 01:12:21,830
Come on, Carey, pick up the phone.

1213
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:23,330
Pick up the phone.

1214
01:12:24,478 --> 01:12:26,996
(phone ringing)

1215
01:12:26,996 --> 01:12:28,163
Where are you?

1216
01:12:29,573 --> 01:12:32,406
She's probably already killed him.

1217
01:12:35,723 --> 01:12:37,443
- No, she hasn't.

1218
01:12:37,443 --> 01:12:39,360
- How do you know that.

1219
01:12:40,463 --> 01:12:42,213
- I can guarantee it.

1220
01:12:43,712 --> 01:12:45,556
Listen to me, Emily, I'm
gonna tell you something

1221
01:12:45,556 --> 01:12:47,441
that's gonna take a real
leap of faith on your part

1222
01:12:47,441 --> 01:12:50,441
but I really want you to believe me.

1223
01:12:51,346 --> 01:12:55,686
I've been working for a long
time to get Jayne Ferre.

1224
01:12:55,686 --> 01:12:58,632
I've been working undercover.

1225
01:12:58,632 --> 01:13:01,364
She killed my partner in Chicago

1226
01:13:01,364 --> 01:13:05,531
and not only was he my
partner, he was my best friend.

1227
01:13:06,707 --> 01:13:08,197
We also believe that she's connected

1228
01:13:08,197 --> 01:13:10,274
to over 20 gangland
slayings, we just never had

1229
01:13:10,274 --> 01:13:12,946
the hard evidence to pin them on her.

1230
01:13:12,946 --> 01:13:15,730
And I've been working
slowly, getting close to her,

1231
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:17,370
trying to gain her confidence

1232
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:20,345
so when she did this mob
guy and ripped him off,

1233
01:13:20,345 --> 01:13:22,245
that was my opportunity.

1234
01:13:22,245 --> 01:13:24,832
I told her I could double her money

1235
01:13:24,832 --> 01:13:28,368
so I was on my way to Texas to meet her

1236
01:13:28,368 --> 01:13:31,392
and when I met her up there with the cash,

1237
01:13:31,392 --> 01:13:33,223
I was gonna put the cuffs on her.

1238
01:13:33,223 --> 01:13:35,231
- You expect me to believe that crock?

1239
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,029
- Oh trust me, I am
sticking my neck out a mile

1240
01:13:37,029 --> 01:13:38,446
telling you this.

1241
01:14:21,937 --> 01:14:24,854
(knocking on door)

1242
01:14:28,294 --> 01:14:31,158
- Carey, Detective Winston,
we talked on the phone.

1243
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:34,825
This is Detective Jones,
mind if we come in?

1244
01:14:36,929 --> 01:14:41,525
So, the detective here says
you've seen that bitch, yeah?

1245
01:14:41,525 --> 01:14:43,275
You seen her tonight?

1246
01:14:46,321 --> 01:14:47,879
- You can answer that, Carey.

1247
01:14:47,879 --> 01:14:49,991
- We were stuck in a small
town just this side of Arizona

1248
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:52,637
but look, I need you guys' help.

1249
01:14:52,637 --> 01:14:53,980
Jayne's gonna be pissed when she finds out

1250
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:56,123
I stole her money, I
don't know what she'll do.

1251
01:14:56,123 --> 01:14:58,183
- Oh, I know what she'll do.

1252
01:14:58,183 --> 01:15:01,016
- Uh, detective, I'll handle this.

1253
01:15:02,258 --> 01:15:03,688
Maybe it'd be a good idea if you showed us

1254
01:15:03,688 --> 01:15:05,145
the money you took from her now.

1255
01:15:05,145 --> 01:15:06,279
- Oh, my Mom--
- Let us worry

1256
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:07,581
about your Mom, kid.

1257
01:15:07,581 --> 01:15:08,714
We're gonna take good care of her.

1258
01:15:08,714 --> 01:15:11,051
She'll be just fine, okay?

1259
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:14,282
Now, what we wanna know
from you is, first,

1260
01:15:14,282 --> 01:15:16,563
where that bitch is, then
we wanna see that money

1261
01:15:16,563 --> 01:15:17,980
you say you have.

1262
01:15:23,066 --> 01:15:24,841
- Can I see you guys' badges?

1263
01:15:24,841 --> 01:15:27,674
Just so I know you're really cops.

1264
01:15:29,114 --> 01:15:30,281
- Sure, Carey.

1265
01:15:34,844 --> 01:15:37,739
- I didn't see his badge.

1266
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:38,656
- Oh, this.

1267
01:15:42,313 --> 01:15:44,107
Look at that, you know
what that is, right?

1268
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:45,092
You know what that is.

1269
01:15:45,092 --> 01:15:46,950
Now you listen to me you
wise ass little punk.

1270
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:48,466
Before I blow your brains out,

1271
01:15:48,466 --> 01:15:50,430
you're gonna tell me where that bitch is,

1272
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:52,717
then you're gonna tell
me where my money is.

1273
01:15:52,717 --> 01:15:56,123
I swear to God, I'm gonna give
you to the count of three.

1274
01:15:56,123 --> 01:15:57,695
One, two--

1275
01:15:57,695 --> 01:15:59,420
- Jesus, wait!

1276
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,655
I'll tell you.

1277
01:16:00,655 --> 01:16:03,572
(glass shattering)

1278
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,686
- What the hell was that?

1279
01:16:10,651 --> 01:16:12,217
Jayne likes to mess with people first.

1280
01:16:12,217 --> 01:16:13,715
It's definitely her style.

1281
01:16:13,715 --> 01:16:16,798
- Oh, I'll put her hair on the walls.

1282
01:16:26,595 --> 01:16:28,928
(gun fires)

1283
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,943
- Winston, where are you?

1284
01:16:45,246 --> 01:16:47,496
Come with me, kid, come on.

1285
01:16:55,767 --> 01:16:58,100
(gun fires)

1286
01:16:59,757 --> 01:17:00,907
Oh, God.

1287
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,609
- It's funny, you all sound
the same when you are dying.

1288
01:17:03,609 --> 01:17:05,504
No more macho bullshit.

1289
01:17:05,504 --> 01:17:06,718
- You don't have to do this.

1290
01:17:06,718 --> 01:17:10,297
- Just a whimp, begging
for me to end the pain.

1291
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:14,464
(gun fires)
(groaning)

1292
01:17:17,245 --> 01:17:19,231
Carey, where's the money?

1293
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,124
I want it back.

1294
01:17:21,124 --> 01:17:23,375
(siren wailing)

1295
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:27,542
(tires screeching)
(suspenseful music)

1296
01:17:32,518 --> 01:17:33,935
Come on, move it.

1297
01:17:57,851 --> 01:17:59,351
- Christ, damn it.

1298
01:18:03,464 --> 01:18:05,797
See if you can find the kid!

1299
01:18:14,895 --> 01:18:18,228
- It's a couple blocks down, keep going.

1300
01:18:19,229 --> 01:18:20,479
- Move, I said.

1301
01:18:28,736 --> 01:18:29,865
- There it is, there it is.

1302
01:18:29,865 --> 01:18:30,698
Oh my God.

1303
01:18:31,762 --> 01:18:34,679
(tires screeching)

1304
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,203
Carey, Carey?

1305
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,387
Carey?
- Emily, wait!

1306
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,011
- Carey?

1307
01:18:46,136 --> 01:18:48,628
Oh my God, where is my son?

1308
01:18:48,628 --> 01:18:50,664
- We're not exactly sure
where he is right now.

1309
01:18:50,664 --> 01:18:52,339
- Who is that?

1310
01:18:52,339 --> 01:18:54,579
- Frank Bianci, the other
guy is a police officer.

1311
01:18:54,579 --> 01:18:55,933
(phone ringing)
Bianci was after the money

1312
01:18:55,933 --> 01:18:57,709
that Jayne Ferre stole.

1313
01:18:57,709 --> 01:18:59,308
- Yes, hello?

1314
01:18:59,308 --> 01:19:00,844
- I'm afraid we're gonna have
to ask you some questions.

1315
01:19:00,844 --> 01:19:02,791
(crying)
- Hold on.

1316
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:06,458
Detective, I'm Alex
Tyler, I'm with the FBI.

1317
01:19:07,348 --> 01:19:10,322
I believe I can answer your
questions better than she could

1318
01:19:10,322 --> 01:19:11,426
but I was wondering if I
could have a few moments

1319
01:19:11,426 --> 01:19:12,943
with Mrs. Shaw first?

1320
01:19:12,943 --> 01:19:13,808
- Sure.

1321
01:19:13,808 --> 01:19:15,391
- Would you please?

1322
01:19:20,169 --> 01:19:21,669
- What's going on?

1323
01:19:22,614 --> 01:19:25,823
- What's going on is you're
gonna do exactly as you're told.

1324
01:19:25,823 --> 01:19:27,156
This is for you.

1325
01:19:29,815 --> 01:19:31,138
- Hello?

1326
01:19:31,138 --> 01:19:33,050
- [Jayne] Hello, Emily, hold on.

1327
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,035
- Mom?
- Carey?

1328
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:35,256
- Obviously, I've got your son

1329
01:19:35,256 --> 01:19:36,702
so if you wanna see him again,

1330
01:19:36,702 --> 01:19:39,188
you do exactly what I tell you.

1331
01:19:39,188 --> 01:19:40,242
Are you with me so far?

1332
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:43,336
- Yes.
- Good, I like to hear that.

1333
01:19:43,336 --> 01:19:45,450
- So, Carey hid the money in the dryer.

1334
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:47,232
I didn't have time to get
it before the police arrived

1335
01:19:47,232 --> 01:19:49,705
so you're gonna bring it to me now.

1336
01:19:49,705 --> 01:19:51,526
We're gonna make an even exchange

1337
01:19:51,526 --> 01:19:54,454
and if I see any cops,
I'll kill your baby boy.

1338
01:19:54,454 --> 01:19:55,979
(smooches lightly)

1339
01:19:55,979 --> 01:19:57,541
- Where?
- Rocket Tech

1340
01:19:57,541 --> 01:19:59,930
but I know you've met
with my good friend, Alex,

1341
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:02,513
so he'll make sure you find it.

1342
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,896
- So, everything you said
earlier was bullshit.

1343
01:20:11,896 --> 01:20:16,347
You've been working with
her all along, you asshole.

1344
01:20:16,347 --> 01:20:18,122
Well, you're the accomplice so
why don't you get the money.

1345
01:20:18,122 --> 01:20:19,622
It's in the dryer.

1346
01:20:21,473 --> 01:20:22,671
- Cut out the crying and do what she says,

1347
01:20:22,671 --> 01:20:24,754
you'll get your kid back.

1348
01:20:27,809 --> 01:20:31,976
Cheer up, Emily, the sooner
they will have what they want.

1349
01:20:34,215 --> 01:20:36,882
(radio chatter)

1350
01:21:08,383 --> 01:21:09,300
Just relax.

1351
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:13,031
- No, you relax.

1352
01:21:13,031 --> 01:21:16,704
Keep your hands on the wheel
and your eyes on the road.

1353
01:21:16,704 --> 01:21:17,944
- What do you think you're doing, Emily?

1354
01:21:17,944 --> 01:21:22,631
- I'm telling you what to do,
scumbag, where's your gun?

1355
01:21:22,631 --> 01:21:23,631
- Left belt.

1356
01:21:26,979 --> 01:21:29,819
- Big gun, trying to
compensate for something?

1357
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:30,652
- Ha ha.

1358
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:34,251
Look Emily, this isn't what you think.

1359
01:21:34,251 --> 01:21:35,786
- You mean, you two were
gonna kill me and my son

1360
01:21:35,786 --> 01:21:37,505
when you got your money
and then take off together?

1361
01:21:37,505 --> 01:21:38,338
Do you mean that?

1362
01:21:38,338 --> 01:21:39,517
- No, you're reading this wrong.

1363
01:21:39,517 --> 01:21:41,600
- Just shut up and drive.

1364
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:44,152
- Look, I had to play like
I was working with her

1365
01:21:44,152 --> 01:21:47,413
so you didn't do anything
stupid, like now.

1366
01:21:47,413 --> 01:21:49,114
You know how dangerous Ferre is.

1367
01:21:49,114 --> 01:21:52,447
She senses anything
wrong, she'll kill Carey.

1368
01:21:52,447 --> 01:21:54,406
I had to get you to cooperate
until I got close enough

1369
01:21:54,406 --> 01:21:55,574
to her to make my move.

1370
01:21:55,574 --> 01:21:57,127
- I don't wanna hear
any more of your lies.

1371
01:21:57,127 --> 01:21:58,998
- I'm trying not to get
you and your boy killed!

1372
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:02,098
- You have done everything
to get me and my kid killed.

1373
01:22:02,098 --> 01:22:03,712
- [Alex] So what are you gonna
do, shoot it out with her?

1374
01:22:03,712 --> 01:22:04,962
- If I have to.

1375
01:22:06,177 --> 01:22:08,864
- You'd be lucky to get one shot off.

1376
01:22:08,864 --> 01:22:10,037
Who the hell do you think
you're dealing with?

1377
01:22:10,037 --> 01:22:11,346
The woman's a professional.

1378
01:22:11,346 --> 01:22:12,709
- [Emily] I will take my chances.

1379
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:13,703
- You have no chance.

1380
01:22:13,703 --> 01:22:15,059
- Then you have less.

1381
01:22:15,059 --> 01:22:17,071
If my kid dies tonight, I swear to God,

1382
01:22:17,071 --> 01:22:19,654
so will both of you, now drive.

1383
01:22:39,667 --> 01:22:41,233
Alright, keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

1384
01:22:41,233 --> 01:22:43,233
Get out of the car slow.

1385
01:22:48,873 --> 01:22:49,869
Move, come on!

1386
01:22:49,869 --> 01:22:52,869
(suspenseful music)

1387
01:22:59,498 --> 01:23:00,430
Where are they?

1388
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:02,100
You better not be screwing with me.

1389
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,958
- Look, would you just
take it easy, Emily?

1390
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:05,125
- Mom!
- Carey!

1391
01:23:09,256 --> 01:23:13,006
- Put the gun down and
give me the briefcase.

1392
01:23:20,027 --> 01:23:21,860
- I'm so sorry, Carey.

1393
01:23:27,021 --> 01:23:29,854
- Baby, you give me the briefcase.

1394
01:23:43,142 --> 01:23:46,222
- Okay, Jayne, you can let the boy go.

1395
01:23:46,222 --> 01:23:47,561
We've got what we want.

1396
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:48,394
- Open it.

1397
01:23:55,936 --> 01:24:00,103
I said open it, I wanna
see this God-damned money.

1398
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,263
- Say, Jayne, remember Chicago?

1399
01:24:07,094 --> 01:24:09,677
When you killed that FBI agent?

1400
01:24:12,163 --> 01:24:13,580
He was my partner

1401
01:24:16,832 --> 01:24:19,252
and this is the last blood
money you're ever gonna see.

1402
01:24:19,252 --> 01:24:21,785
This is payback, bitch.

1403
01:24:21,785 --> 01:24:23,728
- Hey, my fucking money!

1404
01:24:23,728 --> 01:24:25,062
- Carey, get down!

1405
01:24:25,062 --> 01:24:26,885
(gun fires)

1406
01:24:26,885 --> 01:24:28,823
(yelling)

1407
01:24:28,823 --> 01:24:29,656
- No!

1408
01:24:30,526 --> 01:24:34,068
(grunting and hitting)

1409
01:24:34,068 --> 01:24:35,188
(gasping)

1410
01:24:35,188 --> 01:24:37,938
(hitting loudly)

1411
01:24:49,335 --> 01:24:52,076
(hitting and grunting)

1412
01:24:52,076 --> 01:24:54,437
(guns firing)

1413
01:24:54,437 --> 01:24:56,604
(gasping)

1414
01:25:04,911 --> 01:25:05,744
- Whoa.

1415
01:25:05,744 --> 01:25:08,494
(dramatic music)

1416
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:14,334
- Carey.
- Mom!

1417
01:25:35,761 --> 01:25:39,011
(light peaceful music)

1418
01:25:58,359 --> 01:25:59,359
- Hey.
- Hey.

1419
01:26:01,508 --> 01:26:03,392
So, you're really gonna sell this place?

1420
01:26:03,392 --> 01:26:05,303
- Yeah, the sooner the better.

1421
01:26:05,303 --> 01:26:06,746
I don't care where Carey and I live,

1422
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:08,106
I just, I don't wanna be in a place

1423
01:26:08,106 --> 01:26:11,023
with memories like these, you know?

1424
01:26:14,743 --> 01:26:18,560
- You've got some reward
money coming for Jayne Ferre.

1425
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,060
You'll do alright.

1426
01:26:24,521 --> 01:26:26,237
I still feel lousy about what happened.

1427
01:26:26,237 --> 01:26:27,237
(light piano music)

1428
01:26:27,237 --> 01:26:31,182
- Yeah, but you got her,
that's what counts, isn't it?

1429
01:26:31,182 --> 01:26:33,543
- Well, how you doin' otherwise?

1430
01:26:33,543 --> 01:26:38,141
- I'm healing but it's gonna
take a little time, you know?

1431
01:26:38,141 --> 01:26:39,191
- Well, maybe after a little time,

1432
01:26:39,191 --> 01:26:42,691
you and I could have some dinner together?

1433
01:26:44,623 --> 01:26:45,706
- Hey, kiddo.

1434
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:48,493
- Hey.
- Hey.

1435
01:26:50,864 --> 01:26:51,697
- I really would like the chance

1436
01:26:51,697 --> 01:26:54,030
to show you who I really am.

1437
01:26:55,146 --> 01:26:59,313
- Okay but right now, I am
spending some time with my son.

1438
01:27:10,618 --> 01:27:11,451
Call me.

1439
01:27:42,706 --> 01:27:45,956
(light dramatic music)

1440
01:30:44,264 --> 01:30:47,097
