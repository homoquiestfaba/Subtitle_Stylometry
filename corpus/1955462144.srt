1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:06,031
We have a whole team that helps
with the anti-gravity stuff.

2
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:10,846
It looks amazing,
but actually hanging in the air

3
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:13,935
by your private parts,
on a wire, isn't that fun.

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,798
But you know,
you do it for the end result.

5
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:21,869
Subtitled by sharkykh

6
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,520
<i>Please!</i>

7
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,159
<i>Get me out of here!</i>

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,578
Traditionally in Sci-Fi, you begin
with a shot of space

9
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:35,299
and a spaceship crossing the frame.

10
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:38,700
And there was something very cool
about starting in a little storage locker

11
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:39,900
with somebody who's trapped,

12
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:42,815
and you don't have the full
context of what is happening

13
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,561
and then little-by-little,
as she breaks out of the locker,

14
00:00:46,436 --> 00:00:47,879
you start to get context.

15
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:53,846
The whole floating thing,
that's quite challenging.

16
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:58,343
It's fun, super-fun, but at the same time
you know, you have to be very much aware of

17
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,656
every little movement,

18
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,965
everything you touch
causes a reaction, and...

19
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:07,623
at the same time you're just
reacting to the drama that's going on.

20
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:11,799
I knew that a lot of the technical stuff
was hanging on the slings, and you know,

21
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:14,930
people are going to be pulling me
up and down, and being pushed around,

22
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,110
and shaken up, and just a lot of it was
basically just having to be in the moment.

23
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:20,882
Breathing helps a lot.

24
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,355
<i>Ceres was covered in ice.</i>

25
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:29,993
Ceres, we think of it as sort of New York.

26
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:32,670
Has a large port, a lot of
shipments go through there.

27
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:35,286
it's sort of a way station
between Mars and Earth.

28
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:37,841
They've spun-up the asteroid
to give it gravity,

29
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:41,872
and then they essentially quarred it out,
using giant drilling machines.

30
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:44,706
So you have untold riches that
flow through its port.

31
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,425
Yet the Belters who service the ships,
and who unload and load them,

32
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:52,373
you know, really don't get to much
dissipate in the riches of the system,

33
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,039
and that's part of their big right.

34
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:57,472
<i>Every time we demand to be heard,
they hold back our water.</i>

35
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:58,541
<i>Watch your eyes.</i>

36
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,654
<i>People get killed over a
wrong look around here.</i>

37
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:02,404
<i>Hey, you, Badge.</i>

38
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,571
<i>- Welwala.
- What is welwala?</i>

39
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:09,785
<i>"Traitor to my people."</i>

40
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:13,184
Miller, he is the guy who's
at war with his own identity.

41
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:14,693
He's a Belter born and raised,

42
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:18,789
but he's also identified with the
power structure against Belters,

43
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:21,169
so he victimizes the people
that he's a part of.

44
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:22,602
You know, he's a guy sinking.

45
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,353
And you should feel that he is
the guy who's compromised,

46
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:29,298
and you know, if Julie Mao
didn't come along,

47
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:33,030
Miller would just kind of fade
out like a red sun and disappear.

48
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:34,933
<i>So, what's my contract exactly?</i>

49
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:38,639
<i>Find Julie Mao, if she's still here on
Ceres, detain her, and ship her home.</i>

50
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,434
<i>Kidnap job. My pleasure.</i>

51
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:45,110
<i>It's been a long time comin'.</i>

52
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,472
<i>- Are you kidding?
- No.</i>

53
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:48,140
<i>I thought I was getting
my walking papers.</i>

54
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:48,599
<i>What for?</i>

55
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:50,728
<i>Fraternizing with our
navigator, for starters.</i>

56
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,511
<i>- What?</i>
- <i>When we meet Holden,</i>

57
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:56,400
Holden has spent his whole life
trying to answer to nobody.

58
00:02:56,413 --> 00:03:00,120
He's run, he's run from any major
responsibility for other people.

59
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,581
He wants his life to be
simple, and loves being

60
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:05,229
on the Canterbury with
all these other outcasts.

61
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:07,892
Shooting anti-gravity sucks,

62
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:11,705
'cause it's far more complicated set
of circumstances than one might think.

63
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,101
I mean, we we're on wires that
were being pulled manually by people.

64
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:20,442
It was far less enjoyable then
I kind of was hoping it to be.

65
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:22,819
<i>Warning. Gravity hazard.</i>

66
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:26,321
I think ultimately, you know,
it's real, it's part of human nature.

67
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:28,650
Just because we're out in space
doesn't mean that, you know,

68
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,448
we've changed as a... as a species.

69
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:35,348
<i>Hey, Paj, how's the arm?</i>

70
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:37,874
<i>Looking good. Still got
a few nerves, though.</i>

71
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:42,564
We really bent over backwards to make
that environment feel homey and real,

72
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:44,516
and give the ship a lot
of character and people...

73
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,955
you felt like there's going to be all
sorts of interesting relationships

74
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:49,266
that are gonna happen over
the course of episodes.

75
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,700
<i>A ship just appeared
near your location.</i>

76
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:55,630
<i>How is that possible? You cleared
us out to a million clicks.</i>

77
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:58,974
The only way you feel lost,
like you do at the end of episode one,

78
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:01,509
is if you truly believe
that this is the place

79
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,511
that you gonna be with for a very
long time, that these are the people

80
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:06,818
that you gonna be
spending a series with.

81
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,348
<i>Torpedo launch!</i>

82
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:10,747
<i>We're gonna take 'em for a ride.
Alex, go around the asteroid.</i>

83
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:11,764
<i>Run 'em! Now!</i>

84
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:16,610
So when the Canterbury
gets blown up at the end,

85
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,788
it's really a shock.

86
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,708
<i>Canterbury, burn like hell,
you've got incoming!</i>

87
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:24,335
That whole lead after the end of the
episode, I find this very emotional when,

88
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:27,651
you know, that last moment perhaps,
between Ade and Holden

89
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:30,631
before the ship evaporates,
that still gets me.

90
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,360
<i>There's something you should know...</i>

91
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,407
<i>She's gone.</i>

92
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:57,153
<i>I'm looking for a girl,
her name is Julie.</i>

93
00:04:57,825 --> 00:04:59,025
<i>She discovered something.</i>

94
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:00,663
<i>Something big.</i>

95
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,714
<i>If Mars and Earth get
into a throw down...</i>
