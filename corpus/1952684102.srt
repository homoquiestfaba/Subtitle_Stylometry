What, you think I don't?

166
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:42,589
That's not what I said.
It's a big year for me.

167
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:46,527
A few more in the top three,
I can get a sponsorship.
A real one.

168
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:49,863
Yeah, but what if you
don't make it?

169
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:54,268
I don't know.
Haven't thought about it.

170
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:59,790
It just seems like
you should have
some sort of backup plan.

171
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:06,079
[Engine Starts]
You ever think about getting
a car like a normal guy?

172
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:10,200
[Chuckles]
You wouldn't like me
if I was a normal guy.

173
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:50,074
Cale,

174
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:52,293
Braden always teases me.

175
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:55,513
What, that kid in the class
with the big teeth?
Yeah, that's the one.

176
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,850
Yeah.
He says I look different.

177
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:02,570
Oh. That's just
'cause you're special.

178
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:06,440
He calls me names.
Hey, don't let it
get to you.

179
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:10,044
Cale, are we white or black?

180
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:14,465
We're, uh-- We're "whack."

181
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,906
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Announcer]
Sorry, folks.

182
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:26,477
There will be no racing today.
The track is completely
washed out.

183
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:30,564
But we'll see you here
next week, same time,
same place, weather permitting,

184
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:33,434
at the Riverwood Invitational.

185
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,153
What to do with not
really having the right
travel partners and stuff,

186
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:39,923
but I really want to go
and have, like, a real
Italian experience.

187
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:40,992
Cale.
Cale.

188
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,361
Yes. Ready?
One, two, three, go.

189
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:46,614
Oh!
All right.
Lunch is on me today.

190
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:48,833
It's fine. It's fine.
Rancho Bonita.
[Boy] Mexican.

191
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,917
No.
No? Come on.

192
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:52,186
Go now?
Yeah, let's go.
Let's go.

193
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,905
Come on with us.
I'm good. I'm good. Go.

194
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:58,526
All right. All right.
I'll see you later. Bye.

195
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,533
[Justin] Listen. The top
motocross racers are making
like six figures a year.

196
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:09,202
[Boy]
Wow. That'd be cool.
Not to mention sponsorships.

197
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,740
That could be you.
The fajitas!
Mmm, the fajitas!

198
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:15,142
All right,
look at this guy.
Look at this guy, man.

199
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,228
That's how you do it.
I took air like that
yesterday.

200
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,130
See this bike, man?
You can build that?
You were flat on the ground.

201
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:24,569
My Uncle Bill once--
he ate 29 bean burritos here.
No way.

202
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:27,989
- Yeah.
- Too bad he's not here,
'cause my truck's out of gas.

203
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:29,573
[Laughs]

204
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:33,644
Dudes, I am starving.
What do you eat
in this place?

205
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:37,248
The chimi-- ch-ch--
chimichoongo--

206
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,767
Chimichangas.
Chimichangas, man.

207
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,502
Chimi-wangos.
Hi.

208
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:45,222
What can I get you today?
Uh, uh, yeah.
I'll have the--

209
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,126
[Spanish Accent]
the Macha Burrito Combo
and a large el cola.

210
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:51,595
Would you like a better
accent to go with that?

211
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:54,081
Wow. Okay.
Ooh.

212
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,816
Anything else?

213
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:59,086
Uh, yeah. I'll get
the, uh-- the ch--

214
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:00,687
chimi-- uh--
Chimichangas.

215
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:04,108
Yes. The Cheech-and-Chongos
sound delicious.

216
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:07,294
- [Laughter]
- I'll take two tacos,
37 lottery scratchers,

217
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,980
and a large chocolate milk.

218
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,183
Somebody's feeling lucky today.

219
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,670
- Yeah.
- Hey. Your mom's
birthday, right?

220
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:18,856
Oh, yeah.
Can't fight tradition.

221
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:22,409
Okay, I'll be right back.

222
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:25,313
"Feeling lucky"?
How about getting lucky,

223
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,982
as in me and that senorita?

224
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:30,350
[Laughs]
In your dreams, man.
Damn right.

225
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:33,304
- Dude.
- Bro, one day we are gonna be
all over this magazine.

226
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,473
I mean, look at this.

227
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,143
Thirty-seven
lottery tickets here.
Thank you.

228
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,797
Chips and salsa.
Hey, uh, Ale-jan--

229
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:44,965
- Alej--
- Alejandra.

230
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:48,435
- Alejandra.
- Alejandra, right.

231
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:51,355
Who do you think is
better looking, me or him?

232
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,191
- Hmm.
- Huh?

233
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,329
- I'd rather not say.
- Yeah? Why's that?

234
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:01,332
- Don't wanna blow my tip.
- Ooh!

235
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,734
- [Imitates Explosion]
- [Laughter]

236
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,236
- That's just mean.
- The J-train's derailed.

237
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,238
Yeah, well, at least
I'm trying, boys, okay?

238
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,207
You lost your touch, man.
Come on.

239
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:14,145
We're here at Holeshot
talking with local motocross
champion Derek Black.

240
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:16,297
What's goin' on?

241
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,517
The world's coming
to an end.

242
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:24,121
Derek, Sports Illustrated
recently ranked motocross...

243
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,257
as the most physically
demanding sport in the world.

244
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:29,860
How do you prepare for a race
like this week's qualifier?

245
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:32,596
Well, being in shape matters,
Kelly, but a lot of racing
is mental.

246
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:34,598
Yeah.
You're mental, Black.
[Laughs]

247
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,535
And how do you feel about
the latest announcement
from the pro tour?

248
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:40,604
- Sorry?
- Well, after the crash
last week of Danny Camden,

249
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:43,274
there's one opening
on the U.S. pro tour.

250
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:46,476
Whoever does the best
on the amateur tour this year
will get that spot.

251
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:50,047
Dude, the pros.
Yeah, the pros.

252
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,466
A real shot at the pros
doesn't just happen.
[Chuckles]

253
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,668
Guys, and the regionals
are on our turf this year.

254
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:57,404
We just gotta kill
at the regionals,
and we're on to the nationals.

255
00:15:57,472 --> 00:16:00,608
Yeah, dude, we gotta
beat one guy-- Derek.
Two if you count his dad.

256
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:04,277
Guys, guys.
"We" ain't "we."

257
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:08,282
There's only one spot.
One.

258
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:11,735
- ¶ 'Cause I know there's ¶
- [Laughing]

259
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:14,271
¶ Got to be another level ¶
[Shouting, Indistinct]

00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,109

closer to the other side ¶

261
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:24,414

¶ [Fades]

267
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:47,922
Can you believe this, man?
We got a real shot
at the pros.

268
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,193
I thought your dad
was paying for you
to go to college.

269
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,312
I convinced him
to give me one more shot.

270
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,916
If I don't make it though,
Boston, here I come.

271
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,802
Yeah, well, you should go.

272
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,504
Yeah?
Yeah.

273
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:05,756
Hey, if I could go
to college--
You would, yeah.

274
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:09,142
You're not getting off
that easy, my friend.

275
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,279
No, but I'm serious, man.
I mean, this is--

276
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:15,950
This is the chance
for me here.
You know?

277
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:18,018
It's a real chance.

278
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:22,489
Bro, we've been dreaming
about the pros
since we were little kids.

279
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:25,242
Are you ready for this?
To the flag.

280
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:27,127
To the flag.

281
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:31,565
Hey.

282
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,334
Thanks for coming back
for me last weekend.

283
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:35,736
All right?
I know John was pissed.

284
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:39,740
Just... don't ever
do that again.

285
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:52,369
Happy birthday, Mommy!

286
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:55,138
[Gasps, Laughs]
[Laughs]

287
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:58,074
Make a wish.
Oh, I already have
everything I need.

288
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:00,527
[Patting Back]
All right,
I could use a few things.

289
00:18:00,595 --> 00:18:02,730
Do you want to help me?
Yeah!

290
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:04,097
Do you have your wish?
Yeah.

291
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,999
Okay.
[Inhales]

292
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,718
- [Blowing]
- Yea!

293
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,554
All right. Let's get started.
Quarter for you.

294
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:14,391
And you.
[Coin Scratching]

295
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:17,545
Now don't go praying
over lottery tickets.
That's not right.

296
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:20,531
[Both Laughing]

297
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:24,067
And scratch!
That's a dudder.

298
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,237
So what you gonna buy,
Mommy?

299
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:29,239
Let's see. I would pay off
all my bills...

300
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:32,075
and my student loan.

301
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:35,062
And I would put
the rest in savings.

302
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:37,882
[Scratching]

303
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,752
All right.
I'll take you guys to Tahiti.

304
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,870
We'll buy an island,
and we'll hunt down
George Clooney.

305
00:18:43,938 --> 00:18:47,757
- Cool!
[Laughs]
- All right.

306
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:51,311
- All right, come on!
Let's win! Let's win!
- [Groans]

307
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:57,034
- Crys?
- Hey.

308
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,302
I got a race this weekend.
You wanna come by?

309
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,205
[Sighs]
Cale, I can't.

310
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:03,607
I have to study.

311
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:08,778
You, um-- You can't even
come out for just like
two hours or something?

312
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:13,217
Cale, this exam is
really important to me.
Please.

313
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:16,603
Okay.

314
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:19,239
[Sighs] I'll talk to you
later then, all right?
Okay.

315
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:21,241
Good luck.

316
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,615
- [Announcer] All right,
ladies and gentlemen--
- Come on!

317
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:32,418
You gotta keep your head
in the game. Focus.
Get out there.

318
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:35,972
[Announcer] I have just got
the results in from the Premium
Division race this morning.

319
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,260
Roger "the Rocket" Torres,
number 24, came in first--

[Chattering]

321
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,367
[Indistinct Conversation]

322
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,453
See those ruts?

323
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,972
I saw 'em. Yeah, they're
like the Grand Canyon.

324
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,907
Hit 'em hard, okay?
Don't get stuck in those.

325
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:56,660
You get stuck, you're dead.

00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:43,149
plus a hundred bucks
for the speeding ticket.

488
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:45,518
I couldn't knock it
any lower.
Well, I--

489
00:31:45,586 --> 00:31:47,787
I appreciate you
telling me.

490
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:50,022
Sure.

491
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,360
I'm sorry that I reacted
that way.

492
00:31:53,427 --> 00:31:55,895
I just get a little
protective sometimes.

493
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:58,648
Sometimes?

494
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:01,351
Is there something you're
trying to tell me,
Bud Williams?

495
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,836
No, ma'am.

496
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:07,056
Good night, Jeannette.

497
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:09,292
Good night.

498
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:28,311
What in the world
were you thinking?

499
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,414
Nothing.
I was thinking nothing.

500
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,200
Cale Bryant.
What?

501
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:38,171
What, I'm not allowed
to get angry?

502
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:41,941
Mom, I work two jobs
and I bust my ass
at both of them.

503
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:44,994
And it's still not enough.
It never will be.

504
00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:47,814
What do you mean?
You know how grateful
I am for--

505
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,767
No, Mom. It's not you.

506
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:55,938
It's-- It's everybody else.

507
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:59,626
Derek and Crystal.

508
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:01,894

510
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:12,772
Where did that come from?

511
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,410
I don't know.
I-I don't know anything.

512
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:20,847
I just--
[Sighs]

513
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,816
I think--

514
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:28,254
I think that things
might have been different.

515
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:31,658
That's all.

516
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,649
I met your father...

517
00:33:39,716 --> 00:33:42,452
right when I graduated
from high school.

518
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,421
He was the most beautiful man
I'd ever seen.

519
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:53,613
Your father had dreams
of getting out of here.

520
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:55,949
Big dreams.

521
00:33:56,016 --> 00:34:00,720
Having a wife and a baby
made that hard.

522
00:34:01,605 --> 00:34:05,508
So when we had your sister,
he left us.

523
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,779
Yeah, I know that part.

524
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:17,036
You don't always get to be
what you want to be
when you grow up, Cale.

525
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:19,238
Your father ran away
from who he was.

526
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:21,424
From us.

527
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:27,297
Never heard from him again.

528
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,840
You've been chasing this
motorcycle dream
for a long time.

529
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:39,992
I know-- I know it means
a lot to you, but--

530
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,714
but maybe it's time
that you started getting
serious about your future.

531
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,635
Mom, racing is my future.

532
00:34:49,703 --> 00:34:52,271
Cale, seriously--
What--

533
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:55,507
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know anything else.

534
00:34:58,245 --> 00:35:00,563
You know, I got news
for you.

535
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,665
We're never gonna win
the lottery.

536
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,438

00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:08,565
John.

540
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:10,567
John, what's goin' on?

541
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:14,169
Hey! What are you doin'?
I heard about the stunt
you pulled...

542
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,156
- at the lookout last night.
- That has nothing to do
with racing.

543
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:21,444
- It has to do with
who you are as a person.
- You can't take my bike, John!

544
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,846
Last time I checked,
I own this cycle.

545
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:26,816
I have done everything
you've ever asked me to do.
Don't do this.

546
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:31,954
I wish I felt like
I could count on you, Cale.

547
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:34,273
But I just don't.

548
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:36,793
How am I supposed
to race? Huh?

549
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,463
That's not my problem.
Find yourself another bike.

in a while, man.

658
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:15,584
Yeah, been around.
Busy.
Yeah?

659
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:18,170
Rebuilding a bike.
Yeah, I heard. I heard.

660
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,290
It's too bad my sponsor
couldn't help you out.
It all comes easy for you.

661
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,043
What?
You know, it all
falls in your lap.

662
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:29,581
With college, girls,
sponsors.

663
00:44:29,649 --> 00:44:31,700
You don't have to work
that hard for it, you know?

664
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:34,169
Is that--
That's what you think?
Yeah?

665
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:37,356
Because I bust my ass
every day, Cale.

666
00:44:37,423 --> 00:44:40,559
We bust our asses every day,
and that's why we're sponsored
and you're not. Okay?

667
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:43,261

and you play it safe.

668

going on in your head,
you don't even think.

669

I thought we were
on the same team.

670
00:44:48,234 --> 00:44:50,769
What team, Cale?
When are you gonna get it?

671
00:44:50,837 --> 00:44:52,938
Motocross
is not a team sport.

672

the fall the other day, you
wouldn't have gone back for me?

Wow. Okay.

Take it outside, guys!
Take it outside!

677
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:21,383

Come on! All right, all right!
It's done, it's done!

Out! You too, Trent!

679

You're fired.

683

684
00:45:45,908 --> 00:45:47,909

his bike deal.

685
00:45:47,977 --> 00:45:50,045
He'll get through.
He's a tough kid.

686
00:45:52,748 --> 00:45:54,917
Thanks for asking.

687
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,122

695
00:47:01,617 --> 00:47:04,286
Damn it.
Maybe it needs gas.

696
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:19,485
So if I get enough points,
I can still qualify
for Nationals,

697
00:47:19,552 --> 00:47:22,087
and one of the pros just
dropped out of the pro tour,

698
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:25,690
and whoever wins this year
gets that spot.

699
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:27,926
Wow.

to do is get out of here.

what you're searching for.

- Yeah, it is.

Can't wait to take it
on the track, go freestyle.

711
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:09,301
What does that mean,
"freestyle"?

712
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:12,504
It's when you're riding for fun.
You know, you're not racing.

713
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:18,143
It's-- It's when you're
just hanging in the air,

714
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:21,080
and you're looking
down on the world,
and life is good.

715

It only lasts
for a few seconds,

716

but it's almost
as if time just stops...

717
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:34,493
and no worries, you know,
no one can touch you.

718

Will you show me
motocross?

719
00:48:49,341 --> 00:48:51,226
So this is
the starting gate,

720
00:48:51,293 --> 00:48:56,298
and here you line up with about
10 other maniacs who all try
to just psych each other out.

721
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:59,034
It's pretty crazy.

722
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,069
And then, uh,

723
00:49:01,137 --> 00:49:02,904
the 30-second board
goes up.

724
00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:08,460
Your heart is thumping,

725
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:12,197
and... it feels like
it's going to pump right
out of your chest.

726
00:49:12,264 --> 00:49:16,702
And then you stare
down at the gate.

727
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:20,722
It feels like forever
waiting for it to drop.

728
00:49:22,191 --> 00:49:24,292
But by that point,
I mean, I just--

729
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,229
I just block
everything else out,

730
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,097
just focus on that win.

731
00:49:32,168 --> 00:49:36,054

When that happens,
everybody here,

734
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:43,962
they just explode
out of here,

735
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:48,399
and they all try to be
the very first one to that
first turn right over there.

736
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:51,670
That's called the holeshot.

737
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,957
It looks scary.
[Chuckles]

738
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:57,792
Yeah, well,
it's-- it's probably
the most dangerous part.

739
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,164
I mean, there's dirt and rocks
flying up at you everywhere,

740
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,833
and there's just guys crashing
all over the place.

741
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,702
But if you get the holeshot,
you're in the lead.

742
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,605
You set the pace of the race.

743
00:50:10,673 --> 00:50:13,575
Everybody else
just plays catch-up.

744
00:50:13,642 --> 00:50:16,578
So if you get
the holeshot, you win?

745
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:21,183
Nah, it's just
the beginning.

746
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,569

That deep rut?

747
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:28,540
Oh, you want
to avoid that.

748
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:30,942
Yes and no.

749
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,912
See, it can snap your bike,
or your leg.

750
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,914
Oh!

751
00:50:35,982 --> 00:50:40,652
But you know,
if you can tackle it,
if you can just own it,

752
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,621
then you can fire out of there
like a rocket.

753
00:50:45,124 --> 00:50:47,325
It can make or break a race.

754
00:50:47,393 --> 00:50:50,928
That's sort of where
my problem is.

755
00:50:50,996 --> 00:50:55,933

the rut you get in--
The faster you shoot out.

You said you never
heard from Dad again.

01:10:51,446 --> 01:10:54,681
we can try.

997
01:10:55,817 --> 01:10:57,751
Okay.

998
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,729
[Sighs]

999
01:11:10,064 --> 01:11:12,616
I heard.

1000
01:11:12,684 --> 01:11:14,885
I'm done, bro.

1001
01:11:14,953 --> 01:11:17,021
I lost my sponsorship.

1002
01:11:18,923 --> 01:11:21,908
They dropped me faster
than a pregnant prom queen.

1003
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:25,812
Uh, my dad won, I guess.

1004
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,382
I got Boston coeds
in my future now.

1005
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,200
It's not so bad though,
right?

1006
01:11:30,268 --> 01:11:33,920
I mean, I probably
would have got bored on
the pro tour anyways.

1007
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:37,224
Who said you were
gonna beat me?
[Both Laughing]

1008
01:11:41,296 --> 01:11:43,230
Listen, man.

1009
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,052
I'm sorry about all that stuff
that I said, you know?

1010
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:49,954
Me too, man.
I'm sorry.

1011
01:11:54,892 --> 01:11:59,062
So, it's up to you now, bro.
What are you gonna do?

1012
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:02,967
I'm gonna turn in my application
as assistant manager over
at Electronic Factor.

1013
01:12:03,034 --> 01:12:05,169
What? What are you--
What about the dream?

1014
01:12:05,236 --> 01:12:08,122
I missed the race
the other day, man.
It's over.

1015
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,958
Yeah? Well, you always
got the regionals.

1016
01:12:13,344 --> 01:12:15,612
I obviously can't race
next weekend,

1017
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,466
and since you
tied Derek for second,
you got my spot, bro.

1018
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:21,285
What?

1019
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:25,439
Yeah. You're racing next weekend
in the amateur regionals. Yeah.

1020
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:28,025
Oh, my God!
Oh, hey.

1021
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,677
Easy, okay? Easy.
Okay. Sorry.

1022
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:33,930
Now all you need, man,
is an entrance fee and a bike.

1023
01:12:33,999 --> 01:12:36,049
Well--
Ah, well, don't look
at me, bro.

1024
01:12:36,117 --> 01:12:38,686
You think I look bad,
you should see my bike.

1025
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:42,757
No ride, no bike.
That's how endorsements work.

1026
01:12:42,824 --> 01:12:45,292
Hey, tell me Trent
got his job back
at Holeshot.

1027
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,278
Yeah, he did.
I've never seen a man
beg so much in my life.

1028
01:12:48,346 --> 01:12:53,450
He was on his knees, crying,
snot coming out of his nose.
It was gross.

1029
01:12:53,518 --> 01:12:56,336
Okay, you don't understand.
Wally, Wally, Wally.

1030
01:12:56,404 --> 01:12:58,705
Have we ever let you down?
We're not gonna need it
for that long.

1031
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:01,392
I'll do it on my
own time, I promise.
You don't have to pay me.

1032
01:13:01,459 --> 01:13:04,478
- Once he works on it,
it's gonna be better--
- All right.

1033
01:13:04,545 --> 01:13:06,179
- Wally.
- Absolutely free. Seriously.

1034
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:09,249
- All right. All right!
Now back to work.
- Yeah!

1035
01:13:09,317 --> 01:13:12,620
Dude. Wally.
Yes!

1036
01:13:12,687 --> 01:13:14,789
Thank you.
Thank you.

1037
01:13:14,856 --> 01:13:19,693
[Man]
¶ We don't have time

1059
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:31,331
You want be a champ?
¶ Hold on, hold on ¶

1060
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:32,933
Not bad.

1061
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,903
Yeah. I was wondering
if you wanted to come over...

1062
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:39,240
and watch the race
with me and Bailey.

1063
01:14:39,307 --> 01:14:42,692
¶ Just hold on, hold on ¶
Are you serious?

1064
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,980
¶ Hold on, hold on ¶
Great. Okay.
I'll see you then.

1065
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:47,948
[Beeps]

1066
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:51,618
¶ Hold on ¶

1067
01:14:51,686 --> 01:14:55,422

1069
01:14:58,142 --> 01:15:00,543
¶ So hold on ¶
[Trent]
That about does it.

1070
01:15:00,611 --> 01:15:04,315
I bored and honed the cylinders,
added a set of hot cams,

1071
01:15:04,382 --> 01:15:06,734
recut the valve seats,
and, uh, oh, yeah--

1072
01:15:06,801 --> 01:15:08,819
I modified
the accelerator pump.

1073
01:15:08,886 --> 01:15:12,355
God, you make me hot.
Get your arms off me
before I chew them off.

1074
01:15:12,423 --> 01:15:14,425
¶ Hold on, hold on ¶

1075
01:15:14,492 --> 01:15:16,627
How are we doing
for finances?

1076
01:15:16,694 --> 01:15:21,198
Uh, Secretary
of the Treasury?
We've got $937.

1077
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:25,101
Guys, we need two grand
for entrance fee.

1078
01:15:25,169 --> 01:15:26,937
Yeah.
Damn it.

1079
01:15:27,005 --> 01:15:29,206
I've got an idea.

1080
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:33,260
It'll be on magazines.
It'll be on TV.

1081
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:35,462
There's hundreds
of people there.

1082
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:38,832
It's the regional championships,
and it's-- it's here.

1083
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:42,703
It's never here,
and people will see--

1084
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:46,139
- Yeah, yeah.
It's a sport, a game, uh-huh?
- I don't know about this.

1085
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,158
No, Senor Lopez,
it's not just a game.

1086
01:15:48,226 --> 01:15:52,729
It's-It's my life,
and you can make money at it.
You can make a living.

1087
01:15:54,232 --> 01:15:58,768
Senor Lopez, you came
to this country...

1088
01:15:58,836 --> 01:16:01,088
with a dream,

1089
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:06,660
and you-- you worked hard,
and you sacrificed everything,

1090
01:16:06,727 --> 01:16:08,645
and now look
what you have.

1091
01:16:08,713 --> 01:16:11,164
This is my dream.

1092
01:16:11,232 --> 01:16:13,400
This is what I do well.

1093
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:16,569
If I could have half
of what you have--

1094
01:16:16,637 --> 01:16:21,158
a business, a family--

1095
01:16:21,225 --> 01:16:23,493
Mr. Lopez.

1096
01:16:23,561 --> 01:16:27,013
Your daughter
is, um--

1097
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:29,583
Your daughter's
quite extraordinary,

1098
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:34,988
and I-- I look at you,
and I see why.

1099
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,316
- [Squeals]
- Yeah!

1100
01:16:46,384 --> 01:16:48,869
[Justin]
Yes! Attaboy!

1101
01:16:50,588 --> 01:16:53,023
Right on, man. Great.

1102
01:16:55,493 --> 01:16:58,012
Thank you, Mr. Lopez.

1103
01:17:01,282 --> 01:17:03,500
Thank you.

1104
01:17:03,568 --> 01:17:07,755
Thanks to Rancho Bonita
and myself,

1105
01:17:07,822 --> 01:17:10,624
your ride's
now officially pimped.

1106
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,395
Dude, your bike's
making me hungry.

1107
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:19,399
It's all right.

1108
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:21,318
[Alex]
Yeah, it's good.

1109
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:26,973
[Cale Thinking]
God,

1110
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:30,210
I'm, uh, freaking out
a little bit here.

1111
01:17:30,277 --> 01:17:35,082
Look, I know that sometimes
I question whether you're
even there or not,

1112
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:38,085
but I figure lately...

1113
01:17:38,152 --> 01:17:42,139
that you have to be there
in order for me to be here.

1114
01:17:42,206 --> 01:17:44,892
I just want to ask you
to help me do my best today...

1115
01:17:44,959 --> 01:17:47,961
and, if possible,
could you smooth out
the track?

1116
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:49,963
Amen.

1117
01:17:54,535 --> 01:17:56,670
Hey.

1118
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,705
Yeah, I'm all right.

1119
01:17:58,773 --> 01:18:01,274
I'm just, uh,
mapping out the track.

1120
01:18:05,046 --> 01:18:07,848
You're gonna be amazing.
Thank you.

1121
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,699
I'm a little nervous.

1122
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,870
[Jeannette Laughing]

1123
01:19:03,938 --> 01:19:06,807
Come on, Cale!
Come on. Hurry, hurry!
The final's about to start.

1124
01:19:06,874 --> 01:19:09,826
[Announcer] How do you do,
ladies and gentlemen?
And good afternoon.

1125
01:19:09,893 --> 01:19:13,163
Today is a huge race,
with so much at stake.

1126
01:19:32,383 --> 01:19:35,252
Keep an eye
on the starter, okay?
Watch his body language.

1127
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,654
As soon as he hits the pin,
the holeshot's yours.

1128
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:39,756
Derek looks strong,
Shawn Nash is tearin' it up,

1129
01:19:39,824 --> 01:19:41,958
so you gotta get out front
early this time, okay?

1130
01:19:42,026 --> 01:19:43,994
Now, the track
is totally rutted.
It's treacherous.

1131
01:19:44,061 --> 01:19:46,496
You gotta be strategic.
Keep your low foot
in front of you.

1132
01:19:46,563 --> 01:19:49,232
Sit on it, your high
side'll be fine, okay?
All right, got it.

1133
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,601
Yeah?
What did I just say?
Not a clue.

1134
01:19:51,668 --> 01:19:54,704
Why am I here?
Why--
Uh, free food?

1135
01:19:54,772 --> 01:19:56,640
- Sympathy?
- The chicks.

1136
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:59,693
- The chicks.
- Yeah, the chicks, the chicks.

1137
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,946
Seriously, don't worry.
I just gotta focus on the ruts.
If I get that, I win.

1138
01:20:03,013 --> 01:20:05,899
Yeah, and if you don't--
[Imitates Bomb Falling,
Explosion]

1139
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,768
Yeah.
[Clears Throat]

1140
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:11,905
Come here.
To the flag.

1141
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,774
To the flag.
All right.

1142
01:20:34,545 --> 01:20:37,097
[Announcer]
This track has suffered
a lot of rain this week.

1143
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:40,000
Still very wet,
with a lot of deep ruts the boys
will have to watch out for.

1144
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:42,569
One miscalculation,
and a rider could easily
be thrown from the race.

1145
01:20:42,636 --> 01:20:46,306
Hey, Cale!
No bike today?

1146
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,975
I guess your sponsor
forgot.

1147
01:20:49,043 --> 01:20:52,529
Oh, that's right!
You don't have a sponsor.

1148
01:20:54,582 --> 01:20:56,533
Trent.

1149
01:20:56,834 --> 01:20:58,318
Hey.

1150
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:00,653
[Whooping]

1151
01:21:02,273 --> 01:21:03,473
Ah!

1152
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:07,928
Oh, my God!

1153
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,697
You've got to
be kidding me.
What's next, guys, hot dogs?

1154
01:21:11,765 --> 01:21:13,867
Give 'em hell, Cale, okay?
You've worked hard,
and you deserve this.

1155
01:21:13,934 --> 01:21:16,203
Hey, we all have.

1156
01:21:19,773 --> 01:21:21,824
[Justin]
Come on, Cale!
You can do this, bro!

1157
01:21:21,892 --> 01:21:23,560
[Announcer]
We're almost ready to begin.

1158
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,895
The starter will check
each rider--
It's Cale! It's Cale!

1159
01:21:25,963 --> 01:21:29,682
Right there, Mommy!
That was Cale! Come on, Cale!
You can do it!

1160
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,618
All good?

1161
01:21:31,685 --> 01:21:35,072
Good? Good? Good?

1162
01:21:35,139 --> 01:21:37,324
Ready.

1163
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:40,744
We are seconds away
from the final moto.
Whose day will it be?

1164
01:21:42,246 --> 01:21:44,181
Hey, bro.

1165
01:21:44,248 --> 01:21:47,601
Now, Grant, you've felt
the pressure of this
race-day moment many times.

1166
01:21:47,668 --> 01:21:50,370
What are these young riders
thinking as they prepare
to drop the clutch?

1167
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,055
Is it a matter of--
Now, hold on. Wait.

1168
01:21:52,123 --> 01:21:54,991
One rider seems to
be having a problem.

1169
01:21:55,059 --> 01:21:58,695
Oh, and it appears Cale Bryant
is backing away from
the starting line.

1170
01:21:58,763 --> 01:22:02,432
[Trent]
What's going on?
Cale, what are you doing?

1171
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,335
I'm assuming he must have
some sort of a technical
problem out there.

1172
01:22:05,403 --> 01:22:08,054
- Now he's back
on the bike again.
- What the hell is he doing?

1173
01:22:08,122 --> 01:22:13,727
He's backed up from the gate and
appears to be trying a running
start-- a very bold move.

1174
01:22:21,935 --> 01:22:23,653
There they go!

1175
01:22:23,721 --> 01:22:26,556
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah! Attaboy!

1176
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:28,074
[Alex]
Come on, Cale!

1177
01:22:28,142 --> 01:22:31,444
Cale Bryant risks total disaster
and times the gate perfectly.

1178
01:22:31,512 --> 01:22:36,133
He nails the holeshot,
and, man, Derek Black
is all over him!

1179
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,917
[Grant]
That was one gutsy move.

1180
01:22:40,287 --> 01:22:42,439
[Announcer]
Look at these guys go.

1181
01:22:42,506 --> 01:22:44,507
Cale Bryant hammered
through that turn.

1182
01:22:44,575 --> 01:22:47,927
He is hot right now, with
Derek Black a close second.

1183
01:22:49,446 --> 01:22:51,782
Go, Cale!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Do it!

1184
01:22:51,849 --> 01:22:53,834
[Announcer]
Number 71 has the lead.

1185
01:22:53,901 --> 01:22:57,237
Cale Bryant,
with Derek Black, 37,
in second place,

1186
01:22:57,305 --> 01:23:00,957
and they have
left the pack behind
by several lengths so far.

1187
01:23:01,024 --> 01:23:06,162
Cale Bryant into the turn.
He is on fire.

1188
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:08,498
Go, Cale! Go!

1189
01:23:08,565 --> 01:23:10,250
Take it easy, bro.

1190
01:23:10,317 --> 01:23:14,187
Cale Bryant fighting
for first, with Derek Black
pressing down hard.

1191
01:23:17,808 --> 01:23:19,726
Cale Bryant in the lead.

1192
01:23:19,793 --> 01:23:23,797
He's taking that turn high
on the hill, but Derek Black's
coming on, pushing him higher.

1193
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:27,784
Derek Black is pushing him up.
He's pushing. He's pushing him.

1194
01:23:27,852 --> 01:23:30,419
- Cale is out!
Cale Bryant is out!
- Cale!

1195
01:23:30,487 --> 01:23:32,638
[Announcer]
Bryant is down!

1196
01:23:32,706 --> 01:23:34,207
Oh! Oh, my God.

1197
01:23:34,274 --> 01:23:36,326
And Derek Black
takes the lead.

1198
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,774
- Cale Bryant is up,
and he's back in the race--
- Oh!

1199
01:23:51,876 --> 01:23:53,626
but a long way out.

1200
01:23:53,694 --> 01:23:56,146
I don't know if there's any way
he can catch Derek Black,

1201
01:23:56,213 --> 01:23:58,447
who is still leading the pack.

1202
01:23:58,515 --> 01:24:01,250
[Grant]
Bryant is back up,
but he is way back in the pack.

1203
01:24:01,318 --> 01:24:03,787
He seems to be in about
ninth place right now.

1204
01:24:13,147 --> 01:24:16,049
[Announcer]
And Cale Bryant has moved
into eighth-- no, seventh--

1205
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:19,219
- Wait. Sixth place!
- Go, Cale! Come on!

1206
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:22,689
[Announcer] Bryant,
number 71, moving up fast.
This is amazing, folks.

1207
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:27,694
He's taking some big risks out
there, but they're paying off,
and he's narrowing the gap.

1208
01:24:29,296 --> 01:24:31,731
Yeah!
Yes!

1209
01:24:33,734 --> 01:24:37,319
[Announcer]
Cale Bryant has moved
into second place,

1210
01:24:37,387 --> 01:24:40,407
and, boys and girls,
we have ourselves a race.

1211
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:42,175
Come on, Cale!

1212
01:24:42,393 --> 01:24:46,662
Derek Black
still has a big lead,
but Bryant is chasing him down.

1213
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:49,498
Yeah!

1214
01:24:49,566 --> 01:24:52,002
It's a two-man race, folks--
a two-man race--

1215
01:24:52,069 --> 01:24:55,021
with Black in the lead,
and Bryant right behind.

1216
01:24:55,088 --> 01:24:58,758
- Come on, buddy.
Throttle down! Throttle down!
- Look at Cale Bryant go!

1217
01:24:58,826 --> 01:25:01,177
He is chasing him down.

1218
01:25:01,244 --> 01:25:04,447
It looks like Black is gonna
try and cut him off again. Oh!

1219
01:25:04,514 --> 01:25:07,968
Bryant does a brake check,
and knocks Derek Black off
his bike and out of the lead.

1220
01:25:08,035 --> 01:25:10,954
- Cale Bryant is out in front.
- Yeah, Cale! Whoo!

1221
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:13,306
Oh, my God! Wow!
Get him, buddy!

1222
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:17,760
This is amazing. All the way
from the back of the pack, Cale
Bryant is now in first place.

1223
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:23,650
[Grant]
It's gonna seem like
the longest lap of his life.

1224
01:25:30,774 --> 01:25:33,709
He lost his chain.

1225
01:25:33,777 --> 01:25:35,361
- Cale!
- No, Cale!

1226
01:25:37,114 --> 01:25:40,800
[Announcer]
Oh, Cale Bryant is down!
Cale Bryant is down!

1227
01:25:40,868 --> 01:25:43,603
- It's over.
- He seems to have lost
his chain, folks.

1228
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:46,138
It's all over
for Cale Bryant.
Cale!

1229
01:25:46,206 --> 01:25:48,808
[Trent]
Get up, buddy!
Come on. Get up!

1230
01:25:48,876 --> 01:25:52,745
[Groans, Grunts]

1231
01:25:52,813 --> 01:25:56,232
[Announcer]
Now Derek Black is back up, and
he may still have a chance here.

1232
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:59,285
Derek Black is back up.
Bryant is on his feet.

1233
01:25:59,353 --> 01:26:03,205
- What the heck is he doing?
- He seems okay, but his machine
is done for the day.

1234
01:26:14,985 --> 01:26:16,636
[Trent]
This is beautiful.
Come on, Cale!

1235
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:18,605
Yeah! Go, Cale!

1236
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:23,092
[Trent]
Keep it going. Keep it coming.
Come on. Push. Push.

1237
01:26:30,468 --> 01:26:32,202
Come on, Cale!

1238
01:26:32,269 --> 01:26:34,120
This is quite remarkable.

1239
01:26:34,188 --> 01:26:38,308
I have never seen
anything like this.

1240
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:40,310
[Grunting]

1241
01:26:42,196 --> 01:26:44,847
[Trent, Justin Shouting]

1242
01:26:44,915 --> 01:26:47,116
Keep going, buddy!
Ace that finish line!

1243
01:26:47,184 --> 01:26:49,502
Come on!
Yeah, Cale! Go!

1244
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:52,672
[Announcer]
Cale Bryant is pushing his bike
to the finish line.

1245
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:56,175
Derek Black,
moving on in second,
coming hard and fast.

1246
01:26:56,243 --> 01:26:59,980
Derek Black is coming at him
hard and fast.

1247
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:14,060
Cale Bryant wins!

1248
01:27:17,598 --> 01:27:19,365
[Screams]

1249
01:27:19,433 --> 01:27:21,551
And Cale Bryant
has done the impossible.

1250
01:27:21,618 --> 01:27:25,271
He's literally
dragged his bike across the
finish line for first place.

1251
01:27:25,339 --> 01:27:28,758
Cale Bryant wins!
Cale Bryant wins!
[Alex] Cale!

1252
01:27:30,227 --> 01:27:32,512
Cale, you won!

1253
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:38,852
[Screams]

1254
01:27:38,919 --> 01:27:40,887
Hey, buddy, come on.
You guys see that?

1255
01:27:40,954 --> 01:27:44,107
You can't push a bike
across the line.
That's illegal.

1256
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:55,118
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold up, hold up.

1257
01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:58,704
Cale, you have to be aboard
your bike when you cross
the finish line.

1258
01:27:58,772 --> 01:28:01,040
I'm sorry.
You're disqualified.

1259
01:28:07,431 --> 01:28:10,833
[Announcer] Derek Black
takes the checkered flag
and 100 points.

1260
01:28:10,901 --> 01:28:13,386
[Cheering]
[Laughing]
Yeah.

1261
01:28:13,453 --> 01:28:16,489
Hey, man, congratulations.
Thanks.

1262
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:20,393
Cale! Hey, hey.
Wait up, bro.

1263
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,211
I've got a bad leg.
[Announcer]
Champion, Derek Black!

1264
01:28:22,279 --> 01:28:24,964
You good?
Yeah, I'm good.

1265
01:28:25,032 --> 01:28:29,635
Ladies and gentlemen,
A.M.A. Motocross Champion
Grant Langston!

1266
01:28:29,703 --> 01:28:32,972
I've been around the sport
for more than 20 years, and I
have never seen anything...

1267
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,640
like I witnessed
out there today--

1268
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:38,912
Cale Bryant pushing
his broken motorcycle
across the finish line.

1269
01:28:38,979 --> 01:28:43,816
Cale, where are you?
Cale Bryant, can you come
to the podium, please?

1270
01:28:45,619 --> 01:28:47,319
Come on up.

1271
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:51,190
Cale Bryant, pushing
that broken motorcycle
across the finish line,

1272
01:28:51,258 --> 01:28:53,426
turning round to go and
pick up a wounded friend--

1273
01:28:53,493 --> 01:28:55,911
That took guts.

1274
01:28:55,979 --> 01:28:59,849
Cale, on that note,
I just want to say,
welcome to the pro tour.

1275
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:02,468
Congratulations.
What?

1276
01:29:04,371 --> 01:29:09,341
- Yeah!
- [Bailey] He did it!
Uh-huh! Oh, yeah!

1277
01:29:09,409 --> 01:29:11,927
- My son won!
- We never said we want
to pick the winner.

1278
01:29:11,995 --> 01:29:14,647
We said we'd pick
the best rider.

1279
01:29:14,715 --> 01:29:18,601
I'm taking this to the A.M.A.--
Hey, you know what, Dad?
Just shut up for once, please.

1280
01:29:18,669 --> 01:29:20,920
Come on now, Son.
I'm just trying
to help you.

1281
01:29:20,987 --> 01:29:23,773
- Come here.
- You won that race.
Come on. Hey--

1282
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,028
Would you put your hands
together for our new
pro rider, Cale Bryant!

1283
01:29:29,096 --> 01:29:31,530
- Oh!
- Whoo!

1284
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:33,466
That's our boy.
That's our boy.

1285
01:29:34,851 --> 01:29:37,486
[Justin]
Yeah, buddy!
Attaboy, Cale! Whoo-hoo!

1286
01:29:47,697 --> 01:29:50,033
I'm so proud of you.

1287
01:29:52,502 --> 01:29:56,022
Whoo! Whoo!

1288
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,907
[Laughing]
Yeah!

1289
01:30:03,947 --> 01:30:07,950
¶ [Rock]

1290
01:30:11,204 --> 01:30:13,790
- You really want to
do this, Maynard?
- You backing out already?

1291
01:30:13,857 --> 01:30:15,925
Nah, college boy.
I'm just giving you
an easy way out.

1292
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:18,845
- Remember, you're pretty rusty.
- I'm never too rusty
to dust your--

1293
01:30:18,912 --> 01:30:20,730
I guess we'll find out.
You guys ready?

1294
01:30:20,797 --> 01:30:22,715
Yeah.
Yeah.

1295
01:30:22,783 --> 01:30:25,101
- Dude.
- I know.

1296
01:30:25,168 --> 01:30:27,436
Yeah.
Okay?

1297
01:30:27,504 --> 01:30:29,505
Here we go!

1298
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:36,245
¶ Looking back on
the photo album of my life ¶

1299
01:30:36,313 --> 01:30:40,682
¶ It's the little things
that make me smile ¶
¶ That-That make me smile ¶

1300
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:44,687
¶ Like the very first time that
you discovered true love ¶
Whoo-hoo!

1301
01:30:44,755 --> 01:30:48,324
¶ It's a feeling
you can't describe ¶
Yeah!

1302
01:30:48,392 --> 01:30:50,193
¶ But it always
stays on your mind ¶

1303
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,295
¶ Or the first time you hear
a song on the radio ¶

1304
01:30:53,363 --> 01:30:57,332
¶ That gives you goose bumps
all over from head to toe ¶

1305
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:01,471
¶ Or the time
you stayed up all night
talking on the phone ¶

1306
01:31:01,538 --> 01:31:06,693
¶ And you looked up
and realized she's staring
at the same star as you ¶

1307
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:10,279
[People Laughing]
¶ That's what
makes me sentimental ¶

1308
01:31:10,347 --> 01:31:14,183
All right.
I could probably use
a few things.

1309
01:31:14,251 --> 01:31:16,285
All right.
You want to help me?
[Phone Rings]

1310
01:31:16,353 --> 01:31:20,089
Oh, goodness gracious.
Hello!

1311
01:31:21,792 --> 01:31:25,128
Find Crystal

I mean-- Wait.

01:31:25,195 --> 01:31:28,197
Crap.
Find Crystal--
Hold on.

¶ These are the moments
that matter, matter ¶

1314
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:33,986
I just forgot my line.

01:31:34,054 --> 01:31:38,524
Oh, my God.
Crap, it's my line.
What is the line?

and love ¶

Are we doing my version?
Which version?

1319
01:31:46,283 --> 01:31:49,585
Just the entrance fee.
How does this go?

1320
01:31:49,653 --> 01:31:54,240
I've never seen
a grown man beg so much
in my life. Why?

I'll be back.

What a turd.

01:32:09,723 --> 01:32:12,475
What the hell
is your problem?

1327
01:32:12,542 --> 01:32:15,144
No, that's not right.

1328
01:32:15,212 --> 01:32:18,447
[Laughs]
Sorry.
