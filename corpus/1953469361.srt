I told you, I run

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,897
Hit it, Troy the Boy.

You ain't hit nothin'.

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,128
Look at that. You hit air.

30
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,176
- I told you so.
- Lucky shot.

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,057

32
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,809
Oh, Daddy! Dang!

35
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,372
I don't want to hear it. Let's go.

36
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,619
I'm tired of that Strat-o-Matic.
Bring your brother in.

37
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,573
- I'll beat you.
- I was in the lead.

38
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,930
He just hit a home run.

39
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,577
- These plates are heavy.
- This thing hurts.

40
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,012
Tell Clinton and Wendell
to come and eat.

41
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,536
Clinton, Wendell, time to eat!

42
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,651
I could have done that.

43
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,092
- Woody, that's enough sugar.
- Come on, everybody, let's eat.

44
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,772
Can I have a piece of lemon, Daddy?

45
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,370
- Can't I eat somethin' else?
- Won't get better.

46
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,617
- Black-eyed peas are nasty.
- Let's bow our heads.

47
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,415
- Take your elbows off the table.
- Clinton's in my chair.

48
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,770
- Clinton, let's go.
- Eat already.

49
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,540
- Food's getting cold.
- Be quiet, move.

50
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,174
- I'm not really hungry.
- Come on, Boogie.

51
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,929
- Food's getting cold.
- Be quiet!

52
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,530
All right, everybody,
let's bow our heads.

53
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,736
Lord, thank you for this food. Amen.

54
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,412
Heavenly Father... We thank thee
for the food we're about to receive

55
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,817
for the nourishment of our bodies,
for Christ's sake. Amen.

56
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,453
Amen.

57
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,530
- Pass the butter.
- Move over.

58
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,092
Shucks, now. Every time
we sit down to eat, there he goes.

59
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,212
I just want white meat
and a little more potatoes.

60
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,378
That's all he eats.
Eat vegetables.

61
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,175
- Stop biting your nails.
- My peas are touching my chicken.

62
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,338
Baby. Just move it over.

63
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,570
That looks so good.

64
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,293
Get out of here, you Possoms!

65
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,411
- Mashed potato!
- Lemonade!

66
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,374
- String beans.
- Look at that chicken!

67
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,855
- What's she doing?
- Troy the Boy!

68
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,575
- And stay out!
- They should eat their dinner.

69
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,930
That was rude, my girl.

70
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,579
Wendell! Please close your mouth
when you chew.

71
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,453
- Can I eat in peace?
- You're disturbing the peace.

72
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,572
You eat like a pig and chew like a cow.

73
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,539
Come on, it's a compliment
to your good cooking.

74
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,049
My butt. That boy is just plain greedy.

75
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,171
- I'm done.
- You didn't eat nothin'.

76
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,454
- I did. I ate three peas.
- Mom, I'm full too.

77
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,094
- May I please be excused?
- No, you may not.

78
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,212
You sit there until you eat
every pea on your plate.

79
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,695
When I come home,
I want this kitchen clean.

80
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,210
- See what you started?
- I hate black-eyed peas.

81
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,456
- Here we go.
- That's right.

82
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,699
There is no reason why your father and I
should have to clean up after you.

83
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,937
- Daddy likes to clean.
- Leave me out of this.

84
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,131
Your daddy may not mind, but I do.

85
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,776
I'm going to your father's gig
and the house better be cleaned.

86
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,893
I be godammned if I should do anything
after work but sleep and relax.

87
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,739
Ew!

88
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,612
Daddy!

89
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,139
Excuse me.

90
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,013
It's the dinner table!
We're trying to eat!

91
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,494
Excuse me!

92
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,332
Oh, brother,
there he goes again!

93
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,849
Tony Eyes can't even sing.

94
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,899
Not tonight!

95
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,333
_ If I ever find
that you've changed at any time

96
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,091
_ It's not unusual
to find that I'm In love with you

97
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,057
It's not unusual
to find that I'm In love with you

98
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,493
Son of a bitch. Can't even enjoy my meal
without that funky faggot ruining it.

99
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,577
- Woodrow.
- It's true, Gem.

100
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,614
Put the salt down, Wendell,
before I pull your head off.

101
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,496
He got blowed up!

102
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,818
- See his hands?
- What are you laughing for?

103
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,614
He don't even know what's going on.

104
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,608
- They're gonna get him.
- They stopped him with the tank!

105
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,853
Troy.

106
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,539
Troy, what are you doing?

107
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,413
This isn't the bathroom,
get out of here.

108
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,612
That's disgusting.
You better clean that mess up, too.

109
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,129
Sorry.

110
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,818
Clinton. Have you lost your mind?

111
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,215
- What?
- I wanted the kitchen cleaned.

112
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,217
Get up, get up now. Come on.

113
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,456
It's four o'clock. Get up.

114
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,537
Get your butt in there.

115
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,208
Get in there
and do what I told you to do.

116
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,615
Hey, you, get up!

117
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,051
All you peanuts at attention,
before I... Now!

118
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,171
Hey, little one, everybody up!

119
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,769
Get your butt out of bed.
I'm sick of it.

120
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,699
I don't want to get up, Mommy!

121
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,810
Wendell! Don't play with me, boy.
Get up now.

122
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,817
Get your...

123
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,250
You'll get your butt up. Get up now!

124
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,769
What did I tell you to do?
What did I say?

125
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,891
- Get downstairs.
- Where's Daddy?

126
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,933
Your Daddy ain't here.
Get up. Come on.

127
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,291
- Can we do it in the morning?
- Up against the wall.

128
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,652
From now on, everybody's gonna start
pulling their weight, understand me?

129
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,249
- You're crazy.
- You make me crazy.

130
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,849
I'll slap the black off you.
This is no hotel.

131
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,212
I'll knock them teeth into tomorrow.
Get downstairs now.

132
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,810
Go. Get out of my face now.
Get out of my face right now.

133
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,137
- Do not wake your father.
- You're waking everybody up.

134
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,379
Shh! You know why I'm screaming,
don't you?

135
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,938
I am not crazy. You'll be crazy once
I beat your brains out of your head.

136
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,053
I'm crazy cos I got five of you
running me stark raving mad.

137
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,093
This ain't no plantation.
I'm not a slave.

138
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,055
And I tell you one damned thing,
I am not a plaything, understand me?

139
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,649
- What can I do?
- What I told you.

140
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,091
Clinton only washed one plate,
one fork and one knife.

141
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,177
- Heifer.
- Don't be a tattletale.

142
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,779
Don't call her a heifer.

143
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,973
You are gonna wash every fork,
plate, spoon, pot, pan,

144
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,853
our drawers and Mutley for a month.

145
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,609
- Wendell and Nate never do nothin'.
- I empty the garbage.

146
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,256
- Worry about your own shiftless self.
- I'm hungry.

147
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,896
Too bad, kitchen's closed.
Should have ate more than three peas.

148
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,534
- "I ate three peas!"
- Shut up.

149
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,574
Clinton, what kind of example
are you setting, being the oldest?

150
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,533
Can you hear me? You are so immature.

151
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,175
When you finish mashing peas, mop.

152
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,848
I'd rather have a father
than a mother any day.

153
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,858
- Yeah. Any day.
- What did you say?

154
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,732
What did you say?

155
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,012
He said, I'd rather
have a father than a mother.

156
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,617
Take your father. Take your father.
Let's see how your hungry asses eat.

157
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,014
I'm not playing. Come here.

158
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,933
Mornin', Ladybug. How are you today?

159
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,573
Fine.

160
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,691
How are you?

161
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,016
I'm good.

162
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,451
- Are you gonna eat some breakfast?
- No, thank you.

163
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,891
Troy, I was wondering,

164
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,091
Would you like to spend a few weeks

165
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,098
with Cousin Viola in Virginia
after school's out?

166
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,452
- They asked if you'd like to come.
- No, thank you.

167
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,891
- What are you gonna do this summer?
- I don't know.

168
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,412
I'm teaching summer school. You can't
run after your brothers all day long.

169
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,330
- Would I miss my birthday?
- You'd spend it with them.

170
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,100
That'd be good. That'd be great.

171
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,655
Would you please eat some breakfast?
I have to go to work.

172
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,896
[TV] Heavens to Mergatrold.

173
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,059
Exit for child welfare, stage right.

174
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,732
Don't you know better than
to stand under a loose boulder?

175
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:36,856
Heavens to vegetables,
I've been squashed.

176
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,576
The question Is, how does one baby-slt
a Western-type baby?

177
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,611
- Can I have some Trix?
- No.

178
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,459
- Please?
- I said no, you idiot!

179
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,414
- I'm telling Mom.
...a Western TV star.

180
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,933
Mommy! Troy's eating a box of Trix
and she won't share any with me!

181
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,098
Mommy's not here,
you silly, stupid rabbit.

182
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,450
Stupid.

183
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,776
...low-down, mangy coyote
of a wild steer.

184
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,016
Get out!

185
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,735
Do you get the picture?

186
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,058
Exit, stampeding all the way,
stage left.

187
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,410
Wendell!

188
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,373
Look at your eyes
popping out of your head.

189
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,173
Let's not hit people!

190
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,418
Snuff, you know
we stole that tube together.

191
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,737
You better share that, man.

192
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,699
- Ah, yeah!
- Ah!

193
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,573
- My best friend, babe.
- Nice glue.

194
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,930
All right.

195
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,689
- To the brothers that ain't here.
- Drain it out, baby.

196
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,777
All right.

197
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,540
All right. Shake it.

198
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,812
If I could, I'd like to be

199
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,810
A great big movie star

200
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,899
Overnight sensation

201
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,252
Drive a big expensive car...

202
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,976
Don't throw bottles!
We always get blamed for it.

203
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,136
He should clean his stinking house.

204
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,013
Hey! Hey! You stinkin' faggot!

205
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,973
Hey! Olean up
after your friggin' dogs, man!

206
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,138
- That ain't funny.
- Puerto Rican chink spic.

207
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,774
You friggin' nigger moron!

208
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,575
- Hey, what you say that for?
- Don't let him talk about me like that.

209
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,214
- I never say nothin' bad about you.
- Your mama.

210
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,015
- Play your music.
- I'm emotional. I can't sing now.

211
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,619
You can't sing anyway.

212
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,936
Wait a minute.

213
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,372
Oh, my man Vic.

214
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,810
- How you doin', Vic?
- Tommy LaLa.

215
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,810
I'm all right. Like that do.
Your mama know you're out here?

216
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,012
- What's up, Vic?
- How you feelin', kid?

217
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,573
All right.

218
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,059
- Vic, my number one soul brother.
- All right.

219
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,015
Great God!

220
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,654
- Bye, Vic.
- That's the bigs.

221
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,692
- It looks funny.
- Stupid.

222
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,858
- So? Look at yours.
- Mine don't look funny like yours.

223
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,496
Mine isn't standin' on my head
stickin' straight out like Topsy.

224
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,931
I don't know who Topsy is, but it looks
stupid and I can't stand you.

225
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,778
I can't stand you either.

226
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,574
- Sit down your black self.
- I'm black and proud.

227
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,499
- She got good hair.
- Peter Rican hair.

228
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,170
- Stop touching me, ugly.
- Don't call my sister ugly.

229
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,850
- I'll slap you.
- You ain't slappin' nobody, stupid.

230
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,019
- Get lost. You think you're pretty.
- I can't stand you either, Minnie.

231
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,256
Later for you. You think you're cute.

232
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,816
- Come on, who wants to jump rope?
- Me, I wanna play.

233
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,295
Brenda and Cathy, you're turning.

234
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,210
- You always tell us what to do.
- I'm older. Don't give me no lip.

235
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,014
Minnie and Troy get in the middle.

236
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,688
Shut up and get in the rope.

237
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,858
Here, kitty, kitty.

238
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,739
Come here.

239
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,210
You better not throw that cat!

240
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,418
She looks like a gorilla.

241
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,976
Shut up, your welfare self
has been left behind how many times?

242
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,852
Stupid ass dummy!

243
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,858
- So?
- So your mother's a ho!

244
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,492
- Who's got money for us?
- Give it up.

245
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,370
- What happened to your shoe?
- Damn kids broke my shoe, man.

246
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,212
Snuff, man.

247
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,298
Got to get some bread, nigger.

248
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,576
I've got all night, Nate.

249
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,374
Come on, Mommy. Why do I gotta eat this?

250
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,979
Peas have calcium.

251
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,013
All the calcium can't make up for
this nasty taste.

252
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,939
It might have made up for
your broke arm.

253
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,052
I broke my arm because I just got hurt.

254
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,491
Besides, this is gross. Nasty.

255
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,895
It is not nasty.
Everybody else likes it.

256
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,658
They're all crazy.

257
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,532
You're sitting here to eat.

258
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,335
Desserts anybody?
I got ice-cream and cake.

259
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,498
- Who wants some?
- I do.

260
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,612
- Bring some spoons and plates.
- All right!

261
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,938
- I don't want them having junk.
- It's just a little sand cake.

262
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,017
Get rid of this.

263
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,893
You get nothin'
till you finish your peas.

264
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,455
- How come these fools get to have it?
- You know what?

265
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,015
Finish your food,
I'll save you a piece, OK?

266
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,051
- Yum, yum.
- It looks good.

267
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,535
It tastes good, too.

268
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,493
- Scrumptiadilious.
- Scrumptiadelicious.

269
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,216
Hits the spot.
Take a bite, it's so moist.

270
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,730
Sweet. Come on, Red.

271
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,216
- Clinton called me Red.
- Red, Red, pees in the bed.

272
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,217
- Shut up.
- Ugly monkey.

273
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,538
He ate my cake! Mommy, he ate my cake!

274
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,255
Hey, Boogie.
You got a brand new piece, OK?

275
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,293
- Daddy, that's my piece!
- All right, here.

276
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,650
Half for him and half for you.

277
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,852
Nate. I'm tired of
standing here waiting.

278
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,655
Pick up the fork and eat the peas.

279
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,094
Now!

280
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,858
Now.

281
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,533
Eat the peas!

282
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,935
Do like your mother tell you.

283
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,940
Do I have to finish my peas?

284
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,370
That's OK, Doc.
Let's get you to the bathroom.

285
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,571
That's disgusting!

286
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,017
OK, all right, little mister.
I saw you.

287
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,610
Did you think you were a secret
commando with no-one watching?

288
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,291
I am always watching and you are going
to stop throwing garbage in my area way.

289
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,331
You're imagining things.

290
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,737
Oh, OK, smarty-pants.
I'm gonna call the police.

291
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,250
Let the cops see how you live,
you filthy, stinkin' pig.

292
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,337
- Who's a pig?
- You're a pig.

293
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,576
You come from a whole family of pigs.

294
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,171
I see you and your friend throwing that
garbage in my area way and my backyard.

295
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,339
Just shut the hell up. How dare you
talk about my family like that?

296
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,293
- You should be shot.
- Wendell, what's wrong?

297
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,855
This man accused me
of things I didn't do.

298
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,290
You'll see. Look, look.

299
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,617
Look at him,
picking up his own garbage.

300
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,739
I caught him throwing this trash
on my property.

301
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,613
He's the ringleader,
makes his friends do the same.

302
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,732
How dare you? He does no such thing.

303
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,012
- Yes, it's him and this other one.
- We don't do nothin'.

304
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,974
My kids can't sit on our stoop
or play in our backyard

305
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,458
without having to smell that disgusting
odour of dog shit from your house.

306
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,299
- How can you live in filth?
- My house is not filthy.

307
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,060
- Yours is.
- You know nothin' about my house.

308
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,172
You are a menace
and a disgrace to this entire block.

309
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,178
The board of health
ought to shut you down.

310
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,530
High waters!

311
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,493
Pull down your pants
or pull up your ankles!

312
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,168
You're disturbing the peace around here.

313
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,371
I never had trouble till you moved in.

314
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,936
Listen, you better be glad
we moved in here.

315
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,132
If you call my kids names
or accuse them of anything,

316
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,932
you'll have to deal with me.

317
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,576
- Call yourself a mother?
- Get your finger out my face.

318
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,817
Keep them inside. You killed my mother!

319
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,409
- What?!
- You killed my mother!

320
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,859
All right, all right.

321
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,768
Be quiet!

322
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,538
- You can't!
- Tony!

323
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,699
- My mother was a good person!
- Get you ass into your dog-house.

324
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,619
- You can't tell...
- I'm tired of listening to you.

325
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,738
- I'll call the cops!
- Get in the house!

326
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,489
Call the police!
I'm gonna sue you! I'm gonna sue you!

327
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,935
You can't do this!
You know what happened, look at this.

328
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,700
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen to you.

329
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,179
_ I'll never go back to Georgia

330
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,178
_ I'll never go back to Georgia

331
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,417
_ I'll never go back to Georgia

332
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,293
_ I'll never go back to Georgia

333
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,060
_ I'll never go back to Georgia...

334
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,572
What you talkin' 'bout?

335
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,179
I ain't no puta.

336
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,655
I ain't no puta.

337
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,772
I'm Connie. I keeps my panty clean.

338
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,574
- Oh, come on, Connie.
- No, no, no, Tito.

339
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,213
You're crazy.

340
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,490
- Mira, ten cents.
- Hold your horses.

341
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,373
Give me two liquorice sticks,
ten Bazookas,

342
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,855
some lemonheads, some fireballs,

343
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,097
and some Boston baked beans.

344
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,894
- Está muy callente.
- Is that right?

345
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,853
You ain't nothin'
but a damned Puerto Rican.

346
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,618
I give you something good.

347
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,450
Oh, yeah, that's
what you say to all the fine things!

348
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,094
- Come on.
- No, no.

349
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,972
No, no, no puta.

350
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,489
No tickee, no tockee, Tito.

351
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,496
Why don't you arrest that
stinkin' Tony in that stinkin' house?

352
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,091
Don't worry baby,
I'm gonna get you out tomorrow, OK?

353
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,973
- Go home.
- Don't push me.

354
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,217
- Go home.
- Don't yell at me, either.

355
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,208
Come on,
he wasn't doing anything.

356
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,777
Vic, don't worry.
I'll come and visit you tomorrow.

357
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,619
I'll get you out.

358
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,380
You and that stinking house!

359
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,140
Shut up, you prostitute!

360
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,298
I am not a prostitute!

361
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,491
[TV] I don't wanna think about lt.

362
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,373
Hey, what are you all doing in here?
Get off my bed.

363
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,378
- The cops took Vic away.
- I know.

364
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,571
- What's in that bag?
- Want some candy?

365
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,930
- Psych your mind.
- Eggies. Thumbs up.

366
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,210
- I called no eggies first.
- When?

367
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,059
- When I bought it.
- That don't count.

368
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,171
- Eggies.
- You never give me nothin'.

369
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,214
- Shut up, evil flat-chested wench.
- For that, you're not getting any.

370
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,299
- I'm telling Ma you called me that.
- Go ahead.

371
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,537
You are an evil wench.
I'll tell her you went to the store.

372
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,573
- Nigger.
- Pop-eyed heifer.

373
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,931
I want the lemonheads.

374
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,415
I throwed you the red one.

375
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,293
- Can you chew with your mouth closed?
- Yeah!

376
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,572
Don't start with me.
I don't need you to fight my battles.

377
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,453
Quiet, it's the good part.

378
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,659
They even know the words.
Y'all turnin' so white.

379
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,532
They want to be white.

380
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,370
_ Went to sleep with you on my mind

381
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,212
_ Nate woke up In pee this morning

382
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,571
_ I woke up In love this morning

383
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,659
_ Went to sleep with you on my mind

384
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,090
Is the TV on?!

385
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,652
- I said, is the TV on?!
- No!

386
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,738
Be quiet.

387
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,570
- Don't turn it off.
-  I'm just turning it down.

388
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,772
_ I woke up In love this morning

389
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,052
_ I woke up In love this morning

390
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,172
- This show is stupid.
- Let's watch the Knicks.

391
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,291
Joseph, please change your vote.

392
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,288
- I'm watching The Partridge Family.
- He won't change his vote.

393
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,378
- We win.
- We watch the Knicks.

394
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,969
Hey, hey. Come on, get out.

395
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,410
Out! Out! Let's go.

396
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,180
- Out!
- We ain't buyin' nothin'.

397
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,894
- It smells funny.
- It stinks.

398
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,491
- I'll tell your mother.
- Tell her.

399
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,933
Hey!

400
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,654
What are you doing? Huh?

401
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,614
I'm talking to you. What are you doing?

402
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,373
Huh?

403
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,573
You think you can
come into my store and steal? Huh?

404
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,692
- Do I go to your house and take things?
- No.

405
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,811
No. Ten cents.

406
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,490
- Ten cents.
- I don't have any money.

407
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,736
What? No money?

408
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,250
Send her to jail.

409
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,693
No money, huh?

410
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:38,208
OK. Then get outta here and don't
come back until you got some money. OK?

411
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,255
What took you so long?

412
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,532
- You let him catch you?
- What was I supposed to do?

413
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,573
You should have said,
"I don't have to steal from you."

414
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,294
- "I forgot my money."
- Oh.

415
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,138
Steal something easier.

416
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,130
Yeah, my main man, Walt Frazier.
We better win tonight.

417
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,973
Stupid.
Don't pass the ball to him.

418
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,456
Jackson ain't nothin'.
He can't even dribble.

419
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,017
Pass it to Frazier
if you're gonna pass it to anybody.

420
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,211
Come on.

421
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,810
Pass it to him,
pass it to Frazier, come on!

422
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,056
Frazier! Yeah, tough shot!

423
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,773
It went in!

424
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,778
I knew he'd make it.
That's number one, right there.

425
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,169
Only one way to find out.

426
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,100
Damn it, Woody,
you bounced another cheque.

427
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,894
Thought we had it covered.

428
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,250
I'll get some money.

429
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,734
When?

430
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,932
When? What do you think
I'm doing right here?

431
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,779
Gem, let me just finish this music.

432
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,572
That's what I've always done.

433
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,613
Your music's not bringing
anything into the house.

434
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,617
The money will come.

435
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,294
I'm waiting.

436
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,812
I'm back teaching school
again and I am waiting.

437
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,580
Just keep doing what you're doing.

438
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,409
You know I made money before,
I'll make money again.

439
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:54,058
I trust you but you have got to realise
we are on a limited budget.

440
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,376
I am trying to balance everything.

441
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,971
If you write cheques and don't tell me,
it makes it extremely difficult.

442
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,977
As God is my witness, I want the best
for you and the children.

443
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,853
But I've got to do it in my own way.

444
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,334
Cool?

445
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,100
Cool. I opened a separate bank account.

446
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,497
That supposed to get
some kind of reaction from me?

447
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,453
- What is that supposed to prove?
- I don't know.

448
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:31,016
I'm interested in food on the table
and a roof over our heads.

449
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,539
Boy!

450
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,379
You know, you... you really kill me.

451
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,775
On the one hand, you come down here

452
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,495
telling me about yet another mistake
Woody done made.

453
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,375
But when I'm sitting at that piano,
trying to work, concentrate,

454
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,377
you won't let me do that either.

455
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,378
You got a beef with that?
I don't know what to do.

456
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,889
You can get up off my chair.

457
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,570
I don't want to talk about
your mistakes, I don't have time.

458
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,568
All I ask you to do is to write down
when you spend the money I am making.

459
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,214
I done told you,
it was a legitimate mistake.

460
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,378
You've made that mistake
five times this month.

461
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,252
I want you to change the pattern.

462
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,248
I don't need no lecture from you
on how to conduct myself in this house.

463
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,772
I'm asking you to help me conduct
the business affairs of this family.

464
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,494
What the hell am I trying to do?!

465
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,452
I don't know what you're doing.

466
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,810
I know you don't.
Well, let me tell you.

467
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,491
I got to be like a thief in the night,
every time I want privacy to do my work.

468
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,009
Selfish child!
Don't tell me about privacy!

469
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,539
Selfish, nothin'!

470
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,379
I can't take a piss
without six people on my tits.

471
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,571
You're the big saint and I ain't shit?

472
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,409
Call yourself what you want to.
Just write down the cheque.

473
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,771
I will note the cheque, right there.

474
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,575
I think you can do two things at once.
Make music and write.

475
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,975
"Woody...

476
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,057
...wrote...

477
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,969
...a bum cheque."

478
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,611
- Here.
- That's very cute.

479
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,017
Remember to write it down
before it bounces next time.

480
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,849
You seem to forget, I'm the one
who used to pay for you and the children

481
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,655
to go to Bloomingdale's and get
what you wanted, when you wanted.

482
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,250
- You ain't the only one...

483
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,815
It's a foul! What a referee!

484
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,580
Clinton! Clinton!

485
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,340
- What?!
- Don't answer me "what"!

486
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,974
- Turn the TV off.
- I'm watching the Knicks.

487
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,456
I don't care. No TV on a school night.

488
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,935
Let her scream. I'm watching this game.

489
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,098
Hey! No TV! Turn it off!

490
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,256
- It's just a game!
- Who is that?

491
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,894
- That was Nate.
- It wasn't me!

492
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,409
If the TV's not off,
I'll whop everybody.

493
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,090
Troy, I have to go to the bathroom!

494
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,258
Open up before I pee on myself!

495
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,734
Come on, Troy.

496
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,856
Troy, what are you doing?!

497
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,130
Open the door!

498
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,615
You better chastise your boys.

499
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,415
Hey! Clinton,
don't make me come up there!

500
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,656
-  Clinton!
-  Troy!

501
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,134
In a minute!

502
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:12,130
- Walt Frazier doesn't pay my bills.
- It ain't about no Walt Frazier!

503
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,891
Surprise, boys.

504
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,773
- I'm watching the Knicks!
- What's the big deal?

505
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,619
The big deal is,
I said no TV on a school night.

506
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,936
The Knicks got a job.
You need education.

507
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,495
I'll throw this idiot box
out the window.

508
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,329
- Let Boogie in the bathroom.
- She won't let me watch the game.

509
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,977
- How dare you go to your father?
- Let him watch the game. Let's go.

510
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,614
- Woody, please, don't touch me now.
- Come on.

511
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,778
- Get your hands off me.
- I want the bathroom!

512
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,098
I own this house.
I pay Con Ed for the electricity.

513
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,579
When you start paying bills, you can
decide when the TV's on and when not.

514
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,499
- I'm watching this game.
- I'm gonna knock you out!

515
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,938
Shut up! Shut up!

516
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,095
What I want...

517
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,336
...is some respect...

518
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,896
...for my work in this house.

519
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,217
You get out of my house.

520
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,173
You call your brother,

521
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,689
and you tell him
to come and get your shit.

522
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,016
That's just fine.

523
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,132
If that's what you want,
that's what you get.

524
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,934
See what you did?
See what you started?

525
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,849
-  It wasn't my fault.
- Wanna go to your room?

526
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,210
Want some ice?

527
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,097
- Hey, Miss Coomish Mimmish.
- Hi, Uncle Brown.

528
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,450
Here's the other bag, man.

529
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,173
- Ready to go?
- Yep.

530
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,292
- Get down.
- Where's Clinton and Nate?

531
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,968
Nate's with Mommy
and Clinton's in his room.

532
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,217
OK, Boogie, I'm gonna see you soon.

533
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,015
No, come on, now.
No, we talked about this.

534
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,212
You're gonna be a big man,
I'll put you in a big chair.

535
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,648
Like that?

536
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,017
- Bye bye, Daddy.
- Bye bye.

537
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,973
All right, Miss Coomish Mimmish.

538
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,410
Don't go, Daddy.

539
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,612
You're too grown to give me a hug, huh?

540
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,059
Come on.

541
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,459
Now...

542
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,776
I'll be over at Uncle Brown's.

543
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,131
You have his number.
Call me if you need me, OK?

544
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,649
- OK.
- Wendell?

545
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,852
Come on, Wendell. Don't be like that.

546
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,891
Wendell.

547
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,489
- OK, Troy?
- Yes, Daddy.

548
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,374
All right.

549
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,453
Bye, Dad.

550
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,932
Good morning, Mommy.

551
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,210
How are you today?

552
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,412
I'm fine. Thank you, Ladybug.

553
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,295
- I made you some breakfast.
- I see.

554
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,218
Thanks.

555
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,937
- Are all of you mad at me?
- Yeah.

556
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,772
I'll get it.

557
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,858
Hi, Daddy.

558
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,496
- Hey, where's Mommy?
- In her room.

559
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,850
I want to talk to you.

560
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,208
Guess what? I cleaned the kitchen
and I made Mommy breakfast.

561
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,614
That's great.

562
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,290
- I think she's feeling better now.
- That's good.

563
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,616
- Your father's sorry about last night.
- It's not your fault, Daddy.

564
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,735
You know, Daddy doesn't want to fight
or yell or scream or holler.

565
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,976
All Daddy wants to do...

566
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,411
...is play his music. That's all.

567
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:28,091
Maybe if you played other people's music
Mommy wouldn't scream and yell at you.

568
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,894
I can't do that any more, Troy.

569
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,773
I got to work on my music now.

570
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,258
Well, maybe you should just go for
taking her out on a date.

571
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,853
- You think so, huh?
- I do.

572
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,535
Hey, listen.

573
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,049
This is for you and your brothers.

574
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,892
- You don't like candy no more?
- No, I do.

575
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,658
I want you to take and give this
to your mother from me.

576
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,814
- OK?
- Sure.

577
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,330
- Everybody else doing all right?
- Yeah, I think.

578
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,017
All right, Miss Coomish Mimmish.

579
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,378
Come here.

580
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,053
Hey.

581
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,850
Your father loves you, Troy.

582
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,813
I love you too, Daddy.

583
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,937
These are from Daddy.

584
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,939
You can at least open this.

585
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,608
He said to tell you
he wants to take you on a date.

586
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,776
Hmm!

587
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,899
Candy from Dad.

588
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,330
Can I have a quarter?

589
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,576
Thank you.

590
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,419
- I still say you're rich.
- No, we aren't.

591
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,215
You are. I can tell by these fancy
antiques and that foreign car.

592
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,775
It's not fancy, just rare.

593
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,699
- Agh!
- My God!

594
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,698
I gotta go.
Thanks for the ice cream.

595
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,493
Yeah!

596
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,260
Happy you drove my company away?

597
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,614
;Stupid! I hate you!

598
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,809
Idiot!

599
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,375
Hey, Wendell. You seen my tickets?

600
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,050
- It wasn't me.
- You can't find the tickets?

601
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,378
- I know man, I can't find 'em.
- Keep looking.

602
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,650
Troy!

603
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,249
Troy, I know
you can hear me calling you.

604
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,339
- Troy! Have you seen my Knicks tickets?
- Who cares...

605
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,735
- Did you see my tickets?
- I haven't...

606
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,534
- I'll break your neck.
- Break it then.

607
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,130
- Ow! Get off me!
- Shut up. Give me my tickets.

608
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,252
Why? You started the fight
between Mommy and Daddy.

609
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,372
- You're hurting me!
- Where are my tickets?

610
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,889
Gimme my tickets and I'll let you go.

611
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,013
All right, nigger. I hate your guts.
I hate your guts.

612
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,012
Who told you you could go in my room
in the first place?

613
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,780
Next time I'll punch you in your face.

614
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,337
- Heifer.
- I spent them funny-looking nickels.

615
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,893
Mom!

616
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,894
H-E-L-L-N-O and you are not it.

617
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,858
There's a German
In the grass, a bottle up his ass

618
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:43,097
Stick It In, stick It out
Do you wanna be a scout?

619
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,053
N-O spells no and you are not it.

620
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,898
Hot peas and butter!

621
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,170
Come and get your supper!

622
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,530
Come on, you can run faster than that.

623
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,857
I know you can find it.
Look at you, you can't even get it.

624
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,335
- Get outta here!
- Come on!

625
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,735
Miss Carmichael, I see you.

626
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,056
- Oh, be quiet.
- I heard that.

627
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,979
Better keep trying. You're cold.

628
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,774
Oh, you're hot.

629
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,335
Oh, you're boiling hot.

630
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,810
I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon.

631
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,853
- Bye, Troy.
- Bye, Minnie. See you tomorrow.

632
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,618
Where are you going, Troy?

633
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,900
- Stop following me, Greg.
- I ain't following you, Troy the Boy.

634
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,453
Troy!

635
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,013
Huh?

636
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,215
I need to ask you something.

637
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,658
Clinton claims you stole his
prize collection of buffalo nickels.

638
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,216
They're very valuable
and they mean a lot to him.

639
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,536
- Did you take them?
- No.

640
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,056
- Did you take them?
- No.

641
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,209
- You look cute Mrs. Carmichael.
- Thank you, Greg.

642
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,570
- How's your mother?
- She's OK.

643
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,259
- What's wrong?
- Troy.

644
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,009
She's always picking on me,
she teases me about school.

645
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,653
She calls my mother names.

646
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,614
She treats me mean.
Makes fun of me in front of our friends.

647
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,176
I wanna be her friend
but she doesn't like me.

648
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,656
-  I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

649
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,849
Troy!

650
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,211
Somebody left the toilet seat up.
I almost fell in again.

651
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,617
Never mind that.
I do not believe what I just heard.

652
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,015
Are you calling people's mothers names?

653
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,256
- I didn't!
- Don't lie to me.

654
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,657
Why is that child standing outside
with tears in his eyes?

655
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,169
You go back outside and apologise.

656
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,496
- But I didn't do anything!
- Go.

657
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,296
- Sorry, Greg.
- Sorry why?

658
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,138
Sorry I called your mother a ho.

659
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,332
Are you sorry about teasing me
about being left back?

660
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,577
About welfare and my brothers
having different fathers?

661
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,409
- All right, already. I said sorry.
- You better be.

662
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,135
- Thank you, Mrs. Carmichael.
- That's OK, baby.

663
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,811
- Stupid!
- Hey! Hey!

664
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,970
Hey, come here.

665
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,814
Go to the supermarket,
get things for dinner.

666
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,695
I hate food stamps.
Besides, we ain't on welfare.

667
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,529
Stop saying "ain't". You better be glad
we got food stamps. Go on.

668
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,129
Mommy, everyone's gonna laugh at me.

669
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,252
Nobody gonna laugh
that ain't on welfare their self.

670
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,973
How come I have to go?

671
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,899
Do you want to have
dinner tonight, Troy? Go.

672
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,539
Where are you going? Come back.
I've been watching you, you know.

673
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,254
If you don't put it down,
I'll call your mother.

674
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,816
- Call her, I haven't got a phone.
- Come on. Let's see.

675
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,454
Aha, what is this? Is this your hips?

676
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,537
- All right!
- Is this your other hip?

677
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,892
- Coconut West Indian monkey.
- Listen, you little pick ninny.

678
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,456
Get out of my store
and don't come back here no more!

679
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:17,097
Oh, God, these children. They don't know
how to act, they have no manners.

680
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,451
Miss, I'm sorry for the disturbance.

681
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,410
I'll get you, you ugly bitch!

682
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,135
- I didn't do nothin' to you. Get off!
- I saw you!

683
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,854
Hey! No fighting in front of the store.

684
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,494
- Get out of here, pick ninny!
- You shut up!

685
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,136
If your parents would teach you respect
you wouldn't be here.

686
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,810
You got your things?
Don't pay her no mind.

687
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,979
- You all right?
- I'm gonna punch you in your face.

688
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,933
You know where you live? OK, go ahead.

689
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,529
God! Back to work!

690
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,658
- Here, I told you not to send me.
- What on earth happened to you?

691
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,851
- She took the change too.
- Who?

692
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,698
- Peanut.
- What were you doing?

693
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,539
- Getting beat up.
- A boy beat you up?

694
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,174
- Peanut's a girl.
- How big is she?

695
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,940
Six-two, 200 pounds.

696
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,449
You wrestle your brothers all the time,

697
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,573
and you let some girl
take my groceries and my food stamps?

698
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,614
I should whup you myself.
Get your brother and go get my things.

699
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,539
That's all right. I hate liver anyway.

700
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,858
I'm glad Troy got her butt kicked.

701
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,449
She thinks she's so cute.

702
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,015
Shut up, you ugly black baboon.

703
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,849
- You ain't talking to me?
- Shut your moustachie self.

704
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,730
Ain't nobody gonna do nothin' about it.

705
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,253
- Agh!
- And stay off my stoop!

706
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,093
- Troy!
- You glue sniffers! Leave me alone!

707
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,610
- Where's our money?
- I ain't got money, only food stamps.

708
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,651
You know we take those too.

709
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,293
Leave me alone! Shut up!

710
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,055
Yeah, you like that, don't you?
Breathe in.

711
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,774
One more time, one more time.
Breathe out.

712
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,813
Get it, girl. Get it, girl, hey.

713
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,614
Bye, Troy!

714
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,015
Hey, Miss Coomish Mimmish.

715
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,819
I'm flying.

716
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,773
Snuffy and Right Hand Man
are chasing me.

717
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,177
No, Snuffy and Right Hand Man
are not here.

718
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,450
But Poppa's here.

719
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,292
Daddy, I'm glad you came back home.

720
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,094
Did you take Mom out yet?

721
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,019
Not yet, but I will.

722
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,575
Take her out now, Daddy.

723
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,532
Take her out now.

724
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,573
Young lady, I want you to get some rest.

725
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,293
Yeah?

726
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,011
It's for later.

727
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,938
They're spirited. But I don't know why
our kids are ostracized by your family.

728
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,335
- Welcome back, Daddy.
- Thanks, man.

729
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,258
Clinton, did you go to the game?

730
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,497
- Yeah, the Knicks won.
- Oh, yeah?

731
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,372
Daddy, you burnt the toast.

732
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,890
That ain't burnt, just a little dark.
Give it here.

733
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,694
Poor kids in the Delta would love
to have that to eat.

734
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,097
- And a father nice enough to burn it.
- OK.

735
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,337
You'll give us all heart attacks, Woody.

736
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,850
- Daddy, these eggs are runny.
- Eat those eggs!

737
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:44,053
The food was prepared by your pops
with loving care so you will eat it,

738
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,693
am I right?

739
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,688
Celeste has had Joan, Sam and Viola
out to St Lucia and none of our kids.

740
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,017
I ain't studying Celeste.
The woman is mean and evil.

741
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,450
- That's your sister.
- Yeah.

742
00:55:55,660 --> 00:56:00,336
- I don't want to visit Aunt Celeste.
- We don't need to visit nobody.

743
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,259
We got the car. We can go for a drive.

744
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,257
Can we leave Brooklyn?

745
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,020
- Can we please leave Brooklyn?
- Yes, we can.

746
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,849
Hey, Miss Coomish Mimmish. Come here.

747
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,334
- How's my girl?
- Good.

748
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,577
- Feeling better? Want some breakfast?
- Mm-hm.

749
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,853
- Ready for a drive after breakfast?
- After we clean up.

750
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,575
- What do we have to clean up for?
- I got an ailment.

751
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,931
Hey, hey, hey. After you all clean up.

752
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,371
- Can Mutley come, Daddy?
- Yeah, Mutley can come.

753
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,050
We're gettin' ready to get in the car,
and... Roll on, roll on...

754
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,137
- Here we go.
- Jinx! You owe me a Coke!

755
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:44,937
Roll on, little Citroen,
Roll on, roll on down the road _

756
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,180
- This is 7 Arlington Place, right?
- Yeah.

757
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:57,577
- I have to shut off your electricity.
- What?

758
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,930
- You gotta pay your bill.
- It's paid.

759
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:05,931
The bill is unpaid. "7 Arlington Place.
Unpaid bill. Service to be shut off."

760
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,812
Did you pay it?

761
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,695
Yes, I paid it. This is the second time
they made this mistake.

762
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,539
- Go back in the house.
- Oh, Daddy!

763
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,891
- You can call them.
- I'm gonna talk to these people.

764
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,979
- Just doin' my job.
- OK, you do what you gotta do.

765
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,129
All right.

766
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,459
Come on.

767
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,535
- It's so pretty.
- What are the candles here for?

768
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:40,289
- Santeria.
- It's like church. Turn the lights on.

769
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,491
- Ain't working.
- What do you mean?

770
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,499
- Hey, how you all doin'?
- Hi, Mr. Carmichael.

771
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,294
- You blow a fuse?
- What happened?

772
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,219
- Been waiting for you.
- What's with the candles?

773
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,412
- There's enough candles in here.
- Yeah, we, uh...

774
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,259
We're having some
financial problems right now.

775
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,577
We understand. I was hoping
the food stamps would help.

776
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,169
Um, anyway, like I was saying...

777
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,450
Here you go, Vic. We, uh...

778
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,572
We didn't blow no fuse.

779
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,135
- Damned electricity been cut off.
- What?

780
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,979
- Yeah. Drag, man.
- Come again?

781
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,013
We ain't got no electricity,
and neither do you.

782
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:24,054
You know I need my damned lights.
Can't sleep, can't think, can't read.

783
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:27,093
- It won't be long...
- How can I cook?

784
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,179
- A couple of days till we get straight.
- A couple of days?

785
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:35,896
Ain't that a bitch? Payin' good money
for rent and I ain't got no lights?

786
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,933
That's what I'm saying.
I can give you some candles.

787
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,769
- Forget candles.
- You don't understand.

788
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,699
My disability
requires that I have light.

789
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:51,338
I know it's an inconvenience
to you, Vic, to everybody.

790
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:54,850
I'm gonna go in the morning
and talk to the people, OK?

791
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:58,052
I hope you don't expect us
to pay rent, because

792
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,899
si no hay luz, no hay renta.
No lights, no rent.

793
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,332
Miss Jessica, I don't know about "us"
cos you don't even live here,

794
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,690
but I do expect you to pay, Vic.

795
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,572
Now I don't live here?

796
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,578
Did you hear? Are you gonna
let him say that to me?

797
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,816
I don't live here now?

798
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:19,252
I paid enough. I got enough shrapnel
in my back, I'm afraid to get wet.

799
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,213
I think I paid enough,
I paid far too damn much.

800
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:26,777
Well, hold up, hold up, there.
I don't want no hollerin' or screamin'.

801
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,972
I don't mean no disrespect
to you or your kids,

802
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,411
but my rent puts as much food
on your baby's table as you do.

803
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:34,575
Well, now...

804
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,409
I did not have to give your wife
those food stamps.

805
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:42,056
Vic, let's go. Forget about it.
I can't live like this no more.

806
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,210
At least you all still got
gas and hot water. Hey, Vic?

807
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,974
It's good, baby.

808
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:02,059
I like eating by candlelight.
It's kinda romantic.

809
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:06,173
- Are you wooing me?
- It wouldn't do me much good, would it?

810
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,969
- This is fun.
- Does it mean we can't watch TV?

811
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,057
That's right, no cartoons.

812
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:16,457
No Brady Bunch or Partridge Family
for Troy and Nate.

813
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,891
- Hey, nigger, I don't watch that show.
- You do so.

814
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,089
- Liar.
- Nigger.

815
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:24,576
- Stop calling each other nigger.
- You can't watch the Knicks.

816
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,738
Come on, let's just eat in peace.

817
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:32,013
Daddy's got some good news.
They've given me a solo concert.

818
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,654
Wow, great, Daddy.

819
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,853
This is the one, Gem.
It's gonna be real special.

820
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:42,574
Clinton, Wendell, Nate,

821
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:46,056
I need you all to get out
and put up some posters for Daddy.

822
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,535
- Will you do that?
- Fine with me.

823
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:55,810
Don't you worry.
I'll take care of the house, I promise.

824
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,329
- Thank you. Call if you need us.
- OK.

825
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:01,737
If you see anybody acting suspiciously
around the house,

826
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:05,330
you stand on that top step
and you sing, OK?

827
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,690
You'll scare the whole neighbourhood.

828
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:11,415
- You drive safe. OK, take care. Bye.
- Let's go!

829
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,134
No-one's gonna step on this stoop!

830
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,696
- You didn't say bye to Tony.
- Tommy LaLa can't sing a lick.

831
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,050
Why did you tell him that?

832
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:37,012
_ Roll on, roll on down the road

833
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,934
- What did you hit me for?

834
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,131
- Out that out.
- Hey, hey.

835
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,900
I'll tell Mommy.

836
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,570
_ Troy's gonna be with Cousin Viola

837
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,135
_ Nate's gonna be with Cousin Sam

838
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,218
Can't wait. Finally,
some peace and quiet.

839
01:01:55,420 --> 01:02:00,972
_... roll on,
Roll on, Citroen, roll on

840
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,217
_ Roll on down the road _

841
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,695
How many times are you
gonna sing that song?

842
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,130
- You don't like my song?
- No!

843
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,690
I'm glad the kids
are coming south. I'm tired.

844
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,175
Woody, we need to make some changes.

845
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,850
The money I bring in
is not making ends meet.

846
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,016
I need your help.

847
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:38,530
You want me to... pick up a guitar
and play some rock'n'roll?

848
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,014
Yes.

849
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,899
If it'll help pay Con Ed, yes.

850
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:50,011
This concert's gonna change
a lot of things for us.

851
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,654
Plus, it'll bring in
a nice piece of change.

852
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:57,092
Who's gonna come but us, Uncle
Brown, Aunt Maxine and our friends?

853
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,657
People are gonna come to this concert.
People still wanna hear good music.

854
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,169
I don't care how much rock'n'roll sells.

855
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,135
People know the difference
between that and pure music.

856
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:12,332
- I need you to support me in this.
- What?

857
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:14,578
Look here.

858
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,329
Who gets up at the crack of dawn,
Monday through Friday,

859
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:22,692
cooking breakfast, go to school,
teach school, come home, cook dinner,

860
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:28,054
grade papers, make lesson plans,
keep our kids from killing each other,

861
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,933
so you can be a pure musician,
playing pure music.

862
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,018
If that ain't support,
I don't know what is.

863
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,369
Thank you.

864
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:41,538
You woke up Troy. Are you satisfied?

865
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,411
What's the matter? Can't you sleep?

866
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,258
No.

867
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,736
- Want to come up here with us?
- Yeah.

868
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,173
- Oh...
- Your long legs.

869
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:03,019
Whoa, Miss Coomish Mimmish.

870
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,097
Troy, aren't you the lucky one?

871
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:09,293
Aunt Song said Viola is beside herself
that you're coming down here.

872
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,172
When am I coming home?

873
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,938
In a few weeks.

874
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,177
- Will the lights be back on?
- Oh, yeah, baby.

875
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,940
All the lights will be back on.

876
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:21,813
- I don't wanna go.
- Troy, come on, come on.

877
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:25,729
You're gonna have a wonderful time.
Please, just this once.

878
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:08,170
Lord have mercy,
would you look at this!

879
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:11,975
- I didn't think you'd ever get here.
-  I didn't either, Song.

880
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:17,538
You look tired. Lord have mercy,
you brought your dog, too!

881
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:21,972
Viola, why don't you put Queenie
in the family room?

882
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,456
- Family room?
- You sure got a clean house.

883
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:30,495
Oh, isn't that cute?
Clem, did you hear what Clinton said?

884
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,816
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm Wendell.

885
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:36,979
- I'm Clinton.
- Well, shut my mouth wide open!

886
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:42,810
Oh, Carolyn, I just love yours and
Troy's hair. Would you look at that?

887
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,773
Those tiny braids.
What do you all call that?

888
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,055
Braids.

889
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:54,459
No, sugar. We don't let the dogs
in here. This carpet's too nice.

890
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:58,209
Take that dog outside.
Put him in the car.

891
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:01,139
- Nate.
- Come on, Mutley.

892
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:05,015
Viola, ain't you gonna say hello
to your Cousin Troy?

893
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,654
Troy, are you gonna say hi?

894
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,851
- Hi.
- Hi.

895
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,494
She's just a little shy.

896
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,816
- Off the couch!
-  Got any coffee?

897
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:18,410
I don't mind, we are all family.

898
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:23,569
Who's hungry? I got fried chicken and
potato salad in the kitchen right there.

899
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,975
Wait! Come here!

900
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,370
- You have not changed.
- Come on, Troy.

901
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:36,977
- Aunt Song, you sure can cook.
- Why, thank you, sugar.

902
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,855
Lord, Troy, you don't know how happy
we are to have you here with us.

903
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:45,212
We're gonna have us some fun.
Troy can stay as long as she wants.

904
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,218
Oh, Song, that's so nice.
Troy, isn't that nice?

905
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,173
- Yeah, thank you.
- You're welcome.

906
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:56,898
We need to get on the road. We have
to drop Nate off at Trudy and Boo's.

907
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,251
Come on, finish your plates.
We got about two hours to go.

908
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:03,054
How soon are you
getting back to New York?

909
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,375
Day after tomorrow.

910
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:10,052
Will you please try and cooperate
and get along with everybody?

911
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,969
- I don't wanna stay here.
- You're gonna have a great time.

912
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:17,092
Sweetie, I wish I was staying.

913
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,256
Just don't leave me here.

914
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:24,816
- I hardly know these people.
- They're your relatives.

915
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:29,013
I'm the one to feel sorry for,
I have to go back with those boys.

916
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,176
Troy, I love you baby.

917
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,292
- Bye! See you!
-  Take care of yourself.

918
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,411
Bye, little Joe.

919
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,088
- Don't leave me.
- Let's go inside.

920
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:51,213
- Mommy, don't leave me.
- Let's go inside, baby.

921
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:57,448
When you're getting dressed for bed,

922
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:59,218
I have often heard It said,

923
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:04,540
Before you go to sleep,
You have to put away your clothes...

924
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,413
...if you do things,

925
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,975
Do things right.

926
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,934
Queenie, is mama's baby
gonna be nice to Troy?

927
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:17,257
Troy, where are your pyjamas?

928
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,054
May I be excused?

929
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:23,730
And they'll say "Yes" to you...

930
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:28,092
Lord have mercy, honey,
you can't wear these!

931
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:32,816
Viola, give Troy one of your nighties.
I'm gonna throw these in the garbage.

932
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,499
Yes, Mama.

933
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,737
Get up, wake up,
get there on time for school,

934
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,534
Don't you be late,
Find your place

935
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,617
Win the race.

936
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:46,176
- Here, Troy.
- Go change in the bathroom.

937
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,735
Sugar, you ain't got a thing to hide
with your skinny self.

938
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,579
Thinner than a blade of grass.

939
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:10,295
- Viola, you got your bra on?
- Yes.

940
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,092
Come on.

941
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:18,290
All right, you rascals. Let's say
our prayers. Put Queenie on the floor.

942
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:27,538
Now I lay me down to sleep,

943
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,937
I pray the Lord my soul to keep,

944
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:34,132
If I should die before I wake,

945
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,252
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

946
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:38,449
Amen.

947
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:42,130
All right, now.
I want you two right to sleep.

948
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:45,650
All right, sleep tight,
don't let the bed bugs bite.

949
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:48,499
So glad you're here.
We're gonna have lots of fun.

950
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,134
- Goodnight, honey.
- Goodnight, Daddy.

951
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,456
- Goodnight, Troy.
- 'Night, Uncle Clem.

952
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:56,452
Night, night.

953
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,294
I ain't no puta.
I keep my pyjamas clean.

954
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,173
I ain't no puta.
I keep my pyjamas clean.

955
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:10,498
- I keep my pyjamas clean.
- What's that noise in there?

956
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,692
Nothing! Stop jumping
on the bed before she comes in.

957
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,414
I don't care. I hate this place anyway.

958
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,180
Besides, my dog could kill
your rat dog anyway.

959
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:23,134
I don't care either.
And it ain't my dog, it's Mama's dog.

960
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,453
- You like living in Brooklyn?
- A lot better than here.

961
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:31,174
- You should visit me.
- I like Aunt Carolyn.

962
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:36,852
It's OK if you don't like Song.
She ain't my real mother, I was adopted.

963
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,778
You were?

964
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,892
What's that funny noise outside?

965
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,331
- You ain't never heard crickets before?
- Goodnight.

966
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:49,175
Lord have mercy, child,
you sure got one thick head of hair.

967
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:51,450
You need a hot comb on these.

968
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:55,699
You ain't got good hair like my baby.

969
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:00,535
Ow!

970
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:05,655
Don't tell me you've got the nerve
to be tender-headed with these naps?

971
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:09,208
What's those things
you and your mother have?

972
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:14,050
- Beads and braids.
- Beads and braids. Lord have mercy.

973
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,694
Troy's having a birthday party

974
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,130
Pizza, pizza, daddy-o

975
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,932
I hit it!

976
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,335
- Want me to go over the bump?
- No!

977
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,337
- Hold on.
- I am.

978
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,531
I'm gonna go faster.

979
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:37,459
The bump's coming'.

980
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:42,012
- Hey!
- Hi!

981
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,852
Daddy-o!

982
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:53,332
Inny, Minny, siss a linny
Oshie, koshie, Liberace, I love you

983
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,735
Take a peach, take a plum
Take a bubble-gum

984
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:58,374
No peach, no plum
Just a stick of bubble-gum

985
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:02,414
I like coffee, I like tea
I like the colored boy and he likes me

986
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,850
Step back white boy
You don't shine

987
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,096
I'll get the colored boy
to kick your behind

988
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:11,175
All, all, all In together now
How you like the weather now?

989
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,610
January, February, March, April

990
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:16,380
May, June, July, August...

991
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,969
Queenie!

992
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:21,853
[TV]... our Savior
was a kid just like you.

993
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,413
Stay there.

994
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:27,010
[TV] Sling this song nice and loud
so he can hear you up In heaven.

995
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,653
Here we go.

996
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:32,535
_ One, two, three
The Devils after me...

997
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:35,095
I like this song.

998
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,416
_... he's always throwing sticks

999
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:41,374
_ Seven, eight, nine
He misses every time

1000
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:45,812
_ Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen

1001
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:49,649
_ One, two, three
The Devils after me

1002
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,455
_ Four, five, six
He's always throwing sticks

1003
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:57,653
Come on, sing. It's real easy.

1004
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:01,614
_ Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen

1005
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:06,052
_ Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen

1006
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:09,058
_ Amen

1007
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:12,616
_ Amen _

1008
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,050
Praise the Lord!

1009
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,695
Did you all wash your hands
when you came in from playing outside?

1010
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:23,176
Viola? Girl, I am speaking to you.

1011
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:25,018
I don't have to listen to you.

1012
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:28,292
All right, Missy. Don't show off
in front of your company.

1013
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,094
I am going to speak
to your father about this.

1014
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,656
Don't let me have to go get my switch.
Jesus help me.

1015
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,250
- Clem! Clem!
- She ain't my real mother.

1016
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,769
But we know a secret, don't we?

1017
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:48,771
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yes.

1018
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,858
Don't tell me a fib.
You know it's sinful to lie.

1019
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,255
Yes, Aunt Song. I washed them.

1020
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:56,337
Good, run back to bed.

1021
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:00,328
Uncle Clem and I
have a surprise for you.

1022
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:09,531
- Come on, Clem!
- Happy birthday, Troy!

1023
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,412
Happy birthday, Troy.

1024
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:13,929
Say "Happy birthday, Troy."

1025
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:16,574
- Thank you.
- Isn't this nice?

1026
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:20,568
I'm gonna make you a birthday cake.
What kind of cake shall it be?

1027
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:23,852
- Chocolate!
- Oh, no, sugar, I can't do chocolate.

1028
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,528
Last time I did,
Viola broke out in hives.

1029
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:29,652
- No, I didn't. You did.
- Don't argue with your mother.

1030
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:32,772
You see, Clem? I say it's white,
she says it's black.

1031
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:35,619
If the girl says she didn't get hives,
she didn't.

1032
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:38,732
- I told you.
- Always taking her side.

1033
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:42,569
For Christs sake, let Troy
open up her presents, please, honey.

1034
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:44,338
Goddamn!

1035
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,537
- Ooh!
- It's a dress.

1036
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:53,369
It's from me and your uncle Clem.
Ain't that pretty?

1037
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,652
- You are going to wear that today.
- Oh, thank you.

1038
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,328
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1039
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:07,619
- It's a training bra.
- You won't need that for quite a while.

1040
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:13,456
Oh... This came in the morning mail.
It's for you.

1041
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:16,618
- It's from my Mommy.
- Oh, yeah. What'd she say?

1042
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,653
I hope she don't mind
me taking out those braids.

1043
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,498
I didn't know what else to do.

1044
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,930
Let's let her read her letter in peace.

1045
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:26,335
Come on, let's make breakfast.

1046
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,650
Viola, let's go.

1047
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:50,174
- Jade!
- Dear Ladybug, happy birthday!

1048
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,975
The mailman just tapped on the window
and I got your letter. Hooray!

1049
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:58,378
I'm glad you're having such
a wonderful time. Could this be true?

1050
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:01,890
You've been gone a month,
but It feels like an eternity.

1051
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:05,092
- Minnie asked:
- When is Troy back from down south?

1052
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:09,373
All the boys are still on the stoop
playing Strat-o-Matic baseball.

1053
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,457
What a waste of time

1054
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:13,457
And Tommy still can't sing

1055
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:15,616
_... yes to you

1056
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:17,219
_ Listen to me

1057
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:21,811
_ La, la, la, la, la means

1058
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,978
_ I love you _

1059
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:28,252
Last night,
we had yet another run-in with Tony.

1060
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:32,135
Vic didnt slap him this time,
your father was there, thank God.

1061
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:34,615
Wendell told me
that every morning,

1062
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:38,574
Tony throws trash from his yard
onto our stoop.

1063
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:42,011
Well, we finally caught him red-handed.

1064
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,533
What are you doing?

1065
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:47,573
Throwing this trash
back where it came from.

1066
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:50,089
- Why did you throw it here?
- Was it us?

1067
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:54,373
- Get into your house!
- Don't tell me. I know...

1068
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:55,933
- You're the one...
- No...

1069
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:58,017
You know how It Is.

1070
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:01,735
Before you know it,
you got a big crowd wanting a big show.

1071
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,977
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

1072
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:07,694
We caught him throwing trash over there.

1073
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,494
I expect more from a grown man.
What are you doing?

1074
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:14,090
Your children are constantly
throwing trash on my property.

1075
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:18,213
- True.
- And they throw rocks on my dogs.

1076
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,695
- Untrue.
- Machine gun! Machine gun!

1077
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,929
- Are you doing this?
- Do you believe him?

1078
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,654
You gonna believe this stinky over us?

1079
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:32,170
My children are doing no such thing.
You ought to be ashamed.

1080
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,848
Act like an adult.
Out this foolishness out.

1081
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,528
I hate to say this,
but your house stinks.

1082
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,173
That's the truth.

1083
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:41,052
Why your house stink, man?

1084
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,333
- Hey, you up there.

1085
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:50,055
Mister Number Four. Where's my rent?

1086
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:53,297
When are you going to pay my rent?

1087
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,536
Hey, Tony.

1088
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,971
If you want me to,
I'll come and help you straighten up.

1089
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:03,332
This situation's got to stop.
I can smell your animals in my house.

1090
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,451
You understand me?

1091
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,378
OK.

1092
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,415
Here.

1093
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:16,856
Aren't you glad to be away from
the crazy people In Crooklyn, New York?

1094
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,937
And now, about your father.

1095
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:21,051
It started with Clinton.

1096
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,013
You're the eldest
and I expect more from you.

1097
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:25,858
You make your own decision.

1098
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,528
Why did Daddy have to
have his concert tonight?

1099
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:31,971
The same night
of the NBA Championships! Dang!

1100
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,535
Which is more important?

1101
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:05,411
- Was that some new stuff tonight?
- Yeah, man.

1102
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:09,215
-  You ought to record it.
- I plan to.

1103
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,934
I also started working on a folk opera.

1104
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:15,052
Folk opera? About what, Woody?

1105
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:19,572
- What are you laughing at?
- Jessica, she's from the city.

1106
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:23,819
My folk opera
is about growing up in Alabama.

1107
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,580
- You got the material.
- That's right.

1108
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,499
You're right!

1109
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:33,693
We were all trying very hard
to lift your father's spirits.

1110
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,891
And it was working, until...

1111
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:43,293
The Knicks are world champs.

1112
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:48,252
We got some ice cream
and cake right here.

1113
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:51,691
- Clinton.
-  I'm not hungry.

1114
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,978
The Knicks won. How about that?

1115
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:01,172
I've enclosed some gifts
for you and Viola.

1116
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,736
Ladybug, we all miss you dreadfully.

1117
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:08,694
I miss you. Love, Mommy.

1118
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:12,336
P.S. We got the lights turned back on
thanks to Uncle Brown,

1119
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:15,418
who is buying you a plane ticket home.
Please write...

1120
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:19,056
"...and thank him immediately."

1121
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,973
Queenie!

1122
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,453
I don't know where she's run off to.

1123
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:30,413
- Here she is, the birthday girl.
- These are for you.

1124
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,929
- Thank you.
- Did your mother send those?

1125
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:36,894
- They're jade.
- Aren't they pretty!

1126
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,818
What are they? Elephants?

1127
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,375
Look, Aunt Carolyn sent me some also.

1128
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:45,209
You don't have pierced ears.
You know how I feel about that.

1129
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,536
But Troy has pierced ears.

1130
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:52,939
Troy was also wearing them funny braids
and beads and shells and things.

1131
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,971
You don't let me do what I wanna do.

1132
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:57,694
- I wanna go home.
- Beg pardon?

1133
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:01,210
- I'm going home.
- No need to get upset.

1134
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:04,651
Everybody has a little argument
now and then.

1135
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:09,138
Aunt Song didn't mean nothing about
your hair and your earrings, did you?

1136
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,376
- I don't care.
- See what you did?

1137
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,697
Lord have mercy, Troy.

1138
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,289
How would it look if you left now?

1139
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:20,094
Aunt Song has a big mouth sometimes.

1140
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:24,134
Do you want your folks to think
we done scared you back up north?

1141
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,614
If she goes, I go.

1142
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:30,416
Troy, Aunt Song
loves you and your family.

1143
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:34,135
- Clem, do something.
- Now, look, folks.

1144
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:38,333
Troy wants to go home, Troy's
going home, that's all there is to it.

1145
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:43,375
Troy, at least stay for
the birthday party I've prepared.

1146
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:44,933
- Song.
- All right.

1147
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:47,096
Fix us some breakfast.

1148
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:52,417
Queenie!

1149
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,576
Queenie!

1150
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,930
Baby, where are you?!

1151
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:00,291
- Come back in here.
- Where's my baby?!

1152
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,014
Queenie! Where are you?!

1153
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:08,378
She done lost her way, has my child.
Queenie!

1154
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,855
Queenie, where are you?

1155
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:14,018
Queenie, where are you, baby?

1156
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,052
Stop that, please!

1157
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:24,172
- Did you find her?
- I don't understand where she is.

1158
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:27,975
It's not like Queenie just to up
and disappear. Why, Lord, why?

1159
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:31,411
- She'll be back.
- Don't worry. Queenie'll show up.

1160
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,009
It's late.
You had enough ice cream and cake?

1161

Get out of here, Judy, Jody,
whatever your names are.

1167
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,732
Oh, dear God!

1168

Oh, God, take me right now!
I don't want to live without my baby.

Oh, God, Queenie!

1171
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:29,697
Looks like it's gonna rain.
That means my baby's in heaven.

Aunt Song didn't like my braids
so she took 'em out.

1192
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:17,093
Goodness, gracious. Carolyn's gonna
have a fit when she sees this, huh?

You were ready to come home? Had enough
of the south? I don't blame you.

1196
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,620
Mm-hm. It's too slow.

Well, she hasn't been
feeling too well lately.

1208
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:09,540
- What's wrong with her?
- We don't know.

1209
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:12,698
- The doctors are running tests.
- Why didn't she tell me?

1210
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,016
How come nobody told me?

1211
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:17,495
No one wanted you
to worry yourself silly.

1212
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,419
Your mother didn't think
there was cause for alarm.

1213
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:22,656
Where's Daddy?

1214
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,576

Aunt Song... Oh, shit, I knew she would.

if you missed them.

if nobody else helps me.

Yeah, they talk funny down there.

1245

01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:53,732

01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:19,294
but you have to wear something nice.

1326
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:23,175
Don't you want to look all pretty
like Aunt Maxine?

1327
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,450
Carolyn would be so proud of you.

1328
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:29,414
Listen, my mother hates polyester.

1329
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:32,851
She would never let me
wear anything like that.

1330
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,937
Right, Troy.

1331
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:37,176
[Cheerios jingle on TV]

1332
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:46,088
- _ Let yourself go _
- Get Cheerios

1333
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,250
- Troy?
- What?!

1334
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:53,372
- Let's go!
- I'm not goin'!

1335
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:56,137
Shit.

1336
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:12,012
- Troy, baby, what are you doing?
- I'm sick.

1337
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:16,008
- You got everybody waiting on you.
- So?

1338
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:35,656
Please don't make this
any more difficult than it has to be.

1339
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:38,215
I hate funerals. I'm not going.

1340
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:42,379
Troy, you're not the only one
who's in pain.

1341
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:45,491
We're all hurtin'.

1342
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:49,056
We gotta think about Mommy
and what would make Mommy happy.

1343
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:52,775
- You wanna make Mommy happy?
- No use trying right now.

1344
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:57,974
Yes, there is. Your mother
would want everybody to be...

1345
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:01,377
...at the church together.

1346
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:03,935
- Will you do that for me?
- Yeah.

1347
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:08,418
I want you to get yourself together.
I'm gonna wait for you downstairs.

1348
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:10,929
- OK?
- All right.

1349
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:15,058
I hate funerals too.

1350
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:25,290
- I'll be downstairs.
- OK.

1351
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:53,450
I'm proud of you, Troy.

1352
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,736
Hey, there, little bit.

1353
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:35,579
Want Vic to get you anything,
little sister?

1354
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:37,736
No, thanks.

1355
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:40,534
All right. OK.

1356
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:06,096
Who are these people anyway,
coming out of the woodwork?

1357
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,417
- Mommy sure had a lot of friends.
- I guess she did.

1358
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:12,009
Troy, they keep laughing
and pointing at me,

1359
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,575
saying, "His momma's dead,
his momma's dead"!

1360
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:17,010
- They took my money!
- Who?

1361
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,609
The Possoms! Right Hand and Snuffy!

1362
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:22,573
Come on, Joseph.

1363
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:24,259
There they are!

1364
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:28,533
- Who took your money?
- There! Snuffy and Right Hand Man!

1365
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:38,449
Snuffy, that's what you get.

1366
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:44,175
- Troy, what you do that for?
- Tired of being terrorised.

1367
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:46,336
Go sniff on your own block.

1368
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,571
Mother, stop it!

1369
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:00,135
Mommy, I don't like it when you fight!

1370
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:03,218
Daddy, get her to stop!
Get her to stop!

1371
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:05,775
Mommy! Daddy!

1372
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:08,778
- Mommy!
-  Damn rat!

1373
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,733
- Stop!
- No, get... Huh?

1374
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,658
Mommy?

1375
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:17,292
No, Troy...

1376
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:19,978
Mommy's... gone.

1377
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:24,256
Mommy's gone, Troy.

1378
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:28,650
Troy, you can cry.

1379
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:32,055
It's all right to cry.

1380
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:33,739
Mommy's gone.

1381
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:35,896
Are you sick?

1382
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,539
- Are you sick, baby?
- You should have told me.

1383
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:46,372
Stand up, baby.

1384
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:47,933
Here.

1385
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:54,657
Oh, baby.

1386
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:58,812
Let me wipe that.
Come here, let me wipe that.

1387
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:06,771
OK...

1388
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:12,012
Damn, Troy...

1389
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:17,577
Everybody was wondering
when you was gonna break.

1390
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:20,815
Even Clinton cried.

1391
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:25,611
Daddy, please don't make me move away.

1392
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:29,972
I know Aunt Maxine
wants me to go and live with her.

1393
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:34,049
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

1394
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:42,497
Mommy was in a lot of pain, wasn't she?

1395
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:45,891
Yes, she was.

1396
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:49,735
Then it's good she died.

1397
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:53,572
So she wouldn't have to suffer.

1398
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:59,053
That's a nice way of putting it, baby.

1399
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:02,728
Yeah, that's real nice.

1400
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:19,732
Ow! You're hurting me!

1401
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:21,771
Be quiet. It doesn't hurt.

1402
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:25,939
If you combed it more often,
it wouldn't look like a sheep's behind.

1403
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:28,529
It never hurt when Mommy combed it.

1404
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:30,810
I'm sorry, Joseph, but I'm not Mommy.

1405
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:34,217
Dear Ladybug, how are you?

1406
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:37,571
I miss you so very much.

1407
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:40,692
I can't believe you just turned ten.

1408
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:43,858
All of you kids
are growing up so rapidly.

1409
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,937
You turned out pretty good,

1410
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:48,973
considering you're raising
a house full of ashy...

1411
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:50,977
- Ow!
...rusty butt boys.

1412
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:54,217
- Can Joseph play?
- Can he come out?

1413
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:58,254
All right. Don't go too far,
cos dinner's almost ready.

1414
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:09,215
Wait for me! Wait for me!

1415
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:13,692
Joseph! Don't go too far!

1416
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:18,337
That ought to hold you
for a little while.

1417
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:22,294
We thank our guest stars,
Curtis Mayfield, The Honeycombs,

1418
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,570
and of course the Soul Train gang.

1419
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:27,772
Be right where you are
next week when we return,

1420
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:31,450
and you can bet your last money
itll be a stone gas, honey.

1421
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:34,538
I'm Don Cornelius,
and as always we wish you love,

1422
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:37,453
peace, and soul

1423
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:41,814
Here comes the pitch,
and It comes In wide.

1424
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:44,898
And the count now,
1 and 1 to Jackie Robinson...
