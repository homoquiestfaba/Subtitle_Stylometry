1
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,621
<i>So you've all heard the story, right?</i>

2
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,691
About what happens on July 4?

3
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,399
Whoa, Amber,
you want to freak everyone out?

4
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,468
No.

5
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,601
I just like hearing you tell it.

6
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,297
What are you guys talking about?

7
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,668
The Fisherman.

8
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,047
Every 4th of July,

9
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,912
he gets out his hat and slicker,

10
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,454
he sharpens up his hook,

11
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,692
and runs wild.

12
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,559
But only after teenagers.

13
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,197
That's right,
the ones with dirty little secrets.

14
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,262
What about you, Zoe?
I bet you got some dirty little secrets.

15
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,271
Yeah. I heard you suck in bed.

16
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,442
Nice.

17
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,503
July 4.

18
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,491
Hey!

19
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,289
Seriously, a guy on my ski team knows
this girl who went camping last summer,

20
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,088
and they saw the Fisherman.

21
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,224
Two days later,
two kids didn't make it out of the woods.

22
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,202
So he's kind of like Santa Claus, huh?
Only in reverse.

23
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,862
He goes after the kids that are naughty?

24
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,170
No, he's more like Jack the Ripper,
except the guy never got caught.

25
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,868
Well, I wouldn't worry.

26
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,108
Dude, it's Broken Ridge, Colorado,
in the summer.

27
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,177
Even a psycho killer knows
to avoid this place.

28
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:16,685
Yeah, the guy would probably die
of boredom before he got any of us.

29
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,218
Hey, I heard you're running
some sort of field trip in September.

30
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,030
It's a photo shoot, really.
Why, are you interested?

31
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,694
Well, I figured since stud boy's
gonna be gone to college,

32
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,497
maybe you need somebody
to carry your tripod.

33
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,596
Very funny. Are you working,
or are you just hitting on my girlfriend?

34
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,265
Depends. You want to play?

35
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,004
Whoa, what, with your balls? No, thanks.

36
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,978
Come on, baby.

37
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,471
Win me a monkey.

38
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,175
Okay.

39
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,110
But if I win, you crash at my place tonight.

40
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,485
Tell your mom you're staying at Zoe's.

41
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,090
Is that a yes or a no?

42
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,059
- First win the monkey.
- All right.

43
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,298
Oh, yeah!

44
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,765
I'll take that.

45
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,438
Happy 4th of July, babe.

46
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,279
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I know.

47
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,408
You're the lucky one.

48
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,681
You get to take off
and I have to stay here another year.

49
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,651
It's weird, me in L.A.

50
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,691
What do you mean? It's brilliant!

51
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,919
And when I get there,

52
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,998
it's going to be the most amazing place
in the world for the two of us.

53
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,365
Yuck.

54
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,436
Marine Candidate Davis, reporting for duty.

55
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,742
Yo, P. J!

56
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,613
Oh, my gosh, P.J.,
I can't believe you actually did it.

57
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,812
Well, just ROTC.

58
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,288
You could say my daddy worked me over.

59
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,054
But guess who's next, little cuz?

60
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,393
Yeah, that's right, I give it another year
and he's coming after your ass.

61
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,400
- I don't think so.
- Come on, it's in our blood.

62
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,900
And plus, chicks dig the hair.

63
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,364
Okay, true. True.

64
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,302
- Get a picture, come on.
- Yeah, okay. There.

65
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,110
Okay, get close...

66
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,554
Run! Run! Run!

67
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:42,735
Run!

68
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,972
What was that?

69
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,676
What was that?

70
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,344
It's him, it's the Fisherman!

71
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,082
What are you... No! Is your arm okay?

72
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,622
- I've never seen...
- There he is!

73
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,832
There's a killer on the loose!

74
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,932
Get out of here!

75
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,302
Run!

76
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,409
Watch out!

77
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,475
He almost got us!

78
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,480
P. J!

79
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,115
P. J! P. J!

80
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,081
Oh, my God, look!

81
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,719
Oh, my God!

82
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,854
- It's the Fisherman!
- P.J., watch out!

83
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,318
Look out!

84
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,589
- Watch out, we're coming up!
- Police.

85
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,185
- Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way! Police!

86
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,866
Somebody's got to help him!

87
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,263
- P. J!
- P.J., run!

88
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,044
No!

89
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,179
Oh, God!

90
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,687
Come on, you have to go try to help him.
We can't leave him.

91
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,816
- Where'd he go, Hafner?
- I don't know, he came up here.

92
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,264
- Oh, God, that was insane!
- I swear, he almost killed me.

93
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,433
- Sheriff Davis was on him.
- No. He got away.

94
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,834
Guys, behind you.

95
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,044
- How was I?
- Dude, you were awesome.

96
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,347
Awesome.

97
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,823
This stuff is sticky.

98
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,159
I am having a heart attack.

99
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,785
You guys said to make it real, so...

100
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,387
Yeah, you almost nailed us with that thing.

101
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,895
- 39 bucks on eBay.
- Sure it was.

102
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,596
Get this, the ad says this is the real hook,
straight from the legend.

103
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,137
Yeah, right. Okay.

104
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,307
Damn it!

105
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,333
Roger, give me the hook, man,
get undressed.

106
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,871
- How was P.J.'s move?
- It was awesome.

107
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,245
Oh, God, it was sick. Everyone saw it.

108
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:15,112
- So where is he?
- Yeah, where's P. J?

109
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,028
Who moved the mattresses?

110
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,827
What the hell are they doing there?

111
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,527
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
Right there, please.

112
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,306
Step back.

113
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,467
Clear a path, people.
Let's get this ambulance...

114
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,967
You should've double checked
the mattresses, Roger.

115
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,833
Somebody moved them.

116
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,073
- Anyway, that was P.J.'s job.
- Yeah, just pass the ball to him.

117
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,139
- This was your idea!
- What?

118
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,307
Hey!

119
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,589
Guys, we have to go to the police.

120
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,720
And tell them what? That it was a big joke?

121
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,456
- It was an accident.
- Was it?

122
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,889
What if we don't do anything?

123
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,788
The man's a genius.

124
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,690
Look, I want to go to college.

125
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,266
Everybody here
wants to get out of this hellhole.

126
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,891
And you're gonna be the next American Idol.

127
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:43,969
Screw you.

128
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,594
Look, everyone at that carnival

129
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,970
thinks that some psycho
in a raincoat did it, right?

130
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,977
- Why should they think anything different?
- We go to the police and what'll happen?

131
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,138
P.J.'s dad will try to nail us.

132
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:56,874
He never liked us to begin with,

133
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,213
and in this small-ass town,
innocent or guilty, we're dead.

134
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,678
So we tell him that we're not doing this.

135
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,693
Think about it, Zoe,
because we only get one chance at this.

136
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,759
Screw it, I'm in.

137
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,067
The guy came out of nowhere.

138
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,369
We ran for our lives just like P.J.
and everybody else.

139
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,333
Okay, but the only way we pull this off

140
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,140
is if we stick together
and we keep it a secret.

141
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,838
It dies with us.

142
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,644
You really think it's that easy?

143
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,153
Amber, telling the truth
isn't gonna bring P.J. back.

144
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,124
Everyone saw him cut you.

145
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:11,823
Okay.

146
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,550
The secret dies with us. Say it.

147
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,524
- The secret dies with us.
- Secret dies with us.

148
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,260
Amber. Say it.

149
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,742
The secret dies with us.

150
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,888
Burn it.

151
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,684
- Look who's still in town.
- Hey, Lance. Thanks.

152
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,816
Why, I figured you'd be
long gone from this place by now.

153
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,889
Nope.

154
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,618
One more boring summer at Broken Ridge
and then I'm free.

155
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,422
Oh, you're going to kick ass out there,
I know it.

156
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,495
Thanks.

157
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:41,396
And you'll probably sell a bunch
of artsy photos of your hometown,

158
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,262
get rich and famous,

159
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,067
make us look like a bunch of hillbillies
on the way up.

160
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,635
What about you?
What have you been up to?

161
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,711
Oh, you know,
working for the mountain resort.

162
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,607
Grounds crew stuff.

163
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,145
Keeps me outdoors, so I like it.

164
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,480
Saved up for a new motorcycle.
It's fast as hell.

165
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,121
- I know, sounds boring to you.
- What? No.

166
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,453
You're doing your own thing.

167
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,026
There she is!

168
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:13,792
Kelly's got this new guy that she's after.
Sorry, sorry. He is so hot!

169
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,335
- Hot like the guy from the bike shop, hot?
- You ragging on me?

170
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,495
It's hard to keep them straight, Kel.

171
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:24,008
Hey, who held your hand all year while
Mr. Perfect Boyfriend was away at college?

172
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,042
Okay, well, don't worry,
in a few weeks I'll be back with Colby

173
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,842
and you can forget all about me
and the hand-holding.

174
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,212
- What do you mean?
- Turn around.

175
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,142
SC girls are freaks.

176
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,415
'Cause, you know,
most of them are de-clawed now.

177
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,590
Colby?

178
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,634
Amber, hey, what's up?
I was just gonna call you.

179
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,770
Hi. Could you excuse us? Thanks.

180
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,109
What are you doing here?

181
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,812
- The internship thing didn't work out.
- What?

182
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,507
Yeah, don't even ask.

183
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,947
I just figured
I'd come home and work at the pool again.

184
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,042
And this is how I find out?

185
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,279
Babe, chill.

186
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:13,188
At a party? In front of all of my friends,
like a total idiot?

187
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,018
You really want to do this now?

188
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,528
It's your freshman year,
maybe you shouldn't be tied down.

189
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,003
And this all just occurred to you.

190
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,506
We both felt it. What happened last summer
changed things!

191
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,440
Colby, moving to California was my idea.

192
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,925
- Hey.
- Hi.

193
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,492
You need a ride?

194
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,297
No. I'm fine, I got my truck.

195
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,459
Amber?

196
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,295
Hey.

197
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,228
Deputy Hafner, you scared me.

198
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,760
You okay?

199
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,998
Yeah, just girl stuff.

200
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,897
Look,

201
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,435
we've known each other for years, right?

202
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,607
So really, if you ever want to talk,

203
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,847
get something off your mind, call me.

204
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,625
- Drive safe.
- Thanks.

205
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,057
See, Colby,
I knew you couldn't break up with me.

206
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,654
<i>- Give me five minutes, guys.</i>
- All right, Zoe.

207
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,763
Hey, Zoe.

208
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,802
Sorry, you look familiar, do I know you?

209
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,098
- Can you not do this now?
- Okay, when?

210
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,899
After I call you 10 more times
and send you 20 more flyers?

211
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,777
Zoe, I'm sorry, I really am.

212
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,981
I need your help.

213
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,659
Zoe, I don't know what to do.
Somebody sent me this.

214
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,927
Is that supposed to be funny?

215
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,660
Zoe, did you tell anyone?

216
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,261
Yeah, I wrote a song about it,
but don't worry, that single's not out yet.

217
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,340
Okay, could you get serious for one minute?

218
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,033
I never said anything.

219
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,042
What did Colby think?

220
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,857
- I haven't told him yet.
- What's the matter, trouble in paradise?

221
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,658
Zoe, I'm not tough like you.

222
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:44,791
Look, my parents are out of town.
I can't go to Colby's.

223
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,736
So could you just ask me
to crash here for tonight?

224
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,437
Couch is over there, bathroom's in the back.

225
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,753
He fixes ski lifts?

226
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,185
This is his summer job?

227
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,559
No wonder he hasn't called anybody.

228
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:57,901
Roger?

229
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,355
This doesn't feel right.

230
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,151
Maybe we should just
meet him in town later.

231
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,055
Jesus, Amber, chill out!

232
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,320
Okay, okay, let's go!
I don't like this place. Come on.

233
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,265
Jeez!

234
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,413
- What is this, a reunion?
- We need to talk.

235
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,050
Roger! It's important.

236
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,320
Would you shut that thing off?

237
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,163
I got 50 of these last night.

238
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,428
The number's totally blocked.

239
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,580
That's impossible. We got rid of everything.

240
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,416
- Someone knows, Roger.
- Why?

241
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,180
Which one of you opened your mouth?

242
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,587
We were gonna ask you the same thing.

243
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,253
You got the message. Not me.

244
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,537
- What about Colby?
- He's your buddy. He say anything to you?

245
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,779
Are you kidding?

246
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,111
Hasn't even talked to me once
since he went to California.

247
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,455
We gotta go to the cops.

248
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,723
We had our chance to tell the truth, Roger.

249
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:04,292
Somebody knows now.
What if this guy goes first?

250
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,230
After we lied to everyone's faces?

251
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:12,237
Having the cops chasing a killer for a year
that doesn't exist?

252
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:15,011
- Think about it.
- I have thought about it!

253
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,615
My life's jacked anyway.

254
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,777
Let me talk to Colby first.

255
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,681
And you keep your mouth shut for now.

256
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,048
Whatever.

257
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,252
No, Roger, I don't want any more surprises.

258
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:32,890
Say it!

259
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,725
We all keep our mouths shut.

260
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,596
We all keep our mouths shut.

261
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,064
What happened to us?

262
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,646
I don't want it to be like this anymore.

263
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,474
So what are you going to say next?
That you miss me?

264
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,645
Well, you could send me
one more of your flyers.

265
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,714
Yeah, right! Those cost me money.
They're like $1 a flyer.

266
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:35,848
- Really?
- Yeah.

267
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,088
- I owe you like 10 bucks.
- Try $20.

268
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,729
Now that bass player of yours,
he's pretty cute.

269
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,765
Yeah, you two. I think you two
would be pretty cute together.

270
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:47,997
- What?
- Yeah.

271
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,602
Good God.

272
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,108
- Sheriff Davis.
- Sorry.

273
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,245
I'm just making my rounds of the school.

274
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,679
It's kind of strange without all the kids.

275
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,880
Anyway, I saw your car
and thought I'd say hi.

276
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,081
Haven't seen you girls in a while.

277
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,457
I've been thinking about you.

278
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,160
You know, with the 4th coming up again.

279
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,632
It's gonna be tough this year.

280
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,336
It's gonna be tough every year.

281
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,408
Well.

282
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,672
Yeah, you take care, okay? Yeah.

283
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,617
I'm going to the snack bar.

284
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,316
This is a joke, right?

285
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,417
Amber's pissed,
you guys are just messing with me.

286
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,758
You think I care about your love life?

287
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,627
She's making this whole thing up.
She's playing both of us.

288
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,200
Or maybe you're the one that's pissed.

289
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,327
Got home late last night,
did a little drunk text messaging to the ex?

290
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,496
You're crazy.

291
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,438
No one loves a good prank
better than you, right?

292
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,174
Listen, I kept our promise.

293
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,684
I shut my mouth
and I put this shit behind me!

294
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,549
Well, someone's digging it back up for us!

295
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,591
Why, because Amber got messages
in the middle of the night and we didn't?

296
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,321
P.J.'s death was a big deal for this town.

297
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,733
I mean, say some freak did pop out
of the woodwork,

298
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,825
- it doesn't mean he actually knows anything.
- I know!

299
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,233
That's what I told Amber, but she...

300
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,101
So why are you coming down here
busting my balls?

301
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,969
In case you and I are wrong.

302
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:40,180
- I'm sorry, it's not my problem anymore.
- I always knew you were a dick.

303
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,457
I got it.

304
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,063
...my towel back.

305
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,265
That guy is hot!

306
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,547
- You okay, miss?
- Yeah.

307
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:08,616
- What happened?
- Oh, I just had a problem with my bike.

308
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,184
Well, listen, it's about to storm,
so you better get down the hill.

309
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,161
- Let me get you a lift.
- Okay.

310
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,666
I'm telling you, that's the hook.

311
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,212
If you say so.

312
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,711
What makes you think you're not next?

313
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,442
He sent you a message, too, Colby.

314
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,348
Come on, Amber, you want us to believe
you got attacked on a gondola?

315
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,945
- Fifty feet in the air?
- Oh, why am I even talking to you?

316
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,592
So who do you think is doing this, Amber?

317
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,392
Maybe somebody who was close to P.J.
is trying to punish us.

318
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,163
Roger's right.
We have to go to the cops now

319
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,996
before they get the story
from somebody else.

320
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:09,038
Roger won't even return our call.
That's how much he gives a shit.

321
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,073
- Roger's whacked.
- How whacked?

322
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,787
<i>So how was I?</i>

323
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:37,726
<i>- It was an accident.</i>
<i>- Was it?</i>

324
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,497
<i>What if we don't do anything?</i>

325
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,233
<i>We had our chance to tell the truth, Roger.</i>

326
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,510
<i>Somebody knows now.</i>

327
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,546
<i>- This was your idea!</i>
<i>- What?</i>

328
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,052
<i>After we lied to everyone's faces?</i>

329
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,618
<i>It was an accident.</i>

330
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,991
<i>It was an accident.</i>

331
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,835
<i>The secret dies with us.</i>

332
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:15,862
<i>The secret dies with us.</i>

333
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,770
<i>The secret dies with us.</i>

334
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,742
<i>The secret dies with us.</i>

335
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,799
Hello?

336
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,643
Hello?

337
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,717
Who's here?

338
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,522
Who's here?

339
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,601
Coat.

340
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,246
Oh, my God!

341
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,839
- There's blood here, too.
- He was living here.

342
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,830
Holy shit!

343
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,022
He killed himself.

344
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,310
Freeze!

345
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,180
We found him here with this.

346
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,558
He killed himself.

347
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,565
What are you all doing here?

348
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,476
- Rawlings.
- Yeah.

349
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,976
Take care of this.
Make sure you contact the boy's family.

350
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,569
I'll take care of it.

351
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:32,481
So he didn't tell you about any of it?
The fights in college, failing classes?

352
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,151
Leave of absence? Anti-depressants?

353
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,160
We didn't hear from him much this year.

354
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,124
I guess he couldn't get over
what happened last summer.

355
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:50,834
If there's anything you guys
want to add to your statements,

356
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,402
anything you think I should know...

357
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,947
No.

358
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,986
- Okay. We're done here.
- Thanks, Officer.

359
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:05,488
Call me.

360
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,126
I know that you're alone for the weekend

361
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:15,565
and

362
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,592
I don't have to worry about you, do I?

363
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:19,896
No. No.

364
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:21,871
I'm okay.

365
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,541
Don't worry. This is over.

366
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,009
You can go home.

367
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,242
I'll call you.

368
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,780
- lf I have any more questions. Yeah.
- Yeah.

369
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,614
- Rawlings.
- Yeah.

370
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,920
Get that to the Sheriff for me. Thanks.

371
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,581
I can't believe Roger was behind this.

372
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,911
I can't believe
he got the hook out of the lake.

373
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,575
This was not our fault.

374
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,048
Someone else is dead now.

375
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,519
- Yeah, and we're all safer for it.
- How do you just move on?

376
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,823
Because it's over, for good.

377
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,898
So it wasn't Roger.

378
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,799
Of course it was.

379
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,269
He's crazy, he killed himself.

380
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:03,940
Did he?

381
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,345
Because someone just did this.

382
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,107
Lance.

383
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,476
Lance!

384
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,944
Take it easy, timber boy.

385
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:46,140
Whoa, man, you almost got yourself
a free nose job there.

386
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,042
We just want to talk.

387
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,012
I don't know if you heard about last night,
but...

388
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,455
Yeah. I heard.

389
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:57,651
I'm sorry.

390
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:03,055
Tomorrow's July 4, a year since P.J.'s death.

391
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,532
It must've pushed Roger over the edge.

392
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,297
Yeah. I guess.

393
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,239
We just wanted to stop by
and see how you're doing.

394
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,243
What is this,
some kind of group therapy session?

395
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,334
Yeah, it is.

396
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:19,176
Here's a piece of advice,
nobody likes a troublemaker.

397
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,182
That's funny, coming from you.

398
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:24,144
Look, we were all P.J.'s friends.

399
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:28,821
Lance, if there's something
that you know that's bothering you,

400
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,521
just tell us.

401
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,526
Okay. How about this?

402
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,257
I never understood
why you dated such an asshole.

403
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,664
Got your notes, jackass.

404
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,828
- What are you talking about?
- Colby, just stop it.

405
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:42,768
You think we're scared? Huh?
You think we care?

406
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,104
You know what, you've got a lot of nerve
coming down here starting shit with me!

407
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:50,168
You should worry a little less about me,
and a little more about my uncle.

408
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,076
Sheriff Davis? Why?

409
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:56,776
He came down here yesterday,
asking about some secret.

410
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,459
Lucky you got a chainsaw, douche bag.

411
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:21,336
All right, Colby, do you honestly think
the town sheriff is running around

412
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,141
in a fisherman's outfit,
playing hide and creep with us?

413
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:28,149
The guy was Special Forces in the Army.
They live for this kind of shit.

414
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,180
Besides, his own son died.

415
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,052
Look, we have to do something.

416
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,919
We have to tell him
that we know he's on to us.

417
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,686
Colby, it's the Sheriff.

418
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,425
Not Lance. It's not like
we can just walk up and accuse him.

419
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,192
Kent, we got to figure out
what's going on tomorrow

420
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:50,205
because we're short a couple of guys,
everybody's calling in sick on me.

421
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,298
So if you could get on that...

422
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,398
You really want to sit back

423
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,479
and see how this psycho plans to celebrate
the anniversary of P.J.'s death?

424
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,945
We'll just have the usual.

425
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:04,651
Look, I know what I'm doing.
You're just going to have to trust me.

426
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:07,655
Yeah, I tried that before. Remember?

427
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,948
Hey, Zoe. Yeah, I'm almost done packing.
I'll be there in like 30 minutes.

428
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,356
Okay, bye.

429
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:43,940
<i>Don't jump.</i>

430
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,686
Turns out we didn't get to finish
our conversation today.

431
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,130
I'm sorry.
Things have been crazy, we didn't...

432
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,359
Come on, Amber.

433
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:42,131
This is part of your guys' game, isn't it?
It's Colby's idea, right?

434
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,871
I don't know what you're talking about.

435
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:53,972
I know what you did last summer.

436
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,252
What?

437
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,650
P.J. told me. Before it all went down.

438
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,948
It's funny, I'd never even heard
of this stupid Fisherman

439
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,855
until you guys thought
that he should come visit.

440
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,861
- Lance, it was an accident.
- But you guys just couldn't get enough.

441
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:09,397
A year later,
and the pranks just keep on coming.

442
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:15,260
- You tell Colby that if he tries anything...
- Lance. You're in trouble.

443
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,607
We didn't do this, you have to believe me.

444
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,275
So who did?

445
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:25,675
I don't know.

446
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,793
Harry?

447
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:20,964
What the hell?

448
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:14,652
- My uncle didn't do this.
- Who invited him here anyway?

449
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,351
The guy who played arts and crafts
on my bike.

450
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:21,061
- So, Lance, who do you think it was?
- I don't know.

451
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,826
A lot of people got pissed off
about last year.

452
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,498
Look, we have to go to Hafner.

453
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:33,372
He's your buddy, he said he'd help us.
He's the only one we can trust.

454
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:35,611
Okay.

455
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,576
Let's just say that it's Davis.

456
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:42,113
We rat on him
and he'll just tell everyone about last year.

457
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,776
We deny everything.

458
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:47,254
We say the guy lost his mind,
he lost his son, he's taking it out on us.

459
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,449
You're the one losing it, Colby.

460
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,685
Come on, Amber! We're the victims here.

461
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:53,125
- What's wrong with you?
- Chill out, man.

462
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,262
She's just trying to figure things out.

463
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,324
Yeah, what if we're wrong about the Sheriff?

464
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:04,234
We say we're sorry, we panicked,
we got it wrong, whatever!

465
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,571
The point is, we got to tell Hafner
so we can be protected.

466
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:11,946
You know I'm right.

467
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,377
Hey.

468
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:44,777
What's going on?

469
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:46,448
Hey.

470
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,680
You said if we ever needed to talk...

471
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:54,484
Yeah. Yeah, come on back.

472
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,488
Just having a few friends over.

473
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:09,867
- Maybe this isn't such a good time after all.
- It depends on what you want to talk about.

474
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,603
It's about P.J., isn't it?

475
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:17,743
The anniversary?

476
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,913
Hey, who wants another one?

477
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,713
- Hey, yeah.
- Yeah, I'll take one.

478
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:25,913
Uncle Paul.

479
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,523
- What'd I miss?
- Something about your son.

480
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:35,154
We've all been having some problems
the last few days.

481
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,562
- It kind of stems back to...
- Tomorrow's the 4th.

482
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:43,836
And even though the carnival's canceled,
that guy's still, you know, out there.

483
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,632
What if he decides
to go after someone else?

484
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:58,115
Everything we do
just makes this worse and worse.

485
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,323
We've got to get out of here.

486
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,125
- Tomorrow.
- What's that going to do?

487
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,198
It's going to take the big night away
from this freak.

488
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,856
Hold on, I'm not going anywhere with him.

489
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:14,835
- You better tell your boyfriend to chill out.
- Okay, you two stop it.

490
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:17,929
We're sticking together
and we're getting out of here.

491
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,202
And by the way, he's not my boyfriend.

492
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,949
Wow! He's already got driver status, huh?

493
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,153
Look what I got.

494
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,389
What are you doing with that?

495
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:12,791
I went and got it from Roger's
so we can get rid of it once and for all.

496
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,658
Chuck it in a damn volcano.

497
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,000
Where's your stuff?

498
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:24,570
I don't know how to say this.

499
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:29,111
I just found out there's going to be
some agents at the show tonight.

500
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,181
They book clubs all over the state,
maybe even L.A.

501
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:35,181
I'm sorry, I just can't miss out on this.

502
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,377
Zoe, we had a plan.

503
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:40,820
I am going to be on a stage,
in front of a crowd, with security all around.

504
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,187
- What's safer than that?
- Leaving town.

505
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,788
- You guys go without me.
- Okay, let's go.

506
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,592
No, no, no, guys.
We got to stick together here.

507
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:55,966
Fine. Then we're all going to the show.

508
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:57,767
Look, you play your song,

509
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,408
then we get in the car,
and we'll head out of there.

510
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,467
Whatever.

511
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:06,139
I'm not hanging around here all day,
I'll meet you there.

512
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:07,580
Buy me a ticket.

513
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:39,341
Here. This is how
we got the idea for that damn prank.

514
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:41,772
What is this?

515
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:44,747
Zoe put all this together.

516
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:49,224
We thought it was a big hoax,
but it turns out to be based on a real guy.

517
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,921
On the 4th of July, this guy goes crazy.

518
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,554
He kills a bunch of kids
in this little fishing town.

519
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,997
Supposedly it was some kind of revenge.

520
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:02,965
Then a year later, he goes after them again,

521
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:06,737
on some island in the Caribbean
and dies there.

522
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:09,037
- Starting his own legend.
- Yeah.

523
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:13,806
They were all stalked for a few days
before July 4.

524
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,178
Sounds familiar.

525
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:27,422
I finally graduate high school, my real life
is supposed to be starting and look at me,

526
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,863
I'm worried that I'm even going to make it
through the night.

527
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,725
I'll be here with you.

528
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:36,405
Yeah.

529
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,931
You always have been.

530
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,079
Oh, aren't you two

531
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:23,543
cute.

532
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:25,411
Glad you could make it.

533
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,451
- Zoe goes on soon.
- Yeah, I can't fricking wait.

534
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:31,583
- You're drunk.
- No, I'm self-medicated.

535
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,594
- You want some?
- No, thank you.

536
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:37,964
So, Lancey Pants, where's your uncle
who's not trying to kill us?

537
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,261
He's working.

538
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:43,129
- Okay, let's move it along.
- The night's still young, right?

539
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,532
Yeah. Let's just go in.

540
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:03,585
This sucks!

541
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,887
I'm going to get another cocktail.

542
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:08,519
Colby.

543
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,165
Colby don't...

544
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:11,961
I'll be back in a second.

545
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,108
Show time!

546
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,415
- Try not to die out there.
- Let's roll. Come on, let's go.

547
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,251
<i>Okay, people, next up,</i>

548
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:12,953
<i>let's get ready to rock and roll</i>
<i>with Zoe and the Hooks!</i>

549
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:51,395
- She's good.
- No. She's awesome!

550
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:03,639
Your uncle's right there.

551
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:15,455
Yeah, I found it, man.
Thanks for the hook up, dude.

552
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:17,823
All right, later.

553
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,688
All right.

554
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:29,988
Babe, you rocked up there.

555
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:32,333
That was incredible.

556
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,762
An agent from L.A. asked for my info.

557
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,236
- That's awesome!
- I know!

558
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,636
So can we go now?

559
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:39,774
All right.

560
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:43,504
Would you chill? Nothing's going to happen
in the next two minutes.

561
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:53,221
Ready?

562
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,551
Come on! Come on!

563
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,268
Where is he?

564
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:41,160
We got to find a way out of here.

565
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,469
Where the hell are we?

566
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:56,079
- Where's Zoe?
- I don't know.

567
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,115
Where the hell is she?

568
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:06,393
Amber? Lance?

569
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,300
Come on, please!

570
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,569
Come on, please!

571
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,402
Amber!

572
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:02,183
Oh, God.

573
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:04,678
No, don't.

574
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:11,154
No!

575
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,907
Zoe!

576
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:38,452
I know, I know. We got to get help.
Come on.

577
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,667
Hafner, we got a problem. You copy?

578
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:56,465
<i>- Yeah, go ahead.</i>
- I got a dead girl at the back of the lodge.

579
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:58,437
- Call for backup.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

580
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,411
Come out of there!

581
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,448
Uncle Paul, please, you don't understand.

582
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,616
- Looks pretty clear.
- He's trying to kill us.

583
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:22,160
Who's trying to kill you? Where is he?

584
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,309
- Yo!
<i>- Colby, where are you?</i>

585
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,611
I'm having some vodka.

586
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:49,280
- Feeling pretty good.
<i>- He's here.</i>

587
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,053
- Who's here?
<i>- The Fisherman.</i>

588
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:56,188
- You mean Sheriff Davis?
- No. No, he's dead, and so is Zoe.

589
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:58,332
He's after all of us.

590
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,334
<i>Get the hell out of the lodge.</i>

591
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,364
That might be a problem.

592
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:06,566
<i>Colby, Colby where are you?</i>

593
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,108
I'm in the kitchen.

594
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,478
<i>Okay, don't move, we're coming!</i>

595
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:39,699
Colby.

596
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:41,736
Are you okay?

597
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:32,716
<i>Hey, you've reached Colby, leave a message.</i>

598
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,624
Look! The door.

599
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:41,469
Colby?

600
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:14,869
Amber.

601
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,399
We got to get out of here.

602
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:31,216
Oh, thank God.

603
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:36,954
John! You have to help us.

604
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,391
Why're you covered in blood?

605
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:42,694
You... You don't understand.

606
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,026
There's something you don't know.

607
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:49,660
- It's about what happened last year.
- I know.

608
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,633
I know what you did last summer.

609
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,411
Roger told me. Last week.

610
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,812
He was freaking out!
He wanted to confess everything!

611
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:05,353
I told him it was too late,
he should just keep his mouth shut.

612
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,853
I had no idea how far he'd take that.

613
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,015
You knew?

614
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:16,091
And you kept it a secret?

615
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,062
I did it for you, Amber.

616
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:27,403
But everything's different now, isn't it?
I searched your car.

617
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,170
I found a box with a hook!

618
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,609
- No...
- Now get in the truck!

619
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:40,977
No.

620
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:46,828
Oh, God.

621
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:50,624
Get back.

622
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:51,926
It's you!

623
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,603
- Look, I don't know how this happened.
- It's you.

624
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:02,635
Oh, my God.

625
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:10,910
All right, asshole, on the ground.
Hands on your head.

626
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,781
Put your hands up or you're a dead man.

627
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:14,981
Put them up!

628
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:53,561
Go!

629
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:05,272
Stay down, asshole.

630
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,209
There's no way!

631
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,180
- Go, go! Come on!
- Come on!

632
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:21,255
Come on!

633
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:25,989
Go, go! We got to go! Come on! Come on!

634
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:30,357
Do it!

635
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:31,733
Come on!

636
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,863
No, no!

637
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,137
Where'd he go?

638
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:46,271
He's gone.

639
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,813
What was that black shit
coming out of his arm?

640
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,111
I don't know.

641
01:19:56,725 --> 01:20:00,627
It's the guy from 10 years ago
who killed all those kids.

642
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,655
- Amber, that was not a guy.
- It's the legend.

643
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,524
- It's become true.
- I can't believe this.

644
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,195
P.J. died, we kept it a secret.

645
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:10,737
But we can hurt him.

646
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:15,603
- This hurt him.
- Come on, we've got to turn ourselves in!

647
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:18,645
Think about it, Lance.
No one is going to believe us!

648
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:21,548
I'm going after him.

649
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:28,447
Amber. Wait.

650
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:32,048
Come on.

651
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:38,898
Where are we going?

652
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:43,296
- I know this one is open.
- Hurry up, I think he's coming.

653
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,434
Go, go, go, go, go!

654
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,168
Oh, shit. Hurry, here he comes.

655
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:52,171
- This way?
- No! This way.

656
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,444
This way.

657
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:03,647
- Okay, come on.
- Okay.

658
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:05,248
Wait.

659
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:11,933
Okay.

660
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:18,129
- Put the hook right there. Right there.
- Yeah.

661
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,140
Right there. Okay.

662
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:21,570
Come over here.

663
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:26,607
Almost there.

664
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,010
Don't move it until I tell you.

665
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:39,624
Okay, you ready?

666
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:49,501
Lance, over there!

667
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:52,400
No, up there.

668
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:57,745
Now!

669
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:32,204
He's gone.

670
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:02,468
Amber, Amber.
We got to keep going, we can't stay here.

671
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:05,237
Come on, come on. Let's go.

672
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:32,064
No!

673
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,066
Lance, no!

674
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:53,884
The secret dies with you.

675
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:44,972
You sure you can't ID this guy?

676
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,574
I couldn't really see his face.

677
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:51,577
But he's not from around here.

678
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:56,850
Just some crazy guy who wanted more
of what he got last summer.

679
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:03,189
He won't bother anybody again.

680
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:07,595
Yeah.

681
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:10,355
It's over.

682
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,420
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Miss me yet?

683
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:38,822
<i>Hey! Where you at?</i>

684
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:41,054
Nevada. Near the state line.

685
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:43,562
I should be back in L.A. in four hours.

686
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:49,059
We are finally going to be off
the long distance plan.

687
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:53,504
<i>- What was that?</i>
- I don't know.

688
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:56,072
I think I just blew a tire.

689
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:10,321
<i>Amber, you okay?</i>

690
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:13,418
Yeah, it's a flat tire.

691
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:19,363
I don't know what could have done that.

01:27:20,668 --> 01:27:22,932
<i>Somebody around there to help you out?</i>

693
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:28,138
No, there's nobody out here.

694
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:30,174
<i>You got a spare?</i>

695
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:32,473
Lance? Are you there?

696
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:34,742
Lance, hello?
