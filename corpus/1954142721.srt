WASHINGTON SQUARE

00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:12,061
Subtitle: sync, fix: titler

3
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,420
Hurry up! Hey, wait!
Wait for me!

4
00:01:57,228 --> 00:01:59,262
Hurry!

5
00:02:49,823 --> 00:02:52,859
No!
Aah!

6
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:40,147
Your daughter, sir.

7
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,050
You'll be with our
son in heaven.

8
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:42,488
Good afternoon.
Good day to you, Doctor.

9
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,524
Father's home!
Father's home!

10
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:47,293
Catherine, quietly, please.
Father!

11
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:50,998
Father!
Catherine.

12
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:59,275
I see your instruction of behavior befitting
a young lady goes on, business as usual.

13
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:02,311
Oh, please don't be angry
with aunt Lavinia, father.

14
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:05,382
She tried to stop me,
but my heart beat my breast...

15
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:07,551
with such a voluptuous swell.

16
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:10,455
To have a daughter with
such highbrow taste...

17
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:14,158
in dress and literature,
and at such a young age, well.

18
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,462
And it is you I have to thank,
dear sister.

19
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:18,263
Come, father.
Yes, yes.

20
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:34,049
Here you go.

21
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:46,530
Oh, father, I'm so sorry.

22
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:49,634
It was a raspberry. On the continent,
people put... we're in New York.

23
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:51,703
And in New York,
port is unadorned.

24
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:56,175
Is it too much to ask that there be one
thing not overdone in this household?

25
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:58,444
Surprise!

26
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:01,615
Happy birthday, Dr. Austin.
Surprise.

27
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:08,222
Excuse me, I...

28
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:11,660
My wine went... went down
the wrong way.

29
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,562
Come along, dear.
That should be lovely.

30
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:19,202
Now don't be nervous. We've
rehearsed this a thousand times.

31
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,239
Shh, please.
Sit down.

32
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:24,275
Sweetheart?

33
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:39,982
# There...

34
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:43,810
# There...

35
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:46,835
Now come on.

36
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:55,612
# There...

37
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,700
Oh, Austin. Sit down.
Come with me.

38
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:15,602
Shh!
Shh!

39
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:19,740
Maureen! Maureen, there's been
an accident. Do something.

40
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:23,245
Alice, would you like to
recite something for us?

41
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:30,786
Do you want your cake?

42
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,672
Good night, Catherine.
Good night.

43
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,416
Good bird.
Good bird.

44
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:15,973
Ah, good afternoon, Doctor.
Good afternoon.

45
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:18,777
Father's home!
Father's home!

46
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,745
Catherine, unlike
the fourth of july,

47
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:23,749
the occasion of your father coming
home is an everyday occurrence.

48
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:28,655
Please do not jangle my nerves
so arbitrarily. Catherine!

49
00:08:28,657 --> 00:08:30,691
Catherine!

50
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:34,762
Good afternoon, Dr. Sloper.

51
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,831
Good afternoon, father.

52
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:41,770
Did you forget the party
at aunt Eizabeth's?

53
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,507
My dear child, the world
was created in six days.

54
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:48,945
Surely we mortals can prepare
for a gathering in three hours.

55
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,324
Father, there is so much to do.

56
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:09,703
Please, I beg you,
allow me to attend myself.

57
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:12,774
I fear what will happen if I keep you
from your preparations a moment longer.

58
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:19,749
Catherine!

59
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:45,813
How long could it take for one
woman to minister to herself?

60
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:49,050
Now, Austin, choosing one's
first evening gown alone...

61
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:51,486
is a great event for a young girl.

62
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:54,690
Please... be gentle.

63
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:58,628
If a prelude is necessary,
it must be bad indeed.

64
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,647
So this magnificent
creature is my child.

65
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:17,718
I'll go change. You've taken
up enough time already.

66
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,021
Come along.

67
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:39,008
Yah!
Yah!

68
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:53,526
Good day, Mrs. Thornbred.
Good day.

69
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,566
Oh, it's uncle Austin.
Uncle Austin.

70
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:03,138
Uncle Austin!
Uncle Austin!

71
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,006
Lavinia.
Oh.

72
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:08,944
Oh, Eizabeth.
Hello, aunt Lavinia.

73
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:10,946
What a haven of peace
and tranquility.

74
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:13,950
Oh, dear brother, that's a
sure sign of getting old.

75
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:17,888
It does seem that the young get
more raucous as we get older.

76
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,924
It's delightful.

77
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:24,763
Anything short of his own chair in his
front room seems violent to Austin.

78
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:28,434
Lavinia has not cottoned onto
the fact that she's a sheep.

79
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:34,674
Lovely, dear. Oh, I don't think
father approves.

80
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:36,844
Well, don't let that trouble
you unduly, my dear.

81
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:39,914
If there's one thing I've learned of
my brother after all these years,

82
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,752
it's that he's generally
not the approving sort.

83
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:47,056
Come. Marian is
eager to see you.

84
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:49,826
# There they are there
they are there they are #

85
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:56,500
Oh, see how she beams?

86
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:59,838
They must be very much in love.
Dear child, he's a stockbroker.

87
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,739
He'll make a fine husband.

88
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:03,876
That is all marrying requires.

89
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:07,179
I oftentimes think
it's easier to be basic.

90
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:10,917
One's needs are so simple.
A polka!

91
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,654
Why do they do that to me?
Marian, Catherine's here.

92
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:16,190
Catherine.
A new dress?

93
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:21,597
One must take care of other's
needs before one's own.

94
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,832
Can you imagine anything
more disagreeable?

95
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:26,269
Congratulations, my dear.
May I?

96
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:36,147
If I wanted to be a pioneer, I'd settle
in Minnesota. Isn't she pretty?

97
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:38,650
I think it's beastly we can't dance.
I know.

98
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:40,820
So we'll buy a new house
every three or four years.

99
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:44,023
We'll keep moving up. Is it true
it's all the rage in Paris?

100
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:48,195
- Morris. Morris. - What is it you
want me to do now Marian?

101
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:50,130
You must take Catherine
outside to dance.

102
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:53,935
If your wife-to-be is this demanding
of me, dear cousin, can you imagine...

103
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:55,937
Oh, yes, I can.

104
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:58,807
Someone has to demand of you. It may
help to build some long-awaited character.

105
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:01,944
You see what you've done?
You've made poor miss...

106
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:06,391
Miss...

107
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:08,744
Miss...

108
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,660
Answer him, please.

109
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:17,863
He's conceited enough to believe
he has made you speechless.

110
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:21,734
This is Catherine Sloper, Marian's cousin.
This is Morris Townsend.

111
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:28,809
Shall we?
Come.

112
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:05,195
One, two, three, four, five, six.

113
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,388
One, two, three, four, five, six.

114
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,928
If I can have your attention up here,
I promise you I'll take care of down there.

115
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:18,701
Oh, forgive me. I've been off the dance
floor for far too long, it seems.

116
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:22,039
Here. Let's try this
dangerous sport.

117
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:27,779
Here.

118
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:32,118
Please sit down.
Oh.

119
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,022
I'll get some refreshments, shall I?
Oh.

120
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,844
Oh, gracious.

121
00:14:58,215 --> 00:15:01,052
- My dear, what are you doing,
hiding in the bushes? - No...

122
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:04,022
You must come out where the young
men can see you... no, no, no.

123
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:11,898
Oh, my.

124
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,469
I do... I don't believe we've been
introduced. Morris Townsend.

125
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:19,339
Cousin to Arthur. I begged
Miss Sloper to take pity on me.

126
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:22,877
I'm afraid, as a dancer,
I make a very good horseman.

127
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,282
Well, Mr. Townsend, I came
looking for my niece...

128
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:29,785
because there were several young
men searching for her frantically.

129
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:33,824
She's been ignoring her
dance card shamelessly.

130
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:37,361
However, if she's promised
to keep you company,

131
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:39,931
I'll try to keep them
at bay a little longer.

132
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,238
Now, I've met the most
charming women here tonight,

133
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:46,142
but they all come from the
same family. It's remarkable.

134
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,343
I'm going to pretend I didn't
find you, Catherine.

135
00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:54,048
But you must not monopolize her,
Mr. Townsend. Oh, no.

136
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:59,321
Well, I see our time is limited.
I must make the most of it.

137
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:02,858
I don't want to earn the
enmity of every man here.

138
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,329
Please don't mock me,
Mr. Townsend.

139
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:08,331
I've offended you.

140
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,801
No.
No, I...

141
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:14,505
Mr. Robbins.
He's...

142
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,142
He's...

143
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:21,147
Do you see?
And, uh, Mr. Almond.

144
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,352
He's... he's my...

145
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:29,823
He's my uncle.

146
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:35,530
A woman without guile.
What a rarity.

147
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:39,101
Guile? Me?
No.

148
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:42,905
I mean, a woman of such uncommon
grace has... has no need of guile.

149
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:47,577
Please don't banish me.

150
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,815
You see, I've been away
for a very long time.

151
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:54,019
And if you leave me, I... I'll be
forced to make my own way...

152
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:58,423
in... in this strange and I'm
quite sure dangerous world.

153
00:17:00,294 --> 00:17:02,829
I knew I hadn't been mistaken.

154
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:07,000
You are indeed gracious...
far beyond what I deserve, I'm sure.

155
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:09,937
You are so beautiful, I...

156
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:13,942
Oh, thank you.

157
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:16,111
Oh, allow me.

158
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:20,516
Miss Sloper.
Miss...

159
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:28,192
- Who's that young foreigner talking
to Catherine? - That's no foreigner.

160
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:30,928
But you're right in
thinking him one.

161
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,233
- He looks quite brilliant.
- He's Arthur's cousin, Austin.

162
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:37,936
Several times removed, of course.
Of course.

163
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:40,306
You see, there are Townsends,
and then there are Townsends.

164
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:44,111
The young branches, elder branches,
of course. inferior branches?

165
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:46,280
Well, that's the way it is
with all royal lines.

166
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,249
Arthur.
Excuse me.

167
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:50,919
Your mother wants
to see us both.

168
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:53,989
Austin, you must choose your
opponents with more discretion.

169
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,992
Uh, go find Alice, girls.

170
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:58,961
Otherwise, there's no
sport to slaughter.

171
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:15,281
Thank you.

172
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:17,384
Good-bye, my dear.

173
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:21,254
Miss Sloper,

174
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:23,691
you dropped this.

175
00:18:56,497 --> 00:18:59,533
That charming young man
was uncommonly tender,

176
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:01,569
Lavinia, whenever you conversed.

177
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:04,439
He had such a devoted air.

178
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:07,109
My dear brother,
the devotion was not to me.

179
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:09,712
It was of Catherine he spoke.

180
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:13,550
So he's in love with this regal
creature, then? Oh, father!

181
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:17,455
He didn't say that.
But he admired her dress.

182
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:21,993
It must be love, or he thinks
she has 80,000 a year.

183
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:26,231
I don't believe he thinks
of that. He's too refined.

184
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:29,469
He must be tremendously refined.
Yes.

185
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:32,739
Yes, he... yes.

186
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:52,195
Miss Sloper...

187
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:54,231
Oh!
I'm sorry. I'm...

188
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:59,737
I'm so sorry.
Your music.

189
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:07,047
My... my clumsiness in your
presence is becoming legendary.

190
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,818
Ex... excuse me.

191
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:15,689
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

192
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:19,194
Yeah, I was... I was just
so happy to see you again.

193
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:21,363
And I... I'm sorry.

194
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:24,233
You know, I don't
always know how to...

195
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:26,469
Please accept my apologies.

196
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:28,471
Mr. Townsend...
Oh!

197
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:30,441
Sorry.

198
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:32,543
Oh, my!

199
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:54,302
You're so blessed to have
a talent for music.

200
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,338
Oh, I have no talent.

201
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,542
Just, um, appreciation.
Yearning.

202
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:03,313
Oh, can it be that I
have found a twin?

203
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:06,282
You... you see, music is such
an intense love of mine...

204
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:10,387
that my weakness in the execution
of it is the cause of great pain...

205
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:13,492
And, at times,
greater embarrassment.

206
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:17,162
Y... you see, I refuse to accept that
i am so untalented at something...

207
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:19,332
that touches me so deeply,

208
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:21,567
I... I simply believe
that I've not yet...

209
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:24,771
discovered the key that
will unlock the gift.

210
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:26,807
I know.
Really?

211
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:31,412
Yes. That...
that's the exact thing.

212
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:35,451
Every night I include a mention
of it in my prayers.

213
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:37,887
I thought that I was alone.

214
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:39,855
Oh.

215
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:42,726
Do you suppose it's
possible that we could...

216
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:48,566
I... I live with my sister and... and her
five children while I seek employment.

217
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,868
And our situation doesn't allow...

218
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,239
for such frivolity as
musical instruments.

219
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:57,677
But do you suppose that it would
ever be possible that we could...

220
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:02,917
You are brave.
I am not, so much.

221
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,887
I so want to find favor
with you. Please...

222
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:10,892
Please... please don't believe that I am
so much a fool as I appear with you.

223
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:14,363
I can't seem...
I can't seem to...

224
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:16,399
Here's another.

225
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,604
Good day.

226
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,907
Mr. Townsend?

227
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,913
We would be pleased to extend
the use of our piano.

228
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,761
Is tomorrow too soon...

229
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:45,299
for our Sloper-Townsend
music society to commence?

230
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:47,736
No. Not...
Not too soon. Yes.

231
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:45,837
Your aunt is leaving.

232
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,809
You'll have to excuse me,
Mr. Townsend.

233
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:51,911
I have the most
fortuitous headache.

234
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:53,914
Of course.

235
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,949
Excuse me.

236
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:58,553
Aunt?
Hmm?

237
00:23:58,555 --> 00:24:02,023
I can hardly be an audience to
you and Mr. Townsend forever.

238
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,695
I've neglected my duties
shamelessly these past weeks.

239
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:09,700
Besides, most young ladies crave
time alone with their beaux.

240
00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:11,702
He is not my beau.

241
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:14,706
Mr. Townsend's interest
is in the piano.

242
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,709
Accomplished as Mr. Townsend
may be in many areas,

243
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:19,711
he's no Frederic Chopin.

244
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:22,948
And even Mr. chopin would be
hard-pressed to travel...

245
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,653
five times a week for four weeks
across town in an omnibus...

246
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:29,689
to practice on an instrument
so in need of tuning.

247
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:33,127
Besides, I have the young
man's confidence.

248
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:35,096
He's come a-courting.

249
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,633
Take Mr. Byron's advice:

250
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:40,736
"Be warm, but pure.

251
00:24:40,738 --> 00:24:43,039
Be amorous, but be chaste. "

252
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,108
No, no!
Go. Go.

253
00:24:57,923 --> 00:25:00,926
Are you afraid to be
alone with me? Hmm?

254
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:04,464
Mm, mm, no.

255
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:08,635
Just does not seem quite proper.

256
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:12,840
Is proper so important to you?

257
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:21,551
Is a stroll in the park proper?

258
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:24,721
Will that make you happy?

259
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,630
You know,
I ask for nothing more.

260
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,698
Eh, we... you do.

261
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,211
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good afternoon.

262
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,214
How do you do?

263
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:51,820
Afternoon.
Lovely day, Doctor.

264
00:25:58,495 --> 00:26:00,864
They're rather humble, I'm afraid.

265
00:26:00,866 --> 00:26:02,899
No, they're lovely.

266
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:06,170
Oh, but they pale in
comparison to you.

267
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:18,017
Maureen said you wanted
to see me, Austin?

268
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,990
Would you care for some port?
Oh, my.

269
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:42,779
There.

270
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:46,885
This is my favorite time of day,

271
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:48,921
watching the sun go down...

272
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:53,592
as the city winds to a close,
so peaceful and quiet.

273
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:55,562
It quite lulls one...

274
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,965
into a sense of restful
tranquility.

275
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:04,005
Absolutely false, as it happens,
because darkness is falling,

276
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:07,709
and my daughter is running wild
in a public park with a man;

277
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,980
A virtual stranger to me, but
by all appearances not to her.

278
00:27:10,982 --> 00:27:13,917
Oh, Austin... are your duties
too numerous, Lavinia?

279
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,820
Let us take their number,
shall we?

280
00:27:16,822 --> 00:27:21,125
Well, there's, uh,
chaperoning Catherine.

281
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:24,229
And there's, uh...

282
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:26,264
We-well, that's it.

283
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:30,202
Should I perhaps hire
you an assistant?

284
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:32,906
I... I wouldn't want
to take advantage...

285
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:35,842
of our familial bond
by overworking you.

286
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:45,888
Oh, father, isn't that
a beautiful day?

287
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:51,928
Perhaps it's time I made the
acquaintance of your young man.

288
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,930
Yes!

289
00:27:57,002 --> 00:28:01,907
So in short, I would say that if a gondola
doesn't come equipped with a gondolier,

290
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:05,043
walking is a very good plan,
unless, of course, you like to swim.

291
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:10,283
Oh, Morris, Morris, tell...
tell Dr. Sloper...

292
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:14,529
about the time in Switzerland when you
took it into your head to scale the Alps.

293
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:18,411
I'm sure the telling would
benefit from a good cigar and,

294
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:21,426
uh, some excellent port wine.
What do you think, Mr. Townsend?

295
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,300
Oh, I... I think a story can't help but
be improved by such accoutrements.

296
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:28,372
Since you both know the story, it can't be
that much of an inconvenience. shall we?

297
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,874
Yes, of course.
Excuse me.

298
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:46,993
Aunt.
No, no.

299
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:56,004
I'm sure you have any number of delightful
stories that women are enthralled with.

300
00:28:56,006 --> 00:29:00,042
Now it is you who are being kind.

301
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:02,412
There.
Thank you.

302
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:05,348
I hear you're looking
for a position.

303
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,819
What are you fit for?
Not very much, I'm afraid.

304
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:12,457
I have only a good right arm,
as they say in melodramas.

305
00:29:12,868 --> 00:29:14,725
You are far too modest.

306
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:19,646
In addition to your good right arm, you have
your subtle brain and amazing physiognomy.

307
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:23,370
Well, I don't know how to answer in
the face of such generous observation.

308
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:26,039
You advise me, then,
not to despair?

309
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:29,077
I should be sorry to admit
that any robust,

310
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:31,979
well-disposed young man
need ever despair.

311
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:37,486
Were you kindly intending to propose
something to my advantage?

312
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:41,024
It occurs to me I sometimes hear
of positions outside of New York.

313
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:44,127
Mm. I'm afraid I couldn't
manage that.

314
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:46,430
You see, I'm... I'm my sister's
only living relative.

315
00:29:46,432 --> 00:29:50,902
She's a widow, and I'm providing
an education for her five children.

316
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:54,906
I am sure you must be a great
comfort to her in the circumstances.

317
00:29:54,908 --> 00:29:59,178
As, uh, honorable as that is,
it is hardly a career.

318
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,982
Mm. It will not make my fortune,
if that's what you mean.

319
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,284
Are you bent on
making a fortune?

320
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:08,356
On the contrary, I'm simply
looking to turn an honest penny.

321
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:10,492
I shall keep that in mind.

322
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:14,930
If my situation becomes desperate, I shall
perhaps take the liberty of reminding you.

323
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:17,968
Be assured, I will not
lose sight of you.

324
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:21,138
Now, I'm... I'm quite in the mood
of an alpine adventure.

325
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:26,077
And leave out none of the details
that I'm sure you did for the ladies.

326
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:35,088
What can they be talking about,
all this time?

327
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:42,062
I feel one of my headaches
coming on.

328
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:45,901
If you wish to retire,
I will make your excuses.

329
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:48,336
Oh.
Did it go well?

330
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:55,812
He's an extraordinary man,
your father.

331
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,815
He's the type of man
I would wish to be.

332
00:30:57,817 --> 00:31:01,318
I knew you two would get along.

333
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,088
And what if we hadn't?

334
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,927
I should like you to tell me that
it wouldn't have mattered.

335
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:12,131
But of course it would have mattered.
It would have mattered greatly.

336
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:17,070
You would not have welcomed the
opportunity to contradict him.

337
00:31:18,907 --> 00:31:20,942
I never contradict him.

338
00:31:20,944 --> 00:31:24,046
You would hear me abused without
opening your lips in my defense?

339
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:29,017
My father would not abuse you.
He does not know you well enough.

340
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:35,359
I'd like us to play for your
father, Catherine. No.

341
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:39,463
Don't you know yet that
together we have sanctuary?

342
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,468
Come. Come.

343
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:47,573
It's all right.

344
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:27,062
Bravo.

345
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,474
He that will not apply new
remedies must expect new evils.

346
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,755
Would you go?

347
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:31,872
Catherine, I'm...

348
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:35,142
Forgive me, I'm trembling
like a schoolboy.

349
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:41,816
I never imagined I'd
be taken like this.

350
00:35:43,153 --> 00:35:45,888
I must... I must confess
I acquired a certain...

351
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,459
veneer during my travels.

352
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:51,794
But, um, I'd heard tales
of this... this thing,

353
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:54,598
but I suspected it was an idea...

354
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,301
originated by mercenary novelists.

355
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:01,506
You know, I find myself...

356
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:05,745
I find myself performing
the most useless tasks...

357
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:09,749
in the hope that I'll find a moment's
respite from thinking of you.

358
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,957
I... I'm quite overcome.

359
00:36:45,926 --> 00:36:48,428
Oh, miss, miss.

360
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,831
Let me help you.

361
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:07,251
Oh, you must be more careful, dear.

362
00:37:08,886 --> 00:37:11,623
On this most happy of occasions,

363
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:15,326
I would like to congratulate my
daughter and my son-in-law.

364
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:20,032
- My greatest hope for you both is that
your years together... - Madam? Sir?

365
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:22,936
- Thank you. - Will be as
happy and as bountiful...

366
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:24,938
as your mother's
and mine have been.

367
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,975
Well said. Wonderful.
Absolutely wonderful.

368
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:35,550
I'll do my best for her.

369
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,725
Thank you very much.

370
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,402
Three cheers. Love and prosperity.
To the couple.

371
00:37:50,404 --> 00:37:52,971
Hear, Hear.

372
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:56,008
Austin, don't you think
he's charming?

373
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,978
So you too believe that he's
paying attention to my daughter...

374
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,581
for her uncommon beauty and wit.

375
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:04,651
Would this be an inopportune
time to remind you...

376
00:38:04,653 --> 00:38:08,056
was very well endowed monetarily
when you had occasion to marry her?

377
00:38:08,058 --> 00:38:11,960
- You're certainly not suggesting,
are you... - I suggest nothing.

378
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:14,897
For you nor Mr. Townsend.

379
00:38:14,899 --> 00:38:17,534
I merely state facts.

380
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:20,470
He's altogether too familiar,
too self-assured. He's...

381
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:24,008
ravishing, possessed of a rapier
wit and a velvet charm.

382
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,111
While you, dear Austin...

383
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:33,051
Now, if you are really intent on
gathering inside information,

384
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:36,055
Mrs. Montgomery,
the much-mentioned sister.

385
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,393
Catherine, do you want
to play with us?

386
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:41,428
Yes, yes, come along!

387
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:46,034
Catherine, wait. Martha,
I'd like you to meet Catherine.

388
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:49,605
My dear Catherine,
I am so pleased to meet you.

389
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:52,408
Morris has told me so
much about you. Martha...

390
00:38:54,411 --> 00:38:56,413
I am Catherine.

391
00:38:56,415 --> 00:38:59,649
I have heard much about you too.

392
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:02,053
May I present Alice Almond,
my cousin?

393
00:39:02,055 --> 00:39:04,522
How do you do?

394
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:08,594
Oh, Catherine, look. We're missing the ring.
Come. Will you excuse us?

395
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:15,034
- I'm...
- Thank you, Martha.

396
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,473
Yes.

397
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:23,044
Oh, that's a large piece.
Watch the glass.

398
00:39:23,046 --> 00:39:25,080
Well, i'm a broker, not a waiter.

399
00:39:25,082 --> 00:39:27,082
Oh, here, here. I'm sorry,
I... thank you.

400
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:28,985
I hope there's enough.

401
00:39:28,987 --> 00:39:31,187
For Alice.
Okay, Alice.

402
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:35,726
Here we go. Who's going
to find the ring?

403
00:39:35,728 --> 00:39:39,564
- Anyone? - Yours is on
the brink of proposing!

404
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:42,734
Keep looking.
I met this...

405
00:39:42,736 --> 00:39:44,970
Who's next?
Thank you.

406
00:39:44,972 --> 00:39:48,040
Caroline.
Caroline.

407
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:51,945
Oh! It's Catherine, is it?

408
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:08,164
Introduce me.

409
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:17,107
May I present my brother,
Dr. Sloper?

410
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:20,111
Oh, my brother...

411
00:40:22,882 --> 00:40:24,951
Miss Penniman,
y... your handkerchief.

412
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:28,956
Beware the ides of march. We must
meet and plan. Danger is at hand.

413
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,688
Here you are.
Where did that come from?

414
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,724
The cake. You caught
the ring in the cake?

415
00:40:59,993 --> 00:41:03,096
Well, I hope that's a good omen.

416
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:07,801
Your father is investigating me.

417
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:15,710
He doesn't trust me, I'm afraid.

418
00:41:15,712 --> 00:41:18,614
I don't see how you could know.

419
00:41:18,616 --> 00:41:20,883
I feel it.

420
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:22,919
I'm very quick to feel.

421
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,758
Morris.

422
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,628
When my mother and my
brother were taken,

423
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,664
I became father's life.

424
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:36,669
He must feel...

425
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:40,774
certain that he has done
his duty towards me.

426
00:41:40,776 --> 00:41:44,978
If I were being pursued by the pope,
he would investigate him too.

427
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:50,051
If you were being pursued by the pope,
he should indeed have cause for dismay.

428
00:41:58,128 --> 00:42:00,697
It's my size.

429
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,256
- I love you.
- I love you.

430
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,843
How charming.

431
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:14,981
You've, uh, traveled extensively,
Mrs. Montgomery?

432
00:42:14,983 --> 00:42:17,216
Oh, my brother.

433
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:20,187
He's collected something from
everywhere he's ever been for me.

434
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:23,090
Are you close to him?
Oh, yes.

435
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:25,360
We were orphaned from an
early age and reared each other.

436
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,664
What sort of gentleman
is your brother?

437
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:32,301
Excuse me.

438
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:34,336
Thank you, Therese.

439
00:42:38,376 --> 00:42:41,379
It's difficult to talk
about one's brother.

440
00:42:41,381 --> 00:42:44,749
It seems to me it is not when
one has good things to say.

441
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:49,121
Oh, yes, even then, when such
a great deal depends upon it.

442
00:42:49,123 --> 00:42:51,858
And for your brother,
a great deal does depend on it.

443
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,128
I meant for Miss Sloper.

444
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,698
Please sit down.
Oh, thank you.

445
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:09,145
- What does he tell you?
- That he is in love.

446
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:13,884
You can't be that obtuse. It's my
belief your brother lives off you.

447
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:18,121
Now he means to live off my poor Catherine,
and she's too simpleminded to see it.

448
00:43:21,193 --> 00:43:25,264
If that is truly what you believe,
then your path is a simple one:

449
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:27,933
Don't let her marry him.

450
00:43:27,935 --> 00:43:30,370
You have daughters?
Yes.

451
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:34,708
When young men come a-courting, you will
be concerned with their moral character.

452
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,044
Catherine is ill-equipped
to look after herself.

453
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:41,182
I can't stand by and see her
make so great a mistake.

454
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:46,188
If I'd throw him back on you, the least
I can do is help with the burden.

455
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,791
I shall take the liberty
of placing in your hands...

456
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,127
an amount for your
brother's support.

457
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,164
No wonder you have such a
great concern about money.

458
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:57,201
You believe it can buy anything.

459
00:43:57,203 --> 00:43:58,903
Mama!

460
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:01,072
You'll forgive me for telling you:

461
00:44:01,074 --> 00:44:05,144
It's easy to say when one has not
experienced purchasing power.

462
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:09,049
People talk greatly about it:
Plain, stupid girl...

463
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:11,051
with a large fortune...

464
00:44:11,053 --> 00:44:13,954
marrying a handsome,
worldly man without a penny.

465
00:44:13,956 --> 00:44:17,024
Don't they, Doctor?
Imagine the indignity.

466
00:44:17,026 --> 00:44:20,896
Why, people might even think
that you had been taken for a fool.

467
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:24,066
It's more than a man in your
position should ever have to bear.

468
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:28,338
You do me a grave injustice.
Do I?

469
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:33,010
Time will tell the truth of it.
Excuse me.

470
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:23,937
Mr. Townsend, I hope you
weren't waiting too long.

471
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:26,507
You can only approximate
how long these things take.

472
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:30,077
Oh, no. It's a wonderful thing
to have a profession.

473
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,583
Ah, but it's not only a thing one has.
It's a thing one must apply daily.

474
00:45:34,585 --> 00:45:38,287
Yes, but there is tremendous
satisfaction in that application.

475
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:42,593
As much as in scaling an alp
or riding in a gondola?

476
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:45,362
Well, I'm sure I wouldn't know,
never having had a profession.

477
00:45:45,364 --> 00:45:47,631
So we're at an impasse,
as they say,

478
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:52,637
For I've never scaled an alp for being
occupied with applying my profession.

479
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:55,908
I wish to marry your daughter, Sir.

480
00:45:59,614 --> 00:46:03,183
She is simply one of
the most delightful...

481
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:06,354
and charming individuals
I've ever encountered.

482
00:46:06,356 --> 00:46:09,290
Mr. Townsend, you must be
very susceptible.

483
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:12,928
As Catherine's father,
I have, I trust, a just...

484
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:16,666
and tender appreciation
of her many good qualities.

485
00:46:16,668 --> 00:46:20,570
But I don't mind telling you, I've never
thought of her as delightful or charming...

486
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:24,275
and never expected
anyone else to either.

487
00:46:24,277 --> 00:46:28,079
Well, I'm sure I don't know what I'd
think of Catherine if I were her father.

488
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:32,318
I can't put myself in that place.
I speak from my own point of view.

489
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,353
And you speak very well.

490
00:46:34,355 --> 00:46:37,925
Keep talking, sir, for I feel sure you'll
be telling me next of her beauty and wit.

491
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:40,327
Dr. Sloper, I don't pretend to know...

492
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:44,132
what alchemy is at work here,

493
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:48,637
but the fact is, I've never been
happier than these ten weeks.

494
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,674
To introduce magic to a man of science
in the course of a dialogue...

495
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:56,313
signals that common ground
has long departed.

496
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:59,482
Well, then... then let me speak
a language you will understand.

497
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:04,055
I've lived long enough to learn
certain truths about myself.

498
00:47:04,057 --> 00:47:07,426
One is that my vanity
requires an audience.

499
00:47:07,428 --> 00:47:10,018
Now, this is not the
most attractive of traits,

500
00:47:10,312 --> 00:47:12,576
and women are quick
to acknowledge this.

501
00:47:12,611 --> 00:47:14,033
Not so, Catherine.

502
00:47:14,035 --> 00:47:18,172
I tire myself before she tires of me,
which is saying a great deal.

503
00:47:18,174 --> 00:47:22,243
What you see, and my stories,

504
00:47:22,245 --> 00:47:25,447
are all I bring to this union.

505
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:28,617
And she makes me feel like
the most important being...

506
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:31,087
ever to roam the planet.

507
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:34,558
Do you know what it's like to be the most
important person in the world to someone?

508
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,482
Perhaps you do.
Perhaps that is...

509
00:47:36,715 --> 00:47:38,836
Perhaps that is what brings
us to this to this place.

510
00:47:38,871 --> 00:47:41,299
Catherine is so good...

511
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:45,170
and honest and... and true.

512
00:47:45,172 --> 00:47:50,143
She... she lives in a place where
everything is shining and clean...

513
00:47:50,145 --> 00:47:52,746
and where everyone has
the best of intentions.

514
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:55,449
I never imagined such a world.

515
00:47:55,451 --> 00:47:59,220
And now I want to
live there with her.

516
00:47:59,222 --> 00:48:02,257
You are a remarkable individual.

517
00:48:05,528 --> 00:48:09,665
As a dinner companion, as a storyteller,
as a man of the world...

518
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:14,638
and, in fact, as a superior human being,
I take off my hat to you.

519
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,143
But the absence of
employment, means,

520
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,346
a profession,
any visible prospects...

521
00:48:21,348 --> 00:48:24,083
place you in a category from
which it would be imprudent...

522
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:27,286
for me to choose a husband
for my daughter.

523
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:32,292
But... but it's not
for you to choose.

524
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:35,430
It's for Catherine to, and she has
chosen me. You've spent a life idling.

525
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:38,767
Now you've decided it's time
you found a position...

526
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:41,881
A position in the parlor
of 21 Washington Square

527
00:48:42,156 --> 00:48:44,165
as the husband of a
weak-minded woman.

528
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,675
You see, you need not be
concerned with my eyesight.

529
00:48:45,677 --> 00:48:48,311
But that is not what Catherine sees.

530
00:48:48,313 --> 00:48:50,181
I have 26 years...

531
00:48:50,183 --> 00:48:54,485
and the deep well of her respect
and admiration to draw from.

532
00:48:54,487 --> 00:48:56,555
I'll supply her with a
pair of spectacles.

533
00:48:56,557 --> 00:49:00,425
Well, do not forget that I, too,
draw from that same well.

534
00:49:00,427 --> 00:49:04,330
This is too amusing.
You mean to defy me.

535
00:49:04,332 --> 00:49:07,765
A man who spends his life...
you call it idling;

536
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:10,386
I call it searching...
seeks something.

537
00:49:10,421 --> 00:49:12,540
For me, it was happiness.

538
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:16,711
By having gone to the ends of the earth
in pursuit of it, what do you suppose...

539
00:49:16,713 --> 00:49:20,416
are the chances of giving it up,
having discovered it on his doorstep?

540
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:23,487
Please excuse me.
I am late for lunch.

541
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:44,548
Would you just go away?
Oh!

542
00:50:54,528 --> 00:50:57,998
Come on, ma'am.
You've had your look.

543
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:05,754
Hmm.

544
00:51:09,279 --> 00:51:12,514
Come on, Digs!
No time for tail waggin'!

545
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:14,918
Easy, boy!

546
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:21,025
We'll go through this way.

547
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:33,039
You may disrobe now.
Oh, Mr. Townsend.

548
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:36,543
I refuse to carry on a conversation
with that... contraption.

549
00:51:36,545 --> 00:51:38,979
I have my reputation to think of.

550
00:51:38,981 --> 00:51:43,852
Then why choose an establishment
that fairly reeks of licentiousness?

551
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:49,358
I'd heard it was reliable for things
clandestine. Do you have anything for me?

552
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,996
He will never change. To do
so would be to surrender.

553
00:51:52,998 --> 00:51:57,368
I know his hard, intellectual nature.
He's impervious to pity.

554
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,937
He will be vanquished only
by the established fact.

555
00:51:59,939 --> 00:52:02,841
Well, it's a fact that I want
to marry his daughter.

556
00:52:02,843 --> 00:52:06,412
I presented it to him, and he didn't
seem in the least vanquished.

557
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,949
Marry Catherine first.
Meet him afterward.

558
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:14,088
You mean I should carry her off?
Elope?

559
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,925
Well, don't you see?
He thinks you like the money.

560
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:20,562
If you marry her, knowing
that she'll be disinherited,

561
00:52:20,564 --> 00:52:25,101
he has no choice but to see
that you're honorable.

562
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:28,705
Would you really wish the life
of a pauper on your niece?

563
00:52:28,707 --> 00:52:31,075
She has 10,000 a year
from her mother.

564
00:52:31,077 --> 00:52:33,377
She's used to more.

565
00:52:33,379 --> 00:52:38,116
You know, my husband, the good reverend,
once married a young couple...

566
00:52:38,118 --> 00:52:41,120
in the same distress.

567
00:52:41,122 --> 00:52:44,857
the father was reconciled afterward.
everything worked out beautifully.

568
00:52:44,859 --> 00:52:49,663
Well, unfortunately, we do not have reverend
Penniman to marry us. No, but you have me.

569
00:52:49,665 --> 00:52:55,370
I can't perform the ceremony,
of course, but I can be in attendance.

570
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:59,141
We must use a subterranean chapel
with little lighting so...

571
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:01,744
Is this what you called
me here to ask me?

572
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:07,650
I thought you might wish to see
someone close to Catherine...

573
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:10,154
To send her word, a message...

574
00:53:10,156 --> 00:53:13,657
a lock of hair.

575
00:53:15,128 --> 00:53:19,030
She knows my heart.
As I do.

576
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:23,035
I know it to be good
and constant and true.

577
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:27,775
You cannot know this, but I went to
great personal peril to come here.

578
00:53:30,446 --> 00:53:32,309
Austin threatened to

579
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:35,731
throw me to the elements and
worse if I continued to help you.

580
00:53:35,766 --> 00:53:40,122
However, I cannot sit by...
and see you in distress.

581
00:53:40,124 --> 00:53:43,460
My nature demands that if
I can be of assistance...

582
00:53:43,462 --> 00:53:46,496
in matters of the heart, I must be.

583
00:53:46,498 --> 00:53:49,434
I'm thinking only of you, Morris.

584
00:53:49,436 --> 00:53:53,205
I racked my brains trying to
think of ways to help you.

585
00:53:53,207 --> 00:53:56,141
I pay the penalty
with my headaches.

586
00:53:56,143 --> 00:53:59,579
My perfect circulate of pain.

587
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:03,851
But I carry it as a Queen
carries her crown.

588
00:54:03,853 --> 00:54:08,522
What are they doing in there?

589
00:54:08,524 --> 00:54:11,660
You know, I have no idea.

590
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:14,129
Oh, my goodness!

591
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,523
Ah, sweets.

592
00:54:36,525 --> 00:54:38,492
Pretty thing.
Pretty...

593
00:54:38,494 --> 00:54:40,560
Catherine!

594
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:29,218
Yes?

595
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:40,031
Father...

596
00:55:43,169 --> 00:55:47,105
You told me if I had anything
to say about Mr. Townsend...

597
00:55:47,107 --> 00:55:50,977
you would be available
to listen.

598
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:53,279
I wish to see him.

599
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:57,251
- To bid him good-bye.
- He's not going anywhere.

600
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,799
Would you like to make
your father very happy?

601
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:15,707
If I can. You can and you will.
It depends on your will.

602
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:18,142
Is it to give him up?

603
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:26,151
You are happier than I. I have
no doubt you're unhappy now.

604
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:29,397
But it's better to be
unhappy for three months

605
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,368
and get over it than
be unhappy forever.

606
00:56:32,403 --> 00:56:37,164
But the only thing that would make me
unhappy forever would be to be without him.

607
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:42,871
You suppose I know nothing of men?
Their vices and falsities?

608
00:56:42,873 --> 00:56:45,141
He's not vicious.
He's not false.

609
00:56:45,143 --> 00:56:47,810
You make nothing of
my judgment, then!

610
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:53,117
I... I can't believe it. I don't ask
you to believe it. Take it on trust.

611
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:57,288
But... we can wait a long time.

612
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,391
Of course.

613
00:57:01,828 --> 00:57:04,163
You can wait until I die.

614
00:57:04,165 --> 00:57:09,236
Your engagement will have
one delightful effect on you.

615
00:57:09,238 --> 00:57:12,140
It will make you extremely
impatient for that event.

616
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:15,276
If I do not marry before your
death i will not have to.

617
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:18,313
There's one thing you can tell
him if you see him again.

618
00:57:18,315 --> 00:57:22,018
Tell him if you marry without my consent,
you'll not get a farthing of my money.

619
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,289
Well, I... I, uh... not, in that case,
to have a farthing of it.

620
00:57:30,062 --> 00:57:34,933
You are an ungrateful, cruel child.

621
00:57:34,935 --> 00:57:39,305
If you see him again, you'll have given
your father the greatest pain of his life.

622
00:57:46,247 --> 00:57:48,282
No!

623
00:58:39,944 --> 00:58:43,247
Oh! I'm to take it to Mr. Townsend
and wait for an answer.

624
00:58:43,249 --> 00:58:45,450
Oh. Yeah, I'll take it for you.
Oh, n...

625
00:58:55,263 --> 00:58:58,799
Miss Sloper made me swear not
to give it to anyone but himself.

626
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:03,271
She did not include me in
that number. Give it here.

627
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:07,910
Are you questioning
my trustworthiness?

628
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:09,945
I...

629
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:16,419
I... I will just go ask the
young Miss if it's all right.

630
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:19,390
You'll just get my bonnet.

631
00:59:19,392 --> 00:59:21,458
Thank you.

632
01:00:00,906 --> 01:00:03,275
Have you called me here
to look at me?

633
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:15,289
As gratifying as that is,
after three weeks...

634
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:20,328
three weeks of silence, I am in
need of hearing your voice.

635
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:24,100
I did want to look at you.

636
01:00:36,015 --> 01:00:39,550
My father has asked me
to go away with him...

637
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:45,392
to Europe for six months,
and I have agreed. Huh.

638
01:00:45,394 --> 01:00:49,296
So, it's done.

639
01:00:49,298 --> 01:00:52,333
You've given me up for him.

640
01:00:52,335 --> 01:00:57,339
- No, Morris. No. Let me explain...
- Ex-explain what?

641
01:00:57,341 --> 01:01:01,978
That I am... an undesirable
match because I am poor.

642
01:01:04,448 --> 01:01:08,719
Or that he believes that
I am a mercenary.

643
01:01:10,989 --> 01:01:14,492
He told me to tell you...

644
01:01:14,494 --> 01:01:18,664
that if I marry you without his consent,
I shall not inherit a penny of his fortune.

645
01:01:20,702 --> 01:01:24,171
Please tell him that I don't
give a damn for his message,

646
01:01:24,173 --> 01:01:28,141
and that I don't want
nor need his money.

647
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:32,246
- Marry me.
- Without his consent?

648
01:01:32,248 --> 01:01:37,052
Catherine...
you can't please us both.

649
01:01:37,054 --> 01:01:39,388
You have to choose.

650
01:01:40,324 --> 01:01:42,592
I have.

651
01:01:42,594 --> 01:01:44,661
I have chosen you.

652
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:51,002
He is taking me to Europe
to test our devotion.

653
01:01:51,004 --> 01:01:54,406
No. No, he's taking you to Europe
so that you'll forget me.

654
01:01:54,408 --> 01:01:56,475
No.

655
01:02:00,347 --> 01:02:03,417
People think terrible things, Morris.

656
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,390
They don't know what
is between us.

657
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:13,329
They see you,
and then they see me and...

658
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,799
father doesn't understand.

659
01:02:22,507 --> 01:02:26,177
I don't understand.

660
01:02:29,481 --> 01:02:32,651
Forgive me, but I cannot...

661
01:02:32,653 --> 01:02:36,456
I cannot forsake him so.

662
01:02:44,299 --> 01:02:46,435
Please... please...

663
01:02:47,603 --> 01:02:49,671
Wait for me.

664
01:02:51,274 --> 01:02:54,377
Please, wait...

665
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:56,345
For me, Morris.

666
01:03:11,273 --> 01:03:14,187
I'll wait for you.

667
01:03:23,378 --> 01:03:25,581
Buy your wedding gown in Paris.

668
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:31,754
Some-something beautiful.

669
01:03:31,756 --> 01:03:34,891
Something beautiful
that's worthy of you.

670
01:03:49,276 --> 01:03:53,447
Father!
Father!

671
01:03:53,449 --> 01:03:57,784
- Father!
- Mademoiselle!

672
01:04:01,372 --> 01:04:02,586
Voil!

673
01:04:20,713 --> 01:04:24,316
Un, deux, trois.

674
01:05:34,701 --> 01:05:38,471
- Catherine, we ought to p...
- Agnes.

675
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:46,046
Pack.

676
01:05:46,048 --> 01:05:48,683
We're leaving for Geneva.

677
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:58,661
Agnes... help me get out of this.

678
01:06:04,435 --> 01:06:07,905
"Whom it... "
Oh, no, no, no, no.

679
01:06:07,907 --> 01:06:10,042
Oh, this I... this is preposterous.

680
01:06:10,044 --> 01:06:14,813
He's gone to far.
He write... eh...

681
01:06:14,815 --> 01:06:17,383
He writes they are to spend
another six months.

682
01:06:17,385 --> 01:06:19,552
Another six months?

683
01:06:20,521 --> 01:06:23,457
Oh.
What does that mean?

684
01:06:23,459 --> 01:06:25,826
Well, it could be
one of two things.

685
01:06:25,828 --> 01:06:28,363
Well, no, uh, three.

686
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:30,565
We... no!
I've just thought of another.

687
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:35,504
Lavinia. No, it must be that she's
persuaded him over to you,

688
01:06:35,506 --> 01:06:39,109
and they're both so happy they've
decided not to break the journey.

689
01:06:39,111 --> 01:06:43,448
Or, or he promised that if she remain
faithful for yet another six months,

690
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:46,617
it must be love and he
will give his blessing.

691
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:51,790
Or, or, or in exchange for his consent,
she's given him another six months.

692
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:56,730
It would, after all, be the last
time he has her company so freely.

693
01:06:56,732 --> 01:07:02,436
Or? Or... she has refused
to give you up,

694
01:07:02,438 --> 01:07:05,507
and he's holding her hostage...

695
01:07:05,509 --> 01:07:08,477
in some non-english speaking,
densely populated nation...

696
01:07:08,479 --> 01:07:12,382
which civilization has yet to reach...
until she sees reason.

697
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:21,158
Oh. Now, there.

698
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,162
There, there.
Don't despair.

699
01:07:24,164 --> 01:07:26,998
Cook has prepared your favorite.

700
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,034
Lamb cassoulet.

701
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:32,138
With the new potatoes?

702
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:34,474
Of course.

703
01:07:34,476 --> 01:07:39,480
By now, we know not to serve a meal
without your favorite potatoes.

704
01:07:44,187 --> 01:07:47,089
Hup! Hup! Hup!

705
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,833
Father?

706
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,208
Father?

707
01:09:10,121 --> 01:09:14,893
Should you like to be left in
such a place as this to starve?

708
01:09:14,895 --> 01:09:18,163
That'll be your fate.
That's how he'll leave you.

709
01:09:18,165 --> 01:09:21,767
No, that's not true, father.
You shouldn't say it.

710
01:09:21,769 --> 01:09:24,237
What were you thinking of
when I came upon you?

711
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:29,844
You were glowing. You were
thinking of him, were you not?

712
01:09:29,846 --> 01:09:34,883
The story of his alpine adventure.
That one over there, I imagine.

713
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:38,028
His young, beautiful
torso dangling in midair,

714
01:09:38,169 --> 01:09:40,664
with only a rope between
him and mortality.

715
01:09:40,892 --> 01:09:44,294
Well, we're all young and
beautiful once. It's transient.

716
01:09:44,296 --> 01:09:47,231
What will you have when that's gone?
That's his only talent.

717
01:09:47,233 --> 01:09:52,555
That, and hoodwinking dimwitted
young ladies out of their inheritances.

718
01:09:53,574 --> 01:09:59,145
I love him, and when we go home
I shall marry him.

719
01:10:01,716 --> 01:10:04,351
He should be very thankful to me.

720
01:10:04,353 --> 01:10:07,922
A year ago you were rustic, limited.

721
01:10:07,924 --> 01:10:12,227
Now your value is twice as great with
the knowledge and taste you've acquired.

722
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:16,131
We have fattened the sheep
for him before he kills it.

723
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:20,303
How obscene...

724
01:10:20,305 --> 01:10:22,638
That your mother
should give her life,

725
01:10:22,959 --> 01:10:26,292
so you could inhabit
space on this earth.

726
01:10:49,105 --> 01:10:52,241
Oh, young man, where is the boat for
mercy? It's already docked, ma'am.

727
01:10:52,243 --> 01:10:54,410
Right there.
Mm? Oh, thank you.

728
01:10:58,282 --> 01:11:02,687
Thank you, officer. Oh, will the,
uh, luggage come ashore today?

729
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:05,156
Yes, sir. Catherine!
Thank you.

730
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:09,061
Oh, my! You look so glorious.

731
01:11:09,063 --> 01:11:13,366
Oh... he wanted to allow you
rest after your journey. Oh!

732
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:17,270
Europe must've agreed with you, Austin.
You look almost civil.

733
01:11:17,272 --> 01:11:20,274
I'll go and attend to the luggage.
Maureen, you're not married yet?

734
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,410
Oh, Doctor!

735
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:25,447
He-he wanted to come meet you.
But I convinced him...

736
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:28,417
Austin would think him
presumptuous.

737
01:11:28,419 --> 01:11:31,421
Besides, he had pressing
business at his office...

738
01:11:31,423 --> 01:11:33,890
that required his
immediate attention.

739
01:11:33,892 --> 01:11:38,162
Oh! It was to be a surprise,
but he gave me leave to tell you.

740
01:11:38,164 --> 01:11:43,168
Isn't wonderful? Your father
can find no fault now.

741
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,704
And he's not a subordinate, either.

742
01:11:45,706 --> 01:11:50,376
He's a partner with business
cards and everything.

743
01:11:50,378 --> 01:11:54,047
I've seen a great deal of him.

744
01:11:54,049 --> 01:11:57,351
Well, he isn't easy to know.

745
01:11:57,353 --> 01:12:00,988
I suppose you think you
know him, but you do not.

746
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:03,158
Well, not as I do.

747
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,095
You will know him after you've
lived with him for a while.

748
01:12:06,097 --> 01:12:09,265
I have lived with him,
and I may say, he's full of...

749
01:12:09,267 --> 01:12:12,135
Oh, he's just full of remarkable
charm and energy;

750
01:12:12,137 --> 01:12:14,472
full of passion, and-and...

751
01:12:14,474 --> 01:12:17,808
What is it?

752
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:20,979
He-he wrote me of your kindness.
I... I thank you for it.

753
01:12:20,981 --> 01:12:24,317
Did you fail to bring
your father around?

754
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,221
The purpose of my journey was not
to bring father around, as you say,

755
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:31,391
but rather, to spend some time
with him before I left his house.

756
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:34,461
It is done. You are the same? You-you
have not swerved the line?

757
01:12:34,463 --> 01:12:39,801
I am the same, only more so. I am home
to marry. Without your father's consent?

758
01:12:39,803 --> 01:12:43,339
With or without it.
It makes no difference.

759
01:12:43,341 --> 01:12:46,443
You have become brave. Perhaps it
does make a difference to Morris.

760
01:12:49,047 --> 01:12:51,816
Why are you so contradictory?

761
01:12:51,818 --> 01:12:57,356
A - a year ago you wished me not
to worry about displeasing father.

762
01:12:57,358 --> 01:13:01,927
No, I thank you for your care of Morris,
but, um, I am home now...

763
01:13:01,929 --> 01:13:04,030
...to marry.

764
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:10,237
Come, let's go. You know how
father dislikes dillydallying.

765
01:13:36,937 --> 01:13:39,471
Catherine, I adore you.

766
01:13:50,619 --> 01:13:53,322
I have been missed.

767
01:13:53,324 --> 01:13:55,924
You will marry me tomorrow.

768
01:14:05,337 --> 01:14:07,438
Tomorrow?

769
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,541
Next week, then.

770
01:14:09,543 --> 01:14:13,078
To make me wait longer may
well jeopardize your virtue.

771
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:26,628
You are shameful.

772
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:30,498
To-to remove a man from the object
of his desire for a day is brutal.

773
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:36,068
To do so for a year carries a penalty
so high, one should not incur it.

774
01:14:46,485 --> 01:14:48,420
Oh, Morris.

775
01:14:48,422 --> 01:14:51,523
Mm? I'll marry you
anytime you say.

776
01:14:54,428 --> 01:14:56,496
Huh?

777
01:14:56,498 --> 01:14:59,366
Uh, good afternoon, Dr. Sloper.
Uh... oh.

778
01:15:01,036 --> 01:15:04,205
Someone in the parlor?
Uh, Miss Catherine...

779
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:07,042
and Mr. Townsend, sir.

780
01:15:18,323 --> 01:15:21,526
Oh, how is your father, Catherine?
My father does not...

781
01:15:21,528 --> 01:15:24,062
figure anywhere in this equation.

782
01:15:24,064 --> 01:15:26,532
He-he's unchanged?
Yes.

783
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:32,138
Oh, my poor, dear girl.

784
01:15:36,077 --> 01:15:38,279
I don't mind it now.

785
01:15:42,752 --> 01:15:47,022
You must let me try him.
No, Morris.

786
01:15:47,024 --> 01:15:49,469
He'll not be brought 'round.
You will only make him worse.

787
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:52,731
N... you say that only because
I managed so badly the last time.

788
01:15:52,766 --> 01:15:55,499
Yet, I've had, I've had a year
to think about it now.

789
01:15:55,501 --> 01:15:57,601
I have new tact.

790
01:15:59,338 --> 01:16:02,540
Is that what you've been
thinking about for a year?

791
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:05,344
The idea sticks in my craw.

792
01:16:05,346 --> 01:16:08,114
I... I... I don't like to fail.

793
01:16:08,116 --> 01:16:10,317
Well, how have you
failed if we marry?

794
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:13,086
No-not on the main issue,
of course, but on the rest of it...

795
01:16:13,088 --> 01:16:16,624
my reputation, my relations
with your father,

796
01:16:16,626 --> 01:16:19,360
um, my relation with our children...

797
01:16:19,362 --> 01:16:25,267
Oh... we shall have enough for our
children... enough for everything.

798
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:30,473
Hmm. Besides, I believe you will
succeed brilliantly in business.

799
01:16:30,475 --> 01:16:35,479
Mm, it isn't of the material
comfort that I speak.

800
01:16:35,481 --> 01:16:38,183
It's of moral comfort;

801
01:16:39,152 --> 01:16:42,287
of the intellectual satisfaction.

802
01:16:45,459 --> 01:16:47,827
I have great moral comfort now.

803
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:50,431
Yes, of course you have.

804
01:16:50,433 --> 01:16:53,834
Y - you have it with me
is different. I...

805
01:16:53,836 --> 01:16:57,138
I stake my pride on proving to
your father that he's wrong.

806
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:01,510
And... and now that I am
the head of a business,

807
01:17:01,512 --> 01:17:04,213
I can deal with him as an equal.

808
01:17:04,215 --> 01:17:07,417
Please, Catherine. Please...
please, let me go at him.

809
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:09,419
No, Morris.

810
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:13,257
No.

811
01:17:13,259 --> 01:17:15,259
I have good reason.

812
01:17:18,298 --> 01:17:20,399
What is it?

813
01:17:25,406 --> 01:17:27,441
What is it?

814
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,583
My father despises me.

815
01:17:34,585 --> 01:17:37,819
Catherine, tha... that isn't true.

816
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:40,423
Do not do that.

817
01:17:40,425 --> 01:17:45,863
It is a great... thing to be
separated from your father.

818
01:17:47,332 --> 01:17:49,367
Especially when...

819
01:17:52,371 --> 01:17:54,405
But it is done.

820
01:17:54,407 --> 01:17:56,509
Take it on faith.

821
01:17:56,511 --> 01:17:58,577
It...

822
01:18:00,882 --> 01:18:03,416
We must never
speak of it again.

823
01:18:14,364 --> 01:18:16,465
Oh, heaven's sakes, don't bounce.
Arthur!

824
01:18:16,467 --> 01:18:19,169
May I help there, please?
Go. Take a walk in the park.

825
01:18:19,171 --> 01:18:21,604
Both of you look as if you haven't
seen the light of day for some time!

826
01:18:21,606 --> 01:18:24,575
No, we haven't. She's so fretful.
Perhaps I should stay.

827
01:18:24,577 --> 01:18:27,511
Do be careful, please. Be careful
to support her head! Mama!

828
01:18:27,513 --> 01:18:31,483
I raised eight children. I think
I can be trusted for an hour.

829
01:18:31,485 --> 01:18:34,520
One more minute and
I will withdraw my offer...

830
01:18:34,522 --> 01:18:37,223
Away with you, now!
To care for Elizabeth.

831
01:18:37,225 --> 01:18:39,593
Marian, your hat.
We're going.

832
01:18:40,662 --> 01:18:42,763
Bye, now.

833
01:18:42,765 --> 01:18:45,600
Thank you.
You're welcome.

834
01:18:45,602 --> 01:18:48,570
Marian.

835
01:18:48,572 --> 01:18:51,607
The young. No one knows
more than they do.

836
01:18:51,609 --> 01:18:54,543
Especially not their parents.

837
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,848
How is dear Catherine?

838
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:02,220
As stubborn as a mule
and twice as stupid.

839
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,792
Tried everything, but she
remains stuck like glue.

840
01:19:06,794 --> 01:19:09,728
She gained nothing from
our european trip,

841
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:13,399
except a year older.

842
01:19:13,401 --> 01:19:17,638
I can barely sit in my own parlor anymore.
His essence permeates it.

843
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,190
I can find no refuge from
Morris Townsend in my own home,

844
01:19:21,316 --> 01:19:23,272
and I have Lavinia
to thank for that.

845
01:19:23,307 --> 01:19:26,514
She is not a woman
to be left alone.

846
01:19:26,516 --> 01:19:29,452
She has to have entertainment.
He was available.

847
01:19:29,454 --> 01:19:34,458
All the better. With Lavinia in the boat,
you may be assured it'll sink.

848
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,460
Healthy baby.

849
01:19:36,462 --> 01:19:40,798
Lavinia has a capital way of
destroying all she sets out to help.

850
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,602
I believe she fantasizes...

851
01:19:44,604 --> 01:19:49,375
that the attention of that abounding
male energy in the front room is for her.

852
01:19:49,377 --> 01:19:53,546
Well, let's assume for a moment
that your theory is correct...

853
01:19:53,548 --> 01:19:55,615
and he is mercenary.

854
01:19:55,617 --> 01:19:59,720
What does it matter? You've worked
all your life to amass this fortune...

855
01:19:59,722 --> 01:20:03,392
knowing that Catherine would
be the only one to leave it to.

856
01:20:03,394 --> 01:20:05,494
Shouldn't she have some
happiness with it,

857
01:20:05,496 --> 01:20:08,564
even if it does mean
she has to buy it?

858
01:20:08,566 --> 01:20:14,505
There is no evidence to suggest that
he will not make a fine husband.

859
01:20:14,507 --> 01:20:17,441
Did not raise my daughter
to have so little dignity.

860
01:20:17,443 --> 01:20:20,945
What fantasy is being shattered
by her marrying this man?

861
01:20:20,947 --> 01:20:26,319
By your own account she is dimwitted,
unattractive, with no social skill or grace.

862
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,722
What dream did you have
for this prize?

863
01:20:28,724 --> 01:20:31,525
Where did Morris Townsend
fall down?

864
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:36,531
May I have some cake?
Yes, you can.

865
01:20:36,533 --> 01:20:39,634
- Well, Austin?
- Well...

866
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:46,876
I thought she'd end her days at Washington
Square in the best of comfort.

867
01:20:49,046 --> 01:20:54,652
Oh, I suppose that in some years to come,
some man might happen along, and...

868
01:20:54,654 --> 01:20:58,490
a widower, perhaps, who wouldn't
mind how she was too much,

869
01:20:58,492 --> 01:21:03,663
who would be intent to live out
the remainder of his life with her.

870
01:21:05,632 --> 01:21:09,937
The afternoon sun lights the
west section of the parlor;

871
01:21:09,939 --> 01:21:13,108
Catherine, head bent over,
embroiders...

872
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:17,612
while the widower smokes his cob
pipe and reads the newspaper.

873
01:21:17,614 --> 01:21:21,984
Well, don't you see? That'd be so perfect
for Catherine. She requires so little.

874
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:27,991
All this time I thought it was because you
didn't think he wasn't deserving of her.

875
01:21:27,993 --> 01:21:32,497
What have you done?
She will never let go.

876
01:21:53,022 --> 01:21:55,023
Please, don't stop.

877
01:22:04,068 --> 01:22:07,438
When I came into the hall just now...

878
01:22:08,741 --> 01:22:11,876
I was reminiscing about all the
times I came home to my daughter,

879
01:22:11,878 --> 01:22:15,815
almost knocking me down the steps
in her eagerness to greet me.

880
01:22:18,118 --> 01:22:20,086
Do you remember?

881
01:22:20,088 --> 01:22:23,490
I remember how
distasteful you found...

882
01:22:23,492 --> 01:22:26,694
such clumsy displays of affection.

883
01:22:27,696 --> 01:22:30,466
When I heard you...

884
01:22:30,468 --> 01:22:34,136
I... thought of your dear mother.

885
01:22:36,674 --> 01:22:39,008
Are you to marry him?

886
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:41,045
Yes, father.

887
01:22:44,983 --> 01:22:46,918
I would like...

888
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,956
a definite notice of
when you set a date.

889
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:53,993
When a poor man is about
to lose his only child,

890
01:22:53,995 --> 01:22:56,829
he would like an
inkling beforehand.

891
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,968
Thank you.

892
01:23:13,617 --> 01:23:15,852
Well, when is it to be?

893
01:23:18,523 --> 01:23:22,560
It occurs to me if I live with you,
I ought to obey you.

894
01:23:22,562 --> 01:23:25,297
If that's your theory,
it's certainly mine.

895
01:23:25,299 --> 01:23:29,668
But if I don't obey you,
I ought not to live with you...

896
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:34,741
to enjoy your...
kindness and protection.

897
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:38,879
What a distasteful idea.
It must be Mr. Townsend's.

898
01:23:38,881 --> 01:23:42,617
No.
It is mine.

899
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:46,254
Why do you speak to me thus?

900
01:23:46,256 --> 01:23:51,694
I've done nothing but try to protect
you from... from? From what, father?

901
01:23:53,598 --> 01:23:55,699
Love?

902
01:23:55,701 --> 01:23:58,336
Affection?

903
01:23:58,338 --> 01:24:00,638
Caring?

904
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,340
Respect?

905
01:24:04,644 --> 01:24:07,146
It seems you've
already departed.

906
01:24:38,385 --> 01:24:42,154
Ah, it's such a beautiful day.

907
01:24:42,156 --> 01:24:46,759
I was a little worried when you sent for
me to meet you hear and not the house.

908
01:24:46,761 --> 01:24:50,797
But now I see the reason. What
manner of man do you think I am...

909
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:53,334
to come where I am not welcome?

910
01:24:53,336 --> 01:24:57,271
Y - your father does not want me in
his house and I don't wish to be there.

911
01:24:57,273 --> 01:25:00,976
Of course.
How... how inconsiderate of me.

912
01:25:00,978 --> 01:25:04,914
Oh, let us not speak of my father today.
I am exceedingly happy.

913
01:25:04,916 --> 01:25:07,717
I'm glad you are happy.

914
01:25:07,719 --> 01:25:10,087
Are you... not well?

915
01:25:12,658 --> 01:25:16,028
You seem restless
and you look pale.

916
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:18,664
I'm afraid you are overworked.

917
01:25:18,666 --> 01:25:22,168
You oughtn't to work so hard. well,
I don't wish to owe you everything.

918
01:25:25,272 --> 01:25:29,376
I suppose you think all the
effort is on your side. No.

919
01:25:29,378 --> 01:25:33,682
No, I know how difficult the
situation has been for you.

920
01:25:33,684 --> 01:25:37,453
But it has had the advantage
of making us one.

921
01:25:37,455 --> 01:25:40,089
We will bear things together.

922
01:25:40,091 --> 01:25:43,360
There are some things we
cannot bear together...

923
01:25:43,362 --> 01:25:45,762
separation, for instance.

924
01:25:46,464 --> 01:25:48,766
Why do you speak of separation?

925
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:51,736
Will you promise not
to make a scene?

926
01:25:51,738 --> 01:25:55,808
A scene?
Do I make scenes?

927
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:58,477
I must go away on business.

928
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:01,414
Your business is with
me now, Morris. Yes!

929
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:04,350
That is what the world says.

930
01:26:04,352 --> 01:26:08,122
Where are you going?
To New Orleans to buy cotton.

931
01:26:08,124 --> 01:26:10,192
I'll go with you.

932
01:26:10,194 --> 01:26:13,128
Do you really think that I would
take you to a nest of yellow fever?

933
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:16,032
That I would expose you... if there
is yellow fever, why should you go?

934
01:26:16,034 --> 01:26:20,203
Well, to make $6,000! Or would
you deny me that satisfaction?

935
01:26:20,205 --> 01:26:22,740
If you can go to
New Orleans, I can go!

936
01:26:22,742 --> 01:26:25,843
Why shouldn't you catch yellow fever
quite as easily as I? I'm strong.

937
01:26:25,845 --> 01:26:27,555
When...
when we were in Europe,

938
01:26:27,823 --> 01:26:30,818
we were in many unhealthy places
and I never caught anything.

939
01:26:30,984 --> 01:26:34,887
Well, what will be the use of
$6,000 if you die of a fever?

940
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:38,158
When a person is going to be married,
you shouldn't think about cotton.

941
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,027
You should think about me. You could
go to New Orleans some other time.

942
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,765
They-they-they'll always
be plenty of cotton.

943
01:26:43,767 --> 01:26:46,434
You said you wouldn't make a scene.
I call this a scene.

944
01:26:46,436 --> 01:26:48,904
I have never asked
anything of you before.

945
01:26:48,906 --> 01:26:52,875
Oh, because I have nothing to give!
Thank you! I need no reminder.

946
01:26:54,445 --> 01:26:57,380
You think too much of money, Morris.
You dare say that to me?

947
01:26:57,382 --> 01:27:00,217
I... I think of money because I must
find ways to keep you in the comfort...

948
01:27:00,219 --> 01:27:02,787
to which you are accustomed.

949
01:27:02,789 --> 01:27:07,926
I can't forget that I am the reason
that you are disinherited!

950
01:27:07,928 --> 01:27:11,864
Morris...
are you going to leave me?

951
01:27:11,866 --> 01:27:15,234
Yes. yes, j... for a little while.

952
01:27:15,236 --> 01:27:17,504
For how long?

953
01:27:17,506 --> 01:27:19,540
D... until you're reasonable again.

954
01:27:19,542 --> 01:27:22,243
I shall never be reasonable again
in that way. Try to be calmer...

955
01:27:22,245 --> 01:27:24,512
The next time I come.
Is it tomorrow?

956
01:27:24,514 --> 01:27:27,082
I don't know!
Morris! Morris!

957
01:27:27,084 --> 01:27:30,319
Come tomorrow.
I'll be better tomorrow.

958
01:27:30,321 --> 01:27:35,025
I'll show you how good I can be.
I will come when I can.

959
01:27:35,027 --> 01:27:39,597
I don't have the luxury of sloth.
I work for my living.

960
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:46,038
Come along.
Don't dawdle.

961
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,106
Oh!

962
01:27:48,108 --> 01:27:51,578
My dear, what catastrophe
has befallen us?

963
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:54,915
Well, take Mr. Shakespeare's
advice: "Give sorrow words;

964
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:58,619
the grief that does not speak whispers
the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break. "

965
01:27:58,621 --> 01:28:01,456
I know not of what
sorrow you speak.

966
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:04,459
Come, come, my dear.
Your eyes are not reddened with joy.

967
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:08,130
Your pride is my pride.

968
01:28:08,132 --> 01:28:13,537
Your suscep... susceptibilities
are my... I see your side.

969
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:16,540
But I also see the
situation as a whole.

970
01:28:20,613 --> 01:28:23,449
Your father must bear
the brunt of your anger.

971
01:28:24,584 --> 01:28:27,553
Morris did everything he could.

972
01:28:27,555 --> 01:28:32,359
Oh, he was patient. He allowed
Austin to abuse him.

973
01:28:32,361 --> 01:28:35,997
How much can a young man of
his talents be expected to take?

974
01:28:35,999 --> 01:28:39,401
No, Catherine.
We must study resignation.

975
01:28:39,403 --> 01:28:42,404
Resignation... to what?

976
01:28:42,406 --> 01:28:46,109
- To a change of our plans.
- My plans have not changed.

977
01:28:47,544 --> 01:28:52,483
Oh. He hasn't told you?
Told me what?

978
01:28:52,485 --> 01:28:55,587
Well, what has happened
between you then?

979
01:28:55,589 --> 01:28:59,524
You have spoken to Mr. Townsend
about our situation?

980
01:28:59,526 --> 01:29:01,560
Yes!

981
01:29:01,562 --> 01:29:04,630
I have conferred with him.

982
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:08,568
Is it you, then, who has changed
him and made him so unnatural?

983
01:29:09,704 --> 01:29:12,140
He doesn't belong to you.

984
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:19,515
You have nothing to do
with what is between us.

985
01:29:19,517 --> 01:29:23,520
How could you be so wicked...

986
01:29:25,056 --> 01:29:27,123
So cruel?

987
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:32,229
No, father was right. You do...
you spoil everything you touch.

988
01:29:32,231 --> 01:29:36,168
I was afraid of you all the
time we were abroad.

989
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:39,706
I had no rest when thought you
were always... talking to him.

990
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:43,276
You are a most ungrateful girl.

991
01:29:44,511 --> 01:29:48,382
Do you think you're the
only one who has lost?

992
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:51,086
I thought of the young
man as my own...

993
01:29:51,088 --> 01:29:53,555
My own son.

994
01:29:54,657 --> 01:29:58,645
- I'm sure we never talked
of anything but you. - Yes.

995
01:30:00,665 --> 01:30:02,872
You talked about me
and talked about me until

996
01:30:03,113 --> 01:30:06,287
you made him sick of the
very mention of my name.

997
01:30:10,242 --> 01:30:13,312
If you truly loved him...

998
01:30:13,314 --> 01:30:15,647
you would want more for him.

999
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:52,591
- It's time? - Catherine is
downstairs in the parlor.

1000
01:31:07,677 --> 01:31:11,580
No, he said I could.
Get out of the way!

1001
01:31:11,582 --> 01:31:13,817
Ames! You should not
have come.

1002
01:31:13,819 --> 01:31:17,454
I'm past the point of propriety.

1003
01:31:17,456 --> 01:31:21,525
I apologize, Miss Sloper. I have
given up everything for you.

1004
01:31:21,527 --> 01:31:25,564
I can't be the cause of your
losing all that is dear.

1005
01:31:25,566 --> 01:31:28,600
But actually, I... I have nothing.

1006
01:31:28,602 --> 01:31:32,138
I will write to you.
That is best.

1007
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:35,275
I do not wish you to write me.

1008
01:31:35,277 --> 01:31:38,312
Be the man you profess to be.

1009
01:31:38,314 --> 01:31:42,350
Let me hear you say you are
only interested in my fortune.

1010
01:31:42,352 --> 01:31:44,352
Say it...

1011
01:31:44,354 --> 01:31:46,522
so I will never spend
a sleepless night...

1012
01:31:46,524 --> 01:31:50,192
thinking it was something
I did or did not do.

1013
01:31:50,194 --> 01:31:54,531
- At least give me that small comfort.
- Your father will comfort you.

1014
01:31:54,533 --> 01:31:58,302
Heaven deliver me from
my father's comfort.

1015
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:01,405
He will reinstate your rights when
he sees that we're not to marry.

1016
01:32:01,407 --> 01:32:03,408
Say it.
Don't push so.

1017
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:05,444
Say it!
Say what?

1018
01:32:05,446 --> 01:32:07,881
That-that I wanted you
with your money?

1019
01:32:07,883 --> 01:32:11,851
Is-is that so immoral?

1020
01:32:11,853 --> 01:32:16,290
Would you... would you want
me without my attributes?

1021
01:32:16,292 --> 01:32:19,361
You have money,
I have... I have this.

1022
01:32:19,363 --> 01:32:21,563
It was a fair exchange.

1023
01:32:30,943 --> 01:32:33,243
Catherine.

1024
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:37,215
Morris!
Morris!

1025
01:32:38,684 --> 01:32:40,785
Morris.

1026
01:32:41,755 --> 01:32:44,790
All that is mine, you can have.

1027
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:47,661
I'm industrious.
I can cook and I can sew.

1028
01:32:47,663 --> 01:32:49,729
I'll live so simply.

1029
01:32:52,702 --> 01:32:55,803
You know... 10,000 a year...
that's a fortune.

1030
01:32:55,805 --> 01:32:58,640
Oh, yeah, but not when one
was expecting 30,

1031
01:32:58,642 --> 01:33:01,710
and spent two years of one's
youth in pursuance of it.

1032
01:33:01,712 --> 01:33:03,980
I know, but...
I know, I know!

1033
01:33:03,982 --> 01:33:07,584
I know what I am.
I know what I lack.

1034
01:33:07,586 --> 01:33:10,487
But I'll be a loving,
good and understanding wife.

1035
01:33:10,489 --> 01:33:14,626
You'll never suffer a moment's
trouble from me.

1036
01:33:14,628 --> 01:33:18,763
My father... I'll go to my-my father,
and I'll beg him.

1037
01:33:18,765 --> 01:33:22,668
Oh! You cannot leave
me to that house.

1038
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:24,704
What do you want me to do?

1039
01:33:24,706 --> 01:33:27,641
Just-just tell me what you want
me to do. For God's sake!

1040
01:33:27,643 --> 01:33:31,613
What do you think I am?
I'm not good enough for you!

1041
01:33:31,615 --> 01:33:35,617
Not nearly good enough.
What do you want me to do?

1042
01:33:38,455 --> 01:33:40,589
I want you to love me.

1043
01:33:43,995 --> 01:33:45,962
Well, marry me, then.

1044
01:33:49,568 --> 01:33:51,569
Why?

1045
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,614
Morris!

1046
01:34:02,616 --> 01:34:04,351
Morris!

1047
01:34:08,657 --> 01:34:10,759
Uuh!

1048
01:34:32,352 --> 01:34:34,386
Do you want these?

1049
01:34:34,388 --> 01:34:37,691
Yes. Thank you, Greta.
It's Ginger.

1050
01:34:37,693 --> 01:34:42,363
Are you preparing for a married life
in which servants have no role?

1051
01:34:42,365 --> 01:34:45,666
The cook is frightened
of anything new.

1052
01:34:45,668 --> 01:34:48,370
If I want anything that even whispers
of the exotic, I must show her.

1053
01:34:48,372 --> 01:34:53,609
It occurs to me that you're not... treating
me with all the consideration I deserve.

1054
01:34:54,745 --> 01:34:56,779
How so?

1055
01:34:56,781 --> 01:34:59,883
We've been back from our trip
almost three months.

1056
01:34:59,885 --> 01:35:03,554
You must have set your wedding date.
I asked that you give me notice.

1057
01:35:04,757 --> 01:35:07,025
I have not left your house.

1058
01:35:07,027 --> 01:35:12,665
Perhaps not in body, but you may
as well be under the conjugal roof...

1059
01:35:12,667 --> 01:35:15,535
for all the benefit we
have of your society.

1060
01:35:15,537 --> 01:35:17,537
Well...

1061
01:35:22,044 --> 01:35:25,780
I will try to be more sociable.

1062
01:35:25,782 --> 01:35:28,450
I think you ought to.

1063
01:35:28,452 --> 01:35:31,788
You strike me you're a
very lucky young lady.

1064
01:35:37,629 --> 01:35:42,066
It would be a convenience to know
when I can expect an empty house.

1065
01:35:42,068 --> 01:35:46,571
For when you go,
your aunt marches.

1066
01:35:46,573 --> 01:35:49,609
Is it tomorrow?
Next week?

1067
01:35:49,611 --> 01:35:51,644
I shall not be leaving.

1068
01:35:51,646 --> 01:35:55,015
He's backed out?

1069
01:35:55,017 --> 01:35:58,452
I have broken off
my engagement.

1070
01:36:00,189 --> 01:36:03,725
I have asked him to leave New
York for a long, long time.

1071
01:36:05,729 --> 01:36:08,764
How does he take his dismissal?
I don't know.

1072
01:36:08,766 --> 01:36:10,934
You mean you don't care.

1073
01:36:10,936 --> 01:36:14,604
You're very cruel,
after encouraging him...

1074
01:36:14,606 --> 01:36:16,774
and playing him for so long.

1075
01:36:16,776 --> 01:36:18,810
I am my father's daughter.

1076
01:36:24,218 --> 01:36:26,485
Almost.
Two more.

1077
01:36:27,822 --> 01:36:29,889
Yes, and... very good!

1078
01:36:29,891 --> 01:36:32,993
Happy birthday!
Yea'!

1079
01:36:32,995 --> 01:36:35,696
All right. Sit down, everyone,
on your seats...

1080
01:36:35,698 --> 01:36:38,733
like ladies and gentlemen,
not animals in the zoo.

1081
01:36:38,735 --> 01:36:42,771
Put your napkins on
your clothes, please.

1082
01:36:42,773 --> 01:36:45,675
Let me have my godchild.
Not me.

1083
01:36:45,677 --> 01:36:49,213
He is my darling.

1084
01:36:49,215 --> 01:36:52,049
You haven't eaten all day.

1085
01:36:52,051 --> 01:36:55,119
Can you believe my daughter
is eight years old?

1086
01:36:55,121 --> 01:36:58,923
Doesn't seem like yesterday we were
here for the purpose of my engagement?

1087
01:36:58,925 --> 01:37:02,261
It seems very long ago to me.

1088
01:37:02,263 --> 01:37:05,699
Another lifetime.

1089
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:08,802
Suppose when I think about
it it does to me too.

1090
01:37:10,772 --> 01:37:13,274
They were good days,
though, Catherine;

1091
01:37:13,276 --> 01:37:16,812
full of promise, expectation.

1092
01:37:17,747 --> 01:37:20,048
Our whole future lay before us.

1093
01:37:22,653 --> 01:37:24,721
Catherine...

1094
01:37:27,092 --> 01:37:30,661
The comfort of being an idiot is
that people pardon you readily.

1095
01:37:30,663 --> 01:37:33,698
- Hmm.
- Forgive me.

1096
01:37:36,702 --> 01:37:39,672
Dr. Ludlow.

1097
01:37:39,674 --> 01:37:41,741
Welcome.
Good evening, Marian.

1098
01:37:41,743 --> 01:37:45,779
# And light fairies

1099
01:37:45,781 --> 01:37:48,115
# Babies, foxes

1100
01:37:48,117 --> 01:37:51,252
# Elves so merry

1101
01:37:51,254 --> 01:37:54,690
# Come to see me now

1102
01:37:54,692 --> 01:37:59,328
# Then go, please go

1103
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:02,999
# And dance with them

1104
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:06,604
# So go, please go

1105
01:38:06,606 --> 01:38:09,740
# All night again

1106
01:38:09,742 --> 01:38:13,612
# Is not that a perfect picture?

1107
01:38:13,614 --> 01:38:16,849
# Will be waiting there

1108
01:38:16,851 --> 01:38:19,953
You know,
you really should try it.

1109
01:38:21,055 --> 01:38:24,725
What are you
suggesting we try?

1110
01:38:24,727 --> 01:38:29,631
Motherhood. Well,
marriage first, of course.

1111
01:38:29,633 --> 01:38:32,601
At least, to lead in.

1112
01:38:32,603 --> 01:38:37,773
Alas, it is not I who
possess the cold feet.

1113
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:41,812
I'm going to go and
get some port.

1114
01:38:41,814 --> 01:38:44,716
I leave my future in
very capable hands.

1115
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:55,795
Do you want one?
He's so charming, Catherine.

1116
01:38:55,797 --> 01:38:58,965
It seems exceedingly
rude to refuse him.

1117
01:38:58,967 --> 01:39:02,203
He'd make a good husband.

1118
01:39:04,706 --> 01:39:07,676
Get help!

1119
01:39:07,678 --> 01:39:10,012
Keep back.
Give the man some air.

1120
01:39:10,014 --> 01:39:13,650
Catherine, Catherine!

1121
01:39:13,652 --> 01:39:15,418
Catherine!

1122
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,688
He's not breathing.

1123
01:39:32,806 --> 01:39:34,908
Father?

1124
01:39:40,883 --> 01:39:44,920
Who would ever have believed that
doctors make the worst patients?

1125
01:39:44,922 --> 01:39:47,356
I would.

1126
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:03,341
You never changed this room.

1127
01:40:03,343 --> 01:40:07,413
In this room,
I could allow her presence.

1128
01:40:12,854 --> 01:40:16,724
Do you suppose you'll
marry John Ludlow?

1129
01:40:19,762 --> 01:40:21,830
No.

1130
01:40:22,798 --> 01:40:24,834
I don't suppose I shall.

1131
01:40:26,403 --> 01:40:31,475
Is it, by chance, because you plan to
marry Townsend after my death?

1132
01:40:37,082 --> 01:40:40,285
I will not listen to talk of death.
I'm dying.

1133
01:40:41,221 --> 01:40:43,255
There's nothin' to talk about.

1134
01:40:43,257 --> 01:40:46,292
As a physician,
I understand these things.

1135
01:40:51,266 --> 01:40:53,267
It would give me
great satisfaction...

1136
01:40:53,269 --> 01:40:58,006
if you were to promise that upon my
death you will not marry Townsend.

1137
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:02,812
I very seldom think
of Mr. Townsend.

1138
01:41:02,814 --> 01:41:05,848
All the easier to
keep your promise.

1139
01:41:07,117 --> 01:41:09,186
I can't promise.

1140
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:12,824
You're very obstinate.

1141
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,962
I don't think you understand.

1142
01:41:17,964 --> 01:41:19,965
Please explain, then.

1143
01:41:22,502 --> 01:41:24,571
I can't explain.

1144
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:27,841
And I can't promise.

1145
01:41:57,578 --> 01:42:01,881
The will of record divided
Dr. Sloper's estate in six ways.

1146
01:42:01,883 --> 01:42:05,619
Mrs. Penniman is to receive $2,000
a year for the rest of her life.

1147
01:42:05,621 --> 01:42:07,856
And Mrs. Almond,
the same amount.

1148
01:42:07,858 --> 01:42:10,425
To his cousins,
Bethann and Robert Lawson,

1149
01:42:10,427 --> 01:42:13,295
he's left a one-time gift of $500.

1150
01:42:13,297 --> 01:42:16,866
Maureen O'Donnell is to receive...

1151
01:42:16,868 --> 01:42:18,902
$100 a year in addition
to her salary...

1152
01:42:18,904 --> 01:42:23,039
as long as she remains an employee
at 21 Washington Square.

1153
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:26,611
Catherine Sloper is to receive
the balance of the estate,

1154
01:42:26,613 --> 01:42:30,382
valued somewhere
upwards of $300,000.

1155
01:42:32,385 --> 01:42:36,055
As I've said, that is
the will of record,

1156
01:42:36,057 --> 01:42:38,925
written some ten years ago.

1157
01:42:38,927 --> 01:42:42,162
However, several weeks
before his death,

1158
01:42:42,164 --> 01:42:44,398
the Doctor recorded the codicil.

1159
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,902
"The amounts accorded to all...

1160
01:42:46,904 --> 01:42:49,671
"remain unchanged
with one exception:

1161
01:42:49,673 --> 01:42:52,108
"In the case of Catherine Sloper,

1162
01:42:52,110 --> 01:42:55,848
"her portion has been reduced to
this house on Washington Square.

1163
01:42:56,218 --> 01:42:58,517
The bulk of the estate goes
to various and sundry

1164
01:42:58,552 --> 01:43:01,052
medical institutions
around the city. "

1165
01:43:01,087 --> 01:43:02,686
He wrote an explanation
of this change,

1166
01:43:02,688 --> 01:43:05,657
which, I'm sure, you'll wish
to read in private, Miss Sloper.

1167
01:43:05,659 --> 01:43:09,461
Please, read the codicil, Mr. Webber.

1168
01:43:09,463 --> 01:43:13,065
This is something between you
and your father, Miss Sloper.

1169
01:43:15,503 --> 01:43:17,704
Would you please excuse us?

1170
01:43:17,706 --> 01:43:20,174
No. We have some family
matters to attend to.

1171
01:43:20,176 --> 01:43:23,010
By the very nature
of the gesture...

1172
01:43:23,712 --> 01:43:25,981
and the fact...

1173
01:43:26,716 --> 01:43:29,484
Please, everyone, sit.

1174
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:33,323
And please read it to me,
Mr. Webber.

1175
01:43:37,529 --> 01:43:41,131
"She is amply provided for
on her mother's side,

1176
01:43:41,133 --> 01:43:45,503
"never having spent more than a fraction
of her income from this source.

1177
01:43:45,505 --> 01:43:48,641
"So that her fortune is already
more than sufficient to attract...

1178
01:43:48,643 --> 01:43:52,579
"the unscrupulous adventurers who
she has given me reason to believe...

1179
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:56,183
that she persists in regarding
as an interesting class. "

1180
01:43:56,185 --> 01:43:59,654
- You must break the will.
- No, no, no. I...

1181
01:43:59,656 --> 01:44:02,757
I like it very much.

1182
01:44:02,759 --> 01:44:07,096
Catherine, it's... it's a travesty.
No, no.

1183
01:44:07,098 --> 01:44:09,199
I think, um, it's rather flattering.

1184
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:13,003
I think it's the perfectly
fitting conclusion...

1185
01:44:13,005 --> 01:44:17,742
to the saga of father's
all-important fortune.

1186
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:22,381
I like it...
very much, indeed.

1187
01:44:23,483 --> 01:44:27,687
Let's have, um,
some tea, shall we?

1188
01:44:27,689 --> 01:44:30,757
Oh, no, no.
Perhaps something stronger.

1189
01:44:30,759 --> 01:44:33,761
Aunt Lavinia, let's break
out the good port.

1190
01:44:33,763 --> 01:44:36,631
Well, is it not customary to
celebrate the reading of the will?

1191
01:44:39,302 --> 01:44:41,669
Come on, everyone.
Join me, please.

1192
01:44:45,276 --> 01:44:49,613
# There once was a plain
little piece of string #

1193
01:44:49,615 --> 01:44:54,285
# All alone and with
nothing to do #

1194
01:44:54,287 --> 01:44:58,724
# Each night it would wish
more than anything #

1195
01:44:58,726 --> 01:45:03,262
# For a someone to tie itself to #

1196
01:45:03,264 --> 01:45:07,801
# Then one day a finger
came wandering by #

1197
01:45:07,803 --> 01:45:12,406
# And the plain little string
quickly caught his eye #

1198
01:45:12,408 --> 01:45:16,645
# The finger said just
come along with me

1199
01:45:16,647 --> 01:45:20,850
# I can tell you how
happy you'll be #

1200
01:45:20,852 --> 01:45:26,123
# I have a broken
string on my fiddle

1201
01:45:26,125 --> 01:45:29,626
# I cannot play a
thing on my fiddle #

1202
01:45:29,628 --> 01:45:34,099
# And musically speaking
you're just what I'm seeking #

1203
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:38,370
# With you I'll be able to play #

1204
01:45:38,372 --> 01:45:42,476
# You've made a mistake
said the little string #

1205
01:45:42,478 --> 01:45:46,813
# I have never made music before #

1206
01:45:46,815 --> 01:45:51,385
# The finger said I'll teach
you how to sing #

1207
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:55,624
# And you won't be
alone anymore #

1208
01:45:55,626 --> 01:45:59,762
# He played on the string
at a fancy dress ball #

1209
01:45:59,764 --> 01:46:04,267
# And the sound thrilled the
dancers and filled the hall #

1210
01:46:04,269 --> 01:46:08,205
# So sometimes a plain
little piece of string #

1211
01:46:08,207 --> 01:46:12,777
# Makes the prettiest
music of all #

1212
01:46:13,913 --> 01:46:17,650
- Going-home time.
- Aww!

1213
01:46:17,652 --> 01:46:21,255
Well, it must be no one wants the
biscuits that grandma's baked.

1214
01:46:25,627 --> 01:46:28,630
Edith, is your mother working
late again tonight? Mm-hmm.

1215
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,598
Wait for me!

1216
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:33,235
Well, you must help me
clean up this mess!

1217
01:46:36,506 --> 01:46:39,576
I never can seem to
manage it alone.

1218
01:46:39,578 --> 01:46:41,945
There's always so much to do.

1219
01:46:43,815 --> 01:46:47,418
What have you got there?
My book.

1220
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:49,454
What is that?

1221
01:46:51,791 --> 01:46:54,394
What's that say?
"Ups... "

1222
01:46:54,396 --> 01:46:57,797
Upsetting.

1223
01:46:57,799 --> 01:47:03,737
That's right. "Pondo,
the dog, who was... "

1224
01:47:03,739 --> 01:47:07,509
Oh, my dear!
Oh, my dear, this will not do!

1225
01:47:07,511 --> 01:47:11,214
It will not do at all.
What? Aunt?

1226
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:14,483
You know, the most... the most
extraordinary happenstance.

1227
01:47:14,485 --> 01:47:16,553
Oh, I had the good...
now promise me...

1228
01:47:16,555 --> 01:47:18,755
Oh, promise me...
promise me you'll be civil.

1229
01:47:18,757 --> 01:47:20,791
Promise me, Catherine.

1230
01:47:20,793 --> 01:47:22,827
Promise me.

1231
01:47:24,597 --> 01:47:26,664
Thank you.

1232
01:47:36,744 --> 01:47:39,780
Aunt, um, could you take Edith
in for some milk and biscuits?

1233
01:47:39,782 --> 01:47:42,817
Oh, yes.
Come along now.

1234
01:47:42,819 --> 01:47:45,354
What's your name?
Edna? Edith.

1235
01:47:45,356 --> 01:47:47,823
Come on.

1236
01:48:00,339 --> 01:48:02,474
There have been changes.

1237
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:06,479
Hmm.

1238
01:48:12,887 --> 01:48:15,989
How have the years treated you,
Morris? Badly.

1239
01:48:15,991 --> 01:48:18,860
But, um...

1240
01:48:18,862 --> 01:48:22,931
I suppose you would say that's
as it should have been.

1241
01:48:28,873 --> 01:48:30,740
You look very well.

1242
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:35,846
I have...

1243
01:48:35,848 --> 01:48:38,750
I have ventured...

1244
01:48:38,752 --> 01:48:41,787
I so much wanted to...

1245
01:48:44,023 --> 01:48:47,894
I was determined that...
will you not sit down?

1246
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:50,898
No, I think I had better not.

1247
01:48:57,473 --> 01:48:59,541
For many years it has been...

1248
01:48:59,543 --> 01:49:03,746
my deepest desire
to be friends again.

1249
01:49:05,615 --> 01:49:07,784
Well, we both know
we were never friends.

1250
01:49:07,786 --> 01:49:10,754
Oh, Catherine,
you do me an injustice.

1251
01:49:13,625 --> 01:49:15,593
You treated me badly.

1252
01:49:15,595 --> 01:49:18,731
Not if you think of it rightly.

1253
01:49:18,733 --> 01:49:20,766
You had your life
with your father,

1254
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:24,404
which was what I couldn't
make up my mind to rob you of.

1255
01:49:24,406 --> 01:49:26,439
Yes.
I had that.

1256
01:49:28,510 --> 01:49:31,812
The past can be put behind us
if you will allow it.

1257
01:49:31,814 --> 01:49:33,782
I will not allow it.

1258
01:49:33,784 --> 01:49:36,718
You hurt me too badly.

1259
01:49:38,454 --> 01:49:40,790
I felt it very much.

1260
01:49:40,792 --> 01:49:42,859
I felt it for years.

1261
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:46,830
It made a great
change in my life.

1262
01:49:49,634 --> 01:49:51,970
But I can't talk about it.

1263
01:49:57,878 --> 01:50:00,112
Why didn't you marry, then?

1264
01:50:00,114 --> 01:50:02,816
Lavinia tells me...

1265
01:50:02,818 --> 01:50:04,885
there have been chances.

1266
01:50:04,887 --> 01:50:07,155
I didn't wish to marry.

1267
01:50:07,157 --> 01:50:09,190
Yes.

1268
01:50:10,993 --> 01:50:13,028
You had nothing to gain.

1269
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:15,097
I had nothing to gain.

1270
01:50:20,638 --> 01:50:23,106
What ever else
happened, I did...

1271
01:50:23,108 --> 01:50:25,176
I did love once.

1272
01:50:26,845 --> 01:50:29,881
Well, actually.

1273
01:50:32,919 --> 01:50:34,954
Do you hate me?

1274
01:50:34,956 --> 01:50:37,023
No.

1275
01:50:37,958 --> 01:50:41,028
But please don't
come here again.

1276
01:50:48,786 --> 01:50:50,426
Good-bye, then.

1277
