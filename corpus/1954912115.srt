You hurt yourself badly.

397

In rereading the transcripts of your case,
I was struck by something.

398
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,420
You claimed that on your 18th birthday,

399
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,660
you were essentially
possessed by the devil.

400
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,000
Correct?

401
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,361
But you testified you believed
that this was only the first phase.

402
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,300
You quoted your school counselor,
Dr. Emerson,

403
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,100
the woman who betrayed you,

404
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,380
as saying, "We have watched you grow.

There are great things ahead.

You are the one."

407
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,940
You said in court that you've come
to believe that what she meant by that...

408
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,523
was that you will be the one who will
return Satan to this mortal coil.

Is that correct?

410
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,811
You believe your possession on your
18th birthday is like a pregnancy...

411
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,684
A pregnancy you thought would come
to term in your 24th year.

Don't you see, Molly?

Maybe this is some sort of psychosomatic

You believed this would happen
on your 24th birthday,

415
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,340
so now your mind is willing it to be.

416
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,728
And it's manifesting physically
with the vomiting and the noises.

417

need to incubate from 18 to 24?

HAWTHORNE: That's the thing.

585
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,322
In high school, she was
an average student. Nothing special.

586
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,250
Then on her 18th birthday,
everything changed.

What about in literature?

00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,420
John Milton, Paradise Lost?

594
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,940
It's doubtful she'd have
any of that knowledge.

Not from business school, anyway.

Mighty Satan, we entreat you
to accept this sacrifice...

887
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,580
of your very own mother...

888
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:57,540
The woman who bore your seed for 666,

889
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,780
the woman who brought you to term...

890
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,940
That you may
return to us in blasphemy...

891
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,884

have prophesied.

Being a lamb of God makes it easier
to lead you to the slaughter.

901

You.

902

shall bear witness to it all.

Devil's father?

906
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,940
You are the one who birthed him
from his mother...

907
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,611
through your profane exorcism.

908
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,321
Okay. All right, listen to me.
Don't hurt her, okay?

909
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,248
These are the devil's spirit.

910
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,420
And when they mingle
with her slain blood...

911

- The Leviathan shall arise!

912
