1
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:04,342
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:26,535
(brooding music)

3
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,530
- [Woman] You used to
say, humans and birds

4
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,360
have the same reaction to fear.

5
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,387
(panting)

6
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:46,717
(footsteps thudding)

7
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:54,826
(cacophonous dramatic music)

8
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:33,028
The difference between us and them?

9
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:36,140
(eerie brooding music)
We can't fly away.

10
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,249
(birds chirping)

11
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:52,889
- [Woman] Group meeting in 10!

12
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,720
(brooding tranquil music)

13
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,418
(chattering)

14
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:13,377
- Can I, (claps), hi can I
get everyone's attention?

15
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:16,710
(serene ethereal music)

16
00:02:31,132 --> 00:02:34,417
(tense music)

17
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,642
- Hey!

18
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:36,475
- [Woman] I don't know though...

19
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:37,470
(mumbling)
- Virginia, take a

20
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,208
seat please, give me that.

21
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,041
(chattering)
Give me that,

22
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,433
no eating in the common room, okay?

23
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,140
(rapping)
- I told her that.

24
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,050
- Okay good morning ladies.

25
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,686
- Good morning!
- Morning!

26
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:51,357
- Okay, today we're gonna
talk about feelings.

27
00:02:51,357 --> 00:02:52,609
- Oh here we go.
- Ooh!

28
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,413
(chattering)
- Okay enough!

29
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:57,100
- I have lots of feelings.
- We all know this is

30
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,910
feelings day today, this
isn't news to anyone.

31
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,260
- Do you want me to pass those out?

32
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,620
- No, Virginia.

33
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,910
I can tell some of you are maybe feeling

34
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,260
a little frustrated.

35
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,703
There's a card for that.

36
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,010
So instead of projecting your feelings,

37
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,783
come up here and grab a card.

38
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:30,834
All right.

39
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,807
Andy let's start with you.

40
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,070
- Why me?
- There has to be a reason?

41
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,663
You've been here a while,
you know how this works.

42
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,420
- Blue, peaceful, it's the feeling card

43
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,453
of feeling peaceful.

44
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,123
- So you are feeling peaceful?

45
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,013
- Yes.

46
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,623
- You picked up a red
and then put it back.

47
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,080
- So what?
- So why did you

48
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,893
pick up a red feeling card if
you're just feeling peaceful?

49
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,320
There's a big difference between a

50
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,680
blue feeling card and a red.

51
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,600
The red card is the feeling of anger.

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,943
- I know what the red feeling card is for.

53
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,950
- So are you feeling
angry, because you have

54
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,903
to go home tomorrow to see
your mom and your family?

55
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,140
Maybe it's actually a yellow?

56
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,800
- Fear.
- Shut up!

57
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,713
- [Woman] Stop it!

58
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,240
- Maybe you're afraid, afraid
to go to the memorial service?

59
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,840
- Well look hey I'm not afraid!

60
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,973
Here!
(thumping)

61
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,030
- Okay is there anyone
else here that feels

62
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,130
like they can relate to
Andy's anger this morning?

63
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,963
- No
- Nope.

64
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:07,850
- She's alone.
- No.

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,110
- Really?

66
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,943
You're green?

67
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,020
- Yes!
- That's the feeling card

68
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,660
for feeling calm and polite.

69
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,970
- I am very calm and polite.
- That is the last feeling

70
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,590
card I would ever use to describe you!

71
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,490
- Oh really?
- That's very true Andy.

72
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,213
- Fuck off Viriginia Slim!

73
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,260
(chattering)

74
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,180
What?
- Stop it!

75
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,250
Andrea, you've made your point.

76
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,380
- Oh okay you know what I am just

77
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,040
going to take my cereal
and go back to my room.

78
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,284
- Ooh!
- That is (mumbles)!

79
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:38,490
(chattering)

80
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,070
- Virginia you want to go next?

81
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,100
- I do (sighs),

82
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,485
I do but she, she's not supposed
to take food to her room.

83
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:49,485
(ethereal music)
(chattering)

84
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:06,274
(brooding music)

85
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:26,040
- Hmm!
- Ah, yeah come in.

86
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,120
- You're so lucky your mom
is always sending you stuff!

87
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,140
I wish I had a mom like you!

88
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,093
Can she adopt me?

89
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,673
- She would probably love to adopt you.

90
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:38,313
Maybe we could trade places.

91
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,210
Well, what are you doing?

92
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,340
- I really want to open it,
it's making me very anxious,

93
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,520
not opening it, so, Andy if you could--

94
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,446
(rustling)
Ooh!

95
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,910
(giggles) Ah, well...

96
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,576
Wow!

97
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:01,448
(sniffing)
Oh, that smells like heaven!

98
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:03,615
(sighing)

99
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,370
- You can have it.

100
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,920
You know, you can have all of it actually.

101
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,613
Except for these.
(rattling)

102
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:22,300
All right, I got to go to work.

103
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,850
- What time are you off?

104
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,970
I have some gluten-free
cookies in the oven,

105
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,187
I really need you to try them.

106
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:30,760
- Uh, maybe when I get back.

107
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,593
Save me some?

108
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,923
- Try!
- Good.

109
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,530
You know, Roland always
steals my cookies (chuckles).

110
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,410
- Oh Andy!
(ethereal poignant music)

111
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,103
Um, you forgot this!

112
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:47,662
- Thanks (mumbles).

113
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:52,079
(sighing)
(mumbling)

114
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,657
Off to work Roland!
- Curfew's 10!

115
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:07,941
(bell ringing)
Who is smoking?

116
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:10,941
(eerie tense music)

117
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:24,828
(pensive music)

118
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,690
- Si!
- It's me.

119
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,720
- [Man] You're late Andrea!

120
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,553
- A few minutes.

121
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:25,921
(speaking foreign language)

122
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,673
- Your Italian's getting good.

123
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:28,506
- Grazie.

124
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,403
- For you.

125
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,203
- What is this?
- Just open it.

126
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:37,600
- It's not my birthday.

127
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,433
- Uh-huh.

128
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:49,793
For your six months sober.

129
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:54,251
- Oh...

130
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,953
I can't take it,

131
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:58,070
it's too much!
- No no no, you deserve it!

132
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:11,440
- What does it mean?

133
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,603
- That's Mother Mary, she will
be your faithful companion.

134
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,120
- Hmm, I'm not very religious.

135
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,843
- Everybody needs a little faith, bella.

136
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,200
Now get back to work, okay?

137
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,820
- Grazie!
(mumbling)

138
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:41,633
(tense music)
(wind whispering)

139
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,650
(rumbling)

140
00:11:26,063 --> 00:11:29,980
(jangling rock and roll music)

141
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:34,035
(tense music)

142
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:45,092
(jangling rock and roll music)

143
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:48,927
(tense music)

144
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:55,791
(jangling rock and roll music)

145
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,125
(tense music)

146
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:34,176
- [Andy] Oh, this is dramatic.

147
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:39,009
- Who are you?

148
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:39,842
Go away!

149
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:43,505
- I think I'll stay here.

150
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:46,265
- I'd really appreciate it,

151
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,596
if you'd go away.

152
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:49,930
(crickets chirping)
- Look, I don't know why

153
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,711
you're here, but you don't
need to be doing this.

154
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:54,050
- That's exactly right, you
don't know why I'm here,

155
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,393
so please, go away.

156
00:12:57,886 --> 00:12:59,520
(distant train horn blowing)
- So tell me,

157
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,620
I have plenty of time.

158
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,680
- All (mumbles),
(train horn blowing)

159
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,007
it'd be a waste of breath.

160
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,980
- Do you realize how fast these trains go?

161
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,470
- Yes, can you leave?
- I mean they probably go

162
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,550
as fast as a plane
that's about to take off,

163
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,730
that is a lot of speed!
- Can you leave?

164
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,230
- We gonna do this?

165
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,650
Because if we are I am prepared,

166
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,021
- We?
- and the good news is,

167
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:24,830
(mumbling)
- No we are not gonna do this.

168
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,820
Because there is no we!

169
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,120
So please just go away!

170
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,330
- How fast are (mumbles)?
- You don't understand!

171
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,854
- So help me.
- Just fuck off!

172
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,915
- I can't I'm involved now sorry!

173
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:36,584
- Get out of here!
- I (mumbles)!

174
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:37,806
(mumbling)
- Can't you hear that?

175
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:38,896
- You hear that?

176
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:40,410
- [Man] This isn't
about you it's about me!

177
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,577
- Not anymore!

178
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:46,174
(train whistling)
(cars shrieking)

179
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:49,257
(train horn blowing)

180
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,890
- You're fucking crazy!
- Oh oh well I'm crazy?

181
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,003
You know you really should be thanking me!

182
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,720
- Thank, you...

183
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,643
- If it wasn't for me, you
would be dead right now!

184
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,709
I'm not the one who was
lying down on the tracks

185
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,400
in the middle of the day drunk!

186
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,461
I'm not the one with the issues here dude!

187
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,621
(tense music)

188
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:15,151
- You know nothing,
absolutely nothing about me!

189
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:17,836
You are the one on the tracks with me!

190
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:20,336
(tense music)

191
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:26,192
(train hissing)

192
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:41,833
Hey!

193
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,666
Hey!

194
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,110
You know what you did back there?

195
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,680
In some states it's highly illegal.

196
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,753
- Oh, I'm sorry, for saving your life!

197
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,753
- You know I could sue
you for what you did!

198
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,603
- You're like a five year old little boy.

199
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:02,150
- (mumbles) 90 year old, old lady!

200
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,050
- [Andy] Seriously, stop following me!

201
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:10,470
- Can I come with you?

202
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,660
- What?

203
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,280
- Seriously, wherever you going, I'm in.

204
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,943
Listen, let's start over.

205
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,220
I'm Jim.
- No no Jim,

206
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,940
I don't need to know your name,
I don't know you like that.

207
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,840
- [Jim] Like what?

208
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,923
So--
- Sh!

209
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:31,919
- Okay.

210
00:15:32,928 --> 00:15:35,428
(tense music)

211
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,646
I just want to say this is in no way--

212
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:45,646
- Sh!

213
00:15:57,812 --> 00:16:00,645
(water splashing)

214
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,273
- Your turn.
- What?

215
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:07,290
No I don't believe in wishes.

216
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,533
- [Andy] Have a little faith.

217
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:10,514
- Faith?

218
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,128
Yeah, right.

219
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,545
- Come on, you got your coin?

220
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,113
Hold it, tight.

221
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,713
Close your eyes.

222
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,083
Close, close your eyes.

223
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:31,649
Okay.
- This is stupid.

224
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,803
- All right, this is your
chance, to make a wish.

225
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,960
Forget it, don't call it a wish.

226
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,093
It's a bottle, with a message.

227
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,820
Something that you want
someone out there to hear.

228
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,458
This is your chance.

229
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:04,578
(water splashing)

230
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,993
- Now what?

231
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:13,257
- Ah, still trying to figure that out.

232
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,913
Andy.
- Huh?

233
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:21,512
- That's my name.

234
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:24,755
- That's a boy's name.

235
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:29,390
- [Andy] Come on.

236
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:35,098
(optimistic pensive music)

237
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,202
(thumping)
- What is this place?

238
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,035
- What?

239
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,958
It's okay, I know another way.

240
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:13,138
- Whoa.

241
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:15,805
(pensive music)

242
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:27,985
Live here?

243
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:29,222
- No.

244
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:30,980
I don't live here.

245
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,630
I just come here sometimes.

246
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,493
- [Jim] Oh yeah, to get some food.

247
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,851
- Cookies.
- Hmm.

248
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,018
- Gluten-free.

249
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,753
So.

250
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:54,427
- So what you do?

251
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,070
- I work.
- You work,

252
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,763
you got a job, it's like, EMS.

253
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,733
Eastern Mountain Sports.

254
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,383
Backpack?

255
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,890
Funny, joke...

256
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,263
- Clever.
(chuckling)

257
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,593
No, I don't work at
Eastern Mountain Sports.

258
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,340
Moretti Cleaners.
- Dry cleaners?

259
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,240
- Yeah, (mumbles).

260
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,563
You know I probably cleaned
all your dirty clothes.

261
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:33,540
- I don't got any dirty clothes.

262
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,830
- No?

263
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,170
What about hat dirty suit,
lying on some train tracks.

264
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,420
Might need to be cleaned.

265
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,983
- Maybe.

266
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,633
- Speaking of which, why were
you laying on those tracks?

267
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,700
- It's complicated.

268
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,170
- I think I can handle complicated.

269
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,003
Try me.

270
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,556
- I just got out of prison.

271
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,013
- Yeah right.
- I'm serious.

272
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,283
Pretty real huh?

273
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,303
- Like, prison, prison?
- Yeah like prison prison.

274
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,833
- For how long?
- A year.

275
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,020
- What's prison like?

276
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:39,463
- You keep your head
low, that's what I did.

277
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:42,453
Then you seem tough.

278
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,320
- Yeah, you're a real bad ass.

279
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,153
- Hmm.

280
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,193
I got involved with some
stupid, stupid stuff.

281
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,483
I had a job in the banks in Jersey City.

282
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,873
I got involved with
some guys, my coworkers.

283
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,073
They were doing some pretty shady things.

284
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,333
Insider trading shit.

285
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,963
Parents, they bailed him out
but I didn't have that luxury.

286
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,830
It was my boss really, he was the one.

287
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,980
Lied to me from the
first moment I met him.

288
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,551
When the time came he
threw me under the buss

289
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:26,884
and that was it.

290
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,630
- [Andy] What was your boss's name?

291
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,980
- What was his name?
- Yeah what was his name?

292
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,680
- Walt.
- Walt?

293
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,660
- Walt.
- Walt as in like,

294
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,173
Walter?
- Yeah like Walter.

295
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:41,230
- Eww.
- You don't like that?

296
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,000
- Hi, my name is Walt!
(chuckling)

297
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,940
- Nice to meet you Walt.
- Nice to meet you.

298
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,760
I'm an asshole!
- Yeah you are an asshole,

299
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,760
you put a perfectly normal,
innocent kid in prison.

300
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,460
- Oh Jim, yes!

301
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,293
- Yeah Jim, you know

302
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:56,660
Jim all right!
- Jim, I know Jim well!

303
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,390
- Jim, Jimbo.
- No, no no no, never, Jimbo.

304
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,690
- Never Jimbo.

305
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,300
Well never Jimbo thinks you're an asshole!

306
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,790
- Excuse me, please do
not curse in my office!

307
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,470
- Excuse me shut up,
this isn't your office,

308
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,503
this is my office, shut up and leave!

309
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,913
- All right, Walt is leaving.

310
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,700
- Where you going?

311
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,563
Hey, Walt!

312
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,423
Andy!

313
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:36,125
(door clattering)

314
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:44,126
What are you doing, no,
you're not hitchhiking!

315
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:47,276
- Oh, come on, live a little.

316
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:48,693
- Heh, this is...

317
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,490
Not happening, never in a million years,

318
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,350
are you gonna...

319
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:01,341
- [Andy] Hey, I got two
bucks, can I get ride?

320
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,384
- Yeah.
- All right, cool.

321
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:08,860
Cone on!

322
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,261
You said you wanted to go where I'm going.

323
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:13,511
(unsteady tense music)

324
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,913
- [Andy] Where are we going?

325
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,790
- Jersey City.
- No, no!

326
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,547
Can you just do me a favor
and pull over please?

327
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,223
- No, don't pull over.

328
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,577
(sighs) You need to trust me,

329
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:41,427
this is gonna be really good for you.

330
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:44,950
Be good for your health.

331
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,845
- My health's just fine thank you.

332
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:48,890
- Yeah I'm not so sure about that.

333
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,238
- How's your health?

334
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:52,738
(tense music)

335
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,770
What are we gonna do here?

336
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,566
Stare at the building?
- Don't worry about it.

337
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:14,334
We'll be right back, don't leave yet.

338
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:19,334
- [Driver] (mumbles),
yeah, thanks (mumbles).

339
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,023
- Damn!

340
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,686
- Fucking what is this place?

341
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:36,853
- It's pretty.

342
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,110
Brought us something.

343
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,080
(tense music)

344
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,267
Here, throw it.

345
00:24:54,772 --> 00:24:57,685
- You want me to throw it?
- Throw it.

346
00:24:57,685 --> 00:25:01,018
- Throw this (mumbles)?

347
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:03,642
So I'm gonna throw it at the building.

348
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:04,475
- Uh-hmm.

349
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,077
- I have a pretty strong arm.

350
00:25:08,077 --> 00:25:11,495
- I did quarterback.
- I ran track.

351
00:25:11,495 --> 00:25:12,427
(grunting)

352
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,724
(brick clattering)

353
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:19,307
(metallic clattering)
Shit!

354
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:23,386
Which way was your boss's office?

355
00:25:23,386 --> 00:25:24,386
- Over here.

356
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:43,764
(glass breaking)

357
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:46,514
(brooding music)

358
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,135
(bellowing)
(glass breaking)

359
00:25:59,135 --> 00:26:02,385
(tense brooding music)

360
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:13,449
(brick clattering)

361
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,395
(alarm wailing)

362
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:06,050
Let's go.
- Okay.

363
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,110
- Yeah.

364
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,943
You too.

365
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,073
Okay, goodnight.

366
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:18,314
(pencil tapping)

367
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:21,074
(humming)

368
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,700
(knocking)

369
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,663
- Smell my hair!

370
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,230
- Oh, vanilla, nice.
- Uh hmm, Andy gave me

371
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,030
her shampoo, I can't stop smelling it!

372
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,740
- Oh, do you know what she
was doing this evening?

373
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,723
- Uh, just work, why?

374
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,310
- Well it's about curfew,
she's usually in at this hour.

375
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,630
- Do you think something is the matter?

376
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,663
- Oh no no everything's fine.

377
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,313
- Oh!

378
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,263
They're gluten-free.

379
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,153
Try one.

380
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,683
- This, is fantastic.

381
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,433
Are you sure Andy didn't
mention any plans?

382
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,192
- Uh-uh.

383
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,060
- Well if you see her, send her my way,

384
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,310
there's something I want
to discuss with her.

385
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,343
- Okay.

386
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:55,737
(brooding music)

387
00:28:55,737 --> 00:28:57,834
(mumbling)

388
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:58,667
- It felt good.

389
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:01,632
- I had a feeling it would.

390
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:05,562
- You got all the answers don't you?

391
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:10,562
- No.

392
00:29:11,644 --> 00:29:13,044
- You have very pretty eyes.

393
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:18,413
- (chuckles) Come on.

394
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:22,410
- What?
- I have really pretty eyes?

395
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,243
- Yeah.

396
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,730
You don't think so?

397
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,920
- I mean, who says that?

398
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,753
- I do.

399
00:29:30,194 --> 00:29:31,994
You don't think you got pretty eyes?

400
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,564
- I'm not, I don't know.

401
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:41,032
- Come on, you say that, but you do know.

402
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,970
Everyone says that, I don't know.

403
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,803
You know.

404
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:49,144
- What color are they?

405
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,893
- Black.

406
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,403
Grey.

407
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:02,009
I thought they were blue
at first but they're not,

408
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,092
they're grey.

409
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,200
My mom's got them, green eyes.

410
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:14,083
- Your mom?

411
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,266
You think I look like your mom?

412
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:18,099
- No.

413
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:34,385
- Much better.

414
00:30:47,384 --> 00:30:48,738
- Listen to music?

415
00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:49,571
- Uh-hmm.

416
00:30:51,355 --> 00:30:52,188
Yeah.

417
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:11,991
- (mumbles), I want to go to the city.

418
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:15,602
(brooding music)

419
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:43,626
(intense emotional music)

420
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,780
(cacophonous dramatic music)

421
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,310
(mumbling)

422
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:46,321
- [Andy] Right now, I wish I was a bird.

423
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:50,207
- [Policeman] Ma'am?

424
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:51,681
Ma'am?

425
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:54,431
(feverish music)

426
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,593
- Hey.

427
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:01,066
Hey.

428
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:02,983
Hey, pretty green eyes.

429
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,079
You okay?

430
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:15,109
- Yeah, (mumbles).
(cacophonous dramatic music)

431
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:05,153
(Andrea panting)

432
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:08,403
(tense brooding music)

433
00:35:46,796 --> 00:35:50,046
(tense brooding music)

434
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,712
- What are you doing?

435
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:43,132
This is private!

436
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:44,950
What are you doing going through this?

437
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,780
What did you see, huh?

438
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,687
- I was just trying to find you...

439
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:49,810
- You were just trying to find me

440
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,462
going through my stuff?

441
00:36:51,462 --> 00:36:54,000
(Andrea panting)

442
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,653
Ah, fuck!

443
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,167
- Did you lose your dad in 9/11?

444
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:24,020
- This is my favorite photo of him.

445
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,270
He had such a good smile.

446
00:37:26,793 --> 00:37:30,460
(hauntingly poignant music)

447
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,920
My brother's speaking at the
10-year memorial, in two days.

448
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,370
My whole family's going down.

449
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,623
People are literally leaving the city,

450
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,490
and we're taking the early morning car in.

451
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:00,824
It's twisted.

452
00:38:05,036 --> 00:38:08,869
- It must have taken a
lot for him to do that.

453
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:11,510
- Whatever.

454
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,478
It doesn't matter I'm...

455
00:38:13,478 --> 00:38:14,645
I'm not going.

456
00:38:17,142 --> 00:38:18,138
- What do you mean you're not going?

457
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:19,423
- I'm not going, so...

458
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,204
- Don't you think your
brother would like some,

459
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:25,070
I don't know some support?

460
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,580
- I don't need to explain myself to you.

461
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,470
- If I was him I would just, I would want,

462
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,610
I would want you there.
- Crowds okay?

463
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,410
They make me nervous.

464
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,523
- Crowds.
- Uh-hmm.

465
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,680
- Fine let's go down there now.

466
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,317
Let's go down, come on,
there's no one there right now.

467
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:42,991
- No, what, are you listening
to anything that I just said?

468
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:45,074
- Yeah I listened to you.

469
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,210
I don't think that's the reason.

470
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,547
When was the last time
you came into the city?

471
00:38:58,674 --> 00:38:59,507
Andy...

472
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,493
You made it this far.

473
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:13,253
- (sighs) There is no way,
I am going down there.

474
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,313
You don't know what this is like.

475
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,880
This isn't like throwing bricks at some

476
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,753
stupid fucking building, okay?

477
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:26,172
You don't understand.

478
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:30,688
- I don't understand.

479
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:33,438
(brooding music)

480
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:59,944
When I was in jail, my mom died of cancer.

481
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,340
I didn't get to say goodbye.

482
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,903
Do you trust me?

483
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:32,187
(haunting ethereal music)

484
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:15,006
(poignant string music)

485
00:43:18,038 --> 00:43:21,540
- [Andy] So, what were you
thinking taking me here?

486
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,300
- [Jim] I had this crazy idea I was gonna

487
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,100
cross the water, make
a wish for this girl.

488
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,369
- Oh, how'd that go.

489
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:31,169
- Not as well as I planned actually.

490
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,473
Someone once told me, you can
throw a penny into the water,

491
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,990
make a wish, actually
let's not call it a wish,

492
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,233
let's call it a bottle, with a message,

493
00:43:48,097 --> 00:43:49,780
for something you want to change,

494
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,433
something you want to put out there.

495
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:56,809
(water splashing)

496
00:44:03,052 --> 00:44:05,030
- You know it's funny.

497
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,563
In a city that is so loud,

498
00:44:07,492 --> 00:44:09,659
it can just get, so quiet.

499
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:13,649
- It is quiet.

500
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:16,812
Fuck!

501
00:44:16,812 --> 00:44:20,034
(laughing)
- Jim (mumbles), stop!

502
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:23,946
- [Jim] (laughs) Why go on, try it!

503
00:44:23,946 --> 00:44:25,779
- Whoo!
- Oh come on,

504
00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:28,400
you can do better than that.

505
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,625
I'll go with you.

506
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,458
- Okay.

507
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:36,545
(both shouting)
(poignant music)

508
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:41,960
(shouting)
(laughing)

509
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,210
(mumbling)

510
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:20,387
Where do you think
people go when they die?

511
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,637
- They're gone.

512
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,780
- Really?

513
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,437
That's what you think?
- I really think that, yeah.

514
00:45:26,437 --> 00:45:27,853
- No.

515
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:32,223
I think they watch us, like
characters on a TV show,

516
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,080
and then, when they want
something to change,

517
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,895
they just jump on our backs
and make us do things.

518
00:45:39,895 --> 00:45:41,361
- Jump on our backs?

519
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:42,970
- Yeah, jump on our backs.

520
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,920
- Interesting theory.

521
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,753
- Uh-hmm.

522
00:45:48,086 --> 00:45:49,370
- If they're on our backs why aren't they

523
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:50,683
doing a better job of it?

524
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:52,970
Why don't they pick up the pen and

525
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,420
write us a letter and tell us they miss us

526
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,137
or they're sorry or something?

527
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,001
There are none.

528
00:46:03,123 --> 00:46:05,023
There's a sketchbook in your bag.

529
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,713
You draw?

530
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,647
- [Andy] Yeah, you know.

531
00:46:12,713 --> 00:46:14,213
- [Jim] Who got you into that?

532
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:20,413
- One night, I was like nine or 10,

533
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,642
I woke up in the middle of the night,

534
00:46:25,642 --> 00:46:27,603
I came downstairs and saw my dad,

535
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:31,613
he was sitting on the
couch, hitting the scotch.

536
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,550
He turned around, I thought
he was gonna scream at me.

537
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,753
But he didn't.

538
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:41,720
So I went and I sat next to him,

539
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,103
he was sketching in his note pad.

540
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:52,083
So anyway, I guess, I
started drawing again.

541
00:46:59,070 --> 00:46:59,970
- Let me see them.

542
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,420
- No.
- Come on, show me

543
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,333
your favorite one!

544
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,213
Please?

545
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,190
- You have to promise
not to make fun of me.

546
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,023
- Never.

547
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,163
- Promise.

548
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:31,671
Aw, okay, this one.

549
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,033
That's Roland, she's a, she's,

550
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:41,603
just this lady that I know.

551
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,260
I caught her one day and she was

552
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,923
standing in front of this window.

553
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,763
She just looked so sad.

554
00:47:51,185 --> 00:47:53,043
I mean you can see it, in her eyes.

555
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:56,793
- You're really good at it.

556
00:47:59,882 --> 00:48:00,799
- No, no...

557
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,316
It's just a hobby I have.

558
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:07,480
I have no idea what I'm even doing.

559
00:48:09,143 --> 00:48:11,403
- I think you know what you're doing.

560
00:48:17,977 --> 00:48:19,587
Can we go home now please?

561
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,890
- Yeah, we can.

562
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:27,601
(pleasant music)

563
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,683
- (mumbles) jacket.
- Okay, deal.

564
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:32,170
(eerie whispering)

565
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:39,735
(brooding music)
(eerie whispering)

566
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:04,207
(forlorn music)
(metallic clacking)

567
00:50:13,669 --> 00:50:16,077
- [Jim] We gonna talk about this?

568
00:50:16,077 --> 00:50:17,160
- About what?

569
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:19,525
- The scars on your wrist.

570
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:22,190
(sighing)

571
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,453
- Not much to talk about.

572
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,427
- What happened?

573
00:50:26,427 --> 00:50:28,160
- I don't want to talk about it.

574
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,210
- You don't trust me?

575
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,223
- I don't want to get into it okay?

576
00:50:34,403 --> 00:50:35,653
- You try and kill yourself?

577
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,267
Is that why, is that why you

578
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:42,553
you're in sober living?

579
00:50:45,367 --> 00:50:46,770
- How the hell did you know about that?

580
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:49,250
- You had your ID in your backpack.

581
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,083
How long's this been going on?

582
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:52,300
- Oh my god with all the questions!

583
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,985
Don't you think we've had
enough drama for one night?

584
00:50:53,985 --> 00:50:54,850
- You tried to kill yourself!

585
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,670
- No I didn't try to kill myself!

586
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,560
Why does everyone keep saying that?

587
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,380
You know, you're were lying
down on tracks earlier

588
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,213
with a train coming at you!

589
00:51:01,213 --> 00:51:02,640
- All right stop!

590
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,008
- Stop what?
- Stop putting this on me!

591
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:06,830
- Well I don't want to talk about it okay!

592
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:07,663
- So that's it!

593
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,483
This whole night!

594
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:14,430
You're a hypocrite!

595
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:15,950
- I'm a hypocrite?
- Yeah you're a hypocrite!

596
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,070
- How am I a hypocrite?

597
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,820
If it wasn't for me
you'd be dead right now!

598
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,070
- Oh wait let's get one thing straight!

599
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,623
I pulled you off those tracks.

600
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,120
You sat down next to me,

601
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,520
when that train came you
didn't move a muscle.

602
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,730
I pulled you off.

603
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,660
So if it wasn't for me, you
would be dead right now.

604
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,550
- That's me, I'm fucked up!

605
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,880
- You're not fucked up, you're beautiful!

606
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,870
- I will hurt you I promise you!

607
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,317
I will hurt you, I hurt
everybody around me

608
00:51:39,317 --> 00:51:41,260
that is just what I do!

609
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,340
- Okay, I don't care.

610
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,457
- You don't care?
- I don't care!

611
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:45,371
- You don't care?
- No.

612
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:48,060
- What are you thinking,
because you mom died,

613
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,833
we have something in common?

614
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,399
Because we don't!

615
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:55,899
(tense music)

616
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,087
- We don't.

617
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:03,803
You know,

618
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:08,995
you're not gonna be okay Andy.

619
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:14,530
You're a victim, is that
what you want to hear?

620
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,780
Go on, why do you want to be alone,

621
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,323
scared the rest of your life?

622
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:22,944
Here you spent all this time
trying to figure everyone out,

623
00:52:22,944 --> 00:52:24,594
you don't even know yourself yet!

624
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,660
So when you go home take
a good look in the mirror

625
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,610
and see what I see.

626
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:32,015
A scared little fucking girl.

627
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:58,730
- [Andy] The thing is,
with fear, you can only

628
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:02,840
run away from it for so
long, until it stares

629
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,393
you right back in the face.

630
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,250
- House rules are posted by my desk,

631
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,523
look over those once
you've gotten settled.

632
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:19,173
Here it is, there's a closet
over there, and your dresser.

633
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:22,270
Your mom sent you a box of things,

634
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:25,123
feel free to decorate the
room any way that you want.

635
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,020
Now Andy, Andrea this is unacceptable.

636
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,580
- Those are prescription, you can't,

637
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,010
you can't take those away from me.

638
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:39,310
- Yeah this is a drug-free facility,

639
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,260
I'm gonna need you to open up your bag.

640
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,570
Now I'm not gonna ask you again.

641
00:53:55,386 --> 00:53:56,219
Okay...

642
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,680
- Oh, okay you cannot take
those, those are my art supplies,

643
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,240
you can't take those away from me!

644
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,700
- These are sharp objects,
they could hurt you

645
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,780
or one of the other girls.

646
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,700
- Fuck you, fuck this place!

647
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,330
- Hey I don't take well
to piss-poor attitudes!

648
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:24,330
Your bad decisions got
you in here, not me!

649
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,590
I am on your side, but
the only person that can

650
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,570
get you out of here is you!

651
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:32,633
You got that?

652
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,993
I want to see you
downstairs in 30 minutes.

653
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,180
- Well I'm not the one who's fucked up!

654
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,323
- You wanna bet?

655
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:50,955
- Bitch.
- Downstairs in 30 minutes.

656
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,455

- Dad what are you still doing up, huh?

674
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,720
Go to bed.
- Go to bed?

675
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,770
I've been up all night worrying about you!

676
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,210
- Well I'm back now so everything's okay.

677
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,340
- Where were you?

678
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,723
- I just went for a walk.

679
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,053
- What is going on?

680
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,240
Jim!
- Dad, just give me a break!

681
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,630
- You've been walking around this house

682
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:25,850
like a god damned zombie for a week.

683
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,780
Talk to me!
- What do you want to hear?

684
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,540
- [Dad] (stammers) What,
what's bothering you!

685
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,023
- This isn't easy Dad!

686
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:37,690
- Listen to me Jim, talk
to me, just tell me,

687
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,600
tell me what's going on here.

688
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,629
- I just, I just want to find (mumbles)...

689
00:57:41,629 --> 00:57:44,640
- Don't worry about that,
just tell me what's going on!

690
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,840
If you don't tell me what's
bothering you I can't help you!

691
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,980
I am trying--
- Dad stop trying

692
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,233
to be like Mom!

693
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:02,928
(poignant music)

694
00:58:10,197 --> 00:58:15,197
I'm sorry...

(birds chirping)

698
01:00:47,588 --> 01:00:48,936
Morning.

699
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,654
- What is he doing?
- Nice day, can I go in here?

700
01:00:50,654 --> 01:00:51,487
- Excuse me, you
- Is Andy in here?

701
01:00:51,487 --> 01:00:53,150
- can't go in there, you can't go in!

702
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,183
- Roland, see, no-no boys allowed!

703
01:00:55,183 --> 01:00:56,016
- Well hey,
- What are you doing?

704
01:00:56,016 --> 01:00:56,849
- I like your sweater.
- Okay, no!

705
01:00:56,849 --> 01:00:58,230
- Uh, I'm looking for--
- No no no, no!

706
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,330
Sh, you have already

707
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,163
said enough!
- Whoa whoa whoa

708
01:01:00,163 --> 01:01:01,080
what are you doing?
- I am calling the cops!

709
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,272
- No no don't call the cops!

710
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:03,480
- You are trespassing!
- Andy!

711
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,360
- Lower you voice, I will call the cops if

712
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,230
you do not explain yourself right now!

713
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:09,622
This is an all-girls
- I get it.

714
01:01:09,622 --> 01:01:11,170
- facility, there are no boys

715
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,580
allowed on the grounds!
- Okay, sorry!

716
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,660
I'm just looking for Andy, see!

717
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,920
- She is not available,
is there a message you

718
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,040
would like her to hear?
- A message, yes,

719
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,010
that's a great idea!

720
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:22,100
Okay, so first of all, I
was with Andy last night

721
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,350
so please don't get mad at her,
because it was all my fault!

722
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,300
She was just trying to help me.

723
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,330
I just wanted her to know that,

724
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:29,380
I wouldn't trade last night

725
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,350
for anything in the world.

726
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,750
I just want you to tell her.

727
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:37,563
Listen, can you just, give her that.

728
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:39,883
Please.

729
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:45,643
- Okay.
- Yeah.

730
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:49,243
- Go now.
- Okay, okay I'm going.

731
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,933
You promise though?
- I'll think about it.

732
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,463
Please leave.
- Okay.

733
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,373
- This came for you.

734
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:37,053
You really haven't had any
slip-ups while you've been here.

735
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:42,100
Minus the rumor I heard
that you may have been

736
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,950
smoking marijuana in the back.

737
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,720
- Shit (mumbles).
- Now you need to watch

738
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,580
that profanity.

739
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,240
- Sorry.
- And this would be

740
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,100
the first time you have missed curfew.

741
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,500
- I just lost track of time.

742
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,750
- I spoke to Mr. Moretti
today from your job.

743
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,340
He called me actually.

744
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:06,110
He wanted me to understand
how much he's enjoyed

745
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:07,370
having you work there.

746
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:11,980
He thought it was important
that I know about your progress.

747
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,023
- Mr. Moretti's a great
guy, it's a good job.

748
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:19,810
- Listen Andy, I know this is a hard week

749
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:22,100
for you coming up and
I don't want to have to

750
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:26,230
punish you for missing curfew.

751
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,400
I didn't even tell you mother

752
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,030
when she called--
- You spoke to my mom?

753
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:31,140
- Yeah she called this morning.

754
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,720
She wanted me to tell
you that if you don't

755
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,290
feel comfortable going to
the 9/11 memorial tomorrow,

756
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,083
then you don't have to go.

757
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,093
- She said that?
- She said that.

758
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,073
Can I give you some advice?

759
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,730
- Okay.
- Even if she isn't

760
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:57,763
making you go, I think
it would be good for you.

761
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,673
Obviously it's your choice.

762
01:04:05,697 --> 01:04:08,430
(brooding music)

763
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:09,630
- [Jim] Do you trust me?

764
01:04:21,497 --> 01:04:26,173
- Um, if I decide that I want to go,

765
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,450
could somebody give me a ride home?

766
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:34,465
- Ah, I think we could work something out.

767
01:04:45,526 --> 01:04:49,026
(brooding haunting music)

768
01:05:10,161 --> 01:05:13,078
(faint whispering)

769
01:05:51,754 --> 01:05:54,378
(mumbling)

770
01:05:54,378 --> 01:05:57,378
- [Andy] I have only slipped away...

771
01:06:13,415 --> 01:06:15,832
(whispering)

772
01:07:10,106 --> 01:07:14,939
(weeping)
(forlorn music)

773
01:07:21,652 --> 01:07:26,652
(faint chattering)
(medical monitor beeping)

774
01:07:52,977 --> 01:07:54,072
- [Woman] (mumbles) we had to pump

775
01:07:54,072 --> 01:07:58,123
her stomach out, (mumbles)...

776
01:07:58,123 --> 01:08:00,956
(sorrowful music)

777
01:08:07,218 --> 01:08:09,468
(mumbling)

778
01:08:15,448 --> 01:08:16,865
- I'm so sorry...

779
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:46,075
Is that what you're going to wear?

780
01:08:46,075 --> 01:08:48,773
- (chuckles) I'm not sure I don't,

781
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,573
really have anything else.

782
01:08:57,162 --> 01:09:02,162
- Oh I have just the thing.

783
01:09:16,261 --> 01:09:19,178
- (sighs) Well, a...

784
01:09:19,178 --> 01:09:21,910
- (stammers) I bought it for
you, I was gonna take it back

785
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,437
because I didn't know if
you would like it or not,

786
01:09:23,437 --> 01:09:24,477
I don't wanns, you know,

787
01:09:24,477 --> 01:09:26,893
- No, mom, mom, mom!
- get in your, face.

788
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,840
- Thank you.
- Do you want to

789
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,673
wear it today?

790
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,890
- Yeah, I want to wear it.

791
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:39,390
(tense music)

792
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:44,580
- Go try it on.

793
01:09:46,639 --> 01:09:49,090
(sighing)

794
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:50,090
- Yes, okay.

795
01:10:01,418 --> 01:10:05,001
- Thank you Jesus (sighs).

796
01:10:09,446 --> 01:10:12,696
(brooding tense music)

797
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:18,583
- [Andy] I uh, found something, recently,

798
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:23,737
and I wanted to read it,
to all of you, today.

799
01:10:30,078 --> 01:10:32,578
(tense music)

800
01:10:53,038 --> 01:10:56,094
- What is that?
- It's a birthcam.

801
01:10:56,094 --> 01:10:59,261
I'm gonna document the whole memorial.

802
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,482
- [Andy] She's letting you do that?

803
01:11:02,482 --> 01:11:04,366
- Well she said, whatever you need to

804
01:11:04,366 --> 01:11:07,624
keep this day from sucking, be my guest!

805
01:11:07,624 --> 01:11:08,457
- Huh.

806
01:11:14,986 --> 01:11:19,986
(mumbles) bro.
- Thanks, (mumbles).

807
01:11:34,162 --> 01:11:35,745
- Look, sun coming.

808
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:51,950
(mumbling)
(tense cacophonous music)

809
01:12:27,329 --> 01:12:29,746
Actually it's nothing at all.

810
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,207
I have only slipped away,
into the next (mumbles) room.

811
01:12:41,552 --> 01:12:46,552
Whenever we (mumbles) to
each other, (mumbles).

812
01:12:52,359 --> 01:12:56,430
Call me and (mumbles).

813
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:59,313
- [Man] Speak to me in the
easy way which you always used.

814
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:03,523
Laugh as we always laughed together.

815
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:12,870
Play, smile, think of me.
(eerie haunting music)

816
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:14,850
Pray for me.

817
01:13:21,677 --> 01:13:23,700
Let my name be the very household word

818
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,823
that it always was.

819
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,157
Let it be spoken without effect,

820
01:13:33,097 --> 01:13:34,897
without the ghost of a shadow in it.

821
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,733
Life means all that it ever meant.

822
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:46,283
(poignant music)
Is the same as it ever was.

823
01:13:50,169 --> 01:13:52,983
There is absolute, unbroken continuity.

824
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,713
What is death, but a (mumbles) accident.

825
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:07,600
Why should I be out of mind,

826
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,850
because I'm out of sight?

827
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,760
I am but waiting for you,

828
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,323
for an interval, somewhere very near,

829
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,350
just around the corner.

830
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,503
All is well.

831
01:14:25,273 --> 01:14:26,193
Nothing is past.

832
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,733
Nothing is lost.

833
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:34,314
- [Announcer] The first
memorial that we've seen,

834
01:14:34,314 --> 01:14:35,847
for the first time this morning by

835
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:39,050
the families of (mumbles)...

836
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:43,568
It is striking, how much
creativity is involved in this,

837
01:14:43,568 --> 01:14:46,420
has gone into producing this memorial.

838
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,557
- [Announcer] And it (mumbles)...

839
01:14:47,557 --> 01:14:50,063
- It's hard to believe it's been 10 years.

840
01:14:55,797 --> 01:14:57,680
They got all those streets blocked off,

841
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,523
the security must be intense down there.

842
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:10,708
I can't imagine what those
families are going through.

843
01:15:13,547 --> 01:15:14,380
- I know.

844
01:15:17,517 --> 01:15:18,815
- [Announcer] Her best
friend was working on the

845
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:21,538
96th floor of the (mumbles)
tower, when it was hit

846
01:15:21,538 --> 01:15:23,233
by Flight 11.

847
01:15:23,233 --> 01:15:26,395
Andrea's father, was also (mumbles)...

848
01:15:26,395 --> 01:15:29,133
(chuckling)

849
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:30,050
- Ah, ah...

850
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,270
- [Man] One brief moment, and all will be

851
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,970
- [Man And Andy] as it was before.

852
01:15:38,483 --> 01:15:39,533
- [Andy] Only better.

853
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,373
Infinitely happier.

854
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,435
And forever.

855
01:15:47,435 --> 01:15:49,852
(chattering)

856
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:56,410
- No no, no the other way, there,

857
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,800
there you go (mumbles)...
- We will all be one,

858
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,633
together.

859
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,083
You also used to say,

860
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,850
that birds don't have as
good a memory as humans.

861
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:31,515
I'm glad I can remember.

862
01:16:31,515 --> 01:16:33,083
I'm glad I can remember you.

863
01:16:35,177 --> 01:16:38,177

864
01:16:59,285 --> 01:17:02,035
