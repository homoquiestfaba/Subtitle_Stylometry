00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:13,298
You're the only one
in the world

539
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,031
to have a newly born clutch
of rare whooping snakes.

540
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,532
(snakes whooping)

541
00:29:17,534 --> 00:29:19,998
- Down, down, down!
- (Dr. Zara gasps)

542
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,265
Go in your hole,
you weird snakes.

543
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:25,065
Sir, please.

544
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,465
These creatures
are to be respected.

545
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,132
(snakes groan)

546
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,399
Hmm.

547
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,198
They would make a lovely belt.

548
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,031
Mr. Burnish,
they are one of a kind.

549
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:36,298
A one-of-a-kind whooping belt.

550
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,365
A belt that goes "whoop."
Do I want that?

551
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:39,998
I don't know.

552
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,165
(sighs)

553
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:44,065
Take them away.

554
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,298
Wait, how many snakes
are there supposed to be?

555
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,065
Uh, why?

556
00:29:48,067 --> 00:29:50,265
(whoops)

557
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:52,499
We promised the public a yeti,

558
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:55,165
and nothing else will do.
Nothing!

559
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:58,298
I don't care if the yeti
is dead or alive.

560
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,298
I just need him.

561
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,432
(squeaks)

562
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:03,298
Your gerbil is freaking me out.

563
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,998
Jerboa.
Duchess is an albino jerboa,

564
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,998
and she, too, is one of a kind.

565
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,499
Sir, as a zoologist,
it is my mission in life

566
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:14,732
to make sure that all animals
are protected,

567
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:17,031
especially the rare
and exotic ones.

568
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:20,165
That is the only reason
I agreed to find your yeti.

569
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,465
And you did.

570
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:25,298
For a few short days,
we had one,

571
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,298
but I cannot go
to that unveiling empty-handed.

572
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,298
(sighs) I will not be made
into a laughingstock again.

573
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,432
Not, not, not, not, not!

574
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,499
Uh, there's news, Mr. Burnish.

575
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,165
News about you leaving?

576
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:41,165
A dockworker saw
a creature and some kids

577
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:43,165
boarding a cargo barge
last night.

578
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:46,165
Dr. Zara, you are the best
in your field.

579
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,198
Please, help me get him back.

580
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,198
Under one condition.

581
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,432
We bring the yeti back alive.

582
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:56,399
You have to promise me
he will not be harmed.

583
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,532
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

584
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:00,532
Captain, where did
that boat land?

585
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:02,031
Uh...

586
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:03,432
JIN:
Yeah, Ma.

587
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:06,298
Uh, Beijing is, um... is great.

588
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,132
And the dorms...
the dorms are clean.

589
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,532
Peng? Oh, Peng is, uh...

590
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,332
Look at all those teeth.

591
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:13,965
Peng's fine.

592
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:15,198
Hey, hey.

593
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,265
Oh, and Yi came, too.

594
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:18,998
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

595
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,965
She's, uh... she's checking out
the university.

596
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,399
Soda?

597
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:24,198
Oh, yeah!

598
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,998
Mom never lets me have any.

599
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,232
(gulping)

600
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:28,234
Catch!

601
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:32,432
(gasps)

602
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:35,165
(both laughing hysterically)

603
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,298
Hey, Everest, come over here.

604
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,031
How long will we be here?

605
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:40,232
(belches loudly)

606
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:42,265
(chuckles):
Oh, uh, excuse me.

607
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,165
Cafeteria food
is a little rich.

608
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,165
Well, I got to go, Ma. Bye.

609
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:49,532
I cannot believe that
you made me lie to my mother.

610
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:51,499
(giggling):
I love this stuff!

611
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,031
(chuckles)

612
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:55,165
Hey, okay. Everest, look.

613
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:59,031
First, you go over
the Yellow Mountain.

614
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:01,432
Then to the Yangtze River.

615
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:04,031
And that river will take you
most of the way

616
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:08,165
to the Himalayas,
and finally to Mount Everest.

617
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,165
This is how
you're going to get home.

618
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:11,432
Whoa, wait.
(chuckles)

619
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:13,031
Mount Everest?
No, no, no.

620
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,499
That has to be
hundreds of miles away.

621
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,165
(giggles):
Actually, it's thousands.

622
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,499
(whoops, laughs)

623
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:20,000
I just hope he can make it
all that way.

624
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,298
(grunting, whimpering)

625
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,365
He, um... he seems capable.

626
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:29,265
- (ship horn droning)
- (birds chirping)

627
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:32,432
- Look at all those people.
- (horn blares)

628
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:34,298
- Hello!
- Peng, get down!

629
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,031
PENG:
Ow!

630
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,298
(Everest grunts)

631
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,165
Yeah, we should hide.

632
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:42,100
(machinery whirring)

633
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,365
(Jin, Peng, Yi
and Everest yelp)

634
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:55,132
Wait. Why are we still moving?

635
00:32:55,134 --> 00:32:56,241
YI:
Uh...

636
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:57,607
'cause we're not
at the dock anymore.

637
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,240
JIN:
What? (yells)

638
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,040
- No!
- (soda can pops open)

639
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:04,042
(birds chirping)

640
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:11,073
YI: You know, I've never
been out of the city.

641
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:13,173
Wow. I can't believe
how beautiful

642
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:15,007
- it is out here.
- (soda can pops open)

643
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:17,374
I can't believe
I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

644
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:19,107
I'm starving.

645
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:20,109
(camera clicks)

646
00:33:21,142 --> 00:33:22,440
Uh-oh.

647
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:24,407
Guys, I got to go.

648
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:26,173
Just hold it.

649
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:28,440
(gasps, whimpers)

650
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:30,607
- Oh, no. He's got to go.
- (Everest groans)

651
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:33,040
- JIN: Get me out of here!
- PENG: (yelps) I can't.

652
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:35,440
(panicked grunting and yelling)

653
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:37,240
Out of my way!

654
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:39,040
Got to go! Got to go!

655
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:41,042
(groans) My head.

656
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,407
- I'm good.
- Okay.

657
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:44,906
Come on.

658
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:46,973
- Come on, come on, come on.
- (phone dings)

659
00:33:46,975 --> 00:33:49,073
One bar.
Okay, that's good enough.

660
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:51,107
- Good enough for what?
- To buy tickets home.

661
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:53,340
Okay, look, the next boat
leaves around 5:00,

662
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:55,007
so let's hope
that's enough time

663
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:56,906
to find our way back
to the dock.

664
00:33:56,908 --> 00:33:58,873
- Peng, come on. We're leaving.
- (birds chirping)

665
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,440
Yes, waiter.
I'm ready to order.

666
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:04,107
I'll have some of Nai Nai's
pork buns with extra pork.

667
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:06,207
All right, get up, Peng.
We got to go.

668
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,173
And a side of pork.

669
00:34:08,175 --> 00:34:10,175
(stomach gurgling)

670
00:34:13,242 --> 00:34:15,873
(deep musical humming)

671
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,840
(wind whistling softly)

672
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:19,407
(quiet jingling)

673
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:21,073
Is he...
Why is he making that...

674
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:23,274
- Shh, shh, shh. Jin.
- Is he humming?

675
00:34:23,276 --> 00:34:26,040
(humming continues)

676
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:28,040
What's going on?

677
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,607
Whoa.

678
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,173
(chuckles)

679
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:34,173
- (humming continues)
- (wind whistling)

680
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:35,840
What is happening?

681
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:39,040
- Whoa. Is that a...
- (blueberries popping)

682
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:41,009
A blueberry?

683
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,207
(grunts, munches loudly)

684
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,175
Food!

685
00:34:50,242 --> 00:34:52,207
(munching, slurping)

686
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:53,840
Guys, these are delicious.

687
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,840
That doesn't make any sense.

688
00:34:55,842 --> 00:34:58,207
No, no, this is not possible.

689
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,107
(laughter)

690
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:01,307
It's not funny, all right?

691
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:02,906
This is cashmere!

692
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:05,073
- Uh, Jin?
- (rumbling)

693
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:06,274
(gasps)

694
00:35:06,276 --> 00:35:07,940
JIN:
Now what?

695
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:09,440
Oh.

696
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:13,140
Everest, do something.

697
00:35:13,142 --> 00:35:15,873
- (Everest yelling)
- (blueberries creaking)

698
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,873
Run!

699
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,175
(Peng screaming)

700
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:22,040
Incoming!

701
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:24,374
(blueberries whistling
through air)

702
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:28,040
- Run!
- Go faster!

703
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,040
(distorted groan)

704
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:32,407
Oh, no!

705
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:36,274
Save yourselves!

706
00:35:36,276 --> 00:35:38,340
(screams)

707
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:39,873
(grunts) I'm hit!

708
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,040
Tell Nai Nai's pork buns
I love them.

709
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:44,042
(all screaming)

710
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,107
(splat)

711
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:49,973
(insects chirping)

712
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:52,808
(panting, groaning)

713
00:35:54,175 --> 00:35:56,040
(Everest groaning)

714
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,407
(Peng giggling)

715
00:35:57,409 --> 00:36:00,209
Hey, Jin, did you get
enough to eat?

716
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,607
Let's just say I've got
blueberries in places

717
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:07,207
- where blueberries should never be.
- (Peng giggles)

718
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:09,340
(blueberries squeaking)

719
00:36:09,342 --> 00:36:11,340
- Come on, Everest.
- (Everest grunts)

720
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:13,173
Okay.

721
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:16,840
- Watch and learn.
- (Everest grunts)

722
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,140
Bank shot.

723
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:21,309
- (yelps)
- (Everest laughing)

724
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:25,107
- YI: I'm exhausted.
- JIN: What?

725
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:26,906
Why are you stopping?

726
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:29,240
Because, in about five minutes,
we won't be able to see

727
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:31,040
our hands
in front of our faces.

728
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:33,440
And that is exactly why
we've got to keep moving.

729
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:35,040
All right?
Come on, Peng.

730
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:37,040
We need to get back
to that dock.

731
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:39,073
(night birds hooting)

732
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:40,407
- First thing in the morning.
- (insects buzzing)

733
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:41,775
Yes!

734
00:36:46,175 --> 00:36:47,906
(grunts)

735
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:49,407
There's so many.

736
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:51,274
- JIN: Bugs?
- YI: Stars.

737
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:54,173
(groans) How come
they're only swarming me?

738
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:55,906
Maybe they're ladybugs.

739
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:57,407
(chuckles):
Lady... Not funny.

740
00:36:57,409 --> 00:36:59,906
Well, my mom told me
that the stars

741
00:36:59,908 --> 00:37:02,040
are our ancestors
who always watch over us.

742
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:04,040
- (Everest grunts playfully)
- (Yi chuckles)

743
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:05,906
My mom says that, too.

744
00:37:05,908 --> 00:37:07,873
- My backpack?
- (Peng laughing)

745
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,040
- Peng!
- (roaring)

746
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:12,906
- (Peng laughs, roars)
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

747
00:37:12,908 --> 00:37:14,973
- Great. No reception.
- (phone beeps)

748
00:37:14,975 --> 00:37:17,040
I'm entirely cut off
from my social life.

749
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:18,340
Mm. How traumatic.

750
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:20,040
Yeah, Yi, it is.

751
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:22,307
Because, unlike you,
I like having friends.

752
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:24,873
- I'm not some kind of a-a...
- Loner?

753
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,307
Is that what
you were gonna say?

754
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:31,207
Well, for your info,
I'm a self-proclaimed loner.

755
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:32,906
There's a difference, okay?

756
00:37:32,908 --> 00:37:34,140
Fine, because in the morning,

757
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:36,307
Peng and I are headed back
to the city.

758
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:38,340
- I-I can't leave him.
- Yi.

759
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:40,407
You've seen what he can do.

760
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:42,906
He's-he's amazing.

761
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:45,240
He's... he's magical.

762
00:37:45,242 --> 00:37:47,374
Oh, so now he's a magical yeti.

763
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:49,440
Do you realize
how crazy you sound?

764
00:37:49,442 --> 00:37:52,040
Look what happened
with the blueberries.

765
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,307
That wasn't him.
That was a natural phenomenon.

766
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:57,140
Just one that
I can't explain yet.

767
00:37:57,142 --> 00:38:00,906
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

768
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:02,173
Go! (chuckles)

769
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:04,207
(Peng chuckling)

770
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:06,007
(Everest laughs)

771
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:08,107
Hey, you cheated!

772
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:10,440
(both grunting)

773
00:38:10,442 --> 00:38:13,173
- (laughing)
- (Peng hollers)

774
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:15,973
(both laughing)

775
00:38:15,975 --> 00:38:19,240
Will you two please
just give it a rest!

776
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:21,906
Oh, my gosh, I'm beginning
to sound like my parents.

777
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:23,873
(gasps) That's it!

778
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:26,040
That's why
they get along so well.

779
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,274
Everest is just a kid.

780
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:30,906
He's probably, like, the same
age as Peng but in yeti years.

781
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,274
Stop hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

782
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:36,274
Right. There's no way
that giant thing is a kid.

783
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:38,007
Wait. I'll prove it to you.

784
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:40,240
Everest, come over here.

785
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:41,607
(grunts)

786
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,109
(Peng grunts, laughs)

787
00:38:44,376 --> 00:38:47,173
This is you.

788
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:48,607
(moans softly)

789
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:52,173
And your parents.

790
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:55,307
Aw. You have
your mother's eyes.

791
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:57,173
(moans sadly)

792
00:38:57,175 --> 00:38:59,340
Don't worry.
I will make sure you get home.

793
00:38:59,342 --> 00:39:01,040
JIN:
What are you gonna do?

794
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:04,073
- Take him all the way back to Mount Everest?
- Maybe I am.

795
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,873
Jin, he needs to get back
to his family.

796
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:09,440
And what about your family?
Don't they need you, too?

797
00:39:09,442 --> 00:39:11,374
(scoffs)
Always busy, never home.

798
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:13,240
What's that all about, Yi?

799
00:39:13,242 --> 00:39:16,040
Don't talk to me about family.

800
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:17,973
You have no idea.

801
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:20,040
No idea.
Your... (sighs)

802
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:22,040
Your life is so easy, Jin.

803
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:24,207
Do you even... do you even
want to be a doctor,

804
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:25,873
or do you just think
that you'll...

805
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,873
I don't know...
you'll look good in white?

806
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,906
All right.
Call me shallow all you want.

807
00:39:30,908 --> 00:39:32,307
At least I'm not delusional.

808
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,276
(Peng and Everest snoring)

809
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,840
I don't care
if you think I'm crazy.

810
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:41,007
(sighs)

811
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:42,309
JIN:
You're impossible.

812
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:59,042
(violin playing
lively classical tune)

813
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:03,207
(snorts)

814
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:04,743
Huh?

815
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:09,175
Is that Yi?

816
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,307
- (twig snaps)
- (both gasp)

817
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:23,207
Wait. Don't stop.
It's really good.

818
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:25,906
Your <i>nai nai</i> said you stopped
playing after your dad died.

819
00:40:25,908 --> 00:40:27,040
Peng!

820
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:29,073
It's okay, Jin. Really.

821
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:31,040
Was this your dad's violin?

822
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,374
Mm-hmm.

823
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:35,873
You know,
I really liked your dad.

824
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,175
Thanks, Peng.

825
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:41,073
Well, we better head out
if we're gonna

826
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:42,407
make it to the Yangtze River.

827
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,240
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

828
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,040
I checked,
and Dahe village has boats

829
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:47,407
leaving for the city
every hour.

830
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:48,873
(sighs)

831
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:50,207
Okay, well, when we get there,

832
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:52,840
you and Peng can take
a boat back, but...

833
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:54,307
I'm going to take Everest home.

834
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:56,906
(Everest grunts softly)

835
00:40:56,908 --> 00:40:59,175
- (ship horn droning)
- (birds squawking)

836
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:05,940
WOMAN: Well, that boat
pulled in yesterday morning,

837
00:41:05,942 --> 00:41:08,173
but we've unloaded all of the
cargo and didn't find anyone.

838
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:12,040
Would you mind
if we search it again?

839
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:14,207
- You got anything?
- No, Captain.

840
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:15,973
He was here?

841
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,307
Yes.

842
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,075
And it looks like
he fancies soda.

843
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:24,209
♪ ♪

844
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,190
Stop!

845
00:42:02,192 --> 00:42:04,457
Down there.

846
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:07,159
- (snake whoops)
- What was that?

847
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,757
Sorry, Doctor.

848
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:11,958
There's no sign
of them anywhere.

849
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:16,123
- (takes deep breath)
- Sir, the yeti has disappeared.

850
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:19,357
It has been so long
since I've been out in nature.

851
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,524
- Sir, if we...
- Look at this tree.

852
00:42:21,526 --> 00:42:24,056
It's a wonderful tree.

853
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:26,090
Look at the colors.

854
00:42:26,092 --> 00:42:28,123
I love this tree.
You there, chop it down

855
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,323
- and put it in a bag, will you?
- Right away, sir.

856
00:42:30,325 --> 00:42:31,990
I want it in my penthouse...

857
00:42:31,992 --> 00:42:34,023
(sniffs)
to be with me.

858
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:36,457
- Mr. Burnish.
- Right. What? What is it?

859
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:39,123
We should divide the team
and cover some ground.

860
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:42,390
- (chain saw buzzing)
- Captain, let us fan out.

861
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:44,390
Yes, sir.

862
00:42:44,392 --> 00:42:46,223
(Everest and Peng giggling)

863
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:48,056
JIN:
Now, on the map, that village

864
00:42:48,058 --> 00:42:49,357
is only, like,
a centimeter away.

865
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,457
That can't be that far.

866
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:53,424
It must just be
on the other side of the...

867
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:55,190
- (gasps)
- (Everest and Peng giggling)

868
00:42:55,192 --> 00:42:56,424
(echoing):
The Yellow Mountain.

869
00:42:56,426 --> 00:42:58,292
(Yi chuckles)

870
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:02,557
- Wow.
- Wait. Wait.

871
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:05,190
We are not going over that.

872
00:43:05,192 --> 00:43:07,424
Come on, Everest.
I'll race you.

873
00:43:07,426 --> 00:43:09,392
- (Peng chuckling)
- (Jin scoffs)

874
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:13,459
(grunting, laughing)

875
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,524
Hey, you guys,
wait right there.

876
00:43:17,526 --> 00:43:19,223
(Everest and Peng laughing)

877
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:21,490
Ooh. Everest, look.

878
00:43:21,492 --> 00:43:23,390
- Make a wish.
- (grunts)

879
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,190
No, no.
They're for wishing.

880
00:43:26,192 --> 00:43:27,524
(Yi groans)

881
00:43:27,526 --> 00:43:29,490
- Leg cramp. Stop for a sec.
- (Jin grunts)

882
00:43:29,492 --> 00:43:32,457
Okay. I mean, if you
really need to. (chuckles)

883
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:34,259
(Jin panting)

884
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:39,090
I wish I was
a basketball superstar.

885
00:43:39,092 --> 00:43:41,524
(Everest grunts)

886
00:43:41,526 --> 00:43:44,190
(echoing): Starting
in the championship game,

887
00:43:44,192 --> 00:43:46,223
the mighty Peng!

888
00:43:46,225 --> 00:43:48,190
(laughing)

889
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,223
- (drone buzzing)
