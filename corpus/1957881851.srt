Sorry.

 Hey, Uncle Guy,

 Naw.
I got things to do.

11

That's when I retire.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,960
Take this home to your
mother, all right?

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,280
 But I'm supposed
to help you close up.

27

 No, it's all right.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,240
Tonight I close up by myself.

that no good Nicky Vetrino were
throwing things from her roof.

- What was that?
- That sounded like a gun.

55

Maybe a car.

 I don't see why
we gotta do this.

easier for us next time.

some piece of ass, man.

370
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,480
I think she digs me.

371
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,520
 I'll be right back.

372
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,400
[music playing]

373
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,920
 And, you know,
I learned when we

374
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,720
were living way down on Grant
Street, in Little Italy--

375
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,600
my mother told me, she said,
make sure you use olive oil

376
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,880
in everything you cook.

377
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,600
But, you see, the
reason I do all this

378
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,200
is because olive oil
is good for everything.

379
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,480
Everything.

380
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,240
It goes down nice
and smooth, the food.

381
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,120
And then when it comes up, it
comes out on your complexion.

382
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
It makes it moist--

383
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,320
and it's attractive
to boot, right?

384
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,240
See?

385
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,640
All right.

386
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,320
Now, in the morning,
remember-- you have to put

387
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,640
a drop of olive
oil in your coffee

388
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,280
with the [non-english speech].

389
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,560
And at night, when you
go to eat the dessert,

390
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:39,120
make sure you have a drop of
olive oil on the ice cream.

391
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,440
Ali.

392
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,720
This is my nephew.

393
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,880
Come on, Al.

394
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,840
Al-- Ali-- come on.

395
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,680
Come in this picture with me.

396
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,160
 Good morning, Alfonso.

397
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,840
 Get that thing off me.

398
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,240
 Hey, Gabriela's
making a movie.

399
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,400
 Yeah, I know all about it.

400
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,640
 We're all going
to be in the movie.

401
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,960
 Not me.

402
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,840
 I'm going to call the
family for Saturday,

403
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,280
and we're all going
to get together.

404
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,680
We're going to get you
all the material you need.

405
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,320
- Aunt Rose--
- I'm going to go call Angie.

406
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,680
 The camera likes you, Alfonso.

407
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,800
 How do you know
my name is Alfonso?

408
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,920
 A little birdie told me.

409
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
 So, what are we
supposed to do?

410
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,880
 Just tell stories
about the old times.

411
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,640
Uncle Guy, you tell
the story about when

412
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,120
you saw Mr. Botzel with a goat.

413
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,360
- What?
- Goat.

414
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,640
The one with the bushy tail.

415
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,800
You remember, you told
him it was a pony?

416
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,360
You remember?

417
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,120
Come on.

418
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,400
 So, uh, you're making
a movie about us?

419
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,360
 No.

420
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,640
It's a movie about Brooklyn.

421
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,480
 It's about families, really.

422
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,040
[inaudible]

423
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Tri Television wants to show
what keeps them together.

424
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,200
 Thanks.

425
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,840
You're talking,
uh-- you're talking

426
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,080
about the old Brooklyn, huh?

427
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,120
I mean, it's all changed.

428
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,680
It's not the same anymore.

429
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,960
 Some things never change.

430
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,360
 OK, so it's different?

431
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,240
How?

432
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,720
What do you remember?

433
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,160
 Well, um--

434
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,480
I remember the time Vinnie
Correlli had this affair

435
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,280
with Mr. Gumali's daughter.

436
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,920
 Yeah, in the
funeral parlor, right?

437
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,240
 Right.

438
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,880
 And he took the
dead guy's pants

439
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,080
by mistake because they were
doing it in the dressing room,

440
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,440
right?

441
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,920
And then they buried his
pants, and his wallet--

442
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,040
everything in it.

443
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,760
That-- that was pretty funny.

444
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,000
 Yeah, but it wasn't
Vinnie Correlli.

445
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,120
It was Augie Bonacci.

446
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,880
 No, no.
No Augie Bonacci.

447
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,040
 Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

448
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,480
 Augie Bonacci?
He had the brother?

449
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,600
No, the one with the hairlip?

450
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,120
 No, no, that wasn't a hairlip.

451
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,560
That's where his wife hit
him with the genoa salami.

452
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,200
You should have seen this woman.

453
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,480
[non-english speech] I mean,
she was built like Pavarotti.

454
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,320
She had a neck-- remember,
her neck was like-- it

455
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,760
was thicker than my waist.

456
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,160
Ba bum, ba bum, ba bum.

457
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,560
 So, Mr. Parente, you
said it's not the same.

458
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,960
But you still didn't say how.

459
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,120
 One word, honey.

460
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,880
Royalty.

461
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,360
Yeah.

462
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,520
It used to be that the
whole neighborhood was, uh--

463
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,000
one big family.

464
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,680
Everybody knew everybody.

465
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,920
We left our doors open at night,
our wallets on the counter.

466
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,160
 Well, those days are gone.

467
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,360
 Is that camera pointing
at me, or at you?

468
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,800
 Now it's on me.

469
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,600
But it was on you.
- Her eye.

470
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,040
Excuse me.

471
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,240
Her eye is looking at you,
and the camera's at me.

472
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,800
Right?
- Talking to the--

473
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,600
 You looking at me?
I don't know--

474
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,720
[laughter]

475
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,600
 She's getting me nervous.

476
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,520
Who was I say-- oh, yeah.

477
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,880
It used to be that
the whole neighborhood

478
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,560
was one big family.

479
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,160
Everybody knew everybody.

480
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,200
And, uh-- you grew
up in one house.

481
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,440
And most of the time, your
kids would grow up there, too.

482
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,320
And their kids.

483
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,720
We all wanted the same thing.

484
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,880
Good friends, good food--

485
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,880
and, uh-- good, uh--

486
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,360
you know what I mean.

487
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,280
Tell her, guys.

488
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,840
You know I'm right.

489
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,400
And-- oh, hey, and nobody
ever left the neighborhood.

490
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,120
Of course, there
was no reason to.

491
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,560
We had it all here.

492
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,920
We looked out for each other.

493
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,720
Loyalty.

494
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,960
I'm getting nervous.

495
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,320
And I never get nervous.

496
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,360
Anyway, uh-- well, you
know what I'm saying.

497
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,200
Right, Guy?

498
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,600
 Augie Bonacci's wife
used to go into the bakery

499
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,440
and order 2 pounds
of cannolis a day.

500
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,720
Remember that?

501
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,040
Yeah.

502
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,880
She used to make you
carry them home for her.

503
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
 Yeah, I remember.

504
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,120
 Oh, Grandma Stanco's cannolis.

505
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,040
They were the best.

506
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,920
Those were the cannolis.

507
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,840
 Hey, whoa, Rose.

508
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Rose.

509
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,720
Yours weren't too bad, either.

510
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,400
You know, Ali, your
aunt Rose and I,

511
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,000
we shared a cannoli or two on
a couple of those [inaudible]

512
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,440
lazy summer nights.

513
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,400
 Now we know, eh?

514
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,040
 What are you talking about?

515
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,960
Are you kidding me?

516
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,320
Wait, wait just a minute.

517
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,640
They were the best damn
pastries in Brooklyn.

518
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,840
 Stop it, already.

519
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,200
 Shut up.

520
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,440
 Yeah, I remember the
first time I saw Angie.

521
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,680
She was behind the
counter at the bakery.

522
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,240
She was wearing that
cute little white apron.

523
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,800
Lots of baby fat.

524
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,040
 But that was the past.

525
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,800
Past.

526
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,120
We think about the future now.

527
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,360
Right, Guy?

528
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,520
 Al, she's nice.

529
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,880
She'd be good for ya.

530
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,600
- Angie, please.
- Hey, Al.

531
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,520
Ali.

532
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,680
[non-english speech]

533
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,320
 You know, we shouldn't
be telling her all

534
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,000
this stuff about our family.
- Why not?

535
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,360
I like her.

536
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,800
She reminds me of your
mother, when we first

537
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,240
came from the old country.

538
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,440
She's something different, Ali.

539
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,680
 Yeah, but she's not.

540
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,200
She has nothing to
do with our family.

541
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,640
And Danny was right.

542
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,400
Family used to be
about neighborhood.

543
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,800
People you grew up
with were the only ones

544
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,720
you should really trust.

545
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,640
 No, no, no.

546
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,320
I don't-- no.

547
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,200
I trust who I trust, and I don't
care if she lives in my house.

548
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,760
[non-english speech]

549
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,960
 You owe me money, and
I'm giving you more, huh?

550
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,320
I must be [non-english speech].

551
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,360
 Don't worry, Danny.

552
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm-- I'm good for it.
Thanks.

553
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,080
Hey, I got a tax
check coming soon.

554
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
 You'd better get a new line.

555
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
That one's got a hair on it.

556
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,560
 Yeah.

557
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,480
 Uh, Louie, look, if you
really want to pay me back,

558
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,200
I got a proposal for you.

559
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,400
I have some associates, uh, who
need a comfortable little place

560
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,520
to direct their business.

561
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,120
Well, I'd consider
it a favor to me

562
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,920
if you make the bar available.

563
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,360
 You talking about drugs?

564
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,080
 Watch your fucking mouth.

565
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,720
And show some respect.

566
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,240
I'm talking about friends.

567
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,600
Friends, Louie.

568
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,720
 Danny, I can't.

569
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,120
I mean, this--
this place is my--

570
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,880
 Give me a 77.
Come on.

571
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,320
 I love these windows.

572
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,520
Remember when Jeannie
Papsadel lived next door?

573
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,640
We used to look
up her dress when

574
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,080
she was waiting for the bus.

575
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,640
 Polka dot panties.

576
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,200
 And little curly blonde
hairs on the fringe.

577
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,160
 20 years ago, bro.

578
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,480
 I got a photographic memory.

579
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,800
 Yeah, more like pornographic.

580
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,480
- Hey, that's good, too.
- How's this shirt?

581
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,440
Is it good?
Is this--

582
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,560
 Yeah-- it's out of fashion.

583
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,480
Sure, it looks great.

584
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,400
Hey, check this out, man.

585
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,240
 What?

586
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,240
 Oh, is that the
girl from upstairs?

587
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,280
AL: Gabriela.

588
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,520
 Gabriela?

589
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
Sounds like a high
class guinea to me.

590
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,640
 Yeah, well, she's
weird is all I know.

591
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,760
 Don't matter, bro.

592
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
You gotta jump on
that shit, man.

593
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,200
That's prime cut, baby.

594
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,360
If you don't, I will.
- Come on.

595
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,120
Let's go.

596
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,080
 Piece of ass, man.

597
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,920
That's the last of the minks.
Let's go.

598
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,040
Come on.
- Hold on.

599
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,200
What are you doing?

600
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,720
Let 'em finish up.

601
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,600
They'll go inside, they'll
sign off with the foreman,

602
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,240
and we'll grab 'em.

603
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,640
 I ain't waiting around here
for another fucking hour, bro.

604
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,840
 Hey-- oh, you're an idiot.

605
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,720
You're a regular freaking idiot.

606
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,080
 Nobody argues with
a fucking gun, man.

607
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,720
 Yeah, except someone
with a bigger one.

608
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,120
 What, do you
mean like this one?

609
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,440
[gun cocking]
- Jesus Christ.

610
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,720
What, are you fucking--
- Relax.

611
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,440
Relax.
Hey.

612
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,600
Hey.

613
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,880
We gotta stick together.
You hear me?

614
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,960
I look out for you,
you look out for me.

615
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,120
So let's go.

616
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,920
Come on.

617
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,480
 Fuck me.

618
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,440
[gunshot]

619
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,760
 Good news, guys!

620
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,320
Quittin' time!

621
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,080
Yee-haw!

622
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,080
Yee-haw!

623
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,960
Yeah, baby!

624
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,040
 Un-fucking-believable.

625
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,360
 It worked, didn't it?

626
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,440
Besides, anybody can
just jump in and drive

627
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,760
the fucking thing away.

628
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,040
Hey.

629
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,160
You want to get ahead
in this business,

630
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,920
you gotta make a
name for yourself.

631
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,320
[gunfire]

632
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
 Oh, fuck!

633
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,080
 What--

634
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,640
 Mother fucker!

635
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,120
[gunfire]

636
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,520
 Mother fucker!

637
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,440
Cocksucker!

638
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,800
 What the fuck was that?

639
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,640
 One of them jerks must
be stuck in the back.

640
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,440
 You're going to make a
name for yourself, all right.

641
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,800
Biggest fucking
idiot in Brooklyn!

642
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,160
Put the goddamn
thing away, will ya?

643
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,800
 Yeah, what are you, my
fucking mother, or what?

644
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,240
Shit, I'm empty.

645
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,080
 Yeah, well, you'd better
hope to God he is, too.

646
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,560
 Maybe I got the prick.

647
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,640
 Hey!

648
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,520
MAN: What?

649
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,720
 You listen to me!

650
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,200
I'm gonna open this
door up further, OK?

651
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,760
And then you are
going to take off.

652
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,840
And you're going to run your
ass out of here in 5 seconds.

653
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,560
And if you do, we won't
shoot your ass, OK?

654
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,120
Go.

655
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,000
Come on.

656
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,120
Come on.

657
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,040
No!

658
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,120
Nicky, no!

659
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,280
Come on!

660
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,680
Nicky, what the
fuck are you doing?

661
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,160
[shouting]

662
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,480
 Nicky!

663
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,600
That's enough!

664
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,920
Enough, already, all right?

665
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,680
- Get the fuck up, huh?
- No, Nicky!

666
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
That's fucking enough!

667
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,600
- You motherfucker!
- No!

668
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,520
No, no!

669
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,400
 Shrimpy motherfucker!

670
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,760
I'll kill you!

671
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,000
 Let's get the hell outta here!

672
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,600
Come on!

673
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Get in the fucking
cab, will you?

674
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,440
Get in the cab!

675
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,880
No!

676
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,320
[groaning]

677
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,360
 How do you like that?

678
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,280
Go.

679
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,040
 Come on!

680
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,080
Shit.

681
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
 Nine.

682
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,840
50.

683
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,880
50.

684
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,160
Like I said, five grand each.

685
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,800
When are you gonna wise up, huh?

686
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,320
I don't need a clown
for a right hand man,

687
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,320
with blinking Christmas
lights, and pinwheels

688
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,960
sticking out of his ass.

689
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,800
That's not in my best
interest, you understand?

690
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
 What are you talking about?

691
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,160
I didn't do nothing.
- Yah?

692
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,640
Then how come I got 30
mink coats with fucking

693
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,040
bullet holes in 'em?

694
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,400
Huh?

695
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,520
maybe I can sell 'em as
real soft toilet paper?

696
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,680
I even gotta take a
discount on the truck, which

697
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,440
was all shot to shit, too.

698
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,040
The next fucking bullshit
stunt you pull like that,

699
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,320
I'm not going to be sticking
my knife in a fucking table.

700
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,120
You understand?

701
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,000
Take it.

702
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,920
Take it.

703
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,280
Come on, you earned it.

704
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,480
Let's take a little
walk outside.

705
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,440
That's what you call
employee management.

706
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,920
It's the only thing
he understands.

707
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,240
He's gotta learn.

708
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,600
 He's loyal.

709
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000
 Yeah, and he's tough,
and he's street smart,

710
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,880
but he's got no fucking brains.

711
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,920
He's a lowlife, and
he always will be.

712
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,800
Look, I like the kid,
but I ain't making

713
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,120
no future plans with him.

714
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,800
You're the man.
- Naw.

715
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,840
Not me, Danny.

716
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,640
- Listen, listen.
- No, no--

717
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,800
 Hey.

718
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,280
What are you telling
me, all right?

719
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,920
You're practical,
you keep your head.

720
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,080
You never jump before you
know where you're gonna land.

721
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,000
That's what it takes.

722
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I mean, look around.

723
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,960
Look.

724
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,400
Everything's changing.

725
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,600
I mean, spics jumping off
the boat every minute.

726
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,680
Niggers marching up and down
the streets like they own it.

727
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,440
 Well, the old days are over.
You know that.

728
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,920
 That's OK.
That's OK, though.

729
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Change equals opportunity.

730
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,440
They all want something, Ali.

731
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,760
You know what I'm saying?

732
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,480
They get the money for
it one way or another.

733
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,960
Now, somebody's gotta
control the flow.

734
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,280
Why not me?

735
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,920
Why not you, huh?

736
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,360
 Look, Danny, I know--

737
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,760
I know you're looking out
for my best interests.

738
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
I know that.

739
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,240
I mean, you've always
been there for me.

740
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,800
But I'm not a businessman.

741
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,680
I'm just not.

742
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,640
You know, I got my drums.

743
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,560
That's enough for me.

744
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,160
 Hey, fuck your drums.

745
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,440
You can play the bongo with
your dick, the kind of money

746
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,640
you'll be making here.

747
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,840
Listen, I promised
your father I was

748
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,280
gonna see you set up proper, and
making something of yourself.

749
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,640
So I don't want no more
fucking discussion.

750
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,000
Humor me.

751
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,960
Together, you and me--

752
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,840
we're going.

753
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,760
 Danny?

754
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,520
You got a telephone call.

755
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,800
 I'll see you here
tomorrow night, OK?

756
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,600
 Yeah.

757
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,440
Aunt Rose?

758
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,320
Aunt Rose, I gotta run.

759
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,760
[music playing]

760
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,600
 You know, that act
with the camera's

761
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,000
getting pretty old, OK?

762
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,160
 But I'm getting
a lot of material.

763
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,320
 You're getting
a lot of bullshit,

764
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,720
is what you're getting.

765
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,560
You'll end up with a
feature length documentary

766
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,240
on the art of bullshit.

767
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,480
You really think
they buried somebody

768
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,200
else in Augie Bonacci's pants?

769
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,400
Please, spare me.

770
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,680
 Some of it must be true.

771
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,440
 They was just having
fun with you, that's all.

772
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,480
They don't know nothing
about the real Brooklyn.

773
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,120
 Oh, yeah?

774
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,960
Well, you don't know anything
about the rest of the world,

775
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,840
so we're even.

776
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,840
You're pretty good, you know?

777
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,720
 Thanks.

778
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,960
 Except you play
with no passion.

779
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,640
 Well, you know, Parent
has a cleaner sound.

780
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,840
You say Parente to some of
these white bread snobs,

781
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,640
and right away they got
you tied to the mob.

782
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,560
Parent has, uh-- warmth to it.

783
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,480
Like a mom and pop operation.

784
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,280
I'm not going to talk into
that thing, you know that?

785
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,200
 Why not?

786
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,680
You talked that night.

787
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,560
 And did I say anything?

788
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,840
So, now, what do
you want to ask me?

789
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,800
 Well, they tell
me that you are--

790
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,720
 They?

791
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,640
Who's they?

792
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,520
 Just the people I--

793
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,720
 They got names?

794
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,680
You see, that's what
I'm talking about.

795
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,320
In the old days,
people would never

796
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,440
talk shit behind your back.

797
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,680
 How do you know they
were talking shit?

798
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,040
 I was born in this
neighborhood, sweetheart.

799
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,280
And while I feel a
deep moral obligation

800
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,040
to improve my own community,
some people resent my methods.

801
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,480
Don't ask me why.

802
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,960
 Maybe it's because some people
are losing their apartments,

803
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,240
and businesses?

804
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
 What can I do about that?

805
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,000
That's the American way.

806
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,680
The food chain, see?

807
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,240
We all feed off each other.

808
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,840
Big fish eat little fish.

809
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,600
 And you are the big fish?

810
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,960
 I ain't been eaten yet.

811
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,240
What the hell does this have
to do with your little movie?

812
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,240
 You are one of the
leaders of the community.

813
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,400
You say you don't like
what's happening to it.

814
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,000
That people shouldn't leave.

815
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,840
But what do you do about it?

816
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,520
 What do I do about it?

817
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,560
I take care of my own.

818
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,960
 And what if, uh--

819
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,400
Al wanted to leave?

820
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,320
 This is his home.

821
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
This is where he belongs.

822
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,600
 But what if he wanted to?

823
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,880
 You're a very
attractive woman.

824
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,000
You know that?

825
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You know that.

826
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,880
Yeah, of course you know that.

827
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,200
And it just so happens
that I have a weakness

828
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,160
for attractive women.

829
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,120
As a matter of fact, I'd do
almost anything for them.

830
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,360
So I'm gonna do
something for you.

831
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,680
I'm going to give
you some advice.

832
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,800
If you don't want to get eaten,
don't swim with big fish.

833
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
The interview is over.

834
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,520
 Gabriela.

835
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,600
 Bonjourno.

836
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,560
[drumming]

837
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,640
ROSE: Ali!

838
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
Cut it out!

839
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,160
Enough!

840
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,120
 What would you
say if I asked you

841
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,000
to do the music for my movie?

842
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
 Come on, I ain't no composer.

843
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,600
 How do you know?

844
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,440
Are you afraid?

845
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,040
Just like you are afraid to
show me the real Brooklyn?

846
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,320
Hm?

847
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,200
What?

848
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,480
Think I'll bite?

849
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,800
[music playing]

850
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,240
 Somebody's going to
rip that thing off.

851
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,960
 Look, listen.

852
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,920
They are just like you.

853
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,120
- Let's go.
- No.

854
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,280
They are wonderful.

855
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,440
 I said, let's go.

856
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,160
 What's the matter with you?

857
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,680
You're not prejudiced,
are you, Alfonso?

858
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,320
 No.

859
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,880
I just got sense enough to know
when I'm in enemy territory.

860
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,640
That's all.

861
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,520
 What's the matter, Louie?

862
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,760
 It won't turn over.

863
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,040
Look at this new
friggin' battery.

864
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,840
I'm ruining my manicure.

865
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,880
 I used to be a mechanic.

866
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,000
 You were?

867
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,200
 What, you didn't know that?

868
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,440
I thought you knew everything?

869
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,000
I want you to reconsider
my proposal, Louie.

870
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,880
 Aw, come on, Danny.

871
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,080
I can't do that.

872
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,680
I run-- I run a clean place.

873
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,000
I want to keep it that way.

874
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,400
 Clean fucking business?

875
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,040
I was clean enough
when you were riding

876
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,520
on the balls of your
ass, looking for a loan

877
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,800
to get started.

878
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,960
The money wasn't too
fucking dirty then, huh?

879
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,680
Mikey?
Try it now.

880
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
You're welcome.

881
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,640
 Look, Danny-- Danny, please.

882
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,680
Come on, Danny.

883
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,840
What are you doing, huh?
Come on.

884
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,040
It's me, Louie.

885
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,080
 I don't know who
the fuck you are,

886
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,520
but you ain't no friend of mine.

887
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,120
And you obviously don't
know the fuck I am.

888
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,120
I'm always looking out
for your welfare, Louie.

889
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,080
And what do I get in return?

890
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,000
Nothing.

891
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,200
No respect.
- Danny, I

892
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,080
 Nothing.

893
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,960
No, you use me.

894
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,400
You use me.

895
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,760
And then I ask you for a favor.

896
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,680
 Please!

897
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,080
 You call that respect?

898
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,960
 Danny-- please, Danny.

899
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,200
No, Danny, please!
No!

900
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,120
 Please?

901
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,120
You're asking for help?

902
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,720
That don't seem fair, you know?

903
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,240
When I asked you for help,
you told me to go fuck myself.

904
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,600
I mean, it's gotta
be a two way street.

905
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,080
Gotta be.
- Danny, I'm family!

906
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,720
 Family my fucking ass.

907
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,680
Angie's family.

908
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,640
You're just a fucking leach.

909
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,000
 No.
No!

910
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,320
No!
No!

911
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,880
 Louie!
Louie!

912
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,080
What, are you gonna screw
around with the car all day?

913
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,120
I got customers inside.

914
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,360
 It's all right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

915
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,680
It's all right, Ang.

916
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,800
Look, we're doing a
little business here.

917
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,000
He'll be right in.

918
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,800
 Be right out, hon.

919
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,560
 I think we've got everything
straightened out now, don't we?

920
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,360
 Yeah.

921
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,160
 So, what kind
of music you want

922
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,040
for this film of yours, huh?

923
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,480
 Something with drums.

924
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,600
 Well, I kinda figured that.

925
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,280
So, how'd you get started with
all this movie stuff, anyway?

926
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,200
 Hey, small freakin' world.

927
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,800
 Yeah, a little too small.

928
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,320
Gabiriela, this is Nicky.

929
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,520
 Is this one of your
prejudiced friends?

930
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,320
 Prejudiced?
Who, me?

931
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,040
I just don't like niggers.

932
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,200
This is Miranda.

933
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,360
 Hi.

934
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,240
 How's your brother
Cessie doing?

935
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,560
Oh, he's good.

936
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,720
As a matter of fact,
he bought me this ring.

937
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,480
 You dating him, or something?

938
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,880
I'll get you
something nice, baby.

939
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,080
I'll get you a nice
ankle bracelet.

940
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,680
She's got great ankles.

941
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,760
So, I hear you're making movies.

942
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,800
I could be a movie
star, you know?

943
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,040
I even hung with De
Niro for a while, there.

944
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,640
 He bumped into him
coming out of a restaurant.

945
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,160
He never stops talking about it.

946
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,440
 Yeah, whatever.

947
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,800
 Excuse me.

948
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Listen, papi, I'm gonna
go powder my nose, OK?

949
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,040
 Powder everything, cause
I'm gonna be leaving prints.

950
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,880
 Don't miss me.

951
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,880
 What the fuck is
the matter with you?

952
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,160
What are you, crazy?

953
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,040
I don't know who's going
to cut your balls off,

954
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,240
Donna or Cessie.

955
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,240
 I like living on
the edge, my man.

956
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,480
You know that.

957
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,200
Besides, who's gonna tell 'em?

958
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,160
Here.

959
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,960
 What's that?

960
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,960
 It's your half of
the five from Parente.

961
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,160
Hey-- we stick together, bro.

962
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
No matter what.

963
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,080
 My man.

964
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,200
My man.

965
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,120
Yes.

966
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,920
 Nick is really something.

967
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,000
I must get him on tape.

968
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,880
 Yeah, well, you'll get
more than you bargained for.

969
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,800
Believe me.

970
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,080
 And Parente?

971
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,680
He is trouble, no?

972
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,560
 Naw.

973
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,040
He's a good guy.

974
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,680
 And so you are going
into business with him?

975
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,600
 I don't know.

976
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,400
I haven't decided yet.

977
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,520
Sit down.

978
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,320
Relax.

979
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,560
You know, sometimes, late
at night, I come out here,

980
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,000
and there's nobody around.

981
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And it's real peaceful--

982
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,000
I start to think that maybe the
world's not so bad after all,

983
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
you know?

984
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,840
 Do you have a
girlfriend, Alfonso?

985
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,640
 Please, enough with
this interview already.

986
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,120
 Why don't you want anyone
getting close to you?

987
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,640
 You know, I'm gonna start
charging you by the question.

988
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,840
I'm the one who
should be asking.

989
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,280
Now, I don't know
nothing about you.

990
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,760
Except that your-- your
mother was an artist.

991
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,520
That's all I know.

992
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,840
What about your father?

993
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,200
Hm?
Where's he?

994
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:45,960
What does he do?

995
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,160
 Tell you what--

996
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,560
you don't interview me,
I won't interview you.

997
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,800
Deal?

998
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,320
Fair enough.

999
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,120
 Walk me to my door.

1000
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,520
Come on.

1001
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,880
 How do you like the apartment?

1002
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,520
You know, we used
to live up here.

1003
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,120
 I know.

1004
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,280
Sometimes I can feel your
spirit moving through the rooms.

1005
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,080
It's very restless.

1006
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,360
 You know what this is, here?

1007
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,800
This is me growing up.

1008
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,360
My father used to--

1009
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,280
he'd make a big deal about
measuring me, you know?

1010
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,200
I was like, five here.

1011
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
Six.

1012
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,200
10.

1013
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,000
11.

1014
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,680
I should, uh--

1015
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,160
 Mm-mm.

1016
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,640
You don't have to go.

1017
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,480
[music playing]

1018
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,320
 All right, ante up five.

1019
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,960
- Replay.
- Jacks are better.

1020
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,840
Don't make any difference.

1021
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,960
He wins, anyway.

1022
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,760
This prick.

1023
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,440
What about Ali and this girl?

1024
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,640
 They were out last night.

1025
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,200
He was showing her the sights.

1026
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,680
 She's asking a
lot of questions?

1027
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,520
 Well, she's making
a movie, or something.

1028
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,360
 Well, maybe you'd better
keep your eye on her.

1029
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,280
One.

1030
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,200
 What?

1031
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,240
 See what they're up to.

1032
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,360
How many?

1033
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,720
 I told you, she's
making a movie.

1034
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,560
 Yeah, and I told you
to keep an eye on her.

1035
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,360
Find out where she's from, who
she's with, and what she wants.

1036
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,920
All right?

1037
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,720
 Want me to check her for
crabs, too, while I'm at it?

1038
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,000
Very fucking funny.

1039
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,280
- All right, all right.
- What do you got?

1040
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,480
- You're the boss.
- What do you got, huh?

1041
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,600
- Pair of aces.
- Pair of aces?

1042
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,480
What do you got?

1043
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,760
 Sixes, and a straight--

1044
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,120
 Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1045
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,040
 The fuck you doing?

1046
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,800
 Hey!

1047
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,360
 Ali boy, come here.

1048
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,640
I want you to do a
little job for me.

1049
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,520
 All right.

1050
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,160
 I want you to go over
to [inaudible] bridge.

1051
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,040
Don't jump.

1052
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,680
[inaudible]

1053
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,000
 And then the fourth--

1054
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,680
the Groovy Groove.

1055
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,960
Make it 1,000--

1056
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,480
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on.

1057
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,480
 I can't believe you.

1058
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,920
This is getting out of control!

1059
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,720
 Excuse me, I think this
is still my fucking phone.

1060
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,400
 Come on!

1061
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,360
Angie's getting ready to have
a baby in a couple of months,

1062
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,520
you're throwing it all away.

1063
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,760
 Hey, would you
mind your business?

1064
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,560
I know what I'm doing!

1065
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,600
 How you doing?

1066
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,400
 Hey, how you doing?

1067
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,040
 Listen, uh, Mr. Parente, he'd
like to start the remodeling,

1068
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,320
you know?

1069
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,840
So, uh, he'd like to
get the inspections

1070
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,880
cleared up soon as possible.

1071
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,760
 Yeah, it's a big job.

1072
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,800
I gotta tell you, this
building don't look too

1073
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,600
good from where I'm standing.

1074
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,400
 Yeah, well, uh--

1075
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,800
do what you gotta do.

1076
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,600
All right?
I'll wait for you outside.

1077
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,000
 I'll have the building's
safety certified

1078
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,240
by tomorrow afternoon.

1079
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,040
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

1080
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,840
 All right.

1081
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,600
What are you doing here?

1082
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,400
 I was in the
neighborhood, and I thought

1083
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,840
maybe I could get a ride home.

1084
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,120
 Yeah, well, you
shouldn't be drifting

1085
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,480
around out here by yourself.

1086
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,000
You could get yourself
in some serious trouble.

1087
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,160
 How do they keep their spirit?

1088
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,880
 They buy it.

1089
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,560
$10 bucks a rock.

1090
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,640
When they're all drugged up,
they don't care about nothing.

1091
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,840
What are you looking
at me like that for?

1092
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,160
Hey, I'm a realist, you know?

1093
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
You see how they live.

1094
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,640
Drug dealing, burnt
out buildings.

1095
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,680
They trash their own homes.

1096
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,040
You don't see any of that
in my neighborhood, do you?

1097
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,680
That's cause we have pride.

1098
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,080
 And what about the mafia?

1099
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,400
 Hey!

1100
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,600
My family has always
earned an honest living,

1101
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,760
you understand me?

1102
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,200
 Until now.

1103
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,280
Because now your uncle
Danny controls everything.

1104
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,280
 Whoa, whoa.

1105
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,760
First of all, he's not my uncle.

1106
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,320
He's a family friend.

1107
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,840
And you are just a
stranger, so don't act

1108
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,560
like you know everything, OK?

1109
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,480
Danny's a businessman.

1110
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,560
That's all he is.

1111
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,000
 But you work for him.

1112
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,400
 I help him out
whenever I feel the need.

1113
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,280
 And that means throwing
people out into the street?

1114
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,920
 You don't know
nothing about me.

1115
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,880
 So tell me.

1116
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,640
I want to know.

1117
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,160
YOUNG AL: Hey,
Dad, check it out.

1118
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,320
AL'S FATHER: That a boy, Ali.

1119
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,800
We're gonna see
your name in lights.

1120
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,920
Al Stanco, drummer
extraordinaire.

1121
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,040
YOUNG AL: Hey, John.

1122
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,080
JOHN: Hey, Ali boy.

1123
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,440
How you doing?
YOUNG AL: Good.

1124
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,440
JOHN: Your dad is in the back.

1125
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,240
YOUNG AL: OK.
Dad?

1126
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,320
AL'S FATHER: No, it's all right.

1127
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,480
Tonight I'll close up by myself.

1128
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,240
 Cakes and pies.

1129
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,480
Over here.

1130
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,240
And down here, all the
pastries, eclairs, Napoleons.

1131
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,920
And all the breads.

1132
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,080
[inaudible]

1133
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,200
Right here you
had your cannolis.

1134
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,840
The best around.

1135
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,240
And the cookies went over here.

1136
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,520
$1.50 a pound.

1137
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,880
And you'd weigh them over
here, and box 'em up.

1138
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,400
You see this?

1139
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,040
My mother used to--

1140
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,680
you know, she used to
ask Miss Savors for a--

1141
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,600
a, uh-- tomato plant,
and tie 'em up.

1142
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,240
 You come back
here a lot, Alfonso?

1143
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,840
AL'S FATHER: Go right
home to your mother.

1144
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,760
Go, get out of here.

1145
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,680
Hey.

1146
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,640
YOUNG AL: Dad?

1147
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,440
 See this?

1148
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,120
That's a bullet that missed.

1149
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,120
One out of the four.

1150
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:51,200
She spent hours trying to get
the blood out of the tiles.

1151
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,480
Scrubbing and scrubbing.

1152
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,160
There's still a
trace here and there.

1153
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,520
Didn't even take nothing.

1154
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,480
Shot my father
for the fun of it.

1155
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,760
That's how they are.

1156
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,680
 They?

1157
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,240
Who's they?

1158
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,640
 You know.

1159
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,200
 How do you know he was black?

1160
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,920
 What do you think
he was, an Eskimo?

1161
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,240
 You just assume--

1162
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,360
 My uncle Guy was at
the deli down the block.

1163
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,320
Saw the guy running away.

1164
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,160
Ran right past him.

1165
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,440
 That doesn't mean--

1166
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,680
 He was black, he
had a gun in his hand.

1167
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,760
Case closed.

1168
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,440
 But they never caught him?

1169
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,440
 The police never caught him.

1170
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,800
But he was taken care of.

1171
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,240
 Oh, you sneak around
like a little thief.

1172
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,200
 Where's Ali?

1173
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,120
 I don't know.

1174
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,000
He went out.

1175
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,480
He's coming back at 5:30.

1176
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,080
We're going to eat some scampi.
You want to join us?

1177
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,640
 Oh, naw.
Too busy.

1178
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,360
 Listen, when are you going
to settle down with Donna?

1179
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,840
 There's only one woman
in the world for me.

1180
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,360
You know that?

1181
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,920
They don't make 'em
like they used to, Rosa!

00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,600
 All right.

1189
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,920
 This is my past.

1190
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,240
Empty room, bare walls.

1191
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,120
Topped off with the
blood of my father.

1192
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,720
I get so angry, Gabriela.

1193
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,680
I get so angry when
I think about it.

1194
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,880
I never spoke to anybody
like this before.

1195
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,480
 It's OK.

1196
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,880
I understand.

you know, I'm gonna work on it.

 Why do you keep
calling me that?

 It's your name, isn't it?

1209
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,040
 Only one person

00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,760
Fucking got his fingers
in everybody's pockets.

1268
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,800
You see that blood right there?

1269
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,720
Right there?

1270
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,720
That's his blood.

1271
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,560
Believe that.

1272
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,800
 Nice little movie, huh?

1273
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,680
All that's missing
is a scene with me,

1274
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,640
you, and Parente walking
hand-in-hand to jail.

1275
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,480
Did you ever find
out her last name?

1276
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,600
Maybe it's Jackson.

1277
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,400
Or Jones.

1278
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,760
 I got nothing.

1279
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,320
King, jack-- ace high.

1280
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,240
Pair of threes.

1281
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,200
I win again.

1282
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,520
 [inaudible].

1283
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,760
 Where'd you steal that?

1284
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,040
 We gotta talk, Danny.

1285
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:49,840
Alone.

1286
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,120
I it's time for me to run my
own business in my own way.

1287
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,160
 Your business?

1288
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,640
 That's right.

1289
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,120
All my life, everybody's
been breaking my balls.

1290
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,880
But not anymore.

1291
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,680
I'll keep this between us
so as not to embarrass you,

1292
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,760
but this is my business,
and nobody's going

1293
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,040
to break my balls here anymore.

1294
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,320
You understand?

1295
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,440
 There's one problem, Louie.

1296
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,880
This is my building.

1297
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,280
 Yeah, well, when my
lease runs out in 10 years,

1298
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,280
then you come talk to me.

1299
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,640
 Oh.

1300
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,240
 Until then, I'm calling
the shots around here.

1301
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,840
And that don't include
catering to you,

1302
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,360
or any of your scumbag friends.

1303
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,240
 Hey, Richie-- get
rid of that tail, huh?

1304
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,400
 What's happened?

1305
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,640
I don't understand.

1306
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,520
 Want you to do the
music for my film?

1307
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,560
 I do.

1308
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,880
 Don't bullshit me, Gabriella!

1309
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,400
I already seen your film, OK?

1310
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,040
You took me for some stupid
greaseball guinea who'd believe

1311
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,000
anything you told him, right?

1312
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,440
 Listen to me.

1313
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,680
 Now I know why you wanted
fucking Danny on tape.

1314
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,720
What did you expect me
to do, hand you Parente's

1315
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,280
head on a silver platter?

1316
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,680
You want me to betray my
family, and my friends the way

1317
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,480
you betrayed me?

1318
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,720
Huh?

1319
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,600
Why did I trust you?

1320
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,560
Jesus Christ!

1321
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,520
That was fucking stupid.

1322
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,760
 [non-english speech].

1323
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,800
You're right about one thing--

1324
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,240
I didn't really come here to
make a movie about Brooklyn.

1325
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,000
I told myself I
did, but deep down

1326
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I really came here to meet you.

1327
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,800
 Oh, don't give me
that shit, Gabriela.

1328
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,720
OK?

1329
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,600
Don't even bother.

1330
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,480
 Bam.

1331
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,440
Bam.

1332
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,920
Four.

1333
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,000
And you know when you
hear shots, you go down.

1334
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,080
That's what you learn in a war.

1335
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,280
You go down.

1336
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,200
You don't try to be a hero.

1337
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,240
Curiosity killed the cat.

1338
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,520
So I go down to the
floor, and I wait.

1339
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,240
And it gets real quiet, until
I hear someone screaming.

1340
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,120
Then I hear footsteps
coming out of the baker.

1341
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,920
Fast.

1342
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:35,920
So I stand up, and there he
goes, running by like the devil

1343
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,680
himself.

1344
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,560
Diabolo.

1345
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,920
The black devil.

1346
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,960
 I make my living
talking to people.

1347
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,920
I know when someone's
holding back.

1348
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,760
There is something
about your father.

1349
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,760
 Hey.

1350
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,040
Shut up already about my family.

1351
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,680
Keep your lying
ideas to yourself.

1352
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,840
Yeah, I know why you don't
want to talk about your father.

1353
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,720
All that time I was stupid
enough to tell you everything.

1354
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,120
You couldn't tell me nothing.

1355
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,200
What's the matter, you
can't face what you are?

1356
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,280
Because to me you're still a--

1357
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,440
 Go on.

1358
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,400
Say it.

1359
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,520
What do you think?

1360
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,120
You think I never
heart it before?

1361
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,720
I grew up in this neighborhood.

1362
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,440
That's right-- just
a few blocks away.

1363
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,960
I'm proud of my past.

1364
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,960
My father was a good man.

1365
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,480
A man who cared
about his family,

1366
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,200
and stood by his principles.

1367
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,480
Just like yours.

1368
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,120
 You don't know
nothing about my father.

1369
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,120
 You're wrong.

1370
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,120
You and I are so close.

1371
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,480
You were 12 when your
father was killed.

1372
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,360
I was only five.

1373
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,520
We were sent to Italy
to live after he passed

1374
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,680
away, until everyone forgot.

1375
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,400
My mother told me the
truth just before dying.

1376
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,200
And that's why I came back here.

1377
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,440
Back to where my
father was killed.

1378
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,880
You see-- they said a black man
shot a white man in his bakery.

1379
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:07,120
So, a black man had
to die in return.

1380
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,360
If it was the same black
man who did it, fine.

1381
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:16,360
If not-- well, they're
all the same, aren't they?

1382
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,840
Hm?

1383
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,520
It was my father, Ali.

1384
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,360
My father, my mother, me.

1385
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,240
We all paid for
your father's death.

1386
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,400
And now just get out.

1387
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,320
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

1388
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,080
 What's going on?

1389
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:46,960
What happened?

1390
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,680
[non-english].

1391
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,480
Al?

1392
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,720
 Aw, you mother-- dirty--

1393
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,160
[sigh]

1394
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,120
 This fucking neighborhood.

1395
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,080
[car starting]

1396
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,680
 Thank you.

1397
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,480
Huh?

1398
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,160
 Louie.

1399
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,520
[gunfire]

1400
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,640
 Give us this day
our daily bread,

1401
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,480
and forgive us our
trespasses, as we forgive

1402
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,880
those who trespass against us.

1403
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,200
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1404
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:32,960
Amen.

1405
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,960
Eternal rest grant
unto him, oh Lord,

1406
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,160
and let perpetual
light shine upon--

1407
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,160
 Fucking Louie, man.

1408
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,320
Who would have believed it, huh?

1409
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,880
REVEREND: And the souls of all--

1410
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,360
 I always knew there would
be trouble sooner or later.

1411
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,880
Those niggers are
always causing trouble.

1412
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:46,640
 It's fucked up.

1413
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,320
 Louie had that big
payday with the ponies.

1414
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,000
They probably found out he
was carrying extra dough.

1415
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,760
 Bastards.

1416
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,040
 Motherfucking animals.

1417
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,680
Those We should hang
them by their balls.

1418
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,120
 I'm sorry.

1419
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:31,960
I'm so, so sorry.

1420
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,040
Come here.

1421
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,040
You got a problem
with me, Uncle Guy?

1422
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,560
Huh?

1423
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,160
 He was family, Danny.

1424
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,040
Family.

1425
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,240
This is the old way.

1426
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,640
This is not right.

1427
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,360
It never was.

1428
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,960
 Get the fuck out of my face
before I put you in a fucking--

1429
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,200
get the fuck outta here.

1430
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,080
Get outta here.

1431
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,040
 I have nothing to say to you.

1432
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,720
You're Parente's boy now.

1433
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,000
Your father's son anymore.

1434
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,280
 Please, Uncle Guy.

1435
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,280
Don't give me that shit, OK?

1436
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,800
Now, who are you to talk?

1437
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,000
You've taken as much from
Parente as any one of us.

1438
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,960
 No, never.

1439
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,200
Not a dime I took from him.

1440
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,200
Not a penny.

1441
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:26,960
Not like you.

1442
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,840
Louie made that mistake, but
he tried to make it right.

1443
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,640
He was a good boy.

1444
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,680
He was like your father.

1445
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,040
Too honest.

1446
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,120
He stood up to him.

1447
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:40,920
Not like you.

1448
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,360
 What are you talking about?

1449
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,320
 He pays you to be
blind, doesn't he?

1450
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,600
 Well, not me.

1451
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,240
I know what I see.

1452
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,040
 Hey, if you're
so goddamn noble,

1453
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,560
how can you just walk away?

1454
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,240
If you're so much
better than him,

1455
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,640
and me, and all the rest of us,
why don't you stand up to him?

1456
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,080
Tell me what you know.

1457
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,120
I want the truth, god dammit.

1458
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,760
 We'd better get going.

1459
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,400
 And it gets real quiet.

1460
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,640
And I hear screaming,
and then footsteps

1461
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,160
coming out of the bakery fast.

1462
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,400
So I stand up.

1463
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,160
And there he goes, running
by like the devil himself.

1464
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,520
Diabolo.

1465
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,840
A black devil.
- Right.

1466
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,920
A black man.

1467
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,720
 Black.

1468
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,560
Black.

1469
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,400
A black mask.

1470
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,200
 A mask?

1471
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,880
GUY: Your father was in trouble.

1472
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,880
He wouldn't allow them to use
the bakery for their purposes.

1473
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
 Danny?

1474
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,440
What are you doing?

1475
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,920
 He was an honest man, so
he had to be taken care of.

1476
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,160
 It's going to come
get this, Danny?

1477
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,400
Danny-- we're family, Danny.

1478
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,120
We're like family, Danny.

1479
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,480
[gunfire]

1480
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,240
 Poor Vincenzo.

1481
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,480
Hard head.

1482
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,880
Like cement.

1483
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,320
He wouldn't listen.

1484
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,680
Parente was paying his dues.

1485
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,120
He didn't have the
courage to refuse.

1486
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,400
 You knew this?

1487
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,720
All these years, you knew this?

1488
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,240
 I came from the old country.

1489
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,600
It was our way.

1490
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,080
Silencio.

1491
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,720
And in my stupidity, I thought
it was the right thing.

1492
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,200
Now?

1493
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,880
Now I know better.

1494
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,360
He can't do anything to me.

1495
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,960
But it's too late.

1496
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:11,880
I'm sorry.

1497
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,640
It's too late.

1498
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,360
 Where did you get this?

1499
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,840
 Uncle Guy gave it to me.

1500
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,720
He said you should have it.

1501
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,440
Where are you going?

1502
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,760
 I gotta get back to the wake.

1503
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,880
 This music is driving me nuts.

1504
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,640
 Stop it.

1505
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,760
 He was always
blowing his stack

1506
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,560
about one thing or another.

1507
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,920
Sure, he'd get all pissed off--

1508
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,360
and then an hour later,
it was all forgotten.

1509
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,080
 He was a good man.

1510
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,840
I'm saying right now, no
matter who winds up running

1511
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,880
this place, it'll always
be called [inaudible]

1512
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,320
as long as I'm around.

1513
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,920
 Let's hope that's
not very long.

1514
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,160
 Where You been?

1515
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,920
You get lost coming
from the cemetery?

1516
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,240
 I've been talking
to some ghosts.

1517
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,520
Louie's ghost.

1518
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,040
My father's ghost.

1519
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,840
They had some interesting
things to say about you.

1520
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,480
 Some gotti better get
my man here a drink.

1521
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,480
He's seeing things.

1522
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,560
 No, I'm seeing
you real clear now.

1523
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,440
 What's the matter, huh?

1524
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,360
Huh?

1525
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,600
You're acting all stupid.

1526
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,000
 Well, I was just wondering--

1527
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
a man who can kill
his own people--

1528
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
his own kind-- and then laugh
and drink at their funerals--

1529
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,960
a man that rotten--

1530
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,640
how come I can't smell him
when I'm standing so close?

1531
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,280
 What's that supposed to mean?
Hey, what the fuck?

1532
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,240
 Hey!

1533
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,720
What the fuck are you doing?

1534
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,520
 Stop it.

1535
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,120
That's a nasty cough
you got there, son.

1536
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,520
You should take some medicine.

1537
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,440
 What, the same medicine
you gave my father?

1538
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,600
Huh?

1539
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,600
 I'm a busy man, Ali.

1540
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,680
You got something
to say, then say it.

1541
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,880
 Yeah, I got something to say.

1542
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,680
When I'm good and ready.

1543
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,720
 Why didn't I hear
about these tapes?

1544
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:14,600
 I told Ali.

1545
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,440
I thought he was your man?

1546
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,120
 Is he going to talk?

1547
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,240
 Sure, he'll talk.

1548
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,000
He's a fucking weasel.

1549
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,840
We gotta take care of him.

1550
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,200
 He spit at you, Danny.

1551
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,440
We all saw it.

1552
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,560
 Just sit there and
shut the fuck up!

1553
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,160
Nicky, I want you
to take care of it.

1554
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,040
 Me?

1555
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,200
 And the broad, too.

1556
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,080
I never liked her
from the start.

1557
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,800
You gotta trust your instincts.

1558
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,600
 Why are you sending me?

1559
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,320
 Because it's time for
you to make your bones.

1560
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,400
 You know how I
feel about you--

1561
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,080
 Good.
Good.

1562
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,560
Then you take him out tonight.

1563
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,080
And I want you to sever
his motherfucking eyeballs,

1564
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,520
and I want you to put them
right here, on this table.

1565
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,040
 What if he stays home?

1566
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,800
 Do you need a fucking diagram?

1567
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,840
 No.

1568
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,640
I don't.

1569
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,640
 Nicky-- Nicky,
where are you going?

1570
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,040
 You know, that prick's
no bargain, either.

1571
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,480
You know what I'm thinking?

1572
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,280
Maybe you should not out
two birds with one stone.

1573
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,760
 Cessie.

1574
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,640
Come here.

1575
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,440
Sit down.

1576
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,920
Come here.

1577
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:41,800
You have a sister.

1578
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,720
What's her name?

1579
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,960
Uh-- Miranda?

1580
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,880
 Yeah.

1581
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,520
 Yeah.

1582
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:50,640
Uh-- would you like to know
what she's been up to lately?

1583
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,400
 Yeah.

1584
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,080
 She's been seeing Nicky.

1585
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,000
 Naw.

1586
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,440
 Yeah.

1587
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,800
That scumbag
bastard [inaudible]..

1588
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,680
She has been seeing him.

1589
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,320
Some people told me.

1590
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,920
I didn't see it with my own
eyes, but good people told me.

1591
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,360
 You screw some
[inaudible] spic and then

1592
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,440
you come back to my bed?

1593
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,880
I hope he fucking kills you.

1594
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,880
I hope he does!

1595
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,080
 You hope who kills me?

1596
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,520
 Your fucking brother
in law, Cessie.

1597
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,920
He's coming for
your ass right now.

1598
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,640
Parente told him everything.

1599
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,080
 That prick is dicking
us every which way.

1600
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,000
Fucking incredible, man.

1601
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,520
Come on.

1602
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,880
Let's get outta here.

1603
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,840
 I'll lead him down
towards Palmer Street.

1604
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,600
Give me a few minutes,
then you head north, OK?

1605
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,520
 I'm going to go with you.

1606
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,720
 Give me a break, will ya?

1607
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,880
 You trying to
be a hero, Nicky?

1608
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,560
 You don't worry about me, Cuz.

1609
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,800
Cause that'll be the day I run
scared from some PR coke head.

1610
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,400
 You be careful.

1611
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,440
 You and that freaking camera.

1612
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,240
Man.

1613
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:18,920
 Nicky!

1614
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,520
[gunfire]

1615
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,000
 Stay here.

1616
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:27,880
Stay here!

1617
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,360
Nicky!

1618
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:40,840
Nicky!

1619
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,440
Nicky!

1620
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,240
DONNA: Nicky!

1621
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,920
 Jesus Christ, Nicky.

1622
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,160
DONNA: Nicky!

1623
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,560
 You and me, bro.

1624
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,480
 Nicky!

1625
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,480
Nicky!

1626
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,480
No!

1627
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,480
No!

1628
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,480
Baby!

1629
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,480
 Nicky!

1630
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,960
 Nicky!

1631
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,960
 Jesus Christ!

1632
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,760
 Baby?

1633
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,360
 Nicky!

1634
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,840
[crying]

1635
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,800
 Nicky always was a
useless motherfucker.

1636
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,560
 At least he had a heart.

1637
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,960
 It's OK.

1638
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,520
Why don't you go home
and change your clothes?

1639
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,600
Come on, you're
beginning to stink.

1640
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,000
Vinny.
Vinny, please.

1641
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,760
Come on.

1642
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,480
So I guess that leaves
me and you, huh?

1643
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:03,120
 That's what you said
the day my father died.

1644
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,240
 You look a little
nervous, Ali.

1645
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,120
Just sit down.

1646
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,320
Have a break.

1647
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,440
 No, I don't drink
with scumbags.

1648
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,920
It's a personal thing.

1649
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,200
 No, I'd say that's you.

1650
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:17,400
You're the worst kind
of scumbag there is.

1651
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,480
You sold me out.

1652
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,480
Sold me out for a
little taste of pussy.

1653
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:26,240
And a bitch with
nigger blood, no less.

1654
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,760
 She's better than
you'll ever be.

1655
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,440
Because you're nothing.

1656
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,920
Nothing.

1657
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,160
You're a lying, low life,
gutless sack of shit.

1658
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,560
You killed my father, your
own best fucking friend.

1659
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,800
I just want you to
admit what you did.

1660
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,240
 You sure?

1661
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,000
 Oh, yeah.

1662
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,800
That's all I want.

1663
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,160
 But that puts me in a very
awkward position, doesn't it?

1664
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,480
[gunfire]

1665
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,200
 Peekaboo.

1666
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:22,000
I see you.

1667
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,360
Scumbag, huh?

1668
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,720
Now look at you.
Look.

1669
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,880
Look.

1670
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,480
Just like the rat
bastard you are.

1671
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:31,800
 Why don't you cut the shit,
and do what you gotta do?

1672
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,400
 Open your mouth real wide.

1673
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,120
I'm going to send one in.

1674
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,960
[gunshot]

1675
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,280
 Don't fucking move!

1676
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:46,600
 Aw, shit!

1677
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,120
Shit!
- Don't move!

1678
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:48,960
Don't move!

1679
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,320
Sit down.

1680
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,120
 You motherfucker.

1681
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:56,920
 Sit the fuck down.

1682
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,440
What's the matter, Danny?

1683
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,320
You look a little nervous.

1684
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,600
 Why don't you just
skip the bullshit?

1685
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,640
We can make a deal here.

1686
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,040
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1687
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,240
You know what I got going.

1688
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:17,320
Real estate, loan
shark, and drugs.

1689
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:24,560
Oh, you-- I got deals
going everywhere.

1690
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,720
You want in?

1691
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,000
Whatever you want.

1692
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,840
There's enough money
in it for everybody.

1693
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,440
Let's just forget about
all this bullshit,

1694
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,640
and we'll start fresh.

1695
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,560
I'll take good care of ya.

1696
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:33,440
 Oh, yeah.

1697
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,520
That's right.

1698
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,000
That's right, yeah.

1699
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,560
You told my pop that you
would take good care of me.

1700
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,680
That's right.

1701
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,640
But let me ask you
something-- was

1702
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,440
this before you blew his
fucking brains out, or after?

1703
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,320
 Ali!

1704
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,480
That was business.

1705
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:51,560
If it wasn't me, it just
would've been somebody else.

1706
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,640
 Did you kill Nicky?

1707
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,520
 Yeah.

1708
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,760
 Did you kill Louie?

1709
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,200
 Yeah.

1710
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,160
I ripped his fucking
eyeballs out, and I ate 'em!

1711
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,800
 Did you kill my father?

1712
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,880
 Yeah, I killed him!

1713
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,600
Big fucking deal!

1714
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,320
Everybody dies.

1715
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,840
That's just the way it is.

1716
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:06,760
That's a part of life.

1717
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,160
It's a part of growing up.

1718
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,000
Hey, you want to show me?
Shoot!

1719
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Huh?

1720
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Shoot!

1721
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,080
Just don't waste
my fucking time!

1722
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,040
Yeah.

1723
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,920
Yeah, I figured.

1724
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:24,240
You didn't have
the fucking balls.

1725
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,120
No!

1726
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,680
Don't shoot me!

1727
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,120
Don't shoot!

1728
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,440
[siren]

1729
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,800
 Too late.

1730
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,360
Always shoot first.

1731
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,800
Talk is just bullshit, Ali boy.

1732
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,480
 You get that?

1733
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,080
 Get what?

1734
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,960
Huh?

1735
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,400
 Yeah.

1736
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,440
I got it.

1737
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,640
[screaming]

1738
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,120
 You forgot to wear
your mask this time.

1739
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,960
- Hey, Al.
- Where you going?

1740
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,640
 We're going to go to Coney
Island for a couple of hours.

1741
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:07,880
You gonna be OK?

1742
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:08,840
 Yeah, of course.

1743
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:09,880
I got Aunt Rose in the kitchen.

1744
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:10,800
You kiddin' me?

1745
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,640
Hey, come here.

1746
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,960
Give me a kiss.

1747
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,600
You gonna give your
uncle a kiss, or what?

1748
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,360
All right, listen, you have
fun in Coney Island, OK?

1749
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,160
Now listen, don't eat
nothing, whatever you do.

1750
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,880
Because we got something
special planned for dinner.

1751
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,360
 Oh, really?
Like what?

1752
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,360
 I'm not going to tell you.

1753
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,480
Then it's not a surprise, is it?

1754
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,200
All right, be careful.
Have fun.

1755
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,760
 Ciao.

1756
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,560
Ciao, ciao.

1757
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:53,480
[music playing]
