1
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:48,618
Move it up.

2
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:50,537
- Is this right?
- Yes.

3
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,174
- We're not supposed to take these.
- Don't worry about it.

4
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:06,303
- Just get the net in.
- I don't think you're....

5
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:09,806
Jesus.

6
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,819
We're not pulling at the same time.

7
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:29,034
What? Jesus!

8
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,814
Did any more of you guys see Carl
at Ship Channel Bank last night?

9
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:02,859
- Why do you want to know?
- To see if somebody talked to him.

10
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:05,862
Fish went sour when the fog rolled in.
I got out of there.

11
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:08,656
We got Ferry, Hardwell,
Moulton, Miyamoto.

12
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:10,700
- Anybody else?
- Japs.

13
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,871
I figured you'd have heard by now.

14
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,332
All right...

15
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:22,253
- ... if you see any of these guys...
- Art's starting to sound like a real sheriff.

16
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:27,384
- Do think this was just an accident?
- Of course it is, but a man's dead, William.

17
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:30,428
I've gotta write my report.
God, I hate this.

18
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:33,723
Chambers, tell me...

19
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:38,686
...I'm not gonna get your newspaper and
see an article about an investigation, am I?

20
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:42,649
- You want me to lie?
- No, I want to be off the record.

21
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:44,317
That's what I want.

22
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,491
I mean, if there is a killer,
why would you want him all alerted?

23
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:54,994
- So there's a murder investigation?
- I didn't say that.

24
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:01,204
Hatsue? You all right?

25
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:04,374
Go away, Ishmael.

26
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,425
- Look, I just wanted to tell you...
- Go away.

27
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:29,232
There you go, Miyamoto.

28
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,913
Just a minute.

29
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:52,130
Morning, Kazuo.

30
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:55,675
I've come to get you out of here.

31
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,221
Good morning, sir.

32
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:01,931
Counselor.

33
00:09:04,642 --> 00:09:05,935
Sorry I'm late.

34
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:07,603
That's all right.

35
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:09,856
Looks like we have a good turnout.

36
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,368
How about that jury?
What a bunch of yokels.

37
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:25,788
Have you seen this Island Review rag?

38
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:29,417
Guy writes like this trial is
the biggest thing ever happened.

39
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:33,504
- Why is this news in Seattle?
- Because he's a Jap. Simple as that.

40
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:38,259
Take a look at that.

41
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:35,983
Would you tell us, please, Sheriff...

42
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,653
...what was your first impression...

43
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:43,824
...as you and your deputy inspected
the Susan Marie that September morning?

44
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:46,702
Mainly...

45
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:48,955
...how quiet it was out there...

46
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,625
...things just didn't add up.

47
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:57,713
- "Add up?" What do you mean?
- Fishermen drown. It happens.

48
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:00,633
But Carl Heine....

49
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:03,594
I got to thinking, he was so meticulous.

50
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:06,514
He did everything right by the darn book.

51
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:10,768
Every single light is on and his net's out.

52
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:15,356
- I got a bad feeling about this.
- Don't say that, Abel.

53
00:11:15,564 --> 00:11:17,775
Don't even think like that. Jesus.

54
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,601
There's nothing in the hold...

55
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,436
...apart from fish.

56
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:38,105
You wanna pull up the net?

57
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:42,985
So looking at the evidence there
you determined this was no accident.

58
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:49,033
I didn't determine
much of anything at first.

59
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:52,411
I just kept wondering what
I was gonna say to his family.

60
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:54,330
After all, I knew the guy.

61
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:56,790
I knew his wife and children and....

62
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:21,857
- Hey, men.
- Hi.

63
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:26,820
- Is your mother home?
- She's inside.

64
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:30,241
Go on and play now.

65
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,202
She's right in there.

66
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,963
Susan Marie?

67
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:47,716
Come in! I'll be right down!

68
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:07,569
What can I do for you?

69
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,239
- Carl's not home yet.
- That's what I....

70
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:14,910
That's why I'm here.

71
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:21,125
I'm afraid I've got
some very bad news to tell you.

72
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,460
The worst kind of news.

73
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,633
Carl died last night
out at Ship Channel Bank.

74
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:35,305
Carl's just fine.

75
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:39,643
I found him, Susan Marie.

76
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:42,187
I found him tangled in his net.

77
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,531
I knew this would happen.

78
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:01,915
I warned him.

79
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:28,192
You said there was no sign of a struggle.

80
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,444
Nothing out of the ordinary.

81
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,369
As I said, with a fella as particular as Carl...

82
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,498
...there were a few things
that struck me as odd.

83
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:45,876
You mentioned the coffee cup on the floor.

84
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:50,214
Was there anything else out of place?

85
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:53,884
There was a dead battery
just lying around and...

86
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:57,012
...the cover to the battery well
didn't fit right.

87
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,516
A battery cover that didn't fit.

88
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:03,560
What did you make of that?

89
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:06,396
Objection. Asking the witness
to speculate.

90
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:11,818
Was I supposed to object every time
you did that?

91
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,405
That's quite enough horseplay.
Try and act your age.

92
00:16:15,697 --> 00:16:18,116
If I did that, Your Honor, I'd be dead.

93
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:22,496
- Proceed, gentlemen.
- There's an objection, Your Honor.

94
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,581
And it's overruled.

95
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:27,000
You may answer the question.

96
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:32,089
I looked under the lid and one
of the batteries was bigger than the other.

97
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,550
Didn't that also strike you as odd...

98
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:40,180
...that he would have a battery that
didn't fit, a man as particular as Carl?

99
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:42,933
Yeah, I wondered.

100
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:46,770
But he'd done some
on-the-spot work, you see.

101
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:49,231
And the flange was kind of...

102
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:53,318
...banged away to make room
for the one that was too big.

103
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:57,239
Would this "too big" battery have fit, say...

104
00:16:57,781 --> 00:16:59,741
...in Kazuo Miyamoto's battery well?

105
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:03,745
It was the exact same type as Miyamoto's,
that's for sure, but...

106
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:08,959
...he had both of his batteries in
when we searched his boat later on, so....

107
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:33,817
Ifyou fall off a motorcycle,
the injuries look different.

108
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,281
In this case, the injury had been inflicted
by a long, narrow, flat object.

109
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:43,493
- Like a fishing gaff, for example?
- That's very possible.

110
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:51,168
You say it was a laceration about
two and a half inches long...

111
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,295
...over the left ear.

112
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:58,049
The bone under it
fractured over a four-inch area.

113
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,926
What would've caused that?

114
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:03,597
I'll tell you what a head wound like this
puts me in mind of.

115
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:07,726
I've seen wounds exactly like this...

116
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:10,687
...many times in the war.

117
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:13,857
Have you seen this specific kind
of wound before?

118
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,569
Frequently, as a result
of hand-to-hand combat with Jap soldiers.

119
00:18:17,652 --> 00:18:18,904
I even told Art:

120
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:23,533
"You wanna play Sherlock Holmes,
look for a Jap with a bloody gun butt."

121
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:26,161
What led you to that conclusion?

122
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:31,082
I've seen these kendo wounds many times,
exactly like this one.

123
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,710
Could you tell us what kendo is?

124
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:47,474
Kendo is Japanese stick fighting.

125
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,061
They train as kids, you know,
to kill with sticks.

126
00:18:57,442 --> 00:18:59,611
No further questions. Thank you.

127
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:39,693
Your report states
it was death by drowning...

128
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:42,028
...not a kendo wound.

129
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:43,989
How did you determine this?

130
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:48,994
As I've already testified,
I found foam in the deceased's lungs.

131
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:51,413
This foam.

132
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,457
I'm not sure I understand about this.

133
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,626
What would cause that again?

134
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,714
It occurs when water,
mucus and air are mixed by respiration.

135
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:03,550
Breathing, that is. I believe I said that.

136
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,635
But you can see why I'm confused.

137
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:08,596
Because a drowned person
doesn't breathe, so...

138
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,268
Of course not. The foam means
that he went in breathing.

139
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,856
That's why the autopsy report shows
drowning as the cause of death.

140
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:23,778
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first,
on the deck, then thrown overboard.

141
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:28,324
- Well, you can always...
- Thank you. That's important, that's good.

142
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:31,244
There's something else
I'd like to ask you about.

143
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:33,413
Something in your report.

144
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,291
Go ahead, ask.

145
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,127
About the wound to the deceased's head.

146
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,670
You say here...

147
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:44,924
...that it was made
by a long, narrow, flat object.

148
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:48,970
Is that what you saw,
or it is just your inference?

149
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:52,724
It's my job to infer.
That's what coroners do, we infer.

150
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:56,352
That's my area of expertise, inference.

151
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:58,271
Of course it is.

152
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:00,732
Can you infer, then...

153
00:21:00,815 --> 00:21:04,694
...whether an object was propelled
against the head of the deceased...

154
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:07,447
...or if his head moved against an object...

155
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:10,116
...or would both look the same?

156
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:11,701
The same.

157
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:16,623
If the head struck something narrow
and flat like the gunnel of the boat...

158
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,043
...or net roller, a fairlead, could that have...

159
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:24,214
If the head were moving fast enough,
but I don't see how it could be.

160
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:27,383
- Nonetheless, it is possible?
- Anything's possible.

161
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:31,054
Is it fair to say that you don't know
for certain which it was?

162
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:32,764
Didn't I just say...

163
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,724
I already said that.

164
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:37,894
But you are certain
that he died by drowning?

165
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:40,688
For the third time, yes.

166
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:45,235
- Can I say something here?
- No. You've been more than helpful.

167
00:21:45,735 --> 00:21:48,780
- No further questions.
- The witness may stand down.

168
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:52,617
We'll take our lunch recess now.
Reconvene at 1:30 sharp.

169
00:22:06,923 --> 00:22:08,049
How are the kids?

170
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:10,510
They made a snowman
to welcome you home.

171
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:14,347
Wow, that's great.

172
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:18,351
Just a few more days.

173
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:20,603
You look beautiful.

174
00:22:20,812 --> 00:22:22,814
I'm not going until you smile.

175
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:30,488
I think it's dangerous with this jury.

176
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:01,675
I'm sorry I kissed you on the beach.

177
00:27:07,098 --> 00:27:08,849
Let's just forget about it.

178
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:10,434
Forget it happened.

179
00:27:11,227 --> 00:27:13,687
Don't be sorry. I'm not.

180
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:20,069
Me neither.

181
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:58,607
Do you think this is wrong?

182
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:02,778
Your friends would.

183
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:05,197
Your dad would kill me.

184
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:08,450
My mom is the problem.

185
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,377
Stay away from white boys.

186
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:23,674
Marry one of your own kind
whose heart is strong and gentle.

187
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:29,930
The hairpin should be better placed
for a girl to find the right husband.

188
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,477
She teaches me to be Japanese.

189
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:37,396
What does that mean?

190
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:40,566
Dances, calligraphy, how to do my hair...

191
00:28:40,983 --> 00:28:42,860
...how to sit without moving.

192
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:45,404
What's the point of that?

193
00:28:48,824 --> 00:28:50,492
It's a part of grace.

194
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:53,037
You boys don't understand.

195
00:28:53,662 --> 00:28:55,122
Try me.

196
00:28:57,458 --> 00:29:00,210
She doesn't let me get away with anything.

197
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:03,631
It's the same for me.

198
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:05,591
Except it's my dad.

199
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:34,745
Know what would happen to an operator
who got his sleeve caught in the press?

200
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:36,580
Do you?

201
00:29:36,914 --> 00:29:41,126
He'd be popped open like a balloon,
splattered all over the walls.

202
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:46,632
Even his bones would disappear...

203
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:51,387
...to be discovered later on the floor
like strips of white confetti.

204
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:58,852
We'll make a newspaperman
out of you yet.

205
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,771
James!

206
00:32:24,748 --> 00:32:28,335
Ever wonder why the Strawberry Princess
is always a Japanese girl?

207
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:31,838
- Not really.
- Your father will explain it to you anyway.

208
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:34,716
It's sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice.

209
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:37,469
A concept of racial harmony, you know...

210
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:39,930
...and for a while it seems to work.

211
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:51,024
- That's the Fajita girl, isn't it?
- No, that's Hatsue Imada.

212
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:52,859
Yes, she's lovely.

213
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:16,299
Mrs. Heine...

214
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:18,343
...you were...

215
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:23,306
...acquainted with the defendant
and his family, were you not?

216
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:26,560
Him and his folks worked our land.

217
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,855
They lived in one of our cabins at first.

218
00:33:30,313 --> 00:33:34,818
So, the defendant knew the deceased,
your son, even then?

219
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,365
They fished together.

220
00:33:41,616 --> 00:33:43,160
They went to school.

221
00:33:43,493 --> 00:33:46,204
My boy Carl treated him
like a white person...

222
00:33:47,164 --> 00:33:49,249
...just like any friend.

223
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:55,589
So tell us, Mrs. Heine,
where did things go wrong?

224
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:03,430
My husband went and sold...

225
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,059
...his father seven acres of our land.

226
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:11,146
That fence to that fence
and then down to the road.

227
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,648
- That's seven acres, yes?
- No.

228
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:16,318
Where, to the edge of the mountain?

229
00:34:27,162 --> 00:34:30,040
All right. You drive a hard bargain.

230
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:35,337
And that's where all this trouble started.

231
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,422
But how can this be?

232
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:40,717
Since we all know...

233
00:34:40,884 --> 00:34:44,638
...that it is against the law
for Japanese-born to own land?

234
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:47,891
Even leasing is illegal.

235
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,186
So what was the point
of this payment plan?

236
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:54,898
Their kids were born here.
So, when the oldest...

237
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:57,984
...that one there...

238
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:01,363
...was 20 and the last payment got made...

239
00:35:01,696 --> 00:35:03,073
...he could own it.

240
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:05,742
But they missed their last two payments...

241
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:07,661
...so that was that.

242
00:35:07,744 --> 00:35:10,664
They missed their last two payments...

243
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:13,500
...after years of not missing one?

244
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:16,836
It was the war. They were gone.

245
00:35:17,754 --> 00:35:21,716
They were sent off to the camps
with all the other Japs.

246
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:26,763
We must leave everything.
If you like, work our fields.

247
00:35:26,846 --> 00:35:28,598
Sell berries, keep money.

248
00:35:28,765 --> 00:35:30,392
Otherwise they will rot.

249
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:34,354
- Today I have half money for next payment.
- Absolutely not.

250
00:35:34,437 --> 00:35:36,898
I'm not going to take your savings.

251
00:35:37,524 --> 00:35:38,775
You take the money.

252
00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:41,528
$125. I will send more
from where I'm going.

253
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:44,698
If it's not enough, sell my seven acres
and keep the money.

254
00:35:44,781 --> 00:35:46,950
I thought you were giving us those.

255
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:53,081
Didn't you come in here giving them away?
Now you want to make up the other half...

256
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:55,834
...in berries you expect us
to tend and pick?

257
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:58,294
Is that what you come here hoping for?

258
00:36:00,797 --> 00:36:02,632
You want more coffee?

259
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,509
No, thank you.

260
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:07,554
- Take the money.
- Etta has been rude to you.

261
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:10,432
For that, I apologize.

262
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:13,226
Keep this money.

263
00:36:14,978 --> 00:36:16,646
Those payments will work out....

264
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,399
The arrangement was,
those payments would be made...

265
00:36:20,316 --> 00:36:21,901
...somewhere down the road.

266
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:25,864
The road ended
when my husband passed away.

267
00:36:26,448 --> 00:36:28,658
I couldn't run the farm by myself...

268
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:30,326
...so I...

269
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,038
...sold all 30 acres to Ole Jurgensen.

270
00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:37,375
And for a fair price this time.

271
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:40,628
And I sent back their equity...

272
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:42,881
...to those Japs down to that camp...

273
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:45,925
...in California, which I didn't have to do.

274
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:48,970
So they got all their money back?

275
00:36:49,304 --> 00:36:50,597
That was that.

276
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:54,017
Did you hear from
the defendant's family again?

277
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,187
Yes, I heard from them.
I heard from that one there.

278
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:00,440
That one sitting there
just showed up at my door.

279
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:07,697
Carl's overseas. He's fighting the Japs.

280
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,826
- What is it you want?
- I came to get our land back.

281
00:37:12,202 --> 00:37:13,620
It isn't yours.

282
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,789
- It's Ole Jurgensen's now. Talk to him.
- I just did.

283
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,919
He didn't know it was ours.
You didn't tell him it was promised...

284
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:24,547
I'm supposed to tell him there's
an illegal contract muddling things up?

285
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:26,841
You people didn't make your payments.

286
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:29,594
In America, the bank comes in
and repossesses your land.

287
00:37:29,677 --> 00:37:32,388
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Nothing illegal.

288
00:37:32,555 --> 00:37:34,140
Wrong is a different matter.

289
00:37:34,224 --> 00:37:35,141
Get out!

290
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:37,560
You took advantage of the fact
that we were gone!

291
00:37:37,644 --> 00:37:41,231
You sold the land from under us
while I was fighting the Nazis!

292
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:07,919
Your witness.

293
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:14,967
Just three questions.

294
00:40:16,844 --> 00:40:19,972
The Miyamoto family
bought your seven acres...

295
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:22,725
...for $4,500?

296
00:40:23,518 --> 00:40:26,354
They tried to.
They defaulted on their payments.

297
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:28,564
Second question:

298
00:40:28,814 --> 00:40:31,400
What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?

299
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:33,402
$1,000.

300
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,321
I guess...

301
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:41,285
...that makes what would have been
$4,500 into $7,000, doesn't it?

302
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:43,746
So if you sent the equity back...

303
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:47,041
...you had a profit of $2,500?

304
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:50,086
Is that your third question?

305
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:51,671
It is.

306
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:54,006
You've done your math right.

307
00:40:54,882 --> 00:40:56,676
You too, Mrs. Heine.

308
00:40:57,677 --> 00:40:59,136
No further questions.

309
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,680
You may step down.

310
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:05,268
Before we adjourn for the day,
there's one more thing.

311
00:41:08,396 --> 00:41:10,690
This court takes judicial notice of the fact...

312
00:41:10,773 --> 00:41:14,944
...that tomorrow is the ninth anniversary
of the attack on Pearl Harbor...

313
00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:18,197
...which has no relationship
whatsoever to this trial.

314
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:21,742
Which is why I mention it.

315
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:26,038
9:30 tomorrow morning.

316
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:27,873
Stay warm.

317
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:33,754
They plowed clear out to the point.
What's the big attraction?

318
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:37,842
I'm checking lighthouse records to see
if it's the biggest snowstorm in history.

319
00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:39,552
Where were you in '29?

320
00:41:39,635 --> 00:41:41,387
That was a snowstorm.

321
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:43,681
- Real blizzard.
- Is that right?

322
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:47,309
If you don't believe me,
check those Coast Guard records.

323
00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:49,437
There should be a story in it.

324
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:53,232
Scribble, scribble, while the rest
of us have to work for a living.

325
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:55,026
Always a pleasure.

326
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:56,003
Everything's dated.
We do things by dates, mainly.

327
00:42:56,879 --> 00:43:01,383
Radio transmissions, shipping logs,
weather reports. The whole nine yards.

328
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,886
Those stacks go clear back to Noah.

329
00:43:03,969 --> 00:43:06,305
Not that anyone ever pays them any mind.

330
00:43:06,388 --> 00:43:08,641
You monitor all radio activity?
Fishermen...

331
00:43:08,724 --> 00:43:10,351
- ... that sort of thing?
- Pretty much.

332
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:14,438
Anything significant anyway.
Some of these guys never shut up.

333
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:16,565
Well, just yell if you need me.

334
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:26,534
Left is as good as right.

335
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:29,036
Your move.

336
00:44:08,033 --> 00:44:10,703
"Correcting course via Ship Channel Bank.

337
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,625
"S.S. West Corona...

338
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:20,421
"... pilot relays position
somewhere off south buoy 56.

339
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:25,759
"At 1:48 a.m., S.S. West Corona made
a corrective dogleg to the northwest.

340
00:44:25,884 --> 00:44:29,054
"Ship's navigator took
three insurance readings. "

341
00:44:53,287 --> 00:44:54,663
Hey, Levant?

342
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,460
Here's the shipping channel.

343
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:02,588
Any freighter off course
can dogleg back through here.

344
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:06,759
- That happens if we're really socked in.
- Don't the gillnetters work off this bank?

345
00:45:06,842 --> 00:45:10,929
Not even they're crazy enough
to hang around in a bad fog. They get out.

346
00:45:12,473 --> 00:45:14,767
What's this got to do
with your snowstorm story?

347
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,311
Nothing. Just curious, that's all.

348
00:45:18,979 --> 00:45:20,689
That doesn't make him guilty.

349
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:24,777
- This island ought to be ashamed.
- It's not as simple as that.

350
00:45:25,402 --> 00:45:28,822
I followed every second of it.
The evidence sounds very solid.

351
00:45:28,906 --> 00:45:31,617
This prosecutor has his facts all lined up.

352
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,119
You haven't heard the defense case yet.

353
00:45:34,787 --> 00:45:37,331
You sound as if you're ready to hang him.

354
00:45:37,873 --> 00:45:39,166
Besides...

355
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,376
...you can't depend on facts...

356
00:45:41,627 --> 00:45:44,213
- ... not by themselves.
- What else is there?

357
00:45:44,797 --> 00:45:45,964
Emotions?

358
00:45:46,507 --> 00:45:49,384
Facts you can cling to.
Emotions just float away.

359
00:45:51,136 --> 00:45:52,429
Then let them.

360
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:15,410
I love you.

361
00:46:23,418 --> 00:46:25,003
You smell like cedar.

362
00:46:26,255 --> 00:46:27,714
So do you.

363
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:03,083
I can hear your heart beating.

364
00:47:08,714 --> 00:47:10,048
"Dear Ishmael...

365
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:13,677
"... I can't think of anything more painful...

366
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:16,430
"... than writing this letter to you.

367
00:47:17,806 --> 00:47:21,310
"I feel I have to tell you the truth. "

368
00:47:50,172 --> 00:47:54,259
I know it's late. I went by the lighthouse
and I found a report that stated that...

369
00:47:54,343 --> 00:47:58,930
Just came across some information.
It may be relevant to Kazuo's case.

370
00:48:00,766 --> 00:48:04,227
...a giant freighter passed through
at the exact time that Carl died.

371
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:07,272
I think it's something
that should have been discussed.

372
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:12,694
I love you.

373
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:39,638
Not just Hawaii.

374
00:48:40,055 --> 00:48:44,101
They're attacking all over the Pacific.
The whole fleet's destroyed.

375
00:48:46,436 --> 00:48:51,399
The FBl's in Seattle arresting Jap traitors.
Spies and everything.

376
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:55,821
The defense commissioner
reckons anything can happen.

377
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:58,073
There'll be a blackout.

378
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:01,618
These people are our neighbors.

379
00:49:01,701 --> 00:49:04,579
Make sure you paper up your windows...

380
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,915
...so the Japs won't find us.

381
00:49:06,998 --> 00:49:09,751
They've sent their sons into the U.S. army.

382
00:49:11,628 --> 00:49:13,463
They're no more an enemy than...

383
00:49:13,547 --> 00:49:18,134
...our fellow islanders of German
or Italian descent.

384
00:49:18,677 --> 00:49:20,220
You get the message?

385
00:49:20,428 --> 00:49:22,097
Mr. Lamberson?

386
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:26,309
We get the message.

387
00:49:27,185 --> 00:49:31,147
Let us live that when it is over we can
look each other in the eye and know...

388
00:49:31,815 --> 00:49:33,900
...that we have acted honorably.

389
00:49:44,578 --> 00:49:46,371
Set that for me, would you?

390
00:49:56,172 --> 00:49:57,882
"Let us live...

391
00:49:59,134 --> 00:50:00,969
"... that when it is over...

392
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:05,015
"... we can look each other...

393
00:50:06,016 --> 00:50:07,350
"... in the eye...

394
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,437
"... and know...

395
00:50:10,937 --> 00:50:12,564
"... that we...

396
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:14,399
"... have acted...

397
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:16,151
"... honorably."

398
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:22,032
The FBI has arrested Mr. Shirasaki...

399
00:50:22,282 --> 00:50:24,909
...and his family can't leave their house.

400
00:50:27,162 --> 00:50:29,080
Everything will be all right.

401
00:50:30,624 --> 00:50:32,042
I promise.

402
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,108
We are loyal.

403
00:50:58,026 --> 00:51:01,363
- It's for our defense.
- Everyone on the island has these things.

404
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:04,866
They'll hold onto this stuff for a while
then ship it back to you.

405
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:06,659
Nothing to worry about.

406
00:51:07,577 --> 00:51:09,371
You folks have been real polite.

407
00:51:09,454 --> 00:51:11,790
We'll be out of here in just a second.

408
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:14,042
That's very nice.

409
00:51:14,751 --> 00:51:16,920
From the old country, it appears.

410
00:51:17,128 --> 00:51:19,089
Very high class.

411
00:51:21,758 --> 00:51:23,134
These are...

412
00:51:23,551 --> 00:51:25,220
...real nice things.

413
00:51:28,223 --> 00:51:30,392
They'll take special care of...

414
00:51:34,604 --> 00:51:37,065
...any old-country stuff we have to take.

415
00:51:58,753 --> 00:52:00,338
Strawberry Princess?

416
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:03,341
You must've been flattered by that.

417
00:52:05,135 --> 00:52:07,554
Crawford, guess what was in the shed?

418
00:52:08,054 --> 00:52:09,347
Dynamite.

419
00:52:09,556 --> 00:52:11,266
Twenty-four sticks.

420
00:52:12,809 --> 00:52:14,561
That's for tree stumps...

421
00:52:14,644 --> 00:52:16,229
...for clearing land.

422
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:18,940
Maybe, but this is still bad, you see.

423
00:52:19,023 --> 00:52:22,318
It's illegal contraband.
You're supposed to turn that in.

424
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:25,154
We've gotta arrest you
and bring you to Seattle.

425
00:52:25,238 --> 00:52:29,158
We don't need those. Mr. Imada-san
is a class act, a real gentleman.

426
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:32,537
You can't do this.
He's done nothing wrong!

427
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,207
Best for an honest man
to clear his name for good.

428
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:39,961
Excuse me, would you mind?

429
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,084
Journalism is the facts.

430
00:53:20,168 --> 00:53:24,255
Which facts? You can't print them all.
Journalism is making choices.

431
00:53:24,881 --> 00:53:26,883
Culling out what's unimportant.

432
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,218
You know what happens to Jap lovers?

433
00:53:29,302 --> 00:53:32,972
Jap lovers get their balls cut off
and shoved down their throats.

434
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:40,605
Better watch your step.

435
00:53:45,443 --> 00:53:47,945
- It's unbelievable to me.
- I don't know, Mom.

436
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:52,492
The PTA honors 23 women. Dad singles
out three names and they're all Japanese.

437
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:54,494
That's not journalism. It's propaganda.

438
00:53:54,577 --> 00:53:57,288
- This is dangerous, Arthur.
- It'll blow over.

439
00:53:57,372 --> 00:53:59,082
Did you see the letters?

440
00:54:02,919 --> 00:54:05,838
"Seems like you're favoring the Japs, Art.

441
00:54:06,672 --> 00:54:09,675
"Your newspaper's an insult
to all white Americans.

442
00:54:09,884 --> 00:54:12,929
- "Please cancel my subscription."
- What are you gonna do?

443
00:54:13,012 --> 00:54:14,514
Send him a refund.

444
00:54:16,182 --> 00:54:19,018
What happened to the Petersen ad
I put together?

445
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,937
They pulled out.

446
00:54:21,396 --> 00:54:23,064
So did the gas station...

447
00:54:23,147 --> 00:54:25,441
...and Larson, and the cafe.

448
00:54:27,735 --> 00:54:28,861
What now?

449
00:54:35,868 --> 00:54:38,329
Print four pages instead of eight.

450
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:08,109
"Please tell Sumiko to help her mother
with the garden work.

451
00:55:11,571 --> 00:55:14,282
"We are digging trenches
for a water system.

452
00:55:20,204 --> 00:55:24,083
"I am folding and ironing clothing
in the laundry."

453
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:27,879
The hajukin,
they are no better than animals!

454
00:55:28,004 --> 00:55:29,422
Not all of them.

455
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:35,386
How would you know?

456
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:40,141
- I live here among them. So do you!
- You speak with great assurance.

457
00:55:42,018 --> 00:55:44,020
The words fly from your mouth.

458
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:46,355
I don't care what you say.

459
00:55:46,522 --> 00:55:49,901
Do you hear me?
I don't want to be Japanese!

460
00:55:57,408 --> 00:55:58,784
Marry me, Hatsue.

461
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:06,167
Please say yes.

462
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:07,793
We'll leave here.

463
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,837
Are you crazy?

464
00:56:11,213 --> 00:56:13,090
I want you to marry me.

465
01:04:22,537 --> 01:04:25,332
So, Dr. Whitman, sir, you found...

466
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,418
...the blood on the gaff...

467
01:04:29,294 --> 01:04:31,421
...was not fish blood at all.

468
01:04:32,297 --> 01:04:34,257
It was human, yes?

469
01:04:35,383 --> 01:04:38,678
- Type B positive.
- Carl Heine's type.

470
01:04:39,721 --> 01:04:43,391
Yes, but you can't say with any certainty
that the blood was his.

471
01:04:43,892 --> 01:04:45,894
No, but as I say the...

472
01:04:46,102 --> 01:04:47,687
...type is rare.

473
01:04:47,896 --> 01:04:50,732
Ten percent of Caucasian males.
Whereas the...

474
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:54,444
- ... defendant is type O.
- Yes, sir, you told us.

475
01:04:55,529 --> 01:04:58,782
No one is contesting that.
But you also told us that...

476
01:04:58,907 --> 01:05:01,993
...you scraped the dry blood
from the handle of the gaff.

477
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:07,540
An object was propelled against....

478
01:05:07,624 --> 01:05:10,126
...found on Carl Heine's boat....

479
01:05:10,418 --> 01:05:12,087
But, the strange thing is....

480
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:13,838
You asked me to explain it...

481
01:05:16,091 --> 01:05:19,970
The State calls Mrs. Susan Marie Heine.

482
01:05:49,165 --> 01:05:53,503
Can you think back for me
to the morning of September 8?

483
01:05:54,004 --> 01:05:56,881
The morning after your husband...

484
01:05:58,008 --> 01:06:00,260
...purchased the Jurgensen farm.

485
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:05,432
One week before his death.

486
01:06:50,477 --> 01:06:54,647
Did the defendant come calling that day
to speak to your husband?

487
01:07:07,744 --> 01:07:09,204
It's no big deal.

488
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:12,248
It's a long story.

489
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,211
He wants to buy seven of Ole's acres.

490
01:07:16,294 --> 01:07:18,087
The ones his family had.

491
01:07:19,464 --> 01:07:21,925
You know that thing
my mother talks about?

492
01:07:22,008 --> 01:07:24,886
Had a feeling it was that.
What did you tell him?

493
01:07:24,969 --> 01:07:28,181
What could I tell him?
There's my mother to think about.

494
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:32,602
I said I'd...

495
01:07:32,894 --> 01:07:35,522
...think it over, and have a talk with you.

496
01:07:36,314 --> 01:07:38,233
He go away angry?

497
01:07:40,235 --> 01:07:44,405
- I couldn't tell. You can't read Japs.
- Don't say that.

498
01:07:45,073 --> 01:07:47,742
You don't mean that. You fished together.

499
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:49,911
You and he were friends.

500
01:07:51,746 --> 01:07:53,373
We were kids then.

501
01:08:16,437 --> 01:08:18,940
So your husband said he'd think it over.

502
01:08:19,857 --> 01:08:21,776
He encouraged Mr. Miyamoto...

503
01:08:22,193 --> 01:08:23,903
...to believe he might...

504
01:08:24,821 --> 01:08:26,948
Well, I wouldn't say encouraged.

505
01:08:28,283 --> 01:08:30,285
But he didn't say no, did he?

506
01:08:30,535 --> 01:08:32,745
He didn't say no hope existed.

507
01:08:33,538 --> 01:08:35,039
Not in those words.

508
01:08:36,332 --> 01:08:39,502
So, the defendant was encouraged to hope.

509
01:08:44,424 --> 01:08:48,678
How could anyone know what he hopes for
or anything else he's thinking?

510
01:08:50,179 --> 01:08:52,140
But, Mrs. Heine...

511
01:08:53,891 --> 01:08:55,560
...you really think that's fair?

512
01:08:55,643 --> 01:08:59,689
- Objection. That's totally irrelevant.
- There's nothing more relevant!

513
01:08:59,772 --> 01:09:01,649
You know that as well as anybody.

514
01:09:01,774 --> 01:09:03,443
Gentlemen, please!

515
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,320
Back to your corners.

516
01:09:05,403 --> 01:09:09,032
Mrs. Heine, I'm very sorry
for this little interruption.

517
01:09:10,825 --> 01:09:12,410
No further questions.

518
01:09:12,744 --> 01:09:15,580
Thank you, Mrs. Heine.
You may step down.

519
01:09:18,124 --> 01:09:20,668
The State rests, Your Honor.

520
01:09:22,712 --> 01:09:24,797
Very well. Mr. Gudmundsson...

521
01:09:25,006 --> 01:09:27,592
...the defense may call its first witness.

522
01:09:28,634 --> 01:09:32,055
The defense calls Mrs. Hatsue Miyamoto.

523
01:09:45,777 --> 01:09:47,987
My husband came home excited.

524
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:51,199
He woke me with the news.

525
01:09:51,741 --> 01:09:55,244
He told me he helped Carl at sea...

526
01:09:56,704 --> 01:09:59,207
...and Carl had agreed to sell us the land.

527
01:10:00,249 --> 01:10:02,919
We started making plans right away.

528
01:10:05,004 --> 01:10:09,050
When did you first learn
that Carl Heine had drowned?

529
01:10:13,137 --> 01:10:14,889
1:00 that afternoon...

530
01:10:15,348 --> 01:10:17,475
...from a clerk at Petersen's.

531
01:10:27,276 --> 01:10:29,529
- What is it?
- Carl Heine's dead.

532
01:10:29,612 --> 01:10:31,823
It's all over the island.

533
01:10:32,782 --> 01:10:36,410
- What do you mean?
- He drowned. They found him in his net.

534
01:10:37,495 --> 01:10:41,415
- Poor Susan Marie and those kids.
- I can't believe it.

535
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:51,759
Gotta get to the boat, replace that battery.

536
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:55,930
- What are you talking about?
- I was on his boat last night, remember?

537
01:10:56,389 --> 01:10:58,558
But you were helping him. Tell the sheriff.

538
01:10:58,641 --> 01:11:00,017
Are you kidding?

539
01:11:00,643 --> 01:11:02,353
You think they're gonna believe me?

540
01:11:02,436 --> 01:11:04,146
It's the truth, isn't it?

541
01:11:04,313 --> 01:11:06,941
That's right. Let'sjust leave it at that.

542
01:11:16,325 --> 01:11:20,413
Your husband came home agitated
after being at sea with the deceased?

543
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,292
I said "excited"...

544
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:26,294
...not "agitated."

545
01:11:26,711 --> 01:11:29,380
He was excited in the sense
of being overjoyed.

546
01:11:29,463 --> 01:11:31,132
You were...

547
01:11:32,091 --> 01:11:34,969
...overjoyed yourself to hear the news?

548
01:11:36,929 --> 01:11:38,848
Happy for him, and relieved.

549
01:11:40,933 --> 01:11:43,936
So then you and your husband,
you must've called...

550
01:11:45,438 --> 01:11:49,025
...friends and relatives to tell them
the happy news, yes?

551
01:11:50,568 --> 01:11:51,944
No.

552
01:11:53,863 --> 01:11:55,281
Really?

553
01:11:57,825 --> 01:12:00,828
You didn't call your family
about starting a new life?

554
01:12:00,911 --> 01:12:04,915
Your husband never tells his family
the family honor's been vindicated?

555
01:12:07,877 --> 01:12:09,962
We decided not to tell anyone...

556
01:12:10,421 --> 01:12:13,883
...until we signed papers
in case something went wrong.

557
01:12:17,303 --> 01:12:18,804
Then something did.

558
01:12:20,264 --> 01:12:22,641
Carl Heine was found dead...

559
01:12:24,435 --> 01:12:26,187
...with his head crushed.

560
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,525
And then, what was there to call about?

561
01:12:31,609 --> 01:12:33,569
Everything was up in the air.

562
01:12:36,864 --> 01:12:38,532
"Up in the air."

563
01:12:39,617 --> 01:12:41,285
Was that your reaction?

564
01:12:41,994 --> 01:12:43,829
So, apart from your concern...

565
01:12:43,913 --> 01:12:46,957
...about a land deal evaporating,
what was your reaction...

566
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:48,876
...to the news that a husband...

567
01:12:48,959 --> 01:12:52,963
...and father to small children was dead
with his skull bashed in?

568
01:12:54,673 --> 01:12:58,219
If you mean to imply
that we didn't care about Carl's death...

569
01:12:58,803 --> 01:13:01,555
...that is wrong and insulting.

570
01:13:02,681 --> 01:13:03,933
I see.

571
01:13:05,309 --> 01:13:07,269
Did it occur to you to come forward...

572
01:13:07,353 --> 01:13:10,815
...and tell Sheriff Moran
about the encounter in the fog?

573
01:13:10,898 --> 01:13:12,942
The dead battery, was it?

574
01:13:14,318 --> 01:13:15,861
We discussed that...

575
01:13:17,071 --> 01:13:18,697
...and decided not to.

576
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,574
Why not?

577
01:13:23,035 --> 01:13:24,829
Because things looked bad.

578
01:13:25,121 --> 01:13:26,330
Very bad!

579
01:13:26,956 --> 01:13:28,874
Kazuo and I knew that.

580
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:32,628
We thought he could end up here
on trial for murder.

581
01:13:33,128 --> 01:13:35,631
And that's exactly what has happened.

582
01:13:38,759 --> 01:13:43,305
But if truth was on your side,
whatever were you worried about?

583
01:13:45,599 --> 01:13:46,809
Trials...

584
01:13:47,309 --> 01:13:49,270
...aren't only about truth...

585
01:13:50,396 --> 01:13:52,898
- ... even though they should be.
- You hid the truth...

586
01:13:52,982 --> 01:13:55,401
...deliberately. You lied, didn't you?

587
01:13:56,068 --> 01:13:58,362
Coming forward seemed like a mistake.

588
01:13:58,445 --> 01:14:01,949
Doesn't it seem to you
that your mistake was in being deceitful...

589
01:14:02,032 --> 01:14:06,287
...and deliberately concealing information
during a sheriff's investigation?

590
01:14:09,874 --> 01:14:11,917
It seems human to me.

591
01:14:13,502 --> 01:14:16,964
I suppose you mean
that this somehow excuses your lies?

592
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:24,597
I don't know.

593
01:14:27,933 --> 01:14:29,560
I don't understand.

594
01:14:29,977 --> 01:14:32,146
I'm completely at a loss.

595
01:14:33,897 --> 01:14:37,151
How on earth can you expect
any of us to believe you now?

596
01:14:37,276 --> 01:14:40,029
- Question withdrawn, Your Honor.
- Wait a minute!

597
01:14:40,112 --> 01:14:42,906
- I haven't had a chance.
- No further questions.

598
01:14:43,616 --> 01:14:45,534
That's enough, Mrs. Miyamoto.

599
01:14:45,618 --> 01:14:47,119
Not another word.

600
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:52,416
The fact that you wish to give
Mr. Hooks a piece of your mind...

601
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:54,793
...that just isn't allowed.

602
01:14:56,962 --> 01:14:58,172
Very well.

603
01:14:58,297 --> 01:15:00,549
Mr. Gudmundsson, will you redirect...

604
01:15:03,844 --> 01:15:06,764
Under the circumstances,
we will adjourn early.

605
01:15:07,264 --> 01:15:09,224
9:30 tomorrow.

606
01:16:49,908 --> 01:16:52,202
This is a very fine car.

607
01:16:52,494 --> 01:16:54,663
Much better than the new ones.

608
01:16:55,539 --> 01:16:57,499
Well, it was my father's.

609
01:16:58,458 --> 01:17:00,294
He was a good man.

610
01:17:04,131 --> 01:17:07,926
I know it's caused you trouble,
but the snow's beautiful, isn't it?

611
01:17:09,094 --> 01:17:11,388
Yes, very beautiful.

612
01:17:18,061 --> 01:17:20,022
This trial is unfair.

613
01:17:20,606 --> 01:17:23,775
Your father would have written
about that in his paper.

614
01:17:24,234 --> 01:17:25,944
What would he have said?

615
01:17:27,154 --> 01:17:28,989
How this trial is wrong!

616
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:31,325
The whole thing is unfair!

617
01:17:31,658 --> 01:17:34,411
Sometimes I think unfairness is...

618
01:17:36,121 --> 01:17:37,539
...a part of things.

619
01:17:38,874 --> 01:17:42,669
I'm not talking about the whole universe.
I'm talking about people.

620
01:17:43,378 --> 01:17:46,089
The coroner, that prosecutor.

621
01:17:49,676 --> 01:17:51,386
You could do something to help.

622
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:53,138
Is that what you think?

623
01:17:56,975 --> 01:17:59,061
Maybe I should write an article.

624
01:18:01,563 --> 01:18:03,231
About unfairness.

625
01:18:04,941 --> 01:18:07,944
About all the unfair things
people do to each other.

626
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,027
Excuse me, Mrs. Chambers.

627
01:20:13,403 --> 01:20:17,073
The Japanese people of the island
are saddened by this loss.

628
01:20:18,074 --> 01:20:22,871
Your husband was a man of great
fairness and compassion for others.

629
01:20:23,246 --> 01:20:25,624
A friend to us and to all people.

630
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:30,378
We know you will follow
in his footsteps, Ishmael...

631
01:20:30,795 --> 01:20:32,547
...and honor his legacy.

632
01:20:34,007 --> 01:20:35,467
Thank you.

633
01:21:06,081 --> 01:21:07,874
You should stay the night.

634
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:11,670
- Don't drive back through this.
- I've got an early start.

635
01:21:21,137 --> 01:21:23,515
This room is full of ghosts, isn't it?

636
01:21:27,185 --> 01:21:29,604
I hate to see you this way.

637
01:21:30,689 --> 01:21:32,524
I don't know what you mean.

638
01:21:33,358 --> 01:21:35,235
She's married, Ishmael.

639
01:21:40,156 --> 01:21:43,993
Look, it's awfully cold in here.
Let's talk in the kitchen.

640
01:21:44,494 --> 01:21:46,663
I don't wanna talk about anything.

641
01:21:47,038 --> 01:21:50,875
- You're just like your father.
- I'm not just like my father!

642
01:21:50,959 --> 01:21:53,670
I know everyone wishes I was.
When they look at me...

643
01:21:53,753 --> 01:21:57,590
...I can hear them thinking,
"He's only half the man his father was."

644
01:21:59,968 --> 01:22:02,846
I was only going to say
he never minded the cold.

645
01:22:09,477 --> 01:22:12,021
It's not such a terrible thing...

646
01:22:13,106 --> 01:22:14,941
...being your father's son.

647
01:24:44,549 --> 01:24:46,718
Pardon us, Your Majesty.

648
01:24:50,221 --> 01:24:52,140
Who's your lover boy?

649
01:24:54,392 --> 01:24:55,935
Give it back!

650
01:25:13,619 --> 01:25:17,373
Does this explain your eagerness
to walk in the woods every day?

651
01:25:21,544 --> 01:25:22,837
Does it?

652
01:25:23,796 --> 01:25:25,214
Answer me!

653
01:25:46,194 --> 01:25:47,570
"Dear Ishmael...

654
01:25:50,573 --> 01:25:53,117
"... I can't think of anything more painful...

655
01:25:53,659 --> 01:25:55,953
"... than writing this letter to you.

656
01:25:57,205 --> 01:26:00,583
"I feel I have to tell you the truth.

657
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:04,921
"When we met the last time
in the cedar tree...

658
01:26:06,672 --> 01:26:09,342

01:26:12,929 --> 01:26:15,556
"... and I felt your body
move against mine...

660
01:26:17,808 --> 01:26:19,685

663

I would have to tell you so.

664
01:26:32,531 --> 01:26:34,033
"And now...

666
01:26:37,078 --> 01:26:38,913
"... I am telling you.

667
01:26:53,594 --> 01:26:56,389
"This is the last time I'll write to you.

668
01:26:58,015 --> 01:26:59,976
"I'm not yours anymore.

669
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:05,106
"I don't love you, Ishmael.

01:28:47,917 --> 01:28:50,669
"... and I didn't love you
at the same moment.

695
01:29:46,308 --> 01:29:47,559
"You must live.

696
01:29:55,943 --> 01:29:57,861
"I must say good-bye to you.

697
01:30:03,158 --> 01:30:06,537
"I know you will do great things
in this world.

698
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:10,874
"You have a gentle heart.

699
01:30:13,627 --> 01:30:15,212
"A good heart.

700
01:30:18,507 --> 01:30:20,759
"I will never forget you...

701
01:30:23,846 --> 01:30:27,224
"... and the time we spent together. "

702
01:30:36,233 --> 01:30:37,651
Scissors.

703
01:30:41,613 --> 01:30:43,532
Retractor.

704
01:30:44,992 --> 01:30:46,535
Reticular clamp.

705
01:30:48,078 --> 01:30:50,247
Fuckin' Jap bitch.

706
01:31:57,523 --> 01:31:59,900
- They're sending you to Europe?
- I think so.

707
01:31:59,983 --> 01:32:02,319
Why did you have to volunteer?

708
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,252
They'll hear everything.

709
01:32:20,295 --> 01:32:22,256
Wouldn't some music be nice?

710
01:33:20,022 --> 01:33:22,190
Have you ever done this before?

711
01:33:22,482 --> 01:33:23,942
Never.

712
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:26,278
You're my only.

713
01:34:00,103 --> 01:34:02,731
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

714
01:34:02,814 --> 01:34:05,525
...and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

715
01:34:05,692 --> 01:34:06,902
I do.

716
01:34:07,194 --> 01:34:10,030
I heard an air horn
and saw a lantern in the fog.

717
01:34:10,113 --> 01:34:11,281
That you, Miyamoto?

718
01:34:11,364 --> 01:34:13,033
And another one in Carl's hand.

719
01:34:13,116 --> 01:34:14,576
What's up, Carl?

720
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,789
Both my batteries are drawn down.

721
01:34:19,498 --> 01:34:21,458
The generator belts were loose.

722
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:24,419
Lantern and air horn's all I got.
I'm dead here.

723
01:34:26,004 --> 01:34:27,297
No problem.

724
01:34:28,173 --> 01:34:30,967
We'll pull one of my batteries
and get you started.

725
01:34:32,677 --> 01:34:36,515
That thing's big, but it'll fit
if I bang the flange out of the way.

726
01:34:36,681 --> 01:34:38,725
We can use this to hammer with.

727
01:34:39,059 --> 01:34:42,395
I can't imagine why you kept this story
from the sheriff.

728
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:43,647
Why?

729
01:34:44,064 --> 01:34:45,774
I didn't have a lawyer.

730
01:34:46,107 --> 01:34:49,611
Even after you had an attorney,
you still claimed to know nothing.

731
01:34:49,694 --> 01:34:51,279
You claim not to have seen Carl.

732
01:34:51,363 --> 01:34:53,573
- Am I correct?
- Yes, initially.

733
01:34:57,619 --> 01:34:58,954
"Initially."

734
01:34:59,496 --> 01:35:02,332
That's an interesting word.
You'd been arrested.

735
01:35:02,749 --> 01:35:05,460
You had a lawyer.
You still claimed ignorance.

736
01:35:05,544 --> 01:35:08,547
I should've told everything right away.

737
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:10,549
"Should've told everything."

738
01:35:11,466 --> 01:35:13,802
Meaning you should've told the truth.

739
01:35:14,594 --> 01:35:16,304
But is that the truth?

740
01:35:17,681 --> 01:35:20,183
The whole truth? Is it?

741
01:35:21,226 --> 01:35:23,270
You don't wanna hear the whole truth.

742
01:35:23,562 --> 01:35:25,438
Why don't you try me?

743
01:35:30,485 --> 01:35:33,029
The whole truth is, I wanted to kill him.

744
01:35:35,532 --> 01:35:37,200
But did you?

745
01:35:45,417 --> 01:35:46,918
Nothing to say?

746
01:36:16,614 --> 01:36:18,825
It'll take me a while to charge up.

747
01:36:20,744 --> 01:36:21,995
We'll catch up on the dock.

748
01:36:22,078 --> 01:36:23,788
Nothing to say?

749
01:36:25,665 --> 01:36:29,544
- I didn't know that was a question.
- My apologies. Do you regret...

750
01:36:29,627 --> 01:36:32,047
- ... not telling the truth?
- I have told the truth.

751
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:35,633
You mean this morning.
The battery story. That one is the truth?

752
01:36:35,717 --> 01:36:37,927
- That's a question, sir.
- Yes.

753
01:36:39,346 --> 01:36:41,348
And I told it long before this morning.

754
01:36:41,431 --> 01:36:44,100
You said in your testimony...

755
01:36:45,018 --> 01:36:46,144
...that...

756
01:36:46,394 --> 01:36:49,898
..."I slept until 1:30
when my wife woke me with the news.

757
01:36:50,315 --> 01:36:53,693
"We talked for a while,
then I went straight to my boat."

758
01:36:54,569 --> 01:36:56,780
You didn't go anywhere else
but to your boat.

759
01:36:56,863 --> 01:36:58,656
- Is that the truth?
- Yes.

760
01:36:59,574 --> 01:37:03,578
The sheriff found two batteries
in your well.

761
01:37:03,703 --> 01:37:06,372
If, as you claim, you left one with Carl...

762
01:37:06,831 --> 01:37:08,291
...how's that possible?

763
01:37:08,374 --> 01:37:10,335
I had a spare battery in my shed.

764
01:37:10,418 --> 01:37:13,254
I brought it down and put it in
before the sheriff came.

765
01:37:13,338 --> 01:37:15,882
Conveniently, in your shed.

766
01:37:17,217 --> 01:37:20,637
Why does the battery story change
every time a new question's raised?

767
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:24,224
You asked me if I went straight
to the boat. I did, with the battery.

768
01:37:24,307 --> 01:37:29,229
And the new line? Was that in your shed?
You have a regular chandlery in there?

769
01:37:29,395 --> 01:37:32,273
You have no answer,
you sit in silence with no expression?

770
01:37:32,357 --> 01:37:34,943
You're a hard man to trust, sir.

771
01:37:35,026 --> 01:37:36,277
Objection!

772
01:37:36,361 --> 01:37:37,737
Sustained.

773
01:37:38,321 --> 01:37:40,406
You know better than that.

774
01:37:40,865 --> 01:37:44,452
Either ask questions that count
for something or sit down.

775
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:52,001
Shame on you.

776
01:37:56,089 --> 01:37:58,049
No further questions.

777
01:38:07,016 --> 01:38:09,894
Believing that Etta Heine's son...

778
01:38:10,436 --> 01:38:14,232
...would never sell him the land,
land that in his mind...

779
01:38:15,108 --> 01:38:16,901
...belonged to his family.

780
01:38:17,527 --> 01:38:19,696
His only chance to get that land...

781
01:38:19,779 --> 01:38:22,282
...would be to eliminate Carl Heine.

782
01:38:22,448 --> 01:38:27,036
Thus believing that cold-blooded murder
was justified...

783
01:38:27,996 --> 01:38:29,372
...he trailed Carl.

784
01:38:29,497 --> 01:38:34,168
He strikes the treacherous blow
he'd been trained to strike by his father.

785
01:38:34,502 --> 01:38:36,254
After a series of lies...

786
01:38:38,131 --> 01:38:40,717
...the defendant at last admits
he was there...

787
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,219
...alone on the boat in the fog.

788
01:38:44,137 --> 01:38:47,765
Carl Heine's blood on his fishing gaff.

789
01:38:48,808 --> 01:38:50,143
Seven acres.

790
01:38:52,103 --> 01:38:55,648
I just wonder what you'd pay for 'em.
Just curious, is all.

791
01:38:55,773 --> 01:38:57,734
What are you selling 'em for?

792
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:59,611
Did I say I was sellin'?

793
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,738
If I was, I guess I'd have to...

794
01:39:01,821 --> 01:39:05,992
...figure you want 'em real bad.
I ought to charge a small fortune, maybe.

795
01:39:16,085 --> 01:39:19,797
All right, I'm sorry about it, okay?
About the whole damn mess.

796
01:39:26,054 --> 01:39:27,513
$1,200 an acre.

797
01:39:31,809 --> 01:39:34,729
That's what I paid Ole.
You got no choice on that.

798
01:39:36,689 --> 01:39:38,399
We'll sign off tomorrow.

799
01:39:38,566 --> 01:39:40,818
Look clearly at the defendant.

800
01:39:41,861 --> 01:39:44,822
See the truth self-evident in him...

801
01:39:45,406 --> 01:39:47,742
...and in the facts of this case.

802
01:39:49,118 --> 01:39:51,662
Look into his eyes, ladies and gentlemen.

803
01:39:53,623 --> 01:39:55,541
Consider his face.

804
01:39:56,876 --> 01:39:58,461
Ask yourself...

805
01:40:02,757 --> 01:40:04,342
...each one of you:

806
01:40:08,513 --> 01:40:11,682
"What is my duty as a citizen
of this community?

807
01:40:14,727 --> 01:40:16,104
"Of this country?

808
01:40:19,107 --> 01:40:20,441
"As an American?"

809
01:40:40,962 --> 01:40:44,632
There's no evidence of anger at Carl,
much less rage...

810
01:40:45,299 --> 01:40:47,218
...much less murderous rage.

811
01:40:48,344 --> 01:40:50,972
No reason for premeditation.

812
01:40:51,389 --> 01:40:53,808
No evidence of it anywhere.

813
01:40:55,476 --> 01:40:56,894
He had asked...

814
01:40:57,311 --> 01:41:01,899
...his childhood friend to sell him
some land. And Carl was considering it.

815
01:41:02,358 --> 01:41:04,569
Carl's own wife testified that...

816
01:41:04,819 --> 01:41:07,613
...her husband had not made up his mind.

817
01:41:09,949 --> 01:41:12,660
A strange moment to follow and kill a man.

818
01:41:13,161 --> 01:41:14,453
Don't you think?

819
01:41:14,537 --> 01:41:18,624
What Mr. Hooks asks you to believe
is that no proof is needed...

820
01:41:20,126 --> 01:41:22,670
...against a man who bombed Pearl Harbor.

821
01:41:25,798 --> 01:41:28,342
"Look at his face," the prosecutor said...

822
01:41:28,426 --> 01:41:31,137
...presuming that you will see
an enemy there.

823
01:41:31,387 --> 01:41:33,097
He's counting on you...

824
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:37,894
...to remember this war
and to see Kazuo Miyamoto as...

825
01:41:38,519 --> 01:41:40,855
...somehow connected with it.

826
01:41:42,231 --> 01:41:43,524
Indeed he is!

827
01:41:44,525 --> 01:41:46,027
Let us recall that...

828
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:49,614
...First Lieutenant Kazuo Miyamoto
is a much-decorated hero...

829
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:51,741
...of the United States Army.

830
01:41:55,703 --> 01:41:57,246
Kazuo Miyamoto did...

831
01:41:57,914 --> 01:41:59,457
...one thing wrong.

832
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,127
He wasn't certain he could trust us.

833
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:06,756
He was afraid that he would be made
the victim of prejudice...

834
01:42:07,131 --> 01:42:09,342
...as Mr. Hooks, indeed...

835
01:42:10,301 --> 01:42:12,053
...is urging you to do.

836
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:16,098
There's reason in his uncertainty.

837
01:42:16,641 --> 01:42:17,808
Why?

838
01:42:18,059 --> 01:42:20,686
Well, we sent him and his wife and...

839
01:42:21,103 --> 01:42:24,649
...thousands of Americans
to concentration camps.

840
01:42:25,191 --> 01:42:28,486
They lost their homes, their belongings...

841
01:42:29,654 --> 01:42:30,738
...everything.

842
01:42:30,821 --> 01:42:34,158
Should we now be unforgiving
of his mistrust?

843
01:42:41,374 --> 01:42:45,628
Our learned prosecutor
will have you do your duty as Americans.

844
01:42:45,961 --> 01:42:47,338
Proud Americans.

845
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,466
Of course, you must! And if you do...

846
01:42:51,801 --> 01:42:54,470
...Kazuo Miyamoto has nothing to fear.
Because...

847
01:42:55,513 --> 01:42:59,517
...this great country is supposed
to be founded on a set of principles...

848
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:01,352
...of fairness...

849
01:43:03,229 --> 01:43:06,816
...of equality and justice.
And if you are true...

850
01:43:09,068 --> 01:43:10,611
...to these principles...

851
01:43:10,694 --> 01:43:14,698
...you'll only convict a man
for what he's done, and not for who he is.

852
01:43:18,369 --> 01:43:20,079
I'm an old man.

853
01:43:21,122 --> 01:43:24,333
I don't walk so well anymore.
One of my eyes is close to useless.

854
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:26,419
My life is drawing to a close.

855
01:43:27,044 --> 01:43:28,546
Why do I say this?

856
01:43:29,004 --> 01:43:33,342
I say this because it means
that I ponder matters...

857
01:43:34,135 --> 01:43:35,928
...in the light of death...

858
01:43:36,512 --> 01:43:39,181
...in a way that most of you do not.

859
01:43:40,099 --> 01:43:42,685
I feel like a traveler descended...

860
01:43:43,477 --> 01:43:47,148
...from Mars, astounded by what I see here.

861
01:43:47,606 --> 01:43:50,693
The same human frailty...

862
01:43:51,527 --> 01:43:54,071
...passed on from generation to generation.

863
01:43:54,155 --> 01:43:56,782
We hate one another.
We are the victims of...

864
01:43:57,825 --> 01:43:59,952
...irrational fears, of prejudice.

865
01:44:02,496 --> 01:44:03,914
You might think...

866
01:44:04,832 --> 01:44:08,169
...that this is a small trial in a small place.

867
01:44:11,714 --> 01:44:13,090
It isn't.

868
01:44:13,841 --> 01:44:16,635
Every once in a while,
somewhere in the world...

869
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:19,263
...humanity goes on trial...

870
01:44:20,806 --> 01:44:22,349
...and integrity...

871
01:44:23,017 --> 01:44:24,476
...and decency.

872
01:44:25,686 --> 01:44:27,396
Every once in a while...

873
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:31,108
...ordinary people just like you,
ladies and gentlemen...

874
01:44:31,192 --> 01:44:34,904
...get called on to give the report card
for the human race.

875
01:44:39,783 --> 01:44:41,744
In the name of humanity...

876
01:44:42,244 --> 01:44:44,288
...do your duty as jurors.

877
01:44:46,582 --> 01:44:49,501
Return this man to his wife and children.

878
01:44:50,461 --> 01:44:52,129
Set him free...

879
01:44:53,672 --> 01:44:55,215
...as you must.

880
01:45:34,213 --> 01:45:36,131
Good night, Mrs. Miyamoto.

881
01:46:28,892 --> 01:46:30,352
Please.

882
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:35,482
I know you'll think this is crazy...

883
01:46:35,983 --> 01:46:38,193
...but all I want to do is hold you.

884
01:46:38,402 --> 01:46:42,364
I think that ifyou'll let me do that
just for a few seconds...

885
01:46:46,785 --> 01:46:48,954
...I can walk away...

886
01:46:49,538 --> 01:46:51,623
...and never speak to you again.

887
01:46:54,501 --> 01:46:56,545
Can you please look at me?

888
01:47:30,829 --> 01:47:32,748
I did a terrible thing.

889
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:36,335
But you have to hear this.

890
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:38,128
I can never touch you.

891
01:47:39,087 --> 01:47:40,631
You have to let go.

892
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:43,550
That's the way things are.

893
01:47:51,975 --> 01:47:53,518
Things end, Ishmael.

894
01:47:56,396 --> 01:47:57,898
They do.

895
01:48:00,108 --> 01:48:01,777
You have to let go.

896
01:48:23,548 --> 01:48:26,593
I went by the lighthouse,
and I found a report that stated...

897
01:48:26,677 --> 01:48:31,723
...a freighter passed through
the Channel at the time of Carl's death.

898
01:48:32,599 --> 01:48:36,228
This is something that
should've been discussed at the trial.

899
01:48:36,687 --> 01:48:39,356
I can't believe I let you rope me into this.

900
01:48:39,648 --> 01:48:41,817
We've been over these boats
a dozen times.

901
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:45,362
If there's a lantern on Carl's mast,
then Miyamoto's story's true.

902
01:48:45,445 --> 01:48:46,613
See?

903
01:48:46,947 --> 01:48:48,198
No lantern.

904
01:48:49,658 --> 01:48:50,784
What are those?

905
01:48:50,867 --> 01:48:54,079
- Nothing. Bits of twine.
- Bits of twine aren't nothing.

906
01:48:56,623 --> 01:48:59,209
Maybe somebody should
take a look at those.

907
01:49:04,297 --> 01:49:07,843
Don't touch anything up there.
It's still a crime scene, remember?

908
01:49:07,926 --> 01:49:10,554
Don't ever touch something
at a crime scene.

909
01:49:18,979 --> 01:49:22,190
Doesn't the phrase, "The jury's out,"
mean anything to you?

910
01:49:23,567 --> 01:49:25,402
They're lashings.

911
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:28,655
Figure-eight lashings all cut through.

912
01:49:30,741 --> 01:49:32,409
And you know something?

913
01:49:32,659 --> 01:49:34,745
These stains here on the mast...

914
01:49:34,953 --> 01:49:36,663
...they could be blood.

915
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:40,417
The cut on his hand.

916
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:43,336
See this?

917
01:49:56,349 --> 01:49:58,268
I think you better come down here.

918
01:49:58,351 --> 01:50:01,813
- There's something you should see.
- What the hell is it now?

919
01:50:04,441 --> 01:50:06,651
- What?
- Take a look at this.

920
01:50:20,248 --> 01:50:21,791
This better be good.

921
01:50:22,792 --> 01:50:27,047
I can admit evidence if required
in the interest of justice.

922
01:50:27,881 --> 01:50:29,633
Only if it changes everything.

923
01:50:29,716 --> 01:50:31,551
Nels explained that to you?

924
01:50:32,594 --> 01:50:34,346
- Yes, he did.
- Very well then.

925
01:50:34,429 --> 01:50:37,140
About this second lantern
and the freighter.

926
01:50:37,224 --> 01:50:40,101
After Miyamoto left,
and Carl's engine was running...

927
01:50:40,185 --> 01:50:44,689
...he must have remembered the lantern,
so he climbs up to cut it down.

928
01:51:29,234 --> 01:51:34,197
Everything fits: the coast guard report,
the lanterns, the freighter's course...

929
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:38,952
...the coffee cup, the time on Carl's watch
and Carl's blood on the fishing gaff.

930
01:51:39,244 --> 01:51:42,038
Your Honor,
that is the rankest speculation.

931
01:51:44,124 --> 01:51:45,333
Please, spare me.

932
01:51:45,417 --> 01:51:47,293
- With all due respect...
- You listen here!

933
01:51:47,377 --> 01:51:49,295
We're going to hear this theory out.

934
01:51:49,379 --> 01:51:52,424
If justice demands it,
we're gonna let the jury hear it...

935
01:51:52,507 --> 01:51:54,843
...just in case it might be the truth.

936
01:51:56,970 --> 01:52:00,473
- The head wound?
- We found a small fracture in the gunnel.

937
01:52:00,557 --> 01:52:02,976
- Just below the mast.
- Anything could've caused it.

938
01:52:03,059 --> 01:52:05,687
- Anything with human hair.
- Why?

939
01:52:11,151 --> 01:52:12,444
May I?

940
01:52:14,571 --> 01:52:16,614
This isn't a legal case.

941
01:52:16,698 --> 01:52:18,950
There's no way to prove any of this,
Your Honor.

942
01:52:19,033 --> 01:52:21,828
This certainly warrants a fresh look.

943
01:52:24,664 --> 01:52:26,416
I want to think about it.

944
01:52:36,009 --> 01:52:37,552
By the way...

945
01:52:37,927 --> 01:52:41,097
...this coast guard report,
when did you come across it?

946
01:52:44,476 --> 01:52:47,061
Was it today you went out
to the lighthouse?

947
01:52:51,357 --> 01:52:53,234
Day before yesterday.

948
01:52:58,198 --> 01:53:00,492
You're wondering why I held on to it.

949
01:53:00,575 --> 01:53:02,202
Perhaps I have some...

950
01:53:02,827 --> 01:53:03,953
...idea.

951
01:53:09,375 --> 01:53:11,419
Could it have anything to do...

952
01:53:15,131 --> 01:53:17,175
...with the way you look at her?

953
01:53:23,598 --> 01:53:25,558
It takes a rare thing...

954
01:53:26,392 --> 01:53:27,977
...a turning point...

955
01:53:28,144 --> 01:53:30,313
...to free oneself from any...

956
01:53:31,147 --> 01:53:34,108
...obsession. Be it prejudice or hate or...

957
01:53:35,068 --> 01:53:37,028
...even love.

958
01:53:39,322 --> 01:53:40,865
I had to, really.

959
01:53:44,118 --> 01:53:45,537
I had no choice.

960
01:53:47,539 --> 01:53:50,291
You're sounding
just a little like your father.

961
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:53,253
Did I ever tell you how much I liked him?

962
01:53:58,967 --> 01:54:00,802
I keep thinking about Carl.

963
01:54:01,594 --> 01:54:03,346
How unfair it seems.

964
01:54:03,930 --> 01:54:05,974
An accident. Just like that.

965
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:09,978
Things just bear down on us, I suppose.

966
01:54:11,104 --> 01:54:13,064
A freighter in the fog.

967
01:54:15,984 --> 01:54:17,902
Or a war.

968
01:54:22,782 --> 01:54:25,493
Accident rules every corner of the universe.

969
01:54:26,577 --> 01:54:28,288
Except maybe...

970
01:54:29,372 --> 01:54:31,624
...the chambers of the human heart.

971
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:56,834
Morning, Horace.

972
01:55:57,001 --> 01:55:58,753
Reminds you of 1930, doesn't it?

973
01:55:58,836 --> 01:56:03,382
I believe you're thinking of 1929.

974
01:56:03,466 --> 01:56:05,009
Of course it was.

975
01:56:05,593 --> 01:56:07,512
Winter of '29.

976
01:56:32,286 --> 01:56:33,621
All rise.

977
01:56:33,871 --> 01:56:36,541
The Superior Court
of the State of Washington...

978
01:56:36,624 --> 01:56:39,502
...County of San Piedro, is now in session.

979
01:56:47,969 --> 01:56:49,554
Members of the jury:

980
01:56:50,054 --> 01:56:53,558
The court thanks you for your diligence
in the task you've performed...

981
01:56:53,641 --> 01:56:55,685
...under difficult circumstances.

982
01:56:55,768 --> 01:56:56,811
However...

983
01:56:56,894 --> 01:57:00,064
...in the light of the new forensic evidence
we have heard...

984
01:57:00,147 --> 01:57:03,359
...you are hereby discharged
from your responsibilities.

985
01:57:13,077 --> 01:57:14,120
Order.

986
01:57:58,456 --> 01:57:59,498
Order.

987
01:57:59,999 --> 01:58:01,792
You will resume your seats.

988
01:58:14,513 --> 01:58:15,848
Settle down.

989
01:58:19,810 --> 01:58:21,479
Let us not forget...

990
01:58:22,063 --> 01:58:25,066
...we have been considering the death
of one man...

991
01:58:25,649 --> 01:58:28,319
...as well as pondering the fate of another.

992
01:58:31,072 --> 01:58:33,074
Will the defendant please rise?

993
01:58:38,871 --> 01:58:40,289
Kazuo Miyamoto...

994
01:58:40,790 --> 01:58:42,625
...in the interest of justice...

995
01:58:42,708 --> 01:58:46,378
...the charges against you are dismissed.
You're free to go home.

996
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:37,740
Can I hold you now?

997
02:00:51,462 --> 02:00:54,673
I'm so grateful for your gentle heart.

998
02:07:00,955 --> 02:07:03,041
