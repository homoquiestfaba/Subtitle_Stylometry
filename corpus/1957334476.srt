is no reason to throw away --

181
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,264
Take a day or two and think it over.

182
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,599
Don't wanna be here anymore, I understand

183
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:41,228
but don't throw your career
away for a prick like Tom.

00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,592
What's with the outfit?

191
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:13,969
We going sailing?

192
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,766
(chuckling)

193
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,230
(beat music)

194
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,410
(fizzling)

195
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,002
- Hey.

196
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,462
Big guy.

197
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,463
Hey.

198
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:50,964
Easy.

199
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:51,840
Easy.

200
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:53,842
(thudding)

201
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:56,428
(gunshot)

202
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,477
(gunshot)

203
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,564
Thanks.

204
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,237
(gunshot)

205
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,199
I wanted to be her.

206
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,417
- I hope you enjoyed that
because we are back on mission.

207
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,088
- You have a plan, sir?

208
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,923
- I am working on one,

209
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:35,092
unless either of you
have something to add.

210
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,722
That is why we leapt into the future.

211
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,684
We fly that back to the armada

212
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,727
and show them where this planet is.

213
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,271
Mission accomplished.

214
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,939
Heroes.

215
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,608
- Promise to kill every
last one of these skin bags?

216
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,403
Good.

217
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,364
(foreboding music)

218
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,910
- Who are we looking for?

219
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:02,786
- Killers.

220
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:06,790
- My car.

221
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,091
- You are not what I expected.

222
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,385
- What did you expect, a man?

223
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,557
- You're good at reading people.

224
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,479
I have no issue with you being a woman.

225
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,023
- Me neither.

226
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,653
You're a married man, huh?

227
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:42,951
Lucky girl.

228
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,832
- I noticed you're, engaged.

229
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,378
- Nope.

230
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,842
(ominous music)

231
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,826
- What a piece of shit.

232
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,126
- [Lisa] What are their plans?

233
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,170
- [Cooper] Destroy as
many lives as possible.

234
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,422
- Terrorists?

235
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:38,715
- Of sorts.

236
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,217
- How'd you get this deal?

237
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,885
- I was first on the scene.

238
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,562
- I don't smoke.

239
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,649
I don't have time for bullshit.

240
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:56,942
- [Radio Dispatch] Seven Henry Three,

241
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,319
per your request for fresh
vehicle recoveries.

242
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,779
Check your screen.

243
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,781
- Seven Henry Three, thanks.

244
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:03,657
10-4.

245
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,995
- Amazing.

246
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,503
(foreboding music)

247
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,088
- We're changing tactics.

248
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,298
- Let's just kill them all.

249
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,507
- One at a time.

250
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,093
- We need to find people
with specific skills.

251
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,304
Specific...

252
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,180
Skill...

253
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,849
Sific...

254
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,475
Skills...

255
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,782
- Seven Henry Three.

256
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:48,035
- [Radio Dispatch] Seven
Henry Three, go ahead.

257
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,995
- Show me 10-7, please.

258
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,289
- [Male Officer] Seven Adam Two,
requesting a want warrant check.

259
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:53,749
- [Radio Dispatch]
Seven Adam Two, standby.

260
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,375
Seven Henry Three, roger.

261
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,586
I'll show you 10-7 out for investigation

262
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,171
on your previously run vehicle.

263
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,089
- 10-4, thanks.

264
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:02,007
- [Radio Dispatch] Seven Adam Two,

265
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,342
go ahead with your
want warrant check.

266
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,727
(eerie music)

267
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:18,982
- V.A.

268
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,026
That's a break.

269
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,570
My partner's hat.

270
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:30,786
- Partner?

271
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,287
Is this personal?

272
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,163
- No.

273
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,456
This is a professional investigation

274
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,916
with a personal connection.

275
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,168
I will not let emotion
get in the way, ma'am.

276
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,009
(eerie music)

277
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,761
- Can't be too far.

278
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,721
We should set up a perimeter.

279
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,265
- They're not coming back.

280
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,808
- How do you know?

281
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,185
- They use things up and throw them away.

282
00:23:58,647 --> 00:23:59,523
- Let's get going.

283
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,527
(ominous music)

284
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,207
- Hey!

285
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:23,380
- What happened?

286
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:25,883
Can you hear me?

287
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:26,967
- Please help him.

288
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,218
- Call 9-1-1.

289
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:39,188
(menacing music)

290
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,068
- You're really good with
that typewriter in the car.

291
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,986
- The computer?

292
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:47,946
- Right.

293
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,990
(girl screaming)

294
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:54,119
(suspenseful music)

295
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:01,251
(ominous music)

296
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:03,378
- Any ID on him?

297
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,713
- Clark Calhoon.

298
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:06,215
- That's the RO from the car.

299
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,592
- I saw the whole thing.

300
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:13,472
- What did you see?

301
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:16,141
- A jogger did CPR and
then she just ran off.

302
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:17,392
- Which way did they go?

303
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:18,268
- That way.

304
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,522
- Seven Henry Three.

305
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,942
Have fire...

306
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,986
(suspenseful music)

307
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,435
Did you find the witness?

308
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:01,937
- Negative.

309
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,647
- All right, uniforms are
setting up a perimeter

310
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:04,815
and the bus just left.

311
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:05,691
- He's dead.

312
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,109
There's nothing more we can do here.

313
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,152
- The paramedics detected
some electrical activity

314
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,195
on the EKG.

315
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:11,071
- I assure you,

316
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:13,448
Mr. Calhoon has shuffled
off this mortal coil.

317
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:18,203
(police sirens approaching)

318
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,129
- These guys have no record.

319
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:28,297
What's their M.O.?

320
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,256
What do they want?

321
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,635
- Someone call for homicide?

322
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:34,803
- Crap.

323
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,390
- Body's on route to Boyle Heights.

324
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:39,600
- Oh.

325
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,351
If it ain't dead yet it will be soon, huh?

326
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:42,269
Am I right?

327
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:43,228
(chuckling)

328
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,479
Hey, we haven't been introduced.

329
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:45,981
Detective Sergeant Tom Wilson.

330
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,524
- Special Agent Cooper Miller.

331
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,068
- Special, huh?

332
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,111
Hey,

333
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,864
you mind if I get a moment alone
with my partner here, Coop?

334
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:55,782
- Yeah.

335
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,326
- It's Cooper.

336
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:59,119
- Cooper, sure.

337
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,337
What happened to "I only work alone."

338
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:09,713
- It's an assignment.

339
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,174
I don't answer to you.

340
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,467
- [Tom] You don't answer
your phone either.

341
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:15,093
- [Lisa] Yeah, why should I?

342
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,512
- Look, I'm trying to apologize.

343
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,554
- For what?

344
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:18,972
There's nothing left to say.

345
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:19,848
- Give me a break.

346
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,392
- You are a liar, you're dishonest.

347
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:23,602
- I fucked up but don't act

348
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,312
like you're so innocent in all this.

349
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:27,898
- Oh what, are you accusing
me of something now?

350
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,358
- Exactly, what about my needs?

351
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,442
- Oh, this is about your needs?

352
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:31,818
This is so typical.

353
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,195
You're such a fucking selfish prick!

354
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:34,488
- Lost cause, "look at me."

355
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,365
You know what, fuck you.

356
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,158
- There's no excuse for profanity.

357
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,701
Not in the presence of a lady.

358
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:40,702
(chuckling)

359
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:42,037
- Lady?

360
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,038
What the fuck do you know?

361
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,206
Piss off.

362
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,291
- Agent Miller, stand down please.

363
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:48,418
I can handle this.

364
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,462
- Better listen to your handler.

365
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:53,757
- Apologize to the lady.

366
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,760
- You know what, fuck you!

367
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:57,761
Fuck --

368
00:27:57,803 --> 00:27:59,471
(groaning)

369
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:03,517
- I said, apologize to Detective McAdams.

370
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,269
- And I said fuck you!

371
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,521
(groaning)

372
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,400
- Apologize to the lady.

373
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,526
- Okay, all right.

374
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,069
I'm sorry.

375
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:15,237
Damn it, I'm sorry.

376
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:16,864
Okay?

377
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:18,699
Asshole.

378
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:22,494
(thump)

379
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,580
Fuck me.

380
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,416
(groaning)

381
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:28,292
Asshole.

382
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,590
- That ring you saw me
throw out the window...

383
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:36,091
He gave that to me.

384
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:37,467
- If you don't mind me saying so ma'am,

385
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:38,969
you dodged a bullet with that one.

386
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,054
- Sure looks like it.

387
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,309
How'd it feel?

388
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:47,769
- Good.

389
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:52,691
(ominous music)

390
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,318
- What was I supposed to do?

391
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,404
- You did fine.

392
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,072
These bodies are flimsy.

393
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,949
We'll have to choose more carefully.

394
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,743
- You chose well this time.

395
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:11,585
The only thing on this
planet better than eating

396
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:12,586
is fornicating.

397
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:13,629
- I prefer food.

398
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:17,466
Just a bit.

399
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:21,428
Maybe we can stay.

400
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:24,598
We can clean this planet
up one pest at a time.

401
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:25,557
- No.

402
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:28,143
We kill them all and
we wait for the fleet.

403
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:32,356
- I'm going to build a transmitter.

404
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:35,067
We'll send the armada our coordinates.

405
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,610
This is our new home.

406
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:40,364
(menacing music)

407
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:44,576
- Mmmm.

408
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,705
You're right.

409
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:50,123
It's delicious.

410
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:52,918
- I know.

411
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,301
That shit will kill you.

412
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:02,261
- Doctor's orders.

413
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,721
Lowers my stress.

414
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:07,057
(chuckling)

415
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:10,143
- Don't these people
have known accomplices?

416
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,397
- Not anywhere around here.

417
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,025
- I must admit,

418
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:21,947
it's nice just having
one case to focus on.

419
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:24,032
I'm usually working so many cases,

420
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,243
I hardly know the people
I'm trying to help.

421
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:27,995
- That stinks.

422
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,121
- It does.

423
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,083
- Sorry about Tom.

424
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,918
- Don't apologize for him.

425
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,228
- You eat nails and
shit bullets, don't you?

426
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:04,656
(suspenseful beat music)

427
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:09,119
The facial recognition software
identified a Frank Sterling.

428
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:10,579
- Someone spotted him?

429
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,998
- A computer over at headquarters did.

430
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,459
- Right.

431
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,128
- Come on, we gotta go.

432
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,216
(suspenseful music)

433
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:32,142
(ominous music)

434
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:39,024
- Mr. Jackson.

435
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:39,942
- Can I help you?

436
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,945
- The paper you wrote on
extraterrestrial signal

437
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,988
isolation and amplification was great.

438
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,115
- Well, thank you.

439
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,659
And who might you be?

440
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,202
- I'm you.

441
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:53,247
(menacing music)

442
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,791
(man yelling)

443
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,461
- How'd you end up doing this?

444
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:01,588
- Missing persons?

445
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:03,340
- Cop.

446
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:06,635
I mean,

447
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:10,556
what would draw a woman
to this line of work.

448
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:13,183
- You rather I'd be home
barefoot and pregnant?

449
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:16,311
- That's not what I meant.

450
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:18,647
What's with the barefoot thing?

451
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:20,065
I never understood that.

452
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,526
- When you're pregnant, your feet swell.

453
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,695
You know, I hate to shatter your delusions

454
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:28,156
but I am perfectly
capable of doing my job.

455
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:29,908
There is an Air Force study that found

456
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,745
that women are actually
better pilots than men.

457
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:37,332
- There.

458
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,293
(foreboding music)

459
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:40,169
Gun it!

460
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:44,464
(suspenseful music)

461
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:47,134
Cut him off!

462
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:15,537
(ominous beat music)

463
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,684
(suspenseful music)

464
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,575
(rustling)

465
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:31,071
(dishes clinking)

466
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:33,782
(ominous music)

467
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:45,002
(suspenseful music)

468
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,515
(creaking)

469
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:46,897
- Come on.

470
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:01,370
Hands up.

471
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,004
- You're making a mistake.

472
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,007
- Turn around.

473
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:20,931
Turn around.

474
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:27,729
- I'm gonna be pretty.

475
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,607
- Hands behind your back.

476
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:39,032
(thud)

477
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:43,370
(fizzling)

478
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:50,919
- I'm going to be pretty.

479
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,338
(thud)

480
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,175
(gunshot)

481
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:00,012
(eerie music)

482
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:17,196
(suspenseful music)

483
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:31,126
(foreboding music)

484
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:50,687
- That was a crap-tacular night, huh?

485
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,899
Get my head crushed,

486
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,275
your suspects get away.

487
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:58,445
- Pull over.

488
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,908
In through your nose,
out through the mouth.

489
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,951
- Yeah, I know how to breathe.

490
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:05,494
- I know the shakes.

491
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:06,662
Get out of the car.

492
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:09,581
Trust me.

493
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:16,255
(sighing)

494
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:40,028
Jumping jacks.

495
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:42,781
- What?

496
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,825
- 50, now.

497
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,995
- Seriously?

498
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,669
(chuckling)

499
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:06,805
Hey!

500
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:07,764
What are you doing?

501
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,851
- I don't have the shakes.

502
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:12,269
That's 20.

503
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:13,353
- But.

504
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:14,229
- Faster!

505
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:16,148
Faster!

506
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,276
Faster!

507
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:21,445
Faster!

508
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:23,947
Faster!

509
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:28,285
Good.

510
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,341
- I'll be damned.

511
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:49,890
- Can we check a few more places?

512
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:53,810
Before we call it a night.

513
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:54,811
Please?

514
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:57,356
- Sure.

515
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:22,089
(ominous music)

516
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,298
- Are you sure?

517
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,174
- I think so.

518
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:27,845
It's kinda hard to tell.

519
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:29,805
He shot me in the friggin' head.

520
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:33,892
- What's going on?

521
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,645
- Agent Miller is here.

522
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:37,563
Maybe.

523
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:38,438
- Here?

524
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,314
Now?

525
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:40,899
- I think he shot me in the head.

526
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:44,528
- Time to connect.

527
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,660
(fizzling)

528
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,667
(eerie music)

529
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:12,347
I can't tell if that was him or not.

530
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:13,849
All right, we need to hurry up.

531
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,184
If that was him,

532
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,561
that tenacious bastard
will turn up eventually.

533
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:23,567
- [Lisa] We can't keep running all night.

534
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,238
What do you say we catch a few hours, huh?

535
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:31,950
- You're not gonna lend
me your car, are you?

536
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,040
- Where are you staying?

537
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,251
Ah...

538
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:42,252
- Hollywood Hilton.

539
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,593
- You know, you can crash at my place.

540
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:55,349
- That's awfully nice of
you but I'll be all right.

541
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:58,519
- [Lisa] I have a
perfectly comfortable couch

542
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,312
and you are welcome to it.

543
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:04,608
- Thanks.

544
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:07,653
- Mhmm.

545
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:11,823
(security alarm beeping)

546
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,370
It's a small place but --

547
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:19,957
- Sure beats a motel.

548
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:20,958
- I bet.

549
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:23,460
Hey, girl.

550
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:32,719
Make yourself at home.

551
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:38,141
(soft Jazz plays)

552
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,749
- Do you have any Nat King Cole?

553
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:04,793
- Am I black?

554
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:10,132
Wanna beer?

555
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:14,094
- Sure, thanks.

556
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,026
- Let's catch a couple of hours

557
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:31,737
and get back at it in the morning.

558
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:33,655
Sofa down there is a pullout.

559
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,743
- Appreciate your hospitality, ma'am.

560
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:39,494
I mean, Lisa.

561
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,255
- Thanks for shooting
that guy in the head.

562
00:43:54,176 --> 00:43:55,219
Night.

563
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:42,099
(clock ticking)

564
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,563
(eerie music)

565
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:53,277
(fizzling)

566
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:08,750
(screams echoing)

567
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:28,562
(ominous music)

568
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:10,062
- Cooper Miller, Special...

569
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:14,608
(suspenseful beat music)

570
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,574
Who are you?

571
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,079
1947?

572
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:46,723
(yawning)

573
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:07,536
(food sizzling)

574
00:47:35,647 --> 00:47:37,566
- Found the bacon in the freezer.

575
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:40,736
Flower's a little old but
I think it will be okay.

576
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:42,279
Couldn't find your coffee

577
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:44,740
but I hope you like the
way I made your tea.

578
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:52,331
- It's perfect.

579
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:55,417
Thanks.

580
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:15,062
(ominous music)

581
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,692
- The other day you
wondered who would marry me.

582
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:25,155
Her name was Virginia.

583
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:28,992
She died in a plane crash.

584
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:31,870
- Sorry about that.

585
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:34,831
- She was a B-17 instructor.

586
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:42,047
Suit gave me away, right?

587
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:45,217
- That and the hotel you're staying at,

588
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:46,552
the Hollywood Hilton,

589
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:49,555
doesn't exist.

590
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,432
- You're not gonna find me on
that computer thing either.

591
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:56,728
- You're from 1947?

592
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,356
- 1951.

593
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:00,649
- Who are you?

594
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,239
- My name is Cooper F. Miller,

595
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:09,533
United States Army Intelligence Corp.

596
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,287
On my base we housed a small
group of extraterrestrials.

597
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:16,039
- Aliens?

598
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:19,835
- Three of them escaped through
an experimental time portal.

599
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:22,212
I chased them here.

600
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:25,674
- Who's your president?

601
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:26,884
- Harry S. Truman.

602
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,177
- Who won the World Series?

603
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,261
- Last year?

604
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:30,387
Yankees in four.

605
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:31,471
- Last movie you saw.

606
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,848
- Sunset Boulevard.

607
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:37,019
(ominous music)

608
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:53,785
- These aliens are monsters, parasites.

609
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:57,289
Looking for a host like you or me.

610
00:49:57,497 --> 00:50:00,250
Before they could communicate
what they had learned,

611
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:01,210
we captured them.

612
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,045
- We?

613
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,588
- My partner and I.

614
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,423
They killed him when they escaped.

615
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:10,844
(eerie music)

616
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,017
At least put the safety on.

617
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:25,234
- I don't believe you.

618
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,027
- Believe me or not,

619
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:28,862
I'm dead in 24 hours

620
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:35,244
and these monsters go free
and then everyone dies.

621
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:36,662
I can't do this alone.

622
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:46,296
- Every instinct in my
body tells me you're lying.

623
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:52,511
But I don't trust those anymore.

624
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:02,688
(somber music)

625
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:09,486
- Here, eat this.

626
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:10,404
- Seriously?

627
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:12,030
- It's for your own protection.

628
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:22,457
- Hmmm.

629
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:41,143
It's definitely the man I
chased in the alley yesterday.

630
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:43,312
- You didn't call the FBI shoot team.

631
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:45,147
- How long until that becomes a problem?

632
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,857
- Any minute now.

633
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:47,733
- Oh, darn.

634
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:52,696
(knocking)

635
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:57,618
- [Lisa] We're here about

636
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:59,411
the missing persons report you filed.

637
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:01,246
- Ma'am.

638
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:13,759
- What is your husband's area of research?

639
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,927
- He's best known for his work

640
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:17,179
on astrophysics and particle theory.

641
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:18,222
- What was his...

642
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,351
is his passion?

643
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:31,109
- Meredith, we're here to help Ted.

644
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:33,904
Sometimes every little
piece of information

645
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:35,322
makes a difference.

646
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:39,368
- He worked for SETI for many years.

647
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:41,453
Broke his heart when they shut it down.

648
00:52:41,787 --> 00:52:42,746
- SETI?

649
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:46,166
- "Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence."

650
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,042
- You're kidding.

651
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:51,255
(ominous music)

652
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:57,594
Thanks, ma'am.

653
00:52:57,636 --> 00:52:59,346
- Is my husband going to be okay?

654
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,727
- I will do everything
in my power to find him.

655
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,606
(somber music)

656
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:23,620
He's dead, right?

657
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:24,496
- Afraid so.

658
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:25,372
- Damn.

659
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:29,293
What's wrong?

660
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:30,419
- Pins and needles.

661
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:33,130
Doc Opp said this could happen.

662
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:36,258
You were really great
in there, you were kind.

663
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:39,678
- I've made too many
promises I couldn't keep.

664
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:42,556
I don't do that anymore.

665
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:47,853
- What do they want with him?

666
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:49,271
He can't build them a ship.

667
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:52,649
(eerie music)

668
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:58,530
- They're not trying to get home.

669
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:03,452
They're trying to call home.

670
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,831
- All they would have to
do is send a location.

671
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,168
That would be bad.

672
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:18,008
- So these aliens we're chasing,

673
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,676
are they the only ones out there?

674
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:21,929
- You really wanna know?

675
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:27,935
These are the only bad ones we've found.

676
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:31,980
Remember the crash in 1947, Roswell?

677
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:36,026
There is an alien race called the Greys.

678
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,821
Only one survived.

679
00:54:40,781 --> 00:54:43,450
Little guy we named Albert.

680
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:45,160
- After Einstein?

681
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:46,870
- Albert the janitor.

682
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:50,040
He liked to drink the
water from the mop bucket.

683
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:50,999
- Oh.

684
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:54,795
- Army doctors nursed him back
to health as best they could.

685
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:57,714
Military built an
underground facility for him.

686
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:02,261
Albert was the most gentle
creature I have ever known.

687
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:04,930
The aliens we're chasing
were sent to this planet

688
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,140
to destroy Albert.

689
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:09,893
We stopped them but they escaped.

690
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:11,353
We think they were after him because

691
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:13,730
he showed us incredible
technology we could use

692
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:15,399
to protect our planet.

693
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,525
- Time travel.

694
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:18,777
- Bingo.

695
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:21,947
- Wow, okay.

696
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,868
- Forget about the alien stuff.

697
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:29,079
Imagine there' a bomb underneath this city

698
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:31,081
and these three are the bomb makers.

699
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:35,419
Doesn't matter who they
are or where they're from.

700
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:37,462
We have to stop them.

701
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:41,341
What are you thinking?

702
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:46,388
- What do you need to make a transmitter?

703
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,724
- Components, parts.

704
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:52,728
- Surplus stores.

705
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:54,313
They'd have to steal the parts.

706
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:57,482
Or rob a bank.

707
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:01,445
- We need to track down
that Doctor's credit cards.

708
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,489
- Can you find that here?

709
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:06,575
- I can't.

710
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:10,454
Oh shit.

711
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:17,002
This is going to hurt.

712
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:29,848
(laughing)

713
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:34,937
- What can I do for you?

714
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:41,860
You talk to IA yet?

715
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:43,278
- Not yet.

716
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,696
- I though they were --

717
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:46,031
- Don't think.

718
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:47,658
It's not your strong suit.

719
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:52,079
Got what I asked for?

720
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:54,706
- Didn't realize I'd be doing this

721
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,208
for "Captain Cheap Shot" over there.

722
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,545
- Glass-jawed pansy.

723
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:02,881
- You know what, screw this noise.

724
00:57:02,965 --> 00:57:05,676
(car engines starting)

725
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:09,638
(honking)

726
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:14,518
- What do you want?

727
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:18,856
- Another chance.

728
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:20,440
Shut it, G-man.

729
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:25,487
- Dinner?

730
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:30,075
- And?

731
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:33,954
- No Tasers?

732
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:35,706
(laughing)

733
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:38,792
- That's it.

734
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:43,505
I emailed the transactions to you.

735
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,178
Later fucktard.

736
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:55,184
(dramatic music)

737
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,037
(entry bell ringing)

738
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:38,810
- Hello?

739
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:51,823
You recognize this man?

740
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:54,535
- Not without a warrant, dude.

741
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:01,667
- This man and his
accomplices are terrorists.

742
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:04,294
- I heard that one before.

743
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:07,089
- He deserves the truth.

744
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:11,593
I'm Special Agent Lisa McAdams.

745
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:14,179
This is Special Agent Cooper Miller.

746
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:16,849
We're working an X-File.

747
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:19,810
This man is an alien.

748
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:20,853
(chuckling)

749
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:21,895
- Aliens.

750
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:29,027
Really?

751
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:30,863
- We need your help.

752
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:35,158
- Really?

753
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,661
Awesome.

754
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:39,204
Um, okay.

755
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:41,206
Well, I haven't seen that guy before

756
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:43,876
but I did sell a transmitter.

757
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:47,004
A lady bought one.

758
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:48,839
It was weapons grade.

759
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:50,007
I thought it was odd.

760
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,427
- Last piece of the puzzle.

761
00:59:57,389 --> 00:59:59,766
- Holy shit, I'm like
the Lone Gunmen, right?

762
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:01,560
(chuckling)

763
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:02,936
There she is.

764
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:07,774
Wow, that chick was an alien.

765
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:08,942
That's so hot.

766
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:11,862
Wow.

767
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:14,323
- Do you have any cameras
on the parking lot?

768
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:19,286
- That's strange, man.

769
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,127
- Well do you have any
other cameras outside?

770
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:29,838
- Bam.

771
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:33,008
- I'll be darned.

772
01:00:33,217 --> 01:00:34,051
- She's on foot.

773
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:35,093
She can't be that far.

774
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:39,097
- Wait.

775
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:42,851
You mean these things are
somewhere around here?

776
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,896
Holy fuckin' awesome sauce.

777
01:00:46,355 --> 01:00:49,650
- If these creatures got
wind that we were on to them,

778
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:52,486
you can't imagine what they could do.

779
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:56,156
- Oh, I think I could.

780
01:00:58,325 --> 01:00:59,993
- Thank you for your cooperation.

781
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:04,039
(suspenseful music)

782
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,482
What the heck is an X-File?

783
01:01:34,862 --> 01:01:37,531
(ominous music)

784
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:39,825
Excuse me, ma'am?

785
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:46,290
My apologies, ma'am.

786
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:50,169
(foreboding music)

787
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,799
(ominous music)

788
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:46,433
- Kid, get lost!

789
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:48,185
- Take it, asshole, it's heavy.

790
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:50,604
Connect it to the duplexer
and grab me a phone.

791
01:02:50,646 --> 01:02:51,522
That was Cooper you saw.

792
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:53,023
He's getting way too close.

793
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:56,652
(ominous music)

794
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:24,680
- How far do you think
she could've walked?

795
01:03:25,264 --> 01:03:26,723
- Not much father than this.

796
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:32,479
What are those towers there?

797
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:34,273
- LA DWP power station.

798
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:38,569
That's it.

799
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,404
Power.

800
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:42,573
- We're right on top of
those little bastards.

801
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,495
- Remember what I told you.

802
01:03:50,247 --> 01:03:51,456
- I'd like to speak to the officer

803
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:54,376
in charge of the disappearance
of Doctor Ted Jackson.

804
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,212
I have important information.

805
01:03:57,254 --> 01:03:58,881
- You want her commanding officer.

806
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:01,175
Tell them these are exigent circumstances.

807
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:02,050
- Yes.

808
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:04,845
I'll hold for Lieutenant Jenkins.

809
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:10,767
(phone ringing)

810
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:12,728
- Jenkins.

811
01:04:14,438 --> 01:04:15,939
- You like it here?

812
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:16,982
- LA?

813
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:18,483
It's growing on me.

814
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:20,110
- Like a fungus?

815
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:24,031
No, I mean do you like it here, now?

816
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:27,367
- Once I've figured out how
to open a pack of smokes,

817
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:28,785
things improved quickly.

818
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:30,662
(Lisa chuckling)

819
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:36,793
I'm getting worse.

820
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:39,588
(dramatic music)

821
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,301
- Maybe there's a way back.

822
01:04:44,343 --> 01:04:47,346
- I knew this was a one
way trip when I signed up.

823
01:04:47,387 --> 01:04:49,640
(coughing)

824
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:56,063
Running out of time.

825
01:04:57,523 --> 01:04:59,733
If something happens,
you have to stop them.

826
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:03,070
Promise me.

827
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:07,574
- I promise.

828
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:10,953
(police siren approaching)

829
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,376
- [Radio Dispatch] Any available unit.

830
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:20,337
Please respond to Seven Henry
Three's last known location.

831
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:23,257
Alley north of Wilshire, east of Fairfax.

832
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:25,801
Possibly in the company
of an armed suspect

833
01:05:25,843 --> 01:05:27,511
impersonating a Federal Agent.

834
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:32,516
- [Radio Officer] Seven
Adam Ten responding.

835
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:35,811
- Seven Adam Two, on scene.

836
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:41,358
- [Lieutenant] He's a nutcase.

837
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:43,861
51-50 all the way.

838
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:45,737
Claims to be an Army Officer

839
01:05:45,779 --> 01:05:47,906
from at secret base in the Mojave.

840
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:51,577
Came through time to
track down three aliens.

841
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,287
- I know how it sounds.

842
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:55,664
- He told you and you believed him?

843
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:58,083
Tell me I'm hearing things.

844
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:00,961
- Look, when that guy grabbed my head,

845
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:02,629
I felt something.

846
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:05,549
It wasn't natural.

847
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:06,425
It wasn't!

848
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:09,511
- The guy escaped from an
institution in Seattle.

849
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:11,221
They're coming down to pick him up.

850
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:12,598
I talked with his doctor.

851
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:15,934
- Did you call this doctor
or did this doctor call you?

852
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:18,228
Did you even verify his credentials?

853
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,856
- Christ on a bike, do you hear yourself?

854
01:06:20,898 --> 01:06:21,732
Go home.

855
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:35,037
(dramatic music)

856
01:08:23,228 --> 01:08:26,481
(dramatic piano music)

857
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:51,215
- It's the same stuff.

858
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:00,933
Virginia Miller,

859
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:04,770
pilot.

860
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:22,746
"Virginia Miller, nee Armstrong

861
01:09:22,788 --> 01:09:25,040
"was killed during a
tragic training accident

862
01:09:25,082 --> 01:09:29,503
"when her B-17 crashed just
north of Alamogordo Army Airfield.

863
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,298
"She is survived by her husband, Cooper,

864
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,716
"and brother...

865
01:09:37,094 --> 01:09:37,970
"Vernon?"

866
01:09:39,513 --> 01:09:41,598
You're not in trouble.

867
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,600
- I think we all are.

868
01:09:43,642 --> 01:09:46,395
(dramatic music)

869
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:59,157
- If the Doctor only knew
what he had accomplished here.

870
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,993
He was definitely on the right path.

871
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:03,245
Let's start charging now.

872
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:06,456
We should be ready to send
signals around midnight.

873
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:09,668
(electrical fizzling)

874
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:16,091
- Hey, come in.

875
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:22,347
- So how's Vernon doing?

876
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:24,224
- He was really restless today.

877
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:26,143
He's finally asleep.

878
01:10:26,185 --> 01:10:28,770
- Has he ever mentioned
a Cooper Miller to you?

879
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:29,688
- No.

880
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:31,231
- [Vernon] What about Cooper?

881
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:36,445
- Hey, Vernon, Detective
McAdams, remember me?

882
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:44,203
- You know him.

883
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:46,288
Pick him out.

884
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:01,386
- Right there.

885
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,433
- I'll be damned.

886
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,104
He was a big brother to me.

887
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,568
After my sister's accident,

888
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:21,031
he took me to work with him in the Mojave.

889
01:11:21,073 --> 01:11:22,199
- He thinks you're dead.

890
01:11:23,617 --> 01:11:24,618
- He's here?

891
01:11:25,827 --> 01:11:27,579
You know where he is?

892
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:30,415
He's a good man.

893
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:32,209
Help him.

894
01:11:32,918 --> 01:11:34,837
You have to stop them.

895
01:11:42,636 --> 01:11:44,638
(ominous music)

896
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:49,059
- Lisa!
(gasping)

897
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:50,477
I apologize.

898
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:51,353
I was worried about you.

899
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:53,397
I heard what happened.

900
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:54,773
- How'd you find me?

901
01:11:57,943 --> 01:11:59,111
- I tracked your phone.

902
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,241
- You're such an asshole.

903
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:05,659
- You should've been done hours ago.

904
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:06,952
What are you working on?

905
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:09,246
- What's it to you?

906
01:12:09,288 --> 01:12:10,122
- Everything.

907
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:12,291
(thud)

908
01:12:12,332 --> 01:12:14,835
(eerie music)

909
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:21,425
(fizzling)

910
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:22,718
(groaning)

911
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:23,802
- Salt?

912
01:12:23,844 --> 01:12:25,429
That won't last long.

913
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:28,724
(fizzling)

914
01:12:31,852 --> 01:12:32,728
(smack)

915
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:37,232
(Taser clicking)

916
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:47,034
(eerie music)

917
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:57,628
(suspenseful music)

918
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:10,265
(car speeding away)

919
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:15,938
- Where the hell is he?

920
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:18,106
- Knowing him,

921
01:13:18,315 --> 01:13:20,317
enjoying herself.

922
01:13:24,655 --> 01:13:29,409
(football game on television)

923
01:13:29,493 --> 01:13:30,744
(doorbell ringing)

924
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:36,458
- What the hell happened to you?

925
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,334
Who's that?

926
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:41,171
- Cooper's partner.

927
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:43,382
Cooper's partner from 1951.

928
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,591
- Has everybody drank the Kool-Aid?

929
01:13:44,675 --> 01:13:46,969
- Look, Lisa is in deep
shit, we have to find her.

930
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:47,970
- Did you call her?

931
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:49,721
- My phone is gone, I can't.

932
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:51,598
- I'll call her.

933
01:13:56,228 --> 01:13:57,688
Voicemail.

934
01:13:57,729 --> 01:13:58,564
- Damn it.

935
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:05,529
- Yeah, this is Lieutenant
Jenkins, I need to get --

936
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:07,114
I just authorized what?

937
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:11,660
- What?

938
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:14,496
(somber music)

939
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:26,300
- You look sharp.

940
01:14:27,718 --> 01:14:28,552
- Thanks.

941
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:31,513
For trusting me.

942
01:14:33,015 --> 01:14:34,391
- What can I say?

943
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:36,143
I wanted to be right.

944
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:39,271
(groaning)

945
01:14:39,313 --> 01:14:40,147
You okay?

946
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:42,774
- I'll be all right.

947
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:43,650
- Fine.

948
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:45,360
We've gotta go, come on.

949
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:48,405
(suspenseful music)

950
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:56,330
- Tell me you found them.

951
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:57,206
They found me.

952
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:00,167
Now we find them.

953
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:04,296
- Do you have a plan?

954
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,673
- They're expecting me.

955
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:27,152
Stay.

956
01:15:28,195 --> 01:15:29,488
You'll blow my cover.

957
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:48,799
(ominous music)

958
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:18,537
(eerie music)

959
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:55,073
It's done.

960
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:55,949
- Good.

961
01:16:57,576 --> 01:16:59,036
That bitch was annoying.

962
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,496
- Tell me about it.

963
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,210
- Is it ready?

964
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,296
- Seven minutes.

965
01:17:14,051 --> 01:17:16,720
(ominous music)

966
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:21,600
Let's connect in case anything happens.

967
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:26,063
- Good idea.

968
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,863
- Something wrong?

969
01:17:34,905 --> 01:17:37,908
(suspenseful music)

970
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:43,497
(thudding)

971
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:55,509
(gunshot)

972
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:10,858
- Cooper!

973
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:11,859
(thud)

974
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:21,535
- Go get her.

975
01:18:22,744 --> 01:18:25,414
(ominous music)

976
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:48,520
(eerie music)

977
01:18:50,731 --> 01:18:53,066
- Are you going to shoot me?

978
01:19:01,658 --> 01:19:02,826
- Put them on.

979
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:07,831
(humming tune)

980
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:10,375
(eerie music)

981
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:19,718
- You're gonna shoot a little girl?

982
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,096
How would you explain that?

983
01:19:30,062 --> 01:19:31,063
- She's not a child.

984
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:34,566
She's a monster.

985
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:36,610
- We take her alive.

986
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:37,736
- She's already dead.

987
01:19:39,404 --> 01:19:42,241
(police sirens approaching)

988
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:43,408
I'll finish it.

989
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,618
- No.

990
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,494
No!

991
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:49,248
- Lisa!

992
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:50,707
Whoa, whoa, it's me.

993
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:54,294
It's me, not one of them.

994
01:19:56,255 --> 01:19:58,924
(ominous music)

995
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:06,265
(Taser clicking)

996
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:08,767
- Lieutenant Jenkins, tase her!

997
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:09,726
Tom, get in here!

998
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:11,311
Tom, get in there!

999
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:15,858
(Tasers clicking)

1000
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:33,959
- What happened?

1001
01:20:36,128 --> 01:20:37,087
The machine!

1002
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:39,631
- The transmitter!

1003
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:41,383
Keep an eye on her.

1004
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:43,343
(suspenseful music)

1005
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:44,303
- You okay?

1006
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:49,766
(machine buzzing)

1007
01:20:50,976 --> 01:20:53,979
(suspenseful music)

1008
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:18,378
(buzzing)

1009
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:31,058
(gunshot)

1010
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,355
(gunshot)

1011
01:21:36,396 --> 01:21:38,565
(buzzing)

1012
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:52,996
(gunshots)

1013
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,541
(fizzling)

1014
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:02,089
(computer beeping)

1015
01:22:09,263 --> 01:22:10,264
You did it.

1016
01:22:12,766 --> 01:22:14,643
(foreboding music)

1017
01:22:14,685 --> 01:22:15,936
- 60 seconds?

1018
01:22:22,943 --> 01:22:23,777
Cooper?

1019
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:27,531
Get her out of here as fast as you can.

1020
01:22:29,825 --> 01:22:31,451
- It's okay.

1021
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:34,288
(machine humming)

1022
01:22:44,715 --> 01:22:46,925
(chiming)

1023
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:49,303
They saw my thoughts. I saw theirs.

1024
01:22:50,304 --> 01:22:52,890
(hopeful music)

1025
01:23:01,315 --> 01:23:02,149
- Vernon?

1026
01:23:03,817 --> 01:23:05,819
- I thought we lost you.

1027
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:08,363
- Ditto.

1028
01:23:11,867 --> 01:23:13,076
- I missed you.

1029
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,371
But it's time to go home.

1030
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:23,086
He opened the portal for 10 minutes

1031
01:23:23,128 --> 01:23:26,089
at 7 AM everyday for a week.

1032
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:30,010
Had to point a gun at him but
the son of a bitch did it.

1033
01:23:41,313 --> 01:23:44,233
(foreboding music)

1034
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:49,947
(dramatic music)

1035
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:07,881
(groaning)

1036
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:24,231
- Come on!

1037
01:24:33,824 --> 01:24:34,658
Come on.

1038
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:37,911
(dramatic music)

1039
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:45,460
Come on.

1040
01:24:50,507 --> 01:24:52,509
(gasping)

1041
01:24:55,012 --> 01:24:57,181
(buzzing)

1042
01:25:13,322 --> 01:25:14,156
Go!

1043
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:19,828
No, no, no, no, no!

1044
01:25:23,874 --> 01:25:26,126
(groaning)

1045
01:25:31,215 --> 01:25:33,550
(whooshing)

1046
01:25:38,597 --> 01:25:39,932
(thud)

1047
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:44,269
(sighing)

1048
01:25:56,073 --> 01:25:56,907
Cooper?

1049
01:26:07,626 --> 01:26:09,837
- Welcome to 1951, doll.

1050
01:26:10,254 --> 01:26:12,798
(triumphant music)

1051
01:26:32,401 --> 01:26:33,652
- We'll do everything we can.

1052
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:37,072
- Is he gonna make it?

1053
01:26:38,407 --> 01:26:39,241
- I don't know.

1054
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:42,119
No one's ever been in another
time space that long before.

1055
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:45,581
What I can tell you,
though, is that nothing,

1056
01:26:45,622 --> 01:26:47,124
and I do mean nothing,

1057
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:49,918
survives outside its own time space.

1058
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,172
So your only chance of
survival is to return

1059
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:54,298
and I mean quickly.

1060
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:58,635
Listen, awhile back we
sent an orangutan through.

1061
01:26:58,677 --> 01:27:01,388
Upon his return he survived a couple days

1062
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:03,974
until he began aging very rapidly.

1063
01:27:05,601 --> 01:27:06,768
- So Cooper's?

1064
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:10,731
- Well, on the other hand,

1065
01:27:13,692 --> 01:27:15,277
I do have these little fellows.

1066
01:27:16,904 --> 01:27:19,531
(flies buzzing)

1067
01:27:19,573 --> 01:27:21,283
These are my test pilots.

1068
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:24,703
One journey forward and then back.

1069
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:25,746
Seven years ago.

1070
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:29,917
Surely you know the life
expectancy of a fruit fly.

1071
01:27:32,753 --> 01:27:33,921
We need to get you home.

1072
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,804
(electrical humming)

1073
01:27:48,602 --> 01:27:50,103
No one else needs to die.

1074
01:27:51,271 --> 01:27:52,314
Cooper will explain.

1075
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,405
Tell Cooper I said

1076
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:03,242
thank you.

1077
01:28:07,663 --> 01:28:09,915
(fizzling)

1078
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:16,213
(dramatic music)

1079
01:29:03,302 --> 01:29:04,761
- Figured you might need a ride.

1080
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:07,264
- You?

1081
01:29:08,724 --> 01:29:10,058
- I've been waiting for 64 years,

1082
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,518
you know I'm not very patient.

1083
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,270
- You are so --

1084
01:29:13,312 --> 01:29:15,189
- They figured out what happened
with the fruit flies.

1085
01:29:15,939 --> 01:29:18,609
The longer you stay out of
time, the longer you live.

1086
01:29:22,362 --> 01:29:23,280
You gonna resign?

1087
01:29:24,364 --> 01:29:25,199
- Maybe.

1088
01:29:26,783 --> 01:29:28,202
Why?

1089
01:29:28,243 --> 01:29:29,494
- I know an off book agency

1090
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:31,872
that could really use
someone with your skills.

1091
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:35,542
- It's really nice.

1092
01:29:47,596 --> 01:29:49,598
- I figured that typewriter computer thing

1093
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,725
might be pretty popular.

1094
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:53,977
So I invested every penny I had.

1095
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:07,658
(engine rumbling)

1096
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:10,410
(exciting music)

1097
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:15,874
(woosh)

1098
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:02,254
(somber music)

1099
01:32:01,688 --> 01:32:04,525
(dramatic music)
