1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,500
What is freedom?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,500
Are we born free or do we earn it?

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,500
And if you deny freedom to the quiet ones,
those who have no voice,

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
can you be free yourself?

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Or are you caged
by your own lack of compassion?

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,000
My name is Charlie Cranehill.
You’ll read about me in the news,

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,000
see pictures of me
with the word terrorist after my name.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,000
They say freedom isn’t free.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
Absolutely goddamn right.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
We spend our lives saying no.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Not me. Not my fight.
Not my problem. Not tonight.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
What’s the difference between you and me?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A few years ago I became someone
who said yes.

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,000
Me.
My fight. My problem. Tonight.

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000
THREE YEARS AGO

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Shit, I forgot to tell you Nicole called.
- What? When?

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
When you were in the shower.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
She’s got a new number.
I wrote it on the wall.

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,800
No, no, no, no, no. Don’t pick it up.
- I have to.

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,400
Don’t pick it up!
- It’s already picked up. Hi Dad.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,300
Charlie? Where are you?
- Riley’s.

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,500
Goddamn it, Charlie.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you want to blow off the rest of your life
messing around with that girl, that’s fine.

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,800
I’m not blowing off my life!
- But if I set up an appointment for you,
you goddamn well better be there.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Charlie, you should be on the highway right now.
- I’ll be there!

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
That girl…
- Her name’s Riley!

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Where are you going?
- Some job interview.

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
Some job?
- Friend of his. It’s some business thing.

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Okay, some business thing?
- Holy fuck, are you serious? Can we just eat breakfast?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He makes you ugly, Charlie. He makes you mean.
- This is me, Riley. If you don’t like it, I’ll leave.

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,000
That would be easy.
Why don’t you try doing something hard?

32
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,000
All your talk of  animal liberation,
and how it’s like the civil rights movement…

33
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
…or women’s suffrage… or slavery.
- It is!

34
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Okay.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you willing to break the law with me?

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,800
Nicole’s organized an action.
- What kind of action?

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,600
Breaking into the University labs,
and liberating the animals… tonight.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,900
Or, you can go to your interview
for some… business thing.

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
You again today. I’m gonna kick your ass again.

40
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,000
What the hell, Charlie?
- I skipped the appointment.

41
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Well, you certainly blew that one, didn’t ya’?

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And Charlie? If you think I’m ever gonna
stick my neck out for you again..
- I don’t.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,500
I love you, Dad. But you need to let go.

44
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,300
I have never forced anything on you.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,500
Yeah. Have a good night.

46
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
TWO YEARS AGO

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It’s okay.

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

49
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
WE WON’T STOP UNTIL YOU DO

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is my team.

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The government would call them my cell.

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But cells are cages.. and we are free.

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Our mission is simple.

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Liberate animals from places of abuse.

55
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,000
Inflict economic damage on those
who profit from their misery and exploitation.

56
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,000
Reveal those atrocities to the public.

57
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Never harm anyone, human or nonhuman.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Follow these rules,
and you are a member of the Animal Liberation Front.

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,500
What’s up, Charlie?
- How you doing?

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,500
Good, man. Good to see you.
- Hey, babe! Charlie’s here!

61
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,500
Ok, so what do you got for me?
- The red tape is footage from the liberation,

62
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,500
and the rest are recon from our guy on the inside.

63
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Make sure they’re breathin’.

64
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,000
If you see that they’re stopped breathing,
start like givin’ ’em a whack.

65
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
You better wake up!

66
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
You got ‘em all?

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,500
Yes.
- Good boy.

68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We’ll cut it together first thing in the morning
and get out the communiqué.

69
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
RIGHT NOW

70
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Yes, Toni?
- There are some people here to see you, with badges.

71
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Badges?
- Yes.

72
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,500
Really. Okay,

73
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,000
tell ‘em I’ll be there in just a moment.

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Hello, Mr. Cranehill.

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,500
I’m Agent Tamar Burke. This is my partner, Eric Johnson.

76
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We’re here about Charlie.

77
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
What about him? Is he okay?

78
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Do you know where he is?

79
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,500
Sir, have you ever heard of the Bold Native?

80
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,900
Bold Native is an alias for a terrorist or terrorist group

81
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,500
responsible for a series of attacks
costing almost a million dollars.
- Terrorist attacks?

82
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Medical labs, farms, all animal related businesses.

83
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,500
It’s part of a loosely organized group called
the Animal Liberation Front, or the A.L.F.

84
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,500
This is a letter claiming responsibility
for the arson of a poultry farm in Ohio.

85
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is a letter from your son
to one of his friends.

86
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
Some of the expressions
match almost word for word.

87
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,000
This is a journal
that we believe to be Charlie’s.

88
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,000
And on this last page it shows
a farm that was hit by arson.

89
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,000
Here’s a photograph
of your son with Jeff Breen.

90
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Where the fuck is Jeff?
- They nabbed him.

91
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Wyatt, you said one guard on break from 12 to 12:10.
- It was always just one guard. Come on!

92
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
I think he’s gonna talk.

93
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Jeff Breen connected a lot of dots for us.

94
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
He does hate your guts, Charlie.
- What did I do?

95
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,000
You were with Charlie, weren’t you?
- Yeah, he was skullfucking me like Indiana Jones.

96
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:49,000
You shoulda been there, Jeff.
I’m kidding, I’m obviously fucking around.

97
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
I just want you to answer the question, Sonja.
- Jeff, Charlie’s my best friend.

98
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,000
He’s been my best friend since we were like 12 years old.
You know this.

99
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Well that’s great.
- You’ve known this since we started dating.
I don’t even know why it’s a big deal.

100
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Well, where were you guys?

101
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Can you keep a secret?

102
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
You have to run.
- Wyatt, pull over.

103
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What the fuck?
- Pull the car over, Wyatt.

104
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,600
What am I supposed to do without you?

105
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
You’ll be fine.

106
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Dream on, Castaneda!
My head’s gonna go all Chernobyl, I swear!

107
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey! You brought him in!

108
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Jellybean!
It’s not your fault.

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes it is. I’m miss bad idea.

110
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,500
I love you. I believe in you. Okay?
I will be back.

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Bold Native has been quiet for almost two years.

112
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
It’s been four years or five since
you last heard from Charlie?

113
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can’t answer any more of your questions
without an attorney present,

114
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,000
so if you would like to make an appointment..
- We’d like to have a look around.

115
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
I don’t think that’s possible.

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,500
Mr. Cranehill, search warrant.

117
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thank you.

118
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
I’ll start with the back.

119
00:12:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
DAD, I KNOW YOU’RE WORRIED AND HAVING ME FOLLOWED.
I HAVE TO DISAPPEAR FOR A WHILE. I’M FINE. PROMISE. C.

120
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Shit!

121
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,000
Nice guitar. It’s a little dusty, but...

122
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
You know, you, you can take whatever you want.

123
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I want to know what kind of research you did
for the Happy Chickens ad campaign.

124
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,000
What?

125
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,500
Happy Chickens.
- Oh.

126
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You are the Karl Hansen that designed that campaign
for the egg industry?

127
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Our, our client was the state ag Board.
- Same thing.

128
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You know, I’m..
I’m, I’m sorry, I think..

129
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Whoo! Feelin a little drunk.
- Wanna sit down?

130
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

131
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oomph! Okay!
- I just wanna talk.

132
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Okay.
- Okay.

133
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,500
Alright. Okay. I’m gonna.. I cooperate here.
- Let’s sit, have a chat. Sit on your hands.

134
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What?
- Sit on your hands.

135
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Okay? Comfortable?

136
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,000
You’re an animal rights person.
- We’re all animal rights people.

137
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Just depends on what your definition of animal is.

138
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,000
For instance, I think that you have a right
to get married, unlike your parents.

139
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,000
What do you know about my parents?
- I know more than Bob does.

140
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Like the fact that they’re still alive.

141
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,500
You are very interesting, Karl.
- I am?

142
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
You are.

143
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
How do you breathe, living in such a cage?

144
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I don’t know what you are talking about.

145
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Are you an ex-gay in recovery?

146
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Conversion therapy for
unwanted same-gender attraction?

147
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
God, that must have sucked.
- It was fine.

148
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No. That’s not fine.
You got out, you said thanks Mom and Dad for saving me...

149
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
It made them happy. It didn’t hurt anyone.

150
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Both you and I know your boyfriend
wouldn’t stand for that bullshit.

151
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It was just easier to tell him
that they were dead.

152
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,500
Hiding mail, watching the phone, lies about business trips
when you’re just going to go see your parents?

153
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,500
Almost as much work as carrying on an affair,
which you also happened to pull off.

154
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,600
Unfortunate it was with an intern.
- Okay, what do you want?

155
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I want the money that you were paid
for that Happy Chickens bullshit.

156
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,500
Eighty-two thousand,
six hundred and fifty-two dollars.

157
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,500
You can use that computer to transfer the money
through a network we’ve set up.

158
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,500
I’m a vegetarian, you know.
- I do know that. Why is that?

159
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I like animals. I don’t wanna eat them.

160
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,000
You eat eggs?
- Free-range organic.

161
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
You know they kill all the male chicks?

162
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,000
Even with free-range hens.

163
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They’re too skinny to eat because they’re different
than genetically modified birds we call “broilers.” 

164
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:50,500
The males are useless, so we feed them through a chipper,
still chirping for their moms.

165
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,500
I didn’t know that.

166
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Most people would be upset by that.

167
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Just like most people would be upset if they were forced
to see the way that chickens are treated in general.

168
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:12,000
That’s why Happy Chickens is a cartoon, not footage
like what we’re watching, which is reality and not very happy.

169
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,000
So what are you gonna do with the money,
if I give it to you?

170
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,500
We break in to places like that and liberate animals.

171
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,500
The money buys equipment.
It buys food for the animals we rescue.

172
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,500
They’re all sick. Most of them need medical attention
for the rest of their lives.

173
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,500
That couch cost three grand.

174
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I was considering swallowing a bottle of Ativan
and lying down on it tonight.

175
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Okay…

176
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Right now, I really need you to tell me
that you believe that things can change.

177
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,500
Yeah I believe that things can change.

178
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay. Then I’ll give you the money.
But only if you take me.

179
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
What the hell did you say to him?

180
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It was more like what he said to me.

181
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Listen, I think he’s sincere,
but he may just be drunk and I may just be hopeful.

182
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,800
Ah, romance.
- I’m serious. He goes Judas,
it’s your ass down the rabbit hole.

183
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,900
My bad call on Jeff got you where you are,
so the worst case is we’re even.

184
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,300
But I trust you, all the way to the end.

185
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
This guy right here?
- This guy.

186
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Nice cows.

187
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,600
You got your earthquake kit there, pilgrim?

188
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Terrorist attack kit, actually.

189
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,500
So Karl, you can call me Sonja.
- Is that a code name?

190
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
Yeah, it was a toss-up between that and..
fuck you, what the hell are you doing here?

191
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I like Sonja better.
- Yeah, me too. For now.

192
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,500
We’re also encouraging you to begin frequent audits
of cattle slaughterhouses as practiced by McDonalds.

193
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That should ensure
that the captive bolt gun usage is..

194
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,800
rendering the animal unconscious before slaughter.

195
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,000
We’d like to end our protests

196
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,300
and as I’m sure you’d like to see them end them
as well I’m hoping we can find some common ground.

197
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,000
Our first request is that you consider
matching Burger King’s commitments.

198
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,000
Which ones are those?
- Requiring seventy-two square inches
per hen in battery cages.

199
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,200
Stopping forced molting.
- Forced molting?

200
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,500
Withholding food and water
to speed the laying process.

201
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Where are the numbers on the economic impact?
- Page twenty-two.

202
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,300
We’re also looking at a gradual shift to cage free eggs.
- Our research shows a shortfall in supply there.

203
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,300
Change takes time, so we’re looking at five percent
by the end of the year.

204
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,000
That should send a strong message to your customers
about your commitment to humane practices.

205
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,500
Hello, sorry I’m late.
- Mr. Sanders.
- Mr. Sanders.

206
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,900
Phil.. Hi, I’m Jack Sanders
- Jane Harreld.
- Please, continue.

208
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,800
Phasing out gestation crates for breeding pigs,

209
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,400
beginning with a commitment to purchase 20 percent of pork
from gestation crate free producers by the end of this year.

210
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
I was raised in a farm. Did you know that?

211
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,000
I didn’t know that.
- Yeah. Missouri.

212
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,000
Phil, did you know that?
- Yes sir, I did.

213
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Our last commitment is more symbolic.

214
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
A stated preference for poultry producers
who use controlled atmosphere killing.

215
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
The current practice of live shackling
and electric stunning reduces meat quality

216
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,200
and yield through routine broken bones,
bruising and hemorrhaging.

217
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,500
Controlled atmosphere killing allows the birds
to remain in their transport container,

218
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,600
where they’re exposed to non-poisonous gases
that cause anoxia,

219
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,900
and it’s also much easier on the slaughterhouse workers.
- There are significant costs involved in switching over.

220
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Actually, because of decreased contamination,
carcass downgrades, labor costs,
and other factors we’ve discussed,

221
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,000
most studies indicate an increase
in revenue over a period of a year.

222
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,300
There are details on page thirty-four
for your reference.

223
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,300
And, like I said, this is a purely
non-binding preference statement.

224
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,300
That’s the last issue, right?

225
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,300
We’re also encouraging you to begin frequent audits
of cattle slaughterhouses as practiced by McDonalds.

226
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,300
This would ensure that the captive bolt gun usage
is consistently rendering
the animal unconscious before slaughter.

227
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:10,000
Cows were my favorite animal when I was a boy.
Marvelous creatures.

228
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yes they are.

229
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Ms. Harreld, you seem to be a very reasonable individual
and I appreciate the presentation,

230
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,500
but unfortunately I have a plane to catch.
It’s been an absolute pleasure to meet you.

231
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,300
Mr. Sanders, you have an opportunity here
to take additional steps that would put you
in the forefront of the industry,

232
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,600
and would ensure that we won’t be meeting again
in a year or two so that you can catch up.

233
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,400
Young lady, this company does not take its orders
from a protest group who wants to
turn our customers into vegetarians.

234
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,900
We are here to work with you.
- But you’d much rather put us out of business, wouldn’t you?

235
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,500
I would much rather that if people are going to eat animals,
that those animals experience as little suffering as possible.

236
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,700
We can agree on that, can’t we?

237
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,700
That, Ms. Harreld, we can agree on.

238
00:23:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Have a good day.
- Have a safe trip, Mr. Sanders.

239
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I want people who have had these kind of cases before,
people who know the system. Thanks Evan.

240
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:14,000
And Frank, I want the best. Fly them in here as soon as possible.
I don’t care what it costs, just get it done.

241
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Charlie!

242
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Come on!

243
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Earthquake!

244
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,000
Come on, Sunshine. Get up.

245
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
What the fuck is that?
- It was in my uh.. my kit. You know it’s like a..

246
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
For like..
- Like an emergency thermal blanket thing. From the..

247
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Really. Wow.
What? It’s warm.

248
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It’s warm?

249
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ah, shit.

250
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Wow.
- What the fuck?

251
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,000
This is Karl’s blanket. This is Karl’s blanket.

252
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So cozy.

253
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What is alleged here by the government is
that your son engaged in arson, vandalism and theft, 

253
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,100
dealing with animal enterprises. That comes squarely
within the four corners of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act.

254
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,000
The Animal… Enterprise… Terrorism… Act.
- Okay.

255
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:32,400
The act targets animal activists. Ultimately, it wants to silence them
and to actually put them away for a long time.

256
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:38,300
They’ve taken property crimes and have labeled them
as terrorism as it relates to an animal enterprise.

257
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,400
Pharmaceutical industry,
the meat industry, they’re big business.

258
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,000
They banded together and asked for this legislation,
lobbied for this legislation, and they were very successful.

259
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,000
Legislators are not coming up with terrorism laws
for right wing extremists.

260
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,000
Anti-government, anti-abortion and white supremacist groups
who have either killed or injured people are not on the terrorism list.

261
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:06,300
These industries can get protection by convincing
the government that, you know, this is really domestic terrorism.

262
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,800
The penalties have increased exponentially.

263
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Each different company could be a separate act of animal terrorism.

264
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,500
If you have four or five different companies,
your son could face life imprisonment.

265
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Richard doesn’t know where his son is.
Should his son contact him, let’s say hypothetically..

266
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,000
Your phone conversations and everything you do
is probably being monitored right now.

267
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,000
It’s important to really look towards turning himself in.

268
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,000
You know, he can only run so long.
Eventually, they’re gonna find him.

269
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Damn it!

270
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Jesus Frank, I should have never stopped looking for him!

271
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
You have any idea where to find him?

272
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,500
He was living with a girl in Cedarville couple years ago.

273
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,900
Well, for what it’s worth,
I doubt they expect you to go looking for him.

274
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,500
I could drop you off on the other side of the lake,
they wouldn’t know about it until we got back.

275
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
What makes you think I can find him when they can’t?

276
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I don’t. But I do know what you’re gonna go through
if something happens to him and you didn’t even try.

277
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I mean, you wouldn’t be able to access any of your bank accounts,
call anybody you know,

278
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,000
not your office, not me, nobody.
You’d have to disappear there, Richard.

279
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
If I’m not on this boat when you pull in..
- Why don’t you let me worry about that, alright?

280
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:55,000
You know, I don’t know if you remember, but, uh,
we lobbied for that Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act.

281
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
If Charlie’s arrested as a terrorist,
they can pretty much do anything they want to him.

282
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,500
Richard, you deserve to see your son alive
and free again before you die.

283
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,900
Hey, not too short, Malik
- I got you, I got you. No worries, man.

284
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,200
So you really, really want to go underground?
You should get rid of this emo cut.

285
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,500
And, uh.. check this out here. Click these on…
- Woah, Malik! Malik!

286
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You looking like my main man Tylin over there!
You see him right there?

287
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,000
That’s how you gonna look, just like my man T.
He is killing the game right now.

288
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,000
You need some game too, so…
- I didn’t even really come in here for a haircut.

289
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,000
So if you didn’t come for a haircut then what’d you come for?

290
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,000
We’re trying to go national with this thing.
- National.

291
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,800
Think you could handle this region?
- I’m pretty well connected. I got a couple of people.

292
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You trust them?
- I trust those people about just as much as you trust him. Who’s he?

293
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Who is he?
- Who is that guy?

294
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I’m.. I’m Karl.

295
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,000
Uh.. I need to rent some… some surfing stuff.

296
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Wetsuit for sure.
Probably we’ll need a, uh… a towel too.

297
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,000
You know could I get that sticker too?
The shark one there.

298
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,000
There sharks out there? It’s a baby shark.
He’s mean though, look at that.

299
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Have fun.

300
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,000
How’s it going, Professor Straithern?

301
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,300
Charlie Cranehill! As I live and breathe
I never thought I’d see you out here today.

302
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
I’ve been recovering.

303
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,300
Three years of recovery, huh? We weren’t that drunk, were we?
- You know, I don’t remember.

304
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,400
Back for more education, Charlie?

305
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I got a killer class this year.
The American Empire and the fall of D.C.

306
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Always the optimist.

307
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,400
All that terrorist noise is nothing
but a profitable distraction.

308
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,600
The real war, Charlie, will be between the people
and the multinational corporations.

309
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,900
You mark my words.

310
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,500
Well, until then, you interested in a little frontline action?

311
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Hi pups.

312
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,700
The professor on board?
- He’s on board.

313
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Nico.

314
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:03,000
So what’s the plan, what are we up to?
- I’ve been waiting to show you my little shark contribution.

315
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I’ve named him Karl, Jr.

316
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That’s appropriate.
- Thanks.

317
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We’ve got a long road ahead of us.

318
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yo! What up, man?

319
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I’m feeling really friendly right now.
- Okay.

320
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
I’m feeling so…
- Here’s another friend.

321
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,500
Okay. Hey, guy! How ya’ doing? Ah, he didn’t care.

322
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,500
Hey guys! What’s up? Have fun down there!

323
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Oh god.

324
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Keep it going girls!

325
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,000
Nice wheelie, man!
Whassup?

326
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,300
You know, people wanna be talked to.
People wanna be acknowledged, right?

327
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,000
Hey guys! Happy Friday!
- Happy Friday!
- Thank you!

328
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,000
Whenever you’re afraid to talk to somebody,
just remember, people want to be talked to.

329
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
What am I, a robot?

330
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,000
And that’s good in advertising, that’s good in business.
That’s everything.

331
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Hello.
- Howdy.

332
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,500
Um… beer.

333
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
We got blonde on tap.
- Sure.

334
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Hey, uh, Cedarville - that’s just up the road, right?
- Eh… it’s a ways from here, but it’s north, yeah.

335
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,500
How far away is Cedarville?

336
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,000
It’s about three or four hours.

337
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,000
If I signed a contract with you, say for five thousand dollars,
would you drive me up there?

338
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,700
I brought a guy in once like you.

339
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,500
He’s the reason why Charlie was underground for two years.

340
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:19,500
He loved this cause, and he really… loved me, I think.

341
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
So…

342
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,500
it just doesn’t always work out.

343
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,700
Why are you here, Karl?

344
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I’m here because I wanna be here.

345
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,500
You can face up to decades if you get caught.

346
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,200
You will be prosecuted as a terrorist, do you know that?

347
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,000
Karl, if you want to leave this, no one’s gonna blame you,

348
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
but you can’t do this for you.

349
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
You just can’t do it for you.

350
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,500
I’m taking the jump into the deep end.

351
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,500
Alright. Let’s see if you can swim.

352
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I can swim. Did you know I was the most improved backstroke
when I was like ten years old?

353
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,500
I am fucking serious.
At the beginning of the summer I was slow as shit.

354
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,500
By the end of the summer I won like this little trophy,
like most improved backstroke.

355
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I just have to put my mind to something.

356
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
When I put, when I put my energy in the right arena…
- He just has to put his mind to animal liberation and it will happen.

357
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,000
I…
- He’ll just put his mind to it.

358
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
It’s about will!

359
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,000
So, I heard you’re looking for a ride.

360
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
I am, yes.

361
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Can you pay gas?

362
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,000
My name’s I-Rock, man. Nice to meet ’ya.

363
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,000
Iraq? Like the country?
- No, not like the country.

364
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
In fact, the last time I looked, I was nothing like a country.

365
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,000
I have been I-Rock for years, like years
before any of that shit went down.

366
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:05,000
Rock steady. Rock hard. Rock out! I…rock!

367
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
I get it.

368
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,500
So what’s your name?
- Richard.

369
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
This is Richard! We’re going on a road trip.

370
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Hi! I’m Shrine.
- I’m, uh, Richard.

371
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That’s a self portrait done by my friend. He OD’ed when
he was twenty five, and that was painted after that.

372
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,500
That’s my son. That was the first time he painted from a model
when he was sixteen. Do you have kids?

373
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah I do.

374
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,500
So, uh, is she, like, packing a bag or something?
- I dunno.

375
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I-Rock? I-Rock!

376
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
No, I rock.

377
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Where are you?

378
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
We’re taking this?
- Almost ready.

379
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Come on, let’s go.
- What else do I need?

380
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,500
Ah! You need anything?
- No!

381
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Hey! Hey! What’re you doing?!
- No! Just you wait! Ahhhhh!

382
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Jesus Christ! You’re gonna get us arrested!

383
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
It’s an eye rock!

384
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,900
I hate this smell.

385
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,300
I think we’re starting to get into “get the fuck off my property” territory.

386
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,500
You ever seen a baby calf taken away from its mother?
- No.

387
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,000
All these cows have had their children taken away
from them several times.

388
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Usually within about 24 hours after birth.

389
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,900
Then they’re hooked up to machines twice a day for months,
and we suck out the milk that they were producing for their stolen children.

390
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,200
The boys become veal calves. The girls are raised in crates
until they’re ready to birth themselves. 

391
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,200
Then after six or seven years when they’re completely worn out
and broken from life as a milk machine they limp up a ramp

392
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
and are led to slaughter.

393
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,500
I drink organic milk.
- That means they get organic feed,
but the process is still the same.

394
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,500
What do you think, Karl?
You getting any news ideas for Happy Animal campaigns?

395
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Let’s go. Got some trouble to start.

396
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah we do!

397
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Shit!
- Double or nothing?

398
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,000
You playin’ me?
- Just lucky, I guess.

399
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,500
Up to no good, I see.
- Charlie Cranehill. You wanna play?

400
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
With you? I don’t think so.

401
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,500
But I got some action you might be into.
- What kind of action we talking about?

402
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,000
How many actions?
- Dozens.

403
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,100
On the same day?
- That’s right.
- Hell yeah!

404
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,300
Wait up!
- Okay.

405
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
What the fuck was that, man?

406
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,500
I thought it was our best take,
so I did my little victory dance.

407
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah, well, your best take needs to be better, alright?
So we gotta do that all over again.

408
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,000
That sounded pretty good to me.
- What do you do, again?

409
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Advertising?

410
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,500
It sounded good to me too.
- Charlie, am I gonna have to kick you guys out of here?

411
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Nah, man I thought that sucked too. Let’s do that again, guys.

412
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,300
This time with some fuckin’ energy!

413
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Daisy, you look like you’re stoned. I mean, seriously let’s just,
like, get our shit together here.

414
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,500
I thought you wanted to whip these guys into shape.
- Um, I think I can handle it.

415
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,700
Actually, we’re hoping you can help us
handle some other unruly beasts.

416
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,600
So here’s the rules. You get to pick the tattoo,
I get to pick where it goes.

417
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,000
What kind of tattoo would you like?

418
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,900
Uh, how about an invisible one?
- Karl! Hey! You gotta do this, we all did this.

419
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,000
I’ll be the guy that doesn’t have one.

420
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Oh shit! Look at you!

421
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,800
Aw yeah, “man’s ruin.” That’d be sick!

422
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,500
I’m not familiar with this here.
- What up?

423
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
What up, girl? What’s going on with you?
- Chillin’.

424
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,000
You still drive that big rig?
- Hell’s yeah.

425
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,000
You down to move some packages for us?
- What’s the destination?

426
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
New homes.

427
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,500
If you see Buddha on the road, liberate him.

428
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Is it time?

429
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,500
We’re in the now, baby.

430
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I have an army of compassion awaiting orders.
- How many homes are we manifesting?

431
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,000
A good many. If we can afford food and medicine.
- Money man?

432
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,000
Wake up, doctor.

433
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,800
Oh. This better be good, Cranehill.

434
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,500
If by good you mean counting real sheep
instead of imaginary ones,

435
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,700
then yes, it’s good.

436
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,500
I assume we’re talking the usual?

437
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,500
Trauma, injuries, disease.

438
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I’ll put a team together.

439
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,000
Stat!

440
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,000
Don’t say stat.

441
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Diss!

442
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I can’t do arson, Charlie.

443
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Well it’s about the liberation.

444
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Any damage you can cause the facilities
is helpful but not necessary.

445
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,500
I’ve got a big bottle of buteric acid.

446
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,600
Where can I get one of those outfits?

447
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,500
Commit your life to cheeriness.

448
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,000
Fuckin’ A! Sign me up!

449
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
You in?
- In it to win it.

450
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Who the fuck are you?
- Oh, hey, how you doing?

451
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,500
Sorry, I didn’t mean to.. to disturb you or anything but..
- What do you want?

452
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Uh, does Riley live here?
- Who the fuck is Riley?

453
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,000
I don’t know who Riley is.
- Well I, uh, so Riley has never...

454
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,000
Who’s that?
- Oh, she’s with me.

455
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,000
Uh, I was just wondering..
- Tell her I said she’s hot. Please leave. Bye.

456
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500
Did you look for clues?

457
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,200
Now what?

458
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,000
Sorry to bother you again.
Is there any way we could come in and just take a look around?

459
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,500
You got a warrant?
- We’re not the police.

460
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Then you can fuck off.

461
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Oh! We’ll give you the antenna!

462
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,000
Did you find any mail when you moved in here?

463
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,500
Anything that might tell us about the previous occupant?
- Some redneck fucktard wrote on the wall.

464
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Alright, what would you do?

465
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I’d tell her, I got her number from a friend,
I’m passing through town with a friend, and I need a place to crash.

466
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,000
To crash.
- Yeah, say crash.

467
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,000
She’s gonna take one look at me and know that I don’t crash.
- We’ll work on that.

468
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,500
What kind of joint is this that we’re going to?

469
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This is an intentional..
she said it was an intentional community.

470
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,500
I guess they intend to live together
rather than accidentally living together.

471
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Can I try these on?

472
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
What? Here’s a shirt.

473
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,000
It’ll work. It’ll totally work.

474
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Get a sweater, jeans, and... a mustache.

475
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,500
She said, uh.. turn left at the second bridge.

476
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,000
You might want to hit the windshield wiper a couple of times.
- Yes sir. Interminnet.

477
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,000
In a minute?
- Interminnet!

478
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,000
Interminnet.

479
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,000
There, see.
- There’s the second bridge, right there, right there.

480
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,500
Bridge number two.
- Right there!

481
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,500
Okay!
- Don’t kill this bike.

482
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Trespassers will be violated?
- Huh.

483
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,200
Okay.

484
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,000
Hi. I’m Nicole. You must be Richard.
- I am. This is I-Rock.

485
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,000
Like the country?
- No, like… she rocks.

486
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,800
Got it. Hey, we’ve got a window of opportunity
before the rains come back.

487
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,500
We could use some help with the sandbags.
- Yeah!
- Great.

488
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You two together?

489
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,500
I-Rock? No. No, we just met.

490
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,900
Where you headed?

491
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I’m looking for my son, Charlie Cranehill.

492
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,000
You know him?
- I don’t think so.

493
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,500
Your phone number was on the wall
of Riley’s old apartment.

494
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I remember Riley.

495
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
My son is in trouble.. with the FBI.

496
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Don’t worry about it, they don’t know where I am.
I just need to talk to him before anybody gets hurt.

497
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,000
So what happens when I tell you
to get the hell out of here?

498
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Well, I guess I just call the FBI and tell them to come and talk to you.
- You’re not gonna get what you want by force, Richard.

499
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,500
He’s my son.
- Yes.

500
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,900
What is it that I’m supposed to do?
- You’re supposed to love him for who he is.

501
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Love him for who he is.

502
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,500
I do love him.

503
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,800
I don’t want to go to jail, Charlie.
- Me either.

504
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,500
You’re not having coffee with the FBI’s most wanted.
- Want me to scram?

505
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:20,000
I see you brought your shadow along for the ride.
- The Shadow knows, Peter.

506
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Operation Free Range.

507
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,000
Simultaneous attacks on
factory farms all across the country.

508
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Can you give us a minute?
- He’s cool.

509
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,500
Have you forgotten everything about security culture?
- We said you could trust him.

510
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,500
I heard that’s what you said about Jeff.
- Fuck you, man.

511
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,500
I don’t know who Jeff is, but.. I’m not a Jeff.

512
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,500
Factory farms, infrastructure, trucks, corporate offices,
all in the same night. We’re talking national press.

513
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,900
I don’t wanna talk about the why.
Let’s talk about the how.

514
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,000
How are these cells communicating?
- We’ve met with everyone face to face.

515
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,000
Who’s coordinating this?
- I am.

516
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,000
You. Mr. High Profile.  Mr. Hammy’s Jr.

517
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,500
Where are these animals going?
The weakest link is the people taking care of the animals.

518
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,500
Each cell is responsible for taking the animals home.

519
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Who’s writing the communiqués?
- I’ve got a small team. I’ve been working with them for years.

520
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,500
Do they know how to write?
Can they write full sentences?

521
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,800
You realize these actions
are going to be represented entirely by the communiqués.

522
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
We’ve got thirty-five actions
happening at the same time.

523
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,300
We get one communiqué out for that.
We can control the message.

524
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,000
Do I know these people?
- Some of them, maybe.

525
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,200
How do you know they can be trusted?

526
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,200
They don’t know each other.
They just know me.

527
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,200
You’ve been burned, Charlie.

528
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,000
You think it’s smart to be the guy
that knows everybody and knows everything?

529
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,300
I’m not gonna talk.
- Nobody plans to talk.

530
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,000
Have you ever even been interrogated?
- I’ve never been caught.

531
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:42,500
You’re sitting there, looking at forty years in prison.
They slide a piece of paper across the table,
saying sign here and give everyone up, and you walk.

532
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,000
Woah! Don’t get ahead of yourself, alright?
That is not gonna happen.

533
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,500
It’s gonna happen.
- It’s gonna happen.

534
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,900
You’re getting a big head.
Don’t think I don’t see it.

535
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,900
All I hear from the kids these days
is Bold Native this and Charlie Cranehill that..

536
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,700
Hey, you tell those kids Charlie Cranehill puts his tights
on one pantleg at a time like any other superhero, alright?

537
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
You used to be cute.
- Yeah? Well you used to have some balls.

538
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,000
Stop. Stop it. Jesus.

539
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,600
Every time another state outlaws cameras in factory farms
they succeed at hiding what they’re up to.

540
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:15,300
It’s gonna take something like this to get on the mainstream news.
- You can bet if this is big enough they have to cover it,

541
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:22,000
they’re not gonna talk about the why, only the how,
and the how is going to be exaggerated, distorted and sensationalized.

542
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:27,300
At some point people are going to start asking
why we’re willing to risk everything for these animals.

543
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,300
You’ve got way too much faith in people, dude.

544
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
I’ve got faith in us.

545
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,500
I’ve got faith that we’re right.

546
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,500
Have you heard of the Feral Child?

547
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,500
That’s what I thought.

548
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,500
He’s been distributing photos and videotapes of his work.

549
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,000
There’s a chance we can stop this shit,
but we have to act now and we have to find out who it is.

550
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,000
Now there’s a mission for you.

551
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,000
The worse it gets, the more Feral Children we’re gonna see.

552
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,000
What we’re planning is the only way to fight that.

553
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
People in the movement have to know
That there’s a lot of us out there.

554
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,500
You know my history. You know I’m down,
and I like this action, but I don’t like the way you’re going about it.

555
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And you’re not the one for the job.
- Then who is?

556
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I don’t know. Good luck.

557
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,500
What’s the Feral Child?

558
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,500
NINE WEEKS EARLIER

559
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,000
What the fuck? Ah!

560
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,000
Okay, okay! Mercy!

561
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Twizzler?
- Thank you.

562
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,900
Look what I found wandering the streets.
- Holy Jesus. I thought we said no more strays.

563
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,500
Did you find him covertly hiding
from the FBI inside a pumpkin patch?

564
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,500
I thought you quit.

565
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,000
That was a long time ago.
Welcome to the edge of the earth, brother.

566
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
We’re different.
- How?

567
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,500
Are you serious?
- Yes. I mean, are animals things or are they living entities?

568
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,500
Because they can’t be both.

569
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,500
We build buildings. We create civilizations.
And we use animals in the process.

570
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,800
Without the human mind, you wouldn’t even have the concept
of a moral right to talk about.

571
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:18,500
An animal only has one thing. Its life.
To take that one thing away, to me that’s a moral obscenity.

572
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,500
And the only way around that fact is apathy.

573
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,900
If that’s what you want for Charlie,
then I’d say you’re the one who wants to cause him harm.

574
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,500
How’s it going over there?
- I’m trying to make a wise man out of this stick.

575
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:39,000
You know a wise man once told me:
only a fool tries to make me out of a stick.

576
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Have you been doing, like, work work?

577
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I’ve been doing some hunting and gathering, no real work.
It’s been a lot of relationship making.

578
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:53,000
Right now I know how the whole system works,
so I know where the weaknesses are. I know where we can turn things.

579
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,000
I’ve been cutting together videos and sending them to you.
You’ve been getting the videos?

580
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
..

581
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
..

582
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
..

583
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
..

584
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,500
..

585
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
You work over at KDL?

586
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,500
..

587
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,800
I know they treat you like shit,

588
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,300
barely better than the animals,
and I know how they treat the animals.

589
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I work with people who want to expose the conditions there,
but we need help.

590
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
What kind of help?

591
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,000
Did you do the whole, like, hey, I got an alias…
- James Rollins.

592
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:50,000
James Rollins, how old, born where?
- James Rollins, twenty-six, born in Milwaukee.

593
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:56,000
Born in Milwaukee, what street, what’s your mother’s name?
Come on, dude. I’m the fuckin’ FBI.

594
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,000
Maiden name was Hamilton, changed her name.
Madeline Rollins, changed her name.
- Madeline Rollins.

595
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
Both your parents are alive?
- Yeah.

596
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Together?
- No.

597
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,000
No, not together. Was your father gay?
- That, that was the big problem.

598
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,000
What’s your favorite color?
- Green.

599
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,000
You’re fucked. That’s Charlie’s favorite color.

600
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,500
We knew we had you!
- No.

601
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Daniel, I’m running the risk of my life

602
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,500
the chances of getting it right

603
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:27,000
are slim to none, but I’ve got one.

604
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Down, down to the horsey track

605
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:42,000
we place our wagers on their heads

606
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:48,000
and hope our horsey does the best

607
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:55,000
‘cause it takes your best not to remember.

608
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,000
I know you love him.

609
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t.

610
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So be here. We’ll see what happens.

611
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:13,000
Run, run, little horsey run.

612
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:24,000
She’s burning, she’s burning, she’s burning up.

613
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
That’s really it.

614
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Oh, not the orange jacket!

615
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,500
Let’s see what you got.

616
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I raise.
- Oh, you guys already had your shoes off?

617
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,000
Baby, you understand you have to have
a hand here on this one, right?

618
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,000
Sock is in.
- Alright.

619
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Who just stole my hand?
You’re taking it home.

620
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Come on.
- Alright.
- There you go.

621
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I have always been fascinated by your chest hair pattern.
Always!

622
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,500
You like this?

623
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,000
Ooo, do that again. Do that again.
- I can’t do that again.
- No, that was amazing.

624
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:26,000
- I see the tide, crashing in on your man cleavage. It’s just like..
- I see an owl, look, with the little eyes..
- And the nipples are eyes.

625
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
- Okay, let’s, uh… let’s deal the next hand.
- No, let’s look at your nipples.

626
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Okay, this is already pretty ripe.
- Check.
- Check.

627
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,000
Why are you still in this hand?
There we go.

628
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Alright, well.. I guess you revealed your cards.
- It is on you, mon frere.

629
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
What do you got, what do you got? Hm? Let’s see
- You...

630
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Don’t do it.
- Nothing.

631
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Do it!
- Don’t do it.
- All in.

632
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,500
I figured it would come to this point.

633
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,500
What you got, baby?

634
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,500
Too sexy for my blood, I fold.

635
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,500
Alright, let’s see ‘em.
- You just did.
- The cards, slim.

636
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,500
Three queens, Elizabeth.
- Full house, Doogie Howser

637
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
You’re fucked forever!

638
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Card shark!
- Don’t cry.
- Naked boy.

639
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,000
That’s it, I’m done.
- Aw, really?

640
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,000
I am going to bed

641
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,500
right after I stick my tongue in your mouth.

642
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,500
I’ll miss you terribly, and I will miss you terribly

643
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,500
Give me this.

644
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

645
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,000
Behave... or don’t

646
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,500
Goodnight.

647
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Can I have my clothes back?

648
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Okay.

649
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It’s not the shake in the boy that counts, it’s the boy in the shake.
- And what the fuck is that supposed to mean?

650
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,500
Means I missed you

651
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,000
I missed you too.

652
00:58:11,500 --> 00:57:13,000
I don’t think Wyatt would like that.

653
00:58:14,500 --> 00:57:17,500
Wyatt’s a good slice. We’ve got an understanding.

654
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,800
Oh no.
- Yes, yes it’s coming.

655
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,500
You! At the end of the table!

656
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Sorry, I’d like to propose a toast to Jane.
- Yes!

657
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,500
As you all know she had some good news today.

658
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,500
Jack Sanders has agreed to all the terms
she proposed, all of them.

659
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,500
Another fast food corporation on board.

660
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You mean gets on the “happy meat” train right?
- Not tonight, come on Dennis.

661
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,000
I’m sorry to rain on your parade.

662
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:48,200
What have you really accomplished except making people feel better
about imprisoning and killing animals for pleasure and profit?

663
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:53,000
As long as they’re property they’re going to be exploited.
- Dennis, shut up.
- No, no, no, no, no, he’s right.

664
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
No, he’s not right
- He’s right to be unsatisfied.

665
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,300
I think it’s a little selfish to want everything or nothing.
The animals don’t benefit from that.

666
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:05,000
They would prefer to live in slightly better conditions,
and they would prefer to be killed in slightly more humane ways.

667
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,000
And if that is all we can get right now,

668
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,500
I think it’s worth it.

669
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And you think anyone else will see it that way? Or do you think
they’ll go buy their double bacon cheeseburger with a sense of peace,

670
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,000
knowing that these animals were treated well?

671
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:24,000
Someone needs to speak out and not just get these petty,
you know, legislation upgrades.

672
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:30,000
The only change that has ever been made is when someone spoke up,
when someone said, “It is not right to have slaves.”
- She is speaking up!

673
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,000
That’s exactly what she’s doing!
- When do you ask for what you want?

674
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,000
I can’t panic because they need help now!
They do need help now.

675
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,900
So do something now
- I am doing something now.

676
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,400
Don’t do something that will improve their living conditions
five years from now, ten years from now.
- Stop, this is a party for her, alright?

677
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,000
It’s okay.
- No, no, seriously.

678
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,000
There is a majority of people
who feel it is their right to eat meat,

679
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,000
their biblical right, and we have to talk to them.

680
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,500
I think the only moral choice is to take the choice away.

681
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,500
But it’s not possible.
- Dare to dream, Jane.

682
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
And how’s the piece coming?
- You wanna see?

683
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,000
Yeah.

684
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,500
Don’t say anything, okay?
- I won’t

685
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,500
Promise.
- Sure.

686
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,500
This is George.

687
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,000
See? It’s just a dumb animal.

688
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:55,500
I guess he could be feeling emotions like ours,
or it could just be instinctual reactions.

689
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,500
Take away language and all we can do is guess.

690
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,000
Hi Jumper! Hi.

691
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,000
Must be nice to have some company
through these lonely nights.

692
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,500
Shut up!

693
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,500
We just have to keep the line moving
and sometimes the pigs fall on the floor
and that’s when you have to do it.

694
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,900
George owns the company
that employs our friend on the TV here.

695
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,500
I’ve see people just take a hammer and start hitting them.

696
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,500
I’ve seen pigs with their whole heads crushed
just get thrown inside the dead box and three days later,
they’re still alive.

697
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
We take the water hose and stick it down their throat
and blow them up until the buttholes pop out.

698
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
We drown them to death.

699
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,000
Today I came to work
and there was one pig in the dead box staring at me.

700
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:48,000
My manager asked me to take care of it
and you want to know what I did?

701
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,500
It’s called thumping.

702
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:56,500
I picked it up by the legs
and smashed it against the cement.

703
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,000
My clothes were covered with blood.

704
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,500
That’s why I came here to talk to you.
Because I don’t think I can do it anymore.

705
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,500
George ordered that they turn the voltage down on the stunner

706
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,900
because it tends to ruin the meat,
and they have to sell it at cut rate for hotdogs.

707
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,700
Of course, that leads to the hogs
going through the line conscious and all,

708
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,800
but George has got confidence in his men to deal with that.

709
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,500
A hog comes out kicking too much, I let it go.

710
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I’m not going to take another kick in the face

711
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,200
just because old man Masseray
wants to keep his line running at impossible levels.

712
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,500
That hog hits the tub, goes all the way through the scald tank,
out to the dehairer, and to the dry kill… alive.

713
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,500
I’ll kill him after he’s had his hooves off,
his toes cut down for the meat hooks, when it’s nice and safe.

714
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,300
You lied to me!

715
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,000
Oh, you thought I was going to use the footage
to cut together a piece to send to our congressman?

716
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,000
I didn’t work at a shitheel bar for three months
so you could torture people with this footage!

717
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:56,000
It’s not torture, it’s an enhanced interrogation technique.
- That’s funny.

718
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,300
I am forcing empathy upon someone
who refuses to experience it!

719
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,800
This is a very complicated conversation
for the middle of the night. What’s going on?

720
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,500
Charlie has concerns.
- Oh, about hoo-hoo-ha-ha?

721
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,500
Charlie...

722
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
You didn’t tell me what you guys were doing.

723
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:19,500
Cranehill, have you seen one of these? Like, actually up close?
- Yeah.

724
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,000
Of course you have, so have I.
It’s a pig-sticker.

725
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,500
This is how they kill them.

726
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
They just stick them right into their fucking necks
and let them bleed out.

727
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,000
Do you know who’s never seen one of these until two days ago?

728
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
George.

729
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:45,000
He’s built a multi-million dollar corporation, bought an estate,
sent four fat bastard children through Groton and Loomis,

730
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:51,000
takes the two and a half week vacation to Fiji every year,
had never fucking seen one of these.

731
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:59,000
This is a guy who’s spent his entire life putting miles and miles
between him and the  blood that he spills,

732
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:03,500
and all we’re doing is lessening that distance a little bit.

733
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Do you remember that video that you sent us?

734
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:13,000
The one with the Mexican guy who had the big scar from here to here
because the pig kicked him when he was trying to slaughter it?
- Yeah.

735
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,500
That was a good look right?

736
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,500
Maybe George could use something like that.

737
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,800
Don’t you want them to suffer for what they’ve done?

738
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,500
Don’t you think that he deserves to feel a little pain
in exchange for the suffering he’s caused,

739
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,500
all in the name of making a buck?

740
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,500
Fuck, you know what that man has done!

741
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,500
Don’t you want him to suffer?

742
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah. I do. I want him to suffer.

743
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,000
Goodnight.
- ‘Night.

744
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It’s a good thing, man

745
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Ouch.  Hello?

746
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Let’s go! Let’s go.

747
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,500
Shut the fuck up.

748
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,500
She went all Colonel Kurtz, huh?
- Yeah.

749
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Chop ‘em up?
- No.

750
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,000
What, no machete?
- Fresh out.

751
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:28,000
Look what they did to me! Look at this! Huh? You see that?

752
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yes! I see. Just like I’ve seen what you’ve done.

753
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
None of it’s okay with me.
Just find a new line of work!

754
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,000
He was a motherfucker, Sonja.

755
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:46,000
You read the books, watch the videos.
It’s the kind of shit you wish would happen.

756
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,000
They build the cages, we crack them open.
That’s the way of the world.

757
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,500
If we start building the cages, our hearts will die.

758
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Where’s Ricki at these days?

759
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Well, they’ve certainly made the high life.
- You think they’re in on it?

760
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,500
I’d recognize your work anywhere.

761
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,000
She wants a dossier on every one of these creeps.

762
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:19,300
You gotta hand it to her.
She put together the all-star team.

763
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:24,500
Factory farm owners, slaughterhouse owners,
breeding facility owners, laboratory owners, 

764
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:30,900
USDA supervisors, congresspeople, lobbyists,
government officials, advertising execs, fast food moguls...

765
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:38,800
The very people who profit most from the suffering and death
of over nine billion animals a year.

766
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
My dad’s on this list.
- Guess your dad’s a creep.

767
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,700
You know what she’s doing?
- Nope. Don’t want to.

768
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,300
Trust me?
- Is love a four letter word?

769
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,500
Don’t give Riley any more info.
- Civil war?

770
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Rogue state, Ricki, rogue state.
- Silencio.

771
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:02,000
How long has it been since you saw Charlie?
- t’s been a while.

772
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:11,000
It doesn’t sound like it’s good between you two, is there a reason?
- Only one that I can think of.  I’m an imperialist pig, and he’s not.

773
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,300
Do you want him to be?

774
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,000
Here take this.
- What’s this?

775
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:23,000
It shoots a stun ray that will incapacitate security guards
for about seven minutes.
- Seriously?

776
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:28,000
No Captain Jackass, it’s a pen. It writes shit.

777
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,500
This is our greenhouse. You want to put your hand in manure?
- No, I think I’ll pass.

778
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
It’s warm.

779
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:40,000
You can’t feel it on the outside.
You gotta stick your hand inside.
- I’m not doing it.

780
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:51,000
So how many actions do we have?
- A little over thirty.
- Nice.

781
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,000
All in the same night, all over the country.

782
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,500
But if we really want to make a dent,
we’re gonna need to hit infrastructure.

783
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:06,500
Well, we could scramble the truck routes
and shut down all the corporate computer systems.
- Yeah, I like that.

784
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:14,000
Okay, you’re really creeping me out now.
- You know? If you interrupt my meditation again,

785
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:19,000
I will open a medieval can of whoop-ass on you.
- Bring it, Casper

786
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,000
Jesus Christ.
- My skills are epic. Watch my feet. Watch my feet.

787
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:27,500
Stop moving your feet.
Your death will be swift and cinematic!

788
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Roundhouse.

789
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Fall back grasshopper, fall back.

790
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Aww come on, man! Fuck this noise.

791
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I’m gonna get some burritos.
- Bitchin’ out Sonja?

792
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:30,000
Just taking a break twinkle toes.
- Oooo! Low blow, skank.
- Yeah, well, that’s my M.O.

793
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,000
This Karl Hanson’s a vegetarian.
- So?

794
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,000
So what’s he doing creating ads for the poultry industry?
- I don’t know.

795
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,000
What’s the Feral Child?

796
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
It’s a path we don’t want to go down.

797
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
You are going to love this place.

798
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,700
What is that? That is fucking dope.

799
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
There’s probably somebody sleeping in there right now.

800
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,000
It’s a wonder van.
- Karl.

801
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,000
Have you had your spanking today?
- Have you had your spanking? Because I will spank you.
- I have not.

802
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,000
Ow! Jesus!
- Come on, it’s a butt not a testicle, let’s go.

803
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,000
God, your ass is firm!
- Thank you.

804
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:25,000
Are you kidding me? Is that a zipline?
Alright, are you ready to do this Karly?
- Frickin’ yeah. You’re going first.

805
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,500
I was born first.

806
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Woooo! Oh God.
- Come back strong, come back strong.

807
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
All right, my turn, my turn, my turn.

808
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I’m going to go get some more wood.
I’ll be right back.

809
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,500
Hi Charlie.

810
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,500
Do you know who that is?
- It’s okay. He needs to talk to you.

811
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Are we on a mission here? Are we together?
- Yes.

812
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,400
I’ve traveled this country the last two years
hunting down every animal liberator I could find

813
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,800
and putting together the largest coordinated effort
this movement’s ever seen.

814
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,500
I’m not here to chat with my father okay?

815
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,500
Do you know what we’re doing tomorrow night?
You think he’s going to hop in the car with us?

816
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Isn’t that what you really want?

817
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,500
Fuck! Are you fucking crazy?

818
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:42,500
That is the only real way of winning this thing,
to talk to the other side.

819
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,500
He’s not here for a joyride. He doesn’t just want to talk.
He doesn’t want to see how I’m doing.

820
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,700
Why is he here?
- Why? Because he loves you.

821
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,400
No, he didn’t tell you why he’s here.
- Give me a little credit.

822
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:59,400
I’m surprised you’re not in handcuffs right now.
Good work. I’ll give you credit for that.

823
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Come on Boy Band! Hustle! What?!?
Who’s your daddy now?

824
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,500
Who is your Daddy?  Winner winner, soy chicken dinner!
- Sonja!

825
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,500
Jumping Jesus on a pogo stick.
- Where’s Charlie?

826
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,300
Gee Mr. Cranehill, Charlie and I kind of
drifted apart after high school.

827
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,500
It’s good to see you though, huh?
Come on!

828
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I don’t believe you.
- Really? I was trying so hard.

829
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,000
That way.

830
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
She says you need to talk to me?

831
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,000
How you doing?
- I’m fine. You?

832
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Yeah, well, I’ve been better.
- How’s business?

833
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,000
Charlie, what are you doing?
- Talking to you.

834
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:20,000
I need you to be honest with me right now, okay?
- Great, might as well try that.

835
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I’m just trying to talk to you Charlie, that’s all.
- You are talking to me, Dad.

836
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,600
Are you this Bold Native, this terrorist?

837
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Is that what they told you?
- You tell me.

838
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,600
Okay. Bold Native’s not a person. It’s an idea.

839
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
That animals are not property, they’re not ours to use.
They’re an end unto themselves.

840
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,300
Their freedom is beautiful, and their slavery is a horror.

841
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:55,000
You’re going to hurt somebody someday Charlie,
and that’s something that you can’t take back.

842
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,000
That’s not what we do, Dad.

843
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Violence isn’t going to get you anywhere.
- I agree.

844
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,000
Then what are you doing this for?
- Doing what?

845
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:09,300
Burning down buildings and destroying property, for Christ’s sake.
- God! You miss the whole fucking point.

846
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,000
You’re distracted by the fire. Who cares?
- People care.

847
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:18,800
Who cares? You can’t commit violence against property, okay.
Isn’t that what your whole system is based on?

848
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,500
Animals are property, so killing them isn’t violence.

849
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:28,500
It’s processing or it’s rendering or confinement,
anything to keep from calling it what it really is.

850
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:35,500
Beef not cow, pork not pig, get it?
Poultry, not chicken..

851
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,200
Your whole system is a lie, a disgusting, filthy lie.

852
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Charlie, listen to me. Listen to me!

853
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:49,500
The federal government is looking for you.
Do you know what that means?

854
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:58,300
It means they’ve been corrupted by agribusiness corporations.
- No, it means you could go to prison for a fucking long time.

855
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:02,000
Is that what you want?
- No, dad. I don’t want to go to prison.

856
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,500
I can buy you a new identity. We can hide you someplace.
- Hide me?

857
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Yeah, like, I don’t know.. Mexico maybe.

858
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Mexico? I’m an American, Dad.
Believe it or not that means something to me.

859
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
What are you going to do?
- It’ll be big, bigger than anything they’ve seen so far.

860
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,500
You could be part of it.

861
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,500
Jesus. Fuck.

862
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Please Charlie, come home.

863
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Please Son, just come home.

864
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,500
Look, you can do anything you want.

865
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:04,000
You can stay up late, play music loud, eat pizza.
Miss meetings, it doesn’t matter.

866
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Please, come home. I need you.

867
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,500
Charlie, I miss you.

868
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,500
Don’t ask me to do something you’d never do, Dad.

869
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Come on, Charlie. Focus for me. Really, I’m serious.

870
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I have a lot of friends who could help.

871
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:30,000
I’ve made a lot of friends over the years, connections,
and I’ve garnered a lot of favors..

872
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,000
and all you have to do is just be a little contrite, that’s all.

873
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:41,500
Just say that you know what you were doing was wrong,
and you’re sorry for it, and they’ll step up to the plate.

874
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Then, if you still want to do all you can for the animals
then we’ll find a group that does the same thing

875
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:55,000
only in the legal way,
and I’ll help you with that Charlie. I’ll help you with it.

876
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Will you hold onto this for a second?

877
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,500
I’ll go with you if you kill this dog.

878
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:11,000
What the hell’s the matter with you? I’m not gonna kill this dog.
- Why not?

879
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:17,500
I thought you wanted to save animals’ lives.
- I saved this dog’s life years ago,
so I guess it belongs to me, right?

880
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,800
You’ve got no problem buying animal bodies
from people who claim to own them.

881
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,500
Don’t tell me you’re too weak to kill one yourself.

882
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,500
What’s one little dog’s life compared
to the safety of your own son?

883
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,500
I’m really losing my patience here Charlie.

884
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Oh, I’m sorry. Fuck! I didn’t mean to tax your patience.

885
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:36,500
If I told you I’d go with you if you ate a steak
you’d sit right down and eat it, right?

886
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,500
If it makes you feel better, you can eat the dog after you kill it.
- Stop being a child, will you?

887
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,500
Come on, do it! One quick slash to the throat,
a little blood and all your problems are over.
- Stop it.

888
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Kill it! Kill it. Kill it.
- Stop it!

889
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,500
Kill the animal!
- Stop it!

890
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,800
They live in unbearable pain and loneliness
just so you can sell their bodies a little bit cheaper,

891
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
make a few more cents than the other guy,
you evil fucking bastard.

892
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:04,500
Your patience is wearing thin?
Well mine’s fucking gone.

893
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,500
I’m the most impatient motherfucker you ever met.

894
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
You think your stinking evil has no impact?

895
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:17,000
Billions of animals a year, they don’t matter?
Believe me, they do.

896
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Now kill the fucking dog, you fucking hypocrite.

897
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:29,000
This is all your kingdom’s based on.
You live without love, Dad.

898
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,000
That’s a pretty sweet speech you gave.

899
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,500
It was badass.

900
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,500
Kill the animal! Kill the animal!

901
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:17,000
You know where I hear is really nice this time of year?
- No, where do you hear is really nice this time of year?

902
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Fuckin splitz-ville
- Oh yeah?

903
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I hear it’s not raining dear old dads with control issues.

904
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:29,000
If you need to go I’ll understand,
but I don’t think I can run from this one.

905
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:34,000
I mean, if we leave, he’ll definitely flip us,
and we can’t get far enough in that time.

906
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Maybe you can, if I stay here.

907
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I’m like a broken record, Charlie,

908
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:48,000
all the way to the end, all the way to the end, all the way to the end...
- I know, I know.

909
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
This is Richard Cranehill.

910
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You just want to know I’m going to be okay.

911
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,000
Yeah, Charlie, that’s all I want.

912
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,500
I am.

913
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,500
I’m okay.

914
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I’ve never been so totally okay in my life.

915
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:04,000
You gotta trust me on this one, Dad.

916
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Okay.

917
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:09,500
And I wanted to thank you.

918
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Without everything you taught me,
I never could’ve organized something this big.

919
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:18,500
If you can’t accept my choices,
maybe you can accept my gratitude.

920
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Thanks, Pop.
- Oh Charlie.

921
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Hey, you guys got a minute? I need some help.

922
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I got some pretty heavy stuff
that I gotta bring up to the top.

923
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,500
Police! Get on the ground.

924
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:46,500
Get on the ground.

925
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Charlie, don’t!

926
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,500
Charlie!

927
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,500
Drop the knife!

928
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,200
Drop it!

929
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,200
I need you to stay free, okay?

930
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,500
Drop it!

931
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,500
Get on the ground.

932
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Alright, let’s hook ‘em up.

933
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:49,000
What is the nature of your participation in these Bold Native actions
that you’re promoting on your website?

934
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,500
Aren’t you advocating this kind of criminal behavior?

935
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,600
I believe in the Bold Native.

936
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,500
I believe in freedom.

937
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:00,000
I believe a cage is a cage
and no one deserves to be put in one.

938
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,500
I would love to be let out of mine,

939
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,900
but I’m not willing to sacrifice another living being
to one in order to achieve that.

940
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,000
So you’ll have to forgive me
if I don’t recognize someone else’s right to do it

941
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,700
just for a motherfucking hamburger.

942
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:24,500
Thirty-five actions in thirty-five states,
all on the same night.

943
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:29,000
Thirty-five communiqués all issued through the website
run by you and your girlfriend.

944
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:31,600
Sounds like a conspiracy,
sounds like you’re right in the middle of it.

945
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
We are just a conduit for information.
It’s called journalism.

946
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,500
Do you go out with them when they do this, Randy?

947
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,500
What people are we even fuckin’ talking about?

948
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
We’re kind of fuckin’ talking about Charlie Cranehil, Randy.
- Crano?

949
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:51,000
Cranehill.
- Cranehill. Nothin’.

950
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,600
What is the nature of your relationship with Richard Cranehill?
- There’s no relationship between Mr. Cranehill and me.

951
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,700
That’s not what we heard.
- You heard wrong.

952
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,500
What was Charlie Cranehill doing on your land?
- Gardening.

953
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,500
I don’t know if you notice you’re in handcuffs.
- I did notice that.

954
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Ricki’s already given us names.

955
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,000
Are you really willing to rot in jail
while she just rolls on to the next guy?

956
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:17,800
We’ve already talked to everybody in your community.
- You may have their back, but they don’t have yours.

957
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Do you really expect us to believe that you don’t know
who any of those people are?

958
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:26,000
I know nothing. 1-2-3 nothing.

959
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,500
You can talk to us.
- My lawyer’s on her way.

960
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,500
Sit the fuck down, Randy!
- You punch me, we have a problem.

961
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I need one cc of dex.

962
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,700
I’m a hemophiliac, I’ll bleed internally ‘til I die.

963
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,500
Motherfucker, I don’t give a fuck what you are,
I will beat your ass with this fuckin table.

964
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,700
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

965
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,800
I’ll ask you one more time.
- Ask me twice.

966
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,500
So you had plenty of chances to escape.

967
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:20,000
They said that they were going to tell my parents
that I had not escaped the snares of the homosexual lifestyle.

968
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,500
Okay, so rather than come out of the closet
as a thirty-five year old man,

969
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:30,000
you decided to go cross-country joyriding
with a self-confessed terrorist?

970
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:34,500
I was scared.
I didn’t see anything. I just want to go home.

971
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
What did Cranehill whisper to you
while he was getting apprehended?

972
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:47,500
He said that they would let him write letters from jail.
He told me my parents’ address.

973
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:52,500
If you’re lying to me, I’ll fuck you.
And you won’t like it.

974
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,500
Yeah, I’m sure no one ever has.

975
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,500
So how long have you been involved with Bold Native?

976
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,500
Can I smoke?

977
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Sure.
- Too bad I don’t smoke, suckas!

978
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,500
Hey!
- Oh!

979
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
We’re not playing here, okay?

980
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,500
Now I know you want to play games and all that shit.

981
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I’ll get a judge and jury,
and they’ll play a fucking game with you, okay?

982
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
You motherfu..

983
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
we take threats against America seriously.

984
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,500
Quit fuckin’ with me, kid.
- Okay.

985
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Alright? Don’t fuck with me.
- Okay!

986
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,500
Quit fuckin with me.
- Sorry.
- Goddamn it.

987
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Charlie loves America.

988
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:46,500
So do I.

989
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,500
Jesus, I’m hot for America.

990
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I want to push America up against the wall,
and I want to fuck her senseless.

991
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:02,000
And then I want to give her a bubble bath
and feed her some chocolate.

992
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Yeah. We go way back, me and America.

993
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
That’s my girl!

994
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I got nothing.

995
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,500
Swaaamp.

996
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,500
Well, I’m not gonna lie.
It was a little scary at first…

997
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,500
…but Tiffany, can I be honest with you?
- Please! That’s why we’re here!

998
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,500
What was really scary was finding out the truth
About how we treat these farm animals.

999
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,900
The authorities are keeping the identities
of the terrorists secret right now,

1000
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,700
but can you give us a scoop on who your captors were?

1001
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,800
You know, this is gonna sound crazy,
but I think that they were heroes,

1002
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:46,500
and I know that they were against terror of all kinds,

1003
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,000
especially the terror that we cause animals in these factory farms.
- I must say, it does sound like you may have been brainwashed.

1004
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,800
When you witness cruelty, no matter who the victim is,
you have to ask yourself,

1005
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,500
 if you can see what’s happening,
will you turn away and do nothing?

1006
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
You have kept me on hold now for twenty minutes.

1007
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I’ve been watching the news on the attacks.

1008
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:13,500
The attacks that happened while my son was in your custody,
so obviously he had no information for you.

1009
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,500
Well somebody’s gotta know where the hell he is!

1010
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:25,000
My son is not an enemy combatant!
He’s an American, goddamn it, with rights!

1011
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:31,500
Yeah!

1012
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,500
Your noon appointment is still waiting.
- Right, right. Send her in.

1013
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,000
Hello, Mr. Cranehill.
- Hello.

1014
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,500
Jane Harold.

1015
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:54,500
Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

1016
01:34:55,500 --> 01:35:01,000
Thank you. So, hopefully you have had a chance
to look at the material we sent.

1017
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,200
I read it.

1018
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Great! Okay.

1019
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:12,400
So, our first request is that you consider matching the humane standards
as practiced by the other fast food companies that we’ve been dealing with.

1020
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:18,000
The first requirement is that your suppliers
provide seventy-two square inches per laying hen.

1021
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,000
Will that make them happy?
- Happy?

1022
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Happy.

1023
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,000
Isn’t that your goal?

1024
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:33,000
Did you know that a laying hen, if given a choice,
will build a nest rather than eat,

1025
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:36,000
even though they haven’t had any food in twenty hours?
Did you know that?

1026
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,600
So, why don’t we provide building material,
nesting material for them?

1027
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,500
And maybe give them access outside so they can dustbathe?

1028
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Give them some semblance of a real, normal life,
in exchange for what we take away from them.

1029
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,500
What do you think about that?

1030
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,000
That would be above and beyond
what we’re asking for today, but..

1031
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:02,000
I have a question for you.
How do you do it?

1032
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:11,500
How do you come into offices like this and squabble
with people like me over a few extra inches?

1033
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:19,500
How is it that you can sit there, in your politeness,
and your grace, and basically ask people for nothing?

1034
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,500
How do you do it?
How do you beg for little scraps of humanity?

1035
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:30,000
I... I think change is change.

1036
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:35,500
Challenge me. Tell me what you want.

1037
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,500
We, uh…

1038
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
What do you mean?

1039
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:47,500
Tell me exactly what you want from me.
I’ll do anything you ask.

1040
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I want you to stop.

1041
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I want you to stop.

1042
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I want you to stop killing for money.

1043
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:15,500
I want you to stop selling the flesh of animals.

1044
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,500
I’m gonna quit this job,

1045
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:39,500
and if anybody asks I’ll tell them exactly why.

1046
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:46,500
But that’s all I can offer you.
I can’t change this company.

1047
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:50,700
This company would chew me up,
just like those baby chicks.

1048
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
How do you know all this?

1049
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,000
I don’t know if any of what you do makes sense.

1050
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,500
But I wish it did.

1051
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,500
Goodbye, Ms. Harrold.

1052
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Thank you.

1053
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Animals were harmed during the making of this movie.

1054
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:06,000
But not by us.

1055
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Lat year, 10 billion animals were killed for food in the US alone,
after being raised in extreme confinement.

1056
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Over 150 million animals were caged
and tortured in American Laboratories.

1057
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Every vegan saves at least 90 individual lives each year.

1058
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:38,000
titulky:  whack
