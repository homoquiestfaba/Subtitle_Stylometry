F3RDOUS

2
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:06,335
During the Tang Dynasty on the way to the Buddhist sutras,

3
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:11,142
Monk Xuanzang conduct diplomatic relations with India.

4
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:15,207
Then Wang Xuance travel to India.

5
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,189
There, he made a great contribution to the development of cultural relations.

6
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:32,290
In 647 AD, Arunasva, general of the Kingdom of Magadha try to seize the throne of India.

7
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:36,098
On Wang Xuance second mission to India,

8
00:01:36,104 --> 00:01:40,200
Arunasva team lead elephant for him.

9
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:42,301
Wang Xuance.

10
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:47,053
I came on the orders of General Bhima Majesty Gitajani.

11
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,920
Embark on a horse.

12
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:55,154
Messenger, Arusnava have mastered Magadha, and the city was in ruins.

13
00:03:55,195 --> 00:04:00,132
General Bhima would accompany Tang headed to the kingdom, to ask for military assistance.

14
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,068
Together with our precious treasure.

15
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:09,739
General Bima, Magadha our fate is in your hands.

16
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,786
General, we are close to the border of the Tang Dynasty.

17
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:26,985
In front of us, there is a lake where the water froze ...

18
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:29,860
I'm afraid the ice could not support the weight of all of us.

19
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:31,022
Will you wait for me here.

20
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,898
I'll go first to find a way that is safe to cross.

21
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:09,025
Wang Xuance got past the frozen lake,

22
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:14,029
when he looked back, he saw only the white snow in front of him.

23
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:17,009
Bhima and his men had disappeared.

24
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:20,138
It all seemed like a dream.

25
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:27,017
Later, Wang Xuance with the assistance of the Indian team,

26
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:32,993
back to Magadha to catch Arunasva and force his elephants.

27
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:35,086
One man against the whole government.

28
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:38,030
But what about the Magadha Bhima and treasure?

29
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:39,999
Where did they go?

30
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,901
Until the end, he never found the answer.

31
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:49,034
Then he returned to Central India, on his mission to India this ...

32
00:05:49,076 --> 00:05:54,981

00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,977
It definitely belongs to the Milky generals.

179
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,188
When generals Wong Bima and separate in this place,

180
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:51,149
Bima and his friends took refuge in this cave.

181
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:54,025
But there was an avalanche and the Milky trapped there.

182
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:57,529
General Milky certainly managed to escape and then help the person.

183
00:16:58,132 --> 00:17:02,125
If this is true, we should start from here.

184
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:05,003
Xiaoguang, go check the water temperature.

185
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,132
- Yes, professor.  - Okay.

186
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:10,974
Come on, go see a part of the mountain that once inhabited, okay?

187
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:12,002
Okay.

188
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:14,947
Let's go.

189
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,085
See their condition.

190
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:47,946
Is.

191
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:51,008
According koordinatmu, three hours upstream.

192
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:54,977
And you'll find the entrance of the twin dragon rivers and water lines.

193
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:57,115
Her drones can only so far.

194
00:17:57,124 --> 00:18:02,061
- Now you just alone, go ahead and be careful.  - Good luck.

195
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:06,057
Xiaoguang, we approached the entrance of the river Dragon Isle.

196
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:08,064
Be accepted.

197
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,979
Finally.

198
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,037
- This is it.  - Wow.

199
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,981
Xiaoguang, we've found the river.

200
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:25,008
- Good.  - Small fish.

201
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:26,917
Your turn.

202
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:34,127
- We turn on.  - Oh my god.

203
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:36,028
This is very cool.

204
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:37,155
Really?  Throw him into the water.

205
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:39,029
Okay.

206
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:55,912
Professor, this is a photo that is sent from the drones fish under it.

207
00:18:58,018 --> 00:18:59,144
Stop.

208
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,145
Look at that?

209
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:06,092
There is space on the surface.

210
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:07,958
Ya.

211
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:10,085
Can you get a location?

212
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,961
Okay.

213
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:15,162
Uncle Jack,

214
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:18,137
under the blue flag is a space that we find,

215
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:22,006
distance from the river about ... about 1 km.

216
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:24,102
If Bhima was out of there ...

217
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:28,878
he must be in the frozen water about 7 minutes.  It is impossible without diving equipment.

218
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,976
No.  That may be using techniques to hold your breath in yoga.

219
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:36,082
Do not forget, before we were born, we spent 9 months in the belly of our mother.

220
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:41,925
Not that humans could not survive in the water, it's just that we've forgotten our ability to do so.

221
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:45,057
World champion free divers can hold their breath over 8 minutes.

222
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:45,997
- Mm-hmm. - Wow.

223
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,025
- They all learn yoga.  - Yes.

224
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,935
Hi, Jack.  It has been a long time no see.

225
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:51,870
What's up?

226
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:52,166
I need help.

227
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:53,104
What's that?

228
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,903
I was in the Kun Lun mountains.

229
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:55,966
You're in India?

230
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,034
- Correct.  - What for?

231
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:59,012
- Drilling holes.  - Hole oil?

232
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:00,877
Not the oil hole.  Ice holes.

233
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:03,075
Ice holes.  I had the right equipment for it.

234
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,948
I might have found a treasure.

235
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:05,974
What did you find?

236
00:20:05,986 --> 00:20:08,955
Property kingdom of Magadha in ancient India.

237
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:11,082
You would not know it, just come here.

238
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:12,115
All right, see you in 3 days.

239
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,990
Good.

240
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:27,965
- What else?  - Maybe a massage.

241
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:30,906
We will wait until everything is finished.

242
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:34,971
Professor, tea was delicious.  Try.

243
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:36,973
- Thank you.  - You are welcome.

244
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:38,110
thanks.

245
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,045
thanks.

246
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:46,926
Hey, did you hear that?

247
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,121
The leader of the wolf calling his flock.

248
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:50,061
Huh?  Where?

249
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:51,962
Hey, do not move.

250
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,033
He's behind you.

251
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:55,864
Oh, I see them.

252
00:20:55,903 --> 00:20:57,131
There are two tails there.

253
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,036
The rest is behind a pile of snow.

254
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,904
- Hei, Jones. - Hah?

255
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:02,101
- Come with me.  - Where?

256
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:03,872
To find the wolves.

257
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:06,141
We attack first.  Xiaoguang, keep this place, okay?

258
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,114
You gave them to me?

259
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,982
Looks like fun, I go.

260
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:12,918
- Remember.  - Wait.

261
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:14,978
We should have no manners.

262
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:16,012
They want to go where?

263
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:18,150
They find wolves.

264
00:21:18,892 --> 00:21:20,052
At present we are in their territory.

265
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:21,994
In their territory.

266
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:27,100
- We are here to show our strength.  - Shows the strength.

267
00:21:30,037 --> 00:21:32,028
- Hey, kid?  - What?

268
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:34,040
Do you remember what I taught you kung fu?

269
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,065
Of course I remember.

270
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:37,009
Even to the formula.

271
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,978
Say it for me.

272
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:43,879
A strong mind, and energy united into three formidable movement.

273
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:47,910
Punch-kick, elbow-knee, shoulder to hip, is 3 outer movements.

274
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:50,185
In luarjangkuan do not attack, attack with a clear, concise goals.

275
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,889
When in range, attack takes place only, and should always be perfect.

276
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:56,123
Wow.

277
00:21:56,163 --> 00:21:58,131
Formula will not help.

278
00:21:58,132 --> 00:21:59,997
Do you practice it?

279
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,967
Sometimes, yes.

280
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:03,970
Sometimes, it means no.  Why not?

281
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:05,962
I think I've pretty good.

282
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:10,042
You ... you really like your father.

283
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,134
Let's practice.

284
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:13,909
Return to the wolves.

285
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:15,073
Okay.

286
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:18,949
This is another formula.

287
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:20,146
Moving the upper body, and the bottom echoed.

288
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:22,052
Okay.

289
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:27,024
Strong enough.

290
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:37,962
Well, it was pretty good.

291
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:39,165
Ayo, ayo.

292
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:44,009
Lower body moves, and the top of the release.

293
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:53,983
A.

294
00:22:54,054 --> 00:22:58,013
Still have.  Underneath the upper body and move, and move your hips forward.

295
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:00,026
Okay ... it's ...

296
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:06,900
When the hips move, the body confirmed.

297
00:23:16,076 --> 00:23:17,976
Attack line.

298
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:20,174
And move it gently.

299
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:29,980
Hei, kau.

300
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,049
- What the hell is that?  - Or I could use my wits.

301
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:34,060
Oh good.

302
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:37,895
Under attack, and deadly.

303
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:40,991
Sorry, I made a mistake.

304
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:47,131
And if the beat someone from a considerable distance, did to win it.

305
00:23:47,908 --> 00:23:49,967
Hey, come on.  Do not be too hard.

306
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:51,911
Moving quickly.

307
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:57,049
You say one thing and do the opposite.

308
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,917
You beat me and pretend not to.

309
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,980
Son, you pretty well.  Come on, stand up.

310
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:08,018
Chinese kung fu has evolved with Chinese culture.

311
00:24:08,028 --> 00:24:09,928
You still say you do not want to learn it.

312
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:12,056
And I want to tell you.

313
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:19,902
The wolf was after me, let's Fight.

314
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,135
Hey, forget about him.  Let's go.

315
00:24:22,175 --> 00:24:25,906
Hey, hey, you want to go?  Wait for me.

316
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:29,015
Hey, come on, wait for me.

317
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:30,175
Come on.

318
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:33,141
We leave him?

319
00:24:33,153 --> 00:24:36,054
Do not worry, he can find his way home alone.

320
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,930
Xiaoguang, I ask you to keep them.

321
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:48,959
You're going to scare the wolves, right?  So I asked them to make noise, you know, to scare the wolves.

322
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:51,994
- Elementary children.  - They're coming!

323
00:24:52,105 --> 00:24:53,072
Wolf comes.

324
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:54,938
Ayo, ayo, ayo.

325
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:57,000
- Ayo.  - Ayo.

326
00:24:57,177 --> 00:24:59,042
1, 2, 3.

327
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:01,013
1, 2, 3.

328
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:03,073
1, 2, 3.

329
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:15,026
Lemakmu alone is enough to make the wolves were fed for 3 years.

330
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:03,973
He was in China and seems to have found the location ..

331
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:10,973
But we will get them.  It was entirely ours.

332
00:26:10,984 --> 00:26:14,920
And then everything will be destroyed.

333
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:17,048
Forever.

334
00:26:41,982 --> 00:26:44,883
Lift!  Be careful!

335
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:48,081
Wow..

336
00:27:12,012 --> 00:27:14,037
It was incredible.

337
00:27:14,114 --> 00:27:15,945
Masterful.

338
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:18,975
Modern technology was outstanding.

339
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,791
Be careful.

340
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:27,050
- Bye.  - Good luck.

341
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,960
I will be fine.

342
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:54,919
I'll go first.

343
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:11,002
- Whoa .. - Wow.  Very beautiful down here.

344
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:15,030
- Hey did you hear me?  - Yes, I hear you.

345
00:28:15,108 --> 00:28:23,038
We have found the lost treasure of the Tang dynasty in 1647 AD ..

346
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:27,076
Its location at 30 meters below the ice.

347
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,112
- In the ice cave.  - Another great discovery.

348
00:28:30,157 --> 00:28:33,149
- Congratulations.  - You're part of this.

349
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:42,898
Huh?

350
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,003
Do not move!

351
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:54,879
Let's go there.

352
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:04,116
Be careful!

353
00:29:05,158 --> 00:29:11,859
Water ice, flowing through the track, making a huge glacial lake under the ground.

354
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:13,889
And also a river.

355
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,892
Through this river that we can find the site.

356
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:19,929
Anyone ever come across this cave.

357
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,101

- Do we have another clue?  - There.

Since the first of this diamond is ours.

693

therefore already established in the sticks, a symbol of power tallest Maghada.

So it's a diamond in the sticks together.

01:03:48,249 --> 01:03:52,208
Hey I've heard of this.  This is a rock festival of India.

711
01:03:52,253 --> 01:03:54,118
You seem to know a lot.

712
01:03:54,155 --> 01:03:57,215
This is a trick that has been done since ancient India.

713
01:03:57,224 --> 01:04:03,094
We often observe this diperbagai places in India, and in other places.

714
01:04:08,102 --> 01:04:11,265
- How do they do?  - Magic.

715
01:04:16,077 --> 01:04:19,137
- Great.  - You can?

716
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:28,210
[SPEAKING INDIA]

717
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:30,222
He would climb it?

718
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:44,228
Come with me and you will be fine.

719
01:06:14,328 --> 01:06:17,126
Jack, Jackie!

720
01:06:21,335 --> 01:06:23,098
Jackie!

721
01:06:34,348 --> 01:06:36,179
You, over here.

722
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:03,267
Come with me before I got you.

723
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:10,277
You want it back?

724
01:07:36,277 --> 01:07:38,245
- Hey.  - You did not do anything?

725
01:07:38,245 --> 01:07:40,213
- You did not do anything?  - Do not move.

726
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,246
Let's go.

727
01:07:57,164 --> 01:07:58,131
Kick!

728
01:08:03,137 --> 01:08:04,161
Get in!

729
01:08:06,106 --> 01:08:08,097
Ayo!  Ayo pergi.

730
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:18,184
We had to get a suitcase, or we will not be able to go home.

731
01:08:18,218 --> 01:08:21,187
To be honest I do not know where.

732
01:08:28,162 --> 01:08:30,255
Hello Jack, he's been waiting for you.

733
01:08:30,264 --> 01:08:33,233
And you, you have to wait in the car.

734
01:08:33,334 --> 01:08:36,132
Please come with me.

735
01:08:41,342 --> 01:08:45,278
Hey Jack, welcome to my place.

736
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,043
You will be fine.

737
01:08:49,249 --> 01:08:51,274
Actually, you look better without it.

738
01:08:51,285 --> 01:08:54,049
Oh no, she knew.

739
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:56,215
The place is more suitable here.

740
01:08:58,292 --> 01:09:01,284
See, how great.

741
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:05,291
Are not they beautiful?

742
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,193
Jack, people say the Lions are the king of the wild animals.

743
01:09:10,204 --> 01:09:12,172
I do not agree.

744
01:09:15,142 --> 01:09:18,202
Look at this ugly little creature.

745
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:21,138
There is something special about them.

746
01:09:22,249 --> 01:09:24,217
They work together.

747
01:09:24,218 --> 01:09:26,049
- Jack.  - Jack!

748
01:09:26,086 --> 01:09:27,246
Please!

749
01:09:27,287 --> 01:09:32,281
If hungry they will attack, together.

750
01:09:33,093 --> 01:09:36,256
And their teeth can destroy anything.

751
01:09:38,265 --> 01:09:39,289
What do you want?

752
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:44,236
You're willing to sacrifice their lives for treasure Maghta.

753
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:49,174
But their families have hidden treasures of us for 1000 years.

754
01:09:49,176 --> 01:09:52,270
- I want it back Jack.  - Let them go first.

755
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:57,083
I do not care about the diamond.  I care about you.

756
01:09:57,117 --> 01:09:58,345
Help unlock the treasure.

757
01:09:58,352 --> 01:10:00,320
I do not know if I can.

758
01:10:01,088 --> 01:10:03,147
Did not you learn archeology in China?

759
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:10,256
Not that simple.  The key belongs to someone who knows who.  The original is destroyed, everything is empty.

760
01:10:10,297 --> 01:10:13,266
The material is different from the original material.

761
01:10:13,267 --> 01:10:17,067
- its present material and the material .. - Stop it.

762
01:10:17,104 --> 01:10:20,096
Professor, stop this nonsense.

763
01:10:20,274 --> 01:10:24,233
This is what is left of China 2000 years.

764
01:10:28,315 --> 01:10:32,274
Open it, or they die.

765
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Prof, do not come here ...

766
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:48,259
I became alarmed.  I'll look at it.

767
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:50,235
Be careful.

768
01:10:52,172 --> 01:10:55,266
So I think the professor will not save us, right?

769
01:10:56,143 --> 01:10:58,111
- We'll find a way.  - How?

770
01:10:58,111 --> 01:11:00,272
There is no way out of here.

771
01:11:01,148 --> 01:11:04,208
- I will die.  - Hey come on.

772
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:08,312
We're all going to die, all die, but I'm going to die now.

773
01:11:08,355 --> 01:11:10,323
I do not want to die now.

774
01:11:10,324 --> 01:11:13,088
Come on, stop crying.

775
01:11:13,193 --> 01:11:16,356
Hey listen, everything will be fine, come on.

776
01:11:16,363 --> 01:11:20,322
I do not know, I'm afraid.

777
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:23,302
He will help us, you know that.

778
01:11:23,303 --> 01:11:25,271
Ya.

779
01:11:31,345 --> 01:11:35,111
- Already preferably?  - Not yet.

780
01:12:13,114 --> 01:12:16,174
Hei, Jose, Jose!

781
01:12:17,018 --> 01:12:19,043
- Get us out?  - How?

782
01:12:19,053 --> 01:12:22,022
You're here, take the key.

783
01:12:26,227 --> 01:12:29,094
- How to get there?  - Just do it!

784
01:12:29,197 --> 01:12:32,064
Wait a minute.  Okay..

785
01:12:44,245 --> 01:12:46,076
What are you doing?

786
01:12:46,113 --> 01:12:47,171
I will help them.

787
01:12:47,181 --> 01:12:52,983
- There are many hyenas there.  - I see them all the females.

788
01:12:53,988 --> 01:12:56,218
And they are hungry.

789
01:13:35,029 --> 01:13:36,189
Come quick!

790
01:13:41,035 --> 01:13:44,004
But whatever you do, hurry up.

791
01:13:44,972 --> 01:13:46,200
No, no, no!

792
01:13:51,112 --> 01:13:52,170
Come on.

793
01:13:52,179 --> 01:13:54,044
Take.

794
01:13:56,217 --> 01:13:58,082
Good dog.

795
01:14:02,223 --> 01:14:04,987
Stop, stop, stop.

796
01:14:11,132 --> 01:14:13,123
No!

797
01:14:16,037 --> 01:14:18,198
No, no, no!

798
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:30,149
Hold my hand, hold on.

799
01:14:30,184 --> 01:14:32,049
Hold on.

800
01:14:32,987 --> 01:14:35,012
They pulled my pocket.

801
01:14:35,056 --> 01:14:38,025
Help me, help me!

802
01:14:52,015 --> 01:14:54,515
What should we do?

803
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,467
- Jump!  - Okay.

804
01:15:07,221 --> 01:15:09,121
Now what?

805
01:15:09,156 --> 01:15:11,215
You go there and draw their attention.

806
01:15:12,093 --> 01:15:15,927
Listen, I want you there, run as fast as possible, okay?

807
01:15:15,963 --> 01:15:17,123
Okay.

808
01:15:21,202 --> 01:15:23,193
I would draw their attention.

809
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:26,161
Possible!

810
01:15:35,082 --> 01:15:38,017
Run!

811
01:15:47,094 --> 01:15:48,118

Come jump.

815
01:16:29,003 --> 01:16:32,097
- Are you okay?  - I am fine.

816
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:37,034
You're bleeding.

817
01:16:38,012 --> 01:16:42,039
It hurts.  Is it toxic?  Can you suck blood?

818
01:16:42,049 --> 01:16:44,950
I can not do it, you should go to the hospital.

819
01:16:44,985 --> 01:16:48,216
- and ask him, let's go.  - What?

820
01:16:49,256 --> 01:16:52,123
It was her place.

01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:56,061
Anyway road course.

01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:15,049
Yeah, can get into.  Follow me.

01:17:25,092 --> 01:17:28,061
Please do not wear shoes.  Please come out.

826
01:17:28,095 --> 01:17:30,086
You are right.

827
01:17:30,164 --> 01:17:32,189

01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:36,932
- Take care of him.  - Take her, let's go to the gate.

01:18:07,268 --> 01:18:12,001
This constellation of ancient Indian art.

01:18:24,051 --> 01:18:28,078
- Give me the stick.  - Give.

831
01:18:35,229 --> 01:18:38,062
- I like the movie Indiana Jones.  - Are you kidding?

832
01:18:38,098 --> 01:18:39,998
How can we get sunlight?

833
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,027
Technology.  Put that light up there.

834
01:18:44,038 --> 01:18:47,007
Turn on the light.

835
01:19:32,186 --> 01:19:36,122

Pashwaini, Understand, Pachika.  This third result in Aries.

841
01:19:55,976 --> 01:20:00,208
This superstition bored me, just focus.

I promise to restore the driver.

852
01:21:24,965 --> 01:21:27,160

853
01:21:27,201 --> 01:21:29,101
- There's a snake again.  - You said only one.

854
01:21:29,136 --> 01:21:31,070

It's enough having fun?

891
01:27:01,268 --> 01:27:04,032
Objects What is this?

892
01:27:05,138 --> 01:27:07,106
Try searching there.

893
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,164
Bye!

894
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:11,006
What are you doing?

895
01:27:18,985 --> 01:27:21,180
It's about the treatment.

896
01:27:23,056 --> 01:27:25,183
This medication autism.

897
01:27:25,225 --> 01:27:27,955
You do not understand.

898
01:27:27,994 --> 01:27:33,022
He who has the eye of Shiva, has the whole world.

899
01:27:33,033 --> 01:27:35,092
But the purpose is not property and money,

900
01:27:35,135 --> 01:27:39,094
this knowledge to help people live a better life.

901
01:27:39,106 --> 01:27:42,075
The world created by this idea.

902
01:27:42,109 --> 01:27:43,974
You're too blind to be able to see it.

903
01:27:43,977 --> 01:27:47,037
We are not just living in this world, it's all rubbish!

904
01:27:47,047 --> 01:27:51,143
This treasure, it can change us all.

905
01:27:51,151 --> 01:27:56,953
- Now, according to ancient India .. - Do not teach me how to love my country

906
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:59,185
I know better than you.

907
01:28:00,994 --> 01:28:05,226
And do not forget Jack, I fell in love with India.

908
01:28:06,099 --> 01:28:10,195
- The fittest will survive.  - Hey, anybody below.

909
01:28:11,972 --> 01:28:15,203
We have company, to protect this place.

910
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:17,176
Let's go.

911
01:28:20,247 --> 01:28:24,206
Hey, do you know why it was open?

912
01:28:25,986 --> 01:28:29,149
Ocean anxiety are endless.

913
01:28:29,156 --> 01:28:31,124
Turn your head to see the beach.

914
01:28:31,124 --> 01:28:33,117
What does the way you are!

915
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,841
That is all nonsense!  Learn Chinese!

916
01:28:36,029 --> 01:28:38,122
Go!  Run!

917
01:29:33,053 --> 01:29:35,044
Come on.

918
01:29:44,164 --> 01:29:48,965
Never touching a woman's hair!

919
01:29:58,044 --> 01:30:00,012
Come on.

920
01:30:00,046 --> 01:30:02,071
Through this way.

921
01:30:31,077 --> 01:30:33,170
Go .. go!

922
01:30:38,985 --> 01:30:41,044
Jack!

923
01:30:41,988 --> 01:30:43,182
Go!

924
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:45,123
Jack!

925
01:30:46,192 --> 01:30:48,092
Oh, sial.

926
01:31:00,106 --> 01:31:02,199
Want to go where you are!

927
01:31:06,012 --> 01:31:07,036
Release him.

928
01:31:07,047 --> 01:31:08,139
Seriously?

929
01:31:08,181 --> 01:31:11,082
Worry about yourself!

930
01:32:17,017 --> 01:32:19,212
Kick 100 soles of Shiva.

931
01:32:41,241 --> 01:32:46,235
Tigers Kick Kick Bodhidharma from India.

932
01:33:01,127 --> 01:33:05,154
It belongs to Chinese kung fu kick.

933
01:33:05,999 --> 01:33:10,095
If you kicked me again, she would die.

934
01:33:11,971 --> 01:33:13,199
Do not kick him.

935
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:32,181
Tiger!

936
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:46,161
Kick dragon fly.

937
01:33:54,114 --> 01:33:56,173

I told you this treasure is not yours, it belongs to the whole world, belongs to everyone.

939
01:34:19,973 --> 01:34:21,235
Perfect.

940
01:34:21,274 --> 01:34:24,004
Never mind.

941
01:34:25,245 --> 01:34:28,112
- Sayang -. Hei.

942
01:34:28,214 --> 01:34:33,049
