00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,100
<i>We love you, Bessie!</i>

2
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,300
<i>We love you, Bessie!</i>

3
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,090
Hey, Bessie...

4
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,430
<i>I love you! I love you so much!</i>

5
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,960
- Bessie!
- <i>I love you so much!</i>

6
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,500
<i>Bessie...</i>

7
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,470
<i>I love you, Bessie!</i>
<i>That was amazing!</i>

8
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,260
Hello?

9
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,660
<i>Mommy!</i>

10
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,930
Where are you?!

11
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,670
Where's my mama?

12
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,740
<i>Mommy!</i>

13
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,180
<i>I want her back!</i>
<i>I want my mama back!</i>

14
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,750
<i>Where did she go?</i>

15
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,050
Mama ain't here to save you now.

16
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,120
<i>Your mama dead.</i>

17
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,820
- <i>Where's my mama?!</i>
- <i>It's your fault Mama dead.</i>

18
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,560
- <i>Bessie.</i>
- <i>Where are you, Mom? Where are you?</i>

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Woman

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
You ain't part of the act.

21
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,310
- <i>Whoo!</i>
- <i>Excuse me! Excuse me!</i>

22
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,410
<i>Excuse me! I gotta get downstairs!</i>
<i>I gotta be changing!</i>

23
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,020
<i>Come on back here and put
on a good show for me tonight.</i>

24
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,920
<i>I gotta change first.</i>
<i>Get on outta the way, Leroy!</i>

25
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,590
<i>Tape. Let's roll tape...</i>

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,590
Man

27
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,970
Come here, girl.

28
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,170
Oh, yeah.

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,840
Ah, yeah.

30
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,340
- Yeah.
- You like that?

31
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,410
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

32
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,080
Oh, that's nice.

33
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,280
Just let me
put it in.

34
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,790
No, I think it's just fine where it is.

35
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,790
Oh, come on, baby.
Just a little bit.

36
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,160
No, pap--

37
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,460
Man

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,270
Don't mean I don't wanna
mess around a little bit.

39
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,270
I just didn't wanna do all of that.

40
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,600
Come on, now.

41
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,870
It's just getting
good to me.

42
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,110
What the hell
happened to you?

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,810
- Clarence?
- I told you be here 9, 9:30.

44
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,710
- What time is it?
- 11:00, hell!

45
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,850
Come on,
go, go, go!

46
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,650
Wait, wait, wait.
Give me this.

47
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,020
Here, put this
on your head.

48
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,120
Put that on
right now.

49
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,630
There you go.

50
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,390
Come on, let's go.

51
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,930
Come on, now.

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,700
That's good.
Just...

53
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,100
¶ Woke up this morning ¶

54
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,110
¶ When chickens was crowing
for days... ¶

55
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,040
<i>Get her off the stage!</i>

56
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,510
- <i>Good Lord!</i>
- <i>Just let her sing anyway.</i>

57
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,220
- ¶ Looked on the right side of my pillow... ¶
- <i>Get off the stage!</i>

58
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,620
¶ My man had gone away... ¶

59
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,020
<i>I don't wanna hear this, man.</i>
<i>Go back inside.</i>

60
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,590
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>Just let the girl sing!</i>

61
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,830
¶ By his pillow ¶

62
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,870
¶ He left a note ¶

63
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,400
¶ Reading,
"I'm sorry, Jane ¶

64
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,770
¶ You got my goat ¶

65
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,980
¶ No time to marry ¶

66
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,880
¶ No time to settle down"... ¶

67
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,850
- Get what everybody else gets.
- Well, we ain't everybody else.

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,590
No, no, no.
You said $5, sir.

69
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,490
A little something extra
for me and my sister.

70
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,690
A dollar's good enough and a dollar's what you'll take.

71
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,060
$2, sir,
for the both of us?

72
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,530
- For a week's work?
- That's the deal.

73
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,470
<i>Can you see her this time?</i>

74
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,670
Hmm?

75
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,240
You had a good week,
at least.

76
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,410
I know washwomen
who make more.

77
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,080
Don't be that way.

78
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,720
Well, I'm tellin' ya,
Mama ain't satisfied.

79
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,620
I'm gonna quit the 81.

80
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,290
You not.

81
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,330
Not if it means
quitting you.

82
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,140
Woman

83
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,040
I told you about having
all those men in the room.

84
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,140
Ain't no mens here,
Miss Taylor!

85
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,750
Just us ladies, ma'am.

86
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,380
<i>Go on and take her her board.</i>
<i>She'll cool down.</i>

87
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,820
Miss Taylor?

88
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,220
Y'all are gonna have to take
that foolishness somewhere--

89
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,390
- Okay.
- <i>This is not</i>

90
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,760
<i>the only boardinghouse</i>
<i>in Atlanta.</i>

91
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,930
<i>Bessie!</i>

92
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,030
Hey, look here, I'm coming
to work with you today.

93
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,730
I gotta get me
a new act.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,470
- I like it.
- I like you.

95
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,240
I like you, too.

96
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,370
<i>Bessie!</i>

97
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,310
<i>Good, Georgette.</i>

98
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,980
<i>Mary Watson, if I have</i>
<i>to tell you to smile</i>

99
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,750
one more time,
we having words.

100
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,320
Francine, baby,
you're clomping around up there like a horse.

101
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,150
A H-O-R-S-E.

102
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,320
<i>Bessie, get down now.</i>
<i>Stop teasing.</i>

103
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,220
- <i>It's not your rehearsal.</i>
- Hey, Mr. Scandrick.

104
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,590
I've been working on
a little something.

105
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,490
<i>Are you saying you wanna</i>
<i>be in my chorus line?</i>

106
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,930
Yeah, come on, girls.
Let's show him.

107
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,900
And a...

108
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,200
¶ Oh, I've got
what it takes ¶

109
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,200
¶ But it breaks my heart
to give it away ¶

110
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,080
¶ It's in demand ¶

111
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,350
¶ They want it every day ¶

112
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,020
¶ I've been saving it up-- ¶

113
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,720
You just keep
right on saving it.

114
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,390
You don't like it?

115
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,660
It's all right, but it ain't
hitting on all the sixes.

116
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,490
Now, if you done
messing up my rehearsal--

117
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,490
What about the bag test,
James, hmm?

118
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,860
Yeah, give her
the test.

119
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,200
You must be
lighter than.

120
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,570
<i>Whoo!</i>

121
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,580
The top prize for tonight's raffle-- a gold tooth.

122
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,040
That's right.

123
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,310
Hold up them tickets.
Hold 'em up.

124
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,150
<i>I know you got 'em.</i>
<i>I know you got 'em.</i>

125
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,680
But first,
the Queen of Melody,

126
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,990
the Empress of Rhythm.

127
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,860
We're talking about
the real Mother of the Blues,

128
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,300
Ma Rainey.

129
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,800
<i>This the real blues here.</i>

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,330
<i>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</i>

131
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,520
¶ Ooh. ¶

132
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,190
¶ Ooh. ¶

133
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,090
¶ Lord, you see me
weepin' ¶

134
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,830
¶ And you hear me cry ¶

135
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,530
<i>Sing it, girl.</i>

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,540
¶ Lord, you see me
weepin' ¶

137
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,710
<i>¶ And you hear me cry ¶</i>

138
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,080
¶ I ain't weepin'
'bout no money ¶

139
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,360
¶ Just that man of mine ¶

140
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,140
<i>¶ Lord, you see me</i>
<i>weepin' ¶</i>

141
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,580
<i>¶ And you hear me cry... ¶</i>

142
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,910
We got rehearsals
in the morning.

143
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,580
- I could be sleeping or at least partying.
- Well, go on, then.

144
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,420
- I just wanna meet her.
- You can meet her tomorrow.

145
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,060
<i>Mobile, Alabama,</i>
<i>we're on the road for a week,</i>

146
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,990
<i>then Gainesville, Florida.</i>

147
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,530
Oh, slow, slow, slow, baby. Have mercy.

148
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,730
Contract's only four nights,
then we can go on to--

149
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,900
Why we backtracking to Mississippi
instead of going to 'Bama?

150
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,570
Seem like we should
just go on from here,

151
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,470
maybe do a longer run in Mobile,
even add Huntsville.

152
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,470
Well, we'll be making it just in time for cotton season

153
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,280
and catch everybody
with their pay, you know?

154
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,950
Oh, sh--

155
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,550
Hey, get back here.

156
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,620
<i>Besides,
the harvest don't start in Florida</i>

157
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,060
- <i>for another two weeks.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,260
You've been using that goober oil like I told you?

159
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,960
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,760
Nice and soft.

161
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,200
<i>Well, what about Tennessee?</i>

162
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,530
You got Memphis,
you got Chattanoog-- oh!

163
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,970
How'd you get in here?

164
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,940
- Can I join your show?
- You can see yourself out.

165
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,940
Where you from?

166
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,880
- Blue Goose Hollow.
- A who what?

167
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,680
That a street name?

168
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,780
<i>Where I'm from,
they don't have no street names.</i>

169
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,150
That where your people from, too?

170
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,890
They died a long time ago.

171
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,120
Well, the loneliest thing
in the world

172
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,660
is a motherless child.

173
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,660
Well, I got two brothers
and my sister Viola--

174
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,290
Well let me shave you dry.

175
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,260
They don't amount
to much, do they?

176
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,500
You on your own.

177
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,900
- Well, Miss Blue Goose...
- <i>Bessie!</i>

178
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,640
- I thank you for calling.
- Bessie! Bessie, get down from there.

179
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,810
- Do I audition or--
- <i>I heard you in the show. I know you can sing.</i>

180
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,250
So stay or jump, bitch.

181
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,410
- Well, the train is--
- I don't give a damn about the train,

182
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,350
a thunderstorm,
a shotgun or what.

183
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,850
You just got to decide
for yourself.

184
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Hell, you got
the St. Louis blues,

185
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,290
the Chicago blues,
the Gin House blues,

186
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,690
the "my man
done left me" blues.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,700
They all the same song,
ain't they?

188
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,730
With the same three chords.

189
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,000
And you done heard 'em about a dozen
hundred times from a dozen hundred people.

190
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,540
So what make folks
wanna hear from you?

191
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,640
<i>So you got to put</i>
<i>something else in it.</i>

192
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,110
The blues is not about
people knowing you.

193
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,380
It's about
you knowing people.

194
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,070
Who done that
to you, huh?

195
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,370
Big old girl like you
letting folks beat on you.

196
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,470
This look like
it might stay forever.

197
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,310
What you doing fanning yourself around here for?

198
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,580
Shut the door good
on your way out.

199
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,480
Where you going without my sugar, though?

200
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,230
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,160
What you grinning about,
Blue Goose?

202
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,430
What you know about it?

203
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,460
Same thing you know.

204
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,540
What's your name,
pretty lady?

205
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,300
Bessie Smith.

206
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,240
Miss Bessie Smith.

207
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,580
- So, like we said--
- How many seats in the house?

208
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,380
- 200.
- I counted 250.

209
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,020
Ah, I meant 200 plus,
give or take.

210
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,950
And you sure
eager to take.

211
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,160
- She need to be here?
- She needs to understand

212
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,020
why TOBA stands
for "Tough On Black Asses."

213
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,160
Actually, it stands for Theater
Owners Booking Association, T-O-B--

214
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,530
- What's the cover?
- <i>A nickel.</i>

215
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,400
Hmm, newspaper ad
say a dime.

216
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,730
- Well, we don't always--
- $12.50.

217
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,470
- Pardon me?
- That's 10 cents times 250 seats.

218
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,240
Our contract
is 50-50 per head.

219
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,870
$12.50 in advance
every night.

220
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,380
We have no way of knowing

221
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,110
how many people
are actually gonna show up.

222
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,550
We'll refund
your no-shows.

223
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,650
Bessie will be counting
the empty seats.

224
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,620
$12.50.

225
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,260
Boy, aren't you getting
a hell of a deal?

226
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,090
Now let's talk about
the bar.

227
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,800
What you standing
way back here for?

228
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,410
Keep on going.

229
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,450
I ain't said stop.

230
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,680
A little bit more.

231
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,490
- Ma.
- <i>That's about right.</i>

232
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,460
Now how that feel?

233
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,330
Like I'm about to fall.

234
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,600
That's how it should feel every night.

235
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,600
If you're not
risking nothing,

236
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,330
neither will they.

237
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,700
Now where's that heifer
that stole your man?

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,270
- Ain't nobody here.
- Pick somebody.

239
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,440
Right there.
How about her?

240
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,940
Three rows back
on the left.

241
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,850
- Mm-mmm.
- Yeah.

242
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,450
Yeah, that look
like her.

243
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,190
And what you gotta
say to that bitch?

244
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,820
<i>And right there.</i>

245
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,560
Oh, there's that pinched-back
man that stole all your money.

246
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,630
Yeah, that's him.

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,870
Tell them about theyselves.
Go on, baby.

248
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,040
- Bess? We're rehitching.
- Okay.

249
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,870
That mighty caboose
right there.

250
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,050
<i>That was Bertha-- I mean, Miss Bessie Smith.</i>

251
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,050
<i>Aw, come on now, be nice, be nice.</i>

252
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,890
<i>We got your headliner</i>
<i>coming up.</i>

253
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,930
Gin.

254
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,300
I got that, Clive.

255
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,270
Gin'll make you crazy.

256
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,240
Why don't you let me buy you a whiskey instead?

257
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,210
That "stand and shout" shit
might work back home,

258
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,450
but you got to bring some hoop-de-doo
to get these silly folk attention.

259
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,350
Don't nobody care
what you think.

260
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,320
You don't know nothin'
from nothin'.

261
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,820
Oh, I ain't trying to fuss with you, gorgeous.

262
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,390
Just 'cause you got
a little sport in your strut

263
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,820
don't make you
no authority.

264
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,390
I was just giving you
my opinion, that's all.

265
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,100
I'm gonna see you
later tonight.

266
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,900
- Not hardly.
- Yeah, you will.

267
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,300
Hey.

268
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,540
Say, you seen Ma?

269
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,410
You were just talking to her.

270
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,620
¶ I went out last night ¶

271
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,520
¶ With a crowd
of my friends ¶

272
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,230
¶ Must have been women,
'cause I don't like no men ¶

273
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,530
¶ Wear my clothes
just like a fan ¶

274
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,940
¶ Talk to the gals
just like any old man ¶

275
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,610
¶ They say I do it ¶

276
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,980
¶ Ain't nobody caught me ¶

277
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,810
¶ Sure got to
prove it on me... ¶

278
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,250
Oh, wait a minute now,
wait a minute now.

279
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,450
I see some of your eyes rolling,
trying to find my Johnson.

280
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,190
That ain't ladylike.

281
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,690
Trust me, mama,
I got everything you need.

282
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,060
Ha!

283
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,570
¶ 'Cause they say I do it ¶

284
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,640
¶ Ain't nobody caught me ¶

285
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,440
¶ Sure got to
prove it on me ¶

286
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,710
¶ Sure got
to prove it on me. ¶

287
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,150
I almost got her
to go to bed with me.

288
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,950
<i>You ain't almost nothing.</i>

289
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,060
What?

290
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,390
Oh, ain't no "almost"
right here, baby.

291
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,490
Ooh-hoo!

292
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,130
Ma get more tail
than me.

293
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,270
What you looking
'round for?

294
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,770
Who gonna see ya?

295
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,570
<i>And so what if they do?</i>

296
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,310
They got to prove it
on you, baby.

297
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,940
They got to prove it
on you, baby.

298
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,390
Shit, like they doing something bad.

299
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,090
What they doing, baby?

300
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,090
Go on with that.

301
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,830
Let the cards
do the talking.

302
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,830
Let the cards do
the motherfucking talking.

303
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,960
What the fuck
was she talking about?

304
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,430
Take that bullshit on back
where you got it from.

305
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,200
I told you,
you ain't ready for the big leagues.

306
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,580
Oh!

307
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,800
<i>¶ Lord, you see me</i>
<i>weepin' ¶</i>

308
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,010
<i>¶ And you hear me cry ¶</i>

309
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,550
¶ Lord, you see me
weepin' ¶

310
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,650
¶ And you hear me cry ¶

311
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,790
¶ I ain't weepin'
'bout no money ¶

312
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,130
¶ Just that man
of mine ¶

313
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,440
¶ Lord, this mean
old engineer ¶

314
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,950
¶ Cruel as he could be ¶

315
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,820
¶ This mean old engineer ¶

316
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,990
¶ Cruel as he could be ¶

317
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,370
¶ Took my man away ¶

318
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,570
¶ And blowed the smoke
back at me ¶

319
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,640
¶ Back at me ¶

320
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,550
¶ I'm going down South ¶

321
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,990
¶ Won't be back till fall ¶

322
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,660
¶ Back till fall ¶

323
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,290
¶ I'm going down South... ¶

324
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,690
Yeah!

325
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,330
¶ Won't be back
till fall ¶

326
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,710
¶ If I don't find
my easy rider ¶

327
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,680
¶ Ain't comin' back
at all ¶

328
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,250
<i>Bessie!</i>

329
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,520
¶ Yeah, if I don't find
my easy rider... ¶

330
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,030
- Come on, Bessie!
- ¶ Ain't comin' back at all ¶

331
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,600
¶ Back at all. ¶

332
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,810
Yeah, Bessie!

333
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,680
<i>Yeah!</i>

334
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,640
You can't control that.

335
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,550
- Her goddamn ego--
- Whoo-hoo hoo!

336
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,320
I ain't never
seen 'em like that!

337
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,720
We sung that song.

338
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,420
Yeah, I earned
this tonight.

339
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,920
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

340
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,720
<i>Come on, Ma,</i>
<i>you ain't gonna drink no co--</i>

341
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,760
I know you ain't drinking
no corn with me.

342
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,270
Remember what I told you
about the blues?

343
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,370
About you knowing the people
and not the other way around?

344
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,610
Yeah.

345
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,740
I knowed everybody in there
and they knowed me.

346
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,410
You sure love yourself.

347
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,320
<i>I see that gin done finally made you blow your top, huh?</i>

348
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,760
I did good.

349
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,430
It's not a matter
of you doing good.

350
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,260
You're just busted 'cause they was yelling for me

351
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,330
more than they was
yelling for you.

352
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,300
You better turn
your damper down.

353
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,440
- I ain't scared of you.
- I ain't never asked you to be.

354
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,140
All I asked you for
was respect.

355
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,070
Respect for yourself,
respect for these songs.

356
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,380
I ain't see you respect all this
extra money I'm bringing in here.

357
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,310
Oh, let me get you told,
little gal,

358
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,720
'cause I can see you ain't
learnt your lesson yet.

359
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,880
It's my name
on this train,

360
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,250
it's my name
on those flyers,

361
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,460
and it is in my name
that everybody in this company

362
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,990
takes to that stage.

363
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,890
Now, until you can
get yourself together,

364
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,600
you're going back to deucing,
'cause you ain't ready to headline.

365
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,060
- Deucing?
- <i>Deucing.</i>

366
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,870
No.

367
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,400
I ain't playing second
to nobody anymore.

368
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,570
Best we shake hands
and go.

369
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,210
<i>Well, Miss Blue Goose...</i>

370
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,710
take off
my goddamn shoes.

371
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,270
What's wrong?
What happened?

372
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,870
- We're starting our own show.
- Our own show?

373
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,370
- We're just getting started.
- I'm finished with starting.

374
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,170
Wait, Bessie,
I'm gonna go talk to Ma.

375
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,940
Hey, don't leave.
I'm coming!

376
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,280
- The 3:00 with service...
- They're coming, all right?

377
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,090
All right,
don't give me that face now.

378
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,390
Just relax.
They're coming.

379
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,840
- Ha ha!
- Hey, man!

380
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,270
- How you feeling?
- You all right?

381
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,850
Bobby, you know
I'd catch you.

382
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,710
Good to see you.

383
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,280
So good to see you.

384
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,490
<i>It's corn bread time.</i>

385
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,890
The money gonna come in soon.
Thank y'all for heaven.

386
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,860
<i>Sure.
This ain't nothing like it used to be.</i>

387
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,460
You want some more
of these greens?

388
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,060
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I ain't nervous yet.</i>

389
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,830
You have to take
the show on the road.

390
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,130
Hip, too.
Get a piano on the ground floor.

391
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,370
We're gonna take
good care of you.

392
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,730
'Cause what we're doing
here, man, is

393
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,600
we're bringing a little South to the North.

394
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,410
A little taste of home for all these homesick Yankees.

395
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,270
You know what I'm saying?
They ain't ready for it.

396
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,580
They ain't ready for it,
but I'm telling you,

397
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,940
Bessie's doing
big things, man, and...

398
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,780
<i>you on bass,</i>
<i>you on horn.</i>

399
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,750
Next, we have Doreen Dupree
from Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

400
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,320
Is that a real name
or a made-up one?

401
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,490
- Hattiesburg is a real--
- Not Hattiesburg.

402
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,290
I know where in the hell Hattiesburg is.

403
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,500
I'm talking about
"Doreen Dupree."

404
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,900
That sound like some made-up,
store-bought shit to me.

405
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,230
Don't that sound like some old vaudeville mess to you?

406
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,840
Who mama and daddy gonna name
'em something go together like that?

407
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,970
You pick that out of a magazine or something?

408
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,640
It's on
my birth certificate.

409
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,880
They have birth certificates
in Hattiesburg, Mississippi?

410
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,410
And take that damn gum
out your mouth.

411
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,550
Don't nobody wanna see you
up there chewing like a cow.

412
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,490
- Where do I put it?
- Hold it in your damn hand, Hattiesburg.

413
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,330
Five, six, seven, eight.

414
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,690
Wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

415
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,930
What is that?

416
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,670
Um, I'm dancing, ma'am.

417
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,470
- <i>I wanna--</i>
- You better sing something first.

418
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,740
<i>I don't know how to sing.</i>

419
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,310
You don't know
how to sing?

420
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,910
You wanna be in my show,
you have to be able to sing,

421
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,510
dance, and tell
a damn joke or two.

422
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,550
¶ Well, I woke up
this morning-- ¶

423
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,690
That's enough.
Clarence, give her the bag test.

424
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,860
What you grinning for?

425
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,430
You failed.

426
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,600
You must be darker than the bag to be in my show.

427
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,760
Now get going with
your high-heeled ass.

428
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,470
- Next!
- <i>Etta Johnson, Bell Buckle, Tennessee.</i>

429
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,340
Bell Buckle?
Lord!

430
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,640
No yellow bitches.

431
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,570
Next!

432
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,380
- Next!
- What if I didn't pass your bag test?

433
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,550
- I never give you no test.
- Oh, you test me... daily.

434
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,690
No, you--
you tell me.

435
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,960
Come on, Lucy.

436
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,730
No.

437
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,660
I wanna know.

438
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,730
Would you still
love me?

439
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,570
You'd still be you.

440
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,570
And how would you
know that?

441
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,970
You know how I feel.

442
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,940
Then I need you
to say it.

443
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,010
- You know.
- No, I don't know.

444
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,650
You know.

445
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,450
Then say it.

446
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,220
It wouldn't matter.

447
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,550
It wouldn't matter,
what?

448
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,920
It wouldn't matter
about your color.

449
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,660
And?

450
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,630
And?

451
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,330
You know what?

452
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,570
I cares for you.

453
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,580
You cares for me?

454
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,450
You cares for me.
Is that all?

455
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,390
No, that ain't all.

456
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,760
What-- why you
acting up today?

457
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,630
I need you
to tell me something.

458
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,760
I'm gonna show you something instead.

459
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,500
<i>You can make this bigger.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

460
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,370
<i>It's got to say,</i>
<i>"This is Bessie Smith,"</i>

461
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,940
<i>so make this bigger and this a little bit smaller like that.</i>

462
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,810
Now, that's what-- that's what I'm talkin' about,
right there.

463
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,520
Come on. All right.

464
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,390
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

465
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,430
- Hey now!
- <i>That's right.</i>

466
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,830
<i>Bessie Smith</i>
<i>and Her Down Home Trio.</i>

467
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,740
- Ho-ho, now!
- That's right.

468
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,210
¶ I was with you, baby... ¶

469
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,010
¶ When you didn't
have a dime ¶

470
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,320
¶ I was with you,
baby ¶

471
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,720
¶ When you didn't
have a dime ¶

472
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,630
<i>¶ Now, since you got</i>
<i>plenty of money ¶</i>

473
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,170
¶ You have throwed
your good gal down... ¶

474
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,640
<i>This is A.R.</i>
<i>Knight from the "Chicago Defender,"</i>

475
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,040
<i>and I'm here to tell you</i>
<i>that Bessie Smith</i>

476
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,450
<i>is the locomotive</i>
<i>that shot out of Tennessee.</i>

477
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,150
<i>This is W. Alexander</i>
<i>from the "Boston Guardian."</i>

478
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,950
<i>Talk about</i>
<i>"Chattanooga Choo-Choo,"</i>

479
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,890
<i>Bessie Smith is the biggest thing since Ma Rainey.</i>

480
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,960
<i>This is J. Anderson reporting for</i>
<i>the "New York Amsterdam News."</i>

481
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,420
<i>If you haven't got your tickets, folks,</i>
<i>you're not gonna get 'em,</i>

482
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,030
<i>'cause it's already</i>
<i>sold out.</i>

483
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,910
Who is it?

484
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,780
<i>I'm here to audition for Miss Bessie Smith.</i>

485
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,210
I didn't ask you what you want,
I asked you who you are.

486
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,550
<i>Open the door and see me,
big man.</i>

487
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,330
My name is Jack Gee, ma'am,
and I'm 32 years old

488
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,160
from Titustown, Virginia,
and I schooled till the 10th grade.

489
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,130
I'm nobody's husband
and I'm nobody's daddy.

490
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,700
I make $13.75 a week working as a
security guard at the five and dime.

491
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,640
Another $2.80 on the weekend at the Top Hat.

492
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,080
<i>I got my own</i>
<i>two-bedroom apartment</i>

493
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,350
<i>and I drive a brand-new</i>
<i>1921 Davis Touring.</i>

494
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,550
Now, I don't believe in church,
but I do believe in God,

495
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,550
and I know it to be
the God's honest truth

496
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,150
that you're
the most beautiful woman

497
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,990
ever sing the blues,
or any woman, period.

498
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,360
And I'm very pleased to make your
acquaintance this fine afternoon.

499
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,130
- Can you sing?
- Oh, yes.

500
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,930
- Can you dance?
- Oh, yes.

501
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,630
Auditions for the show
are over.

502
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,030
I ain't auditioning
for no show.

503
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,040
I'm auditioning
to be your man.

504
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,010
You look a little small.

505
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,540
- Baby, I'm built for speed.
- Really, now?

506
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,980
Well, maybe you only
auditions women.

507
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,280
I auditions
whosoever I please.

508
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,080
I can give it
as hard as I can take it,

509
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,320
and I don't mind
going to jail.

510
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:51,900
- <i>Mm-mm-mm.</i>
- <i>¶ Whoa, gone away, baby ¶</i>

511
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,310
<i>¶ Won't be back</i>
<i>till fall ¶</i>

514
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,880
Bottle of gin for the lady

519
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,240
- The lady don't smoke.
- The hell she don't.

520
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,980
So that's your man
or what?

521
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,050
No, he's still auditioning.

522
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,790
Can I have
this dance, baby?

523
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,850
Touch her hand, Charlie,
and draw back a nub.

524
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,860
And what if I touch his?

525
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,790
Ah!

526
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,830
<i>Hey! Yeah, come here!</i>

- Get that motherfucker!

529
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,610

531
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,650
Your audition ain't over yet.

532

537
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,970
- 10 is what everybody gets.
- But we had a contract, sir.

538
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,140
Contract?
You must be one of them old country niggers.

did that show at Don's place?

545
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,920
- Ah, you don't remember that.
- Oh, lookit.

546
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,020
Lookit, J.G.
That's our corner.

547
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,990

- A penny a song.

548
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,360
- I love you, Bessie!
- You see that gin joint right there?

549
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,430
That's where I made
my first whole dollar.

550
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,900
- Spent it, too.

That's your man?

574
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,940
You got something
to eat?

575
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,510
- Drink?
- Oh, city gal, huh?

576
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,340
Can't stand to be in regular
folks' houses no more.

577
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,290
You still keeps
the food locked up.

578
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,690
That's right.

579
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,620
Y'all was like
little rats.

580
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,930
How else was I supposed to
keep the food in the house

581
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,300
- and feed six people?
- Come here.

582
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,100
Go get a case of Coca-Cola
and a lot of ice.

583
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,440
As many potato chips
and peanuts as you can get.

Oh, golly. Mm.

Well, you're the one still
keeps the food locked up.

590

Don't look like you're
missing no meals.

591
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,800
Well, I sure didn't
get 'em here, did I?

592
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,570
I got some tickets

the family...

else to be.

Mama's grave yet?

No street signs,
no lights, no nothing.

597
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,210
Told ya, Mama,
this is Blue Goose Hollow.

598
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,420
I know this town better than J.G.'s ding-a-ling.

- I said leave 'em be!

608
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,230
Shut up, fat bitch.

609
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,330
- What'd that fucker say to me?
- I said--

610
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,850
Don't nobody try her.

611
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,920

- 25 cents.
- 25 cent?

645
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,190
Hmm, I wouldn't pay 25 cent
to go nowhere.

646
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,630
Well, I guess I better
sing something, huh?

Bessie, this is what they're
calling Pan-Africanism.

Pan-Americanism?

00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,570
The fuck is negritude?

680
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,470
That means they're real,
real black.

681
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,140
My kind of people.

682
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,380
Talk about passing.

683
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,780
Y'all is fried, dyed,
and laid to the side.

684
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,150
Well, and we are very
excited to be here.

685
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,920
- <i>Very excited.</i>
- We were surprised you could schedule the audition

686
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,590
so quickly given your
busy tour schedule.

687
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:55,160
We canceled the rest of
our tour to be here.

688
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,400
- Well, that's, uh--
- Well, y'all wanna hear me sing, right?

689
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,970
Yes. Yes, yes,
of course.

690
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:03,100
Is there anything else
that you need?

691
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,870
I need a little something
for this tea.

692
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,610
Honey, sugar, milk?

693
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,510
Splash of Old Tom
will be just fine.

694
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,110
- "Old Tom"?
- Gin?

695
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,150
I'm sorry, I-- I--

696
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:19,020
I don't know that we have any
or where we could find any.

697
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,390
You see, it's, ah...

698
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,450
- I mean, it's illegal.
- Never mind. It's okay.

699
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,460
No, it ain't okay.

700
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,500
You want her at her best,
then give her what she needs.

701
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,430
Oh, it's okay, papa.

702
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,500
¶ Oh... ¶

703
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:42,910
Hold up.

704
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,010
Something ain't right.

705
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,980
<i>¶ Oh-- ¶</i>

706
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,910
Ahem--

707
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,420
¶ I got a man I love ¶

708
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,990
<i>¶ Why he had</i>
<i>to leave me? ¶</i>

709
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,000
<i>¶ I got a man I love ¶</i>

710
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,600
¶ Smart as he can be... ¶

711
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,470
Dear Miss Smith,

712
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,240
while we appreciate your
downhome sound,

713
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,210
we do not feel
that it is a fit

714
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,110
for Black Swan Records.

715
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,720
We have chosen
to record instead

716
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,020
<i>a young lady who</i>
<i>we unanimously agree</i>

717
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:31,290
<i>has a more</i>
<i>compatible sound</i>

718
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,120
<i>and is a bright,</i>
<i>shining example</i>

719
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,790
<i>of the Harlem Renaissance</i>
<i>and an uplift to the race.</i>

720
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,900
<i>We hope you can appreciate</i>

721
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,560
<i>the difficulty</i>
<i>of our decision</i>

722
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,430
<i>and the choices</i>
<i>that must be made</i>

723
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,670
<i>in the name of progress.</i>

724
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,470
<i>We remain admirers</i>
<i>of your work</i>

725
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,240
<i>and hope that you will</i>
<i>keep us in mind</i>

726
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,610
<i>for your</i>
<i>future recordings.</i>

727
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,710
<i>You let her go in there and make a damn fool</i>

728
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,910
- <i>out of herself.</i>
- Pour me another glass of this corn.

729
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,610
- Ain't nobody crying.
- It was a good meeting, man.

730
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,550
<i>Hey, baby, look here.</i>
<i>Never again.</i>

731
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,380
Damn fools don't know nothing
about no talent.

732
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,120
I'm gonna get you
a real record deal!

733
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,320
I said I don't wanna
hear no more about it.

734
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:02,550
<i>What the hell you know</i>
<i>about anything?</i>

735
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,990
We've been in
this business

736
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,760
- before you were wiping your own ass.
- Look it here.

737
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,590
It's about damn time she started
taking advice from a nigger

738
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,460
that don't wear no
stage makeup!

739
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,700
Listen--

740
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,330
Give me some more
of this!

741
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,170
Give me some more
of all this stuff!

742
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,200
It'll pass.

743
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,190
...a couple of them
myself, too.

744
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,860
Are you sure?

745
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,370
<i>Hey, Bessie.</i>

746
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,640
This here Mr. Walker--
want to meet you.

747
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,980
The hell you bring
him here for?

748
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,440
<i>You remember him.</i>

749
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,610
Brought him by a couple
of your shows.

750
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,710
He wants to talk
to you about a record deal.

751
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,680
- A real recording contract.
- Miss Smith,

752
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,950
<i>I'd like to record</i>
<i>you for Columbia Records</i>

753
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,690
<i>for our new</i>
<i>Race Records division.</i>

754
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,830
What is a Race Record?
The one where they put a coon on the front?

755
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,700
What? Um, no, ma'am.

756
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,100
We at Columbia are taking
a different approach.

757
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,830
I'm not interested
in your Race Records.

758
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:01,110
And I'm not interested in wasting my
time singing no store-bought blues.

759
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,540
<i>But we want your sound.</i>

760
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,740
We want
the Bessie Smith sound.

761
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,410
And it would be
your face on the ad,

762
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:07,680
- nothing like those other records.
- I already sell out

763
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:10,680
every show from
Philly to Chicago.

764
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,680
Ain't nobody doing it
like I'm doing it.

765
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,520
You'd attract
a broader audience.

766
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,420
I've been doing
just fine without 'em.

767
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,160
I can offer you
50 dollars a side.

768
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,990
No royalties, of course.

769
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,570
Don't play with me now.

770
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,620
J.G.

771
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,390
Now, you want
what's in my jacket

772
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,790
or in my pocket?

773
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,330
I already know what's in your pocket.

774
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,200
Maybe you do,
maybe you don't.

775
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,940
Now, what do you want?

776
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,140
This or this?

777
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,940
I want another velvet box.

778
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,480
Marry me.

779
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,190
You ou can't be
putting me upon no shelf.

780
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,560
I ain't no
henpecked man, either.

781
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,600
Take the chance on me.

782
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,780
Come here, girl.

783
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,060
Now, what's in
that other pocket?

784
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,290
Oh.

785
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,900
Uh, just
a recording contract

786
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,770
from Columbia Records.

787
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,370
<i>125 a side.</i>

788
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,440
That's double
what that man said.

789
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,310
That's 'cause I'm fighting
for you now, baby.

790
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,610
Well, maybe we should
tell Clarence.

791
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:24,080
Uh-uh. This here is
me and you now.

792
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,890
<i>All set. Let 'em know.</i>

793
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,290
Man

794
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,060
Man

795
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,700
<i>Take a listen.</i>
<i>This always takes...</i>

796
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,070
Everything all right,
Bessie?

797
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,300
Yeah, as soon as y'all
move this thing

798
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,000
out the way,
I'm ready to go.

799
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,770
Well, no, that's
the recording apparatus.

800
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,110
- I know it's bigger than what--
- It's crowding me.

801
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,980
Well, we need it to--

802
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:54,410
- I don't need it.
- Look, Bess, you got to--

803
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,120
Hey, hey.
I'll help her.

804
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,620
What's wrong?

805
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,690
It's gonna be just like
the last time.

806
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,790
- No, it's not.
- It ain't gonna go, J.G.

807
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,290
It ain't gonna go, J.G.
I know it.

808
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:09,660
I know how they do it.

809
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,960
They act like they're your pal,
and then it all comes loose.

810
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,500
You can't make no silk purse out of no sow's ear

811
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,470
- just like Viola always said--
- Damn Viola.

812
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,300
You hear me? Damn her.

813
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,070
Damn Black Swan.

814
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,210
Damn these crackers
in here.

815
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,480
Let's just go home.

816
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,880
Okay, we're going.
We're going now. Right now.

817
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,420
But sing one song,
honey.

818
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,920
The way you like it.

819
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,460
Don't sing it for me,
them, nobody.

820
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,460
You sing it
for yourself.

821
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,830
Now what you say?

822
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,010
<i>Okay, here we go, Bessie.</i>

823
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,310
<i>Mr. Gee, if you could just</i>
<i>step away from the cone--</i>

824
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:02,780
He's staying right here.

825
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,750
Um, okay.

826
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:25,640
¶ Gee, but it's hard
to love someone ¶

827
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,370
¶ When that someone
don't love you ¶

828
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:37,820
¶ I'm so disgusted,
heartbroken, too ¶

829
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,290
¶ I've got those
downhearted blues ¶

830
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,730
¶ Once I was crazy
'bout a man ¶

831
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:54,700
¶ Who mistreated me
all the time ¶

832
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,070
¶ The next man I get ¶

833
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,210
¶ Has got to promise me
to be mine ¶

834
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:06,580
¶ All mine ¶

835
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:10,410
<i>¶ Trouble, trouble ¶</i>

836
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,990
<i>¶ I've had it all my days ¶</i>

837
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,360
¶ Trouble, trouble ¶

838
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:27,330
¶ I've had it all my days ¶

839
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,270
<i>¶ It seems that trouble's ¶</i>

840
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,770
I love you. You're mine.

841
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,840
<i>¶ Going to follow me</i>
<i>to my grave ¶</i>

842
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,780
¶ I ain't never loved but ¶

843
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,520
¶ Three mens in my life ¶

844
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,890
¶ I ain't never loved but ¶

845
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,830
¶ Three mens in my life ¶

846
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,170
<i>¶ My father, my brother ¶</i>

847
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,040
¶ The man that
wrecked my life ¶

848
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,990
<i>¶ I got the world in a jug ¶</i>

849
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:25,060
<i>¶ The stopper's in my hand ¶</i>

850
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,600
<i>¶ I got the world in a jug ¶</i>

851
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:37,070
<i>¶ The stopper's</i>
<i>in my hand... ¶</i>

852
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,310
Put that
on top of that box.

853
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,810
Hey.

854
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,020
Seems I done traced the lightning back to her source.

855
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,620
<i>Hey, boss. One more.</i>

856
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,260
What's your name?

857
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,900
Ain't too smart to give out names in my business.

858
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:11,900
Just call me your bootlegger.
And what do I call you?

859
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,370
You don't know who I am?

860
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,210
Oh, I know
who you are.

861
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,710
But what do you want me
to call you?

862
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,320
Oh, yes. Yeah!

863
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,390
What the fuck
is your name?

864
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:30,820
- Richard.
- Tell me your name.

865
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,360
Richard, baby!
My name is Richard.

866
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:40,100
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

867
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,870
Mm-hmm.

868
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,070
Right here.

869
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:48,570
Look good, huh?

870
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:54,550
Yeah!

871
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,650
Well, why is your
name on it?

872
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,780
Why is my name on it?

873
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,550
<i>'Cause somebody somewhere</i>
<i>right now putting</i>

874
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,120
a record on
listening to you.

875
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,120
You're making money
while you sleep.

876
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,930
<i>Ain't had to sing</i>
<i>a word this morning.</i>

877
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,330
It is fine.

878
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,600
- A whole train.
- <i>It was my idea.</i>

879
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,300
Told you six months ago
we should get a train.

880
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,240
Look here,
we're saving money now.

881
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:23,110
Ain't never have to go through
another third-rate backdoor again.

882
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,270
That's what I told you!

883
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,180
Yeah, well, some are talkers
and some are doers.

884
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,150
And, baby, I'm a doer.

885
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,150
And I done done it.

886
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,820
"Jack Gee presents."

887
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,890
Jack Gee presents
the most demonstrating,

888
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,290
syncopating, electrifying
woman in the world.

889
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,000
<i>My girl.</i>

890
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,380
How y'all feeling tonight?

891
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,050
Yeah!

892
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,350
Come on, now. Yeah!

893
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:10,990
Give a little bit.

894
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,490
Oh, this reminds me
of church.

895
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:22,600
What?
I think we might have to preach them blues tonight.

896
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah!

897
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:33,280
<i>Here, nigger,</i>
<i>nigger, nigger, nigger!</i>

898
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,710
Hurry!

899
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:36,710
Man

900
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,380
Give it here,
give it here.

901
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,320
<i>Come on, go around the side.</i>
<i>Go around the side.</i>

902
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:42,850
<i>Come on, let's move it.</i>

903
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,260
- Bring it down!
- We gotta get out of here.

904
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,830
<i>The Klan is here.</i>

905
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,090
<i>The Ku Klux Klan is here!</i>

906
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,430
- It's gonna be all right.
- <i>Come on, niggers!</i>

907
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:56,330
Man

908
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,240
Man

909
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,740
Man

910
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,340
<i>I bet you are!</i>

911
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,640
Don't go out there, Bessie!
They're gonna kill you.

912
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,140
Bessie, no!

913
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,690
Get on out of here!

914
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,020
What the hell
are you doing?

915
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,190
- Get back.
- Hey!

916
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,330
You better pick up
your sheets and run!

917
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,000
Get out of here.
I'm gonna get you!

918
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,570
<i>Get out of here!</i>

919
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,970
<i>We'll be back!</i>

920
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,080
<i>We'll be back!</i>

921
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:01,470
¶ Down in Atlanta, GA ¶

922
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:05,400
¶ Under the viaduct
every day ¶

923
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:11,480
¶ Drinking liquor
and hollerin' hooray ¶

924
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:15,380
¶ Pianos playing
till the break of day ¶

925
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,780
¶ But as I turned my head ¶

926
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:24,520
¶ I loudly said ¶

927
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:26,660
¶ Preach them blues ¶

928
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,260
¶ Sing them blues ¶

929
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,930
¶ They certainly sound
good to me ¶

930
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,540
¶ I've been in love
for the last six months ¶

931
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,870
¶ Ain't done worrying yet ¶

932
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:47,540
¶ Moan them blues,
holler them blues ¶

933
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:51,520
¶ Let me convert your soul ¶

934
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,350
¶ 'Cause just
a little spirit ¶

935
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,920
¶ Of the blues tonight ¶

936
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,690
¶ Let me tell you, girls ¶

937
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,030
¶ That your man ain't
treating you right ¶

938
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,100
¶ Going on down the line
a little further now ¶

939
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,900
¶ There's many
a poor woman down ¶

940
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,310
¶ Read on down
to chapter nine ¶

941
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:19,610
¶ Woman must learn
how to take their time ¶

942
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:23,480
¶ Read on down
to chapter ten ¶

943
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:28,150
¶ Taking other women's men,
you are doing a sin ¶

944
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:33,020
¶ Sing 'em, sing 'em,
sing them blues ¶

945
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:37,430
¶ Let me convert
your soul... ¶

946
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,780
Here we go! Here we go!

947
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,930
Hey, Bessie!
We're praying for you!

948
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,590
Thank you, Bessie!

949
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,290
<i>Thank you!</i>

950
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,930
<i>Never thought it'd be like this.</i>

951
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:49,930
<i>You woke us up.</i>

952
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,960
Hit it again.

953
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,570
<i>New York is celebrated</i>
<i>for its transitory fads.</i>

954
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:28,270
<i>During the current season,</i>
<i>the Negro is in ascendency.</i>

955
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:29,910
Miss Smith, so wonderful
you could join us.

956
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:32,140
You're one of our
last guests to arrive.

957
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,440
Edgar! Mr.
Van Vechten, 4th floor.

958
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:42,390
Soon, doubtless, the homely
Negro songs of lovesickness

959
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,120
<i>known as "the blues"</i>
<i>will be better known</i>

960
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,930
<i>and appreciated by</i>
<i>white audiences.</i>

961
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:52,230
It's a little tight,
don't you think?

962
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,840
<i>Ooh, yeah!</i>

963
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,510
<i>Bessie Smith is here!</i>

964
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,910
Oh, you look fabulous!
I heard that you were wild.

965
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:10,980
Get the fuck off me.

966
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,450
Now, where's the good music,

967
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,150
the good food,
and the good liquor?

968
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:19,560
Langston Hughes is the greatest Negro poet of our time.

969
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,660
Oh. Who's the best
regular poet?

970
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,800
Langston,
how about a little poem?

971
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:27,830
I'm not feeling up to it.

972
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,130
Well, I'll sing
a note or two.

973
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,430
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet, please.

974
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,430
Go, girl.

975
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,500
Miss Smith. Miss Smith,
I should warn you.

976
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,540
This crowd isn't...

977
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:40,580
<i>I have a treat.</i>
<i>I have a special treat.</i>

978
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,110
<i>The incomparable Bessie Smith</i>

979
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,950
is going to
sing us a song.

980
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,660
¶ Everybody's cryin' ¶

981
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,390
<i>¶ The workhouse blues,</i>
<i>all day ¶</i>

982
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,830
¶ Oh, Lord ¶

983
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,900
¶ Oh, Lord ¶

984
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,170
¶ The work is so hard ¶

985
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,580
¶ Thirty days is so long ¶

986
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,480
¶ Oh, Lord ¶

987
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,920
¶ I can't plough ¶

988
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:22,190
¶ I can't cook ¶

989
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:28,090
<i>¶ If I'd run away,</i>
<i>wouldn't that be good? ¶</i>

990
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:33,060
¶ Well, I'm goin'
to the nation ¶

991
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:38,500
¶ Goin' to the territor' ¶

992
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:44,740
<i>¶ The workhouse sits</i>
<i>way out a ¶</i>

993
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:49,510
¶ Long old lonesome road ¶

994
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:54,550
¶ I'm a hard-luck gal ¶

995
01:04:54,850 --> 01:05:00,190
¶ Get the devil
everywhere I go... ¶

996
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,290
Mmm.

997
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,030
Where the drinks at
around here?

998
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,270
Let me get
a little something.

999
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,670
You are a treasure.

1000
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:18,010
That was so beautiful
and so soulful,

1001
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:22,180
and, frankly,
exactly the kind of dusky pathos

1002
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,280
that I'm looking to capture

1003
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:24,280
for my new book
"Nigger Heaven"--

1004
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,550
- Say what?
- "Nigger Heaven," it--

1005
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,250
You know
the only difference

1006
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,660
between white folks
in the North

1007
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,090
and white folks
in the South?

1008
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,660
White folks in the South
don't care how close you get

1009
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,200
as long as you don't
get too big.

1010
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,800
And white folks in the North
don't care how big you get

1011
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:45,670
as long as you don't
get too close.

1012
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,810
- <i>Are you all right?</i>
- <i>If Bessie Smith is crude and primitive,</i>

1013
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:56,750
<i>she reflects the true</i>
<i>folk spirit of her race.</i>

1014
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,770
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

1015
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,500
<i>Morning, Gee!</i>

1016
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,900
I got something for you.

1017
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:28,810
Got somebody I want
you to meet.

1018
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:30,810
This here is Gertrude.

1019
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,580
She's a singer.
Writes songs, too.

1020
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,090
You know Claudine
dropped out in Cincinnati.

1021
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,390
Got pregnant.

1022
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:44,130
So I hired Gertrude
here to replace her.

1023
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:46,530
What the fuck you showing her
to me for?

1024
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:48,970
I don't know.

1025
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,170
Thought maybe you might
have something to say.

1026
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,600
Sort of like "welcome."

1027
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:55,470
What kind of fucked-up name
is Gertrude?

1028
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,240
- You a half-breed?
- Excuse us, please.

1029
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,540
Go on and get yourself
something to eat, baby.

1030
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,550
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1031
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:04,980
I know you got your
side pieces,

1032
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,680
but why you gotta
rub 'em in my face?

1033
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:07,720
I'm just trying
to build a--

1034
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:09,050
You want me to
sniff her for you, too?

1035
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,350
I'm just trying to build
a show here, Bessie.

1036
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:12,990
You got her
wearing my things.

1037
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,490
I know you think
<i>I'm big and ugly.</i>

1038
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:15,930
You think I'm blind
and dumb, too?

1039
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:19,130
It ain't-- it ain't like you
ain't been tipping out, too.

1040
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:21,500
I know it.
Tell me different.

1041
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,940
Look.

1042
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,280
Baby, I promise.
Cross my heart.

1043
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:40,750
I don't love
nobody else but you.

1044
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:42,450
And you don't love
nobody else but me,

1045
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:45,360
<i>so the rest really don't</i>
<i>matter now, do they?</i>

1046
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:49,190
<i>You know I don't think</i>
<i>what you said.</i>

1047
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,300
You're my fine woman.

1048
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:00,500
Look.

1049
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:03,840
Let's start over, huh?

1050
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,810
Let's me and you both
clean house.

1051
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,880
Come on.

1052
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,290
Let's try.

1053
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,610
They said you had
your own train.

1054
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,510
I didn't believe 'em.

1055
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:44,850
But goddamn, sis.

1056
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,280
You a high post
now, huh?

1057
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,690
You ain't tell me
about all this.

1058
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,160
- You get that money I sent you?
- Oh, yeah.

1059
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:58,030
I get them little wires
you've been sending.

1060
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:02,670
They're nice,
feeding four kids and all.

1061
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:18,010
Okay, look.

1062
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:22,690
I know you and I bump heads
most of the time,

1063
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,560
but I'm just here
to show my support.

1064
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,460
Mmm, real nice.

1065
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,100
This is from Europe and...

1066
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,730
what have you.

1067
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,550
I got you something.

1068
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:53,980
Probably not fancy enough
for you now, but...

1069
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:57,550
I thought you'd like it.

1070
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:26,450
I'm proud of you.

1071
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,990
I'm so proud of you.

1072
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:49,610
You gonna stay around
for a while?

1073
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:53,110
Think Clarence could
get me tickets?

1074
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,950
He's in the box office.

1075
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:04,890
Thank you.

1076
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,060
Come on.
Come on and see.

1077
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:47,260
Come on in here.

1078
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:50,030
Come on.

1079
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,730
- Come on, y'all.
- Get inside.

1080
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
The paint already fading.

1081
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,500
<i>Take a look around.</i>

1082
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:57,840
<i>Lord have mercy.</i>

1083
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,980
<i>Look around,</i>
<i>breathe it in.</i>

1084
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,450
<i>This is</i>
<i>something, Bessie.</i>

1085
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:03,450
Smell different, don't it?

1086
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,550
Listen here, Bessie.

1087
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,520
We ain't talk about
getting no house.

1088
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:09,550
I ain't see your name
on my bank book.

1089
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:17,630
I mean,
I did it for us, papa.

1090
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:20,300
- I knew you'd like it.
- <i>How the upstairs look?</i>

1091
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:23,930
But if you did it for us,
why all of them got to move in here for?

1092
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,040
And especially
why is she here?

1093
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,700
Baby, she's gonna be all the way back in the house.

1094
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:29,270
You ain't hardly
gonna see her.

1095
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:33,580
I don't know why certain people's got they lip turned up.

1096
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:35,510
Must be smelling something.

1097
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,950
Damn right,
I'm smelling something.

1098
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:40,250
Must be a dead rat
in the wall.

1099
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,680
Must be.

1100
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,520
Baby, stop.

1101
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:46,460
Why you ain't
ask me first?

1102
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:49,690
- See if I was ready?
- Well, I'm ready.

1103
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,730
I want a real family,
not no road family.

1104
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,730
I want the whole thing,
you know?

1105
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,500
A big house
and everybody in it.

1106
01:12:57,070 --> 01:13:00,470
Well, everybody ain't gonna be in it if you
don't start showing me some respect!

1107
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:08,850
I'm gonna put a big piano
right here,

1108
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,310
<i>a big dining room table</i>
<i>is gonna go here.</i>

1109
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,880
I'm gonna get me a nice rug
for that parlor.

1110
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,080
And I'm gonna get me
a baby, too,

1111
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,250
and I'm gonna put him
right in there.

1112
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,490
- A what?
- Come see the-- a baby.

1113
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,660
Come on, see the kitchen.

1114
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,140
Always a pleasure.

1115
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:46,680
Bess?

1116
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,890
You're gonna have to start delivering.
I'm a married woman now.

1117
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,850
I can't keep doing
these pick-ups.

1118
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,260
No problem, ma'am.

1119
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,130
What do you want?

1120
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:59,860
I'll follow you home just like this.

1121
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:03,800
You trot yourself out there swinging and dangling.
See what happens.

1122
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,040
Yeah, suits me fine.

1123
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:08,940
I don't want you for
no customer anymore, nohow.

1124
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,240
Why not?

1125
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:16,380
Every man in your life
is a business relationship.

1126
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,720
Your brother's your partner,
your man's your manager,

1127
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,090
and your woman
is your dancer.

1128
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:25,250
And you're my
bootlegger.

1129
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,130
Not no more.

1130
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:34,360
Matter of fact,
I'm giving you a full 100 % refund.

1131
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:43,670
- Richard.
- Look...

1132
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,380
I don't wanna be
in business with you.

1133
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,120
I want to be
in love with you.

1134
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,960
I'll take the shine.

1135
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,930
Fine, take it.
I'm giving it to you.

1136
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:12,130
Not selling it.

1137
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:20,480
I oughta get home to J.G.

1138
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:23,780
Bess.

1139
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:26,720
You don't have to pay
for something

1140
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:28,820
that I'm already
offering for free.

1141
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,930
I'm gonna spend it on you anyhow.

1142
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,630
Shit.

1143
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,870
Everybody!

1144
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,980
I want you to meet
Jack, Jr.

1145
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,080
Junior, this is my family.

1146
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,310
Your new family.

1147
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,820
That's your Uncle Clarence.
There's your Aunt Viola.

1148
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:09,190
And this is your
new daddy, Jack.

1149
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:19,170
<i>J.G., come meet your son, Jack, Jr.</i>

1150
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:32,950
How old are you, boy?

1151
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,320
Seven years old, sir.

1152
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,190
Where are you from?

1153
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,860
Shelby County
Children's Home, sir.

1154
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:46,600
- An orphanage?
- Mm, mm, mm!

1155
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,500
Jack, Jr:
<i>I don't know about that, sir,</i>

1156
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:52,440
<i>but that's what</i>
<i>she told me to say.</i>

1157
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:55,170
Well, what's your
real name?

1158
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,040
My name is
Jack Gee, Jr., sir.

1159
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:01,580
Oh!

1160
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,930
Come on over here
and give your daddy a hug.

1161
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,070
<i>Whoo!</i>

1162
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:32,010
<i>Smells good in here.</i>

1163
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:34,010
<i>Eat as much</i>
<i>as you want, Jack Jr.</i>

1164
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:36,780
- <i>Mmm!</i>
- Happy Thanksgiving.

1165
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,910
What you
looking at, Viola?

1166
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,080
Come on, sit down here.

1167
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,050
With that fork there.

1168
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:45,420
- Know how to use a knife?
- Yes, sir.

1169
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:47,420
<i>That piece of chicken right there.</i>

1170
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,700
<i>You want some of this dressing here?</i>

1171
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:07,510
<i>Wait till I'm finished.</i>

1172
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,300
Come here!

1173
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:58,830
<i>Bessie, where you at, baby?</i>

1174
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:00,130
<i>Put 'em up.</i>

1175
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,360
Yeah, guard yourself. Bam!

1176
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,430
I'll knock you out.

1177
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,800
Guard that face.
Bam, bam!

1178
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:05,630
Come one, you ain't gonna
whup nobody like that.

1179
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,670
Now, you gotta get in there,
baby. Come on. Pop!

1180
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:09,000
- Oh.
- There you go. Pop!

1181
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,470
There you go.
Get in there on him.

1182
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,310
You can't get him if you're afraid to take one.

1183
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:14,280
Block him.
Block now. Block!

1184
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,910
What you trying
to do, huh?

1185
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:16,950
What you trying
to do?

1186
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,080
Get him, Mama!
Yeah, get him!

1187
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:22,350
You gonna beat
your old man, huh?

1188
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,380
Louis and I
are getting married.

1189
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,720
You and who?

1190
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,590
I can't no more.

1191
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,630
I want a family.

1192
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:10,930
Like you.

1193
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,540
Showbiz life
can't last forever.

1194
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,910

01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:50,440
Now...

1366
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:53,270
You done heard the rest.

1367
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,640
And I'm gonna
show you the best.

1368
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:58,850
Ma gonna show ya
her black bottom.

1369
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,720
¶ Don't you see the dance ¶

1370
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:04,720
¶ They call your big
black bottom ¶

1371
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:06,890
¶ It'll put you
in a trance ¶

1372
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,220
¶ Ha ¶

1373
01:36:08,530 --> 01:36:11,460
¶ All the boys
in the neighborhood ¶

1374
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:15,660
¶ They say my black bottom
is really good ¶

1375
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:20,300
¶ Come on, let me show you,

1376
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:22,100
¶ I want to learn that dance ¶

1377
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:23,440
Come on, Bess.
Come on. Get up.

1378
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:27,440
¶ Early in the morning,
'bout the break of day ¶

1379
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:31,480
¶ Grandpa told my grandma,
I heard him say ¶

1380
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:35,750
¶ Come on and let me see
your big black bottom ¶

1381
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:39,050
¶ I want to learn
that dance, oh ¶

1382
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:42,160
All right now, Ma!
Come on now, honey.

1383
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,990
You gettin' kind of
rough there, Ma.

1384
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:47,900
Ah, too strong,
too strong!

1385
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:50,030
Oh, baby, too strong.

1386
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:51,770
Oh, I love you, baby.

1387
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,300
<i>I love you, too, Ma.</i>

1388
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:55,370

1389
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:59,570
Rent shake this Saturday.
Bring what you can.

1390
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:07,620
<i>¶ Why I'm a ladies man ¶</i>

1391
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:09,880
<i>¶ About the sweetest</i>

1392
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:16,090
- Here you go.
- Hey, that's right, Gilbert. Don't be stingy now.

1393
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:18,330
Hey, y'all, help yourself
to the kitchen, now.

1394
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,030
Cooked up some good food.

1395
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:25,570
Still got 'em
coming, too. Come on!

1396
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:35,480
Hey, can I use this kitchen for a second, child,
if you don't mind?

1397
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:37,250
Come on right back
and do as you please.

1398
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:20,090
And how are you gonna have a
rent shake without a bootlegger?

1399
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:23,590
You ain't my bootlegger,
remember?

1400
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:27,160
<i>¶ ...pretty papa ¶</i>

1401
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:33,940
<i>¶ Falling on my knees ¶</i>

1402
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:37,340

1403
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:41,810
<i>¶ Kind daddy,</i>
<i>take me please ¶</i>

1404
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:48,550
You wanna know how to really
make some money nowadays?

1405
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:50,990
<i>Now--</i>
<i>Now, I'm serious, now.</i>

1406
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:52,520
<i>This is only</i>
<i>for grown folks, now.</i>

1407
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,720
If you plan on going to church
this morning, stop me now.

1408
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,660
Play the damn record.

1409
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,670
<i>¶ I got a man I love ¶</i>

1410
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:11,770

<i>¶ I give em'</i>
<i>the doggone claps... ¶</i>

1413
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:20,550
Oh. Oh, my Lord.
She's so nasty!

1414
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,180
Mm-hmm.

1415
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,890
<i>¶ But that's the kind</i>
<i>of pussy that-- ¶</i>

1416
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:30,190
Oh, unh-uh,
that is too much.

1417
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:31,630
Unh-uh, she is
just too rough.

1418
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
These party records
going much further nowadays.

1419
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:36,100
Mm-mm,
I can't go that far.

1420
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,600
Well, you could always
dust something off,

1421
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,070
do one of your
old numbers, you know?

1422
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,770
¶ Rough cock, suck my cock ¶

1423
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,110
¶ You can tuck my cock-- ¶

1424
01:39:46,510 --> 01:39:49,380
I ain't gonna suck, tuck,
or nothing else to nobody.

1425
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:52,350
We can get close
to it, though.

1426
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:55,180
<i>See, that's what I'm--</i>
<i>that's the spirit.</i>

1427
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:07,600
¶ His frankfurters are,
oh, so sweet ¶

1428
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:11,330
¶ How I like his
sausage meat ¶

1429
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:17,610
¶ I can't do without
my kitchen man ¶

1430
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:24,050
<i>¶ Oh, how that boy</i>
<i>can open clam ¶</i>

1431
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:27,720
<i>¶ No one else</i>
<i>can touch my ham ¶</i>

1432
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:33,590
¶ I can't do without
my kitchen man ¶

1433
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:44,700
Gin with no ice, right?

1434
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:48,670
You know,
when I saw your name on the sign out front,

1435
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:51,570
I thought it had to be some
sort of mistake or an imposter.

1436
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,470
I-- I can't believe
it's you.

1437
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:56,380
It is such an honor
to meet you, Miss Smith.

1438
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:01,220
Alhambra Ballroom,
7th Avenue, 126th Street,

1439
01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:04,950
Harlem, New York, 1927?

1440
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:07,060
I stand by it.
You changed my life.

1441
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:09,160
That was six years ago,
sugar.

1442
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:11,090
Change doesn't last
that long.

1443
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,790
Oh, but it does.

1444
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:15,500
I'm sorry. I'm John Hammond,
by the way.

1445
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:18,900
Bessie, I wanna produce
your comeback tour.

1446
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:21,000
And this is only the beginning.
You see, I'm putting together

1447
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:24,270
a concert, right,
from spirituals to swing.

1448
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:25,740
Nothing but
the best musicians.

1449
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,740
We've got Benny Goodman,
Fletcher Henderson,

1450
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,650
a young girl named
Billie Holiday.

1451
01:41:31,010 --> 01:41:34,180
- She loves you so much--
- Hey, slow down, now.

1452
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,680
Sorry, I get excited.

1453
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:41,590
Gonna build a new venue specially
for it called the Cafe Society.

1454
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:44,130
The first integrated
nightclub.

1455
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:47,200
No color lines,
no balconies.

1456
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:51,230
Everyone under one roof
just swingin'.

1457
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:53,400
You're dreaming, John.

1458
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:55,840
Will you dream it
with me?

1459
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:57,440
Sing some of
that old stuff?

1460
01:41:57,770 --> 01:42:00,210
I'm going in a different
direction now.

1461
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:02,280
You know, trying on
some new shoes.

1462
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:03,540
Okay, well,
whatever you're thinking,

1463
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:05,550
I just wanna be
a part of it.

1464
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:11,120
We'll see.

1465
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:17,560
Give me a call?
Throw me a line?

1466
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:19,730
Just wanna be
a part of it, Bessie.

1467
01:42:21,230 --> 01:42:24,700
¶ Laugh, frown, laugh ¶

1468
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,570
<i>Okay, this one is good,</i>
<i>with the dancer girl.</i>

1469
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:29,170
<i>Now, see, I like</i>
<i>this one here.</i>

1470
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:33,140
Look at this little smile.

1471
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,510
Calvin,
how are you? Nice to see you.

1472
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:39,810
This is Bessie Smith,
who I was telling you about.

1473
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:45,420
We got everything
you might need.

1474
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,420
Not those old weights
and pulleys.

1475
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:48,790
Get tea.

1476
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:51,990
- Nothing but the best.
- I see you got all the parts.

1477
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:57,330
You got Buck Washington,
Chu Berry,

1478
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,830
and this is
Benny Goodman.

1479
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,740
Such an honor.

1480
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:06,370
Well, well.

1481
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:14,050
I didn't know
where you wanted to start,

1482
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:18,850
so I put together every song
you ever wrote and then some.

1483
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:51,350
<i>¶ It's a long, old road ¶</i>

1484
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:55,660
<i>¶ But I'm gonna find</i>
<i>the end ¶</i>

1485
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:03,500
<i>¶ It's a long, old road ¶</i>

1486
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:07,940
<i>¶ But I'm gonna find</i>
<i>the end ¶</i>

1487
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:14,610
<i>¶ And when I get there ¶</i>

1488
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:19,650
<i>¶ I'm gonna shake hands</i>
<i>with a friend ¶</i>

1489
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:27,620
¶ Weeping and crying ¶

1490
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:32,560
¶ Tears falling
on the ground ¶

1491
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:39,630
¶ Weeping and crying ¶

1492
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:45,070
¶ Tears falling
on the ground ¶

1493
01:44:48,610 --> 01:44:52,280
¶ When I got to the end ¶

1494
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:57,250
¶ I was so worried down ¶

1495
01:45:00,990 --> 01:45:04,930
<i>¶ It's a long, old road ¶</i>

1496
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:09,630
<i>¶ But I'm gonna find</i>
<i>the end... ¶</i>

1497
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:10,020
I do wanna know.

1498
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:13,190
Know what?

1499
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:18,570
What's over that next hill,
round the next corner.

1500
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,870
Well, you can't
go back.

1501
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:30,540
But you can stop.

1502
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:33,910
No, I can't stop.

1503
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:37,690
Well, let's go.

1504
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:39,890
Well, let's go.

1505
01:46:56,710 --> 01:46:58,670
<i>25 cents? Ha!</i>

1506
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,240
<i>No, no.</i>
<i>I wouldn't pay 25 cents</i>

1507
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:03,080
<i>to go in nowhere!</i>

1508
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:04,950
