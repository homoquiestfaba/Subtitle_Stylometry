     is dying off like me.

              -Um.

160
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,029
     -Do you actually make
     a living out of this?

161
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,598
GEORGE: No, I work in a library.

162
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,567
 -So have you filmed yourself?

163
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,602
   GEORGE: What do you mean?

164
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,070
       -Well, libraries.

165
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,838
   GEORGE: Oh, they won't be
   obsolete for a long time.

166

        -You're kidding.

     everything online now.

168

     -Well, actually, only
       41% of households

169
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,246
    that earn under $40,000
    a year have a computer,

170
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:24,182
     so there's still a lot
      of people out there

171
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,985
  that need to use libraries.

172
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,921

   that don't have computers,

173
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,157
  how many ever actually read?

174
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,927
    -When was the last time
     you were in a library?

175
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,896
        These days, most
    people just borrow DVDs

176
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,898
  and use the computers there.

       It doesn't matter.

       No one'll see it.

         you look fine.

     bit about what you do.

190

        which I think is

193
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,039
       the coolest job in
      the world, because I

    print won't even exist.

200
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:38,189
       And in the future,
    projectionists will just

201
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:43,895
  download files, press play,
and it will be a purpley world.

        My car or yours?

313
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:13,237
        [music playing]

314
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:39,557
        [bells tinkling]

315
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,401
    -Wow, they're beautiful.

316
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:59,076
       -I think that's a
        Delias eucharis.

317
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,213
        -I always wanted
       to be able to fly.

318
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:02,613
              -Hm.

319
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,814
      -"Telling the Bees.

320
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,316
   If a member of the family
 dies, the bees in their hives

321
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,885
must be told, or they will die.

322
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,588
 The procedure is that as soon
 as the master has breathed his

323
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,658
     last, a member of the
 household must visit the hives

324
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,161
and whisper three times, 'Little
   brownies, little brownies,

325
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:32,903
     your master is dead.'"

326
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:33,504
              -Hm.

327
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:43,380
   SOPHIE: They look so real.

328
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,549
        I'd love to live
        in one of those.

329
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,785
      GEORGE: I prefer the
     feeling of permanence

330
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,120
     a real home gives you.

331
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:51,555
SOPHIE: But what about freedom?

332
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,108
NARRATOR (ON RECORDING): In his
three-volume book, "Obliscence,

333
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,144
  Theories of Forgetting, and
    the Problem of Matter"--

334
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,346
    -Can you hear anything?

335
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,081
          NARRATOR (ON
     RECORDING): Sonnabend

336
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,884
 departed from previous memory
   research with the premise

337
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:23,420
  that memory is an illusion.

338
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,756
      -Mine doesn't work.

339
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:26,690
      SOPHIE: Share mine.

340
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,828
          NARRATOR (ON
    RECORDING): Experience.

341
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,632
     From this perspective,
       we, amnesiacs all,

342
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:37,635
    condemned to live in an
  eternally fleeting present,

343
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:42,506
have created the most elaborate
    of human constructions--

344
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:46,510
  memory-- to buffer ourselves
   against the intolerable--

345
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,912
    -Do you understand this?

346
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:49,780
NARRATOR (ON RECORDING): Of the
 irreversible passage of time.

347
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,115
            -Mm-hm.

348
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:52,182
    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
    And the irretrievability

349
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,952
  of its movements and events.

350
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,487
      Sonnabend did not--

351
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:57,755
    -Do you think it's true?

352
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,924
    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
 Deny the experience of memory

353
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:00,558
            existed.

354
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,892
             -What?

355
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,294
     -That it's forgetting
         that saves us?

356
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:04,995
    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
         Was predicated

357
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,430
        on the idea that
      what we experience--

358
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,332
     -I don't think that's
       what he's saying.

359
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,266
          -But do you?

360
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,968
          Do you think
      forgetting saves us?

361
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,970
    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
    Artifical constructions

362
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:16,440
    of our own design, built
   around sterile particles--

363
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,575
              -No.

364
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,243
    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
    Of retained experience.

365
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,712
     -I think if we forget
everything, we lose who we are.

366
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,715
  NARRATOR (ON RECORDING): By
   infusions of imagination.

367
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:25,916
          -Don't you?

368
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:26,951
    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
         As the blacks

369
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:27,952
 and whites of old photographs.

370
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,486
  -I think I prefer to forget.

371
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,355
    NARRATOR (ON RECORDING):
        By the addition

372
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:36,594
of color or tints in an attempt
to add life to a frozen moment.

373
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,901
       -I have to admit,
       that was amazing.

374
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:46,203
     Though you do realize,
    most of it was made up?

375
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,838
     --[gasp] Can't believe
         you said that.

376
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,106
        -No, it's true.

377
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,476
      I mean, there is no
      Geoffrey Sonnabend.

378
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,078
         I would know.

379
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,846
 -Why, do you know everything?

380
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:56,847
              -No.

381
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,382
  It's just-- well, let's see.

382
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:03,420
        There's a Sonnu,
     Sonya, Sonnek-- Oscar.

383
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:06,090
    He was a jazz musician.

384
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:07,591
      -What's that got to
       do with anything?

385
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:10,894
  -Well, they're just entries
      in the encyclopedia.

386
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,563
       And if there was a
      Geoffrey Sonnabend,

387
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:13,597
   he would come after them.

388
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,765
        But he doesn't.

389
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:18,936
    I think it's Sonnenfels.

390
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,171
     Josef von Sonnenfels.

391
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,673
         -Wait, you're
      telling me that you

392
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,675
 remember entire encyclopedias?

393
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:25,843
              -No.

394
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:28,445
        Just bits, hey?

395
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,613
     I like to learn them.

396
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,415
             -Why?

397
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,449
        -Well, for fun.

398
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,684
      I've always done it,
       since I was a kid.

399
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:36,153
It's-- It's like a memory game.

400
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,356
       -Did your parents
        make you do it?

401
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:40,958
              -No.

402
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,159
 -Didn't get on with them, huh?

403
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,996
     -Oh, I can't complain.

404
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,399
      My mother died when
       I was young, but--

405
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:51,268
        -Oh, I'm sorry.

406
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,270
 -Would you like that tea now?

407
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,239
            [laughs]

408
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,145
    -So have you always been
   obsessed with old things?

409
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,646
     -It's not old things.

410
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:05,549
  I just don't understand why
    people throw things away

411
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,952
   that still work perfectly
   well, just because they've

412
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:11,188
        been superseded
       by something new.

413
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,490
  I mean, there's this common
 illusion that new things make

414
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:19,663
      our lives easier and
    better, and they don't.

415
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,498
        Not necessarily.

416
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,469
    -So why do you use that
    shitty old video camera?

417
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,838
       -Because it costs
       $50 and it works.

418
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,042
 Now, with new things becoming
 old in a matter of months, not

419
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:36,880
     years, I just want to
    slow things down a bit.

420
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,283
      SOPHIE: Oh, that's a
    bit nostalgic, isn't it?

421
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:43,887
      -Well, you-- I even
      experience nostalgia

422
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,657
  with things in the present.

423
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:51,061
     I mean, because I know
 that-- that these things will

424
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,731
 become forgotten, really soon.

425
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:02,740
       Can it-- can it be
   nostalgia in the present?

426
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,743
    -Maybe it's now-stalgia.

427
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:06,877
         -Now-stalgia?

428
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:07,711
             -Yeah.

429
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,446
          Now-stalgia.

430
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,982
     You know, that feeling
    that everything that is

431
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,818
         is gonna end.

432
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,989
 -Well, it is all going to end.

433
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:23,527
   SOPHIE: I remember I once
     had this leather coat.

434
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,562
   It was the most money that
     I'd spent on anything,

435
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:30,100
   and when I got it home, I
  remember just looking at it

436
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:33,470
  and feeling so sad, because
     I knew it would never

437
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,372
       be better than it
      was in that moment.

438
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,210
    In a few years' time, it
   would be worn and shabby,

439
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:44,515
 and it kind of broke my heart.

440
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:46,650
       -The Sioux Indians
      used to say nothing

441
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:50,754
should be made perfect, because
 then you become attached to it

442
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,222
    and it causes you pain.

443
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:55,793
    So if you have something
       pristine and new,

444
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:59,263
 you should damage it slightly.

445
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:01,398
            -Really?

446
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,502
     -I don't think we ever
 really experience perfection.

447
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:06,737
       It's an illusion.

448
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:08,038
        Like your coat--
        I mean, the fact

449
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,974
       that it was doomed
         to become old,

450
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,609
     that's an imperfection
          right there.

451
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:20,584
     I think the notion of
 perfection is a Platonic trick

452
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:21,718
  to make us feel inadequate.

453
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,189
    -Do you feel inadequate?

454
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,227
             -Yes.

455
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,665
       Doesn't everybody?

456
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,867
    -At least you're honest.

457
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:40,370
      -Well, I don't think
      that does much good.

458
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,706
    I don't think honesty's
    the most valued quality

459
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:43,807
  in our contemporary society.

460
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,745
      -Doesn't pay much to
       be humble, either.

461
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,247
        So what's going
       to become of you?

462
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:58,755
        -Certainly on a
      global scale, we are

463
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:03,694
going to lose plenty of species
  due to environmental changes

464
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,696
  because of human activities.

465
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:10,634
Um, I think that we understand--
     biologists understand

466
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,502
a lot of what needs to be done.

467
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,838
       And the key is the
      sort of willingness

468
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:24,948
and the priorities of everyone,
  to try to take actions now.

469
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,118

      GEORGE (ON ANSWERING

478
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,559
    called "The Encyclopedia
      of Obsolete Things."

479
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,795
     Please leave a message
       and we'll get back

482
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,034
    SOPHIE (ON PHONE): "The
  Obselidia," I'm telling you.

483
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:19,569
     You can't call it "The
  Encyclopedia of Yadda Yadda

484
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:20,637
             Yadda.

485
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,973
    You've got to start with
    a great title, you know?

486
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:25,442
      One that people are
    gonna be curious about?

487
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,248
      -Uh, you don't think
      they'll be curious?

488
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,751
-I didn't think you were there.

489
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:37,154
         -Uh, I wasn't.

490
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:40,724
   I was releasing ladybugs.

491
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,192
      -Releasing ladybugs?

492
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,193
    GEORGE (ON PHONE): Yeah.

493
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,362
    They need the lifeline.

494
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:47,898
             -Nice.

495
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,667
        -So how are you?

496
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:51,668
    SOPHIE (ON PHONE): Good.

497
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,370
            And you?

498
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,305
 GEORGE (ON PHONE): Oh, I'm OK.

499
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,908
        -Did you do any
      more interviews yet?

500
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,912
     -No, just got a letter
      from Lewis Fordham.

501
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:03,814
 SOPHIE (ON PHONE): Brilliant.

502
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,683
   And is he up for meeting?

503
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,453
           -Um, yes.

504
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:10,420
          Yeah, he is.

505
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:15,592
        But he lives in
       Death Valley, so.

506
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:16,560
         -Death Valley?

507
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:17,527
             Cool.

508
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,363
       GEORGE (ON PHONE):
      It's not, actually.

509
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:22,799
 It's very, very hot, and it's
  hundreds of miles away, so.

510
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,902
  SOPHIE (ON PHONE): I thought
you said this guy was a genius.

511
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:28,338
       GEORGE (ON PHONE):
       Well, he-- he is.

512
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,439
          He is, but--

513
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:32,009
     -You won't drive four
      hours for a genius?

514
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,510
   -Well, it-- it's not that.

515
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,511
         It's-- it's--

516
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,846
       SOPHIE (ON PHONE):
       I've driven double

517
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,147
        that just to go
       to a party before.

518
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:40,517
      -You might remember
    that I don't have a car.

519
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,685
              -So?

520
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:44,054
        I'll drive you.

521
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,856
          -Oh, no, no.

522
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,791
       SOPHIE (ON PHONE):
         Sure, why not?

523
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,660
  -No, it's-- it's OK, really.

524
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:53,030
   SOPHIE (ON PHONE): Doesn't
   this mean anything to you?

525
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:55,365
  Come on, I've always wanted
     to go to Death Valley.

526
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,767
 "Zabriskie Point," Antonioni?

527
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,503
   Oh, I'd love to see that.

528
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:00,237
       So when do we go?

529
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,542
           -Hey, man.

530
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,777
        How's it going?

531
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,979
      You going somewhere?

532
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:09,746
         -Death Valley.

533
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,548
         -Death Valley?

534
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,284
              Wow.

535
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,686
           -With her.

536
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:20,057
           -Not bad.

537
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,059
        Not bad at all.

538
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,493
     -She's just a friend.

539
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:24,995
             -Yeah.

540
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:28,131
     Remember, love is just
       a protein, George.

541

           Protozoa.

545
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,453
    -So, you got everything?

546
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,958
  -How long are we going for?

547
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,094
        -Well, I packed
      some water and food,

548
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:03,400
     and I have my gorgeous
        Polaroid camera.

549
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:04,701
             -Wow.

550
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,436
       That's beautiful.

551
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,337
             May I?

552
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,973
             -Yeah.

553
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,408
  -I knew you'd appreciate it.

554
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,410
     You know they stopped
        making the film?

555
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:14,244
             -Sure.

556
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:15,812
So I've got three pictures left.

557
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:16,980
       That's it-- three.

558
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,049
  Got to make them good ones.

559
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:20,984
   -Oh, I'd hold on to them.

560
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,487
    -Well, I've been holding
  on to them for long enough.

561
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:28,592
    And I've packed my tent
    in case we want to camp.

562
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:29,626
           -Uh, camp?

563
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,660
 I-- I'm not sleeping outside.

564
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:31,695
             -What?

565
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,029
 -I've never slept outside, I--

566
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:35,098
        -You're kidding.

567
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,867
  -Why would I kid about that?

568
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,368
         -I don't know.

569
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,707
    'Cause you want to seem
  like some strange city guy.

570
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,041
   -I am a strange city guy.

        [engine starts]

572
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:05,295
    I just thought we'd get
    a couple of motel rooms.

573
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,197
    SOPHIE: [laughs] You're
     funny, you know that?

574
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,765
         GEORGE: You're
      funnier if you think

575
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,000
  we're going to camp outside.

576
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,201
     Animals sleep outside.

577
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,170
       That's why humans
       invented Motel 6.

578
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,372
  SOPHIE (VOICEOVER): [laughs]

00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:19,376
        [music playing]

580
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,352
   Do you know what I really
      love about America?

581
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,053
          GEORGE: No.

582
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,588
    What do you really love?

583
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,590
     SOPHIE: The fact that
    nothing's built to last.

584
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:09,559
    Everything looks like it
    could be gone tomorrow.

585
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,860
GEORGE: And that's a good thing?

586
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:11,895
         SOPHIE: Yeah.

587
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,129
It means everything can change.

588
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,632
     It's not set in stone.

589
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:18,368
GEORGE: No, just set in stucco.

590
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,003
      SOPHIE: Yeah, well,
        where I'm from,

591
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,972
      everything was built
     a long, long time ago

592
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:24,541
and it'll all be there forever.

593
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,943
  GEORGE: But will it really?

594
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,946
 SOPHIE: Makes me feel trapped.

595
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,515
  GEORGE: So you prefer this?

596
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:33,483
         SOPHIE: Yeah.

597
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:34,484
         I prefer this.

598
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:38,788
     GEORGE: French fries.

599
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,558
          SOPHIE: Yum.

600
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,060
    GEORGE: So do you think
       you'll stay in LA?

601
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,529
         -I don't know.

602
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:47,130
            -Do you?

603
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,167
            -Mm-hm.

604
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,303
   I like my home and my job.

605
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:59,276
    -Here, I made you this.

606
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,111
            -Thanks.

607
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,379
      -I mean, I like LA.

608
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,281
       But I really just
     moved here for a guy.

609
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,219
 -Are you, um, still together?

610
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,024
             -Well.

611
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,194
      We lived together in
    New York a couple years

612
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,697
   before we moved out here.

613
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:21,898
     -And what does he do?

614
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,301
             -Paul?

615
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:27,737
He wants to be a movie director.

616
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,406
  Totally obsessed with films.

617
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:33,009
       But you know, all
        the wrong films.

618
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,577
          -Which are?

619
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,112
         -I don't know.

620
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,815
   Well, he thinks like "Star
 Wars" is the best movie ever.

621
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,550
     -"Star Wars" is good.

622
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,419
   -OK, "Star Wars" is good.

623
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:45,455
 But he wouldn't watch foreign
   movies or black-and-white.

624
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:49,459
    I mean, it's like cinema
 started with "The Godfather."

625
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:53,663
 -Probably a lot of people feel
like that nowadays, don't they?

626
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,631
       -Yeah, absolutely.

627
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,102
    But I just don't know if
     I can be with somebody

628
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:03,006
      who won't watch "Au
       Hasard Balthazar."

629
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:03,940
         -That donkey.

630
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,642
          -Oh, I know!

631
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,444
            Exactly.

632
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:09,479
    Meanwhile, Paul says, I
   won't do black-and-white,

633
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,581
     I won't do subtitles,
       and I sure as hell

634
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:16,052
   won't do a black-and-white
subtitled movie about a donkey.

635
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,721
       Actually, maybe he
       does have a point.

636
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:20,790
            [laughs]

637
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,491
         I don't know.

638
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:27,397
We should get back on the road.

639
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,369
            [snorts]

640
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:36,139
            [laughs]

641
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:39,309
        You've got a bit
       of green going on.

642
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:39,709
              -Oh.

643
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,748
       Your turn to drive
         as well, yeah?

644
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,384
      -Uh, I don't drive.

645
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,985
             -What?

646
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,621
   -Yeah, I don't have a car.

647
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:54,357
   -You're kidding me, right?

648
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,893
     You got to, like, how
     old, and living in LA,

649
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:57,761
      and you don't drive?

650
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:03,533
         Time to learn.

651
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:35,432
    So tell me about Lewis.

652
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:38,301
   -(NERVOUSLY) Um, uh, he--
 he-- back in the day he worked

653
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:41,671
   for NASA, and he was-- he
    predicted climate change

654
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:44,140
       before-- anybody.

655
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,009
      And-- and if they'd
        listened to him,

656
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:47,644
       maybe it wouldn't
      be such a mess now.

657
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:51,347
       Oh, what do I do?

658
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,850
      There's a big, fast
        red car coming.

659
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:54,584
          -What is it?

660
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:55,518
          What is it?

661
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,086
    Oh, stay steady, George.

662
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,488
          Stay steady.

663
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:58,922
              -OK.

664
00:40:58,924 --> 00:40:59,856
             -Whew!

665
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,591
          We made it.

666
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,660
     -Look, I didn't think
     I could talk and drive

667
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:04,994
       at the same time.

668
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,163
     And can you please not
    point that camera at me?

669
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,765
        -All right, all
       right, I'm sorry.

670
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:09,833
      -Oh, what do we do?

671
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:10,600
I mean, I think there's a turn.

672
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:11,201
         -OK, take it.

673
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:11,734
              -OK.

674
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:12,335
          -Turn, turn.

675
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:13,570
              -OK.

676
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:14,571
    [polaroid takes picture]

677
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,539
           -Oh, shit!

678
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,740
         GEORGE: What?

679
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:20,343
  SOPHIE: [sigh] Three bloody
    pictures left and I just

680
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:21,177
           blew one.

681
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,083
       GEORGE: I'm sorry.

682
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,451
 SOPHIE: No, it's-- it's fine.

683
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:38,161
    Imagine living out here.

684
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,730
    Wouldn't you get lonely?

685
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:43,366
    -Some people get lonely
   in the middle of the city.

686
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,584
       LEWIS: So George,
       which publication

687
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,352
   did you say you were from?

688
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,454
       -"The Encyclopedia
      of Obsolete Things."

689
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:41,424
    -Oh. [chuckles] I guess
  that covers most everything

690
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:42,659
        these days, heh.

691
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:47,864
            Sophie.

692
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:48,598
       SOPHIE: Thank you.

693
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,599
             -Yeah.

694
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:51,768
      -So beautiful here.

695
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,836
        LEWIS: You think
       this is beautiful?

696
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:54,437
             -Yeah.

697
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:59,742
    -Well, you're in dubious
 luck, because in a little more

698
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:03,346
  than 50 years' time, most of
 the world will look like this.

699
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,915
       -You don't really
     believe that, do you?

700
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,885
   -Not a question of belief.

701
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:13,456
 Here's how it is-- God, if he
 exists, his own honest truth.

702
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:17,660
    By 2020, extreme weather
   patterns will be the norm.

703
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:19,963
     Earth's cooling system
   will fail with the melting

704
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:21,531
       of the polar caps.

705
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:26,703
      And by '20, 50, 75%
       of all land mass--

706
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:30,974
    that which has not been
 claimed by rising sea levels--

707
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:36,012
   will be desert, just like
     what we see around us.

708
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:45,855
   And by 2100, 80% of human
    population-- decimated.

709
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:48,324
      -That's ridiculous.

710
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:49,025
             -Yes.

711
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:49,792
       It is ridiculous.

712
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,431
   But that's the way it is.

713
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:03,272
    -But-- you-- what if we
 seriously cut carbon emissions

714
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:06,509
 in the next five years, say in
 line with the Kyoto Protocol?

715
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:09,579
 -If you'd asked that, George,
 40 years ago, maybe a chance.

716
00:44:09,581 --> 00:44:10,980
          But not now.

717
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,281
         -And surely if
       more people switch

718
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,517
  to sustainable green living.

721
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:21,257
 We have hit the damn iceberg.

722
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,359

           -There is.

725
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:36,239
 Enjoy it while we can, because
    it isn't going to last.

726
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:39,208
      Do our best to treat
        it with kindness

727
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,777
   and enjoy it while we can.

728
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:45,515
    So let's drink to that.

734
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:07,804
 hm, maybe we'd save the bees.

735
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:09,839
 You heard about their plight?

736
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:11,074
       -Yeah, of course.

737
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:14,877
      I read that as many
       as 90% of the bees

738
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,747
    worldwide have died off
     in the last 17 years.

739
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:19,148
      LEWIS: That's right.

740
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:22,852
       And you know what
     Albert Einstein said?

741
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:25,021
       -If the honeybees
    disappeared completely,

742
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:29,592
      humans could survive
     only four more years.

743
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:33,830
   -Yeah, we depend on these
  creatures for our survival.

744
00:45:33,832 --> 00:45:38,768
  Our being depends upon them
  as theirs does on us, yeah.

745
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,103
              So.

746
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:41,838
       So you're writing
        an "Encyclopedia

747
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,773
      of Obsolete Things."

748
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:46,676
        I-- I can't help
      but think that, um,

749
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:51,981
    that all human knowledge
   will be filed there soon.

750
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:56,586
     Um, agriculture as we
      know it-- finished.

751
00:45:56,588 --> 00:46:00,556

truths, completely meaningless.

  -I think I know about that.

754
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:14,670
     -Then, um, why do it?

755
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:16,005
       The past is gone.

756
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:19,542
     All it's left us with
     just a hell of a mess.

757
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:26,816
   -I think that that mess is
  partly due to our eagerness

758
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,551
       to move so quickly
        into the future

759
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:31,821
     without really taking
   stock of where we've been.

760
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:34,423
             -Yeah?

761
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:38,928
  I think that you're attached
   to it, the good old days.

762
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,429
             I was.

763
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:43,599
     But it makes me wonder
  why-- why you came out here

764
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,101
         to talk to me.

765
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:50,439
   -Well, I wanted to see if
  you were a reliable source.

766
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:54,610
             -Yeah?

767
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:57,446
     Well, you think I'm--
      you think I'm crazy?

768
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:00,449
              -No.

769
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:09,692
   But I-- I think there's a
   chance that you're wrong.

770
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:13,262
        I mean, a lot of
      experts in the field

771
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:17,266
 still believe there's a window
   of opportunity to change.

772
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:22,171
   -Let's say that I'm wrong,
      I'm a crazy old man.

773
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:26,976
  I'm wrong, and that there's
   a bigger window of chance

774
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:29,679
       to save the human
       race than I think.

00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:34,217
 Five years, ten years, before
  the damage is irreversible.

776
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,719
     That's what they say,
     most of my colleagues.

777
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:38,554
        Well, optimistic
       colleagues, right?

778
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:39,388
            -Mm-hm.

779
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,089
          -Well, fine.

780
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,891
     So it is as they say.

781
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:45,862
    Now here's the question
     that you have to ask.

782
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:48,831
      Do you think people
      are about to change?

783
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:55,872
 Do you think that even now, in
  the face of mass extinction,

784
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:59,242
       people will change
       the way they live?

785
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:11,821
              No.

786
00:48:11,823 --> 00:48:13,389
              No.

787
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:22,632
           [buzzing]

788
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,737
         SOPHIE: Smile.

789
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,805
        Three, two, one.

790
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:32,008
    [polaroid takes picture]

791
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:32,942
        SOPHIE: Perfect.

792
00:48:32,944 --> 00:48:34,977
         Thanks, guys.

793
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:38,114
      -So, um, are you all
  staying around for tonight?

794
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:39,448
       -Yes, actually, I
        was going to ask

795
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,751
    if there's a motel that
      you could recommend.

796
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:42,985
      -Or a place to camp.

797
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:44,553
       -Well, yes, if you
      have a tent, you're

798
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:45,955
   welcome to pitch it here.

799
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:47,323
  I have no problem with that.

800
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:47,890
           -It's OK.

801
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:49,091
         -That's great.

802
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,092
       -Yeah, best place,
       right over there.

803
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,594
  Less chance or rattlesnakes.

804
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:52,995
           -Perfect.

805
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:54,530
    And I was wondering if I
   could use your telephone.

806
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,432
      I can't seem to get
       a signal out here.

807
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,267
      -Oh, I need to make
       a phone call, too.

808
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,802
   -I don't have a telephone.

809
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:03,873
  I am gratefully cut off from
   what they-- what they dare

810
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,541
       call civilization.

811
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:09,879
    Nearest phone is at the
      Amargosa Opera House

812
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:11,948
        at Death Valley
      Junction, 10 miles.

813
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,282
      -Cool, that's great.

814
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,751
    Well, we can set up camp
     and take a drive over.

815
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:19,956
  -Well, if you do, you might
 want to time it for the show.

816
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,892
  Marta Beckett has performed
      every Saturday night

817
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:24,126
     for the past 40 years.

818
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,995
    It's well worth a visit.

819
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,596
        -That's perfect.

820
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:28,898
            -Mm-hm.

821
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,565
             -Yeah.

822
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:41,377
     -I don't know if this
      is such a good idea.

823
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:45,348
    I mean, maybe we should
  just get a room in a motel.

824
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,683
     -So all you have to do
    is put the little poles

825
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:48,551
      in the little holes.

826
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,123
      Do you want to give
       me some help here?

827
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:04,467
        That's it, see?

828
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:06,268
             Easy.

829
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,472
       That's right, like
     in those holes there.

830
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,744
        -I think I might
       sleep in the car.

831
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,345
    -[sigh] You'll be fine.

832
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:20,816
          Look at it.

833
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:21,684
         It's gorgeous.

834
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:26,789
    Oh, it's great in here.

835
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,118
      SOPHIE: (WHISPERING)
    Why are you videoing it?

836
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,720
     You should just watch.

837
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:36,625
           [applause]

838
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:37,993
  That was amazing, wasn't it?

839
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:40,930
    It was worth coming out
    here just for that show.

840
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,832
         GEORGE: It was
      worth meeting Lewis.

841
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:43,732
          SOPHIE: Oh.

842
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,634
    GEORGE: He was amazing.

843
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,303
     -Doesn't he annoy you?

844
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:51,273
              -No.

845
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,008
  -What, not even just a bit?

846
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,477
        I mean, all that
     "you're all gonna die

847
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:58,414
    and there's nothing you
     can do about it" shit.

848
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,950
     -I don't think that's
       what he's saying.

849
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,985
  -Yes it is, and he's wrong.

850
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:05,554
 Just 'cause he's getting old.

851
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:07,823
    -Well, just because you
   don't agree with something

852
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:09,725
     does mean it's wrong.

853
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:10,926
          -Yes it is.

854
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:15,564
       You can never say
        there's no hope.

855
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:17,800
        So are you good?

856
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,602
             -Yeah.

857
00:52:19,604 --> 00:52:20,369
       -Lights out then?

858
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,210
             [sigh]

859
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:39,121
      -Good night, Sophie.

860
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:40,356
   -(WHISPERING) Good night.

861
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,271
     Are you sleeping yet?

862
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,409
              -No.

863
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:01,243
          -Me neither.

864
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:07,082
  So is this really the first
  time you've slept in a tent?

865
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:12,688
              -No.

866
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,556
        -Tell the story.

867
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:19,828
    -Well, I was in a friend
       of mine's backyard

868
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,965
       when we were kids.

869
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:24,967
     We got scared halfway
       through the night,

870
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,970
     and his mom let us in.

871
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:30,272
-No Mommy to let you in tonight.

872
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:35,077
              -No.

873
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:37,112
   -But I'll look after you.

874
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:43,752
      -Good night, Sophie.

875
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:44,720
          -Good night.

876
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,930
             [howl]

877
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:55,898
        -What was that?

878
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,899
            -Coyote.

879
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,100
    I think it was a coyote.

880
00:53:58,102 --> 00:53:59,468
 -(FRANTICALLY) What do we do?

881
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,837
         What do we do?

882
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:02,938
   SOPHIE: Enjoy it, George.

883
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,874
      We-- just enjoy it.

884
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:09,478
GEORGE: Enjoy the sound of wild
 creatures coming to devour us?

885
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,880
        SOPHIE: [laughs]

886
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:14,483
    GEORGE: What's so funny?

887
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:16,485
          SOPHIE: You!

888
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:17,486
          Just relax.

889
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:18,454
          We're safe.

890
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:27,463
            [laughs]

891
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,686
  -Are you sure we'll be safe?

892
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,426
  -Well, given that you think
that 80% of the human population

893
00:54:57,428 --> 00:55:00,062
    will be gone in the next
     100 years, no, George,

894
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,730
   I don't think we're safe.

895
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:06,769
         -Point taken.

896
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:09,171
        -We'll be fine.

897
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:11,740
   At least till the morning.

898
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,423
         -Good morning.

899
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:04,360
       -Ah, good morning.

900
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:06,562
       Hope you like your
    eggs scrambled, George.

901
00:56:06,564 --> 00:56:07,429
         -Who doesn't?

902
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:22,010
       -And desert honey,
     courtesy of the bees.

903
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:23,078
          -Thank you.

904
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,148
 Looks like you were up early.

905
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:32,254
   -Well, you know, I haven't
 missed a sunrise in 15 years.

906
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:37,292
   If you hike to that point,
   well, even an old atheist

907
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:39,561
       like me sometimes
   whispers the name of God.

908
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:44,500
     -As beautiful as that?

909
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:46,001
        -And then some.

910
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:47,970
       -Well, I wish you
      would have asked me.

911
00:56:47,972 --> 00:56:49,638
       I would have loved
      to have joined you.

912
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:53,041
   Thank you for this, Lewis.

913
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:54,610
     -Oh, it's my pleasure.

914
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:57,613
    It's a rare treat for me
   to get visitors out here.

915
00:56:57,615 --> 00:57:02,451
  People, I guess, don't much
    like what I have to say.

916
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:04,286
      -Do you have family?

917
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:07,556
-Wife is deceased, 20-odd years.

918
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:08,991
  My only son lives in Japan.

919
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:10,259
     He's a Buddhist monk.

920
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:12,628
       Of all the idiotic
    things that he could've

921
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,731
 chosen to do with his life, he
  opted for robes and silence.

922
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:20,269
         Your paramour.

923
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:21,804
      -(QUIETLY) Sophie's
         just a friend.

924
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:22,571
              -Oh.

925
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:23,272
         -Good morning.

926
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:23,772
           -Morning.

927
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:24,706
           -Morning.

928
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,541
    -My, this looks amazing.

929
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:26,942
       Thank you, Lewis.

930
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:27,643
         -My pleasure.

931
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:28,877
          -Thank you.

932
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,979
       -So did you enjoy
      the show last night?

933
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:33,382
   -Oh, it was magic, really.

934
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:38,086
 -I have to say, Marta Beckett
  revives my hope in mankind.

935
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:39,288
     -I can understand why.

936
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,493
        -So what are you
        all doing today?

937
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:48,230
       -Mm, I think we're
      going to head back.

938
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:49,565
  -What about Zabriskie Point?

939
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:56,004
    -I remember when my wife
     and I first came here.

940
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:59,475
         She said this
     reminded her of hell.

941
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:07,216
  And to me it was, and is, a
  paradise, literally millions

942
00:58:07,218 --> 00:58:11,353
      of years of change,
        evolution, that

943
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:14,623
     solidified in the rock
     right before our eyes.

944
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:20,295
    To me, I find something
  very reassuring about that.

945
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:26,702
      Human race might not
      survive much longer,

946
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:28,103
      but the world will.

947
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:32,341
      That's what matters.

948
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,357
         Drive safely.

949
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:51,860
     And come back and see
    me before it's all gone.

950
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,395
        -Thanks, Lewis.

951
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:55,797
  I'll send you a copy of the
  encyclopedia when it's done.

952
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,366
             -Yes.

953
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:58,767
          -Bye, Lewis.

954
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:01,570
            -Sophie.

955
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:02,538
        -You can drive.

956
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:13,582
          Bye, Lewis.

957
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:15,717
          LEWIS: Bye.

958
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,220
        [engine starts]

959
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:23,659
   SOPHIE: "Come back and see
   me before it's all gone."

960
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:28,597
[chuckles] He'll be gone before
 the world is, that's for sure.

961
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,908
         Look at this.

962
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,209
            So cool.

963
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:42,811
       GEORGE: Maybe it's
     worse than I thought.

964
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:48,784
I mean, what if the whole world
 really is about to disappear?

965
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:50,452
    What if Lewis is right?

966
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:54,222
    -Oh, for goodness' sake,
    stop being so miserable.

967
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:55,457
-Why does it upset you so much?

968
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:59,995
       -Doesn't upset me,
      George, it bores me.

969
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:01,863
     -Well, you don't seem
     bored, you seem angry.

970
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:03,198
        -I'm not angry.

971
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,766
    I just think it's a lot
    of bullshit, all right?

972
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:05,934
    I think Lewis is wrong.

973
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,636
   -What, to tell the truth?

974
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:11,039
-[sigh] You know, this obsession
    you have with all things

975
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,941
      obsolete is absurd.

976
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,643
     You know what I think?

977
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:16,778
     I think if one person
    loves something enough,

978
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,215
   it can never be obsolete.

979
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:23,752
    -Well, that's not true.

980
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:25,821
      I love typewriters,
        and that doesn't

981
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:27,656
        mean to say that
     they're not obsolete.

982
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:31,259
     -It's because you love
     them that it's alive.

983
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:33,328
  I mean, don't you get that?

     SOPHIE: You're driving
      great now, you know?

991
01:02:05,489 --> 01:02:08,123
        Just like Steve
     McQueen in "Bullitt."

       Noe one would ever
    guess you just learned.

993
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:13,261
 Wait, wait, did you see that?

994
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:13,795
           -Uh, what?

995
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:14,896
          -Look, look!

996
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,298
     Pull over, pull over!

997
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,234
        I swear to god,
       it's a ghost town.

998
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,303
     Come on, we've got to
     go and check that out.

999
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:21,703
            Come on!

1000
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:42,624
        -Please say no.

1001
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:45,460
 Please say no, please say no.

1002
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,298
  -Come on, come check it out.

1003
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:04,780
        Look, come here.

1004
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:05,547
         There is one.

1005
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:06,314
        It's over there.

1006
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:06,548
         Check it out.

1007
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:13,255
     There's a ghost town.

1008
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:15,824
   Come on, we've got to go.

1009
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:17,592
          GEORGE: Mmm.

1010
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:21,163
   Don't you think we should
  just get to Zabriskie Point?

1011
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:24,266
       -What, you scared
       of ghosts, George?

1012
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:25,200
              -No.

1013
01:03:25,202 --> 01:03:27,302
       It's just-- well,
        that car is not

1014
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,970
     designed for off-road
        travel, and it's

1015
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,639
at least five miles to the town.

1016
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:31,640
           -Come on!

1017
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,241
       It's gonna be fun!

1018
01:03:57,067 --> 01:04:00,202
     I can't believe you're
       scared of ghosts.

1019
01:04:00,204 --> 01:04:02,370
             Ooooo!

1020
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:04,840
        GEORGE: Oh, it's
     not-- it's not ghosts.

1021
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,642
    It's-- look at the road.

1022
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:09,110
       This is insanity.

1023
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:12,147
     SOPHIE: Oh, let's live
 dangerously, George, come on!

1024
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:14,182
   What have we got to lose?

1025
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,017
    GEORGE: Just our lives.

1026
01:04:18,822 --> 01:04:20,822
   Have you seen enough yet?

1027
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:21,823
     SOPHIE: Look at that.

1028
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:23,024
       Oh, this is great.

1029
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:32,801
        I have to get a
     picture of that truck.

1030
01:04:32,803 --> 01:04:34,669
             Look.

1031
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:35,871
         GEORGE: Great.

1032
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:38,206
      SOPHIE: Uh-oh, here
        comes the ghost.

1033
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,909
Guess I should go and say hello
if I want to take that picture.

1034
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:42,711
      -Do you think it's a
     good idea to get out?

1035
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:44,179
I mean, no one knows we're here.

1036
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:46,648
    We could just disappear.

1037
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:50,685
 -If it gets weird, I'll cough
   and we'll run to the car.

1038
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,587
             Deal?

1039
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:55,657
     -But what if I notice
      it's getting weird?

1040
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:56,258
          -You cough.

1041
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:01,596
            [coughs]

1042
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:03,198
    GEORGE: [clears throat]

1043
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:15,443
         SOPHIE: Hiya.

1044
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:16,511
      -Hi, how's it going?

1045
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:18,546
     -We were just driving
       by, saw your sign.

1046
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:19,481
            -Mm-hm.

1047
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:20,615
          -I'm Sophie.

1048
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:24,319
     -Ah, and you look like
    one of the Manson girls.

1049
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:25,987
        -Uh, I'm George.

1050
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:28,857
        -I'm Rock Novak,
     caretaker of Ballarat.

1051
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:29,925
    Come on in, look around.

1052
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,092
          Come on in.

1053
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:37,565
     GEORGE: This is quite
     a place you have here.

1054
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:38,533
          ROCK: Yeah.

1055
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:40,802
       Yeah, I been doing
      it about five years,

1056
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:42,437
        trying to build
       me a little museum

1057
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:46,041
      here and-- and get a
    lot of old antique stuff

1058
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:48,910
     and learning all about
     the history and stuff,

1059
01:05:48,912 --> 01:05:50,745
  and I got a few things here.

1060
01:05:50,747 --> 01:05:51,913
     So this here, I found.

1061
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:54,015
   That's from the 1870 era.

1062
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:56,651
       That's an old hoe.

1063
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:59,354
What's special about an old hoe?

1064
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:02,157
    That thing was probably
    brought here, probably,

1065
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:04,592
     by the early pioneers.

1066
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:06,795
 That hoe has been used a lot.

1067
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:08,129
   A hoe is about that long.

1068
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,965
 That much has been wore down.

1069
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:10,966
          GEORGE: Wow.

1070
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:12,534
  -So that's been used a lot.

1071
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:15,537
  This is probably-- this hoe
was probably made in the 1820s,

1072
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:17,005
         maybe before.

1073
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:19,374
  -Hey, do you mind if I take
    a picture of that truck

1074
01:06:19,376 --> 01:06:20,041
           out there?

1075
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:21,242
         -No, go ahead.

1076
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:22,944
         That's Charlie
      Manson's old truck.

1077
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:25,213
   And in the back there, you
    might find some bodies.

1078
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:30,618
     GEORGE: Um, could you
      tell me a little bit

1079
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,020
about the history of this place?

1080
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,521
          -Yeah, sure.

1081
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:38,693
   Ballarat started in 1897,
  and it only lasted 20 years

1082
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:39,761
     and went out in 1917--

1083
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:41,363
   [clears throat pointedly]

1084
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:44,766
 ROCK: Due to World War I. This
 road out in front of Ballarat

1085
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:45,633
       that goes south--

1086
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:46,868
            [coughs]

1087
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,436
       ROCK: That used to
      be the old highway.

1088
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:51,406
  And the highway went all the
 way through Barstow and Apple

1089
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:54,442
Valley and down to Los Angeles,
  and it come through Ballarat

1090
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:57,545
      and it went through
        Wild Rose Canyon

1091
01:06:57,547 --> 01:07:00,815
   and it took you into Death
Valley and Nevada and all that.

1092
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:03,485
     -Um, I have the video
       camera in the car,

1093
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:05,587
     and I was wondering if
      it's possible for me

1094
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:06,654
      to do some filming.

1095
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:07,288
             -Sure.

1096
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:07,789
             Sure.

1097
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:08,523
           Go ahead.

1098
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:08,890
          -Thank you.

1099
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:09,524
            -Mm-hm.

1100
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:28,443
  -Can we get out of here now?

1101
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:29,144
      -No, you were right.

1102
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:30,278
      This place is great.

1103
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,013
  I need to go and get him on.

1104
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:33,248
  -No, no, no, you were right.

1105
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,283
       Plus it's blowing
      up a storm out here.

1106
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:36,618
            Come on.

1107
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,520
        -There's nothing
        to be afraid of.

1108
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:40,288
       -No, we're just in
     the middle of nowhere,

1109
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:43,625
    hanging out with Charlie
     Manson's bastard son.

1110
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:45,326
     -I think he's too old.

1111
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:48,363
     -I thought we said we
    could run if I coughed.

1112
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:49,130
             -Yeah.

1113
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:51,933
   -Well, didn't you hear me?

1114
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,567
            -Sorry.

1115
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,005
             -Shit!

1116
01:07:57,007 --> 01:07:58,373
       -I said I'm sorry.

1117
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:01,843
     -No, I think I've left
     my camera at Lewis's.

1118
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:02,444
              -Oh.

1119
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:11,986
       -I can't believe I
       forgot my camera.

1120
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:13,254
    -It's going to be fine.

1121
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,789
     I mean, we'll go back
       to Lewis's, we'll

1122
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,257
get your camera-- it'll be fine.

1123
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,792
  -No, it's not gonna be fine.

1124
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:19,127
         You know, it's
      like two hours back

1125
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:20,762
    to Lewis's place, which
    means we won't have time

1126
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:22,697
to go to Zabriskie Point, which
was the whole reason for coming

1127
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:23,865
        to Death Valley.

1128
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:25,133
        It's like, it's
      like going to Paris

1129
01:08:25,135 --> 01:08:28,703
and not seeing the Eiffel Tower.

1130
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:30,138
        -Think about it.

1131
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,606
      I mean, if you went
      to Paris, would you

1132
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,741
     really want to go and
     see the Eiffel Tower?

1133
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:36,544
Everybody sees the Eiffel Tower.

1134
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:39,047
    I'd much rather see the
    French version of Rock.

1135
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:45,253
           -I guess.

1136
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:48,823
       -You shouldn't be
      so hard on yourself.

1137
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:50,592
    -Easier said than done.

1138
01:08:50,594 --> 01:08:53,728
     I'm my dad's daughter,
   and it's some inheritance.

1139
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:01,002
    -So do you think you'll
      ever have children?

1140
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:03,338
         -I don't know.

1141
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:06,941
     Sometimes I think I'd
   like to, but other times I

1142
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,210
     think it's hard enough
     just looking after me.

1143
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:17,852
         How about you?

1144
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:19,387
           -Children?

1145
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:23,224
  Now unless they've invented
  a way for men to give birth.

1146
01:09:23,226 --> 01:09:23,625
              -Oh.

1147
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:28,930
              Oh!

1148
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:32,233
      Why didn't you say?

1149
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:33,334
             -What?

1150
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:34,736
      -Well, you know, if
     it wasn't for Carlos,

1151
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:36,938
that gorgeous Cuban hairdresser
     that I met in Brooklyn

1152
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,974
    and married, I wouldn't
       have a green card.

1153
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:41,943
     Actually, you know, I
   think you'd get on really

1154
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:42,911
       well with Carlos.

1155
01:09:42,913 --> 01:09:44,746
   Oh, he's such a nice guy.

1156
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:48,516
   I met his family, all down
  in Miami, and they're crazy.

1157
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:49,584
         But you know--

1158
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:50,852
  -What are you talking about?

1159
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:53,621
  -I mean like you and Carlos.

1160
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:55,623
  -I'm sorry-- you've lost me.

1161
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,126
     -Look, you know, half
    my best friends are gay

1162
01:09:58,128 --> 01:09:59,861
    and it's not a problem.

1163
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:00,828
           It's cool.

1164
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:03,698
  -No, I'm not-- I'm not gay.

1165
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:12,307
   Um, I was just telling you
that, you know, I'm-- I'm alone.

1166
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:13,141
              -Oh.

1167
01:10:13,143 --> 01:10:14,609
Well, I mean that might change.

1168
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:05,793
       -I'm gonna have a
       look at the bees.

1169
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:06,394
              -OK.

1170
01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:13,768
        (CALLING) Hello?

1171
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:42,297
       (SHOUTING) George.

1172
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:42,697
            George!

1173
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:01,582
           Oh my god.

1174
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:09,324
        -What happened?

1175
01:12:09,326 --> 01:12:10,358
             Lewis!

1176
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,427
       SOPHIE: I-- I just
      found him like this.

1177
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:17,365
           He's dead.

1178
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:28,643
            George.

1179
01:12:31,614 --> 01:12:33,114
     What are we gonna do?

1180
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:45,893
   Let's just, um-- let's get
   him on the bed, you know?

1181
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:46,861
           -Yeah, OK.

1182
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:47,795
           -Come on.

1183
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:51,799
              -OK.

1184
01:12:56,339 --> 01:12:57,305
           OK, ready?

1185
01:12:57,307 --> 01:12:59,107
             -Yeah.

1186
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:03,711
       -One, two, three.

1187
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:06,948
            [laughs]

1188
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:07,982
       -What's so funny?

1189
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:08,850
          -I'm sorry.

1190
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:09,984
      It's just your face.

1191
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:11,319
       I thought you were
         gonna be next.

1192
01:13:11,321 --> 01:13:12,987
-And you thought that was funny?

1193
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:14,522
        -OK, sorry, OK.

1194
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:15,857
       OK, wait a minute.

1195
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:16,791
          GEORGE: OK.

1196
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:19,193
        One, two, three.

1197
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:29,804
   SOPHIE: Should I-- should
    I just drive back and--

1198
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:31,139
         GEORGE: Yeah.

1199
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:34,609
     SOPHIE: [sigh] Are you
     going to come with me?

1200
01:13:34,611 --> 01:13:35,643
          GEORGE: No.

1201
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:38,212
I don't want Lewis to be alone.

1202
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:25,052
    Little brownies, little
 brownies, your master is dead.

1203
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:29,624
    He's dead and he's gone
  and he's never coming back.

1204
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:32,059
     But that doesn't mean
     you have to die, too.

1205
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:39,800
    Gentle creatures, that's
      what he called you.

1206
01:15:39,802 --> 01:15:40,701
       Gentle creatures.

1207
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:45,039
       Please don't die.

1208
01:15:47,777 --> 01:15:50,511
          We need you.

1209
01:15:50,513 --> 01:15:51,279
        And we're sorry.

1210
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:57,618
 We haven't told you, have you?

1211
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:00,621
   We haven't told you, but I
   hope you can hear me now.

1212
01:16:03,192 --> 01:16:08,062
    Little brownies, little
 brownies, your master is dead,

1213
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,730
  and he's never coming back.

1214
01:16:36,526 --> 01:16:38,225
     -It's weird, isn't it?

1215
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:41,429
  How someone can be here one
   minute and then just gone?

1216
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:50,571
      -We should find out
      where his son lives.

1217
01:16:50,573 --> 01:16:52,173
       -Where did he go?

1218
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:58,479
  I remember when my Mum died.

1219
01:16:58,481 --> 01:17:01,248
      I mean, technically
      she was still alive

1220
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:06,153
     those last few hours,
     but she'd really gone.

1221
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:12,393
    I remember just holding
    her hand and telling her

1222
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:15,262
       that I loved her.

1223
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:19,634
  Then I went to get a coffee
and I came back and she'd gone.

1224
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:25,539
       -Lewis was lucky.

1225
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:31,278
         SOPHIE: Yeah.

1226
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,747
       When I go, I want
        to go like that.

1227
01:17:36,886 --> 01:17:39,053
            -Me too.

1228
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:44,058
  -Now getting sick and going
   to hospital and suffering.

1229
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:48,329
        Just-- you know?

1230
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,965
            -Me too.

1231
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:53,034
      -It's a blessing to
     go that way, isn't it?

1232
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:53,701
         It's the best.

1233
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:01,375
       -Probably, but at
    least when you're sick,

1234
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:04,912

        to make amends.

1235
01:18:04,914 --> 01:18:05,546
         -That's true.

1237
01:18:19,429 --> 01:18:22,630
       -What do you mean?

1238
01:18:22,632 --> 01:18:25,599
   -Well, wouldn't it just be
   better if it disappeared?

1239
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:26,567
          No warning?

1240
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:29,637
            -Maybe.

1241
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:36,644
       That's not the way
     it's going to happen.

1242
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:40,347
     The warnings are here.

         -It's not OK.

1248
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,040
   The world's going to end,
    we're all going to die,

1249
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:08,676
   and I haven't even started
      living my life yet.

1250
01:19:08,678 --> 01:19:09,443
          Not really.

1251

1253

      I have no real home.

1254
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:30,131
    And I've probably fucked
     it up with the one guy

1255
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:33,501
      that I really loved.

1256
01:19:33,503 --> 01:19:34,635

1259

         But I just-- I
       just want to live.

1260
01:20:14,443 --> 01:20:17,278
        That's all I've
       ever wanted to do.

1261
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:23,083
    Don't you want to live?

1262
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:27,855
             -Yes.

1263
01:20:27,857 --> 01:20:29,857
            -Really?

1264
01:20:29,859 --> 01:20:36,430
       I mean, don't you
       just want to live?

1265
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:37,798
          -Yes, I do.

1266

          -What is it?

1267
01:21:31,954 --> 01:21:34,622
           It's dark.

1268
01:21:34,624 --> 01:21:36,123
-Come on and it'll be worth it.

1269
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,959
          -Thank you.

1270
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:20,995

           Hey, wait!

1275
01:23:47,757 --> 01:23:49,623
We never took the last picture.

1276
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:56,063
        GEORGE: He was a
     truly remarkable man.

1277
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:03,604
       I mean, he saw the
       end coming and it

1278
01:24:03,606 --> 01:24:05,205
   didn't fill him with fear.

1279
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:08,142
       It filled him with
        the opportunity

1280
01:24:08,144 --> 01:24:12,746
      to learn, to live in
    the desert with the bees

1281
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:16,116
   and to drink and to laugh.

1282
01:24:29,632 --> 01:24:30,230
              Yes.

1283
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:38,272
     I feel honored to have
     met him, and if you're

1284
01:24:38,274 --> 01:24:42,543
   passing through LA, please
     feel free to call me.

1285

     else I can do to help.

1291
01:26:19,642 --> 01:26:20,440
           How did--

1292
01:26:20,442 --> 01:26:22,776
        -The phone book.

1293
01:26:22,778 --> 01:26:24,811
       Well, actually, it
       was the internet,

1294
01:26:24,813 --> 01:26:27,781
  and it wasn't too difficult.

1295
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:32,519
  I, um, I brought you these.

          -What is it?

1350
01:30:36,999 --> 01:30:38,231
   It's called obselidia.com.

1351
01:30:40,702 --> 01:30:49,943
  O-B-S-E-L-I-D-I-A. It should
   be O-B-S-O, but whatever.

1352
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:51,812
  Check out the entry on love.

1353
01:30:51,814 --> 01:30:54,414
    It's got to be the most
 romantic thing I've ever read.

1354
01:30:58,821 --> 01:31:02,255
    "Some people say love is
 obsolete, but they are wrong.

1355
01:31:02,257 --> 01:31:07,327
 Love is what makes everything
   in the universe possible.

1356
01:31:07,329 --> 01:31:09,930
   Love is not dependent upon
     liking the same movies

1357
01:31:09,932 --> 01:31:14,067
       or on the species'
     need for procreation.

1358
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:16,703
      Love is dependent on
      life and life alone.

1359
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:21,341
   Someone once told me that
  as long as one person loves

1360
01:31:21,343 --> 01:31:22,776
something, it can live forever.

1361
01:31:25,113 --> 01:31:27,180
      You are that person.

1362
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:29,816
      You have that love.

1363
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:31,117
         And I give it
      today to everything

1364
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:35,655
that you want to live tomorrow."

1365
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:36,790
     -It's beautiful, huh?

1366
01:31:46,368 --> 01:31:48,168
      GEORGE (VOICEOVER):
        Maybe it's true.

1367
01:31:53,108 --> 01:31:54,774
     Maybe the whole world
        is disappearing.

1368
01:31:58,247 --> 01:32:06,419
 Species by species, object by
object-- everything in decline.

1369
01:32:09,825 --> 01:32:11,091
         And who knows?

1370
01:32:11,093 --> 01:32:13,426
       I mean, maybe you
     will wake up tomorrow

1371
01:32:13,428 --> 01:32:17,731
      and find everything
       you love is gone.

1372
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:22,702
  But it hasn't all gone yet.

1373
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:29,743
       So in a way, maybe
        Lewis is right.

1374
01:32:29,745 --> 01:32:33,413
 Maybe we've got to accept that
  the whole world is dying off

1375
01:32:33,415 --> 01:32:38,618
      and-- and just enjoy
        it while we can.

1376
01:32:41,356 --> 01:32:47,661
     Treat it with kindness
   and enjoy it while we can.

1377
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:58,004
But I also think this-- we have
  to wake up now to the things

1378
01:32:58,006 --> 01:33:01,274
     that we want to save.

1379
01:33:01,276 --> 01:33:03,143
 And there's no time to waste.

1380
01:33:06,181 --> 01:33:10,150
      We have to know what
        is worth saving,

1381
01:33:10,152 --> 01:33:11,952
       then we have to do
    everything in our power

1382
01:33:11,954 --> 01:33:13,253
  to keep those things alive.

1383
01:33:16,191 --> 01:33:20,060
     That's our only hope.

1384
01:33:20,062 --> 01:33:22,963
       And true, it still
      might not be enough,

1385
01:33:22,965 --> 01:33:26,066
 and everything might be lost.

1386
01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:30,537
     But at least we tried.

1387
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:35,609
       At least we tried.

1388
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:40,880
      And maybe that's it.

1389
01:33:40,882 --> 01:33:44,017
        Maybe that's all
      we can do-- wake up

1390
01:33:44,019 --> 01:33:48,321
    to each fleeting moment,
   so we know we were there.
