The now-defunct Area 52 facility

appears to be in search of something.

- Focus!

If we want to succeed,
we'll have to work together.

Um, well, don't wait for me!

00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,041
- Two...
- Don't screw this up.

174
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,293
Gotta make something big, strong.

175
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,419
Three!

Uh, Jellyfish don't actually have flippers.

I don't know.
But whatever it is, it can't be good.

Um. Anyone seen Aquaman?

207

- AQUAMAN: A little help, please!
- Don't worry. I'll save you!

We really saved the day.

- Lois Lane, <i>Daily Planet.</i>
- Yes, I am aware.

211
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,874
How does it feel to have
been humiliated by Lobo,

212
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,501
and saved, once again, by the Justice League?

213
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:54,381
Well, I'm part of a team.
A win for us all is a win for me.

214
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,258
So, you don't mind that the world watched

215
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:59,678
the King of Atlantis
run away from Lobo like a scared fish?

216
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,681
No, that's
an unfair characterization of fish.

217
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:06,352
- And, uh, I didn't run.
- Lois, if I may?

218
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,188
Aquaman is an essential member
of the Justice League.

219
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,441
- In what way?
- Now, well, he... Uh...

220
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:16,278
- He, uh...
- Don't look at me. I just got here.

221
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:20,115
Aquaman's ability to talk to sea life
is a critical skill.

222
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,202
One that I'm sure
he'll use with great effectiveness,

223
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,538
sometime in the future,
when it becomes necessary.

00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,540
There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.

225
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,460
Aquaman's teammates
are 100% supportive of him,

226
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,672
despite his overly specialized powers.

227
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,300

Lois Lane is signing off.

228

Cut! Great stuff. Let's get back home
and run this on tonight's seven o'clock.

229
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,390
I wouldn't worry about it, Aquaman.

230
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,059
Not many people watch network news anymore.

231
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,938
Oh, I'm not worried.
Besides, we don't get cable in Atlantis.

232
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,650
I'm just excited we're finally all together.

233
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,444
How about we go somewhere
to feast and celebrate?

234
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:01,782
Or, or... Or we figure out
why Lobo was here in the first place.

235
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:04,785
Nothing says celebration like apple pie.

236
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,537

Oh! Fishies!

00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,710
Yes, fish, plants.
We have everything down here.

249
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,211
Even froyo?

250
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,631
Well, no, that melts in the seawater,
but we have colorful rocks.

251
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:03,344
And, uh, uh... Coral! We have coral.

252
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,512

255
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,519
Is it me, or is the water changing color?

256
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,273
Good observation, Cyborg.
Red and yellow wavelengths of light

257
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,525
can only travel so far underwater,

258
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,820
which is why everything
looks blue and green at these depths.

259
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:26,492
Oh, that lack of solar energy
is making me feel a little green.

your super seasickness here in Atlantis!

What's that noise?
Oh, sorry, it sounds like singing.

In his hand is the mystical Trident of Hope.

- There is no such law.
- MAN: Get off the stage!

1192
01:11:30,621 --> 01:11:33,373
And even if there were,
we can see he is worthy,

1193
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:37,711
because he pulled the Trident
of Poseidon from the great statue.

1194
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:41,340
So, Aquaman, my brother,

1195
01:11:41,423 --> 01:11:45,219
I give you back the crown
you so richly deserve.

1196
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:46,595
Thank you...

(CROWD CHEERING)

1199
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:00,317
Huzzah!

1200
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:06,907
Thank you. I promise to be the
best king and the best hero I can be,

1201
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,535
to Atlantis and the world!

1202
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,166
- Now, let us dance!

(MUSIC PLAYING)

1204
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:32,766
Wow. You Atlanteans really
know how to throw a party.

1205
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:34,726
Thank you, Cyborg.

1206
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:37,271
Well, I'm glad everything turned out okay.

1207
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,691
But what are we gonna do about the
Red Lanterns, Dex-Starr and Atrocitus?

1208
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:44,278
- Leave them to me and Fishy.
- (SQUEAKS)

1209
01:12:44,486 --> 01:12:46,905
Turns out Oa placed a bounty on their heads,

1210
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:48,949
and I'm meaning to collect.

1211
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:52,202
This isn't the last you've
heard of me. I'll be...

1212
01:12:52,828 --> 01:12:54,079
Ow!

1213
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:55,247
No!

1214
01:12:55,414 --> 01:12:56,415
(ALL LAUGH)

1215
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:01,003
Thank you for your help, Lobo.

1216
01:13:01,086 --> 01:13:02,629
Yeah, but let's not get mushy.

1217
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:07,217
Next time I see you yahoos,
I may not be on my best behavior.

1218
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:09,052
So long, chumps!

1219

(ALARM BEEPING)

1221
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,477
Cyborg's mobile trouble alert!

1222
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:22,024
It looks like Gorilla Grodd is attacking
the city of Kathmandu in Nepal.

1223
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:25,193
Did someone say
high-altitude snowy mountains,

1224
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:28,113
nowhere near any ocean or body of water?

1225
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,617
That sounds like a job for Aquaman.

1226
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,579
Call if you aren't going to be home
for supper.

1227
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:38,957
Sure will. Well, what are we waiting for?

1228
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,751
People need our help!
