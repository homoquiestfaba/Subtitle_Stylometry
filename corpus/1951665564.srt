1
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:09,926
Shen.

2
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,540
It is time.

3
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:22,041
The evil Yan Lo has awakened
and is on his way.

4
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,516
But I wonder if you're committed enough

5
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,178
to take on this task.

6
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,745
Forgive me, Master. I am ready.

7
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:35,219
Very well. Here. You will need these.

8
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,237
- Where is she?
- In the West.

9
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:49,173
- Fair Springs, California.
- I will not let you down, Master.

10
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,904
It may not be you who lets us down.

11
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,315
Wendy.

12
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,949
Wendy.

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,120
Wendy.

14
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,555
What?

15
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,690
Thank you for returning to Earth,
Miss Wu.

16
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:18,463
Can you identify this mountain range

17
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,199
in northern China?

18
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,036
Is it...

19
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,137
Tell you tomorrow, Mr. Medina. Bye.

20
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,815
Wendy, could this class be
any more boring?

21
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,980
I know. I feel like drawing eyes
on my eyelids so I can take a nap.

22
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,461
We were so perfect for each other.

23
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,464
Why? Why?

24
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,992
Lisa, get it together.
You're getting tears all over my top.

25
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,196
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,801
Thank you for letting me borrow it.

27
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,009
You know what's the fastest way
to get over a guy?

28
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,943
- Get a new guy.
- Get a new guy.

29
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,040
Forget it. My life stinks.

30
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,050
Why can't I have your perfect life, Wen?

31
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,483
You're the most popular girl in school,

32
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,721
everyone's gonna vote for you
for Homecoming Queen,

33
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,627
- and your boyfriend's perfect.
- No, he's not.

34
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,823
I got us salads, Wen.

35
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,629
Okay, he's a little perfect.

36
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,330
I mean, you don't need it
but I'm trying to cut my triceps

37
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,100
for short-sleeved shirts, so...

38
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,336
- And, you know, I got some ab videos...
- Vote for me.

39
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,235
- Hey, guys, want a cookie?
- That is so lame.

40
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,911
Yeah, you're right.
My guns already look good.

41
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,007
No, I mean Jessica.

42
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,008
There you go. Have a cookie.

43
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,485
Thanks, guys.

44
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,046
Jessica Dawson is running against you
for Homecoming Queen?

45
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,823
I so should have
expected this.

46
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,386
Ever since second grade,
everything I do, she has to do.

47
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,364
Thanks a lot.
- Well, this one's mine.

48
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,924
Nobody's gonna give her my vote
for a stale cookie.

49
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,596
- Even your brother?
You've got my vote.

50
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,572
Peter, put that down.

51
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,040
Voting for me?
Good. Have a cookie.

52
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,682
My brother, on a diet.
Football jock, you know.

53
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,278
Thank you. Have a cookie.

54
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,721
Here you go.

55
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,423
Jessica, you're running
for Homecoming Queen?

56
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,791
Oh, my gosh, it's so awesome.

57
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,022
Well, I probably
don't stand a chance against you.

58
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,556
- I'm the one who should just drop out.
- Okay.

59
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,037
This is gonna be so much fun.

60
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,936
- Yeah, good luck.
- Thanks.

61
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,938
What is wrong with you, Peter?

62
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,208
- Chill out. It's just a cookie.
- Spit that out.

63
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,909
That looks like my brother
doesn't support his sister.

64
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,780
How about a little loyalty here?

65
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,583
Fine. I hate raisins anyway.

66
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,055
Hey, Austin.
- Hey, little sis.

67
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,490
You might wanna
check on your loyalty over there.

68
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,084
- Want one of my cookies?
- Sure.

69
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,060
Austin, spit that out!

70
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,226
Mom, this is important.
Don't you remember?

71
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,104
I do my report on Florida
then she has to do hers on Texas,

72
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,142
just because it's bigger.

73
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:14,443
And in fourth grade, when I broke
my arm and everyone signed my cast,

74
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,879
Jessica had everyone sign her leg,
and it wasn't even broken.

75
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,815
Wendy, what do you want me to do?

76
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,287
I'm at work here and I have an exhibit
opening in two weeks.

77
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,086
But, Mom, this is supposed to be
my homecoming,

78
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,786
and she's gonna take it away from me

79
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,590
if I don't come up with a way
to get more votes.

80
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,435
Look, honey, I understand
how important this is to you,

81
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,470
but the museum director
is counting on me

82
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,737
to put together this exhibit
of ancient Chinese artifacts,

83
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,039
and I'm getting stressed out

84
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,307
because I don't know the history
behind any of them.

85
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,579
You know,
I used to think my mother's stories

86
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,481
about the Buddhist legends
were so silly.

87
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,919
Should have listened to her more.

88
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,321
Mom, what am I gonna do
about Jessica?

89
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,586
You know what you're gonna do?

90
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,787
You're gonna forget
about homecoming for a minute

91
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,888
and remember that there are
some things more important in life.

92
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:06,989
Like what?

93
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,364
Like maybe
your responsibilities at home.

94
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,802
When is the last time you did
some laundry, or cleaned your room,

95
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,362
or fed your dog?

96
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,067
Good thing
your brother's such a messy eater

97
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,110
or poor Cupcake would have starved.

98
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,737
Cupcake. Yeah.

99
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,809
"Vote for Wendy" cupcakes.

100
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,578
Way better than Jessica's cookies.
Thanks, Mom.

101
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,413
Sorry. Bye.

102
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,342
Daddy, you have the mixer on too high.

103
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,440
Well, honey,

104
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,213
I'm an ad agency executive, not a baker.

105
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,279
How about I come up with a nice,
catchy slogan for you instead?

106
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,153
- Like what?
- Like...

107
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:40,920
How about,

108
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,795
"Wendy who?
Wendy Wu for Homecoming Queen!"

109
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,667
They really pay you for that?

110
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,664
Grandma, I'm not gonna put
Chinese on my cupcakes.

111
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,935
No, no, no.

112
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,843
I was telling the widow
the doctor was really her son.

113
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,112
Why don't you watch
American soap operas

114
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,775
so that we could all understand?

115
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,649
I do. The Spanish ones.

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,121
Hi, I'm home. Sorry I'm late.

117
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,757
Oh, my... What happened here?

118
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,920
Homecoming Queen did it.
I'm not cleaning up.

119
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,201
Ma, I really need your help
with this Chinese stuff

120
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,931
the director dumped on me.

121
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,035
I've done a lot of the research

122
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:32,805
but I feel like I'm missing
some of the folklore and legends.

123
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,680
I told you the stories.

124
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,373
I know you did, Ma,
but I was too little to appreciate them.

125
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,718
Anyway, it's not like I missed having
that Chinese culture in my life.

126
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,923
Just because you don't miss it
doesn't mean it isn't missing.

127
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,206
Delivery.

128
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,981
Thanks.

129
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,023
It must be for this Chinese thing
they're doing here.

130
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,155
- See you.
- Bye.

131
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,625
- I can't believe I finally finished.
- You're welcome.

132
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,971
Thanks, Daddy.

133
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,766
When I win, I'll mention you
in my acceptance speech.

134
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,707
Okay. Good night.

135
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,738
Make sure you clean up.

136
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,475
Wait. You're not gonna help me...

137
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,845
Good night.

138
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,687
Grandma?
- Forget it.

139
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,814
Your mess. You clean.

140
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,897
May I help you?

141
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,931
- Hello?
- Oh, sorry.

142
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,308
It's just that you look so

143
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,471
different.

144
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,644
- You know me?
- Yes, you're Miaozhen,

145
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,418
woman warrior born in the Wei Dynasty,

146
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,813
sworn to defeat evil.

147
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,123
It is your time again.

148
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,890
Right. It is time. Goodbye.

149
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,456
Don't be frightened.

150
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,230
I'm a Buddhist monk
from Gingi Mountain Temple.

151
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,101
Wait. How did you... You were just...

152
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,842
Who's in there?

153
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,783
Museum security.

154
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,154
I've got pepper spray.

155
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,199
Hey, Al,
your pizza's getting cold.

156
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,146
Hey, Al, what's up?

157
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,944
Right. That's $11.43.

158
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,755
Hey, that's my mom's.

159
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,380
What?

160
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,519
That's Wendy, my sister. You know her.

161
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,188
Dude, are you all right?

162
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,698
Your breath reeks.

163
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,071
Yeah, he had a ponytail
and a cheap bathrobe.

164
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,037
I know.
Jessica probably sent him to scare me.

165
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,310
Can you believe her?

166
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,812
I swear, when we hand out
my killer cupcakes,

167
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,008
Jessica's totally gonna back off.

168
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,652
<i>73 in Sacramento. 79 in Stockton.</i>

169
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,120
- No way.
- <i>I have a cousin in Stockton.</i>

170
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,020
- Quick! Turn on Channel 5.
- <i>Hey, Amy.</i>

171
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,889
<i>And right here in Fair Springs</i>
<i>it's gonna be 72 and partly cloudy,</i>

172
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,451
<i>but always sunny and nice</i>

173
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,554
<i>with all my friends at Fair Springs High.</i>

174
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,428
She's the guest weather person?

175
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,693
<i>And remember,</i>

176
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,361
<i>pick up one of my "Jessica</i>
<i>for Homecoming Queen" cupcakes</i>

177
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,495
<i>tomorrow.</i>

178
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:06,978
No! No!

179
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,646
Whoa!

180
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,880
I'm home?

181
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,018
Cool.

182
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,476
Wow, these are really made out of clay?

183
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,878
Yeah, they're terra cotta warriors.

184
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,438
There were 6,000 of them

185
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,609
buried in the tomb
of the first Emperor of China

186
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,118
in 210 B.C.

187
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,681
And the Chinese Government
sent us eight of them.

188
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,781
- Isn't that great?
- Sure.

189
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,452
You see, the first Emperor,
Qin Shi Huangdi, was buried with them

190
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,428
because the people believed
they would guard him in the afterlife,

191
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,556
but they didn't.
There's a legend that says

192
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:05,262
every 90 years, they come
under the spell of Yan Lo, an evil spirit.

193
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,673
I've never seen you this excited
about Chinese history before.

194
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,504
I know. It's weird.

195
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,635
We didn't care about this
when we were kids, did we?

196
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,409
No, <i>Everybody Wang Chung Tonight</i>
was about as cultural as we got.

197
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,085
I gotta go. Gonna be late.

198
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,451
Stop it.
The neighbors are gonna see you.

199
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,728
- See you later, Dad.
- Goodbye.

200
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,790
- Where's Peter?
- He's still sleeping.

201
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,995
He put this ugly necklace on me
last night.

202
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,766
Very funny, Peter.

203
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,567
I should get going, too.
I'm gonna be late.

204
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,269
Mom, what's this?

205
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,971
It's Gingi Mountain Temple.
It dates back over 1,500 years.

206
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,878
No, no, no, these bald guys.

207
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,881
They're monks.

208
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,680
Well,
don't they have ponytails?

209
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,556
Buddhist monks shave their heads.
Why are you asking?

210
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,891
No reason. Gotta go.

211
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,752
Hey, hey,
aren't you taking your cupcakes?

212
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,457
No, you take them. Bye.

213
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,500
But there's 500 of them. Wendy!

214
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,630
Hey, Wen, do you want a ride?
- Sure.

215
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,162
Wait!

216
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,802
- You must wear this.
- Let's go.

217
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,476
It will protect you.

218
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,513
For your sake, Wendy,
you must wear this!

219
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,073
- Who's that?
- How should I know? Just go.

220
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,014
I think he knows you.

221
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,234
So just because he IMs me
he thinks I'll come running back.

222
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,634
What a jerk.

223
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,605
Look, you just stay strong and proud,
and if he IMs you again,

224
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,905
we'll start a rumor that you're already
going out with a senior, right?

225
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,939
Right?

226
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,278
Oh, you didn't.

227
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,548
- You're back with him?
- Just a little.

228
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,450
Do you believe her, Wen?

229
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,247
Wen?

230
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,546
What?

231
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,252
- Are you all right?
Yeah.

232
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,888
You're not still thinking about
that guy in the bathrobe, are you?

233
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,955
No, of course not. Why?

234
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,091
'Cause here he comes.

235
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,406
Go! The light's green! Go!

236
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,073
Wendy!

237
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,775
Wendy! Stop!

238
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,747
Please!

239
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,740
Stop!

240
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,585
You're in danger! Stop!

241
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,052
Please!

242
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,622
Ow!

243
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,163
Wendy!

244
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,533
- Well, that was really weird.
- Bizarre.

245
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,903
I say we act like that never happened.

246
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,672
- Cool.
- Absolutely.

247
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,277
Come on, girls.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

248
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,720
Hey, Wendy.
Did you see me on TV last night?

249
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,020
- No, you were on TV?
- Yeah.

250
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,720
- I did the weather on Channel 5.
- Oh, sorry, I missed it.

251
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,195
I was out with Austin. Hey, Austin!

252
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,355
Pass it on the inside.

253
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,625
On the wing.

254
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,101
Keep your head in the game, Wendy.

255
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,742
Nice play, Jessica.

256
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,607
Saw you on TV last night.

257
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,442
You're gonna make
a great Homecoming Queen.

258
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,538
Thanks, Coach Gibbs.

259
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,412
Jessica, why don't you
goalie for a while?

260
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,213
Tina! You're in.

261
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,884
There you go.
There you go. Watch it.

262
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,048
Over here.

263
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,823
There you go.
There you go. Watch it.

264
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,756
Pass me the ball.

265
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,457
Come on, girls.

266
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,706
That's it. Pick it up. Energy!

267
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,821
Yes! Way to go!

268
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,485
- Nice hustle.
Jessica.

269
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,927
Okay, let's give her
some air, ladies.

270
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,488
Are you okay?
- How did you do that?

271
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,966
I don't know.
- She had it coming.

272
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,463
She's trying
to steal your popularity.

273
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,069
Nice work.
- Okay.

274
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,041
I think I'm giving it to her.

275
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,628
How'd you get in here, fella?

276
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,182
That's it, girls. Keep it up.

277
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,842
- Push it.
- Oh, not you.

278
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,910
Look, why are you following me?
What do you want?

279
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,889
Please, you are in much danger.

280
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,653
Did you put that on me last night?

281
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,926
How'd you get in my house?

282
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,663
I think you're starting to creep me out.
I'm turning you in.

283
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,093
Believe me. I'm a Buddhist monk

284
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,536
who has come a great distance
to find you.

285
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,040
And that's another thing.
You are not a monk.

286
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,440
Buddhist monks shave their heads,
so there.

287
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,207
I was allowed to grow my hair
so that I might fit in when I found you.

288
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,114
I don't know what fashion magazines
you've been reading,

289
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,415
but a stringy ponytail and a weird robe
is not fitting in.

290
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,821
But it is my destiny to help you.
Evil is near.

291
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,052
Look, the only evil I know

292
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,459
is my history teacher
and Jessica Dawson.

293
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,656
And I don't think you can help me
with them.

294
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,428
You find you have skills
you cannot explain.

295
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,297
- What do you mean?
- That kick on the field.

296
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:28,275
- Crude but very powerful.
- It's a bicycle kick.

297
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,206
Your ancestors would call it
dragon whips tail.

298
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,477
Okay, look,

299
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:40,380
I'll admit there's been some weird stuff
going on with me lately,

300
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,689
so I'm gonna give you,
like, a minute to tell me what's up.

301
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,198
I have been reincarnated many times
over the centuries

302
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,597
to assist the descendant
of the Yin warrior

303
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,761
to battle evil in the name of good.

304
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,940
You know, Yoda, this is already
getting a little too <i>Star Wars-y</i> for me.

305
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,269
The evil is imprisoned
in the Ganzi jade globe.

306
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:05,313
It's called Yan Lo, a powerful spirit.

307
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,747
Ooh, scary.

308
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,418
Every 90 years the globe weakens,

309
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:13,082
allowing him to break free
and possess the bodies of mortals

310
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,457
to challenge the next descendant
of the Yin warrior.

311
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,401
That kind of looks like me.

312
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,464
I really don't like where this is going.

313
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,476
You must follow in the steps
of your ancestors.

314
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,104
It is your turn to defeat Yan Lo.

315
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,272
Me? Well, what if I don't?

316
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,282
Famine, earthquakes,

317
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:43,645
oceans rising, locusts,
fires, drought, darkness...

318
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,713
Okay, okay, I get it. It's bad.

319
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,757
Oh, there you are, Wen.
Hey, we're going to the mall.

320
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,352
You wanna come with?

321
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,262
Your kung fu training must begin now.

322
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,534
Wait up, guys! I've got a new skirt
with no matching lipstick.

323
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,968
I don't get it. How could you not know
that he was coming to visit?

324
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:07,068
Tory, I told you. He's from China.
It's not their custom to call first.

325
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,045
Well, why is he dressed like that?

326
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,979
He's not gonna hang around you
all the time, is he?

327
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,142
No, look,
can we not talk about this anymore?

328
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,913
- What does he want?
- Oh, hang on. I've got another call.

329
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,314
- Hello?
- Hey, I still don't get it.

330
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,291
How could you not know
you had a cousin in China?

331
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,763
Hang on. Let me three-way.

332
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,797
Look, you guys,
my cousin's practically leaving already.

333
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,134
So it'll probably be better
for the homecoming vote

334
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,002
if we just kept him a secret.

335
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,598
You know, if Jessica found out,

336
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,939
she'd think of some way
to use it against me.

337
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,308
- Totally.
- Sure.

338
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:43,805
Hang on.

339
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:47,082
- Hello?
- Hey, Wen.

340
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,216
Listen, I hear you have
an interesting new friend.

341
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,253
Well, I hope he gets you the monk vote.

342
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,691
- That's a great idea, Tory!
- What's a great idea?

343
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,562
We'll write "Vote for Wendy"
on a bunch of chopsticks

344
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,724
and get your cousin to hand them out
at lunch tomorrow.

345
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,098
- Isn't it awesome?
- No.

346
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,535
No, forget it. I'll talk to you guys later.

347
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,271
You must wear this now.

348
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,872
It will protect you during your training.

349
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,952
Look, I don't wanna be rude

350
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,583
but you hanging around me
is making my life a little complicated.

351
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,690
Please, go back to your temple of doom
or whatever.

352
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,662
Look, I never agreed to train.

353
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,631
You'll just have to find
some other girl to be your warrior.

354
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:39,767
I know. Look, why don't you ask
Sarah Goldberg in my homeroom?

355
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,296
She's got no life. I'm sure
she'll kung fu with you all you want.

356
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,207
The evil spirit
could be anyone around you.

357
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,139
Please.

358
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,177
Go away. I'm not your warrior.

359
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,218
Om.

360
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,655
You will be a great warrior.

361
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,664
Ouch.

362
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,871
Did you do
the world history homework?

363
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,931
I know. That stuff's so hard.

364
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,669
I finished it. It was all right.

365
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,577
Frank, you all right?

366
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,888
What's he doing?

367
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,427
It's sacred monk stuff.

368
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,624
That's cool.

369
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,358
Interesting.

370
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,697
- We'll catch you at lunch, okay, Wen?
- Okay.

371
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,629
Remember what we always say
about these punks.

372
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,004
Never show them fear.

373
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,834
Never let them smell it, either.

374
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,153
We've got a big problem now.

375
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,348
You're embarrassing me
and messing with my rep.

376
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:16,484
I would not have to do this
if you would only wear the medallion.

377
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,094
Evil is here.

378
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:22,699
Look, the only thing evil around here
is Mr. Nunan over there.

379
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,834
You have no idea.

380
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,067
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, Austin.

381
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,371
I don't think so.

382
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,848
You know the rules
on public displays of affection.

383
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,284
- She started it, Mr. Tobias.
- Austin!

384
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,751
I got my eye on you, Wendy Wu.

385
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:52,986
- You are so bad.
- Well, you didn't call me last night.

386
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,964
I wanted to tell you
I finally got a letter back

387
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,433
from that modeling agency
in San Francisco

388
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,437
and they said
my pictures were '80s retro.

389
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,763
That's good, right?

390
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,544
- Yeah, congratulations.
- Thanks.

391
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,477
So, I hear... I hear your cousin's in town.

392
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,813
Oh, my gosh,
it's been so embarrassing.

393
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,919
- Why?
- That's why.

394
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,818
He's not the evil one.
You're safe to speak with him.

395
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,155
Thanks.

396
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,221
Listen, why don't you check to see
if the bathroom is safe for me?

397
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,859
Good idea.
Your instincts are becoming sharp.

398
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,868
What's up with that?

399
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:38,841
Oh, he's from, like, real deep,
deep inside China

400
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,435
and it's a very careful culture.

401
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:42,802
Huh.

402
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,877
So we're still going
to Maria Santiago's party, right?

403
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,076
Oh, yeah.

404
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,119
The next Homecoming Queen
shouldn't be partying

405
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,484
without the Homecoming King.

406
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,525
Wendy, toilet now safe.

407
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,897
- I guess I'll see you at lunch.
- Yeah.

408
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,095
Many angry girls waiting for you to go.

409
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:08,328
Wendy, I'm so glad I ran into you.
Actually, you ran into me.

410
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,873
Anyway, I hope you know

411
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,808
I was only kidding the other night,
on the phone, about your cousin.

412
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,276
Oh, don't worry about it.

413
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,178
That's how you and I are. We kid.
We're like that.

414
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,420
Oh, since I won't see you
at soccer practice,

415
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,820
I am so sorry about the disqualification.

416
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,051
- From what? Soccer?
- Yeah.

417
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,323
And probably a bunch
of other extracurricular activities like,

418
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,262
oh, I don't know, homecoming eligibility.

419
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,392
- Not much left. I took this for you.
- Not now.

420
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,301
- What do you mean?
- Oh, it's written in the school bylaw.

421
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,499
"Any student participating
in any extracurricular activity

422
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,475
"must maintain a minimum C average
in all subjects."

423
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,075
- World history.
- Yeah.

424
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,510
I don't know
how the counselor found out. Sorry.

425
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,247
What am I thinking?

426
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,588
I can't get an A in world history.

427
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,560
I don't know anything about China.

428
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,223
Midterms are in a week. There's no way.

429
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,732
- I will help you.
- What?

430
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,398
Your school lessons.

431
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,995
I know everything
about the history of China.

432
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,006
It's required in the temple.

433
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,969
Well, that's nice but we're in school.

434
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,373
Temple and school are just places.

435
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,244
Chinese history is in here.

436
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,186
I can teach you how to look within.

437
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,943
You are kind of smart.

438
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,621
Okay, you can tutor me.

439
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,792
You must agree to wear the medallion
and begin your kung fu training.

440
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,325
You know, you're like a dog with a bone
with this kung fu thing.

441
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,233
Deal. You tutor, I'll train.

442
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,403
Could you monks
have made this any uglier?

443
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,451
Aren't you gonna stretch?

444
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,785
If we're gonna do kung fu,

445
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,484
you don't wanna pull a muscle
or something.

446
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,325
I am stretching,
and you don't "do" kung fu.

447
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,433
- Kung fu is a way of life.
- Oh, sorry.

448
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,930
Did you get that out of a movie?

449
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,838
It sounded better
when Jackie Chan said it.

450
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,270
So, how long is this gonna take?

451
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,713
Because we really should get started
on my tutoring.

452
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:35,479
Not that I'm dumb or anything
but that could take longer.

453
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,516
We will have time for both.

454
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:46,028
<i>So who's gonna save the world</i>
<i>for me?</i>

455
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,691
<i>Who's gonna change?</i>

456
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,927
<i>Who's gonna change?</i>

457
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:58,034
<i>Who's gonna find a better way</i>

458
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,373
<i>And make it their way?</i>

459
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:03,737
Wait. Hold on.

460
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:06,408
<i>We need a hero</i>

461
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,076
Hey, Tory. What's up?
You wanna go shopping later?

462
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,483
<i>To save us from ourselves</i>

463
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,679
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

464
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,620
<i>Lookin' for a hero</i>

465
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,919
<i>Like nobody else</i>

466
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,052
<i>We need a hero</i>

467
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,462
<i>But if we can't find one</i>

468
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,503
<i>I will do it myself</i>

469
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,969
<i>I will</i>

470
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,472
<i>We need a hero</i>

471
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:32,634
Hey, Lisa.

472
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,177
<i>To save us from ourselves</i>

473
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,543
<i>Lookin' for a hero</i>

474
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:37,672
Sorry.

475
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,308
<i>Like nobody else</i>

476
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,352
<i>We need a hero</i>

477
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,478
Oh, nice!

478
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,919
Watch your fingers.

479
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,958
<i>But if we can't find one</i>

480
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,117
Sorry.

481
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,387
<i>I will do it myself</i>

482
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,655
One more time?

483
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,822
<i>I will, I will</i>

484
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,091
What?

485
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,427
What? What?

486
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,264
<i>I will, I will, I will</i>

487
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,168
As much as I enjoyed kicking you

488
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,002
I think we should get started
on my tutoring. I'll get my books.

489
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,633
You won't need your books.

490
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,771
As a Yin warrior, you are connected
to all of your ancestors as one life.

491
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,915
Well, what does this have to do
with my D in world history?

492
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:17,249
Your midterm is on China
and that history is within you.

493
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,551
Wait.
Are you saying I don't have to study?

494
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,989
No, we all have to study.

495
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,185
You just have to learn

496
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,820
how to remember
1,500 years of lessons.

497
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,261
Wait. Okay.

498
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,530
I'll go with this for a minute.

499
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,466
How exactly do I remember this stuff?

500
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,437
You must focus your mind
through meditation.

501
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,775
That weird trance thing you do,
going "yum"?

502
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,572
Not "yum."

503
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,445
Om.

504
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,707
No.

505
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,606
Too bad. You would have been
a great Yin warrior

506
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,675
and beautiful Homecoming Queen.

507
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,951
Om?

508
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,886
Om.

509
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:00,256
Om.

510
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,799
Om.

511
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:08,028
Om.

512
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,739
Om.

513
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,977
Om.

514
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,944
Om.

515
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,747
Om.

516
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,915
I did it! I did it!
I remembered everything!

517
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,046
I got an A! Thank you so much!

518
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,556
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

519
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,428
Sorry, Todd.

520
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,197
This is good.

521
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,932
Now that you've focused your mind,
your training will come much easier.

522
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,975
Okay, I'm a little behind
but I think I can catch up.

523
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,738
- Good. We start now.
- Right.

524
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,507
Posters and flyers.

525
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,707
"Wendy for Homecoming Queen" flyers.

526
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,513
No, your training, you're not done.

527
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,419
Shen, I promised but I didn't say when.

528
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,013
We'll finish this summer.

529
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,516
All right, fine.

530
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,718
Right after homecoming.

531
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,194
Hey, Tory. Guess what?

532
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,699
But evil is very near. We must be ready.

533
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:15,765
Wendy.

534
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,641
- Time for dinner.
- In a minute, Grandma.

535
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,805
Funny, Grandma.

536
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,553
Grandma, do you ever miss China?

537
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,717
Sometimes.

538
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,993
When I see something
or hear something

539
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,427
or even smell something

540
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:43,329
that reminds me of the village
where I grew up.

541
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,562
Lian He.

542
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,495
That's pretty.

543
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,341
- What's it mean?
- Lotus place.

544
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,636
What do you miss most?

545
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,475
Sitting on my grandfather's lap

546
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:03,008
on rainy days when he couldn't go
to work in the fields.

547
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,080
I can still smell his pipe

548
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:11,016
and hear his voices telling me
thousand-year-old stories

549
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:14,923
about great heroes and their battles.

550
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,396
My favorite was about a girl
who was trained by a young monk

551
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,706
to fight evil.

552
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,178
Her name was Miaozhen.

553
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,670
And they say every 90 years

554
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:35,082
her descendants
must accept responsibility

555
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,518
and become a Yin warrior.

556
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:42,053
Yeah, but, Grandma,
you don't really believe that stuff,

557
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,321
do you?

558
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,931
Of course I believe it.

559
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:53,770
You told her?

560
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,897
I didn't have to. She already knew.

561
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,400
My mother was a Yin warrior

562
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,236
and you will be one, too.

563
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,407
- It's a great honor.
- Grandma.

564
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,476
Hi, everybody. I'm home.

565
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,119
What smells so...

566
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,748
Oh, hi.

567
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,091
Who's this?

568
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:25,023
Ma, why didn't you tell us
that your grandnephew

569
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,730
on your second cousin's father's side
was visiting?

570
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,906
I thought I told you, or I meant to,

571
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:35,304
or I'm just old.

572
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,148
- Dad, can I grow a ponytail?
- No, that's silly.

573
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,884
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

574
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,182
It's just that...

575
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,450
Look, Shen, even though
it's a little bit unannounced,

576
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,151
we want you to feel welcome.

577
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,160
Please stay as long as you want.

578
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,726
How long do you think that'll be?

579
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,957
Ow!

580
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,334
Leg cramp.

581
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,432
I think he has to leave soon.

582
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:04,901
I mean,

583
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,175
you can't stay long, right, Shen?

584
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:12,477
Oh, yes, I will be leaving
as soon as I complete my mission.

585
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,242
- Your mission? What's your mission?
- Visiting.

586
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,618
He's on a mission to visit us.

587
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,749
It's a Chinese thing.
You wouldn't understand.

588
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,194
Enough talk. It's very rude to our guest.

589
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,258
Eat.

590
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,103
Do you not find the history
of the terra cotta warriors

591
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,729
to be fascinating?

592
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:37,831
How do you know about that?

593
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,035
Oh, great. He reads minds, too.

594
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,374
I cannot read minds.

595
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:46,549
I saw a poster about your exhibit
of the Qin Dynasty artifacts.

596
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,584
Oh, right, the posters.

597
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,613
Yeah, it's really fascinating

598
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,316
but I'm having a hard time
getting the research straight.

599
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,415
Perhaps I could help you.

600
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,687
One of my teachers at Gingi Temple

601
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,992
is a direct descendant
of Qin Shi Huangdi,

602
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,659
the first Emperor of the Qin Dynasty.

603
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,461
Hey.

604
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,401
Does it get cold under your robe, dude?

605
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,673
Somebody stop him, please.

606
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,211
Shen, I would be so grateful

607
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,112
if you could help me understand
the history of some of the artifacts.

608
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:21,379
The exhibit is next week
and I have to get everything organized.

609
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,113
It will be my honor.

610
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,350
- Hey, Shen, do you know any kung fu?
- Of course.

611
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:30,154
- I have studied it for a very long time.
- Cool.

612
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,795
Do you think
you could show me a couple moves?

613
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,354
My football coach, he's always on me
about shaking the linebackers.

614
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,332
They're always tagging me
from the side.

615
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,063
Oh, football. American sport.

616
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:45,300
I find in defending against attacks
from the side, <i>wang ting chen</i> moves.

617
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,067
What did he say, Grandma?

618
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,408
Shen will explain. I get the dessert.

619
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,317
- May I demonstrate?
- Please.

620
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,088
I believe that <i>wang ting chen</i> in English

621
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,317
is "monkey jumps over wall."

622
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,260
"Monkey jumps over wall"?

623
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:08,224
- That sounded cooler in Chinese, man.
- I agree.

624
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,527
Whoa!

625
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,103
Wow, that was great.

626
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,903
- Dude, you gotta teach me that.
- Of course.

627
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,769
Oh, my. Are these mooncakes?

628
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,344
What are mooncakes?

629
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,575
A very special pastry that is made

630
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,982
to celebrate
the Chinese Autumn Moon Festival.

631
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,520
- Cool, when is that?
- Soon.

632
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,820
Ma, you haven't made these
since I was a kid.

633
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,951
I didn't make them.

634
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:43,428
Please, I hope you enjoy them.

635
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,498
Mmm. Dude, these are good.

636
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,102
- Kenny, aren't you gonna have one?
- No.

637
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,410
Excuse me.

638
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,150
Can I have his?

639
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,586
Ow!

640
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,053
But Shen is really sweet.

641
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,124
Tory, nobody cares.

642
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,668
Just because they see me with him

643
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:21,363
doesn't mean
they're not gonna vote for me.

644
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,397
I know he's a monk.

645
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,638
Who cares how he dresses?

646
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,574
Look, I've gotta go. Bye.

647
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:36,409
These are good.

648
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,718
But how do you get the orange
off your fingers?

649
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,052
Suck them.

650
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,622
They're good, huh?

651
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,167
Oh, hey, I was practicing that move.
Watch.

652
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,767
Are you all right?

653
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,539
Oh, yeah.

654
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,371
I meant to do that.

655
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,651
Peter, can you give me and Shen
a ride to the mall?

656
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,423
- Mom said you can go shopping?
- Yeah.

657
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,726
The same way Dad said
it was okay for you to ditch school

658
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,789
and go surfing last week.

659
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,161
I'll get the car.

660
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,173
How did you do that?

661
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:35,575
It's an ancient American move called,
"Monkey jumps for smarter sister."

662
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,713
Come on.

663
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,646
Okay, we've got an hour till closing.
We've got work to do.

664
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:47,281
- Are we training here?
- Sort of. Come on.

665
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:50,554
<i>I've got a song</i>
<i>but I ain't got no melody</i>

666
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:51,952
<i>Come on</i>

667
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:56,056
<i>How am I gonna sing it</i>
<i>with my friends?</i>

668
00:48:56,566 --> 00:49:00,229
<i>I've got a song</i>
<i>but I ain't got no melody</i>

669
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:04,835
<i>How am I gonna sing it</i>
<i>with my friends?</i>

670
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:08,036
<i>Will it go round in circles?</i>

671
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,908
<i>All right</i>

672
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,949
<i>Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky?</i>

673
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,586
<i>Will it go round in circles?</i>

674
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:22,650
<i>Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky?</i>

675
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,389
<i>Listen</i>

676
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:29,956
<i>I've got a little dance</i>
<i>but I ain't got no steps</i>

677
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:34,830
<i>I'm gonna let the music</i>
<i>move me round</i>

678
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:40,406
<i>I've got a little dance</i>
<i>but I ain't got no steps</i>

679
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,776
<i>Gonna let the music move me round</i>

680
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:46,315
<i>Will it go round in circles?</i>

681
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,177
<i>Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky?</i>

682
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,226
Come on. Come on!

683
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,993
I thought you were too full.

684
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,361
This mooncake is so good.

685
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,304
I think I owe Shen an apology.

686
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:17,077
I didn't mean to be rude to him.

687
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,772
But it's just
when I saw these mooncakes,

688
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,579
it was like I was a boy again.

689
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,551
And then I felt guilty that I grew up
turning my back on all of this.

690
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:31,451
- I don't wanna do that anymore.
- You didn't do it alone.

691
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:36,094
I want us to be
a Chinese-American family.

692
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,703
- Can I have a bite?
- No.

693
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:41,965
Kenny.

694
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,001
It's so strange.

695
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,408
In one night, this long lost relative
comes into our lives,

696
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,042
and in one evening,

697
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:56,142
he gives your mother
a little piece of the old country,

698
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,346
gives Peter a football move,

699
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,617
finds some missing pieces in your work,

700
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,989
and opens my eyes
to something we've been missing.

701
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,428
- It's wonderful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

702
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:14,227
It's just a little sad because I don't think
Wendy will get anything out of this.

703
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,304
Well, I'll see you guys later.
I'm kind of busy, okay?

704
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,434
All right.

705
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,273
- Hey, babe.
- Oh, hi.

706
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,741
What do you think?

707
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,075
Your shirt. It looks nice.

708
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:29,413
No.

709
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,548
My hair.

710
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,857
- It looks the same.
- I got highlights. See?

711
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,056
I figure when we win homecoming,

712
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,425
the stage lights
will really bring them out.

713
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,895
Yeah, great.

714
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,096
Who are you looking for?

715
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:47,432
Nobody. I just thought
maybe Shen would be around.

716
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,597
- Who?
- My cousin.

717
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,303
Oh, yeah.

718
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:54,070
You know, we gotta stay away from him.

719
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:57,602
He's gonna wreck it for us.
People are starting to talk.

720
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,343
Well, people
should mind their own business.

721
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,079
- Maybe he's a nice guy.
- Nice guy.

722
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,654
Well, Warren's a nice guy, too,

723
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,189
but if we let him hang out with us,

724
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:10,624
we might as well wait
to buy our clothes on sale, you know?

725
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:13,993
- Austin, that sounds a little snobby.
- Thank you.

726
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,588
Vote for Wendy.

727
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,394
I don't think
we're gonna have an image problem

728
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,764
with Shen anymore.

729
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,936
Vote for Wendy
for Homecoming Queen.

730
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,200
Yeah, sure, I'll vote for Wendy.

731
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,366
Vote for Wendy.

732
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,933
- Wendy, is that your cousin?
- What did you do?

733
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,535
Vote for Wendy.

734
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,008
Vote for Wendy
for Homecoming Queen.

735
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,051
He went from monk to hunk.

736
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,211
Does he know Tony and I
are fighting a lot?

737
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,278
Sorry, guys, Shen's busy.

738
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:40,956
Here, take one.

739
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,782
Let's go. You look great.

740
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,727
Everybody was talking about you
at school today.

741
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:56,704
- You're kind of a celebrity.
- Yes, it was fun.

742
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,132
I've never worn anything
except that stupid robe.

743
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,644
Is that why you were so willing
to change?

744
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:08,278
Buddhists say the tiger is the mightiest
but it is the chameleon who will endure.

745
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,549
You are such a liar.

746
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,820
You did it for me, didn't you?

747
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:19,353
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

748
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,400
This is good.

749
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,227
What is name of this taste?

750
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:30,102
- Chocolate. What else?
- Chocolate.

751
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,336
Wait.
You've never had chocolate before?

752
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,401
- Well, don't they have it in China?
- I'm not sure.

753
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,539
I've never come across it
in my reincarnations.

754
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,717
So you remember
every one of your past lives?

755
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:49,314
Some better than others.
Not all Yin warriors are memorable.

756
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,560
Will I be?

757
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:55,888
No.

758
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,298
I do remember
your great-grandmother very well.

759
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,574
- She almost failed.
- Why?

760
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,808
- Was she weak?
- No.

761
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,681
Yan Lo was stronger

762
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,240
and has been getting stronger
every time.

763
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:19,350
That's why you must train harder
than any of your ancestors.

764
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,058
If I do, will I win?

765
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:25,024
I hope so,

766
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:29,122
but you may have to find the strength
within you that I can't teach you,

767
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:33,866
or this may be the end for me
and you and everything good.

768
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,265
Whoa!

769
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:37,965
Not too much pressure.

770
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,206
Let's talk about something else.

771
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,212
Tell me about your girlfriends.

772
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,113
You've never had a girlfriend?

773
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,515
What's it like being in love?

774
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,891
I don't know.
I'll tell you when it happens.

775
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:59,291
You and Austin are not in love?

776
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,764
Look, Austin's a nice guy

777
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,667
but he's only in love with himself.

778
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,600
Then why are you with him?

779
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:15,238
I guess it's because everyone says
we look good together.

780
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,240
And it'll probably help me
win Homecoming Queen.

781
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,607
An illusion of the heart.

782
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:25,543
- Another Buddhist saying?
- No, a Shen saying.

783
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,957
Tell you what, since you like
my chocolate cupcakes so much,

784
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:35,123
I'll make you a bunch for your trip home
when this big battle thing is over.

785
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,656
I will not be going home.

786
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,667
My destiny is to perish during the battle.

787
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,137
What? No! Why?

788
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:48,002
It is how it has to be.
I must sacrifice myself to save you.

789
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,378
It has been this way
for over 1,000 years.

790
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,510
Well, that's a little harsh.

791
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,475
It's all right.

792
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:00,352
I got to be a real teenager
for a little while.

793
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:06,524
Well, maybe we should make it last
a little longer.

794
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,934
- So, what do you think?
- Oh, this is nothing.

795
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:22,739
You should see the parties
back at the temple.

796
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,507
- Really?
- No.

797
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,980
Hey, Wen, guess what?
I'm gonna vote for you.

798
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,281
Thanks.

799
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,954
- Hi, Shen.
- Hi. You know my name?

800
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,050
- You wanna dance?
- Oh, we're kind of together.

801
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,359
I thought he was your cousin.

802
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:42,998
Oh, yeah.

803
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,095
Go ahead. Have fun.

804
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,897
<i>Can't wait for the weekend</i>

805
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,665
Come on. Come on.

806
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,837
<i>Plus it's a long weekend</i>

807
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,068
<i>Get to stay out late tonight</i>

808
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:57,102
<i>Hangin' or shoppin'</i>
<i>I never get enough</i>

809
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,438
Don't worry about the moves.
Come on, be yourself.

810
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:01,711
Be myself?

811
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:04,015
Yeah, you know, do your own thing.

812
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,947
- That's it.
- What's up, Alvin?

813
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,251
<i>I just wanna have some fun</i>

814
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,791
<i>I'm talking about hangin' out</i>
<i>at the mall</i>

815
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:10,917
- Hi.
- Where have you been?

816
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,622
I thought we were gonna show up early
and do some campaigning.

817
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:17,564
And didn't I tell you to wear
the peach-colored shirt?

818
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,557
It goes great with this shirt.

819
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:21,627
Sorry, I've just been busy lately.

820
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:22,830
Busy?

821
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,575
- I thought we wanted to win this thing.
- I do.

822
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,804
I just need to spend some time
with Shen right now.

823
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,142
<i>Lean back and swirl it, baby</i>

824
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,512
Well, I'm your boyfriend, not him.

825
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,675
Boyfriend?

826
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,218
<i>We just wanna have some fun</i>

827
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,221
Austin, hasn't this just been

828
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,318
an illusion of the heart?

829
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,087
What does that mean?

830
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,754
You know, I don't know you anymore.

831
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,559
Austin, you never did.

832
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,121
<i>We just wanna have some fun</i>

833
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,364
Look, you and I really don't need
each other to win homecoming.

834
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:55,961
<i>We just wanna have some fun</i>

835
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,700
<i>I'm talking about hangin' out</i>

836
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:59,901
Are you breaking up with me?

837
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,274
<i>Some fun, some fun</i>

838
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:05,439
<i>Some, some, some fun</i>

839
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:06,777
I guess I am.

840
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,418
- I know that move. I can do it.
- Sure you can.

841
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:53,826
I can.

842
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,660
Yeah! Yeah!

843
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,130
All right, Shen!

844
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,354
Hey, Tory.

845
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:30,229
Look, I know you think I'm crying.
I'm not, okay?

846
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,199
I've just got a lot going on right now.

847
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:38,104
Yao Ming? Don't know him.
Which temple is he from?

848
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:44,137
Before Shen came, all that mattered
was becoming Homecoming Queen,

849
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,607
but it's all different now.

850
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:50,218
I know. I know.
I sound like a spoiled brat.

851
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,484
But you're one of my best friends

852
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:56,184
and we can talk about anything, right?

853
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,501
What kind of a chip is this?

854
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:07,729
Wendy!

855
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,698
- Where's Wendy?
- Oh, she's by the pool.

856
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,471
Wendy!

857
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:36,429
Dude, this is the biggest hot tub
I've ever seen.

858
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:42,262
This might be a good time
to finish my training.

859
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,805
You think so?

860
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,779
Tory, what are you doing?
You're wearing my shoes.

861
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:53,645
Austin, pull her out!

862
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,508
This will be great in the yearbook.

863
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,488
Austin, will you
get me out of the pool?

864
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,809
Oh, cool. Are those souvenirs?

865
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,404
You begin the final step to your training

866
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:27,312
and these are your teachers.

867
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,650
The tiger for aggression,

868
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,716
the snake for flexibility,

869
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,254
the leopard for speed,

870
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:38,124
the crane for balance,

871
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:42,663
and the dragon for invincibility.

872
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,723
Wait. Where's the dragon?

873
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:54,840
Okay.

874
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:58,074
But you do know these guys
are just little statues, right?

875
01:01:58,147 --> 01:01:59,910
We'll start with the snake.

876
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,871
Wendy, meet the first master
who will prepare you.

877
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,136
Hi.

878
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:35,014
- What's he doing?
- Showing you respect.

879
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,642
Why? He doesn't know me.

880
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,415
He has known you for over 1,000 years.

881
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,848
- Hold on. This isn't gonna work.
- Yes, it will.

882
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,719
You are stronger than you think.

883
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:48,354
No, not that.

884
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,264
Look, I can't be seen fighting
some old guy in a park.

885
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:54,201
It looks bizarre.
I have to live in this town.

886
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,931
Oh, really?

887
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,433
Besides, it won't feel right fighting him.
He didn't do anything to me.

888
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,722
What's up with this?

889
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:37,508
Coach Gibbs? Shen, what's going on?

890
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:41,179
Yan Lo is not the only one
who can possess mortals.

891
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:44,719
You didn't want to be trained
by my teachers.

892
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:47,648
How about your teachers?

893
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:50,651
Okay.

894
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:53,455
This could be fun.

895
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,371
No way.

896
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,243
Don't let your body be a cage.

897
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,749
Be as fluid as a snake.

898
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,515
I'm trying, Coach. I mean, monk.

899
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:26,424
We must try less conventional methods
with this one.

900
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,766
You want me to climb that? Forget it.

901
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:34,729
Okay.

902
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,264
We just thought
you might want your phone back.

903
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:43,737
Fine.

904
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:48,112
Be as flexible as a snake.

905
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,963
What's this?

906
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:26,348
They're coming at me too fast.

907
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,083
Speed is relative.

908
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:31,121
Slow them down with your mind.

909
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,222
Hey, who's littering my hallway?

910
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,549
You call that balance?

911
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,002
Don't forget to read Chapter 8.

912
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,764
Are these tiki torches? Cool.

913
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:19,300
Let me call my friends.
We'll have a luau.

914
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,164
Ow!

915
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:23,535
Time for your final lesson,
the aggression of a tiger.

916
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:17,356
Put everything you've learned into one.

917
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,086
Don't think about it. Feel it.

918
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,494
I felt it.

919
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:31,660
Now you have become a Yin warrior.

920
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,263
I think you guys need this.

921
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,238
Come on, Shen. Let's celebrate
with your first cappuccino.

922
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:44,276
I don't know what that is
but I hope it's chocolate.

923
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:51,850
I just hope
when the monks leave their bodies

924
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,515
my teachers won't remember anything
and hold it against me.

925
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,615
Don't worry, they won't.

926
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:59,324
I don't think. Well, they might.

927
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:02,455
You.

928
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:06,726
Hello.

929
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,399
- Lisa? What's wrong?
- You won!

930
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,268
- What?
- You're Homecoming Queen!

931
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,902
- No way. Swear on the life of your cat.
- Tell her, Tory.

932
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,709
It's true. You won.

933
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:21,309
I won?

934
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:25,248
Okay, okay, I'll talk to you guys later.

935
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,751
Is everything okay?

936
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:30,324
Lisa's on
the homecoming committee

937
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,656
and they just finished
counting the votes.

938
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,821
You are now walking
with the new Homecoming Queen.

939
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,058
- You are so lucky.
- Yes, I am.

940
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,724
Congratulations.

941
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,203
Well, you know, it's all because of you.

942
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,738
If you hadn't helped me
with my history class...

943
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:47,102
Hey, I've got an idea.

944
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:52,075
- Why don't you be my date?
- Be your what?

945
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:55,579
Date. It means you take me
to the homecoming dance.

946
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,687
- Sorry, but I can't go.
- Why not?

947
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:02,148
Oh, come on.

948
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:05,250
It's already bad enough
I have to ask a guy for a date.

949
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,227
You're not gonna make me beg,
are you?

950
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:08,456
You know what?

951
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:12,261
I'm definitely gonna miss
chocolate cupcakes and this, too.

952
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,126
What do you mean, miss?
Where are you...

953
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:17,902
Oh, yeah.

954
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:23,434
So when is this big battle thing
on your Chinese calendar again?

955
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,074
The autumn moon.

956
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:28,514
I know. I know. You said that.
Next week? Next month?

957
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,309
Like, a few days.

958
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:32,852
A few days?

959
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,090
- How many days?
- A couple.

960
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:37,518
Shen!

961
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,722
Tomorrow?

962
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,453
It's tomorrow?

963
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:45,329
Please tell me
it's not during homecoming.

964
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:49,335
- I'm gonna go get another one of these.
- Get back here.

965
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:50,770
You knew the whole time

966
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:53,672
that it was gonna happen
during homecoming, didn't you?

967
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:58,346
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was afraid you wouldn't train.

968
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,207
So you lied to me instead.

969
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,717
- Monks don't lie.
- No.

970
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,218
They just don't tell the truth.

971
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:11,322
Well, is there anything else
you're hiding from me?

972
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:48,356
Your Lord of Darkness
commands you to awaken!

973
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,290
Must be indigestion.

974
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,133
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

975
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:34,799
Yan Lo! Yan Lo!
Yan Lo! Yan Lo! Yan Lo!

976
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:40,144
Yan Lo! Yan Lo! Yan Lo!
Yan Lo! Yan Lo!

977
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:45,744
Yan Lo! Yan Lo! Yan Lo!
Yan Lo! Yan Lo!

978
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:51,054
Yan Lo! Yan Lo! Yan Lo!
Yan Lo! Yan Lo!

979
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:56,621
Yan Lo! Yan Lo! Yan Lo!
Yan Lo! Yan Lo!

980
01:13:56,698 --> 01:14:03,103
Yan Lo! Yan Lo! Yan Lo!
Yan Lo! Yan Lo! Yan Lo!

981
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:08,175
I found this for your battle.

982
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:10,043
It was my mother's.

983
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,105
Why are you wearing that?

984
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,515
I'm going to homecoming.

985
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,347
I won.

986
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,348
I see.

987
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,625
Grandma, I'm sorry if you're mad at me

988
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:30,160
but being a Homecoming Queen
is all I ever wanted.

989
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:33,326
Nobody asked me
if I wanted to be a Yin warrior.

990
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:35,225
You know what?

991
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,100
I don't.

992
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:43,108
I'm not angry with you.

993
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:46,147
You're my granddaughter
no matter what you do.

994
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,110
And I've never questioned your choices.

995
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:03,220
I hate it when she does that to me.

996
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:05,493
Well, it's not gonna work.

997
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:09,795
Battle evil
on the most important day of my life?

998
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,134
Get real.

999
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,237
So what if evil takes over?

1000
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,368
The world's already evil.

1001
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,981
It's my crown
and I'm gonna wear it tonight.

1002
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:23,741
Evil can wait.

1003
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:26,814
Alone?

1004
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,284
Your Yin warrior has betrayed you.

1005
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:36,654
I may be alone
but I have the will of many.

1006
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:44,462
Hope it's enough to beat these guys.

1007
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,486
Come on, Daddy, I'm gonna be late.

1008
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:34,078
Just a couple more.

1009
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:36,954
It's not every day
you're in the presence of a queen.

1010
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:39,516
Oh, you've taken enough pictures.
Mom, tell him.

1011
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,358
Oh, she's right.

1012
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,523
Here. Here.
Take some with the video camera.

1013
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:44,623
Oh, yeah.

1014
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:47,233
Oh, that's Tory. Gotta go.

1015
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:49,770
Oh, and remember,
they're gonna crown me at halftime

1016
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,100
- so don't be late.
Bye.

1017
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,231
Bye.

1018
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:57,403
Uh-oh.

1019
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,139
Are we still monks or teachers here?

1020
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,644
Monks.

1021
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:16,590
Your hour of destiny has arrived.

1022
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:20,931
Look, guys, I really appreciate
all the cool kung fu training and stuff.

1023
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:24,837
I mean, I'm sure it'll come in handy
with soccer, or if I join the circus,

1024
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:27,340
but I have my own appointment
with destiny.

1025
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:28,433
Oh.

1026
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,477
And... And tell Shen I'm sorry.

1027
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,413
Maybe next time.

1028
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:35,875
There won't be a next time.

1029
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:38,448
He's gone to battle.

1030
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:41,347
Alone?

1031
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:19,422
The time for evil has finally come!

1032
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:22,622
Stop!

1033
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:27,066
Evil must face the force of the leopard.

1034
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:28,733
The snake.

1035
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:30,368
The crane.

1036
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,471
The tiger.

1037
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:35,872
And the Yin warrior.

1038
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:40,876
Jessica?

1039
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:45,844
Why didn't you guys tell me it was her?
I would have been here yesterday.

1040
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,947
About 10 minutes ago
would have been nice, too.

1041
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:50,457
Move, you big idiots!

1042
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:06,771
Shen, are you all right?

1043
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:10,175
Not too crazy about the pain
but I'll be okay.

1044
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:13,237
Witness, Yin warrior,

1045
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:16,045
the darkness of a new day.

1046
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,911
- That doesn't sound like Jessica.
- It's Yan Lo.

1047
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:25,250
I knew this weak Yin warrior
would come to the aid of her monk.

1048
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:26,791
Well, yeah.

1049
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:30,923
- And to save the world.
- Right. And to save the world.

1050
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,561
Attack!

1051
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,480
Maybe you guys wanna jump in now?

1052
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,778
Grandma?

1053
01:20:57,586 --> 01:20:59,076
What are you doing here?

1054
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:01,782
I knew you would make the right choice.

1055
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:04,482
Put on your great-grandmother's robe

1056
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,555
and save the world.

1057
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,219
Where am I?

1058
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:50,618
- Wendy?
- Hey, Jessica.

1059
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:53,183
You're kind of at the museum.

1060
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:55,354
- Why?
I don't know.

1061
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,126
You're supposed to be at homecoming.
You're late.

1062
01:23:58,199 --> 01:23:59,291
I am?

1063
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:01,094
I mean,

1064
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:04,036
I thought
everyone already voted you queen.

1065
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:06,400
I've been thinking lately.

1066
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:12,471
And there are other things that are
more important to me right now.

1067
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:15,708
You better hurry
if you're gonna get that crown.

1068
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:16,976
Yeah.

1069
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:22,984
Thanks.

1070
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:35,298
I am so proud of you.

1071
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:37,065
Oh, Grandma.

1072
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:41,465
Let's go home. Mooncakes on me.

1073
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:49,545
I don't think this is over yet.

1074
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:52,347
I was wondering
why I survived this time.

1075
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,648
Shen, any advice here?

1076
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,709
I don't know.

1077
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:28,347
This is first time
Yan Lo has shown up in person.

1078
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,288
Okay, that's not gonna help me.

1079
01:25:56,885 --> 01:25:58,250
Let him go!

1080
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:01,922
It's destiny.

1081
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,052
You must let me go.

1082
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:08,223
No! Grandma, I'm losing Shen.
What do I do?

1083
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:10,423
Everything you have learned!

1084
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:12,998
Let him go!

1085
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:45,632
Shen! Shen!

1086
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:50,670
At last,
the days of doom become destiny.

1087
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:53,263
No, I won't let Shen die.

1088
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:55,104
This is not destiny.

1089
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:11,582
- I'm alive?
- You're alive.

1090
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:01,807
- You changed the destiny.
- I know.

1091
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:05,546
- Are you mad?
- No, but the monks might be.

1092
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:10,377
Yan Lo has been destroyed forever.

1093
01:28:11,052 --> 01:28:13,577
The legend is over.

1094
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:14,779
How?

1095
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:19,155
By something mightier than anything
we could ever teach a Yin warrior,

1096
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:22,489
true sacrifice for the world

1097
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:25,321
and a friend.

1098
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:29,997
Our purpose is finished as well.

1099
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:33,131
- What about me?
- This will be your last life.

1100
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:35,575
Live it well.

1101
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:37,076
He can stay?

1102
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:39,544
I can stay?

1103
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:54,758
Hey, you two, break it up.

1104
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:57,691
Where are we?

1105
01:28:57,765 --> 01:29:01,360
We're all on the way to my place
for mooncakes.

1106
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:04,636
You're all invited. Come along, now.

1107
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:17,016
You know,
I really hate those mooncakes.

1108
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:19,679
I've been eating them for 1,000 years.

1109
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:22,355
Let's get a cappuccino.

1110
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:25,386
Let's go this way.
