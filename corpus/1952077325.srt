00:00:37,897 -> 00:00:39,319

12 
00:02:59,224 -> 00:03:00,912 
Sorry about the test, pa. 

13 
00:03:02,325 -> 00:03:04,629 
Everyone has something, honey. 

14 
00:03:05,309 -> 00:03:11,147 
And mine is called diabetes. 
- So you always have sugar in you. 

15 
00:03:12,225 -> 00:03:13,946 
Take your cake yet? 

16 
00:03:15,728 -> 00:03:17,447 
Not tonight, Mon. 

17 
00:03:18,009 -> 00:03:21,599 
I kidding. 
Of course, I take a piece of cake. 

18 
00:03:23,357 -> 00:03:25,005 
You. 

19 
00:03:25,749 -> 00:03:28,969 
I meant now, Mom. 
Get the cake on. 

20 
00:03:29,627 -> 00:03:30,799 
Well. 

21 
00:03:30,811 -> 00:03:34,419 
You started it and now remains 
in my head, haunting. 

22 
00:03:35,495 -> 00:03:39,021 
I do not get out. 
Pie. There he is. 

23 
00:03:40,191 -> 00:03:43,500 
It helps me to forget. 
And you know ... 

24 
00:03:43,503 -> 00:03:48,792 
Not always but sometimes you need a 
child to respond, and simply say, "Come and '. 

25 
00:03:48,793 -> 00:03:52,157 
Children do not talk like that. 
- Some do. The older. Okay? 

26 
00:03:52,158 -> 00:03:53,428 
I hear them in the mall. 

27 
00:03:56,287 -> 00:03:57,551 
Peanut butter ... 

28 
00:03:58,792 -> 00:04:01,128 
It fills the cracks in my heart. 

29 
00:04:03,435 -> 00:04:05,703 
Get out of pain. 

30 
00:04:09,862 -> 00:04:10,870 
What? 

31 
00:04:11,159 -> 00:04:15,944 
Pauly. 
- Come on, Mom. I am not ready. 

32 
00:04:15,945 -> 00:04:16,984 
Dad. 
- Please. 

33 
00:04:17,195 -> 00:04:21,312 
We do not want you 
a holiday alone. 

34 
00:04:21,313 -> 00:04:24,521 
But I am not alone. 
I have two of you anyway. 

35 
00:04:24,690 -> 00:04:29,655 
Black Friday is coming, 
so my dance card is full of will best. 

36 
00:04:30,360 -> 00:04:33,334 
What? It is the 
busiest day of the year. 

37 
00:04:33,381 -> 00:04:35,776 
I should not explain 
to citizens. 

38 
00:04:35,777 -> 00:04:39,338 
I wish I had a colleague here. Hey Tyler, 
you know that black Friday comes back? 

39 
00:04:39,339 -> 00:04:42,625 
That you do not tell me, 
why do you think I hawk eyes rondloop? 

40 
00:04:42,818 -> 00:04:43,823 
We are prepared. 

41 
00:04:43,824 -> 00:04:47,808 
Dad, what has that got to do 
that the rest of your life will be happy? 

42 
00:04:48,048 -> 00:04:52,545 
You said and I quote: "If I do not 
girlfriend voted for November, 

43 
00:04:52,832 -> 00:04:55,487 
you may register me 
by Perfect Match. com. 

44 
00:04:57,232 -> 00:04:59,432 
That was last year. 

45 
00:05:05,543 -> 00:05:06,815 
Ok. 

46 
00:05:08,008 -> 00:05:12,032 
Here. 
- Okay, what are you looking for in a woman? 

47 
00:05:13,312 -> 00:05:16,560 
Well, your mother had something special. 

48 
00:05:18,753 -> 00:05:20,839 
Yes, it was illegal. 

49 
00:05:20,840 -> 00:05:23,725 
She married you, when was 
they are here legally, and when they left us. 

50 
00:05:23,726 -> 00:05:25,444 
That is not entirely true. 

51 
00:05:25,720 -> 00:05:29,774 
We also had good times, 
me when they tried to spawn. 

52 
00:05:29,775 -> 00:05:31,866 
Well, I hate her. 
- That you would not have to do. 

53 
00:05:31,867 -> 00:05:34,212 
Through her I have you. 

54 
00:05:35,303 -> 00:05:38,400 
I'm pretty awesome. 
- That's right. 

55 
00:05:38,418 -> 00:05:41,456 
Okay, next question. 
Tell me about yourself. 

56 
00:05:42,184 -> 00:05:47,152 
Just think. I know a lot about sharks. 
- Can I interrupt you immediately. 

57 
00:05:48,917 -> 00:05:55,561 
Well ... game and a great knuffelaar. 
- Great, Grandma. 

58 
00:05:56,022 -> 00:05:57,472 
But not so great as this. 

59 
00:05:58,344 -> 00:06:04,026 
What are you doing now? Pimp your profile, with that nice 
video you a few years ago have made. 

60 
00:06:04,027 -> 00:06:05,756 
Mom, please. 

61 
00:06:23,259 -> 00:06:26,775 
I do not know. 
Is not it a bit: Hey check me out. 

62 
00:06:27,126 -> 00:06:31,085 
That is exactly what we want. 
That is the price for it. 

63 
00:06:31,525 -> 00:06:35,023 
And you do not worry, 
I will edit out the sweaty parts. 

64 
00:07:02,425 -> 00:07:03,565 
Dear God. 

65 
00:07:08,153 -> 00:07:09,688 
Get away from the vehicle. 

66 
00:07:10,040 -> 00:07:11,660 
Dear God, please. 

67 
00:07:12,226 -> 00:07:13,722 
Go away. 

68 
00:07:35,475 -> 00:07:37,472 
Do you know where the men are? 
- I know. 

69 
00:07:37,473 -> 00:07:41,503 
You must Larence Pell, who 
twelve heated toilets. 

70 
00:07:44,468 -> 00:07:47,592 
Keep the balls in the bucket, kids. 
Children ... 

71 
00:07:49,020 -> 00:07:50,424 
Okay, now my lip is paralyzed. 

72 
00:07:56,388 -> 00:07:57,600 
Well. 

73 
00:08:00,105 -> 00:08:01,447 
Please. 

74 
00:08:02,516 -> 00:08:03,968 
Thank you. 

75 
00:08:40,001 -> 00:08:43,335 
As if he should stand. 
This MPV. 

76 
00:09:13,555 -> 00:09:16,714 
Paul. 
- Hey. What is this? 

77 
00:09:16,809 -> 00:09:19,040 
That is my report on 
how the traffic problem ... 

78 
00:09:19,041 -> 00:09:21,041 
to tackle 
at Macy's and gift shops. 

79 
00:09:21,050 -> 00:09:24,026 
How do you do? 
- It is for us all. 

80 
00:09:24,202 -> 00:09:26,743 
If the customers can 
bypass road to the eetkraampjes ... 

81 
00:09:26,744 -> 00:09:29,518 
prevents chaos 
and frustration among customers. 

82 
00:09:29,519 -> 00:09:32,666 
It is the classic example 
of "two birds with one stone". 

83 
00:09:34,516 -> 00:09:36,924 
Can I ask you something? 
- Question tap. 

84 
00:09:36,925 -> 00:09:40,596 
Why can not you just inklokken, quiet 
uitklokken and again, like we all do? 

85 
00:09:42,326 -> 00:09:43,837 
Security is never on vacation. 

86 
00:09:44,098 -> 00:09:47,640 
Did your mother embroidered on a pillow? 
- Blart ... 

87 
00:09:49,318 -> 00:09:52,774 
This is your new Sims trainee. 
Let him follow today. 

88 
00:09:53,126 -> 00:09:55,523 
Hello Paul Blart, a ten-year veteran. 

89 
00:09:55,965 -> 00:09:58,661 
Veck Sims.

Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show. 
Let's go. 

91 
00:10:05,085 -> 00:10:07,233 
Oh yeah, that's the good stuff. 

92 
00:10:12,532 -> 00:10:14,643 
Treat her sweet son. 

93 
00:10:16,388 -> 00:10:18,508 
Tap and honor it. 

94 
00:10:18,509 -> 00:10:20,000 
DETECTION DETERRENT REVIEW REPORT 

95 
00:10:20,061 -> 00:10:22,748 
Why choose security? 

96 
00:10:29,079 -> 00:10:31,556 
I have not finished my school, 
and this was all I could get. 

97 
00:10:31,580 -> 00:10:34,298 
I'm trying to go to the police. 

98 
00:10:34,299 -> 00:10:37,941 
I'm going to try for the eighth time. 
Diabetes. 

99 
00:10:44,000 -> 00:10:45,689 
Confusing is not it? 

100 
00:10:45,780 -> 00:10:49,512 
Do take it easy. My first week here, 
I got lost at Sears ... 

101 
00:10:49,513 -> 00:10:52,981 
they found me later in fetal position, 
with a full beard. 

102 
00:10:53,521 -> 00:10:55,316 
I kidding. 
I can not grow beard. 

103 
00:10:55,317 -> 00:10:57,291 
My uncle did. 
Stay close to me! 

104 
00:10:57,779 -> 00:11:02,489 
If you are a criminal, it will 
I want you should do ... 

105 
00:11:02,490 -> 00:11:03,685 
You must approach him ... 

106 
00:11:03,963 -> 00:11:08,779 
your left hip forward, you put 
your right hand on your left hand turned. 

107 
00:11:08,800 -> 00:11:12,127 
You give the illusiedat you have a weapon. 
But we both know ... 

108 
00:11:12,991 -> 00:11:14,415 
that you do not have. 

109 
00:11:15,847 -> 00:11:17,337 
But you know what we have? 

110 
00:11:18,001 -> 00:11:20,411 
Our voice! 
We have a voice. 

111 
00:11:21,083 -> 00:11:23,418 
One thing you must remember today ... 

112 
00:11:23,653 -> 00:11:28,789 
your mind is the only weapon 
that no holster needed. 

113 
00:11:29,413 -> 00:11:31,781 
Okay, great. 
How long do you get for lunch? 

114 
00:11:31,782 -> 00:11:33,231 
A half-hour. 
But I will eat in 20 minutes ... 

115 
00:11:33,232 -> 00:11:35,032 
which I still have five minutes 
social things. 

116 
00:11:35,110 -> 00:11:37,297 
Five minutes to return focus to be. 

117 
00:11:45,015 -> 00:11:46,625 
We have a wegpiraat. 

118 
00:11:51,497 -> 00:11:55,950 
Sir, would you even go to the right. 
Go to the side, sir, away from traffic. 

119 
00:11:56,103 -> 00:11:59,534 
Brown jacket, red scooter, 
Please go to the right from the traffic. 

120 
00:12:00,176 -> 00:12:01,832 
Sir. 

121 
00:12:04,298 -> 00:12:05,778 
Thank you. 

122 
00:12:18,371 -> 00:12:21,796 
You drove very recklessly, sir. 
- You kidding? 

123 
00:12:22,336 -> 00:12:24,743 
I do not like jokes 
about safety. 

124 
00:12:25,319 -> 00:12:29,120 
I am afraid I must give you a voucher. 
I have your first and last name needed ... 

125 
00:12:29,155 -> 00:12:30,370 
Surname first. 

126 
00:12:30,906 -> 00:12:32,882 
Sir! 

127 
00:12:34,022 -> 00:12:37,302 
Do not make it harder than necessary. 
- Idiot. 

128 
00:12:37,416 -> 00:12:40,148 
Mr. 
Sir, I warn you 

129 
00:12:44,148 -> 00:12:45,741

Sir, I warn you 
Sir. 

131 
00:12:49,868 -> 00:12:52,120

Ok,

00:12:59,674 -> 00:13:02,852 
It is well, sir. 
He comes back. 

134

Is there something else?

Yes, was looking for its many went. 

139

I was looking for more volume.

Do your men ...

Are you .. 

142

Are you the guy who oppose 
the MPV aanbotste? 

143 
00:14:09,568 -> 00:14:12,932 
I do not think so, which ones?

00:14:12,933 -> 00:14:14,664 
There is.

Yes, yes. That was me.

Yes, although a doctor 
thick check had. - Yes. 

147 
00:14:24,501 -> 00:14:25,824 
You know what you should do? 

148 
00:14:25,859 -> 00:14:30,658 
You would have to send the surveillance tape to 
such a program where everyone everywhere aanbotst. 

149 
00:14:30,659 -> 00:14:33,588 
Hello, early.

Agent Blart from sector five. 

154 
00:14:55,311 -> 00:14:57,599 
Why do you me so hard? 

155 
00:14:59,284 -> 00:15:02,170 
I just logged on. 
- What an idiot. 

156 
00:15:02,823 -> 00:15:04,915 
I mention me again later. 
It is quite busy. 

157 
00:15:04,916 -> 00:15:07,695 
Sure. The life of a securer.

What is it? - You said securer, 
and I can best live with but ... 

159

Sorry if I've called you wrong. 
- No, that's pretty good. 

160 
00:15:18,303 -> 00:15:22,013 
There is a huge controversy 
in industry under way at the moment ... 

161 
00:15:22,014 -> 00:15:25,728 
whether securer or guardian should be called. 
You will probably have inherited something of. 

162 
00:15:26,480 -> 00:15:29,166 
No, not yet. 
- That comes later. 

163 
00:15:29,167 -> 00:15:31,898 
Fixed it. 
- It is in the air. 

164 
00:15:33,359 -> 00:15:36,355 
Are you ready for 
the busiest day of the year? 

165 
00:15:37,126 -> 00:15:42,183 
Yes, is true. And the worst day 
year to be on black Friday comes. 

166 
00:15:42,184 -> 00:15:46,041 
Which means that I probably no maps 
will be because everyone is busy shopping. 

167 
00:15:47,554 -> 00:15:50,040 
You know, brown ... 
- Yes. 

168 
00:15:50,041 -> 00:15:52,708 
that is your color. This will be. 
- This is the winner. 

169 
00:15:54,310 -> 00:15:58,449 
That is $ 9.95. 
- $ 9.95? - Yes. 

170 
00:15:59,007 -> 00:16:01,525 
With this low price, I would almost 
a ponytail think. 

171 
00:16:02,917 -> 00:16:04,743 
Thank you. 

172 
00:16:05,551 -> 00:16:06,690 
Thank you. 

173 
00:16:08,043 -> 00:16:10,810 
Well. please. 
- Okay. 

174 
00:16:10,811 -> 00:16:12,454 
Here, please. 

175 
00:16:13,262 -> 00:16:17,527 
Thank you, Amy 
- You thanks, Blart agent. 

176 
00:16:18,131 -> 00:16:23,873 
Blart Hey, what a beautiful blouse. 
You've taken a medium, eh? 

177 
00:16:24,561 -> 00:16:26,578 
It's a little tight, but ... 

178 
00:16:26,748 -> 00:16:30,265 
that is because we bulletproof vests 
to bear. - I 'm not. 

179 
00:16:30,266 -> 00:16:34,519 
No, I do not see the jacket below. 
- No, but it is a thick t-shirt. 

180 
00:16:34,520 -> 00:16:38,259 
Just like a thermoplastic jacket, that bear them. 
- No, no, no. 

181 
00:16:39,091 -> 00:16:41,562 
I do not think you live? 
I just called you fat. 

182 
00:16:41,563 -> 00:16:42,980 
I laugh too. 

183 
00:16:47,353 -> 00:16:49,009 
What you want. 
Amy ... 

184 
00:16:49,533 -> 00:16:53,235 
everyone goes to American Joey's 
tonight. I also want you to come, right? 

185 
00:16:53,236 -> 00:16:57,075 
We go eat together onion rings. 

186 
00:16:57,224 -> 00:16:58,411 
Well. 

187 
00:16:59,623 -> 00:17:00,967 
You're fat. 

188 
00:17:02,069 -> 00:17:04,859 
That is great. 

189 
00:17:04,860 -> 00:17:09,003 
Blart, they need you to Victoria Secret. 

190 
00:17:10,092 -> 00:17:11,563 
Okay, understood. 

191 
00:17:14,867 -> 00:17:18,143 
Well, I gotta go. 
- Okay. 

192 
00:17:18,344 -> 00:17:19,815 
Goodbye. 

193 
00:17:29,261 -> 00:17:31,075 
I saw it first. 
- Not true. 

194 
00:17:31,076 -> 00:17:34,953 
Ladies, there are problems? 
What is wrong? 

195 
00:17:35,054 -> 00:17:37,999 
They want the last push up bra take 
that in this measure. 

196 
00:17:38,278 -> 00:17:41,332 
They come tomorrow again, 
they will be in the afternoon. 

197 
00:17:41,333 -> 00:17:45,409 
I got him tonight for a blind date needed. 
- Really? Is he blind? 

198 
00:17:46,848 -> 00:17:50,204 
Waterproof shoes and socks. 
This is not the first time for me. 

199 
00:17:50,405 -> 00:17:54,314 
Okay, ladies I would like your ID. 
- No, that is you. 

200 
00:17:56,579 -> 00:18:00,219 
I warn you, I have the 
power to arrest you. 

201 
00:18:00,220 -> 00:18:02,548 
Like everyone, 
I would now also be arrested. 

202 
00:18:02,549 -> 00:18:06,470 
This is so that she can do. 
- I do not talk with you Good? 

203 
00:18:07,705 -> 00:18:09,981 
Can I speak to you separately, madam. 

204 
00:18:19,365 -> 00:18:20,637 
Look ... 

205 
00:18:21,530 -> 00:18:26,883 
I understand your problem, I have 
also had problems with overweight. 

206 
00:18:28,143 -> 00:18:32,924 
You called me thick? - No, only that I 
have the same experience. I mean ... 

207 
00:18:33,723 -> 00:18:37,035 
I'm still fat, just as yours 
Stranded. 

208 
00:18:37,563 -> 00:18:43,843 
Be honest, we eat our problems. 
but when I went to eat healthier ... 

209 
00:18:44,319 -> 00:18:46,529 
I was not so moody. 

210 
00:18:46,741 -> 00:18:49,725 
Plus you get a better skin. 

211 
00:18:51,029 -> 00:18:53,191 
Wil you just that. 
- Sure. 

212 
00:18:56,063 -> 00:18:57,121 
Madam ... 

213 
00:19:13,273 -> 00:19:15,333 
She has the same effect as a man. 

214 
00:19:17,645 -> 00:19:20,026 
Strengthening! 

215 
00:19:20,127 -> 00:19:22,601 
They bite in my neck. 

216 
00:19:24,480 -> 00:19:25,672 
Strengthening! 

217 
00:19:30,029 -> 00:19:32,559 
Strengthening! 

218 
00:19:36,575 -> 00:19:38,942 
Listen, I know that you are new ... 

219 
00:19:39,000 -> 00:19:42,410 
but strengthens the same. 

220 
00:20:55,339 -> 00:20:59,200 
Can I give you a lift? 
- So? 

221 
00:20:59,252 -> 00:21:02,634 
With an inexperienced driver 
I would also discourage, but to me ... 

222 
00:21:03,098 -> 00:21:04,985 
you're as safe as the president. 

223 
00:21:06,162 -> 00:21:09,410 
I do not know. 
Can you have not dismissed? 

224 
00:21:09,942 -> 00:21:11,953 
That could be. 

225 
00:21:13,776 -> 00:21:15,152 
Ok. 

226 
00:21:26,106 -> 00:21:28,723 
Is it good? 
- Absolutely. 

227 
00:22:31,210 -> 00:22:33,650 
So, please. 

228 
00:22:34,486 -> 00:22:36,136 
Safe and sound. 

229 
00:22:38,008 -> 00:22:40,520 
Oh,'56 Mustang. 
- Yes. 

230 
00:22:40,521 -> 00:22:41,836 
A nice detail for you. 

231 
00:22:41,837 -> 00:22:44,510 
Many people think that the Mustang 
the horse is named ... 

232 
00:22:44,511 -> 00:22:48,012 
but it is actually called 
to the P51 Mustang. 

233 
00:22:49,535 -> 00:22:52,724 
This is an airplane. 
- That I did not know. 

234 
00:22:54,040 -> 00:22:58,536 
Thank you for the ride, it was very nice. 
- Sure. 

235 
00:23:02,364 -> 00:23:03,642 
Listen ... 

236 
00:23:04,856 -> 00:23:07,989 
if you ever need a lift ... 

237 
00:23:08,972 -> 00:23:11,221 
you can always reach me 
through the plant. 

238 
00:23:11,222 -> 00:23:14,404 
Whether we SMS each other. 
- Yes. 

239 
00:23:14,967 -> 00:23:17,511 
Give me the number on your phone. 
- My Mobile? 

240 
00:23:17,512 -> 00:23:19,438 
Well, then I enter my number. 

241 
00:23:23,286 -> 00:23:27,578 
I got him in the box left behind. 
Give me your number, but I remember it. 

242 
00:23:27,708 -> 00:23:30,108 
Okay, you ready? 
- Yes. 

243 
00:23:30,682 -> 00:23:32,609 
555 ... 
- Wait, I ... 

244 
00:23:33,314 -> 00:23:34,419 
I am ready. 

245 
00:23:34,420 -> 00:23:40,250 
555 ... 0178. 
- Roger, I have saved. 

246 
00:23:40,287 -> 00:23:42,936 
I see you tonight at 
American Joey's, okay? 

247 
00:23:44,178 -> 00:23:48,054 
Sure, everyone does. 
So why should not I go? 

248 
00:23:48,055 -> 00:23:49,852 
I will be there. 

249 
00:23:50,852 -> 00:23:52,482 
Goodbye. 
- Bye. 

250 
00:24:57,168 -> 00:24:59,028 
Hi. 
- Hi, glad you came. 

251 
00:24:59,029 -> 00:25:00,181 
Fine place to be. 

252 
00:25:01,213 -> 00:25:04,476 
A nice detail for you ... 
- This is nothing, will we go? 

253 
00:25:05,248 -> 00:25:09,678 
No, sorry what were you going to tell? 
- I wanted to say ... 

254 
00:25:09,679 -> 00:25:14,198 
Joey was the first American Open in 1972. 

255 
00:25:14,199 -> 00:25:17,973 
And most people think, 
that their service and issues ... 

256 
00:25:17,974 -> 00:25:20,958 
it stems from Abe and Louis, 
but that is not true. 

257 
00:25:22,038 -> 00:25:24,247 
It is a bar in itself. 

258 
00:25:25,055 -> 00:25:27,662 
You know a lot of details, Paul. 

259 
00:25:27,950 -> 00:25:31,479 
Blart, I heard your ass was beaten 
by a thick chick in Victoria Secret. 

260 
00:25:32,166 -> 00:25:36,070 
Well, I save no women, so ... 
- Is only MPV's, huh? 

261 
00:25:38,687 -> 00:25:42,775 
You go to the bar, 
and get yourself a woman drink. 

262 
00:25:43,061 -> 00:25:44,214 
I do so. 

263 
00:25:44,740 -> 00:25:49,325 
Okay, someone else has something to drink, 
because Stewart treats? - No, they are provided. 

264 
00:25:49,326 -> 00:25:52,684 
They do not. 
- Okay. 

265 
00:25:56,526 -> 00:26:00,854 
Listen, we are almost 
all together, so ... 

266 
00:26:01,350 -> 00:26:03,933 
I did nothing ... I knew not ... 
- Yes. 

267 
00:26:03,934 -> 00:26:07,047 
I did nothing wrong. 
- I just want you in hand. 

268 
00:26:07,248 -> 00:26:12,742 
I mean, you had no real chance. Good? 
I mean, a guard, come on. 

269 
00:26:13,566 -> 00:26:18,851 
You sell pens, right? - Yes, and I 
I just purchased a Cameron, so kiss me. 

270 
00:26:19,838 -> 00:26:23,919 
Relax friend, we are here for fun. 
- Well, my friend. 

271 
00:26:27,058 -> 00:26:28,221 
What? 

272 
00:26:31,062 -> 00:26:33,999 
Thank you that you wanted me 
protect friend. 

273 
00:26:34,000 -> 00:26:36,640 
Guards Blood flows through you ... 
Indeed let us go. 

274 
00:26:40,496 -> 00:26:43,387 
Both ready? 
- No. 

275 
00:26:43,838 -> 00:26:47,798 
Yes, now I am ready. 
- And ... off! 

276 
00:26:52,432 -> 00:26:55,120 
Leon, your behind, 
So you should just chew. 

277 
00:26:56,972 -> 00:27:00,406 
This is nice man. 

278 
00:27:01,734 -> 00:27:03,951 
These peppers are hot. 

279 
00:27:06,894 -> 00:27:10,582 
My God. 
- Man, this is good. 

280 
00:27:17,000 -> 00:27:18,737 
You behind. 

281 
00:27:19,423 -> 00:27:21,446 
Come on, Paul. 

282 
00:27:24,061 -> 00:27:26,343 
I love this nacho's, 
that's for sure. 

283 
00:27:29,043 -> 00:27:32,584 
This is strong stuff. 
- Yes Paul, that is because it is a Margarita. 

284 
00:27:32,585 -> 00:27:35,050 
No, I drink. 

285 
00:28:08,423 -> 00:28:13,009 
Rotated. 
I feel button. 

286 
00:28:14,376 -> 00:28:16,156 
Hey, you want one? 
- Yes. 

287 
00:28:36,052 -> 00:28:38,420 
You blink. 
You geknipperd. 

288 
00:28:40,030 -> 00:28:43,174 
It is time to start harvesting. 

289 
00:28:44,630 -> 00:28:49,231 
<i> I have the bags yet ...</ i> 

290 
00:28:50,791 -> 00:28:52,367 
I must go to the bathroom. 

291 
00:28:55,086 -> 00:28:57,110 
False alarm. 

292 
00:29:03,913 -> 00:29:06,082 
I told ma about. 

293 
00:29:06,866 -> 00:29:09,035 
What are you talking about? 

294 
00:29:11,334 -> 00:29:14,924 
Do not like. 
Just nice normal ... 

295 
00:29:15,288 -> 00:29:16,858 
You know ... 

296 
00:29:17,666 -> 00:29:20,780 
Excuse me, Paul. 
I do not know what you mean. 

297 
00:29:21,924 -> 00:29:25,941 
I'm bitten by a weasel. 

298 
00:29:28,172 -> 00:29:30,868 
So happy! 

299 
00:30:02,268 -> 00:30:05,053 
I live the magic! 

300 
00:30:12,036 -> 00:30:14,841 
THANKSGIVING DAY 

301 
00:30:15,048 -> 00:30:17,818 
Excuse me, that 
nothing has become dear. 

302 
00:30:19,170 -> 00:30:20,412 
It's good, ma. 

303 
00:30:20,413 -> 00:30:23,434 
Hey Dad, let's go look 
whether they are reactions? - Yes. 

304 
00:30:23,535 -> 00:30:26,752 
I do not think so, sweetheart. 
I go there early. 

305 
00:30:28,976 -> 00:30:33,081 
Do you want something special for the 
lunch tomorrow, so you will be happy. 

306 
00:30:33,736 -> 00:30:37,161 
Thank your mom, it's all right. 

307 
00:30:43,005 -> 00:30:47,586 
If you have something to work, 
than Slopy Joey. But that would ... 

308 
00:30:47,587 -> 00:30:49,220 
you know. 

309 
00:30:52,228 -> 00:30:57,174 
If you make Slopy Joe, make it 
than sweet potatoes. 

310 
00:31:44,973 -> 00:31:47,199 
FIND YOUR PERFECT PARTNER ... 

311 
00:31:50,500 -> 00:31:52,372 
THERE ARE NO PARTNERS FOUND 

312 
00:32:06,221 -> 00:32:08,081 
THANKS AMY 

313 
00:32:31,429 -> 00:32:33,646 
Hi. 

314 
00:32:34,710 -> 00:32:38,205 
Dad, I am so sorry. 

315 
00:32:41,042 -> 00:32:42,651 
It is all right. 

316 
00:32:43,659 -> 00:32:48,402 
There are more you know. 
You just keep looking. 

317 
00:32:48,970 -> 00:32:50,917 
It does not matter what you do ... 

318 
00:32:51,150 -> 00:32:54,881 
because if someone is the time 
want to take you really get to know ... 

319 
00:32:55,189 -> 00:32:57,066 
it is our bet over. 

320 
00:33:02,550 -> 00:33:05,874 
If nothing is 
then you have us still. 

321 
00:33:07,266 -> 00:33:10,817 
Excuse me, sweetheart. I had my ears closed, 
I did not mean what you said. 

322 
00:33:11,868 -> 00:33:13,290 
You have just achieved ... 

323 
00:33:13,675 -> 00:33:16,027 
Is that a tattoo? 

324 
00:33:17,707 -> 00:33:22,235 
I ... Yes. 
- Since when did you do? 

325 
00:33:22,920 -> 00:33:25,887 
Since yesterday evening. 
- What is it? 

326 
00:33:27,140 -> 00:33:29,292 
The monster of Loch Ness. 

327 
00:33:29,459 -> 00:33:31,659 
I drink. 

328 
00:33:39,663 -> 00:33:43,307 
BLACK FRIDAY 

329 
00:34:07,162 -> 00:34:10,121 
Hi. 
- Hi. 

330 
00:34:11,206 -> 00:34:12,393 
I was ... 

331 
00:34:13,386 -> 00:34:17,884 
a bit weird, last. 
- Yes, there were moments like that, yes. 

332 
00:34:18,580 -> 00:34:21,520 
Was there one that I 
wanted to do with your bag? 

333 
00:34:22,341 -> 00:34:27,248 
Look, the alcohol is converted into sugar, 
and what is done is that ... 

334 
00:34:32,247 -> 00:34:33,327 
Look ... 

335 
00:34:34,528 -> 00:34:35,725 
Many people ... 

336 
00:34:37,646 -> 00:34:41,021 
Almost everyone writes me. 

337 
00:34:41,917 -> 00:34:45,645 
And if you would do, 
I would understand. 

338 
00:34:46,478 -> 00:34:50,865 
What I would ask you is ... 
Do not. 

339 
00:34:54,673 -> 00:34:57,927 
Excuse me. 
I still pick up my salary ... 

340 
00:34:57,928 -> 00:35:01,934 
Does not care, maybe we can talk later? 
- Sure, you can always send SMS messages. 

341 
00:35:02,135 -> 00:35:04,730 
I can do that. 

342 
00:35:07,257 -> 00:35:11,817 
You know Paul, everyone sms't. 
I do not think you have no mobile. 

343 
00:35:12,421 -> 00:35:14,120 
I am not so with this technology, BJ. 

344 
00:35:14,361 -> 00:35:18,330 
I prefer straightforward, 
or through a written word. 

345 
00:35:19,546 -> 00:35:20,746 
$ 300.00? 

346 
00:35:20,747 -> 00:35:24,526 
I'll be in deep debt, this girl. 
You must help me, please. 

347 
00:35:28,050 -> 00:35:30,733 
Paul you are always honest, 
So you know what ... 

348 
00:35:31,237 -> 00:35:33,872 
why take the phone 
my daughter? 

349 
00:35:34,520 -> 00:35:38,183 
I can not do. 
- No, I give her punishment. 

350 
00:35:38,184 -> 00:35:41,276 
All these parties, 
and then her ex-boyfriend. 

351 
00:35:41,477 -> 00:35:45,932 
She passed away on its budget. 
If her life better ... 

352 
00:35:46,199 -> 00:35:49,402 
I will take him back. 
Until that time, you took him just. 

353 
00:35:51,302 -> 00:35:54,840 
Thank you. 
- Stay within the limit. 

354 
00:35:57,181 -> 00:36:01,310 
It's too late to be entered here, 
it is already closed. Nobody goes there. 

355 
00:36:01,311 -> 00:36:03,794 
Yes, I think so. 

356 
00:36:14,054 -> 00:36:16,099 
Paul! 
Come here, man. 

357 
00:36:17,656 -> 00:36:20,815 
I know that you are not comfortable in your skin is, 
So I bought this for you. 

358 
00:36:22,159 -> 00:36:24,807 
Devils cross. 

359 
00:36:25,273 -> 00:36:28,424 
Feel the heat, man. 
- Thank you, Leon. 

360 
00:36:28,425 -> 00:36:29,859 
See you, man. 

361 
00:36:35,051 -> 00:36:37,358 
The loading platform is ready. 
- Roger. 

362 
00:36:44,532 -> 00:36:46,136 
Yes ... 

363 
00:36:54,888 -> 00:36:56,808 
You need a pen, right? 

364 
00:36:57,133 -> 00:36:59,797 
You know it's okay, I use it ... 
- Sure. 

365 
00:37:01,180 -> 00:37:05,553 
Yes, the Sommit 5280 Foutine. 
- Super. 

366 
00:37:05,554 -> 00:37:10,250 
Yes, I know. Would you not like you 
name to continue with this pen? 

367 
00:37:10,634 -> 00:37:13,378 
I would prefer nothing. 
That would be great. 

368 
00:37:13,790 -> 00:37:17,628 
He is for you. I insist. 
- Hello. 

369 
00:37:20,255 -> 00:37:22,199 
Love you not Friday.

370 
00:37:22,200 -> 00:37:24,331 
Best day of the week.

371 
00:37:25,374 -> 00:37:26,659 
Excuse me. 

372 
00:37:27,007 -> 00:37:30,001 
Sorry. 
- Paul, can you help me? 

373 
00:37:30,002 -> 00:37:33,658 
I must quickly go to the bank, but there are still 
two kids play to make. 

374 
00:37:33,659 -> 00:37:37,899 
Can you even close to me. 
- Sure, no problem. 

375 
00:37:38,419 -> 00:37:41,293 
Is everything okay? You seem a little down. 
- With me everything is okay. 

376 
00:37:41,294 -> 00:37:45,052 
A videogame vrolijkt you up. 
- I have service. 

377 
00:38:18,948 -> 00:38:21,587

New song - PLAY AGAIN

385 
00:39:18,331 -> 00:39:19,663 
We go for it. 

386 
00:39:29,385 -> 00:39:30,830 
Attention, ladies and gentlemen. 

387 
00:39:31,094 -> 00:39:32,800 
Go to the nearest exit. 

388 
00:39:33,001 -> 00:39:35,699 
The shopping center closes today 
Unfortunately earlier. 

389 
00:39:36,600 -> 00:39:38,483 
Everybody out! 

390 
00:39:38,768 -> 00:39:40,792 
Everybody out! 

391 
00:39:43,690 -> 00:39:46,466 
Everybody out! 
Now! 

392 
00:40:02,511 -> 00:40:03,595 
Oh, hi. 

393 
00:40:04,191 -> 00:40:05,896 
Hey, hands off. 

394 
00:40:15,939 -> 00:40:18,687 
It is on the mall. 

395 
00:40:21,805 -> 00:40:25,901 
A few crazy people take it on shopping. 
- I am through. 

396 
00:40:25,902 -> 00:40:28,197 
Everyone on the ground. 

397 
00:40:38,023 -> 00:40:41,157 
Take the mobile units, 
they probably hostages. 

398 
00:40:51,504 -> 00:40:53,198 
Lie down. 

399 
00:40:58,203 -> 00:40:59,510 
Oh, my God. 

400 
00:41:04,087 -> 00:41:07,389 
Surprised? 
I know. 

401 
00:41:07,972 -> 00:41:09,932 
But here's the craziest part ... 

402 
00:41:11,684 -> 00:41:13,568 
I am the leader. 

403 
00:41:22,103 -> 00:41:24,377 
We've heard from them in the bank, 
and they have hostages. 

404 
00:41:25,457 -> 00:41:29,227 
Here agent Howard, I have four units 
the area secure. 

405 
00:41:29,262 -> 00:41:32,209 
See if you can see something and take 
than direct contact with me. 

406 
00:41:32,244 -> 00:41:35,855 
Get those people away, and we look 
or go through the loading bay arrive. Go. 

407 
00:41:35,890 -> 00:41:37,368 
Ok. 

408 
00:41:50,947 -> 00:41:53,983 
Hello? 
- Feeling good? 

409 
00:41:54,652 -> 00:41:56,460 
Sorry? 

410 
00:41:58,734 -> 00:42:05,445 
Parissa. Through her you feel 
you good. Or not? 

411 
00:42:06,565 -> 00:42:08,145 
This should be Pahud. 

412 
00:42:08,802 -> 00:42:12,681 
No, I'm not with Parissa. 
My name is Paul Blart. 

413 
00:42:12,883 -> 00:42:15,999 
Parissa's father, has her hair 
Mobile declined and lent to me. 

414 
00:42:16,000 -> 00:42:18,746 
Don 't lie to me, Paul Blart. 

415 
00:42:18,747 -> 00:42:23,545 
Don 't lie to me. You will either above 
it is the sweating. 

416 
00:42:23,546 -> 00:42:28,243 
I lie not. I sweat very much, 
but not on someone. 

417 
00:42:28,244 -> 00:42:34,015 
That woman is a goddess, who just 
good things in this world brings. 

418 
00:42:36,539 -> 00:42:39,793 
And she also 
a few crazy sexy feet. 

419 
00:42:43,786 -> 00:42:44,844 
Paul ... 

420 
00:42:45,980 -> 00:42:50,174 
I can break the pain of our not. 

421 
00:42:50,175 -> 00:42:53,384 
Nobody can blame you 
that you are upset. 

422 
00:42:53,385 -> 00:42:56,648 
The holidays have been difficult enough, 
without a broken heart. 

423 
00:42:58,647 -> 00:43:01,399 
Well these are hard words, Paul Blart. 

424 
00:43:01,400 -> 00:43:05,961 
Hey, life is hard. 
- Yes. 

425 
00:43:06,697 -> 00:43:09,329 
So you are in the mall. 

426 
00:43:09,488 -> 00:43:14,680 
Why not go to Orange Julias. 
Call my friend Samir O. .. 

427 
00:43:15,213 -> 00:43:18,229 
tell him that you are my friend, 
and he arranges something for you. 

428 
00:43:20,072 -> 00:43:21,744 
Wait a minute, how do you know 
I'm in the mall? 

429 
00:43:21,945 -> 00:43:25,802 
I check Parissa via GPS. 
Assessment is not about me.

430
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:32,298
Is it closing? 

431 
00:43:36,118 -> 00:43:40,366 
There are 223 shops in this mall. 

432 
00:43:40,712 -> 00:43:44,680 
Here is a list of the fifteen stores 
I want you holding. 

433 
00:43:45,329 -> 00:43:46,974 
Fifteen for you. 

434 
00:43:49,242 -> 00:43:50,549 
Ok. 

435 
00:43:51,118 -> 00:43:54,655 
This is the key to the codes given 
of the ATMs in the shops. 

436 
00:43:54,656 -> 00:44:01,174 
They change every day, so make sure 
you tell me the codes today bring. 

437 
00:44:22,521 -> 00:44:25,550 
Veck, a zesmans standard formation 
as you said. 

438 
00:44:25,551 -> 00:44:26,856 
Perfect. 

439 
00:44:28,964 -> 00:44:31,312 
Back, back. 

440 
00:44:32,488 -> 00:44:35,032 
And the pigs ran quickly home. 

441 
00:44:35,898 -> 00:44:37,024 
Do it! 

442 
00:44:47,577 -> 00:44:50,813 
Gary gives normal scrap 
to the Salvation Army. 

443 
00:44:53,863 -> 00:44:55,951 
Hello all, I have a few requests ... 

444 
00:44:55,952 -> 00:44:59,927 
Bind the person next to you. 
Keep your mouth shut. Enter your phone off ... 

445 
00:44:59,928 -> 00:45:03,125 
and, as a general rule: do what I say. 

446 
00:45:03,346 -> 00:45:08,181 
If you do all these things, you 
so back home. Back at your pathetic life. 

447 
00:45:08,993 -> 00:45:12,203 
I have none. 
- Amy ... 

448 
00:45:16,772 -> 00:45:21,992 
I hoped that we have a kind 
Bonnie and Clyde affair could have. 

449 
00:45:22,599 -> 00:45:25,695 
Without die 
a sea of bullets, of course. 

450 
00:45:29,127 -> 00:45:32,823 
What do you think? 
- Fuck. 

451 
00:45:36,837 -> 00:45:39,769 
Hey Stu, you'll find it not 
I your girlfriend very hard fall? 

452 
00:45:39,770 -> 00:45:42,800 
What? No. She is not my girlfriend. 

453 
00:45:42,801 -> 00:45:47,049 
But ... I heard you say that 
you almost had something together. 

454 
00:45:47,050 -> 00:45:50,121 
I did not say that we had. 
I said that ... 

455 
00:45:50,445 -> 00:45:52,465 
of learning took. 

456 
00:45:53,520 -> 00:45:56,943 
Nothing more. 

457 
00:45:58,228 -> 00:46:00,167 
My God, what are you a loser. 

458 
00:46:02,172 -> 00:46:03,237 
Hello? 

459 
00:46:03,454 -> 00:46:06,959 
Agent with Howard, the 
West Orange police station. Who is this? 

460 
00:46:06,960 -> 00:46:09,990 
Hello. It goes like this ... 

461 
00:46:10,510 -> 00:46:14,471 
As you have learned all unteachable, 
I have a sensor on each door are ... 

462 
00:46:14,472 -> 00:46:17,561 
so if you want to enter my shopping, 
but please direct ... 

463 
00:46:18,242 -> 00:46:20,237 
at least six body bags along. 

464 
00:46:21,423 -> 00:46:23,693 
They are in the safe open 
to drilling, and they can see us. 

465 
00:46:23,721 -> 00:46:25,514 
Make sure to go through security cameras 
what to see. 

466 
00:46:25,549 -> 00:46:27,466 
Listen, no one will try 
to enter the mall. 

467 
00:46:27,467 -> 00:46:30,499 
Do what you need? 
Do you have food or water? 

468 
00:46:32,911 -> 00:46:36,211 
Man, this guy is not good 
in his head. 

469 
00:46:37,014 -> 00:46:41,789 
Now you do ask, I would 
like to have a happy meal. 

470 
00:46:41,790 -> 00:46:44,752 
Ensure that the toy is the sea monster, 
because I already have the dragon 

471 
00:46:44,753 -> 00:46:47,952 
Okay, what do you really have? 

472 
00:46:49,059 -> 00:46:50,606 
Silence. 

473 
00:46:56,387 -> 00:46:59,117 
Sorry, but the mall is closed. 

474 
00:46:59,118 -> 00:47:02,707 
I can do to bring the output, 
if you say me where you parked. 

475 
00:47:03,541 -> 00:47:05,308 
Dear God. 

476 
00:47:06,609 -> 00:47:08,888 
This does not happen. 

477 
00:47:12,853 -> 00:47:14,197 
Oh, God ... 

478 
00:47:15,040 -> 00:47:19,227 
Well. Think, Paul. 
Where have you trained. 

479 
00:47:23,615 -> 00:47:25,000 
Nothing. 

480 
00:47:26,558 -> 00:47:29,905 
Act fast. 
I must pass. 

481 
00:47:29,906 -> 00:47:31,263 
I give it. 

482 
00:47:32,423 -> 00:47:34,041 
We have an unexpected visitor. 

483 
00:47:36,880 -> 00:47:39,086 
A guard. 
- What are we doing? 

484 
00:47:39,087 -> 00:47:42,613 
I do not know. 
Specifying I think. 

485 
00:47:42,935 -> 00:47:46,850 
Guys, what is wrong with you. 
We are in the plan. 

486 
00:47:46,851 -> 00:47:49,865 
We have an operator of 911 
connected to one Paul Blart. 

487 
00:47:49,866 -> 00:47:53,726 
He is a guard at the mall. 
- Blart is one of my men. 

488 
00:47:55,269 -> 00:47:58,182 
<i> Paul, with Howard of agent 
West Orange police ...</ i> 

489 
00:47:58,183 -> 00:48:00,882 
the mall is busy, 
and they have hostages. 

490 
00:48:00,883 -> 00:48:02,882 
I want you to immediately leave the building. 

491 
00:48:02,983 -> 00:48:05,231 
<i> we can in this situation 
no heroes use. </ i> 

492 
00:48:05,402 -> 00:48:07,762 
Roger, I was never a hero. 

493 
00:48:08,170 -> 00:48:10,843 
Whether you need the game 
Uno find heroic. 

494 
00:48:12,314 -> 00:48:16,172 
Blart, you can even continue with the lesson? 
- Yes, sir. I'm on the way out. 

495 
00:48:18,543 -> 00:48:20,777 
Come on, not die. 
Not dying. 

496 
00:48:21,596 -> 00:48:22,654 
Blart. 

497 
00:48:23,572 -> 00:48:25,764 
Not pee. 

498 
00:48:34,986 -> 00:48:39,210 
The motion was 
just out of door 26. Everyone pointed out. 

499 
00:48:43,414 -> 00:48:46,946 
Amy. 
- What is he doing? Come on. 

500 
00:48:46,947 -> 00:48:48,815 
Blart, come on. 
- Blart, come on! 

501 
00:48:49,231 -> 00:48:51,721 
What is he doing? 
- Come on, Blart! 

502 
00:48:51,722 -> 00:48:54,376 
Come on! 

503 
00:48:56,465 -> 00:48:59,181 
Is he crying? 
- I can not leave. 

504 
00:49:00,360 -> 00:49:01,471 
Blart! 
- Where does he go? 

505 
00:49:01,472 -> 00:49:04,079 
Blart come back. 
Can you talk to him, please. 

506 
00:49:05,762 -> 00:49:07,968 
Blart, this is Brooks, 
what is wrong? 

507 
00:49:08,861 -> 00:49:12,805 
Sir, I have sworn to this mall 
to protect at all times. 

508 
00:49:12,806 -> 00:49:14,447 
We have no oath. 

509 
00:49:15,424 -> 00:49:18,671 
That I have made. 
On a poster in my room. 

510 
00:49:19,181 -> 00:49:20,242 
Listen ... 

511 
00:49:20,636 -> 00:49:23,786 
I think you commit a big mistake. 
The ME is on. 

512 
00:49:24,524 -> 00:49:27,523 
And I think when I say that you do not 
are trained, unarmed ... 

513 
00:49:28,250 -> 00:49:30,909 
and let's be honest, 
you're a big target. 

514 
00:49:31,730 -> 00:49:35,703 
With all due respect, sir. 
But I can not do from outside. Out. 

515 
00:49:36,212 -> 00:49:39,186 
Well officer, it seems 
that you have in mind. 

516 
00:49:40,406 -> 00:49:45,428 
Amy, Paul Blart here, you still 
always in the mall. 

517 
00:49:45,529 -> 00:49:47,041 
Send. 

518 
00:49:59,747 -> 00:50:00,929 
I see him. 

519 
00:50:26,825 -> 00:50:29,641 
Come on, think. 
Think. 

520 
00:50:29,742 -> 00:50:30,983 
Think! 

521 
00:50:52,505 -> 00:50:54,248 
Pick your meeting. 

522 
00:50:56,287 -> 00:50:58,363 
Heart of a warrior. 

523 
00:51:10,958 -> 00:51:12,737 
I missed lunch. 

524 
00:51:20,476 -> 00:51:22,111 
Thank you. 

525 
00:51:41,650 -> 00:51:44,608 
Hey, do not 
harder than it already is. 

526 
00:51:50,134 -> 00:51:51,662 
How about that? 

527 
00:52:20,487 -> 00:52:23,182 
Brooks, I got the girl, 
but boy escapes me. 

528 
00:52:23,183 -> 00:52:25,490 
So, Paul, you have one. 
- Yes. 

529 
00:52:25,491 -> 00:52:28,614 
For clarity, 
I have not beaten woman. 

530 
00:52:29,214 -> 00:52:30,975 
I have my whole 
weight in the sea. 

531 
00:52:31,631 -> 00:52:36,150 
Jesus. 
- She is fine. 

532 
00:52:36,601 -> 00:52:38,096 
Well, let's you then get out. 

533 
00:52:38,779 -> 00:52:41,846 
That will not work, sir. 
I started off where I am. 

534 
00:52:42,810 -> 00:52:45,960 
What is this? 
- Give me that thing. 

535 
00:52:46,951 -> 00:52:48,614 
Paul, agent with Howard again. 

536 
00:52:48,615 -> 00:52:49,996 
<i> If you still refuse to get out ...</ i> 

537 
00:52:50,345 -> 00:52:53,538 
<i> go to the bank again, 
to see where the hostages they hold. </ i> 

538 
00:52:55,188 -> 00:52:56,736 
With pleasure, sir. 

539 
00:52:59,393 -> 00:53:00,407 
Good to know. 

540 
00:53:32,592 -> 00:53:35,090 
I have not heard of Don or Vixen. 
- Okay. 

541 
00:53:35,091 -> 00:53:41,346 
I urge everyone, and I want this shopping center 
from the inside have completed. 

542 
00:53:41,347 -> 00:53:42,659 
Immediately! 

543 
00:53:42,660 -> 00:53:45,654 
Why do not we shoot a few 
hostages down, that will make them stop. 

544 
00:53:45,755 -> 00:53:50,943 
That is one way. But the hostages 
are the only thing that keeps the outside polite. 

545 
00:54:04,857 -> 00:54:08,136 
I am Commander Kent. My team is talking about, 
I would have surrounded this place. 

546 
00:54:08,137 -> 00:54:10,769 
We have ... - Set the environment safe 
and get all those people out of here. 

547 
00:54:10,770 -> 00:54:13,057 
This is all done. 
- My men will do it again. 

548 
00:54:13,058 -> 00:54:16,552 
The right way. 
Let your men retreat. 

549 
00:54:16,553 -> 00:54:18,775 
Are there requirements? 
- A Happy Meal, and absolute silence. 

550 
00:54:18,877 -> 00:54:23,514 
Let's make some noise. I hebluipschutters 
ready. Is the communication ready? 

551 
00:54:23,515 -> 00:54:25,883 
At the security inwards 
I want to have image inside. 

552 
00:54:25,884 -> 00:54:29,748 
That does not, they have destroyed the cameras. 
- We take in ... 

553 
00:54:29,749 -> 00:54:33,766 
.. three ... two ... one. 
I have the leadership. 

554 
00:55:03,450 -> 00:55:06,066 
Brooks, I observe the bank now. 

555 
00:55:07,085 -> 00:55:09,830 
One robber guarded the hostages. 

556 
00:55:12,342 -> 00:55:13,556 
There she is. 

557 
00:55:14,163 -> 00:55:17,641 
My God. 
You are my angel. 

558 
00:55:20,112 -> 00:55:25,089 
Here comes the sweat of love. 
- Paul, your radio is still open. 

559 
00:55:27,827 -> 00:55:30,936 
Understood. 
- What is wrong? 

560 
00:55:30,937 -> 00:55:33,127 
Who is that? 
- We have someone in there. 

561 
00:55:33,720 -> 00:55:36,334 
Certainly some disapproved agent, 
that the hero wants to hang out. 

562 
00:55:36,369 -> 00:55:39,760 
No, his name is Blart. 
He is one of my guards. 

563 
00:55:40,429 -> 00:55:43,945 
Wait, Blart? Paul Blart? 
- Yes. 

564 
00:55:44,379 -> 00:55:47,280 
You make a joke. I schold that loser 
always used at school. Enter here. 

565 
00:55:48,649 -> 00:55:52,717 
Blart, this is Commander James Kent, 
mobile unit of New Jersey. 

566 
00:55:52,819 -> 00:55:56,486 
We went to the same secondary school. 
Remember? 

567 
00:55:56,568 -> 00:55:59,634 
I got you lit during 
the pancake festival. 

568 
00:55:59,709 -> 00:56:03,997 
Right, hi Jimmy. 
- Come on, Green Hornes. 

569 
00:56:04,684 -> 00:56:08,571 
Listen, I have fifty good 
professionals trained outside ... 

570 
00:56:08,572 -> 00:56:13,125 
on my character, we take over. 
And I do not admit that this mission goes wrong ... 

571 
00:56:13,126 -> 00:56:17,236 
because sul previously went to lunch 
with an imaginary friend, this verprutst. 

572 
00:56:17,237 -> 00:56:21,207 
Sorry Jimmy, I had the button, 
the only thing I heard was lunch and friend. 

573 
00:56:21,666 -> 00:56:23,995 
Wil you do me a favor, 
Brooks give me back. 

574 
00:56:23,996 -> 00:56:28,618 
Listen Blart, you is not communicating 
longer brooks, is that clear? 

575 
00:56:31,380 -> 00:56:32,581 
Hello? 

576 
00:56:34,440 -> 00:56:36,627 
Hello? 
- Yes? 

577 
00:56:37,373 -> 00:56:39,324 
Hi Paul, how are you? 

578 
00:56:40,104 -> 00:56:44,889 
It turns out that the hostages 
brought to the counting room. I go closer. 

579 
00:57:26,408 -> 00:57:27,535 
Veck. 

580 
00:57:30,063 -> 00:57:31,423 
There he is. 

581 
00:57:33,450 -> 00:57:36,845 
Everybody to the back. 
Now! Come on. 

582 
00:57:37,958 -> 00:57:40,863 
Brooks, I have seen the hostages. 

583 
00:57:40,864 -> 00:57:44,264 
I could not escape. 
But I know who the leader is. 

584 
00:57:44,537 -> 00:57:48,403 
It is Veck. 
- Veck? The student? 

585 
00:57:48,438 -> 00:57:51,744 
No, the brain. 
- Do not believe it. 

586 
00:57:52,578 -> 00:57:54,323 
I give it to Howard. 

587 
00:58:10,169 -> 00:58:12,691 
Oh, God. 
- Caught. I think it best. 

588 
00:58:13,199 -> 00:58:16,689 
<i> We start tanning. 
Three ... two ... one. </ I> 

589 
00:58:52,911 -> 00:58:54,121 
Yes! 

590 
00:59:08,853 -> 00:59:11,001 
Cypher is in the hunt. 

591 
00:59:35,891 -> 00:59:37,536 
Open, open. 
Open. 

592 
00:59:37,550 -> 00:59:38,924 
Thank God. 

593 
00:59:43,564 -> 00:59:45,027 
Oh, no. 

594 
00:59:47,025 -> 00:59:49,990 
Mr. ... 

595 
00:59:58,395 -> 00:59:59,940 
Get him. 
Get him! 

596 
01:00:06,771 -> 01:00:08,293 
You can also better flights. 

597 
01:00:11,351 -> 01:00:14,752 
Rudolph where are you? 
- I'm an end to it. 

598 
01:00:28,073 -> 01:00:30,609 
Amy, right? What a coincidence. 

599 
01:00:30,610 -> 01:00:34,883 
We have a pretty redhead in the bank 
which is called Amy. - Strawberry Blonde, actually. 

600 
01:00:35,052 -> 01:00:38,259 
I know whom I will first kill. 

601 
01:00:38,725 -> 01:00:40,260 
See you later. 

602 
01:00:40,795 -> 01:00:43,220 
I think you 
no more shopping. 

603 
01:00:43,339 -> 01:00:46,857 
It will soon be over. 
They will feel nothing. 

604 
01:01:33,956 -> 01:01:37,411 
You will not touch. 
But this you will feel. 

605 
01:01:42,347 -> 01:01:44,382 
Nobody wins with a headbutt. 

606 
01:02:04,064 -> 01:02:06,368 
Give me your cellphone. 
- I have none. 

607 
01:02:06,369 -> 01:02:10,768 
Each child has a mobile. 
- I prefer written notes. 

608 
01:02:12,424 -> 01:02:16,576 
Who are these Slopy Joey's, 
and who has given you? 

609 
01:02:16,843 -> 01:02:18,224 
They are mine. 

610 
01:02:18,482 -> 01:02:20,584 
I'm late for my 
work at Foot Locker. 

611 
01:02:24,802 -> 01:02:27,629 
We have contact with him, 
he wants to talk to you. 

612 
01:02:28,398 -> 01:02:30,111 
Silence, my ass. 

613 
01:02:31,334 -> 01:02:35,113 
What is it, I hit you too hard? 
Go now in the corner sucking your thumb? 

614 
01:02:37,144 -> 01:02:41,082 
If you're not interfering with that bastard, 
He will you spend the whole evening continue glands. 

615 
01:02:41,083 -> 01:02:43,464 
Is that so? 
That is not my style. 

616 
01:02:43,916 -> 01:02:48,709 
For the case. 
I have a few nice phrases written. 

617 
01:02:48,710 -> 01:02:52,557 
Like this one. 
- Have you been here all the time doing? 

618 
01:02:53,972 -> 01:02:55,841 
Yes, you and what army? 

619 
01:02:57,509 -> 01:03:00,547 
What is wrong with that? 
- He has an army. 

620 
01:03:07,337 -> 01:03:09,823 
Everyone deserves a pass, 
his birthday. 

621 
01:03:34,383 -> 01:03:39,225 
When you and Rudolph home in this laugh 
were, how easy it all would be ... 

622 
01:03:39,226 -> 01:03:43,500 
you had something of every brain dead 
guard who stands in the way is slain. 

623 
01:03:43,501 -> 01:03:45,819 
And when you were a High Five? 

624 
01:03:45,820 -> 01:03:48,387 
Veck, this guy is ... 
- To win. I know ... 

625 
01:03:48,388 -> 01:03:53,689 
because I am totally ready. 
With pathetic pleasure, I have no codes. 

626 
01:03:53,891 -> 01:04:00,805 
Since I have all the luxury goods 
Amizone purchased with my card ... 

627 
01:04:00,806 -> 01:04:03,906 
The situation is unacceptable! 

628 
01:04:03,907 -> 01:04:06,328 
No, no, no. He looks. 

629 
01:04:06,760 -> 01:04:08,160 
Give me your gun. 

630 
01:04:10,736 -> 01:04:12,486 
Put it down. 
Leg ... 

631 
01:04:13,208 -> 01:04:14,487 
What are you to whisper? 

632 
01:04:14,488 -> 01:04:18,336 
I was wondering if you seriously 
believed that "Happy Meal"? 

633 
01:04:21,215 -> 01:04:22,903 
It is certainly not. 

634 
01:04:26,644 -> 01:04:27,763 
What? 

635 
01:04:27,764 -> 01:04:31,300 
This is Inspector James Kent, New Jersey 
Special Assistance Unit. Did you speak to me? 

636 
01:04:31,301 -> 01:04:34,654 
I wanted only certain 
that no one stupid part. 

637 
01:04:34,655 -> 01:04:37,703 
You should know that my men 
determination to resolve the situation. 

638 
01:04:37,704 -> 01:04:39,760 
The easy way 
or the hard way. 

639 
01:04:40,192 -> 01:04:42,167 
That is a tough decision. 

640 
01:04:42,472 -> 01:04:45,401 
I answer C, 
neither. 

641 
01:04:47,809 -> 01:04:52,040 
I am also Amy. 
- Amy? From UnbeWEHvable? 

642 
01:04:52,041 -> 01:04:53,146 
Yes. 

643 
01:04:53,147 -> 01:04:57,161 
I am Maya. 
My father made it all the time you 

644 
01:04:57,852 -> 01:05:03,531 
And I must say that you really should. 
- I must give. 

645 
01:05:21,335 -> 01:05:23,327 
That is so bad. 

646 
01:05:39,399 -> 01:05:41,869 
Paul, your daughter is here ... Amy 
Oh, my God. 

647 
01:05:43,116 -> 01:05:44,653 
He has his daughter. 

648 
01:05:46,438 -> 01:05:47,514 
Dad? 

649 
01:05:48,914 -> 01:05:51,658 
Everything will be okay. 
- How is your blood sugar? 

650 
01:05:51,659 -> 01:05:55,737 
Do not worry about me. 
I am concerned about you. 

651 
01:05:56,350 -> 01:06:01,469 
At this time you get it all out. 
Hold persevere, dear. 

652 
01:06:01,701 -> 01:06:06,838 
I do. I am a Blart, remember? 
- Yes. See you soon. 

653 
01:06:09,453 -> 01:06:12,017 
<i> I would with the hostages in 
road towards the Cayman Islands. </ i> 

654 
01:06:12,018 -> 01:06:15,211 
And where is Rudolph, 
he would already be back. 

655 
01:06:43,261 -> 01:06:45,517 
Aquarium Heating 

656 
01:07:04,597 -> 01:07:07,346 
MACHINE FOUNDATION 

657 
01:07:15,435 -> 01:07:16,865 
KEY CODE 

658 
01:07:23,245 -> 01:07:26,724 
If the codes Veck take us 
go to ... the Cayman Islands? 

659 
01:07:28,332 -> 01:07:29,692 
Well, Veck Sims ... 

660 
01:07:30,521 -> 01:07:32,368 
... welcome to the show. 

661 
01:07:54,386 -> 01:07:58,453 
<i> Come get me, Veck. 
I have codes for your credit card device. </ I> 

662 
01:07:58,454 -> 01:08:02,669 
Do you hear that? This is Paul, baby! 
- Blart? 

663 
01:08:03,925 -> 01:08:08,310 
That ruining it all? You take 
me in the leg. Give me a portable radio. 

664 
01:08:08,311 -> 01:08:09,743 
Let me tell you something: 

665 
01:08:09,744 -> 01:08:14,274 
If you hostage in my shopping takes 
then make a big mistake. 

666 
01:08:14,475 -> 01:08:16,883 
You underestimated me seriously. 

667 
01:08:20,404 -> 01:08:22,234 
You underestimated me seriously. 

668 
01:08:23,178 -> 01:08:24,659 
Oh, no! 

669 
01:08:26,314 -> 01:08:28,353 
You underestimate me. 

670 
01:08:36,597 -> 01:08:38,196 
Blart? 

671 
01:08:43,317 -> 01:08:45,354 
Sugar ... 

672 
01:08:45,818 -> 01:08:47,179 
Sugar ... 

673 
01:08:47,180 -> 01:08:49,832 
<i> Blart? Are you there, Blart </ i> 

674 
01:08:56,306 -> 01:08:58,161 
Hello, Blart? 
Are you there? 

675 
01:09:22,303 -> 01:09:23,741 
<i> Hey, Blart </ i> 

676 
01:09:24,561 -> 01:09:27,644 
I had something that we could E.T.E.N. 
When you give up? 

677 
01:09:29,540 -> 01:09:30,690 
How about now? 

678 
01:09:30,958 -> 01:09:34,702 
See you at the corner of "NO" and "OIT"! 

679 
01:09:34,737 -> 01:09:40,191 
Yes, you heard me, Chief! 
- All right, Dad! 

680 
01:09:45,331 -> 01:09:46,634 
Hey, guys! 

681 
01:09:47,616 -> 01:09:49,298 
You were looking for me? 

682 
01:09:52,351 -> 01:09:55,304 
Come on. 

683 
01:10:00,652 -> 01:10:03,675 
Follow me ... 
- There he is! 

684 
01:10:07,800 -> 01:10:11,214 
We have him in the fall at Rain Forrest Cafe. 
- Great, waiting for me. 

685 
01:10:11,215 -> 01:10:14,035 
You know what my mother always said? 
If you want something good to be done, 

686 
01:10:14,036 -> 01:10:17,557 
more than the guy himself from the road. I give the 
course again. You stay here. 

687 
01:10:27,146 -> 01:10:29,530 
Prancer, take the rear. 

688 
01:11:36,980 -> 01:11:40,365 
Hey, you! 
Scoobie doebie do! 

689 
01:12:03,962 -> 01:12:06,748 
Can I get my codes? 
- Why? 

690 
01:12:06,749 -> 01:12:08,275 
No codes, no Cayman Islands? 

691 
01:12:08,276 -> 01:12:10,534 
It seems that Paul Blart 
all is not so bad. 

692 
01:12:10,535 -> 01:12:12,311 
Relax. 

693 
01:12:13,816 -> 01:12:15,559 
Oh, no! 

694 
01:12:16,080 -> 01:12:19,802 
All I know is that Paul Blart 
all is not so bad. 

695 
01:12:43,327 -> 01:12:47,348 
Find him. 
Do not come back earlier than that he is dead. 

696 
01:12:49,192 -> 01:12:55,168 
Brooks, another one to go. 
Then there is only me and Veck left. 

697 
01:12:57,276 -> 01:12:59,882 
Ok! Who talks with Blart? 

698 
01:13:00,119 -> 01:13:02,011 
Were you the sweet tooth? 

699 
01:13:02,614 -> 01:13:07,102 
Well, let's try again. 
- Wait, no, no! 

700 
01:13:07,103 -> 01:13:09,700 
It is her phone, she is. 
They talked to him. 

701 
01:13:09,701 -> 01:13:11,953 
They talked with him and I 
her not to do so. 

702 
01:13:11,954 -> 01:13:17,451 
And it is under her leg ... the phone. 
Her right leg. There. 

703 
01:13:17,947 -> 01:13:19,380 
Ok. 

704 
01:13:22,920 -> 01:13:26,537 
That was at the last minute. 
He is a Professor 

705 
01:13:27,904 -> 01:13:30,444 
Listen, Blart. The time is over. 
We storms inside. 

706 
01:13:30,445 -> 01:13:33,283 
Wait. 
Veck to the credit card codes and I got them. 

707 
01:13:33,284 -> 01:13:35,906 
Give me a couple minutes. 
- No problem. 

708 
01:13:58,013 -> 01:13:59,745 
Is not that cute? 

709 
01:14:20,277 -> 01:14:23,391 
Hi, Amy. I'm on my way ... 
- Hi, Blart. 

710 
01:14:24,129 -> 01:14:29,426 
Our boy Stuart showed me your profile 
monitor Lone suckers. com? 

711 
01:14:30,136 -> 01:14:33,895 
He likes the morning rain, 
Walking on the beach. 

712 
01:14:34,160 -> 01:14:39,099 
Who are you? Olivia Newton John? 
- I just speak from my heart. 

713 
01:14:39,100 -> 01:14:43,455 
I do not go online 
to know that you keep peanut butter. 

714 
01:14:43,956 -> 01:14:45,602 
You're so pathetic. 

715 
01:14:49,297 -> 01:14:50,742 
Strange ... 

716 
01:14:55,926 -> 01:14:57,682 
I can use. 

717 
01:14:58,958 -> 01:15:00,142 
What do you Veck? 

718 
01:15:00,243 -> 01:15:05,878 
Thirty one million which I have come, 
but I would offer you your dream girl or ... 

719 
01:15:06,543 -> 01:15:08,334 
perhaps your daughter. 

720 
01:15:08,773 -> 01:15:12,270 
If you touch her, I swear that I'll get. 
- What do you do, Paul? 

721 
01:15:12,371 -> 01:15:16,147 
Your left hip forward lift, the 
illusion that they should have a gun, 

722 
01:15:16,148 -> 01:15:18,462 
which you and I know 
that you do not have? 

723 
01:15:19,400 -> 01:15:22,403 
My God. 
- You go to ball. 

724 
01:15:22,776 -> 01:15:26,304 
The next time I see you, Paul, 
I shoot a bullet in your head. 

725 
01:15:26,305 -> 01:15:29,756 
I thought not. 
I take you to graze. 

726 
01:15:47,936 -> 01:15:49,466 
Blart! 

727 
01:15:54,608 -> 01:15:56,129 
Oh, Blart ... 

728 
01:16:03,813 -> 01:16:06,531 
My dear God ... 

729 
01:16:13,905 -> 01:16:17,722 
I wish I had a bag, I would cut 
to see how much candy would fall out. 

730 
01:16:18,021 -> 01:16:20,645 
This does not happen ... this does not happen. 

731 
01:16:47,414 -> 01:16:50,915 
Bravo! 
This was great. 

732 
01:16:52,245 -> 01:16:54,688 
And you were so close to 
the display to get Paul. 

733 
01:16:54,689 -> 01:16:58,212 
So close. 
- It is not over. 

734 
01:16:58,213 -> 01:17:02,630 
Yes, I thought so. 
The only thing I need is my codes. 

735 
01:17:02,936 -> 01:17:09,672 
Seen your SMS messages, you are so sweet 
been for me in your phone system. 

736 
01:17:12,076 -> 01:17:15,086 
Do you think my phone 
with me have the ... 

737 
01:17:23,954 -> 01:17:25,105 
Hello? 

738 
01:17:25,106 -> 01:17:30,858 
You are not Blart and jelly. 
What about it? So good to hear your voice. 

739 
01:17:30,859 -> 01:17:34,194 
Good to also hear your voice, Pahud. 
Listen, I call you back. 

740 
01:17:34,195 -> 01:17:37,281 
What? When? 
- I do not know when. Talk to you later. 

741 
01:17:37,282 -> 01:17:39,803 
All right, Paul. Call me back. 
Call me back Paul ... 

742 
01:17:42,232 -> 01:17:44,588 
It is always better and more beautiful. 

743 
01:17:45,326 -> 01:17:47,953 
You are impossible to estimate. 

744 
01:17:48,134 -> 01:17:50,047 
You did not for the police exam ... 

745 
01:17:50,048 -> 01:17:54,030 
You can if you do not pass any 
20 minutes to eat a Snickers. 

746 
01:17:54,031 -> 01:17:58,093 
You had the chance to N.V.P. be 
and you blow it. 

747 
01:17:58,094 -> 01:18:01,602 
Again, like you always do. 
Is that correct, Maya? 

748 
01:18:10,369 -> 01:18:13,694 
You know, Veck. 
You're smarter as I do. 

749 
01:18:14,080 -> 01:18:16,502 
You are good with computers ... 

750 
01:18:17,191 -> 01:18:19,279 
You keep your weight level. 

751 
01:18:20,390 -> 01:18:24,338 
People look at you and me 
and it is a big difference. 

752 
01:18:25,000 -> 01:18:26,758 
No contest. 

753 
01:18:30,593 -> 01:18:32,577 
And now you're the man with the gun. 

754 
01:18:35,427 -> 01:18:37,094 
Please. 

755 
01:18:56,526 -> 01:18:59,071 
Get him! 
- Get him, Dad. 

756 
01:19:06,350 -> 01:19:08,949 
I had more to catch. 

757 
01:19:09,952 -> 01:19:11,399 
Dad! 

758 
01:19:16,693 -> 01:19:19,336 
By Laden, guys. 
We go inside. 

759 
01:19:26,270 -> 01:19:28,930 
We are on the way. 
Let's go. 

760 
01:19:33,535 -> 01:19:35,554 
Come on, come on, come on. 

761 
01:19:50,630 -> 01:19:52,316 
Think, Paul! 
Think! 

762 
01:19:55,420 -> 01:19:57,577 
Let's go, men! 
Let them put their number. 

763 
01:19:57,778 -> 01:19:59,786 
Take the suspect caught. 

764 
01:20:11,750 -> 01:20:14,131 
Do not shoot! 

765 
01:20:17,527 -> 01:20:19,496 
Down. 
No, other. 

766 
01:20:19,497 -> 01:20:22,208 
This is the rear! 
No, that is the same. 

767 
01:20:22,209 -> 01:20:26,176 
No! The other! 
- Veck is gone and my daughter Amy. 

768 
01:20:27,370 -> 01:20:30,739 
All, wipe clean the mall. 
We are in pursuit. 

769 
01:20:31,039 -> 01:20:32,453 
Lamp. 

770 
01:20:35,164 -> 01:20:36,731 
Make the door open. 

771 
01:20:40,323 -> 01:20:41,805 
Let's do this. 

772 
01:20:45,860 -> 01:20:47,599 
Give me your mobile phone. 

773 
01:20:49,846 -> 01:20:51,526 
I give him to you, Blart. 

774 
01:20:52,279 -> 01:20:54,165 
We will arrange this. 

775 
01:20:56,033 -> 01:20:57,162 
What is it? 

776 
01:20:57,163 -> 01:20:59,882 
Pahud, you still on GPS 
Pariza mobile phone? 

777 
01:20:59,883 -> 01:21:03,199 
You know that I have, Paul. 
you know that I have. 

778 
01:21:03,200 -> 01:21:05,930 
What can I do for you? 
- I need to know where it goes. 

779 
01:21:10,130 -> 01:21:12,177 
Paul, it appears that 
Blight is on the airport. 

780 
01:21:12,178 -> 01:21:13,904 
I know where that is, thanks. 

781 
01:21:15,607 -> 01:21:16,867 
Hang on. 

782 
01:21:20,719 -> 01:21:22,854 
There they are. Jimmy, take the wheel! 

783 
01:21:25,249 -> 01:21:26,676 
There we go. 

784 
01:21:27,031 -> 01:21:28,212 
What? 
- I was that. 

785 
01:21:28,213 -> 01:21:29,460 
I got it. 

786 
01:21:55,837 -> 01:21:57,058 
Blart! 

787 
01:22:01,692 -> 01:22:03,552 
Do not, Blart! 

788 
01:22:36,225 -> 01:22:37,852 
Beware, he has a gun. 

789 
01:22:38,426 -> 01:22:39,915 
Oh, God. 
- Dad! 

790 
01:22:40,292 -> 01:22:41,369 
Paul? 

791 
01:22:53,314 -> 01:22:55,204 
I do not drink. 

792 
01:23:00,843 -> 01:23:02,098 
Come on. 

793 
01:23:04,218 -> 01:23:05,404 
Dad! 

794 
01:23:10,335 -> 01:23:11,586 
Dad! 

795 
01:23:13,330 -> 01:23:16,017 
Man, that diabetes is a blood sport. 

796
