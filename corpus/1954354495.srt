1
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,884
- Into love and out again,

2
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,853
thus I went,

3
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,719
and thus I go.

4
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,955
Spare your voice,
and hold your pen -

5
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:10,025
Well and bitterly I know
all the songs were ever sung,

6
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,502
all the words
were ever said -

7
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,872
Could it be,
when I was young,

8
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,003
someone dropped me
on my head?

9
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,095
- Oh, I'm rather glad

10
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,101
that you caught me like this,

11
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,467
because it gives me an opportunity
to give you a little talk

12
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:49,975
on the art of making motion pictures
in your own home.

13
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:54,070
Of course, you all know
that you can...

14
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,050
[laughing nervously]

15
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,316
...that you can make motion pictures
in your own home.

16
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,414
All you need to have is...

17
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,050
a home,

18
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,790
and a small camera like this...

19
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,832
somewhere.

20
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,457
And quite a lot of film,

21
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,502
as you see.

22
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,094
Oh, well.
Never mind.

23
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,231
With these essentials,
you can take pictures

24
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,970
of any interesting events that may happen
in your own household,

25
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,070
if any interesting events ever do happen
in your own household.

26
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,777
And you can make a record of all trips

27
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,287
and of the progress of the children
down the path of life.

28
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,654
And you can also entertain your friends
into the bargain.

29
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,626
The other night, we had a party
of friends in for dinner.

30
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:46,597
After dinner,
instead of going out on the town,

31
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,463
as they say,

32
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,163
or settling down
for a dull game of bridge...

33
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,966
[director]: Cut!
Wonderful, Bob.

34
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,371
The rest of this is voice-over.
So let's take lunch.

35
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,432
[Bell ringing]
Thank you, everyone! Early lunch today!

36
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,775
Let's be back in one hour, please.

37
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,372
Try to be back in one hour,
please, Bob.

38
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,542
- Bob, we'll be in the living room
after lunch.

39
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,109
- How are you feeling, Bob?
- I'm fine. Just hurting inside.

40
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,349
Have you got a little...
- The top one's a corker.

41
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,414
- Ah, thank you.

42
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,484
[Mumbling to himself]

43
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,757
Oh, my, look at that.
A higher authority.

44
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,373
- If it comes through,

45
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,001
it'll be the first-ever nomination
for a husband-and-wife team.

46
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,171
- Do you hear that, darling? We could be
the first husband-and-wife team

47
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,182
ever nominated for an Oscar.
- Shit! Now I'll have to see the picture!

48
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,650
- Mr. Selznick should know
by this afternoon.

49
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,744
- This afternoon, darling.
Bob!

50
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,683
- Oh, Alan, how are you?
It's good to see you.

51
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,159
Oh, Mrs. Parker.
- Mr. Benchley.

52
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,425
- Oh, Bob, you look terrific.

53
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:57,333
- When I dress up, I still manage
to look like a house detective.

54
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,770
- It's the tie. Listen, you must come up
to Roxbury Drive.

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,070
I'll whip up some tomato curry
with spring lamb.

56
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:06,111
- That will be fine.
- Alan enjoys whipping young lambs.

57
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,141
- Darling.

58
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,807
Well, great to see you, Bob.

59
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,443
Darling, I'll prepare them
for our scene.

60
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,180
We did a little fix for Goldwyn.

61
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,779
He told us people
want a happy ending.

62
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,622
Dorothy reminded him that in all history,
no single person ever had such a thing.

63
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,853
[Laughing]

64
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,329
Goldwyn doesn't know
what she's talking about.

65
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,599
You must tell me the moment you know!
Just let me know.

66
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,298
- He can be such a fawn's ass.

67
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:37,867
- Well, Mrs. Parker... Goldwyn.

68
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,278
- Mr. Benchley, out here,
the streets are paved with...

69
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,111
- Oh, careful now.
Stepped in something.

70
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,048
- Hi, Bob.
- A little art going by.

71
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,512
Oh, you know,
I'm seeing Don Stewart tonight.

72
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,558
We're going to go out
for a hot-fudge gin.

73
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,650
Donny needs a break

74
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,093
from his leagues
and guilds and Soviets.

75
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,188
- Union is a five-letter word,
Mr. Benchley.

76
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,664
- Well, what do you know about that?

77
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,395
- And I expect to see you
at the writers' fundraiser.

78
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,664
- Oh, was that you
sent me that little card?

79
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,468
I couldn't make it out with the red ink.
- On the first.

80
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,168
- I promised Gertrude and the boys

81
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,870
I'd launch the big Benchley expedition
that weekend.

82
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,607
- These are not the days for timid,
selfish little things.

83
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,651
- Mrs. Parker, it's no small affair,
getting all those people...

84
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,778
- The years I've wasted
being a party girl and a smartass.

85
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,017
- No, you were a pretty...

86
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,820
smart party girl...
- Ass.

87
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:31,227
- Ready for you on the set.
- Bit of a party girl myself.

88
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,027
- Visiting hours are over, Mr. Benchley.

89
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,001
- Let's do it again
sometime soon, Mrs. Parker.

90
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,970
- You'll find us
next door to Caligula.

91
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,438
- Oh, does that hurt?

92
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,372
- Must have been so colourful

93
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,503
in the twenties.
- Was it? I barely remember.

94
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,891
- So many famous writers are from
the Algonquin Round Table,
Mrs. Parker.

95
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,054
- Ah, but no real giants.

96
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,325
Just a bunch of loudmouths
showing off,

97
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,594
writing it up in their columns
the next day.

98
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,330
It was no Mermaid Tavern,
I promise you that.

99
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,430
Oh, Ward, would you get me
a cup of coffee, dear? Thank you.

100
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,874
- They love it, darling.
They love our new ending.

101
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,412
- Brilliant scene, Dottie. Alan.

102
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,574
- Thank you, Farleigh.
How was Bob?

103
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,447
It's so silly. We're all out here,
and we never see him.

104
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,750
- Alan, Mr. Benchley
has sold out to Hollywood.

105
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,084
- Really?

106
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:35,116
- A perfect happy-ending scene, Dottie.
Bravo.

107
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,719
- How very kind of you, Seymour.

108
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,492
You monumental shit.

109
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,033
- Darling, please don't use that word.

110
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,831
- Well, sorry, you monumental...

111
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,235
shit.

112
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,738
[Director]: Alan!

113
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,072
- Yes.
- Veronica, make your heart sing!

114
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,805
- Oh, just put it on the floor, dear.

115
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,676
- And action!

116
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,049
- I came in such a hurry,
my heart is still pounding.

117
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,712
- And I thought
it was Valentine's Day.

118
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,688
- I suppose it was colourful.

119
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,697
- Cut!

120
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,448
[Phone ringing]

121
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,949
[Phone ringing]

122
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,690
[Typing]

123
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,026
- Ahem.

124
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,300
- Oh. Oh, yeah. Delightful.

125
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,035
- How are you today,
Mr. Crowninshield, sir?

126
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,134
Oh, the mail elf is here.

127
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,415
- Mr. Benchley.
- Mr. Elf.

128
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,713
- Do you have anything
for me in there?

129
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,413
- What's with the sign?
- Oh, sorry, we're not allowed

130
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,979
to discuss our salaries.
Crownie's posted a memo.

131
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,422
- There's a love letter
from a soldier in there.

132
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,464
- A real letter?
- No, another post card.

133
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,556
War must've run him short on paper,
I suppose.

134
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,067
- What's the difference
between the red...

135
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,602
- Don't touch that!

136
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,137
- "Dear, if you can send
a cake of working soap,

137
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,302
I think I can arrange
to buy this castle. Ed."

138
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,538
Such passion.
I am overwhelmed.

139
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,516
- "If I were better paid,

140
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,711
"I might feel happier
about murdering time

141
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,219
"in an overheated theatre.

142
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,688
"Indeed, given the state
in which I hobbled home,

143
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,748
"bruised and beaten
by the mediocrity

144
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:50,262
of both author and cast..."
My, our vines do bear tender grapes-

145
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,526
"...I can only guess that my refusal
to list their names here

146
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,726
"is due to a lingering sense
of playground honour.

147
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,167
I'm not going to tell on them."
- Like it, Crownie?

148
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,535
- I would've liked it better
if it hadn't been another...

149
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:04,098
- Another dull thug from another one
of your prodigious producers.

150
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,736
- That had nothing to do with it.
- Oh, how silly of me.

151
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,804
Was it a very big advertisement
he was going to take out?

152
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,713
- Not that it matters,
but, yes, a quarter-page.

153
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,809
Benchley, why didn't you cut
that bit about her salary?

154
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,377
- Would that it were in my power
to alter Mrs. Parker's wages.

155
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,480
- Ahem.
- Get rid of that ludicrous sign.

156
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,958
Didn't you see my memo?
- I'm hungry. Aren't you?

157
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,722
- No. I'm Mr. Sherwood.
I am famished.

158
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,490
- Great Scott!
This is Vanity Fair,

159
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,555
not the morgue.

160
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,600
- You inspire deathless prose.

161
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,262
- I think we'd better feed Mrs. Parker
before she gets cranky.

162
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,567
- Be careful. You know she bites
the hand that feeds her.

163
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,836
- Oh, I do not. Do I?
- Come along. Buckety-buckety.

164
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,219
[Dinging]

165
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,476
[Knocking]

166
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,146
- Oh, shit.

167
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,026
- I thought I was late.

168
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,998
- Not so anyone would notice.

169
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,330
Only three hours.

170
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,031
- What are we doing?
May I come in?

171
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,384
Mm, you smell good.

172
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,921
It smells like home.

173
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,640
Thank you.

174
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,742
- You must be terribly hot.

175
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,576
- No. No.
Not at all.

176
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,864
- Oh, dear.

177
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,925
We can't.
- Why not?

178
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,971
Don't you want to feel married again?

179
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,268
- I have to be at the theatre
in half an hour.

180
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,300
- Musical?
- No.

181
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,040
Ibsen.
- Who's he?

182
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,777
- You'll like it, idiot.
Gun goes off in the third act.

183
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,014
- Come to my office,
my door is always open to you.

184
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,391
- So where is
this mythical husband of yours?

185
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,928
- Tonight I rank third
in his affections,

186
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,589
behind Misters Hague and Hague.

187
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,133
Please.

188
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,362
I look pitiful enough.
[Bell ringing]

189
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,608
[Sighing]
Let's hope the actors

190
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,705
don't put too much "glub"
into their lines.

191
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,786
- Eddie!

192
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,326
Eddie, are you hungry?

193
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,501
Eddie?

194
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,334
Eddie, wake up.

195
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,138
Oh, god.
Eddie, wake up.

196
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,111
Wake up.

197
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,114
- Hi.

198
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,615
Kiss me.

199
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,152
Oh, I missed you.

200
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,753
- Lady, lady, never speak

201
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:19,025
Of the tears
that burn your cheek -

202
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,362
She will never win him,

203
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,995
Whose words had shown
she feared to lose.

204
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,472
Be you wise and never sad,

205
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,477
You will get your lovely lad.

206
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,106
Never serious be, nor true,

207
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,777
And your wish will come to you.

208
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,821
And if that makes you happy, kid,

209
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,379
You'll be the first it ever did.

210
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,396
[Phone ringing]

211
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,798
- There's the phone.
- I'll tune.

212
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,633
Young Mr. Benchley,
where are you going over there?

213
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,071
[Ringing]
- Hello.

214
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,770
- Hello, Gertrude.
It's Dorothy. Um...

215
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,303
something's come up with work.
May I speak with Mr. Benchley, please?

216
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,043
- Certainly. One moment.

217
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,051
It's Dorothy.

218
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,190
On a Sunday.
- A Sunday.

219
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,351
Mrs. Parker, what happened?

220
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,489
- Crownie fired me.

221
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,433
He took me out to lunch,
and then he fired me.

222
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,993
He didn't even have the nerve
to say why.

223
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,438
You and I both know why.

224
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,202
- Ah...

225
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,267
- I've wrecked my career.

226
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,540
Kindly direct me to hell.

227
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,582
- Take two Aspirin, lightly grilled.

228
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,480
I'll be in on the next train.

229
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,509
Well...

230
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,250
- Don't tell me.
I suppose she started crying.

231
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,782
- They fired her.
She did get a bit weepy, yes.

232
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:01,689
- And then the bastard offered me
a satisfactory rate.

233
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,930
- What does that mean, "satisfactory"?
- Exactly!

234
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,996
For a few little pieces at home.

235
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,565
Like I'm a spoiled virgin
and no one else would have me.

236
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,043
- You're not spoiled. Just...
- I'm not?

237
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,080
- You're just highly seasoned,
with some sort of...

238
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,584
- What does that mean, Bob?

239
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,484
What were you two doing
when I was overseas?

240
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:28,822
- Nothing, Eddie. Which is a lot more
than you weren't doing.

241
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,090
Do you mind?

242
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,099
- I'm leaving.

243
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,567
- I was expecting a raise,
I really was.

244
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,111
[Humming]

245
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:58,282
[Tapping]
[Woman]: Do you mind?

246
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,183
- Yes, all right. Then I'll stop.

247
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,718
The day will arrive when they come to me
on their knees and beg me to drum.

248
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,891
- There'll be three of you today?
- Yes, only three.

249
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,729
I wonder what the least-expensive item
is on this menu.

250
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,067
- The eggs.

251
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,200
- Ah, yes,
I believe I'll have the eggs.

252
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,370
- Same for me, please.
Loosely scrambled.

253
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,936
Like my brains.

254
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,811
- Could I get a half-order?

255
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,850
- Hello, guppies!

256
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,479
- What colossal trumpery
is taking place at Vanity Fair?

257
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:33,457
- Well, Mr. Sherwood
was replaced last week

258
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,188
by the woman who gives music lessons
to Conde Nast's daughter.

259
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,456
A woman, I might add,

260
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,624
who's so full of charm,
she's practically panting with it.

261
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,066
[Laughter]
- And then Mrs. Parker was fired...

262
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,230
- Because, I presume, Vanity Fair
is a magazine of no opinion,

263
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,240
and she has plenty.
- And you, Benchley?

264
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,334
We hear your income
is running well into one figure.

265
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,471
- Go ahead, Rob. Tell them.
- I trust this is for publication.

266
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,141
- Benchley, one can't
simply repeat rumours.

267
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,844
- Then do it with some complexity.

268
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,251
- I am resigning from Vanity Fair.

269
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,847
- There'll be five of you today?
- Yes, only five.

270
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,415
- I'm, uh...
- There's no bread yet?

271
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:12,521
- I'm resigning from the magazine,
because Mrs. Parker's dismissal

272
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:16,090
was remarkably stupid...
- Ah! Hello, Helen!

273
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,227
...and unfair.
- It's Helen Hayes.

274
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,601
- And if I've learned anything...

275
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:24,073
- Mr. Case, I've allowed them
to seat five in the booth.

276
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,043
I know it's a little disorderly,

277
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,841
but I think we can keep them
from being disruptive.

278
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,382
[Muffled chatting]

279
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,476
- Everyone, Ross and I have set
a September date for the wedding!

280
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,750
- Congratulations!
- Call me Cox. I'm damned embarrassing.

281
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,621
- And I'm keeping my maiden name.
And no goddamn music!

282
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,923
[Everyone]: No marching down the aisles
to Mendelssohn!

283
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,329
I insist on picking out the wedding ring
and making all the arrangements.

284
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,560
- Nine?
- It's settled!

285
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,001
- We must remodel that ghastly house
before I move in.

286
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,936
- Does that mean you're moving out first?

287
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,997
- Aleck, you left the tub full
this morning.

288
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,202
<i>- In the hopes
that you might take a bath.</i>

289
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,211
I tell you,
that house fairly reeks of sex.

290
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,509
- Oh, Aleck, how would you know?

291
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,914
- Alas, a childhood bout of the mumps
killed the impulse in me.

292
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,885
No, no! Don't apologize!
Celibacy sharpens the senses.

293
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,582
- Is this a dagger I see before me?
- I think this calls

294
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,147
for a "ce-libation."
[Laughter]

295
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,422
- I may not be able to vote red,
but I can certainly drink it.

296
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,258
- Where's my bread?!
- Aleck.

297
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,163
- I'm hungry!
[Laughing]

298
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,929
- Bring them some celery
and some popovers or something.

299
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:28,735
- Mr. Case already told me, sir.
- I knew that.

300
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,968
- They should be here.
- Are you nervous? Don't be nervous.

301
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,034
I'll take care of you.

302
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,774
Ah, your royal highnesses,
I give you Marc Connelly,

303
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,681
fact-finder for the Morning Telegraph.
- Ah, the chorus girl's breakfast.

304
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,344
- Well, I don't actually write
for the Telegraph.

305
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,853
- Eleven.
- Eleven?

306
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,048
- Ah, a bald man.
- Eleven.

307
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,184
- Strange. It feels
just like my wife's behind.

308
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,852
So it does!

309
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,520
[Laughter]

310
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,761
- Listen, everyone, Ross is in the
planning stages of a brand-new weekly.

311
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,394
- Really? Something similar
to what you're doing now, Ross?

312
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,495
- Just what the world is waiting for,
another publication

313
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,132
for little old ladies in Dubuque.
- Don't ask us to be

314
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,972
on your advisory board.
- Speak for yourself.

315
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,478
- Does that does that mean
you're interested, Aleck?

316
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,983
- Ross, you remind me a great deal
of my grandfather's coachman.

317
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,018
- A horse's ass
would know the coachman.

318
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,055
- Oh, here's Kaufman!
- George, over here!

319
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,386
- Everyone...
- Table for one, sir?

320
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,791
- I'd like you to meet my assistant at
the New York Times, George S. Kaufman.

321
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,624
A Jew.
- Gesundheit.

322
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:25,720
- Shalom.

323
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,288
- I'm no longer your assistant, Aleck.
- You haven't converted, I trust.

324
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,597
- No, just promoted.
- You feeling all right, George?

325
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,603
You look terrible.
- Terrible'd be an improvement.

326
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,196
Harold Ross, American Legion Weekly.
- You shouldn't touch George.

327
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,937
George doesn't like to be touched.
- How many will there be for lunch?

328
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,139
- There will be two of everybody!
- Mr. Case won't like this.

329
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,613
- Oh, well.

330
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,242
Case closed.
[Clinking glass]

331
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,081
- Yes, Bob?
You rang?

332
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:52,419
- I'm afraid I have some...

333
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:56,086
I am resigning my position
at Vanity Fair.

334
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,423
- Why?

335
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,863
- Well, because my job, if you could call
it that, as managing editor

336
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,491
is no longer attractive

337
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,435
without the extraordinary talents
of Mrs. Parker

338
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,438
and Mr. Sherwood.

339
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,768
Ahem.

340
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,400
This is not a reckless decision.
I'm a careful man,

341
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,377
one who often wears a belt,
as well as suspenders.

342
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,606
- Bravo.
- Bravo, Bob.

343
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,812
- Think of us fondly, please,
as ships departing a sinking rat.

344
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:27,956
- Well, make a good union man.
- What was that all about?

345
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,494
[Laughing]
- Uh, Mr. Woollcott,

346
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,759
I have to remind you,
as of this week,

347
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,801
drinking alcohol here is illegal.
- Geoplenarian,

348
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:41,202
<i>I am interested only in things
that are illegal, immoral, or fattening.</i>

349
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:45,073
- It's wine, not alcohol.
Ice, please.

350
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,946
- Are you all right, Mrs. Parker?

351
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,318
- Oh, that man is a mess.

352
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,825
Kaufman? Oh, I think he's rather quick.
- Is that what his name is?

353
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,326
<i>Oh, I never saw such a thing.</i>

354
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,853
- He's a twitchy fella.
Childhood...

355
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,422
- Mr. Benchley...

356
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,298
are you quite sure about this?

357
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,895
- Positive, Mrs. Parker.

358
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:17,430
Listen, you can't buy the kind
of advertising they'll be giving us.

359
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,771
We'll be freelancers.

360
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,176
Oh, my God,
we'll write only what we like,

361
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,647
not slave over a hot desk
for people like Conde "Nasty."

362
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,946
- Have you told Gertrude?

363
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,317
- Pardon.

364
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:33,381
[Speaking faux French]

365
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,655
- Is there a problem?
- Don't worry about a thing.

366
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,889
I've set this kind of fracture before
without much pain,

367
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,933
but we must get started immediately.
Mrs. Beemish, please take a seat.

368
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,865
- Does it hurt?
- Oh, it's dreadful.

369
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,233
- Please don't try to speak.
I need room to work!

370
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,906
We'll rent an office together,
move in, cheer each other on.

371
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,038
You can try your dainty hand
at fiction, and I'll start my...

372
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,548
[chuckling]
...history of the Queen Anne humorists.

373
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,312
Both of them.

374
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,785
- Mr. Benchley...

375
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,880
I feel as though
you're proposing marriage.

376
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:10,826
- How many torments lie
in the small circle of a wedding ring.

377
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,990
- What if it doesn't work?
- Well, we'll just yearn a living.

378
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:18,298
First, we need a name
for the office door.

379
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,066
- Utica Drop Forge and Tool Company.
- Perfect.

380
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,471
Robert Benchley, president.

381
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,476
Dorothy Parker, president.

382
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,147
Dorothy...

383
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,149
- I could kiss you.

384
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,048
But I'm not sure
it would come out right.

385
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,882
- Yeah...

386
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,617
You're afraid you might
melt the gold in my teeth.

387
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,387
- Afraid I might lose you.

388
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,126
I know I'm losing Eddie.

389
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,828
I couldn't bear losing you too.

390
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:54,463
- You'd have to wear a pretty large hole
in your pocket to lose me, Mrs. Parker.

391
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,904
- Madame, Monsieur.

392
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,807
The eggs are getting cold.
- Ah.

393
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,750
Much better.

394
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,726
Have to be comfortable when I sit down
to write, because that's where I shine.

395
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,285
[Phone ringing]

396
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,361
Park bench.
Mm-hmm.

397
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,835
May I tell her who's calling?

398
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,304
- Does the cent sign
go before or after?

399
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,931
- After.
- Oh.

400
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,442
- There's a Mr. Nichols.
Wants to know where your story is.

401
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,773
- Who?
- Mister...

402
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,403
- Oh!

403
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,380
Tell him something, will you?

404
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,043
- I'm afraid Mrs. Parker's
had some sort of an attack.

405
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,281
They're in the process now
of freezing her appendix.

406
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,587
The doctor seems to think we may
get it to listen to reason this way.

407
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,093
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

408
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,789
All right.

409
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,490
Certainly.
Goodbye.

410
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,292
Has to be in by tomorrow.

411
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,997
- Oh. Shit.

412
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,232
I may die before a train of thought
leaves the station.

413
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,572
- Me, too.

414
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:07,907
Hmm.

415
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,571
Let's change places.

416
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,115
- All right.

417
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,321
Hmm... Well.
Pardon me.

418
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,947
- Excuse me.

419
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:34,536
- We'd build a little bungalow,
If you and I were one,

420
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,803
And carefully we'd plan it so

421
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,572
We'd get the morning sun.

422
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,775
I'd rise each day at rosy dawn

423
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,478
And bustle gaily down.

424
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,043
In evening's cool,
you'd spray the lawn

425
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:53,613
When you'd come back from town.

426
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,559
If you and I were one, my dear,

427
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,119
A model life we'd lead.

428
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,860
We'd travel on
from year to year,

429
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:07,337
At no increase of speed.

430
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,067
Ah, clear to me the vision

431
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:14,305
Of the things
that we should do.

432
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,780
And so I think it best,
my love,

433
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,545
To string along as two.

434
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,678
- Here, dear?
- Oh, to the right.

435
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,925
- Oh, how do you do?
I'm Neyso Mcmain.

436
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,985
I'm your neighbour.
Would you like a drink?

437
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,791
- Sworn off.
Thank you.

438
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,731
- Oh, well, if you should ever
want to come by,

439
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,995
my door is open
day and night.

440
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,663
- Hotel Algonquin.
Please hold.

441
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,402
- O'Neill's won the Pulitzer, Aleck!
- Bravo!

442
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,841
- Hey, John.
How are you?

443
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,505
- Aw, shucks, everyone, it's Rogers.
- Mr. Woollcott. How you doing?

444
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,574
- You know everyone. Everyone, Will.
- Mr. Benchley.

445
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,280
- How do you do? Will Rogers.
- Nice to meet you, Miss Parker.

446
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,687
- I never liked a man I didn't meet.
[Laughter]

447
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,283
- Thank you, I guess.

448
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,328
- So, Aleck, Will Rogers for president.
What do you think?

449
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,387
- Get out of here.
Now that women have the vote,

450
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,399
what do you think, ladies?
- It is a lovely hat.

451
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,332
[Laughter]

452
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,530
- It's the hat
that gets you in the White House.

453
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,664
This must be the smallest table

454
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,040
in the biggest city on the planet here.
You folks got sore knees under there?

455
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,238
- We need a ouija board.
- We divine the future.

456
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,681
- So brave.
- Future looks pretty divine to me.

457
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,583
- Georges, tell Mr. Case

458
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,612
I've had a great idea.

459
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,386
- He might not believe it, sir.

460
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,427
- If Ziegfeld changed the name
of the show...

461
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,927
[chatting]

462
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,931
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- Wisdom, every word.

463
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,796
- Serge!

464
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,520
- Ross, use the word "dog"
in a sentence.

465
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,056
[Laughter]

466
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,591
- We'll give you time.

467
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,184
- Get her a drink.
- Yes. Would you like a drink?

468
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,628
Please, come.

469
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,394
- What on earth
are you talking about, Georges?

470
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,992
- Well, Neyso, I think if you loiter
in your studio long enough,

471
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,267
the whole world will drift in and out.
- That's the point.

472
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,831
- Sour trumpet at the end
of a third-rate marching band.

473
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,741
- Round of cards?
- I'll get the girls.

474
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,404
- The girls?
- Poker.

475
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,380
- Yes, I'd love to.
- You're a celebrity, George.

476
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,077
Face it.
- Right. A temporary one.

477
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,779
- There's not another kind.
- My point exactly.

478
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,017
- Come on, Don. Ardent infidelity. That's
the first thing that springs to your mind

479
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,855
when you think of Mrs. Parker.
- Well, it's not the first thing,

480
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,829
but gradually, I work
my way back around.

481
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,058
- Let's take a walk through here.

482
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:59,229
I'll show you some of Miss Mcmain's
extraordinarily useless objects d'art.

483
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,465
- Your apartment is just lovely.
- You think?

484
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,474
It's that Slavic architecture.
It's just like a dormitory, really.

485
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,373
Oh...

486
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,038
Just like a dormitory here.

487
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,844
I was just saying, the Par...
Well, here they are now.

488
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,818
The Parkers live just across the hall.
That's why...

489
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:19,323
- It's really so kind of you letting
Robert sleep over when he works late.

490
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,018
Why, sometimes I think you see
more of him than I do.

491
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,061
- I'm always very modest.
You know that, Gertrude.

492
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,724
- It must be wonderful to never have
babies waking you up.

493
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,960
They don't allow
babies in dormitories.

494
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,127
- Not that there's anything
wrong with babies.

495
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,899
- If there were, Gertrude,
you'd be arrested by now.

496
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,065
[Laughing]

497
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,803
- Well...

498
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,504
- I'm sorry, I...

499
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,239
I didn't understand.

500
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,248
- For being so good with them.
- Thank you.

501
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,342
- And you are good with them,
God knows. They worship her.

502
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,580
I don't think they know who I am.

503
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:53,453
- Aren't you and Eddie anxious
to start a family of your own?

504
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:57,393
- Oh, good... Heavens, no.

505
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,692
My mother was 42
when I was born.

506
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:02,358
Of course, then she promptly
went and died on me,

507
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,027
so maybe waiting
isn't such a good idea after all.

508
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,765
- Reminds me,
I need another drink. Anybody?

509
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,101
- Uh, no. No.

510
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,438
- You know, my mother
was 34 when she had me,

511
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:16,947
but she had the good graces to wait
until I was 12 before she passed away.

512
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,916
- She was always
the politest of women.

513
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,884
You know.

514
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,319
- Oh, well, here's a lovely picture.
Benchley and his two wives.

515
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,321
- Not nice, Aleck.

516
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,951
- Oh, come on. Surely you don't say
it's an intellectual relationship.

517
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,086
- What does that mean?
- Yes, what does that mean?

518
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,596
In their minds, they "mm"
like bunnies.

519
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,498
- Oh, Mr. Benchley.

520
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,968
- How's Eddie doing?
He seems all right.

521
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,437
- Well, I think
he's off the morphine, anyway.

522
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:46,239
- Now he wants to move back
to Hartford to be near his family.

523
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,972
I don't know.

524
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,207
Maybe it'll be easier for him there.

525
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,773
At least they know
how to keep house.

526
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,480
Wifely chores can be lethal,
Mr. Benchley.

527
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,146
- Only if done properly.

528
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,851
You're much too hard on yourself,
Mrs. Parker.

529
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,291
A little garbage
gives a house that lived-in feeling.

530
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,589
- Robert.

531
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,857
- Pull a bed sheet
over it or something.

532
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,092
- The coward's way out?

533
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,259
- Robert.

534
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,360
Excuse me, please,

535
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,631
I must find the ladies room.

536
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,605
- Just to the left here.

537
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,641
Right around the corner there.

538
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,870
- Do you know
where the ladies room is?

539
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,344
- Here, take one of mine.
- No, I don't drink.

540
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,007
- All right. It's just in the back.

541
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,348
- Oh, uh, you've, uh,
forgotten your, uh...

542
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,717
- Soul, as usual.

543
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,219
- If our Mrs. Parker used her body
the way she uses her mouth...

544
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,228
- Dottie, 20 Questions.

545
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,991
I'm thinking of a person.

546
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,123
- I'm so happy for you, Ross.

547
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,601
Would he be the kind of man
to put the wings back on flies?

548
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,367
- I know nothing about entomology.
- Compassion, not bugs.

549
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,237
Right?

550
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,334
- Who's that sitting
with Deems Taylor?

551
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,744
- Mary Kennedy. She's consoling him
through his divorce.

552
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,749
- But if I were you,
I would be paying more attention

553
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,150
to my own flanks
than to his at the moment.

554
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,089
- Paula!

555
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,682
I see you've met
my little husband.

556
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,490
- Oh! So this is Eddie.

557
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,427
Well, how's your arm, dear?

558
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,227
- My arm?
- Why, yes.

559
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,134
Dottie said you broke it
sharpening a pencil?

560
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:23,299
- Did she? Excuse me.
- You did say that, didn't you, Dot?

561
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,866
- Paula, your slip is showing.

562
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,038
- It's on purpose, dear.

563
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,809
- Unlike your acting, that is.

564
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,283
Excuse me.

565
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,513
[Chuckling]

566
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,817
- Ah, hello, Frank.

567
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,188
- Take care of your body, Paula,

568
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,353
because when it goes,
you'll have nothing left.

569
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,230
- Shouldn't you leave some
for the other guests, Eddie?

570
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,237
- I have to exercise my arm
after all those weeks in a cast, dear.

571
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,331
- I never said such a thing.
- Sure you did.

572
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,070
They know better
than to expect anything from me,

573
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,076
thanks to you.

574
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,080
- You don't want to become
the town drunk, Eddie.

575
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,615
You're not in Manhattan.

576
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,777
- You know, I think
that you ought to drink more, dear.

577
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,151
Then maybe
you could stop nagging me.

578
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,151
I may be a dimwit

579
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:21,392
and a lousy drunk, dear,

580
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,229
but you and your friends...

581
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,802
- Eddie. Ah!

582
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,936
- It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

583
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,680
[Panting]

584
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,901
- I'm sorry.

585
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,999
I'm sorry. I... I...

586
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,102
I didn't...
I didn't know what to do,

587
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,113
so I... I just held my breath.

588
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,883
Are... are you all right?

589
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,156
I'm just so grateful
Robert doesn't drink.

590
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,852
His uncle did, you know,
so he's seen the damage done.

591
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,918
[Sighing]

592
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:28,363
Do you really like that?

593
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,765
- Not much.

594
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,826
But it's better
than a sock in the eye.

595
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,440
[Laughter]
- Mind if I join you?

596
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:42,878
- So anyway, I asked him
if he'd ever read Edna Ferber's new book.

597
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,780
It's a very full book.
- Full of what, Ross?

598
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,511
- Full of not being edited.

599
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,577
- And this from the editor
of American Legion Magazine, mind you.

600
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,123
- You could do with a little trimming
yourself, my dumpling.

601
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,216
- So it's thin, thinning,
or needs thinning.

602
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,261
- Three words Aleck
has never heard of.

603
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,523
- That's almost a subjective completion.

604
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:04,159
- What Ross means is that stories
flow easily from Edna's fingertips.

605
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:07,068
- Oh, I understand she fairly
whistles at her typewriter.

606
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,402
And there was that poor sucker Flaubert

607
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:14,138
just rolling around on the floor for days
looking for just the right words.

608
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,908
- Well, Dottie,
I do love your pieces.

609
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,950
And when Ross launches his new magazine,
you'll have to be part of it.

610
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,748
No other woman writes like you do.
- Who would want to?

611
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:27,120
- Listen, I read your new piece in the
Smart Set over and over again, Dottie.

612
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,785
It was wonderful.
- How sweet, Ross.

613
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:33,592
Didn't he understand it the first time?
[Laughter]

614
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,928
- Alan, dust off your tutu.
It's official.

615
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,094
We've rented the 49th Street Theatre
for Sunday, April 30th.

616
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,535
- Bravo!

617
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,039
[Cheering]

618
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,631
- As our treasurer,
I feel compelled to ask,

619
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,973
how much?
- Not to worry, Bob. I made a great deal.

620
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,807
- They gave us
the sleeves off their vests.

621
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,815
- Kaufman should've negotiated.
He's the Christ killer.

622
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:54,647
- One more slur upon my race, Aleck,
and I'm walking away from this table,

623
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,279
out of the dining room,
and away from this hotel.

624
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,882
- I trust that Mrs. Parker
will walk out with me... halfway?

625
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,222
[Laughter]
- Raoul Fleischmann was 14

626
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,125
before he realized he was a Jew.

627
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,528
- That's nothing. I was 16
before I realized I was a boy.

628
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,396
- What convinced you?
- Gravity.

629
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,402
- Sex laws of a Newton.

630
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,768
<i>- Chemin de fer.</i>

631
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,467
<i>- Mirabile Dictum.
[Everyone]: Oh! Ah!</i>

632
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,534
- What on earth are they talking about?
And don't tell me you understand.

633
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,409
- Too much for your precious ears.

634
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,505
- Why,

635
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:29,417
speaking of stage-struck
Jewish nuns, here's Edna!

636
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,478
You almost look
like a man today, Edna.

637
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,251
- So do you, Aleck.

638
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,189
[Laughter]

639
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,920
- Madam Ferber's
so diligent in her duties,

640
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,461
I'm surprised
she's deigned joined us.

641
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,497
- Well, coffee and sandwiches
aren't my usual,

642
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,965
but don't make me out
a dullard to your friends.

643
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,002
I always say,
"There's no good sauce for play

644
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,095
like hard work."
Please, sit down.

645
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:52,006
- Bite your tongue, Mistress,
before our Mrs. Parker does it for you.

646
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,109
- Ah, the two of you split without
having written a flop yet, eh, Marc?

647
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,944
- That'll be the day.
- Oh, flops -

648
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:03,180
these days, they're just a play
where no one wears evening clothes.

649
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,449
- An Edna Ferberating statement
if ever I've heard one.

650
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,491
- Oh, that couldn't be
Ferber from the truth.

651
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,547
- You know what I admire?

652
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,493
Is an artist who's got enough brio
to embrace Main Street.

653
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,998
- So the range of his works
may be from bad to horrible?

654
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,002
I think far too wide a stretch
is made of the word "artist,"

655
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,097
because I don't think
that word is elastic.

656
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,404
If I did...

657
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,273
I'd be better company.

658
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:32,547
- Well, I think you're wonderful
company, Mrs. Parker.

659
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,848
- Homemade fudge, anyone?

660
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,150
Edna, uh...
- I love your fudge, Georges.

661
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,122
- Who's the actual producer...?

662
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:45,858
- My little dream princess,
I will plan, cast and polish

663
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,366
the entire revue
with my usual revolutionary taste.

664
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,197
- The devil you will.
[Laughing]

665
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,838
- Ladies and gentlemen!

666
00:37:55,906 --> 00:38:01,173
Tonight, 12 rounds in three acts

667
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,646
of unregulated artistic impulse.

668
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:08,082
In the well-lit corner,

669
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,417
the Vicious Circle
of the Hotel Algonquin.

670
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,423
[Applause]
Algonquin.

671
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,220
And in the darkened corner,

672
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:19,662
well, the sort of thing one usually finds
in a darkened corner.

673
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,665
Tonight, the no-walkout rule

674
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,496
will be in effect,

675
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,798
and our judges this evening

676
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,135
will be your trampled sensitivities.

677
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,697
We shall be quite vulgar
and unduly exhibitionist,

678
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,939
chief characteristic
distinguishing man from beast.

679
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,640
And so now, as usual,

680
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,876
we'll shoot ourselves.

681
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,111
[Piano playing]
[Applause]

682
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,419
<i>We got the blues</i>

683
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,686
<i>We got the booze</i>

684
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,662
<i>We believe we said before
we got the blues</i>

685
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:57,098
<i>They're little flappers
never growing up</i>

686
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,604
<i>And they've all been flapping
since Belasco was a pup</i>

687
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,502
<i>We got the blues
They've got the blues</i>

688
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,336
<i>We got the booze
They've got the blues</i>

689
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:08,003
- Didn't know you played.
- Yes, that was my execution.

690
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,445
<i>We got the blues</i>

691
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,277
<i>I'm an ingnue</i>

692
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,215
<i>And I've got the blues</i>

693
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:18,016
<i>As everyone can plainly see</i>

694
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,183
<i>It's 'cause an ingnue
must promise to</i>

695
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:24,489
<i>Imprison her virginity</i>

696
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,292
<i>I check my maidenhead</i>

697
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,992
<i>In my producer's bed</i>

698
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,524
<i>Oh gosh I guess
the joke's on me</i>

699
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,093
<i>We got the blues</i>

700
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:38,437
- They're extremely depressed, and
there's nothing that I can do about it.

701
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,637
- Ah, the prodigal bum has returned.

702
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,680
- How's it going?

703
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,308
- Why are you writing numbers?
- Mm, my report.

704
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,148
- Report? What about the sketch, man?
Your sketch.

705
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,120
Your sketch!
You're next! You're on!

706
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:54,282
- You wanted an account of the finances.
That's what Connelly told me.

707
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,918
- Don't point the scinger of forn
at me, Benchley. Dorothy...

708
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,019
- If you want to drink, ruin your life...

709
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,724
- Share this with your friend.
He's in need of inspiration.

710
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,131
- Liquor makes people
behave unlike themselves.

711
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,726
- Why would you want people
to behave like themselves?

712
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,704
- In your case, I...

713
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,771
It's like a train station in here.

714
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,908
Don't look at me in that tone of voice,
Mr. Benchley.

715
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,078
- May I see that, please?

716
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,918
Thank you.
Oh, it's my uncle Albert.

717
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,924
That's exactly how he smelled.
What's it taste like?

718
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:31,018
- Like it smells. Now give it here.
- Ah, ah, ah.

719
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,325
- I won't be the cause
of your corruption.

720
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:36,594
<i>- My corruption?
- Two minutes, you're on.</i>

721
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,760
- Come along and hold me up,
Mrs. Parker.

722
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,304
<i>Ahem-hem.
Never growing up</i>

723
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,239
<i>And we've all been flapping</i>

724
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,173
<i>Since Belasco was a pup
We got the blues</i>

725
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,541
<i>They've got the blues
We got the blues</i>

726
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,705
- Too bad
Eddie didn't stick around.

727
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,841
He likes leg-and-fanny numbers.

728
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,113
- He went back to Hartford?

729
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,519
- And it was all going so well.

730
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,457
<i>Blues
Copeland and Connelly</i>

731
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,758
<i>Connelly and Copeland
the playwrights of the prairie</i>

732
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,391
- Hey, girls, how'd you like
to be in a show?

733
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,365
[All]: Yeah!

734
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:13,926
- All right, let's go back
to the dressing room and, uh, talk.

735
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,232
[Laughter]

736
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,570
- What's funny is a laugh
wrapped inside a fact.

737
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,108
That's funny.

738
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,235
<i>That's funny.
- That would be some of our Mrs. Parker's</i>

739
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,678
unprintable verse.
Come on. Come on.

740
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:27,274
You're in a Broadway theatre now.
I want you to behave yourself.

741
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,717
Careful!

742
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,153
[Applause]

743
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,248
- Oh, careful of the tomatoes.

744
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,758
Wonderful! Wonderful!

745
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,418
New careers for everyone.

746
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,656
Very nice.
[Applause]

747
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,925
- I don't understand this obsession
with women's clothing.

748
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,903
- Oh, you look wonderful, ravaging!

749
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,736
- Jane, listen, I can't go to this party.
Please, can we not go?

750
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,969
- Then don't come.
- Get out of my way, Ross!

751
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,307
I'm here with someone with talent.

752
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:59,713
- Thank you, Mr. Sherwood
and your lovely companions.

753
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,115
Certainly, "He Who Gets Flapped"

754
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,280
loses nothing in its translation
from the original Russian.

755
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,948
[Laughter]
And now,

756
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,858
it is with a great sense of mystery

757
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,294
that I...
- Try to pay attention, Mrs. Parker.

758
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,264
- Don't break a leg.

759
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:18,961
...Mr. Robert Benchley and his report.
[Applause]

760
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,308
- Ahem. Ahem-hem.

761
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,945
Ahem-hem.

762
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:37,716
I shall, uh, take but a very few moments
of your time this evening.

763
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:42,157
I realize that you'd much
rather be listening this...

764
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,684
interesting entertainment
than to a dry financial report.

765
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,458
Ahem.

766
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:52,127
But, uh, I am reminded of a story,
which you have probably,

767
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,193
all of you, heard.

768
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,865
Uh, it seems that there were
these two Irishmen

769
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,671
walking down the street,
but when they came up...

770
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,711
Uh, they came to a...

771
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,747
Oh, I should've said
in the first place

772
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,339
that the store belonging
to the Irish...

773
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,009
the first Irishman...

774
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,246
the first fella's store...

775
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:18,193
Uh, well, anyway...

776
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,093
The, uh, parrot...

777
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,631
Ahem-hem-hem.

778
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,626
Now, in connection
with reading this report,

779
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:28,160
there are one or two points Dr. Murnie
wanted brought up in connection with it,

780
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,468
and he has asked me
to bring them up in connec...

781
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,372
To bring them up.
Ahem.

782
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,104
[Laughter]
The first is in regard

783
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:38,046
to the work that we are trying to do
at our little place at Silver Lake.

784
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:42,882
A work that we feel not only fills
a very definite need in the community,

785
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:47,185
but also fills a very definite need...

786
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,088
in the community.
Ahem.

787
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,059
[Laughter]
Uh, the...

788
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,858
I don't think many members
of our society realize

789
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:58,129
just how big the work is
we're trying to do up there.

790
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:01,262
For instance, I don't think it's
generally known that most of our boys

791
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:04,330
are between the age of 14.
[Laughter]

792
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:08,037
Uh, we feel that by taking
the boy at this age,

793
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:12,310
we can get closer
to his real nature.

794
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,352
And a boy has a very real nature,
you may be sure.

795
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,852
[Laughter]
Ahem.

796
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,980
- Dottie, I'd like you to meet
my new discovery:

797
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,151
Baby Vomit.
Beware: Her lacy sleeve

798
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,661
has a bottle of vitriol
concealed in its folds.

799
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,959
- Get a load of this guy.
Blows into Tony's

800
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,694
like something cut loose
from the Macy's Day Parade.

801
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,032
Brings me here to meet
one of my favourite writers,

802
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,594
forgets my name.
Well, it's Charles.

803
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,766
Charlie.
Charlie MacArthur.

804
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,275
- Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Vomit.

805
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,485
- Charlie's new at the American.

806
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:52,283
Very amusing fellow from Chicago
with theatrical ambitions.

807
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,985
I thought I'd lay him at your feet
like the faithful retriever that I am.

808
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,721
- Bad dog, Aleck.

809
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,423
- I heard your husband
might be away.

810
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,522
Well, his wife's in Chicago.
[Whistling]

811
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,829
- Aleck, do you meddle
in all your friends' sex lives

812
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,336
just because they have them?
- I knew you'd be pleased.

813
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:11,534
- Now, it seems to me
that the people who criti...

814
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:15,635
Why, criticize, that, uh...
[laughing]

815
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,341
The, uh, the people who...

816
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,975
Why, as a matter of fact,
it was done just as, uh...

817
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,179
economically as...
[laughter]

818
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,119
As is possible.
Even more so.

819
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,283
[Laughter]

820
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,791
[Louder laughter]

821
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,352
Mr. Rossiter, uh,
unfortunately our treasurer...

822
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,859
Mr. Rossiter, our treasurer,

823
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:43,430
unfortunately
is confined to his home

824
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,067
with a bad head cold...
- Psst!!

825
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,805
- And, uh, I, uh...
Excuse me.

826
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:56,983
Oh.

827
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,921
Well...

828
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,152
the joke seems to be on me.

829
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,559
Mr. Rossiter has pneumonia.
[Laughter]

830
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,063
- Who is this guy?

831
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,032
[Aleck]: Robert Benchley,
Life Magazine.

832
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,863
- That's Benchley,
the drama critic?

833
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,870
- Mm-hmm. A saint.
- A saint, no less?

834
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,735
Well, it's a good thing
he's so goddamn funny.

835
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,708
- Yes, it is.
It's a goddamn good thing.

836
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,039
- Aleck.
- What, Ruth?

837
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,875
- We're next.
- Don't worry. Calm down, Ruth.

838
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,747
- The treasurer's, uh, report.

839
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,752
[Laughter]

840
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,755
- He was the best thing in the show.
So into my column he goes.

841
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,854
- Hear, hear.
- Robert is a writer, not an actor.

842
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,229
Besides, he would never
have time for performing.

843
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,029
What with myself
and the boys in Scarsdale

844
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:48,230
and his job at the magazine.
As it is, he's got to be careful

845
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,364
he doesn't work himself
into the ground.

846
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,408
- I've seen it happen before, Gertrude.

847
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,240
- Never underestimate
the power of applause.

848
00:46:55,312 --> 00:47:00,215
- Marc, from one's self expect applause.
He noblest lives and noblest dies...

849
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,275
- Help me.
Help me, Mrs. Parker.

850
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,513
Yeah, well, Irving Berlin
and Sam Harris -

851
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,419
right behind you,
directly behind you -

852
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,119
want me and the Treasurer's Report
to be in their next revue.

853
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,094
Oh, how do you do?
Uh, ahem.

854
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,993
It seems that, well, l-l-I...

855
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,396
l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-I...

856
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,435
[giggling]
I couldn't justify a critic like myself

857
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,802
being... well, having a paid job
on stage, of course.

858
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,933
But I didn't want to offend them
and say no, so I asked for $500,

859
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,137
and they... I thought they'd just laugh.
And the next thing I know,

860
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,147
Harris is gleaming at me
with those...

861
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,706
and saying, "For $500,
you better be awfully good."

862
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:37,413
I'm a bit flustered.
I guess we'll see what happens.

863
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:41,014
- Congratulations. I'm Charles MacArthur.
- How do you do? I'm Robert Benchley.

864
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,423
Excuse me, I have to tell my...

865
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:46,428
my wife.
Excuse me, Gertrude.

866
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,896
- Would you like a drink
before kissing me?

867
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:55,962
- Yes.

868
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:01,375
- If I don't drive around the park,
I'm pretty sure to make my mark.

869
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:05,176
If I'm in bed
each night by 10:00,

870
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:09,345
I may get back
my looks again.

871
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:14,083
If I abstain
from fun and such,

872
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:18,253
I'll probably
amount to much,

873
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,456
But I shall stay

874
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,056
the way I am,

875
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,602
Because I do not
give a damn.

876
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,764
[Aleck]: Tim and I a-hunting went,
spied three women in a tent.

877
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,799
They being three, we being two,
I bucked one and Tim-bucked-two.

878
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:40,044
- Oh, here's Bobby's station.

879
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:44,281
- One man's descent into hell.
- Where we're all waiting for you.

880
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:46,288
- Say hello to my father,
will you, Rob?

881
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,992
- If I can find him.
[Snickering]

882
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:57,466
This place ought to be closed -

883
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:00,526
by law.
[Applauding]

884
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:04,096
And thank you.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

885
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,870
- Rob, how do you feel?

886
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,208
- I feel...

887
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,577
I must say, I...

888
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,014
feel like an angel.
[Laughter]

889
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,847
- Some friendly advice, Benchley.

890
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,319
The best way to avoid a hangover
is to stay drunk.

891
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,379
- How does a sophisticated gentleman
know when he's drunk?

892
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,722
- When he can't pronounce
"sophisticated" anymore.

893
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,763
- Isn't she adorable?
- She's delirious.

894
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,661
- That's why she's adorable.

895
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:31,462
- Well, to get back to me,

896
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:35,835
I was wondering how it could have been
so awful drinking with Eddie

897
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,101
and so much fun

898
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:41,008
drinking with all of you.

899
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:43,478
- Is that a loaded question?

900
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,880
- Because you're married to him.

901
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,680
Might be more fun
sleeping with somebody else, too.

902
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,017
- Oh, dear, dear.

903
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,422
Is the, um, subject
in danger of turning to sex?

904
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,824
[Benchley]: No more than usual.
- Because we wouldn't want Charlie here

905
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:00,795
to think that's all we ever talk about.

906
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:04,527
- Don't look now, toots, but no matter
how much you talk about sex,

907
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:07,126
you never know
how the other fellow does it.

908
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,798
- Why would you want to know that?

909
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:13,639
- Well, you would know
if you were an experienced woman.

910
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,009
But of course,
it would be bad manners to tell.

911
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,945
Now, wouldn't it?

912
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,186
[Whispering]
- Cops are here.

913
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,520
Everybody speak easy.

914
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,526
- Through the kitchen.
- I'll see if I know

915
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:32,391
any of them.

916
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,162
[Police whistle blowing]

917
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,000
[Police whistle blowing]
- This way!

918
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,804
[Police officer]: All right, everybody.
Settle down.

919
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,674
We're going to take a little ride.

920
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,576
- One at a time. Come on.

921
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,349
- You're coming with us
this evening.

922
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:57,683
[MacArthur]: Nice faces.
[Mrs. Parker]: Lovely hats, too.

923
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,621
[Humming]
[MacArthur]: Put your drink away!

924
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,751
[Benchley giggling]
- This is wonderful!

925
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:08,320
- Oh, shit! I left my purse inside.
- That's all right. They'll return it.

926
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,593
Federal good-manners act and all.

927
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,635
- Wait here. I excel at this.

928
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:23,246
Press. The American.
Mind if I take a look?

929
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:27,613
- This fella conks me on the head,
and thus goes my heart.

930
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,948
- Ah, love conks-her all.

931
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,784
- He's wild and mad and fleet.

932
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,689
I may have him mounted.
- Yes, one would assume.

933
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,754
[Woman]: Now take it easy!

934
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,098
[Gasping]
- Philip.

935
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,575
[Thunder rumbling]

936
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,305
- Here we are.

937
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,812
- Taxi!
- Hello?

938
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:01,248
He's engaged.
- Oh, you are? Then be happy.

939
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:03,650
Congratulations.
- Lousy goddamn...

940
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,848
- Gentlemen!
Would you strike this man?

941
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,584
- Want to do something about it,
pipsqueak?

942
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,353
- New York will be deprived

943
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,827
of its annual
Gilbert and Sullivan revival,

944
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,921
I think.
- The hell with him. Let's walk.

945
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,260
- Nice meeting you, however.

946
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,927
- I love the rain.
I am sister to the rain.

947
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:21,937
- My place is closest, sister.
- Just missed my last train.

948
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:25,338
I guess I'm coming too.
- I'm a late sleeper.

949
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:28,070
- I'll be sure to boil my eggs gently
and not scrape my toast.

950
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,170
- Hello. Excuse me.
- Hey, wait, there.

951
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,874
- 47th and 7th, please.

952
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:34,473
- Thank you
- Thank you very much.

953
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,487
Thank you.

954
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,993
- Hello.

955
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:48,553
- Ah.

956
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:49,997
Hello.

957
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,894
- Thank you... for the robe.

958
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:56,336
- Cheers.

959
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:02,202
- My apartment is shamefully undeveloped
compared to yours.

960
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:05,840
- Ah, well, a friend helped me
fix up the place.

961
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:08,510
- I should say a few friends.

962
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,185
Oh, do you enjoy Swinburne?

963
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:17,283
- Look... before you start
analyzing my books,

964
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,260
there's something
I should clear up.

965
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,763
- You didn't pick them out, either?

966
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,036
- I lied when I told you
you were one of my favourite writers.

967
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,612
- And I lied when I smiled.

968
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,543
- It's just that I've read
more about you -

969
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,950
what Dorothy Parker
thinks of this or that -

970
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,817
than your actual writing.

971
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,720
Not counting the fluff, of course.

972
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,489
- Fluff pays the rent.

973
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,524
- Yeah, but if I were you,
I'd be worried.

974
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,762
- Oh, how dare you.
- How dare you.

975
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,472
- Come.

976
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,202
Come here.

977
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:09,609
- What, I'm supposed to worry because
a self-confessed liar and sycophant

978
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,978
whose place looks like
it's been decorated by the Junior League

979
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:15,483
tells me to?

980
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,179
- That's right.

981
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,722
- I'm not going in there.

982
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,620
Why?

983
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:24,159
- Because I've read my share.

984
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,491
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

985
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,895
- Well, did you know
that I sold a short story

986
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,830
that took months to write?

987
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,367
That's, um...

988
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:35,427
fiction, for your information.

989
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:39,168
- My low brow is not congenital, Dot.
I saw it.

990
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:43,042
About a henpecked husband
living in the suburbs.

991
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,842
Seemed a lot like Benchley.

992
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,916
Now, don't be mad.

993
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,360
Dream bigger.

994
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,022
- Like you?

995
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,532
- Yeah, like me.

996
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,502
- And you're going to help,
I suppose.

997
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,266
- Sure. Whatever you want.

998
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,671
It could be...

999
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,073
one of the very best.

1000
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,510
I'd think you'd want to find out.

1001
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:23,051
- This must be some sort of sophisticated
Midwestern farm-boy routine.

1002
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,482
Um, uh... wh-what's my line?

1003
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:29,320
- You know, for a little person,
you talk an awful lot.

1004
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:31,519
...the mule,
and plow my fertile fields?

1005
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,041
[Thunder rumbling]

1006
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,773
- No.

1007
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,817
But I'm glad you're by the book.

1008
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:08,317
I felt we were pretty good together
for the first time.

1009
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,825
- I guess adultery takes practice.

1010
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,758
- Double adultery cancels itself out.

1011
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:22,364
- Questionable logic,
but I like the theory.

1012
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,440
What does your wife think about it?

1013
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,378
- Ah... don't worry about her.

1014
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,040
We're clean.

1015
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,451
How can you wake up so beautiful?

1016
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:42,820
- Oh, Charlie.

1017
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,561
I'm going to wear
my heart on my sleeve

1018
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:50,065
like a wet, red stain.

1019
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:15,553
- Runaway trains colliding.

1020
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,025
- You knew it was dangerous
when you introduced them.

1021
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,358
- Cupid is judged on precision,
not perils.

1022
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,957
- Don't look now, toots, but this is
the one she's been waiting for.

1023
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,399
- Oh, it's a little something
for Woodrow.

1024
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:33,935
- We're engaged, everybody.

1025
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,773
- Dorothy's dog and I.

1026
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,441
- Sit.

1027
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,045
- Keep it down, everybody.
[Laughter]

1028
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:47,257
Covered in enemy crap,
the bombs exploding all around me...

1029
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,657
[laughter]

1030
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,489
I was overcome with a...

1031
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:54,758
a powerful feeling of optimism.
[Laughter]

1032
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:59,768
So I said to myself, "Macarthur,
this is the lowest point in your life.

1033
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:02,168
From here on, everything
will be an improvement."

1034
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:03,796
[Laughter]

1035
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,804
Get more.

1036
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,645
- Queen's bet.
- Queen's bet five.

1037
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,278
I don't know how wonderful
they are together.

1038
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,290
- They're an ideal couple.
I'd love to have them both write for me.

1039
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,155
Macarthur's got a terrific head
on his shoulders.

1040
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,717
- And a different one each night.

1041
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:28,958
I remind you, there are two sides
to Mistress Dorothy.

1042
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:31,967
- Offensive and defensive.
[All]: Our founder.

1043
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,367
- If a man pursued her,
she wouldn't be interested.

1044
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:38,396
- Let that man pursue another woman,
she'll fall deliriously in love with him.

1045
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,465
With claws flashing and tears falling.

1046
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:43,910
- She's available, but she's the
goddamndest fortress at the same time.

1047
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,676
- Yeah, a fortress of cards.

1048
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,341
[All]: Our founder.

1049
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,181
- She really knows how to suffer.

1050
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,744
The greatest little runner-downer
there ever was.

1051
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:55,450
- Dottie can't be suffering
and still say all those funny things.

1052
00:59:57,293 --> 01:00:00,091
<i>There wasn't a soul
to greet me there</i>

1053
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,290
<i>A lone stranger
on your shore</i>

1054
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,731
<i>But Irish luck
was with me there</i>

1055
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:08,464
<i>And wishes came galore</i>

1056
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,063
- Happy birthday, Dottie.
- Happy birthday, Dot.

1057
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,507
- Don't you think
29's dangerously ripe, darling?

1058
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:17,546
- Nah.
Just how I like 'em.

1059
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:24,016
The tide's out.

1060
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,520
The table's set.

1061
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:27,055
Everybody like clams?

1062
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,784
- Mm.
- Come on, Marc.

1063
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,553
- Can't we just whistle for them?

1064
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,152
- They don't have ears.
Grab that.

1065
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:37,024
[Vomiting]
- Dottie.

1066
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,464
- Oh, God.
- Nobody saw.

1067
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:47,669
- I can't even get morning sickness
when you're supposed to.

1068
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,609
- Are you sure?
[Sighing]

1069
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,978
Dottie.
- Oh, Neyso, I wish to Lord I weren't.

1070
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,458
In April,

1071
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,756
In April,

1072
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:10,356
My one love came along,

1073
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:13,129
And I ran the slope

1074
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,261
of my high hill

1075
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,739
To follow a thread of song.

1076
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,867
His eyes were hard

1077
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,808
as porphyry

1078
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:26,406
With looking on cruel lands;

1079
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:29,940
His voice went slipping over me

1080
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,045
Like terrible silver hands.

1081
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,418
In April,

1082
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,917
In April,

1083
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:43,329
My love went whistling by

1084
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:45,094
And I stumbled here

1085
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,728
to my high hill

1086
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:51,137
Along the way of a lie.

1087
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,606
Now what should I do

1088
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,802
in this place?

1089
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:58,404
But sit and count the chimes,

1090
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,642
And splash cold water

1091
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,981
on my face

1092
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:06,488
And spoil a page with rhymes?

1093
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:31,780
- Aw. What happened?
Did you fall asleep?

1094
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:38,279
I spent two hours in the theatre
imagining you were dead somewhere.

1095
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:41,084
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Dot,
I'm sorry.

1096
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:44,615
- Oh, don't be, it was more entertaining
than the play I was watching.

1097
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,457
- I'II... I'll just get dressed.

1098
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:49,987
- In fact I gave up on the whole thing
quite early and spent most of the evening

1099
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,899
on the floor as a member
of a volunteer search party

1100
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:56,029
to aid the lady on my left
in retrieving a missing rubber.

1101
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,629
Oh, I left my lipstick here
yesterday.

1102
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,004
- Dot-Dottie...

1103
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:08,242
[Paula]: You know,
it must be just as hard

1104
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:12,185
to get that look right in life
as it is onstage.

1105
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,952
- Well, someone has to leave.
If you ask me,

1106
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:22,520
it ought to be the someone
who already has their clothes on.

1107
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,764
But then...

1108
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,860
you're the writers.

1109
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,038
I'm just an actress.

1110
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,713
- Dorothy, cut the theatrics!

1111
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,719
We're both still married!

1112
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,319
We're in no position to...

1113
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:51,386
Look, you know my situation.

1114
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,792
- And you know mine,

1115
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,626
while you're up.

1116
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,326
- I said I'd help take care of it,
and I meant it.

1117
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,300
Here's your lipstick.

1118
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,466
- Does the gangplank need painting?

1119
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,469
- Dorothy...

1120
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:14,107
you know I adore you.

1121
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:17,949
But I'm not going to make any excuses.
- Oh, no. Goodness, no.

1122
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,251
It's all my fault.
Really, it is.

1123
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:23,724
Well, I wish I didn't have to go,

1124
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:27,729
and let's hope I won't be rushing back
as fast as my little legs can carry me.

1125
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:30,630
I can't tell you how much...

1126
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,691
I'll miss you.

1127
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:34,668
Just drive, please.

1128
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,945
Where is he?

1129
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,482
Did he telephone?

1130
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:51,580
Why am I so cold?

1131
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:54,521
- It's the anaesthesia.
We had to give you extra.

1132
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,388
You must have been further along
than you told the doctor.

1133
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,325
[Bell tolling]

1134
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:13,642
- Your hangover is going straight
to the Smithsonian,

1135
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:15,142
Mrs. Parker.

1136
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,805
- Once it kills me
and becomes famous, you mean.

1137
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,905
- Jesus. Don't say that.

1138
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,883
- You know, there's a lesson
for all of us in this.

1139
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:24,681
- Oh...
- What's that, Sherry?

1140
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,154
- Well, I don't know.

1141
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,692
Good night, everyone.

1142
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:36,431
- Yes, well,
it's getting to be that time, isn't it?

1143
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:37,966
- Coming, Dot?

1144
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:43,469
- Time does flit.
Oh, shit.

1145
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:49,333
- Good night.
- Dammit, my watch has stopped.

1146
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:50,606
- Yeah?

1147
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,475
You wound it too tightly.

1148
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:02,457
- Perhaps it is in need
of lubrication.

1149
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,925
- Let's go wild tonight!

1150
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:08,691
There's plenty of time
to do nothing once you're dead!

1151
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:10,629
- Please don't use that word.

1152
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,258
- What do you say, Mr. Benchley?

1153
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,166
You want to go wild tonight?

1154
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:18,038
Thank you.
Mr. Benchley?

1155
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:21,042
Mr. Benchley?

1156
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:23,374
Fred!
- Mm?

1157
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:26,210
Oh, perhaps I should
see you home, Mrs. P.

1158
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:29,251
We can recite Crossing the Bar
along the way.

1159
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,218
What do you think?

1160
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:33,847
- I can't sleep worth sour apples.

1161
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:38,183
I keep seeing these little...

1162
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:41,252
hands and feet...

1163
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:45,767
and a head full of curly hair,
just like Charlie's.

1164
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,666
God is standing over me,

1165
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:50,535
in a doctor's jacket...

1166
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:54,565
shaking his long rubber-gloved finger.

1167
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,612
That's very phallic,
don't you think?

1168
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,375
But l-I...

1169
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,178
can't understand
what God is saying,

1170
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:05,379
because he's got a mask
over his face.

1171
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:11,990
Isn't that just like him?

1172
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:13,653
[Whining]

1173
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:16,289
Oh, you poor, hungry thing.

1174
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,060
[Whining]

1175
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,701
All right.

1176
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,674
Up we go.

1177
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,513
Oof...

1178
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,475
[sighing]

1179
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:40,978
[Thunder rumbling]

1180
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,252
Look, Woodrow,

1181
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:44,792
it's raining.

1182
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,350
We want

1183
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:47,794
the rain...

1184
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:49,956
the wanton rain.

1185
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,204
Oh, you're simply all...

1186
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,331
worn-out, aren't you?

1187
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:03,410
Just...

1188
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:05,310
hungry and worn-out.

1189
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,750
Well...

1190
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,310
we don't want to have a breakdown.

1191
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,824
Got to keep you healthy. Huh?

1192
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,996
There you are.

1193
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,970
There you go, darling.

1194
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,667
A nice dinner for you.

1195
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,601
[Sighing]

1196
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,154
Oh, hello, Johnny.

1197
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,954
It's Mrs. Parker.

1198
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,221
Yes, I'll be needing you
to deliver up some dinner

1199
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,786
before the theatre tonight, dear.

1200
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,096
Oh, whatever's the special.

1201
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,227
And a large pot of coffee.

1202
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,793
Thank you.

1203
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,176
All right.

1204
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,076
[Coughing]

1205
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:31,357
Tragedies don't kill us, Woodrow.

1206
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:35,432
Messes kill us.

1207
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,563
I can't stand messes.

1208
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,775
Oh, where's the fucking Aspirin?!

1209
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,882
The sun's gone dim,

1210
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,361
and the moon's turned black;

1211
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,661
for I loved him,
and he didn't love back.

1212
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,836
[Thunder rumbling]
[Benchley]: You were a mess lying there.

1213
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:54,148
Bleeding and drooling.

1214
01:10:57,953 --> 01:11:00,717
You were pathetic...

1215
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,758
and disgusting.

1216
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,623
- Is that all?

1217
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,628
- I only know 15 adjectives.

1218
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:13,065
- You don't have to tie double knots,

1219
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:15,035
Mr. Benchley.

1220
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,664
These are not your son's Oxfords.

1221
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:25,806
Do you still love me, Fred?

1222
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:28,145
- Of course I do, Mrs. Parker.

1223
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,208
- But you think I'm a killjoy.

1224
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,452
- No, I don't.

1225
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:39,494
But if you don't eat more solid foods
and stay away from razor blades,

1226
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:41,529
you could arouse that suspicion
in others.

1227
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,064
[Knocking]

1228
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,895
I hear mice.

1229
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,629
Shall I discourage them?

1230
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:50,729
[Chuckling]
- Do I look... all right?

1231
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:56,301
- Now you do.

1232
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:57,845
Come in.

1233
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,161
Well...

1234
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:17,130
aside from FPA,
who withers easily,

1235
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,963
it seems as though all your friends
are here, Mrs. Parker.

1236
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:24,028
- Yes...

1237
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:26,802
And Paula too.

1238
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,376
- It must be rough
now that Benchley

1239
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:34,883
and Charlie are such good friends, huh?

1240
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,180
- It's not so bad.

1241
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:39,152
I just let 'em ignore me.

1242
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:45,617
You know, people still think
he's banging me every night.

1243
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,857
And sometimes I wish to God he were.

1244
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:51,525
[Sighing]
But only sometimes.

1245
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,470
You know, he sent me
$30 for the operation.

1246
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:59,837
Judas making a refund.

1247
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,726
Oh, for Christ's sake.

1248
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,981
- There you are.
- Fred, how long do you think

1249
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,573
we can keep this thing up?
- Keep what up?

1250
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:46,519
- You performing six nights a week
and me covering first acts.

1251
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:49,557
- We need the money, Mrs. Parker.
You only need enough money

1252
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:52,651
to keep body and soul apart.

1253
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:55,458
- Shhh. Remember, Mrs. Parker,

1254
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,624
speak easy.

1255
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,963
Open up.
This is a raid.

1256
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,502
[Knocking]

1257
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,203
[Benchley coughing]

1258
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,071
Oh, God!

1259
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:10,475
[Coughing]

1260
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:14,380
Please, Mrs. Parker.
- You're running a fever, Fred.

1261
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,281
- People will think
I beat you in private.

1262
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:17,784
- You're running it ragged.

1263
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:20,822
- Probably how I managed to get so much
done and still look so dissipated.

1264
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,823
- I'll bet you haven't
eaten a thing all day.

1265
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:25,257
<i>- Au contraire.
I found a little French place nearby.</i>

1266
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:28,854
Completely without charm.
One brown and one clear, please.

1267
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:34,366
- Oh, for crying out loud, Fred.

1268
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:37,405
The last thing you need is that.
What? What about your family?

1269
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,203
- Who?
- I forbid you.

1270
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:43,267
- May I remind Mrs. P. That
I am not a fictional creation of hers.

1271
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:44,676
I could easily saunter...

1272
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:48,409
- What could you possibly say
to a thing like that?

1273
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,681
"Did you go to the circus this year?"
Oh, no, no, better.

1274
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:54,620
"When do your tonsils come out?"
- How about "Your regal presence

1275
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:58,786
at the bar has inspired my soul
to an upheaval"? Hmm?

1276
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:01,295
That's the source
of all great literature -

1277
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:02,853
an upheaved soul.

1278
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:09,929
- I have a question to ask.
- Mm-hmm.

1279
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,973
- A serious one.

1280
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,912
- Anything.

1281
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,813
- Why do you think...

1282
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:26,214
that we...

1283
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,256
- Yeah?

1284
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:30,188
- You and I...

1285
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:33,456
- That would be "we."

1286
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,360
...have never misbehaved?

1287
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:44,501
I'm referring to what we don't do
in spite of everything.

1288
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:46,473
- What we don't do...
- Mm...

1289
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,304
- Mrs. Parker, really.

1290
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,445
- Tell me.

1291
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,987
Now.

1292
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,086
- Well... ahem.

1293
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,423
I suppose we respect
each other too much.

1294
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:09,862
<i>- Ah. We don't respect anyone.
- Well, Mrs. Parker,</i>

1295
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:12,833
suppose it didn't work.

1296
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,893
- Suppose it did.

1297
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:22,665
- No. No, no. It's a lot easier to take
disappointment when you're young

1298
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:25,679
or dumb or don't expect much,
but we're old and smart.

1299
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:29,706
Don't bat those ingnue eyes at me,
you know what I'm talking about.

1300
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,253
That's the trouble.
You know entirely too much.

1301
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:36,655
- Oh, gee, and I was thinking
I must not know enough,

1302
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:40,354
because the things I want most
I can't seem to get.

1303
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,795
- That's because you've forgotten
how to have fun.

1304
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,433
- Oh, really?

1305
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:47,900
Fun.

1306
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:53,567
I'll show you some fun.

1307
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,140
What are you doing?
- Yes, you.

1308
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:58,941
- What are you doing?

1309
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:01,505
[Benchley coughing]

1310
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,107
You looked

1311
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,244
in need of rescue, dear.

1312
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,844
What's your name?

1313
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,914
- Joanie.
- Sit down, Joanie.

1314
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,517
- Joanie Gerard.
- How do you do? I'm Robert.

1315
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:15,620
- Nice to meet you.
- Are you an actress, Joanie Gerard?

1316
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:18,689
- I'm a Western Union girl.
- Oh...

1317
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,462
- But I want to be an actress.

1318
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,231
- Oh, you dear, brave soul.

1319
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,932
You're in luck!

1320
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,532
Freddy is a talent scout,
aren't you, Fred?

1321
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:28,974
- Really?

1322
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:30,978
- Oh, well, after a fashion.

1323
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,879
And this is Mrs. Parker,
my good friend

1324
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,679
and favourite living writer.
- But not much fun.

1325
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:40,279
- You're a real living writer?
- Currently on leave.

1326
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,857
- Geez, I feel like I ought
to drop a curtsy or something.

1327
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,154
[Benchley giggling]

1328
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:49,391
[Speaking under her breath]

1329
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,432
[Benchley laughing]
- All right.

1330
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,092
- So, what do you say?

1331
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,261
Shall we go wild tonight?

1332
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:58,204
Yeah, Fred, what do you say?
You want to go wild?

1333
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:01,436
- I could outline several opera plots
I've been working on.

1334
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,102
[Knocking over a drink]
Oh!

1335
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:06,011
- Forget him, dear.

1336
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:09,209
I've just been released
from Our Lady of Malpractice,

1337
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,775
and I want to go wild.

1338
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,151
How do I learn how?

1339
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,816
[Screaming]

1340
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,837
- Ah! Ah! Ah-ah!

1341
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,932
- It's on Broadway.
You could come, sir, that would be...

1342
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,909
- Artists - that's why we invite them.

1343
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:41,278
[Laughing]
Bravo, George. Bravo!

1344
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:43,146
[Woman]: Mind us, you cretins!

1345
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:44,412
[Woman screaming]

1346
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:47,182
- Well played!

1347
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,688
- That wasn't very sporting.

1348
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:50,622
- Well...

1349
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:52,990
Do we have a game?
I'll sing an opera.

1350
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,154
You gentlemen see
if you can name it.

1351
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,959
- All right.

1352
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:58,932
- Here we go.

1353
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,332
[Singing opera music]

1354
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:08,605
- I would say that is,
uh... Joe Green.

1355
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:10,702
Yes, it's definitely Joe Green.

1356
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,440
- Joe Green?
- Giuseppe Verdi.

1357
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:15,142
- Don't look now, toots,
but unmarried Yale barristers

1358
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:18,948
have been spotted
cavorting on the south lawn.

1359
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:24,424
- Oh, a girl can get splinters
sliding down a barrister.

1360
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:26,688
What else?

1361
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,458
- What about our athletic friend
down there?

1362
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,499
He's built like a horse.

1363
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:34,160
- Always so optimistic.

1364
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:36,500
Well, he keeps waving his mallet
in my direction.

1365
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:38,232
It must mean something.

1366
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,341
- What are you doing?
This isn't polo, you cretin!

1367
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,571
Descend from your perch,
my little morning dove,

1368
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:47,581
and show this Neomalthusian
how it's done.

1369
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:52,543
- Mind if I join you?

1370
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,419
- You must be picking wallflowers, Scott.
[Screaming]

1371
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,687
- Well, Sherry, I read your latest
short story "Extra, Extra."

1372
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,456
It was as fine a bit of writing
I've ever read.

1373
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:05,022
Short, lean, acid. So good.

1374
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,731
<i>- This is a magazine of the city.
- A smart magazine.</i>

1375
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,205
- And not for the little old lady
in Dubuque.

1376
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:13,969
- You have a title?

1377
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:16,567
[Singing an opera song]

1378
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,613
[Others joining in]

1379
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:22,081
- What's in a name?
A name is simply a name.

1380
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:25,313
It's who you know, darling.
It's who you know.

1381
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,651
- Most of our friends
will be contributing.

1382
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:30,190
Dorothy Parker, for one.
- George Kaufman.

1383
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:31,987
- FPA.
- Bob Benchley.

1384
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,857
- They're all devoted to the idea.

1385
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,397
They've never heard
of anything like it and...

1386
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:38,455
So...?

1387
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:41,934
- George, come here!
Is he through that wicket?

1388
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,528
- Wicket's crooked, Marc. No.
- Ha!!

1389
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,506
- Whose ball is this?
- You cheat!

1390
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:48,133
- Whose ball is this?
- That's Edna's.

1391
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:50,110
For God's sake!

1392
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,442
- Now what do you want to do, huh?

1393
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,545
- I've always wanted
to write a novel or a play.

1394
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,482
- How old are you?
- Twenty-eight.

1395
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,713
- Twenty-eight.
Don't let the time pass.

1396
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,586
If you want to write something,
you write it.

1397
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:04,557
Don't turn 40 wishing you had.

1398
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,186
[Screaming]

1399
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:11,631
- Why is Harpo the only one of us
who enjoys performing like a seal?

1400
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,565
Please don't answer that.

1401
01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:16,798
- It's a magazine for a man
who knows his way around the city.

1402
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,306
- Or wants to know.
- Yes. A man not unlike myself.

1403
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,672
- Oh, it's fascinating!
- What's this magazine about, Ross -

1404
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:23,768
shipping news?

1405
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:26,575
- It's a magazine about New York
for people with manners.

1406
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:30,209
- Yeah. M-manners.

1407
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:33,686
- Well, if it's about New York,
why not call it The New Yorker?

1408
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:35,552
- Now, that's brilliant.

1409
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:40,487
- Hello.
- Hey!

1410
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:43,292
- I hope you like to gamble,
Dorothy,

1411
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:46,766
because I just made a bet
that I can make you smile.

1412
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:49,395
- Oh, I hate to see
anyone lose money.

1413
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:50,938
It's so hard to find.

1414
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,737
Don't go away.
I must eat something before I pass out.

1415
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:02,616
[Bell ringing]
- Attention, everyone.

1416
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:06,211
Maybe Dorothy would consent to recite
one of her little things for us.

1417
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:07,619
- Oh, great idea.

1418
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:13,753
- Well, maybe I'll just digest
my little supper and sing for it later.

1419
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:17,161
- Oh, please, Dorothy.
Something bilious for dessert.

1420
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:19,564
- No. Something bubbly, Mrs. Parker.

1421
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:22,728
- Something bubbly bilious.
- Double bubbly, but don't bill us.

1422
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:23,793
[Laughter]

1423
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:26,272
- One more drink,
and I'll be under the host.

1424
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:27,865
- Oh, please, Mrs. Parker.

1425
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:31,037
Do honour us
with one of your darling little poems.

1426
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,580
- Resume.

1427
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,586
Razors pain you,

1428
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:42,145
Rivers are damp,

1429
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:44,157
Acids stain you,

1430
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:46,887
And drugs cause cramp.

1431
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,862
Guns aren't lawful,

1432
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,955
Nooses give,

1433
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:52,966
Gas smells awful -

1434
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:55,434
You might as well live.

1435
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,476
- Another cheerful poem.

1436
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:05,513
- Bravo! Bravo!
[Scattered applause]

1437
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:13,749
- A fascinating woman.
- Nice going.

1438
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,519
- Dorothy!

1439
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:32,134
So, is it true
that you live in a rathole?

1440
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:34,198
- Oh, I like my apartment.

1441
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:37,676
It's just big enough to lay my hat
and a few friends.

1442
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:43,845
- Did you know my family's
in bird sanctuaries?

1443
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:45,579
It's true.

1444
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,348
Rather interesting.

1445
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:50,255
Let's say I buy a peacock for $5,

1446
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:53,192
throw it up in a tree,
and then charge,

1447
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:56,287
oh, any Tom Dick and Harry
$2 apiece just to...

1448
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:42,668
- Oh, don't worry,

1449
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,644
uh... Roger.

1450
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:46,646
I don't review rehearsals.

1451
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:52,584
Oh, God.

1452
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:59,814
Her mind lives
in a quiet room,

1453
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:02,982
A narrow room,
and tall,

1454
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:07,756
With pretty lamps
to quench the gloom

1455
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,525
And mottoes on the wall.

1456
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:14,830
There all the things
are waxen neat,

1457
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,565
And set in decorous lines,

1458
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:23,134
And there are posies,
round and sweet,

1459
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:26,703
And little straightened vines.

1460
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:29,614
Her mind lives tidily apart

1461
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:31,481
From cold
[thunder rumbling]

1462
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:34,351
And noise and pain,

1463
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:39,755
And bolts the door
against her heart,

1464
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:43,423
Out wailing in the rain.

1465
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:44,829
[Bell ringing]

1466
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:47,527
I think I was born
to live in a hotel.

1467
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:48,796
It helps me concentrate

1468
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,703
knowing I can just sign for things
whenever I need them.

1469
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:53,798
- Yes, it's wonderful.
But, of course,

1470
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:57,641
the bill always comes through
at the end of the month.

1471
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,771
I trust that won't be a problem.

1472
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:02,213
- Scout's honour.

1473
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:03,477
[Chuckling]

1474
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:07,817
- Well, I think this hotel's always
been very lucky for writers, Mrs. Parker.

1475
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:10,687
For example, do you have any idea

1476
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:14,023
how many important plays
have been written here?

1477
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:16,325
- Well, well, how fortunate.

1478
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,331
I'm working on a play.

1479
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,493
And if you're right, we won't have
to worry about the rent, now, will we?

1480
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:22,934
[Chuckling]
[Ringing]

1481
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:25,495
- I wouldn't go away from you
for anything!

1482
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,939
- There's nothing in the world...
- No, no. Stop, please.

1483
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:30,944
You mustn't move. Please!
- Stop! Stop!

1484
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:34,345
- You mustn't move on his speech!
- Oh, my! I can't work like this!

1485
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:36,975
- Dottie, don't you think
she ought to be wearing a brassiere?

1486
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:41,715
- Oh, God, no. We've got to have
something in this show that moves.

1487
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,554
- Good afternoon, Mr. Benchley.
- Hello.

1488
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:54,295
- Loved the play.
Let's hope it's a big financial success!

1489
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:56,929
- I owe him three months on the rent.

1490
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:59,439
- Well, at least
you got fantastic reviews.

1491
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:02,533
- Yes. And some were even
from total strangers.

1492
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,340
[Laughter]

1493
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:07,847
- Oh, I suppose it was dull.

1494
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:09,815
And you all have my apologies.

1495
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:14,317
But how can you know
about your own?

1496
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:15,720
You can't.

1497
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,623
- I want to know who decided to open it
two days before Christmas.

1498
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:20,058
- I hear your Mr. Benchley

1499
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,995
has taken up residence
at Polly Adler's brothel.

1500
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:26,363
Well, that is, of course,
when he's not with that little show girl.

1501
01:28:26,434 --> 01:28:28,834
Maybe it wouldn't hurt
to work that in.

1502
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:31,269
The play's about Benchley anyway,
isn't it, Dot?

1503
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:33,967
- Look on the bright side,
Dorothy...

1504
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:35,907
- Bobby.
- Hello.

1505
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,104
- My place has got your name
written all over it.

1506
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:40,875
- Thank you, Don. Thank you.

1507
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:43,917
Miss Hunt, how do you do?

1508
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,714
Miss Ferber.

1509
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,088
Well, when they laughed
at the mandolin duet,

1510
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,855
I wanted to bash their skulls in.

1511
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:56,726
[Chuckling]
- Could have used the French horn.

1512
01:28:56,798 --> 01:29:00,256
- I think it's more of a magnificent
tragedy than it is a comedy.

1513
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,929
It's a wonderful play and that's final.

1514
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,370
- I'm afraid so.

1515
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,466
We did a cool $90
at yesterday's matinee.

1516
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:11,068
Philip's closing it next week.
- What?!

1517
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:13,545
- Mr. Woollcott, we really have to clear
the room to prepare

1518
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:16,378
for the dinner service.
- Clear the room?!

1519
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:18,248
- Obviously has no taste.
- You imbecile!

1520
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:21,447
Do I look like a piece of furniture?
[Everyone]: Well, actually...

1521
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:24,218
An entire showroom.
- On a good day.

1522
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:25,418
[Laughing]

1523
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:28,951
- Let's go up to my room, everybody.
Coming, Fred?

1524
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,498
- I think I'II, uh,
catch up with you later.

1525
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:35,999
- At Polly's?

1526
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:38,504
- Why don't we say at Tony's,
Mrs. Parker?

1527
01:29:38,573 --> 01:29:40,700
- Thank you, sir.

1528
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:43,676
- Please, Mr. Benchley.
I've never been to a whorehouse.

1529
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:47,306
- Ah! Mrs. Parker...
it's not unlike the theatre,

1530
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,441
in many ways.

1531
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,747
Satisfied?

1532
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:54,549
- No.
[Chuckling]

1533
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:58,217
Never, I suppose.

1534
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:09,098
- "For Polly.
Long may she wave.

1535
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:10,933
Al Tennyson."

1536
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:13,473
- Yeah, Mr. Benchley?
That's very good.

1537
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:17,910
I prefer a real whorehouse
to the theatre.

1538
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:19,469
- Oh, yes.

1539
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:22,482
If a girl can't sing here,
she has the good manners to fake it.

1540
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:24,882
- What's the going rate?
- I like the looks of that one there.

1541
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:27,785
[Polly]: She's a guest.
- Well, so am I.

1542
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:30,221
- Oh, Bobby, are you going
to read to me again tonight?

1543
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:31,952
- Oh, another county heard from.

1544
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:34,722
Um, I'd like you
to meet my good friend,

1545
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:36,696
Mrs...
Oh! Mrs. Parker.

1546
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,761
Mrs. Parker...
[Polly]: Is she all right?

1547
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:43,963
- I think she should lie down.
Here we are.

1548
01:30:44,038 --> 01:30:47,166
- Yes, I think I hit my... ass.

1549
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:48,936
- Take her to the lavender room,
Coco.

1550
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:50,910
- Yes, Miss Adler.

1551
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:52,775
- I'm so sorry.
- It's right this way.

1552
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,542
- Maybe I should go up with her.

1553
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:56,947
I had medical training in the army,
you know.

1554
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:04,122
- Suspicions confirmed, Fred -

1555
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:06,456
I am a drunken whore.

1556
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:11,892
- You're an artist, Mrs. Parker.
Sometimes artists lose their balance.

1557
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,764
- Ah... I'm little Dorothy

1558
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:18,772
with the curse of the Rothschilds
hanging over her head.

1559
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,705
You're the artist, Mr. Benchley.

1560
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:23,403
- No, no, not me. Don't lay that on me.

1561
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:25,810
I've discovered
I have no real talent for writing.

1562
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,643
I can't quit
because I'm too famous.

1563
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:31,851
All right?

1564
01:31:35,356 --> 01:31:39,053
- You lean down here.
I want to check your temperature.

1565
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:16,793
- Get some rest, Mrs. Parker.

1566
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:20,232
- Mr. Benchley.

1567
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:23,961
- Yes, Mrs. Parker.

1568
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,903
- Oh!
[Chuckling]

1569
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:44,147
Christ.

1570
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,632
- Is Ross in?
- Yes, but he's engaged right now.

1571
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:56,670
You'll have to take a seat.
Excuse me, miss!

1572
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:58,898
...because I reject them.
Do it over again! Thurber's crazy.

1573
01:32:58,973 --> 01:33:01,635
You talk to him. Finally!
I've been wondering what happened to you.

1574
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:04,177
Do you have the article?
This was due on the third.

1575
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:07,078
- Somebody was using the pencil.

1576
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:10,208
- You look terrible, Dottie.
Have you not been sleeping?

1577
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:13,879
- Woodrow Wilson died.
- Yes, I heard. About a year ago.

1578
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:16,856
- Last week.
- You have me there.

1579
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:20,860
- This is not a charitable donation,
Ross. I'm fighting them off at the hotel,

1580
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:23,761
and my bank account is so overdrawn,
it's positively photographic.

1581
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:25,924
- You'll be paid eventually.
I promise.

1582
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,934
- Don't believe him, Dottie.
He owes me for years.

1583
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:29,970
- Jane, for Christ's sake, please.

1584
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:32,938
- Dottie, really, this is just wonderful.
- Herbert Spencer once said,

1585
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:36,465
"A genius can do readily what nobody else
can do at all." That's what I'm doing.

1586
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:39,138
I can't read this right now.
I've got a meeting in five minutes.

1587
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:41,147
- What a thing to be doing at my age,

1588
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:43,775
sitting around making up stories
about broken-hearted sissies.

1589
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:45,284
- Dottie, where are you going?

1590
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:06,997
- Mrs. Parker.

1591
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:12,011
I just wanted to see
if you still answered to that.

1592
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:20,117
- We are still married,
aren't we, Eddie?

1593
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:21,950
- I guess so.

1594
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:24,958
- I guess we ought to talk
about getting a divorce, then.

1595
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:26,584
- Not today.

1596
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,891
I'm feeling too good.
- Oh, is it catching?

1597
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:30,828
- Sure. Why not?

1598
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:35,059
- You look swell, Eddie.

1599
01:34:35,136 --> 01:34:36,467
- Do I really?

1600
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:38,937
- Truly.
- Thanks.

1601
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:42,339
You look beautiful.
- Oh, where the hell are you looking?

1602
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:45,140
- At you.
- No. I'm...

1603
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:46,804
lower than worms.

1604
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:51,647
I miss... feeling safe, Eddie.

1605
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:54,017
I do miss that.

1606
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:56,079
- Is that what we were?

1607
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:57,988
You could've fooled me.

1608
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:01,662
You're not going to cry, are you?

1609
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:08,658
- Woodrow died.
- Did he? I'm sorry.

1610
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:12,164
- I'm all alone again and broke.
See?

1611
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:17,033
- I'm flush.
Let me buy you a present.

1612
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:27,183
- Now you can buy me lunch
if you promise not to be very dull.

1613
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:31,683
- I'd love to, dear, but I can't.

1614
01:35:31,759 --> 01:35:35,286
I'm meeting someone
and I'm late.

1615
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:37,193
Another time, though.
I insist.

1616
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:40,927
- Actually, I'm meeting someone, too.

1617
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:43,026
- It's really been lovely seeing you.

1618
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:50,238
Dear...

1619
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:51,801
- Oh.

1620
01:35:54,281 --> 01:35:57,876
I do not like my state of mind.

1621
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:02,252
I'm bitter, querulous, unkind.

1622
01:36:03,824 --> 01:36:05,849
I hate my legs,

1623
01:36:05,926 --> 01:36:08,451
I hate my hands,

1624
01:36:08,529 --> 01:36:11,054
I do not yearn
for lovelier lands.

1625
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:14,363
I dread

1626
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,198
the dawn's recurrent light.

1627
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:19,501
I hate to go to bed at night.

1628
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:23,509
I snoot at earnest, simple folk.

1629
01:36:23,577 --> 01:36:26,410
I cannot take
the gentlest joke.

1630
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:31,915
I find no peace
in paint or type.

1631
01:36:31,986 --> 01:36:34,750
My world is but a lot of tripe.

1632
01:36:34,822 --> 01:36:38,189
I'm disillusioned,
empty-breasted.

1633
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:40,090
For what I think,

1634
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:42,061
I'd be arrested.

1635
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:45,724
I am not sick,

1636
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,360
I am not well.

1637
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:52,235
My quondam dreams
are shot to hell.

1638
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:54,774
My soul is crushed,

1639
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:58,039
My spirit sore.

1640
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:01,275
I do not like me anymore.

1641
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:04,813
I cavil, quarrel,

1642
01:37:04,885 --> 01:37:07,547
grumble, grouse.

1643
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:10,920
I ponder on the narrow house.

1644
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:16,122
I shudder at the thought of men.

1645
01:37:18,098 --> 01:37:21,795
[Bell ringing]
I'm due to fall in love again.

1646
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:26,270
- Well, I'll mention it
to her again, Mr. Case,

1647
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:29,207
but there really
isn't that much I can do.

1648
01:37:29,276 --> 01:37:31,176
It's a very difficult situation.

1649
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:34,608
- Dottie?

1650
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:40,286
I'd like to talk to you.
- Cheese it, the fuzz.

1651
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,549
- Mrs. Parker.

1652
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:45,148
Mrs. Parker!

1653
01:37:45,226 --> 01:37:46,955
- I don't know
how he's going to feel

1654
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:49,018
about an untrained puppy
piddling on his rugs.

1655
01:37:49,096 --> 01:37:51,621
He didn't like it much
when the trained one did.

1656
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:54,896
Plus, I have to write him
another IOU for the rent.

1657
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:59,463
- Well, they wouldn't throw you out.
You're good for too much publicity.

1658
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:02,270
- How was lunch?
Did they talk about me?

1659
01:38:02,343 --> 01:38:04,311
- Of course they talked about you.

1660
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:08,576
- Rex... learn to read, darling.

1661
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:14,483
It's time
to think about serious work.

1662
01:38:17,024 --> 01:38:19,424
Thinking is working, isn't it?

1663
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:21,859
- Of course it is.
It's the kind that I do best.

1664
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:24,261
Why don't you write a novel, dear?

1665
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:26,993
You could probably knock one off
in, say, 20 or 30 years.

1666
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:30,901
- Oh, yes, why not a novel?

1667
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:34,566
I put as much work into writing nonsense
as I do the things that matter,

1668
01:38:34,642 --> 01:38:37,668
and it's the nonsense
everybody notices.

1669
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,713
And you know what?

1670
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:41,577
By the time I'm paid
for what I do,

1671
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:44,743
the money's already gone.

1672
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:47,184
But you can dream on a book,
can't you?

1673
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:52,525
- Absolutely.

1674
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:55,118
- Have we ever touched?

1675
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:11,172
- Hello, Mrs. Parker.

1676
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:48,980
- What do you think
we should drink this one to, hmm?

1677
01:39:49,049 --> 01:39:51,074
How about to us?

1678
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:53,847
Yes, it's too bad
we don't look prettier.

1679
01:39:55,556 --> 01:39:59,390
We were pretty once,
though, weren't we? Mm?

1680
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:03,157
You might not think it matters,

1681
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:04,424
but I do.

1682
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:06,090
I'll tell you why.

1683
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:10,762
Because, my dear,
it all turns on that.

1684
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:14,069
All those little sags and...
[dog barking]

1685
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:16,439
- What is going on here?
- Yes, it's London Zoo.

1686
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:19,172
Listen. I've had enough.
I really have.

1687
01:40:19,246 --> 01:40:21,043
- Is that this woman's dog?!!!

1688
01:40:21,115 --> 01:40:22,446
- We've had these interruptions
on this set...

1689
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:26,350
- I did it.
[Yelling in Russian]

1690
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:28,581
- Very sorry.
- Nicotine pipsqueak. Listen, Sergei,

1691
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:32,386
this is not the steppes of Russia,
this is the United States of America.

1692

[Yelling in Russian]

1693
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:41,160
- So Zanuck says
give him a death scene.

1694
01:40:41,235 --> 01:40:43,760
That'll win an Oscar. I'm telling you,
this guy couldn't play dead

1695
01:40:43,837 --> 01:40:45,737
if you cremated him.
- Move over.

1696
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:47,740
- What's wrong, Dottie?
- Argh!

1697
01:40:47,808 --> 01:40:49,605
I never worked on a picture that I liked,

1698
01:40:49,676 --> 01:40:52,577
and I never worked on a picture
that liked me.

1699
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:53,977
- Dottie, I need a line.

1700
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,983
There's a guy standing on a ledge,
and his wife's got to say something.

1701
01:40:57,051 --> 01:41:01,181
- No, let her push the sonofabitch
without speaking. Over!

1702
01:41:01,255 --> 01:41:04,782
- Hey, Dottie, saw Alan on the lot this
morning, standing right beside wardrobe.

1703
01:41:04,858 --> 01:41:07,884
- Wearing a dress, no doubt.

1704
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:09,861
- Hi, Harry.
- Harry.

1705
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:12,524
- You guys
hear about Bob Benchley?

1706
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:14,965
Hi, Dottie.
- Hey, listen, Harry, I need a line.

1707
01:41:15,035 --> 01:41:18,300
- Forget about that.
Harry, what about Benchley?

1708
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:20,135
- He, uh, he died.

1709
01:41:22,342 --> 01:41:23,934
- You're kidding.

1710
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:25,638
How?

1711
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:28,442
- Cirrhosis of the liver,
hemorrhaging.

1712
01:41:28,515 --> 01:41:32,451
They say Marc Connelly ran around
the Stork Club looking for blood donors.

1713
01:41:32,519 --> 01:41:36,250
- God, Benchley.
I talked to him just before I left town.

1714
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:40,287
- Dottie...
- Oh, that's just dandy!

1715
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:48,391
Well, if it isn't Mr. Dorothy Parker.

1716
01:41:48,469 --> 01:41:51,461
- Hello, Dottie. Thought I might
as well get my things out of your way.

1717
01:41:51,538 --> 01:41:54,803
- What's in here?
This is mine, you shit!

1718
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:57,742
You queer! You can't use that anymore
and you know it.

1719
01:41:57,811 --> 01:42:00,405
- Oh, surely not because
of your wartime adventures in London.

1720
01:42:00,481 --> 01:42:03,382
- Everybody knows it's a lie, Dottie,
and so do you.

1721
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:06,385
- Just because you fucked another woman
doesn't make it all better.

1722
01:42:06,453 --> 01:42:08,045
- Goodbye, darling.

1723
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:12,422
- Oh, that's right, take your toys
and gallop away - sidesaddle!

1724
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:14,120
And don't forget to bore a hole

1725
01:42:14,194 --> 01:42:17,061
in the hobby-horse,
you fucking idiot!

1726
01:42:41,522 --> 01:42:42,989
Oh, Fred!

1727
01:42:45,926 --> 01:42:47,791
Dear Fred!

1728
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:51,327
You lovely...

1729
01:42:51,398 --> 01:42:53,229

The new year you ordered
is due shortly

1736
01:43:56,163 --> 01:43:58,529
and may be picked up
at the will-call desk.

1737
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:00,692
- Bob, where have you been
all evening?

1738
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:03,702
- Hello, Charlie!
Anyone seen my noisemakers?

1739
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:07,137
- Aleck, you are a noisemaker!
- Where are my damn noisemakers?

1740
01:44:07,207 --> 01:44:08,834
[Meowing]
- I think she likes you better.

1741
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:12,606
- Yes. Meow, too.

1742
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:16,547
- James, my stomach hurts.

1743
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:18,551
I like champagne,
but it doesn't like me.

1744
01:44:18,619 --> 01:44:21,087
- Oh, you're just being modest, Mary.

1745
01:44:21,154 --> 01:44:22,382
- Ha, ha, ha.

1746
01:44:22,456 --> 01:44:24,583
- A-are you nauseous, dear?

1747
01:44:24,658 --> 01:44:26,649
- My stomach.
- Your stomach.

1748
01:44:26,727 --> 01:44:29,457
- Well, pardon my pussy.

1749
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:31,463
[Aleck]: Everywhere I draw breath
is a social hall!

1750
01:44:31,531 --> 01:44:35,991
- Then go breathe somewhere else!
- Aleck, I'm sure Jane means...

1751
01:44:36,069 --> 01:44:39,527
Aleck!
- If you were a true gentleman, Aleck,

1752
01:44:39,606 --> 01:44:41,130
you'd pinch my ass!

1753
01:44:41,208 --> 01:44:44,006
- Aleck, please. What the hell?
Just calm down, please.

1754
01:44:44,077 --> 01:44:46,875
Will you please calm down, Aleck?
It's New Year's Eve.

1755
01:44:49,483 --> 01:44:51,974
[Aleck]: Didn't I give you a dollar
Tuesday?

1756
01:44:56,123 --> 01:45:00,355
- You know, Charlie,
I actually made-believe

1757
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:05,023
we'd be married someday.
I even decided what to wear.

1758
01:45:05,098 --> 01:45:07,430
- Ah, Jesus Christ, Dot!

1759
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:11,494
- A rather pinkish gray
with butterfly orchids.

1760
01:45:11,571 --> 01:45:14,631
- Your passion for unhappiness
is goddamn endless.

1761
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:20,139
- But you're fine, aren't you?

1762
01:45:20,213 --> 01:45:21,680
You're all well.

1763
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:26,018
- Just wish you wouldn't sentimentalize
all the time.

1764
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:33,523
- And I wish I never learned
to take off my clothes.

1765
01:45:49,843 --> 01:45:51,777
- Happy new year, Charlie.

1766

1767
01:45:54,581 --> 01:45:57,379
- Happy new year, John Peter.

- Harpo, you'll appreciate this.

running diagonally."

- Why would I ruin the night?
- You talk about quitting your job.

Oh, here.
Here, one of your friends.

1778
01:46:25,245 --> 01:46:27,839
Why don't you tell her about the fact
that you want to leave.

1779
01:46:27,914 --> 01:46:29,745
- Too late, Mary.

- What, he swallow a nut?

01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:37,648
- Have you been drinking, Ross?
- Heavily.

1784
01:46:37,724 --> 01:46:40,557
Don't for a minute
think I'm not incoherent, Bob.

1785
01:46:40,627 --> 01:46:43,824
- I would never not think that, no.
There you two are.

1786
01:46:43,897 --> 01:46:47,628
Toothing this comb with a fine...
- Put us back together, Dr. Benchley.

1787
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:50,295
We're broken into little bits.
- What seems to be the problem?

1788
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:54,170
Oh God! You, sir, appear pained enough
to have appeared in my column.

1789
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:57,074
- I suppose I should say something
amusing about leaving life.

1790
01:46:57,144 --> 01:46:58,168
- I wish you would.

1791
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:01,840
- But I'm afraid I don't find
any of this amusing anymore.

- Mr. Benchley.

- Mr. Sherwood.
- Mrs. Parker.

1796
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:20,892
- Where are you going, Robert?

1797
01:47:25,205 --> 01:47:28,174
Couldn't have stood another moment
of him looking at me,

1798
01:47:28,241 --> 01:47:31,438
thinking of what a public clown
I turned out to be.

1799
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:35,504
- Oh, Fred. That's not
what he was thinking at all.

1800
01:47:35,582 --> 01:47:37,072
- Hello.

1801
01:47:42,022 --> 01:47:43,922
- Bobby.
- Mademoiselle Gerard!

1802
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:45,582
Hmm-mm-mm!

1803
01:47:45,659 --> 01:47:47,752
How did it go?
- Great.

1804
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:52,020
Isn't he just the bee's knees, Dottie?

1805
01:47:52,098 --> 01:47:55,625
Did you miss me?
- Does the sun miss the stars?

1806
01:47:55,702 --> 01:47:58,102
Did Jackson Miss-issippi?
Cain miss Abel?

1807

we go wild tonight, huh?

1808
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:02,508

Christmas cheer?

1811
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,539
I try to worry, Mrs. Parker,

1812
01:48:08,615 --> 01:48:10,674
but I can't.

1813
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:12,479
- Isn't anybody happy?

1814
01:48:13,587 --> 01:48:15,350
- I feel sick to my stomach.

[Aleck]: Tolstoy?
I always found Tolstoy rather dreary.

1816

- Poor Alvan.

1817
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:23,162
- You're right,
Tolstoy isn't very cheerful.

1818
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:25,630
- And sentimental!
- Nor sentimental, for that matter.

1819
01:48:25,699 --> 01:48:29,430
- What's he written?
- He's a doctor, a psychotherapist.

1820
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:31,130
A good one, too, actually.

1821
01:48:31,204 --> 01:48:32,762
- Because of his understanding

1822
01:48:32,839 --> 01:48:37,333
of how pure sorrow
is no more possible than pure joy.

1823
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:41,710
- That's hardly reasonable!
[Everyone talking at once]

[Alvan]: Your friends don't care
for the Russians, I'm afraid.

1825
01:48:44,584 --> 01:48:47,075
- Come on, Doctor,

1826
01:48:47,153 --> 01:48:50,486
let's talk about
my sorrow and joy.

1827
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:52,855
You don't mind, do you, Paula?

1828
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:56,225
- Why, no.
- Well, at least I asked.

1829
01:48:56,296 --> 01:48:58,287
- I'm a-Freud of that man.
[Laughter]

1830
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:02,568
- Someone pay attention to me!

1831

[Chatting]

1832
01:49:11,511 --> 01:49:13,638
- My great fear

1833
01:49:13,713 --> 01:49:16,648
is being a bitter old woman
alone in her room,

1834
01:49:16,716 --> 01:49:19,412
who, despite all requests for rain,

1835
01:49:19,486 --> 01:49:23,115
will meet her maker
on a bright, sunny day.

1836
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:24,918
[Cracking nuts]

1837
01:49:26,693 --> 01:49:30,288
I don't know if this is a terrible
tragedy or a big fucking joke.

1838
01:49:37,637 --> 01:49:39,264
- Would you like a nut?

1839
01:49:39,339 --> 01:49:42,433
- Could you just close the door
on your way out? Please.

1840
01:49:46,146 --> 01:49:47,738
Oh, sit here.

1841
01:49:47,814 --> 01:49:49,441
Please.

1842
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,652
- Happy new year.

1843
01:50:09,536 --> 01:50:12,004
- Well...

1844
01:50:12,072 --> 01:50:14,040
what are you waiting for?

1845
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:17,843
Analyze.

1846
01:50:21,548 --> 01:50:24,574
- Analysis is a serious business.

1847
01:50:24,651 --> 01:50:26,585
- Would it help if I cried?

1848
01:50:26,653 --> 01:50:29,554
- One needs an office,
a certain amount of formality.

1849
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:32,490
- What if I put on a more expensive dress
and then cried?

1850
01:50:35,061 --> 01:50:37,723
- Well, it's safe to suggest
that you examine the need

1851
01:50:37,797 --> 01:50:40,561
you and your colleagues feel
to spend so much time together.

1852
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:44,070
- They're shits, really,
Except for Mr. Benchley.

1853
01:50:44,137 --> 01:50:46,901
- That's quite a thing to say
about your best friends.

1854
01:50:46,973 --> 01:50:48,440
[Shouting]

1855
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:54,035
- Please be sweet.

1856
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:56,947
Don't know
why I can't work anymore...

1857
01:50:58,518 --> 01:51:01,146
why life is so goddamned painful.

1858
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:07,524
- If we identify your inability to work
as the primary problem...

1859
01:51:07,594 --> 01:51:12,554
- It's a tossup, really, between that
and my inability to get laid.

1860
01:51:12,632 --> 01:51:16,227
- Then we ought to examine
how your energy is being spent instead.

1861
01:51:16,302 --> 01:51:19,635
- What else?
- Your drinking.

1862
01:51:19,706 --> 01:51:22,539
- Oh, it doesn't do me
much good anymore,

1863
01:51:22,609 --> 01:51:25,942
but that's about the extent of it.
- I have to disagree.

1864
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:29,106
- Well, maybe it's the bad whiskey
I've been getting.

1865
01:51:29,182 --> 01:51:32,015
May I say, the real stuff
never made me suffer.

1866
01:51:32,085 --> 01:51:34,383
- It's not what you're suffering,
Mrs. Parker.

1867
01:51:34,454 --> 01:51:36,046
It's what you're missing.

1868
01:51:36,122 --> 01:51:40,456
In my opinion, you and your friends
are missing a great deal.

1869
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:42,791
It's a sign of insecurity,

1870
01:51:42,862 --> 01:51:46,525
this compulsion
to be constantly with each other,

1871
01:51:46,599 --> 01:51:49,067
to be constantly entertaining, but
never discussing one subject for long,

1872
01:51:49,135 --> 01:51:50,727
never in-depth.

1873
01:51:50,804 --> 01:51:54,570
The serious side of your nature is lost.

1874
01:51:54,641 --> 01:51:57,075
Your purpose.

1875
01:51:57,143 --> 01:52:01,045
And then you can't write.

1876
01:52:01,114 --> 01:52:03,947
I think life is something more
than being able to breathe.

1877
01:52:07,087 --> 01:52:09,385
- Do I have to believe that
to feel better?

1878
01:52:12,859 --> 01:52:15,760
- Tell me about your mother.
She died when you were 5, correct?

1879
01:52:17,797 --> 01:52:22,291
- Actually, it was a month
before my fifth birthday.

1880
01:52:22,368 --> 01:52:24,734
Oh...

1881
01:52:24,804 --> 01:52:27,568
Sometimes I...

1882
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:32,168
I think I catch a bit of her voice...

1883
01:52:32,245 --> 01:52:35,009
her scent,

1884
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:37,572
something she once said.

1885
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:39,447
And then it...

1886
01:52:39,519 --> 01:52:41,077
slips away.

1887
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:46,454
Oh, I suppose she loved me
and kept me warm

1888
01:52:46,526 --> 01:52:48,824
and made sure
I ate roughage...

1889
01:52:51,564 --> 01:52:55,466
The truth is, I barely remember
a thing about her.

1890
01:52:56,903 --> 01:52:59,770
- There's no reason to be afraid.
It's good to remember.

1891
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:01,670
- But I'm not remembering.

1892
01:53:01,741 --> 01:53:05,040
I'm just guessing.

1893
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:07,705
I'm guessing everything.

1894
01:53:07,781 --> 01:53:10,249
It would be different, if only...

1895
01:53:10,316 --> 01:53:11,806
[sighing]

1896
01:53:11,885 --> 01:53:14,410
If only this, if only that.

1897
01:53:20,026 --> 01:53:21,288
- Where are you going, Dorothy?

1898
01:53:21,361 --> 01:53:23,158
- Um, I'm returning to my room.

1899
01:53:23,229 --> 01:53:25,356
My anxieties are waiting.
They miss me.

1900
01:53:25,431 --> 01:53:27,661
- You think that's a good idea?

1901
01:53:27,734 --> 01:53:31,500
- I... I like my room.
Everything I need is there.

1902
01:53:31,571 --> 01:53:35,473
- Don't you think you should stay here
until you face this pain more directly?

1903
01:53:36,676 --> 01:53:39,144
- Face it more directly?

1904
01:53:39,212 --> 01:53:42,045
Um, I face it every day.

1905
01:53:42,115 --> 01:53:45,607
I fall in love with married men,
but I do it on purpose.

1906
01:53:45,685 --> 01:53:49,177
I drink too much,
and that's because I'm thirsty.

1907
01:53:49,255 --> 01:53:53,487
And I write doodads because...

1908
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:55,528
it's a doodad kind of town.

1909
01:53:57,363 --> 01:53:59,092
It's, um...

1910
01:53:59,165 --> 01:54:01,497
nothing... personal, Doctor...

1911
01:54:02,602 --> 01:54:06,504
but I think my version of pain
is more fun than yours.

1912
01:54:09,576 --> 01:54:12,136
- You're up.

1913
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:13,975
- Mr. Kaufman.

1914
01:54:14,047 --> 01:54:16,572
I'm surprised to see you here.

1915
01:54:16,649 --> 01:54:18,583
- You, me, all of Manhattan,

1916
01:54:18,651 --> 01:54:21,484
and parts of Schenectady,
I'm sure.

1917
01:54:21,554 --> 01:54:23,818
Did she say anything about me?

1918
01:54:46,713 --> 01:54:48,305
- Just a little one...

1919
01:54:48,381 --> 01:54:49,609
while we're up.

1920
01:54:49,682 --> 01:54:52,651
<i>- My dear,
do let me congratulate you.</i>

1921
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:55,279
<i>You must be terribly proud and...</i>

1922
01:54:55,355 --> 01:54:57,186
- It's Dorothy Parker.
- Who?

1923
01:54:57,257 --> 01:54:59,919
- Dorothy Parker.
- Dorothy Parker, yeah, the writer.

1924
01:54:59,993 --> 01:55:03,087
I worked with her and her husband
in Hollywood a long time ago.

1925
01:55:03,162 --> 01:55:06,188
<i>They had just remarried.
[TV]: Somebody give me a drink!</i>

1926
01:55:06,266 --> 01:55:09,099
- You might've heard of her.
- But didn't she commit suicide?

1927
01:55:09,168 --> 01:55:10,362
- Jesus Christ.
- No, no, no.

1928
01:55:10,436 --> 01:55:12,904
- What? I'm just asking a question.
- She was very famous.

1929
01:55:12,972 --> 01:55:16,464
- For writing movies or for marrying
the same guy twice?

1930
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:20,444
- For having lunch, mostly.
[Laughing]

1931
01:55:20,513 --> 01:55:24,074
[Dorothy]: Is that a double?
- You didn't ask for a double, lady.

1932
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:26,482
- I didn't?

1933
01:55:26,552 --> 01:55:29,419
I meant to, I promise you.

1934
01:55:31,124 --> 01:55:32,989
- I'll get you another one.

1935
01:55:36,062 --> 01:55:39,088
- How about a little tummy rub?

1936
01:55:39,165 --> 01:55:42,794
Part of the romance of digestion.
[Woman]: Where are you going?

1937
01:55:42,869 --> 01:55:46,134
- I want you to meet her. Just for a
second. She's great, you'll love her.

1938
01:55:46,205 --> 01:55:48,969
Come here, just sit down.
Sit, sit. Go ahead, sit.

1939
01:55:49,042 --> 01:55:52,239
Mrs. Parker,
I hope we're not disturbing you.

1940
01:55:52,312 --> 01:55:53,870
- Well...
[laughing]

1941
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:55,778
- Do you remember me?

1942
01:55:55,848 --> 01:55:58,282
- Honey, I don't remember this morning.
[Laughing]

1943
01:56:00,219 --> 01:56:02,346
- I'm Fred Hunter.
I acted in a picture

1944
01:56:02,422 --> 01:56:06,825
that you and your husband,
Alan Campbell, wrote several years ago...

1945
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:09,293
Flight to Nowhere.

1946
01:56:09,362 --> 01:56:10,954
Well, I got cut out, but...

1947
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:13,464
- Honey, if I wrote it,
they cut me out too.

1948
01:56:13,533 --> 01:56:14,864
[Laughing]

1949
01:56:14,934 --> 01:56:16,993
- These are two friends of mine:
Marcy and June.

1950
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:18,970
This is Mrs. Parker,
Dorothy Parker.

1951
01:56:19,038 --> 01:56:23,407
Can we buy you a drink?
- Well, sure. Ha, ha, ha.

1952
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:26,604
- Can we get another drink here
for Mrs. Parker?

1953
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:29,671
I was just telling them
about the old Hollywood days,

1954
01:56:29,749 --> 01:56:30,807
and about your husband.

1955
01:56:30,883 --> 01:56:33,977
He was so, so nice to me
when we worked together.

1956
01:56:34,053 --> 01:56:36,749
- I don't doubt it.

1957
01:56:36,823 --> 01:56:39,189
Unhappily...
Oh, I beg your pardon.

1958
01:56:39,258 --> 01:56:41,749
Happily,
I'm away from Hollywood now,

1959
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:44,661
<i>and I don't have to hear
about that crap.</i>

1960
01:56:44,731 --> 01:56:47,700
[Laughter]
- Whatever happened to that director?

1961
01:56:47,767 --> 01:56:50,702
What was his name? I can't remember...
- He went to jail,

1962
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:54,365
for being an American
in the US of A.

1963
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:58,342
- Oh, really. Jail?
Oh, you mean because of the...

1964
01:56:58,411 --> 01:57:00,208
Right.
- Thank you.

1965
01:57:00,279 --> 01:57:02,804
- Thank you. Did you, uh...

1966
01:57:02,882 --> 01:57:05,612
I mean...
- Oh, no, no, dear.

1967
01:57:05,685 --> 01:57:09,621
But I bought a new hat, just in case.
[Laughing]

1968
01:57:09,689 --> 01:57:12,522
- Well, there's plenty of money
in Hollywood to buy things with.

1969
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:15,356
- Oh, Hollywood money isn't real.

1970
01:57:15,428 --> 01:57:19,023
It's like... Well, I don't know
what the money is like.

1971
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:22,090
It's like small ice in your hand.

1972
01:57:22,168 --> 01:57:25,626
- We got... we got to go.
- Oh, okay, great.

1973
01:57:25,705 --> 01:57:28,435
Mrs. Parker,
we're on our way to a movie.

1974
01:57:28,508 --> 01:57:29,873
Would you like to join us?

1975
01:57:29,942 --> 01:57:32,308
- Why were you just asking me
about Hollywood?

1976
01:57:32,378 --> 01:57:36,041
Honey, the thing has come down on me
like a curtain,

1977
01:57:36,115 --> 01:57:38,583
and I don't want
to remember those things.

1978
01:57:38,651 --> 01:57:40,585
Why are you trying
to split these curtains to me,

1979
01:57:40,653 --> 01:57:43,417
just a nice woman
trying to talk to you?

1980
01:57:43,489 --> 01:57:45,184
- I'm sorry...
[woman]: We're going to be late.

1981
01:57:45,258 --> 01:57:47,658
- Okay, all right, great.

1982
01:57:47,727 --> 01:57:50,389
Well, anyway...
- Fred...

1983
01:57:50,463 --> 01:57:53,489
Always late.

1984
01:57:53,566 --> 01:57:58,094
Someone said they'd have to keep
heaven open after hours for him.

1985
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:01,800
[Chuckling]

1986
01:58:01,874 --> 01:58:04,069
- Well, Mrs. Parker,
it's a pleasure to see you.

1987
01:58:04,143 --> 01:58:05,770
You look, uh...

1988
01:58:05,845 --> 01:58:07,437
It's nice to see you.

1989
01:58:15,655 --> 01:58:19,489
- Well...

1990
01:58:19,559 --> 01:58:23,154
A dependable fact-of-life cliche -

1991
01:58:23,229 --> 01:58:27,325
everything's always worse
than you thought it would be.

1992
01:58:47,587 --> 01:58:49,452
[Man]: We are here
to honour Dorothy Parker,

1993
01:58:49,522 --> 01:58:52,787
because the clean wit of her verse

1994
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:55,384
and the sharp perceptions
in her stories

1995
01:58:55,461 --> 01:58:59,090
have produced
a brilliant record of our times.

1996
01:58:59,165 --> 01:59:01,463
Because of Mrs. Parker's true talent,

1997
01:59:01,534 --> 01:59:04,298
her early work gives us
as much pleasure today

1998
01:59:04,370 --> 01:59:07,362
as it did 30 years ago.

1999
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:09,169
And so...
[Dorothy]: What horse shit.

2000
01:59:09,242 --> 01:59:10,971
With apologies to the horses.

2001
01:59:11,043 --> 01:59:13,807
[Man]: Happily names Dorothy Parker

2002
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:18,317
as this year's recipient
of the Marjorie Peabody Waite Award

2003
01:59:18,384 --> 01:59:21,012
for achievement and integrity.

2004
01:59:21,087 --> 01:59:22,486
[Applause]

2005
01:59:54,387 --> 01:59:56,912
- I never thought I'd make it.

2006
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:33,491
[Up-beat jazz music playing]
[Laughter]

2007
02:00:40,533 --> 02:00:42,797
[People chatting]

2008
02:01:48,234 --> 02:01:50,464
- Do you miss
the glamour of the jazz age?

2009
02:01:50,536 --> 02:01:54,700
- Glamour? They ought to call it
the Dingy Decade.

2010
02:01:54,774 --> 02:01:59,006
- What disturbs you most
about American culture, Mrs. Parker?

2011
02:01:59,078 --> 02:02:01,638
- Stupidity, intolerance,

2012
02:02:01,714 --> 02:02:05,616
and segregation -
particularly segregation.

2013
02:02:05,685 --> 02:02:10,247
- Is it true that you were
involved in the Spanish Civil War?

2014
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:13,087
- Why do we have to go into that?
Yes, I was!

2015
02:02:13,159 --> 02:02:17,186
Indeed, I should like to say

2016
02:02:17,263 --> 02:02:20,721
it was the proudest thing
I've ever been of.

2017
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,859
I was, for a time,

2018
02:02:22,935 --> 02:02:27,167
with the proudest people
I've ever been of.

2019
02:02:27,239 --> 02:02:30,697
And that doesn't hurt you,
you know.

2020
02:02:30,776 --> 02:02:33,438
- What do you think of Kerouac
and the Beat Generation writers?

2021
02:02:33,512 --> 02:02:37,846
- Well, you'll... you'll take 'em.

2022
02:02:37,917 --> 02:02:41,785
Well, I think this... this thing
of the Beat Generation -

2023
02:02:41,854 --> 02:02:44,584
do you mind? -
I think it's perfect nonsense,

2024
02:02:44,657 --> 02:02:48,184
and I think in a couple of years,
they'll be forgotten.

2025
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:51,252
But, us, messy as we were

2026
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:53,855
and all that,
we're not going to be forgotten,

2027
02:02:53,933 --> 02:02:56,299
because some of us
came out of it.

2028
02:02:56,369 --> 02:02:58,929
There came out Benchley.
There came out Fitzgerald.

2029
02:02:59,004 --> 02:03:01,063
There came out Hemingway.
There came out Broun.

2030
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:03,040
There came out Sherwood.

2031
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:05,304
Well, for heaven's sweet sake,

2032
02:03:05,378 --> 02:03:07,812
who's coming out of the Beatniks?

2033
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:11,043
All right, Kerouac.
All right, all right, all right.

2034
02:03:11,117 --> 02:03:12,607
[Laughing]
- Have you thought

2035
02:03:12,685 --> 02:03:16,314
about what you'd like to have written
on your tombstone, Mrs. Parker?

2036
02:03:16,389 --> 02:03:21,292
- What a morbid thing to ask a person.

2037
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:25,228
You've just stolen my heart.

2038
02:03:25,297 --> 02:03:29,825
Actually, I have composed
something for my epitaph.

2039
02:03:29,902 --> 02:03:32,564
Something memorable, I hope.

2040
02:03:32,638 --> 02:03:34,538
- Well, I'm not a bit surprised.

2041
02:03:34,607 --> 02:03:37,132
Are you going
to let me know what it is?

2042
02:03:39,879 --> 02:03:41,813
[Whispering]

2043
02:03:46,819 --> 02:03:49,913
- Come here, dear.
Off we go.

2044
02:03:52,358 --> 02:03:54,883
Excuse me.

2045
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:56,723
- What did she say?

2046
02:03:56,796 --> 02:03:59,264
[Up-beat jazz music playing]
