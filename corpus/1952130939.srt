1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,838
The latest serum
has surpassed expectations.

2
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:48,846
The test subject
has grown five times normal size...

3
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:53,226
...within days of the serum
being introduced into its system.

4
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:03,363
But the only known side effect
is aggressive behaviour...

5
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:07,951
...that requires constant feeding
to maintain a higher metabolic rate.

6
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:11,288
For now, constant sedation
of the subject is needed...

7
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:14,083
...but the results are very promising.

8
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:33,187
Regeneration only occurs...

9
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:37,984
...when there is immediate introduction
of the serum into the wounded area.

10
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:52,834
My past attempts
to save older decomposed...

11
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:56,421
...or severely damaged tissue
have failed.

12
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,660
The latest genetic modifications
to the black-orchid strain...

13
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:05,248
...have had the predicted effect
on the serum extract.

14
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:08,251
The serum now successfully
provides the apparent benefit...

15
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:11,254
...of halting decomposition
of living tissue.

16
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:14,049
This, of course,
would rev olutionise medicine...

17
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:16,552
...if properly applied.

18
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:50,656
Mr. Murdoch is expecting you.
Right this way, sir.

19
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,919
Come in.

20
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,596
Sir, sorry to disturb you.
Mr. Eugene has arrived.

21
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:14,892
- Send him in.
- Right away, sir.

22
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:19,689
Come in, please.

23
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:24,569
Sir.

24
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:29,157
There's a briefcase over there.
Have a look inside.

25
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:35,915
That's $1 million.

26
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:39,252
It's yours if you'll do a little job
for me.

27
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,964
- I'm listening.
- Sit.

28
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,679
There's a cottage
in a forest not far from here...

29
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:52,391
...where an employee of mine has been
conducting certain experiments...

30
00:05:52,558 --> 00:05:56,604
...the outcome of which
may be beneficial to my health.

31
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,398
But here's the thing.

32
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:02,277
We've lost contact with him.
He appears to have disappeared.

33
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:07,992
- His experiments were successful?
- I believe so.

34
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,998
I believe he created a new hybrid
of the blood orchid...

35
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,752
...extracted a serum from it,
and that the serum works.

36
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,671
And that's why he's gone missing...

37
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,133
...because he has found
another employer.

38
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,595
Now, I want you
to collect all the plant material...

39
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,265
...the serum, all his research notes.

40
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,102
- Find him and kill him.
- Just one man?

41
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,812
I should warn you...

42
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,567
...that some say he's one
of the smartest men on the planet.

43
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:40,028
He may have one or two tricks
up his sleeve.

44
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:44,658
This is a lot of money for one man.

45
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:49,246
I have invested over $50 million
in this project...

46
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:52,041
...and the returns
could be incalculable.

47
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:57,505
I want results
no matter what the cost.

48
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:00,759
One other thing.

49
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:07,141
There's a photo of a girl in there
who is also involved with the project.

50
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,562
She knows too much.

51
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:12,981
Should she cross your path...

52
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:15,192
...remove her from the equation.

53
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,486
It would be my pleasure.

54
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,282
That's what I wanted to hear.

55
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,120
One other thing.

56
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:30,584
Time is of the essence.

57
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:35,589
I have bone cancer.

58
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:39,719
Without this little concoction...

59
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:43,098
...I would be dead within the week.

60
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,308
And that new serum
might change that?

61
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:50,522
Well, that is my hope.

62
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,535
Until I see you, sir.

63
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,121
Good hunting.

64
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:45,608
How the heck
am I supposed to read this?

65
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,292
Hey, you.

66
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:41,379
You lost?

67
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:46,634
Oh, no, no, it's okay, we're...
They're officers.

68
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:50,973
Well, I got a little turned around.
The map's in Romanian.

69
00:10:51,682 --> 00:10:55,770
You know, I saw something out there.
Something big.

70
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:59,566
Wait, you see it or hear it?

71
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:01,359
Both.

72
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,281
All right, well,
why don't you just stick with us, okay?

73
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,704
So, what's your story?

74
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,332
I spend the summers
with my grandmother.

75
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:17,585
She lives in a town nearby.
Are you guys all cops?

76
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:19,671
I'm not. I study flowers.

77
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:23,258
Flowers?
And you have two cops with you?

78
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:25,761
What are you doing out here?

79
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:29,682
Well, I'm studying for a career
in palaeopathology.

80
00:11:30,308 --> 00:11:33,645
People in town told me there was a dig
going on in these mountains...

81
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:35,313
...so I wanted to check it out.

82
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:39,151
- Palaeo- what?
- The study of human ancient remains.

83
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:42,196
Yeah, it's okay,
my friends don't understand it either.

84
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:45,366
Wait. Wait a sec.

85
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:49,871
- You hear that?
- No.

86
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:53,333
When the forest goes quiet,
there's a predator near.

87
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,294
- Come on.
- Are you serious?

88
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:57,213
- What's your name again?
- Alex.

89
00:11:58,464 --> 00:11:59,632
I'm Amanda.

90
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,343
You know,
you really shouldn't be out here alone.

91
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,891
What the hell is that?

92
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:13,773
Listen, you guys, we're too exposed.
We need to take cover. Come on.

93
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:15,692
Yeah.

94
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,321
So I'm working this dig with
this hotshot Ph. D. Who's on sabbatical.

95
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,741
And he starts yapping to me
about his new methodology...

96
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,078
...and how he's developed a tool
that allows him to dig faster...

97
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,205
...without damaging any artefacts.

98
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,084
He also tells me
the way we do it is prehistoric...

99
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,086
...and nobody does it that way
anymore.

100
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,296
So?

101
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,590
- So I'm not done yet.
- "I'm not done yet. "

102
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,760
So hotshot,
he drags me over to his site.

103
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,762
He hops down in the hole...

104
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,808
...and he immediately proceeds
to chop off two of his fingers...

105
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:47,644
...with this brand-new tool of his.

106
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:50,480
That's a bit of a morbid story there,
Jackson.

107
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,066
I was a little shocked myself.

108
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,235
I did ask
if he was gonna leave fingers...

109
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:58,030
...for future generations to uncover.

110
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,284
You were jealous
he could out-dig you.

111
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:05,038
Well, I don't know about that, but he
can count to three faster than me.

112
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:08,917
All right, come on, guys, let's focus.
We're not too far away.

113
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:10,920
You know, if what they say is true...

114
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:14,590
...this could be one of the most
important discoveries on the continent.

115
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,176
Roland, any news on your brother
or Team 1?

116
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,054
No, haven't heard anything yet.

117
00:13:27,897 --> 00:13:30,233
Heather, nice tunes, honey.

118
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,819
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah.

119
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:40,327
I can't help it.
I am a slave to the rhythm.

120
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:42,413
I am a slave to the rhythm.

121
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,500
I wanna take my clothes off.
I wanna...

122
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,877
I wanna touch your body.

123
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:12,488
Great. That's the last thing we need.

124
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:15,533
Any way around it?

125
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:19,454
- Let me look.
- Anyone pack a chain saw?

126
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:23,542
- Well, we can use the rock chisels.
- Yeah, and we'd be here for days.

127
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,129
No, no, this is the only route
to the base camp.

128
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:28,339
Can we go off-road?

129
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:33,136
I don't know.

130
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:38,141
Yeah, we could go off.
We're not gonna get back on.

131
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:40,185
All right, let's break it down.

132
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:42,396
We haven't heard from Team 1
in two days.

133
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:45,566
From the looks of this log,
they didn't come through here.

134
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:48,319
We've had no radio,
no cell-phone communication.

135
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:52,824
- Guess what, guys. We're walking.
- Are you crazy?

136
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:56,286
- Jackson, it's five miles, man.
- We're walking, Heather.

137
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:57,705
- Okay.
- Okay, listen up.

138
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:00,791
Grab your packs and travel light.
We'll get to Team 1.

139
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,629
In the morning, we'll come back,
use the equipment to move this tree.

140
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:07,048
- Jackson.
- Yeah?

141
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:08,550
Why don't you head out now?

142
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,096
We'll hunt the rest of the gear
and we'll meet you halfway.

143
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:14,432
- All right.
- Okay.

144
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,436
- It's getting dark pretty fast.
- Well, let's move.

145
00:15:20,897 --> 00:15:22,691
Hey. Did you see that?

146
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:26,612
- What?
- Did you hear?

147
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:30,825
What?

148
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:37,207
Hey, your eyes
are playing tricks on you.

149
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:40,252
Come on. It's been a long drive.

150
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:43,464
Let's get the rest of the gear
out of Jackson's Jeep.

151
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:52,265
Hey, Alex, let's go check this out.

152
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,062
- Vasile, you guys stay out here.
- Okay.

153
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:03,569
- Want a flashlight?
- I've got one.

154
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:14,790
Oh, my God,
I can't believe he did this.

155
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,295
Flowers.

156
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,383
No, you don't understand.
I've been looking for these flowers.

157
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,386
Hybrids, probably twice the potency.

158
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,224
Get back.

159
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:34,562
Here, you know how to use this?

160
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,239
- That was just the wind, right?
- Maybe.

161
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:53,583
- What the hell are you doing?
- Don't ask questions.

162
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,669
You're gonna blow this place up?

163
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,132
- Do you know how to use that stuff?
- I know what I'm doing.

164
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:03,302
Put an end to these flowers,
hopefully, I'll put an end to it.

165
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:06,014
- An end to what?
- How'd you get here?

166
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,682
- My Jeep, why?
- We'll need it.

167
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,727
We've gotta get about a 100 yards
before I blow this place...

168
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:19,153
Let's go, come on.

169
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,993
Move. Get in front of me. Move.

170
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,746
- What about your friends?
- They're probably dead.

171
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,957
- Amanda, what the hell is going on?
- Just...

172
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:32,251
You have no idea. Just keep moving.

173
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:51,356
Keep going, kid. I'm right behind you.

174
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:23,291
- Where the hell were you?
- Right here.

175
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,126
Come on, there's a way out.

176
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:44,648
Amanda.

177
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:47,985
Amanda.

178
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:51,364
Don't worry, I'll get help.

179
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,159
If the forest goes quiet,
there's a predator near.

180
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:54,475
Hey.

181
00:20:59,815 --> 00:21:01,024
Hello?

182
00:21:03,026 --> 00:21:04,778
Hello?

183
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,835
Guys?

184
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:35,354
Is there anybody here?

185
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:58,505
Oh, God.

186
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:07,139
- Where the hell is Jackson?
- Probably lost.

187
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,934
- I'll kill him if he is.
- Wait, wait, wait.

188
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:11,519
- What?
- I've got movement.

189
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:13,438
- Where?
- Over there.

190
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,026
I don't see anything.

191
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:21,405
Okay, I'm gonna check it out.

192
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:24,742
- You brought a gun?
- I'll come with you.

193
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:27,453
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Don't worry.

194
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,831
We're just gonna check it out.

195
00:22:41,386 --> 00:22:44,472
- What are you doing, man?
- Hey, it's Jackson, it's me.

196
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:47,309
- Jackson.
- Jackson.

197
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:51,146
- What happened to you?
- What happened?

198
00:22:51,313 --> 00:22:53,774
- What's wrong?
- They're dead.

199
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,777
- Who's dead?
- What do you mean, dead?

200
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:58,071
- Who's dead?
- Team 1. They're all dead.

201
00:22:58,238 --> 00:23:00,532
Man, we've gotta get out of here.

202
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:03,702
- Who's dead exactly?
- What do you mean?

203
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:08,499
I didn't stop and check their wallets.
Whatever killed them is still out there.

204
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,543
- Let's go. We gotta go.
- Just calm down.

205
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,255
- We're too far. Let's get to base camp.
- They are dead at base camp!

206
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:16,842
Will you calm down five seconds?

207
00:23:17,008 --> 00:23:20,304
Look, we're too far in.
We'll get to base camp.

208
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:23,599
At the least, we'll get their vehicles,
get a satellite phone...

209
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:25,893
...and send out
an emergency broadcast.

210
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,146
- You're wrong.
- I'm right. We're too far in.

211
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:29,522
- Now let's move.
- Come on.

212
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:31,107
No.

213
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:33,318
- Come on.
- Come on, let's go.

214
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:37,031
Come on.

215
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:41,744
Everyone stay together.

216
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,784
Listen up, ladies.

217
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:20,954
These are the targets:
Peter, Amanda.

218
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:30,173
Come on, Sal, join the club. All right.

219
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,925
He's in a cottage near here.

220
00:24:32,092 --> 00:24:34,344
We find him,
we get what we're looking for...

221
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:35,596
...we clean house.

222
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:38,098
She is classified "shoot on sight. "

223
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:40,810
- What a waste.
- Yes, indeed.

224
00:24:41,018 --> 00:24:42,937
Be careful, do as I say...

225
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:46,399
...and with any luck,
we'll be out of the forest by daybreak.

226
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:48,443
Come on, gentlemen.

227
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:53,741
Looks like we've got company.

228
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,919
- This fire's at least a day old.
- They're gone. The bodies are gone.

229
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,005
- There's nothing missing.
- That's a good thing, right?

230
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,926
- Maybe.
- Like hell it is.

231
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,845
Hey. Hey.

232
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:15,723
There were bodies here today.
I saw them.

233
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,518
Now, what about that is not sinking in
with you people?

234
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,812
Jackson, nobody's saying you didn't.

235
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,983
For all we know, Team 1
could've been transporting the bodies.

236
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,776
Oh, come on.

237
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,696
It wouldn't take the whole group
to take them.

238
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:31,157
Somebody would be here.
They're not out working.

239
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:33,368
They don't have equipment
to work at night.

240
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:37,206
- Where are they, huh? Where?
- Then we have to go looking for them.

241
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:40,709
- The site is up that hill.
- And we will, but not until sunup.

242
00:25:40,876 --> 00:25:44,047
Not tonight.
We'll be no good to them if we get lost.

243
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:45,924
- I'll go alone.
- You go, we all go.

244
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,550
But let me tell you something.

245
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:49,386
If there is something out there...

246
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:52,139
...chances are,
it'll have the advantage at night.

247
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:55,017
- True.
- Tonight we all play it safe.

248
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:58,479
We stay in one hut,
and we rotate lookouts.

249
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:05,362
I know what I saw.

250
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:49,060
Jackson.

251
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:51,855
Jackson.

252
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:29,563
- Hey.
- You scared me.

253
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,941
I think I saw something out there.

254
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:34,277
- Where?
- I don't know, there.

255
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:35,862
I must be hearing things.

256
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,157
You see anything?

257
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,414
No. I know, I know.
I should have stayed inside.

258
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,377
I don't know.

259
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,051
Look, I don't know
what's going on here...

260
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:58,679
...but I know what I saw today.

261
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:04,018
And I got a pretty good idea of what
we're gonna find at the site tomorrow.

262
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:07,606
And I don't want you
to be a part of that.

263
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:12,444
Tomorrow I want you and Wendy
to take the van and go back down.

264
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:14,530
Oh, come on, why?
Because we're girls?

265
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:18,826
No, no, not because you're girls.
Listen, this isn't some kind of contest.

266
00:29:18,993 --> 00:29:21,246
- Yeah, but...
- Hey.

267
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:23,915
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

268
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:28,879
I care about you too much.

269
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:43,771
Remind me again,
why do we have to keep this a secret?

270
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:46,232
You know what? We don't.

271
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,735
- We don't, right?
- No.

272
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:53,365
- What?
- Something bit me.

273
00:29:54,408 --> 00:29:56,869
- Something bit me.
- What?

274
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:00,414
- Oh, man, something nailed you.
- It stings.

275
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:03,251
- You okay?
- Yeah, it just stings.

276
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:07,672
- Let's go in and get something on that.
- Yes, clean it out.

277
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,384
What was it? You got any idea?

278
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,930
You all right?

279
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:17,016
Not really.

280
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:12,452
Alex.

281
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:15,414
Alex?

282
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,420
Alex.

283
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:39,357
Oh, my God,
I can't believe he did this.

284
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:14,480
Hey.

285
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,567
Hey there.

286
00:32:19,277 --> 00:32:21,112
You okay?

287
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,783
Not so good, no.

288
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:29,371
- Let's do this.
- Do what?

289
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,792
Heather,
you were bitten by a hobo spider.

290
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,461
They're poisonous,
but they're not deadly.

291
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:40,383
- Well, it hurts.
- I know it does, honey.

292
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:44,596
- But it'll pass, I promise.
- Yeah, well, it better.

293
00:32:50,228 --> 00:32:53,815
The area around the bite
is filled with poison.

294
00:32:56,067 --> 00:33:00,572
I'm gonna make a tiny incision
to drain it out.

295
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:03,075
It'll make your fever drop
much quicker.

296
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:07,413
- You know what you're doing, right?
- Yeah.

297
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,250
- I know what I'm doing.
- You ready?

298
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:12,878
As I'll ever be.

299
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:14,630
Okay.

300
00:33:15,422 --> 00:33:16,882
Okay.

301
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:19,051
Come on. Come on.

302
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:28,061
- Here.
- Thanks.

303
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:35,152
You're okay, you're okay.

304
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:38,531
Okay, hang on, hang on.

305
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:44,079
Okay, okay. Easy, easy.

306
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,749
It's okay, it's okay.

307
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,381
Hold still, hold still, hold still.

308
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,596
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

309
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:14,196
How is she?

310
00:34:14,363 --> 00:34:17,616
- She's fine, honey.
- Oh, thank God.

311
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:21,412
- Got a cup of coffee?
- No, but you can have mine.

312
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:24,999
- Oh, you're a doll. Cheers.
- No problem.

313
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:30,380
- Hey.
- Hey.

314
00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:36,345
Listen, we're gonna go
to the excavation site...

315
00:34:36,512 --> 00:34:38,139
...see if we can find anyone.

316
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:40,141
Wendy's gonna stay here with you,
okay?

317
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:41,684
Okay.

318
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:44,062
I'm gonna leave this radio.

319
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:47,316
If you need to talk to me
for any reason, you call, okay?

320
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:49,652
I'm on channel three.

321
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:53,573
They've got it. Let's go.

322
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:57,118
Keep an eye on your temperature.

323
00:34:57,327 --> 00:34:59,871
If it goes above a 102,
you're gonna call me.

324
00:35:00,038 --> 00:35:02,082
Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry.

325
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:05,878
- You're gonna call me, right?
- Don't worry.

326
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,259
Listen, you be careful out there,
okay?

327
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:13,553
Yeah.

328
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:33,242
I don't know what we're gonna find...

329
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:36,287
...but I'd be prepared for the worst.

330
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:40,541
Yeah. For Roland's sake,
I hope you're wrong.

331
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,478
Great.

332
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:10,908
Wendy?

333
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:16,623
Wendy?

334
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,045
Oh, great.

335
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,347
Wendy?

336
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:56,609
The site should be just over there
to the right somewhere.

337
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:58,278
Where'd you get that?

338
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,321
- What, the map?
- Yeah.

339
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,617
Found it in one of the huts.
Team 1 must have made it.

340
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:06,912
- It's not much further, right?
- Shouldn't be.

341
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,834
Look, I know you're worried
about your brother.

342
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:14,420
And I wish there was something
I could do.

343
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:17,424
He's okay. I would feel it if he wasn't.

344
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:20,177
Roland, Jackson, get over here.

345
00:38:47,082 --> 00:38:50,752
Oh, my God. Jackson! Scott!

346
00:38:56,926 --> 00:38:59,012
Oh, God.

347
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:55,683
Come on, you big bag of slime.

348
00:42:06,177 --> 00:42:07,345
Oh, no.

349
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:28,911
- Run! It's behind you!
- I know. Go. Run, come on.

350
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:40,507
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

351
00:42:45,721 --> 00:42:48,182
Came from somewhere over there.

352
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:50,393
Roland.

353
00:42:54,648 --> 00:42:56,525
Move out, move out.

354
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,075
Listen,
I think there's a clearing up ahead.

355
00:43:14,378 --> 00:43:16,839
- Son of a...
- What is that?

356
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:22,846
I didn't sign on for this.

357
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:30,896
What the...?

358
00:43:32,815 --> 00:43:35,443
Those people
are never gonna make it.

359
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:38,780
I gotta do something.

360
00:43:38,947 --> 00:43:40,741
- Roland, get back here.
- Roland, no.

361
00:43:40,908 --> 00:43:42,409
- Jackson...
- Roland, get back.

362
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:44,078
- Jackson, no.
- Roland!

363
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:45,788
Jackson, wait!

364
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,543
- God, get off me.
- Roland!

365
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:52,295
- Roland!
- Back, back.

366
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,382
No, don't go, don't go.
What are you, crazy?

367
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,384
- Come on, get back here.
- Turn around.

368
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,221
Roland! Roland, no!

369
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,904
No!

370
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:23,788
That's Amanda. Take her out.

371
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:26,458
There's nothing we can do. Come on.

372
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,129
- It's coming.
- Go, go, run. Run!

373
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:34,509
What about that thing out there?

374
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:37,554
If it attacks, we engage.

375
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:39,472
Move.

376
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,433
Wait, let's split up.

377
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,228
Okay, you, come with me.
You guys go that way.

378
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:46,522
Go, go, go.

379
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:23,229
Jeez, Wendy, where were you?

380
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:26,233
- I heard somebody back there.
- Yeah, I heard somebody too.

381
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,193
- I thought it was you.
- Are you okay?

382
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,905
Yeah, I'm fine, I just woke up and...

383
00:45:31,113 --> 00:45:33,324
- Oh, God.
- Patrick!

384
00:45:38,496 --> 00:45:39,748
Oh, my God.

385
00:45:39,956 --> 00:45:41,583
- Oh, my God, Patrick.
- Patrick.

386
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:45,629
Don't say anything. Just relax.
Don't speak, don't try anything.

387
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,342
Try to tie his wound or something.
Oh, my God.

388
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,260
- Stay calm.
- Try and tie his wound.

389
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:53,680
Heather, we need Scott.
Get Scott. We need him.

390
00:45:53,847 --> 00:45:57,601
- I'll go get Scott. I'll call him.
- Hurry, we need him right now.

391
00:45:57,768 --> 00:46:00,270
- Wait.
- Hold on, we're getting help.

392
00:46:01,146 --> 00:46:03,691
- Just relax, calm down.
- Scott, we need you here.

393
00:46:03,858 --> 00:46:07,695
We've got Patrick here. He's injured.
We need you. We're not trained for this.

394
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:10,615
Oh, my God. Patrick... Scott.

395
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:13,827
Scott, please come in, please.
Oh, my God.

396
00:46:14,036 --> 00:46:17,915
Come on, he's behind us, I know it.
He's coming.

397
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:23,087
- Okay, we'll confuse it.
- He's coming, I know he's coming.

398
00:46:23,296 --> 00:46:25,590
Go left, go left. We'll confuse it.

399
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:42,734
Wait for the girl. She's the target.

400
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:47,197
There.

401
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:55,832
Get down.

402
00:47:12,642 --> 00:47:14,019
Life is hard, huh?

403
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:22,987
Life is hard, huh?

404
00:47:43,218 --> 00:47:44,428
- It's okay.
- What is that?

405
00:47:44,594 --> 00:47:48,015
Your friends, bring me to them
if you want them safe. Come on.

406
00:47:48,224 --> 00:47:50,643
Is there anybody out there?
Can anybody read me?

407
00:47:51,143 --> 00:47:54,355
Come on. Come on.
Somebody, anybody, please.

408
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:56,608
- I'm not getting anything.
- Keep trying.

409
00:47:56,816 --> 00:47:59,528
- I'm trying. How is he?
- Bad.

410
00:48:01,363 --> 00:48:03,657
Scott, please, somebody.

411
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:13,460
Can anybody read me?

412
00:48:13,627 --> 00:48:16,171
- Is there anybody out there? Come on.
- Hey.

413
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,424
Check it out.

414
00:48:19,508 --> 00:48:23,262
- Please, can anyone read me?
- Forest Service, what's your location?

415
00:48:23,846 --> 00:48:25,473
- I'm getting something.
- Really?

416
00:48:25,932 --> 00:48:29,060
Yeah, we're at a base camp
near a cornfield or something.

417
00:48:29,227 --> 00:48:32,022
We're part of the archaeological team
working in the area.

418
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:35,359
- We need medical help right away.
- Wendy! Heather!

419
00:48:36,777 --> 00:48:39,656
Jackson? Where the hell were you?

420
00:48:39,864 --> 00:48:42,367
- Where's Scott? Pat needs a medic.
- Oh, my God.

421
00:48:43,326 --> 00:48:44,911
Jesus.

422
00:48:45,078 --> 00:48:46,330
Wendy, get me the med kit.

423
00:48:46,538 --> 00:48:48,666
- It's in the tent right behind you.
- Okay.

424
00:48:48,874 --> 00:48:50,751
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

425
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,634
Here you go.

426
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,970
- Let me help you.
- Find the keys to the Jeep.

427
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:03,432
- We're getting him out of here.
- Okay, I can do that. Be right back.

428
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,435
- We'll wait here.
- Is there something I can do to help?

429
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,980
I don't know.

430
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,568
Where are they?

431
00:49:15,278 --> 00:49:16,321
Where are they?

432
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:22,954
Murdoch residence.

433
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,498
Yes, just a second, please.

434
00:49:26,124 --> 00:49:29,586
Mr. Murdoch,
Eugene is on the phone.

435
00:49:32,256 --> 00:49:33,507
Murdoch.

436
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:36,469
- I found the cottage.
- And?

437
00:49:36,677 --> 00:49:38,596
You didn't say anything
about the snake.

438
00:49:40,264 --> 00:49:43,560
Well, I told you he might have
a few tricks up his sleeve.

439
00:49:43,727 --> 00:49:46,647
That's the understatement
of the year.

440
00:49:46,813 --> 00:49:49,274
I had no idea what we could expect.

441
00:49:49,775 --> 00:49:53,029
Ten million, and an extra million
for taking out the girl.

442
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:55,198
Forget the girl.
Do you have the serum?

443
00:49:55,365 --> 00:49:59,160
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

444
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:01,663
Tell your man to meet me.

445
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,665
I'll be ready.

446
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,963
It's all set. Let's go.

447
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,051
Wendy. Wendy, it's okay, it's okay.

448
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:16,263
- Scott showed up. He's got the keys.
- Okay.

449
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,432
- I think Patrick's stabilised.
- Right.

450
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,684
Let's grab our gear
and get out of here.

451
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:25,982
- We have to leave now, come on.
- Look at me. Look at me.

452
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:27,692
Who are you?

453
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:31,738
I am responsible
for what you saw back there, all right?

454
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:33,740
Trust me, we've gotta get out of here.

455
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:37,536
- Trust you? You want me to trust you?
- Yeah.

456
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:40,331
You know what we just saw out there?
What is it?

457
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:42,584
- Some kind of an experiment?
- Exactly.

458
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:45,086
Those men that you saw
are here to get the serum.

459
00:50:45,253 --> 00:50:47,339
- What serum?
- They can't have any witnesses.

460
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:49,842
Do you understand?
We have to get out of here.

461
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:52,178
- They would kill us?
- Why not?

462
00:50:53,554 --> 00:50:54,972
It's the cleanest option.

463
00:50:56,516 --> 00:50:58,142
Her.

464
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:04,608
You.

465
00:51:04,775 --> 00:51:07,111
You seem to be of a certain value
to my client...

466
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:10,531
...so I'm going to ask you
a few questions, if I'm allowed.

467
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,908
I'll take that.

468
00:51:13,618 --> 00:51:15,870
I'm looking for...

469
00:51:16,037 --> 00:51:20,334
I'm looking for a serum
which I'm sure you know about.

470
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,503
Sorry.

471
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:26,841
Don't. Don't waste my time.

472
00:51:43,526 --> 00:51:45,904
Tell me about this man.

473
00:51:49,658 --> 00:51:52,620
What? I didn't hear you.

474
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,789
Tell me that again.

475
00:51:56,332 --> 00:52:00,295
Okay. He's a scientist
that captured a snake.

476
00:52:00,462 --> 00:52:03,090
Good. Where is he now?

477
00:52:09,221 --> 00:52:11,432
- Answer the question.
- I don't know.

478
00:52:12,725 --> 00:52:15,562
I've been looking for him myself.

479
00:52:28,868 --> 00:52:30,495
To do what?

480
00:52:30,662 --> 00:52:33,415
To destroy everything
that he's created.

481
00:52:35,459 --> 00:52:37,962
Lucky for us, you didn't, right?

482
00:52:38,128 --> 00:52:42,216
It's gonna pretty be difficult for you
to go get that serum with that thing.

483
00:52:42,383 --> 00:52:45,386
- Who?
- You guys are gonna die if you try.

484
00:52:45,553 --> 00:52:50,142
If that's the case,
you are going to go get it for us.

485
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:53,354
Really?
Why would I do something like that?

486
00:53:00,904 --> 00:53:02,364
- Hey.
- Patrick.

487
00:53:06,368 --> 00:53:07,786
- Patrick!
- What are you doing?

488
00:53:07,953 --> 00:53:11,415
What? I make him a favour.
He's not suffering anymore.

489
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:13,626
- Wendy, no!
- Jackson, no.

490
00:53:13,793 --> 00:53:15,253
- Wendy!
- Wendy, no!

491
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:23,762
- No!
- Jackson, no.

492
00:53:24,638 --> 00:53:26,515
- Jackson.
- I am gonna kill you...

493
00:53:26,682 --> 00:53:28,518
...the first chance I get.

494
00:53:28,684 --> 00:53:31,604
- Jackson, no.
- Let him go. I'm liking this.

495
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:33,732
- You hear me? You are dead.
- Jackson, no.

496
00:53:33,899 --> 00:53:37,069
Damn you, you are... God.
God, God, why?

497
00:53:37,569 --> 00:53:39,530
- Jackson, no.
- God.

498
00:53:40,614 --> 00:53:42,366
Hey, hey, hey.

499
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:47,122
Listen. You two, 10 minutes.
You are leaving in 10 minutes.

500
00:53:47,288 --> 00:53:50,459
You heard what she said.
That thing will kill us.

501
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:52,127
Maybe, but trust me...

502
00:53:52,294 --> 00:53:55,297
...you and your team's chances
of living are better if you go.

503
00:53:55,464 --> 00:53:58,843
Now, I'll send my men
to make sure you don't lose your way.

504
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,595
Go.

505
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:05,726
Heather, Heather,
come here, come here, come here.

506
00:54:05,892 --> 00:54:07,519
I got you, I got you.

507
00:54:07,686 --> 00:54:11,399
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

508
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:14,527
It's okay, it's okay.
Let's go, come on.

509
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:19,491
Come on. Please, just come with me.

510
00:54:19,658 --> 00:54:22,744
Just stay with her.
Just calm her down, okay?

511
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:26,373
Okay, I got you.
Come on, we're gonna go.

512
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,626
Come on, let's go.

513
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,224
Hope you guys pack light...

514
00:55:19,391 --> 00:55:20,934
...in case we gotta move fast.

515
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:23,478
- Take care of yourself, kid.
- I will.

516
00:55:24,563 --> 00:55:29,193
- You think we'll get away with this?
- Truth? Probably not.

517
00:55:36,785 --> 00:55:38,620
I'm here.

518
00:55:51,468 --> 00:55:53,720
So let me ask you something.

519
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:57,224
What's this research about?

520
00:55:58,309 --> 00:56:02,605
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah, I really wanna know.

521
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:08,320
Longevity, immortality,
the fountain of youth.

522
00:56:09,863 --> 00:56:14,493
Somebody took this orchid
and genetically enhanced it...

523
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,205
...which is the chemical basis
for the serum.

524
00:56:17,372 --> 00:56:22,252
Any snake that ingests this serum
can grow 100 times its normal size.

525
00:56:24,421 --> 00:56:27,925
- And you were chasing it?
- Destroying the flowers and research...

526
00:56:28,092 --> 00:56:31,262
...is the only way I could atone
for what I did.

527
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,930
I've been waiting every day...

528
00:56:33,097 --> 00:56:36,226
...for any sign that would lead me
to these orchids.

529
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,645
And this is where they were?

530
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,856
I started hearing strange stories...

531
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:45,236
...about these animals and people
that were disappearing in these hills.

532
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:48,114
Didn't take a genius to figure it out.

533
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:50,867
Why try it by yourself?

534
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:53,537
No one believed me.

535
00:56:55,372 --> 00:56:59,168
I had this cop, Vasile, with me,
but he's dead.

536
00:57:03,047 --> 00:57:05,884
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

537
00:58:03,322 --> 00:58:05,325
Find anything?

538
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,035
No.

539
00:58:08,245 --> 00:58:11,665
I think he hid it in the mineshaft,
which is about a half a mile north.

540
00:58:11,832 --> 00:58:13,042
You guys wanna chance it?

541
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:17,296
Snakes are nocturnal. They detect heat.
It's pretty dark out there.

542
00:58:20,925 --> 00:58:22,969
Unless you're feeling lucky.

543
00:58:25,555 --> 00:58:27,099
We'll wait here till sunup.

544
00:58:27,307 --> 00:58:30,561
Good. Then we'll keep looking.

545
00:58:30,728 --> 00:58:32,980
What exactly are we looking for?

546
00:58:33,856 --> 00:58:36,943
Anything that references the serum.

547
00:59:15,402 --> 00:59:16,612
Hey.

548
00:59:18,948 --> 00:59:21,451
Honey, you need to eat something.

549
00:59:24,412 --> 00:59:27,207
Heather, look at me. Look at me.

550
00:59:29,126 --> 00:59:32,088
If we get the chance,
we're getting out of here.

551
00:59:32,254 --> 00:59:36,134
And I need you to have your strength
because I can't do this by myself.

552
00:59:36,593 --> 00:59:39,012
And I'm not leaving you here.

553
00:59:39,804 --> 00:59:41,890
You hear me? I won't leave you here.

554
00:59:49,899 --> 00:59:51,401
I'm not leaving you.

555
01:00:14,092 --> 01:00:17,680
- Anything?
- No, it's all boring.

556
01:00:21,642 --> 01:00:23,603
I just rigged an explosive
to the window.

557
01:00:24,562 --> 01:00:27,858
Nothing gets out, nothing gets in.

558
01:00:31,612 --> 01:00:34,282
We're not gonna be able
to stall these guys much longer.

559
01:00:34,448 --> 01:00:36,826
We better have a plan before sunup.

560
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,957
Loose floorboards.

561
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:47,963
Is this what you're looking for?

562
01:00:49,215 --> 01:00:52,927
- Is there any more down there?
- No, that's it. Nothing else.

563
01:00:53,386 --> 01:00:56,848
He's gotta have the chemical
composition written down somewhere.

564
01:00:57,557 --> 01:01:00,144
You know,
if that thing's attracted to flowers...

565
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:02,187
...it's gonna love this.

566
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:08,778
You know, they find this...

567
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:10,238
...they'll kill us both.

568
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:12,032
Exactly.

569
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:15,494
And that's the serum
that causes cell regeneration.

570
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:20,583
What does that mean?

571
01:01:24,587 --> 01:01:26,506
So we can't kill it.

572
01:01:26,673 --> 01:01:29,760
Not if you're talking about shooting it
or cutting its head off.

573
01:01:29,927 --> 01:01:31,512
It's too big.

574
01:01:34,682 --> 01:01:38,853
But if there's enough damage
to the internal organs, maybe.

575
01:01:39,771 --> 01:01:41,773
Maybe...?

576
01:01:42,858 --> 01:01:47,071
The snake's organs are long and thin
because of its tubular shape, right?

577
01:01:47,279 --> 01:01:51,659
If we destroy enough of them,
there's no way it can heal.

578
01:01:53,578 --> 01:01:56,331
Either that or burying it alive.

579
01:01:56,498 --> 01:01:59,209
Hey, I didn't say
this was gonna be easy.

580
01:02:00,335 --> 01:02:05,383
It just doesn't make sense
that this would be all of the serum.

581
01:02:11,347 --> 01:02:12,974
Murdoch.

582
01:02:14,893 --> 01:02:16,645
He didn't want Murdoch getting it...

583
01:02:16,812 --> 01:02:19,273
...so he would hide the bulk of it
someplace else.

584
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,566
Who's Murdoch?

585
01:02:21,525 --> 01:02:24,404
Murdoch's the one
who financed this nightmare.

586
01:02:41,589 --> 01:02:45,177
- I'm gonna put this away just in case.
- We should get some sleep.

587
01:02:45,844 --> 01:02:48,180
Hey, what's going on?

588
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,686
At least somebody's having fun.

589
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,945
I'm sorry.

590
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,156
It's okay.

591
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:10,872
How good is his smell?

592
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,626
Not that great,
but this stuff is pure concentrate.

593
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:32,312
I'm stepping out.

594
01:04:36,634 --> 01:04:38,177
Come here, quick.

595
01:04:40,138 --> 01:04:41,305
Ready?

596
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,637
So, what's the plan?

597
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,893
You know what, kid?
I don't have a plan.

598
01:05:24,478 --> 01:05:27,523
I guess just be ready to move
when I do.

599
01:05:28,566 --> 01:05:30,860
And if I'm not here...

600
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,864
...you bring her with you, okay?

601
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:35,324
Okay.

602
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,126
You know,
if that thing's attracted to flowers...

603
01:05:45,335 --> 01:05:46,836
...it's gonna love this.

604
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,277
- Amanda, what's the plan?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

605
01:06:08,444 --> 01:06:10,321
- Amanda, what's the plan?
- I'm thinking!

606
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:13,825
- What do you want me to do, huh?
- Don't take it out on me, all right?

607
01:06:14,033 --> 01:06:17,078
I just lost three of my friends!

608
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:39,395
This is... Look. It's the serum.

609
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:42,815
He must have kept it in here
to keep it cool.

610
01:06:42,982 --> 01:06:45,944
Great. Now we've found it.

611
01:06:46,111 --> 01:06:48,071
All we gotta do
is get back to the camp.

612
01:06:50,324 --> 01:06:51,867
Hey.

613
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:57,290
I'm sorry.

614
01:07:04,297 --> 01:07:05,924
Come on.

615
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:38,544
- I don't even know where we're going.
- Well, just...

616
01:07:38,711 --> 01:07:40,045
What do we got to lose, huh?

617
01:07:40,212 --> 01:07:41,547
- This way?
- Yeah.

618
01:07:45,134 --> 01:07:46,719
How many friends have you lost?

619
01:07:46,886 --> 01:07:50,182
I can't really talk about that right now.
It's not my mission.

620
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:51,433
- This way.
- You sure?

621
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,852
- Yeah.
- Amanda!

622
01:07:56,147 --> 01:07:58,316
We have the serum. We actually...
We found it.

623
01:07:58,483 --> 01:08:00,068
Take it, take it.

624
01:08:00,234 --> 01:08:03,113
- Look, what's the problem?
- There's been a change in plans.

625
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:05,407
- I'll be going alone.
- Give him the bag.

626
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:07,159
Amanda, hand me the bag.

627
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:09,703
- Amanda, give him the bag.
- Shut your mouth.

628
01:08:09,912 --> 01:08:12,540
- You, hey, back off.
- We have what your boss asked for.

629
01:08:12,707 --> 01:08:16,461
- We found what your boss wants.
- Give him the bag. Give him the bag.

630
01:08:16,669 --> 01:08:18,922
- Back off.
- We found it in the...

631
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:22,634
- Hand me the bag now.
- Amanda, give him the bag!

632
01:08:24,178 --> 01:08:25,387
Run!

633
01:08:54,169 --> 01:08:55,212
Go.

634
01:08:55,379 --> 01:08:57,256
- Come on.
- Go.

635
01:09:01,761 --> 01:09:03,388
- What are you doing?
- Go, run.

636
01:09:03,596 --> 01:09:05,599
- What are you doing? No!
- Run. Get out.

637
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:09,686
- Come with me.
- Go! Run, go.

638
01:10:24,061 --> 01:10:26,105
Glad to see you, sir.

639
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,611
Eugene.

640
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:34,739
You, back inside.

641
01:10:34,948 --> 01:10:37,450
I need water for the girl.
She's having convulsions.

642
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:39,202
It's fine, I'll watch him.

643
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:42,498
- How was the drive, sir?
- Terrible.

644
01:10:51,049 --> 01:10:54,803
- Is there anything I should know about?
- No, sir, everything is good.

645
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:56,680
Good.

646
01:10:57,848 --> 01:10:59,850
Vasile?

647
01:11:03,354 --> 01:11:08,443
What are you doing here?
I told you to take care of the girl.

648
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:10,404
We got split up.

649
01:11:11,113 --> 01:11:13,824
That snake of yours almost killed me.

650
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:18,413
But he didn't.

651
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:21,332
Now you're just another loose end.

652
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:24,628
I had a feeling
that's what you would do.

653
01:11:24,836 --> 01:11:28,132
So I cut a new deal...

654
01:11:28,299 --> 01:11:31,594
...with someone
who will pay twice what you pay.

655
01:11:32,345 --> 01:11:38,143
Eugene, this is what I pay you for.
Time to start cleaning house.

656
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:50,532
Actually...

657
01:11:50,698 --> 01:11:53,410
...I'm the new partner
he was telling you about.

658
01:11:55,162 --> 01:11:57,873
- But we had a deal.
- I'm deeply sorry, Murdoch.

659
01:11:58,082 --> 01:11:59,959
- A very good deal.
- Shoot him.

660
01:12:02,628 --> 01:12:04,339
Shoot him.

661
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:06,341
Go ahead.

662
01:12:06,508 --> 01:12:08,260
What are you waiting for? Shoot him.

663
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:23,151
Come on, let's get you out of here.
We gotta go, come on.

664
01:12:45,634 --> 01:12:48,137
Get her to the car.
Get her to the Jeep. Go, go, go.

665
01:12:48,304 --> 01:12:50,723
Move, move, move. Go.

666
01:13:54,377 --> 01:13:55,420
Are you okay?

667
01:13:55,587 --> 01:13:58,215
- No, I don't think so.
- Okay, come with me.

668
01:13:58,423 --> 01:14:00,217
They're coming.

669
01:14:00,426 --> 01:14:04,221
- We gotta get out of here. Come on.
- Not so fast, Amanda.

670
01:14:05,223 --> 01:14:06,599
Murdoch.

671
01:14:06,766 --> 01:14:09,394
If I wanted to kill you,
you would already be dead.

672
01:14:10,395 --> 01:14:13,982
Now, this is a fully automatic weapon.
Are you prepared to take the risk?

673
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:16,819
Yeah, try me.

674
01:14:21,366 --> 01:14:22,784
Give me what I came for.

675
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:25,287
There's no time for this.
The snakes are alive.

676
01:14:25,495 --> 01:14:26,580
Snakes?

677
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,166
Peter created a snake
that would regenerate.

678
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:33,170
- Then the serum works.
- The threat has doubled.

679
01:14:34,463 --> 01:14:37,634
Oh, that's disturbing,
but not of immediate concern.

680
01:14:37,842 --> 01:14:39,344
Hey.

681
01:14:39,803 --> 01:14:41,137
I'll give you a deal.

682
01:14:43,598 --> 01:14:45,934
Your lives for the serum.

683
01:14:46,101 --> 01:14:47,895
I am a man of my word.

684
01:14:49,105 --> 01:14:50,690
Yeah.

685
01:14:53,735 --> 01:14:55,153
Come on.

686
01:14:58,031 --> 01:15:01,076
Just give it to him. Give it to him.

687
01:15:03,245 --> 01:15:05,498
All right. Take your bloody serum.

688
01:15:17,511 --> 01:15:19,889
You saved my life.

689
01:15:20,306 --> 01:15:22,892
You can have yours. Now go.

690
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:28,190
Go.

691
01:15:28,356 --> 01:15:29,566
Go on, get out.

692
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,027
Go.

693
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:38,451
It's coming, come on.
Come on, hurry.

694
01:16:48,487 --> 01:16:53,409
It works! It works!

695
01:18:49,121 --> 01:18:51,790
If I'm not back in five minutes,
I'm not coming back.

696
01:19:36,799 --> 01:19:38,509
Made it.

697
01:20:07,207 --> 01:20:08,793
You can rot in hell.

698
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:40,745
Come on, we gotta go.

699
01:20:40,911 --> 01:20:43,122
- Jackson, come here.
- Yeah, here, here, here.

700
01:20:45,792 --> 01:20:48,587
- Here, take the keys. You drive.
- Okay.

701
01:20:51,215 --> 01:20:54,343
- Oh, my God, what is that?
- It's the anaconda.

702
01:20:56,178 --> 01:20:57,638
Let's go, hurry.

703
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:09,485
Drive, go.

704
01:21:10,861 --> 01:21:13,156
Go, go, go.

705
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:25,711
Here, get rid of this.
Throw it out the window.

706
01:21:32,677 --> 01:21:35,138
- Down!
- Get down, down, down!

707
01:21:37,141 --> 01:21:40,811
Amanda. Amanda, are you okay?
Heather, stay down. Down.

708
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:01,209
Alex, take the wheel!

709
01:22:02,711 --> 01:22:04,671
Alex, take the damn wheel!

710
01:22:14,724 --> 01:22:16,392
Take it.

711
01:22:17,227 --> 01:22:18,561
Okay, come on.

712
01:22:20,147 --> 01:22:21,398
I got it.

713
01:22:51,807 --> 01:22:53,559
Jackson!

714
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:11,328
Keep your eyes on the road.

715
01:23:32,852 --> 01:23:33,978
- Jackson.
- No.

716
01:23:44,949 --> 01:23:46,743
Hurry.

717
01:23:48,203 --> 01:23:50,622
- Hurry, Jackson.
- I'm trying.

718
01:24:21,698 --> 01:24:23,951
Let's see you try and regenerate
from that.

719
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,462
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go.
