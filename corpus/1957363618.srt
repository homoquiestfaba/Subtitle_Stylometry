364
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,038
Thank you.

365
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,344
Can you excuse me for a sec?

366
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,012
Of course. Go.

367
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:17,585
Ben?

368
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,188
I'm fine.

369
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,225
[♪♪]

370
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,261
[Henry Yates] Everything
seems to be in order.

371
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,363
Your daughter and her husband
were very organized.

372
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,598
[Pete] Thank you, Mr. Yates.

373
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:32,700
So, are there any papers
we need to sign

374
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:34,636
for legal guardianship
of the grandchildren?

375
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,504
Well, about that...

376
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:39,707
seems Mr. and Mrs. Gable threw
a bit of a curveball your way.

377
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:42,176
What...
What kind of curveball?

378
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,645
It turns out, Mr. Wilder,

379
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:46,346
you and your wife
are not the legal guardians.

380
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,350
So, who is?

381
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:53,020
You are, Josie.

382
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,989
Ellie chose you.

383
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,224
Me?

384
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,529
W...

385
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:03,397
Why me? I-I-I...

386
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,165
I live in New York.

387
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,568
I have a job
and an apartment and Tony,

388
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,469
and I... I'm...

389
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:10,070
No. There...
There must be some mistake.

390
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,639
Josie, you can decline.

391
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:13,373
Your mother and I
will take care of everything.

392
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,709
Why would Ellie do this?

393
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:16,410
It was an emotional decision.

394
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,145
I'm sure Ellie never thought
it would actually happen.

395
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,313
Well, nobody ever does, Dad.

396
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,250
[sighs]
The kids'll move in with us.

397
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,218
We'll convert the den.

398
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,186
Oh, I don't know, Pete.

399
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,121
Their lives have been
turned upside down.

400
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,257
Then we'll move
into Ellie and Aaron's place,

401
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,793
temporarily,

402
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,595
and, Jeff, maybe you can
move in for a bit as well.

403
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:34,796
Yeah. Whatever you need.

404
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,163
You could help your mother
with the kids

405
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,197
while I'm at the restaurant.

406
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:39,132
[Jeff] My hours
at the start-up are flexible,

407
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,134
so I can do
after school, or...

408
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,570
Great. That way the kids
can keep their routines...

409
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:44,204
school, friends, basketball.

410
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:45,138
I'm gonna stay.

411
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,474
Josie...

412
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,376
[Pete] What? No.

413
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,079
No. No, no, no.
You go back to New York...

414
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,348
to your life,
to your boyfriend...

415
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,149
your accounts.
Don't worry.

416
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,719
We'll see you in a month,
like we planned.

417
00:16:57,752 --> 00:16:59,621
No, Dad.

418
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:02,322
If this is what Ellie wanted,
then there must be some reason.

419
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,258
She thought I was the right one
to take care of the kids,

420
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,394
so I... I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna stay.

421
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,372
[♪♪]

422
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,709
[floorboards creak]

423
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:22,744
Hello?

424
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:25,479
Josie? You blew a fuse.

425
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,447
What...? Whoa.

426
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,483
Dad.

427
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:30,652
What'd you plug in?

428
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:31,786
Nothing.

429
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,154
Just... just a hair dryer

430
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,623
and a straightening iron
and a WaterPik, and it's...

431
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:37,090
[Pete sighs wearily]

432
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:38,726
[scoffs defensively]
It's just a WaterPik.

433
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:42,162
Hey, yeah, I'm gonna be late.

434
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,798
My alarm didn't go off.

435
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,700
We blew a fuse.

436
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:48,335
Dad's outside trying
to fix it right now.

437
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:51,471
Yeah. Yeah,
we figured out the source.

438
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:52,507
[Pete] Now?

439
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,508
[siblings] No!

440
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,809
I'm really sorry, Jeff.

441
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,310
- Now?
- No!

442
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,377
I just didn't know
this old house

443
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,378
couldn't handle my appliances.

444
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,346
Well, what'd you plug in?

445
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,748
A nuclear reactor?

446
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:03,718
No. Like, a straightening iron,
and stuff.

447
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:04,519
Look, I never have
this problem at home.

448
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:05,520
[click]

449
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:06,554
[Pete] Now?

450
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:07,722
- Yes!
- Yeah!

451
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:10,792
Well, you're not at home now,
are you?

452
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,392
I gotta go.

453
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,829
But I will see you later,
Einstein.

454
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,831
Oh, you're hilarious.
Ha-larious!

455
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,334
Here, Dad, I'll help you
with the French toast.

456
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,836
- I've got it.
- You know what, honey?

457
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,672
Why don't you bring this down?

458
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:26,373
Dad, I'm sorry about the fuse.

459
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,508
I didn't...

460
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:28,710
No problem.

461
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:30,477
[Josie sighs]

462
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:31,713
I can call an electrician
to come and...

463
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:33,781
I'll take care of it.

464
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:35,917
No, Dad. I'm gonna
have to be on my own here

465
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,819
at some point
with Ben and Delilah, right?

466
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:38,620
Let's see how things play out.

467
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,589
What does that mean?

468
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:43,390
I'll go rustle up your brother.

469
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,359
Ooh, French toast.

470
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,327
Yeah. You have
basketball practice today?

471
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:49,229
Mm-hmm. And Coach Cooper said

472
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,497
that he might start me
if I work on my jump shot.

473
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:53,901
Wait. Cooper is...
Cooper's your coach?

474
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:54,869
Mm-hmm.
Do you guys know each other?

475
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:56,738
Yeah. I knew him.

476
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:57,739
[laughs] Wow.

477
00:18:57,772 --> 00:19:00,240
We went to high school together.

478
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,342
The truth is,
Cooper was her boyfriend.

479
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,343
And there it is.

480
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:05,278
You and Coach?

481
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,614
Gross.

482
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:08,248
[Kate laughs]

483
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:11,251
He was actually very cute!

484
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,720
Now, your Aunt Josie,
on the other hand,

485
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:14,321
was going through a little bit
of an awkward stage.

486
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,790
Oh, thank you so much, Mom.

487
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:18,860
What about you?

488
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,695
Do you have any boys
you have crushes on?

489
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,897
Mom said I should wait
until eighth grade.

490
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,232
Oh. Your mom is probably right.

491
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,200
"Was."

492
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,269
She was probably right.

493
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:32,372
Sorry, Delilah.
I didn't...

494
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,243
What about your brother?

495
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,613
Does he have any romances?
Any crushes?

496
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:40,915
He likes Lily,
this girl on the upper team.

497
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:42,684
Zip it, Delilah!

498
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:45,318
Now, Ben,
that is not very nice.

499
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,554
Hey, Ben, guess what?

500
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,656
Aunt Josie used to go out
with Cooper.

501
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,357
[scoffs] Gross.

502
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,726
Oh, so it's unanimous.

503
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,460
I'm gross.

504
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,862
This bus is leaving.

505
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:55,897
Oh, I got it, Dad.
I'm gonna take 'em.

506
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,297
I planned on it.

507
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,733
No, it's on the way
to the restaurant.

508
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:01,536
[stammers] Okay, then
I'll pick them up after school.

509
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:02,904
Jeff's got that covered.

510
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:05,305
Dad, I want to help.

511
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,306
Your mother and I
can handle it. Come on.

512
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,909
Time's a-wastin'.

513
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:10,343
[sighs]

514
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,580
[♪♪]

515
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:15,550
[Kate] Don't feel bad, Jo.

516
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,484
You know,
people show they're hurting

517
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:18,820
in different ways,

518
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,556
and your dad does not do
vulnerable,

519
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:25,358
so he comes across sometimes
as, I don't know, gruff.

520
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,795
Yeah, but I feel like
he just doesn't want me around.

521
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:29,396
Oh, of course, he does.

522
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,732
More than you know.

523
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:32,600
It's just that
when your dad's in pain,

524
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:35,335
he needs to take control.

525
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:38,305
He needs to turn to things
that he can count on.

526
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,540
Yeah, which is why
I want to help.

527
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:40,307
I mean, what does he think?

528
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,709
I'm just gonna go
back to New York

529
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:42,977
when things get hard?

530
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,545
Mm. Can you blame him?

531
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:45,980
What do you mean?

532
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,949
You have always been
our go-getter.

533
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:48,850
Ever since you were little,

534
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:50,484
you would make
all these lists of things

535
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:51,919
you wanted to accomplish,

536
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:54,689
and we are very proud
that you have reached them all.

537
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:56,557
Which is why I know
I can be the kids' guardian

538
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:57,592
and do what Ellie wanted.

539
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,727
But is it what you want to do?

540
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:03,497
Because being the kids' guardian
isn't a part-time job.

541
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:05,298

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,275
and you're gonna look it up
on YouTubes, all right?

720
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,144
He's got the best footwork
in the game.

721
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:25,012
I think it'll help you out.
Hey, Ben, you got five minutes?

722
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,347
- Sure.
- My man.

723
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,715
I'm gonna show you a drop step.
Come here.

724
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:33,053
- Hi, Lily.
- Hey.

725
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:38,292
Sorry about your parents.

726
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,395
Yep.

727
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,835
Well, I've got practice, so...

728
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,270
I'll see you around.

729
00:27:49,303 --> 00:27:52,940
Wait. Um, my band is...

730
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:55,209
I mean, this band I'm in,
it's...

731
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,778
I mean, we're playing
tomorrow night,

732
00:27:57,811 --> 00:28:00,080
here, a-at the gym,
so if you want to come...

733
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:01,182
or not...

734
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:02,016
I mean, you don't have to.

735
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:03,184
Cool.

736
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:05,853
I didn't know your band
was playing,

737
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:06,954
but I'm totally coming.

738
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:08,322
Cool.

739
00:28:12,293 --> 00:28:13,861
"Cool"?

740
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:16,230
Was that sort of loser-ish?

741
00:28:16,263 --> 00:28:19,266
Well, I mean, for anybody else?
Totally.

742
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,868
But for you?

743
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:21,902
It was pure genius.

744
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:23,470
Come on.

745
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:24,805
Aunt Josie's
picking us up today.

746
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:26,440
[sighing]

747
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,242
She's almost a half-hour late.

748
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:29,977
Give her more time.

749
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,912
Aunt Josie said that she wanted
to pick us up, and that...

750
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:32,947
And she forgot
or got too busy or...

751
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,014
She'll come!

752
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:36,817
I'm calling Grandma.

753
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,220
<i>The spot ends with the mythical
double-tailed lion,</i>

754
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:41,088
<i>the Czech Republic's
national animal,</i>

755
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:42,957
<i>posed in front of
a bed of roses.</i>

756
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,124
Great job, Josie.

757
00:28:44,158 --> 00:28:45,292
So thank you for...

758
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:47,061
Let's talk rollout.

759
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:49,330
<i>Oh, that is,
if your hotshot VP</i>

760
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:50,831
- can spare the time.
- Mm-hmm.

761
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,399
I... I'm sorry.
I actually can't.

762
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:54,168
Uh, Josie, we've...

763
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:55,202
<i>You know what?
I'm already late</i>

764
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:56,403
to pick up my niece and nephew.

765
00:28:56,437 --> 00:28:58,372
I'm so sorry,
but I'll have to reschedule.

766
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,143
[♪♪]

767
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:06,347
So, Grandpa,

768
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,015
people can just place
their orders online,

769
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:09,950
and then someone else
picks the food up

770
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:11,285
and delivers it.

771
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:12,453
All you have to do
is register the restaurant.

772
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:13,988
This has always been a place

773
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:16,490
where people get together,
say hello over a meal,

774
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:17,858
and that's how
it's going to stay.

775
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:19,561
Thank goodness.
I'm so sorry.

776
00:29:19,594 --> 00:29:20,961
I went to the school.
I must've just missed you.

777
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:22,496
It's okay, honey.

778
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,431
[sighs] I'm so sorry.

779
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:26,066
Did you forget us?

780
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,201
No! No, no, no. I was just
stuck on a call, and...

781
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:29,003
You got too busy.

782
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:32,206
Josie, if you can't
handle the responsibility...

783
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,508
No, Dad. I was just on with
a really demanding client

784
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:34,908
from the city.

785
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,076
But I jumped off
before it was even over...

786
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,011
You say "the city"
like you think

787
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:38,912
New York is the only place
that matters.

788
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:40,047
- Okay, that's enough.
- Ben, cut it out.

789
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,417
Everyone ready to go?

790
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,494
That went... great.

791
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:55,863
Look. I do not want you
to beat yourself up

792
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,532
about this, all right?

793
00:29:57,565 --> 00:30:00,602
I was late for school pick-up
more times than I can count.

794
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:03,937
It's just that Dad finally
lets me do something,

795
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,105
and I screw it up.

796
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:06,440
No.

797
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,242
The minute
you stop making mistakes

798
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:10,277
is when you stop trying.

799
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:12,146
Kind of like this.

800
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,516
You stopped trying.
You're wearing pajama bottoms.

801
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,383
What? The meetings
are on video.

802
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:17,418
They only see from here up.

803
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:18,919
[laughs]

804
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:23,891
Ugh. What was Ellie thinking,
making me their guardian?

805
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:25,627
We are gonna figure that out
together,

806
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,595
as a family.

807
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:30,264
In the meantime,
let's get the kids home,

808
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:32,299
and you in grown-up clothes.

809
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,536
- [chuckling]
- Mm-hmm.

810
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:36,470
[alarm clock beeps]

811
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:50,652
[music begins playing]

812
00:30:50,685 --> 00:30:52,520
[♪♪]

813
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:01,596
[♪♪]

814
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:08,636
[♪♪]

815
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,311
[alarm beeping]

816
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:18,345
Oh, no!

817
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:20,381
Oh, no! Uh...

818
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:22,116
Whoa, whoa.
What the heck are you doing?

819
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,651
Uh, making breakfast.
What does it look like?

820
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:25,352
Burning down the house.

821
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,557
Hey. Hey, sorry, man.
I got to call you back.

822
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:31,458
I'm putting out
a few fires over here.

823
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:33,026
So, yeah, why don't you just
run the numbers

824
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,129
and see if it makes sense?
Okay. 'Kay, bye.

825
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:36,564
Thank you.

826
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:38,666
Yeah, of course, but what,
you don't do

827
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,367
a lot of cooking
up there in New York?

828
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:41,636
No. I'm more of

829
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:44,071
a takeout/make-a-reservation
type of a gal.

830
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:45,507
Was that about work?

831
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,708
Yeah, it was.

832
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:49,009
What? Were you listening
to my phone call?

833
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:50,377
Listen, if you need
help with anything,

834
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:53,013
I mean, I've advised
a few start-ups.

835
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:55,115
No, we're good.
Thank you, honestly.

836
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:57,951
Besides, if anyone could use
some help around here,

837
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:59,219
it's you.

838
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:00,387
Hey.

839
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:01,388
I love you, Jojo.

840
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:02,657
Love you, too.

841
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:06,460
All right. Let's...
try this again.

842
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:12,266
Uh, did we all say thank you
to Aunt Josie

843
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,500
for making breakfast?

844
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:14,702
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

845
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:16,470
Jeff said

846
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:17,639
he almost had to call
the fire department

847
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:18,606
this morning.

848
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,107
Mm.

849
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,609
Yeah, that seems to be
my specialty, Dad...

850
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:24,646
four-alarm eggs and bacon.

851
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:27,114
[Kate] So, Ben, what time
is the concert tonight?

852
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:28,616
You're not all coming.

853
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,618
I mean, yeah, of course.

854
00:32:30,652 --> 00:32:32,453
Your mom and dad always
went to your concerts.

855
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:35,389
They're not here anymore.

856
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:37,525
Maybe Ben just wants to be
alone with his new girlfriend.

857
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,426
Don't be such a jerk!

858
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,161
Hey, no name-calling!

859
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:44,198
Come on, Delilah.

860
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:45,667
Your mom didn't raise you
to tease him like that.

861
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,668
Go apologize.

862
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:47,702
No.

863
00:32:47,735 --> 00:32:49,403
Delilah!

864
00:32:49,436 --> 00:32:52,239
She's not my mom!
She's not anyone's mom!

865
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,242
[sighs as phone rings]

866
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:58,278
Excuse me.

867
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,314
[ringing continues]

868
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,385
[sighs]

869
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:08,188
Cooper, you have no idea
how happy I am you just called.

870
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:09,757
Wish all my friends would
answer the phone like that.

871
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:11,358
<i>You okay?</i>

872
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:13,460
Yeah. Every...
everything's fine.

873
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:15,162
Your words say "fine,"
but your tone says "lousy."

874
00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:16,196
What's wrong?

875
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,665
Oh, I don't know.

876
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:21,603
I just burned breakfast again,
I upset both of the kids,

877
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:23,805
I blew out I don't know
how many fuses in the house,

878
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:26,173
and I walked out on a meeting
with a really important client.

879
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:27,407
So you're having a good day.

880
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:29,476
<i>Yeah, no, things are great.
Going just great.</i>

881
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:31,144
Let me guess.

882
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,780
You're rubbing your temple

883
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:34,582
<i>in tiny little circles
right about now.</i>

884
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:35,717
No.

885
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,184
Maybe.

886
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:38,586
How did you know that?

887
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,053
That's what you do
when you're stressed.

888
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:41,556
It's your thing.

889
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,090
I don't have a thing.

890
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,592
Oh, you certainly do
have a thing.

891
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:46,426
Everybody's got a thing.

892
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:50,230
<i>My two cents,
for what it's worth...</i>

893
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:54,101
which is probably
about two cents...

894
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:56,771
you're going through
a lot right now,

895
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:58,673
by anyone's standards,

896
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:01,609
and you also just got back.

897
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:03,511
Maybe you cut yourself a break.

898
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:05,680
I wish I knew how.

899
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,582
I don't know
what I'm doing, Cooper.

900
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:10,350
I feel like I'm messing up
as a parent

901
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:11,686
and a sister
and a daughter here,

902
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,420
and I'm dropping the ball

903
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:15,322
on my fake European water
account in New York.

904
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,291
"Fake European water"?

905
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:20,227
There's three words you don't
hear together every day.

906
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,597
I know. Tell me about it.

Ben's got a concert tonight.
Are you going?

911
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,406
Well, Ben doesn't
actually want me there,

912
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,474
but he also doesn't
have a choice,

913
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:36,410
so, yeah, I'm going.

I'll save you two.

919
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,788

Well, she's trying, Pete.

923
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:56,296
This is all so new to her,

924
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,700
so if she's not as good
with the kids as Ellie was,

925
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:01,168
we just need to give her time.

926
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:03,705
I give her
another month tops, Kate.

927

00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:33,868
Pretty different, huh?

934
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:35,570
Yeah. I mean,
the Garden's great,

935
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:37,471
but this has its own charm,

936
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:39,439
and the floors are less sticky.

937
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:40,675

I'd have to agree with Josie.

being a mom?

Must be so hard.

947
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:04,398
Well, I mean,
no one can replace their mom,

I see you're really good at it.

Look, I'm...
I'm trying my best,

and I'm probably gonna
make a lot of mistakes,

but you can talk to me
about anything.

962
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:53,915
It's just...

963
00:36:53,948 --> 00:36:57,451
when you brought up my mom
at breakfast,

964
00:36:57,484 --> 00:37:00,220
I got mad or something.

965
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:03,658
Yeah. I get it.

even when
they're trying to be nice,

968
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:10,363
I get kind of
"mad or something" too.

00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:14,234
When is that going away?

Hopefully never.

I'll never stop missing
my sister or your dad...

for a long time.

But you know what?

978
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:40,061
I really think the memories
that make us cry now,

979
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:43,430
I think, one day...

980
00:37:43,463 --> 00:37:46,534
I think, one day,
they're gonna make you smile

981
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,368

those memories

to smile about it now.

00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:37,198
I just want to apologize

1074
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:40,634
for that fire alarm comment
I made this morning.

1075
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,636
It was inconsiderate.

1076
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:45,940
That's okay.
I know this is hard on you.

1077
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:48,042
Probably much harder on you,

1078
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:51,679
having to uproot your life
at the drop of a hat

1079
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:53,014
to come back here

1080
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:55,116
to a place you spent
your whole life

1081
00:41:55,149 --> 00:41:56,717
trying to get away from.

1082
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:57,852
Dad, that's not exactly true.

1083
00:41:57,885 --> 00:42:00,121
You wanted to tackle the world.

1084
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:03,224
And I suppose...

1085
00:42:03,257 --> 00:42:06,193
if I'm being honest,

1086
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:08,529
it hurt a little
when you left for New York.

1087
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:12,166
I didn't leave you.
I just...

1088
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,269
You had to find your own life.
I get it.

1089
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:17,605
And if I haven't said it enough,

1090
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:19,807
I'm amazed
at what you've done.

1091
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:25,179
Thank you.

1092
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:27,982
Which is why you don't
have to keep this up.

1093
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:29,683
What are you saying?

1094
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:33,888
Just that...

1095
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:36,257
maybe you're not the same girl
that Ellie thought you were.

1096
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,293
Maybe your sister was wrong.

1097
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:43,364
So if this isn't for you,
that's okay.

1098
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:45,933
Your mom and I can take care
of Ben and Delilah,

1099
00:42:45,966 --> 00:42:48,002
and they'll understand.

1100
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:51,205
It's okay to go home, Jojo.

1101
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,041
Do you want me to leave?

1102
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,579
Just... think it over.

1103
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:01,949
Goodnight, kiddo.

1104
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:03,684
I love you.

1105
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:07,188
[♪♪]

1106
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:16,931
Oh, VodaSpring...

1107
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:19,266
VodaSpring, VodaSpring,
VodaSpring.

1108
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:22,837
[♪♪]

1109
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:36,717
She kept it.

1110
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:40,754
Oh.

1111
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:42,256
[knocking]

1112
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:44,225
Jo? Can you come help me
in the kitchen, please?

1113
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:45,292
Yeah. I'll be there
in just a sec.

1114
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:46,760
Okay.

1115
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,832
So the kids have a bake sale
at school tomorrow,

1116
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:53,267
and I promised I'd help them,

1117
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,069
and now your father needs me
at the restaurant

1118
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:56,704
to help cover Saturday rush.

1119
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:58,172
It'll be fun.

1120
00:43:58,205 --> 00:43:59,340
It'll be good for me to spend
some quality time

1121
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:00,908
with Ben and Delilah.

1122
00:44:00,941 --> 00:44:02,276
I don't know why,
but I just...

1123
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:04,712
I feel like
Ben's always irritated with me.

1124
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:06,080
Well, aside from
all that's happened,

1125
00:44:06,113 --> 00:44:07,448
he is still a teenaged boy.

1126
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,083
I mean, your brother,

1127
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:11,285
he would be irritable
from the moment I woke him up

1128
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,786
until the minute
he was grounded

1129
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,054
for coming in past curfew.

1130
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,992
I don't know, Mom.
I just... I feel for Ben.

1131
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:19,193
I mean, first,
he loses his parents,

1132
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:21,061
and now... and now
he's heartbroken

1133
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:22,463
over this girl, Lily.

1134
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:23,864
Do you know she was at the dance
with another boy?

1135
00:44:23,898 --> 00:44:26,400
And he saw them, together, and...

1136
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:27,768
I mean, who does
she think she is?

1137
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,236
There is no one
better than Ben.

1138
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,039
See? You are finding your way.

1139
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:36,777
[chuckles]

1140
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:40,814
All right. So what
are we raising money for?

1141
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:42,716
My basketball team.

1142
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,951
Oh. Well, in that case,

1143
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:45,719
we gotta make these cookies
extra special.

1144
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:47,154
All right. You're gonna be
in charge of the raisins,

1145
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:49,490
and you are gonna be in charge
of the chocolate chips...

1146
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:50,758
more of which should be
in the batter,

1147
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:51,825
not your mouth.

1148
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,194
- [laughs]
- Hello?

1149
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:54,161
I've been knocking on
the front door

1150
00:44:54,195 --> 00:44:55,462
for five minutes.

1151
00:44:55,496 --> 00:44:56,931
Don't you guys know
how a front door works?

1152
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:58,899
Well, you obviously do.
How are you?

1153
00:44:58,933 --> 00:45:00,267
What are you doing here?

1154
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:01,435
Figured you guys are
raising money for the team,

1155
00:45:01,468 --> 00:45:02,236
so I thought
I'd come and help.

1156
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:04,104
Yeah. Grab an apron.
Right there.

1157
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:05,940
Yes, ma'am.

1158
00:45:05,973 --> 00:45:09,076
You know what I missed the most
when I was living in Atlanta

1159
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:10,945
was your family's baking.

1160
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:12,980
Why were you in Atlanta, Coach?

1161
00:45:13,013 --> 00:45:14,381
Fiancée had a job there.

1162
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:17,117
You have a fiancée?

1163
00:45:17,151 --> 00:45:18,852
"Had," yes.

1164
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:20,854
You guys want to hear
how I proposed?

1165
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,823
It was very dramatic.

1166
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:24,058
Lots of grand gestures.

1167
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:25,292
Grand gestures?

1168
00:45:25,326 --> 00:45:26,427
Oh, big gestures.

1169
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,128
It might even be too romantic.

1170
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:29,296
You know what?
I'm not gonna tell you.

1171
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,365
So where is she now?

1172
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:34,068
Sometimes, things
don't go as planned,

1173
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:35,502
but that's all right.

1174
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:37,204
You just got to keep moving,
you know?

1175
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:43,310
All right. I think that tray's
ready for the oven.

1176
00:45:43,344 --> 00:45:44,546
Do you guys, uh, want to run
to the pantry downstairs

1177
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,547
and grab some more

1178
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,181
- cookie sheets?
- Sure.

1179
00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:48,849
What am I doing?

1180
00:45:48,882 --> 00:45:50,918
Um, there.
You can roll those into balls.

1181
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:52,286
Into balls.
Okay, I can do that.

1182
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:57,992
So, you were engaged?

1183
00:45:58,025 --> 00:45:59,159
I had no idea.
I'm sorry.

1184
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:00,794
Oh, how would you?

1185
00:46:00,828 --> 00:46:03,297
It was wild too, Josie.

1186
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,867
I could see it all...
a whole life. Kids.

1187
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,504
Dogs, white picket fence...
all of it.

1188
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:13,073
Well, you always were
so romantic.

1189
00:46:13,107 --> 00:46:15,242
Yeah. I'm like a walking
Ryan Gosling movie.

1190
00:46:15,276 --> 00:46:16,377
- You really are.
- Thank you.

1191
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,911
[Josie laughs]

1192
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:19,847
That's how I refer to you.

1193
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,518
Yeah. And then, one day,
Lisa came home from a work trip,

1194
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:26,186
told me she had
met somebody else.

1195
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,355
Didn't mean to fall in love,
but she did.

1196
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:30,924
I'm sorry.
So what'd you do?

1197
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,361
I did what anybody does.

1198
00:46:34,395 --> 00:46:35,396
You know,
I wallowed for a while,

1199
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:37,364
face-down in the dirt,

1200
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:39,967
till one day, my mom came by,
and grabbed me by the collar,

1201
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,236
and picked me up.

1202
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:44,071
Explained to me very clearly

1203
00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:49,577
that, when one door closes,
another one opens,

1204
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:51,845
and eventually,
I'd find my door.

1205
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:53,147
Mm.

1206
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,415
Your mom always
gave great advice.

1207
00:46:54,448 --> 00:46:56,417
Yeah.

1208
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,819
I feel like I could use
some of that myself right now.

1209
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:03,057
I don't know, Cooper,
I feel like two months ago,

1210
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,259
I had a really clear path
for my life.

1211
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:07,194
You know, in New York,

1212
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:10,964
I had a vision for where
things were going, and now I...

1213
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,833
I don't know.
I'm feeling kind of lost.

1214
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:15,836
You'll find your door.

1215
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:19,641
[phone buzzes]

1216
00:47:19,674 --> 00:47:21,275
Oh.

1217
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:23,043
Tony. Right.

1218
00:47:23,077 --> 00:47:24,478
I... I need to take this.

1219
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:25,913
Go ahead.

1220
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:27,181
I'll be here, baking.

1221
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:28,282
[beep]

1222
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:29,950
[Tony] <i>Hey, you.</i>

1223
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:31,586
- Welcome back, friends.
- Thank you.

1224
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,420
Sorry it's taken
so long to connect,

1225
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:34,955
but it's been nuts up here.

1226
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:36,957
<i>So how's your family
holding up?</i>

1227
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,126
Uh, you know, we're okay.

1228
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:42,162
It's been really hard,
but we're making it work.

1229
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:44,031
Good. I'm glad.

1230
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:46,033
So...

1231
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:47,602
when do you think
you'll be coming back home?

1232
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:49,937
That's the thing.

1233
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,238
I... I really don't know.

1234
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:53,974
I think this is more long-term
than I expected.

1235
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:56,043
Wow. Okay.

1236
00:47:56,076 --> 00:47:57,411
That's, um...

1237
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:59,279
What?

1238
00:47:59,313 --> 00:48:01,315
[sighs] It's just...

1239
00:48:01,348 --> 00:48:03,050
Josie, we talked about this.

1240
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,452
Long distance,
it doesn't really work for me.

1241
00:48:05,486 --> 00:48:06,353
I've tried it before, and...

1242
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:08,623
I know, but what do you
expect me to do?

1243
00:48:08,656 --> 00:48:10,190
I mean, the kids need me here.

1244
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:12,459
I get it.

1245
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:15,262
I get it, and you should

Coach Cooper's
got the coolest barn.

1421
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:35,576
We went there for a field trip.
He's got so many horses.

1422
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,811
Really? I didn't know
you loved horses that much.

1423
00:54:38,546 --> 00:54:39,847
Hey, hey, guys.
I'm so sorry I'm late,

1424
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:42,717
but, hey, I did bring
some goodies of my own, so.

1425
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,086
Did you make those,
Uncle Jeff?

1426
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,387
[Pete, scoffs]
Come on, Delilah.

1427
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,890
Your mom was the baker
in the family.

1428
00:54:48,923 --> 00:54:51,058
Uncle Jeff's a computer whiz.

1429
00:54:51,092 --> 00:54:52,593
Probably coming up
with the next big invention.

1430
00:54:52,627 --> 00:54:53,594
Right, Jeff?

1431
00:54:53,628 --> 00:54:56,063
Yeah, that's right, Pop.

1432
00:54:56,097 --> 00:54:58,065
Yeah, I picked these up
on my way over here.

1433
00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,901
Hey, if you and Cooper
want to take a break,

1434
00:54:59,934 --> 00:55:01,334
the kids and I
can man this table.

1435
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:02,369
You want to take a break?

1436
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,505
Yeah?

1437
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:05,740
I love breaks!

1438
00:55:05,773 --> 00:55:07,340
All right.
Well, give me the tour, Coach.

1439
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:08,843
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

1440
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:14,015
Do you remember this place?

1441
00:55:14,048 --> 00:55:15,750
Oh, of course, I do.

1442
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:17,018
This is where
I performed <i>Grease.</i>

1443
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:18,418
Oh, yes.

1444
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:19,887

[Josie chuckles]

1450
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:29,864
Oh.

1451
00:55:29,897 --> 00:55:33,134
I feel like something else
also happened here.

1452
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:35,468
Huh.

1453
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:36,604
No...

1454
00:55:36,637 --> 00:55:38,139
Nothing memorable.

1455
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:39,941

1456
00:55:39,974 --> 00:55:41,042
Mm...

1457
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:42,743
- That hurts.
- Oh, you know what?

1458
00:55:42,777 --> 00:55:44,679
Yeah.

1459
00:55:44,712 --> 00:55:45,847
We did kiss backstage.

1460
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:48,850
That was my first kiss.

1461
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:50,518
- Was it?
- Yeah. It was a good kiss.

1462
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:51,652
Mm-hmm.

1463

1466
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:02,429
Oh. There's something about it,
being here.

1467
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:03,898
I feel like
I just breathe deeper.

1468
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:08,002
I mean, yeah, you're back home.

1469
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:11,639
You know, everyone's been
so nice and comforting.

1470
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,076
There's just something
about my dad.

1471
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:17,144
I feel like he kind of
doesn't want me here.

1472
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:19,412
Maybe he just doesn't want
to get his hopes up,

1473
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:20,748
in case you leave again.

1474
00:56:20,781 --> 00:56:22,449
No, he practically
pushed me out the door

1475
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:23,718
and encouraged me
to go home.

1476
00:56:23,751 --> 00:56:26,721
Jo, every time
I've seen that man,

1477
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:28,890
all he's done is talk about you.

1478
00:56:28,923 --> 00:56:30,858
I think
he just misses you a lot, Jo.

1479
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:34,562
Hmm.

1480
00:56:34,595 --> 00:56:35,596
What about you?

1481
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,797
Are you happy you moved back?

1482
00:56:36,831 --> 00:56:38,599
Am I happy I moved back?

1483
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:40,433
Yeah.

1484
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:42,003
I mean, yeah.

1485
00:56:42,036 --> 00:56:44,205
It's beautiful here.
It's my home.

1486
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:46,607
It's not the life
that I imagined,

1487
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:48,676
but it's the life I want now.

1488
00:56:53,514 --> 00:56:55,049
Which reminds me,

1489
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:56,584
there's something
I wanted to ask you.

1490
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:58,886
Wait, Coop.

1491
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,820
I know you got
a lot on your plate,

1492
00:56:59,854 --> 00:57:01,155
and I don't want to...

1493
00:57:01,188 --> 00:57:03,624
I don't want to add to that,
but, uh,

1494
00:57:03,658 --> 00:57:05,159
Josie, will you, um...

1495
00:57:05,192 --> 00:57:06,928
Uh, okay. I... Cooper, I know
what you're gonna say.

1496
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:08,829
You do?

1497
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,464
Yeah.

1498
00:57:11,498 --> 00:57:14,635
I... I know what you're feeling,
and it's... it's not real.

1499
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,506
Okay, maybe it's real,
but it's... it's...

1500
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:20,508
I've only been back
a short time,

1501
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:22,610
and, I mean,
I was just talking about

1502
00:57:22,643 --> 00:57:23,878
how completely confused
and overwhelmed I am

1503
00:57:23,911 --> 00:57:25,478
a minute ago,

1504
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:27,114
and that hasn't changed
in the last 60 seconds.

1505
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:29,650
It's been so nice
to hang out with you.

1506
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:31,585
It feels good.

1507
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:33,154
It feels really good,
but all of this talk

1508
00:57:33,187 --> 00:57:34,789
about, you know, grand gestures,

1509
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:37,024
and what if
I had stayed in town...

1510
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:37,925
it's not grounded in reality,

1511
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:39,093
and right now,

1512
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:42,063
I have to be
all about reality.

1513
00:57:42,096 --> 00:57:45,266
I'm sorry if it hurts you,
but no.

1514
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:46,968
The answer is...
the answer is no.

1515
00:57:49,537 --> 00:57:51,205
That's all right.
I'll just ask somebody else.

1516
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,808
What?

1517
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:56,077
I didn't realize
it would be such a big deal.

1518
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,912
Of...
Of course it's a big deal.

1519
00:57:57,945 --> 00:57:59,780
I mean, it's a...
it's a big deal.

1520
00:57:59,814 --> 00:58:01,215
It's only temporary,

1521
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:02,817
until I get
another one of my own.

1522
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,685
I'm sorry.
Is one not enough for you?

1523
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,988
I think it's every guy's dream

1524
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:09,557
to have one for family
and one for weekend fun.

1525
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,559
How can you talk about
something like this so casually?

1526
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:14,061
What do you think
we're talking about?

1527
00:58:14,095 --> 00:58:15,730
Marriage.

1528
00:58:17,264 --> 00:58:18,833
What?

1529
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:20,901
We're talking about...

1530
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:22,636
Did you think
I was proposing to you?

1531
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:26,207
You... Okay, no.

1532
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,675
Mr. Cox, he said

1533
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:28,943
that you ordered
an engagement ring

1534
00:58:28,976 --> 00:58:31,145
for a grand gesture!

1535
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:32,813
And we're sitting here,

1536
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:35,216
and you pull this-this ring box
out of your pocket.

1537
00:58:35,249 --> 00:58:37,118
It was jamming into my leg.

1538
00:58:37,151 --> 00:58:38,586
This is Nate's.

1539
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:40,221
He's proposing to Molly
next week.

1540
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:42,823
So what are you doing with it?

1541
00:58:42,857 --> 00:58:44,792
He had me
arrange the whole thing

1542
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:45,993
so he wouldn't get caught.

1543
00:58:46,027 --> 00:58:47,661
But then you brought me here,

1544
00:58:47,695 --> 00:58:49,764
and you said that you wanted
to ask me something.

1545
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:51,332
I do want
to ask you something.

1546
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:52,767
I wanted to ask you

1547
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,702
if I could use your father's van
for game nights.

1548
00:58:54,735 --> 00:58:56,604
The van?

1549
00:58:56,637 --> 00:58:58,706
Yes, just until I get
enough money to get my own,

1550
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:00,841
and since I crashed
his Chevy in high school,

1551
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:01,876
I thought
I didn't want to ask him.

1552
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:03,277
I thought
maybe you could ask him.

1553
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,945
Of course,
you can borrow the van.

1554
00:59:04,979 --> 00:59:05,813
You can have the van.

1555
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:07,348
Thank you.

1556
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:10,584
Yeah. I'm just gonna go
crawl under a rock over there.

- We can never speak of this.

- No, it's okay!
- Thank you so much.

01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:34,201
I...

1595
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:35,736
I am so embarrassed.

1596
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:36,704
Embarrassed about what?

1597
01:00:37,905 --> 01:00:39,073
You know.

1598
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:40,207
I don't know.

1599
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:41,342
Come on.

1600
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:43,043
Yesterday at the bake sale.

1601
01:00:43,077 --> 01:00:44,345
What happened
at the bake sale?

1602
01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:46,046
I... the ring?

1603
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,047
Oh!

1604
01:00:47,081 --> 01:00:48,315
You're talking about

1605
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:50,017
where you thought
I was proposing to you

1606
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:52,019
at the most inappropriate time
ever in history?

1607
01:00:52,052 --> 01:00:53,120
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1608
01:00:53,154 --> 01:00:54,221
I don't remember that.

1609
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:55,689
Great.

1610
01:00:55,723 --> 01:00:57,057
That's...

1611
01:00:57,091 --> 01:00:58,459
- Thank you. You're the best.
- You're welcome.

1612
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:00,761
And thank you
for convincing your father

1613
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:02,263
to let me use the van.
I appreciate that.

1614
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:03,964
Oh, yeah.
No, he was happy to do it.

1615
01:01:03,998 --> 01:01:05,299
I mean, he did take out

1616
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:07,234
the extra, you know,
collision insurance,

1617
01:01:07,268 --> 01:01:08,702
but just on the nights
that you're driving it, so.

1618
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:09,970
Really?

1619
01:01:10,004 --> 01:01:11,105
No. I'm kidding.

1620
01:01:11,138 --> 01:01:12,239
- Nice.
- Yeah.

1621
01:01:12,273 --> 01:01:13,774
That's good.
I see what you did.

1622
01:01:13,807 --> 01:01:15,309
[laughs]
Anyway, congrats on the game.

1623
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:17,311
Thank you.

1624
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:19,346
Um, will you excuse me
for just a second?

1625
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,848
Sure.

1626
01:01:20,881 --> 01:01:22,049
Go ahead.

1627
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:25,219
Hi. Lily?

1628
01:01:25,252 --> 01:01:26,987
I'm Josie.
I'm Ben and Delilah's aunt.

1629
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:28,022
I don't think we've met yet.

1630
01:01:28,055 --> 01:01:29,089
Of course. Hi.

1631
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:30,324
Miss Wilder?

1632
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:31,292
Hi. Can I talk to you
for a second?

1633
01:01:31,325 --> 01:01:32,893
Yeah.

1634
01:01:32,927 --> 01:01:34,128
I'll talk to you later, Ivan.

1635
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:35,496
Hey.

1636
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:36,730
What's up?

1637
01:01:36,764 --> 01:01:38,732
Listen.

1638
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:41,268
I was your age once,
so I get it.

1639
01:01:41,302 --> 01:01:44,305
You know, a girl feels special
when a boy likes her.

1640
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:46,407
I mean, not that that should be
the end-all, be-all,

1641
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,942
because how boys feel about us
shouldn't determine

1642
01:01:47,975 --> 01:01:49,743
our self-esteem, right?

1643
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:50,945
Right?

1644
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,781
Uh, right. Right.

1645
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:55,482
When a boy likes you,

1646
01:01:55,517 --> 01:01:57,184
it's important
that you not only think about

1647
01:01:57,218 --> 01:01:59,253
how it makes you feel,
but also how it makes him feel.

1648
01:01:59,286 --> 01:02:00,754
You know, and this guy Ivan
that you're hanging out with,

1649
01:02:00,788 --> 01:02:02,056
like, it seems like

1650
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:03,290
you like him and he likes you,

1651
01:02:03,324 --> 01:02:04,892
and you guys feel pretty good
about it, right?

1652
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:07,027
Miss Wilder,

1653
01:02:07,061 --> 01:02:08,896
I'm not sure I fully understand
what this is about.

1654
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:11,465
So you like Ivan,
and he likes you,

1655
01:02:11,498 --> 01:02:13,367
but you also like Ben,

1656
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,869
and he likes you.

1657
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:17,137
He does?

1658
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,977
I mean, I li... I like Ben,
but I don't like-like him.

1659
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:26,380
Oh, right. Okay.

1660
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:29,183
Um, you know, there's just
kind of a gray area

1661
01:02:29,216 --> 01:02:30,417
between "like"
and "like-like."

1662
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:32,052
Like, someone may like-like you
and think

1663
01:02:32,086 --> 01:02:33,420
that you like-like them,
but you only <i>like</i> them,

1664
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:35,122
and you don't even know
that they like-like you.

1665
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:37,024
Did...
Did that make any sense?

1666
01:02:38,993 --> 01:02:40,427
That didn't make sense.
Right.

1667
01:02:40,461 --> 01:02:41,996
Um...

1668
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:43,230
what I'm trying to say is,

1669
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:45,432
if you only
like Ben as a friend,

1670
01:02:45,466 --> 01:02:47,901
you should probably tell him
so nobody gets hurt.

1671
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:50,904
Is it okay if I go now?

1672
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:53,207
My grandma's taking me
to get ice cream.

1673
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,542
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1674
01:02:54,576 --> 01:02:56,076
No, thanks for talking.

1675
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,778
Enjoy the ice cream.

1676
01:02:58,979 --> 01:03:00,881
Um, yeah.

1677
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:07,522
[♪♪]

1678
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,562
<i>That was
some basketball game, huh?</i>

1679
01:03:14,596 --> 01:03:15,829
Yeah. You were so good.

1680
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:17,197
MVP over here!

1681
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:18,399
Whoo!

1682
01:03:18,432 --> 01:03:19,466
So glad you could
join us, Cooper.

1683
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,968
My pleasure.

1684
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:21,835
We wouldn't have won
without you.

1685
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:22,870
No.

1686
01:03:22,903 --> 01:03:24,038
Now, I have to admit,

1687
01:03:24,071 --> 01:03:26,140
I do not know as much
about basketball

1688
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:28,375
as your father
or Uncle Jeff, but...

1689
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:29,910
Or Aunt Josie's ex-boyfriend.

1690
01:03:29,943 --> 01:03:32,012
He works for the NBA
in New York.

1691
01:03:32,046 --> 01:03:33,847
Well, I guess
that makes your aunt

1692
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:36,116
a bit of a sports expert,
huh, Ben?

1693
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,885
Well, I know a thing or two.

1694
01:03:37,918 --> 01:03:39,286
Oh, you do? Okay.
Well, you tell me,

1695
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,089
a three-point shot
is worth how many points?

1696
01:03:42,122 --> 01:03:44,526
Oh, I don't know, Jeff.
Let me think about that.

1697
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:45,593
Oh... three points.

1698
01:03:45,627 --> 01:03:47,094
Checks out.

1699
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,296
[laughter]

1700
01:03:50,464 --> 01:03:51,633
Try me, Coach.

1701
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:53,033
- Try you?
- Yeah.

1702
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:54,868
What's a box-and-one?

1703
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:56,970
When...

1704
01:03:57,004 --> 01:03:58,540
you...

1705
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:00,474
get a box from Amazon
and also a magazine.

1706
01:04:00,508 --> 01:04:01,475
- [laughter]
- There it is. You got it.

1707
01:04:04,945 --> 01:04:06,614
Speaking of getting something...

1708
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,351
...this is for you.

1709
01:04:10,384 --> 01:04:11,852
Hmm.

1710
01:04:18,058 --> 01:04:20,361
When your mom turned 16,
I gave her a charm bracelet,

1711
01:04:20,394 --> 01:04:22,564
and I found it
in one of the drawers

1712
01:04:22,597 --> 01:04:24,298
in the guest bedroom.

1713
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:25,633
I thought you might like it.

1714
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:28,536
[♪♪]

1715
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,337
And see?

1716
01:04:30,371 --> 01:04:32,272
I even put a little basketball
charm there for you.

1717
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:34,341
I know how much she loved
watching you play it, so.

1718
01:04:35,577 --> 01:04:37,177
This was my mom's?

1719
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:38,879
It was.

1720
01:04:40,247 --> 01:04:42,483
I have to go to the restroom.

1721
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:46,521
[♪♪]

1722
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:49,089
Hey, she's gonna be fine.

1723
01:04:49,123 --> 01:04:50,157
No, she won't.

1724
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:53,227
That was so lame.

1725
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,995
- Ben!
- Benjamin! Come on.

1726
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:56,631
It was.

1727
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:58,265
Delilah was
in a really good mood,

1728
01:04:58,298 --> 01:04:59,667
and then Aunt Josie goes
and reminds her of Mom.

1729
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:01,603
Come on. Ben, your aunt
was just trying to...

1730
01:05:01,636 --> 01:05:03,170
You should just stop trying.

1731
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:04,204
You're ruining everything!

1732
01:05:04,238 --> 01:05:05,339
Ben.

1733
01:05:05,372 --> 01:05:06,473
[Ben] You are!

1734
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:07,609
Why did you talk to her?

1735
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:09,309
Who?

1736
01:05:09,343 --> 01:05:10,978
Lily! Now she thinks
I'm totally in love with her

1737
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:13,515
a-and that I made you
go up to her

1738
01:05:13,548 --> 01:05:14,649
and chew her out
for dancing with Ivan.

1739
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:16,450
Ben, I didn't...

1740
01:05:16,483 --> 01:05:17,317
I don't know why Mom and Dad
thought you'd be good at this.

1741
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:18,653
You should just go back
to the city.

1742
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:19,386
You know you want to.

1743
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:23,157
[♪♪]

1744
01:05:27,629 --> 01:05:29,062
Excuse me.

1745
01:05:33,535 --> 01:05:34,702
I'm gonna go talk to her.

1746
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,338
Well, I'm going to go
and check on Delilah.

1747
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:46,079
[♪♪]

1748
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:54,722
Delilah,
she'll be fine, she's tough.

1749
01:05:54,756 --> 01:05:57,124
And Ben'll come around.

1750
01:05:57,157 --> 01:05:58,560
I'm a failure.

1751
01:05:58,593 --> 01:05:59,727
You are not a failure, Josie.

1752
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:01,629
Yeah. I am.

1753
01:06:04,732 --> 01:06:07,367
When Ellie died, I...

1754
01:06:09,069 --> 01:06:11,138
[breath shakes]

1755
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:13,474
I didn't lose my sister,
I lost my best friend.

1756
01:06:13,508 --> 01:06:16,176
I know.

1757
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,579
And all I could think was,
you know,

1758
01:06:17,612 --> 01:06:19,112
whatever I'm feeling,

1759
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:22,550
those kids are feeling it
a thousand times harder,

1760
01:06:22,584 --> 01:06:25,219
and I...

1761
01:06:25,252 --> 01:06:26,353
just wanted to help them.

1762
01:06:27,488 --> 01:06:29,389
You are helping them.

1763
01:06:29,423 --> 01:06:31,091
No, I'm not.

1764
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:32,192
Come on, you heard Ben.

1765
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:33,494
I make everything worse.

1766
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:35,062
Josie, you gotta
stop doing that.

1767
01:06:35,095 --> 01:06:37,064
You gotta stop
beating yourself up.

1768
01:06:37,097 --> 01:06:39,567
This is not
an easy circumstance,

1769
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:41,268
for anyone.

1770
01:06:42,469 --> 01:06:44,404
These kids love you...

1771
01:06:44,438 --> 01:06:46,708
no matter what they say.

1772
01:06:46,741 --> 01:06:49,042
It's okay to make mistakes...

1773
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:50,512
everybody's going to,
in this situation.

1774
01:06:50,545 --> 01:06:51,646
Everyone.

1775
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:53,313
But, Cooper, in New York,

1776
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:55,048
when I make a mistake,
I mean, when I would screw up,

1777
01:06:55,082 --> 01:06:56,784
it would only hurt me.

1778
01:06:56,818 --> 01:06:59,086
Since I've been here,
every time I screw up,

1779
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,655
I hurt people I love.

1780
01:07:00,688 --> 01:07:03,056
I hurt people
who are already hurting,

1781
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:04,626
like Ben and Delilah.

1782
01:07:04,659 --> 01:07:07,127
Ellie chose you for a reason.

1783
01:07:08,495 --> 01:07:11,799
Obviously,
she had faith in you.

1784
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:13,367
[tearfully]
Maybe she made a mistake.

1785
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:16,136
In New York,

1786
01:07:16,169 --> 01:07:17,805
I had this clear path
for my life, you know,

1787
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,807
this clear vision
that I could just see.

1788
01:07:19,841 --> 01:07:22,309
I was in control of things,

1789
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:24,378
and I gave all that up,
happily gave that up,

1790
01:07:24,411 --> 01:07:25,847
but to come here

1791
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,416
so I could mess up
everyone else's lives?

1792
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:31,351
I mean,
what's the point of that?

1793
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:33,353
These kids...

1794
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:35,523
they need a parent.

1795
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:38,125
Someone who's gonna be there
for them no matter what,

1796
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:39,594
and you are trying to do that.

1797
01:07:43,698 --> 01:07:45,365
I think I should
go back to New York.

1798
01:07:45,399 --> 01:07:47,167
I don't think you mean that.

1799
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,369
I think I should.

1800
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:51,104
Josie, you have never
been one to give up...

1801
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:52,406
- And I'm not giving up.
- ...when things get tough.

1802
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:53,808
I would never give up on them.

1803
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:57,545
I'm trying to do what's best
for them, Cooper, and...

1804
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,081
I think it's best for them
for me to just go.

1805
01:08:02,482 --> 01:08:04,552
Whatever you do decide...

1806
01:08:04,586 --> 01:08:06,821
[exhaling deeply]

1807
01:08:06,854 --> 01:08:08,221
...just make sure

1808
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:09,824
you're doing it
for the right reasons.

They're so sweet.

1813
01:08:57,204 --> 01:08:58,673
What? No!

1814
01:08:58,706 --> 01:09:00,273
No. Don't do a flash.
You're gonna wake 'em up.

1815

1816
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:03,310

[Ellie laughs]

1818
01:09:05,345 --> 01:09:07,414
We should probably
get them upstairs to bed.

1819
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:09,249
Oh, do we have to?

1820
01:09:09,282 --> 01:09:11,218
I could stay like this forever.

1821
01:09:11,251 --> 01:09:13,286
It's the best feeling.

1822
01:09:15,523 --> 01:09:17,424
Here, give me the phone.

01:09:42,249 --> 01:09:43,350
Hello?

1827
01:09:43,383 --> 01:09:44,418
[Nate] <i>Morning, Josie.</i>

1828
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:45,485
Hey, Nate. What's going on?

1829
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,854
I was headed to work
early today,

1830
01:09:46,888 --> 01:09:48,623
and I saw some lights on
at your family restaurant.

1831
01:09:48,656 --> 01:09:50,424
<i>Seemed kind of strange
at this hour.</i>

1832
01:09:50,457 --> 01:09:51,324
Yeah. Thanks for
letting me know.

1833
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:52,225
I'll check it out.

1834
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:54,729
<i>Of course.</i>

1835
01:09:54,762 --> 01:09:57,264

Jeff!

1840
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,629
What are you doing here?

1841
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:30,565
Um...

1842
01:10:30,598 --> 01:10:32,299
making scones.

1843
01:10:32,332 --> 01:10:33,601
What?

1844
01:10:34,736 --> 01:10:35,837
Do you want one?

1845
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:37,839
Well... yeah.

1846
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:40,007
I love scones.

1847
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,374
Mm!

1848
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:43,010
These are amazing.

1849
01:10:43,044 --> 01:10:44,746
Yeah? Yeah, you think so?

1850
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:46,748
But, Jeff...

1851
01:10:46,781 --> 01:10:48,348
why are you making scones?

1852
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:49,784
I make something different
every day.

1853
01:10:49,817 --> 01:10:51,586
Muffins, biscuits,

1854
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:53,721
those pastries
from the bake sale.

1855
01:10:53,755 --> 01:10:55,388
Okay. But why?

1856
01:10:56,891 --> 01:10:58,760
Uh...

1857
01:10:58,793 --> 01:11:01,361
it's what I love to do.

1858
01:11:01,394 --> 01:11:03,030
It's what I want to do.

1859
01:11:03,064 --> 01:11:04,532
Well, what about your tech job?

1860
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:06,033
Well, what about it?

1861
01:11:06,067 --> 01:11:08,603
See, I wake up super-early
every day,

1862
01:11:08,636 --> 01:11:11,706
come in here, and I just...
I-I bake.

1863
01:11:11,739 --> 01:11:13,674
I bake whatever's on my mind,

1864
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:16,409
and then I clean up the kitchen
before Dad gets here, obviously.

1865
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:17,979
Obviously.

1866
01:11:18,012 --> 01:11:19,446
And then I take 'em
to a bunch of farmers' markets

1867
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:20,782
and I sell them.

1868
01:11:20,815 --> 01:11:22,750
I... I just had no idea.

1869
01:11:22,784 --> 01:11:25,052
Speaking of which,
I gotta get these

1870
01:11:25,086 --> 01:11:27,320
to a farmers' market
in High Woods, so.

1871
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:29,090
You want some company?

1872
01:11:29,123 --> 01:11:30,958
Since I'm probably leaving
in a day or two

1873
01:11:30,992 --> 01:11:32,325
- to go back to the city...
- The city. Yeah.

1874
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:34,896
Hey, don't make fun.

1875
01:11:34,929 --> 01:11:36,396
You know what?
You don't get a choice.

1876
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:37,598
- I'm coming with you.
- Okay.

1877
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:38,833
I gotta pack these up.

1878
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:39,567
All right.

1879
01:11:41,102 --> 01:11:42,703
[Josie]
You sold out so fast.

1880
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:43,738
Seriously,
you're really good at this.

1881
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:45,006
Yeah, thank you.

1882
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:46,373
Hey, you should've seen the day

1883
01:11:46,406 --> 01:11:47,775
that I took
my cran-apple muffins

1884
01:11:47,809 --> 01:11:48,843
to Brentwood,

1885
01:11:48,876 --> 01:11:49,911
'cause it was madness.

1886
01:11:49,944 --> 01:11:51,078
Okay. I just don't understand

1887
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:52,013
why you're not
doing this full-time.

1888
01:11:52,046 --> 01:11:53,648
It's way too risky.

1889
01:11:53,681 --> 01:11:56,117
Besides, can you imagine
how Dad would react

1890
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,653
if I quit tech
to become "the Scone Son"?

1891
01:11:58,686 --> 01:11:59,921
Ah, I think
he'd be okay with scones.

1892
01:11:59,954 --> 01:12:01,722
No, you don't.

1893
01:12:01,756 --> 01:12:04,424
And...

1894
01:12:04,457 --> 01:12:06,093
Jeff, if Ellie's accident
taught me anything,

1895
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:08,495
it's that life is short

1896
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:10,832
and we gotta make
the most of every moment.

1897
01:12:10,865 --> 01:12:13,366
You deserve this.

1898
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,702
I'm sorry
if I haven't been there for you

1899
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:16,137
as much as I should have.

1900
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,806
You know, I...
I guess I just retreated.

1901
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:21,642
You're my brother.
Come on.

1902
01:12:21,676 --> 01:12:23,578
We're always gonna have
each other's backs.

1903
01:12:23,611 --> 01:12:24,879
I just want you to be happy.

1904
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:28,448
So is that why
you're leaving, then?

1905
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:30,852
Because New York
makes you happy?

1906
01:12:32,452 --> 01:12:34,589
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure it out.

1907
01:12:34,622 --> 01:12:36,891
Because even
if I get my accounts back,

1908
01:12:36,924 --> 01:12:38,425
I'm still convincing people
to buy water

1909
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:39,760
from upstate New York

1910
01:12:39,794 --> 01:12:40,695
by telling them
it's from the Czech Republic.

1911
01:12:40,728 --> 01:12:42,697
Wait.

1912
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:44,497
So the water
is the same, but...

1913
01:12:44,532 --> 01:12:46,968
Yeah. Same water,
just fancy new label,

1914
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:49,570
but no matter
how hard we pretend

1915
01:12:49,604 --> 01:12:50,738
it's something
completely different,

1916
01:12:50,771 --> 01:12:52,540
it is what it is.

1917
01:12:52,573 --> 01:12:53,674
It is where it came from.

1918
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:56,376
It's you... the water.

1919
01:12:57,745 --> 01:12:59,814
You're the same old
"New Hope Josie Wilder,"

1920
01:12:59,847 --> 01:13:01,015
but in a fancy

1921
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:02,984
"New York Hotshot
Josie Wilder" label.

1922
01:13:04,451 --> 01:13:05,920
[phone buzzes]

1923
01:13:07,855 --> 01:13:09,123
Cooper. Hey.

1924
01:13:09,156 --> 01:13:10,591
Josie.

1925
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:12,727
<i>Hi. Listen.
I left you a message</i>

1926
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,895
because I was hoping
to see you before I...

1927
01:13:13,928 --> 01:13:14,695
- <i>Josie.</i>
- ...I left.

1928
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:16,130
Ben, uh, never came

1929
01:13:16,163 --> 01:13:17,531
<i>to school today.</i>

1930
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:18,966
What? Wait. Did you call
my mom and dad?

1931
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,534
No. No, I can't.

1932
01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:22,003
You're the legal guardian.

1933
01:13:22,036 --> 01:13:24,005
I've got to bring it to you.
It's your responsibility.

1934
01:13:24,038 --> 01:13:25,640
- What's going on?
- Ben ditched school today.

1935
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:26,707
I talked to him
this morning.

1936
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:28,209
Okay. What'd he say?

1937
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:29,810
He said he was embarrassed
to go to school.

1938
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:30,811
Did he happen to say
where he was going?

1939
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:33,781
Has he run away
before, Delilah?

1940
01:13:33,814 --> 01:13:35,616
Wait. Is that what this is?

1941
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:36,817
Ben's running away from home?

1942
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:38,552
Cool.

1943
01:13:38,586 --> 01:13:39,854
No, it's not cool.

1944
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:40,955
He could be anywhere by now.

1945
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:44,558

I'm so excited.

Tell me the truth.
Did you come up with this plan?

Jeff's had
the talent all along.

2126
01:21:40,668 --> 01:21:42,537
I just rebranded him.

Well, I mean, it depends.
