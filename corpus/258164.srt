1
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:39,377
Just a little to the left,
a little more. Perfect.

2
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:40,954
Daniel...

3
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,818
this concert is not a good idea.

4
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:47,929
Relax, Grandfather, everything will be fine.

5
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:52,259
Come on, we're ready for Matt Marvelous'
sound check. You'll love him.

6
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:54,801
Well, I don't know....

7
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,373
Rock our world, Matt.

8
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:03,811
Oh, okay.

9
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,546
Matt Marvelous?
Well, I can barely hear him.

10
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:14,620
Just wait.

11
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:25,300
See? This guy rocks.

12
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,099
Well, if you say so.

13
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:31,965
If he didn't rock, he wouldn't be
a finalist in the contest.

14
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:43,412
Oh, no. Daniel!

15
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:45,152
What the....

16
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,136
What's going on?

17
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:11,878
Incredible.

18
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,622
Let me go!

19
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,148
The vampire legend is true.

20
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:33,847
This is the life.

21
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,612
Yeah, it sure is.

22
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:38,848
Now that we've solved the mystery
of the sea serpent smugglers...

23
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,549
our vacation should be smooth sailing.

24
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:52,028
Great form, Daphne.

25
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:54,226
Yeah, I'll say.

26
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,511
Oh, boy, this should do for an appetizer.

27
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,773
Hey, everybody. Come take a look.

28
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,634
Sydney Harbour.

29
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:45,278
Wow! We're finally in Australia.

30
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:49,023
This is going to be the best vacation ever.

31
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,319
Uh-huh!

32
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:03,432
And no vacation would be complete
without the Mystery Machine.

33
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,754
This guidebook says Sydney
has the best restaurants...

34
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,730
in the entire southern hemisphere.

35
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:34,730
Like, that's great, Velma, but Scoob
and I have got the food situation covered.

36
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,001
Uh-huh.

37
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:41,540
Doggie bags.

38
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,608
That's right, Scoob. Doggie bags.

39
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:53,182
Better eat now, guys.
We've got sightseeing to do...

40
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,191
and pictures to take. Say "Vegemite."

41
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:57,781
Vegemite.

42
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,372
What an incredible view.

43
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:14,209
You can see the whole continent up here.

44
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,944
The Sydney Harbour Bridge
is the world's largest free-standing bridge.

45
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:24,381
Like, that's a long way down, huh, Scoob?

46
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:32,927
What's with the groovy ceiling
on that place?

47
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:37,562
That's the Sydney Opera House.
It's the city's most famous landmark.

48
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:41,435
It looks like an old-fashioned sailing ship.

49
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,839
That's the idea, Shaggy.

50
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:46,402
Oh, wow!

51
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,341
What is it, Daphne?

52
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:52,245
I finally found what I've been looking for.
Bondi beach.

53
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,089
Lunch is served!

54
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,301
Be right there, Freddie.

55
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:15,835
Come on, gang!
Everything's going to get cold.

56
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:18,731
Let's catch this wave.

57
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,173
I'm hungry.

58
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:30,875
What a sheila.

59
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,115
I'll say, mate.

60
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,104
Come on, Scoob, he's just a little guy.
No need to get all crabby.

61
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,022
Come here, you guys. I've got a great idea.

62
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,058
How do you guys feel
about exploring the outback?

63
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,789
Outback?

64
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,166
Sure, Australia's not all beach.
The outback's the wild, inland part.

65
00:10:55,604 --> 00:11:00,007
My guidebook says it makes up
almost 85 percent of the continent.

66
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,340
Like, I know what the outback is...

67
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:06,279
and I don't want to go "out back"
to look at dust and trees.

68
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,852
Come on, Shaggy, I'm sure
there's more to see than that.

69
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:14,812
And I've got 17 rolls of film
to capture it all.

70
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,124
What if you could hear great music
while you were there?

71
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:20,185
In the middle of nowhere?

72
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:22,489
Not "nowhere." There, look.

73
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:27,862
The Vampire Rock Music Festival!

74
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:30,096
Vampire?

75
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:33,702
That sounds like a lot of fun, Freddie!

76
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,837
Vampire Rock is located right
in the middle of Australia.

77
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:41,107
We can see a lot of the outback
on our way there.

78
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,918
Scoob and I don't think it's a good idea...

79
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:46,580
going to a place where vampires rock.

80
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:49,919
That's asking for trouble.

81
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,394
That's just the name of the place.

82
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:56,491
And there's no such thing as vampires.

83
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,631
And I'm sure a festival that big...

84
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:01,761
will have every
concession stand imaginable.

85
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:07,264
Licorice pizza, chocolate-covered
corn on the cob, tutti-frutti ice cream...

86
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:10,473
not to mention some great local food.

87
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:13,007
Ready.

88
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,611
Real music lovers.

89
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:19,518
Like, who ever heard
of Australian vampires, anyway?

90
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:26,217
The rules of the contest are very simple.

91
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:29,662
It's for unsigned bands,
no one can enter more than once.

92
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:34,859
And as I've told you again and again,
each contestant only gets three minutes.

93
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,402
But the Bad Omens' best song lasts five.

94
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:43,104
Daniel and I have set the rules,
and rules are rules, Jasper.

95
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,143
Can't you bend the rules a little?

96
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:49,408
Especially for such an upstanding group
of young people?

97
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,845
This better be important.

98
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:56,482
I've got things to pierce.

99
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,624
I'm trying to find a new shade of eyeliner.

100
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,890
You were saying?

101
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:08,335
Come on, Russell,
now that Matt Marvelous is gone...

102
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:11,635
it's obvious the Bad Omens
are the best in the contest.

103
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,676
Why not just declare us the winner now?

104
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:16,878
-Yeah.
-Obviously.

105
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:21,940
Jasper, get out of my face
or the Bad Omens won't perform at all.

106
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,549
You're making a big mistake, Russell.

107
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:27,714
I didn't have to come back here.

108
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,759
Especially after what happened
to Wildwind last year.

109
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:37,055
But I am back. And I intend
to have my group win this time.

110
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,492
I'm warning you.

111
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:43,498
Let's get out of here.

112
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:58,147
-How much of that did you hear, partner?
-Enough.

113
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:01,482
Jasper's never going to get over
what happened to Wildwind.

114
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,185
I can't believe it's been almost a year
since they disappeared.

115
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:09,863
From what you told me about last night,
it sounds like they're making a comeback.

116
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:12,362
Maybe it's true what they say.

117
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,499
About Wildwind being turned
into vampires?

118
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:18,138
Come on, that's just a local myth.

119
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:21,269
So what do you think happened
to Matt Marvelous then?

120
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,868
You saw the vampires
with your own two eyes.

121
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,312
I don't know what I saw, Russell.

122
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:28,610
Well, the crew looked
all over Vampire Rock.

123
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:31,414
There's no sign of Matt or your vampires.

124
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:35,053
Maybe my grandfather was right.

125
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,282
Maybe we should postpone the festival.

126
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:41,523
No way. We've both worked too hard
to quit now, Daniel.

127
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,127
You're right. And the show must go on.

128
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:49,162
This kidnapping makes me nervous,
Russell. Very nervous.

129
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,836
There are the Scooby Snacks!

130
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,948
Aren't you guys ever going to stop
playing that game?

131
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,922
Like I said before, nothing to look at
but dust and trees.

132
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:14,317
You'd be surprised, Shaggy,
the outback is full of life.

133
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:18,991
Oh, boy, I'll believe it when I see it.

134
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,947
Just a few more miles, I mean kilometers.

135
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,143
Anyway, we're almost there.

136
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:26,350
It's amazing that they're having
a music festival way out here.

137
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:31,561
There it is, Vampire Rock.

138
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:35,904
-Wow!
-It's spectacular.

139
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,996
Man, we really are
in the middle of nowhere.

140
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:44,241
It says the locals call it Vampire Rock
because they believe the Yowie Yahoo...

141
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,338
Iives in the rock's caves.

142
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:48,545
The Yowie Yahoo?

143
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,881
An ancient Australian vampire.

144
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:56,889
We were wrong, Scoob.
There are Australian vampires.

145
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,457
Next time I agree to go to a place
named after a vampire...

146
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:05,932
I need you to do me a favor, Scoob.

147
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,025
What?

148
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:09,002
Like, talk me out of it.

149
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:16,237
Are we in the right place, Freddie?

150
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,074
Uh-huh. This is it.

151
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,795
What is it, Scoob?

152
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:49,668
Like, very funny, Scoob.
You almost had me going there.

153
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:04,489
Like, what is it now?

154
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:15,034
It's the Yowie Yahoo!

155
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:16,263
Where?

156
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,033
Come on, you two.
We don't have time for games.

157
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:26,308
It's no game. Scoob and I saw
the Yowie Yahoo right over there.

158
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:32,476
I already told you guys,
there's no such thing as a vampire.

159
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,917
Then what's making all that noise?

160
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,850
Whatever it is, it's moving closer.

161
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:45,361
Well, do something, Freddie.

162
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,465
It's the vampire!

163
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:26,738
Do you guys hear that?

164
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,107
Come on, gang, there must be
somebody else around here.

165
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,243
This way.

166
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,497
Hey, the Hex Girls!

167
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:52,933
I knew those tunes sounded familiar.

168
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:58,036
It is you.

169
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,934
Boy, are we glad to see you.

170
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:02,976
What are you doing here?

171
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:05,070
Well, we were on vacation.

172
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,907
And we thought
we'd check out the festival.

173
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:10,281
Cool. We're opening the festival.

174
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,547
How long have you guys been here?

175
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:14,350
A couple of days. Why?

176
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,853
Have you seen anything strange
since you arrived?

177
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:19,017
Strange?

178
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:20,561
Like what?

179
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:25,566
Like what? How about big,
creepy and scary....

180
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:29,433
I was wondering why the music stopped.

181
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,597
We came to make sure you were all right.

182
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:33,072
Of course we're all right.

183
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:34,438
Why wouldn't we be?

184
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:35,533
Just checking.

185
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,874
Are you going to introduce us
to your friends?

186
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:41,404
Yeah. These are our friends from America:

187
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:46,216
-Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy--
-And Scooby-Doo.

188
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,746
G'day.

189
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:50,053
Welcome. Sorry we interrupted.

190
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,356
We're trying to clear up some trouble
before the festival starts.

191
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:55,020
What's going on?

192
00:21:55,163 --> 00:21:58,894
The finalists in our unsigned-band
contest are disappearing.

193
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:00,331
Well, that's not good.

194
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:04,133
Did you say, "disappeared"?

195
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,198
The groups are bailing
as quickly as they arrive.

196
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:10,870
They hear Matt Marvelous
has been kidnapped and go...

197
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:12,538
from "g'day" to "good-bye."

198
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,275
Kidnapped? By who?

199
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:18,342
Maybe by a big, creepy and scary....

200
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:19,781
Vampire.

201
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:24,720
Daniel, I warned you
terrible things would happen.

202
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,300
Who was that spooky old man?

203
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:37,332
That was my grandfather,
Malcolm llliwara.

204
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:41,135
I meant spooky in a good way.

205
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:46,446
You'll have to forgive him. He's very upset.

206
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:50,342
I understand.
I'm pretty upset myself right now.

207
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:54,151
What did your grandfather mean
by "terrible things"?

208
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,116
The Yowie Yahoo.

209
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,091
You mean the vampire who lives in there?

210
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,786
Yeah. Him and his vampire minions.

211
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:05,864
Minions? You mean he has help?

212
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:09,495
Well, so they say.
But there's no such thing as vampires.

213
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,129
Don't you mean rock star vampires?

214
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,233
That's Wildwind.

215
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:18,668
I've seen groups like Wildwind
in my parent's record collection.

216
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:21,945
Yeah. Check out
the makeup and costumes.

217
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:26,585
This poster must be from a long time ago.

218
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:30,517
Nope. The members of Wildwind are
only a couple of years older than you.

219
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:32,924
Wildwind wanted to bring glam rock back.

220
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,828
They did an amazing song
at last year's unsigned-band contest.

221
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:40,061
Dark Skull played guitar,
Stormy Weathers played bass...

222
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:42,069
and Lightning Strikes was on drums.

223
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:45,034
Wow! So you saw them perform?

224
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:49,207
I sure did.
They deserved better than third place.

225
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:50,968
What happened to them?

226
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:55,174
After they lost the contest,
they went up to Vampire Rock to camp.

227
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,084
They were never heard from again.

228
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,554
They just disappeared?

229
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,526
The locals believe the Yowie Yahoo
turned them into vampires.

230
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:08,062
I'm with the locals.

231
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,860
That would explain
the big, creepy, and scary....

232
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:13,457
All right, Shaggy, we get your point.

233
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:17,669
There's no such thing as vampires.
You said it yourself, Daniel.

234
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:21,106
Well, maybe not.
But Daniel says he saw Matt Marvelous...

235
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:24,976
get kidnapped by three vampires
who looked like Wildwind.

236
00:24:27,182 --> 00:24:29,810
I never actually said, "Vampires."

237
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,081
Do you have a better explanation?

238
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:35,851
Whoever or whatever they were,
they were pretty convincing.

239
00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:38,422
Now I don't know what to think.

240
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,825
When did this all start, Daniel?

241
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:44,688
Ever since I was a boy, my grandfather
told me the Yowie Yahoo...

242
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:47,735
Iived in Vampire Rock.
I never believed him.

243
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:49,360
But in the past few months...

244
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:52,929
there have been a lot of strange lights
and sounds coming from up there.

245
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:56,376
I'd love to find out what's really going on.

246
00:24:56,811 --> 00:25:00,645
Well, gang, it looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.

247
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:07,185
A mystery?

248
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,723
We'll need to investigate this
from the inside.

249
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:13,693
And the best way to do that
is to go undercover as a rock band.

250
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:18,188
If we're lucky, the Wildwind vampires
will try to kidnap us next.

251
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:21,401
I don't want to be that lucky.

252
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:23,164
That's a great idea, Freddie.

253
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:25,331
I'm not so sure about this.

254
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,865
They may be our only hope.

255
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:30,977
I guess it could work.
Especially if it keeps...

256
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:34,106
my pick to win the contest
from getting kidnapped.

257
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:35,410
And who's that?

258
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:38,281
Two Skinny Dudes.
They haven't shown up yet.

259
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:43,222
I know you've never seen them perform,
but trust me, they're the real deal.

260
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:45,454
So what do you say?

261
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:48,893
Well, okay. But don't say I didn't warn you.

262
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:52,599
Scoob and I wouldn't mind
sitting this one out.

263
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:56,837
Maybe the group should be a trio.

264
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:01,172
Come on, you chickens.

265
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:04,076
Luna, Dusk and I will help you
look the part.

266
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,739
Yeah, there's a wardrobe room backstage.

267
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,783
This is going to be fun.

268
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:13,551
I knew coming to a place
called Vampire Rock was a bad idea.

269
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,349
How do rock stars walk in these?

270
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,577
Pretend they're high heels.

271
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:48,850
I'm not good at those either.

272
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:07,069
I don't know how well we'll play,
but at least we look the part.

273
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:09,501
I hope we don't have to play at all.

274
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:11,670
I thought you loved to sing, Velma.

275
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:15,011
Not in front of so many people.
I get stage fright.

276
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,849
Well, I get vampire fright.

277
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,786
Hey, look at this.

278
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,622
Makeup?

279
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:31,559
Stage makeup actually.
So the audience can see you better.

280
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,332
Matt Marvelous was a musician.

281
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:38,463
Even so, I doubt he'd wear this color.
It's glowing white.

282
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:43,603
And look at this, it's a footprint.
From a hiking boot to be exact.

283
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,471
Wow, that's strange.

284
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:47,572
How so?

285
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:51,415
The print is sticky like glue.
But it's not glue exactly.

286
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,088
I don't know what it is.

287
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:00,052
You're the new competition?

288
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:04,356
Yeah, we're taking Matt Marvelous'
place in the contest.

289
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:10,363
You must be Jasper Ridgeway.

290
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:12,702
And you must be the Bad Omens.

291
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:16,108
Russell warned, I mean, told us about you.

292
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:19,774
Whoever heard of band with a dog in it?

293
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:35,194
Why don't you amateurs take a break?

294
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,899
Yeah, it's time for a real band to play.

295
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:44,599
Let's go, gang, we need to set up camp
for the night anyway.

296
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:48,400
Camping? How primitive.
I choose to travel...

297
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:51,535
in a fully furnished, air-conditioned trailer.

298
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:55,606
Russell told us about another band
you used to manage, Wildwind.

299
00:28:57,085 --> 00:29:00,486
Yes, they were true superstars.

300
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,990
I had such high hopes for them.

301
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:06,220
Until that fateful night last year.

302
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:10,828
I don't like to talk to about it.
It's just too upsetting.

303
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:16,734
Well, back to the trailer.
I can't take this heat any longer.

304
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,865
Enjoy your rehearsal.

305
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:25,772
Stupid golf cart!

306
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:32,086
Nice to meet you, too.

307
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:37,519
Let's get out of these costumes
and start looking for clues.

308
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,926
And get you into more comfortable shoes.

309
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:49,266
I think we may have just met
our so-called vampires.

310
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:51,863
The Bad Omens?

311
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,368
Exactly.

312
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:58,305
Jasper Ridgeway seems the kind of guy
who'd do anything to have his band win.

313
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:01,013
You think he put them up to it?

314
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:12,021
The makeup the Bad Omens were wearing
looks like the stage makeup I found.

315
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:16,897
Maybe we should talk to Daniel
and Russell and find out more about them.

316
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:20,726
I bet Jasper's trailer could tell us
a thing or two.

317
00:30:21,102 --> 00:30:23,093
Yeah, let's check it out.

318
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:26,538
Shaggy and Scooby, you see
what you can dig up around here.

319
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:31,401
We'll leave no snow cone,
I mean, stone unturned.

320
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:42,548
Jasper wasn't kidding when he said
he travels in style.

321
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,786
We've got to get a look inside.

322
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:46,517
How are we going to do that?

323
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,563
We need to lure him out.
And I've got a plan.

324
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:50,490
Fred?

325
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:52,396
Wait, this is brilliant.

326
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,958
I'm going to go off
into those bushes over there...

327
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:57,231
and imitate the call
of the wild kookaburra.

328
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:58,363
But, Fred....

329
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,270
Hold on, Velma, I'm on a roll.

330
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:03,037
Now, Daphne, I want you
to disguise yourself...

331
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,443
as an aboriginal medicine woman and--

332
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:07,447
-Fred!
-What?

333
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:10,576
Or, we could just use the front door.

334
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,441
Or that.

335
00:31:14,822 --> 00:31:16,153
All clear.

336
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,055
This is better than a museum.

337
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:23,429
Whoa. Totally retro.

338
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:26,260
You're telling me.

339
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:29,666
Look, it's a waterbed.

340
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:33,538
Seems like Jasper can't let go of the past.

341
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:38,142
In more ways than one.

342
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:44,446
Come on, girls, we've got to work fast.
Jasper could show up at any minute.

343
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,214
There's so much stuff in here...

344
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:49,450
it's going to be hard to tell the clues
from the collectibles.

345
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:54,088
Jinkies! I think I already found one.

346
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:56,957
Great work, Velma.

347
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,258
This looks exactly like the costume...

348
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,996
Dark Skull of Wildwind wore
in that poster.

349
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,672
The costumes for Lightning Strikes
and Stormy Weathers are in here, too.

350
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:12,107
So Jasper Ridgeway has reproductions
of all the Wildwind costumes.

351
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,179
Interesting.

352
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:23,286
They call this Australian bread "damper."

353
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:26,949
But it's sure not putting
a damper on my appetite.

354
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,771
What's next, old buddy?

355
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:49,511
Vampires.

356
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,346
Now I'm not hungry at all!

357
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:08,149
What the....

358
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:34,938
What is that?

359
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:06,870
Gosh, what happened here?

360
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:10,242
What's with all this smoke?

361
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:12,011
It burns my eyes.

362
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:15,881
It smells so sweet, like cotton candy.

363
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,016
Cotton candy?

364
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:20,523
Shaggy and Scooby?

365
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:22,959
What happened to the Bad Omens?

366
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:26,159
The Yowie Yahoo and
the Wildwind vampires...

367
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:28,429
showed up and band-napped them.

368
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:30,436
Scoob and I thought we were next.

369
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:36,838
There goes our prime suspects.

370
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,005
You actually saw
the Wildwind vampires, Shaggy?

371
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:42,946
We both did.

372
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:46,342
What did they look like?

373
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:54,127
Exactly like the guys on that poster,
only scarier.

374
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:57,320
And they had those creepy red eyes.

375
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,796
Yeah, red.

376
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,296
Well, whoever it was,
they kidnapped the Bad Omens.

377
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:06,363
Kidnapped? Not again.

378
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:10,503
The Bad Omens can't be kidnapped.
They need to win the contest.

379
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:13,107
It's a good thing you weren't here.

380
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:16,345
Those vampires would have flown off
with you, too.

381
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:20,645
I wish they had.
Now I'll be plagued by guilt.

382
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:24,313
I should have stayed with them
instead of going back to my trailer.

383
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,521
Trailer....

384
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:30,295
What happened here?

385
00:37:30,364 --> 00:37:34,027
My band is gone!
What are we going to do?

386
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,160
There's strength in numbers.

387
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:39,695
Let's get the Hex Girls and Russell,
and then camp in one group.

388
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:43,937
Russell already went home,
along with all the other festival staff.

389
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:46,375
I wish I could say the same thing.

390
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,811
And if the vampires come back
when we're sleeping, what then?

391
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:53,982
We can take turns standing watch.

392
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:56,546
And you guys have the first tour of duty...

393
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:03,730
which starts now.

394
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:06,722
Would you each do it for a Scooby Snack?

395
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:09,895
Or maybe two Scooby Snacks?

396
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:17,208
There might be room in my tummy
for a Scooby Snack or two.

397
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:19,109
How about you, Scoob?

398
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,171
Yeah, Scooby Snack!

399
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:28,280
Everyone get some rest, because
you're being watched over by the best.

400
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:55,475
Not again!

401
00:38:58,352 --> 00:38:59,876
It's the vampires!

402
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:06,316
Run!

403
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:16,969
The vampires are in a motorcycle gang?

404
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:35,250
You're not vampires. Who are you?

405
00:39:35,823 --> 00:39:37,313
Two Skinny Dudes.

406
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,559
Like, me, too.

407
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:46,993
We're the band Two Skinny Dudes.
I'm Barry and this is my brother Harry.

408
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,195
Finally. I've heard so much
about you from Russell.

409
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,999
Glad you made it here all right.

410
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:53,563
Why wouldn't we?

411
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:55,971
Some of the other bands
have been kidnapped.

412
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,837
By vampires.

413
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:04,840
If you weren't kidnapped,
where have you been?

414
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:08,583
Exploring Vampire Rock.

415
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,558
We liked it so much,
we decided to camp up there.

416
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:14,384
But we didn't see a single vampire.

417
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:17,921
Matt Marvelous and
the Bad Omens sure did.

418
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:21,757
The other finalists got so scared
they all drove back to Sydney.

419
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:26,035
That means we're the only ones left?

420
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:28,098
Does this mean we win the contest?

421
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:31,378
Not quite. We had a last minute entry.

422
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:45,482
What do you think?

423
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,423
Keep working on it.

424
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:54,700
What's all the racket?
Did you find my band?

425
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:57,301
No, but we found another one.

426
00:40:57,638 --> 00:41:00,004
Jasper, meet Two Skinny Dudes.

427
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:02,440
Two Skinny Dudes.

428
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:07,409
Russell tells me you're the next big thing.

429
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:11,212
You boys have a manager?

430
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:14,515
No.

431
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:17,250
Groovy.

432
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,383
Why don't you come into my trailer...

433
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,728
and let me tell you what I can do
for your careers.

434
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:28,464
Jeepers. He works fast.

435
00:41:29,603 --> 00:41:33,937
Jasper seemed to forget about
the Bad Omens pretty quickly.

436
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:37,974
We should get going.

437
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:40,343
We've still got two missing bands
out there...

438
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,780
and the concert starts tonight at 6:00.

439
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,579
What's with all the noise?

440
00:41:45,853 --> 00:41:48,321
How are we supposed to rest
for the show tonight?

441
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,988
In other words, would you mind?

442
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:54,656
Divas.

443
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,166
I pulled up more research on vampires.

444
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:08,566
Anything on how to avoid them?

445
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:12,243
You can ask my grandfather.
He knows all about the local legends.

446
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:14,606
Especially the Yowie Yahoo.

447
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:16,740
Let's see.

448
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:18,284
"Vampires hate sunlight.

449
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:20,217
"They can't cross running water."

450
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,485
And get this: "The more people a vampire
puts under his control...

451
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:27,419
"the greater his power becomes."

452
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:32,292
That would explain why the Yowie Yahoo
is having Wildwind kidnap people.

453
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,192
That is, if you believe he's real.

454
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:41,832
It also says, "Vampires don't appear
on film when their pictures are taken."

455
00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:44,677
Maybe they're just camera shy.

456
00:42:45,512 --> 00:42:48,242
Here we are, Fred. Up there.
Ahead on the left.

457
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:01,354
Grandfather, these are
some friends of mine.

458
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:05,590
Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby.

459
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,427
Yes, I saw you at the festival.

460
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:10,727
They're here to help with our problem.

461
00:43:11,038 --> 00:43:13,302
What's the deal with the smoke signals?

462
00:43:13,907 --> 00:43:16,432
There's a tribal council meeting
later today.

463
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,205
I'm letting the others know.

464
00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:20,775
You could just use the phone, Grandfather.

465
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,878
We've always used smoke signals
to announce tribal council meetings.

466
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:28,952
The smoke smells really good.
What are you burning?

467
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:33,187
The wood is from the red gum tree.
We use its flowers to make honey.

468
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,258
That red gum over there is in full bloom.

469
00:44:02,256 --> 00:44:05,350
It is good of all of you
to take me to the council meeting.

470
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:08,018
Daniel was telling us that you know...

471
00:44:08,095 --> 00:44:11,087
all about the Yowie Yahoo legend,
Mr. Illiwara.

472
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,222
Please, call me Malcolm.

473
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:17,364
I can tell you many things
about the Yowie Yahoo, young lady.

474
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,172
But, you may not like what you hear.

475
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:22,771
Can you tell us what happened
to Wildwind?

476
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,446
Wildwind foolishly went up
to Vampire Rock after dark.

477
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,608
They were easy prey for the Yowie Yahoo.

478
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:33,210
Just like all the people attending
the festival will be.

479
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:37,282
So what can we do to keep him and
his rock-star pals away?

480
00:44:38,192 --> 00:44:42,925
According to legend, the only thing
that can destroy a vampire is sunlight.

481
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:46,063
According to legends, Grandfather.

482
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:49,436
It's believed they also fear the dingo.

483
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,906
They could be your distant cousins,
Scoob. See if they'll help us out.

484
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,408
Don't bother me, Scoob!

485
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:37,848
Looks like vampires aren't
the only monsters around here.

486
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:41,512
That crocodile almost had
his very own Scooby Snack.

487
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:43,522
Thank goodness he didn't.

488
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,820
I scheduled your group to perform tonight.

489
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,854
Perform?

490
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:49,555
Right after the Hex Girls.

491
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:51,897
We hope you'll come, Malcolm.

492
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:52,954
I can't.

493
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,193
Not when I believe the festival
shouldn't take place at all.

494
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,867
I know how you feel, Grandfather.
But I've got a show to do.

495
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:02,070
Smoke!

496
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:04,976
They're answering
one of my smoke signals.

497
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:07,603
It's my friend on the other side
of Vampire Rock.

498
00:46:08,315 --> 00:46:09,839
We're almost there.

499
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:12,482
Can you show me how to do that?

500
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,315
If the vampires come back, I want
to send an S.O.S. "Save our Shaggy."

501
00:46:21,895 --> 00:46:23,260
One, two, three, four!

502
00:46:56,296 --> 00:46:59,663
-Jinkies!
-There really is a Yowie Yahoo.

503
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:02,766
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

504
00:47:14,815 --> 00:47:16,180
No. Not now!

505
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:18,908
You're ruining our encore.

506
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:27,592
The Hex Girls are in trouble!

507
00:47:50,217 --> 00:47:51,206
Now what?

508
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,879
They must be heading to Vampire Rock.

509
00:47:54,254 --> 00:47:56,245
We need to go after them.

510
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,121
Great idea, Fred!

511
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:00,989
While you're gone, Scoob and l
will practice our number.

512
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:17,043
Weren't the Hex Girls terrific?

513
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,178
We'll be taking a short break.
See you real soon.

514
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:23,276
What are we going to do?

515
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:26,609
Maybe my grandfather was right.
Where's Russell?

516
00:48:26,787 --> 00:48:29,221
We've got to cancel the rest of the show.

517
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:30,517
Not yet.

518
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:33,151
I've got a plan that will end this
once and for all.

519
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:35,326
Now here's what we do.

520
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:47,732
I knew Vampire Rock was big,
but not this big.

521
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:52,236
It's going to be harder finding
the Hex Girls than we thought.

522
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:57,812
We need to split up.

523
00:48:58,418 --> 00:49:00,545
Daphne, Velma, and I will head this way.

524
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,948
Shaggy and Scooby,
you circle around in the other direction.

525
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,855
Vacation has really brought us
closer together.

526
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:11,696
It's a shame to split up now.

527
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:23,737
Vampire Rock seems to be just that.
Solid rock.

528
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:27,104
There's got to be a way in somehow.

529
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:34,215
You were saying?

530
00:49:34,788 --> 00:49:38,224
We've walked all the way
around this creepy rock.

531
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,260
What was that?

532
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:45,994
Quit kidding around, Scoob.

533
00:49:48,602 --> 00:49:50,433
Dingo dogs!

534
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:58,041
Secret passages always lead somewhere.

535
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,174
Right now, we should be experiencing
total cave darkness.

536
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:06,444
But we're not, so....

537
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,318
There must be light coming
from inside the cave.

538
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,251
Over there!

539
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,326
Wow! I was expecting a Vampire's lair
to be more....

540
00:50:22,402 --> 00:50:24,529
I don't know, spooky.

541
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:27,837
It's like an underground warehouse.

542
00:50:29,643 --> 00:50:31,975
These lanterns didn't light themselves.

543
00:50:32,379 --> 00:50:33,368
Right, Velma.

544
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,644
They're only big enough
to hold a few hours worth of oil.

545
00:50:37,084 --> 00:50:40,451
That means, someone had to be here
a little while ago.

546
00:50:42,022 --> 00:50:45,788
They also used the equipment.
This fan is still warm.

547
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:47,953
And so is this light.

548
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:50,590
This equipment's been used all right.

549
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:52,694
The question is why?

550
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,189
And where?

551
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:55,632
And by who?

552
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,890
No coffins?

553
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:25,661
Fred! Velma!

554
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:50,749
We can't run. We can't climb.

555
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,159
How are we going to get out of here?

556
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,237
Good try, buddy, but we need a miracle.

557
00:53:11,805 --> 00:53:13,864
Like I said, a miracle.

558
00:53:14,341 --> 00:53:17,367
Or Daphne doing a dive off a cliff.

559
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:20,674
-That's a 10!
-Thanks, guys.

560
00:53:23,049 --> 00:53:24,448
What a mess.

561
00:53:24,918 --> 00:53:26,818
You think Daphne's in here?

562
00:53:26,887 --> 00:53:28,821
If she is, she's not alone.

563
00:53:30,023 --> 00:53:32,491
I'm going to check down here.

564
00:53:33,026 --> 00:53:35,460
Daphne!

565
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,656
My glasses.

566
00:53:41,434 --> 00:53:42,833
I lost my glasses.

567
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,169
Thanks, Freddie.

568
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:48,866
I was getting worried.

569
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:54,042
Now I am worried.

570
00:54:02,722 --> 00:54:04,747
Velma! Did you find Daphne?

571
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,020
Wherever Daphne is...

572
00:54:08,395 --> 00:54:10,329
she's a lot safer than we are.

573
00:54:15,969 --> 00:54:17,027
Run!

574
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:25,473
And he was hanging upside down.
Then he took off after me.

575
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,912
Come on,
we've got to find Fred and Velma.

576
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,652
Or they could find us.

577
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,595
Fred! Velma! You're all right.

578
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,130
Not if we don't get out of here.

579
00:54:54,274 --> 00:54:58,005
I need a vacation from this vacation.

580
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,239
It's the Yowie Yahoo!

581
00:55:17,263 --> 00:55:19,731
Come on! Everyone over the bridge!

582
00:55:46,393 --> 00:55:50,523
If there was ever a time
not to be calm, this is it!

583
00:56:29,702 --> 00:56:31,966
Scooby! Get back here!

584
00:56:55,929 --> 00:56:59,160
The Yowie Yahoo sure is full of hot air.

585
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:01,699
Freddie, are you okay?

586
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:04,631
Now I know how my socks feel
in the dryer.

587
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,444
I feel the same way, Scooby.

588
00:57:21,788 --> 00:57:23,779
It's the dingo dogs!

589
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:32,087
They're getting away!

590
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:36,066
They've got to get inside
before the sun comes out.

591
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:42,697
Scoob, tell your cousins,
"Don't leave us here with the...."

592
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,441
Yowie Yahoo!

593
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,543
Hang on tight, guys.

594
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,448
Fred, do we have a choice?

595
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:56,418
The sun is almost up.

596
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,157
The Yowie Yahoo has to get inside
Vampire Rock, too.

597
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:05,462
If he doesn't, the sun will destroy him.

598
00:58:21,548 --> 00:58:23,015
Scooby, you did it!

599
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,308
You defeated the Yowie Yahoo.

600
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,577
He sure didn't go quietly.

601
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,623
How about that, Scooby?
You're an honorary dingo.

602
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:43,028
Dingo? Hooray!

603
00:58:50,176 --> 00:58:52,371
But what about the Hex Girls?

604
00:58:52,812 --> 00:58:56,304
We could just ask the vampires
where they are.

605
00:59:00,086 --> 00:59:01,713
Quick! Over the bridge!

606
00:59:02,388 --> 00:59:04,379
Don't worry gang. I've got you!

607
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,092
As long as you've got us and they don't!

608
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:13,799
The sunlight destroyed the Yowie Yahoo.
Why isn't it destroying Wildwind?

609
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,967
You want to stop and ask them
or keep on running?

610
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:19,296
No thanks.

611
00:59:20,106 --> 00:59:21,767
We just crossed running water.

612
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:24,435
The vampires shouldn't be able
to follow us.

613
00:59:25,345 --> 00:59:27,813
Didn't those vampires read the rule book?

614
00:59:40,226 --> 00:59:41,284
Now!

615
01:00:03,216 --> 01:00:04,911
Nice work, Daniel.

616
01:00:17,964 --> 01:00:21,161
I didn't think anything
would stop those vampires.

617
01:00:21,934 --> 01:00:24,095
That's because they're not real vampires.

618
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:27,230
If they were,
they wouldn't have been captured on film.

619
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:29,372
Jolly good work.

620
01:00:29,942 --> 01:00:31,705
You've snared the vampires.

621
01:00:32,178 --> 01:00:34,874
Now we can find out
what happened to the bands.

622
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:38,041
At first we thought
the Bad Omens were behind all this.

623
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:42,018
But when they disappeared,
we had to search for new suspects.

624
01:00:49,862 --> 01:00:52,387
Well, I'll be. Two Skinny Dudes.

625
01:00:53,266 --> 01:00:55,700
That's two vampires. Who's the third?

626
01:00:58,738 --> 01:00:59,966
Russell!

627
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,804
Russell, you were my partner.
This doesn't make any sense.

628
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,802
I'm with Daniel.

629
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,780
Nobody say anything.

630
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,244
That's fine.

631
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:15,912
We can do all the talking and still
get to the bottom of this mystery.

632
01:01:15,988 --> 01:01:18,821
It took us a while
to put all the pieces together.

633
01:01:19,158 --> 01:01:22,753
When we saw Jasper getting so chummy
with the Two Skinny Dudes...

634
01:01:23,029 --> 01:01:25,497
we thought he might be the third vampire.

635
01:01:25,898 --> 01:01:26,887
Me?

636
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:29,328
I could never wear all that makeup.

637
01:01:29,535 --> 01:01:31,628
I've got very sensitive skin.

638
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,406
You managed the Bad Omens, Jasper.

639
01:01:34,674 --> 01:01:36,642
We thought you took
some of their makeup...

640
01:01:36,709 --> 01:01:40,805
so you and the Two Skinny Dudes
could copy Wildwind's glam-rock look.

641
01:01:41,214 --> 01:01:44,672
We also paid a visit to your trailer
when you said you'd be there.

642
01:01:44,751 --> 01:01:46,651
You were nowhere to be found.

643
01:01:46,853 --> 01:01:48,320
That's not a crime.

644
01:01:49,655 --> 01:01:53,284
Okay. Confession time.

645
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:55,126
I wasn't in my trailer...

646
01:01:55,194 --> 01:01:58,857
because I was meeting with
the Hex Girls about being their manager.

647
01:01:59,232 --> 01:02:02,395
I didn't want the Bad Omens
to find out what I was doing.

648
01:02:02,502 --> 01:02:06,939
But that doesn't explain why you have
costumes like the ones Wildwind wore.

649
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:10,465
Wildwind was the greatest band
I ever managed.

650
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:15,274
I had those costumes made to remind me
of all the good times we had together.

651
01:02:16,616 --> 01:02:18,675
I wish I knew what happened to them.

652
01:02:18,751 --> 01:02:20,776
Why don't you ask them yourself?

653
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,080
What the....

654
01:02:23,589 --> 01:02:26,285
Okay. Now I'm really confused.

655
01:02:27,126 --> 01:02:28,320
Me, too.

656
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:40,967
Recognize them now?

657
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:46,939
I don't believe it. Wildwind, you're alive.

658
01:02:47,647 --> 01:02:50,138
We should have won
that contest last year.

659
01:02:50,383 --> 01:02:53,011
When we didn't, we decided to disappear.

660
01:02:54,954 --> 01:02:58,685
We thought disappearing mysteriously
would help our careers.

661
01:03:01,427 --> 01:03:03,486
Then we remembered
the rules of the contest...

662
01:03:03,563 --> 01:03:05,428
meant we couldn't enter again.

663
01:03:05,731 --> 01:03:08,029
We planned on making
a triumphant return...

664
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,261
at this year's unsigned-band contest.

665
01:03:14,173 --> 01:03:17,574
Right. That's when you came up with
a way to get around those rules...

666
01:03:17,643 --> 01:03:20,168
and make sure you'd win
this year's contest.

667
01:03:21,981 --> 01:03:25,041
With Dark Skull already posing
as Russell...

668
01:03:25,151 --> 01:03:29,053
Stormy Weathers and Lightning Strikes
became the Two Skinny Dudes...

669
01:03:29,155 --> 01:03:31,521
an unsigned band in the contest.

670
01:03:34,794 --> 01:03:38,525
The three of them then took advantage
of the local legend surrounding them...

671
01:03:38,598 --> 01:03:40,862
and disguised themselves as vampires.

672
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,698
They planned to kidnap
all the other bands in the contest.

673
01:03:46,873 --> 01:03:49,774
Then, Two Skinny Dudes
would be declared the winner.

674
01:03:50,443 --> 01:03:53,844
But the crowd wouldn't see the
Two Skinny Dudes close out the festival.

675
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,746
Instead, Wildwind would come on stage
and perform.

676
01:03:56,983 --> 01:04:00,316
They hoped all the attention
from closing the show at Vampire Rock...

677
01:04:00,386 --> 01:04:02,513
would make their careers take off.

678
01:04:02,722 --> 01:04:04,383
I'm starting to get it.

679
01:04:04,824 --> 01:04:08,453
But if they're not vampires,
how did they fly?

680
01:04:10,062 --> 01:04:13,259
Easy, Shaggy.
Their mountain-climbing equipment.

681
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:27,171
They rigged it to the stage so they could
swoop down and kidnap the acts.

682
01:04:29,215 --> 01:04:31,706
This is all very interesting.

683
01:04:32,218 --> 01:04:35,415
But will somebody please tell me
where the Bad Omens are?

684
01:04:35,855 --> 01:04:37,789
That's one answer we don't have.

685
01:04:37,857 --> 01:04:42,419
We sent them and Matt Marvelous
on diving trips to the Great Barrier Reef.

686
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:45,362
All expenses paid. They were thrilled.

687
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:52,202
You should have just asked us.
I've been wanting to leave since I got here.

688
01:04:53,606 --> 01:04:55,335
We didn't really kidnap anybody.

689
01:04:55,408 --> 01:04:58,502
What about the Hex Girls?
They weren't your competition.

690
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,240
But you were.

691
01:05:00,379 --> 01:05:02,313
We knew you would come after them...

692
01:05:02,381 --> 01:05:05,407
giving us the chance
to send you on your way as well.

693
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,145
Where are the Hex Girls now?

694
01:05:07,219 --> 01:05:08,379
Don't worry.

695
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:12,516
We're fine.

696
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:17,053
Thorn, Dusk, Luna! You're all right.

697
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:21,390
Those creepy guys took us back
to their hideout in Vampire Rock.

698
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:25,660
They offered us a free trip if we
would leave the festival, but we refused.

699
01:05:26,272 --> 01:05:29,105
So they took us into the outback
and left us there.

700
01:05:29,408 --> 01:05:31,706
They knew we'd keep looking
until we found you...

701
01:05:31,777 --> 01:05:34,041
making us miss our chance to perform.

702
01:05:34,113 --> 01:05:37,640
And leave Two Skinny Dudes
as the only group left in the contest.

703
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,541
How did you find your way back here?

704
01:05:41,787 --> 01:05:45,348
We wandered around the outback
for hours, until Malcolm found us.

705
01:05:45,825 --> 01:05:49,420
The way they were dressed,
I first thought they were vampires, too.

706
01:05:49,629 --> 01:05:51,859
There are no vampires, Grandfather.

707
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:55,895
Daniel's right, Mr. Illiwara.
Wildwind is definitely human.

708
01:05:56,302 --> 01:06:00,295
They used smoke whenever they flew,
so no one could see their climbing ropes.

709
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,705
You helped us figure that part out, sir.

710
01:06:02,775 --> 01:06:07,337
They burned wood from the red gum tree,
making sweet smoke like your signals.

711
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:11,947
And like, that's why we also found
a boot print made from red gum on stage.

712
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,148
What about the Yowie Yahoo?

713
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,018
We've got an explanation for that, too.

714
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:19,055
I'm sure you do.

715
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:22,458
Wildwind spent a lot of time
perfecting their act.

716
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:24,889
They're masters of special effects.

717
01:06:25,498 --> 01:06:29,161
They used pictures of the Yowie Yahoo
to help pull off their hoax.

718
01:06:29,635 --> 01:06:32,195
They placed the pictures
on holographic disks.

719
01:06:32,271 --> 01:06:34,466
When light was shined through the disks...

720
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,668
three-dimensional images
of the Yowie Yahoo were created.

721
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:42,078
These images could be beamed anywhere
to help Wildwind with their plan.

722
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,543
To make the Yowie Yahoo
even more realistic...

723
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,182
they added fire, wind and explosions.

724
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:52,314
So because he was just a projection...

725
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:56,589
the sunlight reflecting off Scooby's tag,
made the Yowie Yahoo disappear.

726
01:06:56,996 --> 01:06:58,258
Bingo, Shaggy.

727
01:06:58,497 --> 01:07:01,398
Thanks to Scooby,
we were able to solve the mystery.

728
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,665
I'm sorry, Daniel...

729
01:07:09,742 --> 01:07:13,678
for letting my belief in the vampire legend
get in the way of your show.

730
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,513
Wildwind had us all fooled, Grandfather.

731
01:07:16,682 --> 01:07:20,846
And we would have gotten away with it,
too, if it weren't for you meddling kids.

732
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,083
Since all the other bands in the contest
are eliminated...

733
01:07:24,156 --> 01:07:25,919
that makes you guys the winner.

734
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:28,756
Does that mean what I think it means?

735
01:07:33,232 --> 01:07:38,192
And now I'd like to introduce the final act
in this year's Vampire Rock Music Festival.

736
01:07:39,071 --> 01:07:42,472
But first, did everyone have a good time?

737
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,811
I said, did everybody have a good time?

738
01:07:53,452 --> 01:07:55,545
I'm not having a good time.

739
01:07:56,622 --> 01:07:59,022
Come on, Velma, this is going to be fun.

740
01:07:59,859 --> 01:08:04,728
But there's so many people. Besides,
we don't even have a name for our group.

741
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,089
Name?

742
01:08:06,298 --> 01:08:10,735
And now, help me welcome
the Meddling Kids!

743
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:12,403
Meddling Kids?

744
01:08:13,072 --> 01:08:14,300
Works for me!

745
01:12:04,803 --> 01:12:06,828
English
