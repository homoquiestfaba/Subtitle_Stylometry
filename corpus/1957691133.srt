00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:32,014
- Oh, so, that makes
you a fugitive.

184
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,984
And you have kidnapped me.

185
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,691
- (chuckles) Okay, let's not
be overdramatic about it.

186
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,957
I had to get out
of there somehow.

187
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:42,354
- And I'm heading straight back.

188
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,773
See, because I'm a
witness, all right?

189
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,863
So, it's the right thing to do.

190
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:47,898
I'll just, I'll say I was, uh,

191
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:51,704
I was scared and I needed
to leave and, and calm down.

192
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,804
It's very plausible.

193
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,082
- What's in the bag, Jimmy?

194
00:08:56,106 --> 00:08:58,205
- Nothing, it's just a bag.

195
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,679
I have a bag, big deal.

196
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:01,010
I'm just a guy with a bag, wow.

197
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:02,847
I'm not askin'
what's in your bag.

198
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:04,222
- You're holdin' onto it
so tight I'm kinda startin'

199
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:05,850
to think it's a
dialysis machine.

200
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:07,115
- Okay, fine.

201
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:08,887
Fine.

202
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:14,794
My brother's ashes.

203
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,763
I'm take...

204
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:20,799
I was taking them to
the beach to scatter

205
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,636
'cause that's what
he wanted me to do.

206
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:28,939
- I'm sorry.

207
00:09:28,974 --> 00:09:31,106
- Drunk driver, took
out the whole family

208
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:34,109
just like that.
(fingers snapping)

209
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:35,781
I need to do this, okay?

210
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:38,982
'Cause a promise
is, it's a promise.

211
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:43,283
- Then you ditch your truck.

212
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:45,054
You get a rental, a skateboard.

213
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,320
The longest Uber
ride, who cares?

214
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:49,058
And you go to the coast.

215
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:51,060
You'll avoid bad guys.

216
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,073
You'll avoid the cops and you
can do what ya need to do.

217
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:55,031
- Appreciated, okay?

218
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:58,738
But, uh, the truck,
it's my brother's truck.

219
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:01,070
And all I keep thinking is
that if he'd taken that tank

220
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,852
the night of the accident
instead of the sedan,

221
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:05,272
the entire family would
probably still be alive.

222
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:07,373
Besides, it's kinda sentimental
to me now, you know?

223
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,243
And you shot out
the rear window.

224
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,082
- Oh, I did, didn't I?

225
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:14,446
- Mm hm.

226
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,217
- Sorry about that.

227
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:19,187
- I'm a straight
shooter, all right?

228
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:21,695
Guys like me don't
go out and run.

229
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,324
I gotta go back to the
cops, end of story.

230
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,196
- Okay.

231
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,770
Well, um, that's your choice.

232
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:32,365
But I am gonna pay
for that window.

233
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,103
I just need a minute.

234
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:35,808
- You don't need to do that.

235
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:39,779
Oh my God.

236
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:42,243
(pensive music)

237
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:47,413
(engine rumbling)

238
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:58,732
(door closes) (crow cawing)

239
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,767
- I was told 15 minutes tops.

240
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:02,131
The cops have come and gone.

241
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,770
Had to pay them off myself.

242
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:09,105
(Ask sighs)

243
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:12,207
- Do you know who I am?

244
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:14,880
- I know you're late.

245
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,246
- They call me Ask.

246
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:20,182
Do you know why
they call me that?

247
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,350
- No.

248
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:25,253
- Because everybody
in the syndicate knows

249
00:11:25,288 --> 00:11:29,455
if they want anything,
and I do mean anything,

250
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,262
they come to me
first and they ask.

251
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:37,969
- Well, Ask, I'm the boss's
son, so I don't care.

252
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:40,741
(pensive music)

253
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:46,472
- She owes us a nine millimeter.

254
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,045
You can add it to your tab.

255
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:57,252
Being that I'm the top
fixer in this operation

256
00:11:57,287 --> 00:12:00,189
and I say that with
remarkable modesty,

257
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:01,894
I would rather be doing

258
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,194
just about anything
besides babysitting you.

259
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:06,943
- Yo, maybe if your guys
hadn't messed up the hit

260
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,395
you wouldn't have to.

261
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,496
- (chuckles) You think
these are my goons?

262
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:14,808
No, sweetheart, these
are your father's goons.

263
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:20,341
These are the
goons that he hired

264
00:12:20,376 --> 00:12:24,378
to whack 100 pound girl
behind the cash register.

265
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:30,285
It's Ellis, right?
- Yes.

266
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,000
- Well, Ellis, I'm
gonna tell you right now

267
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,289
what you should be
concerning yourself with.

268
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:40,867
Legacy, family dynasty,
your birthright.

269
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:44,299
Except for it's not really
a birthright now, is it?

270
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:46,433
Because you know and I
know that to clear up

271
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:48,270
this little trouble
you've got going on,

272
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:52,241
with, uh, what's her name again?

273
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:54,309
(sword tapping)

274
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:55,310
- Natasha.

275
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:57,048
- Natasha.

276
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,445
To clear up this trouble

277
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,051
that you've got going
on with Natasha,

278
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:01,987
and to do it with
any honor at all,

279
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:04,319
you're gonna have to hunt her
down and kill her yourself.

280
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:07,432
- [Waitress] You
enjoy your meal?

281
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:08,532
- More than I did the company.

282
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:10,127
- Aw, having a bad day?

283
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:11,458
- [Man] Thank you
for your money.

284
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:12,833
- I'm just trying
not to get shot.

285
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:15,627
- Okay.

286
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,904
(TV chattering)

287
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:22,502
- [Woman] So, then I'm
seeing a lot of violence.

288
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:24,108
I can afford it,
I can afford it.

289
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:27,045
(energetic music)

290
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,551
- James Randolph.

291
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:41,928
- I prefer Jimmy.

292
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,161
- I prefer Rudolph.

You're in a sticky
situation, Rudolph.

295

Let's be honest about it.

296
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,335
If you go on the road, you're
an accessory to murder.

297
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,604
If you go back to the cops,
well, you're a snitch.

298
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,639
- Accessory to murder?

299
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,575
You're dropping the
whole self-defense thing?

300
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:06,315
- A nice clean-cut guy like you?

301
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,416
Honey, this ain't your world.

302
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:10,957
I mean, you saw how out of
depth you were back there,

303
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:13,388
how you handled it.

304
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:17,194
Here's how it's gonna
go with you and me.

305
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:18,492
You can't ditch the truck.

306
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:20,197
I get that.

307
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:23,167
But I can offer you
protection on the road.

308
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:26,170
In exchange, you give me a ride.

309
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:27,600
You get to pay your respects,

310
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,602
I catch the slow boat
over the horizon.

311
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:31,505
That's the deal I'm offering.

312
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,408
Take it or leave it.

313
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:37,511
- So, we'd go all the way?

314
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:39,051
All the way to the coast?

315
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,547

- I was raised by a sheriff
in a small town in Utah.

You could say I learned
a few things growin' up.

320
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,528

332
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:48,417
- The Hawaiian Islands.

333
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:50,353
She's gone to Hawaii.

334
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:52,069
- Wait, you think just
because she has a postcard

335
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:53,565
of Hawaii that that's
where she's going?

She's not Jason Bourne.

338
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,296
She's a grifter
from the Midwest.

339
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,166
She probably struggles
to spell her own name.

340
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:02,530
- Okay, so how
does that help us?

341

00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,547
I thought we didn't
have CCTV here?

346

Be incriminating.

347
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:22,517

in case of a
situation like this.

350
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:28,623
- Why is this news to me?

351
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:33,165
- Oh, now you're talkin'
like a mob boss (chuckles).

352
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,563
Ah! Oo, right there.

Whew (chuckles).

(keyboard keys clacking)

358
00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:50,513
Here we go.

359
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,482
Mm hm.

360
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,814
Okay, here we go.

361
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:02,689
(Ask's tongue clicking)

362
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:03,724
Whew.

363
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:08,332
(sighs) Okay.

364
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:13,766
There you go, dark green,
late '90s 'Burb headed west

365
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,504
with a feisty little brat,

366
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,176
and a guy that
looks like he still

367
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:18,716
has to sleep with
the bedroom light on.

368
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,644
Oh, well, pack your
lunch box, kiddo.

369
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,316
This is gonna be a
walk in the park.

370
00:17:25,351 --> 00:17:26,647
We'll send some goods ahead.

371
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,518
(Ask inhales)

372
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,322
(exhales) Animal cracker?

373
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:33,819
(mellow music)

374
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:35,755
- So, Einstein's general
theory of relativity

375
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,757
is based off of classic
physics framework.

376
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,528
But you can't use
that understanding

377
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:41,299
of gravity within
quantum physics.

378
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:42,894
You have to use quantum gravity

379
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,699
in order to encompass the
non-gravitational forces.

380
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:47,547
- Yeah, would you be careful
of that near the interior?

381
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:49,340
- Yeah, I am being careful.

382
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,244
So, that brings us
to string theory.

383
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,839
Well, actually to
superstring theory

384
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,654
which just brings us to
straight M theory anyway,

385
00:17:55,678 --> 00:17:58,382
which gives us the
flat dimensions.

386
00:17:58,417 --> 00:17:59,746
- You're gonna spill it.

387
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:02,353
- Do I look like
a five-year-old?

388
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:03,530
The point that
I'm trying to make

389
00:18:03,554 --> 00:18:05,917
is that space and time coexist

390
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:09,294
and intertwine at the same
time, which means right now,

391
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:10,691
like literally, right now,

392
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:12,594
we could be sharing
the space we're in

393
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:13,705
with dinosaurs who are
alive and roaming the world

394
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:15,927
and we wouldn't even know it.

395
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,500
Oops.

396
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:18,699
- See? Tasha!

397
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:21,669
- (sighs) Please call me Nat.

398
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:23,737
- Fine.

399
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:25,574
Nat, are you on drugs?

400
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:26,905
- Huh?

401
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,346
- Because you are
run hot and cold

402
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:29,424
more than a cheap motel shower.

403
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:31,580
- So, you've noticed?

404
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:33,582
- If you're on
drugs, I'm out, okay?

405
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:34,693
There's a line I will not cross.

406
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:37,586
- No, I'm not on drugs.

407
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,654
I have dissociative
identity disorder.

408
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:44,923
A split personality.

409
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,596
- Oh, so you're schizophrenic?

410
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:50,632
- No, it's different.

411
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,898
My brain is wired with two
different personalities,

412
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,604
each with their own skills,
mannerisms, et cetera,

413
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:57,210
except for shared memories.

414
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:58,574
Minus the short-term stuff.

415
00:18:58,609 --> 00:18:59,949
I mean, that can
get a little sketchy

416
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,578
but it does all come
back eventually.

417
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:04,613
- So, you're Nat?

418
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:06,813
- Yes.

419
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:09,255
- And sometimes you're Tasha?

420
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,290
- Exactly.

421
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:12,885
- How do you even
begin to fix that?

422
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:17,692
- Well, maybe you
don't fix it at all.

423
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,309
Just because somebody
is wired differently

424
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,367
doesn't necessarily
mean they're broken.

425
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:24,633
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to sound insensitive.

426
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:26,734
- Oh, no, don't be.

427
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:28,934
It's a weird thing to
wrap your head around.

428
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,310
It only happens when I
get extremely stressed.

429
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:34,808
- Well, Nat, I'm pleased to know

430
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:36,678
I don't stress you out too much.

431
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,916
So, what are you
gonna do when you get

432
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,292
to the coast and
catch that boat?

433
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:47,788
- I don't know.

434
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:50,659
I guess I'll see where
the universe takes me.

435
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:51,858
What about you?

436
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:53,365
What do you go back to after

437
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,542
you scatter your
brother's ashes?

438
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,500
- Uh...

439
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:57,963
- Oh my God, the car's on fire!

440
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:00,339
- No, it's not on
fire, it's overheating.

441
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:02,671
- How is that any better?
- Oh, I don't know.

442
00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:04,739
(groans) Okay, all right.

443
00:20:04,774 --> 00:20:07,038
I gotta handle this.

444
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,380
- [Natasha] It doesn't like you.

445
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,513
- (sighs) No, it doesn't.

446
00:20:09,548 --> 00:20:11,746
(engine knocking)

447
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:16,014
(hood pops)

448
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:22,295
(doors slamming)

449
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,300
Yeah, it's just great.

450
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:29,698
Just great.

451
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,573
Car chase really pushed
it right over the edge.

452
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,736
My brother had this
truck for 15 years.

453
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:36,771
I've had it for two
weeks and I break it.

454
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:39,873
- I'll get some water.

455
00:20:41,844 --> 00:20:43,613
- No, no, don't waste it.

456
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:46,715
(door slams)

457
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,826
- (chuckles) Helps if you...

458
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,850
Oh!

459
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:53,887
- That was our last
bottle, wasn't it?

460
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:55,691
- Yes.

461
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:57,066
- Because you drank all
the other ones, didn't ya?

462
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,398
- Also, yes.

463
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:01,862
It's fine because we're
in the countryside,

464
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:05,030
so there's, you know,
natural sources everywhere.

465
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,735
- Or we could just find someone

466
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,375
and ask for some help, you know?

467
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,970
- No, no, no.

468
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:12,620
Remember the whole like
being on the run, thing?

469
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:14,677
Because I shot someone?

470
00:21:14,712 --> 00:21:16,382
- You're right, right.

471
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:19,044
Okay, so just make sure
we get enough water

472
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,628
so if it happens again,
we're not screwed.

473
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:21,849
You know what?

474
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:22,850
There's a container in the back.

475
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:24,049
Would you grab it?

476
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:25,754
It's all the way in the back.

477
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,592
(Jimmy sighs)

478
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:29,593
God!

479
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:31,892
(upbeat music)

480
00:21:34,897 --> 00:21:36,369
Yeah, that's it.

481
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:37,931
- Why do you even have this?

482
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:39,867
- It's my pee bottle.

483
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:41,473
- Ugh.

484
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,782
- It's clean. I
didn't ever use this.

485
00:21:42,806 --> 00:21:44,036
It's brand new.

486
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:46,742
- Bet ya tried it on for size.

487
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:47,787
(Natasha gags)
(music continues)

488
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:49,514
Ew!

489
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:50,680
- Maybe I did.

490
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:56,081
It's the perfect size actually.

491
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:58,919
- So, you never really told
me what you did for work.

492
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:02,494
- I'm a forensic accountant.

493
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,564
- Whoa, you never said
anything about forensics.

494
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,170
I don't like getting
involved in that stuff,

495
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,766
and it never really
goes in my favor.

496
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:14,803
What are you, like CIA, FBI?

497
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:16,838
- Family law.

498
00:22:16,873 --> 00:22:20,072
I sit in a small office all day
combing through spreadsheets

499
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:23,878
to assess the assets of couples
in the process of a divorce.

500
00:22:23,913 --> 00:22:26,419
- So, that's what all the
paperwork in your car is for?

501
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:27,893
I mean, like you
care about it enough

502
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,917
to actually take it
on the road with you?

503
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,556
- It's very important
work, all right?

504
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:33,492
I was lucky to get
this time off at all.

505
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:35,791
Anyway, can be interesting
from time to time.

506
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:36,891
Wait a minute.

507
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:38,993
Listen.

508
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:41,566
Water.

509
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:43,898
(soft music)

510
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:48,804
(water splashing)

511
00:22:49,906 --> 00:22:52,742
(Jimmy grunts)

512
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:54,513
- So, what's like,

513
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:57,516
the most important case
you've ever solved?

514
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,419
- There's this
couple in California.

515
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:02,818
They owned a real estate
business together.

516
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:05,491
Millions of dollars was
going into their business.

517
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:09,462
Anyway, she caught him, you
know, bangin' the secretary.

518
00:23:09,497 --> 00:23:11,860
Files for divorce,
yada, yada, yada.

519
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:14,467
Nothing unusual until she
checks the business account

520
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:16,469
and the balance
is less than $100.

521
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:18,537
- Where'd all the money go?

522
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,671
- Well, the husband managed
to open up a business

523
00:23:20,706 --> 00:23:24,136
with the exact same name
but just in Arizona.

524
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,874
- [Natasha] Oh, no.

525
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,810
- Yeah, you know, a few
changes here and there

526
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:30,076
in the paperwork and
she never noticed.

527
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:31,814
And she wouldn't have either

528
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:33,189
if it wasn't for yours
truly combing through

529
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,048
the past 10 years
of public records,

530
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,589
every sale that
man had ever made.

531
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,118
But it doesn't end there.

532
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:41,054
When she confronts him about it,

533
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,693
he's complaining of a migraine

534
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:44,563
so bad he checks
himself in the ER.

535
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:46,224
They think he's just
another you know,

536
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,259
stressed out businessman
dealing with a divorce.

537
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,261
Give him a pain killer,
send him on his way.

538
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,933
Well, while he was out in front

539
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:53,803
of the hospital
waiting for the car,

540
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:57,510
he gets an aneurysm, drops
dead on the sidewalk.

541
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:02,515
- So, you killed
him with paperwork?

542
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,946
That's the best murder ever.

543
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:07,916
- No, no, I didn't kill
him with paperwork.

544
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:08,917
Okay?

545
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:09,984
Karma.

546
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,019
Karma killed that guy.

547
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:11,953
Let's go.

548
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:14,725

00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,008
I can't believe
this is happening.

564
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:41,845
I can't believe it!

565
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,714
Oh, damn.

566
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,781
Come on!

567
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:56,629
I have no idea.

568
00:25:56,664 --> 00:25:58,070
I don't even know what
we're lookin' at here.

569
00:25:58,094 --> 00:25:59,896
I think we're screwed, honestly.

570
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:03,933
(energetic music)

571
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:08,971
- Oo, it's gettin' a little
steamy over here, Rudolph.

572
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:10,170
Don't ya think?

573
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:14,141
- Tasha?

574
00:26:15,848 --> 00:26:17,408
- Oh, I see Nat
got you up to speed

575
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,377
on the whole schizo deal.

576
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,532
You know, it's not as
complicated as she makes it seem.

577
00:26:25,187 --> 00:26:27,891
Ah, you have a Vortec L-31.

578
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:30,993
It'll keep on truckin' but only

579
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:34,062
if you remember to leave the
cooling system after a refill.

580
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:35,701
The thing's just overstressed.

581
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,066
Allow me.

582
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:40,970
(metal clanging)

583
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:48,010
Three years in the Army
Corps of Engineers.

584
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:49,209
No biggie.

585
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:53,081
It's just a quick
hose job, Rudolph.

586
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,085
Plenty more where
that came from.

587
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,791
Ah.

588
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,122
Bueno.

589
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,125
- That's it?
- That's it.

590
00:27:06,932 --> 00:27:10,098
(Jimmy grunts)

591
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:13,365
(Jimmy's throat clears)

592
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:16,138
- Nice work.

593
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,239
- What?

594
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:23,441
(engine rumbling)

595
00:27:25,313 --> 00:27:28,182
(upbeat music)

596
00:27:29,823 --> 00:27:31,119
- You know, I just don't get

597
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:32,725
why we have to
kill her, you know?

598
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,386
Doesn't that seem a
bit strong to you?

599
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:37,059
Couldn't we just punish
her for disobedience?

600
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:38,335
Killing's over the
top, you know it.

601
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,964
- No, no, no, no, no, no,

602
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:43,197
there is an order to
this world, Ellis.

603
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,001
And I don't mean
the outside world.

604
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:48,136
I'm talkin' about our
world, the criminal world.

605
00:27:48,171 --> 00:27:50,138
We have a duty to
maintain that order

606
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:51,975
or the whole thing falls apart.

607
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,955
You went every single grunt
in the syndicate taking

608
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:55,154
a little bit off
your bottom line?

609
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:57,343
- No.
- No, of course not.

610
00:27:57,378 --> 00:27:59,180
It's about sending a message

611
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:01,149
so everybody knows
who's in power.

612
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:03,349
It's about never having
any unfinished business

613
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:06,319
so that everybody knows
whether it's a few cents

614
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:07,760
or it's a stack of papers.

615
00:28:07,795 --> 00:28:09,421
You will stop at nothing,

616
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:12,897
and I do mean nothing, even
if it's your own grandma,

617
00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:15,361
to get your pound of
flesh and restore balance.

618
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:18,232
- Okay, well, maybe
that's not my style.

619
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:21,873
Maybe as a leader, I don't
want to waste my valuable time

620
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,446
on things that I
couldn't care less about.

621
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,173
- Oh, you care.

622
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,043
You care too much.

623
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:29,089
It's written all over that
pretty little face of yours.

624
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:30,981
You just care for
the wrong reasons.

625
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:32,312
You think I can't see that?

626
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,918
I've been doin'
this for 20 years.

627
00:28:33,953 --> 00:28:35,381
- What are you talking about?

628
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,317
- What I'm saying is
that whatever you feel

629
00:28:37,352 --> 00:28:40,122
for this Natasha girl has
gotta take a backseat to honor.

630
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:42,795
- (scoffs) Whatever.

631
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,193
She's nothing special.

632
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:47,833
Do you have any idea
the kind of access

633
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:49,560
to women that a guy
in my position has,

634
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:53,168
and what those women will do
to live my kind of lifestyle?

635
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:55,170
- No, I, uh, I don't.

636
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:57,040
- Yeah, it's ladies'
night at Ellis Island

637
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:58,250
and I'm beatin' 'em
off with a stick.

638
00:28:58,274 --> 00:29:00,142
- You have an island?

639
00:29:00,177 --> 00:29:01,209
Oh.

640
00:29:01,244 --> 00:29:03,046
That's nice, discreet.

641
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:05,444
Then what do you guys do
when you're on that island?

642
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,985
- I don't know, use
your imagination.

643
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,580
- Okay, like Ellis
Island, Ellis Island?

644
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,154
Or is this a club that
we're making an analogy to?

645
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:14,321
Or how, so I know
exactly what you mean.

646
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:16,224
- I'm Ellis, there's an island.

647
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,929
Ellis Island, ladies
getting on it.

648
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,238
- Women there, right.
- That's right.

649
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:20,558
- That's right, okay.
- Boom.

650
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,461
- The, oh, okay.

651
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,243
So, Ellis Island is like,
it's like a joke on your name.

652
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:25,596
Like, you are Ellis and you are

653
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:28,973
an island unto
yourself kinda thing?

654
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:31,371
- Yes, if I had an island, it
would be called Ellis Island.

655
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:32,977
- That already exists.

656
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:34,539
You couldn't probably
name it that.

657
00:29:34,574 --> 00:29:36,244
- What do you mean it already exists?
- Oo.

658
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,312
- I didn't buy an island.

659
00:29:38,347 --> 00:29:39,347
- Okay.
- God.

660
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:42,481
Are these seat
warmers not working?

661
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:45,517
(buttons clicking)

662
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:51,193
(Natasha sighs)

663
00:29:51,228 --> 00:29:52,535
- Half a mile up the
highway in the middle

664
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,229
of nowhere and you
still can't go?

665
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:55,296
- You're not helping.

666
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:01,269
So, you're an accountant, right?

667
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:03,909
- Yeah.

668
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:07,539
- Well, I have some money that
I've acquired over some time

669
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:09,409
and I think it would
be good if I could-

670
00:30:09,444 --> 00:30:11,609
- Make it look like it came
from a legitimate source?

671
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,513
- Yeah, seems like
you'd know how.

672
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:16,988
- Got a little saved up
in your piggy bank there,

673
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,287
mighty might, hm?

674
00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:21,157
- Mighty might?

675
00:30:21,192 --> 00:30:23,929
- Lookin' to start a new
Roth IRA, invest a few funds?

676
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:28,230
How much we talkin' about here?

677
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:31,002
- Like, 650.

678
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:35,006
- Yeah, nobody cares where
you got $650 from, Nat.

679
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,436
- 650 grand.

680
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:39,374
- What?

681
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:42,310
Are you serious?

682
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,379
650...

683
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:47,315
That's over half
a million dollars.

684
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,251
- Wow, you really
are an accountant.

685
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:51,353
- Oh, shit.

686
00:30:53,158 --> 00:30:54,993
No, nope, nope, sorry.

687
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:57,325
I can't get involved
in anything like that.

688
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
I'll lose my job.

689
00:30:58,394 --> 00:30:59,327
Lose my...

690
00:30:59,362 --> 00:31:00,460
I'd go to jail.

691
00:31:00,495 --> 00:31:01,626
I can't go to jail, okay?

692
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:03,364
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

693
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:07,071
- That's okay, I understand.
(urine splashing)

694
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:08,402
- (sighs) All right, you know,

695
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:10,008
I can give you a
few tips, though.

696
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:11,086
You know, I'll help
you out a little.

697
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,637
But just a little.

698
00:31:12,672 --> 00:31:14,672
And if anybody asked,
I didn't help you.

699
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:19,578
What's going on?

700
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:21,349
You trying to start a
flash flood or what?

701
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:22,680
- [Natasha] Chill out, I'm done.

702
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:23,549
Oh!

703
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:25,353
Ouch.

704
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:26,497
- Oh, you know, for someone
who offers protection,

705
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:27,619
you sure are a liability.

706
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:28,994
(Natasha scoffs)

707
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:30,029
You okay?

708
00:31:31,196 --> 00:31:32,129
(Natasha grunts)

709
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:34,065
You gotta go that way.

710
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,429
Yeah, up the bank.

711
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:40,071
- It's this way.
- You got it.

712
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,568
(pensive music)

713
00:31:44,077 --> 00:31:45,505
Bad guys.

714
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,737
Bad guys.

715
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,376
Hurry, come on, get up the bank!

716
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:49,608
Let's go.

717
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:53,381
(engine revving)

718
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,120
(dramatic music)

719
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,693
(men grunting)

720
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:10,332
- [Man] Oh, shit.

721
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:11,367
- [Man] There she is.

722
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:14,105
(men grunting)

723
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,766
(Natasha grunting)

724
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,405
- [Man] Come on, come on.

725
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,373
(all grunting)

726
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:19,408
- Oh!

727
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,414
(elbow thudding)

728
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,090
- [Man] Hold her.

729
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,554
(men grunting)

730
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,097
- How does this work?

731
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:41,561
(men grunting)

732
00:32:48,504 --> 00:32:49,371
- Gotcha!

733
00:32:49,406 --> 00:32:50,406
Don't move.

734
00:32:51,474 --> 00:32:52,407
- Oh, shit!

735
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:53,771
Damn it!

736
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,047
- All right.

737
00:32:55,082 --> 00:32:55,773
Here's what's gonna...

738
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,544
(man grunting)

739
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:59,579
Oh, God. (gun clicks)

740
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:00,614
Oh!

741
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:03,584
- God!

742
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:08,753
(men grunting)

743
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:11,327
(gun cocks)

744
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:14,132
(foot thuds) (man groans)

745
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:17,234
(gun thudding)

746
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:19,434
(all grunting)

747
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:22,140
(gun cocking)

748
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:27,508
(stick thudding)

749
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:37,122
(gun cocking)

750
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:42,457
(grunting continues)
(music continues)

751
00:33:42,492 --> 00:33:43,689
(gun cocks)

752
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:46,560
(energetic music)

753
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:07,515
- Let go!

754
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,648
- Okay.

755
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:09,683
- Whoa!

756
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:11,519
(man thuds)

757
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:14,291
(man grunting)

758
00:34:26,602 --> 00:34:28,800
(gun clicks)

759
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:30,703
- I'm gonna kill you, bitch.

760
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:31,605
- You can try.

761
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,211
(gun clicks)

762
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:34,443
- Damn it.

763
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:36,544
(man grunting)
(music continues)

764
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:37,875
- No.

765
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:54,661
(elbow thudding)
(Natasha grunting)

766
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:58,764
(foot thudding) (man grunting)

767
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:10,248
(fist thudding) (man grunting)

768
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:29,927
No!

769
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:34,536
(flesh squelching)
(man groaning)

770
00:35:34,571 --> 00:35:35,801
- Oh!

771
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:36,934
You got him!

772
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:40,608
(man grunting)

773
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:41,741
- I killed you, bitch.

774
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:47,252
You holding back
on the firepower

775
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:47,978
there to make me sweat, Rudolph?

776
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,617
(shot firing)

777
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:51,234
- Where the hell did you
learn to fight like that?

778
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:52,917
- I trained rigorously
under the tutelage

779
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:55,722
of a samurai master when I was
traveling through East Asia.

780
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:57,955
I can strangle a man to
death with my bare thighs.

781
00:35:59,662 --> 00:36:00,771
- That's a helluva way to go.

782
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:03,631
- Mm. (dramatic music)

783
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,204
Go.
- Okay.

784
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:13,740
- Hey, Tasha.

785
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:14,873
- Hello, baby.

786
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:16,281
- Take the shot, Ellis.

787
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:17,596
I can't be the one that does it.

788
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:21,220
Take the shot, Ellis!

789
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,653
(air hissing)

790
00:36:25,688 --> 00:36:27,523
- I thought you loved me!

791
00:36:27,558 --> 00:36:30,625
(engine rumbling)
(music continues)

792
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,430
(Ellis exhales)

793
00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:36,730
- You idiot!

794
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:40,635
What do you think this
is, a Hallmark movie?

795
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:47,939
- Ow, jeez, my elbow.

796
00:36:47,974 --> 00:36:49,644
Ugh, and my hip.

797
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,580
- Yeah, you got pretty
rowdy back there.

798
00:36:51,615 --> 00:36:53,714
- I didn't do anything.

799
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:57,751
- So, uh, who were they?

800
00:36:57,786 --> 00:36:59,335
Seemed like they were way
more serious this time.

801
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,622
- It was Ellis.

802
00:37:00,657 --> 00:37:02,690
Probably one of his cleaners.

803
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:04,439
Not quite the boss but
as high up the food chain

804
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:05,924
as you're gonna get.

805
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:07,596
- Great.

806
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:10,533
And, um, a relationship
seems to exist?

807
00:37:13,406 --> 00:37:14,702
- You could say that.

808
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,706
I was engaged to Ellis.

809
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:21,775
So, he probably feels a
little jilted right now.

810
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,348
- I can't imagine why.

811
00:37:23,383 --> 00:37:25,383
- Look, it's what I do.

812
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:28,815
I get close to criminals, I
screw 'em over and I move on.

813
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,653
It's my own personal way
of dishing out karma.

814
00:37:31,688 --> 00:37:34,392
You know, in that regard, you
and I aren't so different.

815
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:39,606
- So, were you gonna
go through with it

816
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,750
and actually marry that guy?

817
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,062
I'm sorry.

818
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,372
It's none of my business.

819
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:51,343
- Truth is, I don't know.

820
00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:52,949
I never know what kinda
trouble I'm gonna get into

821
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:55,974
because I turn into
another person, remember?

822
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:57,580
I mean, Tasha doesn't
just fix problems,

823
00:37:57,615 --> 00:37:59,417
she also creates them, too.

824
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,749
Yet, she doesn't have to
deal with the consequences.

825
00:38:01,784 --> 00:38:03,487
I'm the one that gets to wake up

826
00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:05,555
with a tattoo of a
sword on my wrist,

827
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,359
or an engagement
ring on my finger.

828
00:38:09,462 --> 00:38:10,967
- She does seem pretty
unfazed by everything.

829
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:12,595
- Doesn't she just?
- Yeah.

830
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,366
- Yeah, it's fun to be me.

831
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:23,771
- Hey, you know, I think I
saw a medical kit in here.

832
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:24,806
Here.

833
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:28,776
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

834
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:29,843
- It's very kind.

835
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:37,114
And for the record, I have
no feelings for Ellis.

836
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:40,788
- Oh, hey, it's, uh, it's
got nothing to do with me.

837
00:38:40,823 --> 00:38:42,790
- I know, I just want you

838
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:45,958
to know the situation
logistically.

839
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,432
- Logistically?

840
00:38:48,831 --> 00:38:51,403
- Yeah, logistically.

841
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:55,066
- Logistically.

842
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:56,606
Okay.

843
00:38:58,137 --> 00:39:01,413
(soft music)

844
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:04,548
(Jimmy chuckles)

845
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,814
- [Ask] Please tell me
you found some keys.

846
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:08,519
- No, she must've swiped 'em.

847
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,817
We can't take the truck.

848
00:39:09,852 --> 00:39:12,083
(Ask sighs)

849
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:15,889
- I can't believe you had
the shot and you bailed.

850
00:39:15,924 --> 00:39:17,693
- I didn't bail, all right?

851
00:39:17,728 --> 00:39:19,728
I was just checking to
see if she was running

852
00:39:19,763 --> 00:39:21,763
from the situation
or running from me.

853
00:39:21,798 --> 00:39:24,700
- Oh my God, can you
be any more pathetic?

854
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:26,438
She's the worst.

855
00:39:26,473 --> 00:39:28,836
She's literally the worst
choice you can make.

856
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:30,739
You're never gonna
know what she wants

857
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:32,983
because that kinda girl, she
doesn't know what she wants.

858
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:35,843
(scoffs) It's the mystery
combined with the hedonism,

859
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:37,515
that's the allure.

860
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,044
You need somebody more mature,

861
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:41,552
like a woman that makes
you appear smarter

862
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,187
and more confident
than you actually are,

863
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,688
like a doctor or a chemist.

864
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:47,756
- You know what? You
don't even know her.

865
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:50,055
Besides, I'm not into
chicks who wear glasses.

866
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,222
(Ask sighs)

867
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,467
- Your entire future
hinges on this right now,

868
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:57,106
and you are willing to let it
trickle through your fingers.

869
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,229
Why? Have you
thought about that?

870
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,165
Because you found
some tiny little human

871
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,234
and you think she's cool because
she's playing hard to get?

872
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,940
This is where you take
control of your mind.

873
00:40:06,975 --> 00:40:09,877
She is showing you
zero loyalty right now.

874
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:12,011
Your loyalty is
with your family.

875
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:13,782
- Oh, yeah?

876
00:40:13,817 --> 00:40:15,630
Do you know how hard it
is to get over somebody?

877
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:18,248
You probably don't because
you're clearly unlovable.

878
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,888
- Maybe I'm trying
to be unlovable

879
00:40:20,923 --> 00:40:23,528
because maybe this
right here attracts

880
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:24,892
way too much attention,

881
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,993
so I have to weed
out the weak offers.

882
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:29,534
I just let the strong swimmers
through, if you catch my drift.

883
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:32,900
- Wow. That's classy.

884
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:35,705
Look, you don't need
to prove anything to me

885
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,740
and I don't need to
prove anything to you.

886
00:40:37,775 --> 00:40:39,181
- But you know what
you do need to do?

887
00:40:39,205 --> 00:40:41,106
You need to prove
something to yourself.

888
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:43,878
You need to prove that you

889
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:46,144
can get over this
Natasha whatever,

890
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:48,916
move on and do the right thing,

891
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:51,116
which is shoot her in the head.

892
00:40:51,151 --> 00:40:53,756
- Have you seen what
she's capable of?

893
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:55,252
Now imagine that in the bedroom.

894
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,627
You try getting over it.

895
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,123
- She just kicks a lot.

896
00:40:58,158 --> 00:41:00,158
Just get a little blowup
doll or something.

897
00:41:00,193 --> 00:41:01,830
They're much easier
to deal with.

898
00:41:01,865 --> 00:41:02,897
- Just change the tire.

899
00:41:02,932 --> 00:41:04,096
- I don't, I don't...

900
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:05,306
I've stopped listening to you.

901
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,066
- Lefty, Lucy.

902
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:08,936
- I'm sorry, are you
talking to me like that?

903
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:12,577
- Yes, just change
the tire already.

904
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:13,578
Are you kidding me?
- I'm done.

905
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:14,942
Get in the truck.

906
00:41:14,977 --> 00:41:15,877
I will shoot you
right in the balls.

907
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:16,944
I don't care.

908
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:18,913
- Okay, fix the tire.

909
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:20,684
Righty tighty, okay?

910
00:41:24,888 --> 00:41:26,591
- I don't think
your dad will mind

911
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:27,966
if I bring him home a
girl instead of a boy.

912
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,663
(sullen music)
(engine rumbling)

913
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:50,340
- What was his name?

914
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,145
I don't really like
referring to him as the box.

915
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:56,588
- Uh, Bobby.

916
00:41:56,623 --> 00:41:57,985
Well, Robert, but you know,

917
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,186
they used to call
us Bobby and Jimmy.

918
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:03,287
We used to do a lotta
fun stuff together.

919
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:05,630
- (chuckles) Yeah?

920
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:08,028
Like what?

921
00:42:08,063 --> 00:42:10,701
- Well, we got our
pilots license together.

922
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,297
We were actually thinking about
buying a plane at one point.

923
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:15,266
- You can fly?

924
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:16,839
Get out of here.

925
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,007
(Natasha chuckles)

926
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:21,613
- I should do that again.

927
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:28,015
Guess it might bring
me closer to him.

928
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,084
(anticipatory music)

929
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:36,288
Jesus!

930
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,192
What the heck?

931
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:42,161
(upbeat music)

932
00:42:47,707 --> 00:42:52,039
♪ Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

933
00:42:52,074 --> 00:42:55,141
♪ Try something new ♪

934
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:59,112

♪ Will you try something new ♪

937
00:43:09,993 --> 00:43:11,795
- Life's precious,

938
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,359
but playing it safe all
the time isn't living.

939
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:18,230
When you try to hold on too
long, it just passes you by.

940
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:20,771
You've gotta engage.

941
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:24,940
(archers chattering)

942
00:43:24,975 --> 00:43:26,755
- You telling me I should
take up archery or something?

943
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:29,406
- (smirks) No, I want
you to do something else.

944
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:32,376
Strip down.

945
00:43:34,182 --> 00:43:36,347
- Is this a mugging?

946
00:43:36,382 --> 00:43:38,250
- No, silly.

947
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:41,990
I want you to feel
the air on your skin.

948
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:45,796
Now, come out of your cocoon
and take off your shirt.

949
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,833
(gentle music)

950
00:43:49,868 --> 00:43:52,968
- (sighs) All right.

951
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,708
Okay?

952
00:43:56,743 --> 00:43:58,006
- Mm hm.

953
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,041
- Happy?

954
00:43:59,075 --> 00:44:00,437
- Now the other one.

955
00:44:03,013 --> 00:44:04,177
- Look, I, uh-

956
00:44:04,212 --> 00:44:06,784
- Jimmy, you need to do this.

957
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:08,214
(Jimmy sighs)

958
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:09,358
You need to rediscover
that getting wild

959
00:44:09,382 --> 00:44:12,119
from time to time is fun.

960
00:44:12,154 --> 00:44:13,956
That is living.

961
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:15,122
- I know, okay.

962
00:44:15,157 --> 00:44:16,959
I want to be fun.

963
00:44:16,994 --> 00:44:18,400
I want to let loose
to be wild at times.

964
00:44:18,424 --> 00:44:19,863
I just,

965
00:44:21,163 --> 00:44:22,294
I don't know.

966
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:24,065
I just always play it safe.

967
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,001
Maybe I'm scared.

968
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:27,167
- Look, it's easy.

969
00:44:31,371 --> 00:44:32,777
Your turn.

970
00:44:35,012 --> 00:44:36,176
- Look, I...

971
00:44:39,951 --> 00:44:42,479
(Jimmy sighs)

972
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,151
(Natasha chuckles)

973
00:44:44,186 --> 00:44:45,449
Oo.

974
00:44:45,484 --> 00:44:46,857
There we go.

975
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,155
- [Natasha] How does that feel?

976
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,430
- Oh, yeah, yeah, feeling good.

977
00:44:49,455 --> 00:44:50,828
Feeling good.
- All right.

978
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:52,225
Let's try something.
- Good.

979
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,964
- I want you to yell
as loud as you can,

980
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:57,065
"I'm not gonna be
pushed around anymore."

981
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,530
- Mm.

982
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:04,842
I'm not gonna be
pushed around anymore.

983
00:45:04,877 --> 00:45:07,339
- That was pathetic.

984
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:09,407
Louder. Come on.

985
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:11,244
I'm not gonna get
pushed around anymore!

986
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:13,983
(soft music)

987
00:45:16,218 --> 00:45:20,121
- I'm not gonna get
pushed around anymore.

988
00:45:20,156 --> 00:45:21,452
- Oh, that was weak.

989
00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:25,863
- I'm not gonna get
pushed around anymore!

990
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:29,031
- I'm not gonna smile

991
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:30,986
just because people tell
me I need to look happy!

992
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,168
- And I'm not gonna put

993
00:45:34,203 --> 00:45:36,566
my personal checking account
information under $10

994
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:39,041
on my tax returns anymore!

995
00:45:41,177 --> 00:45:42,506
- And I'm not gonna deal

996
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:44,442
with any more of
Tasha's hang overs.

997
00:45:44,477 --> 00:45:47,445
- Yeah, and I'm not stoppin'
for yellow lights anymore.

998
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,480
That's it.

999
00:45:51,253 --> 00:45:53,451
You know what I'm not doin'?

1000
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:55,959
I'm not playin' fantasy
football anymore.

1001
00:45:55,994 --> 00:45:58,093
I'm not goin' on
social media anymore.

1002
00:45:58,128 --> 00:46:00,458
I'm not countin' my
daily steps anymore.

1003
00:46:00,493 --> 00:46:03,230
I'm not gonna go to the gym
two times a day anymore.

1004
00:46:03,265 --> 00:46:05,166
That's it!

1005
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:09,071
- And I'm not gonna deny that
I freaking love Nickelback.

1006
00:46:09,106 --> 00:46:10,303
- That's a great band.

1007
00:46:10,338 --> 00:46:11,304
- Yeah, it is.
- Great band.

1008
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:13,306
And you know what?

1009
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:17,244
I'm not gonna rotate my tires
every six months anymore.

1010
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:19,345
I'm not gonna care what
people think anymore.

1011
00:46:21,547 --> 00:46:23,613
I'm not gonna live inside
a little bubble anymore.

1012
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:25,153
I'm takin' my pants off.

1013
00:46:25,188 --> 00:46:26,319
This feels great.

1014
00:46:28,356 --> 00:46:29,356
Do you see this?

1015
00:46:31,293 --> 00:46:36,098
I'm not gonna take
life's shit anymore!

1016
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:38,364
And if anybody has
any problem with it,

1017
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:41,070
you can just kiss my ass!

1018
00:46:41,105 --> 00:46:42,269
(Natasha chuckles)

1019
00:46:42,304 --> 00:46:43,270
Woo!

1021
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:47,406
- (chuckles) Now,
that is engaging.

1022
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,321
- Yeah, I'm gonna pull
my pants back up now.

1023
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:52,609
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1024

1052
00:47:46,104 --> 00:47:47,114

1073
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:11,550
Nice driving skills, Rudolph.

1074
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:13,321
- Thanks.

1075
00:49:13,356 --> 00:49:14,685
Horseback riding, archery?

1076
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,038
Anything else you
wanna tell me about?

1077
00:49:16,062 --> 00:49:17,754
- Yeah, three years helping

1078
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,602
a Native American tribe fight
against an illegal pipeline.

1079
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:22,264
They called me Ahotamik.

1080
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:23,562
- Ahotamik?

1081
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:25,498
- Yeah, it means
restless beaver.

1082
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:27,038
(Natasha's hand patting)

1083
00:49:27,073 --> 00:49:29,106
- Uh, we really should go.

1084
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:30,536
We gotta get goin', come on.

00:50:01,404 --> 00:50:03,536
- Whoever said romance was dead?

1088
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:05,472
Now, I hate to be the
one to say I told you so

1089
00:50:05,507 --> 00:50:08,541
but I hope this is all the
closure that you're gonna need.

1090
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:18,485
- You know what?

1091
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,421
I don't get it.

1092
00:50:20,456 --> 00:50:22,500
Why do you care so much about
me going through with this?

1093
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:23,721
- Honestly?

1094
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:25,393
- Yes, honestly.

1095
00:50:25,428 --> 00:50:26,636

you're putting on me.

1096
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,231
What comes my dad paying you

1097
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:29,166
some sort of a
bonus or something?

1098
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:30,299
What's the deal?

1099
00:50:30,334 --> 00:50:31,531
- Listen to me right now.

1100
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:34,369
My father mentored your father.

1101
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:36,272
Your dad wasn't always
such a big shot, Ellis.

1102
00:50:36,307 --> 00:50:37,801
He had a little bit of help.

1103
00:50:37,836 --> 00:50:40,507
So, this is it just a
rite of passage for you.

1104
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:43,576
This is the rite of
passage for both of us.

1105
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:48,416
(Ask sighs) (gentle music)

1106
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:49,615
- Really?

1107
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:51,683
- Really.

1108
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,818
- Okay, well, it doesn't matter

1109
00:50:54,853 --> 00:50:56,523
because I'm done with Natasha.

1110
00:50:56,558 --> 00:50:58,129
- Oh.
- She had her chance

1111
00:50:58,164 --> 00:50:59,164
and she blew it.

1112
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,661
We're gonna finish
this for good.

1113
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:04,597
Your dad's gonna
be proud of you.

1114
00:51:04,632 --> 00:51:06,544
- Yeah, well, thank you
for this sentiment, really,

1115
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:07,600
but my dad is dead.

1116
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:11,538
I have a trick up my sleeve.

1117
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:13,474
It's gonna raise our game

1118
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:15,790
and then we're gonna catch up
to that cat piss, Evergreen.

1119
00:51:19,482 --> 00:51:21,680
- I'm sorry I called
you unlovable.

1120
00:51:21,715 --> 00:51:23,385
It was out of order.

1121
00:51:26,258 --> 00:51:27,598
- Thank you so much
for that apology.

1122
00:51:27,622 --> 00:51:30,227
It did hurt my
feelings a little bit.

1123
00:51:30,262 --> 00:51:33,428
- You, uh, you wanna hug it out?

1124
00:51:33,463 --> 00:51:34,792
- No, Ellis.

1125
00:51:34,827 --> 00:51:37,300
I never wanna hug it out.

1126
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:39,566

- What are you doing?

1131
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:56,286
- I'm taking control
is what I'm doin'.

1132
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,289
Last time you were in control,

1133
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,804
you took us right
into the lion's den.

1134
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,227
- I know.

1135
00:52:03,262 --> 00:52:04,492
I'm sorry.

1136
00:52:04,527 --> 00:52:07,660

1137
00:52:07,695 --> 00:52:09,563

(trunk slams)

1139
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,237
- Hey, this might be a bad time,

1140
00:52:13,272 --> 00:52:15,305
and I'm almost too afraid to ask

1141
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,902
but what happened to my butt?

1142
00:52:18,937 --> 00:52:22,312
Feels like I rode a cinder
block down a staircase.

1143
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,940
- Yeah, this is a bad time.

- What is this place?

1147
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,714
- It's a client of mine.

1148
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,463
She caught her husband
cheating at the beach house

1149
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:05,289
when she herself went
there to get frisky

1150

00:53:08,855 --> 00:53:11,295

of the deposition we took.

well, the truth is,

we only got caught in the
first place because of me.

parent who was a security guard.

1414
01:04:58,234 --> 01:04:59,596
- And the Army course?

1415
01:04:59,631 --> 01:05:01,334
- Basic reserve training.

1416
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:03,435
And a summer job in Jiffy Lube.

1417
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,206
And no, we didn't help protect

1418
01:05:05,241 --> 01:05:07,142
Native American
reservations either.

1419
01:05:07,177 --> 01:05:08,572
We rode horses for a summer

1420
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,541
and went through a
major hippie phase.

1421
01:05:10,576 --> 01:05:12,246
- So, you never
traveled through Asia

1422
01:05:12,281 --> 01:05:15,315
and studied with the
legendary samurai warrior?

1423
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:18,186
- Oh, no, that's 100% true.

1424
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:20,421
We can rip a man's heart out
of his chest still beating.

1425
01:05:21,422 --> 01:05:23,389
- Oh, that's good to know.

1426
01:05:23,424 --> 01:05:26,458
- I get why you guys fall for
her sexy femme fatale act.

1427
01:05:27,593 --> 01:05:29,527
- Yeah, look, Natasha said-

1428
01:05:29,562 --> 01:05:32,068
- You're an average guy and
you want to live a normal life,

1429
01:05:32,103 --> 01:05:34,334
so, what is she to you?

1430
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:39,471
- She's chaos.

1431
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:44,113
- She's what you think you want.

1432
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:47,611
And I don't blame people
for being tempted,

1433
01:05:47,646 --> 01:05:51,153
but please don't fall for it
without knowing what it is.

1434
01:05:52,717 --> 01:05:55,487
Tasha's a part of me,
Jimmy, and she's dangerous.

1435
01:05:56,655 --> 01:05:58,226
That makes me dangerous, too.

1436
01:06:00,593 --> 01:06:02,560
- Yeah, I think you got it all-

1437
01:06:02,595 --> 01:06:04,397
(object thuds)

1438
01:06:04,432 --> 01:06:06,696
(anticipatory music)
(engine rumbling)

1439
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:07,664
- What was that?

1440
01:06:07,699 --> 01:06:09,072
- I don't know.

1441
01:06:10,636 --> 01:06:13,010
The truck, it's gone!

1442
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:19,511
No, no (panting)!

1443
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:28,685
- Where's Bobby's ashes?

1444
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,126
- I left them in the truck.

1445
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:34,163
- (sighs) What are we gonna do?

1446
01:06:35,298 --> 01:06:38,398
(plane engine whirring)

1447
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:44,569
- Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

1448
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:48,540
- I fixed that truck, now
I'm gonna get it back.

1449
01:06:49,741 --> 01:06:51,543
Let's do this. (hand patting)

1450
01:06:51,578 --> 01:06:54,348
(upbeat music)

1451
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:13,697
(plane engines whirring)

1452
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:29,482
(Jimmy grunting)

1453
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:30,747
- Oh, yeah.

1454
01:07:30,782 --> 01:07:32,287
Okay.

1455
01:07:32,322 --> 01:07:33,288
Oh.

1456
01:07:33,323 --> 01:07:35,125
Oh, no, no keys.

1457
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,160
There's no keys.

1458
01:07:38,196 --> 01:07:39,261
(keys jingling)

1459
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:41,593
(panting) Unbelievable.

1460
01:07:43,465 --> 01:07:44,662
Here we go.

1461
01:07:44,697 --> 01:07:46,202
Preflight inspection completed.

1462
01:07:46,237 --> 01:07:47,269
Seats adjusted, secured.

1463
01:07:47,304 --> 01:07:48,336
Seat belts fastened.

1464
01:07:48,371 --> 01:07:49,469
Cabin door closed.

1465
01:07:49,504 --> 01:07:50,767
- What are you doing?

1466
01:07:50,802 --> 01:07:52,571
- I can't remember
unless I do it in order.

1467
01:07:52,606 --> 01:07:53,880
- Okay, well, if you could
remember a little faster,

1468
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:55,640
that would be great.

1469
01:07:55,675 --> 01:07:57,455
- Listen, I gotta reach
out to traffic control.

1470
01:07:57,479 --> 01:07:59,545
It's for our own safety.

1471
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,909
Big Bear 2-4-

1472
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:02,284
- This is why the other reindeer

1473
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:03,516
won't fly with you, Rudolph.

1474
01:08:04,783 --> 01:08:06,255
Go.

1475
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:10,622
(engine whirring)
(upbeat music)

1476
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:15,759
(dramatic music)

1477
01:08:26,442 --> 01:08:27,408
- [Jimmy] We're doin' this.

1478
01:08:27,443 --> 01:08:28,574
- [Natasha] Woo!

1479
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:29,872
- [Jimmy] We are doin' this.

1480
01:08:33,548 --> 01:08:35,185
Welcome to Escape Airlines.

1481
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,220
I'm your pilot, Jimmy.

1482
01:08:36,254 --> 01:08:37,550
(Natasha laughs)

1483
01:08:37,585 --> 01:08:39,717
We've got clear
skies all the way.

1484
01:08:39,752 --> 01:08:44,755
(plane engine whirring)
(music continues)

1485
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:03,378
This is pointless.

1486
01:09:03,413 --> 01:09:04,676
We're never gonna find it.

1487
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,946
- Oh, ye of little faith.

1488
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:13,289
There she is.

1489
01:09:13,324 --> 01:09:15,984
Right, I see a weak point.

1490
01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:18,294
- Shouldn't we be
coming up with a plan?

1491
01:09:18,329 --> 01:09:20,725
- That's what
they'll be expecting.

1492
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,464
- So, just more chaos then?

1493
01:09:23,499 --> 01:09:26,632
- (laughs) Oh, you
know me too well.

1494
01:09:28,768 --> 01:09:29,768
- Yeah.

1495
01:09:31,309 --> 01:09:35,905
(plane engine whirring)
(dramatic music)

1496
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:42,549
(engine rumbling)
(anticipatory music)

1497
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:44,947
- [Man On Radio] Hey, Dave,
you comin' over for lunch?

1498
01:09:44,982 --> 01:09:48,588
- Hey, that's what
I've been waitin' for.

1499
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:52,933
(Dave grunts) (dramatic music)

1500
01:09:52,957 --> 01:09:54,495
(Natasha grunting)

1501
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:55,859
- Nice to see you, sweetheart.

1502
01:09:55,894 --> 01:10:00,897
(Dave grunting)
(music intensifies)

1503
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,672
- Is he dead?

1504
01:10:22,459 --> 01:10:24,756
(shot firing)

1505
01:10:27,728 --> 01:10:28,991
Yeah, good shot.

1506
01:10:35,098 --> 01:10:36,471
God!

1507
01:10:36,506 --> 01:10:37,506
Sorry.

1508
01:10:41,874 --> 01:10:43,709
- Ya done?
- Yeah. My shoe lace.

1509
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:44,908
I'm sorry, I nearly tripped.

1510
01:10:44,943 --> 01:10:47,647
(music continues)

1511
01:10:54,656 --> 01:10:56,425
I think they know we're here.

1512
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,723
- Good.

1513
01:10:57,758 --> 01:11:00,594
(music continues)

1514
01:11:08,967 --> 01:11:11,770
(shots firing)

1515
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,850
(door bangs)

1516
01:12:06,959 --> 01:12:08,596
(man grunts)

1517
01:12:08,631 --> 01:12:10,862
(shot firing)

1518
01:12:10,897 --> 01:12:14,899
(music intensifies)

1519
01:12:14,934 --> 01:12:15,934
- Tasha!

1520
01:12:32,952 --> 01:12:34,424
Oh!

1521
01:12:34,459 --> 01:12:35,887
- What the hell are you doing?

1522
01:12:35,922 --> 01:12:38,824
- Is aggression the
only solution for you?

1523
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:40,925
- Yeah.
- You know we hooked up, right?

1524
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,498
- Rudolph, I wouldn't
hook up with you

1525
01:12:42,533 --> 01:12:44,053
if you were the last
man on the planet.

1526
01:12:46,504 --> 01:12:47,504
Unless...

1527
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,836
Did she...

1528
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:52,739
Damn, Nat.

1529
01:12:52,774 --> 01:12:53,872
Get in the car.
- All right.

1530
01:12:53,907 --> 01:12:56,743
(mellow music)

1531
01:12:58,549 --> 01:13:00,208
- Where are the keys?

1532
01:13:00,243 --> 01:13:02,914
(Jimmy whistles)

1533
01:13:04,115 --> 01:13:06,082
(gun thuds) (pensive music)

1534
01:13:06,117 --> 01:13:08,854
(Jimmy panting)

1535
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:14,156
(Jimmy grunting)
(bucket thudding)

1536
01:13:14,191 --> 01:13:15,191
- Nat?

1537
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:16,565
Nat?

1538
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,600
Hey?

1539
01:13:17,634 --> 01:13:19,128
Hey, look at me.

1540
01:13:19,163 --> 01:13:20,470
You okay?

1541
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:22,868
- What happened?

1542
01:13:25,873 --> 01:13:27,004
- They got us.

1543
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:32,647
(rope creaking)

1544
01:13:32,682 --> 01:13:34,748
(Ask speaking faintly)

1545
01:13:34,783 --> 01:13:36,552
- [Ask] In stilettos.

1546
01:13:36,587 --> 01:13:38,125
- What do ya think they're
talkin' about out there?

1547
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:41,887
- They're gathering
witnesses for an execution.

1548
01:13:41,922 --> 01:13:44,791
- Oh (exhales).

1549
01:13:46,696 --> 01:13:49,059
Look, I don't want to
state the obvious here,

1550
01:13:49,094 --> 01:13:50,797
but now would be a
really great time

1551
01:13:50,832 --> 01:13:52,271
if you could do the
whole Wonder Woman thing.

1552
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:54,262
- Look, Jimmy, it's
not like I can just go

1553
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:55,901
into a phone booth
and change, okay?

1554
01:13:55,936 --> 01:13:56,968
- Okay (panting).

1555
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:03,843
(rope creaking)
(music continues)

1556
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:12,280
- Look, there's something
I haven't told you.

1557
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:15,591
It's about how Tasha came to be.

1558
01:14:17,056 --> 01:14:18,253
I was an orphan.

1559
01:14:19,861 --> 01:14:24,831
But in the beginning,
it wasn't just me.

1560
01:14:27,638 --> 01:14:28,802
I had a twin sister.

1561
01:14:30,839 --> 01:14:33,543
And we got passed around a lot.

1562
01:14:34,975 --> 01:14:36,139
We were all each other had.

1563
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:40,583
And then one day,
she was just gone.

1564
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:43,586
They took her from me.

1565
01:14:45,953 --> 01:14:47,755
You know, it's really hard

1566
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:50,956
going through something
like that by yourself.

1567
01:14:50,991 --> 01:14:52,628
You know, I needed someone.

1568
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:58,029
So, I created an
imaginary friend, Tasha.

1569
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:06,774
The kids would tease me
about not having parents.

1570
01:15:06,809 --> 01:15:08,908
Tasha told me everything
was gonna be okay.

1571
01:15:11,044 --> 01:15:13,077
She was always in
my corner, you know?

1572
01:15:14,949 --> 01:15:18,082
And as I got older and the
world got more dangerous,

1573
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,019
Tasha helped me survive.

1574
01:15:24,024 --> 01:15:27,058
She always did the things
that I was too afraid to do.

1575
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:33,900
But with you, I have
been more myself

1576
01:15:33,935 --> 01:15:38,069
these past few days than I have
been in a really long time.

1577
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:43,008
You don't make me feel like
I have to act a certain way,

1578
01:15:43,043 --> 01:15:45,340
or that I have to
choose one side

1579
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,078
of my personality
over the other.

1580
01:15:50,886 --> 01:15:56,021
You just make me feel
wanted as a whole.

1581
01:15:56,056 --> 01:15:58,089
- That's what I've been
tryin' to tell you, Nat.

1582
01:15:58,124 --> 01:16:01,796
I know you got two personalities,
but your one person to me.

1583
01:16:03,228 --> 01:16:06,768
And when I told you
that I fell for you,

1584
01:16:06,803 --> 01:16:09,034
I fell for all of you, okay?

1585
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:10,970
(pensive music)

1586
01:16:11,005 --> 01:16:13,269
Look at, there's no you
and her to me, okay?

1587
01:16:13,304 --> 01:16:15,040
There's just you.

1588
01:16:15,075 --> 01:16:16,712
I love you, Nat, okay?

1589
01:16:16,747 --> 01:16:18,109
Don't you ever doubt that.

1590
01:16:18,144 --> 01:16:20,078
- Execution time.

1591
01:16:20,113 --> 01:16:23,246
Oh, I do love the setting,
dark, moody, ominous,

1592
01:16:23,281 --> 01:16:26,051
this lingering atmosphere
of complete dread.

1593
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:27,723
Mwah! Perfection.

1594
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,157
- You know what?

1595
01:16:33,192 --> 01:16:34,928
I couldn't figure out why it was

1596
01:16:34,963 --> 01:16:36,105
that you went back for
that piece of crap truck,

1597
01:16:36,129 --> 01:16:39,262
so I took a peek inside.

1598
01:16:39,297 --> 01:16:40,967
So sorry for your loss.

1599
01:16:42,168 --> 01:16:46,170
- Oh, I would also like to add

1600
01:16:46,205 --> 01:16:51,714
that I am so happy that this
nightmare is almost over.

1601
01:16:51,749 --> 01:16:53,947
But if anything, the
length that we went through

1602
01:16:53,982 --> 01:16:56,719
to catch this problem
child only added

1603
01:16:56,754 --> 01:16:59,084
to the greatness of
the rite of passage

1604
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:01,922
for our future
heir to the throne.

1605
01:17:05,059 --> 01:17:08,324
- I have a special request.

1606
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:10,766
I want all of you to
put down your weapons.

1607
01:17:10,801 --> 01:17:14,099
I want there to be no doubt
that I did this on my own terms.

1608
01:17:14,134 --> 01:17:16,002
I don't want anybody thinking

1609
01:17:16,037 --> 01:17:20,875
that Ellis Lombardo needs
anybody to do his dirty work.

1610
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:21,910
- Oo, it's a nice touch.

1611
01:17:21,944 --> 01:17:22,944
You heard him, boys.

1612
01:17:22,978 --> 01:17:24,747
Guns on the ground.

1613
01:17:24,782 --> 01:17:27,178
(anticipatory music)

1614
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:42,798
- Hey?

1615
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:43,766
No.

1616
01:17:43,801 --> 01:17:44,965
No!

1617
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,967
(knee thuds) (Jimmy grunts)

1618
01:17:47,002 --> 01:17:48,232
(Natasha gasps)

1619
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:50,773
(Jimmy groaning)
(pensive music)

1620
01:17:50,808 --> 01:17:53,402
- Okay, final chance.

1621
01:17:53,437 --> 01:17:55,206
You say you're sorry,

1622
01:17:55,241 --> 01:17:57,780
we pretend this never
happened and you come with me.

1623
01:17:57,815 --> 01:17:59,210
- Ellis?

1624
01:17:59,245 --> 01:18:00,816
- I'm not going with you.

1625
01:18:00,851 --> 01:18:01,817
- There you go, she
doesn't love you.

1626
01:18:01,852 --> 01:18:03,280
Shoot her.

1627
01:18:03,315 --> 01:18:04,391
- I'm just checking
my options, all right?

1628
01:18:04,415 --> 01:18:07,317
(music continues)

1629
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:16,095
All right, what if
it's between him dying

1630
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:18,460
and you comin' with me?

1631
01:18:18,495 --> 01:18:19,967
- Don't do it, Nat.

1632
01:18:20,002 --> 01:18:21,133
Don't you do it.

1633
01:18:21,168 --> 01:18:22,101
- Okay, okay.

1634
01:18:22,136 --> 01:18:23,432
I'll go with you.

1635
01:18:23,467 --> 01:18:24,939
If you let him go,
I'll go with you.

1636
01:18:24,974 --> 01:18:26,039
It's a deal.

1637
01:18:26,074 --> 01:18:27,172
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1638
01:18:27,207 --> 01:18:28,173
There is no deal.

1639
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,339
There is no deal.

1640
01:18:29,374 --> 01:18:30,439
We have an agreement.

1641
01:18:30,474 --> 01:18:32,111
She's obviously lying to you.

1642
01:18:32,146 --> 01:18:34,344
Raise the gun and shoot her!

1643
01:18:34,379 --> 01:18:36,247
- Why don't you get off my back?

1644
01:18:36,282 --> 01:18:38,953
I don't answer to you, I
don't answer to my father,

1645
01:18:38,988 --> 01:18:40,218
I don't answer to anybody.

1646
01:18:40,253 --> 01:18:42,220
What is your problem?

1647
01:18:42,255 --> 01:18:44,024
- I'm just trying
to be a good mentor.

1648
01:18:44,059 --> 01:18:45,487
- Well, you suck.

1649
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:48,259
(music builds)

1650
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:52,901
- You know what?

1651
01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:54,100
Screw you and your legacy.

1652
01:18:54,135 --> 01:18:55,497
I'm gonna do this myself.

1653
01:18:55,532 --> 01:18:56,806
- Oh, no you don't.

1654
01:18:56,841 --> 01:18:58,137
- You're not gonna use that.

1655
01:18:58,172 --> 01:18:59,248
- Keep your hands
off your weapons

1656
01:18:59,272 --> 01:19:01,008
or she gets it between the eyes.

1657
01:19:01,043 --> 01:19:03,241
- This is what you awakened
inside of yourself?

1658
01:19:03,276 --> 01:19:05,210
A sniveling traitor?

1659
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:07,982
Oh my God, Ellis, it's tragic.

1660
01:19:08,017 --> 01:19:10,853
- Maybe it's my rite of passage.

1661
01:19:10,888 --> 01:19:13,581
- (laughs) I'm so sick of you.

1662
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:17,156
(shots firing)

1663
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:19,928
(men exclaiming)

1664
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:22,392
(shell casings clattering)
(pensive music)

1665
01:19:22,427 --> 01:19:25,230
(Ellis panting)

1666
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,041
- Taking this as an
insurance policy.

1667
01:19:39,312 --> 01:19:40,949
(knife clatters)

1668
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:41,984
Get over here.

1669
01:19:44,581 --> 01:19:45,547
(Jimmy grunting)

1670
01:19:45,582 --> 01:19:46,548
Get stuffed.

1671
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:49,320
(music continues)

1672
01:19:51,423 --> 01:19:54,259
(Jimmy grunts)

1673
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:55,491
Take this.

1674
01:19:55,526 --> 01:19:57,262
Get over here.

1675
01:19:57,297 --> 01:19:58,340
Don't try anything.
- Jesus.

1676
01:19:58,364 --> 01:20:00,133
- Stop it.
- Okay.

1677
01:20:00,168 --> 01:20:01,365
- Get in the car.

1678
01:20:02,434 --> 01:20:03,972
Get in.

1679
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:04,940
- [Natasha] Ow.

1680
01:20:04,975 --> 01:20:06,469
(doors slamming)

1681
01:20:06,504 --> 01:20:08,977
(engine rumbling)

1682
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:11,848
(energetic music)

1683
01:20:16,987 --> 01:20:19,449
(Ask coughing)

1684
01:20:25,622 --> 01:20:28,359
(Ask gasping)

1685
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:33,431
- Hey.

1686
01:20:34,972 --> 01:20:36,433
You, uh, you okay?

1687
01:20:36,468 --> 01:20:39,568
- (laughs) Do I look okay?

1688
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,078
Oh, he shot me (laughs).

1689
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:48,544
(Ask gasping)

1690
01:20:48,579 --> 01:20:53,549
- Hey, look, I think we can
work together here, okay?

1691
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:56,321
You know, my enemy's the
enemy kinda thing, right?

1692
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:58,191
What do ya say?

1693
01:20:58,226 --> 01:21:01,128
- Am I the only one that
stays in my frickin' lane?

1694
01:21:01,163 --> 01:21:03,163
- Yeah, see, I know
where they're goin'.

1695
01:21:04,969 --> 01:21:06,496
- Oh, yeah?
- I do.

1696
01:21:06,531 --> 01:21:07,497
- Where would that be?

1697
01:21:07,532 --> 01:21:08,366
- Vegas, baby.

1698
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:10,005
- Oh, Vegas?

1699
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,941
Wow, that is, of course...

1700
01:21:11,976 --> 01:21:13,470
Vegas.

1701
01:21:13,505 --> 01:21:14,372
- (panting) They're
gonna hitch that wagon.

1702
01:21:14,407 --> 01:21:15,945
He loves her.

1703
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:19,344
- (gasps) Oh, love.

1704
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:20,675
- Yeah.

1705
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:24,349
(dramatic music)
(Jimmy grunts)

1706
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:28,353
(shots firing) (Ask gasps)

1707
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:29,420
Holy shit.

1708
01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:33,358
It worked.

1709
01:21:33,393 --> 01:21:36,625
It worked (panting).

1710
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:39,430
(dramatic music)

1711
01:21:50,377 --> 01:21:53,180
(engine rumbling)

1712
01:22:18,306 --> 01:22:19,470
- You didn't let him go.

1713
01:22:19,505 --> 01:22:20,372
That was the deal.

1714
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:21,571
- Shut up!

1715
01:22:21,606 --> 01:22:23,210
Tasha will be fine with this.

1716
01:22:23,245 --> 01:22:24,750
You're the one that's
messing things up.

1717
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:26,477
Tasha wants to be with me.

1718
01:22:26,512 --> 01:22:28,413
- You were always just
her play toy, Ellis.

1719
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:29,645
- I said shut up!

1720
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,582
(music continues)

1721
01:22:47,533 --> 01:22:48,533
- Ha!

1722
01:23:00,513 --> 01:23:03,217
(tires squealing)

1723
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:08,156
- Get outta the car!

1724
01:23:09,258 --> 01:23:10,290
Get the box.

1725
01:23:13,493 --> 01:23:14,327
- What are we doin' here?

1726
01:23:14,362 --> 01:23:15,295
- Shut up!

1727
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:16,296
- Ellis?

1728
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:17,363
- Hey!
- Shut up!

1729
01:23:17,398 --> 01:23:18,826
- Take your hands off her, man.

1730
01:23:18,861 --> 01:23:20,311
Hey, look, let's just
talk about this, okay?

1731
01:23:20,335 --> 01:23:21,631
- You're not havin' her, bro.

1732
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:22,808
- Come on, man,
what are you doin'?

1733
01:23:22,832 --> 01:23:24,205
Come on!
- Shut up!

1734
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,503
What's goin' on?

1735
01:23:25,538 --> 01:23:27,472
Where's Tasha?
- I don't know.

1736
01:23:27,507 --> 01:23:31,080
She hasn't been around as much
anymore, now that he's here.

1737
01:23:31,115 --> 01:23:32,279
- You killed off Tasha?

1738
01:23:32,314 --> 01:23:34,182
- What are you talkin' about?

1739
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:37,284
- Right, but she's gone,
you're worth nothin' to me.

1740
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:38,450
Get down there.

1741
01:23:38,485 --> 01:23:39,748
- Hey!
- Get back!

1742
01:23:39,783 --> 01:23:41,387
- Okay, all right.
- Just shut up.

1743
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:42,586
Gimme the box.
- No.

1744
01:23:42,621 --> 01:23:43,785
- Gimme the box!
- No.

1745
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:44,753
- Come on, man.
- Gimme it!

1746
01:23:44,788 --> 01:23:45,721
- No.
- Gimme the box!

1747
01:23:45,756 --> 01:23:46,590
- No.
- Give it to me.

1748
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:47,459
- No, don't!

1749
01:23:47,494 --> 01:23:48,856
Stop it!

1750
01:23:48,891 --> 01:23:49,791
Put the box down.
- I'm sorry about it.

1751
01:23:49,826 --> 01:23:50,726
- Put the box down.

1752
01:23:50,761 --> 01:23:52,200
- It's your choice.

1753
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:55,071
Her, or your brother.

1754
01:23:56,338 --> 01:23:57,370
- Come on, man.

1755
01:23:57,405 --> 01:24:00,406
(suspenseful music)

1756
01:24:04,379 --> 01:24:09,712
- (panting) Looks like
you made your choice.

1757
01:24:09,747 --> 01:24:10,812
- [Jimmy and Natasha] No!

1758
01:24:10,847 --> 01:24:11,879
- [Natasha] No, don't.

1759
01:24:11,914 --> 01:24:13,221
- No!

1760
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:14,585
- [Ellis] Get back!

1761
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,323
- I swear to God, I
swear to God, man.

1762
01:24:16,358 --> 01:24:17,885
- Ellis, please, don't-

1763
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,855
- I cannot believe you
chose that loser over me.

1764
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:22,692
(panting) On your knees!

1765
01:24:22,727 --> 01:24:24,529
- Look at me.
- Shut up!

1766
01:24:24,564 --> 01:24:26,531
Get down.
- All right, fine, fine.

1767
01:24:26,566 --> 01:24:29,435
Look, I'm down on
my knees, all right?

1768
01:24:31,538 --> 01:24:33,142
- This what you want?

1769
01:24:33,177 --> 01:24:36,805
(panting) Sucks to be you, bro.

1770
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,345
- Come on, man.

1771
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,907
Don't do that.
Don't-(gun cocks)

1772
01:24:39,942 --> 01:24:42,151
Just, come on, man.

1773
01:24:42,186 --> 01:24:43,416
Come on!

1774
01:24:43,451 --> 01:24:44,813
- You're a dick, Ellis.

1775
01:24:44,848 --> 01:24:46,617
(fist thuds) (Ellis grunts)

1776
01:24:46,652 --> 01:24:49,554
(Ellis yells)
(water splashing)

1777
01:24:49,589 --> 01:24:51,490
Oh!

1778
01:24:51,525 --> 01:24:52,887
Oh my God.

1779
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:54,196
How does she do that?

1780
01:24:54,231 --> 01:24:55,329
- I don't know.

1781
01:24:55,364 --> 01:24:56,561
- I think I broke my hand.

1782
01:24:56,596 --> 01:24:57,892
Oh my God, it really...

1783
01:24:57,927 --> 01:25:01,434
(Jimmy panting)
(Natasha panting)

1784
01:25:01,469 --> 01:25:03,139
I'm sorry.

1785
01:25:05,539 --> 01:25:06,934
- It's okay.

1786
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:09,640
(Jimmy panting)

1787
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,578
- What now?

1788
01:25:13,613 --> 01:25:16,482
(Jimmy panting)

1789
01:25:19,883 --> 01:25:21,718
- We're gonna finish
this, you and me.

1790
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:24,655
That's what we're doin'.

1791
01:25:25,856 --> 01:25:27,592
I'm gonna get you to that boat.

1792
01:25:27,627 --> 01:25:31,662
(sullen music)
(water splashing)

1793
01:25:31,697 --> 01:25:33,334
I'm sorry, brother (panting).

1794
01:25:35,635 --> 01:25:37,173
I tried, man.

1795
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:40,572
I tried.

1796
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:43,311
Let's go.

1797
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:46,182
(music continues)

1798
01:25:50,683 --> 01:25:52,254
(doors slamming)

1799
01:25:52,289 --> 01:25:54,751
(engine rumbling)

1800
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:03,595
(singer vocalizing)

1801
01:27:05,087 --> 01:27:08,022
(waves splashing)

1802
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,731
- I can see why Bobby
picked this place.

1803
01:27:14,734 --> 01:27:16,602
It's beautiful.

1804
01:27:16,637 --> 01:27:19,572
- Yeah, we used to come down
here all the time his kids.

1805
01:27:19,607 --> 01:27:21,838
See those rocks over there?

1806
01:27:21,873 --> 01:27:23,576
The wind comes blowin' through,

1807
01:27:23,611 --> 01:27:25,875
so we would run full
speed side-by-side,

1808
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:28,713
arms back, towel outstretched,

1809
01:27:28,748 --> 01:27:31,551
seeing if we could catch
just enough lift to take off.

1810
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:36,853
So, where is the universe
gonna take you this time?

1811
01:27:36,888 --> 01:27:38,723
- The same place
it always takes me.

1812
01:27:38,758 --> 01:27:41,495
The Molokai Islands in Hawaii.

1813
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:43,563
Locals refer to it
as the Twin Islands.

1814
01:27:47,668 --> 01:27:50,735
- So, was Ellis right,
what he said back there?

1815
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:52,033
You finally killed off Tasha?

1816
01:27:54,103 --> 01:27:57,544
- Honestly, I don't know.

1817
01:27:57,579 --> 01:27:58,754
I have a feeling she's
only going to show up

1818
01:27:58,778 --> 01:28:00,041
if I really need her.

1819
01:28:01,913 --> 01:28:05,816
When she does, that girl is
gonna be wilder than ever.

1820
01:28:07,622 --> 01:28:09,985
(gentle music)

1821
01:28:12,825 --> 01:28:15,925
- I'm gonna clean
that money for you.

1822
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:18,059
You don't have to worry
where it came from.

1823
01:28:18,094 --> 01:28:19,698
- Thanks.

1824
01:28:22,802 --> 01:28:24,967
You know, I'm startin' to think

1825
01:28:25,002 --> 01:28:26,639
that two and half thousand miles

1826
01:28:26,674 --> 01:28:28,608
is a long way to be
on a boat by yourself.

1827
01:28:29,842 --> 01:28:31,611
- Yeah?

1828
01:28:31,646 --> 01:28:33,514
Thinkin' about puttin'
down some roots?

1829
01:28:35,551 --> 01:28:37,749
- Are you ready for a
helluva lotta baggage?

1830
01:28:39,115 --> 01:28:40,653
- Yeah.

1831
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:42,424
I can handle it.

1832
01:28:42,459 --> 01:28:44,492
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1833
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:46,923
(gentle music)

1834
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:04,809
- [Natasha] You did your
brother justice, Jimmy.

1835
01:29:04,844 --> 01:29:06,679
He's in the water now.

1836
01:29:06,714 --> 01:29:09,814
And eventually, he'll
visit every beach there is.

1837
01:29:09,849 --> 01:29:11,552
- [Jimmy] You know what?

1838
01:29:11,587 --> 01:29:12,883
I love the way you think.

1839
01:29:12,918 --> 01:29:17,921
(Natasha laughs)
(waves splashing)

1840
01:29:20,761 --> 01:29:23,399
(pensive music)

1841
01:29:46,985 --> 01:29:49,854
- Over two dozen men,

1842
01:29:49,889 --> 01:29:52,120
multiple vehicles,
countless weapons,

1843
01:29:52,155 --> 01:29:54,958
my top fixer, all lost.

1844
01:29:57,567 --> 01:29:59,160
Give me one good reason

1845
01:29:59,195 --> 01:30:01,195
why you should ever inherit
a single thing from me.

1846
01:30:02,968 --> 01:30:04,539
- Because I found that person

1847
01:30:04,574 --> 01:30:06,068
you wanted me to
find inside myself.

1848
01:30:07,038 --> 01:30:08,873
And I wanna get back out there

1849
01:30:08,908 --> 01:30:13,174
and finish this
once and for all.

1850
01:30:13,209 --> 01:30:16,045
(dramatic suspenseful music)

1851
01:30:24,088 --> 01:30:26,891
