1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,208
I'm on my period.

2
00:00:58,875 --> 00:00:59,916
So?

3
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,166
I love fucking you
on your period.

4
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,250
I do, too. But that's nasty.

5
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:20,083
Keep scrubbing that shit, boy.
I want it clean when I cop it.

6
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,333
Man, you can't afford
this shit, D.

7
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,208
Man, I'm a cop that shit from Frankie
by the end of next summer.

8
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,458
- You gonna see, bruh.
- If you say so.

9
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm gonna be in this next summer
with your bitch!

10
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,375
<i>Hey, I got something for you.</i>

11
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,708
I wanted to give it to you
on your birthday,

12
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,833
but I figured
I'd give it to you early

13
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,208
just so you could try it on
to see if you like it.

14
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,416
Damn, girl.

15
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,541
You shouldn't have.

16
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,000
You like it?

17
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,791
Like it?

18
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,041
I love it.

19
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,666
Okay, D. Stop.

20
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,750
Come on.

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,583
All right, I tried.

22
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,250
Where you going?

23
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,125
Shit, I'm finna go smoke
at Rell's house real quick,

24
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,291
take care of some shit.

25
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,458
You're not going to hit
another lick, are you?

26
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,375
What make you think
some shit like that?

27
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,291
Because you know my mama
don't want that around me no more.

28
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,166
Baby, that's why I'm finna go
look for a job.

29
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,333
I'm not hitting no more licks.

30
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,375
Promise?

31
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,000
I promise.

32
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,791
I'll call you later on tonight.

33
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,541
What you doing out here,
little runt?

34
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,000
- Spying on you guys.
- You better not be doing that.

35
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,583
I'm going to tell your mama
on you, all right?

36
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,750
Where the fuck
you was at earlier, D?

37
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,125
All that slow programming
and shit,

38
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,958
niggas know
we got a schedule to keep.

39
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,125
Well, shit, man. I just went
to go check out Frankie's car.

40
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,083
- What, that Chevy?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,750
Yeah, that shit fly as fuck.

42
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,541
Nigga, stop lying,
you was with the bitch.

43
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,375
Nigga, so?

44
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,041
Yeah, I went to go see her
for a minute afterwards, nigga.

45
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,958
You mad you ain't got a bitch
to go see?

46
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,208
You've been fucking that bitch
for a minute too long now.

47
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,166
- Not even, bruh.
- Yes.

48
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,416
I couldn't even fuck anyway.
She was on her period, bruh.

49
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,041
Yo what!

50
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,833
See you know I love fucking bitches
on their period, man.

51
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,250
Blood, that's what I told the bitch.

52
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,041
You can't get them pregnant
and they're even hornier.

53
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,000
- Hell, yeah.
- I love that shit, man.

54
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,375
You niggas nastier
than a motherfucker.

55
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,041
Hey, man,
fuck all that shit though.

56
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,666
You niggas ready for this shit?

57
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,083
Hey, Barry Bonds!
Nigga, you ready?

58
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,166
- Come on, man.
- You ready for this shit?

59
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,416
Yeah, man. You know I'm ready, bro.
Come on.

60
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:25,166
Then why the fuck you still got
that stupid ass baseball outfit?

61
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,041
I just got out of practice, nigga.

62
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,375
You look stupid as fuck.

63
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,458
You ain't gonna be saying that shit
when you see me in the league.

64
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,166
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah, fuck you.

65
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,416
What?

66
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,208
Man, fuck all that shit, man!

67
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,083
Nigga, just get your foot heavy
for that pedal, nigga.

68
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,000
You sure you want to do this shit?

69
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,333
- Yeah, man. I'm good.
- You hear these niggas?

70
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,125
Sup with you niggas
with that whispering?

71
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,958
You niggas go together
or something?

72
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,458
D.

73
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,791
- Fuck, man.
- What, nigga?

74
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,041
I ain't got
my motherfucking gun, bruh.

75
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,625
Where the fuck your gun at?

76
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,291
Man, I must have left that shit
at Aliky's house or something.

77
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,708
You left it at the bitch house?

78
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,708
I told you, man.
That bitch got you fucked up.

79
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,333
Fuck, man.

80
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,833
Man. Fuck all that, nigga.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,208
Nigga, take this.

82
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,208
- Huh, nigga!
- Is you fucking serious?

83
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,166
Nigga you want a gun or not?

84
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,083
I might as well use my hand
with this dumb ass shit.

85
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,583
Nigga,
a hand don't look like a gun!

86
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,041
Fuck, man. Come on.

87
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,958
- Niggas ready?
- Hell yeah.

88
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,208
Come on, nigga.

89
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,958
All right, come on.

90
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,416
Open the motherfucking register!

91
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,333
- Open this motherfucker!
- Easy, easy man!

92
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,833
- Open this motherfucker!
- Hurry the fuck up, man!

93
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,250
I'll give you anything.
Just don't hurt me!

94
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,000
- Just don't hurt me!
- Ain't nobody up in here, y'all!

95
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,791
- Open this...
- Get down, get down!

96
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,166
Hey, they got a room back here!

97
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,458
Hey, check to see
if he got a safe in the back.

98
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,916
- You got a safe? You got a safe?
- No, I ain't got nothing please!

99
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,833
- I ain't got nothing back there!
- He's lying, man!

100
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,666
Come on. Let's go, nigga.

101
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:00,875
We taking too long, bro.
Come on!

102
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,000
Watch him for me. I'm gonna go
see if he got a safe!

103
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,041
- Come on, bro.
- Watch him for me!

104
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,750
No, no, don't shoot, man.
Don't...

105
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,541
Okay, just...
Just take anything you want.

106
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,666
Hey, there ain't shit back here!
Come on. Come on, man!

107
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,708
He ain't got shit!
Come on, man. Let's go!

108
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,000
- Come on, D!
- Aye, hold up!

109
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,208
Come on!

110
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Oh, shit.

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,666
Where the fuck is D?

112
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,083
- Where the fuck is he at?
- He coming, nigga. Be cool!

113
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,083
You all hear that shit?
What the fuck was that?

114
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,750
Damn it, boy!
Don't make me do this!

115
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,541
What the fuck, man?

116
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,125
What the fuck is you doing?

117
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,791
- Just slide out your gun now!
- I ain't got no gun!

118
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,416
I swear to God, man.
I ain't got shit!

119
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,000
- Where's he at?
- I mean, he was just behind us.

120
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,166
I swear to God he was!

121
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,458
That nigga ain't got
no motherfucking gun!

122
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,833
That nigga still in there, man.
I'm about to get that nigga!

123
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,958
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- I'm about to go get that nigga!

124
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,291
Fuck that shit! Fuck that shit!
I ain't going to jail!

125
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Empty your pockets now,
you little bastard!

126
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,208
Take it out slow now!

127
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,791
This gun cocked and loaded!

128
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,125
- Lil' D.
- Maalik.

129
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,708
You look less swoll
than when you went in.

130
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,125
You look fat.

131
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,833
What? This all muscle, kid.

132
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,541
I'm like the ghetto iron man
out in this motherfucker.

133
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,333
You wish you was eating like me.

134
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,333
- You still eat pork, nigga?
- Yeah, nigga.

135
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,958
Good, 'cause Bertha got something
cooking for your ass.

136
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,750
Let's roll, nigga.

137
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,000
You feel guilty?

138
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,458
- Well, for what?
- You know what, nigga.

139
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,625
What happened with D.

140
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,708
Shit I did for a minute, nigga.
I ain't gonna lie.

141
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,916
But then I slept on it.

142
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,291
And, nigga,
that shit ain't on us.

143
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,583
Nigga, what?

144
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,083
Nigga you feel guilty
or something?

145
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,708
Hell no, nigga.

146
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,958
Nigga knew what the fuck
we was doing.

147
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,333
Shit would have been way different
if I could have got up in that bitch.

148
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,208
Shit's fucked up.

149
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,750
Nigga, what's fucked up
is how you left me on the blade

150
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,416
30 minutes before them niggas
ran up on me.

151
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,541
You see what happened
to my eye, bruh?

152
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,458
That little ass shit, nigga?
Stop tripping.

153
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,708
I'm not your motherfucking
assistant pimp.

154
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,625
Should've had one of your bitches
come and get you.

155
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,416
- Man down, pimp in distress.
- Joking ass nigga.

156
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,666
Just start pimping
Money Mike ass nigga.

157
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,833
Fuck you, nigga.

158
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,000
Man, stop tripping, nigga.
God damn!

159
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,791
Told you, nigga.
I'm gonna handle that shit.

160
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,916
Slide on every single
one of those suckas!

161
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,083
We'll see.

162
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,833
Keep rubbing on that
little ass shit like it hurts.

163
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,541
What the fuck we doing here
anyway?

164
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,916
Nigga, you remember that bitch
from the other day?

165
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,458
Who? The bitch
with the crazy ass daddy?

166
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,541
Yeah, nigga. You know the one.
Nigga, I got this bitch ready.

167
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,291
I just need you to be my brother

168
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,750
and post up out here
until I get back my nigga.

169
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,583
- Post up out here?
- Yeah.

170
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,458
Fuck that, nigga.
I'm coming with you.

171
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,875
Come on, bruh.

172
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,250
You know you're going to scare
the panty's back on that bitch.

173
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,166
You got me fucked up, nigga.

174
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,250
All right, then, nigga. Pay me.

175
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,541
Yeah, nigga, that's right,
pay me.

176
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,833
I ain't no motherfucking
lookout nigga.

177
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,083
Nigga, that's what you want,
huh?

178
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,625
I ain't waiting on you, nigga.

179
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,208
Nigga, D is out.

180
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,583
- He out, nigga.
- Yeah, nigga, I know.

181
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,625
And I'm about to put my boy on.

182
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,791
That's why I'm taking care
of this shit first.

183
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,458
Nigga, you asking me
to pay you and shit.

184
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,958
That ain't got nothing to do
with D getting out.

185
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,708
You're snorting
too much of that cocaine.

186
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,333
It's like a blizzard
up your nose.

187
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,583
No, Nigga. Chill on that, nigga.

188
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,791
She said her daddy drive
a red Cadillac truck, nigga.

189
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,416
So post up outside and holler
if you see him coming.

190
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,875
Yeah, I'm supposed to be the one
up there fucking.

191
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,333
Man, I got you.

192
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,875
Keep your eyes
on that window sill right there.

193
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,291
You might see a titty
or something.

194
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,583
Man, go somewhere
with that shit, nigga.

195
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,791
Just fuck the bitch good.
I wanna hear it.

196
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,541
Man, she on a blue dolphin.

197
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,166
You're gonna hear, nigga.
Trust me.

198
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,250
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

199
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,291
I told you I'd do it.

200
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,000
I feel really, really good.

201
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,000
Is this how
I'm supposed to feel?

202
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,000
This good?

203
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,541
No, I could make you feel
better than that.

204
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,666
Close your eyes.

205
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,458
Egypt is America.
Egypt is Babylon.

206
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,500

"By the way there
by stake they're to be."

208
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,500
Wait a minute.
He said he's going to bring us

209
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,333
back into bondage with ships.

210
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,291
You Negros, Latinos
and American Indians

211
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,958
got here on slave ships. Read.

212
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,000
"Thy shall see it no more
again."

213
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,916
You didn't see it no more again.

00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,583
None of you been back to Israel
as a nation. Read.

215
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,375
"And there you shall be sold
on to your enemies."

216
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,708
Who was sold to their enemies?

217
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,250
You Negros, Latinos
and American Indians. Read.

218
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,583
"For bond men."

219
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,958
For bond men
meaning slave men. Read.

220
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,666

221
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,875
Hey.

222
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,166
What?

223
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:56,958
Your fucking nose is bleeding.
You're bleeding on me.

224
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,750
So? You ain't ever seen
no blood before?

225
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,500
Get the fuck off me, nasty ass.
What the fuck?

226
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,791
Stop it...

227
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,166
"And I will not cause my anger
to fall upon you."

228
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,125
We were taken out of Israel...

229
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,458
You see that nigga's face, babe?

230
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,875
Baby, stop it.
You're being mean.

231
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,000
- And in anger.
- In anger.

232
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,333
And in wrath.

233
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,333
Moses didn't
tell us to get out of that land.

234
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,125
He ruled us out of that land
with anger. Read.

235
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,041
"And in great indignation..."

236
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,833
Please help us!
Please help us!

237
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,833
Bitch ass nigga!

238
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,666
You was talking all that shit!

239
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,500
- What are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up, bitch!

240
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,958
Stop honking that fucking horn
before I shoot you!

241
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,291
Get the fuck out the car!

242
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,666
Who got the fucked up face now,
bitch?

243
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,875
Where the rest at, nigga?
I know you got some more.

244
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,875
Come on, nigga.
Don't touch me like that.

245
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,666
Shut your bitch ass up, nigga!

246
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,083
Yeah, yeah,
I know you had something else.

247
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,541
Faking ass nigga.

248
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,166
Now I would take this car,
but I ain't a dumb nigga.

249
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,208
I ain't dumb. You feel me?

250
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,291
So to show you all
what I think about it...

251
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,708
Here's what I think
about your bitch ass car.

252
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,125
Bitch ass nigga!

253
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,291
So how does it feel
to be back, bro?

254
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,125
Different.

255
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,250
I can finally breathe.

256
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,666
Yeah, nigga.

257
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,000
You almost bled out
and died on us.

258
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,000
Then you held it down
for two years.

259
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,416
I'm proud of you.

260
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,958
Ain't nothing changed.

261
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,583
It's still your hood, you know?

262
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,625
You'll get used to it.

263
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,458
Nigga, I said a red Cadillac.
Her daddy almost killed me.

264
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,166
What the fuck were you thinking?

265
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,666
Nigga, you was doing
what you had to do.

266
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,166
I was doing what I had to do.

267
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,416
- Give me my $30 back.
- You got me fucked up.

268
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,750
How much gate money
they give you when you got out?

269
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,541
Three hundred dollars.

270
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,958
- Niggas only gave you $300?
- Hell, yeah, they did.

271
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,750
Almost two years
working in there, bruh,

272
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,458
and you only made 300?

273
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,208
That's some bullshit, bruh.

274
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,583
That's a prison system,
little nigga.

275
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,375
- You better know about it.
- Hell, yeah.

276
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,416
My nigga Ressy
is in the Marines.

277
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,666
He said they make
all that niggas shit in prison.

278
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,208
That nigga's working
like a slave.

279
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,958
That's what they do, blood.

280
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,000
Ain't none of you all seen Ty
around here?

281
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,166
I told you.

282
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,541
He got cut from the minors
a few months back.

283
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,708
- He don't fuck with us no more.
- Fuck that, nigga.

284
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:35,958
You all know
where he's staying at?

285
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,166
Look, I don't wanna hear
this nigga's name in this house.

286
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,916
- You understand?
- I say whoever name I wanna say.

287
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,000
Just wondering if y'all seen him,
that's all.

288
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,458
I'm just really glad
that my baby's home.

289
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,291
Me too. Me too.

290
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,375
I remember
when my man came home

291
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,375
after three years
from Pelican Bay.

292
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,666
The good girls,
they always stick by their man.

293
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,208
Always.

294
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:10,125
So anyways,
when you all moving to Sac, B?

295
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,416
In about three weeks, baby.

296
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,708
You know I've had
my financial difficulties lately

297
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,458
and my position
at the clinic is ending

298
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,708
and I can't keep this house
anymore.

299
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,875
- Sorry to hear that, B.
- Me too.

300
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,000
So what you doing
with the house?

301
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,375
- What do you mean?
- Are you gonna sell it?

302
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,791
This house?
You thought I own this house?

303
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,250
No, I've been renting this house
for the last 15 years!

304
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,208
I don't own this house!

305
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,375
Y'all thought I owned this?

306
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,208
That ain't funny, B.

307
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,125
Okay.

308
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,958
Okay, I'm sorry, baby.

309
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,625
But what I'm saying is this.

310
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,416
You got about one week

311
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,333
to decide what the hell
you're gonna do with yourselves.

312
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,500
And that decision
is yours to make.

313
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:58,916
Not mine.

314
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,375
You all thought
I owned this house?

315
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,833
He's here.

316
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,208
Shit.

317
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,791
I threw in 20 extra pills
for you.

318
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,208
- Good looking, bruh.
- It's good.

319
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,083
Aye, that nigga D
got out tonight, huh?

320
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,666
Yeah, I just seen him.

321
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,750
Yeah, you know, if you ever need
to make some dough,

322
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,458
you know I fuck with him
on behalf of the streets.

323
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,708
- It's good.
- Fosho that's love.

324
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,666
Yeah, man.
He still fucking with Ty though?

325
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,000
No, man. Ain't nobody fucking
with that nigga, man.

326
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,875
Yeah, when you see D,
let that nigga know, man,

327
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,125
Ty ain't the nigga to be around.

328
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,875
Fuck with that nigga,
he going to have to duck

329
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,041
with that nigga straight up.

330
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,208
Still got racks
on that nigga's head, man.

331
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,500
Man, fuck that nigga, man.

332
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,625
You heard about that shit
in The Bottoms the other day?

333
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,833
Yeah, some nigga from the Rich
got hit up on some stoop.

334
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,500
But niggas don't know
who shot him though.

335
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,833
Yeah, wrong place, wrong time.
That's fucked up.

336
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,166
Yeah.

337
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,875
That's life though.

338
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,291
But, yeah, man, I got bitches
on the deck hit my phone, nigga.

339
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,625
I'm out this thang.
You already know what it is.

340
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:29,875
Aight, G.

341
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,416
Something tells me you don't
plan to step foot on this

342
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,125
or any field like it again.

343
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:11,750
Your whole life
you wanted to preach, right?

344
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,750
I always figured
I'd end up being a preacher.

345
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:18,958
Then you got
what you always wanted.

346
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,208
It's not what I wanted, Ty.

347
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,958
I mean,
I know I'm work in progress.

348
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,166
I realise that more and more
every day.

349
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:32,083
I'll never be satisfied
and neither will the Lord.

350
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,291
And that's the reality, son.

351
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:40,250
My whole life
I wanted to play baseball.

352
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,125
It didn't work out.
That's my reality.

353
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,625
When did you say
you got back here, Ty?

354
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,583
About the middle of August.

355
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,958
Well, shortly before you quit
out there in Nevada...

356
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,666
... my wife had a miscarriage.

357
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,291
This wasn't the first time
either.

358
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,500
See, we've been trying
to have children for years now.

359
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,416
Her belly was bigger than ever.

360
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,416
Ty, I mean,
there's nobody to blame.

361
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,791
Not my dad, not me.

362
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,041
And not God
because he was next on the list.

363
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,166
These things, these tragedies,
these let-downs,

364
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:32,708
they're a part of life.

365
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,833
And they can and they will
only make you stronger.

366
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,166
Yeah.

367
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,375
I guess you're right.

368
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,500
Ten toes down, son.

369
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,416
I'll see you Sunday.

370
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,458
Remember this?

371
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,291
And my nigga, D. Wassup, man?

372
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:59,791
- Whose car is that?
- Okay, that's my shit, man.

373
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You know I had to cop
once my money was right.

374
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:03,625
Like that?

375
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,083
Damn, man.

376
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,333
Frankie finally
came up off that shit, huh?

377
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:08,541
Hell, yeah, man.

378
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,500
He was going through
some money problems, man.

379
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,041
A little family bullshit,
you know.

380
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,041
So he took a couple L's
and I got that whip up off him, man.

381
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,000
She beautiful though, huh?

382
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,041
I'm already treating her
like shit though, man.

383
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,958
I ain't gonna lie, bruh.

384
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,625
That motherfucker is wet though.

385
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,583
Hell, yeah, nigga.
You know, boy.

386
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,708
That's wassup, bruh.
I'm happy for you.

387
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:28,916
It's good, man.

388
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,916
We all gonna be on 26's
before we 26, man.

389
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,416
You gonna get yours next, D.

390
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,375
- I promise that.
- Fosho that.

391
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,083
You need to see
what this pimping is all about.

392
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,500
- This nigga Elvis is guaped up.
- I told him, man.

393
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,583
Both of you need to see wassup
with this pimping.

394
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:44,291
Yeah. Whatever.

395
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,416
If I can't
knock me a bitch today,

396
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,166
nigga, I'm robbing Bings.

397
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,291
You ain't robbing
no damn Bings, bruh.

398
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,250
What, nigga?
All I need is one lick.

399
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,416
Nigga, before a nigga
hit a lick on anything,

400
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:56,916
we smoking first.

401
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,291
Oh, I know you been wanting
to smoke, huh, D?

402
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,958
Shit, yeah. I'm on parole, bruh.

403
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,208
First parole meeting is today.
She gonna be all over a nigga.

404
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:09,625
Come on now, nigga.
You know I got you.

405
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,541
- Tell him about that shit.
- What do you mean, bro?

406
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,916
Nigga,
I brought you my shit, man.

407
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,291
The "Whizzanator".

408
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,000
- What the fuck is that?
- You gonna like this, boy.

409
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,458
Man, I used this shit back
when I got out of Rita, man.

410
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,541
This shit been passed down
through generations, boy.

411
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,125
Just get in the car, nigga.

412
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:47,125
- This shit white, bruh.
- So, nigga?

413
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,208
Ain't nobody really looking
at your dick.

414
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,083
You niggas like that shit, huh?

415
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,916
I ain't gonna lie.

416
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,791
Whoever they modelled that after
had a funny looking ass dick!

417
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:03,000
All right,
so I just strap this thing on?

418
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,416
Shake it
and press the button, right?

419
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,166
It's that easy, D.

420
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,083
Aye, aye,
stop at this store right here.

421
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:10,250
We got to get a swisher.

422
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,125
Nigga,
I thought you already had one!

423
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,458
Hell no. It's good.

424
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,166
We got to stop at Big John's
anyway.

425
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,875
Big John?

426
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,750
Yeah, that nigga been wanting
to yo holla at you, too.

427
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,500
Him and Cory.

428
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:47,000
Hey, bruh,
where can I dump these guts at?

429
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:50,125
Put that shit on the table, bruh.
It's all good.

430
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,541
You seen some crazy shit
in the pen, huh?

431
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,500
Got you acting funny already.

432
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,000
Nigga, he just got out,
Big John!

433
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,583
Shut up, nigga!

434
00:30:58,416 --> 00:30:59,375
D, it's good, bruh.

435
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,750
When you're trying
to get some real money,

436
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,458
come holla at us.

437
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,083
What's up with you though,
nigga?

438
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,583
How the game been treating you?

439
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,916
Shit, you see
how I'm living, my nigga.

440
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,541
Just trying to get my niggas
here on the same hype.

441
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,250
That pimping money cool,
don't get me wrong.

442
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,541
But when you put one of these
in a nigga's face,

443
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,208
it ain't nothing
he won't give up.

444
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,041
What are you all about to go hit
anyway?

445
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,500
This little Asian spot
in the Rich.

446
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,375
A happy ending joint,
you feel me?

447
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,000
We still need a driver, too.

448
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,958
I don't trust this nigga,
Cory, behind the wheel.

449
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:32,250
Uncle John,
why do you always rob Asians?

450
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,750
What? Simone!
Get the fuck out of here!

451
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,583
What you doing in here anyway?

452
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:38,125
I ain't gonna lie,

453
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,791
them Asians
been busting back lately.

454
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:42,541
Not on me! Not on us!

455
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,166
Simone, go get some ice cream
or something.

456
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,208
You ain't supposed
to be in here.

457
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,583
Kids all innocent and shit, man.

458
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,125
Let me hit that, bruh.

459
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,416
What you think
about this pimp shit, D?

460
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:59,375
Sound good. Shit.

461
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:02,125
Niggas locked up
say it's hella drama though.

462
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,625
Nigga drama?

463
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,541
Nigga, that's if you don't know
how to pimp.

464
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,791
You can't tote a mac
if you ain't a mack, nigga.

465
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,833
- On mamas, nigga!
- Believe that.

466
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,208
The only drama I had with this
pimp shit happened last week.

467
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:13,583
What happened last week?

468
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,583
He's a pimp,
that's what happened.

469
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:18,500
No, nigga.

470
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:22,125
My older partner Uncle Chuck
turned me onto this pimp shit.

471
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,208
So I leave my bitch
in the room with him for a night

472
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,791
to see if she can handle
some real pimping, you dig?

473
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,041
You know,
see if she's game tight

474
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,416
or a loose bitch fucking
for food and shelter and shit, man.

475
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,625
The nigga fucked her,
but he ain't break her.

476
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:37,166
He said she ain't let him hit
that third hole neither.

477
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,791
So what happened last week then?

478
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,833
Nigga, I took that booty
virginity from her.

479
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,208
Hit them cheeks.

480
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:44,625
What was the drama then, bruh?

481
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,000
Nigga, you ever fucked your girl
in the ass for the first time?

482
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,583
- Man.
- Nigga, that's drama!

483
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:05,125
Let's see.
Staying out of trouble.

484
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,000
Staying out of trouble.

485
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:12,083
That's good.
Now where did I put those?

486
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,750
I know, there you go.
Got you right here.

487
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,791
- Hun, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

488
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:29,458
You tried to rob a liquor store
with a hand held mirror, huh?

489
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:32,875
Yeah.

490
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,000
You're lucky no one was hurt.

491
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,625
Actually, I got shot...

492
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:38,708
... twice.

493
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,500
I'm not talking about
self-inflicted wounds here.

494
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:45,166
It would have been a tragedy
if someone innocent was hurt.

495
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:47,125
You feel me?

496
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,666
You know you are too damn young
to go to prison for two years.

497
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:52,625
You know that, right?

498
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:54,458
Yes.

499
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,375
But that's what's cool now days,
getting shot, going to prison.

500
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,041
Here's a list
of potential employers

501
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,958
who hire convicted felons.

502
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,166
And in your case, parolees.

503
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:12,041
So, what's your number one priority
now that you're a free young man?

504
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:19,916
Not going back.

505
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,250
I'm not going back to prison.

506
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,166
That's good.

507
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:31,125
So have you consumed any drugs
or alcohol since your release?

508
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,333
No.

509
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,083
Good, follow me.

510
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,791
Come on, nigga!

511

00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,166
Nigga, that's on you, bruh.
Don't take that shit out on me!

520
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,833

00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,708

527
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,958
Whatever, bruh.
Clown ass nigga man.

528
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,333
What's happening?

529
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,666
- I got the money.
- Money?

530
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,916
Throw it on the ground.
I'm going to pick it up.

531
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,625
Aye, meet me around the corner.

532
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,250
That nigga gave me $300.

533
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:35,833
Look at this bum ass bitch.

534
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:37,958
Look at your bum ass bitch.

535
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:40,458
Don't even look at me, bitch.
I ain't even the one.

536
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,000
For real, bitch!

537
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,416
- Big bro, what's happening?

538
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,875
Shit, let me get something

539
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:57,250
He want 20 pills.
What you do last night?

540
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,916
Shit, you know,

541
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,333
Hell, yeah,
I'm going to see you later.

542
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:02,666
All right, bruh.

543
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,166
What's up, my nigga Reez?

544
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,375
What's up, my nigga Reez?
You good?

545
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:12,833

546
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,750
Hell, yeah, boy.

547
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,083
You already know.

548
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,291
I'm going to go bust this move.
I'ma see you in a minute.

549
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,000
Grandmomma?

550
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:52,750
Grandmomma!

551
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,958
- Grandmomma!
- Jerell?

552
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,791
- Baby, is that you?
- What happened, Grandma?

553
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:03,958
Why you ain't call me?

554
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,541
I couldn't reach the phone.

555
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:21,625
I fell out my chair.

556
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,250
I must have gone to sleep.

557
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:29,250
Thank Lord Jesus Christ
I got you, baby.

558
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:00,833
I'm going to call Para transit
in the morning, Grandmomma.

559
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,833
Tell them
to get some more Metformin.

560
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,750
You only got two doses left.

561
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:07,083
Where'd you get
all that money from?

562
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:10,041
Don't worry about where
this come from, Grandmomma.

563
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,375
Let me know if you need anything and
I'll go get it for you, all right?

564
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,125
I got to go, Grandmomma.

565
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,000
You need something
from the store?

566
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,208
You be good, baby.

567
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:32,875
You be good, all right?

568
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,625
Tell B to hit me up, okay?

569
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,250
- All right.
- All right.

570
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,333
Hey, you ever thought
about leaving?

571
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:04,250
You know,
when Bertha goes to Sac.

572
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,166
What? Out the hood?

573
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:11,833
Yeah, I guess.

574
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,375
Shit, I don't know where I'd go.

575
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:22,916
Hey, you better go look
for a job today.

576
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,416
I'ma see you in a minute.

577
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,666
Nigga, I know that ain't Lil' D.

578
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,458
Man, what's up with niggas?

579
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:36,916
What's going on, Cam?

580
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:39,666
You know ain't shit changed
and the number's still the same.

581
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,791
But fuck all that though, man.
Bounce in my nigga!

582
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,750
Come on, nigga.
We got shit to do.

583
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:46,625
This nigga had his first parole
meeting yesterday.

584
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:47,875
Parole meeting?

585
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,875
You think me or him
give a fuck about all that, man?

586
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:53,750
This shit concerns us, man.
It will only be a minute though.

587
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:58,458
What? Niggas touched down
and don't fuck with me no more, man?

588
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,875
You all making this harder
than bumping a bitch, man!

589
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,541
I said come on, man!

590
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:08,583
All right, bruh.

591
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,958
What the fuck you all eating
anyway, man?

592
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:13,541
Eating jail house sandwiches?
Nigga's free, man.

593
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,500
Little fucking D! My nigga!

594
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,250
I know you've heard
about all the mobbing me

595
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,916
and your brother was doing
while you was locked up, nigga.

596
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,583
- You're in a real good position.
- Come on, nigga.

597
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,583
- I told you he just got out.
- It's all good, Maalik.

598
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,875
We're just talking.

599
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:35,000
So what's going on, bro?
Where we going?

600
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:36,708
Oh, you'll find out soon enough.

601
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,208
I just wanted to holla
at you niggas

602
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:39,708
about this nigga Ty real quick.

603
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,583
What about him?

604
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:44,541
That nigga's fucking done.
It's on site with this nigga, man.

605
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,041
What's the number one rule?

606
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,041
Never get high
on your own supply, right?

607
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,625
The only reason why this bitch
ass nigga didn't break that rule

608
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:53,708
is because he was higher
than a kite on my dollar though.

609
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:55,791
Man, that don't even sound
like Ty.

610
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,625
What? Niggas change, boy.
Fuck that!

611
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,416
And you've been gone
two years, man.

612
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:03,791
A lot of shit done changed
in two years.

613
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,291
That nigga started getting
that fast money

614
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,791
and didn't know how to act.

615
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,291
One minute, boom,
I ain't gonna lie.

616
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,666
Nigga moving faster
than anyone on the team.

617
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,875
Then bam!
This nigga started taking

618
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,916
most of the pills
he supposed to be selling!

619
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,916
Damn near knock status.
Now can you believe that?

620
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,625
Is that adding up, nigga?

621
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,541
See, you hear me talking
but you ain't listening, nigga.

622
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:25,750
How much money he owe you all?

623
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,458
Nigga, enough to put
a new set of 32-inch rims

624
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:30,666
on this motherfucker

625
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,208
and throw a QP of purple
in the glove compartment, man.

626
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:37,000
Well, shit. I ain't seen him.

627
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,958
Nigga, we seen him.

628
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:41,916
I just want you to be there
when the shit pops off.

629
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:43,666
You know that shit unforgivable,
right?

630
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,333
You do the crime,
you do the time.

631
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:47,375
Ain't no way in hell
I would've left you on stuck

632
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,916
in the middle of a lick, nigga.

633
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,875
That's that sucka shit!
Straight up!

634
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:55,708
I just got out, bruh.

635
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,625
I got a lot of other shit
on my mind.

636
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,791
Yeah, some pussy, right?

637
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,291
You know whose Ty's
number one customer was

638
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,458
when he was moving for us,
right?

639
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:08,916
- Come on, bruh.
- Maalik ain't tell you, nigga?

640
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:11,791
Nigga Alakeeyee, Alikai.

641
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,916
However the fuck you say it.
Nigga, your bitch!

642
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:17,083
Yeah, he was doping her up
real good.

643
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:19,791
Got your bitch
strung the fuck out!

644
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,125
Come on, bruh.
What you trying to do?

645
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,666
What you saying, nigga?

646
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:25,541
Nigga, I'm saying
she eight-pills-a-day easy.

647
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,583
All that money
going to that nigga Ty's hands.

648
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:28,791
Not your books.

649
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,500
Did that nigga write you, bro?
That nigga write you a letter?

650
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:32,833
Put something on your books,
nigga?

651
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:35,708
Did Aliky write you?
They ain't do shit, nigga.

652
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:38,833
Got played out, man.
Maalik here will tell you, man.

653
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,166
Is it true, Maalik?

654
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,458
Maalik!

655
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:48,708
I mean...
I don't know.

656
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:55,166
The whole time, huh?

657
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:57,666
See, that's why I came
to holla at you, bruh.

658
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:59,541
I don't know why these niggas
leading you on.

659
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,083
But don't trip though.

660
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:03,541
You know I don't play
them little kids ass games.

661
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,208
See, earlier in the day,

662
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:13,708
one of my <i>amigo </i>partners
said he saw this nigga Ty

663
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:16,041
go into these apartments
last night.

664
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,041
Nigga, this is where
his sister stays at.

665
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,000
Now you see that hammer
under the seat?

666
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:27,208
Yeah, I see it.

667
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:32,750
Well, as a favour from me to you,
because we all want answers,

668
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,625
we're gonna get
a lot of shit handled.

669
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,625
Right now.

670
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:39,250
Bitch, I just had to ride
a motherfucking bike

671
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,458
from 96th and Bancroft

672
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:41,875
all the way to North Richmond
last night

673
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,916
because my granny needed
her motherfucking medication

674
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,833
and you're trying to tell me
you can't go outside tonight

675
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:48,083
because you got a broken heel.
Is you crazy?

676
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,666
Get the fuck out of here!
Get off of me!

677
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,041
Ty's not here!

678
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:19,958

723
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,833
Hey.

724
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,166
You need to leave.

725
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,083
Why?

726
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,166
Cuz AJ's getting back soon,
that's why.

727
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:50,875
Man, fuck AJ!
I ain't seen you in two years.

728
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,041
I know.

729
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:57,125
But he has.

730
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:07,166
Wait. I got something for you.

731
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,708
Stay right there.

732
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,958
You left this at my mama house
the last time I saw you.

733
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,666
Your mama had another kid?

734
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:46,541
No. She's mine.

735
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:51,833
Don't worry, she ain't yours.

736
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:55,375
- She look just like me.
- Well, I said she ain't yours!

737
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,916
AJ want me to give her up.

738
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,291
Look, if you need some help,
just come and see me.

739
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,750
I'm back for good now.

740
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:07,875
It's a little too late
for that, D.

741
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,041
I know people that can help you.

742
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,666
- What, like Ty?
- Naw.

743
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,333
Why the fuck you mentioning him?

744
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:16,541
He came over here the other day,
asking about you.

745
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,000
The only reason
that nigga getting better

746
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:21,791
is cuz people trying
to kill him.

747
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:25,541
But you probably
already know that, huh?

748
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:29,583
He the one
who got you like this?

749
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:33,916
I know he used to play ball
with AJ and shit, too.

750
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,666
Is that who you all
been coping from?

751
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,708
He got you on this shit?

752
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:40,375
Ty?

753
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:44,000
Ain't nobody cop
from that knock ass nigga.

754
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,958
He was only selling for a month
before he got hooked.

755
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:48,291
What you mean?

756
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,458
The last time I saw Ty

757
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,791
before he came over here
asking about you,

758
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:54,458
he was begging me for money.

759
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,625
AJ take care of me. That's it.

760
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,708
I thought you wanted better
for yourself?

761
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:09,208
I wanted a lot of things.

762
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:20,166
Look, you really need to go.

763
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:24,083
AJ getting back soon
and he ain't right, right now.

764
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:26,750
Can I see you again?

765
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:28,916
No.

766
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,833
No you can't, D.

767
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,958
Why you got to be
like this then?

768
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:35,166
Please.

769
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:38,750

771
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,416

772
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,208
So what we looking for

773
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:57,500
We looking for the freshest whip

774
00:53:57,708 --> 00:53:59,500
Bro, if they got a nice whip,

775
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:01,708
more than likely,
they got a nice house.

776
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:04,541
Hell, yeah, that makes sense.

777
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,458
- That look like the one.
- Yeah, we see you.

778
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:10,916

How the fuck you know that?

If you want it to be your baby,

00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,416
Don't want it to be your kid,

You don't need

00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,666
Besides, you know

Elvis and that...

850
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:44,958
Oh, this Lil' D.
You can call him D though.

851
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,291
No, I'm gonna call this nigga
Lil' Pimp.

852
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:48,666
How that sound?

853
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:51,250
That's fine with me.

854
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:54,208
- Nice to meet you, bruh.
- Yeah, you too, pimp.

855
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,416
Hey, man, my client
just finishing up, man.

856
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,833
Why don't you niggas meet me
back of the old rail road.

857
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:00,416
Yeah, that's cool, that's cool.

858
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:02,208
- All right, T.
- Come on, D.

859
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:11,625
Come on, man.
Hurry this shit up.

860
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,291
You too, bitch, get the molasses
out of your ass.

861
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:19,625
- All right, Unc, man.
- Any time, Leroy. Any time, man.

862
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:22,625
Come on, shit, time is money.

863
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:30,958
Now break yourself, bitch.
All right, go get my money.

864
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:38,708
So Elvis here tells me
you want to get in the game?

865
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:41,791
- Yeah, he does pimpin'.
- Yeah, that's right.

866
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,500
Yeah, nigga, I know how it is.
I just did six years in Avenal.

867
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,166
And it took a pimp a minute
to get back on his feet, too.

868
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:50,375
But, nigga, you lucky.

869
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:52,291
You see, you young.

870
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,625
But these hoes out here
is young and dumb.

871
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:57,250
You hear that, boy?
Now that's pimping.

872
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:58,750
Your nigga, Rell?

873
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:02,583
That nigga is a gorilla,
and he ugly!

874
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:04,500
See, you can be
an ugly gorilla pimp,

875
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,916
but you better be rich first,
you dig?

876
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:09,291
Nigga, you only got one whip?

877
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,208
No, D, man, you know you can use
my whip, man.

878
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:15,000
You know, get a date or two,
pull a few tricks.

879
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:17,708
Good, good.
So, nigga, what you need to do,

880
01:01:17,916 --> 01:01:20,208
you need to get down there
to 85th and International.

881
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:22,208
She's set up down there
with my bottom bitch.

882
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,458
Scoop her up, take her around.

883
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:26,583
You know, show her what
this pimping is all about. You dig?

884
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:29,041
Elvis ran this shit
down to you, right?

885
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:32,541
- Yeah, I been at a game though.
- Good.

886
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:35,333
So nigga the next time I see you
you should be pimpin'.

887
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:37,416
Now you gonna go
by the name of Lil' Pimp.

888
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:39,250
I know that shit
sound fake as fuck.

889
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:40,666
But guess what, nigga?

890
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:43,916
You gonna be the only nigga
out here officially called that.

891
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:47,416
I'm gonna post out here
with Uncle Chuck.

892
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,875
What are you waiting for, man?
Handle that.

893
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,791
Wassup with this nigga, man?

894
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,208
I told you, man.
My nigga just got out.

895
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:01,166
So what this girl look like
you hooking him up with though?

896
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:03,291
- Man, the bitch is five-star.
- Is she?

897
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,333
- So how old is you?
- Old enough, you know.

898
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,791
I said how old are you?

899
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,666
Old enough ain't an age.

900
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:31,041
I'm 14 about to turn 15.

901
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,041
Everybody think I'm older
anyway.

902
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:38,541
Look,
this view real nice and all,

903
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:41,000
but what we doing up here?

904
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:43,250
What you want to do?

905
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,000
I'd fuck,

906
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:50,333
but people come up here,
you know?

907
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,500
Yeah, right.

908
01:02:58,083 --> 01:03:01,041
So, are we gonna make this money
or what?

909
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,791
Yeah, let's go do that.

910
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:25,083
Now, ma'am,
if you don't come pick her up,

911
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:27,250
she will be placed
in a group home.

912
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:32,375
Oh, okay, sorry to disturb you.

913
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,375
So what's going to happen
with her?

914
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,875
Well, I just got off the phone
with her grandmother

915
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:08,958
and she wanted nothing
to do with it, nothing.

916
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:11,916
So she will be placed
in a group home,

917
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:13,875
and they'll take it from there.

918
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:21,500
D, you did the right thing.

919
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,625
You know that, don't you?

920
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:27,250
I guess.

921
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:30,625
Well, it's gonna be marked

922
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:33,000
on your progress report
for next quarter.

923
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:34,875
So that's huge.

924
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:37,916
It's gonna help you get through
this parole a lot faster.

925
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:42,958
Come on now, it's getting late.

926
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:45,333
Why don't you go see if you can
get a few more of these.

927
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:48,708
I got to sort this out.

928
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:51,958
Bye, D.

929
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,958
Come on now, fix your face.

930
01:04:58,166 --> 01:04:59,833
We're gonna find somewhere
for you.

931
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:21,916
<i>We're sorry, but your call
will now be disconnected.</i>

932
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:24,333
<i>2-1-5-4...</i>

933
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:27,625
Man, this nigga, D, fucked me.

934
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,500
After everything I did for him,
he played me like a sucker.

935
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:33,291
Got my whip towed
and everything.

936
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,416
You believe that, baby?

937
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:40,833
Man, is this motherfucking trick
coming over here or what?

938
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:43,083
Yeah, he said
it would be like 50 minutes.

939
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:45,625
50 minutes?
Bitch, is you stupid?

940
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:47,625
- Look at you!
- What?

941
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:49,875
You don't look fucking ready
to me, bitch!

942
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,791
Put your motherfucking face on!

943
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,875
You know what? Fuck you!

944
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,791
Hurry the fuck up, too!

945
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:06,416
What's good, my nigga?
You all right?

946
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:08,125
Yeah, everything cool.

947
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:11,166
You driving that, bro?
Where Candy at?

948
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:13,708
Shit at the house,
watching music videos,

949
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:15,833
fucking with her cousins
and shit.

950
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:17,791
Lazy ass bitches, man.

951
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:20,708
But I don't know what happened
the other night, man.

952
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:24,458
I swear, man. That bitch would not
shut the fuck up, man.

953
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,208
What, you believe me, don't you?

954
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:33,250
You did what you had to do.
You feel me?

955
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:34,958
You're fucking right I did.

956
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:36,333
I'll put two holes
in any motherfucker

957
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,291
that say something different.

958
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,958
I'm gonna kill this nigga, Ty.

959
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,666
Something telling me
this nigga in town, man.

960
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:44,083
I wish his ass was there.

961
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,875
I would've laid his bitch ass
right next to his sister.

962
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:49,708
If a nigga got to go,
a nigga got to go, period!

963
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:51,250
Thank you!

964
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,250
Well, it's good.
I'm a holla at niggas though.

965
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:41,708
Nigga, do you know
how late it is?

966
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:49,041
Sorry.

967
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:53,208
For everything.

968
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,500
I never should've hit that lick
with you all that day.

969
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:10,208
Everything happened so fast
and I got spooked.

970
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,333
I fucked up.

971
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:19,666
I think about that shit
every day.

972
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,583
Nigga, I did my time.

973
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:30,541
And the ones that stuck with me,
they stuck with me.

974
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah?

975
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:36,625
Are they with you right now?

976
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:02,458
You know, I never was really mad
you drove off on me that day?

977
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:07,083
At the time, yeah.

978
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:13,375
I wasn't going to make it up
out of that store.

979
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:18,958
Not before that old man
had a chance to kill me.

980
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:28,625
If I would have had this...

981
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,916
... I don't think
I'd be standing here.

982
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,708
For some reason, bruh...

983
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:03,791
... I thought shit would be different
when I came home.

984
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:11,250
I feel like
I ain't ever even left.

985
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,833
There's something real fucked up
about that, bruh.

986
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:39,083
Look, bruh.

987
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,958
You got to get you
the fuck up out of here.

988
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:49,375
But you can't go anywhere
without any damn money, man.

989
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,208
What the fuck you mean?

990
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,333
I got no one.

991
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,500
No family, no nothing.

992
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:05,125
I know, but you got me.

993
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:11,125
I got a plan.

994
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:04,625
- D, you woke?
- Yeah, I'm just getting changed.

995
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:06,875
Well, I got some moving boxes
out here.

996
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,916
All right, B.

997
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,666
You know what to do with them,
right?

998
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:12,791
Yeah, put shit in them.

999
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:16,541
I'm taking most of your stuff
with me.

1000
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,583
You know I paid
for most of that shit anyway.

1001
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,458
I'll be gone until tomorrow.

1002
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:22,291
Okay, sounds good.

1003
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:24,750
All right, baby.

1004
01:16:48,166 --> 01:16:49,708
Where this bitch ass nigga at?

1005
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:53,875
So you're sure
you wanna go about it this way?

1006
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,041
What the fuck you think?

1007
01:16:56,708 --> 01:16:58,750
Nigga, you all checked
his pockets, right?

1008
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,000
- Right?
- Yeah.

1009
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:03,375
And what he have? Shit!

1010
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:05,583
So what I look like
if I let a nigga rob me

1011
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:07,625
walk the streets
with a heartbeat?

1012
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:09,583
Nigga, this is how the game go.

1013
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,333
I'm tired of your ass
questioning every fucking move, man.

1014
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:15,416
Put yourself in my shoes
and man the fuck up!

1015
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:17,666
I can't pull the trigger out
on this one.

1016
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:20,250
Suck ass nigga.

1017
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,416
I thought
we was in on this together.

1018
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:23,625
If it's me pulling the trigger,

1019
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:25,375
then it's just me
doing the dirty work,

1020
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:27,166
with two spectators.

1021
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:30,208
Man, I'll do it.

1022
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,125
What?

1023
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:36,625
Okay, Maalik really did
put you on, huh?

1024
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,458
You ever kill somebody before,
nigga?

1025
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:41,208
I mean, I shot a nigga once.

1026
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:42,875
Hit him,
when he was running though.

1027
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:44,666
He just didn't fall.

1028
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:48,125
All right, so you got a gun?

1029
01:17:48,916 --> 01:17:52,125
No...
but I could use yours though.

1030
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:02,250
Grab them gloves.

1031
01:18:05,916 --> 01:18:09,000
See that towel?
That's where my banga at.

1032
01:18:11,916 --> 01:18:14,125
Be careful, it's loaded.

1033
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:18,416
All right, let's do it.

1034
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,625
My nigga, D,
slid through in the clutch!

1035
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:52,750
You said you had big cheese
on a nigga's head.

1036
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:54,791
This bitch ass nigga
owe four racks,

1037
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,125
so that's what it pay.

1038
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:57,875
Blood money.

1039
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:02,000
I got ten right here.

1040
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:03,291
But that ain't for you.

1041
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,541
I'll pay D
when I see him in the traffic.

1042
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,291
Maybe if you would have been
the triggerman,

1043
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,916
I'd break your ass off.

1044
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:11,250
Young boy's cut now.

1045
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:15,541
That's respectable.
I'll get the horn then.

1046
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,375
Yeah, do something.

1047
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:23,208
- You ready, nigga?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

1048
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:47,875
Just watch out for the ricochet.

1049
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:52,041
Ricochet, huh?

1050
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:04,416
Y'all never said
you was gonna kill him.

1051
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:08,500
Thought it was just a lick.

1052
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,250
It was.

1053
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:13,375
More like a murder.

1054
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:16,000
Shit became too personal.

1055
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:20,166
You heard about that boy
who got killed in The Bottoms

1056
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:21,625
the other week?

1057
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:23,791
It was on the news for a minute.

1058
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,166
Yeah.

1059
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:27,541
Cuz everybody knows
Cam was gunning for you

1060
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,041
when he killed him.

1061
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:33,166
Nigga, don't act like news
don't get around out here.

1062
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:40,458
But that was Cam's
biggest mistake though.

1063
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:42,916
Missing you.

1064
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,041
One bullet.

1065
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:51,125
Because you know
who that boy was, right?

1066
01:21:52,916 --> 01:21:54,000
Mitchy.

1067
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:59,625
<i>I used to cop from him before
I started selling for Cam.</i>

1068
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:05,875
Yeah, he was from The Rich,
barely came out this way.

1069
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:10,875
You know who got family
in The Rich, right?

1070
01:22:20,958 --> 01:22:22,083
<i>It's Lil' Santi.</i>

1071
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25,583
Shit, I'm at the house
playing a game, man.

1072
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:28,875
Wassup with that shit, man?
What?

1073
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:31,791
<i>I been told my cousin Gina
to tell you, man.</i>

1074
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:33,750
When I saw you at Maxwell's.

1075
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:36,041
But fuck all that shit, man.
Wassup? What you doing later?

1076
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,541
Come fuck with a nigga.

1077
01:24:11,166 --> 01:24:12,791
<i>Who got the fucked up face now,
bitch?</i>

1078
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:43,375
Now what?

1079
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,375
Now we wait.

1080
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:55,166
Why did you do this for me, D?

1081
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,000
After everybody else
went bad on me.

1082
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:02,333
Why you?

1083
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:07,416
Cam set you up for failure, bruh.

1084
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:11,208
Shit, everybody knew that.

1085
01:25:15,541 --> 01:25:16,750
Me not helping you,

1086
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:18,541
after everything
you been through?

1087
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,458
That would have been
too easy for me.

1088
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:30,000
You deserved
a second chance, bruh.

1089
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:36,958
You got that money
for Maalik, right?

1090
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:39,000
Yeah, I've got it.

1091
01:25:40,916 --> 01:25:43,375
That should help you out
wherever you end up.

1092
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:48,250
Help with your sister's services
and shit,

1093
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:49,666
and whatever else.

1094
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:53,666
Get low, bruh.

1095
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,125
You're sure
this the house, right?

1096
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:07,041
Yeah.

1097
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:10,000
I stayed there for a minute
when I got back.

1098
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:24,416
Wait right here.
Turn the car on though.

1099
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:26,416
All right.

1100
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:52,791
I want you
to make good decisions.

1101
01:26:56,583 --> 01:26:58,041
I know you will.

1102
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,750
<i>Who is it?</i>

1103
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:14,333
<i>Hello. Is anyone there?</i>

1104
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:18,541
Here's something special.
She was extra special.

1105
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:35,958
You remember me?

1106
01:30:10,416 --> 01:30:12,583
Well, I guess
I'll take this thing down.

1107
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,708
You sure you wanna keep
renting this house out?

1108
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,000
Yeah, I do, B.

1109
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:19,625
All right then,
that's your decision.

1110
01:30:19,833 --> 01:30:21,916
We're running late, so I need
to get up to Sacramento.

1111
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,458
- We got to sign this lease.
- All right, Mama.

1112
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:28,250
Now you be good to Candy,
you hear?

1113
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:29,583
And tell Little D to call me

1114
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:31,500
and let me know
how his interview went.

1115
01:30:31,708 --> 01:30:33,041
All right, you know I will.

1116
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:36,333
- All right. I love you, baby.
- All right.

1117
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:41,041
So what brings you by here?

1118
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,833
I seen the sign you had
in the window.

1119
01:30:45,916 --> 01:30:48,708
I decided to come in
and apply for the job.

1120
01:30:48,916 --> 01:30:50,416
Really now?

1121
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:53,083
Now why in the hell
would I want to hire you?

1122
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:56,791
I grew up around here.

1123
01:30:57,708 --> 01:31:00,666
I was raised around stores
like these my whole life.

1124
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:03,958
You know how to work
the cash register?

1125
01:31:04,166 --> 01:31:06,500
No, but I can learn.

1126
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:09,125
So you're telling me
you're a fast learner or something?

1127
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:10,333
Yeah.

1128
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:12,583
Well, why didn't you
just say that before?

1129
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:16,041
Look, I can learn
how to operate the register.

1130
01:31:18,208 --> 01:31:19,916
I can take instructions,
you know?

1131
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:24,208
Whatever it takes
to make the store run,

1132
01:31:24,416 --> 01:31:26,208
I can do that
and make that happen.

1133
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:31,416
Boy, making a lot of money

1134
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:33,916
is just not that important
to me anymore.

1135
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:36,875
But what really is important,

1136
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:39,958
is getting somebody here
I can trust.

1137
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:43,500
And I got to tell you,
I'm going to be frank with you.

1138
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,500
I don't like you very much

1139
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:49,250
and I sure as hell
don't trust you.

1140
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:52,208
But you know what?

1141
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:55,666
I might just be willing
to give you a shot, young blood.

1142
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:58,791
Because somebody did it for me,

1143
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,125
a long time ago
when I was about your age.

1144
01:32:03,666 --> 01:32:06,916
And that somebody was my father.

1145
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:11,125
You now beginning to understand
what we're talking about, boy?

1146
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,625
Yes, sir.

1147
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:14,083
<i>Good.</i>

1148
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:17,750
Now do you have an ID on you?

1149
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,166
Oh, yeah.

1150
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:26,708
Okay, this looks in order.

1151
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:30,666
I'm gonna have to go next door
and make a copy.

1152
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:34,625
Meanwhile, why don't you start
filling out some of these forms.

1153
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:38,875
So maybe I can pay you someday.

1154
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:43,625
Where are my keys?

1155
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:49,583
Oh, and I believe
this belongs to you.

1156
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:52,416
I'll be right back.
