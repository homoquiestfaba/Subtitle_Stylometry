Someone at the A.A. Anyone there
might wanna hurt you for some reason ?

653
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:10,091
Harry, we're alcoholics.

654
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:12,463
We're generally satisfied
just to hurt ourselves.

655
00:54:12,534 --> 00:54:15,230
Yeah.

656
00:54:21,442 --> 00:54:25,879
Anyone could have her,
and I don't know if she's scared
or if she's sick or if she's hurt.

657
00:54:25,947 --> 00:54:28,177
I don't know
if she's hungry or cold.

658
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:30,217
- I know, honey. I know.
- I don't even--

659
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:33,880
Excuse me. Is this always
in the baby's crib ?

660
00:54:33,955 --> 00:54:36,423
No, that's not my Bible.

661
00:54:36,491 --> 00:54:38,652
Oh, Lord.

662
00:54:38,726 --> 00:54:41,092
Lord, I know who took her.
I know who took Americus.

663
00:54:41,162 --> 00:54:42,686
What ?

664
00:54:42,764 --> 00:54:45,392
Yesterday,

665
00:54:45,466 --> 00:54:47,661
this woman came to the door.

666
00:54:47,735 --> 00:54:51,193
<i>She was here once before.</i>
<i>She had a man with her,</i>

667
00:54:51,272 --> 00:54:55,003
and they said that they wanted
to give you the Word of God.

668
00:54:57,312 --> 00:54:59,246
I smart-mouthed 'em,

669
00:54:59,314 --> 00:55:01,441
and they had Bibles with 'em,

670
00:55:01,516 --> 00:55:03,450

671
00:55:03,518 --> 00:55:05,418

<i>Midnight, Mississippi.</i>

673
00:55:10,692 --> 00:55:13,422
They said my baby
was an abomination ?

674
00:55:17,031 --> 00:55:19,693
Am I bein' punished, Forney ?

675
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:21,132
For what ?

676
00:55:21,202 --> 00:55:23,193
Things I did.

677
00:55:24,873 --> 00:55:27,364
I wasn't married
when I had my baby.

678
00:55:29,344 --> 00:55:31,778
Do you really think
this is what you deserve ?

685
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:09,842
- Oh, my God !
- You can't--
- Let her go !

686

A highway patrol had spotted
a Mississippi plate and stopped 'em.
