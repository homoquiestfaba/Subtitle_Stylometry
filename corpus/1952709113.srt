1
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:30,023
We're federal agents, we are not martyrs!

2
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:33,528
This is suicide!

3
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,197
She is just one of many abductions.

4
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:39,742
Why is this abduction so special!

5
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,788
Is it because she's 
a witness againstTorrez?

6
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:50,249
He probably has her locked up,
drugged out of her mind.

7
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,214
We do not have to do this!

8
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:53,967
If not us...

9
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:56,470
...then Who?

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,599
I told you to stay still!

11
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:03,266
Do not try to capture Torrez!

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,605
Turn around now!

13
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:08,190
Machete, you son of a bitch!

14
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:10,525
Listen to orders!

15
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:15,402
You'll eventually kill us all!
Wait for reinforcements!

16
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,769
Whatever happens...

17
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,316
I'm with you...

18
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:49,486
... Boss.

19
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:53,489
This is the BOSS...

20
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:16,056
Sorry.

21
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:08,696
Get dressed.

22
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:12,814
It's too hot for clothes.

23
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,350
Careful!

24
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:32,908
You saving me from Torrez?

25
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,723
You've got balls!

26
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:37,766
That looks like me.

27
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,109
What's this long hard thing?

28
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:47,445
My Machete.

29
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:48,488
Is it sharp?

30
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:50,198
Very...

31
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:51,825
Good...

32
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:11,889
I got him

33
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:16,310
Stupid FUCK...

34
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:21,353
I told you to stay away asshole.

35
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,110
If you had listened to my orders
you would not have been caught.

36
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:29,407
How did I do?

37
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:32,201
Excellent my love.

38
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,745
Excellent...

39
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,126
This is what happens when they insist
on being heroes.

40
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:45,048
Why are you so insistent?

41
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:48,844
I own the entire force...
And not just here in Mexico.

42
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:52,806
I own the DEA... I own
the Marshals...

43
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,893
Why can't I own you?

44
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,562
Why don't you take the money
I offered you to look the other way?

45
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:00,483
What's your price?

46
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:05,278
Maybe I should ask your
wife.

47
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,822
Bring her in here.

48
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:12,746
No!

49
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,832
Sara!

50
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:20,919
Your daughter... she's in
school right now.

51
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:22,339
No?

52
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,301
I don't think so.

53
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,433
The honorable way to die...
is to cut off your head.

54
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,732
But.

55
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:42,359
You don't deserve to die honorably.

56
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:45,907
Burn it!

57
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:42,071
Joining us right now we have Franklin Jones.

58
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:45,908
Deputy Director of our local Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) office.

59
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:46,995
Thank you and pleasure to be here.

60
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:49,538
What steps are you taking to
secure our borders?

61
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,541
ICE is working with local law enforcement
to improve patrols...

62
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:55,919
but there's over 2000 miles of border between
Mexico and the U.S.

63
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,755
And over half of that is here in Texas,

64
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:00,380
So we need to attack the problem at it's source.

65
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:02,844
There's a whole support network.

66
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:04,805
That not only helps illegal aliens get

67
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:07,932
across but is helping them get settled.
Once they are here.

68
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:10,019
We need to uncover and dismantle this
network.

69
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:14,146
It's our top priority and our most
talented ICE agents are investigating them now.

70
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:20,361
Agent Nevada: Day 23 of surveillance for
Operation Network.

71
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,492
The Operation is suspected to be run by
a woman named Loose.

72
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:27,496
Codename: She.

73
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:29,748
Tacos Cafe! TACOS!

74
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:32,835
Loose operates out of a taco truck
at the labour site.

75
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:38,341
There's a interesting...

76
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:39,009
face.

77
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:45,976
No! That's ok.

78
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:47,685
Thank you.

79
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,441
He's new.

80
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:01,866
Run through database for
possible criminal background.

81
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:04,744
Male, Hispanic, scars, tattoos

82
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:08,749
Don't fuck with me, I won't
fuck with you attitude.

83
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:12,087
Hey!

84
00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:15,713
You work today
and pay me tomorrow.

85
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:19,928
Hi, lady

86
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:21,804
You need a gardener?

87
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,132
Here.  Get out.

88
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:48,167
Hurry up!

89
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,754
We're not there yet.
You can't just leave us here!

90
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:53,799
Move!

91
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,300
She is sick.

92
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,397
Roundup time!

93
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,444
Look at them!

94
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,923
Speak english?

95
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,055
Well, I don't speak much Mexican neither.

96
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:42,726
You know...

97
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:44,727
You're trespassing...

98
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:47,231
on my daddy's land.

99
00:10:58,035 --> 00:11:00,035
Jesus Von! Can't you see
she's with child?

100
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,083
If it's born here,
it gets to be a citizen.

101
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:07,836
No different than you and me.

102
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:11,089
I know most people don't like us.

103
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:14,968
Call us...Vigilantes.

104
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,181
But it's really about vigilance.

105
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,185
Somebody’s gotta keep watch
on this great nation of ours.

106
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:26,940
Otherwise...

107
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:29,526
Texas will become...

108
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:32,595
Mexico once again.

109
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:37,117
Who's gonna stop it senator?

110
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:39,620
I am.

111
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:46,342
Welcome to America.

112
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:50,632
You catch all that?

113
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,498
Burn me a DVD.
Behind, all our supporters
are going to like that...a lot!

114
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,391
<i>[ ANNOUNCER ON VIDEO ]:
The infestation has begun...</i>

115
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:01,185
<i>parasites have crossed our borders...</i>

116
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,812
<i>and are sickening our country...</i>

117
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,480
<i>leeching off our system...</i>

118
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:06,815
<i>destroying us from the inside.</i>

119
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,818
<i>But State Senator John McLauglin</i>

120
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,320
<i>has a plan of attack.</i>

121
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:13,460
<i>He'll fight to keep illegal immigrants
OUT!</i>

122
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,924
<i>He supports an electrified
border fence.</i>

123
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,443
<i>No amnesty for parasites!</i>

124
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,793
<i>John McLaughlin wants to protect you
from the invaders!</i>

125
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,477
<i>Vote to re-elect
State Senator John McLaughlin!</i>

126
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,241
<i>Paid for by the Committee to
Re-elect State Senator
John McLaughlin.</i>

127
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:48,653
Hey!

128
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:50,197
Hey, Ugly!

129
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:51,239
Want to fight?

130
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:57,244
Don't tell me you don't wanna earn
$500 in five minutes.

131
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,459
That's my man!

132
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:04,711
Bet's! Place your bets!

133
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,431
Fight!

134
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:00,605
Thanks.

135
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:18,415
Can I get a couple of bean and cheese,
and a Café Olé.

136
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:21,643
We got no café Olé.

137
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:22,964
Regular coffee then

138
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,973
Oh! hold the spit please.

139
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:39,646
Why do you pretend to come here
just for coffee?

140
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:41,942
I'm not pretending.

141
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:43,610
I like my coffee cheap and greasy.

142
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,404
I can refuse service to anyone.

143
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:48,866
It's the American way.

144
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:50,576
Yeah, when they're citizens.

145
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:52,996
Got your papers?

146
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,124
Same as the last time you checked.

147
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,208
And the time before that.

148
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:00,379
And the time before that!

149
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:02,798
Got yours?

150
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,049
Same as the last time you checked.

151
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:07,802
You think what you do is right?

152
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:09,554
Taking your brothers and sisters in?

153
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:13,099
Deporting them back to their own
personal hell?

154
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:14,519
It's the law.

155
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,811
There are many laws.

156
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:17,438
There sure are...

157
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:19,565
immigration fraud...

158
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,734
aiding in illegal entry,

159
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,550
unsanitary food prep...

160
00:15:24,553 --> 00:15:26,030
but you wouldn't know anything about that,
would you?

161
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:27,574
Can I get my tacos?

162
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:33,998
Who's she?

163
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,917
I hear she runs an underground network.

164
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:38,878
How the hell would I know?

165
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:41,005
I just make tacos and I sell them.

166
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,049
to the workers of this world.

167
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:46,310
It fills their bellies with something
other than hate.

168
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:48,096
Funny.

169
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:50,098
Sounds like something SHE would say.

170
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:53,394
Catch you later.

171
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:59,233
In the race for State Senator...

172
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:00,484
Latest polls are showing...

173
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:03,778
a sharp decline in support for incumbent
John McLaughlin,

174
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:05,823
and his hard-line position on immigration.

175
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,134
Get in.

176
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,658
$70. a day for yard work,

177
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:28,957
$100. for roofing,

178
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,309
$125. for sceptic...

179
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:33,395
Sewage.

180
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:35,189
You ever killed anyone before?

181
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:17,902
You know this guy?

182
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,324
Senator John McLaughlin...

183
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,577
Independent from Cocksucker County.

184
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:30,872
Built his reputation on being
a hardliner against wetbacks.

185
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,084
Gets worse.

186
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:37,670
Yes... If he has his 'druthers,
he'd send you back to 'Old Mehico'.

187
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:39,465
That's his platform.

188
00:17:39,802 --> 00:17:43,969
Ship 'em all back, but first make 'em
build a wall along the border
for no pay.

189
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,167
'Thank you very much,
get the fuck out.'

190
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:49,095
But what the Senator fails to understand is...

191
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:50,477
this state runs on illegal labor.

192
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,518
Thrives on it,

193
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:54,148
keeps costs down,

194
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,205
keeps the wheels turning.

195
00:17:56,403 --> 00:17:58,570
We bust that up
and we're fucked.

196
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,488
My words.

197
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:04,201
Now I'm guessing you don't
have papers.

198
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:05,870
As you well know...

199
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:07,330
illegal immigrants like yourself...

200
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:10,081
are being forced out of the
country in alarming numbers

201
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:14,336
So for the sake of both
our peoples...

202
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:18,592
the senator must die.

203
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:34,106
And for that. I will give you
150 thousand dollars cash.

204
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:47,999
Get someone else.

205
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:51,794
No time.

206
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,671
This job has to happen tomorrow.

207
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:04,032
I want you to take this cash,
do the job and disappear.

208
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,665
How long would it take you
to get this kind of money?

209
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,522
5... 10... 15 years?

210
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,693
You can do a lot of good things with this.

211
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,321
You deserve it.

212
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,733
Now I can't make you do this,

213
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,915
But I can make damn sure something
happens to you if you don't.

214
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:31,629
Are you in?

215
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,054
Have a look at this...

216
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,102
Straight line design,

217
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:43,120
Laser designated scope.

218
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:47,351
You can shoot the pecker off
a mosquito at a thousand yards.

219
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:50,399
And keep the balls unruffled.

220
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:55,739
Machete?

221
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,781
That's only good if you wanna make a
brutal point.

222
00:19:57,783 --> 00:20:00,700
But it's low tech. Completely
unsuited to our purposes.

223
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:02,037
Backup...

224
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:04,038
Here's your backup.

225
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,583
Me.

226
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:08,248
You call or text
if you have any problems or delays.

227
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,665
You need to be on that
roof by 1 pm sharp.

228
00:20:17,054 --> 00:20:19,628
And put a bullet in the senator
by 1:04.

229
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:13,322
Get up!

230
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:15,908
God damn it April.

231
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:18,659
My business partner has
very little tolerance
for bullshit.

232
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,205
That's the second operation
in the last six months

233
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:29,336
I've had to close down
because of your mentally...

234
00:21:31,134 --> 00:21:32,176
I told you a thousand times.

235
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:34,510
You need something
you come to me directly.

236
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:39,599
You do not go to these labs.

237
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,947
You got something to say to me?

238
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:56,535
Sorry daddy.

239
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:29,988
What's this?

240
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:31,489
$150 thousand

241
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:32,532
Cash.

242
00:22:33,868 --> 00:22:35,201
Are you out of your mind?

243
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:37,621
The Network got me across once.

244
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:39,623
Use this.

245
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,500
For the people you help.

246
00:22:41,502 --> 00:22:43,835
I don't know how you know what you know.

247
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,713
But I'm glad I know you.

248
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:52,637
What'd you want?

249
00:22:54,348 --> 00:22:55,390
Here.

250
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,434
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Senator John McLaughlin.

251
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,442
I want to thank you all for coming
out today!

252
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:10,113
And I want to thank my supporters
from the bottom of my heart.

253
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:16,829
Because we have been tested.

254
00:23:16,831 --> 00:23:18,915
Tested by fire!

255
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:23,468
Our borders have been
put to the test, and let me tell you
we have failed that test.

256
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:27,256
The aliens,  the infiltrators, the outsiders...

257
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:30,296
they come right across
by light of day and dark of night.

258
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,336
They'll bleed us, they're parasites.

259
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:33,889
They'll bleed us until we as city,

260
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:35,555
a county, a state,

261
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
a nation, are all bled out.

262
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:41,434
Now make no mistake,
we are at war.

263
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,941
Every time an illegal dances across
our border,

264
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:47,643
it is an act of aggression against
this sovereign state.

265
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:49,545
an overt act of terrorism.

266
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,797
Everywhere I go in this glorious state,

267
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,482
people are talking about change.

268
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:59,462
I say why change?
This is a great state founded
on the principles of liberty.

269
00:23:59,794 --> 00:24:01,211
I don't want to change that.

270
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:05,584
Our rightful citizens are
hardworking Americans,

271
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:09,498
who have earned their paychecks
by the grit of their guts and
the sweat of their brow!

272
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,335
I don't want to change that!
-Yeah!

273
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,883
Change! That's what they want,
change!

274
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:17,133
Change the laws,
open the doors!

275
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:18,187
Red rover! Red rover!

276
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:19,856
Let the terrorists come over!

277
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,359
Let me tell you what change
that'll bring!

278
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:25,570
68 cents!

279
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,406
The jingle-jangle
of pennies in your pocket;

280
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:31,575
because the scavengers, the leeches,
the parasites,

281
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:33,161
are walking away with your money,

282
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:36,748
while you're left
with the change!

283
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:40,461
So, I wanna say one more thing:

284
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:42,589
Who you gonna vote for?

285
00:24:59,316 --> 00:25:00,233
There!

286
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,234
Up there! I saw someone shot from up there!

287
00:25:04,406 --> 00:25:05,447
Get him to Fort Briggs!

288
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:14,456
Roger! I'm on my way.

289
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:30,933
Go ahead.

290
00:25:32,018 --> 00:25:33,060
Shoot him Nacho.

291
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:34,353
'Cus right after that.

292
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:36,647
The three of us

293
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:38,232
Are gonna shoot one of you.

294
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:46,533
Ah,  Shit!

295
00:25:57,629 --> 00:25:58,671
Try it.

296
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,381
Go ahead,  Pancho...

297
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,258
I'll grease your chips all
over this fucking alley.

298
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,893
This is fucking big.

299
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:14,104
This guy took a shot at a representative.

300
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,147
No! A Senator.

301
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:16,952
This is fucking high.

302
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,274
The guy can die and we caught him.

303
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,318
Hell yeah, we did!

304
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:22,612
And they'll gonna hang your ass
like Saddam!

305
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:25,115
Look I'm gonna call the boss
unless you wanna do it.

306
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:26,576
Yeah, you go ahead.

307
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:29,410
We got the Mexican black bird
that fell off the rooftop!

308
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:32,415
Bring him to the basement.

309
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:36,503
He stills thinks we're cops.

310
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:38,296
Well of course he will think that.

311
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,048
We frisked him, we cuffed him, we
throw him in the car.

312
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:44,010
Apprehended him just like the
real cops do.

313
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:47,963
Um, I didn't frisk him.

314
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:50,972
Yes, you did.
- Man, I'm telling you I didn’t...

315
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:53,479
Oh! Sweet Jesus.

316
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:02,780
Oh! DAMN!

317
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,648
Shocking news this hour.

318
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:18,420
Senator John McLaughlin
was shot in the leg this afternoon
by an unknown gunman.

319
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:21,300
The Senator was immediately driven to Parklane hospital,

320
00:27:21,303 --> 00:27:24,178
where he was reportedly in good and
stable condition.

321
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:29,410
Video taken at the rally
indicate the gunman may have been
of Mexican descent.

322
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:33,247
Senator McLaughlin has been very vocal
against immigration.

323
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:35,641
And campaigned for
stricter border patrols.

324
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,168
Boss.

325
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:53,545
Video.

326
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,882
You see what I am sending you Mr. Torrez.

327
00:27:57,883 --> 00:28:00,175
It's coming on my screen now.

328
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,178
That's campaign gold.

329
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,865
I thought my contributions
were for the Senator's re-election,

330
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,580
not his retirement.

331
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:11,474
McLaughlin is in a guaranteed win.

332
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:13,562
And in the new session,
as promised,

333
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:15,974
he'll ramrod through
everything we asked for.

334
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:16,987
Pause!

335
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,446
Go back.

336
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:22,534
Who's this?

337
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,157
Nobody.

338
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:27,016
A day labourer from the streets.
He won't be missed.

339
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:28,649
Is he dead?

340
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,562
Dead or dying on a rooftop,
if that's what you mean.

341
00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:32,669
What the fuck is it! Asshole...

342
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,005
Dead or dying?

343
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,965
He'll be dead within minutes.
I guarantee.

344
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:42,096
For your sake.

345
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:47,478
What?

346
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:52,273
It's me. It's done.
I think he's toast.

347
00:28:52,902 --> 00:28:54,693
Don't think! Verify!
Check the morgue,

348
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:56,612
check the hospitals,
check everywhere.

349
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,826
Most do not give illegals
standard treatment in hospitals.

350
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:05,622
But you're with us.

351
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:08,040
Nobody knows you're here.

352
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:11,459
You were brought here under the name John Doe,

353
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:14,296
as a mere spectator.

354
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:17,969
Is that him?

355
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:19,791
Yes.   Dr. Felix
wants to see him.

356
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,897
Quietly...

357
00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:25,134
Amazing, you can see
where the bullet rebounded.

358
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:27,854
It was stopped by another bullet that
was previously lodged there.

359
00:29:27,856 --> 00:29:30,222
If he hadn't been shot before,
he'd be dead now.

360
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:31,982
There's actually a lesson
in there somewhere .

361
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:34,611
I can feel your eyeballs on my uterus.

362

that he was a Federale...God damn it!

Well, you didn't try with the guy I'm calling in.

553

555

556
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:20,296

570

571

said:  'Hey, wanna kill the senator today'?

573
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:09,223
I was afraid he wanted sceptic work.

574
00:46:09,226 --> 00:46:13,476
Instead, he offered me $150,000
to kill the senator.

575
00:46:14,148 --> 00:46:15,314
That's a lot of money.

576

You're not legal in this country.

And after what happened to you in Mexico,
there is no way you're going home.

581

the people need him.

they'll build it,
strip it, chop it.

1066
01:22:27,572 --> 01:22:28,864
Garage's is yours, Homez...

1067
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,366
Got guns?

1068
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:31,408
Si (yes).

1069
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:33,951
We  have missiles,
machine guns--

1070
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:36,770
We fight Von,
we fight Torrez.

1071
01:22:36,775 --> 01:22:38,332
And we take em'
all down at once.

1072
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:39,959
Yo, everyone!

1073
01:22:40,419 --> 01:22:42,700
Listen UP!
Now we got some work to do!

1074
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:51,722
Where is Machete?

1075
01:22:52,474 --> 01:22:53,516
Where is Machete?

1076
01:22:55,519 --> 01:22:56,560
Please.

1077
01:22:57,104 --> 01:22:58,521
Machete needs your help

1078
01:22:58,523 --> 01:23:00,231
or he'll be killed just like Luz,

1079
01:23:00,232 --> 01:23:01,274
just like Padre (Father).

1080
01:23:05,863 --> 01:23:07,030
Listen to me!

1081
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,658
Yes, I am a woman of the law,

1082
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:13,161
and there are lots of laws!

1083
01:23:13,747 --> 01:23:15,497
But if they don't offer us justice,

1084
01:23:15,499 --> 01:23:17,457
Then they aren't law!

1085
01:23:18,377 --> 01:23:20,127
They are just lines drawn in the sand

1086
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:22,546
by men who would stand on your backs.

1087
01:23:23,007 --> 01:23:24,340
For power and glory.

1088
01:23:24,759 --> 01:23:27,717
Men who deserve to be cut down.

1089
01:23:29,347 --> 01:23:31,431
It's time to erase the the line!

1090
01:23:32,517 --> 01:23:34,725
And show these bastards the
true meaning of true law!

1091
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:37,896
We didn't cross the border.

1092
01:23:37,898 --> 01:23:41,106
The border crossed us!

1093
01:23:41,944 --> 01:23:43,277
Viva la (long live) Machete!

1094
01:23:44,405 --> 01:23:45,988
Viva la (long live) Machete!

1095
01:23:47,033 --> 01:23:48,366
You’re Machete's girl.

1096
01:23:48,367 --> 01:23:49,576
I know,

1097
01:23:49,578 --> 01:23:51,494
Unless you're his type.

1098
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:52,871
What type is that?

1099
01:23:54,082 --> 01:23:55,957
Dead.

Networks said the senator calling
in the vigilantes to kill you.

1113
01:24:36,419 --> 01:24:37,544
And Agent Sartana,

1114
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:39,629
she's been captured by Torrez!

1115
01:24:40,799 --> 01:24:43,508
We're all hands and
the bro's armory to load up!

1116
01:24:43,927 --> 01:24:45,552
Time to roll out!

1117
01:25:51,959 --> 01:25:53,334
Give me a vest and a rifle.

1118
01:25:57,841 --> 01:25:59,466
My great grand daddy...

1119
01:25:59,508 --> 01:26:01,512
did not give his life at the Alamo

1120
01:26:01,516 --> 01:26:03,808
so that we could
sell-out our nation

1121
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:06,137
to a bunch of
backstabbing politicians.

1122
01:26:06,516 --> 01:26:07,433
What are you talking about?

1123
01:26:07,935 --> 01:26:09,143
You lied to us.

1124
01:26:09,144 --> 01:26:11,269
And you paid that Mexican
to put on an act:

1125
01:26:11,271 --> 01:26:12,890
to fool the people,

1126
01:26:12,982 --> 01:26:14,648
and to make fools of us.

1127
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:15,817
Now he's on his way...

1128
01:26:15,818 --> 01:26:18,360
and no doubt bringing a whole
mess of bean-eaters.

1129
01:26:18,988 --> 01:26:21,738
You seem to be quite fond of the
Boob-Tube, Senator.

1130
01:26:21,491 --> 01:26:23,574
You've been in the desert
too long, amigo...

1131
01:26:23,702 --> 01:26:25,702
well, let's see
how this blows your skirt up!

1132
01:26:26,204 --> 01:26:30,121
We're gonna simulcast your execution
for the crime of treason.

1133
01:26:34,005 --> 01:26:35,796
No shit stains.

1134
01:26:38,968 --> 01:26:40,635

[ CHATTERING ]

Time for your last testament.

No second takes.

1139
01:27:00,992 --> 01:27:02,284
So, get your lines right!

1140
01:27:30,649 --> 01:27:32,107
Hold the line.

1141

I have desecrated the oath of office...

1142

If you want to survive your own war,

you better become Mexican real fast.

I've lived a hateful life...

And I'm not even from here
I hate Texas.

1168
01:32:41,817 --> 01:32:42,859
I hate the heat.

My father...

1172
01:32:53,872 --> 01:32:55,080
April.

1173
01:33:02,173 --> 01:33:03,173
Forgot the rest.

1174
01:34:03,572 --> 01:34:05,655
You never knew how to stay down,
Punieta (jerk off).

1175
01:34:06,325 --> 01:34:08,117
So I guess
I have to teach you.

Got something to say?

1177
01:34:17,712 --> 01:34:19,629
Now you got something to say?

1178
01:34:30,309 --> 01:34:32,518
Back the fuck up and watch.

1179
01:34:36,024 --> 01:34:37,107
Okay Punieta!

We used to be Federales together,

01:34:56,546 --> 01:34:57,587
You remember?

1183
01:35:02,803 --> 01:35:03,719
We were brothers...

1184
01:35:04,763 --> 01:35:05,555
But you?

1185
01:35:05,556 --> 01:35:07,722
went for the honor.

1186
01:35:07,724 --> 01:35:09,391
Pendejo.

1187
01:35:18,695 --> 01:35:20,195
And, I went for the power.

1188
01:35:22,199 --> 01:35:24,365
We killed a lot
of bad guys together.

1189
01:35:26,536 --> 01:35:28,244
Now I'm the bad guy.

1190
01:35:29,623 --> 01:35:31,248
What do you wanna do?
hermanito (little brother)?

1191
01:35:43,012 --> 01:35:45,304
Look at your Machete now, Cabrón!

1192
01:35:49,769 --> 01:35:50,978
He's gonna kill him.

1193
01:35:52,731 --> 01:35:54,231
No he's not.

1194
01:35:56,068 --> 01:35:57,235
He's Machete.

1195
01:36:02,075 --> 01:36:03,283
You got a point.

1196
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:13,878
Fuck.

1197
01:36:16,048 --> 01:36:19,257
You know I could kill you
right now very easily.

1198
01:36:20,302 --> 01:36:21,219
Believe me.

1199
01:36:22,013 --> 01:36:23,638
This is nothing.

1200
01:36:26,017 --> 01:36:27,642
This ain't shit.

1201
01:36:28,145 --> 01:36:29,145
But...

1202
01:36:31,356 --> 01:36:35,064
I know you'll just be waiting for me in hell.

1203
01:36:35,152 --> 01:36:38,068
So...

1204
01:36:40,073 --> 01:36:41,282
I think I will say goodbye.

1205
01:36:44,996 --> 01:36:46,246
Fuck it.

1206
01:38:17,721 --> 01:38:18,763
There's one!

1207
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:21,681
God damn cockroach

1208
01:38:34,196 --> 01:38:35,863
Can't speak english. Can you boy?

1209
01:38:40,203 --> 01:38:41,537
Welcome to America.

1210
01:39:31,467 --> 01:39:33,008
What?
Do you wanna see my ID?

1211
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:34,052
Don't bother.

1212
01:39:35,471 --> 01:39:36,804
I've got something better.

1213
01:39:39,642 --> 01:39:40,767
I called in a few favors.

1214
01:39:40,768 --> 01:39:41,810
Look at this.

1215
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:43,979
Got you all the right papers.

1216
01:39:45,023 --> 01:39:46,440
You can start over now.

1217
01:39:47,234 --> 01:39:48,609
Be a real person.

1218
01:39:49,194 --> 01:39:50,736
Why do I want
to be a real person?

1219
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:54,030
When I'm already a myth.

1220
01:39:55,075 --> 01:39:56,242
Where will you go?

1221
01:39:58,412 --> 01:40:00,329
Everywhere.

1222
01:40:04,836 --> 01:40:06,711
Can I ride with you?
