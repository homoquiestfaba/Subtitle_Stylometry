1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:07,505
Projector Whirring

2
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:38,063
- I, Alex, take you, Hellen,
to be my lawfully wedded wife,

3
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:42,073
to have and to hold,

4
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,804
in sickness and health,

5
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:51,145
for richer,
for poorer,

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,344
for as long as we both-

7
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,478
for better or worse,

8
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,352
till death do us part.

9
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:12,930
- I have prepared
my own vows for this.

10
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,873
I, Hellen, take you, Alex,

11
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:23,973
to be my beautiful,
wonderful wife

12
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:31,047
because no one else
understands me the way you do.

13
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:38,495
No one knows where I've
come from the way that you do.

14
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:42,432
I want us
to have children together,

15
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,299
and I want them
to be best friends,

16
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:50,138
and I want them to play
together every day.

17
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,371
I want to grow old with you
and have silver hair

18
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,144
and run around and be crazy...

19
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,846
and be there until you die.

20
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,618
- Okay, we're rolling.

21
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,722
- Ooh.

22
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,620
- You know what?

23
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,326
Let's just go
to the verse here

24
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,995
instead of the chorus.

25
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,940
- Why do you have to travel?

26
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,643
I'm being-
I know it's immature.

27
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,684
- Why do I have to travel?

28
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,754
- I'm not actually
asking you this.

29
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,049
- I know.
- This is a fake question.

30
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,716
- Okay, you got more
fake questions?

31
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:53,757
- Yeah.

32
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,293
Do you love me?

33
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,384
- That's not a fake question.

34
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,861
- It is a fake question.

35
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,192
I know the answer.

36
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,994
- That's not a fake question.
- You married me.

37
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,159
You'd be retarded to marry me
if you didn't-

38
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,103
if you weren't
in love with me.

39
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,731
I just like hearing you say it,
if you felt like being like,

40
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,402
"Oh, baby,
I'm gonna miss you so much. "

41
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,446
- Oh, baby,
I'm gonna miss you so much.

42
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,846
- And then you can say,
"Oh, I'm gonna ache. "

43
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,939
- I'm gonna ache.

44
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,349
- Yeah?

45
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,251
"I'm gonna think about you
when I'm singing. "

46
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,689
- I'm gonna think about you
when I'm singing.

47
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:33,892
- And, "I'll feel like
I'm starving in the desert. "

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,025
- I'll feel like
I'm starving in the desert.

49
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,582
- Hi.
- Hi, you guys.

50
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,127
- How you doing?
- Thanks for coming back.

51
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,161
- Thank you so much.

52
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,195
- Oh, thank you.

53
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,389
- How are you?

54
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,431
- Good, how are you?

55
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,522
- Good.

56
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,760
It's good
to see you guys again.

57
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,097
- Yeah,
thanks for having us back.

58
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,670
- Oh, yeah,
no, thanks for coming.

59
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,536
So whenever you're ready just-

60
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,404
- Do you have any questions?

61
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,410
- Uh, do you want us to, like,
mime the stuff of, like,

62
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,106
the headphones or just pretend
I'm not putting on headphones?

63
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,341
- Um, whatever you feel
comfortable with.

64
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,145
Whatever happens is great.

65
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,184
- Okay.

66
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,811
- Yeah.
Don't worry about it.

67
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,927
- It's kind of obvious.

68
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,829
- I just
make it up as I go along.

69
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,198
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing half the time.

70
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:18,235
- Yeah, you do.

71
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,269
- No, I don't.

72
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,772
I mean,
I do, but it's just-

73
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,239
- You totally know
what you're doing.

74
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,333
- If I had any notion of
what I thought might be popular,

75
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,377
I'd do that.

76
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,503
But this is what I do.

77
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,080
This is what I have
to work with right now.

78
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,114
- Keep going.
- Sorry.

79
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,342
- There was talking
back there.

80
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:36,946
- Um, it's totally normal.

81
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,081
- I make what I make,
and that's what I do.

82
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,719
If I had any notion of what
might be popular, I'd do that.

83
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,160
But this is what I do.

84
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,753
This is what
I have to work with right now.

85
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,196
- You can go ahead
and sit in a chair.

86
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,427
- I feel like you'll be more,
that'll be-

87
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,832
- You want me to move it
or right here?

88
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,869
- Yeah.
Yeah.

89
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,836
- Okay.

90
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,929
- That's better.

91
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,133
Okay, just keep going.

92
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,836
Yeah, you can grab a chair too,
actually.

93
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,470
I really
like you guys together so-

94
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:05,415
just grab a-
yeah, exactly.

95
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,219
- We'll figure it out.

96
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,521
That's what you do.

97
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,322
It's gonna be good.

98
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,554
- Oh, you guys,
this is good.

99
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,894
It's great.

100
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,231
Are you guys-what,
did you want to ask something?

101
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,067
- Yeah, at the very end, I'm not
sure whether to, sort of,

102
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:32,042
like, not patronize him, but
try to really make him believe

103
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,406
that he's
going to figure it out.

104
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,607
- Yeah, there are a lot
of different options

105
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,879
you can explore, but I like-

106
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,317
oh, our-

107
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,548
the playwright's wondering
where you're from.

108
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,251
You, yeah.
Where did you grow up?

109
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,292
- Where did I grow up?

110
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,827
In Tennessee.

111
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,756
- Oh, baby.

112
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,695
- I know this bra should have
some more push up to it.

113
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,130
- Cute.
I like that bra.

114
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,828
- I'm totally hanging out.
- I really like that bra.

115
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,928
Your hair looks really good
with those colors,

116
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,267
all the colors.

117
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,306
Hi, sis.

118
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,340
- Hi.

119
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,343
- Hi.

120
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,140
- Yeah, yeah.

121
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,444
You can just jump back there.

122
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,178
- It's so blonde.

123
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,618
- I just got my roots done today
for the shoot.

124
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,384
- It looks good.

125
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,086
Here,
come over here real quick.

126
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,126
Good.

127
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,196
That's nice.

128
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,423
I like it.

129
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,522
That looks really innocent.

130
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,498
And I can see your panty line
through the dress,

131
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,433
so it looks really nice.

132
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:32,595
- That's why I wore the black-

133
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,672
- And your belly button.

134
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,206
- And my belly button.

135
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,106
- That one's scary because
I've got my shadow in it.

136
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,609
It looks like
I'm looming over you.

137
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,680
- Dun-dun-dun.

138
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,976
- I like-
ooh, I like that.

139
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,072
- My panties?

140
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,776
- I do like them.

141
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,513
You can't stay.

142
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,553
You can't stay here.

143
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,145
- I know.
I see that.

144
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,189
I know.

145
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,223
- You have to go.

146
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,657
- When did she get here?

147
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,125
Why is she here?

148
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,160
- My sister?

149
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,423
- Was she here when I called?

150
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,056
I didn't really call, did I?

151
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,727
'Cause-yeah, maybe when your
sister's gone or something.

152
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,303
- Okay, all right, go.

153
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,634
- Okay.

154
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,264
Thank you.

155
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,307
- You don't want the tea?

156
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,309
- Nope.
No, definitely not.

157
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,192
- Will you do that baby cry
that I taught you?

158
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:50,807
Your turn.

159
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,848
- Okay.

160
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,489
- Same time.

161
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,829
- I'm creeping myself out.

162
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,736
- I know.

163
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,809
- You're a sick sister to teach
me such horrible things.

164
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,241
- I'm a good sister.

165
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,334
- You're a horrible example.

166
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,937
- I'm not a horrible example.

167
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,540
I taught you real-
that's a really good trick.

168
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,186
Hey, baby, it's me.

169
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:37,126
Um, I'm calling-
I have a question to ask you.

170
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:42,189
Um, I was wondering if it would
be okay with you if the guy

171
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,360
I'm working with crashed over
here sometimes

172
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,495
'cause he's, like, couch hopping
and stuff

173
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,800
and he doesn't
even really have

174
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:55,643
a great place-just because
we're rehearsing late a lot.

175
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,716
And I just wanted to make sure
it was okay with you

176
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,377
if he-
if he crashed.

177
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:05,446
Um, I'm sure-yeah,
I'm sure you'll be fine with it.

178
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,050
I'm just letting you
be in the know.

179
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,597
Okay, so I love you,

180
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,724
and I hope the tour
is going well.

181
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,430
Call me
when you get some free time.

182
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,904
Okay, uh...

183
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,558
- Hang on, hang on.

184
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,758
Hello?

185
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,857
- But you've missed the call.

186
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,129
He puts the phone down.

187
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,102
Then from out the door he hears
a voice calling him,

188
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,900
his girlfriend, Ellie.

189
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,441
- Hey, Oliver,
I need some help.

190
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,477
- With much ado, and much
bumping and stumbling,

191
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,875
the duo
make their way up the stairs

192
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,140
back into the apartment,

193
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,409
each carrying one end
of a massive wooden table.

194
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,078
They maneuver
their way through the door.

195
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:12,180
Oh, he kicks the box he was
carrying earlier out of the way.

196
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,887
- Let's just set it down here.

197
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,463
- So just keep going
with "Jesus"

198
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,588
at the bottom of the page.

199
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,029
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

200
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,567
- Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

201
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,762
- Jesus.

202
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,862
- It's not important.
It's just the words.

203
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,474
- Oh, my God.

204
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,377
Oliver, that's amazing.

205
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,645
This picture of you
is so good.

206
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,878
- I know.

207
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,648
- Come here.

208
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,849
- Okay.

209
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,426
- And my phone rings, right?

210
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,459
Hey, that's Eric.

211
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,551
He wants-
it's Eric.

212
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,062
He wants to know
where we're going.

213
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,622
I told him we might be out.

214
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:56,928
- Okay, let's go.

215
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,367
- You see, it's hard.

216
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,998
If you were like, "You are
amazing," then I would buy it,

217
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,134
but I don't know
what's going on with us.

218
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:10,909
- You were amazing today.

219
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,408
- I believe that.
I believe that.

220
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,648
- I was gonna add "seriously. "

221
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,121
- Now I believe you even more.

222
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,056
- Well, I'm good.
- And I know it's true.

223
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,095
- Well, yeah.

224
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,663
It is true.

225
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,934
- Alexander,

226
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:40,603
I hereby christen thee Knight
of the Order of the Baked Goods.

227
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:55,918
- You should meet the person
that I'm working with.

228
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,895
I think you guys
should hang out.

229
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,899
- Okay.

230
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,662
- Why?
- He's nice.

231
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,430
- Oh, that's exciting.

232
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,201
Where does he live?

233
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,905
- Well, he's from Tennessee,
but he just moved here,

234
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,244
so he's couch surfing right now.

235
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:25,956
Do you think it's weird that I
offered that he could stay here,

236
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,721
if he needed to?

237
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,318
- Does Eliott think it's weird?

238
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,455
- No, Eliott's fine with it.

239
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,368
- Reload.

240
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,735
Reload.

241
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,240
Whoo-hoo!

242
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,910
You really nailed that one.

243
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:54,951
Reload.

244
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,660
- Ah!

245
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,071
Whoo!

246
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,487
- Don't make it too good.
I'm just gonna get in it.

247
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,621
- I can tuck you in.

248
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,892
- Does this big bed
come with a maid?

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,834
- I'm sorry, that's dirty.

250
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,404
That's dirty.

251
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,666
- Don't worry about it.

252
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,900
I don't care.

253
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,373
- I have another one
right over there.

254
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,068
That's dirty.

255
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,616
- Oh, much better.
Thank you.

256
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,417
- Do you want me to just
set the alarm for, like,

257
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,991
an hour and a half
before rehearsal?

258
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,526
- No, yeah, just kick me.

259
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,595
I'll get up.

260
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:44,662
- I can do that?

261
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:45,787
- You can kick me.

262
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,763
I give you full permission
to kick me.

263
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,390
- Okay.

264
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,964
Whatcha reading?

265
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,269
- One of your books.

266
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,241
I just learned how so,
you know,

267
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,608
I just thought
I'd take advantage of it.

268
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,877
Them books on tape
were something else,

269
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,716
but now it's just like
Reading Rainbow.

270
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,116
- Okay, now you're
really uncomfortable now.

271
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,278
- No, I just-
- What?

272
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,411
- No, I'm not uncomfortable.

273
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,649
I'm, um...

274
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,554
I'm trying to figure out
how to do it and not do it,

275
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:48,648
you know what I mean?

276
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,125
Like, so I guess
we're not gonna kiss,

277
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,924
but sort of figure out
how we're gonna, like-

278
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,997
- You know what?

279
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,622
Turn her around
to kiss her for now.

280
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,396
- So be like hey.

281
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,938
- Do you have a problem
with any of this?

282
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,472
- No, no.

283
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,667
- And if you don't want us,
like, watching, we can leave.

284
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,107
- Sure, I mean,
if you guys want to...

285
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,405
- Again, I love you.

286
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,003
- I love you.

287
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,206
- And then what happens?

288
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,577
- This place is perfect.

289
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,742
- Yeah, Reggie, you keep
reading the lines, Reggie,

290
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,479
and they'll just do whatever
they're doing.

291
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,747
Go ahead.

292
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,914
- Say, "this place is perfect. "
- This place is perfect.

293
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,821
- Yeah, okay, go ahead.
- That's his line, right?

294
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:21,893
- Keep-
yeah, yeah, yeah.

295
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,052
- Oh, he's just gonna say them?

296
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,459
- He's gonna just
read them for now,

297
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,757
'cause you guys don't know them.

298
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,627
And that way, you can
keep going with the action,

299
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,665
just as an exercise.

300
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:29,961
- Okay.
- Yeah.

301
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,298
- Is Reggie saying the lines-
- Yeah, just try it.

302
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,336
Just trust me.

303
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,370
Just try it, okay?

304
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,440
Reggie, go.

305
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,633
- I love you.
- Keep kissing.

306
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,175
Yeah, I love you.

307
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,471
No, it's too weird.

308
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,704
- Sorry.

309
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,507
- Okay, never mind, Reggie,
never mind.

310
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,775
Okay, all right, all right,
start again.

311
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,282
No, focus you guys.
I'm sorry.

312
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,682
- A little more feeling.
- What?

313
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,311
- Wait, so let's just look at it
for a half a second.

314
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,354
Okay, I love you.

315
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,684
I love you.

316
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,282
- Okay, so let's say
I put the stuff down here.

317
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:59,990
Oh, you didn't tell me
it was a walk-up.

318
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:04,091
- Wow, you really are,
you're running on empty now.

319
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,135
Right?

320
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,226
Looking in your fridge?

321
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,566
- Okay, right, right.

322
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,038
How much do I owe you?

323
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,473
- 88 bucks
and something cents.

324
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,581
- I think that there are-

325
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,013
I think
we should just pay attention

326
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,981
to where there are question
marks,

327
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,713
because I think that
the question marks are there,

328
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,688
you know,
people are asking questions.

329
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,349
What I mean to say is
that the person asking

330
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,949
actually wants an answer.

331
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,120
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

332
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,255
- So, Jen,
you think we're gonna keep that?

333
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,390
You know what I mean about
the highlight thing though,

334
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:35,932
right, Jen?

335
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,557
- You know
you're worried sometimes

336
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,205
about being too zealous?

337
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,240
That that, 'cause you're...

338
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,505
I think
maybe you have a tendency

339
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:50,343
to lay back a little more,
just as a person.

340
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,814
I'm not trying
to psychoanalyze you.

341
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,350
But, like, I don't.

342
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:58,617
Like, I always feel like I'm
just rushing forward at people,

343
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:03,821
like my energy just sort of
rushes forward at people.

344
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,861
I'm a little, um-

345
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,055
- I didn't feel that.

346
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,597
- You don't?
- Uh-uh.

347
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,530
- It doesn't feel
like it's too much?

348
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,934
- No, it feels right.

349
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,598
- Okay.

350
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,675
I mean, I can tell
that it's not scaring you

351
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,607
'cause you feel so solid.

352
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:27,617
- Sorry, it's, like-
you've got a string.

353
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,620
It's, like, been bugging me.

354
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,690
There.

355
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,542
- Look up there.

356
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,110
Yeah.

357
00:21:56,214 --> 00:22:01,049
More like you're more interested
in what's up there.

358
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,087
Put your chin up.
Put your chin up.

359
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,230
It's Jamie.

360
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,800
Oh, we're going
shopping this weekend,

361
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,669
and you should
come with us.

362
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:29,879
But don't do that.

363
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,814
It makes your chin, like, all...

364
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,133
- All right, try this.

365
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:56,469
Say, um, say, uh, say um, wait
um, "Is everything okay? "

366
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,133
- Is everything okay?
- Okay, right.

367
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,144
And what I want you to say is
um, "I'm just trying to, uh-

368
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,713
I'm trying to get
more of your tongue. "

369
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:03,906
- What?

370
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,676
- Is that-
just go with me, go with me.

371
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,116
I'm trying to make this-
I just want to make it so

372
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,212
it's not so, like, perfect,
right, like, right off.

373
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,847
- I think it's late in the day,

374
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,222
and that
doesn't make much sense.

375
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,956
And what we'd agreed we were
going to do is just block the-

376
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,588
- Can I just hear it?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

377
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:21,893
- I just want to hear it,
you know,

378
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,763
and we can get rid of it-

379
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,269
- Where do you want
that dialogue to happen?

380
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,861
Bring her back down here,

381
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,498
but then I need you
to immediately, like-

382
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,339
sorry can you move
your boots for one second-

383
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,471
and then just kind of, like-
yeah, however-

384
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,175
I just wanted to see
if this is-yeah, like here.

385
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,684
And then-
is this making sense?

386
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,719
- Yeah.

387
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:43,845
- Okay, so wait.

388
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,685
- Should I lock-
lock him in or just...

389
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,625
Yeah, I mean, whatever-
when he's here you'll-

390
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,355
but, see,
now we're so close to the table.

391
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,430
- Yeah, I feel...

392
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,793
- Yeah, it's dangerous.

393
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,299
- Like if we like get into it
or something, you know,

394
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,734
like, that's gonna
ruin the magic.

395
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,305
- Like, when she's on top of me,

396
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:04,375
that's when I take her shirt
off, then we go down.

397
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,137
Then you...

398
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,109
- Yeah, and then
you're on top of her here.

399
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,612
Like, kiss her.

400
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:10,681
- You can't fake-

401
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,079
No, I know you're not,

402
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,175
but my point is that,
how are we going to fake that

403
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,050
at this point downstage?

404
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:20,647
And even if we're up on the
couch, how do you fake that,

405
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,989
unless there's-I mean,
the old-fashioned way to do it

406
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,584
is, this couch
would be turned around,

407
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,790
and you'd just see them
fall behind the couch.

408
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:32,233
But now it's 2008, and they're
in front of the couch,

409
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,864
and they're rolling around,
but how do you fake sex?

410
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,670
- If, if...

411
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:39,709
- Do you see my point?

412
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,210
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

413
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,110
- If he backs up, like,
if he doesn't have, like,

414
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,911
his underwear down and a full
erection, where are we?

415
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,781
- Well, I think we should stage
it in a way that it's not-

416
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,947
it's not you know-
it's unclear.

417
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,617
- Yeah, but then we're into the
old-fashioned thing of, like,

418
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,388
it's behind the couch or it's
under covers, you know,

419
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,521
and that's fine,

420
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,759
but I just didn't think we were
going as far as-

421
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,063
- However we get to the point
where the audience feels

422
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,968
like they're seeing something
more intimate and more-

423
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,438
- What are you guys...

424
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,739
- What would I do without you?

425
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,913
Yeah, you could do...

426
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,559
This place look all-

427
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,561
okay, I'm done.

428
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:32,595
- Come on.

429
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,664
- I'm done.

430
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,131
What time is it?

431
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,065
- I don't know.

432
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,810
- Thank you very much.

433
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,192
- Jamie.

434
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,686
Who you texting?

435
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,378
- It's just the color
I don't know if I like.

436
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,613
- Mustard?

437
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,280
- It's not mustard.

438
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,551
It's like a sunshine.

439
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,648
- Like sunshine?

440
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,694
- Like sunshine.

441
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,524
- Would this go down too low?

442
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,864
You know what I mean?
Like, is it-

443
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,994
- Just try it on.

444
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,299
- Is it too booby?

445
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,670
- I don't know.
I bet you could adjust it.

446
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:34,279
- Cute.

447
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,616
- I have, like,
a rash on my face.

448
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,780
Do you have
any products at home?

449
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,289
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

450
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,384
I just sort of feel like I need
to take care of this now.

451
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,793
- You want to go home right now
and take care of it?

452
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,866
- I'm afraid it's gonna get
worse if we keep hanging out

453
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:53,427
and going outside
and bopping around.

454
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,132
- Um, okay.

455
00:27:56,241 --> 00:28:00,302
Why don't you, like, splash
water on it or something?

456
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,903
- Um, I'll try that.

457
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,381
- Okay.
We can go home if you want.

458
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,509
- No, I'll try it-I don't-

459
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,918
I'll try splashing water on it
and then see-

460
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,957
or we can just buy stuff,
I guess, while we're out.

461
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,459
- Okay.

462
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,223
It doesn't
look that bad, Alex.

463
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,195
- I'm a whiner.

464
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,566
- That's fine.

465
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:27,603
- I'll be back.

466
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,968
I'm gonna go get water.

467
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,479
- Jamie.

468
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:41,609
Jamie.

469
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,982
- Yeah.

470
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,421
- Come show me which one you
want me to try on next.

471
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,528
Inside.

472
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:23,991
Put your sexy face on.

473
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,994
I don't think
that was my sexy face.

474
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,038
Cute.

475
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,371
Ready?

476
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,539
Ready?

477
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:53,554
I get really into it so...

478
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:56,889
- Once upon a time,

479
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:04,561
there was a family
that had two girls,

480
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:11,006
not twins but very close.

481
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:18,880
They were the brightest,
most wonderful girls.

482
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:25,513
But they had a problem.

483
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:32,586
They could only be together,

484
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:39,466
and they didn't like
always being together.

485
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:43,837
But they had to be.

486
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:47,878
They always had fun,

487
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:56,580
but sometimes
they would run apart,

488
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:05,187
and the magnetism
would smash them back together.

489
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:11,428
So one sister said,

490
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:19,807
"I need to...

491
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,813
die. "

492
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:33,290
And the other sister said,
"Don't die.

493
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:41,093
"We can find a way
to stay together always

494
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:46,159
and be ourselves. "

495
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:14,025
- Okay, so now this is when I
need you to get his shirt off.

496
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:28,578
Now when you're kissing her,
just stay on the upstage side.

497
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,508
Go in for a kiss.

498
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,915
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.

499
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,145
Perfect.

500
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,640
It would be even great
if you could-yeah.

501
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:05,681
I mean just a little.

502
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,479
Sorry, go ahead.

503
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,247
I know, it's awkward.

504
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,799
Now go down this way.

505
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,740
So her face is downstage.

506
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,006
Her face
is closer to the audience.

507
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,308
- See what I mean?
- Okay.

508
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,347
- Now go.

509
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,974
Sorry.

510
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,484
Yeah, perfect.

511
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,175
- Okay, so then...

512
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,774
- What?

513
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,945
- Oh, down this way.

514
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,437
- So the bra is off.

515
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,304
Put your hands here.

516
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,002
- You got it.

517
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,044
- Yeah, yeah.

518
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,477
And then...

519
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,159
- Like, I can't turn
the chemistry off

520
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,527
or, like, I can't stop having
this body

521
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,567
that feels really good

522
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:44,471
when it's close to somebody,
whether I'm...

523
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,806
- Married to them or not?

524
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,901
- Yeah.

525
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,105
- It's good.

526
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,114
It's really good
what you're doing.

527
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,255
- My chest hurts.

528
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,383
- My chest always hurts.

529
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,290
- Really?

530
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,362
- Yeah.

531
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,091
You're a vessel.

532
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,599
I'm sorry.

533
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,532
I'm sorry.

534
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:19,042
- I'm exhausted trying to,
like, love my husband...

535
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:22,169
- And be an actress
all at the same time.

536
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:29,883
- He's gonna see
that I'm not normal.

537
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,928
- He married an actress.

538
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,563
Don't worry about it.

539
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,866
Just do your work.

540
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,838
Show up.

541
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,105
You know, enjoy the chemistry
you have when you have it.

542
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,645
It's your secret.

543
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,873
It's not
anybody else's business.

544
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,347
The rest of it
will work itself out.

545
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,317
These things pass.

546
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,115
Okay?

547
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,171
- Got that?

548
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,639
- Mm-hmm.

549
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,214
- For some reason,
I started taking pictures

550
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,881
of all the pizza boxes that
we saw when we were on tour,

551
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,482
because there's so much, so many
pizza boxes that I thought,

552
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,061
I don't know,
somehow it's like a series

553
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,595
that I should start
putting together.

554
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:20,789
Do you know what I'm saying?

555
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:24,356
No, this is not interesting
to you at all.

556
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,062
- Um, no, it is.

557
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,071
I like it.

558
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,609
What are you doing there?

559
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,735
- I can't reach.

560
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,437
- You can't reach?
I'm right here.

561
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,639
- Oh, my gosh,

562
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,443
you're supposed
to meet me halfway there.

563
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,711
- But you were
so far more than halfway

564
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,014
that I thought you were,
like, coming in to kiss me.

565
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,818
- Right, and you were
leaning back.

566
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,517
Taking it easy, eh?

567
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,219
Taking it easy.

568
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,261
Let me do all the work.

569
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,330
- I'm tired.

570
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,399
Why are you
giving me a hard time?

571
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,671
Hello, hello.

572
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,241
- Hello.

573
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,745
- Your shirt's a little small.

574
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,051
You should let me have it.

575
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,886
- You can have it.

576
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,239
- Your hand is cold.

577
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,023
- Going to bed?

578
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,464
- Will you get in your PJs
and spoon me?

579
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,172
- I have to pee.

580
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,210
- What?

581
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,802
- I have to pee.

582
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,935
- Refreshing, right?

583
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,441
- What is it?

584
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,366
- Beautiful.

585
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,324
Yep, okay.

586
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,792
Five, five seconds.

587
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:25,734
1, 2, 3, 4.

588
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,167
Okay.

589
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,260
I'll call you at 6:00.

590
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,304
- Stay.

591
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,067
- I'll call you at 6:00.

592
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,006
Ah!

593
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,223
Okay, I'm glad you're back.

594
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,729
- Well, you know,
yeah, I think...

595
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,493
- Okay, we need
to make the choice then.

596
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,295
Okay, you need
to be standing up.

597
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,664
Stand up.

598
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,203
Go back.

599
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,205
- If you are flirting and
you're not supposed to be,

600
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,276
what you would do
is everything to not,

601
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,366
you know what I mean?

602
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,467
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

603
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,671
- Yes.

604
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,943
- You'd be finding, like,
little ways to-

605
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,577
and that's why people,
like, drop stuff or...

606
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,120
- Right, right, right,
yeah, yeah.

607
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:24,388
- Because it's hard to focus
when you really want to be-

608
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,726
you know, when you're really
attracted to somebody.

609
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,855
- Right?
- Right.

610
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,297
- As I recall.

611
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,493
- Right.

612
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,001
- Okay.

613
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,333
You guys would know better than
me at this point in your lives.

614
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,371
Okay.

615
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:37,997
All right, let's go.

616
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,544
- This is better.

617
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,546
- Yeah.
- Right? I mean...

618
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,309
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I can't take it anymore.

619
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,748
- Yeah.
- Okay, go ahead.

620
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,079
- I feel so much better.

621
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,450
It's like
I just lost like 30 pounds.

622
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,365
- You look so pretty.

623
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:06,436
- Okay, all right, good.

624
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,504
All right, let's go.

625
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:08,798
- Aw.

626
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,703
- Can I have a hug?

627
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,400
- Save it for the scene.

628
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,221
- What's the ukulele for, champ?

629
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,093
Is that a prop?

630
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,928
- What?
- Is that a prop?

631
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,092
A prop ukulele?

632
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,363
Is that a real-
are you playing that?

633
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,029
- I mean, I'm not-
I don't know how to play.

634
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:45,267
I'm trying
to teach myself to play.

635
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,569
So I mean,
I just picked it up at-

636
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,167
- He could teach you.

637
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,109
- What?
- He could teach you.

638
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,011
- I can play the ukulele.

639
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:55,347
- No, I mean I just kind of
wanted to teach myself.

640
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,250
I mean, yeah, I'm sure you
could teach me, but like-

641
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,550
- You can figure it out.

642
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,818
- I just-I don't know-
something about learning

643
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,622
to play yourself.

644
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,726
- What?

645
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,858
- This is the World's Fair park
that they built in 1964,

646
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,834
and this is,
like, the tennis courts.

647
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,666
And there's, like,
this cool statue here.

648
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,638
And, like, I have done this,
where you, like,

649
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,174
go get lemon ice

650
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,335
and you sit in here and you,
like, watch these little kids

651
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,844
play tennis,
'cause there's, like,

652
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,312
a really cool
city tennis program

653
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,780
that Billie Jean King started.

654
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,078
- Uh-huh.

655
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,379
- She gets up from the couch,

656
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:33,445
walks around behind him
as he opens the computer.

657
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:38,153
She bites her lip, trying not to
laugh as she watches him.

658
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:41,129
He raises
his eyebrows and laughs.

659
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,425
Very nice.

660
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,593
That's going on my desktop.

661
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:48,569
- Her arms slide
around his waist and his chest.

662
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,106
- You're not
so lonely anymore

663
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,835
- Okay.

664
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,639
- There's something new
in your drawers

665
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:56,678
- Put me in your arms.

666
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,907
Hey.

667
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,381
They kiss without separating.

668
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,179
- Over and over

669
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,480
- They make their way
to the sofa,

670
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:07,683
and he undoes
the buttons on her shirt.

671
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:08,917
I love you.

672
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,357
- You and your new shoes

673
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,328
- He undoes the next button,
looking directly into her eyes.

674
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,298
- I love you.

675
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,199
- I'll stay the same,
but you change

676
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,566
- Each other?

677
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,574
- For the worst

678
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,703
You are good, and you are
kind, and you are wise

679
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:30,802
- That's not-

680
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,745
- Each other?

681
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,149
- Of course not.

682
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,551
- A familiar ding rings out
in the computer.

683
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,556
An incoming e-mail.

684
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:42,955
We've got a signal.

685
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,755
- Making my face turn red

686
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:48,059
- I'm cold.

687
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:51,601
- Oliver fumbles around
in the box next to the bed

688
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,192
and pulls out a blanket.

689
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:57,296
Ellie takes her shirt off
the rest of the way.

690
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,840
Take it off.

691
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:01,103
Wraps herself in the blanket.

692
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,338
Another ding from the computer.

693
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,608
- We can check it.

694
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,207
- Oliver's cell phone
begins to ring.

695
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,948
He takes his shirt off and
lies on the couch with Ellie.

696
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:21,794
- I see I'm
losing your love forever

697
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,389
- He can't have him.

698
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,900
He's mine.

699
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,698
Mine.

700
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,396
- And then a light.

701
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:33,499
Now there's a lamp hanging
directly over them.

702
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,577
They're quiet.

703
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,270
They begin making love.

704
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:41,875
The computer continues to beep
and ding and fade out.

705
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:46,319
- New shoes and nubile
for a week

706
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,482
Then they are
something to keep

707
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,581
- So there you go.

708
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,388
- I like it.
It's better.

709
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:54,464
- Yeah?

710
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:59,297
- You are good,
you are kind, you are wise

711
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:04,170
You are good,
you are kind, you are mine

712
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:53,054
- Do you know about this guy,
Eugene Schieffelin?

713
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,646
- Mm-mmm.

714
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:59,252
- He was, like, a drug
manufacturer in the 1890s,

715
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:04,665
and he loved Shakespeare,
so he...

716
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,601
he thought that
all the birds in Shakespeare

717
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,569
should be represented
in North America,

718
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:14,110
so he released 40 starlings
into Central Park.

719
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,200
- Hm.

720
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:24,449
- Now there are hundreds
of millions of starlings,

721
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:31,619
and, you know,
they thrived.

722
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,424
And they drove
all of these other birds

723
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,691
out of their natural habitats,

724
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,495
and they descend
on farmers' crops and,

725
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:43,471
like, eat up all the harvest.

726
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,541
They-flocks
of millions of them

727
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:49,601
get sucked into jet engines and,
like, planes crash.

728
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,022
- We're gonna go see a movie.
You want to come with us?

729
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,852
- Is there milk somewhere?

730
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,858
- Um, there should be.

731
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,827
- Yeah, well, there's not.

732
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,454
So you can just eat it.

733
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,829
Just eat it.

734
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,629
- Okay.

735
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,328
You want to come with us?

736
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,564
- Uh...

737
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,004
- She's got stuff to do.

738
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,700
- Yeah.
- Don't ask.

739
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,372
Don't ask?

740
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,810
Why?

741
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:35,408
- 'Cause she may-
it might be personal.

742
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:47,287
- I'm glad he left his heart
here in your kitchen bowl.

743
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:48,830
- I know.

744
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,924
I'm glad he's here.

745
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,128
- Matt's back.

746
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,636
- Welcome back.

747
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,001
- Um...

748
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,699
- Let's shower.
- Yeah.

749
00:52:58,808 --> 00:52:59,900
- And then go.

750
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,170
- Okay.

751
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,773
Stick.

752
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,408
Ew, ew.

753
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,248
Forehead grease.

754
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,151
Ha!

755
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,422
- Let's go take a shower.

756
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,624
- I have a problem with it

757
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,428
because I know
that you fucking fuck people,

758
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,661
and then
you just toss them out.

759
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,759
- Why are you so mad right now?

760
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,361
- You just wait
till you get people-

761
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,269
no, you just wait
till you get people to love you,

762
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,432
and then you're done with them.

763
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,474
It's like a game for you.

764
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:34,509
- Yeah, it's a game.

765
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,545
It's a game for me.

766
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:37,977
It's a real game.

767
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:41,642
- Yes, it's a "real game. "

768
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:47,621
- What kind of game are you
playing with fucking Jamie?

769
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,157
- What are you talking about?

770
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,886
- "What are you talking about? "

771
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,121
You're a really great actress,
aren't you?

772
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:58,463
You're a really
fucking good actress.

773
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,866
I don't even believe a fucking
word you're saying right now.

774
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,871
I don't believe-you know what,
if you can't-

775
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,998
- I'm not gonna take
relationship advice from you.

776
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,440
- Oh, you're not gonna take
relationship advice from me?

777
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,603
- Because you have
a fucking great marriage.

778
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:10,737
- You're with a fucking dick,

779
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,075
someone
who treats you like shit.

780
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:13,308
Why would you put up
with that?

781
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,576
- Really, why are you-

782
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,208
- Stop yelling at me.
- I'm yelling at you?

783
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,310
- Shut up!
- Get the fuck out of my face.

784
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,615
Get the fuck out of my house.

785
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,520
- Stop yelling at me.

786
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,759
- And then add
the last bits to it.

787
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:03,629
- Like a shoelace
that's tied

788
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,896
We're two ends
of a common thread

789
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:15,234
We have loved
till we cried

790
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:18,473
And spent
countless hours in bed

791
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:26,612
Sure as this song is sung

792
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:37,291
Know that you are the one

793
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,598
Is this humble pride

794
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:49,441
I am by your side

795
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,984
- So how do you
like this outfit?

796
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:03,491
- It's fitting.

797
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:05,618
It fits you.

798
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,826
Um, okay, all right.

799
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:11,866
Thank you.

800
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:12,900
- Okay, no problem.

801
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:14,094
Thank you.

802
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,354
- Sure.

803
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,289
- I used to go to a gym
in Melbourne,

804
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,419
and it was also
the gym that, like,

805
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,520
the big football team
in my area would go to.

806
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:42,859
- Uh-huh.

807
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:45,127
- And so my sister
and I would go, but, like,

808
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,032
we'd figure out
when training was,

809
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:50,072
because then the gym time
passed a lot quicker

810
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:53,973
if we could look out on the oval
and see all those people,

811
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:58,036
like, training for football.

812
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,080
Is that wrong?

813
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,377
- No, that's great.

814
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,042
Gym time should go faster.

815
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,088
- It really should.

816
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,424
- He doesn't want to talk to me.

817
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,425
- Well, he's probably mad.

818
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,580
Call it.

819
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,547
- Heads.

820
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:15,618
- It's tails.

821
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,844
You need another beer.

822
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,421
- Yes.

823
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:27,094
Okay.

824
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,858
I'm ready.

825
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,264
- Call it.

826
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,167
- Tails.

827
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:39,503
- Heads.

828
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:40,871
Ready?
- Ready.

829
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,212
- Call it.

830
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,340
- Tails.

831
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,382
- Ooh.

832
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:50,611
- I'm on an unlucky streak.

833
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,948
- Binge.

834
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,920
Call it.
Sorry.

835
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,320
Call it.

836
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,125
- Heads.

837
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:03,721
You ready?

838
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,434
Hear the sledges
with the bells.

839
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,905
Silver bells.

840
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,499
What a world of merriment
their melody foretells.

841
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,739
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
in the icy air of night.

842
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,543
While the stars that
over sprinkle all the heavens

843
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,016
seem to twinkle
with a crystalline delight,

844
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,816
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,

845
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,915
to the tintinnabulation
that so musically wells

846
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,891
from the bells,
bells, bells, bells,

847
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,326
bells, bells, bells,

848
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:36,830
from the jingling
and the tinkling of the bells.

849
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,629
Hear the mellow wedding bells,
golden bells.

850
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:42,637
What a world of happiness
their harmony foretells.

851
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,765
Through the balmy air of night,
how they ring out their delight.

852
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,742
From the molten golden notes,
and all in tune,

853
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:51,973
what a liquid ditty floats
to the turtledove that listens,

854
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:54,641
while she gloats on the moon.

855
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:56,309
Oh, from out the sounding cells,

856
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,887
what a gush of euphony
voluminously wells.

857
01:00:58,988 --> 01:00:59,920
How it swells.

858
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:01,957
How it dwells on the future.

859
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,583
How it tells of the rapture that
impels to the swinging

860
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,093
and the ringing

861
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:09,187
of the bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells, bells,

862
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,357
the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells,

863
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:15,528
to the rhyming
and the chiming of the bells.

864
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:19,199
Hear the loud alarum bells,
brazen bells.

865
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:22,471
What a tale of terror, now,
their turbulency tells.

866
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,239
In the startled ear of night,

867
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,373
how they scream out
their affright.

868
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,611
Too much horrified to speak,
they can only shriek, shriek,

869
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,417
out of tune,

870
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,652
in a clamorous appealing
to the mercy of the fire,

871
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,663
in a mad expostulation
with the deaf and frantic fire,

872
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,892
leaping higher, higher, higher.

873
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:57,135
Leaping higher, higher, higher
with a desperate desire,

874
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,874
and a resolute endeavor,
now, now to sit or never,

875
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:02,075
by the side
of the pale-faced moon.

876
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,016
Oh, the bells, bells, bells.

877
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,884
What a tale
their terror tells of despair.

878
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,287
How they clang
and crash and roar.

879
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,984
What a horror
they outpour on the bosom

880
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,959
of the palpitating air.

881
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,256
Yet the ear it fully knows

882
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,160
by the twanging
and the clanging,

883
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:17,789
how the danger ebbs and flows.

884
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,527
Yet the ear distinctly tells,

885
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,193
in the jangling
and the wrangling,

886
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:24,637
how the danger sinks and swells,
by the sinking or the swelling

887
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:28,142
in the anger of the bells, of
the bells, of the bells, bells,

888
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,735
bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells,

889
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:34,476
in the clamor
and the clangor of the bells.

890
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,382
Hear the trolling of the bells,
iron bells.

891
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:40,251
What a world of solemn thought
their melody compels.

892
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:43,416
In the silence of the night,
how we shiver with affright

893
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,858
at the melancholy menace
of their tone.

894
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,623
For every sound that floats
from the rust

895
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,789
within their throats is a groan.

896
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,958
And the people, ah, the people,
they that dwell up

897
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:53,797
in the steeple, all alone,

898
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,768
and who, tolling,
tolling, tolling,

899
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,271
in that muffled monotone,

900
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:00,900
feel a glory in so rolling on
a human heart of stone.

901
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,170
They are neither
man nor woman.

902
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,870
They are neither
brute nor human.

903
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,608
They are ghouls,
and their king it is who tolls;

904
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:09,310
and he rolls,
rolls, rolls, rolls, rolls,

905
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,215
a paean from the bells.

906
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,118
And his merry bosom swells
with the paean from the bells.

907
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:17,056
And he dances, and he yells,
keeping time, time, time,

908
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,219
in a sort of runic rhyme,
to the paean of the bells,

909
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,590
of the bells,

910
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,631
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,

911
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,496
to the throbbing of the bells.

912
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:28,126
Of the bells, bells, bells,
to the sobbing of the bells,

913
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:31,400
keeping time, time, time,
as he knells, knells, knells,

914
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:34,271
in a happy runic rhyme,
to the rolling of the bells.

915
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:35,901
Of the bells, bells, bells:

916
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,639
To the tolling
of the bells,

917
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:41,046
of the bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells, bells.

918
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,710
To the moaning
and the groaning of the bells.

919
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:57,031
- I'm very lucky.

920
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,302
- Do you like prosecco?

921
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,968
- Yes.

922
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:10,670
Yes, I do.

923
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,271
I go with the orange juice,
but I'll try it like this.

924
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,407
Anything's good on a boat.

925
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,815
Is that gonna be littering?

926
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:17,851
- Yep.

927
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:19,148
I'm gonna litter
with this cork,

928
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,883
but the cork is biodegradable,
so it's like-

929
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,425
I mean, it's a fucking plant.

930
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,290
- Hey.

931
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:31,928
What?

932
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,594
- Sleepy.
- Sleepy?

933
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:38,401
You don't want to fall asleep
and miss this.

934
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,338
- Then I can enjoy it
and be asleep at the same time.

935
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,172
- This is the best day I've had
in months, I swear.

936
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:43,210
- Really?

937
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,405
- This is the best day.

938
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,175
Yeah, it actually is.

939
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,911
This is actually one
of the best days I've ever had.

940
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:52,010
- It's pretty cool, right?

941
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:53,179
- Yeah.

942
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,018
- The first time
I went to Ethiopia,

943
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:57,991
a sort of fat
50-year-old woman passed me.

944
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,755
I was running on the street.

945
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:01,523
I felt really bad.

946
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,929
So I, like, I'm in pretty-
I, like, run a lot.

947
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,057
And then she just-

948
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,293
- But they're Ethiopian.

949
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,802
- Yeah, but she was like
an out-of-shape Ethiopian,

950
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,339
and she still passed me.

951
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,634
And she was 50.

952
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,039
- Can I put my hand on here
and drive?

953
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:15,201
I'm driving now.

954
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:16,403
- You're driving now.

955
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:18,241
Push it away from you
a little bit if you can.
