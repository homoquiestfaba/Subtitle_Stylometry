1
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:15,897
 Is to love rendering aen


2
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:18,691
 The World has changed...

3
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:20,234
 Han mathon ne nen

4
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:21,861
 I feel it in the water...

5
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:23,821
 Han mathon ne chae

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,115
 I feel it in the Earth...

7
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:28,493
 A han nostron ned wilith

8
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:31,162
 I smell it in the air...

9
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:34,707
 Much that once was is lost,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,502
 for none now live

11
00:00:37,794 --> 00:00:39,879


12
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:56,146
 It began with the forging 
 of the great Rings...

13
00:00:56,563 --> 00:01:02,277
 Three were given to the Elves
 inmortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

14
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:06,031
 Seven to the Dwarf Lords...

15
00:01:06,197 --> 00:01:09,951
 Great miners and craftsmen 
 of the mountain halls

16
00:01:10,577 --> 00:01:12,662
 And nine...

17
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:15,498
 Nine rings were gifted 
 to the race of Men...

18
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:19,127
 who above all else desire power

19
00:01:20,587 --> 00:01:26,843
 For within these Rings was bound 
 the strength and will to govern each race.

20
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:30,806
 But they were all of them deceived...

21
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:33,350
 for another ring was made

22
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:35,769
 in the Land of Mordor

23
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:38,063
 in the fires of Mount Doom

24
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:39,648
 The Dark Lord Sauron...

25
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:42,693
 forged in secret a Master Ring

26
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,778
 to control all others

27
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:52,619
 and into this ring he cored his cruelty, his malice,
 and his will to dominate all life...

28
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:57,708
 One Ring to rule them all.

29
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,461
 One by one,

30
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:04,715
 free lands of Middle Earth 
 fell to the Power of the Ring.

31
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:07,635
 But there were some

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,802
 who resisted...

33
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:13,933
 A last Alliance of Men and Elves 
 marched against the armys of Mordor...

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,727
 and on the slopes of Mount Doom

35
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:19,063
 they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth.

36
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:52,305
 Victory was near

37
00:02:56,184 --> 00:03:01,022
 but the power of the ring 
 could not be undone...

38
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,673
 It was in this moment...

39
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:29,300
 when all hope had faded...

40
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:34,389
 that Isildur, son of the King 
 took up his father's sword.

41
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:08,340
 "Sauron" 
 the enemy of the free peoples 
of Middle Earth

42
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,884
 was defeated

43
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,477
 The ring passed to Isildur,

44
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:25,566
 who has this one chance
 to destroy Evil forever

45
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:29,528
 but the hearts of the men 
are easily corrupted

46
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,656
 And the ring of the power...

47
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:36,744
 has a will of its own

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,920
 It betrayed Isildur,

49
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,464
 to his death

50
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:53,135
 And some things
that should not have been forgotten

51
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:55,888
 were lost

52
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,100
 History became legend...

53
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:02,103
 Legend became myth...

54
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:04,689
 and for 2,500 years

55
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:08,734
 the ring passed out of all knowledge.

56
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,653
 Until

57
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:13,072
 when chance came

58
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:16,200
 it ensnared a new bearer

59
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,580
 My precious... my own...

60
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:25,209
 The ring came to the creature Gollum,

61
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:29,339
 who took it deep into the tunnels 
 of The Misty Mountains,

62
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,841
 and there it consumed him

63
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:34,886
 It came to me, my own!

64
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:38,139
 My love, my precious!

65
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:51,236
 The ring brought Gollum 
 unnatural long life

66
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:53,071
 For 500 years

67
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:55,907
 it poisoned his mind,

68
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:08,837
 and in the gloom of Gollum's cave it waited. 
 Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

69
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:16,678
 Rumor grew of a shadow in the East,
 whispers of a nameless fear,
 and the Ring of Power perceived that its time had come

70
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:20,682
 It abbandoned Gollum

71
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,101
 but something happenned then

72
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:26,063
 the ring did not intend.

73
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,734
 It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable

74
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:35,906
 A Hobbit... Bilbo Baggins,

75
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:38,283
 of the Shire

76
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:42,663
 Lost!

77
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:47,501
 I lost my precious!

78
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:50,337
 For the time will soon come

79
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:54,717
 when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all

80
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:48,688
 You're late!

81
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:54,068
 A wizard is never late,

82
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:56,362
 Frodo Baggins,

83
00:07:56,571 --> 00:08:00,742
 nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.

84
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:14,589
 It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf

85
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:22,472
 You didn't think I'd miss 
 your Uncle Bilbo's birthday.

86
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,519
 What news of the outside world? 
 Tell me everything

87
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,564
 Everything? 
 You're far too eager and curious for a hobbit

88
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:34,359
 First and natural...

89
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,611
 Well, what can I tell you?

90
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:40,699
 Life in the wide world goes on, 
 much as it has this past age,

91
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,161
 full of its own comings and goings, scarcely aware

92
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:47,497
 of the existence of the Hobbits

93
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,667
 For which I am very grateful

94
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:12,981
 Ah... the long expected party...

95
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:20,656
 How is the old rascal?

96
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:24,410
 I hear it's going to be a party 
 of special magnificence

97
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:27,663
 You know Bilbo 
 He has the whole place in an uproar

98
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:30,708
 - That's a pleasant 
 - Half the Shire has been invited

99
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,668
 - Goodness 
 -He's up to something.

100
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:36,171
 All right, then keep your secrets

101
00:09:36,463 --> 00:09:38,674
 Before you came a long way, 
 Bagginses were very well thought of

102
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:42,469
 - Indeed 
 - Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected

103
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:45,723
 If you're referring to the incident with the dragon,

104
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:47,558
 I was barely evolved

105
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:52,188
 All I did was give your uncle 
 a little nudge out of the door

106
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:56,734
 Whatever you did 
 You've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace

107
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:15,795
 Gandalf, Gandalf!

108
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:19,924
 Fireworks!

109
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:24,178
 Gandalf! Gandalf! 
 Fireworks! Gandalf!

110
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,695
 Gandalf, I'm glad you're back

111
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:42,864
 So am I, dear boy

112
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:49,829
 So am I...

113
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:23,488
 No, thank you!

114
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:27,367
 We don't want any more visitors, 
 well-wishers or distant relations!

115
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:29,911
 And what about very old friends?

116
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,459
 Gandalf?

117
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,669
 Bilbo Baggins

118
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:40,088
 My dear Gandalf!

119
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:41,632
 Good to see you...

120
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:45,552
 One hundred eleven years old 
 Could you believe it?

121
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,389
 You haven't aged a day

122
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:57,815
 Come on, come in!

123
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:59,858
 Welcome, welcome!

124
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:07,908
 Tea? or maybe something a little stronger?

125
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:11,954
 I've got couple of bottles of the Old Winyards left 
 1926. Very good year!

126
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:15,124
 Almost as old as I am!

127
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:21,797
 It was laid down by my father 
 What say we open one?

128
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:23,841
 Just tea, thank you!

129
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:33,726
 I was expecting you last week,

130
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:35,436
 but you come and go as you please

131
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:37,480
 thus to be always

132
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:39,690
 I am afraid that badly I am prepared

133
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:41,484
 single we have chicken fried and cucumbers

134
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:44,278
 is a little cheese and 
 is not sufficient

135
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:47,907
 we have frambuesa jelly, apple pie

136
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:51,661
 but I am afraid that 
 are no great desserts we do not have sufficient

137
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,998
 I found a little spongy pie

138
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,504
 I can make you some eggs if you like... Gandalf?

139
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:06,843
 Just tea, thanks!

140
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:08,469
 Ah, right!

141
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:10,013
 You don't... if...

142
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:12,140
 No... not at all!

143
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:16,269
 I'm not at home!

144
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:19,397
 I've got to get away from 
 these confounded relatives!

145
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:21,066
 Hanging on the bell all day 
 never giving me a moment's peace!

146
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:25,654
 I want to see mountains again, mountains! Gandalf

147
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:29,449
 And then find somewhere quite 
 where I can finish my book.

148
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:30,575
 Oh! Tea!

149
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,661
 So you mean to go through with your plans?

150
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:33,578
 Yes, Yes!

151
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,122
 All the arrangements are made.

152
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,252
 Open it

153
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:45,799
 - Frodo suspects something! 
 - Of course he does! He's a Baggins!

154
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,719
 Not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle!

155
00:13:49,177 --> 00:13:51,888
 You will tell him, won't you?

156
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:53,807
 Yes, yes!

157
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:55,851
 He's very fond of you

158
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:59,187
 I know

159
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:04,109
 He'd probably come with me 
 if I asked him

160
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:08,572
 I think in his heart 
 Frodo's still in love with the Shire

161
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,620
 The woods... and fields... little rivers

162
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:22,753
 I'm old Gandalf!

163
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:27,549
 I know I don't look it, 
 but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart

164
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:33,597
 I feel thin!

165
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:39,270
 Sort of stretched like... 
 butter stretched over too much bread!

166
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:44,567
 I need a holiday!
 A very long holiday...

167
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:10,824
 And I don't expect I shall return

168
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,534
 In fact I mean not to.

169
00:14:55,786 --> 00:15:00,166
 The old toby, 
 the finest weed in the south farthing

170
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:22,397
 Gandalf my old friend 
 this will be a night to remember

171
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:48,673
 Fat Golberg, glad to see you

172
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:51,301
 welcome, welcome!

173
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:54,471
 Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance

174
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,059
 Uhmm... I think I'll just have another ale!

175
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:00,644
 No, you don't

176
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:03,480
 Go home

177
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:20,414
 So there I was...
 at the mercy of 3 monstrous Trolls

178
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:24,751
 And they were all arguing amongst themselves 
 about how they were going to cook us

179
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:31,008
 Whether they would mince us, or sit on us, 
 and squash us to jelly

180
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,054
 they spent so much time arguing that 
 how and because

181
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:38,849
 And they spent so much time arguing, 
 that sunlight crept over the top of the trees...

182
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,768
 And turned them all to stone!

183
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:47,858
 Quick!

184
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,783
 Oh! Off we go!

185
00:16:56,992 --> 00:16:59,536
 No, no! The big one, big one!

186
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:10,840
 - Done!
- Ypu're supposed to stick it in the ground!

187
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:11,841
 - It is in the ground!

188
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,342
 - Outside 
- That was your idea!

189
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:35,031
 Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

190
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:36,449
 Dragon?

191
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:39,202
 Nonsense, there hasn't been a dragon
  in these parts for a thousand years!

192
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:55,218
 - That was good 
 - Let's get another one!

193
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:01,808
 Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took

194
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,852
 I might have known

195
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:14,362
 Speech, Bilbo! Speech!

196
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:18,158
 Speech!

197
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:23,038
 My dear Bagginses, and Boffins...

198
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,874
 Tooks and Brandybucks

199
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:28,501
 Grubbs! Chubbs!

200
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:32,339
 Hornblowers! Bolgers!

201
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:36,343
 Bracegirdles! Proudfoots!

202
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:38,053
 Proudfeet!

203
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:43,058
 Today is my 111 birthday!

204
00:18:44,768 --> 00:18:46,228
 Happy Birthday!

205
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:52,025
 Alas. Eleventy-one years 
 is far too short a time 
 to live among such excellent,

206
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:53,652
 admirable Hobbits!

207
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:55,946
 I don't like

208
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,824
 half of you half as well as I should like,
 and I like

209
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:01,076
 less than half of you half as well as you deserve.

210
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:14,173
 I have things to do...

211
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,307
 I've put this off far too long

212
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,063
 I regret to announce this is the end!

213
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:33,651
 I'm going now

214
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:37,154
 I bid you all a very fond farewell

215
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:41,492
 Good bye!

216
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:18,571
 - I suppose you think that was terribly clever
 - Come on, Gandalf!

217
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,615
 Did you see their faces?

218
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:26,329
 There are many magic rings in this world, Bilbo Baggins 
 and none of them should be used like that!

219
00:20:26,204 --> 00:20:31,292
 It was just a bit of fun! 
 Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

220
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:35,463
 You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

221
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:39,342
 Two eyes, as often as I can spare them

222
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:41,845
 I'm leaving everything to him

223
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:45,348
 And what about this ring of yours?
 Is that staying too?

224
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,641
 Yes, Yes!

225
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:49,894
 Take an envelope over there, on the mantlepiece

226
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:55,525
 No... wait it's...

227
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,446
 here in my pocket...

228
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:07,078
 Why... isn't that... isn't that odd, now

229
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:13,126
 Yes, after all, why not

230
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:17,089
 Why shouldn't I keep it?

231
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:19,925
 I think you should leave the ring behind, Bilbo

232
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:22,260
 Is that so hard?

233
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:24,054
 Well, no...

234
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,849
 and yes!

235
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:32,688
 Now it comes to it

236
00:21:32,646 --> 00:21:35,107
 I don't feel like parting with it, it's mine! 
 I found it! It came to me!

237
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:38,318
 - There's no need to get angry
 - Well if I'm angry, it's your fault!

238
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:41,488
 It's mine!

239
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:44,408
 My own

240
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,162
 My precious

241
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:52,750
 Precious? It's been call that before

242
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,375
 But not by you

243
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,169
 Oh, what business is it of yours 
 what I do with my own things!

244
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:57,588
 I think that you have that ring quite long enough!

245
00:21:59,006 --> 00:21:59,590
 You want it for yourself!

246
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:05,846
 BILBO BAGGINS!! Do not take me for 
 some conjuror of cheap tricks!

247
00:22:06,388 --> 00:22:08,808
 I'm not trying to rob you!

248
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:16,941
 I'm trying to help you

249
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:28,619
 All your long years, we've been friends

250
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:31,539
 Trust me, as you once did

251
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,876
 Let it go!

252
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:37,462
 You're right, Gandalf

253
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:42,175
 The ring must go to Frodo.

254
00:22:44,886 --> 00:22:46,846
 It's late 
 The road is long

255
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,639
 Yes, it is time

256
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:54,270
 Bilbo,

257
00:22:55,772 --> 00:22:58,107
 the ring is still in your pocket

258
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:34,644
 I've thought of an ending for my book:

259
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,816
 And he lived happily ever after,

260
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:42,194
 to the end of his days.

261
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:44,696
 And I am sure you will, my dear friend

262
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:48,367
 Good bye, Gandalf

263
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:53,288
 Good bye, dear Bilbo

264
00:24:08,178 --> 00:24:10,514
 Until our next meeting...

265
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:39,919
 It's mine... my own...

266
00:24:40,586 --> 00:24:44,215
 my precious...

267
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:48,094
 Riddles in the dark.

268
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,068
 He's gone, hasn't he?

269
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:12,869
 He talked for so long about leaving 
 I didn't think he'd really do it.

270
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:29,844
 Bilbo's ring

271
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:32,305
 He's gone to stay with the Elves

272
00:25:33,306 --> 00:25:35,099
 He's left you Bag End

273
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,439
 Along with all his possessions

274
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,275
 The ring is yours now

275
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:49,447
 Put it somewhere out of sight

276
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:52,701
 - Where are you going?
 - There are some things that I must see to

277
00:25:52,993 --> 00:25:54,869
 - What things?
 - Questions...

278
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,038
 Questions that need answering

279
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,333
 But if you've only just arrived!
I don't understand

280
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,465
 Neither do I

281
00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:12,763
 Keep it secret 
 Keep it safe

282
00:26:46,797 --> 00:26:48,048
 Shire!

283
00:26:51,385 --> 00:26:52,636
 Baggins!

284
00:27:43,146 --> 00:27:48,568
 Year 3434 of the Second Age... 
 here follows the account of Isildur...

285
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:53,281
 high King of Gondor 
 and the finding of the Ring of Power

286
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,747
 It has come to me, the One Ring

287
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:03,374
 which shall be an heirloom of my kingdom

288
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:06,294
 All that will follow in my bloodline 
 shall be bound to its fate

289
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:10,006
 for I shall risk no hurt to the ring!

290
00:28:11,174 --> 00:28:13,218
 It is precious to me...

291
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:17,055
 though I abide with a great pain

292
00:28:19,391 --> 00:28:22,936
 Markings upon the band begin to fade

293
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:27,983
 The writing wich at first was as clear

294
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:29,651
 as red flame, has all but disappeared

295
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:33,405
 a secret now that only fire can tell

296
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,217
 Shire!

297
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:56,303
 Baggins!

298
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,596
 It's no Baggins around here!

299
00:28:57,596 --> 00:28:59,556
 They're up in Hobbiton

300
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,643
 That way!

301
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,101
 Is it secret?
 Is it safe?

302
00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:54,654
 What are you doing?

303
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:11,170
 Hold out your hand, Frodo!

304
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:12,005
 It's quite cool

305
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:16,175
 What can you see?

306
00:30:18,595 --> 00:30:19,929
 Can you see anything?

307
00:30:23,182 --> 00:30:24,767
 Nothing!

308
00:30:24,976 --> 00:30:27,270
 There's nothing!

309
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:30,398
 Wait...

310
00:30:34,402 --> 00:30:35,737
 There are markings

311
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:40,742
 It's some form of elvish, I can't read it

312
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:43,161
 There are few who can

313
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:48,667
 The language is that of Mordor, 
wich I will not utter here!

314
00:30:50,377 --> 00:30:51,211
 Mordor...

315
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:56,800
 In the common tongue it says:
 "One ring to rule them all

316
00:30:57,384 --> 00:30:59,302
 One ring to find them

317
00:31:00,178 --> 00:31:02,264
 One ring to bring them all

318
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:05,726
 and in the darkness, bind them!"

319
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:11,565
 This is the One Ring, 
forged by the Dark Lord, Sauron...

320
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,693
 in the fires of Mount Doom...

321
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:18,572
 taken by Isildur, from the hand of Sauron himself!

322
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,578
 Bilbo found it... in Gollum's cave

323
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:29,792
 Yes... for 60 years the ring layed quite...

324
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:33,170
 in Bilbo's keeping... 
prolonging his life... 
delaying old age...

325
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:35,214
 but no longer Frodo

326
00:31:35,381 --> 00:31:38,300
 Evil is stirring in Mordor

327
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:43,973
 the ring has woken, 
it's heard its Master's call

328
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:47,893
 But he was destroyed!
Sauron was destroyed!

329
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,150
 No, Frodo

330
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,780
 The spirit of Sauron endured

331
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,491
 His life force is bounded to the ring,

332
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:04,368
 and the ring survived

333
00:32:04,994 --> 00:32:10,583
 Sauron has returned, 
his orcs have multiplied...

334
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:14,545
 His fortress of Barad-Dur is rebuilt
in the land of Mordor

335
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:19,842
 Sauron needs only this ring 
to cover all the lands on a second darkness!

336
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:23,137
 He is seeking it,

337
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:25,765
 all his thought is bent on it

338
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:32,522
 The ring yearns above all else 
 to return to the hand of its master

339
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,273
 They are one,

340
00:32:34,982 --> 00:32:37,694
 the ring and the dark lord

341
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:41,864
 Frodo! 
 He must never find it!

342
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,701
 All right! we put it away

343
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:47,245
 We keep it hidden, we never speak of it again

344
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:49,706
 No one knows it's here... do they?

345
00:32:55,795 --> 00:32:57,881
 Do they, Gandalf?

346
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,343
 There is one other who knew 
 that Bilbo had the ring!

347
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:05,847
 I've looked everywhere for the creature Gollum,

348
00:33:06,556 --> 00:33:08,433
 but the enemy found him first!

349
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:12,562
 I don't know how long they tortured him for

350
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:17,692
 But amidst the endless screams and the babble, 
 they discerned two words:

351
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,950
 Shire!
 Baggins!

352
00:33:25,408 --> 00:33:26,952
 That will lead them here!

353
00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:30,330
 Who goes there!

354
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:34,292
 Take it, Gandalf! 
 Take it!

355
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:36,294
 - No, Frodo!
 - You must take it!

356
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:38,922
 - You can not offer me this ring! 
 I'm giving it to you!

357
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,133
 DON'T... tempt me, Frodo!

358
00:33:42,175 --> 00:33:43,719
 I dare not take it,

359
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:46,680
 not even to keep it safe!

360
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,309
 Understand Frodo...

361
00:33:51,184 --> 00:33:54,521
 I would use this ring from a desire to do good

362
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:06,075
 But through me, it would wield a power 
 too great and terrible to imagine

363
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:07,826
 But it cannot stay in the Shire!

364
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:09,036
 No!

365
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:12,748
 No, it can't!

366
00:34:18,212 --> 00:34:19,880
 What must I do?

367
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:24,051
 You must leave. And leave quickly

368
00:34:24,009 --> 00:34:25,469
 Where? Where do I go?

369
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:28,097
 Get out of the Shire. Head for the village of Bree

370
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:35,271
 - Bree... What about you? 
 - I'll be waiting for you 
 at the Inn of the Prancing Pony

371
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:37,231
 And the ring will be safe there?

372
00:34:37,189 --> 00:34:41,110
 I don't know Frodo 
 I don't have any answers

373
00:34:42,987 --> 00:34:46,616
 I must see the head of my order 
 He's both wise and powerful

374
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:49,994
 Trust me Frodo, he'll know what to do!

375
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:57,710
 You'll have to leave the name of Baggins 
 behind you, for the name is not safe outside the Shire

376
00:34:58,002 --> 00:35:01,422
 Travel only by day, and stay off the road!

377
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:04,008
 I can cut across countries easily enough

378
00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:09,180
 My dear Frodo...

379
00:35:09,263 --> 00:35:11,766
 Hobbits really aren't basic creatures!

380
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,603
 You can learn all there is to know 
 about their ways in a month,

381
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,566
 and yet after a hundred years, 
 they can still surprise you

382
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:23,862
 Get down!

383
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:38,710
 Confounded old, Samwise Gamgee! 
 Have you been eavesdropping?

384
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:40,295
 I haven't dropped no eaves, sir, honest

385
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:43,548
 I was just cutting the grass under 
 the window there, if you follow me

386
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,301
 A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

387
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:50,680
 I heard raised voices!
What did you hear? SPEAK!!

388
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:52,682
 N-n-n-nothing important! 
 That is I heard a great deal about a ring,

389
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:57,229
 dark lord, and something about the 
 end of the world, but, please Mr. Gandalf,
 sir, please don't hurt me

390
00:35:57,187 --> 00:36:00,065
 Don't turn me into anything... unnatural 


391
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:01,858
 No?

392
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,653
 Perhaps not

393
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:08,073
 I've thought of a better use for you

394
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:13,829
 Come along, Samwise, keep up

395
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,416
 Be careful, both of you

396
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:21,128
 The enemy has many spies in his service

397
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:23,714
 Birds, beasts...

398
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,675
 Is it safe?

399
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:33,932
 Never put it on. For the agent of 
 the Dark lord will be drawn to its power

400
00:36:34,183 --> 00:36:39,521
 Always remember, Frodo. 
 The ring is trying to get back to its master

401
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:42,358
 It wants to be found

402
00:37:22,398 --> 00:37:23,858
 This is it

403
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:26,652
 This is that?

404
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:33,034
 If I take one more step, 
 it'll be the farthest away from home 
 I've ever been

405
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:40,291
 Come on, Sam

406
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:53,054
 You remember what Bilbo used to say? 
 It's a dangerous business,

407
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:56,266
 Frodo, going out your door. You step out onto the road,

408
00:37:57,016 --> 00:38:02,313
 and if you don't keep your feet, there's 
 no knowing where you might be swept off to

409
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:32,719
 Smoke rises from the mountain of Doom, 
 and the hour grows late,

410
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:36,306
 and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my council

411
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,684
 seeking my council

412
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:42,729
 For that is why you have come, is it not?

413
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:46,275
 - My old friend... 
 - Saruman!

414
00:38:50,779 --> 00:38:54,324
 You are sure of this? 
 Beyond any doubt

415
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:57,870
 So the ring of power has been found

416
00:38:57,786 --> 00:39:02,374
 All these long years, it was in the Shire, 
 under my very nose

417
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,626
 Yet you did not have the wits to see it

418
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:09,673
 Your love of the Halflings' leaf 
 has clearly slowed your mind

419
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:13,552
 ... enough time. Time to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

420
00:39:13,802 --> 00:39:14,637
 Time?

421
00:39:16,597 --> 00:39:19,099
 What time you think that we have?

422
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,270
 Sauron has regained much of his former strength

423
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:29,235
 He cannot yet take physical form, 
 but his spirit has lost none of its potency

424
00:40:42,183 --> 00:40:47,606
 Concealed within his fortress, 
 the Lord of Mordor sees all

425
00:39:35,658 --> 00:39:40,204
 His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh

426
00:39:42,832 --> 00:39:45,710
 You know of what I speak, Gandalf

427
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:52,425
 A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame

428
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:57,555
 - The eye of Sauron 
 He is gathering all evil to him

429
00:39:57,805 --> 00:40:02,602
 Very soon he will summon an army great enough 
 to launch an assault upon Middle Earth

430
00:40:02,977 --> 00:40:04,562
 You know all this?

431
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:06,773
 How?

432
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:13,279
 - I have seen it 
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman

433
00:40:13,404 --> 00:40:14,656
 Why?

434
00:40:15,406 --> 00:40:18,326
 Why should we fear to use it?

435
00:40:21,204 --> 00:40:25,208
 They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing stones

436
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:28,336
 You do not know who else may be watching

437
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:33,758
 The hour is later than you think

438
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,720
 Sauron's forces are already moving

439
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:41,308
 The nine have left Mordor

440
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:42,851
 The nine?

441
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:49,191
 They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's 
 eve, disguised as riders in black

442
00:40:48,982 --> 00:40:58,075
 They've reached the Shire 
 They will find the ring, and kill the one that carries it

443
00:40:57,741 --> 00:40:58,825
 Frodo!

444
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:15,801
 You do not seriously think that a hobbit 
 could contend with the will of Sauron?

445
00:41:16,593 --> 00:41:18,762
 There are none who can

446
00:41:22,015 --> 00:41:26,729
 Against the power of Mordor, there can be no victory

447
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:32,359
 We must join with him, Gandalf

448
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:36,196
 We must join with Sauron

449
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:59,197
 It would be wise, my friend

450
00:41:41,994 --> 00:41:45,539
 Tell me, friend...

451
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:49,960
 When did Saruman the wise 
 abandon reason for madness?

452
00:42:30,334 --> 00:42:32,253
 I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly,

453
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:40,094
 but you have elected a way of paying!

454
00:44:24,116 --> 00:44:25,785
 Mr. Frodo! Frodo!

455
00:43:08,582 --> 00:43:10,625
 - I thought I'd lost you 
 - What are you talking about?

456
00:43:11,585 --> 00:43:14,838
 - It's just something Gandalf said 
 what did he say?

457
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,593
 "Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee" 
 And I don't mean to

458
00:43:19,801 --> 00:43:22,304
 Sam, we're still in the Shire. 
 What could possibly happen?

459
00:43:26,641 --> 00:43:29,227
 Frodo! Merry... It's Frodo Baggins!

460
00:43:29,144 --> 00:43:31,396
 - Hello Frodo!
 - Get of him!

461
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:33,065
 What's the meaning of this?

462
00:43:33,398 --> 00:43:34,650
 Hold these

463
00:43:34,983 --> 00:43:37,819
 You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop

464
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,699
 Hey! You get back here!... 
 You get out of my fields

465
00:43:47,412 --> 00:43:49,498
 I don't know why he's so upset

466
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:51,959
 It's only a couple of carrots 
 And some cabbages

467
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:54,920
 And then those empty bags of potatoes we left in last week

468
00:43:55,421 --> 00:43:57,256
 And then, the mushrooms, the week before!

469
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:00,926
 Yes, Pippin, my point is, 
 he's clearly over reacting

470
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:02,636
 Run!

471
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:18,235
 Ahhh. Ohhh

472
00:44:20,613 --> 00:44:22,323
 I think I've broken something

473
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,327
 Trust a Brandybuck and a Took

474
00:44:27,286 --> 00:44:30,623
 What? It was just a detour. A shortcut

475
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:31,832
 A shortcut to what?

476
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:33,584
 Mushrooms!!

477
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:42,677
 that is mine!

478
00:44:42,635 --> 00:44:44,679
 that is precious!

479
00:44:48,641 --> 00:44:50,768
 is one good Sam here!

480
00:44:50,726 --> 00:44:51,978
 I think we should get off the road

481
00:45:01,988 --> 00:45:03,656
 Get off the road!

482
00:45:03,656 --> 00:45:04,657
 QUICK!

483
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:14,792
 Silence!

484
00:46:25,197 --> 00:46:26,657
 What was that?

485
00:47:00,608 --> 00:47:01,651
 See anything?

486
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:03,444
 Nothing!

487
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:06,405
 What's going on?

488
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:13,454
 That black rider was looking for something.
 Or someone... Frodo?

489
00:47:14,413 --> 00:47:15,456
 Get down!

490
00:47:32,598 --> 00:47:34,475
 I have to leave the Shire

491
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,520
 Sam and I must get to Bree

492
00:47:38,396 --> 00:47:39,439
 Right!

493
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:51,201
 Right... Buckleberry Ferry. Follow me.

494
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:53,078
 Hurry!

495
00:47:53,995 --> 00:47:55,789
 Follow me!

496
00:47:59,584 --> 00:48:01,044
 Run!

497
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,892
 Get the boats out!

498
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,521
 Frodo!

499
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,233
 Go!

500
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,234
 Hurry!

501
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:26,069
 Run!

502
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,741
 Jump Frodo!
... We go!

503
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,967
 How far to the nearest crossing?
 The brandywine bridge. Twenty miles

504
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,206
 What do you want?
 We're heading for the prancing pony

505
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:27,465
 Hobbits. Four hobbits! 
 What business brings you to Bree?

506
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:30,760
 We wish to stay at the inn. 
 Our business is our own

507
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,221
 Alright, young sir, I meant no offence

508
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:39,644
 It's my job to ask questions after nightfall. 
 There's talk of strange folk abroad

509
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,646
 Can't be too careful

510
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:30,654
 Excuse me

511
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:33,907
 Good evening, little masters!

512
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:40,705
 If you're seeking accommodation, 
 we've got some nice cosy, 
 hobbit sized rooms available... Mr...

513
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:44,584
 Underhill. My name's Underhill

514
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:49,840
 - Underhill... 
 - We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. 
 Can you tell him we've arrived?

515
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:51,383
 Gandalf?

516
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,764
 Oh, yes!
... I remember

517
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:02,185
 Elderly chap. Big grey beard, and pointy hat

518
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,895
 Not seen him for 6 months

519
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:11,069
 What do we do now?

520
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:23,165
 Sam, he'll be here. He'll come

521
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,839
 What's that?

522
00:51:31,215 --> 00:51:33,676
 This, my friend, is a pint!

523
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:37,137
 It comes in pints? 
 I'm getting one

524
00:51:37,596 --> 00:51:39,056
 You... already?

525
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:49,525
 That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived

526
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:59,744
 Excuse me. 
 That man in the corner. Who is he?

527
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:05,583
 He's one of them rangers. 
 Dangerous folk, they are, wandering in the wilds

528
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:10,546
 What his right name is, I've never heard, 
 but around here, he's known as Strider

529
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,050
 Strider

530
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:47,834
 Baggins?

531
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:50,295
 Sure I know a Baggins

532
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:52,797
 He's over there, Frodo Baggins!

533
00:52:53,214 --> 00:52:56,551
 He's my second cousin once 
 removed on his mother's side and...

534
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:58,428
 and my cousin third quite distant...

535
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,852
 Steady!

536
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,426
 You cannot hide

537
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,889
 I see you

538
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:02,493
 You draw far too much attention to yourself

539
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:04,119
 Mr. Underhill

540
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,668
 What do you want?

541
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:14,296
 - There is sort of trinket you carry 
 - I carry nothing!

542
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,176
 Indeed. I can avoid 
 being seen if I wish

543
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:22,596
 But to dissapear entirely. 
 That is a rare gift

544
00:54:23,389 --> 00:54:24,432
 Who are you?

545
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:17,171
 Are you frightened?

546
00:54:27,018 --> 00:54:28,269
 Yes

547
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:31,522
 Not nearly frightened enough. 
 I know what hunts you

548
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:39,155
 Let him or I it will hurt, Strider!

549
00:54:40,615 --> 00:54:42,492
 You have a stout heart for a hobbit

550
00:54:43,785 --> 00:54:47,121
 But that will not save you 
 You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo

551
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:49,082
 They're coming

552
00:56:10,998 --> 00:56:12,666
 What are they?

553
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:18,922
 They were once men. 
 Great kings of men

554
00:56:19,423 --> 00:56:23,177
 Then Sauron the deceiver gave to them 9 rings of power

555
00:56:23,385 --> 00:56:26,889
 Blinded by their greed, they took them without questioning,

556
00:56:26,805 --> 00:56:29,808
 one by one, falling to darkness

557
00:56:30,351 --> 00:56:32,853
 Now they are slaves to his will

558
00:56:34,396 --> 00:56:40,402
 They are the Nazgul. Ring wraiths. 
 Neither living nor dead

559
00:56:40,611 --> 00:56:43,989
 At all times they feel the presence of the ring

560
00:56:44,407 --> 00:56:46,283
 Drawn to the power of the One

561
00:56:46,784 --> 00:56:49,286
 They will never stop hunting you

562
00:56:58,588 --> 00:57:00,047
 Where are you taking us?

563
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:01,549
 Into the wild

564
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:08,347
 How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?

565
00:57:10,016 --> 00:57:11,893
 We have no choice but to trust him

566
00:57:12,602 --> 00:57:14,061
 But where is he leading us?

567
00:57:14,604 --> 00:57:17,315
 To Rivendell, Master Gamgee, to the House of Elrond

568
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:21,944
 Did you hear that? Rivendell 
 We're going to see the elves

569
00:57:40,588 --> 00:57:43,925
 Gentlemen 
 We do not stop 'til nightfall

570
00:57:44,217 --> 00:57:46,720
 - What about breakfast? 
 - You've already had it

571
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:49,723
 We've had one, yes 
 What about second breakfast?

572
00:57:54,019 --> 00:57:55,687
 Don't think he knows about 
 second breakfast, Pippin

573
00:57:57,272 --> 00:58:00,734
 What about elevensies? Luncheon 
 Afternoon tea

574
00:58:01,192 --> 00:58:04,446
 Dinner? Supper. 
 He knows about them. Doesn't he?

575
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:06,281
 Pippin!

576
00:58:17,209 --> 00:58:21,546
 The power of Isengard is at your command,

577
00:58:21,588 --> 00:58:24,925
 Sauron, Lord of the Earth

578
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:42,735
 What orders from Mordor, my lord?

579
00:58:43,402 --> 00:58:47,531
 - What does the eye command?
 - We have work to do!

580
00:59:29,907 --> 00:59:34,579
 The trees are strong, my lord 
 The roots go deep

581
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:37,081
 Rip them all down!

582
01:00:00,188 --> 01:00:07,153
 This was the great watchtower of Amon Hen

583
01:00:09,197 --> 01:00:10,448
 We will rest here tonight

584
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:26,590
 These are for you, keep them close!

585
01:00:27,215 --> 01:00:28,675
 I'm going to take a look!

586
01:00:31,803 --> 01:00:32,637
 Wait here

587
01:00:39,811 --> 01:00:41,897
 You want a tomato?

588
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:44,316
 What is doing?

589
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:47,944
 Tomatos, Sausages, golden bacon, 
 We kept a little to you

590
01:00:48,195 --> 01:00:51,114
 - Stifle this, stupids!
 - Look at that, ash-gray in my tomatos!

591
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:03,252
 Go!

592
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:58,683
 Back you devils!

593
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:23,060
 Frodo!

594
01:04:06,604 --> 01:04:07,855
 Strider!

595
01:04:09,815 --> 01:04:11,067
 Help him Strider!

596
01:04:11,817 --> 01:04:14,737
 He has been stabbed by a Morgul blade

597
01:04:17,406 --> 01:04:20,952
 This is beyond my skill 
 He needs elvish medicine

598
01:04:26,624 --> 01:04:27,750
 Hurry! We're 6 days from Rivendel 
 He'll never make it!

599
01:04:31,796 --> 01:04:33,589
 Frodo, Frodo!

600
01:04:34,215 --> 01:04:35,925
 Gandalf!

601
01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:10,790
 Mr. Frodo!?
 He's going cold!

602
01:07:13,418 --> 01:07:14,669
 Is he going to die?

603
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,297
 He's passing into the shadow

604
01:07:17,422 --> 01:07:19,090
 He'll soon become a wraith like them

605
01:07:25,013 --> 01:07:25,847
 They're close!

606
01:07:26,598 --> 01:07:32,437
 - Sam, do you know the athalus plant?
 - Athalus? 
 - Kingsfoil

607
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:35,106
 - Kingsfoil, that's a weed 
 - It may help to slow the poison. Hurry

608
01:07:49,788 --> 01:07:53,416
 What's this, a ranger, caught off his guard?

609
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:20,277
 Frodo!

610
01:08:21,612 --> 01:08:24,948
 I am Arwen 
 I've come to help you

611
01:08:26,617 --> 01:08:31,705
 Hear my voice 
 Come back into the light

612
01:08:36,627 --> 01:08:37,836
 Who is she?

613
01:08:40,589 --> 01:08:42,424
 She is an elf!

614
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:43,842
 He's fading

615
01:08:46,595 --> 01:08:48,597
 He's not going to last

616
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:50,849
 We must get him to my father

617
01:08:52,601 --> 01:08:55,104
 - I've been looking for you for 2 days
 - Where are you taking him?

618
01:08:55,813 --> 01:09:00,776
 There are 5 wraiths behind you 
 Where the other four are I do not know.

619
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:04,697
 Stay with the hobbits 
 I'll send horses for you.

620
01:09:05,406 --> 01:09:09,618
 I'm the faster rider 
 I'll take him

621
01:09:09,493 --> 01:09:10,995
 What are they saying?

622
01:09:10,953 --> 01:09:15,791
 If I can get him across the river 
 the power of my people will protect him

623
01:09:16,626 --> 01:09:18,711
 I do not fear them

624
01:09:30,223 --> 01:09:32,475
 Ride hard, don't look back

625
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:41,401
 What are you doing! 
 Those riders are still out there!
