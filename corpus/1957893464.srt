1
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:16,600
You have got to be kidding me.

2
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:17,734
Ghosts?

3
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,033
It's exciting, right?

4
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,200
I'm Katherine, ghost
of Christmas Present.

5
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,333
This is Arlene.

6
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:25,767
She's...

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,900
Past.

8
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:28,367
And this is...

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,600
Lovely to meet you.

10
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:32,233
I'm Roy, Ghost of
Christmas Future.

11
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,033
Well, ah-ha, yes.

12
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,033
And I am calling the cops.

13
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,367
Ah, they won't be able to see
us, so that could be awkward.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,367
You think I was born yesterday?

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,600
Oh.

16
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:44,876
Trust me, you're
going to need those.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,400
Oh, this isn't happening.

18
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:48,200
This isn't happening.

19
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,166
But it is.

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,000
OK.

21
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:57,400
I know that you folks are fake
because I have read the book,

22
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:00,834
and this is supposed to
happen on Christmas Eve.

23
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:03,266
Used to, but it didn't
leave people enough time

24
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,066
to buy a Christmas goose, save
a family, make things right.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,300
So they moved it up to the 23rd.

26
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:10,934
OK.

27
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:11,467
All right.

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,300
All right.

29
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:13,967
Well, this is crazy.

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,734
This is cray... no one
is going to believe me.

31
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:19,987
Oh, you're not going to tell
anyone because you're not

32
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:21,500
going to think it was real.

33
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,934
Tomorrow morning, all you'll
be left with is the feeling.

34
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,300
What feeling?

35
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:27,100
You're telling me
you read the book

36
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:30,300
but forgot the part
about Christmas spirit?

37
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:34,467
Susan, your music is fabulous.

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,300
"Don't You Want to Be
My Christmas Angel,"

39
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,900
it's one of my
all-time favorites.

40
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,467
Thank you.

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,242
You brought so many people
so much holiday cheer,

42
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:45,934
but I'm afraid over the years,
you've lost all of yours.

43
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:48,433
Let's say we get it
back again, shall we?

44
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,667
That's my cue.

45
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,834
You and me, sister?

46
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,166
What is the...

47
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
It never gets old.

48
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,667
Merry Christmas to all.

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,233
Hello!

50
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:05,367
Be quiet!

51
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,576
Hello, my wonderful neighbors.

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,133
Hey, I'm trying to
sleep over here.

53
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,133
Keep it down.

54
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,800
Merry Christmas to everyone!

55
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:14,200
Oh, would you look at that snow?

56
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,667
What was our time?

57
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,900
3 hours 37 minutes
and 14 seconds.

58
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,633
That's a near record.

59
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:24,967
All right, there's a
Martini calling my name.

60
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,734
You guys go, OK?

61
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll catch up.

62
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:31,066
I haven't been back to
Hartford since... you know?

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I just can't pass up the
chance to see it again.

64
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,033
Well, things have
changed, my dear.

65
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,967
It won't be the same
town you remember.

66
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,433
I know.

67
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:39,567
But still...

68
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,867
Well, don't mess anything up.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,533
How can I possibly
mess anything up?

70
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:45,000
It's not like anyone can see me.

71
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,367
I will meet you in the Great
Hall well before sunrise.

72
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,633
I have no interest in
getting myself snapped back.

73
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,066
Oh, I hate that feeling.

74
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,367
Go.

75
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,734
Have an extra Martini for me.

76
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:55,867
All right.

77
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,166
Hm.

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,133
Everything you need for
a Christmas Eve dinner.

79
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,967
Who are you looking for?

80
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,433
We're searching all our
lives, but all I really want.

81
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,567
Dance, just want you...

82
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,200
Hi.

83
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,333
Can I help you?

84
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,767
Yep, you.

85
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,867
Sorry, you look very familiar.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,133
Do I know you?

87
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:55,867
No.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,533
I think so.

89
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,667
Where do I know you from?

90
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,600
No, you don't.

91
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:03,600
OK.

92
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:05,934
Well, great conversation.

93
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,100
Look, I don't really
mind, but if somebody

94
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,333
were to catch you in here...

95
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:10,700
Sorry.

96
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:15,166
I just... I was in the
neighborhood, and well,

97
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,433
I used to come here a
lot, so I wanted to...

98
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,367
Really?

99
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,276
The Rootie Tootie has been
closed since before I was born,

100
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,900
but I think you're thinking
maybe the Frog Hollow Angel,

101
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,567
did you used to volunteer there?

102
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,033
The Frog Hollow Angel?

103
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,943
It was a little community
center across the road.

104
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,166
It was the blue building.

105
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,667
Yeah.

106
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,233
Yes.

107
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,033
Yes, I did.

108
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:36,934
That's it.

109
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,276
That's where I
recognize you from.

110
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,667
Yeah.

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,360
My grandparents
actually ran that place.

112
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, I saw your set up outside.

113
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:45,467
It's nothing.

114
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,934
It's great.

115
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,667
Thank you, but it
just kind of makes

116
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,600
me feel like they're
still here, you know?

117
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:54,867
And everybody deserves a
warm meal at Christmas.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,567
But I'm actually just
breaking it down, so...

119
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,133
Oh, you store your
stuff in here?

120
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:00,834
I do.

121
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:02,800
My family owns this place.

122
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:05,467
We kind of own the whole block.

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
No, that's so lame.

124
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,133
I'm so sorry.

125
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,242
That sounded really terrible
coming out of my mouth.

126
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,266
Wow, I'm so sorry.

127
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,667
Not a lot of people know about
my hobby across the street,

128
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,300
so if you could just keep that...

129
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,567
Mum's the word.

130
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,400
Your secret is
very safe with me.

131
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,066
Very, very, very safe.

132
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,033
Good.

133
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,900
Just not really
aboveboard, and we've

134
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,767
got to get it in
before daylight.

135
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,734
Oh, wow, I lost track of time.

136
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,266
Well, I have to go.

137
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,767
Oh, OK.

138
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,133
Actually, let me deal
with this quickly.

139
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:39,600
Great.

140
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,734
Dealt with.

141
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,867
And if I could get your...

142
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:01,967
Hey, how'd it go at the center?

143
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,533
You bet.

144
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,800
Hi.

145
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:05,633
I heard you had a good one.

146
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:06,800
I want to hear about it.

147
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:08,400
Yeah, how do you like it?

148
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,533
Oh, hi.

149
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,300
There you two are.

150
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,834
So how were the sites?

151
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,667
Honestly, it was a bit strange.

152
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,343
I was walking around
my old neighborhood,

153
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,166
you know, just
having a look, and...

154
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,033
You were right, Roy.

155
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,400
Everything is different now.

156
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,834
Well, you'll be happy
to know I had not one,

157
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,367
but two Martinis for you.

158
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,066
That's what I like to hear.

159
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Let's hit it.

160
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,567
How would you ever know
that this is the moment

161
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,467
to walk through that door?

162
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,567
They say you just know.

163
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,467
But it's unknowable.

164
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,133
It says so right there.

165
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:54,233
Unless... wait, what do
you know about the unknown

166
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,400
that I don't know?

167
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:56,800
Only this.

168
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,166
That for a ghost
to pass through,

169
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,333
they must first know
where they want to go.

170
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:13,533
Oh, really?

171
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,934
Oh, you three are up next.

172
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:20,133
Oh, and you three are
up third, or fourth.

173
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,533
Could be fifth, but let me
tell you, worth the wait.

174
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:26,867
My good ghosts.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,867
Lovely to see you this fine day.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,033
All the days are fine, Charlie.

177
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:31,400
True.

178
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,934
True.

179
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:34,476
Hard to find a day here
that's anything but filled

180
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
with Christmas spirit.

181
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,700
It's everywhere else that
could use a bit of work.

182
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,467
So I just got word you three
are headed back to Hartford.

183
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,433
You're kidding.

184
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:42,567
Two in a row?

185
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,867
Rare, but it happens.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,440
So let's see who
you're matched with.

187
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:58,567
And now for your mission.

188
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:08,967
Past, Present, Future, and
your shared purpose is...

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,633
Next Christmas, the
Foodstuff Grocery Corporation

190
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:20,200
will be handed down from Robert
Baron to his son, Peter Baron.

191
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,767
Where's the part about how
he lost his Christmas spirit

192
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
and why he wants it back?

193
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

194
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,367
You have almost a year.

195
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,266
Not a better ghost team
in the whole department.

196
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,367
Remember, keep your
research to yourself.

197
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,333
What do you think,
we died yesterday?

198
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:36,600
Oh, Arlene.

199
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:38,166
Ah, this is absurd.

200
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,633
What, Roy?

201
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:44,467
Oh, just future things.

202
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,533
You know, I've never
shared any of my research.

203
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,934
And we should keep that
streak going, don't you think?

204
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,433
But Roy, there are
things I've seen

205
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,967
that make me wonder whether
you and I should maybe...

206
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,300
Hi.

207
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:02,967
Hi.

208
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,700
Hi.

209
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:04,914
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

210
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,133
What are you guys talking about?

211
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:10,133
What are you talking about?

212
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:10,500
What?

213
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:11,166
What?

214
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,533
What?

215
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:12,533
What?

216
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,200
I just got here.

217
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,500
Wait, are you two
like, cahooting?

218
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:18,200
Oh, no.

219
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,333
No.

220
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:21,934
No one's cahooting.

221
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,266
Oh, time to go.

222
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,600
Hark how the bells.

223
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:32,133
Sweet silver bells all seem
to say, throw cares away.

224
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:35,300
Or on they send, on without
end, their joyful tone

225
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,533
to every home.

226
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:37,967
Hark how the bells.

227
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,934
Sweet silver bells
all seem to say...

228
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,934
Were you guys
talking about Peter?

229
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:44,767
Well, he is the man of the hour.

230
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,533
If you two were
swapping secrets...

231
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,133
Who's got secrets?

232
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:52,133
So we're really going into
tonight just winging it.

233
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:54,967
You're not suggesting sharing
our research, are you?

234
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,133
I'm just saying we have
absolutely no idea what

235
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,700
we are scrooging this guy for.

236
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,400
I've got plenty to work with.

237
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:01,934
He's not perfect.

238
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:04,209
No, not perfect is a far cry
from being perfectly awful.

239
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,000
And that's how
this normally goes.

240
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,367
When in doubt, go back
to our shared purpose.

241
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,867
What shared purpose?

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,810
All they told us is that
Peter is inheriting the family

243
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:14,500
business, and that's not a
purpose, it's a headline.

244
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,033
Whatever Peter needs to
learn this Christmas,

245
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,000
it's our job to figure it out.

246
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:22,333
Come on, Roy, just give
us a little something.

247
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:25,667
Does Peter go on to like
steal from children or set

248
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,500
fire to Christmas trees or...

249
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:28,667
Well, I won't lie.

250
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,033
This is an odd one, but why
one soul or another needs

251
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,834
a little Christmas
magic, that has

252
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:38,000
to do with the cosmic order.

253
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,100
Come on, let's make
it one for the books.

254
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:49,934
No, Dad.

255
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:51,066
There's no issue.

256
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,166
I just kind of wanted
to go over it again.

257
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,400
Bring it tomorrow
for the lawyers.

258
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:56,734
Tomorrow?

259
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,600
Sorry, as into the
Christmas party?

260
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:02,133
Business doesn't take holidays.

261
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:04,333
Right.

262
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:08,300
Well, speaking of which,
Merry Almost Christmas, Dad.

263
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,633
You too.

264
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,367
And Dad... Dad...

265
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:31,433
Yeah.

266
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,567
Hello?

267
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,266
Hello, Peter.

268
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,500
What?

269
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:49,633
How did you...

270
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:53,767
OK.

271
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,633
OK.

272
00:12:57,767 --> 00:13:02,200
All right, just let's take...

273
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:02,533
You.

274
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,500
Hm?

275
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,633
Hi.

276
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:08,300
Oh, boy.

277
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:09,834
Oh, boy.

278
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,643
I was really hoping that
you wouldn't remember me.

279
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,467
Of course, I remember you.

280
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,910
One minute you're there, and
then the next minute, you're...

281
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:15,633
Katherine, what is...

282
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:16,800
I know.

283
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,166
I know it's so bad.

284
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,500
I wanted to tell you
guys, but you were so

285
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,467
insistent not to share your
research, which I completely

286
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,633
respect, but this has
been eating me alive.

287
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,967
And I'm, honestly, just
really glad that it's finally

288
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,633
out in the open.

289
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,567
So OK.

290
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,033
What happened was, last
Christmas, somehow...

291
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,734
And I don't know
how it happened,

292
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:41,033
but somehow, this guy saw me.

293
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,834
Did you know about this?

294
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,200
Of course, I knew.

295
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,000
I tried to talk to you, but...

296
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,033
I knew you guys were cahooting.

297
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm so sorry.

298
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,000
Could I interrupt?

299
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,633
Could one of you
tell me what in the...

300
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,567
OK, let me explain.

301
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,333
We are ghosts.

302
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:58,967
One more time.

303
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,800
Every year, we visit one
person, and only that person

304
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,700
is supposed to be
able to see us.

305
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:07,033
And then they're
supposed to forget us.

306
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,533
So really, something
is wrong with you

307
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,667
since you could see me,
and something is definitely

308
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,533
wrong with you since
you could remember me.

309
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,800
This is his fault?

310
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,867
I think I'm feeling a little...

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,467
Are you guys hot?

312
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,734
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:22,700
I never should have
said that there's

314
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,066
something wrong with you.

315
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,209
Actually, I don't
know that there's

316
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:27,900
anything wrong with you.

317
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,233
And that's another problem.

318
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,734
Katherine.

319
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:33,433
Hey, could we go back to
the part about the ghosts?

320
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:37,400
Because... wait a minute.

321
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:41,033
Are you... it's nearly Christmas.

322
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,033
There are three of you.

323
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:42,867
Oh, good.

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,400
You get it.

325
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,200
I'm Future.

326
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,633
She's Past.

327
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:48,767
And you are...

328
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:49,934
Ghost of Christmas Present.

329
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,633
What?

330
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,300
That... wow, I have
seen the play.

331
00:14:57,433 --> 00:15:00,333
I have seen all the movies,
and the one with Bill Murray

332
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,700
is actually my favorite,
although the Carrie Fisher

333
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,367
one is really good,
a quiet little movie

334
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,767
underrated, certainly.

335
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,333
And oh, the one where
they all come together

336
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,376
and they're singing in
the end about how grateful

337
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,133
they are about how Scrooge is
dead, which is really dark now

338
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:15,333
that I think about it.

339
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:19,367
But wait a minute, am I Scrooge?

340
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,367
Do people hate me?

341
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,133
Why don't we just...

342
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,133
It's because I'm
spoiled, isn't it?

343
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,633
I knew it.

344
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:27,967
My whole life, I've tried
to fight that, you know?

345
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,767
Better that you just
you go on a journey.

346
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,367
My parents.

347
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,800
No, it's my parents.

348
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,476
I should have tried harder
to keep them together,

349
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,967
but I didn't.

350
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,309
And my therapist always said
that it was not my fault,

351
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,967
but I kind of felt like maybe...

352
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,767
Was it?

353
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,700
I seriously doubt it, but come
on, you strange, guilty thing.

354
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:46,166
Oh, this is exciting.

355
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,333
Oh, you're coming, right?

356
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:47,967
Me?

357
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,300
Yeah.

358
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:49,200
No.

359
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,500
Ah, no, no, no, no.

360
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:52,166
We all work alone.

361
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,967
Well, it kind of feels like
I'm a special case though.

362
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,333
Well as much as I would like
to see Arlene do her work,

363
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:59,967
and Arlene, I really
am so curious how

364
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,033
you were going to
do your work, this

365
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,600
is about you and your past,
and that is not some place

366
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:06,734
that I belong.

367
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,333
You have already
been there, so...

368
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,500
He's not wrong.

369
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,233
Thank you.

370
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,367
Oh, come on, Roy.

371
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,233
OK.

372
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:17,033
Great.

373
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,667
But not a peep.

374
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,500
M-hm.

375
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,867
This is going to be fun.

376
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,767
OK, let's all grab hands.

377
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,033
How about this one next?

378
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,166
What could it be?

379
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
Shoes.

380
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,600
Look, Grandpa, shoes.

381
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:43,734
Thank goodness.

382
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,700
Hard to imagine
there has ever been

383
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,600
a kid who loved Christmas
more than you did.

384
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:52,266
Well, yeah, what's not to love.

385
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,667
You've got the music, the
decorations, the food.

386
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,233
The gifts.

387
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,600
That's what this is about.

388
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:00,767
Yee arr.

389
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,066
Dad, you got me a new bike?

390
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,467
Yeah.

391
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,900
OK.

392
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,509
All right, yes, I got
way too many gifts,

393
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:12,000
but in fairness, I
gave half of them away.

394
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,293
In fact, he was furious at
me for giving anything away.

395
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,767
Yes, OK, have I could have
given away more, maybe

396
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,133
half as much more.

397
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:22,800
Does that work out
mathematically?

398
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,100
This is what you're
working with?

399
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,242
I'd give away those shoes.

400
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:27,734
Those are cheap anyways.

401
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:28,867
Merry Christmas.

402
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,567
Oh.

403
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Oh.

404
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,600
It's the Frog Hollow Angel.

405
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:37,334
I never thought I'd
see this place again.

406
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:40,900
This is the best
Christmas present ever.

407
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:42,033
Hey, Devon.

408
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:42,934
You two know each other?

409
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,734
He's in my class.

410
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:49,133
I wonder, Devon, if you love
LEGOs as much as my grandson,

411
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:50,767
Peter brought his today.

412
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,734
Why don't you two
go build something.

413
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:54,033
Come on, Devon, let's go.

414
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,367
You let me know what Devon
wants for Christmas, OK?

415
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,580
We'll make sure he gets it.

416
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,567
Grandpa Bob was the best.

417
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,834
He was always giving everything
he had away to everyone else.

418
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,333
I'm going to build a spaceship.

419
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:11,500
How awesome would it
be to have a spaceship?

420
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:12,867
So awesome.

421
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,467
Peter, we're going
be late for dinner.

422
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,166
Devon, you keep them.

423
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,834
But they're yours.

424
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,800
Merry Christmas.

425
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:26,300
Hey, I just bought
those for you.

426
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,033
You can't just give
away your toys.

427
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,667
Robert, it's almost Christmas.

428
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,467
Don't you think it's the best
time to give away our toys?

429
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,033
Hey, why don't you
two skip dinner.

430
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,900
We've got a Santa coming.

431
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:41,800
We have reservations
at The Plaza.

432
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:46,033
Well then, Merry
Almost Christmas.

433
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,166
You too.

434
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,967
After winter break,
your dad enrolled you

435
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,166
in a private school.

436
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,800
Oh, good.

437
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,576
Because that's what a rich
kid needs, only rich friends.

438
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,967
Oh, zip it.

439
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,233
Sorry.

440
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,867
In his defense,
he's not a bad guy.

441
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,867
He was just sort of one
of those guys that had

442
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,934
a what's-ours-is-ours mentality.

443
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,066
It's complicated.

444
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,400
Moving on.

445
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:17,533
Oh, wait can...

446
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:23,266
Mom, Dad!

447
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,066
Grandpa, hurry!

448
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,066
We're not in line yet.

449
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Your family always spent
Christmas Day at the carousel

450
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,033
together.

451
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,300
Oh, I lived for it.

452
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,734
It was the only day of the
year that my dad did not work.

453
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:40,607
So we did this every year.

454
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:42,054
We'd get here as
early as possible

455
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,200
so that we can get into
that sleigh right there,

456
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,834
and we go around
dozens of times.

457
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,767
The whole trick was to
try and not get dizzy.

458
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,400
No, we talked about Monday.

459
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:50,834
Right.

460
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:51,734
All right.

461
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:53,500
Fine.

462
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:54,433
I gotta get back.

463
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,600
A meeting came up.

464
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:57,266
But it's Christmas.

465
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,767
No.

466
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,266
No.

467
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,066
No.

468
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
That's not right.

469
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,667
My father never
worked on Christmas.

470
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,867
Robert, can't you just...

471
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,467
Business doesn't take holidays.

472
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:11,533
OK, maybe he did a little bit.

473
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,333
Come on kiddo.

474
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,467
I'll sit with you.

475
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,400
But I don't want to go with Dad.

476
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,100
He's gotta work,
sweetheart, so we're

477
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:19,166
going to stay and ride
as much as you like,

478
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,540
and then we'll walk home later.

479
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,834
Yeah, come on.

480
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:23,600
It's going to be fun.

481
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:24,734
Come on.

482
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:39,400
That was the last Christmas
for Grandpa Bob, wasn't it?

483
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:41,934
You never know something's
happening for the last time

484
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,266
until it's over.

485
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,200
By the next year, your
parents were divorced,

486
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:50,266
and it was just and your
mother at the carousel.

487
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,266
The year after that...

488
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,834
You don't need to narrate it.

489
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,066
It's sad enough as it is.

490
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Are we good?

491
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:10,667
Within a couple of years,
your mom got remarried.

492
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,500
And there was Anna.

493
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:12,667
Cute baby.

494
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,900
Everybody said so.

495
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,467
Peter, would you take a picture?

496
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Yeah.

497
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:26,266
You spent more and more
time alone at Christmas,

498
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,133
wondering where you fit.

499
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:29,767
You should have been
in that picture.

500
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,066
Come on, Robert,
it's a money pit.

501
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,560
We should sell off
the whole block.

502
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,900
No, I'm not selling it.

503
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:40,433
I told you before,
end of conversation.

504
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:41,900
What about you,
Peter, what do you

505
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,176
think about the food business?

506
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,834
I think it's cool,
you know, as far

507
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:49,533
as commodifying a
basic human need goes.

508
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,100
I'll be back.

509
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,367
Oh, man.

510
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,300
Do we have to do this part?

511
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:05,367
I'm afraid we do.

512
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,000
For a period of time, you
thought your loneliness could

513
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:09,967
be cured by Rachel Finkenauer.

514
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
I did.

515
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:16,300
But she didn't feel
the same way about you.

516
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:17,433
She didn't.

517
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,367
So that was the first
and last time you ever

518
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,667
opened yourself up to anyone.

519
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,200
To be honest, Rachel had one of
these big and happy families.

520
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:37,367
I think I was more into that
than I actually was into her.

521
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,567
I was also really into her.

522
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,400
Maybe it's not too late
for you and Rachel.

523
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,533
Oh, no.

524
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:46,200
She married that
guy on the pony.

525
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,166
Anyhow, let's see what
the following Christmas

526
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,200
had in store.

527
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,967
Yes, please.

528
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,300
Ah, ah.

529
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:56,433
Oh, no.

530
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,533
Where am I?

531
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,066
There I am.

532
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,200
Dad, come on.

533
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,700
We're going to be
late to our own party.

534
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:12,533
Business doesn't take holidays.

535
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:13,233
Yeah.

536
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,533
Yeah, I know.

537
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,910
You know, it seems to me like
your dad worked an awful lot

538
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:18,900
on Christmas.

539
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:21,867
Well, how come we never
have a party here?

540
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,433
You know how much
those things cost?

541
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:24,300
Oh, come on.

542
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:25,467
That was a great idea.

543
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,400
We could have had musical
guests, maybe Susan Kraine.

544
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,533
We scrooged Susan Kraine.

545
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,100
What?

546
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:31,433
No way.

547
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:32,633
Yes.

548
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:33,533
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

549
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:34,667
Why?

550
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:35,600
What was she like?

551
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:36,400
Super scroogy.

552
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:37,066
No way.

553
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,767
Yes.

554
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,100
Well, not anymore, I hope.

555
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:41,700
Wow, I guess you
never really know

556
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:42,976
what the long-term effects are.

557
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,433
My dad loved Susan Kraine.

558
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:44,967
Really?

559
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,400
Yeah.

560
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:48,533
I remember this day.

561
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,233
You have his kindness, you know?

562
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:54,200
Thanks.

563
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:58,433
But his kindness was
also his weakness.

564
00:23:58,567 --> 00:23:59,567
Sit, Peter.

565
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,500
Have you thought about the
next chapter of your life?

566
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:08,767
Like college?

567
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,767
After that.

568
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,600
Not really.

569
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:20,000
Foodstuff has been a family
business, for better or worse.

570
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:22,133
Doesn't have to
continue that way,

571
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:27,834
but it could, if
that's what you want.

572
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,700
Say no.

573
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,700
Say no.

574
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,533
What?

575
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,133
You wish you'd said no?

576
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:40,633
No.

577
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:41,767
No, I don't know.

578
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,200
Wait, what's the answer.

579
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,810
You don't know if
you want the company?

580
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:45,976
No, no, no, I want the company.

581
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,133
I want the company.

582
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,500
Who wouldn't want this company?

583
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,633
It's a great opportunity.

584
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:51,533
It's destiny.

585
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,967
Destiny is a false construct.

586
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
Really?

587
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:59,266
I was really kind of
rooting for that one.

588
00:24:59,400 --> 00:24:59,600
All right.

589
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:01,333
Yes.

590
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:04,367
No, I want the company,
and if I were in charge...

591
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,033
If you were in charge?

592
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,767
You're going to be in charge.

593
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,367
You've been in training to
take over for years and years,

594
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,000
and here you are.

595
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:17,667
But you can still
choose to say no.

596
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,867
Peter, you're about to inherit
the keys to the castle.

597
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,266
Maybe we're here
because this Christmas

598
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,367
you need to be reminded of
the you of yesterday knew.

599
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,767
It could, if that's
what you want.

600
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,100
Of course, that's what I want.

601
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,767
Merry Christmas to all of us.

602
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,367
Happy New Year.

603
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,667
Happy New Year.

604
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, dear hearts.

605
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:55,867
We need a huddle.

606
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,900
Yes, I love a good huddle.

607
00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,333
You're not invited
to the huddle.

608
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:00,500
Go.

609
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,633
Go make yourself at home.

610
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,000
This is my home.

611
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:04,000
See how easy that was?

612
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,667
Are we huddling or not?

613
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,467
Sorry.

614
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:06,867
Yes, OK.

615
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Huddle.

616
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,400
Get out of here.

617
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:11,834
All right.

618
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:12,333
All right.

619
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,133
Jeez.

620
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:16,100
You guys, he doesn't
want the company.

621
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:17,734
You weren't even
supposed to see that.

622
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,266
Fine, but now that I have,
what if that's why we're here.

623
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,500
To get Peter not to
take over the business?

624
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:26,133
Why would they need
Christmas ghosts for that?

625
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:29,100
I don't know, but Arlene,
you can scrooge anyone.

626
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:30,934
And I just watched
you dance in circles...

627
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,433
I did not dance.

628
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:37,900
In circles trying to
figure out why this guy.

629
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:39,500
He's so not scroogy.

630
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:44,100
I mean, he's like
the anti-Scrooge.

631
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:45,910
What if he's supposed to
do something different

632
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:47,500
with his life?

633
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:49,953
You know, when I met Peter last
year, and yes, yes, I know,

634
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,500
that wasn't supposed
to happen, but it did,

635
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:55,967
he was staying up all night to
feed people in a parking lot.

636
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,900
If taking over the company means
he's going to become anything

637
00:26:59,033 --> 00:26:59,667
like his dad...

638
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,533
Now, there's a Scrooge.

639
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,967
So maybe we're
here to keep Peter

640
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,967
from going that direction.

641
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,367
What if he is supposed to do
something great for the world

642
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,033
as long as he is free to do it.

643
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,509
That is something I
could imagine them

644
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,800
using Christmas ghosts for.

645
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:17,934
Yes.

646
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,500
I figured pajamas
work in the past,

647
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:26,633
but maybe it's not for me to
be hanging out in the present.

648
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:27,367
I should.

649
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,633
Yeah.

650
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,834
He's right.

651
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:32,266
Why not dress the part?

652
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:39,233
Roy.

653
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:43,734
Wow, you... very festive.

654
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:45,100
So where are we going?

655
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:52,734
What's wrong?

656
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:55,734
There was a picture of Katherine
in the community center

657
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:56,967
on the table.

658
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,767
She came that
close to seeing it.

659
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,700
And what if she had?

660
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:07,066
If she realizes how it all fits
and starts asking questions,

661
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,867
I just don't want
her to get hurt.

662
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,700
This isn't about her,
it's not about any of us.

663
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:14,867
We're here to do a job.

664
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,867
That's all.

665
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,367
That's all, right, Roy?

666
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,233
All is as it should be.

667
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:29,600
Tha.

668
00:28:29,734 --> 00:28:32,667
My father started the
Foodstuff Grocery Corporation

669
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,333
with his little corner store
right here in Frog Hollow.

670
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:38,467
This was like Monday.

671
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,133
Oh, yeah.

672
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:43,300
So Christmas present, we get
the whole week of Christmas.

673
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:46,033
So you can see tomorrow
and the day after too?

674
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,166
M-hm.

675
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:48,934
And now it's my
honor to announce

676
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:52,333
that I will be passing the
torch to my son, Peter.

677
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:56,533
How did you feel in that moment?

678
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,533
Good.

679
00:28:58,667 --> 00:28:59,133
I mean, yeah.

680
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah, it felt good.

681
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:06,200
Let's see, we got all
the bread that we can.

682
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,500
This is Tuesday night.

683
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:08,200
M-hm.

684
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,200
One for you.

685
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,266
OK, I have to ask.

686
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I've seen all the movies.

687
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:14,834
I know.

688
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:15,834
The Bill Murray one
is your favorite.

689
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:18,367
It is, so much so.

690
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,834
But was the first ever
scrooging Scrooge?

691
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:24,600
Is that a person?

692
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:25,734
No.

693
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,700
OK, get this.

694
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,834
Dickens was a real
piece of work.

695
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:31,533
Yeah.

696
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:32,876
So he gets scrooged one
year, it changes his life.

697
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,667
Next thing you know...

698
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,500
Classic novel?

699
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:36,667
Exactly.

700
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,333
Yes.

701
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:39,710
And on the one hand, it's
great because when we show up,

702
00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:42,400
people are like,
oh, right, you guys.

703
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:45,400
But then there's also
the whole like, hey,

704
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,100
where's the scary ghost of
my dead business partner?

705
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:50,200
I was actually kind of
wondering about that part.

706
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,533
Writers.

707
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,343
It's like what, this
wasn't dramatic enough?

708
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:56,867
You needed to add another ghost?

709
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You know what's
funny, all year, I've

710
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:07,567
been thinking about who was that
woman who totally ghosted me?

711
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,333
Yeah.

712
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:10,166
I did.

713
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,533
I did totally ghost you.

714
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:13,166
Literally.

715
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,300
Literally.

716
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,400
But we got to focus.

717
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:21,433
So why don't we just...

718
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:26,033
Why don't we skip forward
to this Wednesday?

719
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:30,066
It's not realistic for me to
be coming out here with a van

720
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,120
and handing out sandwiches
anymore because I have

721
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:36,834
all these responsibilities.

722
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:40,066
I know you know what
happened, so if we could...

723
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Back up about 6 hours?

724
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,100
Yes, please, if we have to.

725
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:46,100
Yes, we do.

726
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:47,673
You don't get to
come into work tired

727
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,876
because you've been up all
night playing Mother Theresa.

728
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,367
You don't get to tell me what
to do with my downtime, Dad.

729
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,676
I get to tell you
what to do when

730
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,767
you're putting all that
I've worked for on the line.

731
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,400
You don't think it's
a little extreme.

732
00:30:57,533 --> 00:31:00,266
You're out there
using a company van.

733
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,934
One call to the
city, we'll be buried

734
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:04,767
in lawsuits over food safety.

735
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Shut it down.

736
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:24,100
OK, he's not... he's not
bad, he just grew it more.

737
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,433
Wait, I thought your grandfather
started this company.

738
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,900
That makes for a really great
story more than anything,

739
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:32,233
but in reality, he made some
pretty bad financial decisions

740
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,467
for the block and Frog Hollow.

741
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,266
Ew, yeah, he mean this block?

742
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,633
The one that your family owns?

743
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:42,633
Oh, come on.

744
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,800
I'm never going to
live that down, am I?

745
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:46,467
No, probably not.

746
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,467
OK.

747
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,133
Well, do technically own it.

748
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:53,133
My grandfather basically bought
it one building at a time.

749
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:55,166
And he and my grandmother,
they had this vision.

750
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,333
They were going to
turn this street

751
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,066
into a place for everyone.

752
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,633
They were going
to turn the Rootie

753
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:05,066
Tootie into this free
venue with music and food.

754
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,300
And there'd be a
shelter, daycare, and all

755
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:12,967
of these really cool ideas.

756
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,734
But I guess not that practical,
and they sunk all their money

757
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:18,133
into it.

758
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:19,843
So there were some rough
years, to say the least.

759
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:23,000
But you know what
the amazing thing

760
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:27,567
is that my grandfather, even
though he was struggling,

761
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,200
he still gave everything
that he had away.

762
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:35,533
So the community center went
under, but what happened to it?

763
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,467
My grandfather ran it
until the day he died,

764
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,767
and then my dad
took it over, and...

765
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,300
But in his defense, the
place was not built to code,

766
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:48,533
and fines kept piling up.

767
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,900
And he wasn't doing
it to be mean,

768
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:55,567
but it didn't make
sense for the business,

769
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,800
and therefore, it didn't
make sense for the family.

770
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,433
And I don't know,
it's just complicated.

771
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:02,200
Complicated.

772
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:03,967
Yeah, you said.

773
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,600
My dad is an
amazing businessman.

774
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,433
He took this struggling
little grocery company,

775
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:13,867
and he turned it
into this big thing.

776
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,233
I just feel that he believes
that to be successful,

777
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:22,233
you need to be tough.

778
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,033
Do you think he's right?

779
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,867
I don't know.

780
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,233
And he built an empire,
and I'm just inheriting it.

781
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:32,200
So if your dad is this
amazing businessman,

782
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,967
why is he holding
on to all of this?

783
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,967
It can't be cheap.

784
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,700
It's all about the bottom line.

785
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:39,767
Trust me, if the math doesn't
add up, my dad will sell it.

786
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:46,433
I do know he has
some plans though.

787
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,266
And the Rootie Tootie
and the warehouse.

788
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,967
You can't let that happen.

789
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,567
Oh, yeah.

790
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,800
Right.

791
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:54,233
No, you're going to be the boss.

792
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:55,567
Don't let that happen.

793
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,300
He's still going to
be head of the board.

794
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,720
I'm not really going to have
much more power than I do now.

795
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:06,166
But enough about
me, how about you?

796
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,934
What?

797
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,066
Oh, come on.

798
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:12,767
Tell me something
about yourself.

799
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,533
Uh-ah.

800
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:14,533
I don't think so.

801
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:15,707
That's not how this works.

802
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:16,734
Says who?

803
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:22,867
OK, what do you want to know?

804
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,100
Anything.

805
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:26,033
How about maybe how you...

806
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,333
How I died?

807
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:28,907
Oh, is that super
basic of me to ask?

808
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,700
Yes, I get it every
single scrooging.

809
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:31,300
Oh, Yikes.

810
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:31,700
OK.

811
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:34,166
OK.

812
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,500
Where did you grow up?

813
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:37,166
OK, it's not
completely original,

814
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,066
but it is an improvement.

815
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:44,133
Right there.

816
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:45,633
It used to be an
apartment complex.

817
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:47,934
I grew up there with my grandma.

818
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:49,867
Really?

819
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,633
You grew up right there.

820
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:53,467
M-hm.

821
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,667
Of course, you did.

822
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,867
I mean, what was
your grandma like?

823
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:00,934
You tell me.

824
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:02,166
What was your grandma like?

825
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,767
My grandma, I didn't
really know her.

826
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,266
She passed away
when I was young.

827
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:19,867
My grandma would put on a
full face of makeup just

828
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,033
to stay home in the afternoons
and listen to her stories.

829
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,000
Stories on the radio.

830
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:26,834
I'm not sure if you
know what that is.

831
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:30,367
It's kind of like a TV,
but without the picture.

832
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,166
Do you mean like a podcast?

833
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,400
What?

834
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:34,333
I don't know if you
know what that is.

835
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:35,467
I know what that is.

836
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:41,200
This kind of feels
like the moment

837
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:46,600
where I would say that
you're really funny and cool.

838
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:48,867
And I would like to buy
you a drink some time.

839
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,066
Come on, Peter,
there's more to see.

840
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,700
Thanks, Hannah.

841
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:04,467
I had a feeling we
were coming here.

842
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,633
Oh, OK.

843
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:06,776
Well, why don't I just go.

844
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,166
You can scrooge yourself.

845
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,533
I'm just saying I already
told my mom that I can't

846
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:11,834
make Christmas Eve dinner.

847
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:13,533
That it was a long shot.

848
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,367
Besides, it's like
a very busy week.

849
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,967
We've got the press
and the logistics.

850
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,133
He's got a busy schedule.

851
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:21,800
It's fine.

852
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:23,834
We should eat
before it gets cold.

853
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,567
She misses you when
you're not here.

854
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,800
She's got her family.

855
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,200
You are her family.

856
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,367
I'd just make
things complicated.

857
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,400
Haven't we established
that things are also

858
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:35,467
complicated with your dad?

859
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,633
No, actually, things with
my dad are quite simple,

860
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:41,467
as long as you just
talk about work.

861
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,633
Well, you do manage to make
it to his Christmas Eve party.

862
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,367
I heard you were handing
out food in the parking lot.

863
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,300
I'm glad your father
talk some sense into you.

864
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,643
If you go giving up
food for free, then

865
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,967
who's going to pay for it?

866
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,166
He wants to do good,
and I applaud that.

867
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,220
But I keep telling him,
you want to do real good,

868
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,734
make as much as you can
and write a few big checks.

869
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,800
Standing out in the cold
giving away sandwiches

870
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:03,600
isn't going to
make a difference.

871
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:04,400
This is painful.

872
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:05,367
This is so painful.

873
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,367
Why don't I say something?

874
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,066
Come on, say something.

875
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Excuse me.

876
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,667
Where do I go?

877
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:28,233
There I am, a
little hiding spot.

878
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:29,367
I'm a coward.

879
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,066
You don't remember how you die.

880
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,233
That part is blank, and
maybe that's a good thing.

881
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:42,233
I don't know.

882
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:47,867
But however it happened, I
didn't know it was coming.

883
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,467
I wasn't sick or anything.

884
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,280
And I really thought
that I was going to do

885
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:54,800
great things with my life.

886
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:57,967
I just thought that I had
lots of time to do them.

887
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,333
But it's like you
said, you never

888
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:04,333
know when something is
ending until it's over.

889
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,333
I'm going to tell you something
I probably shouldn't tell you,

890
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:11,233
OK?

891
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:12,700
I'd be really upset
if you didn't.

892
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:14,200
Usually when we
scrooge someone, it

893
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,967
is all so obvious at
what they need to learn,

894
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,133
but with you, it's been tough.

895
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:21,133
I bet.

896
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,000
And no, you're not perfect.

897
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:26,000
OK, that's been established.

898
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:30,500
But this Christmas magic,
it's really special.

899
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:32,433
So if we're supposed
to use it for you,

900
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,867
then there must be something
about this moment that's...

901
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:42,533
You know, Christmas is a
time for people who are lost.

902
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:48,367
It's a time for them to
remember who they really are.

903
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,000
And you think I'm lost?

904
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:54,333
Well, that's not for me
to say, Peter, but I mean,

905
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:58,133
if I could go back, I
wouldn't waste a minute.

906
00:38:58,266 --> 00:39:00,266
I would have just
been so much braver.

907
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:09,300
Well, if I were
braver, I would...

908
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:18,667
I'd turn down taking
over the company.

909
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,876
Yeah, it's not what I want.

910
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,767
Never has been.

911
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,667
Whoa!

912
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,233
What was that?

913
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:26,600
Ah, did you just
get snapped back?

914
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:28,033
Why did that happen?

915
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,734
It only happens if we overstay.

916
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,033
I'm so sorry.

917
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,600
What is happening right now?

918
00:39:32,734 --> 00:39:34,033
Wait, Roy?

919
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:36,734
Roy, is that even possible?

920
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:39,033
Congratulations, my dear boy.

921
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,400
You must have
learned your lesson.

922
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:45,033
Yeah, thank you, but
I'm so sorry, what?

923
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,400
You're done, kid.

924
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:47,533
No.

925
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:55,000
I just... I just feel like
there are more things

926
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:57,367
that I need to show you.

927
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:57,734
Yeah.

928
00:39:57,867 --> 00:39:59,600
Yeah.

929
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:03,166
And you know, I feel like I need
a lot more time in the present

930
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,500
to really work through things.

931
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:08,000
And no offense, Roy, but
the whole graveyard scene

932
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:10,200
was not really my bag.

933
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,767
I'd love to skip that part.

934
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,033
Not how it goes.

935
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:15,100
When it's done, it's done.

936
00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:20,400
It doesn't feel done.

937
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:26,200
Well, Peter, you can't just
say it, you have to believe it.

938
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,000
If you really believe that
you need more Christmas magic,

939
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:32,033
then I'm sure there's
more for you to take.

940
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:40,533
Whew.

941
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:41,667
Whew.

942
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,734
Whew.

943
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:44,867
You can't just do that.

944
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,700
Sorry, what?

945
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,066
You can't flirt with me.

946
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,934
Well, you wanted more time.

947
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:51,934
Only because I thought
you had more to learn.

948
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:54,567
Maybe we both have
more to learn?

949
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,000
No, my learning days are over.

950
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:59,433
So you're telling me that
being back here where

951
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:05,300
you grew up, after all of
this, you don't feel anything?

952
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,100
Because as soon as
this night is done,

953
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:12,743
you're just going to
go back to wherever

954
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:15,300
it is that you go
between Christmases,

955
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,000
and I'm never going
to see you again.

956
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:24,633
Yeah.

957
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:27,266
Oh.

958
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,800
I love it when it
snows on Christmas.

959
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,900
Snow fall puts you
in the present.

960
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,467
Well, you'd be the
expert at that.

961
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,400
Close your eyes.

962
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:39,333
Close my eyes?

963
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:40,600
Yeah.

964
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:43,400
Let the snow fall on your face.

965
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:47,066
2 to 3 seconds, that's
how long it takes

966
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,440
to register the present moment.

967
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Whoa.

968
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:09,633
So just to be clear...

969
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:10,266
Yeah.

970
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,567
We're here to work.

971
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,266
Absolutely.

972
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,867
I need to show you things.

973
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,533
Definitely.

974
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:16,734
Yeah.

975
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,567
Like this guy.

976
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,667
That is a very lonely
way to spend Christmas.

977
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,233
No, not at all.

978
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,533
Do you want to go for a ride?

979
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:31,500
No, I'm fine.

980
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:32,734
I'm fine.

981
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:33,467
Really, I'm fine.

982
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
OK.

983
00:42:34,633 --> 00:42:35,500
A little better.

984
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:36,333
Could we go, please?

985
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:36,967
Yes.

986
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,533
What are we waiting for?

987
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:40,667
Oh!

988
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:44,333
You can give me a
little warning, I think.

989
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:46,200
No, it's way more fun this way.

990
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,333
So what's it like being magical?

991
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:57,133
I'm not magical, I
just get to use magic.

992
00:42:57,266 --> 00:42:58,934
I think you are pretty magical.

993
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:08,367
Ugh, bad guy.

994
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,200
Well, to be fair, that
guy can't see the magic.

995
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:14,633
He feels like a
stranger, honestly.

996
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:17,433
He has no idea what destiny
has in store for him.

997
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:24,166
What?

998
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,633
Life is a series of choices.

999
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:29,467
Do you believe that?

1000
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Yeah.

1001
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:31,734
Yeah, I do.

1002
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:36,433
Oh, there's something else
that I need to show you,

1003
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:40,066
something else that
happens this Christmas.

1004
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,467
That's never not
going to be weird.

1005
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,667
Is that Rachel Finkenauer?

1006
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
Peter Baron?

1007
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
Wow.

1008
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:08,433
Oh, my god, I can't believe it.

1009
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:09,333
Wow, hi.

1010
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:11,700
Oh, yeah, you look great.

1011
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:12,700
So do you.

1012
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:13,600
Thanks.

1013
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,600
Thanks.

1014
00:44:14,734 --> 00:44:17,667
Oh, is Jack... he's
working, I'm assuming.

1015
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,767
We're separated.

1016
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,667
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1017
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,467
Oh, don't be.

1018
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,667
I'm not.

1019
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,800
Is that my future?

1020
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:29,233
If that's what you want.

1021
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,500
OK.

1022
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:39,934
So I'll call my dad
tomorrow, tell him the truth,

1023
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:42,333
and I will go from there.

1024
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,800
Shall we?

1025
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:54,667
Yes, we shall.

1026
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:01,367
Merry Christmas, Peter.

1027
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,867
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

1028
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:10,667
Ah!

1029
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,834
Hey, Dad, it's me.

1030
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:32,166
Sorry to be calling so early,
but I didn't want to wimp out.

1031
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,834
So here it goes.

1032
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:37,400
I don't want the
company, and it's not

1033
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:39,413
just that I don't want
to take over the company,

1034
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:44,767
I don't want to be
anything like you.

1035
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
And now, I immediately
want to apologize for that,

1036
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:49,200
but no, no, I'm not going to.

1037
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:53,600
I'm not sorry because, yeah
Grandpa Bob was pretty bad

1038
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:57,200
with money, but he was so
good in so many other ways.

1039
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:58,613
And quite frankly,
I would rather

1040
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,834
be broke and good
than rich and broken.

1041
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:05,133
So bye.

1042
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:07,133
Oh, and Merry Christmas.

1043
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:08,400
Cheers.

1044
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:10,100
My good, ghosts.

1045
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:11,266
Trust it went well?

1046
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,900
It was delightful.

1047
00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:16,066
So Robert Baron's Christmas
spirit is fully restored.

1048
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,667
You mean Peter Baron.

1049
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,066
Yes, I believe his full
name is Robert Peter Baron.

1050
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,667
But he goes by Peter.

1051
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,000
Pretty sure he goes by Robert.

1052
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:23,600
Peter.

1053
00:46:23,734 --> 00:46:24,133
Robert.

1054
00:46:24,266 --> 00:46:25,266
Charlie.

1055
00:46:33,266 --> 00:46:34,734
I don't know what to say.

1056
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:38,166
Everyone in the Department of
Cosmic Order is flabbergasted.

1057
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,533
This is simply unprecedented.

1058
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:41,066
The book never gets
anything wrong.

1059
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,480
I have a feeling
it's not so much

1060
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,467
the book as a book's handler.

1061
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,000
Let's just move
forward, shall we?

1062
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:47,800
Because there is
no moving backward.

1063
00:46:47,934 --> 00:46:50,000
Though you might
disagree there, Arlene.

1064
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:54,300
I'm about to move your face
forward into this table.

1065
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:55,433
Right.

1066
00:46:55,467 --> 00:46:58,734
So you had the wrong guy.

1067
00:46:58,867 --> 00:46:59,734
Yes, Charlie.

1068
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:00,867
We know.

1069
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:02,042
So tell us what happens now.

1070
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,467
What are we doing?

1071
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,710
Are we going back to
Hartford next year

1072
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:05,967
to scrooge Peter's dad?

1073
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,467
Goodness, no.

1074
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,710
I guess that's
probably for the best.

1075
00:47:09,734 --> 00:47:11,867
I mean, it's probably time
I say goodbye to Hartford

1076
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,066
once and for all.

1077
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,376
You're going to
get back out there

1078
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,266
and scrooge Peter's
dad right now.

1079
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,120
Just get back out there
and make sure Robert

1080
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,033
learns all the usual stuff...
Greed, bad; family, good.

1081
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:25,567
But it's already sunrise.

1082
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Not to worry.

1083
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:27,810
I've gotten you an extension.

1084
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:29,114
You're most very
welcome, and you

1085
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,343
can thank me on your own time.

1086
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:31,867
How long have we got?

1087
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,600
Till sundown, an additional
nine hours on Earth.

1088
00:47:35,734 --> 00:47:37,266
OK.

1089
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,600
But we haven't
done any research.

1090
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:40,967
This feels impossible.

1091
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,533
Said no, Ghost of Christmas.

1092
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:45,867
Anything ever, not
impossible in the least.

1093
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,600
Did I mention that
Robert can't see you,

1094
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:50,774
and you can't guide him
through his life, obviously.

1095
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,066
What?

1096
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,600
Well, if you used
your one scrooging

1097
00:47:53,734 --> 00:47:54,876
this Christmas for Peter,
you can't use it for Robert,

1098
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,200
now can you?

1099
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,509
How are we supposed
to scrooge Robert

1100
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:59,367
without being able
to scrooge Robert?

1101
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,667
Yeah.

1102
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,300
Charlie, you've got
us the extra time.

1103
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:04,100
Just gives us the
extra scrooging.

1104
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:05,467
Sorry, no can do.

1105
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,433
Well, you know who else
no can do, this ghost.

1106
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:12,300
OK, Arlene, look, what I think
Arlene is trying to say is what

1107
00:48:12,433 --> 00:48:13,767
if we can't?

1108
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,367
I mean, what happens then?

1109
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,533
The entire fabric of the
universe may collapse.

1110
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:21,367
Or maybe just no
more Christmases.

1111
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,367
We don't know.

1112
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,500
It's never happened before.

1113
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:26,700
Anywho, if I were you,
I would get going.

1114
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:27,367
Tick tock.

1115
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,367
Wait, Charlie.

1116
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:28,867
Charlie.

1117
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,433
Charlie.

1118
00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:36,467
Ah, if Robert can't see
us and we can't guide him,

1119
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,300
our hands are tied.

1120
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:40,467
I only see one option.

1121
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,433
He likes you.

1122
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:42,934
We need him.

1123
00:48:43,066 --> 00:48:44,333
Come on, you guys.

1124
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:46,300
By now, he probably
doesn't even remember me.

1125
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:47,567
He remembered you last time.

1126
00:48:54,233 --> 00:48:54,934
Hey.

1127
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:55,433
Hey.

1128
00:48:55,567 --> 00:48:56,300
Hey.

1129
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,033
Peace on Earth.

1130
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:01,367
Hey, Peter, what's this?

1131
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,100
Oh, hey, yes.

1132
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:06,934
That is a peppermint patty
with a white chocolate ganache.

1133
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:08,400
It's a family recipe.

1134
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:10,433
So you made enough for
everyone on the floor?

1135
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:11,000
Whole building.

1136
00:49:11,133 --> 00:49:11,667
Yeah.

1137
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,667
Merry Christmas.

1138
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,900
Merry Christmas to you.

1139
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:17,200
Hey.

1140
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:18,333
Hi.

1141
00:49:18,367 --> 00:49:19,567
Oh, you remember me?

1142
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,166
Yeah.

1143
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:20,533
Wow.

1144
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,400
Good.

1145
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:23,773
Gosh, you know, I'm so curious.

1146
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,600
They say it feels
like a fever dream.

1147
00:49:25,734 --> 00:49:27,834
No, it kind of felt
like we were hanging out

1148
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:30,033
for the whole night.

1149
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:32,033
So yeah, I guess something
is wrong with me.

1150
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:32,934
Sh.

1151
00:49:33,066 --> 00:49:33,867
What?

1152
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,367
Why are you shushing me?

1153
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,309
Well, it looks like you're
talking to yourself.

1154
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:38,333
What?

1155
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:45,934
I'd put those in the fridge
because they melt rapidly.

1156
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:49,000
So Merry Christmas.

1157
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:52,100
So I'm confused as
to why you're still...

1158
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:53,934
Yeah.

1159
00:49:54,066 --> 00:49:56,567
So I'm not here guiding
you through your life.

1160
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,033
I'm visiting your life.

1161
00:49:58,166 --> 00:49:58,600
Right.

1162
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:00,367
I got that.

1163
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,676
And that is exactly why we
come in the middle of the night

1164
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,367
because if people
see you talking

1165
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,443
to yourself in the middle of
the day, it is so much worse.

1166
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:06,000
I get that too.

1167
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:07,133
Oh, I'm sorry.

1168
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:08,333
I forgot you're the expert.

1169
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:09,200
Was the scene in the
Bill Murray movie?

1170
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:09,734
Hey.

1171
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:10,200
Hey.

1172
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:11,533
Hey.

1173
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:12,100
Katherine, you seem
a little stressed.

1174
00:50:12,233 --> 00:50:12,467
Do I?

1175
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,600
Yeah.

1176
00:50:16,967 --> 00:50:17,967
Why are you here?

1177
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,000
I mean, it makes sense.

1178
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:34,333
He's definitely like the
epitome of a scrooge, isn't he?

1179
00:50:34,467 --> 00:50:37,533
Like right down to the peacoat.

1180
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,200
Well, so what do
you want from me?

1181
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:44,166
Well, basically, we need you
to be us, and will help you.

1182
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,433
We will help you figure
out how to get in there

1183
00:50:46,567 --> 00:50:49,734
and open him up.

1184
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:51,433
I'm so sorry.

1185
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:54,767
It's just when you
said open him up,

1186
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,500
I've been trying to
open up my father,

1187
00:50:57,633 --> 00:50:59,100
and it has never worked.

1188
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:01,967
I'm telling you, you will
just be wasting your time.

1189
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,133
OK.

1190
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:04,100
See, this sounds
like a challenge,

1191
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:05,633
and I love a challenge.

1192
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:10,467
Who was it said, um, life
is a series of choices?

1193
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,266
I don't know.

1194
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:11,967
You have no idea?

1195
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,100
Nope.

1196
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:17,667
So this is me making a choice.

1197
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,300
OK, I'm going to level with you.

1198
00:51:20,433 --> 00:51:23,300
Look, in the entire
history of Christmases,

1199
00:51:23,433 --> 00:51:25,600
there has never been an
unsuccessful scrooging,

1200
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:28,567
and we cannot be the
first team to fail.

1201
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,800
But you didn't fail.

1202
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:32,494
Do you know where I'm
going later today?

1203
00:51:32,533 --> 00:51:34,233
To make pies with my mom.

1204
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:36,433
And then afterwards,
I'll go to the carousel

1205
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:39,166
and see how that goes.

1206
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,400
Great.

1207
00:51:40,533 --> 00:51:42,834
That's great.

1208
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:44,233
But your dad.

1209
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:45,367
I'll just let it go.

1210
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:50,174
I've got some pies
I'm going to make.

1211
00:51:57,734 --> 00:51:59,600
Well, that wasn't
your best work.

1212
00:51:59,734 --> 00:52:02,300
Thank you.

1213
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:03,066
I don't know.

1214
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
Maybe he's right.

1215
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,242
Do you think Peter knows
more about the cosmic order

1216
00:52:06,266 --> 00:52:07,533
of things than our higher ups?

1217
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,800
Wait a minute.

1218
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:15,533
Wait, what if this
wasn't a mistake?

1219
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:19,800
What if... like you always say,
Roy, all is as it should be?

1220
00:52:19,934 --> 00:52:21,333
Not you two.

1221
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:24,867
Guys, what if we are here
for Peter and Robert?

1222
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:31,734
That's looking good, Peter.

1223
00:52:31,867 --> 00:52:34,367
I was worried I wouldn't
be seeing you today.

1224
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,300
You're going to be
seeing a lot more of me.

1225
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:37,433
I promise.

1226
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:41,033
Peter.

1227
00:52:43,467 --> 00:52:44,700
What are you doing?

1228
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:45,667
Come here, real quick.

1229
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,166
I can't.

1230
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:46,667
Go away.

1231
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Go away.

1232
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:48,633
Come here, please, really quick.

1233
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,133
Go away for a second.

1234
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:49,500
Just go.

1235
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,867
Peter.

1236
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,066
Hi.

1237
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,066
These earbuds,
it's going... yeah.

1238
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,242
Gosh, I didn't
even realize you...

1239
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:57,233
Yeah, they keep getting
smaller and smaller.

1240
00:52:57,367 --> 00:52:59,834
Let me... I'm just going
to go take them out.

1241
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:06,600
Hey.

1242
00:53:06,734 --> 00:53:07,367
Hey, I know.

1243
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:07,967
I know.

1244
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:08,600
I know.

1245
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:09,734
I'm sorry.

1246
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:11,867
But Peter, what do you want?

1247
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,867
I thought this was about my dad.

1248
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,433
Yeah, I'm still asking.

1249
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:15,910
What do you mean, like
if I could have anything?

1250
00:53:15,934 --> 00:53:17,533
You can have anything.

1251
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:19,343
What, are you printing
bumper stickers now?

1252
00:53:19,367 --> 00:53:20,367
I'm serious.

1253
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,300
I would want...

1254
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:29,433
I would want... I would want
my life to mean something,

1255
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:31,900
like my grandfather's
life meant something.

1256
00:53:32,033 --> 00:53:36,600
I would reopen the Frog Hollow
Angel, except some place built

1257
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:39,567
to code and that's sustainable.

1258
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,400
But come on, that's
not realistic.

1259
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:42,967
Why?

1260
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,400
Why not?

1261
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:45,976
Because my grandfather
poured his whole life

1262
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,867
into that place, and
then it just went under,

1263
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,133
and he was dependent
on my father.

1264
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:52,967
And I cannot do that.

1265
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,266
Because I know this
sounds stupid, but as much

1266
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,934
as I want to do
something that matters,

1267
00:53:59,066 --> 00:54:01,467
I also want my father's respect.

1268
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,100
That doesn't sound dumb.

1269
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:08,300
Maybe your dad just
needs to be a part of it.

1270
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:10,300
Come on, companies
have charitable arms.

1271
00:54:10,433 --> 00:54:13,367
Not this one.

1272
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,934
Not yet, but it does
have the perfect location

1273
00:54:17,066 --> 00:54:19,700
for a community
center, a big one

1274
00:54:19,834 --> 00:54:21,274
that's already built
to code, a place

1275
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,100
that your grandparents
had a vision for.

1276
00:54:24,233 --> 00:54:26,033
Did you just forget the
part where my dad was

1277
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:28,533
going to turn that into...

1278
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:29,967
I don't know, a warehouse?

1279
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,609
Peter, I'm not just
thinking about you.

1280
00:54:31,633 --> 00:54:34,767
Your father needs some
Christmas magic too,

1281
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,600
a stingy tycoon opening
a community center

1282
00:54:37,734 --> 00:54:42,600
to feed the hungry is 100% what
scroogings were designed for.

1283
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:45,700
You need your father just
as much as he needs you.

1284
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,633
Right.

1285
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:51,834
But he'll never go for it.

1286
00:54:51,967 --> 00:54:54,467
Peter, people can change.

1287
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,667
I have been doing this for
a long time, and trust me,

1288
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,934
people like your dad can change.

1289
00:55:01,066 --> 00:55:02,767
Ooh, there is one problem.

1290
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,100
The voicemail that
I left him, I doubt

1291
00:55:05,233 --> 00:55:06,500
he would even take my call.

1292
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:07,767
Oh, come on.

1293
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,166
Like, he's probably
changed the locks.

1294
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,867
How harsh was that voicemail?

1295
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,834
Real harsh.

1296
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:17,600
OK, that's fine.

1297
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:18,854
Let's just think about this.

1298
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:20,009
How else can we get to Robert?

1299
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:21,033
How can we get to Robert.

1300
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:21,767
What does he like?

1301
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,433
He loves money.

1302
00:55:25,567 --> 00:55:26,567
He loves business.

1303
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:36,533
He loves... hey, Mom,
I gotta out for a bit.

1304
00:55:39,633 --> 00:55:41,033
Where are we going?

1305
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:42,500
Well, Merry Christmas.

1306
00:55:42,633 --> 00:55:43,633
Merry Christmas, Susan.

1307
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,500
Just follow me.

1308
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:45,734
Follow me into my home.

1309
00:55:45,867 --> 00:55:47,166
Here you go.

1310
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,300
Wow.

1311
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:52,567
Oh, and this... this is
my Santa's workshop.

1312
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,734
Oh, it's so big.

1313
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:56,867
Big?

1314
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,734
Oh, come on, Peter.

1315
00:55:57,867 --> 00:55:59,367
Look alive.

1316
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,667
Ask about the little
elves on the mantle.

1317
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,667
Don't question me.

1318
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,800
I'm a pro.

1319
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:09,567
Oh, so I was wondering, could
you tell me about the gilded...

1320
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,667
Oh, my gold plated elves.

1321
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,767
Aren't they just rare beauties?

1322
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,100
Sometimes I carry these little
babies with me in my purse

1323
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:19,633
because they're just,
they're so yummy.

1324
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:21,900
And she's ready to welcome.

1325
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:24,667
In for the kill, pretty boy.

1326
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,633
So it's clear you've gotten
your Christmas spirit back,

1327
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:29,567
and it's so amazing.

1328
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,066
Thank you.

1329
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,209
Speaking of Christmas
spirit, it's

1330
00:56:32,233 --> 00:56:34,367
what I wanted to talk
to you about today.

1331
00:56:37,867 --> 00:56:38,867
I was wondering...

1332
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:40,834
I was wondering if...

1333
00:56:40,967 --> 00:56:42,333
Ah, spit it out.

1334
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:46,734
Spit it... if you'd
happen to have seen...

1335
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:49,834
I wish I could just jump in
his body and control him.

1336
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:50,800
What was that movie?

1337
00:56:50,934 --> 00:56:52,967
Ghost.

1338
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,467
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1339
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,633
Ghosts.

1340
00:56:56,767 --> 00:56:57,600
Plural.

1341
00:56:57,734 --> 00:57:00,133
Three of them.

1342
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:01,700
Does that ring a bell?

1343
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:03,400
Yes, that sounds very familiar.

1344
00:57:12,734 --> 00:57:14,509
And you do not even want
to know about the rabbit

1345
00:57:14,533 --> 00:57:16,700
hole of twisted
subconsciousness I

1346
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,867
can go down if you add
some pepperoni and mushroom

1347
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,400
to that bad boy.

1348
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:23,533
Really?

1349
00:57:23,633 --> 00:57:27,700
Yeah, but in all of my
years, I have never, ever

1350
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:28,667
had a dream like that.

1351
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,800
I swear to all that
is holy, I thought

1352
00:57:31,934 --> 00:57:33,467
I'd done some astral travel.

1353
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,400
I mean, it is the only
way to explain how

1354
00:57:35,533 --> 00:57:37,567
lucid that dream felt to me.

1355
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,433
So oh, boy, when you
told me it was real,

1356
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:45,233
see, that's how it's
supposed to feel.

1357
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:46,900
Something is definitely
wrong with you.

1358
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:49,967
I mean, I would say we should
get you checked out, but like,

1359
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,600
by who?

1360
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:53,734
Thank you.

1361
00:57:53,834 --> 00:57:57,967
So are they in the
room right now?

1362
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,367
They most definitely are.

1363
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:05,033
Even the handsome
one with the ascot?

1364
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:08,166
Oh, isn't she delightful?

1365
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,500
Oh, the ascot is here.

1366
00:58:10,633 --> 00:58:11,633
So.

1367
00:58:11,734 --> 00:58:12,767
So.

1368
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,700
So.

1369
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:15,834
So.

1370
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:19,200
Peter.

1371
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:19,934
Oh, yes, as in, so
what do you want?

1372
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:21,066
Right.

1373
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,400
We would like your help.

1374
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:30,100
I think we need a statement
for the press, you and Peter

1375
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:31,033
together.

1376
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:33,133
It won't be necessary.

1377
00:58:33,266 --> 00:58:34,767
It's simple.

1378
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,100
I changed my mind.

1379
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,166
That's weird.

1380
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:39,967
What time is it?

1381
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,667
No one should be
arriving until...

1382
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,533
Oh, hello.

1383
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:43,934
Merry Christmas.

1384
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:45,100
Oh, Merry Christmas.

1385
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:49,834
Oh, Robert Baron.

1386
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:50,834
Susan Kraine.

1387
00:58:50,967 --> 00:58:52,600
Yes.

1388
00:58:52,734 --> 00:58:54,700
Oh, I hope this isn't
too much of an intrusion.

1389
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:55,834
Not at all.

1390
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:57,533
What can I...

1391
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:58,367
You know, I know this
must sound very strange,

1392
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,700
but you have such
a wonderful son.

1393
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:03,166
Peter?

1394
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,700
Peter, yes.

1395
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:07,266
He tracked me down and asked
would I consider singing

1396
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,700
at your Christmas Eve party.

1397
00:59:09,834 --> 00:59:10,200
He what?

1398
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,734
He did.

1399
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:13,376
And then when he told me
that you were a fan of mine,

1400
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,400
I said no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1401
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:22,200
I am the fan of you,
you silly goose.

1402
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:25,367
Oh, I loved your father.

1403
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,166
You knew my father?

1404
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,367
M-hm.

1405
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,676
What he did at that
community center

1406
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,834
all those years,
oh, what a love.

1407
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,834
And I'm sure that you have got
that same charitable streak.

1408
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:38,934
And as it turns out,
Christmas Eve parties

1409
00:59:39,066 --> 00:59:44,533
are my absolute favorite event
to play, if you would have me.

1410
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:53,333
Sleigh bells through the town.

1411
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:57,367
Hear the carols singing loud.

1412
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,333
All I want for
Christmas is you here.

1413
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:04,266
Your love is like a gift
all through the year.

1414
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:11,900
Deck the halls of my heart.

1415
01:00:12,033 --> 01:00:13,767
That was beautiful.

1416
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,900
Thank you.

1417
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:17,567
Wow, that is the cheeriest
I've ever seen my father.

1418
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,940
Then I guess it's now or never.

1419
01:00:19,066 --> 01:00:20,734
OK.

1420
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:21,433
Wish me luck.

1421
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:22,734
Oh, we're coming with you.

1422
01:00:22,867 --> 01:00:23,934
OK.

1423
01:00:24,066 --> 01:00:25,700
Yeah, great.

1424
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:28,400
So just remember, talk about
the personal, not about work.

1425
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:30,333
And you really
gotta push the past.

1426
01:00:30,467 --> 01:00:32,333
OK, wait to see a
tear before you...

1427
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:33,867
Actually, I know it.

1428
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So sorry.

1429
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:35,533
I think I got it, guys.

1430
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:35,900
OK.

1431
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:37,500
I'm good.

1432
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:39,934
I got it.

1433
01:00:40,066 --> 01:00:41,100
Oh, ain't that the truth?

1434
01:00:41,233 --> 01:00:42,700
That's the truth.

1435
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:43,834
Exactly.

1436
01:00:43,867 --> 01:00:44,900
Hi.

1437
01:00:45,033 --> 01:00:45,433
Hi.

1438
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:46,767
Dad.

1439
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:47,934
Susan, I mean, amazing.

1440
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:48,900
Thank you so much.

1441
01:00:49,033 --> 01:00:49,700
No.

1442
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:50,033
No.

1443
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:50,767
No.

1444
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:51,400
Thank you.

1445
01:00:51,533 --> 01:00:52,567
Thank you for asking me.

1446
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,333
You know your dad
and I were just

1447
01:00:54,467 --> 01:00:57,834
discussing how easy it is to
forget what Christmas is really

1448
01:00:57,967 --> 01:01:00,767
all about.

1449
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,433
Family.

1450
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:01,934
Yes.

1451
01:01:02,066 --> 01:01:03,467
Yeah, family.

1452
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,266
Yes, if you think
about the Christmases

1453
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,433
of your past and
you compare them

1454
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:09,433
to the Christmases
of the present

1455
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:12,100
and then you ask
yourself, what do

1456
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:15,066
I want the Christmases of
my future to look like,

1457
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,734
and it all comes back to...

1458
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:18,600
Families.

1459
01:01:18,734 --> 01:01:19,066
Yeah.

1460
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:19,967
Yeah, right.

1461
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,100
I mean, it's just so...

1462
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,233
They're so right.

1463
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:25,066
Well, you know what,
I am going to go

1464
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,633
get myself an adult beverage.

1465
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,767
Oh, yes.

1466
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,967
Please, why don't you just...

1467
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,333
You too talk about...

1468
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:35,166
Well, important things.

1469
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,300
Great.

1470
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:42,000
Yeah, she's lovely.

1471
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:43,967
I'm surprised you came.

1472
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,066
Well, it's Christmas Eve.

1473
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,300
I think it's going well.

1474
01:01:48,433 --> 01:01:49,953
Right, don't you
think it's going well?

1475
01:01:50,066 --> 01:01:51,166
Because I can't trust you.

1476
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,667
How can you even say that to me?

1477
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,800
Oh, yeah.

1478
01:01:53,934 --> 01:01:54,934
Just peachy.

1479
01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:57,266
You don't know the value
of fiscal responsibility.

1480
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,467
You don't know the
value of people, Dad.

1481
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,867
Excuse me.

1482
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,567
Peter, just wait.

1483
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:05,700
OK.

1484
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:11,166
Peter.

1485
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,066
Katherine.

1486
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:13,734
I can't.

1487
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:14,567
I'm done.

1488
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,700
I just can't with him.

1489
01:02:15,834 --> 01:02:17,533
Will you please just talk to me.

1490
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,734
Everything was fine
until you showed up.

1491
01:02:19,867 --> 01:02:20,567
I was fine.

1492
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,066
Were yo?

1493
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,967
Yes, I was fine.

1494
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,800
I was doing what I was supposed
to be doing, what I was raised

1495
01:02:25,934 --> 01:02:28,333
to deal, which is just keep
my head down and my emotions

1496
01:02:28,467 --> 01:02:30,507
in check because they only
ever get me into trouble.

1497
01:02:30,633 --> 01:02:31,667
Oh, Peter, stop.

1498
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,500
Please, people are
looking at you.

1499
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:35,467
I know people are
looking at me because I'm

1500
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,900
talking to a ghost in
the middle of the day.

1501
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,834
Let's go.

1502
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:53,867
Go where, my dear?

1503
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,300
Home.

1504
01:02:55,433 --> 01:02:56,734
We don't belong here.

1505
01:02:56,867 --> 01:02:59,033
Look, I know it's hard
to believe right now,

1506
01:02:59,166 --> 01:02:59,867
but everything is...

1507
01:03:00,066 --> 01:03:01,767
As it should be?

1508
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,400
Come on.

1509
01:03:03,533 --> 01:03:05,700
What is any of this even for?

1510
01:03:05,834 --> 01:03:07,600
What are we doing here?

1511
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:09,233
Peter doesn't need us.

1512
01:03:09,367 --> 01:03:10,467
Robert can't hear us.

1513
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,767
Nothing makes any sense.

1514
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:16,233
Because it's not about them.

1515
01:03:16,367 --> 01:03:17,600
No time to explain.

1516
01:03:17,734 --> 01:03:19,066
Do you know where Peter went?

1517
01:03:30,934 --> 01:03:31,934
No.

1518
01:03:34,066 --> 01:03:35,867
No need to talk, Peter.

1519
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,767
I have no intention of
being the first ghost

1520
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,400
to get someone institutionalized.

1521
01:03:41,533 --> 01:03:43,400
I can't take your
dad to the past.

1522
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:45,266
Yeah, I know.

1523
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,633
But I can take you back again.

1524
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:51,967
There's something
I want you to see.

1525
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,133
No, thanks.

1526
01:03:53,266 --> 01:03:54,667
I'm not really asking, Peter.

1527
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:05,000
It would be cold outside.

1528
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,433
My heart so is warm.

1529
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:13,467
We're searching all our
lives, but all I really want.

1530
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,700
Wait, is this...

1531
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:17,100
No, this is wrong.

1532
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:18,667
This is my past.

1533
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,867
It's Peter's past as well.

1534
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,467
Just you.

1535
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,967
Just you, baby.

1536
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:33,367
Keep watching.

1537
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:39,700
All our lives,
but all I really want.

1538
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,533
Bets.

1539
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:44,900
Is that Grandma Betsy?

1540
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:46,734
Betsy Wilkins was your grandma?

1541
01:04:46,867 --> 01:04:49,333
Wilkins was her maiden name.

1542
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:51,166
She was my best friend.

1543
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,066
We grew up together.

1544
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:53,767
Wait.

1545
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:54,500
Wait.

1546
01:04:54,633 --> 01:04:55,934
So this means, are you here?

1547
01:04:56,066 --> 01:04:57,767
Well, I will be.

1548
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,200
I'll be coming through.

1549
01:05:06,767 --> 01:05:08,633
I used to meet her every
night after her shift,

1550
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:10,066
so we could walk home together.

1551
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,266
Hey, good to see you guys.

1552
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,409
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

1553
01:05:13,433 --> 01:05:15,300
Merry Christmas, Gabe.

1554
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:15,967
Hungry?

1555
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,100
Oh, starved.

1556
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:19,000
How about a grilled
cheese to go.

1557
01:05:19,133 --> 01:05:20,600
You bet.

1558
01:05:20,734 --> 01:05:21,467
Kat.

1559
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,100
Hey.

1560
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:25,313
I've got two more tables,
and then we're out of here.

1561
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:26,367
Take your time.

1562
01:05:32,533 --> 01:05:33,333
There you go.

1563
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:34,233
How's clerical school?

1564
01:05:34,367 --> 01:05:35,400
Thank you.

1565
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:37,066
It's all right.

1566
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,066
Not the dream, huh?

1567
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,000
I'll be glad to
have the work, but I

1568
01:05:41,133 --> 01:05:42,233
think that's all it'll be.

1569
01:05:42,367 --> 01:05:43,647
There's nothing wrong with work.

1570
01:05:43,767 --> 01:05:44,767
Never mind.

1571
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,333
No, it's going to sound silly.

1572
01:05:46,467 --> 01:05:47,767
Try me.

1573
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,266
Ah.

1574
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,080
Well, I just feel like
there's so much more

1575
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,066
that I could be doing for the
world to make a difference.

1576
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,633
So what are you waiting for?

1577
01:05:55,767 --> 01:05:57,000
I don't know.

1578
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:59,433
I just feel like I
have to figure out how.

1579
01:05:59,567 --> 01:06:00,934
There's no time
like the present.

1580
01:06:13,433 --> 01:06:14,300
I'm freezing.

1581
01:06:14,433 --> 01:06:17,333
Let's go.

1582
01:06:17,467 --> 01:06:19,900
And then he actually
snapped his fingers at me.

1583
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:21,033
What?

1584
01:06:21,133 --> 01:06:22,633
I can't believe...
Can you believe

1585
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:24,576
the gall of that man to
assume that I'd be there just

1586
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,967
to serve him.

1587
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,009
I wanted to say, listen,
mister, get your own drink.

1588
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:29,300
I didn't, of course?

1589
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:29,900
Hi.

1590
01:06:30,033 --> 01:06:30,734
Oh, here you go.

1591
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:32,133
This is for you.

1592
01:06:32,266 --> 01:06:34,300
And I'm so sorry this is
all I have for tonight.

1593
01:06:34,433 --> 01:06:35,300
Thank you, Katherine.

1594
01:06:35,433 --> 01:06:36,033
Don't you be sorry.

1595
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:36,900
You're an angel.

1596
01:06:37,033 --> 01:06:38,533
Merry Christmas.

1597
01:06:38,667 --> 01:06:39,867
Merry Christmas.

1598
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,133
Merry Christmas.

1599
01:06:41,266 --> 01:06:44,066
Goodnight.

1600
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,333
Ooh, did that man
get on my last nerve.

1601
01:06:47,467 --> 01:06:48,467
If he comes in again...

1602
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,776
I think it's
terrible that anyone

1603
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,700
should have to live that way.

1604
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:55,066
It's going to be
so cold tonight.

1605
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,360
I wish they could spend the
night in the Rootie Tootie,

1606
01:06:57,433 --> 01:06:58,967
you know?

1607
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,409
I mean, why should it sit
empty all night when people

1608
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,800
are sleeping in the street?

1609
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,133
That's a very good question.

1610
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:05,367
You should ask Gabe.

1611
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,780
He's into all that
charity stuff.

1612
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,800
Yeah.

1613
01:07:09,934 --> 01:07:11,734
Good, this place
is finally open.

1614
01:07:14,767 --> 01:07:15,633
Grandpa Bob.

1615
01:07:15,767 --> 01:07:17,033
Grandpa Bob?

1616
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:17,867
No way.

1617
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,433
All the home.

1618
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:20,700
Thank you.

1619
01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:21,600
Hi, there.

1620
01:07:21,734 --> 01:07:22,734
I'm in need of some gum.

1621
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:23,934
Well, you're in luck.

1622
01:07:24,066 --> 01:07:27,200
Gum is something
I've got plenty of.

1623
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:29,800
Grandpa Bob, you rascal.

1624
01:07:29,934 --> 01:07:31,066
Cold out there.

1625
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,509
Yeah, how much are
these blankets?

1626
01:07:32,533 --> 01:07:34,066
$5 even.

1627
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,400
You can't spend everything
you've got on other people.

1628
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:37,600
They could freeze.

1629
01:07:37,734 --> 01:07:39,200
There's a family over there.

1630
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:41,400
Kat already gave
them her dinner.

1631
01:07:41,533 --> 01:07:42,400
It's Christmas.

1632
01:07:42,533 --> 01:07:44,300
Everyone deserves a warm meal.

1633
01:07:44,433 --> 01:07:45,433
It's on me.

1634
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:46,867
Really?

1635
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,867
Wow, that is so kind.

1636
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,400
What about it?

1637
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,076
I've got some produce in
back that's going to go bad.

1638
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,340
I know it would go to good use.

1639
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,033
Well, he's dreamy, isn't he?

1640
01:07:59,166 --> 01:07:59,934
What do you think?

1641
01:08:00,133 --> 01:08:01,700
You think he likes me?

1642
01:08:01,834 --> 01:08:03,609
Betsy, I've always said there's
not a soul alive whose heart

1643
01:08:03,633 --> 01:08:04,743
you couldn't make beat faster.

1644
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:05,767
Faster.

1645
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,667
Wow.

1646
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:10,500
Thank you.

1647
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:11,500
And no need to thank me.

1648
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:13,133
I should do this more often.

1649
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:14,876
He'd be sick at how much
food ends up in the trash.

1650
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:19,667
Well then, maybe we should start
stopping by here every night.

1651
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,100
Oh, shoot.

1652
01:08:21,233 --> 01:08:23,467
I just realized I forgot
to pick up my tips.

1653
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,720
I can run those things over.

1654
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:25,200
Oh, no.

1655
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:25,700
No.

1656
01:08:25,834 --> 01:08:26,266
No.

1657
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:26,934
It's OK.

1658
01:08:27,066 --> 01:08:27,500
I'll do it.

1659
01:08:27,633 --> 01:08:28,934
I'll do it.

1660
01:08:29,066 --> 01:08:29,934
I want to run that
idea by Gabe anyway.

1661
01:08:30,066 --> 01:08:31,967
No time like the present, right?

1662
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:32,867
Thank you.

1663
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,767
I will just take that.

1664
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,300
Oh, gosh.

1665
01:08:35,433 --> 01:08:37,033
Thank you.

1666
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:39,300
I trust you won't get into
any trouble while I'm gone.

1667
01:08:39,433 --> 01:08:41,133
Have I ever?

1668
01:08:41,266 --> 01:08:44,367
It was nice meeting you.

1669
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,500
So we have 13 different
flavors and 7 different shapes.

1670
01:08:49,633 --> 01:08:52,533
My personal favorite...

1671
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:53,667
Go.

1672
01:09:09,133 --> 01:09:11,033
You died on Christmas.

1673
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:12,667
Yeah, we all did.

1674
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,200
That's how it works.

1675
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,100
Bet you didn't catch that, huh?

1676
01:09:16,233 --> 01:09:17,233
No.

1677
01:09:20,066 --> 01:09:23,433
I mean, I always wondered.

1678
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:26,533
I hope it wasn't a
mistake bringing you here.

1679
01:09:29,033 --> 01:09:31,934
No, it wasn't.

1680
01:09:32,066 --> 01:09:33,767
I'm just glad it was
me and not Betsy.

1681
01:09:37,867 --> 01:09:40,533
I'm glad you are here.

1682
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:42,533
Me too.

1683
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:45,166
We have one more stop to make.

1684
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,300
OK.

1685
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,734
Katherine Marley was a very
special part of our community.

1686
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:03,100
And ever since she passed
away, a year ago now,

1687
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:04,633
we've been trying
to figure out what

1688
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,200
we could do to celebrate her.

1689
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:08,600
That's why you look so
familiar when we first met.

1690
01:10:08,734 --> 01:10:10,867
That picture was on the
table at the community

1691
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,367
center at all times.

1692
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,433
Oh, I can't believe
I never asked

1693
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:17,166
my grandfather who you were.

1694
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:21,700
Now, to kick things off, I'm
going to call up Betsy Wilkins.

1695
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:23,734
Excuse me, Betsy Baron.

1696
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:36,900
Kat was my best friend, best
person I have ever known,

1697
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:39,567
always thinking
about everybody else.

1698
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,600
She died trying to help
people on Christmas,

1699
01:10:43,734 --> 01:10:46,367
and Kat was going to
help a lot more people.

1700
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:51,900
She just needed time
to figure out how.

1701
01:10:52,033 --> 01:10:55,433
And see, I don't really
believe in accidents.

1702
01:10:55,567 --> 01:11:00,166
I think all is as it
should be, but that's

1703
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:05,133
so hard to understand when
something like this happens.

1704
01:11:05,266 --> 01:11:08,767
But maybe, if the rest
of us live our lives

1705
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:14,834
just a bit more like Kat,
it'll start to make sense.

1706
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:16,834
So today we're
announcing that we

1707
01:11:16,967 --> 01:11:19,900
bought a little piece of
land right across the street,

1708
01:11:20,033 --> 01:11:21,943
and we're going to build a
community center over there

1709
01:11:21,967 --> 01:11:24,000
in Kat's honor.

1710
01:11:24,133 --> 01:11:26,633
She's our angel now.

1711
01:11:26,767 --> 01:11:30,333
So that's what it'll be
called, the Frog Hollow Angel.

1712
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:33,767
You know, Kat...

1713
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:53,867
Oh, I wish I knew
what else she wrote.

1714
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:02,033
So when the Frog
Hollow Angel closed,

1715
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:03,646
everything got stored
in the basement.

1716
01:12:09,834 --> 01:12:12,367
Newspapers, don't need those.

1717
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,200
Wait.

1718
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:16,533
Oh, wow, that's wild.

1719
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:19,233
Moment of Truth.

1720
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:20,567
Please, please be there.

1721
01:12:23,834 --> 01:12:26,700
Oh, Betsy.

1722
01:12:26,834 --> 01:12:27,834
Be careful.

1723
01:12:31,433 --> 01:12:35,567
Regardless, as it should
be, to cross the street.

1724
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Any luck?

1725
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,133
He's not in here.

1726
01:12:52,266 --> 01:12:53,433
OK.

1727
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:55,100
I bet you he's in
his grumpy place.

1728
01:12:55,233 --> 01:12:56,300
He has a grumpy place?

1729
01:12:56,433 --> 01:12:57,567
Yeah.

1730
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,433
I thought that was
just his resting state.

1731
01:13:01,834 --> 01:13:02,867
Yep, see.

1732
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,200
There he is.

1733
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,767
OK.

1734
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:08,166
Well, I'm going to go.

1735
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,867
Give you guys some privacy.

1736
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,867
Oh, you sure you don't want
to stay behind and push me

1737
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,133
onto the tracks?

1738
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,467
You know, I'm not worried.

1739
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:16,967
Why?

1740
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,700
He's your dad.

1741
01:13:18,834 --> 01:13:22,467
So all of that good
stuff has to be there.

1742
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,166
Yeah.

1743
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,300
Just speak from the heart.

1744
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:28,433
And remember that no
matter what happens,

1745
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:30,200
all is as it should be.

1746
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:31,800
It sounds a bit like destiny.

1747
01:13:31,934 --> 01:13:33,133
Maybe it is.

1748
01:13:54,567 --> 01:14:01,133
Dad, I know you think that I
idolized grandpa, and I did.

1749
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:07,734
I always idolized you more.

1750
01:14:07,867 --> 01:14:09,734
I did.

1751
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:11,827
Why do you think I even
took a job at the company?

1752
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:15,973
I just wanted to spend
more time with you.

1753
01:14:18,867 --> 01:14:20,587
But I can't pretend to
be something I'm not,

1754
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,700
and I don't want to
take over the business.

1755
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:26,000
Yes, you made that
perfectly clear.

1756
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:28,600
But that doesn't mean that I
don't want to be a part of it.

1757
01:14:32,066 --> 01:14:35,734
You always said that this
was a family business, right?

1758
01:14:35,867 --> 01:14:39,567
And that part always confused
me because I don't say,

1759
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:43,367
I always thought it was more of
a marketing ploy than anything.

1760
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,834
But I'm starting to
think that maybe you

1761
01:14:45,967 --> 01:14:49,900
called it that because that's
what you wanted it to be.

1762
01:14:50,033 --> 01:14:54,533
Maybe that's why you never sold
off that block in Frog Hollow.

1763
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:58,400
Maybe you got into
the grocery business

1764
01:14:58,533 --> 01:15:00,700
so that you could spend
more time with your dad.

1765
01:15:03,767 --> 01:15:07,900
My dad gave away everything
he had to strangers,

1766
01:15:08,033 --> 01:15:14,667
not just money, his time,
his love, all of it.

1767
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,633
I may not be perfect,
but everything I've done

1768
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,647
has been informative for
you, so you would never

1769
01:15:18,734 --> 01:15:21,800
have to worry the way I did.

1770
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,667
You have no idea
what that's like.

1771
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,000
You're right.

1772
01:15:26,133 --> 01:15:28,433
I don't.

1773
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:32,667
And I'm very, very lucky.

1774
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,467
Dad, there are so many
people out there spend

1775
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:41,066
their whole lives
worrying like you did.

1776
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:45,000
So why can't we be the family
that takes care of each other

1777
01:15:45,133 --> 01:15:46,467
and takes care of other people?

1778
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:51,233
I have a proposal for you.

1779
01:15:51,367 --> 01:15:55,600
I think that we should carry
out grandma and grandpa's dream

1780
01:15:55,734 --> 01:15:58,400
and turn the Rootie
Tootie into a gathering

1781
01:15:58,533 --> 01:16:01,667
place for the whole
community, and I

1782
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,066
think we should do it together.

1783
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,700
That's why you're here?

1784
01:16:05,834 --> 01:16:08,467
No, I'm here because I
want to make you proud,

1785
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,367
and I want to make
Grandpa proud,

1786
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,700
and I wanna make myself proud.

1787
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,967
And you know who else
want to make proud?

1788
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,100
Grandma.

1789
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:28,900
I never really knew
her, but I wish I had.

1790
01:16:29,033 --> 01:16:30,533
For Kat.

1791
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:32,867
That was her friend.

1792
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,033
Died young, I think.

1793
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:36,900
Where did you find this?

1794
01:16:37,033 --> 01:16:38,900
Read it.

1795
01:16:39,033 --> 01:16:40,900
And if you're still
interested in what

1796
01:16:41,033 --> 01:16:44,133
I think you and I could build
together, I'd love to tell you,

1797
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:48,834
Dad, it's not just my
legacy, it's yours too.

1798
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:08,734
Kat was my best friend,
best person I've ever known,

1799
01:17:08,867 --> 01:17:11,800
always thinking
about everybody else.

1800
01:17:11,934 --> 01:17:15,633
She died trying to help
people on Christmas,

1801
01:17:15,767 --> 01:17:18,200
and Kat was going to
help a lot more people.

1802
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:21,600
She just needed time
to figure out how.

1803
01:17:21,734 --> 01:17:25,567
And see, I don't really
believe in accidents.

1804
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:29,900
I think all is as it
should be, but that's

1805
01:17:30,033 --> 01:17:34,066
so hard to understand when
something like this happens.

1806
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,333
Maybe if the rest of us live our
lives just a bit more like Kat,

1807
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:41,400
it'll start to make sense.

1808
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:42,967
So today we're
announcing that we

1809
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,800
bought a little piece of
land right across the street,

1810
01:17:45,934 --> 01:17:48,400
and we're going to build a
community center over there

1811
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:49,600
in Kat's honor.

1812
01:17:49,734 --> 01:17:53,500
She's our angel now, so
that's what it'll be called,

1813
01:17:53,633 --> 01:17:56,233
the Frog Hollow Angel.

1814
01:17:56,367 --> 01:18:00,300
You know, Kat was there
when I met my husband, Bob,

1815
01:18:00,433 --> 01:18:04,567
and we just found out that we're
having a little one of our own.

1816
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:08,400
I hope we raise this baby to be
as loving and generous as Kat

1817
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:11,166
was every day of her life.

1818
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,900
Because it wasn't
just on Christmas

1819
01:18:13,033 --> 01:18:16,667
that she was an angel,
it was every day.

1820
01:18:32,767 --> 01:18:35,300
So it looks like this
is actually the...

1821
01:18:35,433 --> 01:18:38,467
Yeah, I guess so.

1822
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,400
Are you going to the
carousel tonight?

1823
01:18:42,533 --> 01:18:44,200
You know what,
don't answer that.

1824
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:48,133
I'm not going, Katherine.

1825
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:51,667
I don't really understand
what any of this means,

1826
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:57,200
but I do know this one
very important thing, which

1827
01:18:57,333 --> 01:19:01,734
is that you are somebody
that I could love,

1828
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:04,934
and I think that you
could love me too.

1829
01:19:05,066 --> 01:19:06,567
Now, that I know
that that's possible,

1830
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,367
I don't ever want to settle.

1831
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,900
And if I never feel this
way again, then at least

1832
01:19:13,033 --> 01:19:20,200
I felt it once, this
really kind, funny,

1833
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:23,000
and beautiful ghost.

1834
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:31,066
Go.

1835
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:48,400
All right.

1836
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:49,900
Not so fast, my dear.

1837
01:19:50,033 --> 01:19:50,734
Not so fast?

1838
01:19:50,867 --> 01:19:51,967
We have 5 minutes.

1839
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,100
You know, in all my
years as a ghost,

1840
01:19:54,233 --> 01:19:56,934
never have I ever finished
a Christmas season

1841
01:19:57,066 --> 01:19:59,934
without a visit to the future.

1842
01:20:00,066 --> 01:20:02,300
Who are you going to
take to the future?

1843
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:05,300
Please tell me right now
that you realize that you

1844
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:06,800
were always the assignment.

1845
01:20:12,667 --> 01:20:14,033
Te

1846
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:16,246
Just so I can see all the
people I'm going to scrooge

1847
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:17,367
and how I'll help them?

1848
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,767
Well, that's one future.

1849
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,409
Sure, I can take you
there if you like.

1850
01:20:20,433 --> 01:20:21,800
You got 2 minutes, Roy.

1851
01:20:21,934 --> 01:20:23,600
But why would I
take you to a future

1852
01:20:23,734 --> 01:20:25,200
that you could already imagine?

1853
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,300
Oh, that's...

1854
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:39,333
I can't.

1855
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:40,533
I can't have any of that.

1856
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:42,133
Why would you show it to me?

1857
01:20:42,266 --> 01:20:43,810
All I can tell you is
that if you could see it,

1858
01:20:43,834 --> 01:20:45,367
it must exist somewhere.

1859
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,934
60 seconds.

1860
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:48,946
But be brave enough to
see where you want to go.

1861
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,266
OK.

1862
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:05,700
I know where I want to go.

1863
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,233
That never gets any less awful.

1864
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:15,734
You think they'd find a
gentler way to transport us.

1865
01:21:15,867 --> 01:21:18,867
So what's the verdict?

1866
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,834
Don't worry, Charlie.

1867
01:21:19,967 --> 01:21:20,967
We cleaned up your mess.

1868
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,200
Oh, that's a relief.

1869
01:21:24,333 --> 01:21:26,200
Well then, allow me.

1870
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,100
Are we coming, or...

1871
01:21:32,233 --> 01:21:35,900
I hope whatever is through
there is exactly what you want.

1872
01:21:36,033 --> 01:21:39,500
Roy, I wish you
could come with me.

1873
01:21:39,633 --> 01:21:42,133
I'll be with you every
step of the way, my dear.

1874
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:47,700
And Arlene.

1875
01:21:47,834 --> 01:21:51,667
Oh, no need for a scene.

1876
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:52,233
Thank you.

1877
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:53,700
For what?

1878
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:54,667
Just for being you.

1879
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,867
All right.

1880
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,500
Well, before I get
downright soggy...

1881
01:21:58,633 --> 01:22:00,100
Bye.

1882
01:22:00,233 --> 01:22:02,800
So you're really going to do it.

1883
01:22:02,934 --> 01:22:03,934
Yeah.

1884
01:22:04,033 --> 01:22:05,834
Oh, thank goodness.

1885
01:22:05,967 --> 01:22:08,633
I tell you, this
was a hectic one.

1886
01:22:08,767 --> 01:22:10,567
Time, you know, it
is a funny thing.

1887
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,420
It would be so much
easier if it was linear,

1888
01:22:12,533 --> 01:22:15,000
but as it is, sometimes we need
to speed someone up or slow

1889
01:22:15,133 --> 01:22:17,443
someone else down just to make
sure that all souls are where

1890
01:22:17,467 --> 01:22:19,707
they're supposed to be when
they're supposed to be their.

1891
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,333
Souls as in soulmates.

1892
01:22:23,467 --> 01:22:24,767
Am I speaking kangaroo?

1893
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,767
Yes, soulmates.

1894
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,780
You don't even want to
know all the strings that

1895
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,934
got pulled last year so
that boy could see you.

1896
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:32,934
And then remember you?

1897
01:22:33,066 --> 01:22:35,600
You know what,
forget I said that.

1898
01:22:35,734 --> 01:22:37,400
Take good care, Katherine.

1899
01:22:37,533 --> 01:22:38,533
Thank you, Charlie.

1900
01:23:23,133 --> 01:23:25,000
Hello.

1901
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,800
Oh, hey there.

1902
01:23:26,934 --> 01:23:27,934
Hi.

1903
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,567
Sorry, do I know you?

1904
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:34,533
Yeah, you look really familiar.

1905
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:36,367
Hm.

1906
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,000
Are you lost or...

1907
01:23:38,133 --> 01:23:39,367
No.

1908
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,834
You're not looking for anyone.

1909
01:23:41,967 --> 01:23:43,633
And I found exactly
who I'm looking for.

1910
01:23:43,767 --> 01:23:46,400
It's OK.

1911
01:23:46,533 --> 01:23:48,033
So what do you think?

1912
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:50,033
I think it's going
to be a lot of work.

1913
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:51,667
Yeah.

1914
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,967
And a lot of fun.

1915
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,633
Yeah.

1916
01:23:54,767 --> 01:23:57,934
And I think it's probably our
destinies, so let's do it.

1917
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,600
Merry Christmas.

1918
01:24:09,667 --> 01:24:10,667
Merry Christmas.

1919
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:11,700
There you go.

1920
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:12,533
Something to eat.

1921
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:15,767
Make yourself at home.

1922
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:19,934
All I want for
Christmas is you here.

1923
01:24:20,066 --> 01:24:23,133
Your love is like a gift
all through the year.

1924
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:31,266
Deck the halls of my heart
because on Christmas...

1925
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,066
Hey, how's it going?

1926
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,934
Great.

1927
01:24:36,066 --> 01:24:37,767
Hey, question, who's that?

1928
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,100
Oh, that's Betsy.

1929
01:24:39,233 --> 01:24:40,753
You see, this place
is named after her.

1930
01:24:40,834 --> 01:24:42,367
She's the Frog Hollow Angel?

1931
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,500
That's right.

1932
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:45,867
Hi.

1933
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,100
Hey.

1934
01:24:47,233 --> 01:24:49,266
I just wanted to
bring you some food.

1935
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,367
Oh, thank you.

1936
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,867
My parents would be
incredibly proud.

1937
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,700
Oh, well, thank you.

1938
01:24:55,834 --> 01:24:56,834
No, I meant of me.

1939
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:06,934
Thank you, Peter,
for all of this.

1940
01:25:07,066 --> 01:25:10,033
Yeah, of course.

1941
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:11,867
Merry Christmas.

1942
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,266
Merry Christmas.

1943
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,633
All I want for
Christmas is you here.

1944
01:25:15,767 --> 01:25:18,667
Your love is like a gift
all through the year.

1945
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:24,233
Deck the halls of my heart.

1946
01:25:27,567 --> 01:25:34,967
'Cause on Christmas,
I need you by my side.

1947
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,200
Won't you be my Christmas angel.

1948
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:40,700
So wanna dance?

1949
01:25:40,834 --> 01:25:43,033
Absolutely.

1950
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:44,967
Angel.

1951
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,200
Angel.

1952
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:48,767
My angel.

1953
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,633
Angel.
