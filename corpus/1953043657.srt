- I haven't seen her in a while.

737
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,668
- I'll be back, okay?.

738
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:47,848
- [sighs]

739
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,895
- I thought you might come here.

740
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,200
- It's kind of my last shot.

741
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:03,500
- You're being a dumb-ass,
you know.

742
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,064
This girl isn't just gonna
disappear

743
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,871
from the Earth when the sun
comes up.

744
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,502
Maybe she'll be in school.

745
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,536
Or maybe she'll be
at the parade.

746
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,877
- What if she's not?.

747
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:16,140
- Oh, well.

748
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,867
- [whispers]
Shit.

749
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:13,065
[girls shouting]

750
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:15,769
- Bitch.

751
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:28,791
- That's not what I expected.

752
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,524
- What happened?.

753
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:37,624
- It's nothing.

754
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:38,656
- Let me see.

755
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:40,827
You cut yourself.

756
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,633
- It's fine.

757
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:45,197
- You should wash it out.

758
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,401
- I guess.

759
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:55,482
- Did you ever think that...

760
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,487
- What?.

761
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,013
- Nothing.

762
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,166
- Hey, Jen.

763
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,193
- What the hell are you guys
doing out here?.

764
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:19,238
- I don't know.

765
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:20,833
What are you doing?.

766
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:24,574
- We're going to some tunnels
one of the girls heard about.

767
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,707
- It's a make-out maze.

768
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,541
- Can we go?.

769
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:31,216
- Um...

770
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,182
[water splashing]

771
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:44,531
- Be careful, Ady.

772
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:45,932
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

773
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:50,403
- Do you have any change on you?.

774
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,965
- What, like a quarter?.

775
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,101
- No, a penny.

776
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,079
splash!

777
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,112
- Was that a wish?.

778
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,749
- Could be.

779
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,851
- I don't think swimming pools
have the same magical effects

780
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,452
as a wishing well.

781
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,964
- You don't know very much.

782
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:24,734
Tell me if it works out for you.

783
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,708
- I will.

784
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,973
- You came here to see us,
didn't you?.

785
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,343
Tell the truth.

786
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:38,976
- Yeah.

787
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,190
- Why?.

788
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,965
- I remember this moment.

789
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:01,465
I remember talking
to you both

790
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:05,277
and thinking that I liked you.

791
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:06,679
- You had a crush on me?.

792
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,081
- No.

793
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,141
Yeah.

794
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,745
I mean, both of you.

795
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,255
I...

796
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,086
I had a crush on both of you.

797
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,921
- You can't like both of us.

798
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,223
- You were always together.

799
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,627
We talked as a group.

800
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,528
It's totally possible.

801
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:24,396
- We're not the same person.

802
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:26,833
- Even if we both liked you,
we're not gonna triple date...

803
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:29,099
- Ménage à twin...

804
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,366
- Whatever.

805
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:31,771
- I know.

806
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,298
I know.

807
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,331
- What did you expect?.

808
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:37,039
Some kind of fantasy
twin blow job?.

809
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:40,344
- No, I didn't expect that,
but...

810
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:41,680
- [laughs]

811
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,945
- I'm sorry.
I know this is weird.

812
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,457
I've just been kind of
a mess lately.

813
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,120
And I saw this picture,

814
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,254
and it reminded me
of the fact that there might be

815
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,460
someone else out there
besides Kerri Sullivan

816
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,129
who I like or have
some kind of connection with.

817
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,101
I'm not stalking you.

818
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,343
Legally, I'm pretty sure
I'm not.

819
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,870
I just like you.

820
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:16,817
And as fourth-grade
as that sounds,

821
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:17,911
it's the truth.

822
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,397
- Buy us some beer
and we're cool.

823
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:33,200
- Okay.

824
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,013
- Hi.

825
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,787
- I hope you weren't taking
advantage of my friend.

826
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:00,895
- No.

827
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,797
- Good, 'cause I was ready
to beat the shit out of you.

828
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,992
- You probably could.

829
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:14,303
- Hi, Maggie.

830
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,334
- Hi, Beth.

831
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,277
- This is my new boyfriend.

832
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,478
- I see that.

833
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,292
- He's a good kisser.

834
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:37,425
- Is he?.

835
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:40,264
- Yeah.

836
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:41,292
- You kissed her?.

837
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,409
- I'll let you try him out
if you want.

838
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:55,116
- I don't know about that.

839
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:02,081
- Come sit here.

840
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:41,829
[dramatic piano music]

841
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:49,862
? ?

842
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,783
[knocking]

843
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:53,230
- What happened to your face?.

844
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:55,169
- I got hit.

845
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:57,331
- Why?.

846
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,364
- I kissed another girl's
boyfriend.

847
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,203
- You did?.

848
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,884
You breaking up with me?.

849
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,918
- Probably.

850
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:30,137
Did you know that Janelle Ramsey
keeps a diary?.

851
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,504
Who the fuck wears Mickey Mouse
underwear anyway?.

852
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,013
- I'm sorry.

853
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,776
- Yeah.

854
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,813
[thunder rumbling]

855
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:56,457
- Do you want to come inside?.

856
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,694
- No, I feel like running.

857
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:08,938
- Come on.

858
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:16,206
- If I spend the night,

859
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,812
it doesn't mean
that we're staying together.

860
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:21,788
- I know.

861
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:30,594
[rain splashing]

862
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:33,625
[thunder rumbling]

863
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:53,846
- Do you like me?.

864
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:56,686
- What?.

865
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:58,283
- Do you like Beth?.

866
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:00,989
- Maggie, don't get weird.

867
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,927
- I think I just fucked up.

868
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:08,269
- Great.

869
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,462
- Beth.

870
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:12,235
Wake up.

871
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:13,832
We got to go.

872
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,757
- You guys want
to hang out more?.

873
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,855
We could all go back
to my house.

874
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:05,149
[thunder rumbling]

875
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,953
- [laughing]

876
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:33,719
- Good luck.

877
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,452
- You too.

878
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:38,119
Don't get lost.

879
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:42,783
- Hi.

880
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:43,814
- Hi.

881
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,353
- Do you want to sit with me?.

882
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:53,528
- I actually have
a girlfriend, so...

883
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,036
- Oh.

884
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,030
I understand.

885
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,777
- I hope you find somebody
to sit with you.

886
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,147
- Thanks.

887
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:18,843
[knocking at door]

888
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,767
- It's too bad you never said
anything back then.

889
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:39,306
- Why?.

890
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,605
- One of us
had a big crush on you.

891
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:44,871
- One of you?.

892
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:46,847
- Yeah, one of us.

893
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:51,279
- Well, which one of you
liked me?.

894
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,380
- Which one of us do you like?.

895
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:56,983
- You can't say both.
It's not fair.

896
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,652
- Well, what if it's true?.

897
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:02,130
- Then we're not interested,
no matter what.

898
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,563
- Okay.

899
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:07,530
- [laughs]

900
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:14,166
- This is torture.

901
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:15,699
- Bathroom.

902
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,128
- Do you remember
this moment?.

903
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:36,887
- What about it?.

904
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:39,423
- You said something crappy
about Kerri,

905
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:42,460
and I got kind of upset.

906
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:44,335
- I'm sure I didn't mean
to upset you.

907
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,362
- I know.

908
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:48,638
It just seemed like you were
trying to tell me something,

909
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,407
Iike you knew something
about her that I didn't know.

910
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:54,745
- Oh, I don't remember.

911
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,251
Sometimes I just
spit things out.

912
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,516
I'm pretty intuitive.

913
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,820
It's the twin thing, I guess.

914
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,554
- What did your intuition
tell you?.

915
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:08,358
- She probably wasn't right
for you.

916
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,489
But you know that.

917
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,102
- I should've dated one of you.

918
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:17,770
- Do you know how many guys

919
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:20,775
have pulled this twin
fantasy bullshit?.
