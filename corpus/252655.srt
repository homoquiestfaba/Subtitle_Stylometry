1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,334
I had this image of you
inside of me...

2
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:01,315
like a part of me.

3
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,388
You planned this whole thing.

4
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:11,081
We make our own choice.
We pay our own prices.

5
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:13,355
Five years is a long time.

6
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:15,310
Where's the fuckin' money?

7
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:26,632
All part of the business.

8
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:28,613
You made a choice once.

9
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,662
What choice?

10
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,982
I want out.

11
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,367
Like a part of me.

12
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,114
Hold the elevator.

13
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,295
Thanks.

14
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:58,193
Yeah, I looked over everything, sir.

15
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:00,172
I don't think there should be
any problems.

16
00:03:01,592 --> 00:03:04,438
Yes, sir, I ordered the vanity
and I looked at the tub.

17
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:07,056
I'm pretty sure we can rout it out.

18
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,037
Yeah, I'll start everything
first thing tomorrow.

19
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:21,357
Thanks again for this opportunity,
Mr. Bianchini.

20
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,622
Yeah.

21
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:50,232
Hi.

22
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,048
My name is Violet.
We sort of met on the elevator.

23
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,444
I'm Corky.

24
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:59,769
I heard you working in here,
and I was wondering...

25
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:01,907
if you'd like a cup of coffee.

26
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:04,243
Sure.

27
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:05,689
Come on in.

28
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:07,543
Just give me a second.

29
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:08,952
All right.

30
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:16,632
What happened to Rajiv?

31
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:20,628
He went home to India or someplace,
but I think he'll be back.

32
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:23,570
So this is just
a temporary situation for you?

33
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:26,513
Yeah, pretty much.
One day at a time.

34
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,584
I guessed you're a straight black.

35
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:31,994
Good guess.

36
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,075
Thanks.

37
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,556
My pleasure.

38
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:39,602
To be honest, I did have
a slightly ulterior motive.

39
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,395
I was wondering if I might
ask you a little favor.

40
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:44,404
-Favor.
-Yeah.

41
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,934
I'm kind of a night person,
and I was wondering...

42
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:51,197
if you might wait a little bit
before you start using the power tools.

43
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:53,815
-Oh, sorry.
-Oh, no. No.

44
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:58,675
It's not your fault. It's just
the walls here are so terribly thin.

45
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:02,777
-Really.
-It's like you're in the same room.

46
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:05,018
If it's too much trouble,
I understand.

47
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:07,903
It's no trouble at all.
I got a lot to do here.

48
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,445
You doin' all the work yourself?

49
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:13,210
That is so amazing.

50
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:17,437
I am so in awe of people
who can fix things.

51
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:21,728
My dad was like that.
We never had anything new.

52
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:24,509
Whenever anything was broken,
he would just...

53
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:28,155
open it up, tinker with it
a little bit...

54
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,686
and fix it.

55
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,932
His hands were magic.

56
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:36,476
I'll bet your car
is 20 years old.

57
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:37,953
Truck.

58
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,872
Truck. Of course.

59
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:43,105
-'63 Chevy.
-I knew it.

60
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:51,228
Well, I guess I should be going.

61
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,632
You can drop the cup off
at any time.

62
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:57,341
Thanks.

63
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:00,543
My pleasure.

64
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,949
Well, well.

65
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:15,875
It's been a long time, Cork.

66
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,203
Five years, two months
and sixteen days.

67
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,557
-How you doin', Sue?
-Like shit.

68
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,345
Now that we're all caught up,
can I buy you a drink?

69
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:26,623
Thanks.

70
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:30,752
-* Friends keep tellin' me *
-Welcome home.

71
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:33,188
* That you ain't no good *

72
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:35,294
* But, oh, oh, they don't know *

73
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,275
Did you get a job yet?

74
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:40,699
Yeah. Some plumbing,
painting and shit.

75
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:44,801
I mean a J-O-B.
A real job.

76
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:48,901
No. Not for me, Sue.

77
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:52,229
I'm just here to get laid.

78
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:55,780
* I ain't never gonna *

79
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,537
* Love a man *

80
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:59,429
* The way that I *

81
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:01,383
* I love you *

82
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:08,674
* Some time ago I thought *

83
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:12,738
* You had run out of fools *

84
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,751
* But I was so wrong *

85
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:19,909
-Hi.
-Hello.

86
00:07:22,378 --> 00:07:24,165
Hey, Jesse,
what's happenin' here?

87
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:28,287
Wait. I know you.

88
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:31,240
I don't think so.

89
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:33,280
I didn't know you were out.

90
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:38,759
When you get tired
of Cagney and Lacey, find me.

91
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:41,477
* Don't you never never say
that we're through *

92
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:20,361
* Fast and slow
Night and day *

93
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,371
* When you stop to think *

94
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:25,162
* It just gets in the way *

95
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:28,296
* And there's not a single soul
among us *

96
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:34,760
Yeah.

97
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:36,238
Hey, Mr. Bianchini.

98
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:38,564
Everything's going just fine.

99
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:41,899
Yeah, I got the tub drain
all cleaned out.

100
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:46,285
What apartment?

101
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,228
Oh, no.

102
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,393
Shit! I didn't know
he would call you.

103
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,205
You must think
I'm a total nuisance.

104
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:04,742
Not exactly.

105
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,987
I'm sorry. I would
usually call Rajiv...

106
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:09,806
but I didn't know what to do,
so I called Mr. Bianchini.

107
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,638
-He said you lost something?
-Yeah.

108
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:15,691
Come on in.

109
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:25,900
I was doing the dishes, and just as I
pulled the stopper, my earring fell in.

110
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:29,352
That's why I got upset.
It's one of my favorites.

111
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:33,870
You got a pot or a bucket?

112
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:08,499
Did you find it?

113
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:15,604
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that.

114
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:18,932
I can't thank you enough.
You have to let me pay you something.

115
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,576
-No.
-No?

116
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:26,223
Told Bianchini I'd do it.
I did it.

117
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:29,228
If you won't take money,
how about a drink?

118
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,268
You can't work all night.

119
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:36,817
All right.

120
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:42,196
One drink.

121
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:44,238
What would you like?

122
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,028
Beer.

123
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:48,371
Of course.

124
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:58,836
Sit down.

125
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:15,378
Thanks.

126
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,358
You seem uncomfortable.

127
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:20,564
Do I make you nervous, Corky?

128
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:22,160
No.

129
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,659
Thirsty, maybe.

130
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:29,074
Curious, maybe.

131
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:33,041
That's funny. I'm feeling
a little bit curious myself.

132
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:37,041
That's a great tattoo.

133
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,898
Beautiful labris.

134
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:46,200
Are you surprised
I know what it is?

135
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:47,543
Maybe.

136
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:00,402
I have a tattoo.

137
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:04,315
Would you like to see it?

138
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:11,221
A woman in upstate New York
did it for me.

139
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,765
Do you like it?

140
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:17,909
Took her all day to do it.

141
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,299
She promised
it wouldn't hurt, but...

142
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:26,301
it was sore
for a long time after.

143
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:29,598
I couldn't even touch it.

144
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:34,100
Now I love
the way it feels.

145
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:39,227
Here.

146
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,127
Touch it.

147
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:56,669
-What are you doing?
-Isn't it obvious?

148
00:12:58,306 --> 00:13:00,093
I'm trying to seduce you.

149
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:02,718
Why?

150
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:04,759
Because I want to.

151
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:09,370
I've wanted to ever since I saw you
that day in the elevator.

152
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,434
I know you don't believe me...

153
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,415
but I can prove it to you.

154
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:28,664
You can't believe what you'd see...

155
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,208
but you can believe
what you feel.

156
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:42,941
I've been thinking about you
all day.

157
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:01,219
You planned this whole thing.

158
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:04,958
You dropped that earring
down the sink on purpose, didn't you?

159
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:09,086
If I say yes,
will you take your hand away?

160
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,221
-No.
-Yes.

161
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:19,355
Oh, please, Corky.

162
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:20,859
Oh, please.

163
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:23,909
Kiss me!

164
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:52,994
Oh, fuck!

165
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,588
Violet! Vi, you home?

166
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:01,664
Yeah, I'm right here, C.

167
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:07,714
-What the fuck is this?
-I didn't-

168
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,215
What the fuck is-

169
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:12,967
Oh.

170
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:15,303
Corky, this is Caesar.
Caesar, Corky.

171
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:18,850
I thought-

172
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:22,592
It's fuckin' dark in here.

173
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:26,336
Corky's doing some work
for Mr. Bianchini.

174
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,309
Oh, yeah. Right.
Don mentioned that to me.

175
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:33,576
I'm sorry. Hi.

176
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:35,170
Welcome to the family.

177
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:39,239
So you're working
with Rajiv, right?

178
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:41,544
No. Rajiv's in India.

179
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:43,586
She's doing the work herself.

180
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:45,001
No shit.

181
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,002
Bianchini hired you. You must be
pretty good with your hands.

182
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,346
-He's a good friend of mine.
-That's what Violet says.

183
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:51,754
Family really.

184
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:54,984
-When did you get out?
-Jesus, Caesar.

185
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,355
What? It ain't
no big fuckin' deal.

186
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,626
I know who Don hires.

187
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:03,469
You know, he did time himself.
Thirteen fuckin' years.

188
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:06,156
What did you do?

189
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:09,095
-Five.
-Five.

190
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,500
That's not bad. What for?

191
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,867
That's none
of your goddamn business.

192
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:16,487
You're right. She's right.
It's none of my goddamn business.

193
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,947
You don't have to tell me.
It's just-

194
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:21,160
I want you to understand
one thing, all right?

195
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,853
You're amongst good people here.

196
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:33,478
Come on, come on.

197
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:37,677
If you understand what I'm
talkin' about, you'll take the money.

198
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,040
If you don't, then I'm gonna
have to worry about you.

199
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,592
Good. I hate to worry.

200
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,150
I got ulcers.

201
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,637
I should be going.

202
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:57,388
What? No, stick around.
Get her a drink.

203
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:00,011
I gotta go clean out my brushes.

204
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,456
Another time.

205
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,557
Right. Another time.

206
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:25,295
Mmm, Corky, Corky.
What are you doing?

207
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:50,863
I had to see you.

208
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:54,446
Look. I don't think
this is a good idea.

209
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:56,753
I wanted to apologize.

210
00:17:56,823 --> 00:18:01,329
No, please, don't apologize.

211
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:04,529
If there's one thing I can't stand it's
woman who apologize for wanting sex.

212
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:13,138
I'm not apologizing
for what I did.

213
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:17,615
I'm apologizing
for what I didn't do.

214
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,573
You have a bed somewhere?

215
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:14,296
I can see again.

216
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,878
I needed that.

217
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:39,322
So Caesar's Mafia, huh?

218
00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:41,215
You have to ask?

219
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,004
No.

220
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,251
Funny.

221
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:46,361
Nobody really
calls it that anymore.

222
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:48,571
Caesar just calls it
"the business. "

223
00:20:48,643 --> 00:20:50,878
How did you meet him?

224
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:53,793
They took over a club
I was working at.

225
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:55,646
Caesar started managing it.

226
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:58,715
-He's a launderer?
-Basically.

227
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,412
How long you been with him?

228
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:02,936
About five years.

229
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:07,169
Five years is a long time.

230
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:09,089
Yes, it is.

231
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,409
The redistribution of wealth.

232
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:15,938
-Excuse me?
-Isn't it what you wanted to know?

233
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:17,913
What I did time for?

234
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:20,922
"The redistribution of wealth?"

235
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:23,843
That's what I tell someone
when I'm trying to get them in my bed.

236
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,626
But I'm already in your bed.

237
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,705
My cell mate would say
she did her time for getting caught.

238
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:35,424
She was always
a lot more honest than me.

239
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,614
You didn't have to tell me
if you didn't want to.

240
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:41,659
I guess I wanted to.

241
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,103
I'm glad you did.

242
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:50,052
So am I.

243
00:21:56,872 --> 00:21:59,969
* Let me tell you
about a girl I know *

244
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,887
* She is my baby
and she lives next door *

245
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:06,050
* Every mornin'
before the sun comes up *

246
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,290
* She brings my coffee
in my favorite cup *

247
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,675
-* That's why I know... *
-You think I don't know that?

248
00:22:11,753 --> 00:22:13,181
Please. Come on.

249
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:15,623
Will you just-
I have to leave tonight.

250
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,942
Don't make me beg, Violet.

251
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,877
Two minutes. Thank you.

252
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,679
Hey, Violet.

253
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,247
You look great.

254
00:22:50,348 --> 00:22:54,624
I had this image of you
inside of me.

255
00:22:55,948 --> 00:22:57,856
Like a part of me.

256
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:02,053
You are so beautiful.

257
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:06,946
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

258
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,096
Yes, there is.
You didn't want to see me, did you?

259
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:16,011
If there's one thing I can't stand
about sleeping with women...

260
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:17,985
it's all the fucking mind reading.

261
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:21,993
-I don't understand.
-I know, Violet.

262
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:24,809
That's 'cause you can't understand.
We're different.

263
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:27,081
We're not that different, Corky.

264
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:29,833
Ah, let's see.

265
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:32,716
This is the part
where you tell me...

266
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:35,051
what matters is on the inside...

267
00:23:35,118 --> 00:23:38,215
and that inside of you there's
a little dyke just like me.

268
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:42,147
No, she's nothing like you.
She's a whole lot smarter than you are.

269
00:23:42,223 --> 00:23:44,164
Is that what her daddy tells her?

270
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:48,394
I know what I am. I don't have
to have it tattooed on my shoulder.

271
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:52,325
-You saying you don't have sex with men?
-I don't.

272
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,475
For Christ's sake, I heard you.
Thin walls, remember?

273
00:23:58,544 --> 00:24:00,714
What you heard wasn't sex.

274
00:24:02,545 --> 00:24:03,918
What was it?

275
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:06,473
Work.

276
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:12,101
You made certain choices in your life
that you paid for.

277
00:24:12,177 --> 00:24:15,721
You said you made them because
you were good at something...

278
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:17,580
and it was easy.

279
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:20,266
You think you're the only person
that's good at something?

280
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,544
We make our own choices.
We pay our own prices.

281
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,138
I think we're more alike
than you care to admit.

282
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,413
What about that guy this morning?

283
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:32,459
Shelly?

284
00:24:32,531 --> 00:24:35,181
Don't tell me.
You're a workaholic.

285
00:24:36,402 --> 00:24:39,849
No, Shelly knows what I am.
He saw me in a bar with another woman.

286
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:44,778
Yeah. I suppose
he just wants to watch.

287
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:47,949
Fuck it.
I think you'd better leave.

288
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,906
Yeah, I think I'd better.

289
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:53,736
Try not to steal anything
on the way out.

290
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:10,678
Where the fuck is it?

291
00:26:10,745 --> 00:26:13,461
I didn't do it!
I swear to you!

292
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:21,172
Come on!

293
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:23,095
Where is it?

294
00:26:23,162 --> 00:26:24,721
-Oh, that hurt, didn't it?
-Ow!

295
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:29,555
You think you're smart?

296
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,466
Where's that fuckin' money?

297
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:35,220
Please, please!

298
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,778
Please, let me go!

299
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:39,160
Please stop it!

300
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:43,636
Don't make me beg!

301
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,616
Stop it! Please!

302
00:26:47,676 --> 00:26:50,195
-Please stop!
-Tryin' to fuck us? You wanna fuck me?

303
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:53,716
You piece of shit.
We're goin' home.

304
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:56,753
-Nobody fucks him!
-I'm not fucking him!

305
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:58,421
I swear to God!

306
00:26:58,493 --> 00:26:59,866
Johnnie! Ho!

307
00:27:01,438 --> 00:27:03,346
He's making too much noise.

308
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,460
You hear that, bitch?
Shut up.

309
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:10,555
Give me a towel.

310
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,946
Shut up!

311
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:14,395
Here.

312
00:27:16,414 --> 00:27:17,939
Put it in his mouth.

313
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:32,888
Caesar, I'm leaving.

314
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:35,804
What? Why?

315
00:27:37,503 --> 00:27:39,869
-I didn't use a good towel.
-Caesar, I'm serious.

316
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:42,106
I can't take this.
I have to get out of here.

317
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:43,385
Why?

318
00:27:44,608 --> 00:27:46,133
'Cause you know him?

319
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:48,702
Aw, you see?

320
00:27:49,857 --> 00:27:52,277
Baby, that's what I love about you.

321
00:27:52,353 --> 00:27:54,261
You're so fuckin' sensitive.

322
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:58,453
But I like you here.

323
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,383
I want you to stay.

324
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:03,709
This is hard on me too.

325
00:28:03,777 --> 00:28:05,237
I like Shelly.

326
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:09,974
So why don't you watch some TV
and put on a cassette or something?

327
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:18,910
You okay, Violet?

328
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:22,625
Mick, why is Johnnie here?

329
00:28:22,691 --> 00:28:25,275
You know how I feel
about that psycho fuck?

330
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,827
Caesar, didn't I tell you
to get something?

331
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,320
Sure. Sorry about that.

332
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:36,992
You shouldn't have to see this.

333
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:39,546
Why don't you get out of here?
Go for a walk.

334
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,720
Caesar wants me to stay.

335
00:28:45,412 --> 00:28:48,956
Don't worry about Caesar.
I'll handle Caesar.

336
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:52,156
Get out of here.

337
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:54,748
-We can go all night, bitch.
-Okay.

338
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:56,031
Thank you, Mickey.

339
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,199
Here you go.

340
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,822
All fuckin' night, baby!
All night!

341
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:11,650
Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay?

342
00:29:14,662 --> 00:29:16,090
Bitch!

343
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,643
Pick him up.

344
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,068
Shelly,

345
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:34,208
I'm gonna ask you ten times.
You understand?

346
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,576
Ten times.

347
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:38,589
Yeah.

348
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:54,688
One. Where's our money?

349
00:30:15,723 --> 00:30:17,315
You all right?

350
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:32,351
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

351
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:37,731
Keep it.

352
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,738
Shelly was skimming
from the business.

353
00:30:58,414 --> 00:31:02,853
He came to see me yesterday
because he was afraid Caesar found out.

354
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:05,543
He wanted to run, but he
wanted me to come with him.

355
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,751
Even though he knew about you.

356
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:10,637
-Yeah.
-This guy's in love with you?

357
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,531
That's what he tells himself,
but it's not even about me.

358
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:18,315
He could have run at any time,
but he didn't want out.

359
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:20,292
It sounds like
he wanted to get caught.

360
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:22,538
Yeah. Maybe he did.

361
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:25,509
He would brag to me
all the time.

362
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,747
He was never afraid
of Caesar because...

363
00:31:28,815 --> 00:31:30,340
he didn't know him.

364
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:31,691
Not like I do.

365
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,660
I used to be able
to block it out.

366
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:39,048
Or I'd just tell myself that...

367
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,573
I wasn't really there,
and so...

368
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:45,861
none of it really mattered.

369
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,583
But I can't do that anymore.

370
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:54,480
I'm making the same mistake
Shelly made...

371
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:58,439
but now I know what I want.

372
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,329
I want out.

373
00:32:06,866 --> 00:32:08,807
I want a new life.

374
00:32:11,475 --> 00:32:14,376
I see what I've been waiting for,
but I can't do it alone.

375
00:32:21,044 --> 00:32:23,410
I need your help, Corky.

376
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,241
-Caesar's gonna get the money-
-How much money?

377
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,420
Shelly said it's over
two million dollars.

378
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:39,402
Yeah. So Caesar's gonna get it.

379
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:42,542
He's gonna bring it by the apartment.
He's gonna count it.

380
00:32:42,613 --> 00:32:45,427
He's gonna go through the books and try
and figure out how Shelly did it.

381
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:48,176
Wait a minute. Violet, do you know
what you're saying?

382
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:50,699
You're asking me
to help you fuck over the Mob.

383
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,029
Violet, these people are serious.

384
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:56,719
You wanna know how serious?
Ask your friend Shelly.

385
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:00,367
They're worse than any cop because they
have lots of money and no rules.

386
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:02,379
You fuck them,
you better do it right.

387
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:05,387
That's why I need your help.
You said you were good.

388
00:33:05,463 --> 00:33:06,869
I am good.

389
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:13,524
Let's just say for a moment
I believe everything you're saying.

390
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,980
-You think I'm lying?
-I didn't say that.

391
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:20,300
But since you did,
let's say you are.

392
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:22,864
It would have been easy for you
to set up Shelly.

393
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,529
You could have had him killed...

394
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:26,672
knowing that Caesar would bring
the money back to the apartment.

395
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,312
All you would need to keep yourself
clean is someone unconnected.

396
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:34,061
Someone like me.

397
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:37,807
Is that what you think?

398
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:39,789
I'm just making a point.

399
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:44,465
You have no idea
what you're asking...

400
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,464
how much trust it takes two people
to do something like this.

401
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:55,000
For me, stealing has always been
a lot like sex.

402
00:33:56,186 --> 00:33:58,574
Two people who want
the same thing.

403
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,070
They get in a room,
they talk about it.

404
00:34:02,363 --> 00:34:04,598
They start to plan.
It's like flirting.

405
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:08,624
It's kind of like foreplay.

406
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,894
Because the more they talk about it,
the wetter they get.

407
00:34:15,228 --> 00:34:17,715
The only difference is,
I can fuck someone I've just met.

408
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:22,997
But to steal, I need to know someone
like I know myself.

409
00:34:24,637 --> 00:34:26,545
You think you know me like that?

410
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,128
I wanna see the money.

411
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:34,641
Oh, my God!

412
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:36,658
Don't worry.
It ain't mine.

413
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:47,541
-Caesar, what happened?
-It was unbelievable, Vi.

414
00:34:47,614 --> 00:34:49,587
Un-fuckin'-believable!

415
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,532
Shit! Look at this shirt.

416
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,548
Look at it.
It's ruined.

417
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:57,077
It all started when Shelly
took us to the money.

418
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,832
I'll tell you something.
Mickey, he knows his shit.

419
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:01,811
He does.
Shelly took us right there.

420
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:04,406
So Shelly's down
on his knees, right...

421
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:07,707
and he's pulling out this money
from a safe on the floor...

422
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:09,235
and I'm standin' there...

423
00:35:09,312 --> 00:35:11,318
and I'm lookin' at it, right?

424
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:13,495
Like, "Holy fuck!"

425
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:18,804
All I can think about is, "How the fuck
was he able to do this," when bang!

426
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,846
Johnny caps him.
He caps Shelly!

427
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:24,953
Blood goes flyin' everywhere.
All over me. All over the money.

428
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:28,056
I have no idea
if this is even all of it.

429
00:35:30,017 --> 00:35:33,212
And right then,
I go through the roof and bam!

430
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:35,134
I punch the dumb son of a bitch.

431
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,567
I punch him right in
his dumb fuckin' face.

432
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:39,541
I didn't give a shit
whose son he was.

433
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:43,708
I just wanted to hit him again-smack
some sense into the dumb son of a bitch!

434
00:35:43,779 --> 00:35:46,778
Look at the shit that
I gotta fuckin' deal with now!

435
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:49,850
-What are you gonna do with it?
-I told him to run it through the cycle.

436
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:52,922
But no, Johnnie calls up the old man,
and I guess he's got other plans...

437
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:55,809
because he wants to pick up
this shit tomorrow night.

438
00:36:00,323 --> 00:36:02,110
Where's the laundry detergent?

439
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:04,087
It's in the linen cabinet.

440
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:26,010
Come to my place
in the morning, early.

441
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:30,878
You think you know me like that?

442
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:35,646
Two million dollars.

443
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,058
You're having second thoughts.

444
00:36:40,134 --> 00:36:42,467
No.

445
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,387
You said Caesar washed the money?

446
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:47,520
-Yeah.
-Then what? Exactly.

447
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:50,405
-He hung it up.
-He what?

448
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:52,324
To let it dry.

449
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:56,707
It was unreal.

450
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:07,292
Hundreds paper-clipped everywhere
like leaves.

451
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:17,830
Then one by one
he ironed all of it.

452
00:37:24,648 --> 00:37:27,265
-Did he sleep?
-No, but neither did I.

453
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:35,171
All night long
I listened to that sound.

454
00:37:35,242 --> 00:37:37,924
-What sound?
-The sound of money.

455
00:37:43,946 --> 00:37:45,254
Where is it now?

456
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:47,875
It's in his office.

457
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:49,855
I saw it this morning.

458
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:56,670
I need to go to the store.

459
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:02,919
It's in a case on his desk.

460
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:04,994
Does the case lock?

461
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:06,342
Yes.

462
00:38:07,404 --> 00:38:11,876
-Huh. Tell me about Johnnie.
-Johnnie?

463
00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:13,856
Sounds like he and Caesar
don't like each other.

464
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,786
Like each other?
They hate each other.

465
00:38:15,853 --> 00:38:17,575
-Why?
-I don't know.

466
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:19,651
Happened long before
I came around.

467
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:23,204
I think it's basically Caesar
thinks Johnnie's a complete idiot...

468
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:25,764
but, you know,
what can you do?

469
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,356
Johnnie runs Chicago
'cause Gino's his father.

470
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:29,507
Who's Gino?

471
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,769
Gino Marzzone.

472
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:38,051
Marzzone, as in Angelo Marzzone,
head of the Marzzone family?

473
00:38:38,126 --> 00:38:40,067
Yeah, that's his brother.

474
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:43,501
Shit.

475
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,013
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight to pick up the money?

476
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:48,711
Yeah.

477
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:51,203
And Johnnie Marzzone's his son?
That's Johnnie?

478
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,653
Yeah.

479
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:57,350
Sweet Jesus.

480
00:39:03,856 --> 00:39:05,262
It's perfect.

481
00:39:05,328 --> 00:39:08,044
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight. This is a big deal.

482
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:11,014
Caesar's gonna want to do it right.
He won't want to look like an idiot.

483
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:13,543
-Has Gino been to your place before?
-Yeah, twice.

484
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,463
-What happened?
-Caesar was really nervous.

485
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:18,633
He kept cleaning the apartment.

486
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:21,770
The first time he picked out the dress
he wanted me to wear.

487
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:23,694
Did Johnnie ever hit on you?

488
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,989
Johnnie hits on me all the time.
He hits on anything in high heels.

489
00:39:27,058 --> 00:39:30,985
-Did Caesar ever see this?
-He does it right in front of him.

490
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:33,610
This is getting better and better.
Go on.

491
00:39:33,682 --> 00:39:37,543
Well, Gino doesn't speak much English,
or at least he pretends not to...

492
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,723
so he usually gets
right to the point.

493
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:42,477
Both times they only talked
for about five minutes.

494
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,618
They had a drink
and then they left.

495
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:46,730
-What did Gino drink?
-Scotch.

496
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:51,242
Glenlivet. I remember that 'cause
Caesar made a big deal about it.

497
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:55,566
All right.

498
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,201
I have an idea
how to make this work.

499
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:08,399
Go back and get ready.
Take your time. Make it real.

500
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:11,881
What time did you say
they'd be there?

501
00:40:11,957 --> 00:40:15,731
The plane gets in at 7:00,
so I'd say around 8:00.

502
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:18,065
All right.

503
00:40:18,134 --> 00:40:20,467
Now, at some point,
Caesar's gonna quit.

504
00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:24,687
I guess sometime around 6:00,
making sure he's got time to get ready.

505
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:29,229
As soon as he's done, you'll be there
to put a big drink in his hand.

506
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,148
Unbelievable
what this guy Shelly did.

507
00:40:32,214 --> 00:40:34,701
I'll tell you, Shelly's
one smart-ass motherfucker.

508
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:38,767
I mean, he was
one smart-ass motherfucker.

509
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:41,805
Poor boy.
Has to work so hard.

510
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,457
You want him to relax, unwind.

511
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,845
You look good enough to eat.

512
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,728
Where will you be?

513
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,003
I'll be waiting
in the apartment next door.

514
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:01,202
-Waiting for what?
-For the shower.

515
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:03,125
That's gonna be our signal.

516
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:06,870
When he's done with his shower,
you'll go to the bar.

517
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:10,703
You'll get out the scotch
that Gino drinks.

518
00:41:10,777 --> 00:41:13,874
As you do, the bottle
will slip from your hands.

519
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,373
An accident.

520
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:20,625
Vi, what the hell was that?

521
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,223
Vi, you can't hear me?

522
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,231
-Ah, fuck!
-Caesar, it slipped.

523
00:41:25,306 --> 00:41:28,207
-I was trying to get ready.
-How the fuck did you do that?

524
00:41:28,282 --> 00:41:30,670
Caesar, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

525
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:33,363
-I'll get some more.
-There's no fuckin' time!

526
00:41:33,435 --> 00:41:35,343
Don't be silly.
There's lots of time.

527
00:41:35,418 --> 00:41:38,100
I'll clean this up and I'll be back
before you're even dressed.

528
00:41:38,171 --> 00:41:39,696
Fuck, Vi!

529
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:48,562
When you open the door,
I'll be there.

530
00:41:53,148 --> 00:41:54,837
What if he sees you?

531
00:41:54,908 --> 00:41:56,500
He won't.

532
00:41:56,572 --> 00:41:59,386
You can't know for certain
that he won't see you.

533
00:42:00,796 --> 00:42:03,697
-Trust me.
-I'm just asking. What if?

534
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:06,165
If he does...

535
00:42:07,773 --> 00:42:09,746
then I won't have a choice,
will I?

536
00:42:13,054 --> 00:42:15,289
When I'm inside,
I'll get the money.

537
00:42:55,712 --> 00:42:58,166
I'm gonna need something
to fill the case.

538
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,093
Hide it near the desk.

539
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,428
And at that point...

540
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,102
there's no turning back.

541
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,410
When I get the scotch...

542
00:43:21,537 --> 00:43:23,445
how do I know
you won't just take off?

543
00:43:24,418 --> 00:43:27,712
The same way I'll know that you
went to go get the scotch.

544
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:28,792
Trust.

545
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:30,937
I still don't see how
I'm gonna get away clean...

546
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,864
with all the money
in the apartment.

547
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:35,068
Everyone's gonna think
I took it.

548
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:36,447
-Not Caesar.
-Why?

549
00:43:36,515 --> 00:43:38,619
'Cause of what
you're gonna tell him.

550
00:43:38,692 --> 00:43:40,665
You gotta be as real as you can.

551
00:43:41,476 --> 00:43:44,257
The moment you walk through
that door with the scotch...

552
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:45,664
you'll be covered.

553
00:43:46,852 --> 00:43:49,949
That moment's the most important
moment of the plan.

554
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,499
'Cause if you're real enough, he's
gonna believe you, 'cause deep down...

555
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:54,748
he'll want to.

556
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:57,951
C? Shit, I'm sorry.
They were early.

557
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,946
-What are you talkin' about?
-They just left, didn't they?

558
00:44:02,021 --> 00:44:04,835
-What, are you drunk?
-They weren't just up here?

559
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:07,234
No, they're still on their way.

560
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:08,894
That doesn't make any sense.

561
00:44:10,438 --> 00:44:13,503
-Why?
-I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

562
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,212
What?

563
00:44:17,285 --> 00:44:20,633
Yeah. I was getting out of my car,
and I saw him in his BMW.

564
00:44:22,662 --> 00:44:24,962
-Nah, it couldn't have been.
-It was him, Caesar.

565
00:44:25,031 --> 00:44:26,306
I'm positive.

566
00:44:28,455 --> 00:44:29,599
Vi, that's impossible.

567
00:44:29,671 --> 00:44:32,485
Caesar, I know Johnnie.

568
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:34,011
It was him.

569
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,672
I screamed when I saw him.
I couldn't believe I missed him.

570
00:44:36,744 --> 00:44:39,874
I knew you were gonna be upset, so I
thought I'd stop and apologize...

571
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:42,048
and give Gino the scotch, but...

572
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:45,186
I honked a couple of times, and Johnnie
didn't even hear me. He didn't stop.

573
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,475
But...

574
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:52,738
Gino's plane doesn't get here
for another half hour.

575
00:44:56,873 --> 00:44:58,879
Actually, I didn't see Gino
in the car.

576
00:45:10,058 --> 00:45:13,799
If Caesar hates Johnnie as much as
you say, when he opens that case...

577
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:17,345
he's gonna know in his gut
that Johnnie just fucked him.

578
00:45:17,418 --> 00:45:21,126
He'll have no choice.
He can't go after Gino or Johnnie.

579
00:45:21,194 --> 00:45:23,102
There's only one way out.

580
00:45:23,978 --> 00:45:25,286
He'll have to run.

581
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,870
And if he runs...

582
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:31,556
everyone will assume
he took the money.

583
00:45:31,627 --> 00:45:34,441
You'll be clean,
and we'll be rich.

584
00:45:34,508 --> 00:45:36,808
Jesus, that's beautiful.

585
00:45:38,348 --> 00:45:41,925
If you're this goddamn smart,
how did you ever get caught?

586
00:45:42,797 --> 00:45:44,934
I had a partner once.

587
00:45:45,005 --> 00:45:46,465
She fucked me.

588
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,185
I won't.

589
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:54,984
I think we're gonna find out.

590
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:01,412
-Oh, God!
-Caesar?

591
00:46:03,758 --> 00:46:05,611
No.

592
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:08,171
C?

593
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:10,983
Oh, no.

594
00:46:12,878 --> 00:46:13,859
Oh, God.

595
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:20,138
Vi.

596
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:21,798
Vi, I've been set up.

597
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:23,331
Johnnie?

598
00:46:23,407 --> 00:46:24,835
That fuck!

599
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:27,981
That rat fuck!

600
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:30,729
That motherless rat fuck!

601
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,094
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?

602
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,384
Jesus Christ. Violet,
open your fucking eyes.

603
00:46:41,457 --> 00:46:43,627
Johnnie hates me
as much as I hate him.

604
00:46:45,104 --> 00:46:46,957
I hate that motherless rat fuck.

605
00:46:47,024 --> 00:46:50,023
-I fuckin' hate him.
-But you know he did it.

606
00:46:50,832 --> 00:46:53,700
Yeah. So what?
So fucking what?

607
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:58,473
Look, the money is gone, right?

608
00:46:58,546 --> 00:47:00,268
Gino's coming to get it.

609
00:47:00,337 --> 00:47:03,467
Do you think Gino is going to believe me
when I tell him...

610
00:47:03,538 --> 00:47:06,352
his little rat fuck son stole it?

611
00:47:06,418 --> 00:47:09,100
'Cause I don't.
You know what I think?

612
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,787
I'm a dead man.
I'm one in the back of the head.

613
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:13,319
That's what I think.

614
00:47:15,186 --> 00:47:16,526
What are we gonna do?

615
00:47:17,555 --> 00:47:20,369
I know what Johnnie wants me to do.
Johnnie wants me to run.

616
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:22,288
He wants me outta here.

617
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:25,223
But if I run, then everybody thinks
I fucking did it...

618
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:27,207
and he gets away
with two million clean.

619
00:47:29,108 --> 00:47:31,212
I can see him right now...

620
00:47:31,284 --> 00:47:33,257
on the way to get Gino,
laughin' at me!

621
00:47:33,332 --> 00:47:35,119
Laughin' at me, laughin' at me!

622
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:36,813
Laughin' at me!

623
00:47:36,884 --> 00:47:38,792
Fuckin' laughin' at me!

624
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,790
Don't! Please.
Don't touch me, okay?

625
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,445
I gotta think. I gotta
fuckin' think this through!

626
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:50,321
Caesar, I think we should run.

627
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:53,006
We have to go now,
before it's too late!

628
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,444
Please, Violet, leave me alone.

629
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:56,937
Please, all right?

630
00:47:57,014 --> 00:47:59,085
Just leave me the fuck alone!

631
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:03,954
All right, Caesar.

632
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:08,781
I gotta think, that's all.
I just gotta think.

633
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:34,797
-It's me.
-What happened?

634
00:48:34,872 --> 00:48:38,166
He totally freaked out.
I've never seen him like this.

635
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:39,922
He's out of his fucking mind.

636
00:48:39,993 --> 00:48:42,741
That's all right, as long as
he believes it was Johnnie.

637
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:45,296
Believes it?
Jesus!

638
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:48,237
It's driving him crazy.
He wants to kill him.

639
00:48:49,401 --> 00:48:51,309
I don't know, Corky.

640
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,800
I'm getting really nervous.
I don't know what he's gonna do.

641
00:48:54,874 --> 00:48:57,655
It's all right, Violet.
It's working.

642
00:48:57,722 --> 00:49:00,306
All we gotta do is wait him out
and see what he does.

643
00:49:00,378 --> 00:49:02,286
What if he doesn't run?

644
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:05,807
That means he'll probably
kill Johnnie.

645
00:49:05,883 --> 00:49:07,791
Oh, Christ!
I have to get out of here!

646
00:49:07,866 --> 00:49:12,469
Listen, if he doesn't run,
all you gotta do is break down.

647
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:14,905
Go into the bedroom
and pack some things.

648
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:17,785
Start crying. Tell him you love him,
but you can't take it.

649
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:21,330
You're sorry, but you gotta leave,
and just walk out.

650
00:49:21,404 --> 00:49:23,410
All right. Okay.

651
00:49:23,483 --> 00:49:26,416
We're almost there.
Just hang on.

652
00:49:26,492 --> 00:49:27,570
He's coming!

653
00:49:30,076 --> 00:49:33,206
I know what I have to do.
I have to get the money back.

654
00:49:33,277 --> 00:49:35,993
The money?
The money's gone.

655
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,255
No, Johnnie's got it.
I gotta get it back.

656
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:41,498
It could be anywhere.

657
00:49:41,566 --> 00:49:43,507
There's not enough time, Violet.

658
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,587
Johnnie's gotta pick up Gino
at the airport, right?

659
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,488
That means he's probably got
the money with him in the car.

660
00:49:49,565 --> 00:49:50,971
Did he see you?

661
00:49:51,037 --> 00:49:53,457
No.

662
00:49:53,534 --> 00:49:55,802
Good. That's good.

663
00:49:59,742 --> 00:50:01,813
That means I got the edge.

664
00:50:01,886 --> 00:50:03,794
He doesn't know I know.

665
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:09,109
That's why he put
the paper in the case.

666
00:50:10,495 --> 00:50:12,436
He wants me
to hand it to Gino.

667
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:16,147
Then there's no doubt I did it.

668
00:50:17,535 --> 00:50:19,388
Gino will put a bullet in me himself.

669
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,796
But that's not gonna happen.

670
00:50:27,456 --> 00:50:30,488
That jack-off's not gonna set me up.
No way. Not like this.

671
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,468
This is insane.

672
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:39,862
What are you doin'?

673
00:50:41,026 --> 00:50:42,334
I'm leaving.

674
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:45,815
I don't want any part of this shit.
I don't want to be involved.

675
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,060
-You can't leave.
-The hell I can't.

676
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,372
-I need you.
-You don't need me.

677
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:55,295
You've never needed me.

678
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:57,368
I can't help you, understand?

679
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,704
I can't let you leave.

680
00:51:08,803 --> 00:51:12,151
If you're not with me,
I have to assume you're against me.

681
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,424
Caesar, this is crazy.

682
00:51:15,491 --> 00:51:18,556
Maybe it is.
Maybe it isn't.

683
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,176
Maybe you dropped that bottle
of scotch by accident.

684
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:23,487
Maybe you didn't.

685
00:51:24,452 --> 00:51:27,385
I would've been so easy...

686
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:29,434
to let him in as you left.

687
00:51:30,949 --> 00:51:32,409
You can't believe that.

688
00:51:32,485 --> 00:51:34,524
I've seen the way he looks at you.

689
00:51:35,397 --> 00:51:37,305
He's always wanted you.

690
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:40,162
Maybe two million bucks
finally bought you.

691
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:50,980
I'm sorry, Violet.

692
00:51:55,046 --> 00:51:56,386
I wanna trust you.

693
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,939
But you understand.

694
00:52:06,855 --> 00:52:08,763
I don't have any other choice.

695
00:52:26,697 --> 00:52:28,386
You sure you don't want a drink?

696
00:52:53,482 --> 00:52:54,942
-Hello.
-Yeah, we're here.

697
00:52:55,018 --> 00:52:56,871
-Hey, Johnnie.
-Open the fuckin' door.

698
00:52:56,939 --> 00:52:58,312
Sure. Come on up.

699
00:53:34,126 --> 00:53:35,335
Gino.

700
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:40,458
Good to see you.
Vi, look who's here.

701
00:53:40,525 --> 00:53:42,433
Hello, Gino.
How are you?

702
00:53:49,742 --> 00:53:52,392
-You shouldn't have hit me.
-You wanna get into this now?

703
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:53,987
No, Caesar, not now.

704
00:54:02,832 --> 00:54:05,198
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.

705
00:54:20,081 --> 00:54:22,797
Gino, Glenlivet, right?

706
00:54:24,017 --> 00:54:26,798
And I'll have
whatever Violet's drinking.

707
00:54:26,865 --> 00:54:29,449
-I'm not drinking.
-Oh, well, then neither will I.

708
00:54:31,217 --> 00:54:33,321
No, I'll have
a Tanqueray and tonic.

709
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:36,647
Caesar, two T&T's.

710
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:58,352
Salud, eh?
Roy, Pop, Violet.

711
00:54:58,419 --> 00:54:59,694
Caesar.

712
00:55:01,683 --> 00:55:03,569
Uh-uh, no, no, Johnnie.

713
00:55:03,636 --> 00:55:05,904
-I gotta make a bet.
-No goddamn phone. Not now.

714
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:10,634
Cesare, come and sit.
We're gonna talk now.

715
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:13,522
Johnnie, you too.
No, no.

716
00:55:16,884 --> 00:55:18,257
Cesare, look at me.

717
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:22,026
Johnnie, he said to me
what happened.

718
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:28,527
Cesare, you gotta do me a favor.
A personal favor for me, huh?

719
00:55:29,558 --> 00:55:32,819
You gotta start respecting Johnnie
the way you respect me.

720
00:55:34,902 --> 00:55:37,716
Good, good.

721
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:42,419
And you, Johnnie,
you gotta stop acting stupid.

722
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:46,163
You gotta earn this respect
that Cesare's gonna give.

723
00:55:50,423 --> 00:55:51,632
Good!

724
00:55:51,703 --> 00:55:52,978
Done!

725
00:55:55,671 --> 00:55:56,946
Now...

726
00:55:59,224 --> 00:56:00,783
where's my money?

727
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:11,826
We know how this was done?

728
00:56:13,464 --> 00:56:15,601
Yeah. I know.

729
00:56:16,408 --> 00:56:18,578
And it won't happen again?

730
00:56:20,185 --> 00:56:22,158
Good. Done. We go now.

731
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:24,141
Wait a minute, Pop.
Jesus Christ.

732
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:27,282
You got two hours
till your plane leaves.

733
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:30,802
Just relax. Have a drink.

734
00:56:30,874 --> 00:56:34,288
Caesare, Glenlivet.

735
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:43,409
So, Caesar, tell me something.

736
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,456
What did it total out at?

737
00:56:46,522 --> 00:56:47,928
2.176.

738
00:56:47,994 --> 00:56:50,131
Unbelievable.

739
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:52,496
Can you believe that, Violet?

740
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:54,610
Johnnie.
