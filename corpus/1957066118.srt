WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

353
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:24,928
SARAH, I'M
A FEDERAL AGENT

354
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:26,531
REPRESENTING
THE STATION 12

355
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,399
WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM.

356
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:30,368
ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,
A MAN NAMED TONY LAZORKA

357
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:34,005
TURNED STATE'S EVIDENCE
AGAINST THE CATANIA
CRIME FAMILY.

358
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,974
WE'VE SINCE
RELOCATED HIM.

359
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,976
BUT HE'S NOW
IN GRAVE DANGER.

360
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:42,980
THE MEN HE TESTIFIED AGAINST
FOUND OUT HIS NEW ADDRESS.

361
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:45,081
AND HIS NEW NAME--

362
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:47,352
JOHN DUGAN.

363
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:54,893
WHAT DID HE DO?

364
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:59,996
HE WAS A HIT MAN.

365
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,234
SARAH...JOHN ISN'T
TONY ANYMORE.

366
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:05,469
OK, I'M NOT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
RIGHT NOW,

367
00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:07,437
BUT I BELIEVE
IN THIS MAN.

368
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:09,440
NOW HE'S RISKING
HIS LIFE TO SAVE YOURS.

369
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:13,010
PLEASE DON'T
BAIL OUT ON HIM NOW.

370
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:14,245
TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER
AND GO GET YOUR THINGS.

371
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:18,115
I GOTTA GET YOU
OUTTA HERE RIGHT AWAY.

372
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:18,916
SARAH, NOW!

373
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:23,021
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, LET'S GO.

374
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:40,271
[PANTING]
DON'T SHOOT!

375
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,111
TELL ME EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT
WITH THE CATANIAS.

376
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:50,982
I HATE TO SOUND
LIKE MY HIGH SCHOOL
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,

377
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,316
BUT I DON'T LIKE
YOUR ATTITUDE.

378
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:54,985
YOU WANT INFORMATION,
SCREW YOU.

379
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,954
YOU DON'T
TRUST ME, KID?

380
00:30:56,987 --> 00:31:01,226
TRUST YOU? HA!
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY.

381
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,595
IS THAT RIGHT?

382
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:05,596
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

383
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:06,796
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

384
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,300
BECAUSE PEOPLE TELL ME
THAT GOD IS DEAD
AND ELVIS IS ALIVE.

385
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:12,904
SO I TRUST NO ONE.
ESPECIALLY YOU, DICKHEAD.

386
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,472
YOU DON'T MISS
YOUR MAMA ABOUT NOW?

387
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,475
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CATCH ME CRYIN'
FOR THAT BITCH.

388
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,476
REALLY?

389
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,278
NOW WHERE'S
THE LIST?

390
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,213
AND WHAT DID THEY
PAY YOU FOR IT?

391
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:25,349
I DIDN'T MAKE
A FUCKIN' DIME, MAN.
IT WAS A TRADE.

392
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:28,219
THE LIST FOR MY
OLD MAN'S WHEREABOUTS.

393
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:29,921
WHERE'S YOUR
OLD MAN?

394
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,555
YOU TELL ME.

395
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:32,990
HE'S IN YOUR WITNESS
PROTECTION PROGRAM.

396
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:34,926
THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM,
I GUESS I WAS ABOUT 6.

397
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,962
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE
HE DUMPED ME
IN SOME FOSTER HOME.

398
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:39,129
GIVE ME A NAME.

399
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,265
I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY NAMES UNTIL YOUR
DANCING BUDDIES THERE

400
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:42,499
THREW ME A COUPLE
OF NICKNAMES.

401
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:46,905
I LIKE SEYMOUR THE PENNY
THE BEST. THAT WAS
MY FAVORITE, HUH?

402
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:49,607
YOU GET IT? BRIAN PENNY.

403
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,610
SO YOU'RE
SEYMOUR'S KID.

404
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:58,649
OK, LISTEN...
I CAN HELP YOU
IF YOU TALK TO ME.

405
00:31:58,682 --> 00:31:59,883
ALL RIGHT.

406
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,419
ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO
THERE WERE SOME GUYS
THAT CAME AROUND HERE,

407
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,221
STARTED SHOWING ME
PICTURES OF ME
AND MY OLD MAN.

408
00:32:04,254 --> 00:32:05,723
THEY SAID IF I COULD
HACK THE FBI SYSTEM,

409
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:07,591
THAT THEY WOULD
GIVE ME HIS WHEREABOUTS.

410
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:09,660
SO THEY SAID
THEY COULD GET ME
IN THE FBI COMPOUND,

411
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:13,698
GIVE ME THE LEVEL 3
SECURITY THAT I NEEDED
TO WORK MY MAGIC AND--

412
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:14,599
THE CATANIAS
TOLD YOU THAT?

413
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,968
OH, MAN, THESE GUYS
WERE NOT EVEN ITALIAN.

414
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,602
WE'RE TALKING...
WEISER HOCKEY TEAM,

415
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:21,372
STUFFY ASS, IBM,
BROOKS BROTHERS
MOTHERFUCKERS.

416
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:23,541
I ONLY GAVE THE GOOMBAHS
HALF A LIST, BUT, UH...

417
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:27,445
THEY WERE ONLY
INTERESTED IN MY DAD
AND--AND SOME OTHER DUDE.

418
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,746
THEY MENTION
ANY NAMES?

419
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:32,616
UH, YEAH. UM...

420
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,985
JOHN SOMETHING,

421
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,622
DUGAN...

422
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:40,390
[WHISPERING]
SHIT.

423
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,466
YEAH.

424
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,167
ARE THEY OK?

425
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,736
YEAH, THEY'RE OK.

426
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,404
LOOK, I MAY NEED YOU
TO RELOCATE ME

427
00:32:53,437 --> 00:32:55,305
IF MY BOSS EVER
FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS.

428
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:57,608
YEAH, LISTEN,
I'M WITH THE KID.

429
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:58,442
Tom: JESUS CHRIST,

430
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:01,145
JOHN, JOHN, GET YOUR
ASS BACK HERE NOW!

431
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:04,148
John: AND HE SAYS
THE GUYS HE DEALT
WITH WERE NOT MOB.

432
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:05,182
SOME 3rd PARTY.

433
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,385
Tom: YEAH, IT'S
PROBABLY SOME
INSIDE JOB, JOHN.

434
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,053
ALL THE BETTER REASON
FOR ME TO COME AND GET YOU.

435
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:09,954
WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

436
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:12,656
HE ALSO SAYS
HIS FATHER'S
IN THE PROGRAM.

437
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:14,225
SOME SEYMOUR SEGAL.

438
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,092
RING ANY BELLS?

439
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,226
HE'S GONNA
NEED PROTECTING.

440
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,030
JOHN, CAN WE JUST
TALK ABOUT THIS
WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER?

441
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:19,998
GET YOUR ASS
BACK HERE NOW.

442
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,332
LOOK, IT'S NOT
GONNA BE OVER
UNTIL I END IT.

443
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:25,503
THEY'RE GONNA HUNT
US ALL DOWN--SARAH,
AMBER, EVERYBODY--

444
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,804
UNTIL EVERYONE'S
DEAD. NOW LISTEN,

445
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:29,373
YOU CAN PICK
THE KID UP AT
THE RAILROAD TRACKS

446
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:30,508
JUST SOUTH--

447
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:30,508
OOH!

448
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,642
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

449
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,745
I GOT NO INTEREST
IN BEING A BUTT BUDDY
IN PRISON, OK?

450
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:36,814
BESIDES I'M ONLY HERE
'CAUSE OF MY DADDY-O.

451
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:40,317
I WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT NEITHER OF US
ARE LOOKING BETWEEN BARS.

452
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,452
<i> CAPICE?</i>

453
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:43,521

454
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,790
AND SOME MYSTERIOUS
3rd PARTY AFTER

455
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,559
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M GONNA BE
ABLE TO HIDE?

456
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:49,827
I'M NOT AS DUMB
AS I LOOK.

457
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,097
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M STICKING TO YOUR ASS
LIKE CHEAP TOILET PAPER.

458
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,333
NOW WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WON'T PUT 2 BULLETS
IN YOUR HEAD,

459
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:59,804
CRACK OPEN A BEER
AND CALL IT A NIGHT,
HUH?

460
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:05,043
BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY
ONE WHO KNOWS WHO
THE 3rd PARTY IS?

461
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:09,179
YOU GOT
A POINT, KID.

462
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:10,614
BUT, LISTEN...

463
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:11,815
YOU DICK WITH ME,

464
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,284
I'LL TEAR YOUR
KNEECAPS OFF

465
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,686
AND PLAY AIR HOCKEY
WITH THEM.

466
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,254
DO NOT FUCK WITH ME.

467
00:34:17,286 --> 00:34:18,755
GIVE ME MY PHONE.

468
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,426
GET IN THE CAR.

469
00:34:23,193 --> 00:34:26,664
AND SO, I HELPED THE MOB

470
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,799
AND SOME FRIENDS
OF THEIRS IN THE CIA

471
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:29,699
JUGGLE THEIR BOOKS.

472
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:32,236
AND THEN I TOOK YOU
GUYS UP ON YOUR OFFER

473
00:34:32,268 --> 00:34:35,138
OF COMPLETE IMMUNITY
FROM PROSECUTION.

474
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:37,108
PRETTY GODDAMN SWEET.

475
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:37,842
YEAH, WELL...

476
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,844
I'M ONE HELL

00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,313
AND NOT MUCH
OF ANYTHING ELSE.

478
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,150
NOW SOMEWHERE OUT
THERE IS A THING

479
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:48,752
THAT I HAVE MY SIGNATURE
ON MORE THAN ANYTHING.

480
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:51,455
MY BIGGEST INVESTMENT.

481
00:34:51,487 --> 00:34:55,158
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE THAT KID IS.

482
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:59,163
SO WHAT'S UP, PHIL?

483
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:01,832
WE'RE GONNA KEEP YOU HERE
TILL AFTER THE TRIAL.

484
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:05,136
THEN WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU
TO A PERMANENT LOCATION.

485
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,238
ALL RIGHT.

486
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,572
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

487
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:10,441
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

488
00:35:10,474 --> 00:35:11,709
TYRONE.

489
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:15,146
HOPE HE'S GOT THE FOOD.

490
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,517
[GUNSHOT]

491
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,517
UNH!

492
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,253

HAD I KNOWN YOU
WERE COMIN', I'D...

495
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:31,295
CLEANED
THE PLACE UP.

496
00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:32,796
I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT.

497
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:35,866
I WANTED IT
TO BE A SURPRISE.

498
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:37,902
[NERVOUS LAUGH]
WELL, THAT IT WAS.

499
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,237
Seymour:
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT
WHERE I WAS STAYING?

500
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,174
I GOT A TIP
FROM YOUR FRIENDS.

501
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:46,209
YOU KNOW, SEYMOUR...

502
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:50,413
YOU LEFT AND I JUST
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

503
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:52,650
TO BALANCE MY CHECKBOOK.

504
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,351
YOU WERE SO GOOD.

505
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:55,953
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO?

506
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:57,888
IT HURT MY OPERATION.

507
00:35:57,921 --> 00:36:01,192
I HAD TO GO OUTSIDE FOR HELP.

508
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,294
TONY TURNS TO THE P.D.

509
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,295
YOU GO...

510
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,964
IT DIDN'T DO WONDERS
FOR THE CATANIA BRAND NAME.

511
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:10,301
DOM...WE CAN WORK
THIS OUT.

512
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,970
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORK OUT.

513
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:14,705
YOU HAVE 10 Gs!

514
00:36:14,738 --> 00:36:15,739
NO! NO!

515
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:17,274
ALL RIGHT, PAOLO.

516
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:17,274

00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:20,278
PAOLO...PLEASE.

518
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:23,846
OH, SUCH A HOT-HEAD.

519
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,618
I'M NOT ONE FOR VENDETTAS.
I'M A BUSINESSMAN.

520
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:29,787
BUT I DO BELIEVE IN JUSTICE.

521
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,789
SO I WANT TO TELL YOU

01:20:45,206 --> 01:20:47,976
RIGHT.

1220
01:20:48,676 --> 01:20:51,312
OK. THE PARTY CRUISE IS OVER.

1221
01:20:51,345 --> 01:20:52,513
SARAH, I WANT YOU
OFF THIS SHIP.

1222
01:20:52,546 --> 01:20:54,082
I'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

1223
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,215
YOU PROMISE?

1224
01:20:55,249 --> 01:20:58,553
I'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

1225
01:21:07,428 --> 01:21:10,231
AAH! THIS ISN'T LIKE
BREAKING A BINARY CODE.

1226
01:21:10,264 --> 01:21:15,336
NO, SON,
AN RSA ENCRYPTION COUNTS
ON PRIME NUMBERS.

1227
01:21:15,369 --> 01:21:17,538
PRIME NUMBERS!
OF COURSE.

1228
01:21:17,571 --> 01:21:19,474
THANKS, POPS.

1229
01:21:20,074 --> 01:21:22,177
LOOK.

1230
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:23,611
HEY, HEY, HEY!

1231
01:21:23,644 --> 01:21:26,348
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP, OK?

1232
01:21:31,018 --> 01:21:31,719
THANKS.

1233
01:21:31,752 --> 01:21:34,222
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KILL ME, TONY.

1234
01:21:34,255 --> 01:21:35,924
SURE, I DO.

1235
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,458
ON YOUR KNEES.

1236
01:21:37,491 --> 01:21:39,060
IS THAT REALLY
NECESSARY?

1237
01:21:39,093 --> 01:21:41,129
ON YOUR KNEES.

1238
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:42,898
ALL RIGHT.

1239
01:21:43,097 --> 01:21:44,565
WHAT'S IT MATTER ANYWAY?

1240
01:21:44,598 --> 01:21:47,268
WE'RE BOTH GOING TO DIE
WHEN THE SHIP BLOWS UP.

1241
01:21:47,301 --> 01:21:50,271
YOU AND I DON'T HAVE TO.
WE CAN BOTH LEAVE
TOGETHER.

1242
01:21:50,304 --> 01:21:52,573
YOU'RE THE NUMBER ONE
FIXER IN JERSEY.

1243
01:21:52,606 --> 01:21:55,043
YOU LEFT US AND YOU
CRIPPLED THE FAMILY.

1244
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,578
WE NEEDED THE CIA TO GET
US BACK ON OUR FEET.

1245
01:21:57,611 --> 01:22:01,282
WE CAN PUT THE CATANIAS
BACK ON TOP, TONY.

1246
01:22:01,315 --> 01:22:02,951
YOU'LL BE MY RIGHT HAND.

1247
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:05,053
I'M NOT IN
THAT BUSINESS ANYMORE.

1248
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:06,487
YOU TURNED OVER
A NEW LEAF?

1249
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,623
YOU'RE OUT THERE
KILLING EVERYBODY.

1250
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:09,657
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

1251
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:13,561
AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WON'T KILL YOU, DOMINIC?

1252
01:22:13,594 --> 01:22:15,663
BECAUSE YOU'RE SMART,
TONY.

1253
01:22:15,696 --> 01:22:16,797
WE'RE TALKING
BUSINESS HERE.

1254
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:19,968
YOU WEREN'T MEANT TO BE
WALKING THE MALLS
IN SUBURBIA.

1255
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:21,436
YOU KNOW IT
AND I KNOW IT.

1256
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:22,603
WE'RE STILL FAMILY.

1257
01:22:22,636 --> 01:22:26,374
TONY, COME ON.

1258
01:22:28,542 --> 01:22:30,378
IT'S GREAT SEEING YOU,
BRIAN.

1259
01:22:30,411 --> 01:22:32,113
I'VE WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU FOR SO LONG.

1260
01:22:32,146 --> 01:22:36,750
YEAH, LOOK. THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
THE FATHER/SON PICNIC, OK?

1261
01:22:36,784 --> 01:22:38,152
FOR A WHILE THERE,

1262
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:39,520
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK
YOU DIDN'T EVEN EXIST,

1263
01:22:39,553 --> 01:22:43,191
LIKE I WAS BORN OUT OF
A TEST-TUBE OR SOMETHING.

1264
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:47,295
WE'RE DEAD.

1265
01:22:47,328 --> 01:22:50,265
HERE. GIVE IT TO ME.

1266
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:54,469
I WANT YOU TO KNOW...

1267
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:56,537
I DIDN'T ABANDON YOU.

1268
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:57,638
YOUR MOTHER LEFT US.

1269
01:22:57,671 --> 01:23:00,108
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE SHE WENT.

1270
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:03,411
I WAS INVOLVED IN--
IN QUESTIONABLE
ACTIVITIES,

1271
01:23:03,444 --> 01:23:06,781
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO LIVE THAT LIFE...

1272
01:23:06,814 --> 01:23:08,649
WITH A GUN ALWAYS
OVER YOUR HEAD.

1273
01:23:08,682 --> 01:23:13,755
THE FOSTER HOME WAS
THE SAFEST PLACE
TO RAISE YOU.

1274
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:16,790
I--I WAS AFRAID.

1275
01:23:16,824 --> 01:23:19,393
[ALARM RINGING]

1276
01:23:20,694 --> 01:23:24,566
BUT I NEVER
FORGOT ABOUT YOU.

1277
01:23:27,301 --> 01:23:28,737
[ALARM STOPS]

1278
01:23:39,747 --> 01:23:40,615
DID YOU MEAN THAT

1279
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:45,053
OR WERE YOU JUST TRYING
NOT TO GO TO HELL?

1280
01:23:47,588 --> 01:23:48,755
TONY...

1281
01:23:48,789 --> 01:23:49,889
DON'T DO THIS.

1282
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:54,195
DOMINIC, I CAN NEVER REPAY YOU
FOR THE LIFE YOU GAVE ME,

1283
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:57,732
BUT I CAN'T FORGIVE YOU
FOR TRYING TO KILL MY FAMILY,

1284
01:23:57,765 --> 01:24:00,334
SO IT ALL STOPS HERE.

1285
01:24:00,367 --> 01:24:04,839
SEYMOUR WILL TESTIFY,
THE FAMILY IS DEAD,

1286
01:24:04,872 --> 01:24:07,075
AND YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL.

1287
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:09,210
GET UP.

1288
01:24:10,344 --> 01:24:12,080
AND, DOMINIC,

1289
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:15,050
THE NAME IS JOHN.

1290
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:19,087
I'D LIKE TO TRY...
BEING A DAD AGAIN.

1291
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,223
YOU KNOW, MAKE UP
FOR ALL THOSE
LOST YEARS.

1292
01:24:22,256 --> 01:24:26,394
IT LOOKS LIKE I'LL
BE TESTIFYING SOON.

1293
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:28,862
WHEN ALL THAT'S
OVER WITH,

1294
01:24:28,896 --> 01:24:33,535
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN DOWN
TO THE CAYMAN ISLANDS?

1295
01:24:38,906 --> 01:24:41,176
OHH!

1296
01:24:42,309 --> 01:24:44,679
TONY, JOHN...

1297
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:47,248
I MEAN, TONY--WHATEVER.

1298
01:24:47,281 --> 01:24:49,750
WHICH ONE DIES FIRST?

1299
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:51,686
LET THEM GO, PAOLO.

1300
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:53,287
IT'S BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

1301
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,423
LET MY FATHER GO.

1302
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:01,529
COME ON, GUYS.
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

1303
01:25:01,829 --> 01:25:03,831
Sarah: AAH!

1304
01:25:04,698 --> 01:25:06,334
COME ON!

1305
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:18,679
FUCKER! I'LL KILL YOU!

1306
01:25:18,712 --> 01:25:21,516
YOU KILLED MY FATHER!

1307
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:33,128
TONY!

1308
01:25:36,864 --> 01:25:39,867
TONY!

1309
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:47,142
YOU'RE MINE, TONY!

1310
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:07,729
TONY!

1311
01:26:08,262 --> 01:26:09,731
TONY!

1312
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:14,302
YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME, TONY.

1313
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:12,493
[BANG BANG]

1314
01:27:39,987 --> 01:27:41,689
[CRACK]

1315
01:27:56,003 --> 01:27:59,607
NOW, THAT'S SICILIAN STYLE.

1316
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:10,051
I LOVE YOU, SON.

1317
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:12,920
YOU DID GOOD
BACK THERE.

1318
01:28:12,953 --> 01:28:15,790
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT, I DID.

1319
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:18,293
I MEAN, UH...

1320
01:28:21,028 --> 01:28:23,765
I--I LOVE YOU, TOO...

1321
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:27,568
DAD.

1322
01:28:29,703 --> 01:28:31,072
ANY MORE SECRETS?

1323
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:33,107
NO MORE SECRETS.

1324
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:38,079
EXCEPT I THINK
THE WORD'S OUT
THAT I LOVE YOU.

1325
01:28:39,913 --> 01:28:42,583
DADDY, CAN WE GO HOME NOW?

1326
01:28:42,616 --> 01:28:46,087
YES, BABY, WE CAN.

1327
01:28:47,654 --> 01:28:51,759
GIVE ME A COUPLE OF MINUTES,
ALL RIGHT?

1328
01:28:56,096 --> 01:28:58,598
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION
FOR YOU.

1329
01:28:58,632 --> 01:29:01,969
NOVEMBER 22, 1963,
IN DALLAS,

1330
01:29:02,002 --> 01:29:04,372
WERE YOU 
IN THE GRASSY KNOLL...

1331
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:06,139
OR THE BOOK DEPOSITORY?

1332
01:29:06,173 --> 01:29:09,410
I WAS IN THE FIRST GRADE.

1333
01:29:10,944 --> 01:29:15,082
NO MORE STEALING
GOVERNMENT SECRETS, ALL RIGHT?

1334
01:29:15,115 --> 01:29:19,053
NO. NO, I WON'T BE
PULLING YOU OUT OF
RETIREMENT

1335
01:29:19,086 --> 01:29:22,123
ANY TIME SOON,
BUT, UH...

1336
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:24,692
THANKS, JOHN.

1337
01:29:24,725 --> 01:29:27,027
IT'S GOING TO BE
REALLY, REALLY COOL

1338
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:28,796
TO HANG OUT
WITH MY DAD.

1339
01:29:28,829 --> 01:29:33,601
I'M PROUD TO KNOW YOU,
BRIAN PENNY.

1340
01:29:35,102 --> 01:29:36,604
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

1341
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:38,505
YOU GOT IT.

1342
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,942
I'M DRIVING.
