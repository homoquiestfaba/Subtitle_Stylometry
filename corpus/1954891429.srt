00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:17,501
- How do I look?
- Ghastly.

3
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,468
- Are we rolling?
- Yep.

4
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:20,921
- Okay.

00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:24,677
3 years ago, the police of
Orleans Parish, Louisiana,

7
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:27,779
started finding bodies,
in pieces.

8
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:31,589
The work of a serial killer,
nicknamed, "The Butcher."

9
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:35,438
A long man hunt ended 
not with an axe wielding maniac,

10
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:38,606
but a 17 year old boy,
Jesse Winters.

11
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:41,517
After his capture,
Jesse was tried as an adult,

12
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:45,472
found guilty of 22 murders
and sentenced to death.

13
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:47,874
On his 18th birthday,
he was executed at the

14
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,885
Louisiana State Penitentiary,
by lethal injection.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,935
The curious thing about his case,
however, was not the murders,

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,250
but rather, his legal defense.

17
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:01,686
Jesse's mother insisted,
that he was innocent.

18
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:04,755
She claimed that Jesse had
been possessed for over a year

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,647
and that varies exorcism
attempts had failed.

20
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:09,827
His final exorcism
performed by now,

21
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:12,745
excommunicated priest,
Father Robert Tomlin,

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,267
was the last time his mother
saw him before his arrest.

23
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:19,290
Now, for the first time
outside the courtroom,

24
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:22,967
we can show the tape
of Jesse's failed exorcism.

25
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:26,922
Now, the images you're
about to see, are graphic.

26
00:01:26,947 --> 00:01:30,325
And we advise younger, sensitive
viewers to look away.

27
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,731
Case # 42 Jesse Winters
Property of Baton Rouge Police Department

28
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:34,744
You're not welcome into
the body of this child!

29
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,373
You're not welcome,
I cast you out!

30
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:42,219
- You're hurting him!
- No! It's the demon I'm hurting!

31
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:43,504
Jesse.

32
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:45,003
Oh, Christ.
There's no pulse.

33
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:46,804
- Don't do this, Dr. Winters!
- Leave us alone!

34
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,667
Stop it!
You'll put us all in danger!

35
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,462
- Get away! We're leaving, Rob!
- Don't!

36
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:52,417
Don't do this!

37
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:56,336
Jesse, stop!
Don't do this! Jesse!

38
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:00,429
Jesse, stop.
Don't hurt me.

39
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,159
I would never hurt you.

40
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:12,057
Jesse escaped and began
his murderous rampage.

41
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:14,673
Starting with his own father.

42
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:17,357
But this documentary
is not about Jesse,

43
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:19,382
it's about his mother, Kate.

44
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,390
Kate Winters claims
that she can prove

45
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:24,774
that Jesse was indeed
possessed by a demon.

46
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,190
How?

47
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:27,517
For the first time on camera,

48
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:31,343
Kate is going to herself,
become possess by a demon.

49
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,046
Will it work?

50
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,144
Or is she a fake?

51
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:46,758
<font color="#ff7575">THE EXORCISM TAPES</font>

52
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,135
Day 1

53
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,458
Yes, uh.
We got turned around at the exit.

54
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:54,809
We're on the way
to your house now.

55
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,877
Probably 5 minutes.

56
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,806
Okay.

57
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:05,047
We're a few minutes late
and she's already calling?

58
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:07,353
She's fucking crazy, Stu.

59
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:09,272
Nah.
She's not crazy.

60
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:12,616
When rich people are crazy,
it's called eccentric.

61
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:15,153
Her son killed 23 people.

62
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:18,408
Don't raise a child like that
unless you're fucking crazy.

63
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:20,213
- Everything look good?
- Yep.

64
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:22,147
Well, double check it,
because I swear, Joey,

65
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:24,237
if you bring me a bunch
of out of focus shots

66
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:26,942
you'll never touch a camera again.

67
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:29,842
Well.
She can just...

68
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,844
chill the fuck out,
'cause we're almost there.

69
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:35,162
Alright.
We're here.

70
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:37,165
Alright, guys.
Let's be professional.

71
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,765
No laughing. No joking.
No comments.

72
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,361
No matter what kind of
weird shit you hear, okay?

73
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:44,865
This lady is paying us a lot of money,
so let's just do our job.

74
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:46,742
Alright.

75
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:50,013
Okay.

76
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:59,021
I baptized Jesse.
I knew him his entire life.

77
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:00,789
He's just a perfectly normal kid.

78
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:04,355
And this thing at the end,
that wasn't Jesse.

79
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,110
So, yes,
Absolutely, he was possessed.

80
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:09,511
That's why Jesse kill people.

81
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:13,431
No, it was the demon inside him
that killed those people.

82
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:16,176
How many exorcism have you done?

83
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,314
Quite a few.

84
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,596
But I will tell you, there was something
very different about Jesse's case.

85
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:24,232
Something like I've never seen before.

86
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:26,631
This demon was stronger,

87
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:28,732
more in control.

88
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:39,704
So, this is the scene of the infamous
Jesse Winters's exorcism.

89
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,945
- Yes.
- Any regrets?

90
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,125
None.
I take full responsibility for everything.

91
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,059
The tapes. My excommunication.
Everything.

92
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:51,187
So, what went wrong?

93
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,722
I didn't have enough time or trust
or faith.

94
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:58,370
Jack didn't understand like Kate.

95
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,865
So, what do you think about
what Kate is doing here?

96
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,750
I think this documentary is a great thing

97
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:06,257
People need to know what happened.

98
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:07,902
No, not the documentary.

99
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:11,923
I mean, what do you think about
Kate becoming possess herself.

100
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,662
What?

101
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:18,201
What are you talking about?
How can she even do that?

102
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:20,789
Well.
We're going to find out.

103
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,962
Are you all out of your minds?

104
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:25,013
Look, even if this were possible.

105
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,527
you saw what that demon
did to Kate's husband.

106
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:30,593
Not to mention all the other poor souls.

107
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:32,122
- This isn't a game.
- Look.

108
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:35,085
You and I both know that
nothing is going to happen.

109
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:38,277
You do not even realise what
you're getting involve with,

110
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:40,526
what's at risk, son.

111
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:43,168
It's a good TV.

112
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:45,654
I can't be a part of this.

113
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,736
Please.
Leave my house.

114
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,090
- One more question.
- Get out!

115
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:54,192
If you're smart, you stop
this before it's too late.

116
00:05:58,116 --> 00:05:59,804
I'm going to say it.

117
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,408
Say what?

118
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:04,563
You just got us kicked
out of a priest's house.

119
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,002
How's that even happened?

120
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:08,233
Priests are the most
forgiving people on Earth.

121
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:11,612
He's not a priest anymore, remember.
He was excommunicated.

122
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,449
Still, we'll be going
straight to hell for that.

123
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,291
No way.
Not on my own.

124
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:18,568
I'm bring you all with me.

125
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:20,702
Speaking of which.

126
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:24,489
I really appreciate.
I really appreciate you getting me this job.

127
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:26,811
Come on, Sty.
You don't have to thank me for that.

128
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,432
I know,
but I needed it.

129
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:31,125
The money, you know.

130
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,921
Hey. There's no one I rather
go to hell with than you guy.

131
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,397
Kate Winter's Home

132
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:44,608
- Is this how the stars do it?
- Of course.

133
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:47,642
So.
Where exactly are we?

134
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:50,069
This is Jesse's bedroom.

135
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:54,309
He was so sick,
especially at the end.

136
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,202
There are a lot of
bad memories in here.

137
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,909
I can't believe I'm in
the Butcher's bedroom.

138
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:02,006
- What did you say?
- The butcher.

139
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:03,290
That's what the media called him.

140
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:05,073
Don't you ever say that again.

141
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,440
- That's my son we're talking about.
- I'm sorry.

142
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:07,803
You got it?

143
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,316
Yeah, sure.
You're the boss.

144
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,696
Alright.
Follow me.

145
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:23,471
Oh, hey.
Where do you want this equipment?

146
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:25,719
Put the equipment in here.

147
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:28,486
My room is down the hall.

148
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:35,146
- Ms. Winters, can I have a moment.
- Sure.

149
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,784
Dr. Ben Hatcher
PSYCHYATRIST CENTRAL UNIVERSITY

150
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,905
This is Dr. Ben Hatcher

151
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,333
He is a psychiatrist I hired
to prove I'm not crazy.

152
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:50,765
Do you have to
film me right now?

153
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:54,337
As a matter of fact, Dr. Hatcher,
I do.

154
00:07:54,362 --> 00:07:57,696
From this point forward,
everything has to be filmed.

155
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,027
What if I object?

156
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:02,731
Then I'll replace you.

157
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,597
You sought me out, Ms. Winters,
not the other way around.

158
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:09,171
Yes, I did.

159
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:11,899
But the footage comes first.

160
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:16,597
Hey, uh. Where do you
want me to put these cameras?

161
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,053
Hey, Joey.
Give him a hand.

162
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:20,346
Put them up where
I showed you earlier.

163
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:29,134
- What's this?
- Legal releases.

164
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,291
Sign,
and have you assistants sign as well.

165
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:33,902
Why?

166
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:37,439
So, if something goes wrong,
you don't sue the hospital.

167
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:39,279
Or Ms. Winters.

168
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:41,096
Or me.

169
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,701
Dr. Hatcher,
where does all this go?

170
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:47,760
Down that hallway, turn left.

171
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,970
- Do you like the music?
- Yes, it's nice.

172
00:09:31,994 --> 00:09:34,333
It was Jesse's favorite.

173
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:38,179
Can you tell me
what I'm looking at here?

174
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:43,040
I'm going to use these items
to summon a demon to possess me.

175
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:45,315
You're sure this is going to work?

176
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:47,610
Absolutely

177
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:50,184
Done my research.

178
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,867
It's going to work.

179
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:55,371
Can you give us an idea
what to expect when you do this.

180
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:58,688
The same thing
that happened to Jesse.

181
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:01,426
I can't believe you're so calm.

182
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,701
I'll be terrified if I were you.

183
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:05,416
- Do you have any children?
- No.

184
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:06,829
Then you wouldn't know
what it's like

185
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:10,177
to have the world labeled
your only son a monster.

186
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:13,771
Did you read what they say
about me in the papers?

187
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,931
And then they celebrated
when they executed a child.

188
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:18,484
I thought Jesse was 18.

189
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,688
He was my son.

190
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:23,696
If I can prove that
a demon can possess me,

191
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:28,167
then the would will have to accept
that my Jesse was innocent.

192
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:30,445
I think we're done here.

193
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:39,008
What a creepy fucking kid.

194
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:42,049
Looks like a killer to me.

195
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:55,079
This is exciting.

196
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:57,788
Yeah.
Sure.

197
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:00,690
It's exciting.

198
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:07,145
Fucking eccentric.

199
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:09,779
Eww.
What the hell is this?

200
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:12,627
- Who told you to open that?
- This is a biohazard.

201
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:16,427
Do you have any idea how unsanitary
it is to keep this in the kitchen?

202
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:19,010
Never mind why you have it
in the first place.

203
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:22,804
- Don't worry, it's not human.
- That's not the point.

204
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:31,909
What are you doing?

205
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,730
I don't want to talk about it.

206
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:38,591
Dr. Hatcher.
We're ready for the interview.

207
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:50,778
Jesse had a very tragic story.

208
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:53,288
He should not have been
sentenced to death.

209
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,349
He had a mental illness.

210
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:56,946
You don't believe
he was possessed.

211
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:59,329
No.
I do not.

212
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:01,780
If you don't believe Kate's story,
then what are you doing here?

213
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:06,559
Ms. Winters hired me as a consultant to lend
some credibility to this undertaking of her's.

214
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:09,546
I'm going to monitor her
mental and physical health

215
00:12:09,571 --> 00:12:12,311
- Why?
- Simply put.

216
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:17,214
It's my job to determine whether or not
Ms. Winters can be possess by a demon,

217
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:19,462
or if she is in need of actual therapy

218
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:22,452
What are the odds that
something happens to Kate?

219
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:24,853
Nothing is going to happen to her.

220
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:29,095
I suspect she's currently suffering
from a mild level chronic depression.

221
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:32,679
This is why she is using her
religious fantasy as a crutch.

222
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:36,964
It's my hope that going through this
experience we can get her pass this,

223
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,681
and get her off this crutch.

224
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:41,571
Tell me a little about
your qualifications, Ben.

225
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:46,338
I'm a psychiatrist and a professor in the
department of medicine at Central University.

226
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,354
You're also an author.

227
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,556
Can I get an autograph?

228
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:54,711
Done your research on me.

229
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:57,057
Yes, I have written a book.

230
00:12:57,313 --> 00:12:59,425
And was it a best seller?

231
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,450
It did okay.
It's more of an academic textbook.

232
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:08,705
Academic? You try to disprove the
existence of God, miracle, demonic possession.

233
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,535
- It doesn't sound academic to me.
- You're over simplifying.

234
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,287
In my book, I wrote about several
cases studies where some supernatural behavior

235
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,020
was really just a
manifestation of mental illness.

236
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:22,445
So, yes.
It is an academic book.

237
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,855
Faith and religion are the
last lies of an insane world.

238
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,940
In it's quest for true understanding,

239
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:33,042
humanity has to abandon the monsters
under the bed and the angels in the sky.

240
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,471
What's your point?

241
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:38,684
Those are pretty strong words
especially for a former priest.

242
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:40,145
I was never ordained.

243
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,713
What happened?
Why did you lose your faith?

244
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:48,636
My faith isn't relevant. My scientific expertise
is the only thing that matters here.

245
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,063
Well, I disagree. I
think it's all relevant.

246
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:54,565
I'm here to certify Ms. Winters
is mental sound.

247
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,865
And that is the only thing
you and I are going to discuss.

248
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,264
The rest of my life
is non of your business.

249
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,676
I see why she wanted
you for the job.

250
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:06,635
I'm glad my resume
meets your approval.

251
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:18,480
So. Have you guys made
anything I might have seen?

252
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:19,735
'Ghost chasers ".

253
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,771
- Is that on TV?
- Used to be.

254
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:23,365
Well, that's too bad.

255
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,831
Yeah. Producers were
a bunch of amateurs.

256
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:28,065
It's so good,
it could put insomniacs to sleep.

257
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,369
Oh. I guarantee this
project will be memorable.

258
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:33,816
- It already is.
- Enjoy the food.

259
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,436
If there is anything else you need,
just let me know.

260
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:38,540
Ms. Winters, aren't you
going to eat anything?

261
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:42,214
Oh, no. I can't eat anything
before the ceremony tonight.

262
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:46,037
- You want to do that tonight?
- Well, at 3 AM.

263
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,201
I have to get a blood sample.
I need a baseline psychiatric profile.

264
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:52,097
So, let's get it.

265
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:54,308
Okay.

266
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:59,505
I got it.
You just finish your dinner.

267
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,854
You know, Sarah.
You have a nice face, for a camera.

268
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,339
- Thank you.
- Any interest in acting?

269
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:10,018
No.

270
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:06,716
Alright, Kate.

271
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,448
I'm going to ask you a series
of questions

272
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:11,935
to measure a baseline brain functions
and cognitive awareness.

273
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,442
Okay.

274
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,570
Can you tell me what
you're drawing right now?

275
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:19,305
Symbols that will allow me
to summon a demon.

276
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,238
- What is your full name?
- Catherine Elizabeth Winters.

277
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,285
- And where are you right now?
- In my house, my bedroom.

278
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,715
What is your earliest memory?

279
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:35,858
When I was 6, my father
took me to a Dodgers  game.

280
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:38,025
You don't remember
anything before that?

281
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,256
Not off the top of my head.

282
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:42,510
Alright, Kate.

283
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:46,229
As far as I can tell
you are mentally healthy.

284
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:50,999
- Great. Let's get started with the ceremony.
- Okay, let's clear the room.

285
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:53,130
No, you all must participate.

286
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:56,343
Whoa, uh uh.
I did not sign up for this.

287
00:16:56,368 --> 00:17:00,088
You participate or you get out
of my house right now.

288
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,805
You must all put your hands
on the altar.  Including you.

289
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:33,797
Dark Lord.

290
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:38,219
You humble servant,
Kate Winters

291
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:40,485
awaits you.

292
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,574
Dark Lord.
Judge me worthy.

293
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:50,462
Judge my worth,
and convey to him, The Morning Star.

294
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:53,467
He who binds the light.

295
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:59,031
Dark Lord, judge me worthy.
I offer my soul to you.

296
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:08,352
This is my offering, my body.
My body is yours.

297
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:11,008
I am yours.

298
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:29,308
Jimmy, listen.
I got some great footage, man.

299
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,486
 It's amazing.

300
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,793
She did the ceremony and she...

301
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:37,034
she painted the walls with blood
and stabbed some animal heart.

302
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:40,418
It's crazy.
This is some good stuff.

303
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:43,587
I even ripped a few pages
from her creepy ass book.

304
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:47,979
I was planning on faxing them to you.
So, let's talk numbers.

305
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:52,562
No, that's a fucking price
for a Youtube video.

306
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:55,549
This is real, man.
This is like an exclusive.

307
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,336
Come on, man. How am I
suppose to pay these guys?

308
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:00,904
No.
If you don't pay me,

309
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:03,371
how in hell am I
suppose to pay them?

310
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:05,440
No, I know but...
Hello?

311
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:07,897
Hello?
Jimmy!

312
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,963
Shit!

313
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:18,337
Hey.
Can I get you to come inside?

314
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:40,680
- Is there any alcohol in here?
- No.

315
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:43,049
Give me the keys. I'm going
to get something to drink.

316
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:45,206
Why?
So you can wreck my car again?

317
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,956
Jesus Christ, man. What the
hell have you got me into?

318
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:53,028
Stu, I got you a job that’s
going to solve all your problems.

319
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,591
I showered twice
and I still feel gross.

320
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:57,895
Yeah, and never tell me about it.

321
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:01,642
Do you want to get out of here?
I was going to get a drink, maybe.

322
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,438
I don't know.
You guys going out?

323
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:05,126
No, I'm going to bed.

324
00:20:05,151 --> 00:20:08,454
Yeah, I probably should to.
I got an early morning.

325
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,046
You are a fucking cock block,
you know that?

326
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,316
Good night, Stu.

327
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:56,121
Day 2
Dec 12th 2010

328
00:20:56,157 --> 00:20:58,026
How was your night?

329
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:03,590
Not good.
It was unfortunately quiet.

330
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,333
What did you expect to happen?

331
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:08,724
I expected this morning that
you should be talking to a demon.

332
00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:12,885
- Why is it so important you become possess?
- I don't know what I could have done wrong!

333
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,704
I did everything I was suppose to.

334
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:21,125
Isn't it more likely that
Jesse was in fact mentally ill,

335
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,313
and that there was no demon.

336
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:28,084
No. I have to figure this out.
I must have missed something.

337
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:32,280
- Okay. Why don't you tell me about...
- We'll do this later.

338
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:35,780
Kate.
Just one more minute, please.

339
00:21:36,602 --> 00:21:39,858
So,  Dr. Hatcher.
How was your night?

340
00:21:42,275 --> 00:21:44,160
So. How did you guys
sleep last night?

341
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:47,422
- Like shit.
- I have fucking nightmare after nightmare.

342
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:50,135
Yeah.
That stuff really got to me.

343
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:54,305
My grandma once told me a story about
somebody who did something like this.

344
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,753
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

345
00:21:57,168 --> 00:22:01,831
In her hometown in North Carolina.
Apparently she was some kind of witch.

346
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:06,010
People she didn't like,
she just killed them, from a distance.

347
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:09,756
With her mind, huh?
That's the the dumbest shit I ever heard.

348
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:12,566
My grandma never lied.
It's true.

349
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:16,121
She put a curse on them and then
they would die the next day.

350
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:20,706
- Sounds like a small-town tall tale.
- Yeah. Maybe.

351
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:26,118
Ha, ha.
It's funny.

352
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:29,627
Stu, are you okay?

353
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:30,731
Stu!

354
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:32,724
- I think he's choking.
- Stu!

355
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:36,658
Are you alright?

356
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:38,665
Not funny.

357
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:41,562
I was waiting for you to
give me mouth-to-mouth.

358
00:22:41,587 --> 00:22:43,551
Next time, I hope you really choke.

359
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:46,320
Oh, come on.
It was just a joke.

360
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:48,691
What?
Where are you going?

361
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:52,308
Unlike you guys,
I have work to do.

362
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:58,895
- That was funny, right?
- You're a real dumb ass, Stu.

363
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,715
Come on.

364
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,411
Oh, Jesse.

365
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:06,672
I failed.
Why?

366
00:23:07,774 --> 00:23:10,557
- What's going on?
- She's just working thought something.

367
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:14,882
- You're not going to stop her?
- No, she need to work through it.
- (Why? What else do I need to do!)

368
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:16,876
Jesse.

369
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,637
Can you help me.
I have to do this.

370
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:22,375
Ha ha ha!

371
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,732
What am I missing, Jesse?
What am I doing wrong?

372
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:30,038
I have performed the ceremony.

373
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:32,390
I said the god damn words!

374
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:34,196
Kate, what are you doing?

375
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:37,853
I don't know what I am doing wrong?
What am I missing?

376
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:39,678
I wouldn't know.

377
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:43,140
- That's it.
- What's it?

378
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:45,153
He was sick.

379
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:49,048
- Kate, are you okay?
- I am now.

380
00:23:49,714 --> 00:23:52,661
I just had to get that
out of my system.

381
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,836
Thank you.

382
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,018
- Is the door locked?
- Yes.

383
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:14,357
Ben can't know about this, okay?

384
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,903
If he knows I'm doing this to myself,
he would call me insane.

385
00:24:17,928 --> 00:24:20,193
And probably try
to have me committed.

386
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:22,378
Don't even worry about it.

387
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:29,368
I'm weakening my body
so that it will speed up the process.

388
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:32,400
And then the damn thing
can take me.

389
00:24:40,591 --> 00:24:43,515
I want to ask you what happened
in Jesse's room this morning?

390
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,239
I was just looking
for answers.

391
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:48,697
I'm a little concern about you.

392
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:51,570
I'm not confident we
should continue this.

393
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:55,682
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- I don't like using that word.

394
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:58,565
And what word would you use?

395
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,471
Insane?

396
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:07,930
Mental ill? Deranged?
Depressed? Confused?

397
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:10,925
Do you feel any of those
words describe you?

398
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:15,054
You remind me of my
poor dead husband.

399
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,322
God bless his soul.

400
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:23,171
You know, Jack was a doctor too.
He was brilliant.

401
00:25:23,196 --> 00:25:27,118
- You don't mention of him often.
- No, and I'm not going to.

402
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:32,413
I don't need you to tell me I have
unresolved issues with my dead husband.

403
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:36,101
Kate.

404
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:40,381
I lost somebody once.

405
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:44,129
She was, very close to me.

406
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:46,268
It was hard.

407
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:49,200
I felt a lot of anger.

408
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:52,698
- Who was it?
- My sister.

409
00:25:52,723 --> 00:25:56,167
I remember Jesse
when they killed him.

410
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:58,711
The look in his eye.

411
00:25:58,736 --> 00:26:02,515
When his veins
filled with potassium chloride.

412
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,132
You know in the weeks
before he was executed,

413
00:26:05,157 --> 00:26:07,364
the demon wasn't in there anymore.

414
00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:10,062
And he didn't remember
what he had done.

415
00:26:11,142 --> 00:26:15,188
And he didn't know why
he was being executed.

416
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,316
That's my memory of Jesse.

417
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:23,862
But you have to grief,
and move on.

418
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:28,198
God, why?
Why are you stop this?

419
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:31,007
Why?
I did everything I was suppose to!

420
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:34,928
Please! Please!
Just let the damn thing have me!

421
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:41,489
- What happened?
- I don't know. The door just flew open.

422
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,745
It must have just
been the wind.

423
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,719
How the hell did
this blow over here?

424
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:47,746
Is that how this is?

425
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:49,950
Check the weather.

426
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:53,400
I think there might be a big storm
blowing through today.

427
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,022
It happened.

428
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,861
Just clean this up.

429
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:16,099
 So. Is this the weirdest thing
you've ever seen?

430
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:17,893
Huh.
Hardly.

431
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:23,194
I once monitored a homicidal sleepwalker.
That shit was terrible.

432
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:27,062
Yeah. We were once on a shoot where
this guy claimed he could hear ghosts

433
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:30,281
and they told him all
sorts of scary things.

434
00:27:30,306 --> 00:27:31,622
I don't believe in ghosts.

435
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:34,400
Come on, Stu.
That guy was a pathological liar.

436
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,886
Okay. Well. Maybe that one was a hoax,
but we have seen unexplainable things.

437
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:42,011
We are witnessing one right now.

438
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:47,292
Come on. All I'm saying is that,
I had a few ghostly encounters.

439
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:52,516
Well, Stu.
I work in reality, not reality TV and...

440
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:56,437
Since working for Dr. Hatcher,
I find more often than not,

441
00:27:56,462 --> 00:28:01,162
people claiming to see ghosts
have Avery real problem.

442
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:08,228
Honestly, you show a lot of the same similarities
to a few very unfortunate patients I have treated.

443
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:12,728
You might want to consider
a therapy after this study is done.

444
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,509
I did... No, I don't think...
No, I...

445
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:20,875
Relax.
I'm just messing with you.

446
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:30,071
Not going to happen.

447
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:32,961
It's going to happen.
I'm wearing her down.

448
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:42,544
Father Tomlin?

449
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,337
- I'm Dr. Ben Hatcher.
- Thanks for seeing me.

450
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:46,117
Absolutely.

451
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:52,900
Now, I don't meant to be rude.

452
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:56,310
But I'm not sure that it's a good idea
for you to see Kate right now.

453
00:28:56,567 --> 00:29:00,277
I know what Kate is trying to do.
I just can't ignore it.

454
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:05,401
Everyone has their own processes,
when it comes to grieving

455
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:09,813
<i>I'm not talking about this documentary.</i>

456
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:14,281
I'm talking about Kate's soul,
about her trying to become possess.

457
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:16,981
I understand your believes, Father.

458
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,101
But at this point of her therapy,

459
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:21,563
this is exactly what she needs
to be separated from.

460
00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:23,594
- Yes. But, you don't understand.
- What are you doing here?
- What do you want?

461
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:25,486
- Kate.
- What is he doing here?

462
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:28,040
You know, you need to leave
or you will ruin everything!

463
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:29,985
Kate. I came here to stop you
from doing this.

464
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,646
Why would you stop me?

465
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:34,083
Don't you understand
this is all we have left?

466
00:29:34,103 --> 00:29:36,850
This is the only way that
the church will accept you back.

467
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,650
I don't care about that anymore, Kate.

468
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:41,393
Don't you realize
what you're risking?

469
00:29:41,418 --> 00:29:43,735
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

470
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,295
Because it's done.
The ceremony is done.

471
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,633
This won't bring Jesse back.

472
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:50,796
- There's nothing you can do.
- You're wrong.

473
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:54,400
Because if I succeed, then the world
will have to  believe me.

474
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,432
The world doesn't care.

475
00:29:56,457 --> 00:29:57,645
- Get out!
- Hey.

476
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,867
- Get out!
- Hey.

477
00:29:58,892 --> 00:30:01,439
You get the fuck out of my house!

478
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,713
You all are in so much danger
and you don't realize it.

479
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,977
When you come to me for help,
pray it won't be too late.

480
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,933
Get out!

481
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:22,001
Just leave her alone.

482
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:24,910
She needs to be alone right now.

483
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:28,094
Get the damn thing
out of my face.

484
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:36,189
- This could get out of hand quickly.
- Yeah, I saw that.

485
00:30:37,264 --> 00:30:41,656
I didn't know that she would be prone to hysteria.
She could become violent.

486
00:30:42,484 --> 00:30:45,816
- Where is the sedation kit?
- I'll go get it now.

487
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:40,175
- What' going on?
- What's happening?

488
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:42,464
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

489
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:45,025
- The door won't open.
- Is there a key?

490
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,856
It's not locked,
it just won't open.

491
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:51,428
I want to see the footage from this room
first thing in the morning.

492
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:55,280
Kate, open the door!
Please.

493
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:05,094
Kate?
Kate?

494
00:32:10,518 --> 00:32:12,485
Are you okay?

495
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:17,692
I feel wonderful.
It finally happened.

496
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,912
Day 3

497
00:32:22,937 --> 00:32:28,246
Kate, what happened to your arms?
Did you do this to yourself?

498
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:30,649
Don't be ridiculous.

499
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,463
You know what, guys?
I think we're done here.

500
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:36,627
I am considering emitting
you to the hospital.

501
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:38,830
No, you don't decide
when this is over.

502
00:32:38,855 --> 00:32:41,107
Actually, I do.

503
00:32:41,132 --> 00:32:45,064
One phone call and the police will be here
to escort you to the hospital.

504
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,091
You just try it and
see what happens.

505
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:48,436
We're not going to stop
just because you...

506
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:51,778
Excuse me,
I'm talking to my patient.

507
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,283
Dr. Hatcher?

508
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:55,832
- Yes, what is it?
- You need to take a look at this.

509
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:02,074
That's not right.

510
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:06,704
- Has anyone tempered with this equipment?
- Of course not.

511
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:08,625
What's going on?

512
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,737
The machine is not
recording your heartbeat.

513
00:33:12,762 --> 00:33:14,392
Demons don't have heartbeats.

514
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:16,400
Don't be ridiculous.

515
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:18,844
- Do we have an extra monitor?
- No.

516
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:28,698
What?

517
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:30,955
Your don't have a heartbeat.

518
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:34,461
I'm going to call Sam about
getting some new equipment.

519
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,891
Eddie, I would like to
speak to you in private.

520
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:43,170
What kind of game
are you playing?

521
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,429
Game? What the hell
are you talking about?

522
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:47,360
You think this is a joke?

523
00:33:47,385 --> 00:33:48,626
Oh, I see.

524
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:52,056
Have you run into something you can't explain
with your fancy medical degree?

525
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:55,099
Ben. Can I have you
back in here, please.

526
00:33:55,893 --> 00:33:58,193
We are not through here.

527
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:03,514
It's normal.

528
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:21,089
Exactly.
Everything is normal.

529
00:34:21,114 --> 00:34:23,257
What was it like?

530
00:34:23,282 --> 00:34:26,155
- What?
- The possession.

531
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,634
You said that the demon came last night.
What was it like?

532
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:34,000
It's like being touched by fire.

533
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:36,769
Where's the demon now?

534
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:41,617
Inside of me.

535
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,468
I don't feel good.
I need to lie down.

536
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:52,915
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

537
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,501
I just need to lie down.

538
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,282
I know you can't get this on camera,
but believe me the smell is disgusting.

539
00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:07,791
I don't understand.

540
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:09,788
How can all the food
go bad all at once?

541
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:11,711
No clue.

542
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:14,157
It was fine yesterday.

543
00:35:14,182 --> 00:35:17,275
You know what?
I'll finish this up.

544
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:21,422
Sarah. Why don't you go
get some groceries.

545
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:24,954
- Are you sure?
- Here.

546
00:35:25,888 --> 00:35:27,867
I'll go with you.

547
00:35:28,703 --> 00:35:30,756
Help you carry the bags.

548
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:33,767
Okay, sure.

549
00:35:38,629 --> 00:35:41,818
Like I said.
She's a peach.

550
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:47,878
So. What's going on with Kate?

551
00:35:48,577 --> 00:35:50,569
She's a little warm.

552
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,549
What does that mean?

553
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,138
It means she has a fever.

554
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:57,800
I hope she is up soon.

555
00:35:57,825 --> 00:36:01,744
Sicken pigeons ain't as interesting
as satanic symbols on the wall.

556
00:36:07,945 --> 00:36:10,251
You're crazy, Stu.

557
00:36:10,692 --> 00:36:12,894
It's a true story.

558
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,646
What did you all get?

559
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:20,724
Some fruit and stuff,
a peach for one.

560
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:42,262
I can see your cards.

561
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:45,142
It doesn't matter.
You suck at poker.

562
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:48,368
Oh, yeah. Well, it
doesn't matter, because

563
00:36:48,393 --> 00:36:51,919
this pot is coming home
with me.

564
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:54,501
Ah.
Shit.

565
00:36:55,227 --> 00:36:58,020
I am a poker god.

566
00:36:58,248 --> 00:37:00,809
You really are a shitty winner.

567
00:37:01,446 --> 00:37:04,659
Alright.
Deuces wild and two down.

568
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:14,288
Deal me in.

569
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,168
Deal me in.

570
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:20,242
Okay, sure.

571
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:29,066
Aren't you going to
look at your cards?

572
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:32,302
No.
I know what they are.

573
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:39,271
- 3 of clubs, King of diamonds.
- Yeah, right.

574
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:47,714
Okay.
Try that again.

575
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:52,307
Jack of hearts♥

576
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,928
Lucky.

577
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:58,727
Queen of diamonds.

578
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:00,824
Damn.

579
00:38:01,995 --> 00:38:05,248
6 of hearts ♥

580
00:38:07,512 --> 00:38:10,150
5 of spades.

581
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,282
Nice trick.

582
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:15,157
2 of clubs.

583
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:17,126
No.

584
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:18,801
2 of clubs.

585
00:38:18,826 --> 00:38:20,767
No, you got it wrong.

586
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:23,685
- That card is the 2 of clubs.
- It isn't.

587
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:26,779
- You're lying, Stu.
- I'm not.

588
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,029
Are you trying to make
a fool of me?  Huh?

589
00:38:33,054 --> 00:38:36,716
You think this is your big break,
you piece of shit.

590
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:41,253
- Where are you going?
- I'm out of here. I'm leaving.

591
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:43,925
Wherever you go,
they'll find you.

592
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,258
What the fuck
are you talking about?

593
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,298
Your gambling debts.

594
00:38:48,323 --> 00:38:49,714
How'd you knew about that?

595
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:50,605
Okay.

596
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,616
- How much are you in for?
- I think we have enough for one night.

597
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:56,038
- You don't have... You have no idea...
- Stu, calm down.

598
00:38:56,062 --> 00:38:57,364
You told her, didn't you?

599
00:38:57,389 --> 00:38:58,981
Of course not.
Come on, man.

600
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:02,458
This is bullshit.
This is fucking bullshit!

601
00:39:03,437 --> 00:39:04,995
So, Ben.

602
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,344
- Tell me about your sister.
- What?

603
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:13,708
You heard me.
How did your sister kill herself?

604
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,478
Oh, by the way. You might just
want to go ahead and fuck Stu.

605
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:20,790
Because it's all he thinks about.

606
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:23,815
And he really can't do
very well at his job.

607
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,260
Kate, we should get you to bed.

608
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:29,259
- You know, suicide is a sin.
- Kate.

609
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,151
- Don't you, altar boy.
- Stop this.

610
00:39:32,176 --> 00:39:34,405
You know what they do
to pretty girls in hell?

611
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,409
Kate, enough.

612
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:41,584
I don't-I don't feel right.

613
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,087
Maybe we would just go?

614
00:39:50,112 --> 00:39:51,291
No.

615
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:55,296
If they are playing a joke on us,
this is a waste of our time.

616
00:39:55,738 --> 00:39:57,992
I don't know if it's a joke.

617
00:39:58,017 --> 00:40:01,622
If that woman really needs my help,
we need to stay.

618
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:04,991
 We can't just leave her alone
with these vultures.

619
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:09,541
- What if she's in on it?
- No, she is not in on it.

620
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:12,783
They're indulging her,
feeding her fantasy.

621
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:15,256
Then, why don't we
just get rid of them?

622
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:19,402
One reason I'm not getting rid of them
right now is what it would do to Kate.

623
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:22,191
She needs to move
past Jesse's death.

624
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:25,741
This whole thing
is part of that process.

625
00:40:31,778 --> 00:40:33,386
What's Kate?

626
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:35,049
She's sleeping.
What do you want?

627
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:37,492
I got proof she ain't crazy.

628
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,213
- Really?
- Show him, Stu.

629
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:48,161
Crazy, right?

630
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:51,790
- Let me ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

631
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:56,673
- How stupid do you think I am?
- You got to be fucking kidding me.

632
00:40:56,698 --> 00:40:58,812
What? You don't
believe your own eyes?

633
00:40:58,837 --> 00:41:02,213
No.
I don't believe you.

634
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:05,425
You don't believe me. Then,
what do you think is going on?

635
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:10,286
I think you are taking advantage of that
poor woman with your stupid parlor tricks.

636
00:41:10,326 --> 00:41:12,564
She is clearly mentally ill.

637
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:17,064
So that makes your little magic show
not only unethical, it's illegal.

638
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:18,286
Hey, you know...

639
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:19,760
When this is all done.

640
00:41:19,785 --> 00:41:22,449
I'm going to have the police
confiscate your footage.

641
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:24,824
And I'm pressing charges.

642
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:28,455
We're not dealing with
a crazy woman anymore.

643
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,237
- We're dealing with a fucking demon.
- Exactly.

644
00:41:31,262 --> 00:41:34,074
This is not a documentary about
the mother of the Butcher.

645
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:37,811
- She was right. It was a demon.
- Eddie! He wants to send us to jail.

646
00:41:37,836 --> 00:41:39,098
Don't worry about it.

647
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:41,180
No. No.
I'm done. I'm leaving.

648
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:45,423
We can 100% prove that
the devil exist and you want to quit?

649
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:49,810
You step one foot out of that door
and you're not getting a fucking dime.

650
00:41:49,928 --> 00:41:54,424
And when they come to collect,
I'm not going to bail you out.

651
00:41:55,884 --> 00:41:58,494
You are a son of a bitch,
you know that.

652
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,582
Just looking out for you.

653
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:04,859
Day 4

654
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:13,186
- What's that?
- Rehydration fluid.

655
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:22,741
- How are you feeling, Kate?
- Are you going to fuck him?

656
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,023
Excuse me?

657
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:26,976
You have a real soft spot
for losers, don't you.

658
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:31,311
- I guess you're feeling better.
- Much.

659
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:34,999
He calls you a peach.
You know that, right?

660
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:37,679
- You heard him say that?
- Of course.

661
00:43:37,704 --> 00:43:41,408
Because you eat a peach real slow
and when you're done,

662
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:44,144
drop it in the trash.
And Sarah.

663
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:49,100
I appreciate it if you tell him to keep
his vulgar comments to himself.

664
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:57,581
Ready to get this
legendary moment on camera?

665
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:08,864
<i>Sarah, I want to feel my cock
in your mouth...</i>

666
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:10,157
Ah.

667
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:17,071
Don't ever come fucking near me again.
Any of you, you hear!

668
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:22,959
So. How did it go?

669
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:24,387
- Fuck off, man.
- Ha ha ha.

670
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,134
Just turn the fucking camera off.

671
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,717


672
00:44:34,158 --> 00:44:36,295
Ben kicked us out.

673
00:44:38,163 --> 00:44:40,897
Go see what you can get
from outside.

674
00:44:43,835 --> 00:44:46,089
I want to ask you
a few questions.

675
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:51,065
Quid pro quo.
You answer my question, I answer yours.

676
00:44:51,336 --> 00:44:52,893
Okay.

677
00:44:52,997 --> 00:44:56,650
Your sister's in hell,
you know that, right?

678
00:44:56,675 --> 00:44:59,261
- Is that you question?
- No.

679
00:44:59,286 --> 00:45:02,829
My question is,
do you miss her?

680
00:45:02,854 --> 00:45:04,577
Of course.

681
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:09,047
She misses you.
She needed you, Ben.

682
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:11,596
She called out for you
when she was dying.

683
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:13,317
Okay, my turn.

684
00:45:13,345 --> 00:45:14,778
Shoot

685
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:19,573
- Who am I talking to right now?
- Isn't it obvious?

686
00:45:19,598 --> 00:45:22,081
Why aren't you
answering my question.

687
00:45:21,706 --> 00:45:24,717
Do you really want me
to answer your question?

688
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,000
Do you really want to know
who you're talking to?

689
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:31,126
I don't think you do.

690
00:45:31,151 --> 00:45:34,951
Because if you knew
who I really was...

691
00:45:34,976 --> 00:45:39,796
... it would destroy that lie you
tell yourself that let you sleep at night.

692
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,078
You know what I think, Kate?

693
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:45,824
What?

694
00:45:46,638 --> 00:45:49,499
I think you want to believe
that you are possessed.

695
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,913
Because if you're possessed,
your son is innocent.

696
00:45:54,664 --> 00:46:00,290
Oh, he was innocent, alright.
That's what made it so sweet.

697
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:06,361
It was so much fun just to hear
him wailing and crying in prison.

698
00:46:06,804 --> 00:46:09,266
He was so confused.

699
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:14,280
You know in prison they can corrupt the body
in ways you wouldn't even think were possible.

700
00:46:14,295 --> 00:46:16,781
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

701
00:46:16,806 --> 00:46:19,417
You want to know what
they did to him in prison?

702
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:21,388
No.
I don't.

703
00:46:21,937 --> 00:46:26,864
- That can't be real.
- Un fucking believable.

704
00:46:26,975 --> 00:46:29,997
- How'd you guys do it?
- Do what?

705
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:31,398
The paint.

706
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,362
What're you talking about?
We didn't paint anything.

707
00:47:02,007 --> 00:47:05,427
- What are you doing?
- Moving on, Ben.

708
00:47:05,452 --> 00:47:08,723
- I'm done grieving.
- What do you mean?

709
00:47:12,193 --> 00:47:14,718
Just doing what you said.

710
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:24,473
I want to talk to you, Eddie.

711
00:47:31,735 --> 00:47:34,462
It looked real.
It was coming from the painting.

712
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:36,709
Are you sure it looked real?

713
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,676
But, trust me,
it's not.

714
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:42,350
It's a magic trick.
Okay?

715
00:47:45,547 --> 00:47:47,665
I like you, Eddie.

716
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:50,964
And I want to make sure
this little project of yours

717
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:53,199
is everything you want it to be.

718
00:47:53,224 --> 00:47:54,686
Thanks, Kate.
I appreciate that.

719
00:47:54,742 --> 00:47:58,719
Don't call me Kate.
You know I'm not Kate.

720
00:47:58,744 --> 00:47:59,887
Okay, sure.

721
00:47:59,912 --> 00:48:02,539
I've been talking to a few
colleagues at the hospital.

722
00:48:02,564 --> 00:48:06,285
Kate is clearly developing
some kind of delusional disorder.

723
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,369
- We need to commit her.
- Okay. When?

724
00:48:09,394 --> 00:48:10,986
Tomorrow morning.

725
00:48:11,678 --> 00:48:17,187
You just keep the cameras rolling and
I'll promise I won't harm a hair on you head.

726
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:19,117
- Deal?
- Deal.

727
00:48:19,142 --> 00:48:23,439
Excellent.
Here's to good TV.

728
00:50:31,355 --> 00:50:32,493
What's going on?

729
00:50:32,518 --> 00:50:36,043
I need you to stay out of our way,
or this officer will arrest you.

730
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:38,130
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

731
00:50:38,155 --> 00:50:40,292
Joey, Stu. Make sure
you get every bit of this.

732
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:43,025
- You are not putting this on tape.
- The hell I'm not.

733
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,552
You're about to violate
my civil rights.

734
00:50:44,577 --> 00:50:48,922
This isn't about you, you moron.
We're taking Kate to the hospital.

735
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:50,371
What's the charge?

736
00:50:50,396 --> 00:50:52,647
Where is Sarah?
Sarah!

737
00:50:52,672 --> 00:50:55,696
Sarah, will you please help them
if they need assistance?

738
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,820
Okay, Kate's outside.
You have the sedation kit?

739
00:51:01,424 --> 00:51:02,650
Thanks.

740
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:04,447
Officer, I can handle this.

741
00:51:04,471 --> 00:51:06,916
But, please feel free to arrest
any of these gentlemen

742
00:51:06,941 --> 00:51:10,212
if they take 1 step
outside of that door.

743
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:22,442
- Good morning, Ben.
- Good morning, Kate.

744
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,724
What is she doing?

745
00:51:40,651 --> 00:51:44,630
Didn't your sister, Mia,
shoot herself in the head?

746
00:51:44,655 --> 00:51:49,090
Kate. We need to take you to
the hospital for further testing.

747
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:55,826
Okay, you might as well.
It's already over.

748
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:01,020
Get ready.

749
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:05,904
Sarah!

750
00:52:11,051 --> 00:52:12,689
Sarah.

751
00:52:13,618 --> 00:52:16,968
- Put it down.
- I can't, Ben! I can't!

752
00:52:16,993 --> 00:52:19,299
She's in my head! Get
her out of my head!

753
00:52:19,324 --> 00:52:21,631
Just put the gun down.

754
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:24,962
- Can we talk about it?
- No, it hurts. It hurts.

755
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:28,424
I have to turn it off!
I have to turn it off.

756
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:30,605
No, Sarah.

757
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:31,810
No.

758
00:52:31,893 --> 00:52:33,268
NO!

759
00:52:50,205 --> 00:52:52,259
Okay, guys.

760
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:55,861
We need to go.

761
00:52:57,534 --> 00:52:59,003
Come on.

762
00:53:06,812 --> 00:53:08,959
[WOODHAVEN]
CHURCH OF GOD

763
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,609
Why don't we just
turn her to the cops?

764
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,895
Because I don't want
more people to get killed.

765
00:53:25,177 --> 00:53:27,947
You really think
Tomlin can help her?

766
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:31,664
I don't think anyone else can.

767
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:36,958
So, you are a believer?

768
00:53:39,312 --> 00:53:42,188
Sarah would never
do that to herself.

769
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:56,506
<font color="#cb9696">God
bless our
Home</font>

770
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:03,600
- Who is it?
- It's Ben. Ben Hatcher.

771
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:18,652
- So she succeeded?
- Yes.

772
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:21,972
I warned you, son.

773
00:54:22,296 --> 00:54:23,841
I know.

774
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,329
Can you help her?

775
00:54:27,254 --> 00:54:31,412
- Where is she?
- She's in the car.

776
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:35,180
Okay, I'll prepare.

777
00:54:39,852 --> 00:54:43,236
Give me the camera.
You open it.

778
00:54:53,442 --> 00:54:55,389
Insurance.

779
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,511
Okay, Joey.

780
00:55:00,478 --> 00:55:03,030
Hey? What, what!
Grab her.

781
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,254
Joey.
Shit.

782
00:55:07,279 --> 00:55:09,443
- Shit. Joey.
- No, no, no, no.

783
00:55:13,387 --> 00:55:14,892
Shit.

784
00:55:17,803 --> 00:55:19,709
Untie me, Eddie.

785
00:55:20,246 --> 00:55:23,561
You said you just wanted me to film.
That was the deal.

786
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:27,554
I'm going to enjoy peeling
the flesh from your bone.

787
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,951
And I thought you were
going to let me live.

788
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:32,059
That was before you disappoint me.

789
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:33,757
In case you hadn't noticed.

790
00:55:33,782 --> 00:55:36,599
There is one and a half
priest in the next room.

791
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,241
I have seen the movies.

792
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:41,949
All I have to do is wait,
and I'll get my happy ending.

793
00:55:42,184 --> 00:55:44,399
Don't talk to her, Eddie.

794
00:55:44,859 --> 00:55:48,863
It about time, Father.
I've wanted to catch up.

795
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,442
I'm glad you're filming this.

796
00:55:51,467 --> 00:55:53,665
No one would believe it
if we didn't have it on camera.

797
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,827
I have something I
want to tell you, Ben.

798
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:59,106
Kate's still here,
behind the body.

799
00:55:59,131 --> 00:56:04,181
Ben, please help me!
Ben, please. Please help me!

800
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:07,880
Yes, tell them how he failed you.

801
00:56:09,262 --> 00:56:10,872
Oh!
You, son of a bitch!

802
00:56:10,897 --> 00:56:12,981
Everything has consequences, demon.

803
00:56:13,006 --> 00:56:15,769
I can't stand by while you
torment this child of God.

804
00:56:15,794 --> 00:56:17,374
I'm not tormenting her.

805
00:56:17,399 --> 00:56:19,823
I'm just raping her soul.

806
00:56:21,728 --> 00:56:23,298
No, I'll find your name.

807
00:56:23,323 --> 00:56:26,270
- Why does it matter?
- Every demon has it's weaknesses.

808
00:56:26,295 --> 00:56:28,779
We find it's name,
that's how we defeat it.

809
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:31,374
I have no weaknesses, Father.

810
00:56:31,399 --> 00:56:35,472
No, you sound overconfident for
somebody strapped to a bed.

811
00:56:35,497 --> 00:56:37,277
Still doing therapy, Ben?

812
00:56:37,302 --> 00:56:40,600
What's your diagnosis?
Daddy issues?

813
00:56:45,209 --> 00:56:50,157
- It's obvious. Hubris is your weakness.
- Exactly, it thinks it knows everything.

814
00:56:50,182 --> 00:56:52,178
Well.
I'll tell you what I do know.

815
00:56:52,203 --> 00:56:54,933
I'm going to corrupt this body
and then this soul

816
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:56,980
and you're going to watch,
helpless.

817
00:56:57,005 --> 00:56:59,758
In the name of Jesus Christ,
tell us your name!

818
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,801
How about you just guess?

819
00:57:01,826 --> 00:57:05,434
Dominus imperat vobis.
(The Lord commands you.)
Tell us your name!

820
00:57:05,459 --> 00:57:07,848
The Lord commands you.

821
00:57:11,655 --> 00:57:14,229
You wish to know my name?

822
00:57:14,451 --> 00:57:16,593
Throughout time I have
collected many names.

823
00:57:16,618 --> 00:57:20,315
- The Lord commands you.
- Shut up!

824
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,811
- Tell us your name.
- NO!

825
00:57:21,836 --> 00:57:23,956
- The Lord commands you.
- NO!

826
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:25,390
The Lord commands you!

827
00:57:25,415 --> 00:57:26,750
Nooooo!

828
00:57:26,774 --> 00:57:28,799
The Lord commands you!

829
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:31,408
TELL US YOUR NAME!

830
00:57:36,824 --> 00:57:39,426
You wish to know my name?

831
00:57:39,451 --> 00:57:42,914
Throughout time I have
collected many names.

832
00:57:43,014 --> 00:57:47,794
In this century, in this place,
you know me as Satan.

833
00:57:49,193 --> 00:57:51,723
But you know me as the Butcher.

834
00:57:52,647 --> 00:57:57,144
Last time you were excommunicated.
This time you'll die.

835
00:57:57,753 --> 00:58:01,681
Run away!
I know where I'll find you!

836
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:04,891
What's going on?

837
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:07,766
It's the same demon

838
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:11,424
The same on who had Jesse.
The exact same one.

839
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:15,005
- Maybe the thing was lying.
- You don't understand.

840
00:58:16,171 --> 00:58:18,894
It knows Kate.
Maybe that was Kate talking.

841
00:58:18,919 --> 00:58:20,290
No, you don't understand.

842
00:58:20,315 --> 00:58:24,341
- A demon can't lie about it's name.
- Why not?

843
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:28,868
When god created the universe,

844
00:58:28,893 --> 00:58:31,838
he gave man dominion
over all of the angels.

845
00:58:31,863 --> 00:58:34,269
Satan is a fallen angel.

846
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:38,268
We can command a demon even as
powerful as him to do our bidding.

847
00:58:38,293 --> 00:58:42,814
So, if we ask him
to reveal his name, he must.

848
00:58:43,658 --> 00:58:45,810
Oh god.

849
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:48,331
Father Tomlin.

850
00:58:48,478 --> 00:58:51,115
You're the last remaining
hope for Kate.

851
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:55,592
I have done what I could,
but I have reached my limits.

852
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:58,645
Now, If you don't do
anything to help her,

853
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,293
there is no one else who can.

854
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:01,947
I think we should leave.

855
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:04,090
- What?
- She committed murder, Ben.

856
00:59:04,115 --> 00:59:05,901
We have it on camera.
She needs to go to prison.

857
00:59:05,926 --> 00:59:08,087
That's not Kate.
Kate would never...

858
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:09,969
How the hell do you know
what Kate would do?

859
00:59:09,994 --> 00:59:11,637
She's the one who
wanted to be possessed.

860
00:59:11,662 --> 00:59:13,799
Now I say,
she got what she wanted.

861
00:59:16,236 --> 00:59:19,268
We're not leaving
until this is over.

862
00:59:19,293 --> 00:59:21,823
- None of us!
- Whatever. Try and stop me.

863
00:59:21,848 --> 00:59:23,511
You don't get it, do you?

864
00:59:23,536 --> 00:59:27,047
There is no where you can go
where he won't find you.

865
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:33,027
There is no escape from this!
Your coward!

866
00:59:33,409 --> 00:59:36,886
I can't believe he puts his
fucking hands on me, man. Fuck!

867
00:59:37,013 --> 00:59:39,497
Hell, no.
Uh uh.

868
00:59:39,588 --> 00:59:41,732
He ain't getting away
with that shit.

869
00:59:43,741 --> 00:59:45,877
I'm not going to die like this.
Fuck.

870
00:59:45,902 --> 00:59:48,638
Come on, Eddie.
Think, think, think, think, think.

871
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:52,930
I wonder if this
fucking door is open.

872
01:00:13,057 --> 01:00:14,420
Hello, Eddie.

873
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:17,978
- You're going to exorcise me on your own?
- No.

874
01:00:18,213 --> 01:00:20,377
Then what do you want?

875
01:00:20,623 --> 01:00:22,794
I'm going to cut you loose.

876
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:26,471
Know what?
I'm not going nowhere.

877
01:00:26,496 --> 01:00:30,323
- But you said you wanted me to untie you.
- That was then.

878
01:00:30,348 --> 01:00:32,141
If you want to get out of this,

879
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:34,850
your hands are going to
have to get a little dirty.

880
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:36,556
What do you want?

881
01:00:36,581 --> 01:00:40,371
Kill the priest,
and the good doctor too.

882
01:00:42,923 --> 01:00:45,948
- I can't.
- It's your choice.

883
01:00:45,973 --> 01:00:49,634
If you want to live,
you know what you have to do.

884
01:00:55,317 --> 01:00:58,170
- You alright?
- I'm fine.

885
01:00:58,545 --> 01:01:01,505
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

886
01:01:05,297 --> 01:01:06,847
Father?

887
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,229
I failed Jesse.

888
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:21,722
In the name of god,
let's save Kate.

889
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,581
That's my boy.

890
01:01:35,606 --> 01:01:38,400
Lord, have mercy.
Christ, have mercy.

891
01:01:38,456 --> 01:01:42,317
God, the son, redeemer of the world,
have mercy on us all.

892
01:01:42,342 --> 01:01:44,184
- From all evil, deliver us, oh Lord.
- I can feel your fear.

893
01:01:44,209 --> 01:01:46,248
You're afraid.
I can feel your fear.

894
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:50,571
Lord, save your servant, Kate.
I trust in you, oh Lord.

895
01:01:50,591 --> 01:01:54,778
I'm not Kate.
I am Lucifer, the Morning Star.

896
01:01:54,803 --> 01:01:59,115
You will remember my name forever.
For I shall burn it into your eyes.

897
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:03,720
And you will wear it as brand for
all eternity as you rot in hellfire.

898
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,951
What's happening?

899
01:02:04,976 --> 01:02:06,264
Don't worry, son.
The demon's afraid.

900
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,614
- He's trying to scare us.
- I'm not afraid.

901
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,472
You are afraid.
You are a sorry to saintship.

902
01:02:11,497 --> 01:02:14,880
I was afraid, but I fear no longer.
God is my helper.

903
01:02:14,905 --> 01:02:16,833
The Lord sustains my life.

904
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,086
All 10 minutes is that
I'll laugh at your life.

905
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:22,381
Then I'll personally defile
your soul for all eternity.

906
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:26,908
Lord, save your servant, Kate.
Let the enemy have no power over her.

907
01:02:26,954 --> 01:02:29,492
And the son of iniquity
be powerless to harm her.

908
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:31,607
It's no use, priest.

909
01:02:31,632 --> 01:02:36,018
Lord, send your aid from your
holy place and watch over her.

910
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,535
Lord, heed my prayer.

911
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,940
It doesn't matter.

912
01:02:38,965 --> 01:02:42,278
You will fail because you're
an insect before my power.

913
01:02:42,365 --> 01:02:44,719
You are nothing more
than an insect.

914
01:02:44,744 --> 01:02:47,763
And he is coming and he
will return you to hell...

915
01:02:47,788 --> 01:02:48,899
Kill !

916
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:51,784
Kill ! Kill !
Ah!

917
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,862
I'm sorry, Ben.
I had to do it.

918
01:02:53,887 --> 01:02:55,699
No!

919
01:03:14,844 --> 01:03:17,392
What would Mia say if
she could see you like this?

920
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:19,174
Shut your mouth.

921
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:23,353
- Suicide is a sin.
- Don't you fucking say another word.

922
01:03:23,378 --> 01:03:26,523
You know what they do
to pretty girls in hell?

923
01:03:28,882 --> 01:03:31,052
How could you do this?

924
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:41,157
A demon like me
is responsible for Mia too.

925
01:03:42,592 --> 01:03:47,628
- You're not going to win this.
- You can end it.

926
01:03:47,653 --> 01:03:50,731
Take the knife
and finish it.

927
01:03:53,978 --> 01:03:55,723
That's right...

928
01:03:57,851 --> 01:04:02,614
You heard me, old man.
There's no getting rid of me.

929
01:04:04,913 --> 01:04:07,141
What If I call the cops?

930
01:04:07,796 --> 01:04:09,626
Sure, call the cops.

931
01:04:09,651 --> 01:04:14,027
There's nothing I like more than a
more bodies to rip apart.

932
01:04:14,052 --> 01:04:16,403
You can't escape everytime.

933
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:19,577
Eventually, you'll wind
up in jail, like Jesse.

934
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:22,922
No, I won't.
Kate will.

935
01:04:22,947 --> 01:04:29,246
She will rot in the cell until they drag her
kicking and screaming to legal injection.

936
01:04:30,578 --> 01:04:32,746
And I'll find someone else.

937
01:04:32,771 --> 01:04:36,326
There are far more
deserving souls in prison.

938
01:04:37,879 --> 01:04:43,280
Take the knife and finish this.
It's the only way to set Kate free.

939
01:04:44,482 --> 01:04:46,380
What's with you?

940
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:49,128
I can't murder you.

941
01:04:49,153 --> 01:04:54,723
What're you going to do now?
Sit around? Until this body rots?

942
01:04:57,566 --> 01:04:59,138
No.

943
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:02,590
No.

944
01:05:05,937 --> 01:05:10,268
When time began,
the word was there.

945
01:05:10,347 --> 01:05:13,216
And the word was
face to face with God.

946
01:05:13,241 --> 01:05:15,870
And the Word was God!

947
01:05:16,994 --> 01:05:19,045
Not this again.

948
01:05:19,158 --> 01:05:22,714
How about you untie me.
I got some place I need to be.

949
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:23,929
Silence, demon.

950
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:26,288
Oh!
Silence, demon!

951
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:29,098
You sound like Father Tomlin.

952
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:32,369
I want you to take me.

953
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:36,807
Excuse me.

954
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,835
Can you think of a
better vessel to corrupt?

955
01:05:40,289 --> 01:05:43,643
Can you imagine how much power
you would have using my soul.

956
01:05:43,668 --> 01:05:47,593
You would do that for Kate
after everything she's done?

957
01:05:48,696 --> 01:05:51,194
I walk this path myself.

958
01:05:52,538 --> 01:05:54,820
I could have ended this.

959
01:05:56,677 --> 01:05:58,400
All of this.

960
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:03,838
But I'm going to fix it.

961
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:07,632
You don't know what you're asking.

962
01:06:08,163 --> 01:06:12,357
I command you to possess my soul.

963
01:06:19,674 --> 01:06:21,189
Ben?

964
01:06:27,064 --> 01:06:32,757
Oh, Ben. You poor fool.
You thought you could control me.

965
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:38,333
Dr. Hatcher...
Gaze upon your first victim.

966
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:42,696
The woman you sacrificed your soul for.

967
01:06:42,813 --> 01:06:45,718
You killed him!
You killed my baby!

968
01:06:45,743 --> 01:06:48,553
You killed my baby!

969
01:06:55,523 --> 01:06:57,015
Kate.

970
01:06:58,578 --> 01:07:02,412
Sorry, Ben.
It had to be done.

971
01:07:16,045 --> 01:07:18,063
That's the proof.

972
01:07:18,442 --> 01:07:23,019
To the families of those who were
hurt in order to make this video,

973
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:26,701
Your loved ones were
martyred in truest sense.

974
01:07:26,726 --> 01:07:31,659
Their sacrifices made, so that
the world would know the truth.

975
01:07:31,684 --> 01:07:34,922
That my son Jesse, was innocent.

976
01:07:37,823 --> 01:07:41,464
The infamous Kate Winters' video
continues to make headlines tonight.

977
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:44,570
State and federal law enforcement officials
are combing through the video

978
01:07:44,595 --> 01:07:47,001
to find out if the
gruesome footage is real,

979
01:07:47,034 --> 01:07:49,368
and to determine if there have
been any other victims

980
01:07:49,393 --> 01:07:51,543
besides those depicted in the footage.

981
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:54,802
Kate Winters, the mother of the
infamous serial killer, The Butcher,

982
01:07:54,827 --> 01:07:56,461
is wanted for questioning.

983
01:07:56,486 --> 01:07:59,077
But, so far there are no leads
as to her whereabouts.

984
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:01,055
Kerry Marshall has the story.

985
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,057
I'm standing outside the now
vacant home of Kate Winters,

986
01:08:04,082 --> 01:08:05,454
mother of the Butcher.

987
01:08:05,479 --> 01:08:09,809
In week following the release of her
disturbing and violent documentary,

988
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:12,011
no one has seen
nor heard from her.

989
01:08:12,036 --> 01:08:15,606
News team 8 took to the streets
to find out what do you think.

990
01:08:15,631 --> 01:08:18,485
I think it's real.
I just don't see how it could be fake.

991
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:22,268
So, you believe that this is
definitive proof of the Devil?

992
01:08:22,293 --> 01:08:25,856
Well. If the devil does exist, 
then he isn't hiding it.

993
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:28,986
She used to be such a 
wholesome community, right?

994
01:08:29,011 --> 01:08:31,291
Are you concerned for
your family's safety?

995
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:34,186
Absolutely. I don't think the cops are 
doing near enough to find this woman.

996
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:36,761
I mean, why is she still out there?
Why is she still on the loose?

997
01:08:36,786 --> 01:08:38,121
It is absolutely a fake.

998
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:40,407
Have you heard a little movie 
called "Paranormal Activity"?

999
01:08:40,432 --> 01:08:42,437
Because it's basically the same thing.

1000
01:08:42,462 --> 01:08:46,231
Police have reported that the people
in the video are missing.

1001
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:48,749
So? That doesn't mean it's not 
some kind of elaborate prank.

1002
01:08:48,774 --> 01:08:49,972
I mean,

1003
01:08:49,997 --> 01:08:52,720
if you were going to kill a bunch of people, 
you wouldn't put it on camera..

1004
01:08:52,746 --> 01:08:55,057
Do you think the 
Kate Winters' video is real?

1005
01:08:55,082 --> 01:08:58,115
Oh, absolutely, I do.
Very much so.

1006
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:01,202
All of it? 
The murders, the supernatural part?

1007
01:09:01,227 --> 01:09:03,871
Absolutely. 
Let me read something to you,

1008
01:09:03,896 --> 01:09:05,796
as from the Book of Revelation.

1009
01:09:05,818 --> 01:09:07,501
And the fifth angel sounded,

1010
01:09:07,526 --> 01:09:10,695
and I saw a star fallen from 
heaven unto the earth:

1011
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:14,150
and to him was given 
the key to the bottomless pit.

1012
01:09:14,175 --> 01:09:19,073
That's the beginning of the end times.
And we are there, we're in Revelation today.

1013
01:09:19,098 --> 01:09:20,614
We're living it. 
We're breathing it.

1014
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:25,312
This video is real and it is the
beginning of something beautiful.

1015
01:09:25,337 --> 01:09:26,716
My friends and I think it's real.

1016
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:29,863
I mean, her son killed all those people, 
why wouldn't she do it.

1017
01:09:29,888 --> 01:09:33,810
At this point, we're not going to release 
a statement on an open investigation.

1018
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:37,007
We can say that the footage 
is being analyzed very carefully.

1019
01:09:37,032 --> 01:09:39,409
The people in the video
have been reported missing.

1020
01:09:39,434 --> 01:09:44,528
We will exhaust all efforts to locate them 
before opening any type of investigation.

1021
01:09:44,553 --> 01:09:48,200
We reached out to the local diocese 
of the Catholic Church for comment.

1022
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:50,976
But, so far have
received no response.

1023
01:09:51,001 --> 01:09:53,217
For Channel 8 News,
I'm Kerry Marshall.

1024
01:09:53,242 --> 01:09:54,627
Back to you, Graham.

1025
01:09:54,652 --> 01:09:55,548
Thank you, Kerry.

1026
01:09:55,573 --> 01:09:58,167
We'll have more for you
as the story unfolds.

1027
01:09:58,192 --> 01:10:01,314
I'm Graham Ulkins, 
for Channel 8 News.
