1
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:15,146
Police! Help me!

2
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:17,777
Help me.

3
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,713
They're going to kill me.
Help me.

4
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:28,436
What're you doing?
They're after me!

5
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:32,790
Help me.

6
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:39,837
I got it.

7
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,672
You're 20 minutes late.

8
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:11,526
Well, you've seen the traffic
around here? It's worse then Bagdad.

9
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,350
Take a seat.

10
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:17,507
Now...

11
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:20,131
you said you've come up a few
pay grades, Billy, last time...

12
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:24,653
I saw you, you sat in front of your
desk at Langley trying to nail that...

13
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:27,341
dirty blonde secretary
with the nice ass.

14
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:28,819
What was her name?

15
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,960
Last time I saw you, you and your
boys were getting your asses kicked...

16
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:33,599
all over downtown Medellin
by Escobar.

17
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:39,207
Yeah... I remember.

18
00:05:41,627 --> 00:05:43,243
Gentlemen.

19
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,560
These two men, we're not even
sure of their real names.

20
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:00,481
They're poppy farmers, from about
60 miles outside of Kabul.

21
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:02,696
And they'll be
very willing to produce...

22
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:07,114
about a billion dollars a year
high grade black tar Heroin.

23
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:10,161
The deal is, that they'll supply
the Salazar kartel with Heroin...

24
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:14,707
well under market price, in
exchange for access to the line.

25
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,353
The line?

26
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:19,405
The drugs routes from this side
of the border to the U.S.

27
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:22,742
They're bringing a suitcase,
probably smuggled from Pakistan.

28
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:25,745
- So, what's in it?
- We don't know.

29
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:28,784
What we do know
that it's hermetically sealed,

30
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:30,415
and we can't x-ray it.

31
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,106
This suitcase is a test.

32
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:34,744
If they can get through
with that thing,

33
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:36,662
we've got a...
a big problemen.

34
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:40,690
The bottom line we can't guarantee
that something won't make it through.

35
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,658
By the end of day what we're
talking about is the Taliban...

36
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,960
with a pipe line
for whatever they want...

37
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:50,467
to the U.S, nukes, drugs,
bio-weapons, people...

38
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:55,166
That will be all for now,
Randall. Thanks.

39
00:06:57,402 --> 00:06:58,840
So...

40
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:01,113
who would be stupid enough
to let this happen?

41
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,219
I thought you people had this
whole area under control.

42
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,440
And Salazar... he's dying.

43
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:13,278
Numero two is taking over.

44
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,511
Pelon, that piece of work.

45
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:17,224
If this deal goes through,

46
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:19,526
that makes him the biggest
drug trafficker in the west,

47
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:22,108
even bigger
than our buddy, Escobar.

48
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:28,463
So... huh, now what? This all
sounds like a local problem to me.

49
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:33,471
No, until 6 hours ago,
it was mine... officially.

50
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,151
Now it's yours.

51
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:39,475
No, no, I retired in 96.

52
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:41,709
Whatever, why don't you start
by giving us some idea...

53
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,203
what your units
operations are in this area.

54
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:46,854
- My unit?
- Hm.

55
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,264
How close are you?

56
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:55,796
Pelon is a paranoid psycho.

57
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:57,514
He keeps moving from one
safe house to the other.

58
00:07:57,515 --> 00:08:00,292
He won't be easy to track, but we'll
give you all the intel we have.

59
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,101
So, you have some one inside?

60
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:04,060
Yes, one, but I'm not
gonna give you that.

61
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,968
Why not?

62
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:09,881
Too deep, and... besides,
I don't trust you.

63
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:14,185
So, what's the verdict?
Did you ever nail...

64
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:16,257
that dirty blonde
with the nice ass?

65
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,922
Just get the job done,
clean, if possible.

66
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:37,855
Rest.

67
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:12,964
- Yeah.
- Mark Shields? Crossover.

68
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:16,997
This bread, is the body of Christ,
and this wine, is the blood Christ.

69
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:27,110
This bread, is the body of Christ,
and this wine, is the blood Christ.

70
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:37,157
This bread, is the body of Christ,
and this wine, is the blood Christ.

71
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:43,072
This bread...

72
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:49,865
is the body of Christ,
and this wine,

73
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,825
o sangue de Cristo.

74
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:07,746
This bread, is the body of Christ,
and this wine, is the blood Christ.

75
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:13,960
This bread, is the body of Christ...

76
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:19,419
You take of that thing
we've discussed?

77
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,142
It's done.

78
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:28,603
Do you know... the new guy?
What's his name?

79
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:30,897
Martin.

80
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:34,906
There's always some new guy, huh?

81
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,759
I took care of him.

82
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,382
That's good.

83
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:46,166
It's good to get your hands
dirty some times, huh?

84
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:53,934
Let's go.

85
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:02,697
...and this wine,
is the blood Christ.

86
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:13,049
The Arabs?

87
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:16,682
- On their way to his house.
- What?

88
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,037
Go back to your house.

89
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,762
I'm gonna be a minute.

90
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:25,773
- Entertain 'em.
- Hey, Pelon...

91
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,716
Damn...

92
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:43,362
- Can I help you, sir?
- Ola, Marin, Tim Marin.

93
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:47,021
Yes sir, your room is ready.

94
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:51,740
Have you, uh... seen this guy?

95
00:13:57,164 --> 00:13:59,119
I don't know this guy.

96
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,668
- I need a room.
- It's 5 dollars for 15 minutes.

97
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:44,704
I need one for 2 days.

98
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:47,393
You don't wanna stay here,
there's no hot water...

99
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:49,677
Just give me a room,
the corner if you got one?

100
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:58,529
Thanks.

101
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:11,869
That's... uh,
3 visits in 4 months.

102
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:14,280
You must need something.

103
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:20,391
I need you...

104
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,612
to see if someone knows about
the Afghanistan deal.

105
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,231
Of course the do, Rene,
I told you.

106
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:29,911
I warned you.

107
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:36,174
Then I got a leak
in my organization.

108
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:37,805
Maybe.

109
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,713
Probably,
but that's not the point.

110
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:44,265
Well, what is your point?

111
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:48,091
The point ist, that no matter how much
money you start to make on this deal.

112
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:50,637
The Americans will not
let you deal with terrorist.

113
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:53,485
Even if they're not terrorists.

114
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:58,306
I didn't ask for your advice,
the deal is going through.

115
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:01,573
It's my show now.

116
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:03,617
Obviously.

117
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:11,175
Sit down, Rene.

118
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,859
Why do you show me
such disrespect?

119
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,804
Sit down.

120
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:32,663
You know... uh,
people thought I was crazy...

121
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:36,021
when I turned over the family
buisness to a none family member.

122
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,169
But I always knew
I was doing the right thing.

123
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,052
Because you have
a steadiness about you.

124
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:49,349
And I believe in you, but...

125
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,687
use your brain.

126
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:54,328
And you must be smarter
then your enemy.

127
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:58,073
What're you trying to say?

128
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,915
The Americans...
they're very smart,

129
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,984
but sometimes they can be
incredibly stupid.

130
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:06,813
They spend all this...

131
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:10,333
money, time and energy
on so called war on terror.

132
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,879
They put satellites
up in space.

133
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:15,196
They can ram a smart-bomb
up a camel's ass...

134
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,594
from a situation
5 thousand miles away.

135
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:20,272
And everytime the U.S.
kills an Al Qaida leader,

136
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:23,245
what happens? There's a new one
before the body is cold.

137
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:26,279
They do it a million times,
and never get it...

138
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,484
because the real solution,
always eludes them.

139
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,618
Do you know what that is?

140
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:51,076
Why don't you align with me.

141
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:54,181
Do nothing.

142
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:56,433
Nothing?

143
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:58,643
No.

144
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:01,658
If you want it shut down
the fundamental flaw system...

145
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,566
all you gotta do
is step out of it's way...

146
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,632
and it'll shut itself down.

147
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:11,099
Nature has a way
of correcting itself.

148
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:19,678
You're going to church
like I told you?

149
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,436
Almost every day.

150
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:26,106
Father Antonio is a good man, you
should always be straight with God.

151
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:31,766
If you turn your back on God,
God might turn his back on you.

152
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:33,370
Then you're in trouble.

153
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,261
- You mind checking that out for me?
- Yeah, I'm gonna check it out for you.

154
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:45,619
Hey?

155
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:52,660
And next time don't make
such a dramatic entrance.

156
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:54,674
Remember I'm dying.

157
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:11,140
They're here.

158
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:21,807
I grew up here.

159
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:26,456
20 years of work,
2 years in Mexico City.

160
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:30,417
And here I am, a babysitter
for fucking Arabs'.

161
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:32,255
They're Afghans'.

162
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,852
Whatever.

163
00:21:49,092 --> 00:21:50,953
Welcome, Gentlemen.

164
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:54,254
"As-Salamu Alaikum".

165
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:56,556
- "As-Salamu Alaikum".
- "As-Salamu Alaikum".

166
00:21:56,557 --> 00:21:58,938
Welcome.

167
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:04,827
I'm afraid my Spanish
is deplorable, Mr. Juarez.

168
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:09,165
And the Spanish translation books
are scares in my country.

169
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:13,851
With that said, it would be good
to know, that we're safe here.

170
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:16,609
In English,
if you don't mind.

171
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:21,036
You're completely safe here.

172
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:29,561
Please... you've come
a long way, let's go inside.

173
00:22:53,863 --> 00:22:57,700
Manhattan bar, ask for Jos?

174
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,156
I'm looking for Jos?

175
00:23:33,064 --> 00:23:36,712
This is Mexico, brother.
Everyone's named Jos?

176
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,960
Wait here.

177
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,889
Want to buy me a drink?

178
00:23:56,274 --> 00:23:57,680
Uh... no.

179
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:00,454
Want a woman?

180
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:02,341
No, I'm good,
I'm fine, thanks.

181
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:09,111
Why the fuck
did you come here for then?

182
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:37,886
This isn't a good time,
come back a little later.

183
00:24:40,054 --> 00:24:42,600
I think you should take off.

184
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:45,158
You haven't seen any
piece a shit bounty hunters,

185
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:46,405
have you?

186
00:24:46,406 --> 00:24:48,081
Why don't you two guys
grab a couple beers, huh?

187
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:50,286
I said, have you seen...

188
00:25:12,237 --> 00:25:14,357
Second floor.
Knock once.

189
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,781
Go back home, fucking Gringo.

190
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:32,097
Go.

191
00:26:48,934 --> 00:26:51,821
Something tells me,
you've never done that before?

192
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:57,061
It is not commonly, acceptable
behavior... in our culture.

193
00:26:57,863 --> 00:27:03,646
I thought it was stoning,
you know, stoning for fucking.

194
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:06,484
Isn't that what you guys do?

195
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:09,216
We're civilized people.

196
00:27:11,285 --> 00:27:13,073
We don't stone people anymore.

197
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:17,098
Oh... "civilized", I see.

198
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:21,593
I assume you are
Mr. Cantons' Lieutenant?

199
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:24,086
I do work for Don Salazar.

200
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:30,838
Yes, if I am correctly informed,
Mr. Salazar has fallen ill.

201
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:35,326
Yes... he has.

202
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,841
We're simple farmers,
Mr. Juarez.

203
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:43,551
We have a... product
that has a market demaind...

204
00:27:43,552 --> 00:27:45,470
the product
happens to be heroin.

205
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:47,947
So, that makes us all
common criminals...

206
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:50,826
in the eyes of the
American goverment, doesn't it?

207
00:27:52,752 --> 00:27:54,530
Does that scare you?

208
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,854
Their goal is
to crush Islam, Mr. Juarez.

209
00:27:57,855 --> 00:28:01,309
Their goal is
to make our people slaves.

210
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,197
For their imperialist interests,

211
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:04,490
so frankly, sir,
we to say to them,

212
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:07,511
as we said to the Russians.
Fuck them!

213
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,323
Okay.

214
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,266
So... just some odd question...

215
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,225
what if Pelon,
sorry, Mr. Canton...

216
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:29,460
what if some terrible faith would
to befall him, in the next few days?

217
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:31,648
How would that effect the deal?

218
00:28:34,905 --> 00:28:37,757
I don't anticipate that.

219
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:42,258
So, we wait...
and see what happens.

220
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:48,875
In the meantime... enjoy.

221
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:05,672
They get one whiff of pussy
and they crack.

222
00:29:05,673 --> 00:29:07,936
It's like they're starving.

223
00:29:10,263 --> 00:29:13,376
How's our special project
coming along?

224
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,738
Pablo didn't check in.

225
00:29:18,518 --> 00:29:21,552
- Did you try his cell?
- I've been calling all day.

226
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,770
No anwser.

227
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:49,481
Maybe it's just rumor.

228
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:54,809
But someone said
you was trying to kill me..

229
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:01,560
Some big elaborate plan.

230
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:05,419
Is that true?

231
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,552
I can't hear you.

232
00:30:26,946 --> 00:30:29,831
So, maybe it's just
a rumor then.

233
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,637
- You dirty bastard!
- Just stop it, man.

234
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:36,788
Fucking

235
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:44,612
I want a little respect.

236
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:51,747
This is my town.

237
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,633
Let's go home.
I'm gonna be late for church.

238
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:31,491
I think he would understand.

239
00:31:35,406 --> 00:31:39,614
I mean, does he really
care about, like details?

240
00:31:41,473 --> 00:31:44,979
God is not going to bless
a drug deal... Rene.

241
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:54,364
Whether you understand this or not,
You can not buy... God's favor.

242
00:31:56,018 --> 00:31:58,981
You can not buy mine.

243
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:06,244
I wouldn't be so sure
about that, father.

244
00:32:11,782 --> 00:32:16,745
God's work is...
is many things.

245
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:19,753
But he's not free.

246
00:32:22,585 --> 00:32:24,241
It is the wish of Salazar,

247
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:29,613
that I give you this...
spiritual guidance, so...

248
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,810
I am here
out of respect for him.

249
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,285
Christ.

250
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,338
Forgive me father,

251
00:32:50,757 --> 00:32:52,695
for I have sinned.

252
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,043
I gave you 80 pesos.

253
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:21,993
No, you didn't give me anything.

254
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:24,273
How stupid do you think I am?

255
00:33:24,273 --> 00:33:27,214
That bullshit worked last week.
Not today.

256
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:28,937
That's all the money I have.

257
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:29,896
I'm not interested.

258
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:31,299
Give me that.

259
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,889
- Damn bitch...
- Hey, look!

260
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:46,892
A god-damn piece-a-ass
finely gets you smoked.

261
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:48,235
You know,
you almost got youself hurt...

262
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:51,746
Oh, yeah, that was close,
Let's go get a drink.

263
00:33:54,673 --> 00:33:56,995
I'm surprised
you didn't take that Irak deal.

264
00:33:56,996 --> 00:33:58,915
A lotta guys making
a furtune overthere.

265
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:02,563
Ah... to much competion.

266
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:04,886
Of every nickel and dime
including their mother overthere,

267
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:07,380
trying to make a name
for themselves.

268
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:14,086
Killing farmers, putting AK-47's
on their labs, Jesus Christ!

269
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:17,174
And fucking
getting paid to do it too!

270
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:22,227
They ain't got dick
for night-life overthere.

271
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:25,420
I think I just my sit ass
in Mexico City,

272
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:27,722
get a new job here and then.

273
00:34:27,723 --> 00:34:29,312
Woman are easy.

274
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:34,189
Actually,
they're quite desperate.

275
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,506
Desperate works for me.

276
00:34:39,508 --> 00:34:42,647
- When did you get in?
- 3 days ago.

277
00:34:45,106 --> 00:34:47,308
I was surprised
to get the call.

278
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,185
To tell you the truth,

279
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:52,255
I didn't think I hear from you
after that Bogota situation.

280
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:54,063
Oh, well, past is the past.

281
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:55,598
Oh, yeah...

282
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:58,948
One moment.

283
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:01,380
You and Iraq would have
never mixed...

284
00:35:01,381 --> 00:35:03,106
you're completly right
by staying here.

285
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:05,087
- You couldn't have done it.
- Ah'ah, no.

286
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,328
What'd you find out?

287
00:35:08,446 --> 00:35:10,355
Strange world down here.

288
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,329
- It ain't gonna be easy.
- Remember this, it never is.

289
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:21,414
We'll go there tomorrow.

290
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,962
You just be ready.

291
00:35:26,922 --> 00:35:30,948
Hey... uh, Schields,
give me... uh...

292
00:35:31,354 --> 00:35:34,016
What happened to the money
I send you?

293
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:37,418
Come on, man.

294
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,618
Thank you.

295
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:09,902
Someone went into the Manhattan.
He tore up Hector and his boys.

296
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,674
Who was he?

297
00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:19,596
Some Americano.

298
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:23,448
Probably a bounty hunter.
It's a contract.

299
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:28,483
- Who's paying him?
- You know who.

300
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,485
Diablo?

301
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:36,239
He will never except you!

302
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,695
And now he's hanging out
with that Gringo all the time.

303
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,268
Martin!

304
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:51,524
You know my mother...

305
00:36:52,101 --> 00:36:56,084
she tried to cross from the
La Linea hills when I was 9.

306
00:36:57,332 --> 00:36:59,907
Everyone  told her
it wasn't hard.

307
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:04,450
She just left it all.

308
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:10,076
Early...
the sun wasn't even up.

309
00:37:13,385 --> 00:37:16,076
They never found the body.

310
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:20,429
She was the only family I had.

311
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,393
Diablo is like family to me.

312
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:26,832
Keep your fucking theories
to yourself!

313
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:32,686
Oh God, forgive me.

314
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:38,290
He will.

315
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,320
I know why you're
keeping us here.

316
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:46,782
Tempting us... with this...
barbaric lust and sin.

317
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:50,122
Buying yourself time,
so you can do the unthinkable.

318
00:37:50,122 --> 00:37:52,349
Oh, it's thinkable, Mohammed.

319
00:37:53,213 --> 00:37:56,002
And I'm not the only one
who's had such a thought.

320
00:37:58,692 --> 00:38:01,717
I've been trying to do busines
with Mr. Salazar for some time,

321
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:03,511
he was never interested.

322
00:38:03,512 --> 00:38:06,161
Another scared puppet
of U.S interests.

323
00:38:07,696 --> 00:38:10,303
I respected him.

324
00:38:10,304 --> 00:38:13,740
Everyone respected him,
and trusted him.

325
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:18,223
Maybe...

326
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:21,667
now we have a friend here.

327
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:25,167
Pelon is no friend...

328
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:29,424
to anyone.
You should know that.

329
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,194
Leave us alone.

330
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:40,011
He's really bothering you.

331
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:43,414
- Real bad.
- This fucking Queer...

332
00:38:43,672 --> 00:38:46,782
he's trying to take my deal.

333
00:38:54,836 --> 00:38:56,585
Queer?

334
00:38:57,737 --> 00:38:59,846
Don't use that word around me.

335
00:39:01,094 --> 00:39:02,664
It angers me.

336
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:06,630
Call him off.

337
00:39:07,686 --> 00:39:09,758
He's the least of your worries.

338
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:19,867
If the DEA and the CIA
put a contract out on you,

339
00:39:19,868 --> 00:39:21,211
you have more problems.

340
00:39:22,554 --> 00:39:25,656
You're on an exclusive list.

341
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:32,698
Eskobar, Norjega, they had, uh...
whole armys to protect them,

342
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:34,698
and look what happened to them.

343
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:40,499
You're needed here...

344
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:45,333
to start things up,
and be careful.

345
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:50,263
Be careful on who you trust.

346
00:39:53,744 --> 00:39:55,142
Let me get some rest.

347
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,658
Be careful with that.

348
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,894
Or you gonna pay for it.

349
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:47,314
Range?

350
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:50,968
220 yards if he comes out
the front door.

351
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,524
Oh, Jesus. These chocolates
down here killin' me, man.

352
00:40:58,054 --> 00:40:59,776
Perimeter?

353
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:03,398
Clear.

354
00:41:13,636 --> 00:41:15,297
7 seconds.

355
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:23,501
Take him.

356
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,513
You gonna lose a good shot.

357
00:41:37,553 --> 00:41:38,736
Hey.

358
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:44,587
It's cancer.

359
00:41:57,193 --> 00:41:58,586
There was no shot.

360
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:01,593
Go back.

361
00:42:08,136 --> 00:42:09,387
All right.

362
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:40,956
I don't know Schields,
you don't look so good.

363
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:44,590
Maybe you oughta think
about taking some time off.

364
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:47,191
You gotta have a bunch of cash
stashed by now.

365
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:48,341
All right.

366
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,755
Oxy?

367
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,564
What?

368
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,785
Hey, it's fine,
keep me steady... it's fine.

369
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:18,340
I don't know about
this thing, Schields.

370
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:21,357
I'm starting to hear
Mexico City calling me.

371
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:23,172
If you have damn doubts, then go.

372
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:26,561
- It ain't that.
- Then what?

373
00:43:29,715 --> 00:43:33,492
Nothing... You know I always
got your back, I'm cool.

374
00:43:34,356 --> 00:43:36,337
I call you in the morning.

375
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:08,730
It's part of the buisness, man.

376
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:10,266
It happends.

377
00:45:10,267 --> 00:45:14,435
Don't talk to me...
about the buisness.

378
00:45:15,536 --> 00:45:18,166
You don't understand.

379
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:20,897
I tell you what I do understand.

380
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:26,920
I worked in a lot of places,
and this place is a fucking mess.

381
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:31,700
It wasn't always.

382
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:41,220
Salazar...
ran this line with dignity.

383
00:45:43,014 --> 00:45:45,366
There was order here.

384
00:45:45,885 --> 00:45:47,483
Respect.

385
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:50,914
So, what happened?

386
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:58,797
Pelon... and that Mario
ass-hole from Mexico City.

387
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:02,072
They planned it all out.

388
00:46:02,744 --> 00:46:04,766
Planned what out?

389
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,738
To take over.

390
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,403
They killed the right people
at the right time.

391
00:46:15,745 --> 00:46:20,130
Salazar got sick,
he grew weak... fast.

392
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:25,476
He tought that he was saving
his holy life...

393
00:46:25,477 --> 00:46:27,778
by putting Pelon in
charge of the buisness.

394
00:46:29,985 --> 00:46:32,581
But he was dying anyways.

395
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,269
He was selfish.

396
00:47:18,023 --> 00:47:20,839
- Yeah?
- I'm going home today.

397
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,291
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

398
00:47:26,576 --> 00:47:29,054
Okay, I'll be ready.

399
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:32,037
At 4 o'clock,
I'll meet you there.

400
00:47:51,272 --> 00:47:53,194
You have oxycodone?
(pain reliever)

401
00:48:06,707 --> 00:48:09,767
No, no, no, give me... give me
the bot... put it in the bottle...

402
00:48:09,768 --> 00:48:10,804
put it in the bottle.

403
00:48:13,983 --> 00:48:15,252
Fuck!

404
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:07,465
My range?

405
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:10,631
Too much activity, we need
to wait and hold off on this.

406
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:14,694
- Environment?
- You don't have schot.

407
00:49:14,695 --> 00:49:18,680
- Het is niet veilig, you copy?
- No, I'm taken him.

408
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,803
I'm sick of this place,
I'm going home.

409
00:49:22,804 --> 00:49:25,294
- Schields?
- I'm taking him.

410
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:53,321
He's awake, mama.

411
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:56,180
Anna, get off the bed.

412
00:49:56,853 --> 00:49:58,824
Go, go and play
in the other room.

413
00:50:12,172 --> 00:50:13,978
How long have I been here?

414
00:50:14,363 --> 00:50:16,294
Two days.

415
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:20,665
You had a hundred dollars
in your sock.

416
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:23,639
I gave fifty to the 2 guys
who carried you here.

417
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:26,309
That's your change on the table.

418
00:50:26,886 --> 00:50:29,996
- I'm not a thief, you can count it.
- Where am I?

419
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,534
4 blocks from your hotel.

420
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:41,132
Just lay down.

421
00:50:42,571 --> 00:50:44,718
I need a phone.

422
00:50:45,582 --> 00:50:47,191
No phone.

423
00:50:49,317 --> 00:50:51,110
Just try to get some sleep.

424
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,634
Don't you know that
that cigar is gonna kill me?

425
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:15,687
What, this? No. I got this from...
Castro's private stash.

426
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:18,153
It's... uh,
not gonna hurt anybody.

427
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:24,567
You know, my dad...
he died in 93.

428
00:51:24,568 --> 00:51:27,732
He was involved back then,
in all a this shit when he died.

429
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:30,655
He was a tough son-of-bitch...

430
00:51:30,656 --> 00:51:33,532
and it was...
hard to see him go like that.

431
00:51:36,717 --> 00:51:38,860
Is that what you here to do?

432
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,063
relieving me out of the
disgrace of dying like this?

433
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,966
No, Salazar.

434
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:50,251
Now my Bidders seemed to be able
to work with you in the past.

435
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:53,763
Mainly out of respect for
your father and grandfather.

436
00:51:56,391 --> 00:51:57,919
Respect?

437
00:51:58,495 --> 00:52:01,879
We let that
Nicaraguan thing pass, and...

438
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,888
let you make all a that money
of... uh, that pig, Eskobar...

439
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:09,534
and then when you had
your troubles... in Mexico City,

440
00:52:09,535 --> 00:52:11,549
we took care of those for you.

441
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:13,384
Hmm?

442
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:16,187
Feel thankful we don't...
care what you animals...

443
00:52:16,188 --> 00:52:17,818
do to each other down here.

444
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,527
The user line stays open.

445
00:52:23,085 --> 00:52:24,943
Right.

446
00:52:24,944 --> 00:52:27,229
You didn't think for a minute...

447
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,723
that we were gonna let you
make a deal...

448
00:52:29,724 --> 00:52:32,510
with some corain thumping...

449
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:34,908
towel headed terrorist now,
did you?

450
00:52:35,783 --> 00:52:39,175
I'm not in charge anymore,
it's not my show.

451
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,855
- Really?
- Really.

452
00:52:42,815 --> 00:52:46,091
Now will you tell...
Napoleon, that...

453
00:52:46,092 --> 00:52:49,837
Mr. Water and Loo are in town,
and they don't miss.

454
00:52:52,808 --> 00:52:55,232
Your other kid, the Fairy...

455
00:52:55,233 --> 00:52:57,965
he... has a team
of his own in town, too.

456
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,261
So, I don't think your...
boys long for this world.

457
00:53:03,616 --> 00:53:06,574
He seems like some else,
doesn't he.

458
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:09,415
That's a shame.

459
00:53:33,522 --> 00:53:35,734
I'm looking for Jos?

460
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,935
Good morning.

461
00:56:19,763 --> 00:56:21,607
Oh, thank you.

462
00:56:23,373 --> 00:56:27,493
I took the rest of the money
this morning... for breakfast.

463
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:30,334
I have to go.

464
00:56:31,295 --> 00:56:33,378
I figured that.

465
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:39,059
- Drugs?
- What?

466
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:41,226
You in drugs, guns?

467
00:56:41,227 --> 00:56:44,391
You're not a Pimp,
I know pimps when I see them.

468
00:56:47,346 --> 00:56:49,506
Okay, don't tell me.

469
00:56:49,987 --> 00:56:53,399
But when you do what I do,
you get to know people, quick.

470
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:57,466
You... are not as bad
as you look.

471
00:56:58,522 --> 00:57:00,946
Probably you're not as bad,
as you need to be.

472
00:57:01,906 --> 00:57:05,079
And Anna likes you, she thinks
you might be her father.

473
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:07,374
Where is he?

474
00:57:08,814 --> 00:57:10,840
I can tell you the truth,
or a lie...

475
00:57:10,841 --> 00:57:13,838
- the same to me.
- The truth.

476
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,096
I have no idea.

477
00:57:17,097 --> 00:57:19,365
I never really knew him.

478
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:22,259
It was Meth.

479
00:57:23,698 --> 00:57:25,654
There were a lot of men.

480
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,736
- Your still on it?
- Meth, no.

481
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:34,468
It's been five months.

482
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,158
You have family?

483
00:57:40,638 --> 00:57:42,825
Yes and no.

484
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:45,169
If you know what I mean?

485
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:51,945
Thank you.

486
00:57:52,425 --> 00:57:54,276
Be careful.

487
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:57,237
Say good-bye, honey.

488
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:12,260
- Let's go for pancakes.
- Okay.

489
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,955
Wire?

490
00:58:21,299 --> 00:58:22,922
Wire.

491
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,631
It's too late,
your friend's dead.

492
00:58:45,649 --> 00:58:47,610
So, where we?

493
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:55,857
I can't hear you.

494
00:59:05,514 --> 00:59:07,720
Who hired him?

495
00:59:09,351 --> 00:59:10,982
Huh?

496
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:13,836
Who hired You?

497
00:59:13,837 --> 00:59:15,956
Huh, was it Diablo?

498
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:20,174
It was Diablo, huh?
Was it DEA?

499
00:59:20,943 --> 00:59:22,623
Who send you?

500
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:23,930
Huh?

501
00:59:29,207 --> 00:59:31,405
I think we should stop
tickling him.

502
00:59:31,406 --> 00:59:33,132
What do think, Mario?

503
00:59:45,825 --> 00:59:47,821
Grab his fucking legs.

504
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:52,398
He's gonna talk.

505
01:00:00,284 --> 01:00:02,351
You need something, man?

506
01:00:15,383 --> 01:00:17,522
Hope you boys
are being careful.

507
01:00:18,098 --> 01:00:23,192
I was down here in 82...
I had the runs for a month steady.

508
01:00:24,152 --> 01:00:29,211
It's a toss up really,
food is... unlike the pussy.

509
01:00:29,787 --> 01:00:32,662
Something that looks delisious,
could only be a dream.

510
01:00:35,546 --> 01:00:37,107
And make it neat.

511
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,984
There's a lot of eyes
on us down here.

512
01:00:39,985 --> 01:00:43,447
So, no collateral damage,
no civilians.

513
01:00:43,988 --> 01:00:45,524
We're always neat.

514
01:00:45,525 --> 01:00:48,400
Budapest?
Call that neat?

515
01:00:50,316 --> 01:00:53,189
Well anyway,
you gonna do what you do...

516
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:57,067
at his warehouse.
Call me when you're done.

517
01:00:58,015 --> 01:01:00,084
And... be careful,

518
01:01:00,085 --> 01:01:03,633
runs wasn't the only thing
I got down here in 82.

519
01:01:24,763 --> 01:01:26,560
How did you get in here?

520
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:30,597
You didnt hurt that poor kid
who's taking care of me, did you?

521
01:01:34,237 --> 01:01:36,050
Did you love my mother?

522
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:41,105
That's the passed, Eduardo,
I don't wanna get in to it...

523
01:01:41,106 --> 01:01:42,257
Did you love her?

524
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,241
I don't think so.

525
01:01:49,943 --> 01:01:52,688
It's more complicated then that.

526
01:01:54,466 --> 01:01:56,239
I had a wife,

527
01:01:56,528 --> 01:01:58,438
daughters,

528
01:01:59,014 --> 01:02:01,430
there was too much to lose.

529
01:02:02,295 --> 01:02:05,619
I don't think love like that
exists anywhere.

530
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:09,869
- Then you killed her.
- No, her illness killed her.

531
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:11,748
You were her illness.

532
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:24,261
I'm gonna win this.
Don't get in my way.

533
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:27,145
There's no winning
against Pelon.

534
01:02:27,146 --> 01:02:31,029
He's too... focused,
too single minded.

535
01:02:31,997 --> 01:02:33,919
He's dead.

536
01:02:34,592 --> 01:02:35,935
Eduardo?

537
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:46,930
I'm not gonna see you again.
And you know that.

538
01:02:49,135 --> 01:02:50,706
I know.

539
01:02:54,093 --> 01:02:55,849
You cannot win this, Eduardo.

540
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,799
Cover me, go! Go!

541
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,333
Go! Go!

542
01:04:22,394 --> 01:04:23,855
Go!

543
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:35,892
Go!

544
01:04:39,911 --> 01:04:41,548
Go!

545
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:51,118
Sniper! Right there!

546
01:05:36,952 --> 01:05:39,084
We have a problem, sir.

547
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,007
There was another shooter!

548
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:43,829
We missed the target.

549
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:56,670
What the fuck is going on, man?

550
01:05:57,246 --> 01:06:00,151
- They keep coming!
- Bounty hunters!

551
01:06:00,536 --> 01:06:02,756
And they knew we be here!

552
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:05,678
Why do you say that?

553
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:07,980
I'm saying
someone is ratting us out.

554
01:06:28,914 --> 01:06:31,322
Come on, pick up! Pick up!
Pick up!

555
01:06:31,323 --> 01:06:32,761
Pick up!

556
01:06:33,242 --> 01:06:36,919
Finely... what the fuck
is going on here?

557
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,837
There's some guy
shooting around here.

558
01:06:38,934 --> 01:06:40,968
He is your friend?

559
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:43,146
Move, move.

560
01:06:50,734 --> 01:06:52,091
You busy?

561
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,670
Who're you talking too?

562
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:10,143
How long...

563
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,579
how long I know you?

564
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,346
All my life.

565
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,260
Go to hell.

566
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:36,617
You first.

567
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:48,495
You have to get outta here now.

568
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:54,583
Not you, Brandy.

569
01:10:48,261 --> 01:10:49,910
What happened to your eye?

570
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,798
It's always the small ones.

571
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:58,219
What?

572
01:10:58,795 --> 01:11:02,245
The small ones... the ones
that are so small inside...

573
01:11:02,246 --> 01:11:04,164
by hurting you
make them feel bigger.

574
01:11:07,395 --> 01:11:10,102
Oh, nothing lets you
feel bigger.

575
01:11:13,105 --> 01:11:14,760
So?

576
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,900
I didn't think
that I would see you again.

577
01:11:26,026 --> 01:11:28,030
My friend was killed.

578
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:31,309
I'm sorry.

579
01:11:32,173 --> 01:11:34,823
And I wasn't there.

580
01:11:38,283 --> 01:11:40,636
I don't have
a lotta friends to lose.

581
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:09,569
I killed a woman.

582
01:12:22,075 --> 01:12:25,197
It's a few years ago.

583
01:12:35,099 --> 01:12:36,312
It's not...

584
01:12:36,313 --> 01:12:39,190
it's not as if I haven't
killed people before.

585
01:12:44,425 --> 01:12:45,863
It's...

586
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:49,663
it's that I killed
this woman.

587
01:12:55,735 --> 01:12:57,449
And nobody cared.

588
01:13:08,081 --> 01:13:09,617
So...

589
01:13:11,728 --> 01:13:13,166
that is what you do?

590
01:13:13,551 --> 01:13:15,493
You... kill people?

591
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:20,111
Yeah... that's what I am.

592
01:13:24,176 --> 01:13:27,967
No... no it's not.

593
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:31,902
- Yeah...
- No, it's not.

594
01:13:33,835 --> 01:13:40,392
You're just broken...
like me, like this place.

595
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:44,164
You just...
you just fell apart.

596
01:13:44,165 --> 01:13:49,105
I... have been trying
for a long time too.

597
01:16:53,566 --> 01:16:56,163
You wouldn't give me
the respect to kill me yourself.

598
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:01,860
You hire Gringos and bounty hunters
to do what you should do?

599
01:17:02,582 --> 01:17:04,069
You're a coward.

600
01:17:05,029 --> 01:17:07,489
I'm not scared of you.

601
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:10,121
You should know...

602
01:17:10,122 --> 01:17:13,490
I'm man enough
to kill you myself.

603
01:19:43,507 --> 01:19:45,254
What're you waiting for?

604
01:19:45,831 --> 01:19:47,937
Are you
a fucking coward too, huh?

605
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:53,969
Kill me!

606
01:20:19,988 --> 01:20:21,324
Keep going.

607
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,420
What you doing?

608
01:20:27,317 --> 01:20:29,083
Where're you going?

609
01:20:32,401 --> 01:20:34,263
- Hey!... Come on!
- No!

610
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,237
What happened?

611
01:21:34,408 --> 01:21:36,538
You let me down, Renesito.

612
01:21:37,402 --> 01:21:39,371
I trusted you,
you let down.

613
01:21:40,645 --> 01:21:44,460
What's going on?
You... you're not sick.

614
01:21:45,507 --> 01:21:48,904
Hm... I feel much better now.

615
01:21:52,557 --> 01:21:55,485
You really think I was gonna turn
the family buisness over to you?

616
01:21:55,485 --> 01:21:58,841
That my grandfather build
and my father died for.

617
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:10,826
Money's by the door.

618
01:22:12,989 --> 01:22:17,532
- I... I can't...
- It's alright, thank you.

619
01:22:19,825 --> 01:22:21,459
Thank you.

620
01:22:31,058 --> 01:22:32,023
What...

621
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:36,968
what the fuck's going on?
How'd you know this guy?

622
01:22:38,657 --> 01:22:40,493
Padre!

623
01:22:41,741 --> 01:22:43,712
Padre, help him out.

624
01:22:50,327 --> 01:22:52,390
That's your friend.

625
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,883
Help me.

626
01:22:58,306 --> 01:22:59,920
Take that off.

627
01:23:01,456 --> 01:23:03,766
I was raised Catholic.
I don't want that image in my head.

628
01:23:27,894 --> 01:23:29,373
Okay.

629
01:23:30,963 --> 01:23:32,538
Okay.

630
01:23:35,746 --> 01:23:39,199
Look at me!... Renesito.
Look at me!

631
01:23:41,026 --> 01:23:43,635
Nature has a way
of correcting itself.

632
01:24:08,951 --> 01:24:10,981
You should have let me know
that you had your own shooter.

633
01:24:10,981 --> 01:24:12,804
We almost had a real mess here.

634
01:24:13,763 --> 01:24:17,116
After all these years...
where is the trust?

635
01:24:17,117 --> 01:24:18,643
Next time.

636
01:24:19,891 --> 01:24:22,768
You should know this is not
some great day for me.

637
01:24:22,769 --> 01:24:24,542
I took no pleasure in this.

638
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:30,322
Je hebt wat je wilde, ik
I'll be happy.

639
01:24:30,323 --> 01:24:33,764
We are unreasonable
ass-holes, Javier.

640
01:24:34,053 --> 01:24:37,260
The ugly American...
We are never happy.

641
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,431
I'm happy.

642
01:24:43,918 --> 01:24:45,344
Why not?

643
01:24:47,846 --> 01:24:50,080
I gotta go see a family.

644
01:24:52,961 --> 01:24:54,989
Let's go clean this mess up.

645
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,104
Anna! I don't hear you
getting ready!

646
01:25:05,047 --> 01:25:08,451
Anna,
get your things together now.

647
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:20,307
Anna, come on.

648
01:26:07,882 --> 01:26:10,470
What, mommy?
Don't we have to go?

649
01:26:16,249 --> 01:26:21,914
No, sweetheart.
We don't have to go.
