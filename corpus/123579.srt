1
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,065
I've lived in the
theatre since I was a kid.

2
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:21,965
what I don't know about acting

3
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:22,766
isn't worth knowing.

4
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:25,299
now, you may be 20 years
old and just beginning,

5
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,033
but I think you're a genius.

6
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,900
you've got magnetism,
but no idea how to use it.

7
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,566
you have to grab the audience
by the throat and say:

8
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,299
"now, you buggers, you
pay attention to me!"

9
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,033
and remember this,

10
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,466
when you're on the stage acting,

11
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:46,000
theatre is the only reality.

12
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:49,765
everything else, the world outside,

13
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,233
what civilians call the real world,

14
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:54,499
is nothing but fantasy.

15
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,933
and I bloody well
won't let you forget it.

16
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,099
the trouble is, darling,
I'm an incurable romantic.

17
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:06,933
I believe in love,

18
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,699
I believe in happiness,

19
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:11,333
I believe in us.

20
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,033
(Archie) no, you don't.
you're just saying that.

21
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,266
there's someone else, isn't there?

22
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,766
I love you, I do.

23
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,066
I do, I
love you--

24
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:25,465
and I used to believe

25
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,433
we'd live happily ever after.

26
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,032
didn't you?

27
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,099
with every fiber of my being.

28
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,633
only now...

29
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:38,199
[audience applauding]

30
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:22,866
[car honking]

31
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,199
[clock bell tolls]

32
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,398
[door squeaking]

33
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,432
good morning, miss Lambert.

34
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:30,233
good morning, Margery,

35
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:32,599
is anyone with my lord and master?

36
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:34,866
(Margery) no.

37
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,066
darling, what are you doing here?

38
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:39,799
I want an answer, Michael.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,465
what's the question?

40
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,266
what did I say to you

41
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:44,533
before we went to sleep last night, hmm?

42
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,199
uh, I give up. what did you say to me

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,065
before we went to sleep last night?

44
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,165
I said I was tired.

45
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,766
it seems a perfectly natural thing
to say before you go to sleep.

46
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,533
Christ, Michael, you can be
an irritating little shit!

47
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:00,766
Julia, Julia, really,

48
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,199
if your public could
only hear your language.

49
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,432
I want them to hear.

50
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:06,365
I want every bloody one of them to hear.

51
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm tired. I am utterly exhausted.

52
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,299
I need a holiday.

53
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:11,799
just admit it, Michael.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,033
you've never understood what it means

55
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,398
to carry a play,

56
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,465
to sweat it out night after night.

57
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,266
I'm the only one who takes it
seriously, Michael, you know that.

58
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,366
all you do is count the money and
think it's a bloody great lark.

59
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,599
take the play off.

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,566
but we'll lose a fortune.

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,765
our partner won't like it.

62
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,699
to hell with dolly!

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,732
[sighing]

64
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:38,432
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

65
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,566
god, I didn't mean to be so vile.

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,899
it's just I'm-- I'm
near to breaking point.

67
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,733
everything's so tedious.

68
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,632
[sighing]

69
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,566
I want something to happen.

70
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,600
what?

71
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,399
I wish I knew.

72
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,899
please. please close the
play at the end of the month.

73
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,033
[exhales]

74
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,032
yeah. I really do
have to think about it.

75
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,300
we can't have the theatre dark.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,600
hmm?

77
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,933
I'll try and see what
I can do. I promise.

78
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,033
hmm?

79
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,332
please.

80
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:14,632
I promise.

81
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,266
thank you.

82
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,065
you were very quiet

83
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:19,698
leaving the house this morning.

84
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,032
well, I didn't want to wake you.

85
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,165
you were dead to the world.

86
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,600
hmm. I did my exercises
and went for a run.

87
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,600
exercises, running...

88
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:27,633
god, Michael,

89
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,633
you're the vainest man in London.

90
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,466
me, vain? nonsense.

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,400
[giggles]

92
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,333
I just want to preserve my magnificent
good looks for as long as possible.

93
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,766
[chuckling]

94
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:39,765
oh, yes, speaking of good looks,

95
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:42,233
did you notice that
young man as you came in?

96
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:43,765
no.

97
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:44,865
he's an American.

98
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:47,266
son of a friend of a
friend of Eddie Gilbert's.

99
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,033
I can't see what that's
got to do with me.

100
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,965
he admires you tremendously.

101
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,466
oh, he sounds frightfully intelligent.

102
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,733
what's his name?

103
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,733
can't remember.

104
00:05:58,933 --> 00:05:59,865
uh, unfortunately,

105
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,765
he's as poor as a church mouse.

106
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:04,233
I thought we might give
him a spot of lunch.

107
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,033
well, he's awfully
good-mannered, for an American.

108
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,633
(Julia) uh!

109
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,832
rubbish mail, Margery.

110
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:13,633
yes, Mr. Gosselyn.

111
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,966
uh, I would like to
introduce you to my wife,

112
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,033
Julia Lambert.

113
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,565
Julia, this
is-- this is--

114
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:21,199
this is the young man
I was telling you about.

115
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,399
he wants to learn the business,

116
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,765
so we're starting him
off with our accountant.

117
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:27,066
it-it's an honor to
meet you, miss Lambert.

118
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:28,832
I wonder if we could persuade you

119
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,833
to come and eat a chop with us.

120
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,100
Michael will drive you back after lunch.

121
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:35,698
gee, that's real kind of you.

122
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,033
you two take the lift,
I'll take the stairs.

123
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,166
last one down's a sissy.

124
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,199
miss Lambert,

125
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,632
could I-- could
I ask you a favor?

126
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,666
I can't give you any more
room, if that's what you mean.

127
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,066
no, no, no, it's, uh... I wonder...

128
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,400
would you...

129
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,399
would you let me have a photograph?

130
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:55,299
of course.

131
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,299
gee, that's swell of you.

132
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,699
I've seen you in
farewell, my love 3 times.

133
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,865
you haven't. have you really?

134
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,232
it's such a silly play.

135
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,132
oh, it's not the play,

136
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,333
it's you. you're just... just great.

137
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,732
I'm glad you liked me.

138
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:09,132
liked you? I loved you.

139
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,498
[elevator thudding]

140
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:11,299
[door squeaking]

141
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:12,998
I won. (Julia) what?

142
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,766
well done.

143
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,166
come on, Mr... uh...

144
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,666
all an actress like Julia needs

145
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:43,998
is a vehicle.

146
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,198
it's the actors the public go to see,

147
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:46,999
not the play.

148
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,198
that's true in my case. I'd see
you in anything, miss Lambert.

149
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,699
but you know what I'd
really like to find out?

150
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:52,932
how did you start?

151
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:54,232
how did you get to be where you are,

152
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,865
owning a theatre, top of the tree?

153
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,099
clean living and hard work. cigarette?

154
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,300
we owe it all to a rude, foul-mouthed
brute called Jimmie Langton.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,732
we were in his repertory
company in Middlesbrough.

156
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:05,500
he knew all there is to know
about theatre and acting.

157
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,899
that's where I met Michael.
that's how we began.

158
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:10,132
I was a rotten actor.

159
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,698
yes, but you have presence.

160
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:14,166
the audience always
gasps when you come on.

161
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:17,066
it's his dazzling good looks, you see.

162
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,000
gee, this is fascinating. fascinating.

163
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,333
dreadfully jealous of him?

164
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:22,998
you're very sweet, but
I know perfectly well

165
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,532
that all I can play are
diplomats, lawyers and politicians.

166
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,898
I'm more interested in
the business side. that's--

167
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:29,365
yes, but you know as well as I do

168
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,332
that we'd be nothing without Jimmie.

169
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,766
I always lay a place
for him at the table.

170
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:35,132
just in case he turns up.

171
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,399
he's been dead for 15 years.

172
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,399
yes, but you never know.

173
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,933
he was a monster.

174
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,366
uh, how do you spell your first name?

175
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,600
t-o-m.

176
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:51,733

hoy!

183
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,733
hoy!

184
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,098
hoy!

185
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,332
hoy!

186
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:13,399
(Archie) for god's sake,

187
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,666
don't torture yourself like this, Laura.

188
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:17,933
[Julia sobbing]

189
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,933
no one will ever know
how much I loved him.

190
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,700
he was my earth, my moon,

191
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,366
all the stars in the firmament.

192
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:42,600
farewell, my love.

193
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,433
[audience applauding]

194
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,066
bravo! bravo!

195
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,500
[people laughing]

196
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,700
no, there's nothing left for me now

197
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,965
but to tour Canada and Australia,

198
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,566
god help me.

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,765
nonsense, miss Lambert.

200
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:16,165
it's not nonsense.

201
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:16,966
[sighing]

202
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,166
I've decided to retire
and let myself go.

203
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,666
I'll have potatoes for lunch
and potatoes for dinner.

204
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:27,866
beer. god, I love beer!

205
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,666
and treacle pudding and
cherry tart and cream.

206
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,833
cream, cream, cream, cream, cream...

207
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,032
[breathing deeply]

208
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:37,032
as god is my judge,

209
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,098
I'll never eat a lettuce leaf again.

210
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:40,198
[doorbell ringing]

211
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,500
oh, god, I bet I know who that is.

212
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,833
good afternoon, Evie.

213
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,899
oh, Mrs. de vries, what a surprise.

214
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,333
uh, I hope this isn't inconvenient

215
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,532
but I have to see miss Lambert

216
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:55,765
on a business matter.

217
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:58,066
she isn't having one
of her afternoon naps,

218
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,266
is she?

219
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,932
wait a minute.

220
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,600
[door squeaking]

221
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,698
guess who's here.

222
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:08,632
show her in.

223
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,565
business, she says, but isn't it funny

224
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,365
how she always manages
to time her visits

225
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,232
when you're lying stark bollock naked.

226
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,733
enough of that, you dirty-minded slut.

227
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,533
show her in.

228
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:22,632
Mrs. de vries.

229
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,765
(dolly) Julia, darling.

230
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:25,600
dolly, dear. hmm.

231
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,632
oh, I'm so sorry.

232
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,366
I always seem to call when
you're--you're otherwise engaged.

233
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,332
[laughing]

234
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:33,532
tea? lovely.

235
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,966
ignore me. I'll--I'll just
sit here quiet as a lamb

236
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,166
until you're done.

237
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:40,999
so Evie said

238
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,233
something about business. hmm?

239
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,532
what? oh, yes.

240
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,066
um, Michael tells me you
want to close the play.

241
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:51,899
my husband's a devious little runt.

242
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:54,732
oh, that's unfair.

243
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,932
he was perfectly right to consult me.

244
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,000
we're partners. the 3 of us.

245
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,732
a perfect combination.

246
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,799
my money, his know-how, your genius.

247
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,499
I'm exhausted, dolly.

248
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,300
[grunts]

249
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,232
I feel twice my age which makes me 90.

250
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:10,833
I'm bored. life has
nothing in store for me.

251
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,698
you mean that or are you acting?

252
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,732
I never know when you're acting.

253
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,198
I'm not acting.

254
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,299
I'm near to having a breakdown.

255
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,733
I feel as though my
life's come to an end.

256
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,799
all right. all right.

257
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,399
all done.

258
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,466
oh, thank you, you're a dear.

259
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,899
uh.

260
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,666
are you really near a breakdown, Julia?

261
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:34,833
oh, I don't know. I don't know.

262
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm in such an odd state at the moment.

263
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,432
[inhaling]

264
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:41,233
it's as if...

265
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,799
it's as if the curtain's
come down on act 1,

266
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,066
but I have no idea
what happens in act 2.

267
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,532
[inaudible mimicking]

268
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,132
I-I'm in a sort of limbo.

269
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,566
waiting for something
to happen. but what?

270
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,633
what?

271
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,133
oh, please, dolly, be my friend.

272
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,399
oh.

273
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,165
make Michael take the play off.

274
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:03,966
I need a holiday.

275
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,399
I could visit--visit
my mother in jersey,

276
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,632
and then visit you in France.

277
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,233
oh. I could swim in
your pool. in the nuddy.

278
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:13,399
[laughing]

279
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,632
(woman) lovely flowers for someone.

280
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,066
(Evie) oh, hello, a
blooming florist's shop.

281
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:24,065
who sent them? Mrs. de vries?

282
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:26,299
very likely. or lord Tamerley.

283
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,866
here, don't forget,
you've got dinner with him

284
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,532
after the show tonight.

285
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:31,399
yes, I know.

286
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,733
expect you'll have to
turn on the waterworks

287
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,799
for him again as per usual.

288
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,200
I wish you'd teach me to cry real tears.

289
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,466
the times I've needed them.

290
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:44,033
oh, here's a card.

291
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:45,866
[humming]

292
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,533
from Mr. Thomas fennel,
Tavistock square.

293
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:51,932
what a place to live.

294
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,832
who the hell do you suppose he is, Evie?

295
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,632
oh, some feller knocked all of a heap

296
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,899
by your fatal beauty, I expect.

297
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,732
probably cost a fortune.

298
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:01,866
went without dinner for a week.

299
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:03,866
oh, pull the other one.

300
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:06,932
[man singing]

301
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,065
beginners, please, miss Lambert.

302
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:09,866
mmm-hmm.

303
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,698
well, whoever Mr. Thomas fennel is,

304
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,132
I think it's all right

305
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,132
having a young man send me flowers

306
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,598
at my time of life.

307
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,032
I mean, it
just shows you--

308
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,899
how do you know he's a young man?

309
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,733
he's probably over 80.

310
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,566
go to hell.

311
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,699
[band playing]

312
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,666
[people talking and laughing]

313
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm on my way I'm on my way

314
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,133
I'm busy 'cause I'm on my way

315
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,500
[people applauding]

316
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,566
thank you.

317
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,833
thank you.

318
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:55,066
Julia Lambert.

319
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:06,333
the champagne now, my lord?

320
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,299
thank you, Antoine.

321
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,265
and for you, madame Lambert?

322
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:12,299
I'd prefer beer but I mustn't,

323
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,233
so I'll make do with bubbly.

324
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:16,033
thank you.

325
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,033
[giggling] it's for you. open it.

326
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,666
[woman singing]

327
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,299
oh.

328
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,233
it's a portrait of Clairon.

329
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,232
she was a great actress,

330
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:32,399
and I believe you
have many of her gifts.

331
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,733
Charles, you are sweet.

332
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,899
I thought you might like it.

333
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,566
it's by way of being a parting present.

334
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,998
you're going away?

335
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,399
no. but I shan't be seeing you anymore.

336
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,733
oh, Charles, not again.

337
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:48,766
[inhaling]

338
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,833
no. this is becoming a ritual. why?

339
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,699
we have such a beautiful
friendship, Julia.

340
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,799
it's unique in my
experience, but people talk.

341
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,733
they don't understand.

342
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,899
and even though we know the truth,

343
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,865
if we go on seeing one another,

344
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,765
there will be a terrible scandal.

345
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,665
no, there won't.

346
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,966
Michael and I lead separate lives.

347
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,566
that's why we're so happily married.

348
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,733
more or less.

349
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,233
jumped-up little tart,
that's what she is.

350
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:20,133
never stops acting, on-stage or off.

351
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,333
she's just one big pose.

352
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:23,766
dashed pretty.

353
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,033
shut up, Rupert, don't
show your ignorance.

354
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,699
I know all about her.

355
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,600
we were both born

356
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,866
in the channel islands, jersey.

357
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,166
her father was our
doctor. a jersey doctor!

358
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:38,233
you can't get more common than that.

359
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,866
it's only common sense, darling.

360
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,133
I don't want to lose you.

361
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,533
I--I have few
friends. real friends.

362
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,098
you're the only person in my life

363
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:55,533
with whom I can be entirely myself.

364
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:58,233
I'm terribly low at the moment.

365
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,565
I--I
need you.

366
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,799
let's go on seeing each other. please.

367
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,200
uh, please forgive us intruding
like this, miss Lambert.

368
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,633
my friend and I are
such very great admirers.

369
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:12,099
and I wonder... do you remember me?

370
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,033
Florence Coltraine, isn't it?

371
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,432
[whispers] correct.

372
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,766
Rupert and I want you
to settle an argument.

373
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,200
I think I used to know
your father in jersey.

374
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,098
he was a doctor, wasn't he?

375
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,533
he used to come to
our house quite often.

376
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:27,865
actually, he was a vet.

377
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,299
he used to go to your house

378
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,699
to deliver the bitches.

379
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,633
the house was full of them.

380
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,866
life is just a bowl of cherries

381
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,333
don't take it serious
life's too mysterious

382
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:44,200
you work, you save you worry so

383
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,500
but you can't take
your dough when you go

384
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:52,966
[exclaims]

385
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:55,200
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to frighten you.

386
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:57,066
t-o-m.

387
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:58,932
you remember.

388
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:01,033
did you like
the--the flowers?

389
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:03,500
oh, Mr. Thomas fennel, Tavistock square.

390
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,465
yes, of course, thank you.

391
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,766
well, uh, I couldn't
decide between a single rose

392
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:11,598
and every flower in the store.

393
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,966
is that why you're here
at this time of night?

394
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,332
to find out if I received the flowers?

395
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,700
no. you see, I don't have a phone yet.

396
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,432
[door opening] and I...

397
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,865
[Wilson clearing throat]

398
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:22,666
um...

399
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,866
you wouldn't come to tea
with me one day, would you?

400
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,433
I don't see why not.

401
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,032
will you really?

402
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,098
how about next Friday?

403
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,299
138 Tavistock square, 4:30?

404
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:36,533
[laughing]

405
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,799
all right. I'll be there.

406
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,965
gee, that's swell. see you then.

407
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,799
the sweet things in life
to you were just loaned

408
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:47,700
so how gonna you lose
what you've never owned?

409
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,166
life is just a bowl of cherries

410
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:53,932
[tom and Julia laughing]

411
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,266
so live and laugh at it all

412
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:59,465
(chorus) life is just a bowl of cherries

413
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,799
don't make it serious
life's too mysterious

414
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,132
you work, you save you worry so

415
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,599
but you can't take your
dough when you go go

416
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,033
keep on repeating "it's the berries"

417
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,633
the strongest oak must fall

418
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:17,965
oh?

419
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,700
I saw you drive up.

420
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,465
I'm afraid I'm on the 3rd floor.

421
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,999
I hope you don't mind.

422
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,165
and if I do?

423
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:25,866
[both chuckle]

424
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:32,065
we're there.

425
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,799
thank god for that.

426
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:34,965
[door squeaking]

427
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,633
[Julia panting]

428
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,299
[laughs]

429
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,133
the gas ring's in the bathroom.

430
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,599
oh.

431
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:51,732
it isn't the Ritz, but it's home.

432
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:54,266
no, it's--it's
charming. it's so London.

433
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:57,099
it reminds me of my early days.

434
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:58,799
[laughing]

435
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,333
I have to put coins in the gas meter.

436
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,965
oh, yes, so did I.

437
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,633
[both laughing]

438
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:07,500
have some cake. I bought it specially.

439
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,500
oh.

440
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,833
I shouldn't, but I will.

441
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,599
[laughs]

442
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,299
[sighing]

443
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,466
you know something? you
ought to be in movies.

444
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,033
real actresses don't make films.

445
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,366
but beautiful actresses do.

446
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,800
hmm.

447
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,200
well, I saw you in nobody's
perfect on Broadway.

448
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,165
I was 14 at the time.

449
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:33,132
I wish you hadn't told me that.

450
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:33,933
[both laughing]

451
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,266
I stood outside the stage door
and, uh, I got your autograph.

452
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:38,865
you asked me my name. I told you.

453
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,833
you knew how to spell it then.

454
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,000
[both laughing]

455
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,633
what's so funny?

456
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,599
you remind me of something.

457
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,666
what is it?

458
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,700
my husband. in a scene we had to play.

459
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,033
he didn't know how to sit down.

460
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,999
[both laughing]

461
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,299
Jimmie made him do it
over and over again.

462
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,765
uh, I can't stay long.

463
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,033
I must have a nap before my performance.

464
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,699
but you've only just arrived.

465
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,799
and you--you can't
go without, uh,

466
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,166
without, well, seeing the view.

467
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:22,799
it's really great.

468
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,166
if you just come over to the window...

469
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,032
isn't it terrific?

470
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:40,965
(tom) I just love London.

471
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,299
it's so big, but it's
also kind of friendly.

472
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,799
and all those people,
each with their own lives.

473
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,132
I can't explain it.

474
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,933
when I first came to London,
I stood in Piccadilly circus

475
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:54,098
looking at the lights

476
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:55,665
and the people and the taxis,

477
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:57,599
and I said out loud:

478
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:00,166
"one day I'm going to conquer you."

479
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,366
and you have.

480
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:04,333
have I?
I wonder--

481
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:28,898
[sighing]

482
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,633
look at my hair.

483
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:32,766
[Julia panting]

484
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:34,898
uh, here.

485
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:36,366
oh?

486
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,099
thank you.

487
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:43,233
and I thought you were
such a shy young man.

488
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:47,666
when am I-- when am
I gonna see you again?

489
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,433
you want to see me again?

490
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,832
what do you think?

491
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll ring you up one of these days.

492
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:57,066
uh, my hat...

493
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:59,299
oh, uh...

494
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
good. well, uh, I have a phone now.

495
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,599
and the number's museum-4516.

496
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,099
so promise you'll call soon.

497
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,933
on my honor.

498
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,099
[laughs] you know, don't come down.

499
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,000
I can see myself out.

500
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,398
[birds twittering]

501
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,099
for Christ's sake, Julia,
what do you think you're doing?

502
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:24,765
you're supposed to be playing a whore,

503
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:27,333
not a schoolgirl with a
crush on her gym mistress.

504
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:28,766
you kissed him

505
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,000
as if you were frightened
of catching his cold.

506
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,432
when you kiss, you should feel

507
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:34,799
as if your bones are
melting inside your body.

508
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:36,366
tongues, darling,

509
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,065
that's what it's about, tongues.

510
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:38,898
now, I know you're a virgin.

511
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:41,299
don't give me the waterworks,
Julia, I'm too old for that.

512
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,166
you're a virgin, so what you have
to do is find a handsome young man,

513
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,333
like your juvenile
man, Michael Gosselyn.

514
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:48,533
go back to your rooms,

515
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:51,033
take your clothes off, lie
on the bed, open your legs

516
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,566
and ask him to give it to
you hot, sweet and strong.

517
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,666
if that doesn't improve your
acting, then nothing will.

518
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,000
right, let's do it again.

519
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,966
[Julia laughing]

520
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:07,400
what's so funny?

521
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,400
[sighing]

522
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,467
I feel as though
I'm a 2-year-old.

523
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,534
that's 88 years you've lost in a week.

524
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,099
[giggling]

525
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,799
tell us the secret,

526
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,867
we'll bottle it and make a fortune.

527
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,466
hmm.

528
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,167
[door closing]

529
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:44,167
damn it all, miss Lambert,
you don't look so bad.

530
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,333
you can go on
playing 25-year-olds,

531
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:53,200
30-year-olds for a
good long time yet.

532
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,867
and then what?

533
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:56,767
whoo!

534
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,833
mothers, grandmothers and old maids.

535
00:24:59,333 --> 00:24:59,933
[snorting]

536
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,000
bugger playwrights.
can't write for women.

537
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,500
they're all men, that's the trouble.

538
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,732
[telephone ringing]

539
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:08,500
[sighing]

540
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,333
yes?

541
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:17,999
good morning.

542
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,700
[Julia laughing]

543
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:21,833
t-o-m.

544
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,499
you promised to call me.

545
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,899
(Julia) give a girl a chance.

546
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,767
(tom) when am I going to see you again?

547
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:30,300
as soon as I have a moment to spare.

548
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:33,100
come to tea after the matinee.

549
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:36,132
oh, I'm not falling for that one again.

550
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,600
how about dinner after the show then?

551
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:42,833
if you insist.

552
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,333
I do.

553
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,299
[piano playing]

554
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,333
on the silver screen

555
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:54,100
he melts her foolish
heart in every single scene

556
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,300
although she's quite
aware that here and there

557
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,333
are traces of the cad about the boy

558
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,566
[laughing]

559
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,667
lord knows she's not a fool girl

560
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:13,534
she really shouldn't care

561
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:17,267
lord knows she's not a school girl

562
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,834
in the flurry of her first affair

563
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:25,667
will it ever cloy this odd diversity

564
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,934
of misery and joy I told them

565
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,167
look, there's lord Crumley over there.

566
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,532
and I think that's lady Laweston.

567
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:39,899
what have you been reading,  Debrett's?

568
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,000
Debrett's? no,  the tatler.

569
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:42,967
[laughing]

570
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:45,066
oh, you have to know who's
who to get on in this town.

571
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,200
oh, you want to get on, do you?

572
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I want to get on you, Julia.

573
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,367
don't be disgusting.

574
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:53,034
but I want you.

575
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:56,032
I do.

576
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,133
[glasses clinking]

577
00:26:57,334 --> 00:26:59,534
you're the loveliest girl that one

578
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:03,499
I want you.

579
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,532
[giggling]

580
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:07,034
your conversation's
frightfully limited, tom.

581
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:09,599
dance with me.

582
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,467
what time is it?

583
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,334
oh, well, uh, I... I
forgot to put on my watch.

584
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,100
have you pawned it?

585
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,532
no, no, I just, uh,

586
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:22,767
I--I dressed in
rather a hurry tonight.

587
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,500
they'll never believe me

588
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,034
they'll never believe me

589
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,767
that from this great big world

590
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,467
you've chosen

591
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,267
[laughing]

592
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,133
[Julia screaming]

593
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,500
[continues laughing]

594
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,034
he treated you like a tart.

595
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,534
which of course is what you are.

596
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:04,133
(Julia) he was my earth, my moon,

597
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,567
and all the stars in the firmament.

598
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,800
[whispering] the photo's
in the wrong place!

599
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:25,000
farewell, my love.

600
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:36,967
you were wonderful tonight, my darling.

601
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:38,899
[whooping]

602
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,366
bloody marvelous.

603
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,167
you almost made me cry.

604
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:43,799
only almost?

605
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,899
I'll kill whoever set the photo.

606
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,700
thanks, Archie.

607
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,499
and what've you done to your eyes?

608
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,933
hmm? some new makeup?

609
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:52,134
I've never seen them
shine like that before.

610
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:53,999
your call, Mr. Dexter.

611
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,800
hmm.

612
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:55,633
[Archie laughing]

613
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,967
sorry about the photo,
it won't happen again.

614
00:28:58,933 --> 00:28:59,799
hmm.

615
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,566
your call, miss Lambert.

616
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,433
you're forgiven.

617
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,300
[audience applauding]

618
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:09,100
what's the matter with her?

619
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,199
[Julia exclaiming]

620
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,000
darling, Julia.

621
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,634
you were quite wonderful tonight.

622
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:19,532
I'll say. absolutely first-rate.

623
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:20,633
thank you.

624
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:23,233
yes, I believe I was
firing on all cylinders.

625
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:25,834
and I'm starving, absolutely ravenous.

626
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,600
Evie, what have we
got for supper tonight?

627
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:29,567
tripe and onions.

628
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,900
oh, how divine. I
adore tripe and onions.

629
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,566
Michael, Michael, if you love me,

630
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,667
if you've got any spark of tenderness

631
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:39,666
in that hard heart of yours,

632
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:41,767
let me have a bottle of beer.

633
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:42,666
beer? yes.

634
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:44,433
Julia. just this once.

635
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:46,400
oh, Evie, that's for you.

636
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:47,532
uh, please?

637
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:49,667
Julia, I think it's a damn shame.

638
00:29:50,034 --> 00:29:50,699
(Julia) what is?

639
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,200
well, that you're taking the play off.

640
00:29:53,534 --> 00:29:54,266
the good news is,

641
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:55,466
I've found an Italian company

642
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,333
who wants the theatre for 3 months,

643
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,666
so I said they could have it. hmm. mmm.

644
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,933
I'm sure your mother's
as excited as I am

645
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,566
at the thought of being with you.

646
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,699
we'll have such fun at my place, Julia.

647
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,834
you could do anything you like.

648
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:09,032
rest. anything.

649
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:10,966
I've changed my mind. I don't know why,

650
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:13,667
but I'm beginning to  enjoy
myself again. oh, but--

651
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:15,299
let's run through the summer

652
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
and then find something
new for the autumn.

653
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,767
but I've... I-I've...
I've told the Italians.

654
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:21,499
then un-tell them.

655
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,733
and I was so looking forward to France.

656
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:26,267
stars will be stars.

657
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:32,333
I forgot.

658
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:33,466
what?

659
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,167
hmm...

660
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,267
[exclaims]

661
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:49,900
oh, my god. a cartier.

662
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
well spotted. when's your birthday?

663
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:54,399
November 20.

664
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,433
hmm.

665
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:56,234
happy birthday.

666
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:57,966
uh, but it's not November 20.

667
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,067
don't be so pedantic. open it.

668
00:31:03,067 --> 00:31:05,300
oh, that's the one thing
I've wanted my whole life.

669
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:07,299
thank you.

670
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,067
[giggles]

671
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,333
uh, geez, it's lousy

672
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,667
I can't give you anything in return.

673
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,167
give me that watch you
pawned to buy me supper.

674
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,834
have you redeemed it yet? ah! thanks.

675
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,800
it'll amuse me to wear it.

676
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:25,900
I love you, Julia.

677
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:31,767
[sighing]

678
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,000
this is total insanity.
I'm old enough to be...

679
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,100
[laughing]

680
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,733
god, I'm a fool,

681
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,600
I'm such a bloody fool.

682
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,967
good morning, Evie. where's my wife?

683
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:52,566
in your study.

684
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,667
my study? mmm-hmm.

685
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,833
what's she doing there?

686
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:58,567
exercising.

687
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,300
exercising?

688
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:04,600
[grunting]

689
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,400
what are you doing?

690
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,834
swimming the channel, what
do you think I'm doing?

691
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:11,432
yeah, but why?

692
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:12,233
[panting]

693
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:14,300
miss Phillips said my
tummy needed tightening,

694
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,400
so I'm tightening it.

695
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,467
[grunting]

696
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:22,932
oh.

697
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:23,733
[grunting]

698
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,667
oh, yes, I had a thought.

699
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,499
we should take a country house

700
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,766
for the summer.

701
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:30,667
what do you think?

702
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:32,733
[Julia grunting]

703
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,166
I'll talk to you later.

704
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:37,967
[continues grunting]

705
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:40,834
(Michael) so do you think a house
for the summer's a good idea?

706
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,866
yes.

707
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:43,667
golf, swimming, tennis.

708
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:45,566
it'll be especially good
for Roger. he loves golf.

709
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,467
then he'll have to decide
what's he gonna do with his life.

710
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,632
I think he should go to university.

711
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,967
he doesn't want to,
and we shouldn't insist.

712
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,267
it's his life.

713
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,232
oh, yes, I had another idea.

714
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,900
you remember that young
chap I introduced you to?

715
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:01,467
which young chap?

716
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,866
that American. good-looking fellow.

717
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:04,667
remember?

718
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:06,199
[clearing throat] no.

719
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,166
he wants to learn the business.

720
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:09,599
tom fennel's his name.

721
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,667
American, you must remember.

722
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,199
vaguely.

723
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,333
well, he's frightfully good at his job.

724
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:16,666
he's a wizard with money.

725
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:18,933
lots of American ideas for avoiding tax.

726
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,199
what about him?

727
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,833
well, I thought we might invite him down

728
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:26,600
for a couple of weeks to
spend his holiday with us.

729
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:29,333
why would we want to do that?

730
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:31,634
he'll be company for Roger.

731
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:33,132
he's only a bit older.

732
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,600
Roger will like him, I'm sure of it.

733
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,067
shall I ask him?

734
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,700
hmm.

735
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,600
ah!

736
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,300
(Julia) remind me to keep exercising.

737
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,034
so, will you come and stay?

738
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:51,467
Michael says the house is
frightfully comfortable.

739
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,999
probably not.

740
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,134
I'm going abroad for a couple of months.

741
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,400
(Julia) what fun.

742
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,199
well, you'll be busy, won't you?

743
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,333
looking for a new play, reading scripts.

744
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:03,400
so, what do you think?

745
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:06,034
he hasn't done justice to your eyes.

746
00:34:07,534 --> 00:34:08,366
as a matter of fact,

747
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,232
there is a play that interests me.

748
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:11,132
it's about an older woman

749
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,367
who has an affair with a younger man.

750
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,199
oh, a farce.

751
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,599
why do you say that?

752
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,000
well, because everyone
laughs at the older woman.

753
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:21,700
no, not in this play. it's all serious.

754
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,534
the act 1 curtain's good.

755
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:27,999
it comes as a shock to her.

756
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,800
what does?

757
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,967
that she's fallen in love with the boy.

758
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,799
and it happens just when everything

759
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,034
seemed to her so dull and unpromising,

760
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:38,134
as if her life was over.

761
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,367
she finds the affair exhilarating.

762
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,766
and everyone keeps telling her

763
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,700
she looks 10 years younger.

764
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:46,466
I trust she doesn't confess to the boy

765
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,000
that she loves him. that's always fatal.

766
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,466
does it sound like something for me?

767
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,833
oh, don't be ridiculous, Julia.

768
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,333
no, your public would
never stand for it.

769
00:34:57,634 --> 00:34:58,433
if such a woman asked me,

770
00:34:58,634 --> 00:34:59,899
I know what advice I'd give her.

771
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,366
what? break it off at once.

772
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,699
it will only end in tears.

773
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,533
but, Charles, she can't do that.

774
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:05,334
why ever not?

775
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,266
because she's fallen in love with him,

776
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,200
that's why. she's helpless.

777
00:35:09,467 --> 00:35:10,867
hmm.

778
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,400
the character in the play.

779
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:26,000
[door opens]

780
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,900
dolly, old thing,

781
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:29,933
how are you?

782
00:35:30,134 --> 00:35:32,134
I haven't seen you for ages.

783
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,034
sit down and make yourself, uh,

784
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,699
comfy.

785
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,300
so, come to see that
the old firm's raking in

786
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:43,967
the dividends for you?

787
00:35:44,134 --> 00:35:46,166
Michael, I'll come
straight to the point.

788
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:47,732
you know I'm not one to gossip,

789
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:50,066
but--but I'm
upset about Julia.

790
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:50,867
[sighing]

791
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,599
I think you ought to know that
people are beginning to talk.

792
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,566
what the devil do you mean?

793
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:56,734
well, it's absurd that at her age,

794
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:58,999
she should make herself so conspicuous

795
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,833
with a young boy.

796
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,800
oh, you mean tom fennel?
don't be such a fool, dolly.

797
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:05,599
I'm not a fool.

798
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,699
when someone is as well-known as Julia

799
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,300
and they're always seen with the
same man, naturally people talk.

800
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,899
tom fennel is a very
good type of American.

801
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,466
he's clean, honest and by
way of being a gentleman.

802
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,833
he's boring, dull, common and a snob.

803
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,300
he's just using Julia.
he's a little gold digger.

804
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:25,566
can you look me in the eyes, dolly,

805
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:26,632
and tell me you really think

806
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,800
Julia's having an affair with him?

807
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:31,699
no.

808
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,500
ah.

809
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:34,500
the truth is, Michael,
I've hardly seen her.

810
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:37,167
she never telephones anymore, and...

811
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,167
and...

812
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,900
I understand, dolly, believe me.

813
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:48,599
[sniffling]

814
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,700
she's very fond of you, you know that,

815
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,367
but she's bound to have other friends.

816
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,033
I don't think chaps

817
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:01,132
should talk about their wives to others.

818
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,266
I think it's frightfully bad form

819
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:04,667
but let me explain
something to you about Julia.

820
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,500
sex doesn't mean a thing to her.

821
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:09,132
it was different in the beginning.

822
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,500
then she could be somewhat
tiresome sometimes.

823
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,499
but after she had Roger, she changed.

824
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,966
having a baby seemed to settle her.

825
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,534
all those instincts went
into her acting, you see.

826
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:20,199
gossip isn't good for business, Michael.

827
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,167
I mean, if Julia had one flagrant
affair after another, nobody would notice

828
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,900
but--but this boy,
he's half her age.

829
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:29,666
the public has always looked up to you

830
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:32,000
as such a devoted and loyal couple.

831
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
and so we are, damn it. in our way.

832
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:37,333
devoted, united, but not...

833
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:42,034
how shall I put it? not possessive.

834
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:46,167
we're a very modern couple.

835
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,900
[lighter clicking]

836
00:37:57,467 --> 00:37:59,066
(Michael) hello, Roger, my boy.

837
00:37:59,267 --> 00:37:59,899
hello, daddy.

838
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,532
glad to be finished at Eton?

839
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:02,333
no mummy?

840
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,634
no, it's Saturday. she's got 2 shows.

841
00:38:05,134 --> 00:38:05,734
3 and 4 pence, sir.

842
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,867
she'll be down first
thing in the morning.

843
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:09,299
thank you so much.

844
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,100
thank you, sir.

845
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:11,632
here, let me give you a hand.

846
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,800
she's bringing a young
chap down with her,

847
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:15,499
your age more or less.

848
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,900
a yank. I think you'll like him.

849
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:18,967
[birds chirping]

850
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,433
[I get a kick out of you
by Frank Sinatra playing]

851
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,534
I get no kick from champagne

852
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,833
mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all

853
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,700
so tell me why should it be true

854
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,466
that I get a kick out of you

855
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,534
[sighing] what's the matter?

856
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:40,666
nothing.

857
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,400
tell me.

858
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,866
it's... I--I--I
just don't...

859
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:46,899
I'm worried sick, that's all.

860
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,366
what about?

861
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:50,300
tell me, tom. what?

862
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,933
it's money, I owe money.

863
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:54,199
oh.

864
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,399
is that all?

865
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,966
I thought it was something serious.

866
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,199
well, it's ok for you, Julia,

867
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,833
but I just can't afford
all the things we do.

868
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,532
nightclubs, restaurants.

869

how can you let a trifle
like that upset you?

871
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:07,699
don't worry about it.
I'll give you the money.

872
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,000
no, I--I couldn't take
any money from you.

873
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:11,967
what nonsense.

874
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:14,266
why grudge me the happiness

we might play mahjong.

mahjong, tom? no, I--

it'll do you good.

Julia, Julia, Julia,
we're in mixed company.

906
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:35,966
[laughing]

907
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,999
(woman) oh, let's do the 3rd word.

908
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,933
(Archie) 3rd word. 3rd word.

909
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:42,132
winking! winking!

910
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,032
oh, oh, oh.

911
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,799
wee willie winkie! yes.

912
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,032
[people cheering]

913
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:48,333
yes. yes, you idiots. wee willie winkie.

914
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,634
Shirley Temple, god, you're stupid.

915
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,599
I don't get "willie."

916
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,433
I don't get "willie."

917
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,699
oh, well, they did.

918
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,232
It-it's an English thing.

919
00:40:58,433 --> 00:40:59,833
ah.

920
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:01,833
ok.

921
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:04,000
[all chattering]

922
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:05,933
(Avice) hello, you.

923
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:07,132
(tom) hey.

924
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,034
[Avice squealing]

925
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:11,433
(Roger) more water.

926
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:13,432
(Avice) no, stop it!

927
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:15,033
[boys laughing]

928
00:41:15,234 --> 00:41:16,733
(Roger) I told you.

929
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:19,034
oh, no. I just dried
off, tom, I hate you.

930
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,266
[tom laughing]

931
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:22,166
I'm going to get you back.

932
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,600
(Roger) you're an uncivilized oaf.

933
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:27,833
and you're running away.

934
00:41:28,034 --> 00:41:30,367
(girl) come on, Michael,
you promised me a dance.

935
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,000
so I did, sorry.

936
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,233
I might be out of practice.

937
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:37,366
(grace) answer my question, Julia.

938
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:38,866
(Julia) what question?

939
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:39,932
would you?

940
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:40,733
would I what?

941
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,934
tour in the second Mrs. Tanqueray

942
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,200
for 17 pounds a week.

943
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,133
and it's a 6-month tour, darling.

944
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:49,733
6 months.

945
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:52,100
no, I can't be away
from home for 6 months.

946
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:54,767
what would Archie do without me?

947
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,967
oh, he'll think of something.

948
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:01,267
mmm.

949
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:03,700
they're so bloody
mean, these managements.

950
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,333
I said, "give me 18
pounds and I'll do it."

951
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:08,833
and he said, "18 pounds? 18
pounds!" cheeky little sod.

952
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,366
what are you doing tonight?

953
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:12,366
I don't know.

954
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,333
do you know that girl's name?

955
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:16,034
which girl?

956
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,000
oh, that's Avice Crichton.

957
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,200
"you couldn't have her for 80 pounds,

958
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,967
never mind 18 pounds."

959
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:25,533
I thought that was witty.

960
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:27,499
don't you think that was witty?

961
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,300
hilarious.

962
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:30,467
well, they're not
number-one dates, darling.

963
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:32,033
oh, not at all.

964
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:34,267
Lowestoft, bournemouth and chesterfield

965
00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:36,800
and Christ knows where else.

966
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:38,233
6 months...

967
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:40,934
mummy, we're going to London to have
supper and do the clubs, all right?

968
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,899
no. no, really not,

969
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,932
you've all had too much to drink.

970
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:46,366
tom hasn't. he's driving,

971
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,467
and one of the girls has a car.

972
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,467
[laughing]

973
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,333
[brakes squealing]

974
00:42:52,534 --> 00:42:54,200
[crickets chirping]

975
00:42:57,067 --> 00:42:59,434
(tom) yeah. yeah, we had a great time

976
00:43:00,934 --> 00:43:02,533
[Roger groaning]

977
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:04,367
[Roger chuckling]

978
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,867
[car doors closing]

979
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:10,999
(Roger) good night, old man.

980
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,867
good night, pal.

981
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:15,899
[door squeaking]

982
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,600
[door closing]

983
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:29,467
are you-- are you crazy, what
do you think you're you doing?

984
00:43:29,967 --> 00:43:31,866
I was about to ask you the same thing.

985
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:32,667
go back to your room.

986
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,866
I've hardly seen you
since you've been here.

987
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:36,799
you've seen Roger more than me.

988
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,600
we haven't been alone.

989
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,800
what's wrong with you?
you haven't held me,

990
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,466
you haven't kissed me.

991
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:42,267
shh.

992
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:44,066
[sobbing] can't you
see the state I'm in?

993
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:46,434
and--and tonight--tonight,
going off like that,

994
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,267
not a word to me, with that little tart.

995
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:51,867
oh, Avice Crichton is not a tart.

996
00:43:52,234 --> 00:43:54,300
Avice Crichton certainly looks like one.

997
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:56,932
I'm going back to London tomorrow.

998
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:59,266
good. I hope you remember
to tip the servants

999
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:01,767
or do you want me to
give you the money, hmm?

1000
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,833
these are yours, take them back.

1001
00:44:05,034 --> 00:44:06,333
don't be such a bloody little fool.

1002
00:44:06,534 --> 00:44:07,966
you think I like being a kept boy?

1003
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,367
you think I like being
humiliated like this, huh?

1004
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:12,867
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I didn't mean it.

1005
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:14,399
that makes it even worse.

1006
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,699
I should never have let
you give me these presents.

1007
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,967
I should never have let
you lend me that money.

1008
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:21,133
by the end of the
month I'll pay you back.

1009
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:22,399
I've apologized.

1010
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
don't go to London tomorrow, please.

1011
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:28,299
[sniffling]

1012
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,100
I love you, tom.

1013
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,400
please.

1014
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:35,800
I'm tired. I want to go to bed now.

1015
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,766
[sobbing]

1016
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:51,033
(Jimmie) now, that's
the real thing, Julia,

1017
00:44:51,234 --> 00:44:53,132
or my name's not Jimmie Langton.

1018
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:54,932
but I've got some notes.

1019
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:57,067
you're still going over the top.

1020
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,067
you've got to learn restraint.

1021
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,632
and for Christ's sake,
stop crying, will you?

1022
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,734
we all know you can turn your
tears on and off like a tap,

1023
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:07,166
so turn them off, will you?

1024
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:08,299
[sobbing]

1025
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,100
well, bugger me,

1026
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,434
you really are crying
this time, aren't you?

1027
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:14,099
I can't say I wasn't moved,

1028
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,100
but you've got to learn to do it

1029
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,033
so that it seems real.

1030
00:45:18,234 --> 00:45:20,500
seems to be real,
that's the art of acting.

1031
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,333
hold the mirror up to nature, ducky,

1032
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:25,467
otherwise you'll become a nervous wreck,

1033
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:26,367
take to drink

1034
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:28,700
and end up a piss artist
playing gin-sodden whores

1035
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:31,133
all over Scotland on number-3 tours.

1036
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,833
technique, that's what
I want you to learn.

1037
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:35,900
technique.

1038
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,833
[knocking on door]

1039
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:42,734
I saw the light on. can I come in?

1040
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:44,900
yes, of course. is something wrong?

1041
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,133
no. you've been crying.

1042
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:51,100
no, no, just a bad dream.

1043
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,434
what is it, sweetheart?

1044
00:45:56,234 --> 00:45:58,267
we picked up a couple of girls tonight.

1045
00:45:59,734 --> 00:46:01,132
who did?

1046
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,934
tom and me.

1047
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,733
oh.

1048
00:46:05,934 --> 00:46:08,000
tom made me promise I wouldn't tell you.

1049
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:10,333
he said you'd be furious.

1050
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:12,399
were they tarts?

1051
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,300
no, they're on the stage.

1052
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,799
Joan asked me if I could get her

1053
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,934
an understudy in your next play.

1054
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,833
yes, tarts.

1055
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,167
I just had to tell you.

1056
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:31,066
tell me what?

1057
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:32,966
I thought it was about time

1058
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:35,267
I found out what it was all about.

1059
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,100
Roger, what do you mean?

1060
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:41,799
love.

1061
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,300
love?

1062
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:50,067
it's not that great, really.

1063
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,633
I don't know why everybody
makes such a fuss about it.

1064
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:01,434
mummy, what's the matter?

1065
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:04,467
you are upset.

1066
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,934
why are you crying?

1067
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
oh, because you're such a little boy.

1068
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:15,499
don't cry.

1069
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,666
hmm.

1070
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,500
I needed to tell you.

1071
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:21,132
it had to happen sooner or later.

1072
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:23,400
it makes me feel so old.

1073
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,033
"age cannot wither her,

1074
00:47:36,234 --> 00:47:38,400
nor custom stale her infinite variety"

1075
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,499
if I'd been Cleopatra,

1076
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,767
I'd have put whoever said that to death.

1077
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,234
[laughing]

1078
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:48,800
to tell you the truth,
I didn't enjoy it much.

1079
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,000
oh, you're so very, very young.

1080
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:56,132
I'll grow out of it.

1081
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,600
hmm.

1082
00:47:58,034 --> 00:47:59,467
[laughing]

1083
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:06,667
I may go abroad for a while.

1084
00:48:06,934 --> 00:48:07,534
oh, where?

1085
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:09,667
I don't know. Italy, France. abroad.

1086
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:19,132
I say,

1087
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,100
about--about
that under study,

1088
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,667
is there any chance for Joan?

1089
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,467
tell her to write to me.

1090
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,400
thanks. good night.

1091
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,934
good night, darling.

1092
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:49,333
an understudy, my foot.

1093
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,467
[exhales]

1094
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:18,967
[footsteps approaching]

1095
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,267
wait. hold it.

1096
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:28,634
[door creaking]

1097
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:33,967
it's from you know who.

1098
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,434
I don't want to be disturbed.

1099
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,499
good matinee?

1100
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,533
all right,

1101
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:09,366
but I'm not feeling very well.

1102
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:11,667
draw up a chair. sit down.

1103
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:20,400
what's the matter?

1104
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,801
nothing. I haven't been sleeping.

1105
00:50:26,934 --> 00:50:28,834
I had a post card from Roger.

1106
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,100
he's in Naples.

1107
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:31,733
says he's having a great time.

1108
00:50:31,934 --> 00:50:34,200
yes, but you haven't come
here just to tell me that,

1109
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,966
have you?

1110
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,101
no, it's something else. I, uh...

1111
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:42,267
I can't pay you back
the money that I owe you.

1112
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:45,366
I know I said at the end of last month.

1113
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:47,233
but I just don't have it.

1114
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:49,034
I could pay it off.

1115
00:50:49,234 --> 00:50:51,334
I hate having to ask
for more time. but...

1116
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:53,634
don't be such a bloody
little idiot, tom.

1117
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:56,066
it's so humiliating, Julia.

1118
00:50:56,267 --> 00:50:58,233
geez, when you said
you'd pay my tips for me,

1119
00:50:58,434 --> 00:51:00,266
how do you think that made me feel?

1120
00:51:00,467 --> 00:51:02,334
I said I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

1121
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,833
I was jealous of you

1122
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:06,000
spending so much time with Roger.

1123
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,499
I was jealous.

1124
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,467
I was jealous of you going out

1125
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,599
and having a good time without me.

1126
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,966
is that so horrible?

1127
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:19,367
I should never have
accepted anything from you.

1128
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
you're everything in the world to me.

1129
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:24,934
you know that.

1130
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:27,167
I love being with you.
I don't want to lose you.

1131
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:30,867
I have few friends. real friends.

1132
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,633
and you're the only person in my life

1133
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:35,967
with whom I can be entirely myself.

1134
00:51:37,134 --> 00:51:38,433
[gasping]

1135
00:51:38,634 --> 00:51:40,167
let's... let's go...

1136
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:44,367
[exhales]

1137
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:52,000
let's go on seeing each other. please.

1138
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:56,967
oh, Julia.

1139
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:34,301
[giggling]

1140
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:37,533
(Evie) well, I've always said,

1141
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:40,034
you're lucky you can cry
without your eyelids swelling.

1142
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:42,700
go to hell.

1143
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:45,134
well, you're looking a lot happier,

1144
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:47,233
I'll say that for you.

1145
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:48,466
I hope with good reason.

1146
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:51,000
if you're thinking what
I think you're thinking,

1147
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:52,899
then stop thinking.

1148
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,200
all the same, Evie,
you know what I think?

1149
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,334
no, what do you think?

1150
00:52:57,801 --> 00:52:59,033
what mugs men are.

1151
00:52:59,234 --> 00:53:01,334
well, they can't keep
it in their trousers,

1152
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:03,533
[Julia laughs] that's for sure.

1153
00:53:03,734 --> 00:53:05,334
you're a revolting hag.

1154
00:53:05,634 --> 00:53:07,100
[Julia giggling]

1155
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,466
yes, I am happier.

1156
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:10,600
everything will be all right now.

1157
00:53:11,334 --> 00:53:13,134
[sighs] I can't help feeling...

1158
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,899
I wish I didn't.

1159
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,934
deep down, I can't help feeling...

1160
00:53:17,534 --> 00:53:18,399
what?

1161
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,534
a certain contempt for that boy.

1162
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:23,266
he's so transparent.

1163
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:25,767
life is just a bowl of cherries

1164
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:28,867
don't make it serious
life's too mysterious

1165
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,767
you work, you save, you worry so

1166
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,201
but you can't take your dough
