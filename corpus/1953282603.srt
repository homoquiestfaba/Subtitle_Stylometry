it'll serve you right
for reporting daisy

you don't "practically"

last week.

do you really think
we ought to use it ?

suppose we take it out
and forget to put it back
and then the big one comes ?

372
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,960
there's a law that all

i'm the seaside strangler ?

does she fit the descriptions
of the victims ?

then why is she
