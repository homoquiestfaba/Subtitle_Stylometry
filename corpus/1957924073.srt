1
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:26,728
Time has come, my friends

2
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,905
For a long time we have
struggled, haven't we?

3
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:35,040
Starving for what is to come.

4
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:42,657
For tonight we quench our
thirst for the manifestation

5
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:44,485
of our beliefs.

6
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:49,098
A perfect subject approaches.

7
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:55,539
A perfect subject approaches.

8
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,891
A perfect vessel.

9
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:06,246
Throw him in.

10
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:07,962
Steve didn't dig a hole
to hell for nothing,

11
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,031
put him in there.

12
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:17,735
Lorna.

13
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,086
I really miss you.

14
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:26,831
I'll try and get ya a
fresh one every day.

15
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:39,453
Who the hell is on my property?

16
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:43,370
Hello!?

17
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:10,144
We have brought you forth in
good faith and great effort.

18
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:19,327
You must feed and transform
further and become stronger.

19
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,992
My loyal subjects are
but your servants

20
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:27,909
and are here to help you
with that task.

21
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,042
Be free, but not just yet.

22
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,830
Be free and let chaos reign.

23
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,222
All right, cool.

24
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:45,013
Now, see that the beast is fed.

25
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:49,757
No.

26
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,541
Now, now, now, now.

27
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,938
Holy shit.

28
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:02,160
Lorna, we got a big problem.

29
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,453
Morning, Timmy.

30
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,686
Damn it, Timmy, what?

31
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:52,602
Damn kid.

32
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,432
Poncho!

33
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Hey, Poncho!

34
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:01,392
Come here, boy.

35
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:05,615
Where the hell did
you run off to?

36
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,835
Poncho, come here, boy.

37
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:08,965
Hey!

38
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,867
Hey, Sheriff!

39
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:25,912
Rick.

40
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,924
Getting all settled in, are ya?

41
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,709
As much as one can, I guess.

42
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,233
Not much to get settled
into now, is there?

43
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,800
Yeah, I know.

44
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:47,412
She ain't much to look at,
but we have a close knit

45
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:49,980
community here, it's been
that way for 50 years.

46
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:52,504
That's what they told me.

47
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,204
I get it.

48
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:59,642
You big town folk aren't too
keen on small town living.

49
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:03,211
We don't got your supermarkets
or your Radioshacks.

50
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,389
I like the quiet,
actually, Rick.

51
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,087
Oh, well that's good 'cause
we got plenty of that.

52
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:12,046
Chiggers and snakes, too.

53
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,833
Rick.

54
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,142
I'll leave ya to it.

55
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:25,581
See ya.

56
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:29,106
Ooh, that's nice.

57
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,237
- Look good?
- Yeah.

58
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:31,369
- Come on, coffee.
- Where?

59
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,738
- Right here.
- All right, get ready.

60
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:33,371
Yeah.

61
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:34,502
All right.

62
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:35,678
- See if it works?
- Mm hmm.

63
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,184
- Oh!
- That's a real good one,

64
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:40,046
- that was real close.
- I know, pretty close.

65
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,166
Morning, everyone.

66
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,472
- Morning.
- Morning, Sheriff.

67
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,910
Anything new to report?

68
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,129
Yeah, um.

69
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,655
Oh, somebody stole
Frosty from the Teegan's

70
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:56,960
front yard yesterday.

71
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,092
Really?

72
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:00,007
I swear, who steals a
plastic snowman?

73
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,142
That's it?

74
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,671
Uh, there might be a rabid
coon up in Fox Tail Canyon.

75
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:12,584
Again?

76
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:13,715
Yeah.

77
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:15,805
Raccoons, what do you...

78
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,130
I don't know how to deal
with raccoons.

79
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:18,828
How do you guys normally
deal with raccoons?

80
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,201
We have to shoot 'em.

81
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:22,159
Especially if it's rabid, yeah.

82
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,466
I guess that makes sense.

83
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,687
Not many raccoons in New York,
boss?

84
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:30,602
Lots, just never had to
deal with any rabid ones.

85
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,093
Is that a normal
thing around here?

86
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,126
What?

87
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,432
Rabid animals.

88
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:35,433
Sometimes.

89
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:36,652
Yeah, especially the cows.

90
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:37,871
Ooh.

91
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,786
Cows.

92
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,266
Oh yeah, a lot of
vampires swooping around.

93
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:47,358
Vampires.

94
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,099
What the hell are we
talking about here?

95
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,100
Bats.

96
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,232
Bats?

97
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:52,537
Yeah, rodents who fly.

98
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:54,583
Yeah, they carry rabies, boss.

99
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,074
Bite the cow's legs and transfer
it over to the damn things.

100
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,718
- It gets real bad.
- It gets weird.

101
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,197
Like that movie.

102
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:03,983
What movie?

103
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:06,769
The movie.

104
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,250
The one with the mother and
the son, they're in the car,

105
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,426
the rabid dog just...

106
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:16,799
The mother, the son,
they're in the car

107
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,302
with the dog with
rabies and trapped.

108
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Really?

109
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:23,959
No one here?

110
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,180
No, I can't say

111
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,878
I've ever seen a movie
like that, Sheriff.

112
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,009
Yeah. Have you?

113
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:31,707
- Uh, no.
- No.

114
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:34,318
Are you a big fan of movies,
boss?

115
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,929
Yeah, I guess you
could say that.

116
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:44,372
All right, well, I'm gonna
go make the rounds, so...

117
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,244
You hold down the fort?

118
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,375
See you later.

119
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,384
He's got a crush.

120
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:32,609
Oh.

121
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:36,919
Hi, Teddy.

122
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,050
Morning.

123
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:43,099
Um, can I get you a
cup of coffee?

124
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:45,971
That'd be wonderful.

125
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:51,020
So, how's the new sheriff?

126
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:54,632
Oh, he's quiet.

127
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,199
That makes sense.

128
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,157
Does it?

129
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,332
Sure.

130
00:14:58,462 --> 00:14:59,942
He doesn't really know
any of us here.

131
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,814
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

132
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,425
Sure is.

133
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:06,079
He moved all the way
out here from

134
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,298
a place half a world away.

135
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:12,650
Big city, all the lights,
all the people.

136
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,827
I wonder what that must be like.

137
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:18,265
What's that?

138
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,223
That I wonder how
that must feel.

139
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:21,442
Probably pretty lonely.

140
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,358
Oh.

141
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,881
I guess I hadn't
thought about it.

142
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:28,710
Don't give him too much grief.

143
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:30,972
Who, me?

144
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:32,888
I wouldn't dream of it.

145
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,023
Hey, Deanna.

146
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,024
Mornin', Harry.

147
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,503
Ah, Teddy.

148
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,811
How you doing?

149
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,206
How's our little fledgling
town doing this morning?

150
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:49,209
Oh, well, the day's
just started, sir, so...

151
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,951
Yeah, I suppose it is,
I suppose that is true,

152
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,517
I suppose so.

153
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:54,648
Uh, Teddy.

154
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:58,000
Let me ask you something.

155
00:15:58,131 --> 00:15:59,828
He's a nice fella, Harry.

156
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,962
He hasn't really begun making
his rounds around here yet,

157
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:07,531
so a whole lotta people
think that he's a bit cold.

158
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,969
Lonely maybe.

159
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:19,935
Yeah, I guess it takes time
adjusting to a quiet place.

160
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:22,372
Uh, Teddy, um...

161
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,811
How's your mama doing?

162
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,770
Is she liking it down in Dallas?

163
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,730
She is.

164
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,036
She does, likes it just fine.

165
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,535
It's a change of
scenery for her,

166
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,736
so it oughta do her some good.

167
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,435
There are some things about
home she misses, though.

168
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:54,535
Yeah, make sure to
give her my best.

169
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,931
All right, well, I
better be off.

170
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,284
Thank you for the coffee,
Deanna.

171
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:05,937
Harry.

172
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,069
Teddy.

173
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:18,037
What you waiting for, huh?

174
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,212
That's a good kid.

175
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:20,387
What's wrong with you?

176
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:25,914
Let me have a glass of eggnog.

177
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,959
Fine.

178
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,570
This kid doesn't
know what he started.

179
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:30,832
Only one, though.

180
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,747
Only one.

181
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,037
There's nothing in it, right?

182
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,060
Ooh, look at you lookin' busy.

183
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,889
You doing all right?

184
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,891
Yeah, I'll live.

185
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,154
Streets are clean.

186
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,284
All right.

187
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,477
Mornin', Bill.

188
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,523
Anything I can do for you
and the 12 gauge

189
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,046
you just slammed on my desk?

190
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:13,222
I wanna make a complaint.

191
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,398
Okay, about what exactly?

192
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,922
On my property last
night something happened.

193
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:20,360
I had a group of visitors.

194
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,490
Trespassers?

195
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:22,535
Visitors.

196
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,366
What... I don't understand.

197
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:27,736
Visitors, what do you call 'em?

198
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:28,977
Trespassers.

199
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,067
Oh, okay, well that
must be a big city word.

200
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:33,198
I don't get it.

201
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,852
Actually, it's just English,
Bill.

202
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,134
Do you know who these
individuals are?

203
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,158
No, sir.

204
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,379
Did they take anything?

205
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,076
Did they destroy anything?

206
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:43,818
Well, they were
dressed in sheets.

207
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:51,260
All kind of like, I don't
know, Purdue University

208
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:54,481
sheet-looking things, you
know, with that color.

209
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,744
They had that horrible
Purdue color, you know?

210
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:58,528
The team never makes
the final four,

211
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:01,227
but when they do, they wear
that awful, I don't know,

212
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,142
yellowish kinda thing
that they have.

213
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:04,926
Sheets that color.

214
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,668
Faces covered, scarves
over their nose,

215
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:09,496
and act like like they
were in Afghanistan

216
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:10,671
or some fucking place.

217
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,935
They started dancing around.

218
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:16,285
Moving, swaying, doing
all that stuff,

219
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,982
and started with all
that hippie stuff

220
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:20,289
only it wasn't Na Merengue.

221
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,685
You know, the bald guys,
and with the orange on.

222
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:28,036
And they all start holding
hands and made a ring.

223
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
There was about a dozen of 'em.

224
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,302
They were dancing around,
then they joined hands,

225
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,435
then they danced
around in a circle

226
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,220
like old hippie girls or like,
you know,

227
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,396
the Hare Krishna people.

228
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,355
And then they started chanting.

229
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:46,533
It was in rhyme and they
were altogether on it.

230
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:50,276
And then they started
chanting words

231
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:55,455
in a gibberish kind
of a language.

232
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:59,850
And then, all of a sudden,
they drag a guy out

233
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:03,637
of the bushes over there and
he's laying down right here

234
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:07,728
and next to him the
earth started to open up.

235
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:11,122
The earth started to open up.

236
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,734
And I'm way over there
watching and I look down

237
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:17,607
and I can't see down in the
hole but it goes way down.

238
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:19,566
And it's a door to hell.

239
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:21,045
And out of that hole.

240
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:22,786
Hey, bud, look at me.

241
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,180
Out of that hole comes a thing.

242
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,878
And as it gets higher and
higher out of the ground

243
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,403
and I see the whole thing
it's the most terrifying

244
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,796
horrible looking beast you've
ever seen in your life.

245
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,016
A being.

246
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:38,019
Some kind of, you know,
thing you couldn't imagine

247
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:39,412
could ever be put together.

248
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,327
Frightening, terrifying!

249
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,937
And then you know what
the beast says?

250
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:47,202
He goes into the body of
the guy on the ground.

251
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:52,076
And he's gone,
but the body is there.

252
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:56,429
And he's in the body,
so he now is in this body.

253
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,301
This horrifying thing.

254
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:01,825
Who is capable, I'm sure,
of anything.

255
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,353
Anything else?

256
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,484
I'm sorry?

257
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,399
Is there anything else?

258
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,837
Uh, yeah.

259
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,666
I was in 'Nam and I saw
a lotta shit.

260
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,015
You're from the big city.

261
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,321
Mmhmm.

262
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:21,323
You've seen a lotta shit.

263
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,151
But neither one of us
ever saw shit

264
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,067
as scary or frightening as this

265
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:27,808
and you gotta do
something about it.

266
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,856
All right, let me get
this straight.

267
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:39,701
You got a whole buncha
people on your property-

268
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,038
Yeah.

269
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:43,084
They're wearing Purdue uniforms?

270
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,086
Yeah.

271
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:46,870
They're dancing
around and singing.

272
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,219
- Right.
- And wearing

273
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,545
- funky pants.
- Chanting, chanting.

274
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:50,744
Chanting.

275
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:53,747
A hole opens in the ground.

276
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:55,662
- Yeah.
- Okay, so something-

277
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:57,490
And the hole was deep.

278
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,056
- Okay, so deep hole.
- Yeah.

279
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,295
Something comes
out of the hole...

280
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,494
- Yeah.
- Goes into the body.

281
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:02,973
- Yeah.
- Where does the body go?

282
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:07,064
Got up and ran off that
way into the woods.

283
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,390
- Of course it did.
- The other folks

284
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:09,589
all just took off.

285
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:12,896
Let me ask you a question.

286
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:17,003
You know if kids like
to come on your property

287
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:18,118
and they like to party,

288
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:19,401
- any of that stuff?
- Speak up, asshole.

289
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,295
What?

290
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:21,688
I'm trying to help you

291
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,753
- and you call me an asshole?
- Yeah, but I can't hear you.

292
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:24,797
Okay, am I allowed to be deaf?

293
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:26,451
Yeah, you're allowed to
do whatever you want.

294
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:28,651
Okay. What's
the question?

295
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:30,740
You got a lotta kids that
come on your property

296
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,873
- and they like to party?
- Never, never.

297
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:36,398
You've only been here a couple
weeks, you don't know me.

298
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,227
They know who I am and they
don't come on my property.

299
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,491
And after three minutes with
me now you also know who I am.

300
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:46,103
I'm a raging asshole,
but I got game.

301
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:47,844
- You got game?
- And I saw something

302
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:50,369
- bigger than game last night.
- Okay.

303
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:55,809
Are you a drinker?

304
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:58,333
Does Pinocchio have a
wooden dick?

305
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,291
Hey.

306
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,903
Y'all seen Poncho?
I can't find him anywhere.

307
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,313
- Again, Bernard?
- Jesus Christ.

308
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,037
Can't you put a leash on
your fucking dog one time?

309
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:08,848
He doesn't need a leash
in this town, Bill.

310
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,606
Of course he needs a leash,
he's a dog!

311
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:13,043
He's got a dog named Poncho.

312
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:15,785
The dog is never on a leash!

313
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,636
You know, there are
signs out there that say

314
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,572
every dog should be on a leash.

315
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:23,184
He's a dog, he's mangy,
he's a critter, he bites people,

316
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:25,491
and the dog is a bit
of an asshole.

317
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,580
- Plus he's a Mexican dog.
- What!

318
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,886
- Okay-
- Never call my dog

319
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,279
an asshole, old man.

320
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,475
- If you ever call my dog-
- I said he was a Mexican dog.

321
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:34,650
All right, come on,
come on, let's go.

322
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:35,781
- Let's go.
- Are you saying Mexicans

323
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:36,589
are assholes?

324
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,719
Okay, all right, Bill.

325
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,722
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Teddy.

326
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,961
I just told you you were
worried about some fucking guy

327
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,770
who can't keep his
dog on a leash?

328
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,075
I'm listening to you.

329
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:46,990
- I'll go check your property-
- Please.

330
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:49,036
Don't call me an
asshole anymore.

331
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,230
Uh, did I call you an asshole?

332
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:51,734
You did.

333
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:53,780
But I also tell you
before that I'm an asshole?

334
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,391
- Okay.
- In 'Nam communication

335
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:58,045
was the whole thing.

336
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:01,701
So look for the phone lines
to go down at some point

337
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:03,659
and then be talking on
short wave radios

338
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,140
and you'll hear the
chatter back and forth

339
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,924
and that's the first warning.

340
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,230
That's when you know.

341
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,364
Hello.

342
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,106
Yeah? Um, Bill, give me
a few minutes.

343
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,282
I'll go take a look at
your property, okay?

344
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:20,241
You don't need to
worry about it,

345
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,286
I already prepared for it.

346
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,071
What's that supposed to mean?

347
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,201
You'll see.

348
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,205
I get shit done.

349
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:31,078
This is bad shit, get it
taken care of.

350
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,210
Because if you don't
take care of it,

351
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,125
all hell's about to break loose.

352
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,171
I'll take care of it.

353
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:39,042
First thing on my list, Bill.

354
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:40,173
Thanks for coming in.

355
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:50,401
Bill, your gun.

356
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,057
He's very creepy.

357
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:55,929
Is that normal?

358
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,148
Um, he's been a
little off lately.

359
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,976
I mean, he's been
seeing weird things,

360
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:02,892
he once claimed to see
like an alien landing,

361
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:06,113
but that was just a couple
kids screwing around, so...

362
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:28,938
- Charlie.
- Good morning, Sheriff.

363
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:29,962
Morning, Sheriff.

364
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:31,114
Where are you two headed off to?

365
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:32,594
Uh, we're just gonna
go look at some eagles.

366
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:33,923
Oh, be careful.

367
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,054
Yes, sir.

368
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:38,580
Oh, Timmy.

369
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:41,148
Timmy, do me a favor.

370
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:43,106
Stop delivering papers
on your bicycle.

371
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,637
They're blowing all over town,
okay?

372
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:45,979
- Okay, Sheriff.
- All right.

373
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:59,819
Are you counting the days?
'Cause I am.

374
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:02,691
It's less than a week
until jolly old Saint Nick

375
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:06,390
comes to visit Hope Valley
for the 22nd annual

376
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:10,177
Christmas Giving Celebration
and photos with Santa.

377
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:14,137
So, bundle up the kids,
bring 'em on down,

378
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:15,399
and have a good one.

379
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:18,619
Thanks, sweetie.

380
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:23,843
And now here's the latest
hit from The Midnight.

381
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,628
Uh, morning, Sheriff.

382
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:28,847
Bobby.

383
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:32,634
Um, I'm gonna go open up
the store, Mom.

384
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:36,420
Okay.

385
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:37,951
Did you get anything
new down there?

386
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:42,557
"Elvira" and "Killer
Clowns from Outer Space".

387
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:46,256
I was hoping for
"All the President's Men".

388
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:47,475
Yeah, next time.

389
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,286
- I'll see you later, sweetie.
- All right.

390
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:51,783
Sheriff.

391
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,917
What can I do for you, Joe?

392
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:56,242
You have time for
some questions?

393
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:58,573
Yep, I got about three minutes.

394
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,623
Do you get many
listeners out here?

395
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:07,408
Lots of farm folk from
miles around.

396
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:08,864
They gotta have
something to listen to

397
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:13,022
while they fix their trailers
and milk their damn cows.

398
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:16,025
You get any chatter on the
other channels with this thing?

399
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:18,898
Uh, I don't switch
channels too often.

400
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:22,249
Too much religion and
not enough rock n' roll.

401
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,947
But on occasion I do,
especially if there's

402
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:27,080
a disaster in the area.

403
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,823
You might could say I
use it for news purposes.

404
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:31,954
Why do ya ask?

405
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,480
You listen to
anything last night?

406
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:37,830
Yeah.

407
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,136
Anything sound a bit unusual?

408
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,311
Not that I can think of.

409
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,359
Okay.

410
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:49,580
There was a wreck up by
the junction and a man

411
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:51,452
was reported missing
near Abel Station.

412
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:52,582
Missing persons?

413
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:53,627
Yeah.

414
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,154
That's not unusual.

415
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:01,201
A lotta guys up and leave
their wives for younger legs.

416
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,073
The way of the world, Sheriff.

417
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:06,379
The way of the world.

418
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,471
Okay, thanks, Georgia.

419
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:13,430
Hey, do me a favor.

420
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:14,669
Let me know if anything
strange comes

421
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,390
across these channels, okay?

422
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,628
Anything I should know about?

423
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:20,002
No, just wanna keep my ear close

424
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,483
to the ground, that's all.

425
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:25,878
I hate to tell ya, Joe,
but nothing too exciting

426
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,531
happens around here.

427
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:29,182
Yeah, that's what they
keep telling me.

428
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:32,275
Can I give you some advice?

429
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:33,406
Sure.

430
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:36,671
Not all places are bad.

431
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:40,370
Some places attract bad folks,
but don't go looking

432
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:41,981
for trouble if there's
none to find.

433
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,115
Thanks for the advice.

434
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:48,422
Have a good day.

435
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:04,046
<i>Teddy, you copy?</i>

436
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:08,529
Go for Teddy.

437
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,097
<i>Where the hell did
you disappear off to?</i>

438
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:13,752
I'm looking for Bernard's dog.

439
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,338
He said he might be out
here on MacDaniels Road

440
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,277
chasing jackrabbits.

441
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:18,408
<i>So, then where are you?</i>

442
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,717
MacDaniels Road, Liz.

443
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,371
<i>Copy that, see
you when you get back.</i>

444
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:27,722
Y'all ever get rid of Bill?

445
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,506
<i>Yeah, he finally
left, but not before</i>

446
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,682
<i>having some Vietnam flashbacks.</i>

447
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,510
Any more prophecies
from the end times

448
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:34,729
we should be worried about?

449
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,664
<i>He did say something
about them cutting</i>

450
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:38,777
<i>the phone lines.</i>

451
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:40,735
<i>I don't know, his
usual crazy stuff.</i>

452
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,999
Does Bill even have a phone?

453
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,827
<i>That road is bumpy
as hell, Teddy.</i>

454
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,655
<i>Don't go breaking another car.</i>

455
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,092
Good lord, I won't, Liz.

456
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:52,529
<i>All right, well
don't stay out too long.</i>

457
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,660
Teddy out.

458
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:08,387
Come on!

459
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:55,914
So much for spotting eagles.

460
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:57,872
There's a ton of 'em out here,
I promise.

461
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:03,529
What was that?

462
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,967
I don't know.

463
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,013
Probably one of those eagles.

464
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,143
Come on.

465
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:11,668
It's nothing.

466
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,040
Okay, no, someone's out
here with us, come on.

467
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:22,852
Like...

468
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:26,278
- All right, I'll take a look.
- Go check.

469
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:27,379
Go see what it is.

470
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:28,990
You mean who it is!

471
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:31,123
It's probably a hitchhiker
trying to mess with us.

472
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:32,253
Relax.

473
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:01,240
Please, open the door!

474
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,652
Open the door, unlock the
door, unlock the door!

475
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:03,546
Please, please, please,

476
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:05,002
- hurry up the door!
- Charlie, I can't!

477
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,854
Charlie!

478
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:38,624
Lorna!

479
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,019
Take a look at this.

480
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,067
Here they come.

481
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:48,852
Here's the first
asshole dressed like

482
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,593
he went to fucking Purdue.

483
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:55,381
Oh, look, he brought a
little partner with him

484
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:58,688
and he's got some kind of
peculiar shit in his hand.

485
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,603
This guy's got a knife,
that guy's got,

486
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:01,814
I don't know what he's got.

487
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:04,346
Oh, and there's a third guy.
Figures.

488
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,000
Three assholes.

489
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,871
You know, three amigos.

490
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,961
Well, I'll tell ya what, boys.

491
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:14,965
Or girls, whatever you might be.

492
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:17,707
Did you ever play
Teacher, May I? in school?

493
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:19,361
Well, it goes like this.

494
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:22,886
You can advance toward me
only if I give you permission,

495
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:27,500
so why don't you take five
giant steps toward me.

496
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:32,070
Come on down, son.

497
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,568
Surprise for you.

498
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,309
I did three tours in 'Nam.

499
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,616
You think you're gonna
sneak up on a crippled

500
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:58,705
old man in a fucking wheelchair?

501
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,318
Let's go, boys. Come on down.

502
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:06,147
Let's get on with it, don't
waste the whole fucking day.

503
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,996
Now, why don't you come on down

504
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,606
unless you're a chicken shit.

505
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:51,497
Oh, what a fucking shame.

506
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:53,412
Right in the grizzly bear trap.

507
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:56,502
Does that hurt?

508
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:58,721
Oh, yeah, that's a bear trap,
son.

509
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:00,549
You're not getting out of it.

510
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,682
Are you trying to cut me?

511
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,092
What are you slashing at me for?

512
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,380
You're never gonna touch me.

513
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,557
Look here, bud.

514
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:12,170
Happy Hanukkah!

515
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:25,738
How was the lunch, Joe, hm?

516
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:28,654
Still got the best burger
in town, Mary.

517
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:30,351
It ain't saying much now, is it?

518
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:36,270
- Mary!
- Oh.

519
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:38,446
I am so sorry I'm late.

520
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:40,883
Honey, does it look like
we're overflowing here?

521
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:42,972
No, it does not.

522
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:49,022
Cindy, have you met the
new sheriff here?

523
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:51,590
- Afraid I've not.
- Delightful.

524
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,071
Well, this here is Joe Anderson.

525
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:56,986
Pleasure to meet you, Sheriff.

526
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:58,292
Pleasure's all mine.

527
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,081
Joe here's from New York.

528
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:06,909
Oh, is that so?

529
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,303
Afraid it is.

530
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,392
And what brought you
all the way down here?

531
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,005
Change of scenery.

532
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:20,923
Not a big fan of
all that concrete, huh?

533
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:22,795
Not a big fan of all
those people, Mary.

534
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:25,711
Thanks for the lunch.

535
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:26,886
Don't mention it.

536
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:33,371
Sheriff, just got a call
into the office.

537
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:34,502
What about?

538
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,156
Loud noises coming from
Bill's place.

539
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:37,286
Loud noises?

540
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,245
Yeah, neighbors said it sounded

541
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,073
like explosions or something.

542
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:41,529
Well, God knows
what he has stashed

543
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,337
out there at his place.

544
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:44,468
Okay, where's Teddy?

545
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:45,794
He's out looking for
that missing dog.

546
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:46,645
He's on his way back now.

547
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:47,796
All right, we'll go take a look.

548
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,560
Teddy can man the office

549
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,690
till we get back.

550
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:54,609
Cindy.

551
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,045
Hope to see you around!

552
00:39:58,091 --> 00:39:59,397
Hope to see you around?

553
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:01,094
What is wrong with me, Mary?

554
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:02,443
Oh.

555
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,880
It's called butterflies.

556
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:06,012
I don't like butterflies.

557
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:07,317
Yes, you do.

558
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:13,933
- Sheriff, Sheriff, Sheriff.
- Not now!

559
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,652
He seems like an
interesting fella.

560
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:40,612
Hell, Bobby, all men
are interesting

561
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:41,961
if you look deep enough.

562
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:46,444
What can I do for ya?

563
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:49,534
About that timing belt.

564
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,664
Let's do it up.

565
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:53,581
Do it up?

566
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:56,715
Does that mean you want
me to order it for you?

567
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:59,544
Yeah, how long do you think
it'll take to get here?

568
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:02,285
Well, I have to order
it up from Ingram, so...

569
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:03,741
But it usually only
takes a couple of days.

570
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:04,765
Come on.

571
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:19,259
They usually have
those in stock.

572
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,001
Usually.

573
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:25,004
Don't play with that.

574
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:35,536
Hey, Terry. It's Rick here
in Hope Valley.

575
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,410
Yeah, yeah, me too.

576
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:43,936
Uh, that's a very
interesting story, Terry.

577
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:46,112
Listen, Terry!

578
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:48,506
How long will it take to
get a timing belt delivered?

579
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:52,118
A timing belt.

580
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:55,034
Hello?

581
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:58,603
Hello? Terry?

582
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,300
What's the matter?

583
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,736
That's odd.

584
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:03,172
What?

585
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:05,653
The phone went dead.

586
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:07,002
That's strange.

587
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,756
Are all the lines down?

588
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:25,019
I'm not sure.

589
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:29,677
Is your mom around?

590
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:30,808
Should be.

591
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,204
Mom, you here?

592
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:37,293
Mom!

593
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:38,424
Georgia?

594
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:47,869
This one's dead, too.

595
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,263
- Hey, boys.
- Jesus, Joseph, and Mary.

596
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:55,921
She got you, Bobby.

597
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:58,813
I've been scaring the
socks off that kid

598
00:42:58,837 --> 00:43:00,186
since he was two.

599
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:02,120
Hey, well, it's not funny
you gave me a heart attack.

600
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:03,711
What's going on?

601
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:05,017
The phones are dead.

602
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:06,192
Yeah.

603
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:07,889
All of 'em?

604
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,238
Every single one of 'em.

605
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:13,328
Georgia, what is it?

606
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:16,308
The sheriff was in
here this morning

607
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:18,508
and he was concerned
about something,

608
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:21,207
but I couldn't put my
finger on it.

609
00:43:23,122 --> 00:43:25,733
It could just be a
technical thing.

610
00:43:25,864 --> 00:43:27,822
No need to work ourselves
silly about it, right?

611
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:29,753
Well, sure, Bobby,
but we just saw the sheriff

612
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:32,348
squeal outta here like a
bat outta hell.

613
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:41,793
<i>Here off the 112 headed
to Bill Unger's property.</i>

614
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:42,663
<i>Copy that, Liz.</i>

615
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:44,230
<i>Everything okay?</i>

616
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,753
<i>Not sure.</i>

617
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:48,277
<i>What'd you find out
about the dog?</i>

618
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:49,951
<i>You know, I'm not
sure I wanna discuss that</i>

619
00:43:49,975 --> 00:43:51,716
<i>till we're back at the office.</i>

620
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:53,366
<i>I'm pulling into town in
a few seconds,</i>

621
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:55,415
<i>so I'll see you both
when you get back, okay?</i>

622
00:43:57,373 --> 00:43:59,201
<i>Copy that, Teddy.</i>

623
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:00,594
<i>All right, Teddy out.</i>

624
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:04,206
Well, he's here right now.

625
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:25,619
Hey, what are y'all doing here?

626
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,968
You okay, Teddy?

627
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:29,667
Yeah, tell us
what's going on, Teddy.

628
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:31,799
Uh, I'm not really sure I
can explain it right now.

629
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,279
Do the best you can, son.

630
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,151
Okay, Rick.

631
00:44:36,282 --> 00:44:38,371
Well, I went out looking
for Bernard's dog,

632
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:42,114
I didn't find it, but I came
across Timmy's bike and...

633
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:43,244
And what?

634
00:44:47,162 --> 00:44:51,123
Yeah, I don't know, look,
I need to make a phone call.

635
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:52,124
I need to call Timmy's parents

636
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:53,275
and make sure he got home safe.

637
00:44:53,299 --> 00:44:55,040
Rick says all the phone
lines are down.

638
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:57,216
All of 'em?

639
00:44:57,346 --> 00:44:58,346
All of 'em.

640
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:03,091
I've seen that look before.

641
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:05,441
Bill.

642
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:06,791
Unger?

643
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:07,921
Yeah.

644
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:09,117
Yeah, he was in town this
morning spouting

645
00:45:09,141 --> 00:45:11,317
his usual crazy nonsense.

646
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:13,362
This time something about
people on his property

647
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:15,277
doing some weird stuff.

648
00:45:15,408 --> 00:45:17,584
Weird stuff?

649
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,388
Yeah, he said to look
out for the phone lines.

650
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:20,761
What does that mean?

651
00:45:20,892 --> 00:45:21,719
Uh, the phone lines.

652
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:23,546
He said...

653
00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:25,679
He was going on about
communications.

654
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,726
Teddy, where are the sheriff
and Liz headed to now?

655
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:32,293
Bill's place.

656
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,230
That looks like blood.

657
00:46:42,582 --> 00:46:43,713
Yes, it does.

658
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:02,383
What is that?

659
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:09,477
He mine the place?

660
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,438
It would appear that way now,
wouldn't it?

661
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:16,572
Where's Bill?

662
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,488
I don't know.

663
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,502
Sheriff?

664
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,028
Sheriff?

665
00:47:37,158 --> 00:47:38,158
Give me a second.

666
00:47:40,335 --> 00:47:41,336
Joe!

667
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:12,078
This is Teddy for Joe.

668
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:13,211
Come in, Joe.

669
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,432
Liz, do you read me?

670
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:21,697
Liz, give me a read here.
Anything.

671
00:49:23,873 --> 00:49:25,614
Maybe they're talking to Bill.

672
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:28,008
Sure, maybe they aren't
by their radio.

673
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:29,923
No.

674
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:33,448
No, a big city cop we're
talking about here.

675
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:35,581
He ain't dumb.

676
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:38,018
He done do things the
way we do here.

677
00:49:38,149 --> 00:49:39,324
What's that supposed to mean?

678
00:49:39,454 --> 00:49:41,369
He just means Joe's a
skeptical guy, that's all.

679
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,154
I can clarify that.

680
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:44,604
Even with Bill's
crazy ass stories

681
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:45,983
he still wanted to investigate.

682
00:49:47,897 --> 00:49:49,223
I guess it takes somebody
from out of town

683
00:49:49,247 --> 00:49:51,727
to think that guy's not
totally off his nut.

684
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,338
I wonder if Timmy's
folks have a CB.

685
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:57,124
All right, so what do we do?

686
00:49:57,255 --> 00:49:59,213
Why the hell you
looking at me for?

687
00:49:59,344 --> 00:50:00,886
There's your new leader
of the pack right there.

688
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,303
No, no.

689
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:04,001
Joe will be back.

690
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:05,959
All right, he'll be back.
We just stay put.

691
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,744
And what do we do if he
don't come back?

692
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:09,875
All right.

693
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,314
I'm gonna drive my rig
over to Bill's,

694
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:15,882
see what I can drum up.

695
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:20,278
I'll stay on the short
wave and listen

696
00:50:20,408 --> 00:50:22,671
for anything that comes in.

697
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:24,543
All right, I guess I'll
make the rounds

698
00:50:24,673 --> 00:50:26,216
and make sure that
everybody's staying calm.

699
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,696
And I guess I better
go make sure Bernard's

700
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,722
not out looking for
his goddamn dog.

701
00:50:29,852 --> 00:50:32,133
Just stay calm, I'll go over
and check on Harry and Deanna

702
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,553
and I'll fill them in
on the situation, Teddy.

703
00:50:34,683 --> 00:50:35,683
All right, Bobby.

704
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:52,440
Hey, Rick.

705
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:53,789
I thought you were leaving.

706
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:56,749
Look, I got a problem.

707
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:59,404
- Somebody ran off with my...
- Somebody lifted my battery.

708
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:06,454
How much you wanna bet
every other vehicle

709
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:08,717
on this block is inoperable?

710
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:11,807
Bet you $5.

711
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,039
Someone don't want us leavin'.

712
00:51:41,228 --> 00:51:43,665
Um, hello?

713
00:51:46,494 --> 00:51:48,385
Though I could pretty much
guarantee that I got nothing

714
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:50,716
in the shop that's gonna
fit in that cruiser.

715
00:51:50,846 --> 00:51:52,457
But if the lines are
back up I can give

716
00:51:52,587 --> 00:51:53,947
a call into Ingram
tomorrow morning

717
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,503
and that's the best I
can do for you.

718
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:57,331
I appreciate it, Rick.

719
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:59,135
I've seen enough weird
shit in the last 24 hours,

720
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:00,759
I don't wanna wait till
tomorrow morning.

721
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:03,163
Okay.

722
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:04,619
You have somewhere
secure to hole up?

723
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:05,643
I'm right here.

724
00:52:06,514 --> 00:52:07,514
All right.

725
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,300
What do you want?

726
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:17,481
Harry!

727
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:19,875
Teddy!

728
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:21,486
Someone!

729
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:22,616
Help!

730
00:52:24,576 --> 00:52:26,360
Rick, you stay here.

731
00:52:36,762 --> 00:52:38,720
Harry! Teddy!

732
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:39,851
Teddy!

733
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:41,332
Somebody help!

734
00:52:48,817 --> 00:52:50,297
Where's the other one?

735
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:51,472
What other one?

736
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:04,397
Come on.

737
00:53:12,014 --> 00:53:13,277
Die!

738
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:24,113
All right, you stay put, Bobby.

739
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:25,593
Okay, you guys.

740
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:26,855
I want you to get inside!

741
00:53:29,554 --> 00:53:31,686
All right, come on you
sons of bitches.

742
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:32,687
Close the door!

743
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:34,036
Harry, no, come on.

744
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:35,864
- No, no, no, no.
- Come on.

745
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:38,215
Shut the goddamn door!

746
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:40,042
Harry!

747
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,562
Show yourselves!

748
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,262
Come on!

749
00:54:32,051 --> 00:54:34,793
I ain't in the mood for
no hide and seek.

750
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,914
What's with all the gunshots?

751
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:11,308
I'm not so sure I know
what's going on.

752
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:15,921
It's better we stay here.

753
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:20,839
Gunshots from Rick's place.

754
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,710
Can you see him?

755
00:55:25,278 --> 00:55:27,846
No, but Rick's a smart fella.

756
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:29,214
Yeah, well smarts don't
matter if they get

757
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:31,066
the jump on you like
these fellas have.

758
00:55:31,197 --> 00:55:32,197
We've seen that.

759
00:55:33,678 --> 00:55:34,998
How the hell do they
move so fast?

760
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:36,114
Who are these people?

761
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:38,812
I don't know.

762
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,296
We have any guns in here?

763
00:55:43,427 --> 00:55:44,950
No.

764
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,778
Harry's always hated the
damned things.

765
00:55:48,127 --> 00:55:49,302
Yeah.

766
00:56:23,597 --> 00:56:25,120
All right.

767
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:26,470
Wanna dance?

768
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:30,690
Let's tango.

769
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:39,396
Son of a bitch.

770
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,312
How many of you
fuckers are there?

771
00:56:53,192 --> 00:56:54,411
See ya, kitties.

772
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:00,895
Shit.

773
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:05,030
Holy shit.

774
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:08,599
Oh, my God.

775
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,427
All right, I gotta get
back to the station.

776
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:12,864
You can't go out there.

777
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:14,561
Yeah, she's right, Teddy,
you can't.

778
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:16,084
No, there's no other option.

779
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:18,608
Why?

780
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:22,221
I got another revolver
in the office,

781
00:57:22,351 --> 00:57:24,745
ammo, and I'm pretty sure
I have a shotgun

782
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:25,964
in the back of the cruiser.

783
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:29,446
Shit, it might be in
Joe's cruiser.

784
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:31,099
Come on. Think, Teddy, think.

785
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:34,712
Teddy.

786
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:35,842
Here.

787
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:38,106
Take that.

788
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:40,239
My god, what is this
thing doing in here?

789
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:41,608
Harry always made us
keep it in case

790
00:57:41,632 --> 00:57:43,155
anybody ever tried to
rob the place.

791
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:48,769
Yeah, right.

792
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,988
Yeah, as if.

793
00:57:50,989 --> 00:57:52,817
Okay.

794
00:57:52,947 --> 00:57:55,863
It's only about 100 feet
to the station, all right?

795
00:57:55,994 --> 00:57:57,354
As soon as I get in
there I can try

796
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,432
and hail somebody on
the short wave.

797
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:01,042
Hang in there, okay?

798
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:02,522
All right.

799
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:04,453
Hey, y'all, there's
something moving in there.

800
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:09,136
What the hell?

801
00:58:09,224 --> 00:58:11,183
Is that one of us?

802
00:58:11,313 --> 00:58:12,576
I think it's Rick.

803
00:58:12,706 --> 00:58:14,447
Yeah.

804
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:29,027
Bernard!

805
00:58:33,901 --> 00:58:35,816
Bernard?

806
00:58:35,947 --> 00:58:36,947
Bernard!

807
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:06,978
What happened?

808
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,700
Come on, come on.

809
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:38,575
- Hurry, come on.
- Come on.

810
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:39,705
Come on.

811
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:47,105
Where's Rick?

812
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:49,672
He didn't make it.

813
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:54,068
We watched him go into
Bernard's and...

814
00:59:56,331 --> 00:59:57,332
Oh, my God.

815
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:02,120
What is going on?

816
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,949
Georgia, have you been
keeping an ear on the radio?

817
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:07,038
Yeah, but there's nothing.

818
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:07,952
Nothing?

819
01:00:08,082 --> 01:00:09,082
Nothing.

820
01:00:09,127 --> 01:00:10,519
Nothing from Joe or Liz?

821
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:11,650
Nothing.

822
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:15,655
Mom, do you think we
can call out?

823
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:18,310
Best we could do is
broadcast out

824
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,879
and hope somebody driving
by has their radio on.

825
01:00:22,009 --> 01:00:23,576
Yeah, that's a hell
of a long shot.

826
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,840
But it could work.

827
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,584
You got any more
shells for that?

828
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,978
The two shells I just
spent have been sitting

829
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:35,719
in this thing for seven years.

830
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:38,896
Why the fuck would I have
any more shells?

831
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:40,462
Okay, Georgia.

832
01:00:40,593 --> 01:00:42,900
Well, I have more shells but
they're back at the station.

833
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:44,030
Yeah.

834
01:00:44,118 --> 01:00:45,990
Mom, you got here
with no problem,

835
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,645
so maybe Teddy can get back
down a few doors without issue.

836
01:00:48,775 --> 01:00:50,298
How many of them are there?

837
01:00:52,474 --> 01:00:53,867
We don't even know, do we?

838
01:00:56,348 --> 01:00:58,045
Do we even know what they want?

839
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,009
There was something else.

840
01:01:08,316 --> 01:01:09,448
What do you mean, Cindy?

841
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:13,582
There is something in
those trees.

842
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:16,760
It got Rick.

843
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:20,938
What like another one
of those people?

844
01:01:21,068 --> 01:01:22,068
No, no.

845
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:24,245
It was like something inhuman.

846
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:40,348
I'm gonna have to go
to the station.

847
01:01:41,436 --> 01:01:42,829
Teddy, you can't.

848
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,960
It's okay, Deanna.

849
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:46,005
It's my job.

850
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:51,098
All right, y'all are
gonna have to stay here.

851
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:52,447
Hold this place down.

852
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:53,598
As soon as I leave you lock

853
01:01:53,622 --> 01:01:54,774
this place up, you understand,
Bobby?

854
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:55,798
All right.

855
01:01:57,844 --> 01:01:59,716
Deanna, you still
have that radio?

856
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:10,117
Yeah, okay.

857
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:12,337
All right, I can use this
to call you guys

858
01:02:12,467 --> 01:02:14,427
from the station but you
won't be able to respond.

859
01:02:15,601 --> 01:02:17,255
Take this.

860
01:02:17,385 --> 01:02:19,561
Do you a lot more good than us.

861
01:02:19,692 --> 01:02:20,713
Georgia, what the hell
am I gonna do

862
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,042
with an empty shotgun?

863
01:02:24,218 --> 01:02:26,699
Look, I got another
pistol in the office.

864
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,919
I'll get you some more
shells for that

865
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:30,529
and then I'll hustle back here.

866
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:32,226
And then what?

867
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,619
As soon as the sun comes up

868
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:37,318
I will walk us outta
here if I have to.

869
01:02:42,323 --> 01:02:43,324
Okay.

870
01:02:44,586 --> 01:02:45,762
What are they doing?

871
01:02:53,421 --> 01:02:55,206
What are they doing?

872
01:02:55,336 --> 01:02:56,337
What the hell?

873
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:03,954
They're feeding
whatever's in there.

874
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:14,596
I'm not so sure going
out there is the best.

875
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:22,869
Must've gone out back, I'm
gonna make sure it's locked.

876
01:03:47,954 --> 01:03:48,954
Come on.

877
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:50,000
Okay.

878
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,857
Come on. Come on.

879
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:36,002
Get the hell inside now!

880
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:42,835
Come on, come on!

881
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:52,714
Jesus Christ!

882
01:04:52,845 --> 01:04:53,933
Joe, you're alive!

883
01:04:54,064 --> 01:04:55,064
Oh yeah.

884
01:04:56,109 --> 01:04:58,329
Here.

885
01:04:58,459 --> 01:05:00,418
Anybody comes through
that door, you kill it.

886
01:05:03,334 --> 01:05:04,378
Where's Liz?

887
01:05:11,385 --> 01:05:13,257
What the hell's going on here,
Joe?

888
01:05:13,387 --> 01:05:14,693
Oh, haven't you heard?

889
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:16,143
Some asshole said
some fancy words

890
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,262
and raised a goddamn
demon outta hell.

891
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:24,050
What the hell do they want?

892
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:26,530
Ain't it obvious?

893
01:05:32,276 --> 01:05:34,191
We saw them feeding it.

894
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:35,670
There you go.

895
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:38,108
Serving us up like dinner
on a goddamn silver platter.

896
01:05:38,238 --> 01:05:39,238
Shit.

897
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:43,330
They're even feeding
it their dead.

898
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:52,513
You saw it, didn't you, Joe?

899
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:56,430
Up close and personal.

900
01:05:57,649 --> 01:05:58,867
How'd you get away from it?

901
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:05,526
I wined it, dined it,
and then I claymore mined it.

902
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:08,573
Where were you?

903
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:11,837
Bill's front yard.

904
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,056
Joe.

905
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:15,710
Look in the evidence locker.

906
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,460
Holy shit.

907
01:06:29,376 --> 01:06:30,769
Where the hell did you get this?

908
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:32,312
We caught Bill using
it a couple years back

909
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:34,120
trying to get rid of a
mole problem.

910
01:06:34,251 --> 01:06:36,818
The sheriff before, he had
to wrestle it away from him.

911
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:38,298
Thank you, Bill.

912
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:41,910
Where the hell are these guys?

913
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:45,914
Who's left?

914
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:48,482
We've got Cindy, Georgia,
Bobby and Deanna

915
01:06:48,613 --> 01:06:49,788
all locked in at the grille.

916
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,921
All right.

917
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,508
You gotta make sure that
they stay alive,

918
01:06:54,532 --> 01:06:55,402
and when the time is right,

919
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:57,230
you're gonna get
them outta town.

920
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:59,015
How am I gonna do that?

921
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:01,626
Oh, we're gonna level the
playing field.

922
01:07:01,756 --> 01:07:04,194
Where they feeding him at?

923
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:05,910
Uh, last we saw it was over
at Bernard's tree farm,

924
01:07:05,934 --> 01:07:08,067
but shit, it could be
anywhere by now.

925
01:07:10,983 --> 01:07:12,613
Rick told me you were
a good football player.

926
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:13,768
Is that true?

927
01:07:13,899 --> 01:07:15,683
I was back in high school, why?

928
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:19,035
I want you to run
straight up the middle,

929
01:07:19,165 --> 01:07:21,037
draw as many of those
Michael Myers wannabes

930
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,167
with you as you can.

931
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:24,430
Okay.

932
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:26,781
Who's Michael Myers?

933
01:07:29,871 --> 01:07:32,352
Oh, for Christ's sakes
just holster this thing up.

934
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:34,702
What are you gonna do?

935
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:40,752
Oh, I have a date with a
big toothy horny monster

936
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:42,493
and it's about to get fucked!

937
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:45,757
Okay, okay.

938
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:50,891
Georgia.

939
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:57,986
<i>I'm over at the sheriff's
station and Joe's here,</i>

940
01:07:58,117 --> 01:08:00,685
he's, he's alive.

941
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:02,643
<i>I'm on the way back to you,
Georgia.</i>

942
01:08:02,774 --> 01:08:04,515
<i>God, I hope you can hear this.</i>

943
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:06,285
<i>You better be ready to get
that door open.</i>

944
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,092
Mom, Mom.

945
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:19,007
Bobby, no!

946
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:26,102
Oh, my God.

947
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,844
Go get some towels!

948
01:08:29,975 --> 01:08:32,412
- Bobby, Bobby.
- Here, here, here.

949
01:08:32,543 --> 01:08:35,850
How did he stab him?

950
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:38,723
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
look at me.

951
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:40,594
Duct tape or any other
kind of tape.

952
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:41,987
I don't see any.

953
01:08:43,206 --> 01:08:44,511
Breathe, Bobby.

954
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:45,904
Breathe, breathe.

955
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:47,123
Breathe, Bobby.

956
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:49,342
- Bobby, look at me.
- Really tight.

957
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:51,475
It's gonna be
okay. You'll be okay.

958
01:08:51,605 --> 01:08:54,173
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no.

959
01:08:54,304 --> 01:08:55,827
Don't say that, don't say that.

960
01:08:55,957 --> 01:08:57,611
There's nothing to be sorry for.

961
01:08:57,742 --> 01:08:59,744
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

962
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:03,617
It's okay, it's okay.

963
01:09:03,748 --> 01:09:04,749
Just breathe son.

964
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,185
Deanna, put some
pressure on him.

965
01:09:06,316 --> 01:09:07,447
Bobby, stay with me.

966
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:09,319
Look at me, look at me.

967
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:10,449
Look at me.

968
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:14,671
Bobby.

969
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:20,852
It's all right,
you're gonna be okay.

970
01:09:20,982 --> 01:09:23,942
Bobby, Bobby, come back to me.

971
01:09:24,072 --> 01:09:25,552
Come back.

972
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:26,858
- It's okay.
- I'm okay.

973
01:09:26,988 --> 01:09:30,296
Just breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe.

974
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:32,385
No, slow, slow.

975
01:09:32,516 --> 01:09:34,909
It's okay, it's okay.

976
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,346
It'll be okay.

977
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:37,999
You're gonna be okay.

978
01:09:39,653 --> 01:09:41,699
Bobby.

979
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:23,567
- Teddy, come here.
- Get in, get in!

980
01:10:23,697 --> 01:10:25,612
God damn!

981
01:10:26,874 --> 01:10:28,441
Okay, come!

982
01:10:31,096 --> 01:10:32,271
- You're okay.
- Okay.

983
01:10:32,402 --> 01:10:34,273
- Yeah?
- I'm okay.

984
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:35,796
I'm okay.

985
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:37,189
Yeah.

986
01:10:42,629 --> 01:10:43,629
Is he?

987
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,678
Yeah.

988
01:10:47,808 --> 01:10:49,680
He died just a few minutes ago.

989
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:54,250
I'm sorry.

990
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,380
It's not your fault.

991
01:10:55,468 --> 01:10:56,619
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

992
01:10:56,643 --> 01:10:58,428
I was just...

993
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:02,606
Help me.

994
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,352
Joe.

995
01:11:13,747 --> 01:11:15,053
Joe's still out there.

996
01:15:17,164 --> 01:15:18,862
Come on!

997
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:26,582
Is that all of 'em?

998
01:16:27,931 --> 01:16:29,802
Yeah, I think so.

999
01:16:42,423 --> 01:16:44,251
How's your night going, Sheriff?

1000
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:47,341
I think it's gonna be okay.

1001
01:16:49,517 --> 01:16:50,736
You all right, deputy?

1002
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:54,627
Yeah, I think I'll be all right.

1003
01:16:56,002 --> 01:16:57,003
Good.

1004
01:16:58,178 --> 01:16:59,963
What now, Joe?

1005
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:01,723
Well, I think we should
get the hell out of here

1006
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:03,662
and find the next
biggest town, do we all agree?

1007
01:17:03,793 --> 01:17:04,663
Sounds like a plan.

1008
01:17:04,794 --> 01:17:06,230
Yeah.

1009
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,624
We gotta find a car that
has a battery in it.

1010
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:10,408
Well, then let's go do that.

1011
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:22,159
So, how do you
like small towns, Sheriff?

1012
01:17:24,857 --> 01:17:26,206
Think we could take the subway?

1013
01:18:53,293 --> 01:18:55,469
Wow, what's going
on in the next town over?

1014
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,167
Seems to be a lot of
police action.

1015
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:01,606
No one cares about us
small town folks, Sheila.

1016
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,097
Hell, that's why I
moved to Ingram.

1017
01:19:03,173 --> 01:19:04,653
Couldn't stand the
crowds and tourists

1018
01:19:04,696 --> 01:19:06,350
and all that capitalism.

1019
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,480
Not for me.

1020
01:19:09,657 --> 01:19:11,572
You're just such a sourpuss.

1021
01:19:13,574 --> 01:19:16,316
That's what they say.

1022
01:19:19,015 --> 01:19:21,626
Uh, what can I do for ya today?

1023
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,847
Well, you can tell me about
your quaint little town here.

1024
01:22:59,931 --> 01:23:00,931
Thank you.

1025
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:04,980
Pretty interesting story, miss.

1026
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:07,939
Well, it's all true.

1027
01:23:10,594 --> 01:23:11,769
Have you talked to Teddy?

1028
01:23:13,249 --> 01:23:15,077
Or Joe?

1029
01:23:15,207 --> 01:23:16,556
Sheriff Anderson? Yeah.

1030
01:23:16,687 --> 01:23:17,731
Yeah, we have.

1031
01:23:18,819 --> 01:23:21,561
Then you know everything.

1032
01:23:21,692 --> 01:23:23,132
Well, it's a
rather farfetched story,

1033
01:23:23,215 --> 01:23:25,522
certainly you can
understand that.

1034
01:23:25,652 --> 01:23:26,871
But not untrue.

1035
01:23:30,266 --> 01:23:31,546
Do you know where
the bodies are?

1036
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:34,792
The tree farm.

1037
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:37,925
Have you checked the tree farm?

1038
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:41,277
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

1039
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:43,235
Yeah, there was nothing there.

1040
01:23:43,366 --> 01:23:44,889
Miss, to be honest,
there's no evidence

1041
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,283
that anyone was there other
than your own townsfolk.

1042
01:23:47,413 --> 01:23:48,893
What?

1043
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,156
We know something happened,

1044
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:53,028
that you got missing
people, that's a fact.

1045
01:23:54,638 --> 01:23:56,248
What about Georgia?

1046
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:57,899
She would never of left
her son's side,

1047
01:23:57,989 --> 01:24:01,210
she had to been there
when you got there, right?

1048
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:04,865
Georgia's missing.

1049
01:24:04,996 --> 01:24:05,996
We don't know where at.

1050
01:24:07,651 --> 01:24:09,261
Dead.

1051
01:24:09,392 --> 01:24:11,350
So what you're saying.

1052
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:13,787
Let the truth be told you
all have the same story,

1053
01:24:13,918 --> 01:24:15,678
but there's no real
evidence of what happened

1054
01:24:15,746 --> 01:24:17,400
other than a bunch of you
small town folk

1055
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:18,810
going a bit crazy coming up with

1056
01:24:18,879 --> 01:24:21,012
a very bizarre
account of events.

1057
01:24:21,143 --> 01:24:22,448
So, help me here.

1058
01:24:22,579 --> 01:24:24,407
What is it you're
not telling us?

1059
01:24:24,537 --> 01:24:28,019
It doesn't matter what I
tell you, you won't believe

1060
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:29,670
what we saw until you
see for yourself.
