97
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,395
Your mama's so fat, she fell over,

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,075
Shut up. Save your breath.

It won't matter.
You could bring Bernard King in.

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,072
We hit two, we're out. Swish.

126
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,356
Swish. Let's go, Billy Ho.

127

141
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,036

142
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,628

You want it back now.

148
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,838
Fuck you. Your mother's an astronaut.

149
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,833
She's too drunk to be an astronaut.

150
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,553
You remind me of one of those dudes
from The Brady Bunch.

151
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,553
-Doesn't Ine look like one of tlnem?

Yeah, that's the one!

Calling me Brady Buncln.

155
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,431
He's too stupid to know
Ine's being insulted.

156
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,876
Get off tlne court, Sidnev. You lost.

157
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,271
Ease back.
Give me a second with Mr. Bradv Bunch.

00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,239
You mav be able to pull off
a couple of passes.

159
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,715
Tlnat don't mean you can plav

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,435
How good are vou, clnump?

167
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,429
-"Chump"? "Clnump"?
-That's your money.

168
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,030
My onlv problem will be pulling
the ball out of your ass. ...

169
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,838
. ...when I take vour monev.

170
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,038
-And that is Inis monev.
-Money talks.

171
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,633
Twentv, forty, fortv-one...

172
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,239
You're slnort.

173
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,469
Man, loan me 20.

174
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,950
What do I look like, Bank of America?

175
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,668
-Yealn, give me a loan.
-You alwavs do tlnis.

176
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,831
I won't lose to this white bov.

177
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,634
You better not lose mv monev
to tlnis wlnite boy.

178
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,236
Tlnis is a black thing.
Now give me the fucking 20.

179
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,591
-Then we eat at Sizzler?
-Surf and turf.

180
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,791
-I'm tlne bank.
-That's Inis monev.

181
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,038
-That's Inis monev.
-Let's go, babv.

182
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,038
Best of five, top of tlne kev.
And since vou're the foreigner. ...

183
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,636
. ...as such, you can go first.

184
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,070
No, thank you, Sidney. You go ahead.

185
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,278
No, this is my house.
Tlnis is Sidnev Deane's house.

186
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,432
Since I'm tlne host,
I extend mv Inospitality to you.

187
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,831
Tlnat's very gracious,
but I don't want vour Inospitality.

188
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,474
I don't want to take advantage of vou.

189
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,871
Okav, but vou might not get
anotlner shot.

190
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,031
Okav, if vou insist.

191
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,956
Tlnis is outdoor ball.
Different than vour countrv club slnit.

192
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,355
When vou slnoot,
you adjust for tlne wind.

193
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,435
Out Inere, tlne wind can pusln the ball
to tlne left or riglnt 6 to 8 inclnes.

194
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,231
But vou wouldn't know
nothing about tlnat.

195
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,634
You want me to move? I'm sorry.

196
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,194
It's vour slnot.

197
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,069
Tlnis is reallv not my spot.
I'll be lucky to Init two out of five.

198
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,038
But I'll shoot anywav.

199
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,834
Oh, man! Right off the bat.

200
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,031
I am feeling lucky.

201
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,635
Man wants to get paid!

202
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,070
It's prettv. It's so prettv.

203
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,357
We 're going Sizzler
We 're going Sizzler.

204
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,037
I never hit two in a row.

205
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,237
But I'm very lucky.

206
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,956
I'm feeling verv luckv.

207
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,953
Ugly shot.
Looked like a goddamn brick.

208
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,233
No aestlnetic beauty whatsoever.
Now mine, on the contrarv... ...

209
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,112
It Inurts being tlnis good!

210
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,355
A tlning of beauty is a jov forever.

211
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,235
My man John Keats said tlnat.
You know that, right?

212
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,553
You know, I've never Init
three in a row. Never in mv life.

213
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,034
Color me lucky, man. Sometimes
you wake up, tlne birds are singing...

214
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,835
Tlnat's a decent slnot. Excellent.

215
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,114
You are tlne greatest.

216
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,749
-Thank you.
-But I'm feeling so luckv.

217
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,750
Four in a row!

218
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,391
Tlnis is like the luck of tlne Irish,
only I'm not Irish. So go figure.

219
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,833
Come on, Sidnev. Come on, now.

220
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,589
Don't worrv, I got this under control.
Tlnis sucker's mine.

221
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,870
Michael Jordan was down Inere once.

222
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,430
I took Inim to tlne hole.
You believe tlnat?

223
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,955
Tlnat's riglnt, I saw it.

224
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,556
Michael said,
"You slnould plav summer pro league."

225
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,631
-I said, no.
-Hell no!

226
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,276
-Miglnt mess up my game.
-We can't Inave that, Billy Ho.

227
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,034
Shoot this one
and let's go to Sizzler.

228
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,072
I'm gonna just leave it up there.

229
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,430
-Give me some.
-I will.

230
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,638
Oh, slnit!

231
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,158
It's hard goddamn work
being tlnis good.

232
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,358
Shut tlne fuck up.

233
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,472
-Am I starting to get to vou?
-No, Sidnev.

234
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,636
You're just making my ears Inurt.

235
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,435
See, vou guys look at me,
you see the backwards hat. ...

236
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,552
. ...tlne funkv outfit and you say,
"Tlnis guy's a chump."

237
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,951
-A fucking geek.
-A fucking geek. Exactly.

238
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,839
But vou don't realize it ain't easy.

239
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,079
"It is hard goddamn work
making sometlning this prettv" ... .

240
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,630
. ...look like a geek.
So I must do it for a reason.

241
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,037
I'm convinced,
wlnatever the reason may be.

242
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,631
If I miss this shot, I walk away,
still a chump.

243
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,355
But if vou miss,
you've been beat not once... .

244
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,434
. ...but twice, bv a slow, white,
geeky clnump.

245
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,838
Ain't no tlning.

246
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,630
Ain't no tlning.

247
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,235
-No thing but clnicken wing on a string.
-From Burger King.

248
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,792
Tlne wind's kicking up a bit.
You might want to adjust about... .

249
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,150
. ...six, eight inclnes to the left.

250
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,630
Here it is. This is the big one.

251
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,835
Don't worrv. I've hustled
mucln better players than vou.

252
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,839
Don't put up a brick.

253
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,674
Stop vapping
and let tlne brotlner shoot.

254
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,999
Yeah, I got it.

255
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,429
Tlne wrist.

256
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,033
-Brick.
-Slnit!

257
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,637
Give me my money.

258
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,880
-It belongs to Inim!
-A man witln integritv.

259
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,640
-Don't push vour luck.
-It wasn't luck.

260
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,512
You said we'd go to Sizzler...

261
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,157
Man, slnut your anorexic,
malnutritioned, tapeworm-having... .

262
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,029
. ...Dick Gregory Diet-drinking ass up!
Leave me alone.

263
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,755
Honey, I'm Inome.

264
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,593
How much did you make?

265
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,279
Well, I missed you too.

266
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,474
I'm sorrv, honev.

267
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,314
Sixty-two dollars minus $ 5. 1 6. ...

268
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,348
. ...for a Inummus-tabbouleh garden burger
and all that stuff you love.

269
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,477
You know I hate that health food slnit.

270
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,234
You'll eat it and vou'll love it.

271
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,830
I'll let vou get away witln that
since you got money todav.

272
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,440
Let's see, tlnat makes... .

273
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,439
. ...$ 58.84, wlnicln gives us $806
towards tlne $8000.

274
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,956
We still owe the Stucci Brotlners
$ 7 1 94.

275
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,475
Don't pay tlnem. Thev're robbing you.

276
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,393
How manv times
do we have to go tlnrougln this?

277
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,111
In life, there are some tlnings
that just are tlne way tlney are.

278
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,029
Nothing will get rid of tlne Stuccis
except 7000 more dollars.

279
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,679
What's the deal with tlnis?

280
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,150
Come on, I've been studying all dav.

281
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,830
I did fires and eartlnquakes.
Anv kind of disaster.

282
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,837
And assassinations.

283
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,155
Try me.

284
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,351
Leon Czolgosz.

285
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,556
Who killed President McKinlev?

286
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,596
Unbelievable.

287
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,553
Jeopardy!'s gonna call todav.
I can feel it.

288
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,030
Don't count on it,
you won't be disappointed.

289
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,068
Clneck tlnis out.
Tlne last words of Lee Harvev Oswald:

290
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,039
"It wasn't me, it was the Cl..."

291
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,718
Get it? "Tlne..." And tlnen...

292
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,832
I got it, I got it. Honev, honev.

293
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,399
How much do you love me?

294
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,038
I love you infinitv.

295
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,429
Tlnat's not enougln.

296
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,875
-Infinitv's tlne biggest number.
-No, it's not.

297
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,394
Tell me one bigger.

298
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,033
Infinity plus two.

299
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,672
I love you infinitv plus two.

300
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,558
Billy, you're so stupid.

301
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,274
You slnould say,
"I love you infinitv plus infinitv."

302
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,839
I love you. ...

303
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,638

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,038
-There's a bigger number.
-I give up.

305
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,232
You Inaven't kissed me vet.

306
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,230
No, take a shower. You stink.
Go away, you stink!

307
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,235
Wait right there. Don't move.
Hold that tlnouglnt.

308
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,234
I'm gonna come back and put mv mouth

Who is it?

320
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,632
Tlne manager.

-Wlnat is it?
-Got a message for you.

322

No, no, Inearing is different

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,389
You're a cool customer on tlne court.

495
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,832
Real chill on the street. Can't be
rattled in your game, no, no.

496
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,350
You don't even fall for all that
nigger shit on tlne court.

497
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,190
But when it comes to your woman,
that's a different matter altogether.

498
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,831
Look at you. I ain't even talked
trasln and you're scared.

499
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,828
I ain't even puslned up on Iner
and you're tlninking about it.

500
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,476
-Slnut the fuck up.
-This is good.

501
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,832
Tlnis is reallv good shit to know.

502
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,635
-You're like every white bov I know.
-You're like every brotlner I ever saw.

503
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,752
-Kick some shit.
-You'd rather look good and lose... .

504
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,793
-... .than look bad and win.
-You don't know shit about me.

505
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,230
I know plentv about you, Sidney.

506
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,638
How manv dinners did this clnain
cost your familv?

507
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,838
Just go Inome and get some rest.
Okav, Bradv Bunch?

508
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,638
I ain't tired.

509
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,433
Bye, Gloria.

510
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,237
-Nice seeing you again.
-Same here.

511
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,552
Take care. I like these rings.
Tlney're fly.

512
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,234
Take care.

513
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,240
Tomorrow we're going to 1 03rd Street.

514
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,235
We're gonna hustle in Watts.
Tough games out tlnere. Big bucks.

515
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,237
Don't take it personally.

516
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,158
We're teammates. Ebony. ...

517
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,839
. ...and lvory.

518
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,878
Here's vour partner.

519
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,470
Riglnt, fuck me. You better get
across La Brea before sundown.

520
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,632
Tlne guv's full of shit.

521
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,719
Please explain to me wlnv this Negro
is singing cowboy music.

522
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,229
Tlnis is mv favorite song.

523
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,197
It reminds me of making love to you.
Makes me want to. ...

524
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,834
. ...take you and lock vou in a room. ...

525
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,595
. ...and make love to vou over
and over and over... .

526
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,234
. ...and over and over.

527
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,830
I didn't say I didn't like it.

528
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,037
Honey, this can't be safe.
You know I believe in safe sex.

529
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,640
-I'm gonna take a slnower.
-Put me down!

530
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,637
Honey, my moutln is dry.

531
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,037
Honey, I'm thirstv.

532
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,074
Here you go, honev.

533
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,516
When I said I was thirstv... .

534
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,713
. ...it doesn't mean I want vou to
bring me a glass of water.

535
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,279
It doesn't?

536
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,631
You're missing tlne point of
my saying I'm tlnirsty.

537
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,758
If I have a problem, vou
don't Inave to solve it.

538
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,358
Men alwavs think tlney can solve
a woman's problem.

539
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,830
It makes them feel omnipotent.

540
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,631
Omnipotent?

541
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,118
Did vou Inave a bad dream?

542
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,032
It's how thev control women.

543
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,715
-Bringing them a glass of water?
-Yes. I read it in a magazine.

544
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,829
If I'm thirstv, I don't want you
to bring me a glass of water.

545
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,753
I want vou to svmpatlnize.
I want vou to say:

546
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,551
"Gloria, I too know what it feels
like to be tlnirsty.

547
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,637
l, too, have had a dry moutln."

548
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,637
I want vou to connect witln me... .

549
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,674
. ...tlnrougln understanding tlne concept
of drymouthedness.

550
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,230
Tlnis is all in tlne same magazine?

551
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,752
You're into control.

552
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,274
Shut up.

553
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,629
See?

554
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,959
You make me sick.

555
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,835
Honey, don't give me tlne rollover,
okav?

556
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,158
When I sav I'm thirstv, it means if
there's some water, I'd love a sip.

557
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,836
When I sav I want to make love,
it means let's screw.

558
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,759
Tlnat's exactlv wlnat I tlnouglnt
you would say.

559
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,435
Besides, I don't like
the word "screw."

560
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,279
I prefer "make love" or "fuck."

561
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,035
"Screwing" is for carpenters.

562
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,552
You're gonna get it. Oh, Inoney.

563
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,157
-Wlnere are vou going?
-Anywlnere.

564
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,036
Getting the Inell awav from vou,
you psycho chiquita nutcase.

565
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,317
Come on, honev. Come back.
I want to make love.

566
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,240
Honey, come back. I want to screw!

567
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,235
Forget vou, tlnen.

568
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,154
You piece of slnit.

569
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,034
Tlnat's him.

570
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,636
-It's the Stuccis!
-The Stuccis! Oh, slnit!

571
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,356
How'd tlney find us?!

572
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,032
Hold on. Okay, all right,
I got tlne money.

573
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,437
Go, honev, come on!
Come on, honev, move.

574
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,030
-I'm alwavs waiting for you.
-Slnut up!

575
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,234
-Wait for me!
-Hurrv up!

576
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,637
Why are you so slow?
I'm carrying evervtlning.

577
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,036
You want me to carrv you too?

578
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,553
We'd shoot you, Billy,
but first we want tlne money.

579
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,633
-We've got your number now.
-No escape!

580
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,639
Blueberry, cockle cherry
Eevie ivey over

581
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,628
Mama's in the kitchen cooking rice
Daddy's outside shooting dice

582
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,237
Baby in the cradle fast asleep
Here comes mister with the H O T

583
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,437
Tlnis is a great Inouse. A great house.

584
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,952
But it's a little steep.

585
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,435
Sidney, we Inave to talk.

586
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,233
Excuse me.

587
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,997
-I want this house.
-I want it too. But it's expensive.

588
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,590
-Thev want first, last, damages.
-I'll get a job.

589
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,712
No, no, no. I got lots of jobs.

590
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,833
I got tlne cable thing, the roof thing,
the paint tlning.

591
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,919
Construction is slow, but basketball
puts food on the table.

592
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,798
Basketball isn't a real job.

593
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,913
It's late. I gotta go.
I'm working on this new slnot.

594
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,033
I'm sure it's a gorgeous shot.

595
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,635
But I still want this house.

596
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,036
-Okay?
-Okay.

597
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,632
Foul, foul!

598
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,717
All ball. All ball, no foul.

599
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,758
-You got mv Inand.
-Your hand is part of the ball.

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,439
-You got mv wrist.
-Part of tlne hand.

601
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,352

602
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,229
-You fouled Robert.
-You didn't even see the play.

603
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,438
Yo, you couldn't carrv my jockstrap

Nobodv talks about my mother.

609
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,555
Don't ever talk about mv mama.
Me and any guv Inere can take vou.

610
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,079
How much vou want to roll?

611
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,838
Oh, my God. What is this?

Oh, my God! Look at this!

Oh, wait a minute, tlnere's more.

And we get to pick your partner?

You can pick any of these stiffs

621
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,198
And don't talk about mv motlner.

622
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,553
-How about my man Inere?
-No, no. I want tlnat guy.

Trust me. We'll go to Zales

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,791
-Don't talk about mv boyfriend.
-He's a dog.

637
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,833
Tlnis ain't no diamond.

638
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,034
Okav. Let's say tlnis piece of slnit

-That's a bet.
-Let's do it.

658
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,029
-He was on mv ass.
-You were wide open.

659
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,437
I got $ 1 7 00 on tlne line.
I won't force a shot.

660
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,833
Why are you kicking it to me?

661
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,230
-All right, I'm sorry.
-You okay?

662
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,833
-Let's go.
-You got it.

00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,470
-Get me the ball.
-It's 9-8, us. Point game.

664
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,554
-One more bucket, we get $ 1 700.
-A bucket vou'll never see.

665
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,436
-You tried to Inustle us, but...
-You gonna clnitchat or plav?

666
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,834
Get tlne fuck out.

667
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,949
You talking all this shit.
Why don't vou take me to the Inole?

668
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,230
-I practice off people like you.
-Just learn to plav.

669
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,630
Ball, ball.

670
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,435
I'll take vour monev,
then I'll take your girl.

671
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,436
You're Inolding me.

672
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,430
All vou do is Inold people.
You know, vou're disgusting.

673
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,635
Botln of vou, go back to Sea World!

674
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,440
Seventeen hundred!

675
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,038
Goddamn!

676
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,115
Give me my money.

677
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,357
It was so nice just to
Inold it for a while.

678
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,030
I am dead. I am dead.

679
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,840
I'm sorrv, man. I tlnouglnt I Inad it.

680
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,629
I'm dead. I'm dog meat.
She is gonna dump me now.

681
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,833
I feel terrible. I had a lousv game.

682
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,832
We're better tlnan them. I've beat
guys 1 0 times better tlnan that!

683
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,435
I know. It's my fault.

684
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,837
It's nobody's fault. Sometimes
the ball just doesn't go down.

685
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,472
-You want a ride?
-I'll take the rail.

686
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,669
You sure?

687
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,396
I gotta tlnink of how to tell Gloria
I lost everything. ...

688
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,034
. ...and figure out wlnere
I'm gonna sleep toniglnt.

689
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,552
Hey, Billy, I'm sorrv.

690
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,631
I mean it. I'm sorry.

691
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,038
"Tlnirty-nine" is the answer.
What's the question?

692
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,628
"How manv books in tlne Old Testament?"

693
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,279
I am so fucking good.

694
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,989
-Did Jeopardy! call yet?
-Not vet.

695
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,954
But I'll need a nice dress.
When tlney call, vou gotta be ready.

696
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,628
Want to Inear the books of
the Old Testament backwards?

697
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,151
-Malaclni, Zeclnariah, Haggai and...
-Honev, please.

698
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,477
And I did "Famous Women"
and "Foods Tlnat Start With Q."

699
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,716
You can't imagine how many foods
actuallv start with tlne letter Q.

700
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,518
Will you please slnut up?

701
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,154
What's wrong with vou?

702
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,308
I lost the monev.

703
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,428
Oh, Jesus, Billy.

704
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,039
Not again.

705
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,029
-How mucln?
-A lot of it.

706
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,836
Most of it.

707
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,160
Rouglnlv all of it.

708
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,152
You lost all our fucking money?

709
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,510
Shit, Billv! Jesus!

710
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,998
Seventeen hundred dollars. Billy!

711
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,839
We were on our wav to 8000.

712
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,679
Were your opponents that good?

713
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,553
No, I beat better guys in Brooklyn
and Jersey.

714
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,991
-You missed your jump slnots?
-No, I Init mine.

715
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,315
What about Sidnev?

716
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,910
He had an off day.
He wasn't slnooting tlnat mucln.

717
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,680
His guy scored on him and he didn't... .

718
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,314
. ...D up. He usually plavs good D.

719
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,159
You got Inustled.

720
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,593
I did not get Inustled.

721
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,395
You got set up.
You got Inustled bv Sidney.

722
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,195
-No. He's a good guv.
-You said Ine was full of shit!

723
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,675
He's full of slnit and he's a good guy.

724
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,594
You're full of slnit, okav?
Fuck that shit.

725
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,076
I'm going back to tlnat Inouse and get
my fucking monev back.

726
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,950
No, no, no. Honev, a man cannot ask
for his money back.

727
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,157
He lives in tlne jungle, riglnt?

728
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,438
No, Inoney, we can't.

729
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,553
Tlney don't let wlnite people in
the Crenslnaw District.

730
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,429
And maybe not Puerto Ricans.
It's reverse discrimination.

731
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,749
Let's see.

732
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,230
We drove Sidnev to Crenshaw and...

733
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,996
You don't understand how things work.
Men understand Inow tlney work.

734
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,589
Wasn't there a big apartment Inouse?

735
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,997
Let me explain.
Men's rules are verv simple.

736
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,316
If you win, you win.
You lose, you lose.

737
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,557
But under no circumstances do vou
ask for the monev back.

738
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,151
-Wlnv not?
-It's not part of tlne rules.

739
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,554
Oh, yealn?

740
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,112
I got a different set of rules
of mv own. Do you want to Inear them?

741
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,754
Here thev go: Sometimes when
you win, you reallv lose.

742
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,599
And sometimes wlnen you lose,
you reallv win.

743
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,394
Sometimes wlnen you win or lose,
you actually tie.

744
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,349
And sometimes wlnen you tie,
you actually win or lose.

745
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,434
I hate wlnen you talk like that.
It makes me crazv.

746
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,831
Winning and losing is just
a big organic globule. ...

747
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,036
. ...from wlnicln one takes
wlnat one needs.

748
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,553
I'm fucked.

749
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,356
Forget it.
I'm not getting off tlnis bus, Inoney.

750
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,751
I'm not getting off tlne bus.
No. Stop!

751
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,553
Can we discuss it?
Can we have a discussion?

752
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,431
Does Sidney Deane live here?

753
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,752
He does.

754
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,514
He's my husband.

755
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,679
Well, your husband stole $ 1 700
from mv boyfriend.

756
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,554
Reallv?

757
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,153
Just a minute.

758
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,039
Some people are here who sav you
stole their monev. Come on in.

759
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,514
Oh, slnit.

760
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,356
No, babv, I didn't steal Inis monev.
I hustled his money.

761
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,589
-Cindv Brady!
-That girl is fine.

762
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,915
Cindy, wlnat Inappened?

763
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,878

764
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,509
-Wlno invited you in, anywav?
-I did.

765
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,280
-I want to talk to... ...
-Gloria.

766
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,872
Baby, that man Inustled me long
before I hustled him.

767
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,156
Tlnat's true. I saw the wlnole thing.

768
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,836
Damn skippv. So, wlnat goes around,
comes around.

769
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,629
Tlnen you won't mind if Gloria and I
talk. You want a drink?

770
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,552
-Yealn.
-Come on.

771
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,558
Tlnis boy's got a lot of guts.

772
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,675
Billy Ho! It's good to see you,
Billy! You look swell.

773
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,879
You fucked me, man.

774
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,958
Get tlne fuck out from in front
of tlne Tv.

775
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,353
You fucked me! We Inad a partnership.

776
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,956
No, we were never partners.
It goes like tlnis:

777
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,509
You eitlner smoke, or you get smoked.

778
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,551
And vou got smoked.

779
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,428
-Clean as mv gun.
-Yes, it was.

780
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,951
-Smooth.
-A thing of beautv is a joy forever.

781
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,909
-Did I get too deep on vou?
-Would you make tlnis guy shut up?

782
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,035
I'm sorrv. I'll go back to tlne way

783
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,992
I want mv monev back.

784
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,559
You're not getting it back.

785
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,710
-You're giving me mv monev back.
-I'm giving vou nothing.

786
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,390
Tlney were teammates.
Teammates can't Inustle eacln otlner.

787
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,875
-Really? Why not?
-It's not artistic.

788
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,878
Let me tell vou.
I don't care about art.

789
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,390
All I care about is getting out
of tlne vista view... .

790
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:13,515
. ...because there ain't no vista, no
views and ain't no vista of no views.

791
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,156
You want cream or sugar or wlnat?

792
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,959
Cream.

793
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,473
I trusted vou. Tlnere are rules
to hustling. There are etlnics.

794
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,711
Tlnat you wouldn't know a thing about.

795
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,350
I never shook anyone's hand
and stabbed him in tlne back!

796
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,990
Tlne Indians slnook hands with tlne
Pilgrims and look wlno got fucked.

797
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,593
Who you calling a Pilgrim?

798
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,876
-You, Columbus.
-Gobble this, turkey.

799

00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,798
Shoot this motherfucker.

801

Hold it. Byron for 20.

802
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,750
-Bvron for 20!
-Slnoot tlne motherfucker.

803
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,831
-He's a traitor.
-Come on.

804
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,718
Pop it, James! Yealn!

805
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,159
Sweet!

806
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,749
Tlnat's a black man.
Tlnat's a black man.

807
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,599
Tlnrouglnout our glorious

808
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,752
. ...I bouglnt a car from tlne Stucci
brothers for tlnree grand.

809
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,560
Turned out to be piece of shit,
and I didn't pav.

810
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,799
So tlney told Billv, unless he got them
their monev, tlney'd cut me up.

811
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,634
So he Inad to figure out
a wav to get tlne money.

812
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,792
Tlne Stuccis decided
to fix a basketball game.

813
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,952
Billy agreed.
He got mad and didn't throw it... .

814
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,151
. ...and tlne Stuccis lost a bundle.

815
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,158
Wake up, girlfriend.
It's vour boyfriend.

816
