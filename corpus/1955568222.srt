1
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:58,970
Good morning, Vermont.
It's the day before Christmas,

2
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:01,281
and the big guy's right around
the corner. We're looking at

3
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:04,241
some of your favorite Christmas hits
all day long, so keep it locked.

4
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:26,363
Morning, pops.

5
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:28,365
Hey.

6
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:31,302
The doctor said that if you
get out and about more,

7
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:32,904
you'd get your strength back.

8
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:36,240
You probably wouldn't get sick as much.

9
00:01:36,273 --> 00:01:37,975
I know.

10
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:44,348
Never mind. Hey, pops, we can
always try again tomorrow.

11
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:46,684
Okay.

12
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:53,224
Oh, my gosh, last night I had
a dream about this stallion.

13
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:56,994
He was so gorgeous, dad,
you wouldn't believe it.

14
00:01:57,028 --> 00:01:58,763
Hmm. I don't know.

15
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:02,066
- Sounds like a Kelpie to me.
- What's a Kelpie?

16
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,901
Uh, you don't wanna know about Kelpies.

17
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:06,704
Yes, I do. I just asked.

18
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:10,341
- Oh, they're scary, and not for...
- Dad.

19
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:13,144
All right, but I warned you.

20
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:20,818
Kelpies were once dark,
shape-shifting spirits

21
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:24,989
that would take the secret
shape of beautiful horses.

22
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:27,492
They lived near the water,
and they were known

23
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:31,963
to be able to take the form
of both human and horse.

24
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:35,432
But the thing about Kelpies
was they had the ability

25
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:40,237
to see straight through
into your heart of hearts.

26
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:44,075
If they saw wickedness, they
would entice these strangers,

27
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:47,979
especially wicked children,
to ride upon their backs,

28
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:50,515
and then they would dive into the lakes,

29
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:53,217
and their riders were
never heard from again.

30
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:57,254
- Drowned?
- Nobody knows.

31
00:02:57,288 --> 00:02:59,957
- Eaten?
- Nobody knows.

32
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:13,971
♪ Hush now, don't be scared ♪

33
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:19,777
♪ Through this time of darkness ♪

34
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:25,149

36
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,258
Like that one, snakes?

37
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,127
Okay, okay.

38
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:51,976
Wow!
It stinks in here!

39
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:54,311
How do you even stand it?

40
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:58,282
White linens?
Seriously, this is not a Vegas parade.

41
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:00,017
Mother.

42
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:01,562
Honey, you know I hate it
when you call me that.

43
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:03,387
It makes me sound so old.

44
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:07,058
Now don't be too much trouble,
you hear me?

45
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,360
You gotta make a good first impression.

46
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:13,397
You got the new one ready?

47
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,431
Yeah.

48
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,501
He's nervous.

49
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:18,035
Come on.

50
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:24,476
Molly?

51
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:26,310
Merry Christmas, honey.

52
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:29,246
Up there, sweetheart.

53
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,315
He's beautiful.

54
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:33,818
I'm gonna ride him every day.

55
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:38,155
You look wonderful.

56
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,861
Honey, just...
Stay calm, okay?

57
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:45,162
Push your hands forward.

58
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:46,636
Keep your hands forward, sweetheart.

59
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:51,002
- I wanna get off.
- Don't pull on the rein.

60
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:52,312
The horse is just getting
used to the barn.

61
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:54,105
Would you get off that horse now?

62
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:55,916
- It'll be fine, I promise.
- No, I don't want him.

63
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,175
- Just give him some time.
- I said I don't want him!

64
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:04,882
Please, if you'll
just take the time, okay?

65
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,383
He'll be fine, I promise. Just...

66
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:08,085
This isn't what I paid for.

67
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,162
This is not what we talked about.

68
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:10,922
This is not the horse.

69
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:17,261
Don't worry about what any
of those stuffed shirts think.

70
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:19,030
You're special.

71
00:05:21,332 --> 00:05:23,568
My dad always says that being special

72
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,446
doesn't usually mean
you're better than anyone else,

73
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,372
it's just normally something
that's on the inside

74
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:31,042
that no one can really see.

75
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:34,078
So maybe we're both special, huh?

76
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:36,614
You think you're special?

77
00:05:41,586 --> 00:05:45,356
- No.
- Good.

78
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:48,092
Because I heard your dad's a cripple,

79
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,128
so what would he know
about being special?

80
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:54,165
You're just a stable girl.
Now get away from my horse.

81
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:12,450
Well, that couldn't go any worse.

82
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:18,656
I gotta get a new instructor in here.

83
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,693
Evie, I'm gonna have to have you come
in tomorrow to feed and clean stalls.

84
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:24,128
- It's Christmas, Mr. McCarron.
- I know.

85
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:26,698
My dad's caretaker is off for the
day and he's going to need me.

86
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:29,534
Evie, I'm taking a big risk
having you here.

87
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:32,670
You're underage, you can't
give me the hours I want,

88
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:35,206
but I like you,
and I know you need the money,

89
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:39,210
but if you can't come in, I'm going
to have to get somebody full-time.

90
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:42,614
No, I... I get it.
I will be here tomorrow.

91
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:49,086
- Merry Christmas, Evie.
- Merry Christmas.

92
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:59,697
That horse today...

93
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:02,266
Why can some people just be, and do,

94
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:04,001
and have whatever they want,

95
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:07,271
but the rest of us just
have to sit back and watch?

96
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:11,408
Pops, I'm home.

97
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:15,112
You just have to get out there,

98
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:17,615
go after it.

99
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,350
You know, a rich life,

100
00:07:19,383 --> 00:07:22,620
it isn't about material wealth.

101
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:25,356
It's from inside, from your spirit.

102
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:30,495
It takes a very special person

103
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:33,397
to be able to achieve
the proper balance.

104
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:40,071
Is that a super obscure way of
saying you think it's better

105
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:42,807
that I don't have a horse?

106
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,718
'Cause I gotta tell you,
I'm having a little trouble

107
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:47,211
following that logic, pop.

108
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:51,449
No, what I'm saying is,
is that whatever you think

109
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:56,353
is an advantage
isn't always what it seems.

110
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:58,623
The most prosperous people
I've ever known

111
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:00,558
don't have half your goodness.

112
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:06,498
And you are special.

113
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:09,033
I'd be lost without you.

114
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:16,273
Let's get you to bed, pop.

115
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:37,294
- Give him some time.
- I said I don't want him.

116
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:47,539
Evie, would you mind showing
everybody how it's done?

117
00:08:58,382 --> 00:08:59,684
Oh, Evie, that's amazing.

118
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:03,187
- Will you teach me?
- Sure.

119
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,099

It's Christmas.
How about a treat?

144
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,794
How about some warm bran mash?

145
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:55,700
Really?

146
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,602
Which one of you did this?

147
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,847
Hello?

148
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,284
Hello?

149
00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:59,430
Whoa! Whoa!

150
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:03,000
Hey there, boy.

151
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:05,637
Easy.

152
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,439
Easy.

153
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:10,441
What are you doing out here?

154
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:15,480
You're a pretty boy.

155
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:20,952
Where's your rider?

156
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,587
No rider?

157
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:25,957
Hello?

158
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:29,861
Is anybody out there?

159
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:31,996
Hello?

160
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:33,865
I have your horse.

161
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:38,736
And he looks kinda familiar to me.

162
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:43,475
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you back to the barn

163
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:45,510
before you freeze out here.

164
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,548
Come on.

165
00:12:52,016 --> 00:12:54,619
Come on, buddy. Come on.

166
00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,891
I don't know what you want me to do.

167
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:05,663
No. Absolutely not.

168
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:08,666
No getting on strange horses.

169
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,836
Fine, you win.
No warm barn for you.

170
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,848
I can see you.
I can see you moving.

171
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:25,817
I know you don't want me
to leave you out here.

172
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,495
No, no, wait.

173
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,531
No, no.
What are you doing?

174
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:45,703
Great.

175
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:47,905
Whoa.

176
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:51,576
I'm telling you right now,
if you throw me,

177
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:52,944
I'm going to be so mad at you.

178
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:54,779
Do you hear me, mister?

179
00:13:54,812 --> 00:13:55,813
Okay?

180
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:57,782
Whoa!

181
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:59,584
Whoa! Whoa!

182
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:02,487
Hey, slow down!

183
00:15:26,303 --> 00:15:29,206
What on earth?

184
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:35,547
Where are we?

185
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:42,253
I am going to be in so much trouble.

186
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,562
Did global warming just,
like, happen or something?

187
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,966
Did we time travel?

188
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,310
What?

189
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:09,581
Don't look at me like that.
I am not happy about this.

190
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,518
This is crazy.

191
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:31,736
Okay, there's no way this is Vermont.

192
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:47,051
It was just really annoying, you know?

193
00:16:47,084 --> 00:16:48,753
I mean, she looked right at me

194
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:51,623
and was just like,
"you think you're special?"

195
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:56,761
And I just kinda froze
and I was like, "uh..."

196
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:58,594
The whole thing caught me
off guard, you know?

197
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:02,066
Are you sure this is the right way?

198
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:07,271
Good, because my dad will freak out

199
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:08,906
if I'm not home soon.

200
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:15,913
Wait, what's that?

201
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:35,232
What is that?

202
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:57,689
Hello?

203
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:09,734
Hello?

204
00:18:15,406 --> 00:18:17,909
Is that her?

205
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:19,711
It must be.

206
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,145
She's here.
She's here.

207
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:22,714
Tell the others.

208
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:29,887
She doesn't look like much.

209
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,360
Places everyone!
Places!

210
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:55,913
Hello, Evelyn Flynn.

211
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:02,219
Who are you?
How do you know my name?

212
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:04,856
I've been waiting for you

213
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:07,792
for a very long time.

214
00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:10,962
Where am I?

215
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:13,297
You're inside the cave of revelation.

216
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,967
Everything is seen as it truly is.

217
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:19,170
Stones from this cave

218
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:22,039
were used to forge the Scepter of Truth.

219
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:27,044
You are here for a reason, Evelyn Flynn.

220
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:30,882
What's happening?

221
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:33,384
The cave is showing you something.

222
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,757
This is the World of Albion.

223
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:43,461
Albion was home to the Danaan,

224
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:46,864
a peaceful and selfless race.

225
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:50,367
The Danaan possessed
four ancient treasures

226
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:53,337
that maintained harmony
amongst their people.

227
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,975
The scepter of truth,
no one can lie in its presence.

228
00:19:58,009 --> 00:19:59,511
The cauldron of plenty,

229
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:02,379
to never know hunger.

230
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:07,018
The flame of knowledge,
the answer to all questions.

231
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:10,321
And the Book of Healing,

232
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:12,423
to heal all wounds.

233
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,897
One day, the Milesians arrived,

234
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:23,568
carried on dark clouds
from the Northern Worlds,

235
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:26,938
led by the evil and greedy
General Eeder.

236
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:33,945
They came to take the four treasures

237
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:36,881
and destroy the Danaan people.

238
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:45,122
Desperate for peace,
the Queen of the Danaans

239
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:48,325
sought out the Abbess, a magical being

240
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,495
who lives separate from either race.

241
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:53,164
She brokered a treaty bound by magic,

242
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:56,400
and it was agreed that Albion
would be divided in half.

243
00:20:56,433 --> 00:21:00,271
But in a wicked piece of trickery,

244
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:03,475
the Milesian General
chose the top half of Albion,

245
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:06,978
subjugating the Danaan
to the world underground.

246
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:10,181
But the General's obsession
with the day he would finally

247
00:21:10,214 --> 00:21:12,950
rid his world of the Danaan

248
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:16,120
has grown with every passing year.

249
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:20,925
Some believe that day
to finally be at hand.

250
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:28,032
Ah, this oughta be good.

251
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:29,366
Did she like it?

252
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,202
She hasn't said anything.

253
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:32,369
Huh.

254
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:35,640
I'm in another world?

255
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:41,345
"I'm in another world?"

256
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:44,215
There are portals between our two worlds

257
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:45,550
that are ever-changing.

258
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,619
Evie.

259
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:49,987
Dear Evie,

260
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:52,890
the Danaan people need your help.

261
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,929
Wake up.

262
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,598
Wake up.

263
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:05,002
Wake up.

264
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:07,505
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

265
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,477
I have absolutely no idea.

266
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,346
Where did you come from?

267
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:18,115
Vermont.

268
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:20,417
What land is this Vermont?

269
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:25,198
I don't really understand the question.

270
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:27,224
Why did you steal my horse?

271
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:30,793
I know you're not my horse,
I was just...

272
00:22:32,564 --> 00:22:35,633
Can you please allow me to continue
questioning the prisoner?

273
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,704
Why did you steal my horse?

274
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:42,039
Your horse?
No, I swear,

275
00:22:42,073 --> 00:22:43,340
I didn't know.

276
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:45,242
You don't need to swear.

277
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:46,944
You couldn't tell a lie
if you wanted to.

278
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:49,046
The scepter won't allow it.

279
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,982
You are not in charge of this quest.

280
00:22:51,015 --> 00:22:52,550
She could be a Milesian spy.

281
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:55,529
What do you mean you brought her here?

282
00:22:55,553 --> 00:22:59,156
Are you insane?

283
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,592
We're on a perilous mission

284
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,594
that could include death and torture.

285
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:03,353
Hey!

286
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:05,530
The last thing we need is
a frightened little girl.

287
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:07,665
- Hey!
- Would you please be quiet a moment?

288
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:10,434
No, I won't!

289
00:23:10,468 --> 00:23:11,669
Who...

290
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:14,305
Who...

291
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:15,673
Who are you?

292
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:18,009
Where are you from?
Who is this crazy horse?

293
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:20,377
And why are you acting like
you're having a conversation?

294
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:23,114
You're not a little girl, Evie.

295
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:25,182
How does everyone know my name?

296
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:26,984
- Dag Dia told me.
- Who's Dag Dia?

297
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:29,220
The Kelpie.

298
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:32,089
The horse.

299
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:36,327
No, she is not going with us.

300
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,638
I'm not going anywhere with you.

301
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:39,497
Exactly. Kindly hand me back the Scepter

302
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:42,233
and we'll be on our way.

303
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:43,501
This is the Scepter of Truth?

304
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:46,437
Really?

305
00:23:46,471 --> 00:23:48,773
A powerful priceless artifact,

306
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:51,743
and you go around announcing
that we have it to the world!

307
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,210
No, he didn't tell me.

308
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:57,148
The cave of revelation did.

309
00:23:57,181 --> 00:23:58,783
The strange man.

310
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:04,188
Really?

311
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:06,190
I've heard legends of magic in there.

312
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:11,062
Men who could turn into
horses or vice-versa.

313
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:14,532
Something like that.
Kelpies, they called them.

314
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:16,233
I never believed that, though.

315
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:17,802
Just blarney from halfwits.

316
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:19,804
Thank you.

317
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:22,574
Look, please help me.
I need to go home.

318
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:24,208
My father's not well.

319
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:26,744
- It's Christmas!
- What's Christmas?

320
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:28,212
Christmas.

321
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:30,515
You know, Santa?

322
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:32,426
Has these elves that help him
fly around the world

323
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,285
in one night delivering
presents on a sleigh

324
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:36,654
pulled by magical reindeer?

325
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:38,790
Sorry, can't help you.

326
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:41,759
I'm incredibly busy
trying to save my people

327
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:43,661
from certain annihilation.

328
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:47,398
And unfortunately, it's a bit
time sensitive, so...

329
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:50,067
No! She's not coming with us.

330
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:53,137
She's obviously mad.

331
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:02,213
Would you like to join us on our quest

332
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:04,281
that has absolutely
nothing to do with you

333
00:25:04,315 --> 00:25:06,618
and bears no consequence
on your future whatsoever,

334
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:09,487
upon which you,
as a small helpless child,

335
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:11,422
will almost certainly perish?

336
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:14,826
- No.
- Well, I tried.

337
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:17,462
- Let's go.
- Wait! How do I get home?

338
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:20,164
Fine.

339
00:25:20,197 --> 00:25:23,267
Our first mission is to find
the Flame of Knowledge,

340
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,573
which Dag Dia believes
will show you your path,

341
00:25:28,606 --> 00:25:31,676
if you would like to join us.

342
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,113
- I would.
- Perfect.

343
00:25:36,147 --> 00:25:37,849
Just to the flame, then I go home.

344
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:39,617
Ah.

345
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:45,256
Hold this.

346
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:46,791
We need to get going.

347
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:49,461
The Milesians use
the weather to track us.

348
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:52,129
Looks like rain.

349
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:19,724
We're not gonna outrun the rain.

350
00:26:19,757 --> 00:26:21,158
Here.

351
00:26:21,192 --> 00:26:22,694
Put this on.

352
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:29,233
It'll protect you.

353
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:02,667
Eremon!

354
00:27:07,438 --> 00:27:08,840
Eremon!

355
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:25,957
Again.

356
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:46,277
Oh, that's better.

357
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:55,219
What is this?

358
00:27:58,055 --> 00:28:00,525
What is this?

359
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,360
Is someone trying to assassinate me?

360
00:28:03,394 --> 00:28:04,929
Show me your hands.

361
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:06,798
All of you! Now!

362
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:08,966
Show me your hands!

363
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,935
Now! All of you!

364
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:23,815
Treachery!

365
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:25,617
Oh, terribly sorry, my lord.

366
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,018
Treachery!

367
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:28,786
It just is a flesh wound, sire.

368
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,431
You see I was giving you
your daily mutton

369
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:33,390
mutton! Mutton!
Oh, I love mutton.

370
00:28:33,424 --> 00:28:34,826
Well, of course you do.

371
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:36,427
Where's that bloody thing?

372
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,429
As I was feeding you,
I let my stupid hand

373
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:39,997
linger too long, like a fool.

374
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:42,299
- Wretched...
- And if you'd be so kind

375
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:43,901
as to return my brainless little digit,

376
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,937
I'll take a quick jaunt
down to the seamstress

377
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,639
and see if she can't sew the half-witted

378
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:50,575
little nubbin back on! Ah-ha!

379
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,746
- Hang him.
- Oh, no!

380
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,047
My lord, no!

381
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,483
No, no, no! No! Um...

382
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:00,785
Oh, thank you, my lord.
I knew you'd never...

383
00:29:00,818 --> 00:29:02,620
Skin him.

384
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:04,922
Aah! Lord, no!

385
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:08,826
No, wait! Wait! Wait!
I may want his skin on.

386
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,930
Um, throw him in a dungeon
that's really horrible.

387
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:15,467
I'll make my mind up later on.

388
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:34,452
Eremon, what are you doing here?

389
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:44,395
You sent for me, my lord.

390
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:50,935
I... ahh...
I saw something

391
00:29:50,968 --> 00:29:52,904
flash through the rain
and then it was gone.

392
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:57,374
It felt like...
It felt like, uh...

393
00:29:57,408 --> 00:30:00,778
Something I've not sensed
for a long time.

394
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:01,913
A long time.

395
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:04,782
I can't put my finger on it.

396
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:14,692
But there was a strange magic...

397
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:19,631
In the form of a girl.

398
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:23,100
Now, Eremon, I want you
to seek out this child,

399
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:25,670
find her, and destroy her.

400
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,677
I don't chase little girls.

401
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,113
Besides, what possible
threat could she hold?

402
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:40,818
Do you insult me, Eremon?

403
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:43,688
Nay, my lord.

404
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:47,725
I am too close for any complications.

405
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,561
Fail me now,

406
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:54,566
and I shall drink the marrow
from within thy bones.

407
00:30:59,904 --> 00:31:03,107
You shall have
her little heart, my lord.

408
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,676
Thank you.

409
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:09,113
So, off to the Wicklen Mountain, hmm?

410
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:11,015
My lord.

411
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:36,207
Who are those people?

412
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,943
Those are the Kukeri.
Don't worry about them.

413
00:31:38,976 --> 00:31:40,845
They must have a camp nearby.

414
00:31:40,878 --> 00:31:43,180
Okay, now I seriously need food.

415
00:31:43,214 --> 00:31:44,682
We don't have time.

416
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,718
If I'm not back five days from now...

417
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,853
What, you'll be grounded?

418
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:51,556
Well, yes, I'll become the ground.

419
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:53,725
What?

420
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:56,227
The treaty allows five Danaan
a five-day window

421
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,596
each harvest moon
to forage for provisions

422
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,765
so we don't starve.

423
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:02,534
Once the moon completes the cycle,

424
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,536
if you're a Danaan
and you're above ground,

425
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:07,038
you become the Earth.

426
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:08,640
Well, on the bright side,

427
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,875
at least I'll starve to death by then.

428
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,946
You're an odd little girl, Evie.

429
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:22,954
Can I ask you something?

430
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:24,556
If I said no, would it stop you?

431
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:26,991
Good point.

432
00:32:27,024 --> 00:32:28,626
I don't mean any offense by this,

433
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,663
but why wouldn't the Danaan
have sent, like,

434
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:33,765
an army or something to get provisions?

435
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:37,569
It's in the fine print.
No army nor leader may cross the barrier

436
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:39,704
as long as the treaty stands.

437
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:42,306
Warriors have tried and failed.

438
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,141
So now it's just you?

439
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:45,610
It's not just me.

440
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:47,144
They chose me for this mission.

441
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:50,181
I was the strongest, the most resilient,

442
00:32:50,214 --> 00:32:52,617
the most skillful of all the Danaan.

443
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:59,156
Wow, that's amazing.

444
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,925
It is.

445
00:33:02,193 --> 00:33:04,629
How do you know where we're going?

446
00:33:04,662 --> 00:33:06,102
Dag Dia knows the way to the Abbess,

447
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:10,034
and the torch will show us
the rest from there.

448
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:12,169
The Abbess.
Is she good?

449
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:14,706
I don't know.
Never met her.

450
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,183
But she was a great friend to the Danaan

451
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:20,111
in the early years after the fall.

452
00:33:20,144 --> 00:33:21,813
Some believe she's dead.

453
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,850
Dag Dia doesn't, though.

454
00:33:27,785 --> 00:33:30,555
Can others understand him, too?

455
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:39,597
It's following us.

456
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,666
I know, I know!
We're going!

457
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:48,940
No, not the hair!
Not the hair!

458
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:53,344
What are you doing here?

459
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:55,212
I'm rescuing you.
What does it look like?

460
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:58,249
I don't need rescuing.
Go home, Lir.

461
00:33:58,282 --> 00:34:00,918
You two know each other?

462
00:34:00,952 --> 00:34:03,354
Uh...

463
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:07,091
Lir's family are the protectors
of the Scepter of Truth.

464
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:10,261
Such close proximity for so long
has made Lir unable to lie,

465
00:34:10,294 --> 00:34:12,664
which mixed with a staggering vanity,

466
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:13,841
makes for a rough conversation.

467
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:15,933
I'm not vain.

468
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,111
I'm simply aware that I'm usually
the most striking individual

469
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:19,270
in any sort of company,

470
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,806
and the present is not excluded.

471
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,675
Holy wow.
Is he for real?

472
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,753
Yeah, of course I'm real.
What do you expect me to be?

473
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,344
Some sort of ghost?

474
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:29,013
Is she a halfwit?

475
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:30,848
I really don't like him.

476
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:32,016
Go home, Lir.

477
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,419
You can't just steal the Scepter

478
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:37,922
and go gallivanting
around Albion with it.

479
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:39,757
The elders are furious.

480
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:41,826
The elders won't listen.

481
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:44,295
What are we supposed to do,
sit around doing nothing?

482
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:46,831
Something's going on, Lir, I know it.

483
00:34:46,864 --> 00:34:48,199
Where are the Foragers?

484
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:49,734
Some simply got lost.

485
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:52,336
Foragers don't get lost.

486
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:54,706
What are you saying?

487
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:55,973
I don't know.

488
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:57,408
We're going to find the Abbess.

489
00:34:57,441 --> 00:35:02,213
The Abbess?
You two seek out the Sorceress?

490
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:05,082
- Are you scared?
- No.

491
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:07,919
Wait, yes.

492
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:10,154
Why the change?

493
00:35:10,187 --> 00:35:12,289
I suddenly realized
I can't let you go alone.

494
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:13,424
- No.
- Yes.

495
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,226
- No!
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

496
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:17,795
No, I can see you're upset,
but I'm coming with you.

497
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:20,331
I'd like you both to think
about how awful I feel

498
00:35:20,364 --> 00:35:24,301
about being so inappropriately
dressed for such a quest.

499
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:26,471
Stay out of my way.

500
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:27,939
Don't you say anything.

501
00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:33,945
How's the view back there,
my brave knight?

502
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:37,081
Truthfully?
This has always been your best angle.

503
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:39,083
You totally like him.

504
00:35:39,116 --> 00:35:41,018
You don't know what
you're talking about.

505
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:43,821
It's obvious.
He's really cute,

506
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:46,924
though I'm starting to think
honesty is seriously overrated.

507
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,793
You're out of your depth here, Evie.

508
00:35:48,826 --> 00:35:50,361
I no more fancy him than a baby bird

509
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:53,064
fancies a disease-ridden
tick on its neck.

510
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:54,766
Did you just call yourself a baby bird?

511
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:56,400
Enough on the subject!

512
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:57,835
That's why you're mean to him.

513
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:59,170
You're trying to flirt.

514
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:00,805
You're completely...

515
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:11,182
Tyris!

516
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,719
The foragers.

517
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:20,257
They're turning!
It's only been three days

518
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,893
and they're turning!

519
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,531
Now do you believe me?

520
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:28,900
Does this look like they just got lost?

521
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:30,935
What could have done this?

522
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:33,771
They're killing our foragers
to starve us out.

523
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:45,349
The Milesians will answer for this.

524
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:48,453
We have to leave.
We cannot be exposed at night.

525
00:36:57,094 --> 00:37:00,932
Two fled on horseback.

526
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:02,133
West.

527
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:06,070
Both female.

528
00:37:08,205 --> 00:37:10,074
Shallow hoof-prints.

529
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:16,814
That is no place for our kind.

530
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:18,783
Milesians?

531
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:23,888
Men whose deeds should
remain in the shadow.

532
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:28,460
Move!

533
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:38,102
Another cave?

534
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:44,308
Dag Dia says the passage to
the lair of the Abbess lies within,

535
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:47,044
just beneath the eyes of judgment.

536
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:49,280
The eyes of judgment?

537
00:37:49,313 --> 00:37:51,015
Seriously?

538
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:53,084
I think we'll camp inside
the mouth of the cave,

539
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,453
move forward in the morning.

540
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:56,921
Oh, thank the gods.

541
00:37:56,954 --> 00:37:58,422
Scared?

542
00:37:58,456 --> 00:38:01,092
What if a bat flew into my hair, huh?

543
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,861
Think about that for the moment.

544
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:05,973
So you used to be in charge
of protecting the Scepter?

545
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:08,933
I was. I am.

546
00:38:08,966 --> 00:38:14,171
I protected it from scratches,
from water marks, sun damage.

547
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:16,240
Sun damage?
You live underground.

548
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:19,877
There was a spider once.

549
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:37,629
If you knew all that I was capable of.

550
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:57,148
What are you doing?

551
00:38:59,316 --> 00:39:01,285
Guys.

552
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:19,937
Evie!

553
00:39:22,574 --> 00:39:24,942
Any eyes, painted or carved.

554
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:28,646
Not the slightest sign
of any sort of doorway

555
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,215
or anything man-made.

556
00:39:31,248 --> 00:39:32,650
I'm going to tear out my hair.

557
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:35,386
Please don't.
You would look hideous bald.

558
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:38,690
You have a very strange shaped head.

559
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:40,391
She's correct.

560
00:39:40,424 --> 00:39:43,628
If this indeed was the hiding
place of the Abbess,

561
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,429
seems like she's moved on.

562
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:47,565
She's left us behind.

563
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:53,037
I'm telling you, there were
no eyes painted or carved,

564
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,272
judging or otherwise.

565
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:58,275
Um, guys...

566
00:40:17,094 --> 00:40:21,032
I am Eriu of the Danaan.

567
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:23,434
I wish to pass through the portal.

568
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:28,649
Move back.
It won't work with you here.

569
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:32,109
There's no way
those were the magic words.

570
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:34,178
Maybe it needs to be
a riddle or something.

571
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:37,181
Abracadabra.

572
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,686
Alakazam!

573
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,555
Open sesame?

574
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:45,690
What? Those are really
powerful words in my world.

575
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:48,025
Mm-hmm.

576
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:53,130
As I was saying, only Danaan
can pass through the portal.

577
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:54,732
Any ideas?

578
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:56,801
He's never been inside.

579
00:40:56,834 --> 00:41:01,739
He doesn't know the ritual
or the ceremony it takes.

580
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:03,775
Ceremony?

581
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:06,143
Give me the Scepter.

582
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:08,212
Give me your hand.
Come on.

583
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:10,515
Ow!

584
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:12,450
Oh, you...
Oh, look.

585
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:23,628
Maybe it needs to be a love scene.

586
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:25,262
Maybe the wall needs proven Danaan love.

587
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:26,664
Come on here.

588
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:28,432
Maybe that's what the dream was saying.

589
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:29,643
What dream?
What are you talking about?

590
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,368
Come on, Lir.
Come on! Wake up!

591
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:33,571
I'm fine. It's just that...

592
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:40,177
- Now take his other hand in yours.
- No.

593
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:42,113
- Take his other hand in yours.
- No.

594
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:44,582
Look, whatever notion you have
of me and this featherbrain...

595
00:41:44,616 --> 00:41:46,818
Scared of the truth?

596
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:48,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

597
00:41:57,795 --> 00:42:00,698
Ooh, wow!
True love.

598
00:42:00,732 --> 00:42:02,767
I'll cut out your tongue.

599
00:42:05,402 --> 00:42:06,704
Walk.

600
00:42:06,738 --> 00:42:08,305
Thank you, Evie.

601
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,717
Couldn't have done this
without you, Evie.

602
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:10,775
You're so clever.

603
00:42:10,808 --> 00:42:12,677
I can hear you.

604
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:18,215
We have to have
weapons ready when they come.

605
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:21,653
No wedding, no king!

606
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,789
There's not going to be a wedding,

607
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:26,942
because we're going to destroy
every last one of them.

608
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:31,328
We have to have weapons
ready when they come.

609
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:32,897
Do we just knock?

610
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,566
I wouldn't.

611
00:42:36,568 --> 00:42:39,504
- Who are you?
- Hi, Dag Dia.

612
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:42,674
How do you know Dag Dia?

613
00:42:42,707 --> 00:42:44,876
Everyone knows Dag Dia, stupid.

614
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:48,813
No wedding, no king!

615
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:50,715
We're trying to find the Abbess.

616
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:53,350
Yeah, we're trying to find the Abbess.

617
00:42:53,384 --> 00:42:54,852
Can you help us?

618
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:57,755
Okay.

619
00:42:57,789 --> 00:42:59,891
They can never agree on anything.

620
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:02,760
No more yelling!
I can't concentrate!

621
00:43:02,794 --> 00:43:04,529
I have to understand this
before they come

622
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:05,939
or I won't understand it when they come.

623
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:08,566
Do you not understand this?

624
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,934
Listen to me!

625
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,269
We have to have weapons ready
when they come.

626
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:14,438
For the last time, how many are coming?

627
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:16,574
We only have so many saucers and spoons.

628
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:18,309
Saucers and spoons.
Saucers and spoons.

629
00:43:18,342 --> 00:43:19,644
Hello?

630
00:43:19,677 --> 00:43:21,613
These roguish kings
had better be handsome,

631
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:22,923
for I do not intend to wed a goblin.

632
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:24,749
There's not going to be a wedding

633
00:43:24,782 --> 00:43:27,251
because we're going to destroy
every last one of them.

634
00:43:27,284 --> 00:43:29,654
A wedding? No one said
anything about a wedding.

635
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:31,965
We only have so many saucers and spoons!

636
00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:32,724
Hello?

637
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:34,859
I think I'll have you
be the priest at my wedding.

638
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:36,828
You look priest-ish.

639
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:38,630
No wedding, no king!

640
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:40,732
No saucers, no spoons!

641
00:43:43,568 --> 00:43:44,902
They've come.

642
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:46,504
Where is my king?

643
00:43:46,538 --> 00:43:47,705
Will he not come for me?

644
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:49,273
Where is your hidden army, girl?

645
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:50,775
We're just looking for the Abbess.

646
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:53,210
What do you think?
It's nearly done.

647
00:43:53,244 --> 00:43:55,513
- Do not try and fool me.
- Nope, not yet!

648
00:43:55,547 --> 00:43:56,890
I'll send him a box of your fingers

649
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:59,383
- as proof of our might.
- Disgusting.

650
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,985
I can't figure this out.

651
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:04,255
The book says there is a truth
beyond what our eyes see.

652
00:44:04,288 --> 00:44:08,693
The truth is that one must often
surrender before one can win.

653
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:10,662
I'm sorry, I don't know either.

654
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:13,498
This book is nonsense!
Surrender in order to win?

655
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:16,233
If we followed that,
we'd all be living in dungeons.

656
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:17,935
Now from which way will they attack?

657
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:20,304
Tell me.
Tell me now!

658
00:44:20,337 --> 00:44:21,473
I don't know.

659
00:44:22,974 --> 00:44:25,009
By the gods, unhand those ladies,

660
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:27,545
you multifarious hags!

661
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:29,346
- The enemy!
- Multifarious?

662
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,940
- Another mouth.
- He must be a scholar.

663
00:44:32,584 --> 00:44:34,218
You came for me.

664
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:40,825
The milesians are coming.
We need to go now.

665
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:45,262
Please, help us!
They're going to get us!

666
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:49,333
- Please.
- It's okay.

Beautiful.

678
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:05,577
Dag Dia was right.
She didn't leave us.

679
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,748
You saved me, Evie.

680
00:46:10,782 --> 00:46:13,384
I've been in that state,
split and lost to myself,

681
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:14,852
for a great many years.

682
00:46:14,886 --> 00:46:17,421
The treasures of the Danaan
are very powerful.

683
00:46:17,455 --> 00:46:18,856
Possessing one of them for too long

684
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:20,992
will throw the power of
the others out of balance.

685
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:24,629
The legend says that taking back
the Danaan treasures

686
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:26,964
is the only way to reverse
the Magic of the Treaty

687
00:46:26,998 --> 00:46:28,700
and break the barrier.

688
00:46:28,733 --> 00:46:30,034
That is half of it.

689
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:31,903
The four treasures
must be brought together

690
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:35,006
and the two bloodlines must
agree to reverse the spell.

691
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:37,108
That will never happen.

692
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:40,578
Positivity, Lir.
Positivity.

693
00:46:40,612 --> 00:46:42,480
I'm positive.
That will never happen.

694
00:46:42,514 --> 00:46:45,783
If they don't, we will take it by force.

695
00:46:45,817 --> 00:46:48,620
Okay.

696
00:46:48,653 --> 00:46:51,656
I believe this is what you came for.

697
00:47:00,765 --> 00:47:04,669

Unless you focus, the flame
will show you what it wants.

702
00:47:21,786 --> 00:47:24,155
Focus on your pathway home.

703
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:29,727
I see a lakeside.

704
00:47:36,734 --> 00:47:37,902
It's wonderful.

705
00:47:37,935 --> 00:47:40,104
That must be your passage home.

706
00:47:51,816 --> 00:47:53,618
Look for the book.

707
00:47:56,988 --> 00:47:58,456
You look.

708
00:48:05,196 --> 00:48:08,065
I see a...

709
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:10,568
A tower?

710
00:48:10,602 --> 00:48:14,005
No, wait.
A monastery.

711
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:15,607
At the edge of the Dorillian Crag,

712
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,842
a day's journey from here.

713
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:21,212
Your grace, how did you know
that song that I sang to you?

714
00:48:24,115 --> 00:48:25,617
Strike.

715
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:28,862
They're trying to break down the wall.

716
00:48:28,886 --> 00:48:30,187
I need to find that book.

717
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:31,923
I thought you were going home.

718
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:33,501
You guys couldn't make it
three feet without me.

719
00:48:33,525 --> 00:48:35,092
I could get three feet without you.

720
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:37,795
Is anyone else following her logic?

721
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:40,598
Strike!

722
00:48:40,632 --> 00:48:42,066
Strike!

723
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:43,968
One of my strides is like three of hers,

724
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:45,546
- so in the end...
- Quick! You must go!

725
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:46,847
The milesians are nearly through.

726
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:49,173
- Go!
- What about you?

727
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:50,842
I'll be fine. Please go,

728
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,744
and may the gods be with you.

729
00:48:57,314 --> 00:48:58,950
Strike!

730
00:49:20,905 --> 00:49:24,676
You were a fool for harboring
these rebels, Norvina.

731
00:49:26,177 --> 00:49:29,113
Those children will surely die,

732
00:49:29,146 --> 00:49:33,017
and you, you will have
led them on such a fate.

733
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:36,821
Perhaps.

734
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:38,155
Or they may just save this world

735
00:49:38,189 --> 00:49:39,924
from a fate worse than death.

All right.

752
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:24,061
This is it.

753
00:51:24,095 --> 00:51:26,330
Show you what's inside?

754
00:51:26,363 --> 00:51:27,832
The book's inside.

755
00:51:29,467 --> 00:51:32,904
Um, if there's a skeleton inside,

756
00:51:32,937 --> 00:51:34,639
I'm gonna scream.

757
00:51:42,346 --> 00:51:45,817
- Lir, a little help here.
- Sorry.

758
00:51:53,925 --> 00:51:55,059
- Oh, God.
- Uh!

759
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:56,794
That smells so bad.

760
00:52:00,364 --> 00:52:03,868
I think it's Gallgaidheal,
one of the Brothers Dunn.

761
00:52:09,173 --> 00:52:10,775
- Oh, my gosh.
- What in the...

762
00:52:12,844 --> 00:52:14,245
Oh!

763
00:52:16,213 --> 00:52:18,916
What are you doing?
This is mental.

764
00:52:35,399 --> 00:52:36,468
Aah!

765
00:52:38,836 --> 00:52:40,104
Aah!

766
00:52:46,143 --> 00:52:48,279
Why in the gods?

767
00:52:48,312 --> 00:52:50,515
What was he thinking?

768
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:52,259
Perhaps he was having one
of those flying dreams.

769
00:52:52,283 --> 00:52:54,452
I have those a lot.

770
00:52:59,557 --> 00:53:01,158
What the?

771
00:53:13,104 --> 00:53:14,539
Stop!

772
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:17,141
Stop, you undead knave!

773
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:20,111
We're not gonna hurt you.

774
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:28,319
- Aah!
- Oh, my goodness.

775
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:40,898
Get away, I said.

776
00:53:40,932 --> 00:53:42,934
Shoo!

777
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:44,902
No, I don't care if they're nice,

778
00:53:44,936 --> 00:53:46,514
they're trying to steal
something from me,

779
00:53:46,538 --> 00:53:47,572
and I won't have it.

780
00:53:49,841 --> 00:53:55,046
Of course, it belongs to me.
I bought it at...

781
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:58,349
I found it in...
I traded it for...

782
00:53:58,382 --> 00:54:00,918
Oh, God, I can't think.

783
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:04,255
I mean, it must be this "idjit" branch.

784
00:54:10,962 --> 00:54:14,098
- Now I can think.
- Where was I?

785
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:16,143
You were talking about how
you got the Book of Healing.

786
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:17,869
Oh, thank you.

787
00:54:17,902 --> 00:54:20,304
So I got the Book of Healing...

788
00:54:20,337 --> 00:54:22,373
How do you know about that?

789
00:54:22,406 --> 00:54:23,908
Did you come to steal it away?

790
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:25,943
Come to steal my power, huh?

791
00:54:25,977 --> 00:54:28,079
A Minion of General Eeder, eh?

792
00:54:28,112 --> 00:54:30,414
I can smell the stench
of a dirty stinking...

793
00:54:30,448 --> 00:54:31,549
Milesian anywhere.

794
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,017
Gallgaidheal, please.

795
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:34,385
Don't call me that.

796
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:35,487
I hate being called that.

797
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,322
Okay, what should we call you?

798
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:41,258
My friends call me Gally.

799
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:43,861
- Okay, Gally.
- But you are not my friends!

800
00:54:45,497 --> 00:54:47,231
No, they're not.

801
00:54:47,264 --> 00:54:49,033
They're book thieves.

802
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:50,635
Especially the red-headed one.

803
00:54:50,668 --> 00:54:53,871
Wait, you can understand Dag Dia?

804
00:54:53,905 --> 00:54:55,072
Of course, I can.

805
00:54:55,106 --> 00:54:57,308
How?

806
00:54:57,341 --> 00:54:59,176
How can I understand you?

807
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,378
Because you're my brother.
Because he's my brother.

808
00:55:01,412 --> 00:55:02,914
- Your brother?
- His brother?

809
00:55:02,947 --> 00:55:04,315
That's what I said.

810
00:55:04,348 --> 00:55:06,851
He's a... are you deaf?
He's my...

811
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:11,155
My brother.

812
00:55:13,157 --> 00:55:15,392
Oh, brother.

813
00:55:15,426 --> 00:55:17,462
All of these years,
I thought you were dead.

814
00:55:27,204 --> 00:55:28,540
Why is he hugging that horse?

815
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:32,686
Why didn't you come for me
sooner, brother?

816
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:37,014
I've been so horribly lonely.

817
00:55:37,048 --> 00:55:40,452
And how did you get so tall?

818
00:55:40,485 --> 00:55:43,387
Oh, I must have missed
that part during all

819
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,957
of the running away and all that.

820
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,992
Dag Dia said he was mortally wounded

821
00:55:48,025 --> 00:55:50,027
by the Milesians in the fortress.

822
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:52,163
The Abbess saved him
by turning him into a Kelpie.

823
00:55:52,196 --> 00:55:55,132
Well, fear not, brother,
much has transpired

824
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:56,267
in your absence.

825
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,135
Look around.

826
00:55:58,169 --> 00:55:59,971
I own everything...

827
00:56:00,004 --> 00:56:03,174
All the kingdoms above
and below... Mine.

828
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:04,709
So feel free to trot where you like.

829
00:56:04,742 --> 00:56:08,212
What are you talking about?

830
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:12,116
Well, if you must know,
little red-headed book thief,

831
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:14,385
I am a God.

832
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:16,020
- A God?
- A God.

833
00:56:16,053 --> 00:56:17,421
- You are not a God.
- Yes, I am.

834
00:56:17,455 --> 00:56:19,991
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

835
00:56:20,024 --> 00:56:22,026
Look, it's not
that we don't believe you.

836
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:25,129
Yes, it is.
I don't believe him.

837
00:56:25,162 --> 00:56:26,430
You are not helping.

838
00:56:26,464 --> 00:56:28,065
I have been burned to death, frozen,

839
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:30,067
I've been torn apart by wolves,

840
00:56:30,101 --> 00:56:33,505
I have fallen from a 500-foot
cliff into really pointy rocks.

841
00:56:33,538 --> 00:56:35,607
I've been drowned, struck NY lightning,

842
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,342
squashed by an extremely fat cow,

843
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,645
my eyes plucked out, my ears sawed off,

844
00:56:40,678 --> 00:56:42,547
I cut out my own heart,
split it in three

845
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,315
then juggled it for a little while.

846
00:56:44,348 --> 00:56:47,485
Cut myself directly in half
trying to find a friend,

847
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:49,086
and nothing, nothing.

848
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,488
I am invincible.

849
00:56:50,522 --> 00:56:51,989
I am inextinguishable.

850
00:56:52,023 --> 00:56:54,492
I am a God!

851
00:56:56,327 --> 00:56:58,195
It could have a tiny bit to do

852
00:56:58,229 --> 00:56:59,640
with you having the Book of Healing.

853
00:56:59,664 --> 00:57:01,633
Nonsense.

854
00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:04,035
Wait, is that why you came?

855
00:57:04,068 --> 00:57:07,304
We need the book to save the Danaan
from the milesians once and for all.

856
00:57:07,338 --> 00:57:08,740
We only have two days left,

857
00:57:08,773 --> 00:57:11,442
or else the Danaan will surely perish.

858
00:57:11,476 --> 00:57:15,379
Oh, so why didn't you
say so in the first place?

859
00:57:15,412 --> 00:57:17,549
There you are. To be honest,
I was getting tired

860
00:57:17,582 --> 00:57:20,685
of the dirty old manuscript anyway.

861
00:57:20,718 --> 00:57:23,455
Tedious reading material, if you ask me.

862
00:57:23,488 --> 00:57:25,422
Well, it was nice meeting you all.

863
00:57:25,457 --> 00:57:27,424
Brother.

864
00:57:27,459 --> 00:57:29,060
Gotta do this again soon.

865
00:57:29,093 --> 00:57:33,264
Catch up, fun times.
Best of luck to you, then.

866
00:57:35,299 --> 00:57:38,402
Lir, can you see
the Monastery from here?

867
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:40,137
No. No, I can honestly say

868
00:57:40,171 --> 00:57:41,649
that I can't see
the Monastery from here.

869
00:57:41,673 --> 00:57:44,676
- It's...
- Look.

870
00:57:44,709 --> 00:57:48,613
Gods, you call yourself a man!

871
00:57:48,646 --> 00:57:51,148
It's still bleeding.
It's the wrong book.

872
00:57:51,182 --> 00:57:52,416
Gally!

873
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:55,186
Miss you too, friend.

874
00:58:17,308 --> 00:58:18,643
Gally!

875
00:58:18,676 --> 00:58:20,277
Where did he go?

876
00:58:22,146 --> 00:58:23,581
Gally?

877
00:58:27,118 --> 00:58:29,253
Gally, I know you're out there.

878
00:58:29,286 --> 00:58:30,722
I know you're listening.

879
00:58:37,795 --> 00:58:40,698
We didn't come to steal from you.

880
00:58:40,732 --> 00:58:44,235
Your people are in great danger
and they need your help.

881
00:58:53,511 --> 00:58:55,747
We don't have time.
That crazed loony bird

882
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,316
could be getting further away
by the second.

883
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:01,753
We have to split up
to find him, catch him.

884
00:59:04,722 --> 00:59:08,192
Gally, I know
what it's like to be alone,

885
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:11,563
to feel like you have only
yourself to rely on,

886
00:59:11,596 --> 00:59:15,266
and as much as your family
wants to help, they can't.

887
00:59:17,268 --> 00:59:19,103
I felt like that most of my life.

888
00:59:21,305 --> 00:59:24,576
But these people are good.

889
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:27,244
They don't want to hurt you.

890
00:59:27,278 --> 00:59:31,348
And your brother must care
very deeply for you,

891
00:59:31,382 --> 00:59:34,285
because he brought us
all this way just hoping

892
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:35,753
that he could find you.

893
00:59:38,556 --> 00:59:42,727
You don't have to be
alone anymore, Gally!

894
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,796
You don't have to be alone.

895
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,201
Who wants to be invincible anyway?

896
00:59:50,234 --> 00:59:52,403
It sounds pretty boring to me.

897
00:59:55,439 --> 00:59:57,475
The flame will show us where he is.

898
01:00:01,245 --> 01:00:03,280
It is boring!

899
01:00:11,656 --> 01:00:13,625
It's terribly boring.

900
01:00:13,658 --> 01:00:17,495
You can't imagine.

901
01:00:17,529 --> 01:00:20,632
Have you ever been swallowed by a whale?

902
01:00:20,665 --> 01:00:23,668
I had to wait for it to poop me out.

903
01:00:23,701 --> 01:00:25,703
Spent weeks in there.

904
01:00:25,737 --> 01:00:28,640
It was uncomfortable, to say the least.

905
01:00:28,673 --> 01:00:30,942
For you and the whale, I'm sure.

906
01:00:34,546 --> 01:00:36,814
I'll make you a trade, little girl.

907
01:00:36,848 --> 01:00:39,784
You can call me Evie.

908
01:00:39,817 --> 01:00:43,488
Well, I'll make you a trade, then, Evie.

909
01:00:43,521 --> 01:00:47,391
One book of healing for one friend.

910
01:00:49,393 --> 01:00:51,963
How does that sound?

911
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:54,331
Would you be my friend?

912
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,402
How about three for the price of one?

913
01:00:58,435 --> 01:00:59,971
I'll even throw in a brother.

914
01:01:02,373 --> 01:01:03,641
A brother.

915
01:01:07,845 --> 01:01:09,547
Here.

916
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:15,419
Huh.

917
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:17,889
Wow.

918
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:28,533
Should we heal the skinny
cowardly one then?

919
01:01:42,547 --> 01:01:44,048
What's up?

920
01:01:44,081 --> 01:01:47,552
The book might cure him
of his honesty problem.

921
01:01:47,585 --> 01:01:49,787
Isn't that a good thing?

922
01:01:49,821 --> 01:01:53,591
I can't lie, he has
somewhat grown on me.

923
01:01:55,527 --> 01:01:58,896
- Like a boyfriend?
- Like a fungus.

924
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:01,599
But like a fungus I'm not quite sure

925
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:03,868
I want to be cured of just yet.

926
01:02:08,606 --> 01:02:10,675
And now we will cure you, my brother.

927
01:02:13,478 --> 01:02:15,379
Don't mind us.
We were just enjoying

928
01:02:15,412 --> 01:02:16,981
your delightful little scene.

929
01:02:17,014 --> 01:02:18,282
The milesians!

930
01:02:23,688 --> 01:02:25,590
Run, Eriu! Now!

931
01:02:25,623 --> 01:02:26,724
Go!

932
01:02:30,962 --> 01:02:32,997
Let her go.

933
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,032
We have all we came for.

934
01:02:45,643 --> 01:02:48,946
These relics share the Danaan symbol.

935
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,849
This day has proved far more
fruitful than possibly imagined.

936
01:02:55,052 --> 01:02:57,354
And who are you, little girl?

937
01:02:57,388 --> 01:02:59,624
My name's Evelyn.

938
01:02:59,657 --> 01:03:00,858
People call me Evie.

939
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:02,794
And what mission are you on, Evelyn?

940
01:03:02,827 --> 01:03:04,562
I'm just trying to go home, sir.

941
01:03:04,596 --> 01:03:06,731
Are you indeed?

942
01:03:06,764 --> 01:03:08,866
And where is home, sweetheart?

943
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,102
Cedar creek, Vermont.

944
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:14,105
I know of no such land.

945
01:03:14,138 --> 01:03:15,673
I didn't think you would.

946
01:03:19,977 --> 01:03:21,546
Bind them.

947
01:03:56,047 --> 01:04:00,084
Tell me, Evelyn, why help the Danaan

948
01:04:00,117 --> 01:04:02,687
when their fight is not yours?

949
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,823
The Danaan are forced by a tyrant

950
01:04:05,857 --> 01:04:07,034
to leave everything they love behind

951
01:04:07,058 --> 01:04:08,760
and go live underground.

952
01:04:08,793 --> 01:04:09,970
They only want their homes back

953
01:04:09,994 --> 01:04:13,097
and to live in peace.

954
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,867
To me, that sounds like a
cause worth fighting for.

955
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,169
That's only their side of the story.

956
01:04:18,202 --> 01:04:19,804
Is their another side?

957
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:23,140
No.

958
01:04:23,174 --> 01:04:25,677
Why do you help the Milesians?

959
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:29,747
- I am Milesian.
- So?

960
01:04:32,016 --> 01:04:33,751
I've never been asked that before.

961
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:41,759
No wonder General Eeder
finds you so interesting.

962
01:04:41,793 --> 01:04:45,497
I thought you were
supposed to kill the girl.

963
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:49,133
What happened to bringing
the general her little heart?

964
01:04:49,166 --> 01:04:52,069
Do not involve yourself in my affairs

965
01:04:52,103 --> 01:04:54,672
if you wish to survive the night.

966
01:05:01,746 --> 01:05:03,781
I had a daughter once.

967
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:07,184
Would have been about your age.

968
01:05:07,218 --> 01:05:09,253
Your spirit reminds me of hers.

969
01:05:09,286 --> 01:05:12,089
Once?

970
01:05:12,123 --> 01:05:15,560
The great war took her from me.

971
01:05:15,593 --> 01:05:16,694
Her and her mother.

972
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:18,129
They were killed by Danaan?

973
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:22,967
They were killed by men.
The type doesn't matter.

974
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:28,072
Men destroy everything, Evie.

975
01:05:28,105 --> 01:05:31,008
I've never seen an exception.

976
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:35,146
That is why I give no man my love

977
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:36,648
or my hatred.

978
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:42,119
And in my indifference,

979
01:05:42,153 --> 01:05:43,921
they give me their gold.

980
01:05:46,558 --> 01:05:48,638
I believe you're a better man
than you pretend to be.

981
01:05:51,863 --> 01:05:53,731
Is that right?

982
01:05:53,765 --> 01:05:56,167
And what possibly makes you think that?

983
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,837
You act bad, but...

984
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:05,109
I know there's good in you.

985
01:06:05,142 --> 01:06:06,554
Which side do you think your daughter

986
01:06:06,578 --> 01:06:09,013
would have fought for if she were me?

987
01:06:18,022 --> 01:06:22,059
There was nothing good about me ever.

988
01:06:22,093 --> 01:06:23,094
Nothing.

989
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:28,199
I've done things that
your innocent little mind

990
01:06:28,232 --> 01:06:30,635
couldn't even imagine.

991
01:06:30,668 --> 01:06:34,205
I am the reason children
are afraid of the dark.

992
01:06:35,707 --> 01:06:38,309
I am a jackal that preys
upon the wounded.

993
01:06:38,342 --> 01:06:41,012
I love not. I feel not.

994
01:06:41,045 --> 01:06:44,682
I care not.

995
01:06:44,716 --> 01:06:48,019
If you're looking for a savior,

996
01:06:48,052 --> 01:06:53,024
be prepared to be
very disappointed in me.

997
01:06:57,662 --> 01:07:00,264
Now, I know that
you can hear my thoughts,

998
01:07:00,297 --> 01:07:02,299
and I do not know why,

999
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:05,803
but I promise you, I will root it out,

1000
01:07:05,837 --> 01:07:08,205
make no mistake, little girl,

1001
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:10,341
even if it costs you your life.

1002
01:07:12,076 --> 01:07:13,945
I don't believe you.

1003
01:07:17,849 --> 01:07:20,151
Eriu, I knew you'd come.
I knew it!

1004
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:22,053
Dag Dia is waiting for you
in the forest.

1005
01:07:22,086 --> 01:07:25,089
Go. Run.

1006
01:07:26,758 --> 01:07:27,892
Come on!

1007
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:34,098
Evelyn!

1008
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:37,201
Eriu!

1009
01:07:40,437 --> 01:07:42,239
I told you.

1010
01:07:42,273 --> 01:07:45,710
I told you, Evelyn...
Nothing.

1011
01:07:48,012 --> 01:07:51,015
- No.
- Nothing.

1012
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:08,966
Eriu!

1013
01:08:54,045 --> 01:08:56,147
Dag Dia?

1014
01:09:22,106 --> 01:09:25,176
Seems it's just us left.

1015
01:09:25,209 --> 01:09:28,446
Sorry you woke up alone.

1016
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,983
I just... I needed a moment to think.

1017
01:09:38,255 --> 01:09:40,124
Dag Dia?

1018
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,996
Damian is my birth name,

1019
01:09:45,029 --> 01:09:46,864
but I do prefer Dag Dia.

1020
01:09:53,404 --> 01:09:54,906
I don't know how to tell you this,

1021
01:09:54,939 --> 01:09:58,242
but back at the camp, Eriu...

1022
01:09:58,275 --> 01:10:00,778
She was not harmed.

1023
01:10:00,812 --> 01:10:03,981
She was carrying the Book of Healing.

1024
01:10:07,151 --> 01:10:09,887
I'm afraid her plan was quite reckless.

1025
01:10:13,925 --> 01:10:15,927
I'm so sorry for all
you've had to endure

1026
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,796
since I brought you here, Evie.

1027
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:21,298
Why did you bring me here?

1028
01:10:21,332 --> 01:10:23,334
There are so many
other people from my world

1029
01:10:23,367 --> 01:10:26,237
who could have helped you so much more.

1030
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:27,438
It had to be you.

1031
01:10:27,472 --> 01:10:29,507
But that's ridiculous, why?

1032
01:10:32,076 --> 01:10:36,380
I'm in enough trouble as it is
for bringing you here.

1033
01:10:36,413 --> 01:10:38,483
I should let her explain.

1034
01:10:38,516 --> 01:10:40,585
Her who?
Who are you talking about?

1035
01:10:40,618 --> 01:10:42,119
The Queen.

1036
01:10:42,153 --> 01:10:44,188
Eriu sent her a message.

1037
01:10:44,221 --> 01:10:47,058
The Queen? I'm supposed
to meet a Queen?

1038
01:10:47,091 --> 01:10:49,426
Okay, this has got to stop.

1039
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:50,895
Eriu is most likely on her way

1040
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:52,429
to a Milesian dungeon because of me.

1041
01:10:52,464 --> 01:10:55,166
Eriu sacrificed herself
so you could be here.

1042
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,134
Bad move!
Stupid move!

1043
01:10:57,168 --> 01:10:58,603
I am not the person you stand by.

1044
01:10:58,636 --> 01:11:00,838
I'm the one you walk past
without noticing.

1045
01:11:00,872 --> 01:11:02,239
I'm a nobody from nowhere.

1046
01:11:02,273 --> 01:11:04,008
Why can't you understand that?

1047
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:07,278
He doesn't understand that
because he carried you

1048
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:09,146
from this world as an infant,

1049
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:11,816
and he knows exactly where you're from.

1050
01:11:14,619 --> 01:11:17,321
Your majesty.

1051
01:11:17,354 --> 01:11:20,257
We'll deal with you later, Damian.

1052
01:11:24,629 --> 01:11:25,897
Why are you mad at Dag Dia?

1053
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:27,565
You shouldn't be here, Evelyn.

1054
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:33,905
I know.

1055
01:11:36,508 --> 01:11:39,010
You've grown into such a lovely girl.

1056
01:11:41,446 --> 01:11:44,348
I have to admit,
I'm a bit nervous seeing you.

1057
01:11:49,053 --> 01:11:51,523
Why would you be nervous
about meeting me?

1058
01:11:55,192 --> 01:11:57,562
Mothers always wish their daughters

1059
01:11:57,595 --> 01:12:00,097
to think kindly of them.

1060
01:12:06,403 --> 01:12:10,074
I thought, perhaps,
I might never see you again.

1061
01:12:12,209 --> 01:12:14,378
You must have a lot of questions.

1062
01:12:19,383 --> 01:12:23,420
In the heart of a great war,

1063
01:12:23,455 --> 01:12:25,389
a Milesian warrior fell in love

1064
01:12:25,422 --> 01:12:28,225
with a Danaan Princess.

1065
01:12:28,259 --> 01:12:31,428
They were married in secret
by the Abbess,

1066
01:12:31,463 --> 01:12:35,132
and soon the Princess was with child.

1067
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:37,702
The Warrior and the Princess

1068
01:12:37,735 --> 01:12:41,473
intended to expose their love,

1069
01:12:41,506 --> 01:12:46,443
but then the war took a terrible turn,

1070
01:12:46,478 --> 01:12:48,179
separating the two.

1071
01:12:50,247 --> 01:12:53,417
After the tragic loss of her father...

1072
01:12:56,253 --> 01:12:59,924
The Princess suddenly became Queen.

1073
01:13:01,726 --> 01:13:06,598
And the welfare of an
entire race now fell to her.

1074
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:14,071
The Queen knew that the infant
held had a powerful secret,

1075
01:13:14,105 --> 01:13:18,476
and many would seek to destroy her,

1076
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:23,715
so she called upon the Abbess
to send her far away from harm,

1077
01:13:23,748 --> 01:13:28,352
safe in the arms of her father.

1078
01:13:31,756 --> 01:13:34,425
My father is a Milesian?

1079
01:13:34,459 --> 01:13:37,194
Your father was wounded and had to flee

1080
01:13:37,228 --> 01:13:39,263
from the vengeance of his own people.

1081
01:13:44,469 --> 01:13:46,303
I miss him very much.

1082
01:13:49,707 --> 01:13:54,245
That child has finally
returned to Albion,

1083
01:13:54,278 --> 01:13:57,114
and sadly,

1084
01:13:57,148 --> 01:14:00,452
she has not been met with the welcome

1085
01:14:00,485 --> 01:14:04,021
her mother dreamed
she would one day receive.

1086
01:14:08,192 --> 01:14:10,227
Do you ever miss me?

1087
01:14:13,698 --> 01:14:17,368
A day has not passed

1088
01:14:17,401 --> 01:14:19,771
that I have not yearned for you.

1089
01:14:22,139 --> 01:14:27,111
Giving you up was
the worst moment of my life.

1090
01:14:33,184 --> 01:14:35,186
You chose to leave me.

1091
01:14:37,789 --> 01:14:40,592
That's even worse than
thinking you were dead.

1092
01:14:42,126 --> 01:14:44,228
I do not blame you for your anger.

1093
01:14:44,261 --> 01:14:48,265
Good, because it was really hard

1094
01:14:48,299 --> 01:14:50,401
not having a mom.

1095
01:14:50,434 --> 01:14:52,436
I mean, dad tried, but...

1096
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:54,371
Evelyn.

1097
01:14:54,405 --> 01:14:56,674
Evie.

1098
01:14:56,708 --> 01:15:00,077
Evie, I'm truly sorry.

1099
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:07,118
Why does Dag Dia think I can help you?

1100
01:15:07,151 --> 01:15:10,221
In order to lift the spell
of the barrier,

1101
01:15:10,254 --> 01:15:14,859
all four Danaan treasures
must be reunited,

1102
01:15:14,892 --> 01:15:19,764
and then both bloodlines
must agree to end the treaty.

1103
01:15:19,797 --> 01:15:24,536
That's me, isn't it?
I have those bloodlines.

1104
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:27,238
I can do this without
the Milesians agreeing.

1105
01:15:31,408 --> 01:15:33,645
Even if I am who you say I am,
that doesn't mean I have

1106
01:15:33,678 --> 01:15:35,513
what it takes to storm
the Milesian fortress.

1107
01:15:35,547 --> 01:15:36,814
You will do no such thing.

1108
01:15:36,848 --> 01:15:39,817
That's right, I am just a stable girl.

1109
01:15:39,851 --> 01:15:45,222
Evie, Eriu and the others
speak of a girl

1110
01:15:45,256 --> 01:15:50,161
who is as generous as she is brave,

1111
01:15:50,194 --> 01:15:53,531
as clever as she is honest.

1112
01:15:53,565 --> 01:15:56,133
It takes a very special person

1113
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:58,435
to achieve that kind of balance.

1114
01:16:00,672 --> 01:16:02,540
My father said that to me.

1115
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:07,745
Can I try something?

1116
01:16:20,658 --> 01:16:23,294
I just wanted to see
what this would feel like.

1117
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:29,567
Mom, I'm scared.

1118
01:16:32,937 --> 01:16:36,273
♪ Hush now ♪

1119
01:16:36,307 --> 01:16:38,476
♪ Don't be scared ♪

1120
01:16:39,944 --> 01:16:45,617
♪ Through this time of darkness ♪

1121
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:50,922
It was you.

1122
01:16:50,955 --> 01:16:52,824
I remember.

1123
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:57,495
It's an ancient Albion song.

1124
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:02,399
My mother sang it to me
when I was frightened.

1125
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,735
Stop it! Stop it!

1126
01:17:46,377 --> 01:17:47,912
Well, well.

1127
01:17:47,945 --> 01:17:52,617
Which of these Danaan morsels

1128
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:55,953
am I going to eat first, hmm?

1129
01:18:00,725 --> 01:18:03,861
My journey proved
quite successful, my lord.

1130
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,903
Eremon, for this,

1131
01:18:11,936 --> 01:18:14,371
you shall have your own kingdom.

1132
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,408
Not as big as mine, of course.

1133
01:18:17,441 --> 01:18:19,611
Probably a lot smaller, but even so.

1134
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:28,520
I can feel their energy
pulsing through the roof

1135
01:18:28,553 --> 01:18:33,057
as their spirits are reunited together.

1136
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:37,495
Fools!
I shall crush them!

1137
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:38,863
I fear nothing.

1138
01:18:38,896 --> 01:18:42,534
Nothing! Not even
the tiny little mice

1139
01:18:42,567 --> 01:18:43,901
who come to me at night

1140
01:18:43,935 --> 01:18:46,403
with their nasty little sharp claws

1141
01:18:46,437 --> 01:18:48,706
trying to touch my...

1142
01:18:54,446 --> 01:18:55,889
This is the truth-telling thing, huh?

1143
01:18:55,913 --> 01:18:57,849
The scepter of truth, yes.

1144
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:04,689
Right. Mount the treasures!

1145
01:19:04,722 --> 01:19:07,091
Not the cauldron!

1146
01:19:07,124 --> 01:19:09,426
You want me to starve to death?

1147
01:19:09,461 --> 01:19:10,538
Mount them up there on the wall

1148
01:19:10,562 --> 01:19:13,430
where I can gaze on them

1149
01:19:13,465 --> 01:19:16,000
as their makers are swept aside

1150
01:19:16,033 --> 01:19:19,737
like brownie insects.

1151
01:19:19,771 --> 01:19:22,339
The Danaan are a peaceful
people, you disgusting toad.

1152
01:19:22,373 --> 01:19:24,609
Have you no honor?

1153
01:19:24,642 --> 01:19:27,912
I would like her beaten,
please, and then killed.

1154
01:19:27,945 --> 01:19:29,847
Of course, my lord.

1155
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:33,718
And when she's quite dead,
beat her again.

1156
01:19:33,751 --> 01:19:36,387
We will be merciless, my lord.

1157
01:19:38,823 --> 01:19:40,792
I volunteer to be beaten in her place.

1158
01:19:40,825 --> 01:19:43,528
- Be quiet, Lir.
- I will not.

1159
01:19:43,561 --> 01:19:45,396
Look at this beautiful face.

1160
01:19:45,429 --> 01:19:48,432
That's not the face of a man
who deserves to be beaten.

1161
01:19:48,466 --> 01:19:50,902
I can't imagine looking at your face.

1162
01:19:50,935 --> 01:19:52,646
The least you can do
is have a few good swings

1163
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,507
at this masterpiece
that stands before you.

1164
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:59,010
Why waste your time beating this imp?

1165
01:19:59,043 --> 01:20:00,912
Do you really think I look like them?

1166
01:20:00,945 --> 01:20:04,415
No, I just lied.
It felt exhilarating.

1167
01:20:06,751 --> 01:20:07,785
Kill him.

1168
01:20:07,819 --> 01:20:10,021
Kill him. Kill. Kill.

1169
01:20:13,758 --> 01:20:15,927
How dare you talk about
our General like that?

1170
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,896
- Are you mad?
- Yes, I am mad.

1171
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:22,767
Madly in love with
my all powerful master.

1172
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,836
I curse the day I was born Danaan.

1173
01:20:24,869 --> 01:20:28,740
I used to dream at night
that I was Milesian.

1174
01:20:28,773 --> 01:20:29,950
I have to admit, I used to draw

1175
01:20:29,974 --> 01:20:31,943
the Milesian symbol on my chest

1176
01:20:31,976 --> 01:20:33,478
and pretend I was one of you.

1177
01:20:33,511 --> 01:20:35,480
I like the way you look.

1178
01:20:35,513 --> 01:20:38,149
I like the way you smell.

1179
01:20:38,182 --> 01:20:40,752
I even like the way you eat.

1180
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:44,689
I humble myself before you,
most gracious lord.

1181
01:20:44,722 --> 01:20:48,693
Use your great powers to strip
away this Danaan husk

1182
01:20:48,726 --> 01:20:50,695
and I'll serve you till the day I die.

1183
01:20:50,728 --> 01:20:55,533
I like this one.
Give him a nice new tunic.

1184
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:58,069
He dared to call me merciless.

1185
01:20:58,102 --> 01:21:00,872
Now the other two,
throw them in the Dungeon,

1186
01:21:00,905 --> 01:21:03,808
a public beating in the morning,
followed by disembowelment.

1187
01:21:03,841 --> 01:21:05,810
I want a nice crowd.

1188
01:21:05,843 --> 01:21:08,480
And a band.
A brass band.

1189
01:21:08,513 --> 01:21:10,047
Let's have some fun, shall we?

1190
01:21:13,217 --> 01:21:15,453
Eremon.

1191
01:21:22,527 --> 01:21:23,995
Yes, my lord?

1192
01:21:24,028 --> 01:21:27,665
Did you dispose
of my little premonition?

1193
01:21:27,699 --> 01:21:30,167
Not yet, my lord, but soon.

1194
01:21:30,201 --> 01:21:35,640
A little girl can escape
my greatest warrior?

1195
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:37,775
She has not escaped me.

1196
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:40,678
I do not like riddles, Eremon.

1197
01:21:40,712 --> 01:21:43,548
We have her friends upon the knife.

1198
01:21:43,581 --> 01:21:45,683
She will come to us, my lord.

1199
01:21:45,717 --> 01:21:47,719
Oh! So she's a fool.

1200
01:21:47,752 --> 01:21:51,489
- Far worse.
- Suicidal?

1201
01:21:51,523 --> 01:21:53,090
Worse still.

1202
01:21:53,124 --> 01:21:57,529
She's brave, selfless,

1203
01:21:57,562 --> 01:22:01,098
with a disastrous faith,

1204
01:22:01,132 --> 01:22:04,902
and tonight it shall be her undoing.

1205
01:22:04,936 --> 01:22:07,905
So be it.

1206
01:22:07,939 --> 01:22:10,074
My lord.

1207
01:22:13,077 --> 01:22:17,649
In our darkest hour,
we are truly blessed

1208
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:19,917
to have you as our champion.

1209
01:22:42,139 --> 01:22:45,009
The tunnel.

1210
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:48,245
Can you look in on my dad
every once in a while?

1211
01:22:48,279 --> 01:22:50,615
Make sure he's not too sad?

1212
01:22:59,256 --> 01:23:03,628
There's a secret underground passageway,

1213
01:23:03,661 --> 01:23:05,229
the same that Damian and gallgaidheal

1214
01:23:05,262 --> 01:23:07,832
used all those years ago.

1215
01:23:18,009 --> 01:23:20,678
We're turning.

1216
01:23:20,712 --> 01:23:22,647
We only have a few hours left.

1217
01:23:55,947 --> 01:24:01,653
If we are to perish here tonight,

1218
01:24:01,686 --> 01:24:06,390
I think I must share
my feelings with you openly.

1219
01:24:06,423 --> 01:24:08,125
I don't know that even now is...

1220
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:11,863
Hush, my Scarlet beauty.

1221
01:24:14,265 --> 01:24:17,001
Though you are not as fair as I.

1222
01:24:17,034 --> 01:24:18,670
Just being honest here.

1223
01:24:18,703 --> 01:24:21,238
Can we pass this part swiftly?

1224
01:24:21,272 --> 01:24:23,741
Of course. Where was I?

1225
01:24:23,775 --> 01:24:25,342
"Though you are not as fair as I."

1226
01:24:25,376 --> 01:24:28,112
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

1227
01:24:30,114 --> 01:24:31,415
Though you're not as fair as...

1228
01:24:31,449 --> 01:24:34,351
- You know that part.
- Yeah.

1229
01:24:34,385 --> 01:24:40,124
You have always possessed

1230
01:24:40,157 --> 01:24:44,796
a singularity that I have found

1231
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,864
quite intoxicating.

1232
01:24:46,898 --> 01:24:50,067
You're not like any woman that I know.

1233
01:24:50,101 --> 01:24:55,072
You do not Fawn after me
or send me gifts

1234
01:24:55,106 --> 01:24:57,408
or write me poems describing my...

1235
01:25:02,046 --> 01:25:06,718
In short, you make me want to be

1236
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:09,153
different than I am...

1237
01:25:11,388 --> 01:25:16,160
So that you might favor me.

1238
01:25:18,329 --> 01:25:21,398
You don't have to be different, Lir.

1239
01:25:21,432 --> 01:25:24,268
You might want to talk
about 95% less, though.

1240
01:25:26,337 --> 01:25:29,173
- I can try.
- Good.

1241
01:25:32,176 --> 01:25:36,013
- You guys are so cute.
- Evie! You came!

1242
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:38,349
I am excited, but Eriu was seconds away

1243
01:25:38,382 --> 01:25:40,818
- from kissing me.
- Kiss you?

1244
01:25:40,852 --> 01:25:42,987
He would like to kiss me.
You were gonna kiss me.

1245
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:44,055
Definitely leaning in...

1246
01:25:44,088 --> 01:25:45,923
Okay, guys, let's go.

1247
01:25:45,957 --> 01:25:47,258
How did you even get in here?

1248
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:48,893
Passageway.
She got your message.

1249
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:50,895
I'll explain everything later.

1250
01:25:50,928 --> 01:25:52,764
We must be quiet, like mice.

1251
01:25:54,799 --> 01:25:57,234
Much smaller mice.

1252
01:25:57,268 --> 01:25:58,936
Much smaller.

1253
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:00,805
Can we get some help in here?

1254
01:26:07,945 --> 01:26:09,013
Hey!

1255
01:26:14,351 --> 01:26:16,320
I can't believe I just did that.

1256
01:26:30,367 --> 01:26:32,136
Halt!

1257
01:26:33,905 --> 01:26:35,306
Where do you think you're going?

1258
01:26:35,339 --> 01:26:36,874
The General demanded

1259
01:26:36,908 --> 01:26:38,910
we bring this prisoner
to him immediately.

1260
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:41,145
- I'll have to confirm.
- No, don't confirm.

1261
01:26:41,178 --> 01:26:43,114
No confirming.

1262
01:26:43,147 --> 01:26:45,983
We suggest you don't confirm.

1263
01:26:46,017 --> 01:26:48,986
And why exactly would I not?

1264
01:26:51,422 --> 01:26:54,826
Well, tell him.

1265
01:26:56,894 --> 01:27:01,866
You shouldn't confirm because...

1266
01:27:01,899 --> 01:27:04,869
The General doesn't like you.

1267
01:27:04,902 --> 01:27:07,539
Ah-ha. I'll have you know

1268
01:27:07,572 --> 01:27:10,241
he spared my life just days ago.

1269
01:27:10,274 --> 01:27:16,080
Did he? Or did he just
forget to kill you?

1270
01:27:19,451 --> 01:27:23,020
He... he just hates me.

1271
01:27:23,054 --> 01:27:25,256
I don't know what I did.

1272
01:27:25,289 --> 01:27:27,258
Honest.

1273
01:27:27,291 --> 01:27:30,895
Well, perhaps he'll feel better
once he's had a bite to eat.

1274
01:27:30,928 --> 01:27:33,498
He's gonna eat this one
in a whole mouthful.

1275
01:27:33,531 --> 01:27:36,300
Okay, off we go.

1276
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,876
Hot soup.

1277
01:27:44,909 --> 01:27:47,078
You know what few people realize

1278
01:27:47,111 --> 01:27:49,246
is that once you've lived
in the rectum of a whale

1279
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,215
for a few weeks,

1280
01:27:51,248 --> 01:27:53,918
almost anything else seems interesting.

1281
01:27:53,951 --> 01:27:55,853
Look at that slug.
What's he doing?

1282
01:27:55,887 --> 01:27:56,854
What's he thinking?

1283
01:27:56,888 --> 01:27:58,456
What are his hobbies?

1284
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:01,493
My mother used to call me a little slug.

1285
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:04,395
Oh! That's a cute nickname.

1286
01:28:04,428 --> 01:28:08,866
I poisoned her.
I was only 10.

1287
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,401
I don't like nicknames either.

1288
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:18,409
Evie.

1289
01:28:21,112 --> 01:28:26,951
So, you came.
Eremon was right about you.

1290
01:28:26,984 --> 01:28:31,322
Like a moth to a huge flame.

1291
01:28:31,355 --> 01:28:35,527
Tell me, little grub, what are you?

1292
01:28:36,594 --> 01:28:39,163
Rain water.

1293
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:44,168
How strange.

1294
01:28:44,201 --> 01:28:47,872
Your essence is as familiar
to me as my own.

1295
01:28:49,707 --> 01:28:52,510
Yet you are an alien,

1296
01:28:52,544 --> 01:28:54,679
so I'll ask you again,

1297
01:28:54,712 --> 01:28:58,282
what are you, succulent little lamb?

1298
01:28:58,315 --> 01:29:01,252
I'm your granddaughter.

1299
01:29:01,285 --> 01:29:04,221
That's absurd.
Why do you tell these lies

1300
01:29:04,255 --> 01:29:06,223
when you know I could kill you for them?

1301
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:08,159
Because they're not lies.

1302
01:29:08,192 --> 01:29:09,594
Your son is my father.

1303
01:29:09,627 --> 01:29:13,531
- My son is dead.
- He's not. He's alive.

1304
01:29:13,565 --> 01:29:14,932
We've been living in Vermont.

1305
01:29:14,966 --> 01:29:16,701
Vermont?

1306
01:29:16,734 --> 01:29:18,302
I knew there was a reason

1307
01:29:18,335 --> 01:29:20,472
you could hear our thoughts,
little girl.

1308
01:29:20,505 --> 01:29:22,373
Seize them.

1309
01:29:29,714 --> 01:29:33,050
Have you had your fill of
the deeds of men, little girl?

1310
01:29:33,084 --> 01:29:34,552
You were right, actually.

1311
01:29:34,586 --> 01:29:36,220
About our tragic race?

1312
01:29:36,253 --> 01:29:38,690
About me being disappointed in you.

1313
01:29:38,723 --> 01:29:40,291
Hey, Jabba?

1314
01:29:40,324 --> 01:29:41,726
What did you call me?

1315
01:29:41,759 --> 01:29:43,227
He doesn't like nicknames.

1316
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,662
You didn't ask who my mother was.

1317
01:29:44,696 --> 01:29:50,167
I don't care what urchin
my son conspired with

1318
01:29:50,201 --> 01:29:52,169
to create you,

1319
01:29:52,203 --> 01:29:56,708
but I know she was Danaan,
because otherwise your blood

1320
01:29:56,741 --> 01:29:59,977
wouldn't feel so muddled.

1321
01:30:00,011 --> 01:30:03,314
Yes, but not just any Danaan.

1322
01:30:03,347 --> 01:30:06,217
My mother is the Queen.

1323
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,053
That's right, both bloodlines.

1324
01:30:09,086 --> 01:30:12,023
On behalf of the Milesians
and the Danaan,

1325
01:30:12,056 --> 01:30:13,591
I end the treaty.

1326
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:15,727
Your reign ends right now.

1327
01:30:24,335 --> 01:30:27,138
Did you really...
Is that it?

1328
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:31,476
Was that your best...

1329
01:30:32,777 --> 01:30:35,146
That is...
That is sweet.

1330
01:30:39,651 --> 01:30:44,522
Do you see your little world
crumbling before you?

1331
01:30:44,556 --> 01:30:47,291
Hmm? Did you not remember
that you have to have

1332
01:30:47,324 --> 01:30:51,262
possession of the treasures?

1333
01:30:51,295 --> 01:30:56,501
Did you think, little girly,
you could really walk in here

1334
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:59,504
and take over and destroy me?

1335
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:08,312
I am a General!

1336
01:31:08,345 --> 01:31:12,550
You demented mad man!
The Danaan shall be free!

1337
01:31:12,584 --> 01:31:14,586
- Eriu!
- No!

1338
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:17,789
No! No! You keep your dirty
Danaan hands off my lord.

1339
01:31:17,822 --> 01:31:19,356
He's good!
He's benevolent!

1340
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:22,660
What are you doing?
Get off me, you fool.

1341
01:31:22,694 --> 01:31:26,097
Now, little girl,

1342
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:28,500
I want you to feel what it's like

1343
01:31:28,533 --> 01:31:32,470
to be torn in half.

1344
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:43,715
The cauldron!

1345
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:46,818
Where's the cauldron?

1346
01:31:46,851 --> 01:31:48,786
What's happened to my cauldron?

1347
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:51,422
I think it's time to go, Evie.

1348
01:31:51,456 --> 01:31:52,790
Gally, you're amazing!

1349
01:31:52,824 --> 01:31:54,792
There he is! Catch him!

1350
01:31:54,826 --> 01:31:56,494
Aah!

1351
01:31:56,528 --> 01:31:58,262
Did you see that coming?

1352
01:31:58,295 --> 01:32:01,365
- No.
- Aah!

1353
01:32:01,398 --> 01:32:03,434
There! He's got it!

1354
01:32:05,402 --> 01:32:06,804
Get him!
He's got the cauldron!

1355
01:32:06,838 --> 01:32:08,773
Run, Evie!

1356
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,311
- Hot soup.
- Aah!

1357
01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:17,214
Get him, you...

1358
01:32:17,248 --> 01:32:18,583
Very hot soup.

1359
01:32:20,184 --> 01:32:23,588
Damn you!
Double crossing rat!

1360
01:32:26,423 --> 01:32:28,425
Extremely hot soup!

1361
01:32:30,762 --> 01:32:31,829
Aah!

1362
01:32:34,899 --> 01:32:37,835
Oh! My God!

1363
01:32:37,869 --> 01:32:40,605
Now that's a rescue.

1364
01:32:41,773 --> 01:32:45,276
- Evie!
- Eremon!

1365
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:50,281
Kill her, you useless rat of a man.

1366
01:32:51,916 --> 01:32:55,853
As I said, I give no man my love.

1367
01:32:59,957 --> 01:33:02,193
No! No! No!

1368
01:33:02,226 --> 01:33:04,261
No! No!

1369
01:33:04,295 --> 01:33:06,598
My daughter was kind,

1370
01:33:06,631 --> 01:33:08,533
and I believe she would
have fought gladly

1371
01:33:08,566 --> 01:33:10,802
alongside you, Evie.

1372
01:33:12,203 --> 01:33:15,439
- Now save your people.
- No! No!

1373
01:33:15,473 --> 01:33:17,909
- No! No!
- Save us all.

1374
01:33:19,944 --> 01:33:21,913
Evie!

1375
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:30,788
You are a horrible man,
and an even worse ruler.

1376
01:33:30,822 --> 01:33:32,657
You will no longer imprison the Danaan.

1377
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:37,562
I end this treaty
and release the barrier.

1378
01:33:41,599 --> 01:33:43,367
Releasing the barrier will only lead

1379
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,836
to another great war,

1380
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:48,740
one for which you will be
entirely responsible.

1381
01:33:48,773 --> 01:33:50,307
Not if people don't want to fight.

1382
01:33:50,341 --> 01:33:52,610
That's what men do.

1383
01:33:52,644 --> 01:33:54,646
They fight and die.

1384
01:33:54,679 --> 01:33:55,813
That's it!

1385
01:33:55,847 --> 01:33:58,415
And we'll start with your tribe.

1386
01:33:58,450 --> 01:33:59,884
Kill them!
Kill them now!

1387
01:33:59,917 --> 01:34:02,253
Kill them!

1388
01:34:02,286 --> 01:34:06,257
The first person who lays a
hand on her loses that hand.

1389
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:13,865
You will answer for this
with your bones, Eremon.

1390
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:16,868
Perhaps, but not today.

1391
01:34:22,807 --> 01:34:25,977
What are you doing here?

1392
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:28,913
What are you...
Oh, give me...

1393
01:34:28,946 --> 01:34:29,914
Guards! Come back!

1394
01:34:29,947 --> 01:34:33,718
Go away! Go!
Go away!

1395
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:35,553
This is my palace!

1396
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:37,922
You're not supposed to be here!

1397
01:34:37,955 --> 01:34:39,724
Guards!

1398
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:40,758
Evie!

1399
01:35:27,539 --> 01:35:32,409
We cannot begin to thank you
for what you have achieved.

1400
01:35:32,443 --> 01:35:37,381
We stand in the sun
for the first time in so long,

1401
01:35:37,414 --> 01:35:42,987
our treasures is reunited
and balanced once again.

1402
01:35:44,456 --> 01:35:46,524
And a strong chance for peace,

1403
01:35:46,558 --> 01:35:48,926
now that Eremon has taken Eeder's place

1404
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,895
on the Milesian throne.

1405
01:35:50,928 --> 01:35:53,965
We are safe.

1406
01:36:00,137 --> 01:36:01,338
For now.

1407
01:36:03,074 --> 01:36:05,477
When will I see you again?

1408
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:10,982
Very soon.

1409
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:13,050
Will I be able to find
my way back on my own?

1410
01:36:14,919 --> 01:36:18,089
Keep your eyes open.

1411
01:36:18,122 --> 01:36:22,460
When you happen upon
a strikingly beautiful

1412
01:36:22,494 --> 01:36:24,796
place in nature,

1413
01:36:24,829 --> 01:36:28,065
a place that almost stops your breath,

1414
01:36:28,099 --> 01:36:31,969
that is our two worlds touching,

1415
01:36:32,003 --> 01:36:35,573
and in that place is the way to Albion.

1416
01:36:45,116 --> 01:36:47,985
You are everything

1417
01:36:48,019 --> 01:36:51,689
I could have ever dreamed
you would become, my Evie.

1418
01:37:02,534 --> 01:37:07,004
Please send my love to your father.

1419
01:37:07,038 --> 01:37:12,376
I will always be here waiting for you.

1420
01:37:31,729 --> 01:37:32,897
Come on.

1421
01:39:15,299 --> 01:39:16,668
Evie.

1422
01:39:19,671 --> 01:39:20,838
Evie?

1423
01:39:22,674 --> 01:39:24,275
Evie, can you hear me, sweetheart?

1424
01:39:28,012 --> 01:39:30,047
Am I dead?

1425
01:39:30,081 --> 01:39:31,816
Is this Heaven?

1426
01:39:34,018 --> 01:39:36,120
Does this smell like heaven to you?

1427
01:39:36,153 --> 01:39:40,157
You gave us quite a scare, Evie.

1428
01:39:40,191 --> 01:39:42,026
We were worried sick about you.

1429
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:43,995
Where you been?

1430
01:39:44,028 --> 01:39:46,263
I ran into the woods.

1431
01:39:46,297 --> 01:39:49,901
There was a horse...
I mean, a Kelpie.

1432
01:39:49,934 --> 01:39:51,235
A what?

1433
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:00,745
Dad?

1434
01:40:05,049 --> 01:40:08,019
Oh, Evie.
Thought I'd lost you.

1435
01:40:08,052 --> 01:40:10,688
I'm so sorry I worried you.

1436
01:40:10,722 --> 01:40:13,991
It's okay.
You're safe.

1437
01:40:14,025 --> 01:40:15,727
In the end, that's all that matters.

1438
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,329
Mother sends her love.

1439
01:40:22,867 --> 01:40:26,370
Well, we have a lot
to talk about, don't we?

1440
01:40:26,403 --> 01:40:31,342
We do. You're walking.

1441
01:40:31,375 --> 01:40:34,679
Can't have courage without
a little fear, right?

1442
01:40:34,712 --> 01:40:36,648
Is she going to be all right?

1443
01:40:36,681 --> 01:40:38,249
Yes.

1444
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:41,018
Evie, I'd like you to meet
our new riding instructor.

1445
01:40:43,354 --> 01:40:45,790
