- [Vulko] Your brother?
- Half-brother.

549
00:55:39,598 --> 00:55:42,977
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.

550
00:55:43,102 --> 00:55:45,688
He lies.

551
00:55:45,771 --> 00:55:48,024
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.

552
00:55:48,107 --> 00:55:50,568
They're looking for it.

553
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:55,031
The Mother Box
our people guard is not safe.

554
00:55:55,114 --> 00:55:57,616
Go to the stronghold
of Atlantis.

555
00:55:57,742 --> 00:55:59,243
Protect the box.

556
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:01,412
The time has come.

557
00:56:03,414 --> 00:56:05,541
Take up your mother's trident.

558
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:14,133
[clatters]

559
00:56:16,552 --> 00:56:20,431
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.

560
00:56:21,223 --> 00:56:24,226
Above or below.

561
00:56:24,268 --> 00:56:26,353
[water gurgling]

562
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:53,297
[parademons screech]

563
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,091
[Steppenwolf] DeSaad.

564
00:56:55,132 --> 00:56:59,303
DeSaad! I call to thee.

565
00:57:08,145 --> 00:57:13,317
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?

566
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:16,487
[Steppenwolf]
This world is divided.

567
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,155
They are a primitive species.

568
00:57:18,322 --> 00:57:20,783
Unevolved and at war
with one another.

569
00:57:20,866 --> 00:57:23,619
Too separate to be one.

570
00:57:23,661 --> 00:57:26,163
Their free will
must be ripped from them,

571
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:28,165
like the other worlds.

572
00:57:28,249 --> 00:57:32,545
Given absolution
in one glorious belief,

573
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:34,421
to serve him.

574
00:57:35,047 --> 00:57:37,341
The Mother Boxes?

575
00:57:37,508 --> 00:57:40,469
I have found one of the three.

576
00:57:40,553 --> 00:57:43,138
The one that woke
and called to me.

577
00:57:43,222 --> 00:57:44,682
The other two still sleep,

578
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:48,894
but the parademons
feel their presence.

579
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:50,479
They fly,

580
00:57:50,563 --> 00:57:53,983
they search, they take
prisoners who carry the scent,

581
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:59,363
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.

582
00:57:59,864 --> 00:58:01,740
Yes.

583
00:58:02,867 --> 00:58:06,704
Mighty Steppenwolf,

584
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:11,458
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.

585
00:58:13,252 --> 00:58:17,840
But undone by his self-pride.

586
00:58:19,049 --> 00:58:20,509
DeSaad...

587
00:58:21,427 --> 00:58:24,388
I fall before you.

588
00:58:24,513 --> 00:58:26,390
Let me make a plea to him

589
00:58:26,473 --> 00:58:28,392
that I may come home

590
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,604
after I take this world
in his name.

591
00:58:31,729 --> 00:58:34,231
You betrayed him.

592
00:58:35,399 --> 00:58:37,026
Your own family.

593
00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:39,320
I saw my mistake.

594
00:58:39,445 --> 00:58:41,906
I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.

595
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:47,453
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

596
00:58:48,412 --> 00:58:50,539
He will hear your plea

597
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:52,958
when you pay your debt.

598
00:58:55,794 --> 00:58:58,964
The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.

599
00:58:59,965 --> 00:59:02,051
No protectors here.

600
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:05,554
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

601
00:59:05,638 --> 00:59:09,558
This world will fall,
like all the others.

602
00:59:10,434 --> 00:59:12,394
For Darkseid.

603
00:59:15,397 --> 00:59:17,733
For Darkseid.

604
00:59:38,796 --> 00:59:40,714
You know,
I paid millions of dollars

605
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:42,466
for this building's security.

606
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:44,301
[Diana] You got
your money's worth.

607
00:59:44,426 --> 00:59:46,887
Took me almost a minute
to disable it.

608
00:59:48,347 --> 00:59:49,765
Hi there.

609
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,518
A new toy?

610
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:55,562
Prototype troop carrier.

611
00:59:57,147 --> 00:59:58,607
[sighs] I once knew a man

612
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:01,276
who would have loved to fly it.

613
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,153
The best minds
at Wayne Aerospace

614
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,530
couldn't make it fly.

615
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:07,116
But you can?

616
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:08,826
I have no choice.

617
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:11,745
I need more range
and I need more cargo.

618
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,956
I think
there's an attack coming.

619
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:15,833
Not coming, Bruce.

620
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,169
It's already here.

621
01:00:19,294 --> 01:00:20,963
From what I've learned,

622
01:00:21,005 --> 01:00:23,966
they are things
from another universe.

623
01:00:24,008 --> 01:00:26,343
They serve a dark power.

624
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:28,262
An old power.

625
01:00:28,387 --> 01:00:29,680
[Bruce] What do they want?

626
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:33,851
[Diana sighs] To invade.
To conquer.

627
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:38,480
They came here once before,
long ago.

628
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:45,821
<i>A great armada
appeared in the sky,</i>

629
01:00:45,904 --> 01:00:48,407
<i>laying waste
to all who opposed it.</i>

630
01:00:48,532 --> 01:00:52,870
<i>The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.</i>

631
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:57,958
<i>A name cursed and feared
in every universe.</i>

632
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:02,171
<i>Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.</i>

633
01:01:02,212 --> 01:01:05,007
<i>The old gods, men...</i>

634
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:08,552
<i>Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea...</i>

635
01:01:10,721 --> 01:01:14,725
<i>Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement</i>

636
01:01:14,808 --> 01:01:17,352
<i>and guardians from the stars.</i>

637
01:01:17,436 --> 01:01:19,354
<i>Their histories
had taught them</i>

638
01:01:19,438 --> 01:01:21,148
<i>not to trust each other,</i>

639
01:01:21,273 --> 01:01:23,359
<i>not to hope for an alliance.</i>

640
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:25,694
<i>To fight apart.</i>

641
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:29,740

<i>A power hidden
in the infinity of space.</i>

647
01:02:22,835 --> 01:02:24,336
<i>He called forth mystics</i>

648
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:27,756
<i>who worshipped and controlled
three objects...</i>

649
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,258
<i>the Mother Boxes.</i>

650
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:30,926

Indestructible living machines,

654
01:02:38,142 --> 01:02:40,144

655

<i>To conquer, three boxes
have to synchronize</i>

656
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:46,275
<i>and join together
into The Unity.</i>

657
01:02:46,358 --> 01:02:49,486

Somebody... I don't know.

Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

1043
01:32:28,263 --> 01:32:29,890
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

1044

to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.

1045

I do very competitive
ice dancing.

1046

Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

1047

but whoever you're looking for,

1048

So, you're fast.

1053
01:33:27,906 --> 01:33:29,574
That feels
like an oversimplification.

1054
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,493
I'm putting together a team.

1055
01:33:31,618 --> 01:33:33,662
People with special abilities.

1056
01:33:33,829 --> 01:33:35,455
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

1057
01:33:35,497 --> 01:33:37,749
Stop right there. I'm in.

1058
01:33:38,834 --> 01:33:40,127
You are?

1059
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:41,294
Just like that?

1060
01:33:41,378 --> 01:33:42,671
Yeah. [hesitates]

1061
01:33:44,464 --> 01:33:47,009
I need friends.

1062
01:33:47,134 --> 01:33:50,387
Great. Great.

1063
01:33:50,512 --> 01:33:52,723
Can I keep this?

1064
01:33:52,848 --> 01:33:54,683
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

1065
01:33:54,766 --> 01:33:56,476
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.

1066
01:33:56,601 --> 01:33:58,020
I call it the Speed Force.

1067
01:33:58,145 --> 01:33:59,855
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

1068
01:33:59,938 --> 01:34:02,816
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.

1069
01:34:02,941 --> 01:34:05,402
I am a snack hole.

1070
01:34:05,527 --> 01:34:08,405
How many people are
on this special fight team?

1071
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:10,490
- Three, including you.
- Three?

1072
01:34:10,574 --> 01:34:13,327
Against what?

1073
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:14,953
I'll tell you on the plane.

1074
01:34:15,495 --> 01:34:17,289
Plane?

1075
01:34:17,414 --> 01:34:19,166
What are your superpowers again?

1076
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:21,043
I'm rich.

01:34:45,942 --> 01:34:48,904
[Diana] No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

1084
01:34:49,071 --> 01:34:50,864
[sniffs] Would you like
to have some?

1085
01:34:50,989 --> 01:34:52,407
Uh, no, thank you.

1086
01:34:53,575 --> 01:34:56,036
If you put the water in first.

1087
01:34:56,078 --> 01:34:59,498
- [Diana] Of course.
- So we don't scald the tea.

1088
01:35:02,292 --> 01:35:03,710
- Yes.
- Great.

1089
01:35:03,794 --> 01:35:06,046
No, that's probably enough tea.

1090
01:35:06,129 --> 01:35:08,423
[Diana] All right.

1091
01:35:08,548 --> 01:35:09,925
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

1092
01:35:10,092 --> 01:35:14,137
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

1093
01:35:14,262 --> 01:35:17,265
I will.
I will, definitely will.

1094
01:35:17,349 --> 01:35:19,559
Uh... What are you working on?

1095
01:35:19,643 --> 01:35:21,478
It's a gauntlet

1096
01:35:21,603 --> 01:35:25,399
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

1097
01:35:25,482 --> 01:35:27,901
- Wow.
- Here, let me show you.

1098
01:35:27,943 --> 01:35:31,154
We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.

1099
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:32,572
[Alfred chuckles]

1100
01:35:32,656 --> 01:35:34,074
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

1101
01:35:34,157 --> 01:35:35,784
a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.

1102
01:35:35,867 --> 01:35:36,910
Of course.

1103
01:35:39,704 --> 01:35:41,957
[buzzing and crackling]

1104
01:35:42,082 --> 01:35:43,667
[Alfred] Ah.

1105
01:35:43,792 --> 01:35:46,795
Ah, now, let's see how that did.

1106
01:35:46,878 --> 01:35:49,297
- [device beeps]
- Ha! Yes.

1107
01:35:49,422 --> 01:35:50,966
Not to be sneezed at.

1108
01:35:51,049 --> 01:35:53,593
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

1109
01:35:53,677 --> 01:35:55,470
It's Master Wayne's idea.

1110
01:35:55,554 --> 01:35:57,806
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?

1111
01:35:57,889 --> 01:36:00,767
- In black, of course.
- Oh.

1112
01:36:04,896 --> 01:36:06,481
[sighs]

1113
01:36:07,524 --> 01:36:10,694
- All right. Victor Stone.
- [typing]

1114
01:36:19,995 --> 01:36:21,538
[static]

1115
01:36:26,751 --> 01:36:29,212
Something is not working.

1116
01:36:29,337 --> 01:36:31,006
[Alfred] Mmm.

1117
01:36:35,051 --> 01:36:37,053
[system warbling]

1118
01:36:40,599 --> 01:36:43,059
Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.

1119
01:37:02,495 --> 01:37:03,997
[car door closes]

1120
01:37:20,597 --> 01:37:22,265
[electricity crackles]

1121
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:43,286
Why are you looking
for me, Diana?

1122
01:37:43,411 --> 01:37:44,704
You know who I am.

1123
01:37:44,788 --> 01:37:47,040
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.

1124
01:37:47,123 --> 01:37:50,377
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

1125
01:37:50,502 --> 01:37:51,711
The world does.

1126
01:37:52,796 --> 01:37:54,756
Fuck the world.

1127
01:37:56,132 --> 01:37:58,760
[Diana] You've obviously
been through a great deal.

1128
01:37:59,803 --> 01:38:02,889
I can't begin to imagine what.

1129
01:38:02,931 --> 01:38:06,560
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

1130
01:38:06,643 --> 01:38:08,478
Gifts?

1131
01:38:08,603 --> 01:38:10,772
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

1132
01:38:10,855 --> 01:38:12,607
We need you, Victor.

1133
01:38:12,732 --> 01:38:14,442
And maybe you need us.

1134
01:38:14,526 --> 01:38:16,236
I don't need anyone.

1135
01:38:18,446 --> 01:38:19,614
Not anymore.

1136
01:38:19,698 --> 01:38:22,158
I told myself the same
for a long time.

1137
01:38:28,832 --> 01:38:31,793
I lost someone I loved once.

1138
01:38:34,546 --> 01:38:39,301
I shut myself off from everyone.

1139
01:38:40,885 --> 01:38:43,805
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

1140
01:38:46,224 --> 01:38:49,811
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

1141
01:38:49,894 --> 01:38:53,857
And if you asked to meet me...

1142
01:38:53,982 --> 01:38:56,901
you're working on it, too.

1143
01:39:34,731 --> 01:39:36,983
[grunting]

1144
01:40:08,306 --> 01:40:10,517
You were right
about the metal sample

1145
01:40:10,558 --> 01:40:12,102
from the Superman ship.

1146
01:40:12,227 --> 01:40:15,689
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

1147
01:40:15,814 --> 01:40:17,399
look what happens.

1148
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,859
[computer beeps]

1149
01:40:19,943 --> 01:40:21,778
[laser whooshing]

1150
01:40:26,449 --> 01:40:28,201
3.5 million kelvin.

1151
01:40:28,243 --> 01:40:31,496
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

1152
01:40:31,621 --> 01:40:34,040
Hot, dense matter.

1153
01:40:37,127 --> 01:40:39,963
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

1154
01:40:40,088 --> 01:40:42,424
Exact words I said
to my prom date.

1155
01:40:42,507 --> 01:40:44,134
She dumped me anyway.

1156
01:40:44,259 --> 01:40:45,385
Yeah.

1157
01:40:47,762 --> 01:40:49,472
[laser shuts down]

1158
01:40:49,597 --> 01:40:50,723
Hey, Doc,

1159
01:40:50,807 --> 01:40:52,392
do you think Batman is connected

1160
01:40:52,434 --> 01:40:55,228
to the object
the CID is looking for?

1161
01:40:56,146 --> 01:40:59,399
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

1162
01:41:00,567 --> 01:41:01,776
No...

1163
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:03,945
I don't.

1164
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,899
Oh, Victor.

1165
01:41:51,701 --> 01:41:54,037
[parademon snarling]

1166
01:41:54,162 --> 01:41:55,955
- [gasps]
- [parademon screeches]

1167
01:41:56,039 --> 01:41:57,749
[both grunting]

1168
01:41:57,874 --> 01:41:59,959
[officer] All right! Let's go!

1169
01:42:01,044 --> 01:42:02,378
[female officer]
Commissioner Gordon?

1170
01:42:02,504 --> 01:42:03,546
[officer] Come on!

1171
01:42:03,671 --> 01:42:04,839
Your messages.

1172
01:42:04,964 --> 01:42:06,424
[officer 2] Hey, hey!

1173
01:42:06,549 --> 01:42:09,052
[thug grunting]

1174
01:42:09,177 --> 01:42:11,679
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

1175
01:42:11,805 --> 01:42:14,891
Half of Gotham's reality-challenged
community showed up.

1176
01:42:15,016 --> 01:42:17,185
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

1177
01:42:17,268 --> 01:42:19,270
You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.

1178
01:42:19,395 --> 01:42:21,231
What's wrong with dental school?

1179
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:27,237
"Attacked by
a flying vampire."

1180
01:42:27,362 --> 01:42:30,573
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."

1181
01:42:30,698 --> 01:42:32,367
On a possibly related note,

1182
01:42:32,450 --> 01:42:34,869
sketch of the suspect
in the abductions

1183
01:42:34,994 --> 01:42:36,496
at the lab across the harbor.

1184
01:42:36,579 --> 01:42:39,707
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like, Crispus.

1185
01:42:39,874 --> 01:42:42,460
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

1186
01:42:42,585 --> 01:42:45,463
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

1187
01:42:46,548 --> 01:42:47,632
I'll talk to him tonight.

1188
01:42:47,757 --> 01:42:49,342
How, Jim?

1189
01:42:49,467 --> 01:42:51,052
How do you think?

1190
01:42:52,804 --> 01:42:55,139
[parademons chittering]

1191
01:42:56,224 --> 01:42:59,269

[Silas yelps]

1193
01:43:09,112 --> 01:43:10,530
[scientist] Silas?

1194
01:43:10,655 --> 01:43:11,864
[Silas] Hey, hey.

1195
01:43:11,948 --> 01:43:13,408
Hey, hey!

1196
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:20,415
- [Barry] Oh, my goodness.
- [Bruce] Where's the cyborg?

1197
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:21,583
His name is Victor.

1198
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,253
We met, spoke.

1199
01:43:26,087 --> 01:43:28,089
Give him time.

1200
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,258
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

1201
01:43:30,341 --> 01:43:34,137
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

1202
01:43:34,262 --> 01:43:36,598
- [sighs] So, this is us.
- [Bruce] Yeah, this is us.

1203
01:43:36,723 --> 01:43:38,057
Oh!

1204
01:43:38,141 --> 01:43:40,935
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...

1205
01:43:41,019 --> 01:43:43,104
Oh, sorry.
[softly] That's your signal.

1206
01:43:43,229 --> 01:43:44,689
That means we have to go now.

1207
01:43:44,814 --> 01:43:48,526
- Yeah, that's what that means.
- It's so cool. [chuckles]

1208
01:44:02,206 --> 01:44:05,335
[Mother Box pulsing]

Commander Mera, I told the king

1212
01:44:47,543 --> 01:44:49,295
the perimeter guards were taken.

1213
01:44:49,379 --> 01:44:50,922
He won't send reinforcements.

1214
01:44:51,047 --> 01:44:53,633
He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.

1215
01:44:53,758 --> 01:44:58,221
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel. [sighs]

1216
01:44:58,346 --> 01:45:00,014
All right, take what men
we have left

1217
01:45:00,139 --> 01:45:01,849
and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.

1218
01:45:02,016 --> 01:45:03,559

[Mera groaning]

1228
01:46:41,783 --> 01:46:43,785
You can't escape.

1229
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,621
I'm not trying to.

1230
01:46:47,288 --> 01:46:48,790
[Mera grunts]

[portal booms]

1235
01:48:48,951 --> 01:48:51,287
[Mera] Vulko told me
you would come.

1236
01:48:51,412 --> 01:48:54,332
The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.

1237
01:48:56,918 --> 01:48:58,252
Wait.

1238
01:49:00,129 --> 01:49:01,339
Please.

1239
01:49:04,884 --> 01:49:06,302
I knew her.

1240
01:49:08,346 --> 01:49:10,640
Well, that makes one of us.

1241
01:49:10,765 --> 01:49:12,600
My parents died in the wars.

1242
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:15,895
She took me in.

1243
01:49:15,978 --> 01:49:17,647
What a saint.

1244
01:49:17,772 --> 01:49:19,899
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

1245
01:49:19,982 --> 01:49:22,735
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

1246
01:49:22,818 --> 01:49:24,570
and never gave me
another thought.

1247
01:49:24,612 --> 01:49:27,823
Your mother left you
to save your life.

1248
01:49:27,949 --> 01:49:30,660
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

1249
01:49:32,119 --> 01:49:34,330
What it cost her.

1250
01:49:35,373 --> 01:49:37,708
But you're not
a defenseless child now.

1251
01:49:39,877 --> 01:49:41,587
It would have been
her responsibility

1252
01:49:41,629 --> 01:49:44,966
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

1253
01:49:45,633 --> 01:49:46,717
Now,

1254
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,428
it's yours.

[Steppenwolf] Two boxes
found and awake.

1264
01:51:24,231 --> 01:51:27,234
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

1265
01:51:27,318 --> 01:51:30,571
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

1266
01:51:30,654 --> 01:51:33,199
Where is the third Mother Box?

1267
01:51:33,282 --> 01:51:35,701
The parademons
sense its presence

1268
01:51:35,743 --> 01:51:37,453
and search for the third.

1269
01:51:37,578 --> 01:51:38,579
They have taken prisoners

1270
01:51:38,704 --> 01:51:40,915

1271
01:51:41,749 --> 01:51:43,376
Go.

1272
01:51:43,459 --> 01:51:45,586
Interrogate the prisoners.

1273
01:51:46,253 --> 01:51:48,089
Find the third.

1274
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:51,884
They will tell me
what they know,

1275
01:51:52,927 --> 01:51:55,679
or I will rip it from them.

How many of you are there?

1280
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:42,601
Not enough.

1281
01:52:44,311 --> 01:52:46,730
[Gordon] Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.

1285
01:52:51,986 --> 01:52:53,320
Okay.

1286
01:52:53,487 --> 01:52:55,698
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

1287
01:52:55,823 --> 01:52:57,199
[The Flash] At the lab.

1288
01:52:57,324 --> 01:52:59,452
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

1289
01:52:59,535 --> 01:53:00,619
So the eight may still be alive.

1290
01:53:00,661 --> 01:53:01,662
[Victor] Nine.

1291
01:53:01,787 --> 01:53:03,664
[The Flash gasps] Oh.

1292
01:53:03,747 --> 01:53:06,500
The head of STARLABS

Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.

1294
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:15,551
So, how do we find him?

1295
01:53:15,676 --> 01:53:17,219
There must be a nest nearby.

1296
01:53:17,344 --> 01:53:21,640
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

1297
01:53:21,724 --> 01:53:23,851
No discernable pattern
I can see.

1298

The lines on the map
don't converge.

1299

On land.

1300
01:53:26,979 --> 01:53:28,397
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,

1301
01:53:28,522 --> 01:53:29,648
between the two cities.

1302
01:53:29,732 --> 01:53:30,816
These are air vents.

1303
01:53:30,941 --> 01:53:32,401
They all lead down to the tunnel

1304
01:53:32,526 --> 01:53:34,695
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

1305

The nest could be there.

1307
01:53:39,241 --> 01:53:41,202

I have something bigger.

Do you really think that...

1310
01:53:46,916 --> 01:53:50,503
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

1311
01:53:50,544 --> 01:53:53,130
Oh. That's rude.

Of absence.

Don't engage alone.

1441
02:03:26,953 --> 02:03:28,121
No!

02:03:29,289 --> 02:03:31,208
[The Flash screams]

1443
02:03:33,293 --> 02:03:34,544

02:03:39,174 --> 02:03:41,301
[chittering]

1445
02:04:13,375 --> 02:04:15,836
[Cyborg] Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.

1446
02:04:17,337 --> 02:04:19,339
Uh, do I know you?

1447
02:04:41,611 --> 02:04:42,821
[crashing]

1448
02:04:43,738 --> 02:04:44,739

[whooshes]

1450
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:51,454
What are we under, right now?

1451
02:04:52,122 --> 02:04:53,498
Gotham Harbor.

1452
02:05:04,009 --> 02:05:06,177
[orchestral music playing]

1453
02:05:19,274 --> 02:05:20,567

[grunting]

1455
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:33,496
Who is that?

1456
02:05:52,307 --> 02:05:53,934
[straining]

1457
02:05:58,772 --> 02:05:59,940
[Cyborg] Come on.

1458
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:06,363
Diana, get on!

1459
02:06:19,751 --> 02:06:20,710
[grunts]

1460
02:06:26,883 --> 02:06:28,301

[warbling]

1465
02:07:08,174 --> 02:07:09,718
What is it?

1466
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:18,893
Show me.

1467
02:07:32,365 --> 02:07:33,700
[grunts]

1468
02:07:55,055 --> 02:07:56,431
[grunts softly]

1469
02:07:58,099 --> 02:07:59,726
It is here.

1470
02:08:00,393 --> 02:08:03,521
On this world.

1471
02:08:05,106 --> 02:08:06,691
[grunting]

1472
02:08:15,325 --> 02:08:17,369

[helicopter whirring]

1475
02:08:37,263 --> 02:08:38,556
Sir, you're gonna
be in quarantine

1476
02:08:38,681 --> 02:08:40,058
for possible alien microbes.

1477
02:08:40,141 --> 02:08:41,935
U.S. government protocols
require that...

1478
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:45,063
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.

1479
02:08:49,526 --> 02:08:51,027
[Wonder Woman]
It called to him.

1480
02:08:51,152 --> 02:08:52,570
The Mother Box.

1481
02:08:52,654 --> 02:08:54,155
The one he already has.

1482
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:57,492
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

1483
02:08:57,617 --> 02:09:00,120
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

1484
02:09:00,203 --> 02:09:01,496
If he doesn't already have it.

1485
02:09:05,041 --> 02:09:06,584
He doesn't have it.

1486
02:09:09,587 --> 02:09:10,880
I do.

1487
02:09:21,307 --> 02:09:23,435
Have you finished the conquest?

1488
02:09:23,518 --> 02:09:24,769
Not yet, DeSaad.

1489
02:09:24,853 --> 02:09:27,313
Then why do you summon me?

1490
02:09:27,439 --> 02:09:28,940
I bring news.

1491
02:09:29,065 --> 02:09:32,068
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

1492
02:09:32,193 --> 02:09:37,365
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

1493
02:09:37,490 --> 02:09:39,617
The Anti-Life Equation.

1494
02:09:39,701 --> 02:09:41,786
The key to controlling all life

1495
02:09:41,828 --> 02:09:44,330
and all will
throughout the multiverse.

1496
02:09:44,414 --> 02:09:47,667
He found it hidden on a
primitive planet, but before...

1497
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:50,628
The story of the defiance
is well-known.

1498
02:09:50,753 --> 02:09:53,423
I have found
the primitive planet.

1499
02:09:53,548 --> 02:09:55,550
The world that fought back.

1500
02:09:55,675 --> 02:09:57,635
It is Earth.

1501
02:09:57,677 --> 02:09:59,929
The Anti-Life Equation is carved

1502
02:10:00,054 --> 02:10:04,100
into the surface
of this very world.

1503
02:10:04,225 --> 02:10:05,518
[snarls]

1504
02:10:07,687 --> 02:10:09,230
Are you certain?

1505
02:10:09,355 --> 02:10:10,398
I have seen it.

1506
02:10:10,523 --> 02:10:13,735
I have looked with my own eyes.

1507
02:10:13,860 --> 02:10:15,361
[speaks alien language]

1508
02:10:15,486 --> 02:10:16,488
[Steppenwolf speaks alien language]
Anti-Life.

1509
02:10:16,571 --> 02:10:18,698
[speaking alien language]

1510
02:10:23,870 --> 02:10:25,914
[growls]

1511
02:10:33,213 --> 02:10:34,923
[parademons chittering]

1512
02:10:36,549 --> 02:10:38,760
[dramatic orchestral music
playing]

1513
02:10:50,271 --> 02:10:51,981
[gasping]

1514
02:10:57,278 --> 02:10:58,947
My lord.

1515
02:11:00,406 --> 02:11:04,285
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1516
02:11:04,410 --> 02:11:08,581
[Steppenwolf] My lord, I am
but your humble servant.

1517
02:11:08,665 --> 02:11:11,543
Can it be true
that you have found it?

1518
02:11:11,626 --> 02:11:14,462
[Steppenwolf]
I have, great one.

1519
02:11:14,587 --> 02:11:17,548
The lost world is Earth.

1520
02:11:17,674 --> 02:11:21,886
Anti-Life is here.

1521
02:11:21,928 --> 02:11:25,265
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

1522
02:11:25,390 --> 02:11:28,560
synchronize The Unity, and
when this world is scorched,

1523
02:11:28,643 --> 02:11:32,021
I will come for my great prize.

1524
02:11:32,772 --> 02:11:35,942
You will come to Earth?

1525
02:11:36,025 --> 02:11:40,446
I have turned
100,000 worlds to dust

1526
02:11:40,571 --> 02:11:41,990
looking for Anti-Life.

1527
02:11:42,115 --> 02:11:45,493
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

1528
02:11:45,618 --> 02:11:48,788
I will stride across their bones

1529
02:11:48,871 --> 02:11:51,457
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.

1530
02:11:51,541 --> 02:11:54,335
And all of existence

1531
02:11:54,460 --> 02:11:57,755
shall be mine.

1532
02:11:57,839 --> 02:11:59,299
[grunts softly]

1533
02:12:01,301 --> 02:12:05,263
It shall be so, my master.

1534
02:12:09,475 --> 02:12:11,102
[Barry] So cool.

1535
02:12:11,185 --> 02:12:14,147
From the outside, it looks like
this building was abandoned.

1536
02:12:17,567 --> 02:12:19,319
It wants to fly.

1537
02:12:20,528 --> 02:12:22,530
You talk to machines?

1538
02:12:22,655 --> 02:12:24,699
[Victor] I speak
to intelligence.

1539
02:12:24,824 --> 02:12:25,992
This one's saying she can't fly

1540
02:12:26,075 --> 02:12:27,702
because of a software issue,

1541
02:12:27,827 --> 02:12:29,954
but I could fix it
with a little time.

1542
02:12:39,422 --> 02:12:41,966
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.

1543
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:44,510
I could feel
the other two boxes.

1544
02:12:44,594 --> 02:12:46,471
I know they're awake,

1545
02:12:46,554 --> 02:12:48,097
but I can't see where they are.

1546
02:12:48,222 --> 02:12:50,350
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

1547
02:12:50,475 --> 02:12:52,518
Even if we knew,

1548
02:12:52,602 --> 02:12:55,855
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

1549
02:12:57,857 --> 02:12:59,233
Maybe one.

1550
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:01,778
Hmm, Superman.

1551
02:13:01,903 --> 02:13:03,571
[Victor] As long as
the third box is asleep,

1552
02:13:03,696 --> 02:13:05,948
they can't see it,
only sense it.

1553
02:13:06,074 --> 02:13:08,326
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

1554
02:13:08,409 --> 02:13:09,827
No. That's just a strategy

1555
02:13:09,952 --> 02:13:11,913
to lose more slowly, not to win.

1556
02:13:12,038 --> 02:13:14,874
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?

1557
02:13:14,957 --> 02:13:16,042
Why don't we just destroy it?

1558
02:13:16,167 --> 02:13:18,252
Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.

1559
02:13:18,378 --> 02:13:20,296
They're an unknown form
of matter.

1560
02:13:20,421 --> 02:13:21,672
Oh, they love heat.

1561
02:13:21,714 --> 02:13:23,883
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.

1562
02:13:24,008 --> 02:13:26,677
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.

1563
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:28,012
Makes you think.

1564
02:13:28,096 --> 02:13:30,723
Where'd you find the box,
Victor?

1565
02:13:30,848 --> 02:13:32,517
Are you trying to say something?

1566
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:34,352
Oh, I'm saying it.

1567
02:13:34,435 --> 02:13:36,729
How do we know you're not
working for them?

1568
02:13:38,439 --> 02:13:40,483
It's a long story.

1569
02:13:40,608 --> 02:13:42,443
You got somewhere else to be?

1570
02:13:49,826 --> 02:13:51,285
The Nazis found the box

1571
02:13:51,411 --> 02:13:53,746
at the end
of the Second World War,

1572
02:13:53,830 --> 02:13:56,916
buried under
an Italian monastery.

1573
02:13:56,999 --> 02:13:59,335
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

1574
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:02,380
They brought it back
to the States in '44.

1575
02:14:02,422 --> 02:14:06,717
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1576
02:14:06,759 --> 02:14:08,636
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives

1577
02:14:08,761 --> 02:14:10,513
for 70 years

1578
02:14:10,638 --> 02:14:14,142
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

1579
02:14:15,435 --> 02:14:17,937
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

1580
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:19,188
between the ship...

1581
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:22,442
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1582
02:14:22,608 --> 02:14:26,279
He understood they were
both alien technologies.

1583
02:14:26,404 --> 02:14:28,448
Different civilizations,

1584
02:14:28,531 --> 02:14:31,576
similar properties.

1585
02:14:31,659 --> 02:14:35,079
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

1586
02:14:35,204 --> 02:14:38,666
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

1587
02:14:38,791 --> 02:14:40,793
And so did.

1588
02:14:42,837 --> 02:14:44,005
Then...

1589
02:14:45,965 --> 02:14:49,010
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

1590
02:14:49,135 --> 02:14:52,346
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

1591
02:14:52,472 --> 02:14:55,057
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

1592
02:14:56,726 --> 02:14:58,311
[powering up]

1593
02:15:03,274 --> 02:15:05,776
[screaming]

1594
02:15:11,032 --> 02:15:13,117
He unleashed an alien technology

1595
02:15:13,242 --> 02:15:16,037
he didn't fully understand.

1596
02:15:16,162 --> 02:15:18,831
He used that power
to keep me alive.

1597
02:15:19,916 --> 02:15:21,876
- [groans]
- [power turns off]

1598
02:15:22,335 --> 02:15:24,128
Alive...

1599
02:15:24,170 --> 02:15:26,339
but turned into this.

1600
02:15:29,008 --> 02:15:31,427
The box went back to sleep

1601
02:15:32,178 --> 02:15:34,096
and he never returned it.

1602
02:15:36,432 --> 02:15:38,851
That researcher was Silas Stone.

1603
02:15:40,436 --> 02:15:42,104
My father.

1604
02:15:45,358 --> 02:15:46,984
Wait,

1605
02:15:47,068 --> 02:15:50,363
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

1606
02:15:50,530 --> 02:15:52,865
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?

1607
02:15:53,032 --> 02:15:55,326
They're change machines.

1608
02:15:55,409 --> 02:15:58,579
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,

1609
02:15:58,704 --> 02:16:00,623
alive or dead.

1610
02:16:00,748 --> 02:16:03,167
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

1611
02:16:03,209 --> 02:16:04,961
regenerate, reinstate.

1612
02:16:05,086 --> 02:16:06,504
Reinstate?

1613
02:16:06,629 --> 02:16:08,047
[Victor] A box has the power

1614
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:10,049
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

1615
02:16:10,216 --> 02:16:12,051
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

1616
02:16:12,176 --> 02:16:13,302
can't be created or destroyed,

1617
02:16:13,427 --> 02:16:15,429
their relations just transform.

1618
02:16:15,555 --> 02:16:18,391
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

1619
02:16:18,474 --> 02:16:21,060
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

1620
02:16:21,185 --> 02:16:25,398
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

1621
02:16:27,275 --> 02:16:29,026
But a Mother Box...

1622
02:16:29,151 --> 02:16:31,529
...turns smoke
back into a house.

1623
02:16:32,405 --> 02:16:33,406
[sighs]

1624
02:16:37,368 --> 02:16:40,121
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

1625
02:16:41,289 --> 02:16:44,083
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

1626
02:16:47,086 --> 02:16:49,255
[orchestral music playing]

1627
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:12,403
[Lois] Who is it?

1628
02:17:12,987 --> 02:17:14,280
Martha.

1629
02:17:18,951 --> 02:17:20,286
Hi.

1630
02:17:22,038 --> 02:17:23,497
[softly] Hi.

1631
02:17:32,465 --> 02:17:34,050
I went to the <i>Daily Planet</i>

1632
02:17:34,175 --> 02:17:37,637
to finally pick up
Clark's things. [chuckles]

1633
02:17:39,055 --> 02:17:42,475
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

1634
02:17:45,144 --> 02:17:46,979
I lost the farm.

1635
02:17:48,314 --> 02:17:50,566
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.

1636
02:17:51,901 --> 02:17:53,277
Truth is, the house is too big

1637
02:17:53,402 --> 02:17:56,113
for me to live in
by myself anyway.

1638
02:17:56,238 --> 02:17:59,158
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

1639
02:17:59,241 --> 02:18:01,369
for as long as you need.

1640
02:18:02,328 --> 02:18:05,247
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.

1641
02:18:06,624 --> 02:18:08,918
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

1642
02:18:09,043 --> 02:18:11,003
right by the diner.

1643
02:18:11,087 --> 02:18:12,505
I'm not here for help.

1644
02:18:13,673 --> 02:18:16,175
I'm here because

1645
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:19,011
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that

1646
02:18:20,221 --> 02:18:23,307
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

1647
02:18:25,851 --> 02:18:27,144
[sighs softly]

1648
02:18:27,979 --> 02:18:29,647
I can't.

1649
02:18:36,404 --> 02:18:39,073
The whole world is mourning.

1650
02:18:39,198 --> 02:18:40,241
[sighs]

1651
02:18:40,366 --> 02:18:42,660
Grieving over a symbol.

1652
02:18:42,785 --> 02:18:47,039
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."

1653
02:18:47,957 --> 02:18:50,000
I hear what people say.

1654
02:18:50,084 --> 02:18:52,086
They talk like they knew him.

1655
02:18:53,087 --> 02:18:55,506
But they didn't know Clark.

1656
02:18:56,966 --> 02:18:59,260
And I can't stop them

1657
02:18:59,385 --> 02:19:03,764
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

1658
02:19:05,808 --> 02:19:08,227
You're the only one who knows.

1659
02:19:08,352 --> 02:19:11,063
Who feels what I do.

1660
02:19:12,106 --> 02:19:15,276
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.

1661
02:19:18,237 --> 02:19:21,741
I came all this way
because I wanted...

1662
02:19:21,824 --> 02:19:23,784
because I wanted to see you.

1663
02:19:25,036 --> 02:19:27,037
Tell you...

1664
02:19:27,079 --> 02:19:29,165
I understand.

1665
02:19:30,916 --> 02:19:32,877
I...

1666
02:19:33,002 --> 02:19:37,047
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

1667
02:19:40,676 --> 02:19:42,636
And I just miss him.

1668
02:19:43,804 --> 02:19:46,223
I miss him so much.

1669
02:19:46,307 --> 02:19:47,600
[Lois sniffles]

1670
02:19:52,772 --> 02:19:54,440
So do I, sweetheart.

1671
02:19:57,276 --> 02:19:58,778
[sighs]

1672
02:19:58,903 --> 02:20:03,783
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

1673
02:20:07,286 --> 02:20:10,164
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

1674
02:20:12,333 --> 02:20:14,710
Come back to the living.

1675
02:20:18,130 --> 02:20:19,298
[door opens]

1676
02:20:28,432 --> 02:20:30,267
[suspenseful music plays]

1677
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:57,586
The world needs you, too, Lois.

1678
02:21:01,215 --> 02:21:02,550
[Arthur] <i>The dead are dead.</i>

1679
02:21:02,675 --> 02:21:04,677
The box brought Victor back.

1680
02:21:04,802 --> 02:21:06,262
Victor wasn't dead.

1681
02:21:06,387 --> 02:21:08,180
Life is either one or zero.

1682
02:21:08,305 --> 02:21:11,267
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.

1683
02:21:11,392 --> 02:21:13,018
Can you operate this box,
Victor?

1684
02:21:13,143 --> 02:21:14,436
[Victor] Of course.

1685
02:21:14,562 --> 02:21:16,856
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

1686
02:21:16,939 --> 02:21:19,191
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.

1687
02:21:20,776 --> 02:21:22,361
- [Diana sighs]
- [Barry] Okay, but...

1688
02:21:22,528 --> 02:21:26,824
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

1689
02:21:26,866 --> 02:21:28,159
What do we have to lose?

1690
02:21:28,284 --> 02:21:30,744
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

1691
02:21:30,870 --> 02:21:32,288
As soon as it wakes up...

1692
02:21:32,413 --> 02:21:34,874
...the enemy sees it, comes,

1693
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:37,501
activates The Unity.
The end.

1694
02:21:37,585 --> 02:21:39,920
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

1695
02:21:40,045 --> 02:21:42,214
to a bunch of genocidal
aliens. That's good to know.

1696
02:21:42,339 --> 02:21:44,717
Even if Superman could return,

1697
02:21:44,884 --> 02:21:47,011
who's to say
that he could defeat them?

1698
02:21:47,094 --> 02:21:49,096
The Mother Box did.

1699
02:21:49,221 --> 02:21:51,390
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box

1700
02:21:51,515 --> 02:21:54,351
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.

1701
02:21:54,476 --> 02:21:56,395
Didn't call out to Steppenwolf.

1702
02:21:56,478 --> 02:21:58,063
None of the boxes did.
Not until...

1703
02:21:58,188 --> 02:22:00,232
Not until Superman died.

1704
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:02,693
Not until Superman died.

1705
02:22:02,818 --> 02:22:04,778
It's like they were
afraid of him?

1706
02:22:04,904 --> 02:22:07,907
[Bruce] Yes,
they were afraid of him.

1707
02:22:10,951 --> 02:22:12,745
This is the only way.

1708
02:22:14,079 --> 02:22:18,250
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

1709
02:22:34,433 --> 02:22:36,435
[Barry] Cross this one off
the bucket list.

1710
02:22:36,518 --> 02:22:40,522
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.

1711
02:22:42,191 --> 02:22:44,902
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

1712
02:22:45,653 --> 02:22:46,946
We could.

1713
02:22:54,453 --> 02:22:56,288
He was my hero.

1714
02:22:58,832 --> 02:22:59,959
All right.

1715
02:23:03,504 --> 02:23:06,757
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.

1716
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:08,008
Half-Atlantean.

1717
02:23:09,802 --> 02:23:13,013
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

1718
02:23:13,138 --> 02:23:17,268
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1719
02:23:17,351 --> 02:23:20,187
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.

1720
02:23:20,312 --> 02:23:22,481
Hate is useless.

1721
02:23:25,651 --> 02:23:26,819
Yep.

1722
02:23:28,153 --> 02:23:29,780
No, thank you.

1723
02:23:34,201 --> 02:23:35,327
You know, my father told me

1724
02:23:35,452 --> 02:23:37,371
there's a saying in Atlantis...

1725
02:23:38,831 --> 02:23:41,125
"None are taken back
from the darkness.

1726
02:23:41,208 --> 02:23:42,418
"Not without..."

1727
02:23:42,543 --> 02:23:44,044
"Not without
giving one up in return."

1728
02:23:46,296 --> 02:23:47,881
We say the same thing.

1729
02:23:50,467 --> 02:23:52,219
How about that?

1730
02:23:52,344 --> 02:23:54,388
Wonder Woman.

1731
02:23:55,514 --> 02:23:56,807
What do you think, man?

1732
02:23:56,890 --> 02:23:59,685
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?

1733
02:23:59,810 --> 02:24:02,646
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1734
02:24:04,356 --> 02:24:06,400
Every guy's a younger guy.

1735
02:24:08,193 --> 02:24:09,278
[Alfred] Jesus.

1736
02:24:09,403 --> 02:24:10,821
[steam hissing]

1737
02:24:10,863 --> 02:24:12,656
Oh, Christ.

1738
02:24:14,908 --> 02:24:17,619
- [blasting]
- Oh, bloody...

1739
02:24:18,912 --> 02:24:19,997
Any luck?

1740
02:24:20,039 --> 02:24:21,415
If by "luck" you mean

1741
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:24,334
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

1742
02:24:24,460 --> 02:24:26,670
then, no. No luck.

1743
02:24:27,421 --> 02:24:28,881
[Bruce] It's okay.

1744
02:24:28,964 --> 02:24:30,924
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

1745
02:24:31,050 --> 02:24:32,176
to the Kryptonian ship.

1746
02:24:32,301 --> 02:24:33,552
It's basically
an organic computer.

1747
02:24:33,677 --> 02:24:35,387
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.

1748
02:24:35,554 --> 02:24:38,140
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?

1749
02:24:38,265 --> 02:24:39,516
[Bruce] Something like that.

1750
02:24:39,641 --> 02:24:43,437
[Alfred] Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?

1751
02:24:44,396 --> 02:24:45,773
[Alfred sighing]

1752
02:24:49,943 --> 02:24:51,570
Master Wayne...

1753
02:24:53,447 --> 02:24:54,823
you did it!

1754
02:24:54,948 --> 02:24:58,494
You put the team together
to fight this war.

1755
02:24:58,619 --> 02:25:01,705
You've fulfilled your promise.

1756
02:25:01,789 --> 02:25:05,709
But to try to do that...
I mean...

1757
02:25:05,834 --> 02:25:08,754
your guilt's
overcome your reason.

1758
02:25:08,921 --> 02:25:11,048
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

1759
02:25:11,090 --> 02:25:14,426
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,

1760
02:25:14,551 --> 02:25:16,929
not on reason.

1761
02:25:17,054 --> 02:25:21,392
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,

1762
02:25:21,517 --> 02:25:23,644
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

1763
02:25:23,769 --> 02:25:26,730
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

1764
02:25:26,814 --> 02:25:29,358
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

1765
02:25:29,483 --> 02:25:31,276
then don't wave
the red cape at it.

1766
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:33,070
You do when it's this red cape.

1767
02:25:33,153 --> 02:25:35,447
This red cape charges back.

1768
02:25:50,087 --> 02:25:51,171
Okay.

1769
02:25:58,011 --> 02:26:00,514
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

1770
02:26:00,639 --> 02:26:02,141
Everyone's clear, including you.

1771
02:26:02,307 --> 02:26:04,977
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

1772
02:26:05,060 --> 02:26:06,979
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

1773
02:26:07,062 --> 02:26:08,021
Absolutely.

1774
02:26:11,859 --> 02:26:13,110
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.

1775
02:26:13,193 --> 02:26:15,821
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

1776
02:26:15,946 --> 02:26:17,489
If you need
more medical attention...

1777
02:26:17,573 --> 02:26:21,493
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1778
02:26:21,577 --> 02:26:22,995
- Definitely not "A."
- Okay.

1779
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:26,165
Or... "B"?

1780
02:26:27,708 --> 02:26:29,084
Let me see "A" again?

1781
02:26:34,590 --> 02:26:37,885
Right. We should get dressed.

1782
02:26:39,845 --> 02:26:41,972
I'm always dressed.

1783
02:26:43,557 --> 02:26:45,726
[dramatic music playing]

1784
02:27:09,124 --> 02:27:10,209
[soldier] ID?

1785
02:27:10,334 --> 02:27:11,627
ID.

1786
02:27:14,588 --> 02:27:15,881
Aye, aye.

1787
02:27:18,133 --> 02:27:19,509
[softly] "Aye, aye"?

1788
02:27:21,762 --> 02:27:23,555
[system buzzes]

1789
02:27:26,725 --> 02:27:28,518
[electrical whirring]

1790
02:27:42,533 --> 02:27:43,784
[soldier] Okay.

1791

02:27:53,168 --> 02:27:54,086
Doc!

1793
02:27:54,169 --> 02:27:55,629
They let you out of quarantine.

1794
02:27:55,754 --> 02:27:57,172
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

1795
02:27:57,297 --> 02:27:59,424
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

1796
02:27:59,550 --> 02:28:00,842
with the electron-laser.

1797
02:28:00,968 --> 02:28:03,095
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

1798
02:28:16,483 --> 02:28:17,943
[Batman grunts softly]

1799
02:28:18,068 --> 02:28:21,029
Victor, clear this place out.

1800
02:28:21,154 --> 02:28:22,489
Done.

1801
02:28:22,614 --> 02:28:23,907

- [Ryan] Bio red five.

1806
02:28:34,835 --> 02:28:37,212
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

1807
02:28:37,337 --> 02:28:40,257
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

1808
02:28:40,340 --> 02:28:41,591
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1809
02:28:41,717 --> 02:28:43,760
All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.

1810
02:28:43,802 --> 02:28:45,178
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, Doc.

1811
02:28:45,304 --> 02:28:46,638
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1812

- Let's go, Doc.
- Think about it.

1813

[woman] Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!

1814
02:28:49,308 --> 02:28:51,393

Move! Come on! Go, go!

1820
02:29:07,576 --> 02:29:09,161
Everybody out! Go!

1821
02:29:29,348 --> 02:29:32,142
- [system beeps]
- Yes! Gotcha!

1822
02:29:32,267 --> 02:29:35,062
Post Commander, this is
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

1823
02:29:35,187 --> 02:29:37,564
- [man] <i>Go ahead, Dr. Stone.</i>
- This is a false alarm.

1824
02:29:37,689 --> 02:29:40,484
Someone has hacked into
the system. We must alert...

1825
02:29:40,525 --> 02:29:41,902
[door opens]

1826
02:29:50,452 --> 02:29:51,953
Victor.

1827
02:29:53,413 --> 02:29:55,916
[man] <i>Dr. Stone, you there?
I don't copy.</i>

1828
02:29:56,750 --> 02:29:57,834
I was mistaken.

1829
02:29:57,918 --> 02:29:59,127
The alarm's legit.

1830
02:29:59,252 --> 02:30:00,921
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,

1831
02:30:01,046 --> 02:30:03,840
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.

1832

[man] <i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1833

[officer 1]
Get the civilians out!

1834
02:30:17,187 --> 02:30:18,355
[officer 2] Let's go! Let's go!

1835
02:30:22,734 --> 02:30:23,902
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.

1836
02:30:24,027 --> 02:30:25,195
- Everybody?
- Yes.

1837

1840
02:31:10,365 --> 02:31:13,118
It knows he's here.

1841

[exhales heavily]
Ooh, that's intense.

1842
02:31:19,791 --> 02:31:21,918
This is amazing.

1843
02:31:22,627 --> 02:31:23,795
This is crazy.

1844
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:25,839
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1845
02:31:25,964 --> 02:31:28,425
You two lunatics

I'm in.

1856
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:15,967
The ship says
the Mother Box is hostile.

1857
02:34:16,134 --> 02:34:17,677
I can override
the security protocols,

1858
02:34:17,802 --> 02:34:19,512
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

1859
02:34:19,638 --> 02:34:21,014
that Luthor's
power surges caused

1860

English.

1862
02:34:23,475 --> 02:34:25,977
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

1863
02:34:26,102 --> 02:34:28,146
[inhales sharply]
I might be able to do it.

1864
02:34:30,273 --> 02:34:32,233
I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.

1865
02:34:32,359 --> 02:34:33,610
I don't like to break this rule,

1866
02:34:33,693 --> 02:34:35,487
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...

1867
02:34:35,570 --> 02:34:37,155
Look, crazy things
happen to time,

1868
02:34:37,322 --> 02:34:39,824
but if I do it, I create
massive electrical power.

1869
02:34:39,908 --> 02:34:41,701
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

1870
02:34:41,826 --> 02:34:44,162
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.

1871
02:34:44,329 --> 02:34:46,998
I might be able to wake
the box, if that's...

1872
02:34:47,123 --> 02:34:48,792
still what we want?

1873
02:34:48,875 --> 02:34:50,377
It is. Do it.

02:43:33,232 --> 02:43:34,483
Tell me who you...

1965
02:43:34,567 --> 02:43:36,235
- [grunts]
- [Wonder Woman yelps]

1966
02:43:37,195 --> 02:43:39,030

1973
02:45:09,453 --> 02:45:12,623
Let's go! [screams]

[breathes shakily]

1975

[Cyborg grunts]

1976
02:45:19,630 --> 02:45:21,090
You should probably move.

1977
02:45:21,173 --> 02:45:23,259
[officers shouting indistinctly]

1978
02:45:24,593 --> 02:45:25,761
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1979
02:45:25,845 --> 02:45:28,639
Get up.
Take cover back there. Go.

1980

[both grunt]

1986
02:46:20,608 --> 02:46:22,818
Please don't make me do this.

[grunts]

1988
02:46:30,409 --> 02:46:32,161

- [groans]

1991
02:46:55,393 --> 02:46:56,727
Clark.

1992
02:46:57,603 --> 02:46:58,896
Clark, no.

1993
02:47:00,523 --> 02:47:01,899
[grunts]

1994
02:47:03,609 --> 02:47:05,069
[groaning]

1995
02:47:10,408 --> 02:47:11,617
Clark.

1996
02:47:11,742 --> 02:47:13,577
No.

1997
02:47:13,744 --> 02:47:15,454
This world needs you.

1998
02:47:20,709 --> 02:47:22,044
[Lois] Clark.

1999
02:47:22,169 --> 02:47:23,254
Clark.

2000
02:47:23,337 --> 02:47:25,423
Whoa! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

2001
02:47:25,548 --> 02:47:26,882
[Lois panting]

2002
02:47:26,924 --> 02:47:28,217

[soft music playing]

2004
02:47:31,595 --> 02:47:33,055
Please.

[panting]

2007
02:48:07,298 --> 02:48:08,340
Please.

2008
02:48:13,679 --> 02:48:15,306
[Lois breathing shakily]

2009
02:48:19,518 --> 02:48:20,811
Please.

2010
02:48:21,479 --> 02:48:23,606
Just go.

2011
02:48:23,689 --> 02:48:24,857
Yeah.

2012
02:48:25,566 --> 02:48:26,984
Let's go.

2013
02:48:28,819 --> 02:48:30,321
[Clark inhales deeply]

[breathes heavily]

2017
02:48:59,517 --> 02:49:01,685
I'm so sorry.

[indistinct shouting]

2020
02:49:10,903 --> 02:49:11,987
[man] Take cover!

2021
02:49:12,029 --> 02:49:14,657
- He's coming.
- The Mother Box.

2022
02:49:14,698 --> 02:49:15,950
Where is it?

2023
02:49:26,502 --> 02:49:27,837
Come on.

2024
02:49:28,587 --> 02:49:30,422
Come on.

2025
02:49:30,548 --> 02:49:32,591
- [Steppenwolf grunts]
- [people screaming]

[Steppenwolf growling]

2037
02:50:32,776 --> 02:50:34,403
Give me the Mother Box.

[Cyborg grunts]

2039
02:50:47,625 --> 02:50:49,126
No, no, no.

2040
02:50:51,587 --> 02:50:53,297
Dad, wait! Don't!

2041
02:51:11,065 --> 02:51:14,151
- [Steppenwolf grunts]
- [Cyborg groans]

2042
02:51:21,825 --> 02:51:24,495
[grunts, breathes heavily]

2043
02:51:28,957 --> 02:51:31,251
[electricity crackling]

2044
02:51:33,587 --> 02:51:36,507
So begins the end.

2045
02:51:38,592 --> 02:51:40,219
[portal booming]

2046
02:51:42,096 --> 02:51:43,514
[The Flash] Victor?

2047
02:51:45,808 --> 02:51:49,269
Vic... Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.

2048
02:51:55,067 --> 02:51:56,402
Victor?

2049
02:51:57,569 --> 02:51:58,946
He's dead.

2050
02:51:59,071 --> 02:52:00,197
What?

2051
02:52:01,115 --> 02:52:02,449
My father.

2052
02:52:03,867 --> 02:52:07,329
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

2053
02:52:07,413 --> 02:52:09,039
[The Flash] Oh, my God.

2054
02:52:09,957 --> 02:52:12,543
[breathes heavily]

2055
02:52:15,629 --> 02:52:17,673
His father's dead 'cause of us.

2056
02:52:17,798 --> 02:52:19,591
I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.

2057
02:52:19,717 --> 02:52:21,176
It wasn't a bad idea.

2058
02:52:21,301 --> 02:52:23,637
We needed Superman.
We still do.

2059
02:52:23,762 --> 02:52:26,223
[Aquaman] Well, whatever
returned, it isn't Superman.

2060
02:52:26,306 --> 02:52:29,560
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

2061
02:52:29,643 --> 02:52:31,186
[Batman] It is him.

2062
02:52:31,228 --> 02:52:33,731
He recognized Lois Lane.

2063
02:52:33,897 --> 02:52:36,025
- Who?
- The woman he loves.

2064
02:52:36,108 --> 02:52:38,402
- He remembers her.
- [Aquaman] Nah.

2065
02:52:38,569 --> 02:52:40,404
He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.

2066
02:52:40,487 --> 02:52:42,197
It's called instinct, Diana.

2067
02:52:47,703 --> 02:52:49,246
[Aquaman sighs]

2068
02:52:49,371 --> 02:52:51,248
[The Flash] Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?

2069
02:52:51,373 --> 02:52:53,000
[Wonder Woman]
He's gone back to his base

2070
02:52:53,125 --> 02:52:54,668
to assemble the three boxes.

2071
02:52:54,793 --> 02:52:56,253
[Aquaman] And we don't know
where his base is.

2072
02:52:56,420 --> 02:52:58,088
- Or how long until...
- [Batman] Hours.

2073
02:52:58,172 --> 02:52:59,757
The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,

2074
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:03,093
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.

2075
02:53:03,177 --> 02:53:05,387
[whispers] This is not your...

2076
02:53:05,512 --> 02:53:06,764
[gasps]

2077
02:53:07,556 --> 02:53:09,057
He knew.

2078
02:53:09,141 --> 02:53:10,684
He knew, he knew, he knew.

2079
02:53:10,809 --> 02:53:12,770
He wasn't trying
to destroy the box...

2080
02:53:12,853 --> 02:53:14,813
he was trying to superheat it.

2081
02:53:14,938 --> 02:53:16,190
He made the core
the hottest thing

2082
02:53:16,315 --> 02:53:17,441
on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.

2083
02:53:17,566 --> 02:53:18,567
Now, anything that hot
would have to...

2084
02:53:18,650 --> 02:53:19,860
[Batman]
Blink off the charts

2085
02:53:19,985 --> 02:53:22,112
on a thermal imaging system.

2086
02:53:22,279 --> 02:53:25,574
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

2087
02:53:25,657 --> 02:53:27,618
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

2088
02:53:27,743 --> 02:53:29,912
to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.

2089
02:53:30,037 --> 02:53:31,413
I'm already on it.

2090
02:53:31,497 --> 02:53:33,499
I'm sorry. [hesitates]
You have a satellite?

2091
02:53:33,624 --> 02:53:34,917
I have six.

2092
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:36,251
Right.

2093
02:53:37,669 --> 02:53:40,089
Let's go find
the son of a bitch.

2094
02:53:51,099 --> 02:53:52,643
[birds chirping]

2095
02:53:52,768 --> 02:53:54,311
[soft music playing]

2096
02:54:04,363 --> 02:54:06,615
You brought us here.

2097
02:54:06,740 --> 02:54:07,866
You remembered.

2098
02:54:08,826 --> 02:54:10,494
This is home.

2099
02:54:12,246 --> 02:54:13,622
You spoke.

2100
02:54:17,668 --> 02:54:19,545
Did I not before?

2101
02:54:53,412 --> 02:54:56,206
Your mother got behind
on the payments.

2102
02:54:57,416 --> 02:54:59,585
She never told anyone.

2103
02:55:01,128 --> 02:55:02,921
I don't understand.

2104
02:55:06,049 --> 02:55:08,552
She's a proud woman, Clark.

2105
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:12,931
Here.

2106
02:55:27,946 --> 02:55:29,615
She loved it here.

2107
02:55:36,246 --> 02:55:37,748
[birds chirping]

2108
02:55:40,292 --> 02:55:41,960
So did I.

2109
02:55:43,962 --> 02:55:45,505
So did I.

2110
02:55:50,344 --> 02:55:51,803
[Clark sighs]

2111
02:56:11,073 --> 02:56:12,324
[The Flash] Wow!

2112
02:56:12,449 --> 02:56:14,117
This is awesome.

2113
02:56:14,284 --> 02:56:15,827
[Bruce] Brought some friends.

2114
02:56:22,334 --> 02:56:24,795
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

2115
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:27,547
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

2116
02:56:27,673 --> 02:56:29,967
- Alfred.
- Good day, ma'am.

2117
02:56:31,259 --> 02:56:33,428
[Alfred] Oh...

2118
02:56:33,470 --> 02:56:34,680
[Alfred clears throat]

2119
02:56:36,390 --> 02:56:38,475
It's badass, Alfred.

2120
02:56:41,144 --> 02:56:43,689
Well, I'll put on the tea.

2121
02:56:43,814 --> 02:56:44,940
Great.

2122
02:56:45,065 --> 02:56:46,775
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

2123
02:56:49,486 --> 02:56:52,447
[Bruce] There's the
Mother Box, right there.

2124
02:56:52,489 --> 02:56:54,533
[Wonder Woman]
Go to visible spectrum.

2125
02:56:56,368 --> 02:56:58,495
[sighs] Pozharnov.

2126
02:56:58,620 --> 02:57:01,498
Ghost city not far from Moscow.

2127
02:57:01,623 --> 02:57:02,874
It's been abandoned since

2128
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:04,376
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

2129
02:57:04,501 --> 02:57:05,794
Not even the army goes in.

2130
02:57:05,877 --> 02:57:07,295
[Barry] Right, it's probably
so radioactive

2131
02:57:07,421 --> 02:57:09,464
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

2132
02:57:09,506 --> 02:57:10,924
Not anymore.

2133
02:57:11,049 --> 02:57:12,801
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

2134
02:57:12,884 --> 02:57:13,927
Zoom.

2135
02:57:14,052 --> 02:57:15,429
[keyboard clacking]

2136
02:57:17,764 --> 02:57:19,307
What the hell is he building?

2137
02:57:19,391 --> 02:57:20,851
[Cyborg] The Unity's in there.

2138
02:57:20,934 --> 02:57:22,311
We'll attack from above.

2139
02:57:22,394 --> 02:57:25,105
Explosives won't
separate the boxes,

2140
02:57:25,230 --> 02:57:26,857
only strengthen their bond.

2141
02:57:27,024 --> 02:57:28,358
[Barry] What?
So we can't blow it up?

2142
02:57:28,442 --> 02:57:29,985
[Cyborg] Not from the outside.

2143
02:57:31,486 --> 02:57:34,406
I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.

2144
02:57:34,531 --> 02:57:35,907
Fuse with it.

2145
02:57:36,033 --> 02:57:37,367
Weaken its bond from the inside

2146
02:57:37,534 --> 02:57:38,785
so we can break it back
into three.

2147
02:57:38,910 --> 02:57:40,996
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

2148
02:57:41,038 --> 02:57:44,750
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

2149
02:57:44,875 --> 02:57:47,377
These boxes together
are world destroyers.

2150
02:57:47,461 --> 02:57:48,837
A billion years old.

2151
02:57:48,920 --> 02:57:51,006
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

2152
02:57:51,131 --> 02:57:53,550
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

2153
02:57:53,633 --> 02:57:55,886
Just get me in and get me time.

2154
02:57:56,053 --> 02:57:57,179
You could die, Victor.

2155
02:57:57,262 --> 02:57:59,723
If I don't, we all die.
Period.

2156
02:58:04,311 --> 02:58:06,104
I got nothing left.

2157
02:58:11,401 --> 02:58:13,570
You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?

2158
02:58:16,490 --> 02:58:18,075
That's what I'm gonna do.

2159
02:58:18,241 --> 02:58:20,577
[Barry] Okay. So...

2160
02:58:20,702 --> 02:58:22,370
if Victor wants
to try to save the world

2161
02:58:22,412 --> 02:58:23,955
by fusing with the doom boxes,

2162
02:58:24,081 --> 02:58:26,583
I say we put him
in the doom boxes.

2163
02:58:26,666 --> 02:58:29,544
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

2164
02:58:29,586 --> 02:58:32,047
Fighting the devil and his army

2165
02:58:32,130 --> 02:58:33,382
in hell.

2166
02:58:33,507 --> 02:58:35,550
[Barry] I mean,
this guy's probably fought

2167
02:58:35,634 --> 02:58:37,886
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

2168
02:58:37,969 --> 02:58:39,638
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

2169
02:58:39,763 --> 02:58:41,390
And we have to assume he's won.

2170
02:58:41,431 --> 02:58:43,183
I don't care
how many demons he's fought

2171
02:58:43,308 --> 02:58:44,601
in how many hells...

2172
02:58:44,726 --> 02:58:48,438
he's never fought us.
Not us united.

Take that as a "yes."

2176
02:59:40,490 --> 02:59:41,950
[Lois] What?

2177
02:59:45,370 --> 02:59:46,663
The ring.

2178
02:59:50,333 --> 02:59:51,918
You're really back.

2179
03:00:25,368 --> 03:00:27,704
I have a second chance, Lo.

2180
03:00:29,748 --> 03:00:32,500
And I am not gonna waste it.

Are you really you?

2184
03:01:31,810 --> 03:01:34,229
I'm really me, Ma.

[Martha laughs]

2186
03:01:51,621 --> 03:01:53,790
Listen, Ma.

2187
03:01:55,125 --> 03:01:57,294
They wanted me back
for a reason.

2188
03:01:58,962 --> 03:02:00,755
I need to find out why.

2189

[Martha sighs]

2190
03:02:20,692 --> 03:02:22,193
How's Victor doing?

2191
03:02:26,489 --> 03:02:29,326
You know,
wanted to be by himself.

2192
03:02:30,827 --> 03:02:33,955
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

2193

2194

2195
03:02:38,793 --> 03:02:40,337
It's not fair.

2196
03:02:42,005 --> 03:02:43,840
I thought you didn't care?

2197
03:02:45,216 --> 03:02:46,801
I never said that.

Uh...

I had a dream,

2201
03:03:08,073 --> 03:03:10,659
almost like a premonition.

2202
03:03:10,784 --> 03:03:13,661
It was the end of the world

2203
03:03:13,745 --> 03:03:16,664
and Barry Allen was right here

2204
03:03:16,748 --> 03:03:20,877
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."

2205
03:03:23,421 --> 03:03:26,758
She is... to Superman.

2206

Every heart has one.

2207
03:03:29,803 --> 03:03:31,888
I think it's something more.

2208
03:03:32,597 --> 03:03:34,724
Something darker.

2209
03:03:38,687 --> 03:03:39,688
Master Wayne.

2210
03:03:39,771 --> 03:03:41,940
Master Wayne!

2211
03:03:42,065 --> 03:03:43,983

He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.

What makes you so sure?

2219
03:04:25,942 --> 03:04:28,820
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

2220
03:04:50,759 --> 03:04:52,385
At last.

2221
03:04:54,095 --> 03:04:57,015
Prepare for his arrival.

2222

2232
03:06:05,625 --> 03:06:07,043
he's created a defensive dome.

2233
03:06:07,210 --> 03:06:08,419
It's a design flaw.

2234
03:06:08,545 --> 03:06:10,713
Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.

2235
03:06:10,797 --> 03:06:13,007
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

2236
03:06:13,091 --> 03:06:14,676
[The Flash] Right, probably
'cause he didn't think

2237
03:06:14,759 --> 03:06:16,886
anyone would be that nuts.

2238
03:06:17,720 --> 03:06:19,013
Bruce is right.

2239
03:06:19,055 --> 03:06:20,557
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome

2240
03:06:20,723 --> 03:06:23,184
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

2241

What if the dome's
not destroyed?

2242

he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.

how's that again?

to generate
a charge of that size.

2252
03:06:44,080 --> 03:06:46,249
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

2253
03:06:46,332 --> 03:06:49,210
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

2254
03:06:49,335 --> 03:06:51,296
And, Victor, it's all up to you.

2255

before it synchronizes.

03:31:58,968 --> 03:32:00,929
I told you

2503
03:32:02,430 --> 03:32:05,100
Steppenwolf would fail.

2504
03:32:06,101 --> 03:32:09,771
Yes. Yes, you did.

2505
03:32:10,355 --> 03:32:11,648
My master,

2506
03:32:11,773 --> 03:32:15,568
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,

2507
03:32:15,610 --> 03:32:19,572
how will you retrieve
your great prize?

2508
03:32:19,656 --> 03:32:22,992
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

2509
03:32:23,118 --> 03:32:28,039
And we will stop
at nothing to possess it.

2510
03:32:31,167 --> 03:32:32,794
Ready the armada.

2511
03:32:33,545 --> 03:32:36,047
We will use the old ways.

2512
03:33:37,692 --> 03:33:40,528

<i>not as a scientist,</i>

2519
03:35:14,289 --> 03:35:15,873
<i>as a father.</i>

2520
03:35:15,999 --> 03:35:19,252
<i>[chuckles]
Your father twice over.</i>

<i>I brought you into the world

<i>You can't imagine how proud
I am of who you are.</i>

<i>Have always been.</i>

[chuckles softly]

2525
03:35:33,182 --> 03:35:34,642
<i>So many years with you I wasted.</i>

2526
03:35:34,726 --> 03:35:38,229
<i>So many wrongs
I've left un-righted.</i>

2527

<i>Everything breaks, Victor.</i>

2528

<i>Everything changes.</i>

2529
03:35:55,955 --> 03:35:58,166
I gotta go see my father.

<i>Unexchangeable.</i>

2534
03:36:39,374 --> 03:36:41,250
[man] Ship's all yours now, kid.

2535
03:36:41,376 --> 03:36:42,794
You're the boss.

2536
03:36:44,879 --> 03:36:48,174
"Ryan Choi,
Director of Nanotechnology."

2537
03:36:48,299 --> 03:36:49,884
That's your thing.

2538
03:36:50,468 --> 03:36:52,345
Uh, yep. [sighs]

2539
03:36:52,428 --> 03:36:54,097
That's my thing.

Big round table.

2546
03:37:18,037 --> 03:37:20,331
Six chairs, right there.

2547
03:37:21,457 --> 03:37:23,126
But room for more.

2548
03:37:25,461 --> 03:37:27,171
But room for more.

2549
03:37:28,214 --> 03:37:29,799
God help us.

What?

2554
03:37:38,933 --> 03:37:41,727
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

2555
03:37:41,769 --> 03:37:44,313
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

2556
03:37:44,439 --> 03:37:46,107
This is like a "job" job?

2557
03:37:46,774 --> 03:37:48,025
"Job" job.

2558
03:37:51,612 --> 03:37:54,240
[laughs]
Your foot's in the door.

2559
03:37:56,534 --> 03:37:57,618
Isn't that a thing people say?

Your foot's in the door.

2561

Yeah, that's something

- His foot's in the door!

- [Henry] Yes! [laughs]
- Dad, you're gonna

2566
03:38:09,338 --> 03:38:10,339
get maced again.

2567
03:38:13,718 --> 03:38:15,595
No stopping you now.

[Barry chuckles softly]

2569
03:38:17,638 --> 03:38:18,848

<i>Now's your time, Victor,
to rise.</i>

2572
03:38:23,436 --> 03:38:26,439
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

2573
03:38:26,522 --> 03:38:30,193
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.

2574

[Clark chuckles]

2575
03:38:40,369 --> 03:38:43,414
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

2576
03:38:43,539 --> 03:38:45,500
I bought the bank.

2577
03:38:47,877 --> 03:38:50,463
Congratulations, by the way.

Luthor.

Luthor.

2602
03:41:21,030 --> 03:41:22,448
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

2603
03:41:22,573 --> 03:41:24,367
or I'm gonna
have to come in there.

Ah, there he is.

Welcome aboard.

Care for a glass
of Gout de Diamants?

2611
03:42:58,794 --> 03:43:00,713
I was just celebrating
God's return.

2612
03:43:00,755 --> 03:43:03,257
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

2613
03:43:03,340 --> 03:43:06,010
[Deathstroke] I heard you were
a few clowns short of a circus.

2614
03:43:06,135 --> 03:43:07,678
[chuckles] I was, thank you,

2615
03:43:07,803 --> 03:43:10,055
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

2616
03:43:10,139 --> 03:43:12,266
find some much needed clarity.

2617
03:43:12,349 --> 03:43:14,685
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

2618
03:43:14,810 --> 03:43:15,770
free of charge.

2619
03:43:15,936 --> 03:43:17,730
Why the pro bono work?

2620
03:43:17,772 --> 03:43:19,565
[sighs] It's personal.

2621
03:43:19,690 --> 03:43:22,735
Ah, let me guess,
an eye for an eye?

2622
03:43:24,653 --> 03:43:26,447
You said you had something
I'd want?

2623
03:43:26,530 --> 03:43:28,073
You'd better not be
wasting my time.

2624
03:43:28,115 --> 03:43:30,242
Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

2625
03:43:30,326 --> 03:43:32,161
No, I wouldn't think of it.

2626
03:43:32,286 --> 03:43:33,496
Uh, I have too much to live for.

2627
03:43:33,621 --> 03:43:36,749
And more important things to do.

2628
03:43:36,874 --> 03:43:40,252
But if you want the Batman,

2629
03:43:40,377 --> 03:43:43,631
here is something
that can help you.

2630
03:43:44,965 --> 03:43:49,220
His name is Bruce Wayne.

2631
03:43:52,223 --> 03:43:54,725
Hmm. On second thought,

2632
03:43:56,852 --> 03:43:59,146
we do have something
to celebrate.

2633
03:44:00,022 --> 03:44:01,565
Good boy.

2634
03:44:24,421 --> 03:44:25,673
[parademon chitters]

2635
03:45:05,880 --> 03:45:07,214
Clear.

2636
03:45:12,386 --> 03:45:14,221
How much further?

2637
03:45:15,264 --> 03:45:16,557
We're almost there.

2638
03:45:18,559 --> 03:45:20,269
Well, we need to hurry.

2639
03:45:20,394 --> 03:45:22,021
We can't be out in the open
much longer.

2640
03:45:22,104 --> 03:45:23,772
He'll come for us.

2641
03:45:26,609 --> 03:45:28,736
[Mera] Let him come.

2642
03:45:28,903 --> 03:45:30,571
Let the bastard come.

2643
03:45:31,739 --> 03:45:33,991
I'll stab this through his heart

2644
03:45:34,116 --> 03:45:36,285
for what he did to Arthur.

2645
03:45:36,410 --> 03:45:38,537
I want to make him pay.

2646
03:45:39,914 --> 03:45:42,875
I understand how you feel, Mera.

2647
03:45:42,958 --> 03:45:45,628
You have no idea how I feel.

2648
03:45:45,753 --> 03:45:47,588
But we have to stick to the plan

2649
03:45:47,755 --> 03:45:50,132
to have any chance
to make this right.

2650
03:45:50,257 --> 03:45:51,634
[Mera scoffs]

2651
03:45:58,015 --> 03:46:01,518
Who have you ever loved?

2652
03:46:05,356 --> 03:46:08,609
[man cackling]

2653
03:46:15,491 --> 03:46:18,786
[man] <i>Au contraire,</i>
my little fish stick.

2654
03:46:22,414 --> 03:46:24,083
He knows exactly what it's like

2655
03:46:24,124 --> 03:46:25,918
to lose someone he loves.

2656
03:46:27,878 --> 03:46:30,297
You know, like, uh,

2657
03:46:31,340 --> 03:46:32,841
a father,

2658
03:46:34,259 --> 03:46:36,428
like a mother.

2659
03:46:36,512 --> 03:46:39,723
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

2660
03:46:41,308 --> 03:46:43,477
Like an adopted son.

2661
03:46:47,106 --> 03:46:48,774
Isn't that right,

2662
03:46:50,192 --> 03:46:51,777
Batman?

2663
03:46:54,989 --> 03:46:56,323
Maybe, in a way,

2664
03:46:56,407 --> 03:46:58,325
that smelly
old flounder is right.

2665
03:46:59,868 --> 03:47:02,621
Because how many
can die in your arms

2666
03:47:02,705 --> 03:47:04,456
before you grow numb to death?

2667
03:47:05,958 --> 03:47:08,711
That's not very careful.

2668
03:47:08,836 --> 03:47:12,631
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

2669
03:47:12,673 --> 03:47:15,551
before you die inside yourself?

2670
03:47:15,676 --> 03:47:19,388
I've been dead inside
a long time,

2671
03:47:19,513 --> 03:47:21,473
but even I have a limit.

2672
03:47:21,557 --> 03:47:23,392
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...

2673
03:47:23,517 --> 03:47:26,395
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

2674
03:47:26,520 --> 03:47:28,522
You won't kill me.

2675
03:47:29,231 --> 03:47:31,316
I'm your best friend.

2676
03:47:31,400 --> 03:47:35,821
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around? [chuckles]

2677
03:47:37,865 --> 03:47:39,324
Anyway,

2678
03:47:40,409 --> 03:47:41,994
you need me.

2679
03:47:43,037 --> 03:47:44,788
You

2680
03:47:44,913 --> 03:47:47,750
need me to help you
undo this world

2681
03:47:47,875 --> 03:47:50,753
you created by letting her die.

2682
03:47:53,255 --> 03:47:55,215
Poor Lois.

2683
03:47:55,299 --> 03:47:58,093
How she suffered so!

2684
03:47:58,969 --> 03:48:00,054
[sighs]

2685
03:48:04,058 --> 03:48:06,226
I often wonder

2686
03:48:06,393 --> 03:48:08,187
how many alternate timelines

2687
03:48:08,312 --> 03:48:10,647
do you destroy
the world because...

2688
03:48:11,565 --> 03:48:13,192
frankly, you don't have

2689
03:48:13,317 --> 03:48:15,903
the cojones to die yourself.

2690
03:48:16,904 --> 03:48:18,447
Hmm?

2691
03:48:20,407 --> 03:48:21,575
So, as usual,

2692
03:48:21,700 --> 03:48:24,411
I'll be the bigger man.

2693
03:48:25,537 --> 03:48:26,747
[blows air]

2694
03:48:28,082 --> 03:48:29,666
A truce,

2695
03:48:30,375 --> 03:48:32,086
Bruce.

2696
03:48:32,252 --> 03:48:34,254
[cackling]

2697
03:48:34,421 --> 03:48:38,634
As long as you
have this card, a truce.

2698
03:48:41,512 --> 03:48:42,513
But all you have to do

2699
03:48:42,638 --> 03:48:43,722
is tear it in half

2700
03:48:43,847 --> 03:48:45,265
and I'm happy
to discuss with you

2701
03:48:45,391 --> 03:48:47,976
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

2702
03:48:49,645 --> 03:48:51,647
to do a man's job?

2703
03:48:55,025 --> 03:48:56,693
You know, it's funny

2704
03:48:56,819 --> 03:48:58,278
that you would talk about people

2705
03:48:58,362 --> 03:48:59,863
who died in my arms

2706
03:48:59,988 --> 03:49:01,740
because when I held Harley Quinn

2707
03:49:01,824 --> 03:49:04,410
and she was bleeding and dying,

2708
03:49:04,535 --> 03:49:08,247
she begged me
with her last breath

2709
03:49:08,288 --> 03:49:10,582
that when I killed you,

2710
03:49:10,666 --> 03:49:14,253
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...

2711
03:49:14,336 --> 03:49:16,171
that I'd do it slow.

2712
03:49:17,381 --> 03:49:19,508
I'm gonna honor that promise.

2713
03:49:49,997 --> 03:49:52,833
Oh. You're good.

2714
03:49:57,045 --> 03:49:58,714
You almost had me.

2715
03:50:05,012 --> 03:50:06,972
[cackling]

2716
03:50:13,312 --> 03:50:15,022
[Joker continues cackling]

2717
03:50:17,941 --> 03:50:19,193
Where are we holing up?

2718
03:50:19,359 --> 03:50:21,820
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

2719
03:50:21,862 --> 03:50:24,823
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

2720
03:50:24,907 --> 03:50:27,701
- [Joker blows raspberry]
- What do you think?

2721
03:50:29,661 --> 03:50:31,371
[armor beeps]

2722
03:50:31,538 --> 03:50:32,998
[distant explosion]

2723
03:50:33,624 --> 03:50:34,791
He's found us.

2724
03:50:56,605 --> 03:50:58,190
[cackling]

2725
03:51:13,330 --> 03:51:14,581
[gasps]

2726
03:51:16,583 --> 03:51:18,168
[breathing heavily]

2727
03:51:30,264 --> 03:51:32,140
[distant explosions]

2728
03:52:03,797 --> 03:52:06,341
Can I help you?

2729
03:52:06,466 --> 03:52:10,095
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.

2730
03:52:10,137 --> 03:52:13,223
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.

2731
03:52:13,348 --> 03:52:16,351
We have to find it
before he does.

2732
03:52:16,476 --> 03:52:18,353
There's a war coming.

2733
03:52:18,478 --> 03:52:20,314
And I'm here to help.

2734
03:52:20,439 --> 03:52:22,649
I'm sorry, who are you again?

2735
03:52:22,774 --> 03:52:24,901
I've gone by many names

2736
03:52:25,027 --> 03:52:28,238
and taken many forms.
And like you,

2737
03:52:28,363 --> 03:52:31,033
I've realized I have
a stake in this world

2738
03:52:31,158 --> 03:52:33,910
and it's time
I started fighting for it.

2739
03:52:34,494 --> 03:52:35,829
Oh.

2740
03:52:37,205 --> 03:52:39,499
Well, we could
definitely use the help.

2741
03:52:39,666 --> 03:52:43,003
So, glad you're here.

2742
03:52:44,004 --> 03:52:45,130
You know, I never thought

2743
03:52:45,172 --> 03:52:46,381
I'd see the defenders of Earth

2744
03:52:46,506 --> 03:52:49,343
united and fighting as one.

2745
03:52:49,426 --> 03:52:52,095
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

2746
03:52:53,305 --> 03:52:55,974
Your mother and father
would be proud.

2747
03:52:57,267 --> 03:52:58,393
I hope so.

2748
03:53:04,483 --> 03:53:07,402
Well, I'll be in touch.

2749
03:53:08,445 --> 03:53:12,532
Oh, and some have called me

2750
03:53:12,658 --> 03:53:15,035
the Martian Manhunter.

2751
03:53:22,626 --> 03:53:25,087
I guess I'll see you around.
