1
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,343
<i>Bobby?</i>

2
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,417
<i>Bobby, where are you?</i>

3
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,860
<i>Answer me.</i>

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,527
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

5
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,005
Mr. Kane?

6
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,009
Mr. Kane, do you know where you are?

7
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,874
Do you remember what happened?

8
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,490
Try and follow the light
with your eyes.

9
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,090
You've had an accident.

10
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,095
You were flying an airplane,
and the plane went down.

11
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,100
You've been unconscious
for quite a long time.

12
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,138
My name is Dr. Fellows...

13
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,806
...and I'm here to help you
get your life back.

14
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,945
What happened to my family?

15
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,378
I'm sorry, Mr. Kane.

16
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,361
Kristina!

17
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,426
Kristina!

18
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,975
Paul Kane? Lawrence Augenblick,
personal injury solicitor.

19
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,010
- I wonder if you could spare me a few...?
- Do you mind?

20
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,674
Here's my card. I know this is no time
to be using the "S" word...

21
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,252
...but you should know
the plane you were flying...

22
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,583
...had parts and maintenance issues.
- How did you get in?

23
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:42,023
- Give us a minute. This is important.
- I have to ask you to leave.

24
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,798
Don't be a victim, Mr. Kane.
Make the buggers pay.

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,332
I think we did a very nice job,
even though I do say so myself.

26
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,631
The door wouldn't open.

27
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,207
No one's blaming you.

28
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,883
I don't remember anything else.

29
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,350
You will.

30
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,046
It will all come back.

31
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,130
They have a haunting fragrance,
don't they?

32
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:29,605
I heard about your family. I thought
you might appreciate an American voice.

33
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,711
I just can't tell you how sorry I am.

34
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,712
Thank you.

35
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:40,614
But, Paul, you know,
this Dr. Fellows is not...

36
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:47,416
She's a private contractor,
hired from the outside for your rehab...

37
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,754
...and that means that...

38
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,421
...your discretion is required.

39
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,728
God, it's good to see you again, Paul.

40
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,073
When was the last time?
I can't quite remember.

41
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,773
<i>I remember.</i>

42
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,146
It was Paris.

43
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,255
Yes, of course, Paris.

44
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,755
Be careful what you say
to Dr. Fellows, Paul.

45
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,369
Very good. Your hand-eye
coordination is improving.

46
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,178
Keep this up and you'll be back
in the office in no time.

47
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,581
- What office?
- It's a figure of speech.

48
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,287
Your file says you work from home,
been in the country nearly two years.

49
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,461
Some sort of
consulting business, I think.

50
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,290
Luckily, you don't need good
hand-eye coordination for that.

51
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,213
You speak French very well.

52
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,316
Well, I studied in Switzerland for a year.

53
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:22,410
- Yours isn't bad either.
- My mother was French.

54
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,524
That's all she spoke around the house
when I was growing up as a kid.

55
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,388
What else does it say in my file?

56
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:35,023
You're 44 years old, 6 feet tall, 200
pounds, and you have exceptional reflexes.

57
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,696
What does it say in your file?

58
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,537
That I'm a psychiatrist
specializing in trauma.

59
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,846
How did you know I speak French?

60
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,081
Wild guess.

61
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,993
You ready?

62
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,863
Look familiar?

63
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,299
Not really.

64
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:19,209
Don't worry. Visual memory
is only fragments of images at best.

65
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,440
Your recovery means stitching them
together into something that makes sense.

66
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,711
Where are they buried?

67
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,226
- When was the funeral?
- March.

68
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,590
My dad was a flyer, made a career
out of the military.

69
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,636
I guess you could say
I was an Air Force brat.

70
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:50,902
Grew up on bases all over the world:
Italy, Germany, lots of different places.

71
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,039
He was shot down over North Vietnam.

72
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,142
His body was never recovered.

73
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,724
Which one is it?

74
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,564
It's that one.

75
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,240
The sign was Kristina's idea.
She wanted it to be just like home.

76
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,308
I'd like to go in alone,
if you don't mind.

77
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:40,988
This is not going to be easy.
You sure you're ready?

78
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,786
Thanks for the ride, doctor.

79
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,768
Hello, Paul.

80
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,208
Oh, hello, Frank.

81
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,405
I've been picking up your mail.
It's on the table inside.

82
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,041
Look, Janet and I wanted you to know...

83
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,247
...well, if there's anything we can do,
please just let us know.

84
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,154
Thank you, Frank. I appreciate that.

85
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,708
Yes.

86
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,047
- Who is this?
- <i>Kelton Reed.</i>

87
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,056
<i>I just wanted to call,</i>
<i>see if everything was okay.</i>

88
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,488
Everything's fine.

89
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,154
<i>Did you get the personal effects</i>
<i>I sent over?</i>

90
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,765
Yes, I did.

91
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:14,299
<i>I'm sorry, but we didn't know for sure</i>
<i>if you were going to make it.</i>

92
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,203
<i>If there's anything missing...</i>

93
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,504
No.

94
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,305
It looks like it's all here.

95
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,381
<i>We'll talk soon, then.</i>

96
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,114
- Good morning, Mr. Kane.
- Good morning.

97
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:20,428
I expect when you got home, a lot of
things you'd forgotten came rushing back.

98
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,071
One or two.

99
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,479
It's not uncommon.
Familiar surroundings.

100
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:37,812
Sometime even the most mundane objects
can trigger incredibly powerful memories.

101
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,692
<i>Memories can be vivid.</i>
<i>A smell, a sound.</i>

102
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,599
Paul?

103
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,945
What were you thinking about?

104
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,640
Oh, nothing.

105
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,642
It was nothing.

106
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,619
I didn't tell Dr. Fellows
about the gun, of course.

107
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,985
I didn't tell her about any of it:

108
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,921
My recruitment, my training.

109
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,590
<i>What do you tell her?</i>

110
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:23,929
<i>Oh, I tell her about bee stings</i>
<i>and tree houses, about my first bicycle...</i>

111
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,766
<i>... about catching frogs in the ditch</i>
<i>behind the house I grew up in.</i>

112
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,431
<i>That's what she wants to hear</i>
<i>about most of the time:</i>

113
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,203
<i>What kind of childhood I had,</i>
<i>what I remember of it.</i>

114
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,642
<i>Does she ask about your work?</i>

115
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,340
<i>Sometimes. It's a consulting business.</i>
<i>What's to know?</i>

116
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,576
<i>The reason you're here in London?</i>

117
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,584
Emerging markets.

118
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,723
<i>That's good.</i>

119
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,917
<i>Safe is good.</i>

120
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,326
<i>You are the best, Paul,</i>
<i>the best we have.</i>

121
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,318
Dr. Fellows.

122
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,358
Mr. Kane. I didn't hear from you today.
I was concerned.

123
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,257
Oh, I apologize. I meant to call.

124
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:31,926
- I'm not interrupting anything, I hope.
- No, no, I was just in the kitchen.

125
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,601
- I'm sorry, were you eating?
- I was gonna cook...

126
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,442
...some pasta.

127
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,080
I eat out. Every night, in fact.

128
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,045
- All by yourself?
- Mostly, yes.

129
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,276
- You don't like company?
- Not particularly.

130
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,716
Not unless it has to do with work.

131
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,890
It's the family house.
It's not surprising.

132
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,254
When I do think about them...

133
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:01,525
...during holiday times,
for example, I...

134
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,102
Must be very painful.

135
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:10,038
Well, the strange thing is that
I don't think about them that often.

136
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,938
People cope in different ways.

137
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:16,810
I know I'm supposed to feel guilty
about that, but for some reason I don't.

138
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,646
And the things I do remember,
some details are missing.

139
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,847
For example, I know
that I should stop at a red light...

140
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,153
...but I don't remember having
ever stopped at one before.

141
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,229
It's the inability to access
associative memory.

142
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,492
It's common with injuries like yours.

143
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,766
Thank you.

144
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,634
- I hope you like French.
- Yes, I do. My mother was French.

145
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,829
Yes, I know.

146
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:50,171
That's right, you know everything about me,
and I know absolutely nothing about you.

147
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,088
- What would you like to know?
- What is your first name?

148
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,316
Except that.
That's the thing I hate most.

149
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,357
Why?

150
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,856
- Harriet.
- That's bad?

151
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,228
Harriet got five A-Levels
and a Double First from Cambridge.

152
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,859
It was an anti-boy signal,
forced me to hit the books.

153
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,530
That's some name.
Ever think of changing it?

154
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,039
Oh, I did.

155
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:22,507
Oh, I gave myself any number of names
that I begged them to call me growing up.

156
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:27,515
Lulu, Cindy, Anastasia.

157
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,177
Didn't matter,
the reality of Harriet prevailed.

158
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,391
Something to drink, sir?

159
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:40,532
And what if they had called you
Lulu or Cindy or Anastasia?

160
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,189
Who knows?

161
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:47,634
You can't go back and relive your childhood
under different circumstances, can you?

162
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,340
I don't think I'd want to.

163
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,904
I had a very happy childhood...

164
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,710
...but it's an interesting idea.

165
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,480
So after I graduated from Cambridge,
I started research into...

166
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,417
Do you...?

167
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,615
Do you know those two men?

168
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,160
No, I don't think I do.

169
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:26,536
Quite a party in prospect.
Cocktails for a president-in-waiting.

170
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:31,273
Thing is, if he does form
the next government...

171
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,975
...we lose all privileges.

172
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,519
What are we gonna do about that?

173
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,458
Relax, already taken care of.

174
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,961
- Madam, monsieur, everything satisfactory?
- Wonderful, thank you.

175
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,098
No, I invited you, remember?

176
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,473
All right.

177
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,874
If you'll excuse me
just one second.

178
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,202
What's your name?

179
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,965
Maynard.

180
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,907
- Are you following me, Maynard?
- Orders. Kelton Reed.

181
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,247
You tell him I'm ready.

182
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:17,444
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

183
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,815
You mind if I drive?

184
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,067
I would ask you in, but...

185
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,072
No, no, no.
I have an early appointment.

186
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,203
Well, thanks for dinner.

187
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,915
Paul. It's so good to see you.

188
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:33,157
You know, Kelton and I, when we lost Ben,
I didn't want to live any more.

189
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,163
But you gotta go on.

190
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,735
You know, you're like a son to him now.

191
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,064
Here you go, sweetheart.

192
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,767
Now you be real careful.
That's hot now.

193
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,309
Billy, you back again? How many
of these things you gonna eat?

194
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,782
Honey, look what I've got.

195
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,230
Paul!

196
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,083
Come on, let's get out of here.

197
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:36,221
You know, you broke Maynard's nose.
The other guy's got cracked ribs.

198
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,158
Who were those guys?

199
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,858
Local assets.
Ex-British Special Forces.

200
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,401
Not so special.

201
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,601
So you want to go back to work?

202
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,505
Yeah, I think I do.

203
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,136
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Good morning, doctor.

204
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,739
Oh, Mr. Kane.

205
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,478
<i>I'm sorry to get you so early.</i>
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

206
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:40,049
No, no, it's fine.
Is there a problem?

207
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,780
No. I just wanted to apologize.

208
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,822
I won't be able to make our next session.
I'm off on a business trip.

209
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,457
A business trip?

210
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,318
Isn't it a bit soon?

211
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,689
- Well, don't worry, I'm feeling all right.
- <i>Where are you going?</i>

212
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,767
Amsterdam.

213
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,328
- <i>What's in Amsterdam?</i>
- Oh, a couple of meetings.

214
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:06,032
I see. You may find that you have
difficulty getting on the plane.

215
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,643
I don't think it will be a problem.
I didn't want you to be concerned.

216
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,174
I see. Well, have a good trip.

217
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:17,947
<i>And if you experience any anxieties at all,</i>
<i>don't hesitate to call me anytime.</i>

218
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,115
Thank you.

219
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,283
I'll be in touch.

220
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,211
I'm David.

221
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,444
Joelle.

222
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,087
Give me your hand.

223
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,998
- Excuse me, my wife...
- That's all right. Just go this way.

224
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,664
Thank you.

225
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,384
Oh, hello.

226
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,486
- Hello. Lovely meeting you.
- Nice to see you.

227
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,719
Yes. This is my wife, Annette.

228
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:04,519
Excuse me, sir. I'm so sorry.
Please, let me tend to that immediately.

229
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,218
Excuse us, please.

230
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,031
Here we are, sir.

231
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,633
<i>Make a wish, Paul,</i>
<i>and blow out the candles.</i>

232
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,246
Shoot him.

233
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,375
Shoot him!

234
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,466
- Come on!
- Go!

235
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:09,606
Lbrahim? Oh, God! Lbrahim? Oh, God!

236
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,153
- I'm sorry.
- Money, now!

237
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,991
Give me your watch.

238
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,701
Now, the ring.

239
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,334
What's the next flight to London?

240
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,435
Sorry, sir, nothing now
until tomorrow morning.

241
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,513
Shite!

242
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,419
- Yes?
- <i>I missed the train.</i>

243
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,531
We know. Where are you?

244
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,797
I'm at the airport.

245
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,638
I don't know what happened.

246
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,240
<i>It's all right. Your partner caught it in time.</i>

247
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:49,379
- I guess I wasn't as ready as I thought.
- Forget about it.

248
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,447
There'll be other trains.

249
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:57,880
- When are you flying back?
- In the morning. I'll be at Heathrow at 6:40.

250
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,647
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

251
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,833
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Paul. I hope I didn't wake you.

252
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,042
<i>No, no, no.</i>

253
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,041
I needed to get up anyway.

254
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,840
Where are you?
Sounds like you're on a plane.

255
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:28,045
- Yes, I'm flying back this morning.
- <i>That was a short trip.</i>

256
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:33,883
Yeah, let me ask you a question.
Who is Chilly Willy?

257
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,225
Chilly Willy?

258
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,431
It's a cartoon character, I think.

259
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:48,398
- A cartoon character?
- A penguin that's always cold.

260
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:54,370
- That's all, nothing else?
- <i>Cartoons can be very meaningful.</i>

261
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,043
<i>The joy of childhood...</i>

262
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:11,021
- <i>Paul? Paul, are you still there?</i>
- Yes, yes, I'm here.

263
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,020
Paul, are you all right?

264
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,528
No, no.

265
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,794
<i>Come straight here from the airport.</i>
<i>Do you still have my address?</i>

266
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,460
<i>Yes.</i>

267
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:26,941
- I need to see you right away.
- Sir, switch your phone off, please.

268
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,639
- I have to go now.
- <i>Paul</i>?

269
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:38,183
- Excuse me, miss. What is this video?
- It's a safety video.

270
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:43,953
If you'd like to take your seat please, sir.
Fasten your seat belt. Prepare for takeoff.

271
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,417
I need to go aboard.

272
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:42,247
Maybe if you told me
what you're looking for...

273
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,379
- What's happened?
- Paul Kane killed three people yesterday.

274
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:51,477
- Oh, my God.
- We have no motive.

275
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,590
Worse, we have no idea
of where he is. Do you?

276
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,721
- No.
- Are you sure?

277
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,731
He hasn't contacted you at all?

278
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,564
He did call me from the plane.
He wanted to come and see me.

279
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,228
What about?

280
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,669
Doctor?

281
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,779
He wanted to know who Chilly Willy was.

282
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,417
He remembers.

283
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,455
What size car, sir?
Full size, medium or compact?

284
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:33,527
Why don't you just give me any car
with four wheels and a full tank of gas.

285
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,931
Are you over 25 and
with a major credit card?

286
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:45,040
He told me he was on a business trip.
Why was I not informed of this?

287
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,803
I have no idea.
I didn't know anything about it either.

288
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,947
But I'll tell you what we do know:

289
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:56,848
- Your instincts about him are wrong.
- Instinct is not the issue. I keep telling you.

290
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,986
I'm sorry, doctor, but I
think it is exactly the issue.

291
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,820
See, I believe in nature.

292
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:07,953
If nature selects you to be a cold-blooded
killer, then that is what you are.

293
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:12,501
- You can't change that.
- That's a very bleak view of the world.

294
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,164
- Lf people can't change, what hope is there?
- It's been your job to prove me wrong.

295
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,167
I'm still waiting.

296
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:23,005
Something must've gone wrong,
something we didn't anticipate.

297
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,046
Look, I'm not blaming you.

298
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,177
We both knew what we were dealing with.

299
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:36,121
- What do you want me to do now?
- Stay put, hope he makes contact again.

300
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,625
You're closer to him than anyone.

301
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:45,257
Now, don't worry. You'll be under 24-hour
surveillance, someone nearby at all times.

302
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,394
They made Kane
renting a car at the airport.

303
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,131
I've gotta go.

304
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,449
Right, got it. Just get him
before he leaves the airport.

305
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:38,311
- Hey, Paul, what's going on?
- Frank! You scared me. Get down.

306
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,142
Someone's broken into my house.

307
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,547
- My God, where?
- Don't let them see you.

308
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,348
- Come on inside, we'll call the police.
- No, don't do that. Not yet.

309
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,755
Let's go inside.

310
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,189
You keep an eye on them.
I'll call the police.

311
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,337
Hello? Yes, this is Frank Butler,
93 Winfield Lane.

312
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,566
I'm here with my neighbor. He says
there's someone breaking into his house.

313
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,369
Yes, he's here with me now.

314
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,411
That's what I said.

315
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,707
I don't know.

316
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,577
Well, how long do you...?

317
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,335
You know who I am?

318
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,171
You're Mr. Kane.

319
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,039
How do you know that?

320
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,208
Because it says so on the sign
in front of your house.

321
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,841
So it does.

322
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,917
Hello?

323
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,188
Hello?

324
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,156
Paul, is that you?

325
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,433
<i>Paul, we want to help you.</i>

326
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,102
Can you hear me, Paul?

327
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,485
It's like he's circling his territory.

328
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,055
We're not hunting an animal.

329
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,953
Lawrence Augenblick Solicitors.

330
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:07,995
Hi, Sonia. Yeah, I know.
It's really quite...

331
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:11,329
Would you mind if I put you on hold?
Okay.

332
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,398
Hello, do you have
an appointment?

333
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,370
No. Could you tell Mr. Augenblick
that Paul Kane is here to...?

334
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:23,478
Thank you for coming in.
We'll set something up for next week.

335
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,011
- Thanks very much.
- Bye.

336
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,447
- Larry, this is Mr...
- No, don't tell me.

337
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:32,988
Plane crash, severe head trauma. Mr...

338
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,493
- Kane. Paul Kane.
- Mr. Kane.

339
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:41,494
I'm terrible with names,
but I never forget an injury.

340
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,024
This is what the newspaper had to say.

341
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:50,931
According to the official report, that type
of plane had six similar episodes recently.

342
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:54,509
- Now, I don't want to count any chickens...
- I want to show you something.

343
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:07,183
<i>We're now going to take you through</i>
<i>our safety procedures and equipment.</i>

344
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:12,090
<i>As this information is for your benefit, we</i>
<i>ask that you watch and listen carefully.</i>

345
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:15,390
- <i>The safety card shows details of the...</i>
- Mr. Kane?

346
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,535
<i>... oxygen masks and life jackets.</i>

347
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,432
<i>It also shows the bracing position...</i>

348
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,000
That's my wife.

349
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,567
Oh, right, I'm sorry.
She was a beautiful woman.

350
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:30,907
She was never a flight attendant.
She was a graphic designer.

351
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,413
<i>Down toward the rear of the aircraft...</i>

352
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,809
Something else I wanna show you.

353
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:42,252
Can you read what it says?

354
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,660
- Looks like, "Chilly Willy."
- Yeah.

355
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,491
Chilly Willy was a cartoon character,
a penguin.

356
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:52,260
Now, you tell me, what's that
doing in my mouth?

357
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,764
You suffered some pretty
severe injuries, Mr. Kane.

358
00:47:56,974 --> 00:48:00,774
I mean, head injuries. You were
unconscious for a long time.

359
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,741
That woman is my wife.

360
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,441
I'm telling you, literally,
there's something wrong with this picture.

361
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:12,579
Why me? Why not a private detective or
the police if something's not kosher?

362
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,553
Because I don't know who I can trust.

363
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:21,596
I'm just walking out for some cat food.
I'll be back in a minute.

364
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,617
Excuse me.

365
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,145
What did they tell you?

366
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:50,119
- What did they tell you?
- That you murdered three people.

367
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,124
- What else?
- They want me to help bring you in.

368
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:00,024
Who wants you to? Kelton Reed?

369
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:05,700
Don't lie to me.
I took a big risk following you here.

370
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,894
- Have you heard from him?
- No, no, I haven't.

371
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,040
- He'll contact you. Be careful.
- Why?

372
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:16,771
Watch him. I know it's ridiculous, asking
you to trust me, but you're the only one...

373
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:20,713
You know everything
that I've been through.

374
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,748
Paul, what happened in Amsterdam?

375
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,722
I can't tell you that.

376
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,711
Bloody hell! You scared me to death.

377
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,416
- How did you get in here?
- You got cheap locks on your door.

378
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:03,119
I called the airline, tracked
down the woman on the video.

379
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:06,888
- She's not a flight attendant.
- What did I tell you?

380
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:13,162
She's an actress. Her name's Amy O'Brien.
I spoke to her agent. They sent me this.

381
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,667
I also found the airfield you flew
out of on the day of your crash.

382
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:20,070
- I thought I'd go and see what I can dig up.
- I want to see her.

383
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,370
- I wouldn't advise that.
- She's my wife.

384
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,240
- Mr. Kane...
- Paul.

385
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:29,207
I believe you
when you say she's your wife.

386
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,877
I mean, I believe you believe it.

387
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:35,116
But we've got a good case
developing. Let's not blow it.

388
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,318
- She's my wife.
- You think she's your wife.

389
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,987
That's why I have to go and find out.

390
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,352
What are you doing?
What the hell is going on here?

391
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,260
Don't look so surprised, doctor.

392
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,630
What are you doing with my notes?

393
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:28,299
He nearly killed one of my men last night.
You were there.

394
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:32,847
I don't need to tell you what happens
if that material gets out of our hands.

395
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,946
Tell me, how does Paul Kane know you?

396
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,715
What did he tell you?

397
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:46,153
You don't work for the
Justice Department, do you?

398
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:50,221
No, but I work for a justice department.

399
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:55,162
You're gonna kill him, aren't you?

400
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,402
What was Paul really doing in Amsterdam?

401
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,071
Business.

402
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:05,942
Was it business for him to kill a Malaysian
politician and two of his bodyguards?

403
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,843
Look, this is over.

404
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,119
I've always admired you and your work.

405
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:17,386
We'll take that into consideration
when we evaluate your situation later.

406
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,081
Blimey! What happened?

407
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:47,712
Came down near some trees
about three miles over there.

408
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,951
The investigator says it was weather.

409
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,721
- What do you say?
- Same.

410
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,830
Do you always say what they say?

411
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,867
We've been over her from top to bottom.

412
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:03,631
No defects, nothing.
It's all in the official report.

413
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,941
- Weather, eh?
- That's right.

414
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:28,157
Excuse me. Excuse me, miss.

415
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:35,159
- Are you Amy?
- I'm sorry. I don't...

416
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:39,362
- You're an actress, right?
- Who are you?

417
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:44,702
My name is Paul.
I've seen some of your work.

418
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,235
I haven't really done much.
What did you see?

419
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:53,675
It was this thing where you were a wife,
a mother. You had...

420
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,580
...children, two little girls...
- My God! You saw that?

421
00:55:56,753 --> 00:56:00,780
The interactive video thing?
That was so weird. You saw it, really?

422
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:04,256
- Where did you see it, in the U.S.?
- Yes, that's right.

423
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:10,324
They didn't even send me a copy. Two days
in the studio and then, "Don't call us."

424
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,368
Since then, it's been
a little here, a little there...

425
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:17,473
...but I'm still waiting for my big break.

426
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,133
Can I ask you something?

427
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:27,880
Was I all right? I mean, the accent and all.
Was I, you know, believable?

428
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,514
Yes.

429
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,916
Very.

430
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,619
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

431
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,735
<i>They said it was weather-related.</i>

432
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:30,777
The skies were clear that day. I checked
with the forecasts, newspapers. Nothing.

433
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:35,206
No, I remember the weather.
It was bad. Rainy, very stormy.

434
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:39,481
That won't hold up in court. You can't
remember a thing. You're a head case.

435
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,851
Sorry.

436
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:45,858
I don't know what's real. All I've got are
memories of things that never existed.

437
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:50,362
- Like that plane crash.
- No, the plane is real. I saw the plane.

438
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,666
And I saw the girl. I held her hand.

439
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:58,204
I looked into her eyes, and she wasn't real.

440
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,707
All we gotta do is make sense of something
that doesn't make sense.

441
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,879
- Chilly Willy.
- What?

442
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:13,588
You ever hear of somebody getting
a tattoo on the inside of their lip?

443
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:16,624
- What about it?
- Do many people get them there?

444
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:20,251
Lots of people, in jail or reform school.

445
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,490
It's an American thing.
Catching on over here.

446
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,498
- Jail, you say?
- Yeah.

447
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:30,332
Tats is against the rules.
Self-mutilation, they call it.

448
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,568
That's why you put them there.

449
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:36,009
So nobody knows.

450
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:40,307
I've never been in prison. That I know.

451
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,486
What, like you knew that
actress was really your wife?

452
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:46,383
- What are you saying?
- I don't know.

453
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,922
Maybe the crash wiped
it from your head.

454
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:57,589
Paul, you have told me everything,
haven't you? I mean everything?

455
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,132
Yes.

456
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,868
Yes.

457
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,263
Except...

458
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,442
...someone is trying to kill me.

459
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:12,243
Actually, a team of men is trying to kill me.

460
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,651
Right, and I was gonna invite
you to stay at my place.

461
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,725
Not exactly the Ritz.
My ex-wife cleaned me out.

462
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:28,821
Lovely woman.

463
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,463
Hey, that swing out there,
who does that belong to?

464
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:41,234
My son's.

465
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,111
Thanks. I used to have
one of those as a kid.

466
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,908
I'd swing high and bail
out like a fighter pilot.

467
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,847
- My kid does the same thing.
- Is he with his mother?

468
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:53,648
- Yeah, I see him a couple times a month.
- How old is he?

469
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,848
Six.

470
00:59:56,025 --> 01:00:00,018
Nothing in the world gives you more
perspective than having a kid.

471
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,830
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- No, it's okay.

472
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:09,668
Look, I've jabbered on long enough.
You get some sleep, okay?

473
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:16,979
You got a lot of troubles, Paul,
but I'm gonna help you. Promise.

474
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:20,816
Thanks.

475
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,630
There you go.

476
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:50,234
You okay?
You were talking in your sleep.

477
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:55,540
Yeah, I'm fine. You know, I was thinking
about what you said about the crash...

478
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:58,347
...about me losing those memories.
- Yeah?

479
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,083
Well, Larry, that still doesn't
explain Kristina.

480
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:08,060
I mean, I watched her die.
They took me to her grave.

481
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,430
Who did?

482
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,577
Paper for Dr. Fellows.

483
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,062
Slide over.

484
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:26,561
And please, no penguins.

485
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,644
- Paul, what happened in Amsterdam?
- You mean you really don't know?

486
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,977
Where Reed's concerned,
I know less than you think.

487
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,847
I need to tell you something.

488
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,052
I kill people.

489
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:52,187
I'm an assassin
for the United States government.

490
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,699
I need to tell you something.

491
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:04,003
No, you're not.

492
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:10,638
I was a research fellow at Cambridge
when they first approached me.

493
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,304
Who?

494
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:15,973
They said the American
Justice Department.

495
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,756
They wanted to see if a hardened criminal
could be rehabilitated...

496
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:25,691
...using a technique I'd been developing
called clinical memory displacement.

497
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:30,360
The pilot study needed a particular
kind of subject.

498
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:36,764
He was perfect, a sociopath with a high IQ
and multiple homicides to his credit.

499
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,437
His name was Robert Willard.

500
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,077
Chilly Willy.

501
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:52,046
<i>Let me get this straight, you saying I ain't</i>
<i>gonna have no memory of my life now?</i>

502
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:54,389
<i>That's correct.</i>

503
01:04:55,992 --> 01:05:00,520
<i>That's wild, man. That's wild.</i>
<i>How you gonna do that?</i>

504
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:04,427
<i>Through a procedure</i>
<i>called displacement imprinting.</i>

505
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:10,436
<i>Displacement imprint?</i>
<i>Man, that's good.</i>

506
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,670
<i>Hey.</i>

507
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:21,413
<i>Where was you all 10 years ago</i>
<i>when I was killing all them people?</i>

508
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,981
<i>Well, maybe it's best.</i>

509
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,659
<i>Do what you want.</i>

510
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:35,024
<i>Kill me. Resurrect me.</i>

511
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,097
<i>I don't give a damn.</i>

512
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:45,940
The first thing we did was to stage
your execution. National press coverage.

513
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,400
Not even the warden knew.

514
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:01,245
Then, we planted the story
about the air crash in all the papers.

515
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:10,463
We'd already transported you to the lab
that we'd set up here in this country.

516
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,941
Reed was there representing
the U.S. Government.

517
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:32,111
We're ready, doctor.

518
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,282
Let's party.

519
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:03,217
My belief was that if we could erase
all of your bad memories from 0 to 6...

520
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:07,082
...and replace them with memories
of love and support...

521
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:10,487
...that we could eliminate
Willard's homicidal tendencies.

522
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,850
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

523
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,875
<i>Make a wish, Paul,</i>
<i>and blow out your candles.</i>

524
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:20,656
We matched your new identity
with parts of Willard's...

525
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:24,061
...an Air Force father,
bases all around the world.

526
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:27,794
But this time happy, more loving.

527
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,474
When we'd fixed your new personality...

528
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:40,376
...we changed your appearance
beyond recognition.

529
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:57,897
How long did all of this take?

530
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,995
Seven months.

531
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:06,703
We kept you in a controlled coma
for seven months.

532
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,223
Please, excuse me, sir.

533
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,596
Paul?

534
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:48,268
I need to know,
those people in Amsterdam...

535
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:52,241
...did you?
- No.

536
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,486
I couldn't do it.

537
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:04,323
But Amsterdam was not my first mission.

538
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:09,292
It was the first real one.

539
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:20,570
- You mean that Reed...?
- Hijacked the experiment. Yes.

540
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:25,278
And implanted another set of memories...

541
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:28,679
...memories of being a hired assassin.

542
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:05,408
German cars.

543
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,302
I never saw anyone die like that, close up.

544
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,962
If he found us, Reed can't be far behind.

545
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,875
- We need to tell someone.
- Look, it's me he's after.

546
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:41,379
- I'll get out at the next train station.
- No, don't do that.

547
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:44,075
- Why?
- Because I trust you...

548
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,545
...more than I trust Reed.

549
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:55,729
Where are we going?

550
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,796
Somewhere, anywhere
they won't find us.

551
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,571
What is it?

552
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:11,344
Both Kane and Willard grew up
on bases here, right?

553
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,347
We matched parts of their biographies, yes.

554
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,449
Did young Kane spend any time
on an air base here?

555
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,619
In the U.K.?

556
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:24,417
- No. We didn't create anything like that.
- You're absolutely sure?

557
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:27,756
Yes. Why?

558
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,266
Because I think Bobby Willard may have.

559
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,250
There's more.

560
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,321
We played here when I was a kid.

561
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:34,025
I left my mark on a tree
somewhere over here.

562
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:52,538
- Look at that.
- It's impossible.

563
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:59,182
Impossible? Why, because you didn't put it
there? Because it's something of my own?

564
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:04,248
There was a tin shack
right over here somewhere.

565
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,415
Watch your step here.

566
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:32,544
Man...

567
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,717
The old guy that lived here
used to let us play out back.

568
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:39,656
I bet he's long gone now.

569
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:41,925
What are you doing?

570
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,759
It's 3:30 in the morning.
Where else are we gonna stay?

571
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,924
I guess I owe you an apology.

572
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:12,188
For what?

573
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:18,430
For all of this, for them.
If I hadn't agreed to do what I did l...

574
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,899
I would be dead right now.

575
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:25,131
I realized that driving over here.

576
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:29,367
That, in spite of everything
that you did to me...

577
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:31,705
...if it weren't for you,
I would be dead.

578
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:41,555
We're gonna have to tell people, go public.
It's the only... It's the only way.

579
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:47,051
What's gonna happen when people find out
that Bobby Willard is still alive?

580
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,394
Is he? Really?

581
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:57,063
Well, what if Reed is right?

582
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:01,565
What if nature does win out every time?

583
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:06,609
I don't believe that.

584
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:11,481
Bobby Willard cared for nothing
and no one.

585
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,813
He was a murderer.

586
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:19,952
Then who is Paul Kane?

587
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,462
He's everything I made him.

588
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:29,933
He's everything I wanted him to be.

589
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:03,730
<i>Where was you all 10 years ago</i>
<i>when I was killing all them people?</i>

590
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,388
Just like a homing pigeon.

591
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:28,721
Let's keep radio contact to clicks.
And for God's sake, don't shoot me.

592
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:31,048
Paul, you okay?

593
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:37,154
This place is just as I remember.

594
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:42,529
Well, that must be reassuring.

595
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:48,937
I mean it's exactly the same. Thirty-four
years have gone by and nothing's changed.

596
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:53,274
That paint is the same color. That window
was cracked in the same place.

597
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:57,908
That tree, the shape of those bushes.
That doesn't seem right.

598
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,152
Unless...

599
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:10,054
Reed.

600
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:17,528
All right, stay here
and try to stay out of sight.

601
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,472
I'm going in.

602
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:04,651
Maynard, cover the front.

603
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,850
<i>Ford, take the right.</i>

604
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,122
Maynard, you copy that?

605
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:13,088
Ford?

606
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,864
<i>You copy that?</i>

607
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,845
Watch yourselves. There's nobody home.

608
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:15,850
Maynard?

609
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:18,950
Ford, you hear me?

610
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:32,634
Paul?

611
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:37,004
I know she's here, Paul.

612
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,312
Just want you to know,
when I find her, she's dead.

613
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:45,350
After what she did to me, that's okay.

614
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:48,787
So long as I get you.

615
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,023
You hear that, doctor?

616
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,660
You must be so proud.

617
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:13,837
Paul?

618
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:46,368
You know, Paul,
your dad used to drive a car just like that.

619
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,145
Come on, son.

620
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:29,515
Let's see what you got.

621
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:33,217
Come on.

622
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,691
Don't forget, I know all your moves.

623
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:29,738
Too bad she gave you
a conscience, Paul.

624
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:34,240
You're an assassin who can't kill.

625
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:38,879
Now what's the use of that?

626
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:50,460
There.

627
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:56,759
You see how easy it is?

628
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,414
Paul.

629
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:17,756
How bad is it?

630
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:24,255
Try not to move, just lie still.

631
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,163
Did you empty the gun?

632
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:36,840
I'm so sorry.

633
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:41,714
Last night I just... I couldn't be sure.

634
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:47,448
What about now?

635
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:04,795
Then it was worth it.

636
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,442
Paul?

637
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:21,750
Paul!

638
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:53,969
