1
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,847
Help! Help!

2
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,740
Hey. How are you?
Happy holidays.

3
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,283
You're good.

4
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,253
Thank you, sir.

5
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,257
Is that you, angel?

6
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,692
Yeah, it's me.

7
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,227
What brought you back this way?

8
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,697
I just... I couldn't
stay away from you.

9
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,665
Oh, stop. I'm gonna
see them upstairs.

10
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,742
Ray Kasten. She's expecting me.

11
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,010
Go right ahead.

12
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,079
Look who's back.

13
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,249
Could you ask Jessica Cobb
to come in, please? Mm-hmm.

14
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,516
Like a rash.

15
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,455
Wow. Thirteen years.
Two promotions.

16
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,191
Still an asshole.
Three promotions.

17
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,893
Thanks for keeping track.

18
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,763
What can I say? I'm a fan.

19
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,034
You mind?

20
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,205
Good luck.

21
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,457
- Am I late?
- Just a bit.

22
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,561
It's good to see you, ray.

23
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,063
Well, it's...

24
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,068
I see your filing system
hasn't changed much.

25
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,405
The wheels of justice turn
slowly, but they do turn.

26
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,907
And look at you.

27
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,578
Up on the fifth floor.

28
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,249
<i>We will do whatever
is necessary to protect America.</i>

29
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:20,485
<i>But make no mistake. The resolve
of our great nation is being...</i>

30
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,523
Fax went down again.

31
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,261
Hello, al-fawid.

32
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,930
Now be a good little terrorist

33
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:35,500
and just hand over some yellow-cake
uranium in broad daylight,

34
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,202
and we're all set.

35
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,704
Amen.

36
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,174
Erectile dysfunction hotline.

37
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,543
How can I direct your call?

38
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,778
Not at all. Have a good day.

39
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,880
Attaboy, bumpy. Give 'em hell.

40
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,982
You really are a moron, bumpy.
You know that?

41
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,685
Siefert, you keep
throwing that term around,

42
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,521
but I'm not sure you know
what it actually means.

43
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,191
It's a medical term. Did you know that?
Is that right?

44
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,893
It means someone with an
IQ between 50 and 69.

45
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,030
An imbecile is someone
with an IQ between 49 and 20.

46
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:09,968
And an idiot, which I think is the word you're
looking for, is someone who scores below 19.

47
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,671
Hmm. What do you call
someone who's dumber than that?

48
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,139
Lieutenant. Lieutenant.

49
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,510
Where you going?
I'm wanted in photo.

50
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,512
Chin up. Shoulders back.

51
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,716
<i>Pakistani Taliban
are increasingly upping</i>

52
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,818
<i>their fight to cross the border.</i>

53
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,555
<i>This is one of their recent propaganda
videos shot in Afghanistan.</i>

54
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,994
<i>In a barbaric act, they murder a
man they claim is an Afghan spy</i>

55
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,562
<i>working for NATO.</i>

56
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,064
Hi.

57
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,099
Hello.

58
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,203
Um, I'm, uh, ray.

59
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,905
Ray Kasten.

60
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,774
Claire. Claire Sloan.

61
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,510
Okay. It's nice to meet you.

62
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,578
Yes. Nice to meet you.

63
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,785
I guess we're the, uh,
new kids at school, huh?

64
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,853
Yep. Today is picture day.

65
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,723
Yeah.

66
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:08,527
That must be why I suddenly feel
like my mom picked out my outfit.

67
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,462
Oh.

68
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,932
- Have a great day.
- Thanks.

69
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,973
- You're bureau?
- Yeah. Field office, lower Manhattan.

70
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,676
I was transferred here to sit on
a mosque with the Da's office.

71
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,580
You?

72
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,216
I just got to the Da's
office, from Philly.

73
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,919
I'm second chair
of the homicide unit.

74
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:40,058
Well, that's a pretty stiff rank to
come in with. You must be a star.

75
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,160
No. Hardly.

76
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,932
Is this a temporary
assignment for you?

77
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,568
I don't know.

78
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,838
I guess that kinda depends
on the guys in the mosque.

79
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,808
Counselor?

80
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,845
Oh. Yes. Thank you.

81
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,416
Well, it was nice to meet you.
Yes.

82
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,518
Uh, Claire, yeah?

83
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,453
Yes. I'm ray. I
said that, right?

84
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,155
Mm-hmm. Okay.

85
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,957
Kasten. Ray Kasten.
Uh, ray Kasten, yeah.

86
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,992
FBI.

87
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,595
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

88
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,965
Give me one second. I just
want to adjust this light.

89
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,200
Yes. A picture's forever, right?

90
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,273
Ray Kasten.

91
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,478
So, how are you liking
Los Angeles?

92
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,281
I'm still just
finding my way around.

93
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,224
Okay, now your right collar, please?
Great.

94
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,430
Smile.

95
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,402
District attorney. My goodness.

96
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,237
It's lawyering.

97
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,908
Same as before, only more of it.

98
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,710
You wanna sit down?

99
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,881
And from here, where? Mayor?

100
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,817
No.

101
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,754
No more campaigns for a while.
I'm here, I'm happy.

102
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,423
Oh, you thinking of
governor already? Wow!

103
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:23,428
Well, I wanted to be head of security for the
Mets, but the position was already filled.

104
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,698
And, um, how's Ellis?

105
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,935
Fine. Yeah. The same... busy.

106
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,671
Any kids? Kids? No.

107
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,109
No, never the right time.

108
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,778
What about you?

109
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,112
Oh, no. Same.

110
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,518
Mind if I close the door?

111
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,257
- Ray?
- Jess.

112
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,192
Jesus! How are you?

113
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,630
How are you?

114
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,399
I'm good. I'm good. You?

115
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:05,203
Oh, I'm... I'm fine. I'm f...

116
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,738
I was just congratulating cl...

117
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,407
Well, you made
chief investigator, right?

118
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,942
So I'm...

119
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,145
I'm looking at royalty here.

120
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,747
You still living in Moorpark?

121
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,282
Yes.

122
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,318
It's quiet out there.
I like the quiet.

123
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,786
You still bureau?

124
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,456
No. No, I went private sector.

125
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,360
Badge kinda
lost its charm for me.

126
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,734
I'll let you two...
No, no, no. Stay.

127
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,335
Please.

128
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,371
This is about you.

129
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,575
I found him, Jess.

130
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,912
I found Marzin.

131
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,043
All right. Here you go.
Thank you.

132
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,213
Psst.

133
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,215
You could just ask
her out, you know.

134
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,553
Who said I wanted
to ask her out?

135
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,800
Christ.
An unrequited office romance.

136
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,202
The cliché of it doesn't bother you?
Jess.

137
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:49,174
Uh, have a little respect.
She's engaged.

138
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,643
You know? This is...

139
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,211
It's inappropriate.

140
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:03,722
The beauty from Harvard law and the blue-collar
fed from the wrong side of Brooklyn.

141
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,392
So sad. Don't be a dick, Jess.

142
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,063
Thank you, ray.

143
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,499
A sexist would've
called me something else.

144
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,568
Why? You're such a dick.

145
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,772
- Up. Let's go.
- Where's the fire?

146
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,908
LAPD just found an unidentified
female body in a garage dumpster.

147
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,177
So, what's that
got to do with us?

148
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,747
Garage is next door
to our mosque, al-Ankara.

149
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,893
This is not good... mosque
turning into a crime scene.

150
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,429
Now al-fawid's gonna shut
everything down and go to ground.

151
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,133
Think positive, ray.
Maybe al-fawid did the murder.

152
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:51,436
We could arrest him without him
having to blow something up first.

153
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,639
I'll talk to my snitch. He knows
everything going on in that mosque.

154
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,776
Siefert, when are you gonna cough
that guy's name up already?

155
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,612
My curiosity is killing me.
Sorry, Cobb.

156
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,381
Golden rule of counterterrorism.
Remember?

157
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,983
Siefert, bumpy;
Protect the snitch.

158
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,420
<i>Four months after

Whoa! Dai's at a crime scene.

172
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,592
Things a little slow today, guys?
No subpoenas to serve?

173
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:51,396
You really are an idiot, Fierro.
Medically.

174
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,434
Impressive, huh? He was homicide
before he joined the bureau.

175
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,869
Be the ball, ray.

176
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,604
Be the ball, ray.

177
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,508
No purse, no ID.

178
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,977
Body appears to have been
bleached inside and out.

179
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,547
Take notes, fellas.
This is evidence collection.

180
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,116
Custodian reports seeing a
young man, possibly Arab,

181
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,985
leaving the scene about 10:30,

182
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,553
carrying his belongings.

183
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,622
Looked to be homeless. Was
he running or walking?

184
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,893
Didn't say. You mean,
you didn't ask.

185
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,530
I didn't do the interview.

186
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,012
Just 'cause they're Muslims
doesn't mean they're terrorists.

187
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,464
Wouldn't wanna stereotype
anybody, would we?

188
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,741
No, of course not.

189
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,777
G-give her some room.

190
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,283
They aren't even
spelling things right in here.

191
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,465
He's got a theory.

192
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,541
What is it?

193
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,110
It's Carolyn.

194
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,314
What?

195
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,983
I-it's Carolyn.
It's your daughter.

196
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,957
No!

197
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,959
No! Jess, Jess, Jess!

198
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:05,163
No! My girl!

199
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,270
No! No!

200
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,639
No! No!

201
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,675
Please! No!

202
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,680
Help me! Help me!

203
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:26,317
Oh, my god!

204
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,020
Oh, sweet girl.

205
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,513
It's my baby!

206
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,225
Where... is he?

207
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,627
He's on parole.

208
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,397
Just did 10 years.

209
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,232
Tracy. Armed robbery.

210
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,935
Under the name...

211
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,706
Clay Beckwith.

212
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,012
How did you find him?

213
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,415
Inmate photos hacked online.

214
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:33,851
696,000 Caucasian males
in the us prison system.

215
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,220
You can cycle through the
entire population in a year

216
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,890
if you look at 1,906
faces every night.

217
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,592
- So that's what I did.
- For a year?

218
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,430
For 13 years.

219
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,298
Started the day I left here.

220
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,603
The, uh... the nose is
different, and the eyes.

221
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,506
Yeah. Must've had surgery.

222
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,875
Makes sense, given what he did.
And contact lenses.

223
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,243
But the ages sync up.

224
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,848
Beckwith's 33,
Marzin 20 when we lost him.

225
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,119
What do you want?

226
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,321
Reopen it.

227
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,159
I'm without portfolio now. I can't
exactly contact the guy's po.

228
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,697
Jess?

229
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,914
Surveillance video shows a gray Van
entering this garage at 10:27,

230
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,816
leaving 20 minutes later.

231
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,053
Same Van that was reported
stolen three days ago.

232
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,426
She have any errands in the
neighborhood or appointments?

233
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:52,163
I don't know. Where are we?

234
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,065
We're at the mosque.

235
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,566
Oh.

236
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,340
Would she take her car?

237
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:06,177
She didn't tell me what
she was... doing this morning

238
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,180
because she always told me
about her morning

239
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,415
at lunchtime.

240
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,817
<i>Jess?</i>

241
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,991
I thought if I ever found him, it
would just be me and him in an alley.

242
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,492
This is...

243
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,634
I don't think I have the stomach
to watch him walk away again.

244
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,369
This is Claire's shop now.

245
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,438
- Nobody torches it this time.
- Right. Easy.

246
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,642
Except the police would have to run point, and
we never did have an actual case against him.

247
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,377
- Well, maybe he confesses.
- Would you?

248
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:45,149
Maybe we could go about this
a little less officially.

249
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,884
I could call
the parole officer...

250
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:50,621
No, no, no. If we did this,
you couldn't be involved.

251
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:51,956
You know that.

252
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,693
- They're here.
- Yeah. Thank you.

253
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,698
- Should I tell them you'll be late?
- Be along in a minute, yeah.

254
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,436
- Good to see you, ray.
- Hey, Jess.

255
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,306
You can leave it open.

256
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,679
So, this is how
you waltz back in here?

257
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,314
I know.

258
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,584
I know.

259
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,489
Look at him.

260
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,358
Same guy.

261
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,329
We've had about 20 Marzin
sightings since you left.

262
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:34,699
All of them have been false alarms, and
Jess dies a little bit every time.

263
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,901
Claire, look at him.

264
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,004
You'd just be reopening a case.

265
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,007
For review. Under the radar.

266
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,742
That's all we'd be doing. Yeah.

267
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,378
Let's pretend that
that's all we'd be doing.

268
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,580
Claire, I have to...

269
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,583
I have to leave. I have
to leave in two weeks.

270
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,286
I gotta be back after the first.

271
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,022
Please help me do this.

272
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,457
It's everything.

273
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,060
Um, if you leave
your number at the desk,

274
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,196
I'll call you later.

275
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:06,464
Okay.

276
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,333
Okay.

277
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,342
You know...

278
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,713
You always did belong here.

279
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,482
So did you.

280
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,558
Kasten, call your office.
It's urgent.

281
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,161
Someone stole second base.

282
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,631
It's December, shithead.

283
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,995
I finished her room.

284
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,630
It's all packed.

285
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,607
Where will you go?

286
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,577
Someplace quiet.

287
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,581
Outside the city.

288
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,084
Just not here.

289
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,691
Homicide hasn't found
anything yet, have they?

290
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:16,494
They will.

291
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:19,397
- What are we hearing from the mosque?
- A lot of praying.

292
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,333
Not much else.

293
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,170
Did you find his Van?

294
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:27,738
No.

295
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,842
We found her car.

296
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,713
Where?

297
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,348
Outside a bakery.

298
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,586
- Was it broken into?
- No.

299
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,530
It's just...

300
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,333
We're talking about...

301
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,971
It's just impossible.

302
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,340
We're talking about Carolyn.

303
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,352
Um...

304
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,491
There's a lot of...

305
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,693
Stuff in the...
In the garage to pack.

306
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,542
She made some beautiful
things, didn't she?

307
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,479
Yeah.

308
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,484
Yeah, she did.

309
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,854
Who is this?

310
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,526
You ever see him
before that day?

311
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,762
I don't remember
seeing him<i> on</i> that day.

312
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,265
This is the office picnic, right?
Yeah.

313
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,501
She ever mention him to you?

314
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,835
Why would she?

315
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,710
Mind if I take this?

316
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,378
Sure.

317
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,414
Why?

318
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,353
I've seen this guy before.

319
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,900
Hey, bumpy. Hey.

320
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,502
Somebody here needs some help.

321
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,507
I always knew you'd be back.

322
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,710
- Great to see you, bump.
- You too.

323
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,380
Nothing like Christmas
in Los Angeles, huh?

324
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,382
Sleighs, snow-covered streets.

325
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:54,552
Are you up for a little field work?
Ray needs a few doors opened.

326
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:58,055
- Which ones?
- Old ones.

327
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,897
Guess I always knew
he'd be back too.

328
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,039
I'm not sure
how much use I'll be.

329
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,908
- I've been an indoor pet for a while now.
- I'll take my chances.

330
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,444
We ask anybody else,
red flags will go up.

331
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,680
Well, that's flattering.

332
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,951
Okay.

333
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,355
This time it sticks, right?

334
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,092
Thanks, bumpy.

335
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,634
That never got better?

336
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:45,803
- What?
- Your limp.

337
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,372
What limp?

338
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,874
Hey, bump. Yeah?

339
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,712
Who's this guy?

340
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,281
Who, the guy in blue? Yeah.

341
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,450
This is the office picnic, right?
Yeah.

342
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,785
Okay. Who's that? I don't know.

343
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,321
You didn't see him there? Yeah,
but I don't know who he is.

344
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,492
Hey, who's this guy?

345
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:09,827
No idea.

346
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:12,296
Dave. Yeah?

347
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,732
Who's this guy? You're
standing right by him.

348
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,166
Sorry.
He's standing right by you.

349
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,701
I don't know him.

350
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,639
Rupert. This guy.

351
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,107
You know him? Mm-mmm. No.

352
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,342
Hey, Siefert!

353
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:28,812
Siefert. Office picnic. This guy. He's
staring at Carolyn Cobb. Who is he?

354
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,683
What, are you
working homicide now?

355
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:35,119
You know the guy or not?

356
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,687
No.

357
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,857
Okay.

358
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:43,994
Okay, so a guy shows up at the office
picnic, except nobody saw him.

359
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,031
Half of you were there.
Nobody knows who he is.

360
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,565
Is that right?

361
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,768
This guy.

362
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,370
No? No.

363
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,041
Okay.

364
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,477
Let's do it this way.

365
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,680
I've seen this guy before, bump.

366
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,862
Hey.

367
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,264
Hey.

368
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,069
Can I give you some
unsolicited advice,

369
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,537
one cop to another?

370
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,676
You're kinda
crossing a line here.

371
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:35,045
You're using ct software
on a rape-murder case.

372
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,147
Things like that get noticed.

373
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,485
So I should, what,
ignore the lead? No.

374
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:45,389
You give the lead to the guys that are actually
investigating the case over at homicide.

375
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,491
You were brought here
to fight terrorism.

376
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:49,993
Well, her body was found next
to the hottest mosque in la.

377
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:53,197
What makes you think
I'm<i> not</i> fighting terrorism?

378
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:56,233
I'm just trying to spare you an
ass-kicking. Spare yourself.

379
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,603
Okay? Spare myself.

380
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,171
Right.

381
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,946
Goddamn it, I knew
I'd seen that guy before!

382
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,681
He's from the mosque!

383
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,088
God, I hope you're wrong
about this.

384
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,192
The idea that it could've been
someone connected to this office?

385
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,228
I don't think
I could live with that.

386
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,897
Who's the lead on this at LAPD?

387
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,732
Um, a detective named Guerrero.

388
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,934
Has he seen these? No.

389
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:34,972
No, I thought it might reflect badly on
the office, the guy being at the picnic,

390
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,641
so I wanted to show them
to you first.

391
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,276
Thank you. I appreciate it.

392
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,311
All right.

393
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,914
Leave all this with me.
Get back to your ct work.

394
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,049
I'll get this Guerrero
up to speed.

395
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,152
I can take care of that.
No, no, no.

396
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:51,121
Nothing should ever come before
your terrorism cases. Ever.

397
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:55,659
It's not a problem for me, sir,
to put out a field report.

398
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:58,395
I can explain things to him.
You know, one<i> vato</i> to another.

399
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:05,469
Well, the thing is, sir, because it's
Jess, I wanna bird-dog this one.

400
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:09,506
They teach you some version of "yes,
sir" at the bureau, don't they?

401
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,745
Yes, sir.

402
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,247
So?

403
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,326
Be careful in there. He's slick.

404
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,197
And unless I'm very wrong,
he's about to ask you to lunch.

405
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:35,165
Mean a lot to me if you said no.

406
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,201
How's Jess?

407
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,704
Did you find anything yet?

408
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,339
I did.

409
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,509
Aban Ghazala, the guy seen
running from the garage?

410
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,078
He'd been living down there.
Just confessed.

411
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,582
- Where is he?
- County.

412
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,187
Well, well, well. Our new star.

413
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,889
Come on in, Claire.

414
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,560
It's almost lunchtime.
Are you hungry?

415
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,541
Hey.

416
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,344
I wasn't here today, okay? We're
trying to assess him as a ct source.

417
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,579
We gotta keep it quiet.
Understood.

418
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,414
<i>"C" block, stand by.</i>

419
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,932
Ghazala?

420
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:49,539
You really are a dumb son of a bitch,
Siefert! Is that how cases get buried?

421
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,509
You find the nearest Muslim
and you ring him up?

422
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,579
You're protecting someone, Siefert,
and you're gonna tell me who it is!

423
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,414
Who are you protecting?

424
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,083
Just let me up!
Let me up, ray. Come on.

425
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,621
Jesus god.

426
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,301
I was just trying to
point you away from someone.

427
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:20,470
That guy in that stupid
picture of yours...

428
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:23,240
I can't have you questioning
him at the moment.

429
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:25,142
Why is that? Who is he?

430
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,612
- My snitch.
- Huh?

431
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:32,282
My guy in the al-Ankara mosque.

432
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:36,586
Th-the guy staring at Carolyn
Cobb is your snitch?

433
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,589
- I don't think he's your doer, Kasten.
- Introduce us. I'll ask him.

434
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:43,126
'Cause he is this close to
giving us a whole sleeper cell!

435
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,295
You don't spook a guy like that.

436
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,931
- What the hell you bring him to the picnic for?
- He's a wannabe.

437
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:51,301
The guy's got some fantasy
of being a cop someday.

438
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,738
So I brought him to the picnic, I let him feel
like a big shot. Anything to keep him happy.

439
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,048
Well, it worked. He found
his true love there.

440
00:32:57,074 --> 00:32:58,275
You don't know that.

441
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:01,578
I do know you tricked a phony confession
out of a guy who didn't do it!

442
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,314
My guy shuts down,
everybody loses!

443
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,383
A couple more buildings
come down maybe.

444
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,053
So I redirected things a bit.

445
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,589
Sorry.

446
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,194
He got a name?

447
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,698
You want me to send Jess
in here to ask you?

448
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,109
Anzor Marzin.

449
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:33,777
Street name's pac-man.

450
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,712
Where is he?

451
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:38,115
Where is he? Hey, I don't know.
Okay?

452
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:40,050
Maybe you can find him.

453
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,688
Okay.

454
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,926
When's the last time
you seen him?

455
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,796
Ten days.

456
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:59,569
Carolyn Cobb was killed 10 days ago.
What's that, a coincidence?

457
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:02,539
Detective on the case, Guerrero,
he know about all this?

458
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,043
Of course he does.

459
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:09,212
Guy understands the ugly truth.
Meaning what?

460
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,049
Meaning, someone
hands us good names,

461
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,583
his love life doesn't matter.

462
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,421
Jesus Christ!

463
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,823
All right.

464
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,326
All right, start writing.

465
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,029
Address.

466
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,331
His address, his girlfriend's
address, something useful.

467
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,501
Couldn't just let it go, huh?

468
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,405
A stripper, huh? Mm-hmm.

469
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:39,209
Well, that is exciting.
But she's not coming out.

470
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:42,012
She's coming out. Yeah, right.

471
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:44,881
And then Marzin's gonna pull
up in a stolen gray Van

472
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,851
with Carolyn's DNA under his
nails, and everybody wins.

473
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:51,455
You can forget about the Van.
We're not gonna find it.

474
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:54,191
You know what I like
about you, ray?

475
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,726
We're not even<i> pretending</i>
to do this right.

476
00:34:56,728 --> 00:35:00,197
Meet the detective who's
actually in charge? Screw that.

477
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,432
We're not just crossing the
line, we're burying it.

478
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,435
I don't need to know Guerrero
to know Guerrero.

479
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,005
I've seen guys
eat a case before.

480
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,278
I'm gonna go water that
bush over there, okay?

481
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:25,388
Swimming pools and movie stars.

482
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,798
Come on, moose.

483
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,616
Nice stealth.

484
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:55,619
Well, if you had evidence on this asshole,
we could warrant him like professionals.

485
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,487
Hey, bump.
Get the door, will ya?

486
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,121
All right, check upstairs.
I'll watch the door.

487
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,941
Did you find... Jesus!

488
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,644
Shit. You scared the hell out of me.
I scared<i> you?</i>

489
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:04,814
What the hell are you sneaking up
on me for? Sorry. Did I wake you?

490
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,550
There's nothing upstairs.
Anything down here?

491
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:10,720
I don't know. Maybe.

492
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,122
Wow, this guy can really draw.

493
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,658
Shit!

494
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,394
What are you bitching about?
I gave you a cookie.

495
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:18,928
Go, go, go, go, go.

496
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:25,135
Get up there. I'm trying.
Move that trash can.

497
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,203
Damn it!

498
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,007
Ouch! That is a bad bite.

499
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:34,811
He looked rabid to me. Probably gonna die.
We need to get back in there.

500
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,347
Why, to see
how the comic book turns out?

501
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,882
Yeah, obviously.

502
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,787
Yeah, I guess
that would be huge. Epic.

503
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,822
Probably a lot
of clues in there.

504
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,360
You didn't take it, bump.

505
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:53,797
Pork rinds look pretty good. You couldn't
have taken it. Nobody'd be that stupid.

506
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:55,765
Yeah, well, how about a Twinkie?

507
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:00,003
You hungry? You want a Twinkie?
Bump?

508
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,640
Ohh.

509
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,709
Happy birthday! Dipshit.

510
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:08,945
What? She's not gonna miss it. She tells him
someone was there, he never comes back!

511
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:12,449
What's your brilliant idea? Leave it
on the bed? At least now we have it.

512
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,984
Do me a favor, okay?
Let me run point on this.

513
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:18,221
I'll put an extra dollar in
your paycheck, I swear to god.

514
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:19,756
Suit yourself.

515
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,028
All right, let me have it.

516
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,297
Thought you didn't want it.
Bump, give me...

517
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:29,466
Bumpy, give me the...

518
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,801
Give me the...

519
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,241
Well, it looks like
you won another convert.

520
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:41,711
Po took one look at those
pictures, said, "yep, same guy."

521
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,313
What else he say?

522
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:44,848
Said he knows him as Beckwith.

523
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:49,552
Never heard him called Marzin
or pac-man or anything else.

524
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,189
Beckwith checked in two weeks after
release, then skipped two weeks ago.

525
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:56,092
I asked if he had any hobbies,
you know, like drawing,

526
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,194
or if he ever talked
about baseball.

527
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,929
No and no.

528
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:04,434
But he does seem to like horses.
The racing kind.

529
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:06,536
Talks about them all the time.

530
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:10,373
In an unhealthy kind of way,
according to the po.

531
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,009
He has sort of a fixation.

532
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:16,880
Uh, said, "if I had the time to do
it, I'd look for him at the track."

533
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:20,683
Horses might be the only thing he
likes as much as stealing cars."

534
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,216
Hey.

535
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:59,722
Your table, as I recall.

536
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,860
He skipped parole, didn't he?
Your Beckwith.

537
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,398
Wasn't much of a surprise.

538
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,800
Why?

539
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,836
And the po
doesn't recall Beckwith

540
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,305
having a particular talent
for drawing, does he?

541
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:18,408
His name's Marzin. Not Beckwith.

542
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,312
This why you called me here?

543
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,747
Just trying to Gauge
the value of your leads.

544
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:27,750
Thank you. But they're my leads.

545
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:30,253
And she was my kid.

546
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,122
Jess.

547
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:36,593
It's not gonna be
like last time.

548
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:38,995
We find the guy, he goes down.

549
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,831
You shouldn't make promises like that.
I can make that promise.

550
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,868
You know, everybody's asking
me, since you're back,

551
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,936
"who is this guy?

552
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,939
What is it with his obsession
with your daughter?"

553
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:53,877
And I say, "well, he's a friend.
He's a badge."

554
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:57,881
They say, "yeah? Then where's
he been the last 13 years?"

555
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:02,085
I was supposed to meet Carolyn
in that bakery the day she...

556
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:10,193
She was gonna have a...
A party for your birthday.

557
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,062
I told her I'd meet her there

558
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:15,131
and pay for the cake.

559
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,166
Last minute I begged off,

560
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,135
after she'd
already gotten there.

561
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,638
I had...

562
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,641
I had some case work to file.

563
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,046
Two hours later, we found her.

564
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,921
That's where I've been
the last 13 years.

565
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,136
What happened to Siefert's face?

566
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,439
Hell if I know.

567
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,842
I was hoping for a
better answer than that.

568
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,612
Well, I don't spend that much time
thinking about Siefert's face.

569
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:05,448
Assaulting an officer?

570
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,017
Where the hell
were you and bumpy yesterday?

571
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:11,521
You do that in court? You
spin your chain like that?

572
00:43:11,523 --> 00:43:14,457
- I do it when I'm anxious. You're making me anxious.
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?

573
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:17,126
Because I caught the case.
Ghazala.

574
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,763
Morales put me on it.

575
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,968
Of course he did.
That son of a bitch.

576
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,906
You're being taken, Claire.
Ghazala's not your guy.

577
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:32,976
You're gonna have to explain that.
There's a snitch.

578
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:35,445
He's working al-Ankara mosque.
His name's Marzin.

579
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:37,747
He's also a person of
interest on Carolyn Cobb.

580
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:41,951
And everybody's running around, trying
to blow this thing up. He's the doer!

581
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,621
Siefert squeezes a phony confession out of
Ghazala and the snitch stays untouched.

582
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:46,956
'Cause he's working ct for<i> us.</i>

583
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,993
Now he turns up as the
rapist-murderer of a cop's kid?

584
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:52,261
No. No, can't be the guy.

585
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:55,765
Morales has assured me that this
case has the highest priority.

586
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:57,700
Yeah. And Guantánamo's
a club med resort.

587
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,576
Hey, Jess.

588
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,718
- What you got there?
- Oh, it's nothing.

589
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:21,524
It's not for you.
That's not what I hear.

590
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,995
- Sorry.
- Is he the guy?

591
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,199
He's<i> a</i> guy.

592
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,636
That's all we know.

593
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:36,673
Anything in there indicate a
predilection for violence?

594
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:38,841
It's a comic book.

595
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,343
They're all violent.

596
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:45,114
- Can I see it?
- Jess, you shouldn't be here.

597
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,785
Anything you touch
is inadmissible.

598
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,394
- Can I see it?
- No.

599
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,932
Ray.

600
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:33,262
You have to be honest.
That's the only rule.

601
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:36,032
- 'Cause she's good at this.
- All right. Okay.

602
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:38,501
The truth and nothing but the truth.
Wow. I'm ready.

603
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:40,570
Fear not. This is beautiful, by the way.
Thank you.

604
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,505
You're welcome. It's beautiful.

605
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:46,743
Okay. So, are you looking
for a professional type?

606
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,379
Struggling actress type?

607
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:51,514
A what?

608
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:54,016
Nurturing schoolteacher type?

609
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:57,353
I'm... I'm willing to
cast a wide net, so...

610
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:59,255
- Very wise. Very wise.
- Thank you.

611
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:03,359
Uh, how about tall?
Short? Other?

612
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:06,763
No preference? There's no
preference, as long as she's smart.

613
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:10,032
- How smart?
- Preferably Harvard-educated.

614
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,634
Oh. Okay.

615
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:13,770
From Philly. Hmm.

616
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,272
- Who's a prosecutor.
- I see.

617
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,940
Named Claire.

618
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:23,079
That might narrow the field a bit.
That's very good. Very good.

619
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:24,947
What can I say?
What<i> can</i> you say?

620
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,987
You look a little quiet
all of a sudden.

621
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,457
Claire.

622
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:38,561
I think you should know
that I can't rein her in.

623
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:41,230
She's not gonna stop
till she finds this guy.

624
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:45,201
You never saw Jess and her kid.
They were inseparable.

625
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,571
Yeah.

626
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:50,339
I can imagine.

627
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,015
I know it's messy.
I mean, working ct.

628
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:01,851
But we gotta find this guy
before Jess does. Okay?

629
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:06,522
I'll work it at night,
under the radar.

630
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:08,991
Morales doesn't have to know.

631
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,130
I can't tell you what to do
with your free time.

632
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:18,201
My legal advice would be,
find that Van.

633
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:19,936
Thank you.

634
00:47:19,938 --> 00:47:21,404
Good night.

635
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,475
Uh, let me walk you to your car.

636
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:30,379
You don't have to do that. No,
I'd like to, if you don't mind.

637
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,782
Something about garages lately.

638
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:36,052
So, when's the big day? Hmm?

639
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:39,522
Oh. Um, sometime next year.

640
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,993
Congratulations. Oh.

641
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:45,728
What's he do?

642
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,397
He manages a hedge fund
in Philly.

643
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:50,366
His name is Ellis.

644
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,237
So, what, is he...
He moving here?

645
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,672
That's the plan.

646
00:47:56,674 --> 00:48:01,477
Is that a hard thing to do, to manage a hedge
fund in Philly when you're living in la?

647
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,980
Might be.

648
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:07,316
But he's pretty clever.
I bet he is.

649
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:09,585
Ellis is a pretty clever name.

650
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:11,487
And love conquers all, right?

651
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,824
That's me.

652
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,561
See you tomorrow.

653
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,404
Jess is lucky to have you, ray.

654
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,706
You're a good friend.

655
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:33,709
She'd do the same for me.

656
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:35,278
She'd do more.

657
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,312
God, this guy could be anywhere.

658
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,950
All right,
I want to see the stables.

659
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:16,319
What the hell for?

660
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:18,220
That's where the horses are.

661
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,585
I love you, baby boy.

662
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,421
Ain't you?

663
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,835
Look at you.

664
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,338
Bump.

665
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,708
I'll be damned.

666
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,211
You like that?

667
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:18,547
All right then. Shh.

668
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,717
Hey.

669
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,623
Hey, buddy.

670
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,132
Nice work on the face, pac-man.
I like it.

671
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,634
And you are?

672
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,904
You don't remember me?

673
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:44,373
Let's talk.

674
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,810
Call it in!

675
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,436
Ray.

676
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:17,173
Where did he get you?
I had him, bump.

677
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,276
That was Marzin.

678
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:23,079
It's okay. This is Luis.

679
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,203
He says the guy is here
all the time boosting cars.

680
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:26,207
The guy got a name?

681
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,285
I-I don't talk to him.

682
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:31,411
I don't like the way
he looks at the horses.

683
00:51:31,437 --> 00:51:32,922
You got a cell phone, Luis?

684
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,457
Huh?

685
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:35,991
Give it to me.

686
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,628
The guy comes in again,

687
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:45,201
text 911 to this number

688
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:46,735
and I'll be here.

689
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,537
Bump, will ya? Yeah.

690
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:51,307
I got it.

691
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:52,808
It's him, all right.

692
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,610
Oh, yeah.

693
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,113
Son of a bitch.

694
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:58,647
Thanks, Luis.

695
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,496
- Hi.
- Oh!

696
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:16,132
Um...

697
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:19,068
I was waiting for... I'm sorry.
Oh. No.

698
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:21,904
It's fine. Is there
anything I can...

699
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:25,441
Well, I was just gonna see if you wanted
me to walk you to your car again.

700
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:27,643
Oh.

701
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,079
I wasn't ready to leave yet.

702
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:32,414
Neither was I.

703
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:38,487
- Something making you nervous?
- Oh, this.

704
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,990
It's a... It's a silly habit.

705
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,827
It's kind of endearing,
if you ask me.

706
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,665
Then it's yours.

707
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,336
Well, you need it
more than I do anyway.

708
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,005
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

709
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:03,946
You sure you can live without it? I know
how you heady types tend to obsess.

710
00:53:03,948 --> 00:53:07,049
That's right.
Obsessing is awful.

711
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:10,753
Hope it never happens to you.

712
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,060
Let me, uh...

713
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,463
I-I...

714
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,533
I like the one on
page 90, by the way.

715
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:28,737
I mean, I don't know,
but I think you...

716
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:31,106
You'd break hearts
in that dress.

717
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:33,876
That's sweet.

718
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,980
Yeah, really sweet, ray.
Come with me.

719
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,316
Uh, would you excuse us, Claire?

720
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,222
Please tell me
I've been misinformed.

721
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:50,159
Please tell me no one from this office
broke into the home of a stripper

722
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:52,695
to steal a comic book

723
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:56,265
in some half-assed attempt at making
a case against a prime ct asset.

724
00:53:56,267 --> 00:54:00,436
There's a case to be made, sir. -With
a picture from a picnic as evidence.

725
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:03,439
And no participation from the
actual cop investigating the case.

726
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:07,576
This how you do things
in New York? Hmm?

727
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,546
No warrant. You just
surveil whomever you wish.

728
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:12,915
My sense was that your enthusiasm
for the target was low, sir.

729
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,384
I'll tell you what's lower...

730
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:19,054
My "enthusiasm" for
witnessing another 9/11.

731
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:20,956
Jesus Christ.

732
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:24,193
Everybody knows those
assholes want to hit la next!

733
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:27,796
Half the families in my neighborhood
are buying duct tape and Hazmat suits!

734
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:29,416
You don't even have a
case against this guy!

735
00:54:29,442 --> 00:54:31,033
You don't have his Van.
You don't have shit!

736
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:32,735
If I did, would you file?

737
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:34,637
No, I'd let a
rapist-murderer go free!

738
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,105
Jess is a friend of mine.

739
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:39,275
You'd charge him,
politics aside?

740
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:42,544
And while you're doing this, how
many ct leads are going unpursued?

741
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:46,215
How many hurdles are you placing between
Marzin and his ultimate use to us,

742
00:54:46,217 --> 00:54:47,950
which is intel on the mosque?

743
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:51,086
If I had evidence on him tying him
to Carolyn Cobb, you'd charge him?

744
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:52,788
Of course!

745
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,857
- I have your word on that?
- Did I just stutter?

746
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,464
And by the way,

747
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,000
Harvard law doesn't date
community college.

748
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:07,970
Stop hitting on my new hire.
You're embarrassing yourself.

749
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:15,577
You were always beautiful,
but so ambitious.

750
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,048
I prefer "determined."

751
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,918
Political.

752
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,853
Collegial.

753
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,257
Oblivious.

754
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,562
I think you like looking
back more than I do.

755
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,231
I don't have the time for it.

756
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,668
Okay. Let's look forward.

757
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,538
Okay, let's.

758
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,774
- I think you should go back to New York.
- Why?

759
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:49,144
Because I don't like where this is going, and I
can't justify it for a case that isn't there.

760
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:53,682
Oh, it's there. I got two broken
ribs from a shovel says it's there.

761
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,684
That was Marzin.

762
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,053
- I need two more men.
- What?

763
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:02,024
Bumpy's on one leg, and truth is
I don't move like I used to.

764
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,960
Come on, ray. You move
exactly like you used to.

765
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:10,032
They don't have to be big men.

766
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,600
Get out.

767
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,404
I mean it. Go home.

768
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:17,339
I can't.

769
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,742
9/11 was just the beginning.

770
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:24,046
Protect your home, please.
Protect your family.

771
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,215
Bin laden, Saddam Hussein...

772
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,016
They have Anthrax now.

773
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:32,688
Bump. What is it? You said
you had a lead on Marzin.

774
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,223
We do. "We"?

775
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:35,724
Come here.

776
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,307
- Hey, Jess.
- I hate the death penalty.

777
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,112
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

778
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:59,915
Death would be too good
for this guy.

779
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:03,552
A big meal and
a... shot and a nap.

780
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:06,355
Let him rot in jail,
live a life full of nothing.

781
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,857
Uh-huh.

782
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,163
- What we doing here, guys?
- Waiting for him.

783
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,400
He's been here? He will be.

784
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:20,536
Bumpy and I figured it out.

785
00:57:20,538 --> 00:57:22,971
Jess, you come within a mile of
this guy, we never make a case.

786
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,107
He can quit his job,
he can change his name,

787
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:29,111
he can dump his car,
but I will still find him.

788
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:32,080
'Cause there's one thing
you can't change,

789
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:33,615
and it's right here.

790
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,220
Are you drunk?

791
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:40,956
<i>The justifier</i> by pac-man Marzin.

792
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:44,493
Page one, first character...

793
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:47,896
A monster hunter
named Alston Sherry.

794
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:49,465
Bumpy? Alston.

795
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,834
Could that be Walter Alston,

796
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:54,636
the winningest manager
in the history of the Dodgers?

797
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,105
He won four world series titles,
three of 'em here in la.

798
00:57:57,107 --> 00:58:00,476
And Sherry. Larry Sherry?

799
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,744
The MVP of the '59 world series.

800
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:05,848
That's the first championship
here in la.

801
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:09,284
Not that it matters, but he had two
wins and two saves in that series.

802
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:11,186
Page two.

803
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:14,189
Alston's partner,
named bulldog O'Malley.

804
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,625
- Bump?
- Walter O'Malley?

805
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:19,995
The owner who brought the
Dodgers to la from Brooklyn.

806
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:23,265
- Man was a Saint.
- You seeing a pattern here, ray?

807
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:26,268
How about "bulldog," huh?
Orel "bulldog" Hershiser?

808
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,972
Star of the last dodger team that won
a series, '88? Before we sucked.

809
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:32,007
So, why are we here, bumpy?

810
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,711
'Cause this is the place
where ex-Dodgers hang out.

811
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:37,746
And all the crazies know it.

812
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:44,520
And by the way, the monster that
O'Malley and Sherry are chasing

813
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:46,788
is orange and black.

814
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:50,225
You know, the colors worn
by that, uh, team up north.

815
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,294
Think I'd have noticed that
a little sooner.

816
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:54,062
Don't beat yourself up, bump.

817
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:55,531
Think blue.

818
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:57,232
See?

819
00:58:57,234 --> 00:59:00,569
Passions... are like maps.

820
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,239
Take me, for example.

821
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,741
Carolyn is...

822
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:09,912
<i>Was...</i>

823
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:14,750
The thing that made me me.

824
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,387
Nothing will ever change that.

825
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:23,825
Take you. The way you keep
thinking about Claire.

826
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:26,361
It's a lost cause.

827
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:27,930
But you don't give up.

828
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:34,069
Passion always wins.

829
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:37,239
So I will be here
every night from now on.

830
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,776
He'll come here.

831
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,113
Kind of a long shot.

832
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:47,316
Crazy. I know.

833
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:52,354
Sort of like building
a whole case

834
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:56,124
around a picture
from an office picnic.

835
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,796
But you look at enough faces,

836
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:03,532
you're bound to find
the one you're looking for.

837
01:00:03,534 --> 01:00:05,334
Eventually, right?

838
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:16,812
So, when's the next game?

839
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,606
<i>This capacity crowd
coming to life now</i>

840
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:47,909
<i>as the Dodgers have
gotten off the mat.</i>

841
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:50,612
<i>Onlinger checks the runner,
rocks and deals.</i>

842
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:53,315
<i>Way outside. Ball four.</i>

843
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,785
<i>And that fast, manager Dave
Mcdaniels out of the dugout,</i>

844
01:00:56,787 --> 01:00:58,787
<i>on his way to the mound.</i>

845
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:02,524
<i>We'll see if he's bringing
a hook with him.</i>

846
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:06,995
<i>The 2002 met bullpen has not
been particularly impressive.</i>

847
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,371
Yo, buddy, sit down!

848
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:21,009
Sit down!

849
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,731
- I'm looking for my uncle.
- Yeah, and I'm trying to watch the game.

850
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,817
You know, after 10 nights of this,
I'm ready to learn something.

851
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:30,519
Bump.

852
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:33,121
Ten rows up, seven guys in.

853
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,659
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
- Okay.

854
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:40,395
<i>Now batting, number 11,</i>

855
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:43,532
<i>shortstop Drew Sagano.</i>

856
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:48,003
Excuse me.

857
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:49,905
<i>The Dodgers sending
the go-ahead run to the plate.</i>

858
01:01:49,907 --> 01:01:52,307
Sir. Excuse me. Excuse me.

859
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:55,711
Hey, Marzin! Hey! Hey!

860
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:57,345
Sorry.

861
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:59,648
Down in front.

862
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,850
Let's go. Come on, move!

863
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:05,587
<i>Onlinger ready to go back to
work now, checking the runners.</i>

864
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,361
Bump! With me!

865
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:14,796
<i>Delivers. Belted.</i>

866
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:22,671
Out of the way!

867
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,618
Bump! Check down there!

868
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,121
Hey, Kennedy, shield the exits!
Over there!

869
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,528
<i>Long trek back out to the mound.</i>

870
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:50,132
<i>Suddenly, on the wrong side
of a one-run game,</i>

871
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:52,434
<i>history repeating itself...</i>

872
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,137
- What the hell, bro!
- Jesus.

873
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,476
<i>The crowd refusing to sit</i>

874
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:04,880
<i>until Sagano emerges
to take a curtain call.</i>

875
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:06,481
Aah! God!

876
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,486
Move!

877
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,231
I got the suspect. Hey!

878
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:24,566
Stop! Marzin, stop!

879
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:26,802
Marzin!

880
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,840
Goddamn it!

881
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:36,578
You okay?

882
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,847
- Get him!
- Suspect is...

883
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:11,546
Hey!

884
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:14,249
Hold it right there!

885
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,890
Get out of the way!

886
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,571
You got him? Yeah.

887
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:40,075
Stay where you are.
Son of a bitch!

888
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,016
<i>The Dodgers, nine games back and
left for dead just 30 days ago,</i>

889
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:49,818
<i>can see daylight now.</i>

890
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:52,187
<i>Just a half a game back
in the west,</i>

891
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:55,223
<i>with a 6-5 lead
in the bottom of the eighth.</i>

892
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,759
<i>Quite a night.</i>

893
01:04:57,761 --> 01:04:59,861
What are you trying to do,

894
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:01,763
get yourself suspended,
sent back to New York?

895
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:04,332
We didn't know the guy would run.
It was a baseball game.

896
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:06,902
We were just there to ask him a
couple of questions, but then he ran!

897
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:09,337
Don't do that to me. Don't talk
to me like you talk to Morales.

898
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:11,006
I know what you
were there to do.

899
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:13,074
- What were we supposed to do, let him go?
- Yes.

900
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,110
We don't have anything on him.
I want him released.

901
01:05:15,112 --> 01:05:16,878
You don't wanna
question him first? No!

902
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,547
I want him advised of his rights
and released before morales...

903
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:22,083
Morales will file
if I can make a case.

904
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,519
And Marzin already knows his rights.
He's here voluntarily.

905
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:27,389
He'll confess! I just
gotta work him a little.

906
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:30,592
Meaning waterboarding?
No, meaning conversation.

907
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:34,129
Five minutes. If you don't
think he's the doer, he walks.

908
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:35,964
Claire.

909
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,766
Claire, come on.
We can't just let him go.

910
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:40,101
What are you doing? I'm sorry.

911
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,003
I'm sorry.

912
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:45,407
I'm begging you.

913
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:48,543
I'm begging<i> you.</i>

914
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:55,250
I just wanna remind you

915
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:57,118
that you're here
of your own volition.

916
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,722
You're free to go at any time.

917
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:05,493
"Volition."

918
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:08,263
That's a great word.

919
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:11,633
I think I'm gonna use that
someday, when I'm a cop.

920
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:14,102
You understand your rights.
Yeah.

921
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:16,137
Is this about the mosque?

922
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,672
No.

923
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,778
This is about Carolyn Cobb.

924
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,014
Who?

925
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:27,515
Carolyn Cobb.

926
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:31,653
Mmm.

927
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,758
I never met her.

928
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,094
I don't remember this picture.

929
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,465
Where is this?
It's the office picnic.

930
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:47,369
You were the guest of Reggie
Siefert, your rabbi in here,

931
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:50,038
your godfather.

932
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,476
Oh, yeah, yeah. I came for the
picnic for 10 minute, maybe.

933
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:57,278
Music was shit.

934
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,882
That... is that a Glock 9?

935
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:02,717
That's standard issue, right?

936
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:07,055
Why did you run from us?

937
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:09,124
You serious?

938
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:11,526
I'm ratting on the sickest
sleeper cell in la.

939
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:15,296
I get spotted chatting with
two cops, I'm a dead man.

940
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,167
Wait.

941
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:21,403
Are you the guys
who took my comic book?

942
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,372
Yeah, fuckhead.

943
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:28,410
I'm the guy that took
your comic book.

944
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,914
Carolyn Cobb.

945
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:38,053
I think you raped her
and killed her, pac-man.

946
01:07:38,055 --> 01:07:39,854
Hmm.

947
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:41,823
Yeah, that would be smart

948
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:44,325
'cause I don't have enough
heat on me as it is, do I?

949
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:46,061
So...

950
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:48,563
I think you met her
at the picnic,

951
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,032
convinced yourself that she
was interested in you,

952
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:54,736
and then maybe after a couple
of days following her around,

953
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,939
you went up to her,
declared your undying love,

954
01:07:57,941 --> 01:07:59,841
and when she told you
to piss off,

955
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:02,610
you raped her and killed her and
dumped her body in the trash,

956
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:06,948
doused in bleach.

957
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,550
- Bleach?
- Where'd you hide the Van?

958
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:12,087
I'm... I'm trying to do good.

959
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:14,289
Pretty girl. Okay, you
should be thanking me.

960
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,525
I'm not even saying I'm blaming
you for taking the shot.

961
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,196
Excuse me. Yeah.

962
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:28,369
You need to walk away. He has
a lawyer in the building.

963
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:31,206
- He hasn't made any calls.
- He has friends here, remember?

964
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,611
Look, I just need
a few more minutes.

965
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:50,492
No, that won't be necessary.

966
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:52,994
Mr. Marzin has been a very
good friend to this office.

967
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:54,796
I thought I made that
clear to you.

968
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,631
May I see the file, please?

969
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:01,369
Hmm.

970
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:10,245
Mr. Marzin.

971
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:13,148
You're free to go. We're sorry
if we've inconvenienced you.

972
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:15,683
This is not your doer.
How do you know?

973
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:22,123
Read the file. Carolyn Cobb,
5'7", 130 pounds, an athlete.

974
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:25,126
"The damage to the right parietal
bone and left mandible of the victim

975
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:30,498
indicated that the attacker was of
extraordinary physical strength."

976
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:34,169
You see? We're looking
for a brute, not a kid.

977
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:38,473
You can't overpower a girl like that with
two noodles for arms. It's laughable.

978
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:41,442
And then, of course,
there's the bleach.

979
01:09:41,444 --> 01:09:43,811
A clear sign of premeditation.

980
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:47,849
Your killer knew enough to douse the
victim thoroughly inside and out

981
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,984
so as to destroy
all the DNA evidence.

982
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:52,153
Now, that takes smarts.
It takes strategic thinking.

983
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:54,022
What is your level
of education, Mr. Marzin?

984
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:58,660
What is it, high school?
Less than that?

985
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,795
We're looking for an intellect.

986
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:04,065
This one likes to sit in his room
and draw comic books with monsters

987
01:10:04,067 --> 01:10:06,401
and maybe Jack off
to the posters on his wall.

988
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:12,073
Which brings me to the final
piece of exculpatory evidence.

989
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:14,309
Which means, Mr. Marzin,

990
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:17,979
evidence which proves
your innocence of the charge.

991
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:20,481
"Examination of
the decedent's vaginal walls

992
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:22,984
indicate injuries
at a depth of nine inches."

993
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:26,754
We're looking for someone
with a hammer,

994
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:28,356
not a peanut.

995
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:33,595
- You have no idea what he...
- Women always know.

996
01:10:33,597 --> 01:10:36,264
Men carry themselves one way,
boys another.

997
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:39,601
Don't they?
Don't they, Mr. Marzin?

998
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,606
And that right there.

999
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:47,942
Trying to look down my blouse.
That's something a boy would do.

1000
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:53,214
So you run along, little one.

1001
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:56,084
You run along.

1002
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:58,786
We're sorry for the mix-up.

1003
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,752
"Peanut."

1004
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:33,821
Is that what you said,
you cocky bitch?

1005
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:37,225
Gosh. How impressive.

1006
01:11:37,227 --> 01:11:39,394
Am I swooning?

1007
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,964
Go home, loser.

1008
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,966
Draw yourself
some more monsters.

1009
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:47,602
- You want some of this, bitch?
- We're done here.

1010
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:49,337
- You want what she got?
- What?

1011
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:51,105
Here's what she got!

1012
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,474
You don't touch her!
You don't touch her!

1013
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,343
You don't touch her!

1014
01:11:55,345 --> 01:11:58,079
Son of a... you don't touch her!
I'll kill you!

1015
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,081
Ray! Ray!

1016
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:02,483
- Goddamn it!
- Ray! Ray, enough!

1017
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,320
Ray! Ray. It's okay.
Get off! Ray!

1018
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:07,889
It's okay. Ray!

1019
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,692
Ray! It's okay.

1020
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:12,827
He said it!

1021
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:15,263
You okay? We got him.

1022
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,340
Lock him up.

1023
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:33,748
Oh, god. You okay? You okay?

1024
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,349
You're letting him go,
aren't you?

1025
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:43,418
You think I'm stupid, sir?

1026
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,787
That's two questions. Which one
do you want me to answer first?

1027
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:47,722
- Hello, Claire.
- You and I had an understanding!

1028
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:50,224
Yes, that you would bring me a case.
But you don't have one.

1029
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:52,593
Just this half-assed
confession from Marzin,

1030
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,295
who claims it was beaten
out of him.

1031
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:56,631
- And he's got the injuries to prove it!
- He attacked Claire!

1032
01:13:56,633 --> 01:13:59,066
You want me to trade a whole
mosque full of potential arrests

1033
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:01,235
for a comic book and a
picture from a picnic?

1034
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:04,138
Put me in the goddamn mosque! I'll
get you more names than he will!

1035
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,874
If that'll get you
out of my office.

1036
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,078
You looked me right in the eye.
You told me you'd prosecute.

1037
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,817
I also told you nothing comes before our
efforts in counterterrorism. Nothing!

1038
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:19,654
Now, you drop this right now or I'm sending
you back to the bureau! You understand me?

1039
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:21,622
That boy is officially
untouchable!

1040
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,492
Untouchable?

1041
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,829
He's guilty.

1042
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:30,164
Welcome to the war.

1043
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:37,772
There's a time to shut up, Claire, and
there's a time to tell your boss the truth.

1044
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:40,107
When he's being a horse's ass,
that's when you tell him the truth!

1045
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:42,677
You really turned him around in there.
You just knocked him flat.

1046
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:46,514
But it's your case!
We don't have a case!

1047
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:48,583
You wanna tell Jess that,
or should I?

1048
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:30,391
Son of a bitch! Ray. Ray.
Come on. Come on.

1049
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:46,941
Jess.

1050
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:06,160
Cover your ears.

1051
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,129
- What?
- You don't wanna hear this.

1052
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:11,098
Let's kill him.

1053
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:17,672
Let's kill him. Let's do it
now, before we lose him again.

1054
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:20,341
We just do it
and that's it. He goes.

1055
01:16:20,343 --> 01:16:22,443
Nobody will miss him.

1056
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:26,414
We'll make the case on the mosque
without him, and Carolyn gets to rest.

1057
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:29,250
And then what?

1058
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:33,120
What would a few bullets get me?
A lifetime in jail.

1059
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:36,424
So he dies
without ever serving a day,

1060
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:39,560
and I spend the next 50 years

1061
01:16:39,562 --> 01:16:40,995
envying him.

1062
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:44,498
Does that sound
like justice to you?

1063
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,443
You're both working for a liar.

1064
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:01,983
That's the trouble
with you, ray.

1065
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,820
You think that matters.

1066
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:52,500
So, then... Would 26 be too old?

1067
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,935
Yes. Who's the guy?

1068
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:58,472
- Would 25?
- <i>Who's the guy?</i>

1069
01:17:58,474 --> 01:18:01,208
<i>He's a student like me.</i>

1070
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,511
<i>How old is this...
Twenty-one... ish.</i>

1071
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,648
That's clever.

1072
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:10,284
You start me at 26, so that 21,

1073
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:12,520
which is really 22,
sounds reasonable.

1074
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,289
I admire that.

1075
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:16,991
Thank you.

1076
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:19,160
But I'm still not gonna say yes.
Mom!

1077
01:18:19,162 --> 01:18:21,262
What? He already asked me out.

1078
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,566
But it would mean missing
your office picnic.

1079
01:18:25,568 --> 01:18:29,737
This just gets worse and worse.
I want you to be there.

1080
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:32,039
<i>I only have three
more months with you,</i>

1081
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,741
<i>and then you're
2,000 miles away,</i>

1082
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:36,711
and it's dorm life
and frat parties,

1083
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:39,880
and I'll seem boring
by comparison.

1084
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:42,883
Come, please.

1085
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,385
Come.

1086
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:09,610
I think I have to quit.

1087
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,749
You wanna bet on whether I get
called back to New York tomorrow?

1088
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,718
Claire.

1089
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,186
Yeah?

1090
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,692
If I am...

1091
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:36,036
A Van's just been found
wrecked on grand street.

1092
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:38,639
Driver fled.
Inside smells like bleach.

1093
01:19:38,641 --> 01:19:40,708
He tried to move it.
He tried to move it!

1094
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:41,870
Give me the keys. I'll drive!

1095
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,215
We find anything in there
that ID's Marzin,

1096
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:50,985
we might actually have him.

1097
01:19:50,987 --> 01:19:53,554
Maybe you won't have to go.

1098
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,736
Oh.

1099
01:20:08,738 --> 01:20:10,805
Oh, god.

1100
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,594
Welcome to the war.

1101
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,432
You think Morales did this?

1102
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:42,670
Of course he did.

1103
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:45,439
He had to.

1104
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,133
Ray.

1105
01:21:13,135 --> 01:21:14,768
Claire, I'm sorry.

1106
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,891
I don't know. I've been
with the Mets 10 years now.

1107
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:39,693
It's the same thing every
season... our pitching's weak.

1108
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:42,096
Our best guy went down
with an elbow injury.

1109
01:21:42,098 --> 01:21:44,531
They had this great kid
coming up, but he...

1110
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:48,335
Well, they decided to trade
him for a left fielder, so...

1111
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:51,772
Well, that's the thing
about trades, huh?

1112
01:21:51,774 --> 01:21:54,942
Everybody has to
give up something.

1113
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:57,378
Well, I can tell you where we
are with Marzin, if you want.

1114
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:00,748
Tell me why
you're not married anymore.

1115
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:06,020
Why don't you tell me
why you still are?

1116
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,525
Ellis and I
understand each other.

1117
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,363
You?

1118
01:22:16,365 --> 01:22:18,499
Well, she was, um...

1119
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,735
She was great, actually.

1120
01:22:21,737 --> 01:22:23,637
She was kind of a Saint.

1121
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:29,643
There was just one thing about her
that neither one of us could fix.

1122
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,147
What was that?

1123
01:22:33,149 --> 01:22:34,782
She wasn't you.

1124
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:44,458
Well, you always were
a little slow.

1125
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,427
Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.

1126
01:22:46,429 --> 01:22:49,496
How's that? Why didn't you
ask me to come with you?

1127
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:54,501
And give up second chair?

1128
01:22:54,503 --> 01:22:56,437
No, not you.

1129
01:22:56,439 --> 01:22:59,206
Like I said, slow.

1130
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,753
What is that?
Oh, it's just, um...

1131
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:16,156
Just the office, back home.

1132
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:20,194
Baseball emergency?

1133
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:22,763
Yeah, they, uh... they put in
this new surveillance system.

1134
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:26,800
It's giving everybody fits. I gotta
get to the laptop in the hotel.

1135
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:29,103
You're really not gonna
tell me where you're going?

1136
01:23:29,105 --> 01:23:30,904
You know what?

1137
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:35,676
Truth is, it's probably better I
didn't ask you to come with me.

1138
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:39,546
This way, I got to spend
the next 13 years

1139
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:42,683
pretending that you might
have actually said yes.

1140
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,685
And I did.

1141
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,559
Good night.

1142
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:58,599
Would you be careful?

1143
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:00,901
Be careful, okay?

1144
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:16,750
Hey. The Mercedes.

1145
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:48,382
- Where the hell are you?
- I got him, bump.

1146
01:24:48,384 --> 01:24:50,851
He's in a Benz. We're heading
over the fourth street bridge.

1147
01:24:50,853 --> 01:24:53,187
He made you yet? <i>No.</i>

1148
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:55,122
Looks like he's gonna take
a right on Anderson.

1149
01:24:55,124 --> 01:24:57,958
<i>Okay. I'm on my way.</i>
Under the radar, right?

1150
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:02,463
<i>What, I'm gonna start respecting
protocol now? Break my perfect record?</i>

1151
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:05,099
<i>Let me look around
and see who I can scare up.</i>

1152
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,568
Okay.

1153
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:11,538
Brick building,
corner of Anderson and Mateo.

1154
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,207
I'm betting it's a chop shop.

1155
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:15,209
<i>Hey, don't do anything
till I get there.</i>

1156
01:25:15,211 --> 01:25:17,111
<i>You wind up dead,
I get a demerit.</i>

1157
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,168
Hey, man. Hey, yo.

1158
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:15,869
Let's get it in!

1159
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:18,839
Ain't no thing!

1160
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:20,541
Ain't no thing, dog!

1161
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:27,548
Hey. Asshole.

1162
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,020
Why you following me?

1163
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:35,155
He's a cop. He's gotta be a cop.

1164
01:26:35,157 --> 01:26:38,158
No badge. He's in a rented car.

1165
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,527
So why's he following you then?

1166
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,796
Nice.

1167
01:26:42,798 --> 01:26:45,966
I said, why are you
following me, man?

1168
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:50,537
Pac-man, you still
don't remember me?

1169
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:54,074
I'm pac-man.
I'm in a video game.

1170
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:57,311
Who the hell is pac-man?

1171
01:26:57,313 --> 01:26:59,594
You have to answer for Carolyn Cobb.
You have to answer...

1172
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:06,587
- yo, can we lose this guy already?
- Yeah, get rid of him. Do it.

1173
01:27:06,589 --> 01:27:08,755
I don't know who he is.
Come on. Come on.

1174
01:27:08,757 --> 01:27:13,026
I know it was you.
I know it was you.

1175
01:27:13,028 --> 01:27:15,529
- Freeze! Freeze!
- Raise your hands! Get 'em up!

1176
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:18,398
- Hands up! Nobody do anything stupid!
- Let me see your hands!

1177
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,200
- Get on the ground!
- Drop it!

1178
01:27:20,202 --> 01:27:23,737
- Get down!
- Drop the gun now. Drop it!

1179
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,273
Put it on the ground.
That's it. Slide it over here.

1180
01:27:26,275 --> 01:27:28,308
Bump, you got him? Yeah.

1181
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:37,918
Reggie! Reg, talk to me!

1182
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,855
- Reggie!
- Don't move!

1183
01:27:41,857 --> 01:27:44,491
- Reggie, talk to me!
- I got it, bump. I got it.

1184
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:51,064
Come here, buddy.
Reggie. Reggie.

1185
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:53,700
Stay with me, buddy.
Come on. Eyes on me, buddy.

1186
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:56,136
Reggie. Reggie. Come on, buddy.
Eyes on me, buddy.

1187
01:27:56,138 --> 01:27:57,871
Shots fired.
I have an officer down.

1188
01:27:57,873 --> 01:28:00,574
We are at 516 Anderson street
in a warehouse.

1189
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:02,309
I repeat, officer down.
Come on, buddy.

1190
01:28:02,311 --> 01:28:04,611
- Jess.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

1191
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:07,314
<i>Officer down,
516 Anderson street.</i>

1192
01:28:07,316 --> 01:28:10,817
Look. It's him.

1193
01:28:10,819 --> 01:28:12,686
It's Marzin.

1194
01:28:14,155 --> 01:28:16,657
You see?

1195
01:28:16,659 --> 01:28:18,158
Goddamn it!

1196
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,561
How's he doing, bumpy?

1197
01:28:21,563 --> 01:28:23,163
He's dead.

1198
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:56,997
I told you I'd get him.

1199
01:28:56,999 --> 01:28:58,432
Congratulations.

1200
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,502
You don't think he's Marzin?

1201
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:04,871
No, I don't think he's Marzin.

1202
01:29:04,873 --> 01:29:08,342
I think we just sent a
15-year guy home in a box

1203
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:10,944
for five grand theft autos
and a parole violation.

1204
01:29:10,946 --> 01:29:13,714
You saw his face? Up close?
Yes, I saw his face.

1205
01:29:13,716 --> 01:29:15,615
Did you look at Siefert's face?
'Cause he's dead.

1206
01:29:15,617 --> 01:29:17,484
Well, he had to answer
for Carolyn too.

1207
01:29:17,486 --> 01:29:22,723
Don't you ever, ever
say her name again!

1208
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:53,286
So, what now?

1209
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:58,458
You fly home? It's done?

1210
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:03,430
I don't know. Part of it maybe.

1211
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:08,435
I know I should forget it.

1212
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:11,505
It was another lifetime.

1213
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:18,445
Except it wasn't.

1214
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:22,582
We blew it, didn't we?

1215
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:27,521
Didn't we?

1216
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:42,636
Sure. Move him in.

1217
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:46,673
He's been living here for
the last 12 years anyway.

1218
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:51,178
I'm going to bed.

1219
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:06,193
I told you he understood me.

1220
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:16,803
Jess?

1221
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:34,087
Would, uh, you like
any coffee or...

1222
01:31:34,089 --> 01:31:35,689
No. No.

1223
01:31:35,691 --> 01:31:37,691
Have a seat, please.

1224
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:44,431
My guys are doing a
widows-and-orphans for Siefert.

1225
01:31:44,433 --> 01:31:46,833
Might not be a bad idea
for you to contribute.

1226
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:49,002
Yeah.

1227
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:50,504
Of course.

1228
01:31:51,973 --> 01:31:53,607
I forgot he was married.

1229
01:31:53,609 --> 01:31:56,943
Divorced.
Two kids in high school.

1230
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:00,413
Well, that's on me.

1231
01:32:01,382 --> 01:32:03,383
No.

1232
01:32:03,385 --> 01:32:05,986
It's on me.

1233
01:32:05,988 --> 01:32:09,556
I could have stopped all this.
That's...

1234
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:12,425
That's why you're here.

1235
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:19,332
I want to thank you both for
staying with this like you have,

1236
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:22,302
but it has to stop now,
before anybody else gets hurt.

1237
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:25,405
I couldn't live with that. Jess,
this is the guy. This is Marzin.

1238
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:28,041
- He's not the guy.
- I know you don't wanna get invested all over again.

1239
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:29,476
It's not Marzin.

1240
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:33,580
I know it.

1241
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,082
How?

1242
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:41,655
'Cause Marzin's been dead
for 13 years.

1243
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:49,229
I killed him.

1244
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:55,802
What?

1245
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:02,576
I killed him about a
month after you left.

1246
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:04,444
He's buried out in the yard.

1247
01:33:08,115 --> 01:33:11,418
You understand you're speaking
to an officer of the court?

1248
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:12,852
I do. Jess.

1249
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:17,424
Before you say another word, you
need to get yourself a lawyer.

1250
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:20,293
It's okay. I'll be fine with whatever
you decide to do about it, okay?

1251
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:26,132
I would've left him alone.
I want you to know that.

1252
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:30,370
When they torched that Van...

1253
01:33:30,372 --> 01:33:32,906
I knew, if Morales
could do that,

1254
01:33:32,908 --> 01:33:36,443
he would never let us
bring this guy in.

1255
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:38,144
It just...

1256
01:33:38,146 --> 01:33:40,580
It had to be me.

1257
01:33:40,582 --> 01:33:43,450
I owed my daughter that.

1258
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:55,328
<i>Truth is,
he wasn't that hard to find.</i>

1259
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:59,032
<i>Eventually, he did come to that
bar, like I always said he would.</i>

1260
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,075
<i>Passion always wins.</i>

1261
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:11,811
<i>Right?</i>

1262
01:34:23,425 --> 01:34:28,328
<i>It's the weirdest thing, when
you're on your way to do something,</i>

1263
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:31,765
<i>but you're not sure you're
actually gonna go through with it.</i>

1264
01:34:34,468 --> 01:34:38,171
<i>Like reading a book, only you are the
person that you're reading about.</i>

1265
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:41,274
<i>And then you...</i>

1266
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:44,678
You watch yourself do it.

1267
01:34:57,625 --> 01:35:00,060
Nobody missed him. You were
right about that, ray.

1268
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:08,401
<i>We made our case
on al-Ankara without him.</i>

1269
01:35:08,403 --> 01:35:11,571
<i>Got our convictions,
and everybody walked away happy.</i>

1270
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,677
So forget about this Beckwith.

1271
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,313
He's a creep,
but he's not our creep.

1272
01:35:20,315 --> 01:35:23,750
Just let it go, okay?

1273
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:26,720
Reliving it, wondering
if you could've stopped it.

1274
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:30,123
That's no way to live.

1275
01:35:35,329 --> 01:35:36,896
- You're telling me...
- Sorry.

1276
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:41,067
But it's done.

1277
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:48,808
- Claire, I'm fine with whatever you...
- I need a second. All right?

1278
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:52,846
Give me a second.

1279
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,118
Jess.

1280
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:00,754
Was this better?

1281
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:06,359
What do you think?

1282
01:36:06,361 --> 01:36:08,828
I think you look
a million years old.

1283
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:32,819
I always thought
if this one was over,

1284
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:37,223
it would feel like it was over.

1285
01:36:39,261 --> 01:36:40,894
Maybe it's been over
a long time.

1286
01:36:40,896 --> 01:36:42,629
We just...

1287
01:36:42,631 --> 01:36:44,497
Never knew it.

1288
01:36:46,066 --> 01:36:49,335
I'm gonna go and check on her.
What do I say?

1289
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:53,072
I don't know.

1290
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:56,810
Good night.

1291
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:26,840
<i>Just let it go, okay?</i>

1292
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:31,010
<i>Reliving it, wondering
if you could've stopped it...</i>

1293
01:37:33,648 --> 01:37:35,281
That's where I've been
the last 13 years.

1294
01:37:36,383 --> 01:37:38,551
<i>That's no way to live.</i>

1295
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:18,157
Don't you ever, ever
say her name again!

1296
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:30,637
<i>It's quiet out there.
I like the quiet.</i>

1297
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:39,913
Carolyn is...

1298
01:38:39,915 --> 01:38:43,583
<i>Was</i> the thing

1299
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:45,184
that made me me.

1300
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,189
<i>What would a few bullets get me?</i>

1301
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:55,461
Maybe we could go about this
a little less officially.

1302
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:00,833
I owed my daughter that.

1303
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:06,606
I don't think I have the stomach
to watch him walk away again.

1304
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:14,314
That sound like justice to you?

1305
01:39:20,154 --> 01:39:22,488
I hate the death penalty.

1306
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:30,496
<i>Let him rot in jail,</i>

1307
01:39:30,498 --> 01:39:34,334
live a life full of nothing.

1308
01:41:03,857 --> 01:41:05,558
Please.

1309
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:10,930
Can... can you ask her
to talk to me?

1310
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:23,276
Life sentence, right?

1311
01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:27,313
For you too.

1312
01:42:56,937 --> 01:42:58,404
Ray?

1313
01:43:03,043 --> 01:43:04,544
Ray?
