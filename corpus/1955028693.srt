1
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,300
Stop! Stop!

2
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,500
You murderer!

3
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,700
Socrates Fortlow.

4
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,900
His mother named him Socrates
because it was a wise man's name.

5
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,800
She couldn't learn him how to write,
but his name was from someone smart.

6
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,300
He was a violent man.
He would come up hard.

7
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,400
The rage he carried
brought him to prison.

8
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,600
But the correctional authority
was not able to stem his anger.

9
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,500
Socrates was a solitary man.

10
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,300
He kept his own company with
nothing but hurt in his pockets...

11
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,200
and half forgotten memories
for family and friends.

12
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,100
Bottles and cans.

13
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,400
Bottles and cans,
and back alleys and gutters.

14
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,600
Dumpsters and front yards.

15
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,600
It's all we have left to make a living.
To have a little dignity in our lives.

16
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,200
Socrates roamed the streets...

17
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,300
because at least he could say
he was his own man.

18
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,600
When he left prison,
he ran as though he had escaped.

19
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,400
They paid him 733 dollars
for 18 years hard labour.

20
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,300
He put the money in his pocket
and took the bus to Los Angeles.

21
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,200
That was ten months ago.

22
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,700
He had heard LA was a big
rambling bunch of towns...

23
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,900
where everybody is in too much of
a hurry to remember your face.

24
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,600
An ex-con would need
that kind of anonymity.

25
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,600
I first met Socrates when I was
walking past a construction site.

26
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,100
He was looking for work, but the
foreman said that he was too old.

27
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,500
Working construction
was a young man's game.

28
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,000
It took three men to throw
Socrates out of there.

29
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,900
He had lived so close to the edge for
so long that he was bound to get cut.

30
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
Good morning, Socco.
- Yeah, if it doesn't rain.

31
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,100
How are you doing?

32
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,800
Just that flu I had last month
got me some aching.

33
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,400
You want to play some dominoes?
- No man, I got to get to West LA.

34
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,200
What are you doing way over there?
- I'm looking for a job.

35
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,200
Where?
- Bounty Supermarket.

36
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,300
Do you think they're going to hire you?
- They must, man. I can't...

37
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,700
scoop up garbage
for the rest of my life.

38
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,200
Hey man, I know karate!

39
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,800
What is going on?

40
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,100
Leave the man alone.
- Step the fuck back.

41
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,500
Unless you want some of this?

42
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,200
I didn't do shit, man.
- See what you did to my hand, boy?

43
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,800
What's going on?
- Nothing, man.

44
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,200
There is no problem going on here.
Socco, you need anything, man?

45
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,800
We don't do business
with troublemakers.

46
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,400
Come on now, Mr Keene.
We haven't got time...

47
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,200
33, 34, 35, 36...

48
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,400
...36.75. All right, Socco.
- Why are you paying me in change?

49
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,400
We got too much change
from the crushing machines.

50
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,600
If you don't want the money,
why don't you just give it back.

51
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,300
And drag your cans
back out in the street.

52
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,900
Why are you mad?
- Marlon made me mad.

53
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,200
Markham pisses me off.
He will not even take up for himself.

54
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Not everybody is that brave.
I don't mind if a man is scared.

55
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,000
They are just plain stupid.
Neither of them heard a word I said.

56
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,600
Heard you say what?
- What I said to the white man.

57
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,600
What did you say?
- Come on, quit it!

58
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,600
What's the matter, Socco?

59
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,900
He had applied for work at almost
every supermarket in South Central.

60
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,100
He went farther away...

61
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,700
so they couldn't recognize him
as a bottles and cans man.

62
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,700
If you were finding
and totting cans...

63
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,600
they looked at you
like you were a bum.

64
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,000
Can I help you?

65
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,100
I came for an application.
- For what?

66
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,300
For a job.

67
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,000
How old are you, sir?
- That's against the law.

68
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,000
You cannot discriminate against
colour, sex, religion...

69
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,000
infirmity or age.
That's the law.

70
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,800
I know that.
There is just no job.

71
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,600
Why don't you come back in the fall?

72
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Hey, hold on.

73
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:12,000
I came for an application. You must give
me an application. That's the law, too.

74
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Wait here.

75
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,400
Here.

76
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,600
I need a pencil.
- Just send it in.

77
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,200
I didn't come here for a piece of paper.
I came here to apply for a job.

78
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
Thank you.

79
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,100
I am Miss Grimes. Can I help you?

80
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,000
I have some questions.
- What is it you don't understand?

81
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,900
Why do you want to know
whether I have a car?

82
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,700
Where is this address?
- In Watts.

83
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,300
That's just too far to go by bus.
- Look, I can get here.

84
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,100
I'll send this to the main office.
If it clears, we'll give you a call.

85
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,900
That's a problem.
I don't have a phone.

86
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,400
We need a phone number,
that's how we check your residence.

87
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
You can send it to me.

88
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,400
Send it in for me anyway. I'll come
down myself to find out what they said.

89
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,700
You don't understand...
- Send it in for me.

90
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,100
It's not going to make any difference.

91
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Shut the door, Mr Fortlow.
There are too many flies.

92
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,100
How is it going, lula?
- All right.

93
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,000
Have you been collecting cans?

94
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,300
I've got my routes down.
I have 17 regular customers.

95
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,700
I almost made 37 dollars today.
- In change?

96
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,700
The clerks in that redemption centre
want to treat a man like a dog.

97
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,700
That's why I want a real job. So,
I don't need to hurt one of those fools.

98
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,800
That's the way white folks treat you.
- It's not always the white folks...

99
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,900
Today I tried to show a black man
how he has to respect another.

100
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,000
Did you have this checked?
Well, you should.

101
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,800
This could get infected.
- I have had plenty shots in my days.

102
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,900
I might get a broken jaw,
but definitely no lockjaw.

103
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,000
Where did you look for work?
- In a supermarket.

104
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,500
I am capable of putting
groceries in a bag.

105
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,200
A box boy? Mr Fortlow,
you are way too good for that.

106
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,000
But I can pay the rent.

107
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,500
You could work for me.

108
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,100
You could work here for me.

109
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,500
You motherfucker, you killed him.

110
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,900
No, I couldn't work
in such a small space.

111
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,800
I would go crazy like that.

112
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,700
What do you want to eat?
- That big meat loaf plate.

113
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,900
I could use it.
I walked a lot today.

114
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,600
What's that?
- The meat loaf plate.

115
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,000
That is half of what you normally serve.
- That's exactly what I serve my clients.

116
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,100
The big plate is for a special person.

117
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,800
Every night Socrates
gave himself a grade.

118
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,400
He once made a promise.
A dark oath.

119
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,000
He swore he would never hurt
another person except to do good.

120
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:10,800
He wrote down his failures,
when no good had been accomplished.

121
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,200
Teresa was the woman
who loved him before he went bad.

122
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,400
But even a long-suffering woman
will let you go...

123
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,600
after murder and rape.

124
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,600
She never wrote him in prison.
But he kept her picture...

125
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,700
and told her good night
before he went to bed.

126
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,400
What are you doing there, boy?

127
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,900
I asked you a question.

128
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,500
Where do you think you are going?
What's in the box?

129
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,700
What is in it? Put it down.

130
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Come here.

131
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,600
Let me go, man. Let me go!

132
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,800
Pick it up.

133
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,200
Hurry up.

134
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Pick it up, you heard what I said.
Come on, pick it up.

135
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
Let's go.

136
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,100
Sit down.

137
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,500
Why did you kill Dexter, asshole?

138
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,400
You heard me.
- I have never killed somebody, mister.

139
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,500
Sit your little narrow ass down.

140
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,500
This is my friend, Dexter.

141
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,500
You are crazy, that's a chicken, man.
A bird cannot be a friend.

142
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,400
You have to pluck it.
Because you killed it.

143
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,200
I am not playing with you, boy.

144
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,400
What is this?
- I plucked it.

145
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,400
If you don't know how to pluck
a chicken, then why did you kill it?

146
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,500
I don't know.

147
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,900
Maybe there is some old lady
who wants to buy it.

148
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,100
Why did you kill this chicken?

149
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,400
Because I hated it. It was always
crowing like a sick old man.

150
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,400
Do you live around here?
- I live over on Hooper.

151
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,000
You can't hear
a rooster from over there.

152
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,100
Get back over there and pluck
all the feathers out.

153
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,600
And when you are finished, cut him
open with that knife over there.

154
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,200
And make sure you rinse out
all the blood.

155
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,500
All of it.

156
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,900
What's your name?
- Darryl.

157
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,300
Are you going to do something
with that knife?

158
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,100
We are going to make a dish with
green beans, rice and stewed chicken.

159
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,800
It's going to take a while,
but it will be good.

160
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,600
Clean up those feathers.

161
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
Are you hungry?
- Hell, yeah.

162
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,700
That's real good.
A boy should be hungry.

163
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,100
What is that supposed to mean?
- Hunger tells you what you are missing.

164
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,000
Is that some friend to you?
Is hunger your friend, too?

165
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,200
'Hungry, Horny, How come',
they all are my friends.

166
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,700
My best friends.

167
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,100
A man must have good friends
to make it through penitentiary.

168
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,700
My daddy is up in the city jail.
At least he was.

169
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Died, though.

170
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,200
Can I go now?

171
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,500
You cannot go until you tell.
- What do I tell you?

172
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,200
I am not afraid of you.
- Yes, you are. You are no fool.

173
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Now, come on, Darryl.

174
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,100
Tell it and you can go.
- What do I tell you?

175
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,500
You killed somebody.

176
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,300
I'm not going to turn you in. You did
not know that Dexter was a chicken.

177
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,200
You thought that I knew
something about you.

178
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,700
I am not a judge.

179
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,500
But you will have to talk to me.

180
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,500
Nobody is coming to save you.

181
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,000
It was not my fault.

182
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,000
We were looking at two people
with Phillip in the Baldwin Hills.

183
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,500
Incredible.
- Shut up.

184
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,800
Darryl, grab his pants.

185
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,200
Go.

186
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,900
How are you doing?

187
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,300
Shit.
- Kids, come here.

188
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,400
I'm going to kick your butt.

189
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,700
Hey, come back.

190
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,400
My cousins left me.
Can I go with you?

191
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,400
Go on, man, get away.
- You'd better get out of here, fool.

192
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,800
Go on.

193
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,200
Get away.

194
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,100
Please.
- Come on, punk.

195
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
I've had it with you, piece of shit.
- Come on, man, don't.

196
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,500
Leave that fat ass little nigger alone.

197
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,400
No, man, leave him alone.

198
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Is he dead?

199
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,300
Anybody found him yet?

200
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,500
Phillip said he will kill anybody
who talks about it.

201
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,000
I have to go to the bathroom.

202
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,700
Socrates believed every man
had his own load to shoulder.

203
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,900
He never cared about another killer...

204
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,500
but when he thought about that skinny
boy, he realized he had been wrong.

205
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,800
You and your friends did wrong,
Darryl.

206
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,800
I am just talking to you
as one black man to another.

207
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,800
If you don't know when you have
done wrong, life is not worth a damn.

208
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
Can I go now?

209
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,200
Do you live with your mother?
- No, with foster parents.

210
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,800
I don't want to go to jail.
- You are right. That will not solve it.

211
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,300
It's better to shoot yourself
than to go to jail.

212
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,900
Does your foster mom cook for you?

213
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,100
Most of the time she doesn't
even know where I am.

214
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,900
You can always come back here
and we'll cook together.

215
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,600
Why did they put you in jail?

216
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,500
I killed a man and a woman.
- A white man?

217
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,700
Bye.

218
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,200
So long, little brother.

219
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,700
I'm sorry about your chicken.

220
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,800
He wasn't mine.
He belongs to Miss Walker.

221
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,900
He wondered about the boy and
the rooster that always awoke him.

222
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,200
The rooster was hoarse
in his old age.

223
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,200
Sometimes his crow was a whisper.

224
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,700
But at least that motherfucker tried.

225
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,500
Corina?

226
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,900
What are you doing here?
I mean, how is it?

227
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,100
Have you seen Howard?
- Is he missing?

228
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,200
We had a fight.
- And he walked out?

229
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,600
He is a damn fool.
- He was just very mad.

230
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Do you know where he is?
- Come on in and drink a coffee.

231
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,600
No. I just need to know
if you've seen him.

232
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,600
No, honey, I haven't seen him. But
I will look for him, if you want me to.

233
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,700
Are you sure
you don't want to come inside?

234
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,400
I have to get back home
to my children.

235
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,600
If you see him, don't tell him
I came over here, okay?

236
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,700
Just call me
if you find out where he is.

237
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,600
Ted is sick. He can't make it today.
Can you come back tomorrow?

238
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,800
Man, what are we supposed to do
with these cans until tomorrow?

239
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,400
We need our money now.

240
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Okay, but you must wait outside
until Mr Jonah comes in.

241
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,000
When is that?
- Maybe later.

242
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,600
When is later?
Two, four, six hours from now?

243
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,600
I'm sorry, but I can't help it.

244
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,100
You are supposed to take these cans.
- Yes, from our customers.

245
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,200
But you people,
you are not our customers.

246
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,700
So you are trying to tell me that
we don't eat food from this store?

247
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,100
They got us out here waiting
like dogs tied to a pole.

248
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:43,100
That man must have seen me fifty
times, but he doesn't know my name.

249
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Did you tell him your name?
- I said it right to his face.

250
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,400
I should have broken
his goddamn neck.

251
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,400
Are they going to hire you at Bounty?
- I'm going to break his neck.

252
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Let's see what that motherfucker says
when I break his goddamned bones.

253
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,700
Socco, come on, man, let's go.

254
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,500
Let's find somebody
who wants to do business.

255
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,200
Do you want to leave?
- Yeah. This isn't worth it.

256
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,800
Punk ass motherfucker.

257
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,400
Socco, you're leaving your cart.
- I don't need that shit any more.

258
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,000
It isn't just Bounty and Pickford.
It's the whole damn city.

259
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,400
If they see you pushing a cart,
they want to treat you like trash.

260
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,400
I'm too old to be scooping up
garbage for the rest of my life.

261
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,000
Don't come crying
to me about this mess.

262
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,100
You wouldn't have to go out there
if you would work here with me.

263
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,900
I am hungry like a motherfucker.
How many pies do you have today?

264
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Cherry pie, apple pie
and coconut cream.

265
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
I'll take them all three.

266
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,000
You want three slices of pie?
- No, baby, three whole pies.

267
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,300
I have to charge you by the slice.
So it's going to cost you $ 12 each.

268
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,100
And bring me a whole pot
of coffee too, please.

269
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,300
How are you living, brother?
- Depends on what comes next.

270
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,300
So you live minute to minute.
I used to be like that.

271
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,800
What's your name?

272
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Socrates.

273
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,400
That's somebody famous, right?

274
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Yes. A long time ago.
- I'm not a fool. I know some shit.

275
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,800
My name is Wilfred,
Willie to my friends.

276
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,600
So, what are you eating, Soh-crates?
No, I just fuck with you.

277
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,400
Bring Socrates here some more of
this chicken and shit, put it on my bill.

278
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,200
Man, that's nice. I bet she would
like to give you some of that for free.

279
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,100
Nothing in this life is free.

280
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,400
What work do you do, brother?
- I'm looking for work.

281
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,600
So what do you think I do?

282
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,700
Let's see... you have scars
on your hands from fighting.

283
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:15,200
You were hit by a bullet.
If you don't deal drugs, you use them.

284
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:21,200
You have got a fast eye.
And a quick tongue.

285
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,200
I would say that would make you a thief.
I don't like thieves that much.

286
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,400
I am trying to find a job,
but people think I'm crazy.

287
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,500
Because of you,
children think work is for fools.

288
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,700
That is damn good, Socrates.

289
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,400
I see, that you know your shit.
But you cannot see me.

290
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,200
You cannot see me.
I put on a running suit like this here.

291
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,000
I jump on the goddamn bus. I run
my ass to the Beverly Center Mall...

292
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,700
and steal a car.

293
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,300
I put a hat or bandanna on my head,
then they cannot recognize a nigger.

294
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,300
I learnt that in jail.

295
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,600
Then I grab some old rich white bitch
or some old Chinese girl.

296
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,800
I hold her by the thumb,
just to cut her a little bit.

297
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,500
So she is too worried about bleeding
before she calls the cop.

298
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,200
I saw a whore piss
in her panties, man.

299
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,300
I jumped out of my running suit and
drove the fuck out of that parking lot.

300
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,200
Now, the cops are looking for
some old hood nigger.

301
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,400
But me...

302
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,600
I am dressed like a business man.

303
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,700
What's so goddamned funny?

304
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,900
I don't steal from the blacks.

305
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,500
I am not stealing from stores
down here.

306
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,400
Motherfucker.

307
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,600
You sit there and judge me with your
stomach full of food I just paid for.

308
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,800
And with my funky-assed clothes
and my nigger appetite, too.

309
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,400
My clothes are second hand. But all
the holes in my clothes are darned.

310
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,000
I haven't got twenty
dollar bills in my hand...

311
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,800
but I haven't got woman's blood
on my hands either.

312
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,900
You are way too deep for me, brother.
Way too deep.

313
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,000
Fuck you.

314
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,600
Fuck me? Hey man,
you don't even have to like me.

315
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,200
Why don't you try to pay for your food
with these pennies in your pocket.

316
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,200
I'm going to do you one better
than that, boy.

317
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,400
I'm going to pay for your food.

318
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,400
I am no fool either, Willie.

319
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,600
Everybody has got to pay.
Nothing in this life is free.

320
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,900
It's now my turn to pay.

321
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,400
Crazy nigger.

322
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,100
Your turn is waiting on you
out there somewhere.

323
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Wilfred, get out of here.
- Do you think you can make me?

324
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,600
Go on, leap frog... go on.
Go for the knife.

325
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,300
Get out of here, Wilfred.

326
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,500
Come on, leap.

327
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,200
You are both crazy.
- Get out of here, boy.

328
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
All right, player... all right.

329
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,300
Punk ass motherfucker.

330
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,700
Why do you pay for him?
- Because a man pays his own way.

331
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,800
He was going to pay for you.
- No, it's the other way around.

332
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,100
I have been paying for men like him
all my life. And his daddy paid for me.

333
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,200
I don't understand this.

334
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,800
If you are so upstanding
and so moral and so honest...

335
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,700
why don't you just work for me?

336
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,800
Is it because I am a woman?
- Yes, you are certainly a woman.

337
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,400
You were ready to pour hot grease
on Willie if he would mess with me.

338
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
What are you doing out here
in the storm, boy?

339
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,500
Come inside before you get sick.

340
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,100
Ground sassafras.

341
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Thyme leaves.

342
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,900
That's what makes your gumbo.

343
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Do you ever dream?

344
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,800
Yes, sometimes.

345
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,100
What do you dream about?

346
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,700
About whatever it is that I want
and don't have.

347
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,200
Do you ever dream about something
that you do not want?

348
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Things that you really hate.
So, you wake up scared?

349
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,300
Do you dream about that, boy?

350
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,600
I was in a dark room.

351
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,400
Black everywhere.
But I could still see him.

352
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,800
He was cut in the stomach
and naked and he came after me.

353
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,500
And then I ran.
- Did he catch you?

354
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:17,700
I always wake up before he could
catch me, but if he did, I would die.

355
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,500
Because I did nothing to help him.

356
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,900
Your dream is telling you
that you have to make it right.

357
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,400
Then maybe I could sleep again?
- Yes, I bet you could.

358
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:39,400
Finish your food and then try
to get some sleep in my bed.

359
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,100
I'll make sure nobody will get you.

360
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,400
Darryl respected Socrates and
he wanted to know what he thought.

361
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,600
But the idea that Darryl wanted to
hear what he had to say, scared him.

362
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,300
Socrates wanted to tell the child that
everything was going to be all right.

363
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,700
But it was not all right
and it might never become all right.

364
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:18,700
Because trouble would crawl up into
your mind and come inside with you.

365
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,100
He does not have time?
Two children have already died there.

366
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,100
It is a dangerous intersection.
We need a stop sign there.

367
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,000
Is that you, Miss Warren?
- Yes. Who is this?

368
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Is your husband there, madam?
- I don't have a husband. Who is this?

369
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,900
I don't know how to say this, madam.

370
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,300
Is it about Felix?
Are you calling about my son?

371
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:51,000
Up at Oil Derrick 22, in the Baldwin
Hills, there are some bushes.

372
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,000
He's up there in the bushes.

373
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,700
I called you because I knew
that it would settle your mind.

374
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:08,900
I would have called the police, but
they might not get around to look.

375
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,300
Are you all right?

376
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,000
I hit you because I just got mad
when I heard that lady screaming.

377
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,500
You and your friends
have broken her heart.

378
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,300
I'm sorry.

379
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,600
I know you are sorry.

380
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,900
I know you get nightmares.

381
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,900
And you are going to get them
for a long time, little brother.

382
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,800
Can I stay here tonight?

383
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,400
It's him again.

384
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,300
Can I help you?
- Did your head office call back yet?

385
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,100
Sir, I have to ask you to leave.
- Let me talk to your boss.

386
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,100
I said...
- Don't make me mad, boy.

387
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,000
You can't work here,
unless you have a phone.

388
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,600
You will call your head office
and get an official word on me...

389
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,900
or I'll be back here every day
until I know why I cannot have a job.

390
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,000
I am calling the police.

391
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,300
I'll be back
for my answer in a few days.

392
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,200
Hey girl, how are you doing?

393
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,000
Have you seen him?
- Come on in the house.

394
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,800
Sit down.

395
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,400
I do not have time to waste here,
Socrates Fortlow.

396
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,000
You called and said you heard
something. What is it?

397
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,700
Okay.
But just for a minute.

398
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,200
Do you want coffee?

399
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,800
Your husband shouldn't let
a beautiful woman like you alone.

400
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,900
Where is he?

401
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,700
I don't know exactly...

402
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,700
but I think I know where
I might be able to find him.

403
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,900
What's wrong?

404
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,100
I am scared.

405
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,100
So if you really could help me,
I wish you would.

406
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,100
He didn't call you?

407
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,900
I want him to get a job at McDonald's
while he waits on that computer job.

408
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,600
He didn't have a job for nine months.

409
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,900
And they cut
my hours back at Penney's.

410
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,200
Why won't he get a job?
- He is just too proud. That's all.

411
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,400
But he is not too proud
to let his wife go out and work.

412
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,800
Winnie and little Howard
will not stop growing...

413
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,100
until he finds a job
he's not ashamed of.

414
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,400
The man is a fool.

415
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,800
If you were mine, I would work
at McDonald's and Burger King.

416
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,200
You two have children.

417
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:11,200
Howard is liable
to find another man in his bed.

418
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,600
No, that is not going on.
- I know that.

419
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,200
All I am trying to say is that
he has got a treasure in you.

420
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,900
He must look after it.

421
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,700
Did you lose somebody?

422
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,200
Is that why you sound so upset
about me and Howard?

423
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,100
Do you take milk and sugar?
- Just sugar.

424
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,900
Did you?

425
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,600
Do you want me to find Howard?

426
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,000
Because I will.

427
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,800
But first,
I need to say something to you.

428
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,800
I will go and find Howard.

429
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,000
I will tell him that he is a fool
and that he must go home tonight.

430
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,900
Because in a day or two
I will be at his front door.

431
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,700
And if he is not at home, I will
take you and the kids to a show.

432
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,300
You had better go home now, Corina.
Come on, go on.

433
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,200
If you go home,
then I'll go and find Howard.

434
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,100
I'll find him, don't worry.

435
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,300
If he's not coming home,
Then you will see me tomorrow.

436
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,200
You can come out now, Howard.

437
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,000
Why do you talk like that to Corina?
It's like you want something.

438
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,100
Do you want to come on to my wife?
- She is not your wife.

439
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,700
I got a bottle of whiskey under the sink.
Get it, before you get yourself hurt.

440
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:05,300
Why are you telling Corina
all that shit? She is my wife.

441
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,100
As long as you are not home,
she is not yours.

442
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,000
I thought you were my friend.

443
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,100
Not when it comes to a woman
like that.

444
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,000
That is what I was trying to explain.
She is a woman, not a dog.

445
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,100
You cannot just leave her
somewhere like you leave a car.

446
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,600
If you don't go home,
I will be there.

447
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
Me or somebody else.

448
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:54,800
You talk about my problems
and then you go after my wife.

449
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:01,100
You said you don't want her any more.
- She is always dogging me like that.

450
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,900
I wouldn't mind that. A woman
that kicks my ass when I fuck up...

451
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,900
and kiss my head when I do right.
I would be the first in line.

452
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,600
Did you get that job?
- Not yet.

453
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,600
Don't worry about her, man.

454
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,600
When Luvia gets a hard thought
in her head, she will not give it up.

455
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,300
I don't blame her.
She can smell the bad on me.

456
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,300
Come on, man,
let's get a couple of beers.

457
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,600
You wanted to talk to me?

458
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,000
About a dope fiend
that lives near Howard.

459
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,100
Who?
- Petis Mulgrew.

460
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:19,000
Petis is always stealing and fighting.
And now he has discovered crack.

461
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,800
He robbed two old ladies and said
if they told it, he would kill them.

462
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:28,700
Did he hurt them?
- No, but we have to do something.

463
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:34,200
The police might get him.
But then again, they might not.

464
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,100
What are you trying to say?
- We have to stop him.

465
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,300
This dope fiend either stops himself,
goes to jail or he dies.

466
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,300
I could kill him.

467
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:56,800
I believe you could, Mr Burke.
But sometimes it isn't for you to decide.

468
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,000
How are you doing, Winnie?
- Mom, the door.

469
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:27,100
Howard, Socrates is here.

470
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,800
Come on in, Mr Fortlow.

471
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,900
Corina, take the children
in the other room, please.

472
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,900
Go on.

473
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,500
Sit down.
- What is it, Howard?

474
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:57,000
Last night, at 6:00, Winnie took it
in her head to go out looking for me.

475
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,200
I was at Stony's place, while my little
girl was looking for me in some alley.

476
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,500
What happened?

477
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,000
She saw Petis Mulgrew
kill Leroy Wade.

478
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,100
There it is.

479
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,000
Kill him...
That's what we ought to do.

480
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,500
That's what you said too, Socrates?
Isn't that right?

481
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,200
Let's go and shoot him in his head.
- We can't do that, man.

482
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:34,000
We are not sure whether he did it.
It is just hearsay.

483
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:39,000
My baby girl is not lying. She saw
Petis jump on Leroy with that knife.

484
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,600
She told that to Corina before
they even found him.

485
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,600
She saw Leroy get it and she saw
who did it.

486
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,300
She could be wrong.

487
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,800
What is wrong with you?
- Nothing, that flu will not go away.

488
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,700
Even if she did see it,
we should still go to the cops.

489
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,500
Will Corina let me talk to Winnie?
- No, she doesn't want to scare her.

490
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,500
Tell me what else did Winnie see?

491
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,900
That crazy fool lives a block away from
my house. Corina is scared to death.

492
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,600
It sounds like a war zone out there.

493
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,600
Listen to that.
Running them down like slaves.

494
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,400
They have got dogs, too.

495
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:44,900
What do you want us to do, Howard?
- I have to leave soon.

496
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,100
The last two weeks five people have
been mugged here. Petis did it.

497
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,600
Now they are killing people.
- Tell the police.

498
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Dope fiends don't stop until they
are dead. We have to kill them.

499
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,700
We cannot kill him.
- Why not?

500
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,900
Burke, you cannot wash murder off
your hands, you have to live with that.

501
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:15,600
You should never turn a black man
over to the police, you'd better kill him.

502
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,600
So we cannot do anything.

503
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,000
Will you help us, Socco?

504
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,700
I'll do what I can, but you have
to go to a doctor about that gut.

505
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,400
Remember, let me do the talking.

506
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,000
Who is it?
- Petis, it's me...

507
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,800
Socco.

508
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
What do you want?
- We can both earn some money.

509
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:31,200
We would talk to him.
- That's what I am doing.

510
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,900
This is the only way to get
his attention.

511
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,500
Let me go.
- Girl, put some clothes on.

512
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,600
Are you a friend of my daddy?

513
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yes. Get your clothes
and get out of here.

514
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,800
What are you going to do with Petis?
- Go on, get out of here.

515
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,700
Look, all right.
She is gone, isn't she?

516
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:06,200
We know what you did, Petis.
- I didn't do a damn thing.

517
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,800
Get him back on the chair.

518
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:18,600
Look, let me tell you something...
- Don't talk!

519
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,500
Shut up. No! Don't talk.
- Get the fuck out of my house.

520
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,800
Shut up!

521
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:29,500
Nobody wants to hear what you
have to say. You have to listen.

522
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:35,500
We have held a trial.
One man wants to kill you.

523
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,400
Somebody else wants to turn you
over to the police.

524
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:43,600
We have talked about it
and we have come to a decision.

525
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,300
You have to leave, boy.
- But I haven't done anything.

526
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,300
You have to leave this neighbourhood.

527
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,300
And if you don't go,
then you will die.

528
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,500
I don't know what the hell
you are talking about.

529
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:06,000
You are out of here at six o'clock.
- Already at six?

530
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,900
Can you repeat that?

531
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,400
I have to say goodbye to my mother.

532
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:21,500
If you are not gone by six o'clock,
your mama can say goodbye to you.

533
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,800
Come on.

534
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,300
Let's go.

535
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,100
What shall we do?

536
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,100
It's time for you all to go home.

537
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:21,700
I thought we were in it together.
- Yes. But it's time for you all to go.

538
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:29,800
What are you going to do, Socco?
- I will hang around here until about six.

539
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,200
We shall go to the clinic
after this, right?

540
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,600
Sure, Socrates heard the boy gasping
and snorting in that dumpster.

541
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,900
But it wasn't worth the mark against
his soul to see that crack head bleed.

542
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,100
Good morning, Mr Fortlow.

543
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:47,800
I thought you might get hungry.

544
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,300
How is Winnie?
- She is real good.

545
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,400
I wanted to thank you for helping.

546
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,300
I wanted to thank you again.

547
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,200
Is Howard still home?

548
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,300
He's in the house.

549
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,600
He still hasn't got a job,
and he is mad, too.

550
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,400
He told me not to come over here.

551
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:37,300
But I told him I owed you at least
a breakfast, and a thank you.

552
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,700
Howard is just ashamed.

553
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:46,400
He thinks he is no man any more.
But he will come around it though.

554
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,300
Besides, he knows...

555
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,200
that there are men enough
that will carry your load, woman.

556
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,400
Whole lot of men.

557
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:09,100
That touch meant a lot to him.
She knew things he would never know.

558
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,000
When she woke up,
she thought about a better life.

559
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:18,300
And maybe with that touch, could
Socrates see something better, too.

560
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,400
Hey, you. I want you.

561
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,900
Get him.

562
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,700
Did you turn on me, nigger?
- No.

563
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,900
Yes, you did. You told the police
where to find the body.

564
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,700
You told the police.
- No, I didn't.

565
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,500
I do not hope to see
your sorry ass any more, sissy.

566
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,400
That's okay. Let him run.

567
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,400
I know where the motherfucker lives.

568
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,300
Socrates had some hard fights
in his life.

569
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,900
But the hardest was
when he couldn't do anything.

570
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,900
He never liked talking to doctors...

571
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:37,600
because he said they never answered
a question except to tell him lies.

572
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,500
He wondered what lies
they were going to tell him now.

573
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,600
Did you ever fix any furniture before?

574
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,500
I could get some glue down in here...

575
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,700
brace it, and hold it together
with a belt...

576
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,800
then these legs are stronger
than they were before.

577
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:18,700
Some of the things they teach
you in prison are useful.

578
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:23,800
But it's only useful if they don't
cut you down in the streets first.

579
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,900
Socrates saw that Darryl
was scared.

580
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:36,100
Scared what he had to do
to be a man.

581
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,500
Are your foster parents not mad
at you, for not coming home?

582
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,600
Once I was gone for four days.
They never knew.

583
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,500
Help me turn over the table.

584
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,800
Ready. Easy.

585
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,300
Man, there is no easy thing
in South Central.

586
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,100
Down here you don't have
to join the army to go to war.

587
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,500
Do you remember our discussion?
- About Phillip and them?

588
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:15,000
Put that down easy, Darryl.

589
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,600
All right. Today is the day.

590
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,500
Are you scared?

591
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,500
Are they the ones?

592
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,800
Don't you move, man.

593
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,400
I would better look out for
your friend there, Socrates.

594
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:08,300
I told you to keep your ugly face away.
- You don't scare me.

595
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,600
You'd better go and help him.

596
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,900
Don't talk to me, you little fuck.

597
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,100
Come on, show me what you've got.
I will kick your ass.

598
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:30,300
Your boy is in big trouble over there,
Mr Fortlow.

599
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,100
Come on, you little punk.

600
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,200
Turn over.

601
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,300
I'm going to kick your ass,
you piece of shit.

602
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,600
Do you hear me? Do you see me?
- Who are you?

603
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,300
Watch out, Socco.

604
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,900
Don't look at me.

605
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,600
Hit the deck.

606
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,900
I was scared.

607
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:11,100
You gave him a good punch, boy.
It landed right on his chin.

608
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:19,000
Come on, Darryl. You stood up for
yourself, that's all you can do.

609
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,800
You are always outnumbered.

610
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:30,400
They will still come after me.
- Yes, but you stood up.

611
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:36,600
Now, there's nothing to be
ashamed for the rest of your life.

612
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,000
How is that going to help me?

613
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,400
You have done your job.

614
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,100
Now it's up to me,
to find myself a job.

615
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,200
Maybe I can help you.

616
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,600
I'm afraid it's bad news. I got a fax
saying that they cannot hire you...

617
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
because you do not have a phone and
you live too far away from the store.

618
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,400
Can I see it?
- I threw it away.

619
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:25,000
Please leave, or I will go to the police,
if you don't stop harassing us.

620
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,600
I'm only asking for a job.

621
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:31,200
The police will arrest you
if you come here again.

622
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,700
What do you want?

623
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,600
You have no business here,
Socrates Fortlow.

624
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,600
We just come here for a visit.

625
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,800
You trick yourself into my house with
a boy. You are not welcome here.

626
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,100
I am his best friend, Luvia.

627
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,700
You cannot deny him that.
Not now.

628
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:21,000
Do you have a gun on you?
I don't want weapons in my house.

629
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,900
I am unarmed, officer.

630
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:44,200
I don't want any foolishness in there.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.

631
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,300
Mr Burke needs his sleep.

632
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,400
Take it easy.

633
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,900
How do you feel?

634
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,700
It's like when they told me
it might be cancer.

635
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:14,100
I had trouble standing up.

636
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,600
And then after a week of tests... shit.

637
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,600
Are you in pain?

638
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,600
Can I borrow your gun, Socco?

639
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,300
For what?

640
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,300
You know.

641
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:42,500
The doctors say,
I might have got three, six months.

642
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,700
They said that they cannot give me
a good pain killer...

643
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:53,100
until they have tried
chemo or radiation.

644
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:56,100
And now they are telling me...

645
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:02,200
that they cannot treat me right,
because I am not insured properly.

646
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,800
Do you want to shoot yourself?

647
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,600
I cannot do that.
- I can pay you for it.

648
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,700
I have put away part of my
social security since I live here.

649
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:27,900
Luvia will call the cops
as soon as I bring a gun.

650
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:32,700
Let us meet on the street.
- How will you do that? You are ill.

651
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:37,900
Luvia says that you do not eat.
- That is because of the pain.

652
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,700
I cannot walk or eat
because it hurts so much.

653
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,000
Go downstairs and wait for me.

654
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,500
Your twenty minutes are up.

655
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,000
We need to talk for a few more
minutes. I'll be right down.

656
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,400
I need to speak with him for a few
more minutes. Excuse us.

657
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:36,500
How much money do you have?
- Over seventeen hundred dollars.

658
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:40,000
I saved it over the last five years.

659
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:43,900
It's in the bottom
of the bottom drawer of the bureau.

660
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,400
I was saving it for Luvia.

661
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:01,500
But I want you to take it
and get me a piece.

662
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,300
After I am gone,
you can give the rest to her.

663
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:20,200
I will take two hundred dollars.
If I have to, I will get you a gun.

664
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:27,600
But I am going to try
and help you first.

665
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:32,700
Don't give up because
you cannot pay the doctors.

666
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,600
Doctors are not everything.

667
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,400
I heard that I had to talk to you.
- Who told you that? Reba?

668
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,200
Did the woman behind the bar
tell you to come up here?

669
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:56,400
Because if she did, you had better
take your ass and get out of here.

670
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,600
I will leave.

671
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,600
When I get what I came for.

672
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,800
Are you trying to fuck with me?

673
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:13,200
You will feel it
when I fuck with you, brother.

674
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,600
I burst you open
like a goddamned watermelon.

675
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,000
What do you want then?

676
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,400
Have you heard from the hospital?

677
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:07,200
They said it is definitely cancer.

678
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:24,400
You are not calling long distance here.
- I got the local number right here.

679
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,700
Valley Enterprises.
Can I help you?

680
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:45,800
It is about my application for a job
at your store on Beverly Glen.

681
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:52,600
How do you spell the last name?
- F-o-r-t-l-o-w, Fortlow.

682
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,600
There is no record of your application.

683
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,500
But Miss Grimes said that you faxed
that you couldn't hire me...

684
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:06,400
because I have no phone
and I live too far from there.

685
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:10,500
Those are not our requirements. And
there is no record of your application.

686
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,000
Maybe you threw it away
when you rejected it?

687
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:18,600
Every application is put
on the computer, so it must be here.

688
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,800
Thank you very much, madam.

689
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,200
My name is Parker
and this is Mr Weems.

690
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,800
We work for
Kingman Security Services.

691
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,700
Would you like to come upstairs?

692
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:14,000
No.
- Just to talk.

693
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,100
Have a seat, Mr Fortlow.

694
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,000
Coffee?

695
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,600
What is it?

696
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,100
What do you have
against Miss Grimes?

697
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,100
I need a job.
- She said you are harassing her.

698
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:39,200
You need a phone number for a job.
- That's bullshit.

699
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,000
Do I have to starve because
I cannot afford a phone?

700
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:53,000
I need a job.
- But you intimidate people.

701
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,000
What am I supposed to do?
- You cannot work here.

702
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:01,200
They are scared that you would
come in here with your gun blazing.

703
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:07,300
What kind of game are you playing?
- What do you mean?

704
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,600
Do you really want a job?
- Yes, that's why I am here.

705
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:17,800
I cannot sit on my ass because
somebody does not like my skin.

706
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,000
You can work for a market
about five blocks away.

707
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:35,800
The manager is Gonzalez.
You will not scare Bobby Gonzalez.

708
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:41,200
Maybe we can talk to him about you.
But I have just one more question.

709
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,500
I got the job.

710
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,500
At the supermarket?

711
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,100
What did you say?

712
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:04,100
About what?
- On your application.

713
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:11,200
When they asked
about your prison record.

714
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:19,700
There were two security guards,
Parker and Weems. Ex-LAPD.

715
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,600
They knew that I was an ex-con
right off the bat.

716
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,600
So what did you say?

717
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:31,800
I told them that they didn't have
to look into that.

718
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,600
And when they check it later?

719
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,100
I will work until they fire me and
then I will get another job. Or not.

720
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,100
What do you want to eat?
- I was about to ask you.

721
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,600
What then?

722
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:56,300
Do you want to have dinner with me?

723
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,400
I don't believe it.

724
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:03,900
All this time you have
never asked me out to dinner.

725
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,300
I never had a job before.
I had nothing to offer.

726
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,900
A man cannot be with a woman
if he cannot pay the bills.

727
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,800
Do you want to go or not?

728
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:28,100
Put those in the box.

729
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,300
Mom, the door.

730
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
This is my friend, Darryl.
Darryl, this is Corina.

731
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,900
We brought you something.

732
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:55,900
Mr Fortlow has got something for us.

733
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,300
I didn't know that you are moving.

734
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:07,400
Howard got a nighttime
computer operator's job in Venice.

735
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,600
We got a place over there.
- That's good, Howard.

736
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,100
That's real good, Howard.

737
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,100
I guess, that will make this
your going away present.

738
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,500
I don't get it.
What is this for?

739
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:40,600
I found this table, Howard. It was
all broken down and scarred up.

740
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:48,900
I put it back together.
I glued, sanded and sealed it.

741
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:56,800
And now I give it to you. Because
every time you sit down to eat at it...

742
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:01,700
I want you to say thank you
for everything.

743
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,600
I don't know what to say.

744
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,200
I just wish there was something
we could do for you.

745
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,600
There is something
that you could do for me.

746
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:35,500
Come on, Darryl.
- Give us a minute, Howard.

747
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,800
Hurry up.

748
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,600
Do you have everything?

749
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:44,000
Why do I have to go with them?

750
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:49,000
It isn't safe around here
with Phillip and the others.

751
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:54,900
In Venice you get a chance
for a new start at a new school.

752
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,600
I like being here.

753
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:01,300
I cannot get custody of you, Darryl.

754
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:04,600
Howard and Corina
already got a family.

755
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,500
Social Services will pay them
money for you to stay with them.

756
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:16,300
Are you scared of going to a new place?
- A little.

757
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,400
That's good.

758
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:25,200
They have gangs in Venice.
So you have to watch out.

759
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:32,200
Don't get in with any gangs.
- I don't want that, no way.

760
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,800
Are you ready?

761
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:50,000
Are you going to see Mr Burke?
- Yes, right after this.

762
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,000
Tell him I hope he is feeling better.

763
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:05,300
You have to sit in the back there,
Darryl. I got a space for you.

764
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:12,700
I'll see you on Saturday.

765
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,600
Then I will teach Howard to barbecue.
- In your dreams.

766
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:24,300
Thanks for looking after Darryl.
- We already got him a school.

767
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:30,800
I will send you 100 dollars each
month. He doesn't eat that much.

768
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:34,600
Don't worry, Socco,
we will take real good care of him.

769
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:11,800
I am still a little woozy.
A little bit.

770
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:19,200
That is because of those drugs.
That's powerful shit.

771
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:25,700
How many are you taking?
- Until the pain stops.

772
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,700
Three, four, every four hours.

773
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,400
Are you drinking?
- Just a drop of wine or two.

774
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:38,100
And a shot of Scotch
before I go to sleep.

775
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:43,500
Don't drink too much.
Alcohol and morphine do not mix.

776
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,500
Do you want to go out tonight?
- Where?

777
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:56,400
Dilly's Bar.
- A sick man has no business there.

778
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,800
I want to drink in a bar.

779
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:04,400
I want to look at some long legs
on a woman.

780
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:20,600
This whiskey makes me see double,
Socco.

781
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:24,800
And one of you is plenty ugly as it is.

782
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:38,800
Do you know why I like you, Socco?

783
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:43,500
Because you do not know any better.
That's why.

784
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:48,300
Ouvrez la porte.
- What do you say?

785
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:54,700
Ouvrez la porte.
That's what we used to say in Paris.

786
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:58,800
Open up...
because Uncle Sam is here.

787
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,000
Those were the days, man.

788
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:04,500
A gun in my hand,
a sweet girl on my left.

789
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:08,100
I could have died then.
I should have died.

790
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,200
No man, then we would
have missed you.

791
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:16,300
I would have missed you. All through
the war, I never met one like you.

792
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,200
What is exactly 'one like me'?

793
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,900
A hero.

794
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,400
You are the closest thing to a hero
I have ever met.

795
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:30,700
You must be drunk.

796
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,300
Sweet Charla.

797
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:44,100
Here it is. Fifty dollars
for all the Scotch you bring.

798
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,700
Thanks.
Is it your birthday?

799
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,800
No, Charla.
I'm going back to my family.

800
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:57,100
Where is home?
- Down south.

801
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:01,400
When are you leaving?
- Later tonight.

802
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,500
What are you talking about?

803
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,400
You are a real hero.
Not many left like you.

804
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,300
Not many so stupid as me.

805
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:50,600
You are no fool, Socrates Fortlow.

806
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:55,800
I never said anything
that you didn't already knew.

807
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,500
Because you are a thinking man.

808
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,400
I never had any knowledge
that you didn't knew.

809
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,700
At least, up to now.

810
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,500
What do you know now?

811
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,900
About death.
I can tell you all about death.

812
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:16,000
Cold and clear.

813
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,900
Are you scared, Burke?
- I am scared of the pain.

814
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:27,600
But I am not scared of death.
Not now.

815
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,000
Is it the dope?
- No.

816
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:34,500
Even before you got me my drug,
I could feel it.

817
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I laid in my room late at night
with an ice pack on my belly.

818
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:45,400
If I laid still enough,
I could feel it.

819
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:49,100
Like icy silver snakes
were moving up and down my body.

820
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:52,400
Sliding and singing.

821
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:55,500
If I was real quiet...

822
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:02,100
that feeling would take over
and I would be on the other side.

823
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:09,000
While I am dying,
something else is coming to life.

824
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:25,400
I was scared to die.

825
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,900
Now I am ready to let go.

826
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,600
I had a couple of things
that I needed to do first.

827
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,400
What do you want?
- I wanted to have a drink...

828
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:44,200
a flirt with a pretty girl
and a talk with my best friend.

829
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,000
There you go.

830
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:08,200
Do you want to go home?
- That's what I told Charla.

831
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:13,500
What do you think about me, Socrates?
- You mean?

832
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:17,100
I want to know what you see
when you look at me.

833
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,900
I always wanted to know...

834
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:23,700
but that's not a question
one man should ask another.

835
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,600
What are you saying now?

836
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:28,900
Tell me what you see
when you look at me.

837
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,100
I don't know.

838
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:39,100
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

839
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
You are my friend.

840
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:48,200
A real friend.

841
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:12,400
I will get a taxi.
You wait right here.

842
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:18,400
No, let's wait for a bus.
I like to watch the lights.

843
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,800
I know what you see.

844
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,500
I know what you see.

845
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:37,200
I know you love me, man.
I love you, too.

846
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,900
Help me to get my pills
out of my pocket, will you?

847
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:04,800
Pour me out ten.
No, twelve and then take it away.

848
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,300
You don't need to take any more
of these now.

849
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:13,000
You need to wait until the morning.

850
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,900
The bus is coming.

851
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:32,500
Leave me here, man.
Get on the bus and go home.

852
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:37,400
I am not leaving you out here.
- You cannot save me.

853
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:41,700
Not this time.
- You are my friend.

854
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
The doctor said I'm dead, man.

855
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:52,200
Dead. Tonight is the best night
that I will never have again.

856
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,600
And you did that for me.

857
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:05,000
Your job is done, Socrates.

858
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,200
Now it is time to die.

859
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,300
Hey, it's all right.

860
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,900
Go on, now.

861
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,200
Come on.

862
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,300
What's wrong with you?

863
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,500
Get on or get off.

864
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:31,600
I couldn't see him,
but I knew that he was there.

865
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:35,800
He was looking after me,
even in death.

866
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:41,800
That bus was carrying him to places
most men couldn't even imagine.

867
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:46,000
And Socrates had been as low
as a man could go.

868
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:51,500
But he came back loving hard
and deep and strong.

869
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:55,300
A rich man would never have
that kind of power.

870
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,300
And precious few lovers
could ever be that satisfied.

871
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Turkish
