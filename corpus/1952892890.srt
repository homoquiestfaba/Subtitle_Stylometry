1
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,625
(Narrator) England, in the year 1215,

2
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:57,542
had been under the reign
of King John for 16 years.

3
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,625
The most villainous
of England's monarchs,

4
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,167
John was renowned
for losing wars with France,

5
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,000
levying punitive taxes,

6
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,708
and sleeping with the wives of barons.

7
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,917
The barons finally rebelled
against their king,

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,250
and became locked
in a bloody civil war

9
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:23,625
lasting for over three years
and decimating both armies.

10
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:28,917
In time, the Knights Templar
were drawn into this conflict.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,375
With the help of
these highly trained warrior monks,

12
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:36,833
King John and his royal army
were eventually defeated.

13
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,833
It was agreed that John
could remain on the throne,

14
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,375
on one condition...

15
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,667
that he would sign a document

16
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,875
upholding the rights and privileges
of all free men,

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,958
but ultimately limiting
the power of the monarchy.

18
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,917
Make it count.

19
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:02,375
The Magna Carta
was sealed at Runnymede

20
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:07,583
on the 15th of June
in the year of our Lord 1215.

21
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:10,875
It will be remembered
throughout history.

22
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:15,458
What is not remembered
is what King John did next.

23
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:45,250
(Man) Sire?

24
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,292
Sire?

25
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,833
It's time.

26
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,625
(Men shouting)

27
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,792
- (Man) Hyah!
- (Whinnying)

28
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,500
Hyah! Hyah!

29
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,792
(King John) England welcomes you.

30
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,500
Does the Pope hold his word?

31
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:08,458
(Chuckles) Oh, how have faith,
Captain Tiberius.

32
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:12,250
His Eminence
is waiting to hear you hold to yours.

33
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,292
The Church will stay out of your lands,
you have his word.

34
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,125
We'll get your country back.

35
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,875
(Tiberius speaks in Danish)

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,500
(Soldiers cheer)

37
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,583
(Thunder)

38
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,667
(Sentry) What say you?

39
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,208
Abbot Marcus.
We seek shelter from the storm.

40
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,125
Open the gates!

41
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,250
(Shivers)

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,625
(Woman) Come and help.

43
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,583
What business do you have here?

44
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,917
Our business is with God at Canterbury.
We need only shelter.

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,458
Shelter you shall have. Food also.

46
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,375
You treat the Lord's servants well.

47
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,958
You wear the mark of the Templars,
yet you carry no swords.

48
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,792
These men have no more need to fight.

49
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,833
Templars masking their faith
and travelling without swords.

50
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,125
How noble!

51
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,417
As God is our witness, Baron,
these men have nothing to hide.

52
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,250
Abbot, save your benedictions.
The Templars fought against the King.

53
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,500
Now you sleep in a king's castle.
These men have plenty to hide.

54
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,375
You there. What say you?

55
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,375
(Abbot Marcus) They say nothing.
They hold vows of silence.

56
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,375
(Laughs) Templars without tongues.
Very well.

57
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,833
Just be gone by the morning.

58
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,750
Back inside!

59
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,625
(Thunder)

60
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,417
Marshal.

61
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,250
When I accept guardianship over men
who take the vows of silence,

62
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,625
I'm also informed of what led them to me
in the first place.

63
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,708
I know the Templars
placed a heavy burden on you.

64
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,542
I know you're deeply scarred.

65
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,083
The cross on your tunic

66
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:57,125
is a symbol
of your faith in God's will.

67
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,417
It should not be full of the torment
it now bears upon your soul.

68
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,625
When we arrive at Canterbury,

69
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,042
I'm requesting your leave from
the Order of the Knights Templar.

70
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,167
(Birds twittering)

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,208
(Men whispering)

72
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,625
(Men chatter and laugh)

73
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,417
(Whispers orders)

74
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,958
(Shouting)

75
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,458
(Grunts)

76
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:00,958
- (Man) Garrison men!
- (People shouting)

77
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,167
(Whimpers) King John!

78
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,000
(Officer) Men, to the gates!
It's the King!

79
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,208
Open the gates for the King!

80
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,375
Psst!

81
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,542
Marshal, did you see royal colours?

82
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,583
(Cheering)

83
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:40,125
(Grunting)

84
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,625
(Shouting in Danish)

85
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,583
(Laughter)

86
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,875
Is that your hand, Darnay?

87
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,208
Forced, Your Highness.

88
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:04,583
The barons threatened my life,
forcing me to sign it and betray you.

89
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,583
I know the feeling.

90
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,417
Hang him!

91
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,750
(Laughter)

92
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,458
This insanity must cease.

93
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,208
Open the door.
His quarrel is not with us.

94
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,583
If you three stand before the King,
there will be nothing but death.

95
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,958
(Sobbing)

96
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,875
(Lively chatter)

97
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:42,292
What good fortune, Darnay.
It seems you will have your last rites.

98
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,750
My Lord, Templars.

99
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,375
(Darnay) He's travelling en route
to Canterbury with Templars.

100
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,208
- (Abbot Marcus grunts)
- (Men chuckling)

101
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,292
To what do I owe the pleasure
of the Church visiting my castle?

102
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,583
We were in the storm, sire.
Baron Darnay granted us your hospitality.

103
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,500
- We?
- My fellow priests.

104
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,958
Ah, yes, I heard.

105
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,292
Templars.

106
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:08,458
Sire, we entered your castle
as unarmed men. We seek no fight.

107
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,292
Are you aware, Abbot,

108
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,750
that your kind stood at Runnymede
and forced my signature,

109
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,667
and now you sleep under my roof?

110
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
Your Highness,
we travel to Canterbury

111
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,458
with simple articles of faith.

112
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,917
I ask your mercy that we may pass.

113
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,667
And I will grant you the same mercy

114
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:31,167
that the Church and the barons
of this country bestowed unto me.

115
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,958
"Do unto others",
isn't that right, Abbot?

116
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:38,292
(Men laugh)

117
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,167
(Shouts in Danish)

118
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,375
(Abbot Marcus groans)

119
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,000
(Groans)

120
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,250
(Men laugh and jeer)

121
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,458
(Screams)

122
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,917
(Choking)

123
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,833
(Tiberius shouting)

124
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,917
Tiberius!

125
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,125
(Grunts)

126
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,042
(Moans)

127
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,333
Don't let him go!

128
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:12,792
(Abbot Marcus moans)

129
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,833
Ride!

130
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:30,292
(Man shouts orders)

131
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,542
(Horse whinnies)

132
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,708
(Grunts)

133
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,333
(Men jeer and laugh)

134
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,625
(Abbot Marcus shivers)

135
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,375
(Groans)

136
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,208
(signs)

137
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,833
There is worth...

138
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,708
..in every death.

139
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:43,417
And I will see it now in yours.

140
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,708
(Birds twittering)

141
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,583
(signs)

142
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,083
(J' Choral chanting)

143
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,208
- You saw the King?
- Yes. And he saw me.

144
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,417
Mm.

145
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:33,042
I didn't imagine that even he
was capable of such cruelty.

146
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,208
Abbot Marcus was the finest of men.

147
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:41,083
Tell me, why did he request
that you leave the Order?

148
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:45,042
- Your Grace, I did not wish to be dismissed.
- But that's not what I asked.

149
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,792
You were in the Holy Lands?

150
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,625
Hm. Some men have returned
from defending our faith

151
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,083
only to find themselves questioning it.

152
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,792
Now you must ask yourself,
Thomas...

153
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,958
what is in your heart?

154
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,583
Rebellion or revenge.

155
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:09,042
I suppose it makes no difference
as the King has the devil in his.

156
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,958
(Man) I don't care if he's talking
to the Pope! I have to see him now!

157
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,667
And as we speak of the devil...

158
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,250
My Lord Archbishop.

159
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,125
They told me about Darnay.

160
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,292
We took John at his word...

161
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,000
and now he raises a bitch's army
with God's teeth.

162
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,417
I'll bow to no king with piss for blood!

163
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,958
Baron William de Albany,
Brother Thomas Marshal.

164
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,750
Brother Thomas
comes directly from Darnay Castle.

165
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:39,083
You must forgive our Baron,
his tongue is not always so profane.

166
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:40,625
(Chuckles)

167
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,667
Now, you should know
that Rome sides with the King.

168
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:50,083
And the Pope would bless
what the King did to Abbot Marcus?

169
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,292
More or less.

170
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:57,292
I am to be excommunicated
for writing Magna Carta.

171
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,875
- How long have we got?
- God knows.

172
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,833
(Marshal) Your Grace, this...

173
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,625
..king...must be stopped.

174
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,125
I cannot, in all honesty,
ask you to fight, Thomas,

175
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:17,083
but if you choose to take up
your sword, you have my blessing.

176
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,250
(Bell tolls)

177
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,833
(Chattering)

178
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,583
(Man shouting)

179
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:44,917
(Man shouts orders)

180
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,625
it's a good omen.

181
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,292
God is with us.

182
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:05,167
Prince Louis has an army
may be persuaded to join us.

183
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,500
Asking the French for help...

184
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,458
that's cursing the blind for the wicked.

185
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,083
If John takes the Dover Road to London

186
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,292
he has to cross the Medway here
at Rochester.

187
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,750
I'll seize Rochester Castle.

188
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,083
Delay them. That'll give you time
to negotiate with the French.

189
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,042
We have no force to fight the King.

190
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,167
I have a few men I can count on.

191
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,250
Absolutely not. Suicide is a sin
in the eyes of the Church, Baron.

192
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,750
Your Grace,
I'm afraid I only see one thing.

193
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:45,792
From Rochester, the King
is able to dispatch his troops and supplies

194
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,958
all over the country.

195
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,875
It is his keystone.
Without it we will not stop him.

196
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,792
All my sins to this.

197
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,208
May God protect what we are about to do.

198
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,458
Guy!

199
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,667
Squire!

200
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,458
I want you to ride back.

201
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:55,417
No. I know how to fight.

202
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,875
You see how he talks to me? (Laughs)

203
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,875
Have you ever killed a man, Squire?
Eh?

204
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:09,500
- Then you will learn, it is not a noble thing.
- Not even when it's for freedom?

205
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,292
Not even when it is for God.

206
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,500
Hah!

207
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:39,167
(Woman shouting)

208
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,542
(Laughing and jeering)

209
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,458
(Man) Look at you!

210
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,792
(All baying, shouting abuse)

211
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,375
Any one of you throws
a turd or a bean, I'll get you!

212
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,000
And you know I will! Yargh!

213
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,708
- Where's the butchers?
- Over there.

214
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,167
(Man in stocks) I'll remember your faces!

215
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,917
(Man) Sheep shears!
They're sharp! Sharp sheep shears!

216
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,708
- I'm looking for Daniel Marks.
- Wait here.

217
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:25,792
(Woman) Marks!

218
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,667
Whatever it is or how much...

219
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,375
- just get me out of here, Baron.
- Done. Where's de Lacy?

220
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,833
- He went back to Poitou.
- Becket?

221
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,042
You don't want him.

222
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,375
(Hums)

223
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,708
(Man 1) Templars.
(Man 2) They've come back.

224
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,708
(Chattering and laughing)

225
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,083
Here. You may need protection.

226
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,417
(Albany) Get up.

227
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:19,000
I said, get up!

228
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,208
You sack of shit!

229
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,500
(Becket) Billy.

230
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,542
What told me I'd see you?

231
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,792
What's with the altar boy?
Billy all tied up with God again?

232
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,958
- This is not our man.
- Hoy!

233
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,042
I'm his man,
don't you worry about that.

234
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,750
If he pays me enough,
I'll split the gut of any man alive.

235
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,583
Ain't that right, Billy boy?

236
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,750
(Lively chatter)

237
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,333
- (Man) Who's with you?
- Gil Becket. Daniel Marks.

238
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:08,792
The last time we were all together
must have been Dieppe.

239
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,875
The days
when the King was still good to us.

240
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,167
He's taken all the castles
along the coast.

241
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,375
If he takes Rochester,
he'll control southern England.

242
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:20,417
If the whispers I've heard are true,
he's too strong now.

243
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,083
He's got an army of Danish mercenaries.

244
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,000
Wait for him in London.

245
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:30,833
Do you think I want this?
I'm not a soldier, not any more.

246
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,750
I'm a fat wool merchant with
a hen-pecking wife and three daughters.

247
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,583
But, unfortunately,
he won't let it be.

248
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,375
I'm sorry, Baron. Not this one.

249
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,625
(Guy) I learnt about the Crusades.

250
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,542
Is it true what the Templar swords say?

251
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,958
"Blessed and omnipotent
is the warrior of Christ"'?

252
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,583
(Man whistles tune)

253
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,625
(Man in stocks laughs)

254
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,083
Yeah, water. Water.

255
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,292
(Grunts)

256
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,625
- Hey!
- Agh!

257
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,833
(Guy) What do you think he's worth?

258
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:51,167
- Are you sorry for what you've done?
- Bollocks.

259
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:58,417
- (Albany) Release him.
- Amen! (Laughs)

260
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,375
(Child) Papa!

261
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,375
Get inside. Now!

262
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,000
- Joseph.
- Baron.

263
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,458
- Daniel.
- Wulfstan.

264
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,917
Becket.

265
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,583
(Pants) You...are a filthy whore, Becket.

266
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,167
So was she.

267
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,625
We'll never hold that castle
with this lot.

268
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:26,250
They may not be worthy of that cross
you wear, but they'll hold the castle.

269
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,958
Not for England...
not for God...

270
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,500
but for me.

271
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:37,042
Winter's soon,
so if I'm not back by first snowfall,

272
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:42,167
take your sister to your aunt,
give her this. Hm?

273
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,125
Work hard.

274
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,917
Be polite.

275
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,417
(Horse whinnies)

276
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,750
(Shouting)

277
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,375
(Tiberius speaks Danish)

278
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,667
And what's written here is true?

279
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,208
From my ears to this paper, Sire.

280
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,500
Tiberius, six of your fastest scouts
to Rochester.

281
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,833
Instruct them to hold the castle.

282
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,875
- Kill anyone they find there.
- Hyah!

283
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,458
Money.

284
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,958
(Tiberius shouts orders)

285
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,833
And you know these men?

286
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:29,167
So what does that make you?

287
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,875
Worthless.

288
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:33,292
(Soldiers shout in Danish)

289
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,708
(Albany) There it is.

290
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,542
Looks small from here.

291
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,750
That...small castle...

292
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:54,167
controls all the land
as far as you can see.

293
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,708
Be patient, Squire.

294
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,750
As long as there's women.

295
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,292
(Laughs)

296
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:37,958
- What say you?
- I bring business from Archbishop Langton.

297
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,167
(Chatter, laughter)

298
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,458
(Hushed) Isabel!

299
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,667
We have company.

300
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:55,292
I have told you before,
I will not tolerate drinking.

301
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,167
You won't tolerate anything.

302
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,250
My Lord. We have men at the gate.

303
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,792
I tolerate the politics
of the King, Isabel.

304
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:17,375
Our marriage
was arranged for land and wealth.

305
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,208
It would be well
if you were to remember that.

306
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,542
And he owns us, body and soul.

307
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:30,167
(Sentry) Open the gates! Let 'em in!

308
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,833
You arrive unexpected,
Baron de Albany.

309
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:01,167
What matter
does His Grace send this late?

310
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,792
That we claim this castle
in the name of the rebellion.

311
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,500
If your visit is to claim
my castle, Baron...

312
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,708
you're too late.

313
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,917
(Horse whinnying)

314
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,083
Unusual saddles.

315
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,708
- Danish.
- What was that?

316
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:20,750
They're Danish.
They arrived last night.

317
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,958
(Lively chatter, laughter)

318
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:27,708
The King's scouts.
His army is less than a day away.

319
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,417
Oaks, get the guard here quickly.

320
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:58,542
That one was at Darnay Castle
two days ago.

321
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,750
(Shouting and screaming)

322
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,333
(Isabel gasps)

323
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:08,542
(Grunting and shouting)

324
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:09,875
Aargh!

325
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,125
(Isabel screams)

326
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,375
(Screams)

327
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,042
(Woman screams)

328
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:43,958
Argh!

329
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,375
- (Isabel screams)
- No. No, no!

330
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,083
Marshal, down!

331
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:02,833
(Screams and groans)

332
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:05,167
(Isabel gasps)

333
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,792
(Mercenary speaks Danish)

334
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:22,917
(Speaks Danish)

335
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,875
Yargh!

336
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,250
(Marks) Baron.

337
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,458
Stand down! Stand down!

338
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,333
Listen to me.

339
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:49,250
By the archbishop, we claim this castle
in the name of the rebellion.

340
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,708
The rebellion's over.
The King surrendered to the great charter.

341
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,958
Magna Carta.

342
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,792
This one sealed by the King's own hand.

343
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:02,917
And now...
he's executing everybody who supported it.

344
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:09,417
But does the Pope know that the Archbishop
is claiming royal castles, against the King?

345
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,375
I watched as three
of my brothers were killed

346
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:16,708
by the soft hand of a king that is
murdering his way across the country.

347
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:20,500
And he does so
with the Pope's blessing.

348
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:24,417
The French army make sail any day now.

349
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,875
Giving us...a new king.

350
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,375
A true king.

351
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,000
Seal the gates.

352
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:42,625
Lock all the doors! Move!
And, Oaks, no one else comes in.

353
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,250
(Oaks) Very well.

354
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,958
Well, Marshal...

355
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,208
you got us our castle. (Chuckles)

356
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:57,542
- What is your strength, Captain?
- Eleven men-at-arms.

357
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,292
- We have less than 20 men?
- And these walls.

358
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:04,292
- They've never been breached.
- Does the keep have a portcullis?

359
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,458
- It does.
- Good.

360
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:14,250
- (Oaks) Once it's down, no one gets in.
- Water. Where is the supply?

361
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:18,708
From the Well. Draws straight from the river.
No one here gets thirsty.

362
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,875
- it's good, it's not sick or brackish?
- Water's good, sir.

363
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,667
(Man shouts)

364
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,875
(Marshal) Guy, with me.

365
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:33,375
(Marshal) These walls are designed
to be defended by one man per station.

366
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,458
Outlook is perfect.
Any approach can be seen for miles.

367
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,917
Now, let's see the gatehouse.

368
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:49,875
You, day or night, stay alert.
Now open it up.

369
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,083
(Birds twittering)

370
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,875
What's the problem?

371
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,458
There's no moat.

372
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,833
That'll do.

373
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,083
Now, when they come...

374
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,542
..hit them hard.

375
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,083
Hit the post.

376
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:44,292
(Laughing)

377
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:47,667
I said, hit the post. Hard.

378
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,292
(Grunts)

379
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,875
They'll come? The French.

380
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:58,958
We waited for the French at Damascus.
They didn't come then.

381
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:02,708
Even to a Frenchman I think
Rochester is nearer than Damascus.

382
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,083
Hit it.

383
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,875
You better hit it harder than that, boy.

384
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:17,083
Or you'll be dead
before they get here. (Cackles)

385
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,917
They hate women.

386
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Just to look at one's a sin.

387
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,125
Some people say they worship the devil.

388
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,708
Celibates with stone hearts.

389
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:46,375
Then I have a stone heart, too, Maddy.

390
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,042
I didn't mean it like that.

391
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:55,042
A Templar offers his Chastity to God,

392
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,833
but a wife...

393
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,667
she suffers hers by her husband.

394
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,875
My husband's appetites don't include me.

395
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,583
(Chuckles) Thank the Lord Mary herself.

396
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,875
(Grunting, noisy chewing)

397
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:26,042
Now, I am... (Coughs)
"curious, Albany.

398
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:31,042
Why is it that you and your friends
are so struck with this rebellion?

399
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:34,083
- Mm.
- (Guy) Cos we are for the people.

400
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:38,750
I see your esquire is well-trained
in the art of naivety.

401
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,667
- Go on.
- (Guy) Call me naive if you will, sir,

402
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,833
but the people deserve more than
a king that treats them like animals.

403
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:47,167
Ah, bold words for a Squire.

404
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,250
Have you read Magna Carta?

405
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,958
- I...
- Ah, I see. You can't read Latin.

406
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:57,417
It's a pity, arguing from ignorance.

407
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:04,083
Argumentum ad ignorantiam,
ab uno disce omnes.

408
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,208
That's Roman, innit?

409
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:12,792
From one person, learn all people.

410
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,042
(Man) Excuse my wife's bold tongue.

411
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,583
(Sniffs)

412
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:38,083
Becket,
I'm gonna need you on the far wall.

413
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,917
- Guy can't defend it on his own.
- Do it yourself.

414
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,167
What?

415
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,500
You want a drink? A woman?

416
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,250
Don't you sniff your nose at me.

417
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,250
I've been places. I've seen what
your holy brothers have done.

418
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,917
Your pious bile makes me sick.

419
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,125
Becket. I want you outside.

420
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,958
I'll watch your boy's back,
but who's watching mine?

421
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:11,083
(Shouts command)

422
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,542
(Phipps) To the battlements!

423
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,625
- To the battlements!
- Right away!

424
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:24,083
- Take your positions, men!
- Get those men up here, quickly!

425
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,792
(Shouting)

426
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,625
(Phipps) Mercel, they're here!

427
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,583
Let's see what rats
have taken up in my home.

428
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,917
(Man 1) Move it!
(Man 2) Come on!

429
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,083
Albany, a word. You cannot engage the King
without considering terms.

430
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:53,167
He wants our heads on spikes.
Where are the terms in that?

431
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:56,417
There are some in here
who didn't pick this fight.

432
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,875
Ask yourself who you're for, Cornhill.

433
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:02,667
The King or the country?
Because we both can't be wrong.

434
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,333
They're here.

435
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,125
(King John) Albany!

436
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,417
Albany!

437
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,000
(Wulfstan) How did he know?
(Albany) What can we do for you, John?

438
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,333
(Chuckles)

439
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,708
Baron William de Albany.

440
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:35,000
The Pope has ordered me
to reclaim my country.

441
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:41,417
Now, surely you don't bar your door
against a king, and the Church?

442
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,375
Does he know you sealed a charter...

443
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,917
giving the people of England freedom,

444
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and that now you go back on your word?

445
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,750
England is mine, Albany.

446
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:57,167
God's will bestowed it unto me,
the Pope blesses it to me,

447
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:00,417
and this castle belongs to me!

448
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,208
You're no more a king...

449
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:04,417
than the boil on my arse!

450
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:07,250
Huh.

451
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,583
What a tedious little man.

452
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:13,083
(Men shouting orders)

453
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,167
Get the swords now. Come on!

454
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,750
(Man) Move yourselves!

455
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,458
(Marshal) Stay by your posts.

456
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:27,333
Remember,
they have to climb over these walls.

457
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,333
And we do not.

458
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,667
So you stand firm!

459
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:38,875
Have you ever fought so many with so few?

460
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:43,208
Uh-huh.
Don't you forget, you hold the wall, huh?

461
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:45,917
Now, go to your post.

462
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,583
- (Breathes heavily)
- (Man) North and south advance!

463
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:12,458
(Man) Get ready, archers!

464
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,542
Loose!

465
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,583
Take cover!

466
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,875
(Screaming)

467
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,583
(Moaning)

468
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,208
And again! Take cover!

469
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,958
(Man) Get down!

470
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,542
Ha-ha!

471
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,625
(Man shouts command)

472
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,375
(Oaks) Come on, lads, come on!
Take your positions! Look lively!

473
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,083
Take cover, lads! Take cover!

474
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,500
Argh!

475
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,292
Again!

476
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,458
Argh!

477
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,375
(Screaming)

478
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:17,042
(All shout, roar)

479
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,458
(Marshal) Albany!

480
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,833
(Marshal) Archers! They're coming!

481
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,417
Make a stand! Ready?

482
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,833
Load arrows!

483
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:35,917
Loose!

484
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,375
(Screaming, sobbing)

485
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:03,083
- Oil! Bring up that oil!
- Ready!

486
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,667
Loose!

487
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
(Shouts orders in Danish)

488
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,875
Oil! Watch your back!

489
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:15,917
- (Sizzling)
- (Screams)

490
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:19,208
(Yelling)

491
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,458
(Screaming)

492
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,250
(Man shouting)

493
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:50,542
(Man) Take cover!

494
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,458
Becket!

495
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:41,458
(Cornhill whispers) Come on. This way.

496
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,375
(Man screaming)

497
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:46,958
(Whispers)

498
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:50,542
- What do we do?
- Pray God is with them.

499
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:54,583
(Albany) Becket!

500
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,292
Ha, ha-ha-ha-ha!

501
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:10,875
(Screams)

502
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,917
Guy!

503
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,583
Show that to your mother!

504
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,417
Now, get up!

505
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,333
I said get up!

506
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:48,500
Now, you hit him. Hard!

507
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:04,083
Behind you! Clear!

508
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:05,833
(Marshal) Take cover!

509
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:24,542
Aargh!

510
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,125
(Shouting in Danish)

511
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:13,375
(Screams)

512
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,708
(Phipps) They're running!

513
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:20,792
(Marks) They're retreating!
They've had enough, Baron.

514
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,625
(Shouting)

515
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,375
(Pants)

516
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,625
(Man) Bastards! Go on, run!

517
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:57,667
(Man) Come on, you foreign whores!
(Cackles)

518
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,833
(Breathes heavily)

519
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:09,167
(Whimpering and sobbing)

520
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:23,125
(Breathes heavily)

521
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,500
(Marshal breathes heavily)

522
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,458
You fought bravely.

523
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,417
You did not see everything.

524
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,958
There's no finding peace
after knowing this.

525
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:56,875
Faith, Guy.

526
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:03,583
Only the weak believe
that what they do in battle...

527
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,917
is who they are as men.

528
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,750
(Grunting, straining)

529
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:24,000
(Man) Put him with the others.

530
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:28,625
(Man) Pack 'em over there.
Over there, that's it.

531
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:32,375
Baron Albany...

532
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,292
in less than a day...

533
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:38,375
you have stripped away everything
I gave the people in this castle.

534
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:43,583
- Get off my back.
- You were hellbent on this fight!

535
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:49,042
You made us all hostages
to your cause, not the rebellion's.

536
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,375
And this was not just another castle!

537
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,917
This was my home!

538
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,792
Now clear your mess up.

539
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,667
- (Becket grunts)
- (Gasps)

540
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,250
(Breathes heavily)

541
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,625
Shut the door.

542
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:17,875
(Woman gasps)

543
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,917
(Woman) Still now.

544
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:40,375
(Soldier yells with pain)

545
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,667
(Marshal) Wait. Here.

546
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,625
- This man is bleeding.
- On the table.

547
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,500
(Soldier cries out)

548
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,125
No. Wait.
This will stop the flow.

549
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:01,792
I'm gonna pull this hard.

550
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:03,917
(Soldier cries out, groans)

551
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:07,917
(Wulfstan) The bone's not broken, but...

552
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:13,000
(Laughs) Go on, do it, do it.

553
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,625
(Grunting)

554
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:23,042
(Screams)

555
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:27,500
Keep it clean, and watch him close.

556
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,250
(Isabel) Templar.

557
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,583
- Your neck.
- No.

558
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,917
Sit.

559
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:39,667
Please.

560
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:22,417
If the bleeding doesn't stop,
shall I fasten a belt around your neck?

561
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,708
My maid tells me you cannot look at women.

562
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:38,625
What is your name?

563
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:46,208
Am I to assume your silence means
you cannot talk to women either?

564
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,833
My name is Thomas Marshal.

565
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:55,083
There it is.

566
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:08,708
And were many sacred vows
broken by that revelation?

567
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,583
(Gasps)

568
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,833
(Chattering)

569
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:47,042
It's not like the others.
The river naturally defends.

570
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:50,833
Walls built...
so a few can stop many.

571
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:53,042
Don't insult me, Captain.

572
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:55,708
I know the qualities of a Norman keep.

573
00:55:57,792 --> 00:56:00,042
What I am having trouble with...

574
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:05,958
is how a thousand men could have failed
so miserably against twenty.

575
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:09,042
Those men fight hard. For what?

576
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:11,167
A small rock in a field?

577
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,667
We go around.

578
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:19,292
My great, great grandfather
built that rock

579
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,875
when he conquered this country.

580
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:28,292
Strategically, it fortifies London
and controls all of southern England.

581
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:32,375
Why in God's name do you think they
chose to hole up there in the first place?

582
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:39,500
What will please
your people more, Captain?

583
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,958
That your men died in a great battle,

584
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:47,583
or that your reward for helping me
is the Church leaving your lands alone?

585
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:51,833
For that is what
the Pope promised he would do.

586
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:55,917
Now, however small it may seem...

587
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:01,208
..with that rock,
the rest of this country follows.

588
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,042
(Albany)
Now you see what he means to do.

589
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,125
I say this to each of you.

590
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,542
There's a night out there...

591
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:17,208
deep enough for a man to slip away,
if he should wish.

592
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:19,583
And I would understand.

593
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:25,917
(Wulfstan sighs)

594
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:29,708
I think you upset him.

595
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:34,208
What about you, Marks?

596
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:37,250
I took this for you at Angouléme.

597
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:40,083
I walked into this outside Toulouse.

598
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:44,292
Both times we saw it through.
What do you think I'm doing here?

599
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:49,542
I don't take a man's money and run.

600
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:56,583
Mr Phipps, are you and your
garrison men still for the fight?

601
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:59,917
All six of us. Good and ready, sir.

602
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,750
Ah!

603
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:06,500
(Snores)

604
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,208
(Laughter)

605
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:14,333
(Snoring continues)

606
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,708
(Birdsong)

607
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,625
(Maddy) I saw you with the Templar.

608
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,792
I think he has a mind for you.

609
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:34,583
His mind possesses nothing
I care to think about.

610
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:40,458
There is something not normal with him.
It's his manner.

611
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:43,667
He looks but won't talk.

612
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:47,542
Then he talks
and nothing he says settles with me.

613
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:51,917
Don't tell me that was his way before he
became a Templar. I wouldn't believe it.

614
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:54,167
- My Lady.
- What?

615
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:57,458
That's a great deal of thinking...

616
00:58:57,583 --> 00:59:00,542
for someone
you don't want to think about.

617
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:04,917
(Maddy) Hm.

618
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:13,958
(Soldier) They're building something.

619
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,958
What do you think it is?

620
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,500
(Men shouting)

621
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:23,958
(Man) Your royal engineer, Sire.

622
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:29,042
- Will it work?
- There's no moat, er... So, er...

623
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:34,208
(King John)
There's no moat and no excuses. Finish it.

624
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:41,167
(King John) Tell him to construct a...

625
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,125
(Isabel) I am sorry for what I said to you.

626
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,750
I was wrong.

627
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:06,833
(Grunts)

628
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,000
What happens next...to us?

629
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,250
- All of us?
- They will attack again.

630
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:17,917
And we will hold again.

631
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,500
The French...

632
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:25,958
..made sail
with an army to stand by us.

633
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,792
You really believe they will come?

634
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,250
Hm.

635
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:36,125
Thou shall not lie, Thomas.

636
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:38,458
Certainly not for the French.

637
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:42,125
Definitely not to me.
It isn't worth it.

638
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:59,292
Does that break Templar laws?

639
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:01,208
Mm.

640
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,292
Some would say yes.

641
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:09,708
Put the sword down.

642
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:17,292
If they do come,
I will need to know how to use this.

643
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:24,833
- Is this how you hold it?
- If you want your opponent to win.

644
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:35,583
I fight...

645
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,333
..so you don't have to.

646
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:02,292
Siege tower.

647
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:05,042
(Marks) Making quick work of it.
(Albany) Damn it.

648
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,625
Baron, I have an idea.

649
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:24,583
What happens if this doesn't work?

650
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:27,208
- Don't ask.
- What could be worse than this?

651
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:32,000
Squire, would you ever kill a woman?

652
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:36,292
- Never.
- Not even if it meant saving her life?

653
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:39,958
(Soldier) That's it, heave it down.

654
01:02:44,542 --> 01:02:46,167
(Laughter)

655
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:49,167
Holy Saint Joseph! Look who it is.

656
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:52,042
His Majesty is ready, my Lord.

657
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:56,208
(Wulfstan laughs)

658
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:02,042
- Prince Louis holds in France.
- They haven't sailed yet?

659
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:06,042
- He's buying time to negotiate terms.
- Negotiate terms!

660
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,875
The King enslaves this country,

661
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,833
the Pope defends him
and calls the Magna Carta heresy,

662
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:15,583
and France uses this tyranny
for a better deal?

663
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,458
- Are there any men willing to fight?
- A few.

664
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:22,458
Many thought the rebellion was over
because John signed the Magna Carta.

665
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:25,583
In some ways,
it was the smartest thing he did.

666
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:27,750
Well, all that is done.

667
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:30,375
Let Rome pronounce
whatever holy dictum it pleases.

668
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,875
They won't tell me
that God is their possession.

669
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:37,292
I leave for France at once.
You gather what men you can.

670
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:40,292
And prepare London for war.

671
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:42,292
And Rochester?

672
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:47,083
- Baron Albany?
- Pray God is with them.

673
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:52,208
(Marks) Take cover!

674
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:56,208
(Screams)

675
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,625
(Screaming and shouting)

676
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,125
Excellent. Excellent.

677
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,000
(Grunting and straining)

678
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:13,792
Go on. Faster!

679
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,417
(Grunting and straining)

680
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,625
(Wulfstan) Lock it!

681
01:04:30,542 --> 01:04:33,542
- Lock!
- And fire!

682
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,125
They have built an engine?

683
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,500
(Roaring)

684
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:44,750
Yargh!

685
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:52,833
(Anxious shouting)

686
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:01,042
(Man) Take cover!

687
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:03,250
(Women scream)

688
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:07,792
(Isabel) All of you, outside.

689
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:09,667
(Breathes heavily)

690
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,292
(Shouting and screaming)

691
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:14,917
- (Laughter)
- (Marshal) Wulfstan, you've broken through!

692
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:17,833
Now, come on! Give them hellfire!

693
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:21,292
(Wulfstan) Heave!
(Men) Heave!

694
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:25,792
Aargh!

695
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,958
(Wulfstan) Lock it!
Fire pot, Guy!

696
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:36,167
(Phipps) You heathen dogs!

697
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:57,542
(Man) Bring it a bit forward!

698
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:01,000
(Wulfstan) Light it!
(Man) Light it!

699
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,250
(Wulfstan) Loose!

700
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,250
(Man) Yeah!

701
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:13,083
Goddamn devils!
Murdering goddamn whores!

702
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,542
(Marshal) Yes! They burn!

703
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,292
(All cheer)

704
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,250
Do not record that!

705
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:27,375
(Grunts) Bitches!

706
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,708
(Screaming)

707
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:40,708
(Shouting in Danish)

708
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:07,708
This bastard king, Wulfstan.

709
01:07:07,792 --> 01:07:09,667
Aye.

710
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:19,667
(Narrator) After that,
the king did not come again.

711
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:23,542
But the rains did.

712
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:28,583
And the days grew short
as autumn turned to winter.

713
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:33,208
They were too cold to Fight,
and too hungry.

714
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,625
The castle stores were empty...

715
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,125
and they had taken to eating the horses.

716
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,917
Save for one.

717
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:45,708
Marshal's.

718
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:50,125
But a Templar
is forbidden to eat his horse.

719
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:54,625
Their Order dictates
that it must die in battle.

720
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:59,292
So 13 hungry souls
and one horse would remain.

721
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:04,333
Still they waited.

722
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:06,750
And so too did the King.

723
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:13,958
They could smell his food,
hear his army's song.

724
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:20,292
For attrition is one man's ally
and another man's curse.

725
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,625
So they became cursed men.

726
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,792
And as weeks turned to months,

727
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:29,917
their minds took
to places they should not...

728
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:37,333
where a man sees only doubt
and has no worth at all.

729
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:02,750
On my wedding day
I knew my marriage would have no love.

730
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:06,667
Yet still I took my vows to God.

731
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:09,042
(Marshal mumbles)

732
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:13,542
I honoured and obeyed
my commitments daily.

733
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:21,167
You think we are not the same, Thomas,
but you're wrong.

734
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:44,458
- I'm starving!
- What do you want me to do?

735
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,917
Someone's gotta do something!

736
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:51,167
(Isabel) Listen to me.

737
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:55,125
Damn your Templar vows!

738
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:02,708
It was my vows
that made me what I am.

739
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:06,333
It was my Order that brought me here.

740
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,083
And by God's good grace,

741
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:13,833
it will be the Templars
that save your life.

742
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,708
Where are you going?

743
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:24,000
Why are you leaving?

744
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:35,250
(Lively chatter, laughter)

745
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:46,583
Why would he leave?

746
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,667
My Lady, you were with him last.

747
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,708
Did he say why he left?

748
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:00,875
You go to your chamber.

749
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:03,583
Now.

750
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,375
No.

751
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,958
(Shouting and jeering)

752
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,000
(Shouting in Danish)

753
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:35,542
I'll kiss the Bishop's arse
if he comes back.

754
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:47,167
You're gonna have to kiss a king's arse,
Becket, cos they're coming back again.

755
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,833
- it's Thomas!
- (Guy) Open the gates!

756
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:56,750
(Albany) Becket, get him!
(Guy) Get him, Becket!

757
01:11:56,875 --> 01:12:01,375
(Albany) Come oh! Quickly! Help him!
(Marshal) Get the sacks. The sacks!

758
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:03,833
- Come on!
- (Isabel) Hurry!

759
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:07,333
- Run!
- (Man) Close the portcullis!

760
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:16,292
What was you thinking, Templar?

761
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:20,042
He's stolen the king's food.
I've never seen such a thing!

762
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:22,542
(All laugh)

763
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:24,792
(Shouting)

764
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:29,208
(Tiberius shouts in Danish)

765
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,583
You are relieved of your command, Captain.

766
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,667
Get back in your rowboat and go home.

767
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:50,875
- I'm not leaving without my men!
- Oh yes, you are!

768
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:54,458
And I will tell you why.
The Pope has had a change of heart.

769
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,000
What do you say?

770
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:59,625
I say that when your pathetic little army
arrives back at your houses,

771
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,250
you will find your lands Christianised.

772
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:06,792
Your sons enslaved to the Church
and your wives serving new husbands.

773
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:09,417
You did not speak to the Pope
of my lands?

774
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:13,708
(Laughs) Why in God's name
would I do that?

775
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,458
Take this castle, Tiberius!

776
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:20,833
And if you do not, you will be sailing
home to quite a different world.

777
01:13:29,792 --> 01:13:31,292
(Rolling thunder)

778
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:38,625
Well, Marshal, you sure know
how to pick a bit of shank. (Laughs)

779
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:42,125
(Wulfstan) Better than
three months of horse meat.

780
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,542
(Man) I'll stick with the pig.
(Becket) Then what?

781
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:47,500
- I'll eat you.
- (Laughter)

782
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,000
(Woman chuckles)

783
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,667
(Laughter and cheering)

784
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:04,750
(Maddy) Oh!
(Albany) Hey! Hey! Hey!

785
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:07,375
(Laughter and chatter continues)

786
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:14,333
So, Squire...

787
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,750
you can read words?

788
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:22,042
And write them too?

789
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,208
What's your full name?

790
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:33,042
Jedediah Coteral.

791
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:35,250
(Distant laughter)

792
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:48,292
Jedediah Coteral.

793
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:51,958
Jedediah Coteral.

794
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:54,917
Yeah.

795
01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:00,208
I've never seen it written before. Huh.

796
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,667
Hm.

797
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:20,458
(Coteral chuckles)

798
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:02,292
(Moans)

799
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:09,208
(Isabel sighs)

800
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:36,375
(Footsteps)

801
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:48,708
(Wulfstan) It's too quiet.
Check the far wall.

802
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:13,792
(Guy sighs)

803
01:18:25,917 --> 01:18:27,083
(Guy grunts)

804
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:28,375
(Shouting)

805
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,875
To the battlements! Attack!

806
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:33,958
(Man) Cover the west wing.
West wing! Come on!

807
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,917
(Men shouting orders)

808
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:38,833
- Watch out!
- To the right!

809
01:18:38,958 --> 01:18:41,333
(Panting and shouting)

810
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:45,833
(Man) Help me!

811
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:48,083
(Shouting)

812
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:52,042
(Becket) The gates! The gates!

813
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:30,292
(Guy) Where's Marshal?

814
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:32,208
Fight, Guy! Fight!

815
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,292
Baron!

816
01:20:00,417 --> 01:20:01,667
Aargh!

817
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:06,333
(Echoing) Baron!

818
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:10,542
(Gasps)

819
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,500
(Albany groans)

820
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:28,000
Don't move. Be still.

821
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:29,333
(Pants)

822
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:31,667
- Hold the keep.
- You can't die.

823
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:36,667
You can't die. Stay alive!
You hear me?

824
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:39,542
Hold the keep! Go! Go!

825
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:09,708
(Laboured breathing)

826
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,417
Yaargh!

827
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:20,333
(All roar)

828
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,458
Phipps!

829
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:36,292
- Come here!
- (Coteral) Hold the gates!

830
01:21:36,417 --> 01:21:38,583
(Grunting)

831
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:40,583
I've got it. I've got it.

832
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:42,958
Come on, to the gates!

833
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,333
(Man) Hold!

834
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:46,083
All in! All in!

835
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:55,000
(Man) Stand fast!

836
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,708
(Man) Shield wall!

837
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,875
(Coteral) Shields. Shields up!

838
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,333
Up!

839
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:04,333
Brace yourselves.

840
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:06,833
(Man) Ready! Ready!

841
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:09,417
(Shouting and screaming)

842
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:52,333
(Groans)

843
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:58,750
(Screams)

844
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:00,875
- Isabel!
- (Wulfstan) Get inside!

845
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,000
Now!

846
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:04,375
(Man shouts in Danish)

847
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:20,458
(Shouting)

848
01:23:21,583 --> 01:23:22,833
(Groans)

849
01:23:53,667 --> 01:23:55,208
(Grunts)

850
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,125
(Shouting and grunting)

851
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:59,625
- We have to get to the Baron!
- To the keep!

852
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:03,250
- We can't leave him!
- He's gone, all right?

853
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:17,958
Hold the steps! Hold the steps!

854
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:19,583
(Marshal) Come on!

855
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:25,083
Marshal!

856
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:42,292
(Man) Pull him down!

857
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,500
(Guy) Marshal!
(Coteral) Come on!

858
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,000
(Marshal) Get it off! Get it off!

859
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:12,125
(Isabel strains)

860
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:14,125
(Marshal gasps)

861
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,750
Get back, behind the portcullis!

862
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:21,667
(Cornhill) Come on!

863
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:30,167
(Sobs)

864
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:46,750
(Panting)

865
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,250
(Cornhill) They have prisoners.

866
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:51,250
(Danes shouting)

867
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:56,375
(Groans)

868
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,833
Boy!

869
01:25:58,958 --> 01:26:01,083
(Man shouting in Danish)

870
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:07,292
(Man shouts in Danish)

871
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:11,333
(Groans)

872
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:15,042
Good afternoon, Baron.
Did you find my castle to your liking?

873
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:17,042
It's the people's castle now.

874
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:21,292
You said he was gone.

875
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:25,750
Those two.
Cut off their hands and feet.

876
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:29,333
- No.
- No!

877
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,750
(Whimpers) No!

878
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:35,083
No!

879
01:26:36,167 --> 01:26:40,333
Now, Baron,
I want my keep back.

880
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:46,042
- At my command!
- (Man) No!

881
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,792
- They'll never surrender.
- Really?

882
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:52,292
Do it!

883
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:54,042
(Cheering)

884
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,500
(Coteral) Do something!
(Marshal) We hold the keep.

885
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:14,500
- (Grunting)
- My arse, your stinking castle!

886
01:27:14,583 --> 01:27:16,625
(Groans)

887
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,875
Aaargh!

888
01:27:32,292 --> 01:27:33,708
- Aargh!
- (Cheering)

889
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,042
God damn you, you murdering whore!

890
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:41,042
Isn't that the king I am?

891
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:44,917
You betray all that's meant to be king.

892
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:47,958
You betray God!

893
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:50,375
I betray God?!

894
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:57,167
My crown was passed to me by my brother,
and my father before him.

895
01:27:57,292 --> 01:28:00,458
I was born to be a king!

896
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:04,625
It is my birthright!
Given to me by God!

897
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:07,542
You cry for the common man

898
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:11,792
and in the same breath
you curse the crown that protects him!

899
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:15,333
You dare to question my reign...

900
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:18,250
and the lineage of Kings
who have reigned before me?!

901
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:22,750
The great amaranthine royalty
of Aquitaine...

902
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:27,792
..who forged this land
from barbarian hordes

903
01:28:27,917 --> 01:28:31,042
and made it noble and pure!

904
01:28:31,167 --> 01:28:33,792
Who gave it order, meaning,

905
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:35,500
and even faith...

906
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:39,333
to thousands of years of loyal subjects!

907
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:42,042
And it is all now questioned by you!

908
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:45,917
And we are forced
to sign your precious Magna Carta,

909
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,750
forced by you, a wool merchant!

910
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:55,375
I am the blood!
I am God's right hand!

911
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:01,500
And you will never
dictate to me how I am to be a king!

912
01:29:01,625 --> 01:29:03,750
(Pants)

913
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:07,250
Now, Baron.

914
01:29:08,667 --> 01:29:11,667
Which hand did you touch me with?

915
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:15,583
Hold his hand down.

916
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:19,000
Hold his right hand down!

917
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,417
(Albany groans)

918
01:29:21,542 --> 01:29:24,417
This is not something you should see.

919
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:30,250
(Snorts)

920
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:31,625
(Albany groans)

921
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:44,875
Aargh!

922
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:52,083
Tell your rebels to open the gate, Albany!

923
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:54,583
No surrender!

924
01:29:56,458 --> 01:30:00,833
- No surrender!
- Put his other hand up! Do it!

925
01:30:02,875 --> 01:30:04,042
Do it!

926
01:30:04,167 --> 01:30:05,417
Aargh!

927
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:09,708
(Guy) We hold, Baron!

928
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:11,958
We hold!

929
01:30:13,292 --> 01:30:16,167
Put his feet up. Put his feet up!

930
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:20,083
Cornhill!

931
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:22,958
You will yield to your king!

932
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:27,208
Or, as God hears me,
your head is on a spike!

933
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:28,583
(Whimpers)

934
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:41,083
Now, that monster that they've made,
strap his carcass to it.

935
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:42,500
Strap him to it!

936
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:45,417
(Shouting, jeering)

937
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:55,250
Heave!

938
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:57,583
(Cheering)

939
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:09,458
There's no one coming, is there?

940
01:31:09,542 --> 01:31:11,167
(Whimpers)

941
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:12,917
(Banging)

942
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:39,167
(Breathes heavily)

943
01:31:39,292 --> 01:31:41,792
(Approaching footsteps)

944
01:31:48,417 --> 01:31:50,583
My scouts report
the French have left Calais.

945
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:54,208
They'll be at our back within days.

946
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:57,250
Do you know that when I was a child,

947
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:04,375
I once secretly ate every urn
of my father's beloved honey peaches.

948
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,292
And the next day...

949
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:10,917
he brought before me a servant girl
that he had accused of the crime.

950
01:32:12,042 --> 01:32:15,917
And he placed her hand on the table,
and he drew his knife...

951
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:20,958
..and he delivered the punishment.

952
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:24,417
And that night,
unable to contain my shame,

953
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:28,042
I confessed to him that it was I,

954
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:31,292
his son,
who had committed the crime.

955
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,042
Do you know what his response was?

956
01:32:33,167 --> 01:32:36,167
He said, "l know.

957
01:32:36,292 --> 01:32:38,417
"l know.

958
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:41,958
"And that is why I only cut off her finger.

959
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:45,458
"You see, John,
any action against the throne

960
01:32:45,542 --> 01:32:47,542
"must be punished ruthlessly.

961
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:55,208
"For that is the only way
to maintain the absolute power...

962
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,417
"..of a king."

963
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,125
(Breathes deeply)

964
01:33:57,625 --> 01:33:59,000
(Footsteps)

965
01:34:17,542 --> 01:34:21,333
When they come,
you must demand to see the King.

966
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:23,583
I want nothing from him.

967
01:34:24,667 --> 01:34:26,333
Not even mercy.

968
01:34:29,292 --> 01:34:31,417
(Isabel sighs)

969
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:37,833
I broke my vow, Isabel.

970
01:34:38,917 --> 01:34:40,917
I have betrayed God's trust.

971
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,542
What we did was a sin.

972
01:34:44,667 --> 01:34:47,542
Stop hiding...
behind vows and commandments.

973
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:53,875
The vows speak of loyalty
and abstinence and murder, but...

974
01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:57,542
why never love, Thomas?

975
01:34:57,667 --> 01:34:59,792
The vows of the Order...

976
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:05,583
..protect my soul from the blood
I've spilt in God's name.

977
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:08,583
It was the Church
that made you do those things.

978
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:11,333
It was the Templars that gave you a sword

979
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:13,208
and the name of God to wield it.

980
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:15,958
It was the Templars that made you kill.

981
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:19,875
Who were you before them?

982
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:25,792
What was so bad about that man then
that makes you resist your desires now?

983
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,750
Thomas...

984
01:35:33,542 --> 01:35:35,292
I am not a sin.

985
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:42,125
(Man) Sire? Sire?

986
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:48,292
Your engineer, sire.
The mine is ready.

987
01:35:48,417 --> 01:35:50,208
Will it work?

988
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:54,875
- it's right under the keep's foundations.
- Ah.

989
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:59,833
Then take note.

990
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:05,000
To my justiciar, send to me 40 pigs.

991
01:36:06,417 --> 01:36:08,542
The least good for eating.

992
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:13,458
Deliver that at once.

993
01:36:13,542 --> 01:36:18,917
(Man) Come on! Hurry up! Move it!

994
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:27,000
That's it.

995
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:31,125
- Where you going?
- I'm going to plead for terms.

996
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,375
(Becket) No!

997
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:35,500
(Cornhill) What else is there to do?
(Guy) We hold.

998
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:39,625
We hold for What? The French?
They're not coming.

999
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:43,292
- I'll ask for terms.
- (Guy) No!

1000
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:48,708
We swore an oath. An oath!

1001
01:36:48,792 --> 01:36:51,417
To Albany. To England.

1002
01:36:51,542 --> 01:36:54,042
Your oath is worthless.

1003
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:58,833
Magna Carta is worthless.

1004
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:00,875
The Church has annulled it.

1005
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,875
Whatever happens here is meaningless.

1006
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:07,875
- (Guy breathes heavily)
- No. No. Wait!

1007
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,375
(Cornhill groans)

1008
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:12,750
- That's enough, Squire.
- Becket?

1009
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:16,083
Your boy here
tried to take the old man's head off.

1010
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:18,583
Becket, leave him be.

1011
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:23,958
(Becket's knife thuds)

1012
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:27,458
Now, Guy...get away from him.

1013
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:30,250
- Now.
- Or what?

1014
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:33,625
You'll kill me?

1015
01:37:35,083 --> 01:37:36,958
- Guy...
- Shut up!

1016
01:37:37,917 --> 01:37:41,667
Baron de Albany
gave his life for his beliefs.

1017
01:37:43,792 --> 01:37:46,292
What have you given for yours?

1018
01:37:46,417 --> 01:37:47,792
Coward.

1019
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:50,000
(Cornhill sighs)

1020
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:04,625
There's no salvation to this end.

1021
01:38:05,833 --> 01:38:07,625
Our souls...

1022
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:10,625
are damned.

1023
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:19,542
You are not a coward.

1024
01:38:56,917 --> 01:39:00,292
- (Becket) What are you doing?
- I'm writing my name.

1025
01:39:01,417 --> 01:39:03,292
How do you do that?

1026
01:39:03,417 --> 01:39:06,042
Master Guy taught me.

1027
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:08,833
Well, that's you all done then.

1028
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:11,083
What makes a man like you so angry?

1029
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:13,208
I've been angry so long...

1030
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:16,000
- I don't even remember.
- (Laughs)

1031
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:21,500
(Sighs) it's kept you
alive though, I suppose.

1032
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:27,417
(Sighs) I don't think
it's gonna get us through this one.

1033
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,625
(Squealing)

1034
01:39:47,542 --> 01:39:52,458
- What do you think they're doing?
- Pigs. For a sapper's fire.

1035
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:57,375
- Sappers?
- They're digging a mine underneath us.

1036
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:00,375
Pig's fat, it burns,
with the heat of a crucible.

1037
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,167
(Man) Make Way!

1038
01:40:04,542 --> 01:40:06,833
Go on! Go!

1039
01:40:09,917 --> 01:40:11,917
(Man) Whoa!

1040
01:40:12,042 --> 01:40:13,292
Whoa there!

1041
01:40:14,333 --> 01:40:15,583
Whoa!

1042
01:40:15,667 --> 01:40:18,042
Bring them in.

1043
01:40:19,458 --> 01:40:20,958
(Grunting)

1044
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:23,875
(Woman screams)

1045
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,292
(Gasps)

1046
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:28,458
(Maddy gasps)

1047
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:30,292
(Maddy quietly prays)

1048
01:40:49,917 --> 01:40:52,083
We've got a bigger problem.

1049
01:40:53,542 --> 01:40:55,792
(Man) Hah! Get in there!

1050
01:40:55,917 --> 01:40:57,792
Go on!

1051
01:40:57,917 --> 01:40:59,542
(Pigs squeal and grunt)

1052
01:41:04,667 --> 01:41:06,792
(Panting)

1053
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,667
(Squealing)

1054
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:41,542
(Coteral coughs)

1055
01:41:41,667 --> 01:41:43,792
(Marshal) Coteral.

1056
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:48,583
(Marshal) It's hot.

1057
01:41:48,667 --> 01:41:52,167
- So what are we gonna do now?
- (Becket) Templar.

1058
01:41:52,292 --> 01:41:54,417
We get to the other side of the keep.

1059
01:41:57,833 --> 01:41:59,583
(Shouts in Danish)

1060
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,750
(Pigs squealing)

1061
01:42:06,667 --> 01:42:09,583
Guy, take the women to the chapel, huh?

1062
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:10,958
Go!

1063
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:14,292
- (Isabel gasps)
- (Maddy) Hurry, Isabel.

1064
01:42:32,667 --> 01:42:34,958
(Becket) Get down! Get down!

1065
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:41,250
(Screaming)

1066
01:42:42,292 --> 01:42:44,333
(Cheering)

1067
01:42:48,917 --> 01:42:50,667
(Isabel screams)

1068
01:43:10,417 --> 01:43:11,958
(Cheering)

1069
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:24,083
(Coughing)

1070
01:43:24,208 --> 01:43:25,958
(Approaching footsteps)

1071
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:31,625
- I think he's gone.
- I'm not making that mistake again.

1072
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,500
Come on.

1073
01:43:38,208 --> 01:43:40,958
(Coteral) OK.
(Becket) One, two.

1074
01:43:41,083 --> 01:43:43,583
(All shout)

1075
01:43:50,625 --> 01:43:52,750
(Isabel breathes heavily)

1076
01:43:53,792 --> 01:43:56,583
Oh, Maddy. She was beside me.

1077
01:44:00,958 --> 01:44:03,375
(Shouting in Danish)

1078
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,625
(Coteral and Becket strain)

1079
01:44:06,792 --> 01:44:08,792
(Coteral) Becket. Becket.

1080
01:44:08,917 --> 01:44:11,042
(Pants)

1081
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:15,458
Ha!

1082
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:17,208
I'll hold them Off.

1083
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:20,042
How much did they pay
to get you out those stocks?

1084
01:44:20,125 --> 01:44:23,667
- Five shillings.
- That is cheaper than a whore.

1085
01:44:29,083 --> 01:44:31,083
(All shouting)

1086
01:44:31,208 --> 01:44:34,500
Come on, you filthy whores!

1087
01:44:48,292 --> 01:44:51,667
If they get through us,
you kill the women.

1088
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,667
- No.
- Say it.

1089
01:44:53,792 --> 01:44:55,833
- I can't.
- Say it!

1090
01:44:57,292 --> 01:44:58,542
I'll kill the women.

1091
01:45:04,042 --> 01:45:09,458
Come on, you whore! Yaargh!

1092
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:20,125
(Laughs)

1093
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:22,000
Aargh!

1094
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:29,208
(Men shout from below)

1095
01:45:55,125 --> 01:45:56,542
Aargh!

1096
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:25,500
(Shouting in Danish)

1097
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:40,750
(Shouts in Danish)

1098
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:51,375
Forgive me.

1099
01:46:56,167 --> 01:46:58,292
Thomas. Thomas!

1100
01:47:00,042 --> 01:47:02,292
(Grunts)

1101
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:05,333
Thomas!

1102
01:47:23,333 --> 01:47:25,750
Save her.

1103
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,625
No one touch him!

1104
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:37,458
How's your faith now, Templar?

1105
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:39,708
Why don't you come a little closer...

1106
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:44,250
..and I'll show you.

1107
01:48:17,208 --> 01:48:19,333
(Both grunt and groan)

1108
01:48:32,792 --> 01:48:34,667
(Horns blowing)

1109
01:48:34,792 --> 01:48:37,667
(Shouts in Danish)

1110
01:48:39,792 --> 01:48:41,667
(Shouts excitedly)

1111
01:48:46,667 --> 01:48:48,042
Yaaargh!

1112
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:52,375
(Panicking cries)

1113
01:51:14,125 --> 01:51:16,375
(Man shouts orders)

1114
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:35,458
You fought bravely.

1115
01:51:37,667 --> 01:51:39,417
Is killing a noble thing?

1116
01:51:42,708 --> 01:51:48,000
But a life fought for others
is a life worth living.

1117
01:51:49,083 --> 01:51:51,625
That is a noble thing.

1118
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:12,000
(signs)

1119
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,500
A French prince
now holds the English crown.

1120
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:26,458
Not an easy decision to make.

1121
01:52:27,625 --> 01:52:29,125
Nor was this one.

1122
01:52:30,167 --> 01:52:32,042
The Order's over for you, Thomas.

1123
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:36,333
You've earned your freedom
as much as any man.

1124
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:38,083
Your Grace.

1125
01:52:39,958 --> 01:52:41,583
Come on.

1126
01:52:51,625 --> 01:52:53,583
We held.

1127
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:04,167
(Whistling)

1128
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:08,625
(Horse whinnies)

1129
01:53:11,417 --> 01:53:14,542
(Narrator) Within a year,
the rebellion was won.

1130
01:53:14,667 --> 01:53:20,333
While fleeing for his life,
King John died of dysentery.

1131
01:53:20,458 --> 01:53:23,958
What was left of his treasure
was never recovered.

1132
01:53:25,958 --> 01:53:29,625
In time, the great keep of Rochester
was rebuilt.

1133
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:31,375
It stands to this day.

1134
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:37,125
So too does the noble dream that was...
Magna Carta.
