1
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,625
Who'd you bring home last year?

2
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,000
- Sheila? What was her name?
- I didn't go home last year.

3
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,750
What about the year before?

4
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,750
I'm not the first girl
you ever brought home, right?

5
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,500
Jackson! Oh, God!

6
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,917
This makes it worse.

7
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,000
You never told me it was like this.

8
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,667
It's a farm.

9
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,875
There's a mortgage.

10
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,875
It's no big deal.

11
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,542
Oh, my God.

12
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,708
Some little farmhouse you got here.

13
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,708
- Watch your step on the ice.
- Yes, dear.

14
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,667
Man !

15
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,167
Come along.
Don't be impressed.

16
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:32,583
- You'll wake her up.
- I'm sorry.

17
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,667
She's put you in the guest room.

18
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:39,792
Bummer. Where are you?

19
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,917
Across the hall.

20
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:46,000
- Well, it's her house.
- It's a Catholic thing.

21
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,708
Come on.

22
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,500
- No way.
- I'll sneak you back before she knows.

23
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,042
No way.

24
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,167
An angel in the kitchen
and a devil in the bedroom.

25
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:25,333
Now, that's what I like
in a man.

26
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,375
Oh, my God!

27
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,750
Oh, I am sorry.

28
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,792
I thought you were
in the other room.

29
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,083
I am in the other room.

30
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:41,958
I came in here this morning
to, uh, say hello.

31
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:45,292
Well, I guess I better hurry up
and be embarrassed.

32
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,583
I thought you were Jackson.

33
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,958
Yes, I could tell.

34
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,792
- Please forgive me.
- God, no.

35
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,042
Just-- I can't believe--

36
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,083
Well, hi. I'm Helen.

37
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,792
Of course you are.

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,542
And I'm Martha Baring.
Welcome to Kilronan.

39
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,750
Thank you. Thanks. Oh, boy.

40
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,083
Where is that son of mine?

41
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:16,375
I don't know,
but I'd like to find him.

42
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,042
Yeah, so would Il

43
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:23,125
Well, so much for first impressions.

44
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,208
Go ahead and enjoy his breakfast..,

45
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:29,208
and I'll look forward to seeing
a lot less of you downstairs.

46
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:31,042
Oh, my God.

47
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,667
We can walk a bit.

48
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,333
You show a lot of promise
for a city girl.

49
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,292
Thank you.
You're a terrific liar.

50
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,083
Well.

51
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,250
Mom, the place looks great.

52
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,500
Only because it's covered with snow.
It's been hard this fall.

53
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,458
But I don't want to talk
about anything depressing.

54
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,083
Let's talk about our week.
I made some plans.

55
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,292
- I hope you don't mind.
- We're not staying the week.

56
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,667
- We can't.
- Of course you can.

57
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:12,083
No, we have to leave
right after Christmas. I'm sorry.

58
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,583
- But, darling--
- We have to leave on Wednesday.

59
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:22,875
If you have to go,
you have to go.

60
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:26,417
I Just thought maybe--
Well, never mind.

61
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,417
I Just-- Look at the time.

62
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,958
We have to get back for church.

63
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,958
Go on. Go after her.

64
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:43,250
She misses me.

65
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,875
Go.

66
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,708
I think I made a better impression
with my clothes off.

67
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,792
You look great.

68
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,792
You look beautiful.

69
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,333
Sure.

70
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,750
I love this house, Jackson.

71
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,125
There's something about it.

72
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:12,083
- I suppose.
- Maybe it's you.

73
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,500
How me?

74
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,167
I don't know.

75
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,500
You, where you come from,
who you are.

76
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,458
The architecture of a life.

77
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,917
- Pretentious?
- Just a little.

78
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

79
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,875
Now?

80
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,292
Well, look at you.

81
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,458
You're putting me to shame.

82
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,583
Do you think this is too much
for church? I checked with Jackson--

83
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,542
No, not at all.

84
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,583
I envy your confidence.

85
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,625
Are you sure?
Actually, I did bring another one.

86
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,792
No. I just worry you'll get cold
in that freezing old church.

87
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,917
Here.

88
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,875
- It's broken.
- It's Just-- It's an old catch.

89
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,667
I'll have it fixed.

90
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:32,083
Who are these people?
Are they your parents?

91
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,333
Yes.

92
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,542
Where are they this Christmas?

93
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,542
They died a long time ago.

94
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,542
I am sorry. I didn't know.

95
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,458
Okay, you can stop talking
about me.

96
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,792
Let's go.

97
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,833
Go ahead. Please go on.

98
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,542
I love the scarf.

99
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:07,333
And the angel said to her,
"Hail, blessed one.

100
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,292
The Lord is with thee.

101
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,250
And you will conceive
and bear a Son.

102
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:16,042
And the Lord God will give Him
the throne of His father David...

103
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,667
and He shall reign
in the house forever.

104
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,500
And of His kingdom
there shall be no end."

105
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,333
Amen.

106
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:27,792
Merry Christmas.

107
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,083
Merry Christmas to youl
You're looking well.

108
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,625
- Hello, Father.
- Ah, the prodigal returns.

109
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,000
- Welcome back, Jackson.
- Thank you.

110
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,958
Baring and Son
finally back in business.

111
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,750
You've made your mother
a very happy woman.

112
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,292
Nonsense, Madge. I've been happy
since the day he was born.

113
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,292
Mom, does everyone think
I'm moving in?

114
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,833
Or is Madge
Just your trial balloon?

115
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:58,417
With the fliers I sent out
and the ad in the paper--

116
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,042
I didn't tell her that,
but I guess my hopes were showing.

117
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,625
I know you want me to work the place,
but my work's in New York.

118
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,458
You never speak about that Job
as if you loved it.

119
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,583
Helen's in New York.

120
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,958
That's mighty inconsiderate of you,
young lady.

121
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:17,042
Steal away my baby boy.

122
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,083
Now, why can't you
just be sensible?

123
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,000
Leave your life, your work
and your friends...

124
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,958
and move in here
with a controlling old woman?

125
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:31,042
Learn how to bake bread
and shovel horse shit.

126
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,833
You're not that old.

127
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

128
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,042
Let's not let Madge
spoil our Christmas.

129
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,667
Good night.

130
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, Martha.

131
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,833
Hello!

132
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:46,167
I'm sorry to disturb you there.

133
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,125
I think I'm lost.
I'm looking for Kilronan.

134
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,750
Go back that way.
Follow the tar road.

135
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,333
Second left.

136
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:57,292
Second left, okay.
Thank you.

137
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:01,292
You can tell Mrs. Baring
I'll bring the birds by later on.

138
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,167
Merry Christmas.

139
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,625
- Hi, baby.
- Where've you been?

140
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,750
Please. I got so lost.
I'll tell you about it later.

141
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,792
You cleaned up?

142
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,167
- I'm shocked.
- No.

143
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,292
Must've been my mother.
Old habits die hard.

144
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,375
She does all this with no help?

145
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:31,958
The help never staysl
She doesn't give them anything to do.

146
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:36,000
By the way, I caved in. We're staying
for the New Year's Eve party.

147
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:38,583
Ten, nine, eight...

148
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:41,958
seven, six, five, four...

149
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:44,083
three, two, one.

150
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,167
Happy New Year!

151
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,792
Still love me?

152
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,625
I'll love you, dear.

153
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,667
I'll love you
till China and Africa meet.

154
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,000
And the river
jumps over the mountain.

155
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,083
And the salmon
sing in the streets.

156
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,958
There he was.
He was standing right beside her.

157
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,542
- Did you have a good time?
- It was a great party.

158
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,583
I'd say it was a triumph.

159
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,750
Short-lived maybe, but--

160
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,292
Never mind.

161
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,458
Here's to you, my darlings.

162
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,875
Good night.

163
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,000
Happy New Year.

164
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:13,500
Oh, my God.

165
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,750
You do make a better impression
with your clothes off.

166
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,417
All ready?

167
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,167
I think so.

168
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,917
Well--

169
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,208
Oh, I almost forgot.

170
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,917
- I had it fixed.
- Oh, my God.

171
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,917
You shouldn't have.

172
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,208
It's perfect.

173
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,042
Well.

174
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,375
Just look at us.
I've gone and set you off.

175
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm sorry. I'm just...

176
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,875
not so good with good-byes.

177
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,167
Well, you go on.
Just go on.

178
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,875
Bye, Mom.

179
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:48,792
Bye, baby.

180
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,250
Now, you take care out there.

181
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,000
The last flight.

182
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,708
I know, I know.
I haven't fixed it yet, but I will.

183
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,417
You are so punished.

184
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,500
- No sex.
- Not again.

185
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:54,333
Oh, well.
Be it ever so humble.

186
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,917
Home, sweet home.

187
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:01,375
So how was the vacation?

188
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:04,417
His mom was great.
He was a little bit weird.

189
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:07,208
Please. They're always
different around their mothers.

190
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,792
Excuse me. The way I see it,
it's all about the breasts.

191
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,833
Within one mile of us right now...

192
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,333
100 men are talking to their shrinks
about their mothers...

193
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,500
and thousands of women
are talking to their shrinks...

194
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,000
about their mothers-in-law,
which is responsible...

195
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:21,750
for half the divorces.

196
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,125
Like mine. You think I'm Joking,
but just wait, you'll see.

197
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,875
Now, wait. You marry the guy.
The mother is his problem.

198
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,875
I've heard that one before.

199
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:35,458
We've projected to complete that phase
within 16 months.

200
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,625
This new triple-E glass
is non-reflective...

201
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,208
which will make
the neighbors happy, minimal zing...

202
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,292
the wrong kind of visual impact...

203
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,792
and optimalizing--
if that's a word--

204
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,083
energy conservation
for both heating...

205
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,542
and cooling.

206
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:59,375
They, uh, 60-percent glass--

207
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,833
You're home early.
Are you okay?

208
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:35,125
I don't know.

209
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,875
What do you mean?

210
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:39,833
I'm pregnant.

211
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,917
Now, this is where you're supposed
to go, "Are you sure?"

212
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,875
It seems that
my diaphragm is broken.

213
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,167
Marry me.

214
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,750
I think I lost my Job today too.
I barfed on Gavin.

215
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,833
You said there was no other reason
to get married...

216
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,500
unless you were pregnant.

217
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,250
You're pregnant.

218
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,875
It's settled.

219
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,125
I love you.

220
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,292
Marry me.

221
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,333
Is that a yes?

222
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,875
- Kilronan.
- Are you sifting down?

223
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,542
Wait. Don't tell her I'm pregnant.

224
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:01,625
- What is it? Tell mel
- Helen and I are getting married.

225
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,083
She's pregnant, isn't she?

226
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,583
How'd you guess?

227
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,208
Mothers know these things.

228
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:15,333
Where is she?
is she there?

229
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,042
Hi, Martha.

230
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,958
Congratulations

231
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:21,375
Isn't this the best news ever!

232
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,292
A baby.

233
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,083
And a wedding too, I suppose.

234
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,833
When will it be?

235
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,125
We better hurry, hadn't we?

236
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,292
We could have if here at Kilronan.
What do you think?

237
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,625
We were thinking something more
like City Hall, something like that.

238
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,250
We were?

239
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,458
May the Lord bless these rings
and those who wear them...

240
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,333
as a sign
of your fidelity and love.

241
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,875
What God hath Joined together
let no man put asunder.

242
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,750
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

243
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,875
You may kiss the bride.

244
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,792
You look lovely, Helen.

245
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,875
Good luck, Helen.

246
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,833
- Hi there.
- You look great.

247
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,500
Hi. Congratulations.

248
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,000
Thanks.

249
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,250
How're you holding up?

250
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,625
- I'm dying.
- You're a beautiful bride.

251
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,208
- Who's that?
- Oh, I don't know.

252
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,625
- What?
- She got him back.

253
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,875
- Who?
- Your new mother-in-law.

254
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,958
You never showed for our lunch.

255
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,333
We were supposed to have lunch?

256
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:47,667
Whenever you could visit me
at the home for the near-dead.

257
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,708
But your new mother-in-law said
you had bigger fish to fry.

258
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,167
Alice Baring.
I'm Jackson's grandmother.

259
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,833
Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry. Hello.

260
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,833
She never told me
we were supposed to have lunch.

261
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,625
She wouldn't, would she?

262
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,208
That's why you have to be
so careful of Martha.

263
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,083
I'm used to her folderol.

264
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,958
That's why I invited myself.

265
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,750
I'm the only one left
on his father's side.

266
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,583
Let's see the handcuff.

267
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:19,917
Looks familiar.

268
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:23,083
It belonged to Jackson's mother.
It's a family heirloom.

269
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:26,083
I know. I gave it to her.

270
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:30,000
That was before I knew her better.
When are you due?

271
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,375
How did you know that?

272
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:37,000
Well, you can't be stupid
and breed horses.

273
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:40,292
Takes a lot of know-how
and control.

274
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:43,458
One man to help the stallion,
one to help the mare...

275
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
one to hold the tail...

276
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,458
and one to finesse the situation.

277
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:53,167
Now, Martha, she can manage
all that by herself.

278
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,583
Alice! What a surprise!
I Just didn't think you could make it.

279
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,417
Yes. Wasn't it lucky?

280
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:03,875
Two weeks of chasing every catering
truck in the county, and I hit pay dirt.

281
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,708
Why don't you come with me.

282
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,250
Darling, they want a picture
of the happy couple.

283
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:16,500
- Take your damn hands off me.
- Oh, Alice.

284
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:58,375
Goddamn it, Jackson.

285
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,875
God.

286
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,208
One word,
and I'll slice you wide open.

287
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:36,375
You got that, my pretty lady?

288
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,833
God. Please don't hurt me.

289
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:44,042
My very pretty lady.

290
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,958
Please.

291
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,833
I'm pregnant.

292
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,375
I know where you live.

293
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,083
Don't you forget that.

294
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:34,125
That was a very close call.

295
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,333
That's pretty smart,
telling him you were pregnant.

296
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,417
Most men run when they hear that.

297
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,625
It's a bad joke.
I'm sorry.

298
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,792
Look, you take care
and get some rest, okay?

299
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,667
Good night.

300
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:58,250
I can't get his voice
out of my head.

301
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:33,042
- Oh, my God. I can't go.
- Look.

302
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,792
And I changed the locks.

303
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:54,333
Are you okay?

304
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,792
You sure?

305
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,125
You're going to be all right.

306
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:01,958
Surprise!

307
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,208
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

308
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,458
- How did you get in here?
- I didn't mean to frighten you.

309
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,708
- How did you get in here?
- The super let me in.

310
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,417
Hello, darling.

311
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,208
- Good to see you.
- Oh, my heart!

312
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:25,167
You sure you're all right, darling?
Yes?

313
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,625
He took my locket.

314
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:32,958
With the picture of your parents?

315
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:38,542
Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.

316
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:43,958
Mom?

317
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:46,875
The land alone
is worth more than this.

318
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,875
Jackson, it's a developer.

319
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,542
You know, golf course
and houses.

320
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:56,708
They're going to have to tear out
all the barns, the paddocks...

321
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,125
turn the pastures into fairways.

322
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,833
Kilronan Country Club and Estates.

323
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,750
Can you imagine?

324
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:11,542
Two years ago, we were offered
more than three times this much.

325
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:14,542
Two years ago,
it was a going concern.

326
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,500
The oldest horse farm
in the county.

327
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,750
Where are you going to go?

328
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,208
Well...

329
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,500
I don't know.

330
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:29,125
I've never been anywhere else.

331
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,167
Look.

332
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:41,333
I can't run that place
all by myself anymore.

333
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:43,500
And if you can't help...

334
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:47,917
then you've got to let me sell it.

335
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,542
I'm going to get the coffee.

336
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:01,583
If she really wants to sell it,
why does she need your permission?

337
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,292
Because it's mine...

338
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,042
all of it.

339
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,875
It was left to me, not to Martha.

340
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,750
- Honey?
- Yeah?

341
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,833
How long would it take
to fix up Kilronan?

342
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:25,625
I don't know.

343
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:29,167
The stables need renovating,
the stock's down to nothing.

344
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,708
- Could make a good run in a year.
- Make it attractive to a buyer?

345
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,542
I could run
some projections for it.

346
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,375
Why don't we do it?

347
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,000
Okay, I will.

348
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:41,042
First thing tomorrow morning.

349
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:42,625
No, I mean--

350
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,583
I mean, why don't we do it,
the whole thing?

351
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,542
What do you mean?

352
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:54,042
Honey, I think that this could be
a great opportunity.

353
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,667
You could do the horses.
I could do the house.

354
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,750
Talking a lot of money.

355
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:01,833
- Two mortgages.
- But we could take out a loan.

356
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:05,375
With you down there, they'd fall
all over themselves, giving you money.

357
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,542
What do you think?

358
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,792
I don't know.

359
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,708
I just don't know.

360
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:25,875
You never know. Maybe we'd fall
in love with the place and want to stay.

361
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,917
What about my mom?

362
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,208
What about your mom?
I like her.

363
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,542
What about the baby?

364
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,417
Oh, my God.

365
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,375
What was I thinking?

366
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,250
Deprive my child
of the wholesome environment...

367
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,333
and family values
of a New York City childhood.

368
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:47,500
The dirt, the noise.
Who could want more?

369
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:50,250
Let's talk.

370
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,667
I need to tell you something.

371
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,333
You know my father died.

372
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:03,208
What you don't know
is that it was my fault.

373
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,500
When he fell?

374
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,833
But honey,
you were seven years old.

375
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:16,833
I was hiding under the stairs.

376
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,875
My parents were arguing.

377
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:23,208
They were fighting about this woman
my father was seeing-- Robin Hayes.

378
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:26,792
He was leaving us to be with her.

379
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:28,792
So Mom stormed out the back...

380
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,500
and I thought my father was going
after her, so I charged in there...

381
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:33,833
Like I was going to save her.

382
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,375
I went straight into him.

383
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:44,583
He stumbled back
and lost his balance.

384
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,583
The doors were open
to the basement stairs.

385
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,833
He went down.

386
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:58,333
I started screaming for my mom.

387
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,292
It seemed like forever
before she heard me.

388
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:06,417
She'd been pulling boards off this shed
to make room for my kittens.

389
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:11,750
She came in,
and she had this look on her face.

390
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,833
She was still holding
this nail puller in one hand...

391
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,917
and this tool basket in the other.

392
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,167
She dropped them,
and they made this loud sound.

393
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:30,083
And then she hugged me tight.

394
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:37,917
And she told you
that it was just an accident.

395
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,375
She did.

396
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,875
Oh, baby.

397
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:49,500
You know,
I hated him for the affair...

398
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:52,667
the way he hurt her.

399
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,083
But I still--

400
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:02,542
Love him.

401
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:11,583
You've been living
with all these ghosts for so long.

402
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,458
You should go home.

403
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,833
We should.

404
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:20,375
Face all those ghosts.
Live in the home that you loved.

405
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,083
With your mother and me.

406
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,958
And our daughter.

407
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,083
And our daughter?

408
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:31,542
Is there something
you're not telling me?

409
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,708
I guess my hopes are showing.
Runs in the family.

410
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,458
Congratulations, Mr. Baring.

411
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,208
- Thank you very much.
- Now you've done it.

412
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,625
Congratulations.

413
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,292
She's beautiful.

414
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:29,875
Dear God, thank You
for bringing my family home at last.

415
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,083
What happened to you?

416
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,958
Don't ask.

417
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,958
Here.

418
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,292
Oh, God.

419
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:58,625
Honey, how do you really think
Helen is doing?

420
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,583
What do you mean?

421
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:04,958
I don't know.
She just seems so delicate and fragile.

422
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,958
- I worry about her.
- Why?

423
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:11,583
Every woman is different, but--

424
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,417
Hell, I don't know
how to say this.

425
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,125
But, you know, sometimes
during a pregnancy--

426
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,667
Turn around.

427
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:24,875
Oh, God.

428
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:28,458
I'll just say it.
Sometimes during a pregnancy...

429
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:32,500
making love can be uncomfortable...

430
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,750
physically, emotionally too.

431
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,167
Did she say something to you?

432
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,583
I just think maybe, you know...

433
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:43,958
you could keep your distance a little,
you know?

434
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,833
You mind your own business.

435
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,708
Where are you?

436
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,750
Oh, my God!

437
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,792
Are you all right?

438
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,958
I brought you some tea.

439
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's herbal. Lemon verbena.

440
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,042
Very relaxing.

441
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:39,083
It's almost like a drug.
I'm surprised it's legal.

442
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:40,625
- Here.
- Thank you.

443
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:43,542
You're welcome.
You gave us quite a scare.

444
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,500
Oh, my God.
There were so many of them.

445
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:49,292
It's the poison.
They go up into the rafters to die.

446
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:52,500
It's makes them bleed to death.
It's painless, but--

447
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:54,917
Does leave a lot of bodies around.

448
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:58,958
- God.
- Well, it's over now.

449
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:00,708
You just relax.

450
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:05,792
I feel so strange.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

451
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh, Helen, it's all right.

452
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,833
I know exactly how you feel.

453
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,292
Your muscles ache...

454
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,417
and your skin is so sensitive.

455
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:22,458
And your mind--

456
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:26,083
It Just goes haywire, doesn't it?

457
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,667
Yeah.

458
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:40,958
You are a lovely, lovely young woman.

459
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,958
You just remember that.

460
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,625
No matter what...

461
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,708
Jackson may say or do.

462
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:56,833
You know, men can act strange
during a pregnancy.

463
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,250
Sexually, I mean.

464
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,500
My husband was devoted to me.

465
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,000
But while I was carrying Jackson--

466
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I think we'll be fine.

467
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,000
I just think we need
some time to ourselves.

468
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,000
Of course.

469
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,958
And you will see Dr. Hill tomorrow.

470
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:26,750
Oh, Martha, please.
You know I don't want an amnio.

471
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:35,417
Jackson was not my first pregnancy.

472
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,500
- You had a miscarriage?
- No.

473
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:45,083
We discovered some abnormalities.

474
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,000
It was the right thing to do.

475
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,792
But she would've been...

476
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,792
Just about your age now.

477
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:00,750
But I had to terminate
that pregnancy.

478
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:05,917
What abnormalities?

479
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:10,000
Well, never mind.
You Just go see Dr. Hill.

480
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:11,667
It's important.

481
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:18,542
Good night, darling.

482
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:23,417
Would you send Jackson up, please?

483
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:34,167
- How is she?
- She's fine.

484
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,583
She Just needs a little time alone.

485
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,083
What's going on with her?

486
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,250
Oh, honey.

487
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,417
You just have to be patient.

488
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,708
Come on.

489
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:50,125
I'm going to buy you a drink.

490
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:47,375
It seems like your husband is the only
one getting any sleep here tonight.

491
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:52,042
I tried to wake him,
but he's out cold.

492
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,333
Farm work will do that.

493
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:59,458
It's more than that.

494
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,167
Oh, honey.

495
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,708
Now, you two aren't having
any problems, are you?

496
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,292
I don't know.

497
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:11,083
He's been different
since we've been down here.

498
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:14,083
I don't think
he's ever gotten over his father.

499
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,167
He's not the only one.

500
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:22,417
But then, Jackson and I have
always had each other to lean on...

501
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,125
thank God.

502
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:28,875
I don't have to tell you
what it's like...

503
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,792
to lose someone you love.

504
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,625
Well, I was very young...

505
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,542
but I know.

506
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,542
Here's to accidents.

507
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,042
Fuck them.

508
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,500
Amen.

509
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:49,625
- Turn this way.
- Right here, folks.

510
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:51,542
- Turn this way.
- Right here, folks.

511
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,000
Thank you.

512
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:04,375
- Good luck.
- He'll bring over 500,000 in stud fees.

513
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,167
Are you kidding?

514
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,208
Breeding is everything, my dear.

515
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,875
Speaking of which,
Martha says you've been weak.

516
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:13,000
- How are you doing?
- Martha said what?

517
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:15,833
None of us want you
to lose that baby.

518
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:19,042
There's old Alice.
I didn't think she got out much.

519
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:25,000
Darling, come Join us.
I don't want you to feel left out.

520
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,167
Alice is here.

521
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,167
Really? I don't see anyone.

522
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:33,208
- I'm going to go say hello.
- I forbid it.

523
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,292
Excuse me?

524
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:39,417
It's just, she's a crazy old woman.

525
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:42,542
I don't think she deserves
your attention, that's all.

526
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,917
I don't think I've been forbidden
to do anything since I was five.

527
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:07,625
- What happened? Are you all right?
- Yes.

528
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,708
You gave me such a scare.

529
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,333
Why did you yell?

530
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,625
I have to have you
leave this area.

531
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,958
- God!
- Ma, what the hell happened?

532
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,083
She walked right in front
of the horse.

533
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:21,958
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

534
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,625
Oh, my God. I can't look.

535
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:32,167
- Is it near the baby?
- No. It's at the other end.

536
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,792
Now that I have your attention,
there's one thing I want to mention.

537
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:38,792
What's this I hear about you
wanting to have the baby at home?

538
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,833
What? I never said that.

539
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:47,208
It's a romantic idea,
but too much can go wrong.

540
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,208
Besides, I can't have you young mothers
cutting into my income...

541
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,250
now can l, huh?

542
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:57,167
Dr. Hill, who told you
that I want to have the baby at home?

543
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:03,083
Of course it was her.
This is so invasive.

544
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:06,667
Let me ask you,
is this my baby or is it hers?

545
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:09,375
She's lived here all her life.
She knows him socially.

546
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:11,167
She knows him.

547
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,958
Fine. But why is she telling him
things I didn't say?

548
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:16,042
She's just trying to be helpful.

549
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:19,000
- Don't humor me, please.
- Give her a break.

550
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:21,375
It's for your own good.

551
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:23,500
Isn't it?

552
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,917
Yes. It's for my own good.

553
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,750
She's right, and I'm always wrong.

554
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,458
Thank you.

555
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:36,917
What took you so long?

556
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,042
Go on. Spit it out.

557
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:42,667
You didn't come here
for the food.

558
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:49,250
- Can I ask you a question?
- Please do.

559
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:55,125
At the wedding, you told me
I had to be careful of Martha.

560
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,167
What did you mean by that?

561
00:44:57,208 --> 00:45:00,583
You mustn't pay attention
to anything comes out of my mouth.

562
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:02,917
I'm incompetent.
Didn't she say that?

563
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,583
And incontinent.

564
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:08,875
Sort of unreliable at both ends.

565
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:11,083
Here, girls!

566
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,625
I feed them the whole pharmacy.

567
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,167
Heartburn, ulcers...

568
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,833
blood pressure.

569
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:21,208
They're immune to everything now.

570
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:24,667
The oldest living Confederates
in America.

571
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,417
There you are, girls.

572
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:29,500
Here's the thing.

573
00:45:29,542 --> 00:45:33,083
I don't have anybody here
to talk to.

574
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:36,292
I'm kind of busy right now,
but I can fit you in.

575
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,750
Come. Let's sit over there.

576
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:40,833
All right.

577
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:43,500
Ever since we moved back here...

578
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:49,000
Jackson is becoming more and more--
I don't know-- distant.

579
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:51,375
Distant from you,
closer to her?

580
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:53,625
I think that--

581
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:58,375
You think you're losing him to Martha.
That's what you think. You'd be right.

582
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:01,167
Why don't you say
what you mean, damn it?

583
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,250
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

584
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,292
She was a stable girl.

585
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:09,958
- She was?
- Shoveling horse shit.

586
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:13,167
Not that I hold that
against her, no.

587
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:16,292
I admire her ambition.

588
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,458
She got herself pregnant.

589
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:22,167
She got herself a husband and son...

590
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:25,500
and a fine family name.

591
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:29,333
And now she's breeding herself
a grandson, isn't she?

592
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:39,625
She never loved my son Jack.

593
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,083
All she ever wanted
was that baby.

594
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:45,667
After she had it,
she put my son out to pasture.

595
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,417
and she took Jackson...

596
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:50,583
and poisoned his mind
against his father...

597
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:52,250
and me.

598
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,250
She'll do the same to you.

599
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,167
I think she already has.

600
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,042
She made a beautiful widow,
Martha did.

601
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:06,000
So much more attractive
than a divorced womanl

602
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:08,375
Was Jack going to leave Martha?

603
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:11,750
Nobody leaves Martha.

604
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,500
Believe me when I tell you that.

605
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,292
You bring Jackson to visit me...

606
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:22,792
and I'll tell him the truth
about his father.

607
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:25,833
I'm his bloodl..

608
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:28,750
and I love him.

609
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,375
You tell him that.

610
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,583
Hello, Dr. Hill.
This is Jackson Baring.

611
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:04,375
I know this may sound strange,
but have you seen Helen?

612
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,792
Where have you been?
We've been so worried.

613
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:14,458
Am I not allowed
to leave the property?

614
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,333
She just appeared.

615
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:18,875
Of course.

616
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,958
It's Just that I wish you'd tell us
you were going somewhere...

617
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:24,167
so we'd know where you are.

618
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,667
Good night.

619
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:31,583
Good night, dear.

620
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,625
She's your grandmother.
She wants to see you.

621
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:05,708
Come with me.

622
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:07,500
Just go to sleep.

623
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,250
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

624
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:36,583
Mrs. Baring,
we haven't seen you for a while.

625
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:38,208
Alice will be pleased.

626
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,792
Where is she?

627
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:43,250
She's still having a steam treatment.
You know Alice. Always the last one.

628
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:46,292
Go on in.

629
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:02,000
What a surprise.

630
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:05,417
Why don't you go to my room?
I'll be right with you.

631
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:07,625
Who pays your bills here?

632
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:11,625
Why, you do,
with the money Jack left you.

633
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:14,583
Is it cheap here?

634
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,458
I don't know.

635
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:21,083
Cheap is something
you'd know more about than I would.

636
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:24,500
Is it cheap here?

637
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:27,792
I suppose not.

638
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:30,375
Well, you suppose right.

639
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:34,708
And what is the only thing
I have ever asked of you in return?

640
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:38,208
What is it?

641
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,750
That you stay away from my family.

642
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,792
That's all you have to do.

643
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,708
Now, is that so much
for a mother to ask?

644
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:54,917
What did you tell her?

645
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:59,125
What dirty little lies
did you tell her?

646
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:02,917
Answer me.

647
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:14,000
I have.
You Just can't see my finger.

648
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:30,833
Isn't time a terrible thing?

649
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:35,417
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

650
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,542
And look what happensl

651
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,542
Are you going to behave?

652
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:55,500
There's something
I've wanted to tell you...

653
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:58,750
ever since the first day
you came here.

654
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:03,333
You always smell of horse shit.

655
00:52:12,792 --> 00:52:14,500
Damn you!

656
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:20,917
Now, you stay away from my boy.

657
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,708
You understand?

658
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:32,167
Well, I'll take that as a yes.

659
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,375
Good-bye.

660
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:04,250
Sister, she wants a little more time.
She says it helps her Joints.

661
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:07,250
She's incorrigible.
I'll give her five more minutes.

662
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,083
Make it ten.

663
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:14,417
Come on.

664
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,750
We can't go on like this.

665
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:51,125
Like what?

666
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:54,792
I don't what has been going on
between you and me and your mother.

667
00:53:56,417 --> 00:54:00,750
I'm trying to be respectful of that,
but it's been very difficult. And you--

668
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,708
I Just--

669
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,958
I love you.

670
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:14,000
I really love you, and we need
to be supportive of each other.

671
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,000
I understand
that she's your mother...

672
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:19,250
but soon I'm going to be a mother...

673
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,208
and I need you.

674
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:27,042
I'm not sure I understand.

675
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:29,583
Even at this fee,
with a modest number of bookings...

676
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:33,167
we should get a cash flow increase
sooner than we expected.

677
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:36,958
You mean we're ready to sell?

678
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,625
Mom, look.

679
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:42,625
Helen's not happy here.

680
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:47,917
I want to take her
back to New York.

681
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,583
I'm not blaming you.
I'm not blaming anyone.

682
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:58,917
I love her.
She's my wife.

683
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:00,958
I want her to be happy.

684
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:07,167
Things have been tense
between Helen and me.

685
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,250
But I want you to know
that it's been all my fault.

686
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:17,750
It's hard for two women
to share the same household.

687
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,167
I can see that my ways bother her...

688
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,375
and I'm truly sorry about that.

689
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:30,667
But one thing I do know:

690
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:34,208
What we both want
is that horse to win this weekend.

691
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:38,625
Helen and I will be packing,
and everything will be ready...

692
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:40,333
for my grandson.

693
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:42,542
Grandson, huh?

694
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:44,917
Listen, darling.

695
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,167
Your first responsibility
is to her.

696
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:50,458
She's a wonderful girl,
and I love her.

697
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,833
What?

698
00:55:56,042 --> 00:56:00,375
Are you surprised your old mother
can be a human being?

699
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:02,625
Well, yeah.

700
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:10,000
But the truth?
I'm sorry to leave.

701
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,917
Don't be.

702
00:56:12,917 --> 00:56:16,042
That wife of yours needs to go...

703
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,958
where she belongs.

704
00:56:32,917 --> 00:56:34,500
Dr. Hill.

705
00:56:40,542 --> 00:56:41,958
Franklin.

706
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:47,667
You know, I was just
thinking about you.

707
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:49,667
- Were you?
- Yes, I was.

708
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:53,667
- That's nice.
- I know this is not by the books...

709
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,708
but could I talk to you
for a minute about Helen?

710
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,667
What's the matter with her?

711
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:01,750
This girl is so filled with anxieties,
I don't know what to do.

712
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,875
It probably has something to do with...

713
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:06,875
all those books on pregnancy
she's reading.

714
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:09,542
- That'll do it.
- She has got it in her mind...

715
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:13,042
that first babies are always late,
and I don't know what to tell her.

716
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,583
If she's a week or two late,
it's no problem.

717
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:18,958
Tell her we can induce
right here.

718
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:23,125
Oxytocin brings on contractions
within 24 hours.

719
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:26,292
That's the same thing we use for horses.
Is that possible?

720
00:57:26,417 --> 00:57:28,500
Yes, it is.
Exactly the same.

721
00:57:28,542 --> 00:57:31,083
Tell her whatever it is,
we got the cure.

722
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:34,542
It's not like when you and I
had our babies.

723
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:38,250
Can you believe
I'm going to be a grandmother?

724
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,917
No, I can't.

725
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,875
Tell me, is it a boy
or is it a girl?

726
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,792
You're going to get me
into trouble.

727
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:50,458
I Just want to know what color
for my layette.

728
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:52,833
You know I hate yellow.

729
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:54,792
What color do you like?

730
00:57:54,917 --> 00:57:56,750
Well...

731
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:59,792
blue was lucky for me
25 years ago.

732
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:04,125
Why don't you play your hunch then?

733
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,875
Bye.

734
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,542
Come on, boy.

735
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:22,708
- Come on.
- Come on, big boy. Get in there.

736
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:31,625
Don't worry about me.
I'll just be here packin'.

737
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,917
Sure you want me to go?

738
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,042
Yes, I want you to go,
and I want you to win...

739
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:39,958
and I want you to get your ass back here
as fast as you can.

740
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:48,250
It's more than three hours away,
and you want to get there before dinner.

741
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:55,583
Come on, you lovebirds.
He's already in the van.

742
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:57,583
Bye, baby.

743
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,708
Good luck, okay?

744
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:03,875
Now you take care, both of you.
I'll be back tomorrow night.

745
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:18,292
Won't be long before this place
is everything it ever was.

746
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:20,250
Kilronan rises again.

747
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:24,083
- Kind of a shame, isn't it?
- What is?

748
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,958
That we won't be here to see it.

749
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:15,208
And the same hey to you, darlin'.

750
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:19,625
You're lookin' even lovelier.

751
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:24,417
I brought you something.

752
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,500
Kind of a head start
on baby pictures.

753
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:34,083
Oh, my!
This'll be a big hit around here.

754
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,667
These nuns love a fetus.

755
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,583
I came to say good-bye.

756
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:42,125
"Hello" and "Good-bye"?

757
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:46,250
We're goin' back to New York.

758
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:48,583
Good for you.

759
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:52,875
You're well rid of that woman.

760
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:55,667
Why Jackson ever came back here,
I can't fathom.

761
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:57,917
That was my idea.

762
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,750
I Just-- I thought he had to come back
and face all the ghosts.

763
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:07,458
He still blames himself
for his father's death.

764
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:09,083
No. He shouldn't.

765
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:15,375
His daddy fell on a farm tool that was
lyin' at the foot of the stairs...

766
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:19,625
one of those things they use
to pull nails out of boards.

767
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:22,417
He landed on it just wrong...

768
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:25,042
and it crushed his sternum.

769
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:30,042
It was in all the newspapers.
Doctors commentin' right and left.

770
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:32,375
A bizarre happenin'.

771
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,417
Jackson must accept that.

772
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,500
You better be careful
on your way out the door.

773
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:41,875
When Jack told her he was leavin',
she turned demonic.

774
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:47,958
I can see that.
She strikes me as the jealous type.

775
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,667
Now, what possible reason could
she ever have to be Jealous of Jack?

776
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:59,708
Well, didn't he ever tell you
about Robin Hayes?

777
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:01,750
Jack and Robin?

778
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:06,375
Walk me.
These old farts shock easily.

779
01:02:21,917 --> 01:02:23,333
What?

780
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:32,625
I was Just remembering
when I had Jackson.

781
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:37,500
Oh, I thought that pain
was just gonna rip me in half.

782
01:02:40,792 --> 01:02:42,708
How stupid I am.

783
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,958
Oh, honey, l--

784
01:02:45,042 --> 01:02:47,042
Here.

785
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,125
Let me get you some dessert.

786
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,292
No, thank you.
I'm really tired.

787
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:54,750
- I'm gonna go upstairs.
- But I made it specially for you.

788
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:58,167
Come on. It's strawberries,
your very favorite. Go on. Take it.

789
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,708
Indulge yourself.

790
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,875
Go on.

791
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:04,500
Take it.

792
01:03:04,583 --> 01:03:06,500
You deserve it.

793
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:13,292
I think I'll just take it
up to bed.

794
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:14,792
Yes.

795
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,250
Go on.

796
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:20,083
That baby needs
all the rest he can get.

797
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:23,625
Or she.

798
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:29,042
Good night.

799
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:31,000
Sweet dreams.

800
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:46,583
Tender around that joint.

801
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:52,042
We'll see how it does.
All right.

802
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,417
My God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee.

803
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:05,417
I detest my sins
because I dread the pains of hell..l

804
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:08,708
but most of all
because they offend Thee, my God...

805
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:12,833
who sent me a daughter-in-law
from the land of the Moabites.

806
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:15,958
"And whither thou goest,
I will go," she said.

807
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:18,750
"And your people
shall be my people."

808
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:22,458
And she went down to the threshing floor
and did exactly...

809
01:04:22,542 --> 01:04:25,167
as her mother-in-law instructed.

810
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:28,875
And she conceived a sonl

811
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:35,333
And God said,
"He will be born and renew your life...

812
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:38,708
for he is born
of your daughter-in-lawl..

813
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,042
and is better
than seven sons."

814
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:46,833
You understand, don't you?
This is all for him

815
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,708
And the baby...

816
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:53,917
the precious baby who has no one
to protect him from her.

817
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,375
Hey. You kicking' me again?

818
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:02,792
- Is that nice?
- He is weak, my son.

819
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,833
I am his strength.

820
01:05:07,417 --> 01:05:08,875
You hungry?

821
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:14,958
And God said, "Let the woman
of emptiness become full.

822
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:17,875
And you...

823
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,833
who are most worthy...

824
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:24,375
shall take the child
to your bosom..l

825
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:27,250
and become ifs mother.

826
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:29,792
And the women neighbors...

827
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:32,083
will give him a name...

828
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:34,917
saying, 'A son is born to you--

829
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,042
To you."'

830
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:46,542
I firmly resolve,
with the help of Thy grace...

831
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:49,792
to confess my sins,
do penance and amend my life.

832
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,250
Amen.

833
01:08:37,292 --> 01:08:41,417
You bad girl, you.
You found me out, didn't you?

834
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:46,958
I saw a light.

835
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,333
Well, there's Just
no stopping you, is there?

836
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:56,000
What is all of this?
What are you doing?

837
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:59,458
It was my surprise for you, honey.

838
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,000
Oh, well.

839
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:02,667
Surprise?

840
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:06,750
I wanted to set it all up like this
for you to see...

841
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,333
and then I was gonna ship it all
up to you in New York.

842
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:15,333
But I Just thought...

843
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:17,875
the presentation
would be so vivid.

844
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:23,667
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, honey.

845
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:26,417
Really, it's all right.

846
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,667
Why, look,
we can still show it to Jackson.

847
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,667
Won't that be fun?

848
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:35,917
Yes.

849
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:38,417
Are you all right?

850
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:42,250
I'm Just tired.

851
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:46,542
Well, come on. Let me take you
back up to the house to bed.

852
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:50,583
What are you doing,
walking around with no shoes on?

853
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:03,750
Wait.

854
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:06,042
What is it?
ls it the baby?

855
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:11,375
- Could I have some water?
- We're almost to the house. Come on.

856
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:14,208
No. I need some water.

857
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:19,417
All right.
I'll be right back.

858
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,500
Howdy.

859
01:11:44,292 --> 01:11:47,042
What can I do you for today,
my pretty lady?

860
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:50,292
Pretty lady.

861
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:53,542
I know where you live.

862
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:58,583
Oh, my God.

863
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:01,458
Just tryin' to be friendly, darlin'.

864
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:06,375
Goddamn !

865
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:45,250
What on earth are you doing?

866
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:55,000
Do you think you are some alley cat
dropping your litter by the roadside?

867
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:15,500
Oh, the pain is terrible, isn't it?

868
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:20,458
Darling, I can feel it myself.
I can feel what you're feeling.

869
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:21,917
My God, help me!

870
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:25,750
Oh, I wish I could.

871
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:29,583
Believe me, I wish
I could give you something, but...

872
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,250
I can't.

873
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:37,167
You just have to go through it...

874
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,250
and feel it deeply.

875
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,417
And then you will never...

876
01:14:46,958 --> 01:14:50,042
ever forget
what your child means to you.

877
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:59,958
I'm begging you.

878
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,625
Well--

879
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:24,542
This is a big one, isn't it?

880
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:27,792
- I put a couple C notes on him myself.
- Good.

881
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:32,208
I sent a buyer to Kilronan
the other day, and Martha told him...

882
01:15:32,292 --> 01:15:34,583
you guys had changed your minds.

883
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:36,750
She did?

884
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:43,250
Now breathe. It's almost over.

885
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:45,458
Breathe, darling.

886
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:47,958
It's okay. You're all right.

887
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:51,000
Breathe, Helen !

888
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:56,833
Hello?

889
01:15:56,917 --> 01:16:00,208
- Mother?
- I was hopin' it was youl

890
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:06,250
Well, of course
everything's all right. Yes.

891
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:08,458
Good. Can I talk to her?

892
01:16:08,542 --> 01:16:12,000
- She's here. Talk to her in a minute.
- How's she doing?

893
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:16,250
So how did the morning workout go?

894
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:19,583
Great. He's running the best he's been.
We're ready.

895
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:22,417
- Did you draw your post position?
- Yes.

896
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:26,000
Mom, look, the race is beginning.
Can I please talk to Helen?

897
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:30,042
Oh, no-- I'm losing you.
I'm so sorry, honey.

898
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:33,542
I can't hear you anymore.
Can you hear me?

899
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:40,000
Let me go.

900
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,667
Shit.

901
01:16:46,792 --> 01:16:50,000
You're doin' good. Come on, honey.
Push a little bit harder.

902
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:51,500
Push.

903
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:56,708
I am pushing, you bitch! God!

904
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:59,750
They are at the posfl
Flag is up.

905
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,333
One last time.
Now push down !

906
01:17:07,417 --> 01:17:08,833
Push, Helen!

907
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,458
Come on. You can do it.
Give it to me.

908
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,417
Come on. Push.

909
01:17:15,417 --> 01:17:18,458
Yes. I can see it.
Come on. Push.

910
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:21,000
Oh, my God!

911
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:25,583
Yes, I can see it coming! Push!

912
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,750
Across the wire!

913
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:35,625
Yes! You got him!

914
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:44,583
Push! Don't you quit now.

915
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:49,958
Oh, my God!

916
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:52,458
It's a beautiful little boy.

917
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:58,250
He looks just like Jackson.
Sweet, sweet boy.

918
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:07,042
- What a beautiful boy.
- Give him to me.

919
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:12,417
Mama's gonna get you
all cleaned up. Good.

920
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,750
No! Give me my baby!

921
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,583
I'll love you, dear.

922
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:20,667
I'll love you till China...

923
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,000
and Africa meet..,

924
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:25,333
till the river
Jumps over the mountain...

925
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:28,792
and the salmon
sing in the street.

926
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,708
You are losing so much blood.

927
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,958
Look at the mess you've made
of my linens.

928
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:57,208
I really wanted us to be
a family together. Really, I did.

929
01:18:57,292 --> 01:19:01,708
But I don't know
if that's possible anymore, do you?

930
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:05,625
Oh, it's a pity.

931
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:10,917
But you were so weak
during your pregnancy.

932
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,458
Everybody knew that.

933
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,458
And you would insist...

934
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:19,417
on havin' that baby
right here at home.

935
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:24,000
But I did my best. You know I did.

936
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Of course, you won't remember it
that way, will you?

937
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:35,375
You'll tell them all sorts of things
about me, make up stories.

938
01:19:44,917 --> 01:19:49,667
You know, it's very dangerous
to take more than Just a drop of thisl

939
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:57,500
I want you to know that Jackson and I
will raise the baby the way it deserves.

940
01:19:59,167 --> 01:20:01,042
I'm home!

941
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:03,292
You'd have been proud.

942
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:12,917
Mom?

943
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,125
I'll be right there.

944
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:26,042
I've been callin' and callin'.

945
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:35,333
It's a boy.
You see? I knew.

946
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:41,292
He came so fast, like a freight train,
I had no time to call anybody.

947
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:44,500
But your wife, she was so brave
and so strong.

948
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:46,625
She needs to sleep now.

949
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:49,625
You have no idea
what she's been through today.

950
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:53,042
Don't you want
to hold your son?

951
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:55,208
Is she okay?

952
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:58,250
Helen's doing just great.

953
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:00,250
Come with me.
I need your help.

954
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:03,125
We've got to give
this boy his first bath.

955
01:21:06,292 --> 01:21:07,750
She's fine.

956
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:09,708
She Just needs to sleep.

957
01:21:58,542 --> 01:22:00,042
Hey, Mom.

958
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:06,458
Oh, honey, you can't get
a good night's sleep in this chair.

959
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:10,000
- You go on off to bed. I'll keep watchl
- Thanks, Mom.

960
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:14,292
Not a chance. I want to be here
when she wakes up.

961
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:18,917
I wouldn't miss it for the world, no
matter how many kinks I get in my neck.

962
01:22:19,042 --> 01:22:22,083
Your wife and your baby
are gonna need you at full strength.

963
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,417
You got a tough
few months ahead of you.

964
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:28,833
- Thanks for seeing her through this.
- Well, to bed now, young fella.

965
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:32,083
March. I won't take "no"
for an answer.

966
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,292
Shut up, Mom.
Quit while you're ahead.

967
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:41,667
Good night.

968
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,625
Hi, Mommy.

969
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:18,667
You wanna meet
your little baby boy?

970
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:29,208
This is your mommy.

971
01:23:41,542 --> 01:23:44,042
- How you feelin'?
- Okay.

972
01:23:47,125 --> 01:23:48,917
Where's Martha?

973
01:23:48,917 --> 01:23:50,875
I think she's asleep.

974
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:54,583
She says
you really went through it.

975
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:57,750
Thank God she was here.

976
01:23:58,708 --> 01:24:00,167
Yeah.

977
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:05,542
Honey, will you
do me a favor?

978
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:08,833
Ask her to make us
a little bit of breakfast.

979
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:11,625
You hungry? That's good.

980
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:21,458
If you need anything,
I'll be downstairs.

981
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:39,875
Well...

982
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:42,583
there you are, Daddy.

983
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:46,667
Good morning.

984
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:50,375
Hey. Mornin'.
You been outside?

985
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:52,917
Yeah. I was lookin'
for somethin' in the barn.

986
01:24:54,417 --> 01:24:58,792
You really ought to be in bed, young
lady, after what you've been through.

987
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:01,667
I feel wonderful.
I really do.

988
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:04,625
Ah, God,
I slept so deeply.

989
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:06,875
It's like I was drugged
or something...

990
01:25:06,958 --> 01:25:10,875
Iike 20 years passed,
and I Just don't remember a thing.

991
01:25:10,917 --> 01:25:13,792
Oh, it has.
We just forgot to tell you.

992
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,292
Oh, great.

993
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:21,000
- What's in the bag?
- Just this thing I found in the barn.

994
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:26,708
Those eggs smell good.

995
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:32,500
- What?
- "What" yourself?

996
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:36,333
- What's the mystery?
- Oh, humor me, huh?

997
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:40,208
This is such a happy day.
I don't want to bring everybody down.

998
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:43,875
Come on, baby.
Don't keep us all in suspense.

999
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:45,875
What's in the bag?

1000
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:49,750
It's one of those things
that killed Jackson's daddy.

1001
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:53,167
I've never seen one before.

1002
01:25:53,208 --> 01:25:55,125
What are you talkin' about?

1003
01:25:55,208 --> 01:25:59,542
I realized this morning,
now that Jackson has a son of his own...

1004
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:03,458
he's gotta let go of all those
old ghosts so he can be free.

1005
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:07,583
And I Just got obsessed with finding
one of these things and burying it...

1006
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:12,625
so deep in the ground that it can't
ever harm anyone in our family again.

1007
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:15,917
I know that sounds hormonal, but--

1008
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,708
There's no thing that killed my father.
He fell down the stairs.

1009
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,917
Oh, but it wasn't the fall
that killed him.

1010
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,208
Your mama went downstairs after
you called her, just like you said...

1011
01:26:27,292 --> 01:26:31,917
and she found that he had fallen
on this thing in this freak way.

1012
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,167
It was even in the newspapers.

1013
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:37,083
He fell on somethin'
at the bottom of the stairs?

1014
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:42,667
Oh, honey, I think Helen is right.

1015
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:45,333
This is not the day
we should talk about this.

1016
01:26:45,417 --> 01:26:48,875
Yes, he fell. He fell on this.

1017
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:57,167
It's probably not the same one.
There must be lots of these around here.

1018
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:59,667
What are you doing?

1019
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:04,917
Whatever do you mean?
That's how Jack died.

1020
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,708
He fell with tragic, almost
inconceivable precision...

1021
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:12,917
on this thing
that crushed his sternum...

1022
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,833
just as surely as if someone
had smashed it into his body.

1023
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:20,500
You were tearin' boards
off that shed.

1024
01:27:21,292 --> 01:27:23,208
How could you remember that?

1025
01:27:23,292 --> 01:27:26,125
You were seven years old.
You were scared to death.

1026
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:30,042
What I remember is that you were
holding that thing when you hugged me.

1027
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:33,208
When you dropped it,
it made this loud clanging sound.

1028
01:27:33,292 --> 01:27:34,958
Like this?

1029
01:27:38,417 --> 01:27:40,625
Why are you doing this?

1030
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:46,167
Trying to tear my family apart
just because you lost your own parents.

1031
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:48,417
- She wasn't--
- She's not foolin' anybody...

1032
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:50,792
with that wide-eyed, innocent--

1033
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:52,792
Do you know
what she's implying?

1034
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:55,917
Even if I did have
one of those things in my hands...

1035
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:59,125
that doesn't mean there wasn't another
at the bottom of the stairs.

1036
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,292
You remember that day.

1037
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:05,292
You remember the fall.

1038
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:07,792
That fall could've killed
anybody who--

1039
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:15,958
Why, no one's implying
that you killed Jack. My God!

1040
01:28:16,042 --> 01:28:19,292
Lots of wives have affairs
and don't kill their husbands...

1041
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:21,792
because he finds out
and is gonna leave her.

1042
01:28:21,917 --> 01:28:24,167
My father was
having the affair.

1043
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:28,250
Oh, no. You got that backwards.
Robin Hayes was a horse wrangler.

1044
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:32,083
Martha was having
an affair with him.

1045
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:35,958
Alice told you that,
didn't she?

1046
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,375
That's Just the kind of twisted lie
Alice would invent...

1047
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:42,667
and your wife would try to perpetuate
to turn you against me.

1048
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:46,417
- Don't you see what she's doing?
- 412-263-1841.

1049
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,708
I just talked to Robin Hayes.
He's expecting the call.

1050
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:53,208
Would you like to speak to him
for old time's sake?

1051
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:58,208
Robin Hayes died last year
of a heart attack.

1052
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,250
There's one you didn't cause.

1053
01:29:01,542 --> 01:29:05,958
You Just couldn't bear
to let a happy family be, could you?

1054
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:12,167
We were so close to being happy.

1055
01:29:14,417 --> 01:29:17,875
Here's how close we were.

1056
01:29:20,542 --> 01:29:23,083
Your mother tried to kill me
last night.

1057
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:26,375
- That's a lie.
- Nobody leaves Martha.

1058
01:29:26,458 --> 01:29:30,083
Don't you see? Your father was leaving.
That's why she killed him.

1059
01:29:30,167 --> 01:29:34,542
And what's worse, she made you,
her own child, think that he did it...

1060
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:38,917
so that she could bind you to her
for the rest of your life!

1061
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:43,667
I want you to throw this lying bitch
out of my house!

1062
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:47,000
There's only room
for one of those.

1063
01:29:47,083 --> 01:29:50,875
- You'll never prove anything.
- She doesn't have to.

1064
01:29:54,167 --> 01:29:57,500
- Oh, but Jackson, you can't--
- Shut up!

1065
01:29:59,917 --> 01:30:02,708
Everything about you is a lie.

1066
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:07,375
This place and everything in it
will be sold.

1067
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:12,000
You will never see me
or any member of my family again.

1068
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:16,833
But I did it all for you.

1069
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:20,000
You are not my mother.

1070
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:30,875
You did this.

1071
01:30:30,917 --> 01:30:35,042
You tricked him! You trapped him!
You got yourself pregnant!

1072
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:37,792
I know what you're after.

1073
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:40,958
You want my farm, my land...

1074
01:30:41,042 --> 01:30:42,458
my boy!

1075
01:30:45,042 --> 01:30:48,750
You want to take everything I have
and leave me with nothing!

1076
01:30:48,792 --> 01:30:51,042
Don't you see what she's doing?

1077
01:30:53,458 --> 01:30:55,375
She wants to be me.

1078
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:09,958
So long, Martha.

1079
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:54,833
Grandma.
