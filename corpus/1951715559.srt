What about the marijuana roaches

out of your apartment ?

So I smoked some pot.
What is that, a crime ?

00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:17,940
How does that make me an accessory ?
I laid some sod on Dickie's golf course.
So ?

been happening right under her nose--

payoffs of government agencies, threats
towards those who stood in the way,

You paint the picture

1632
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:55,060
With colors squeezed
from your hand

1633
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:59,260
Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go

1634
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:02,600

1635
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:33,750
Okay, everybody.
The water temperature is 63 degrees.

1636
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:37,260
Pop's thumb should be all right

1637
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:39,760

- Do the math, motherfucker.

1638
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:42,030
- Damn.
- Geez.

1639
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:54,340
- Hey, I think I found it.
- What ?

1640
01:56:00,190 --> 01:56:03,280
- False alarm.
- Oh, damn, Whitey.
