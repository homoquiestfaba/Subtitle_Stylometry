00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:07,998
Oui?

3
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:11,037
Qui?

4
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,438
Non.

5
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:16,358
Dites...

6
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,998
Dites a ce monsieur
que c'est trop tard.

7
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:26,437
Too bloody late.

8
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:27,917
Thank you...

9
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:31,477
- The Dover train booked through to Paris.
- Right you are, sir.

10
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:33,718
I wish you every happiness,
Chrissie.

11
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,557
Marrying in Paris
is a backdoor way out of it.

12
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:40,917
What do they say at the office?

13
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:44,717
Sylvia's mother was married in Paris,
I let it be known.

14
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:47,157
Thank you for that, Vinnie.

15
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:49,078
But she's bitched me, old man.

16
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:52,157
I don't even know if
the child is mine.

17
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,318
Tea tray at 6:30.

18
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,159
Yes, madam. Goodnight, madam.

19
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:07,357
Sylvia!

20
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:09,958
Sylvia!

21
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:12,877
- Mr Drake!
- Sylvia!

22
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,357
- God damn you, I won't be...
- Quite so.

23
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:19,118
Thank you, Evie.

24
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:25,397
Won't your wife
be wondering where you are?

25
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:27,717
I won't be sent away
like an errand boy!

26
00:02:27,718 --> 00:02:31,558
This is not fair.
And you're drunk.

27
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:36,117
Sylvia, don't do this!

28
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:38,455
What? Save myself from ruin?

29
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,486
I'm pregnant, you fool!

30
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,023
Whatever you want,
it can't be that... that ox!

31
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:46,600
What I want is to die.

32
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:49,078
Death is what I...

33
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:55,477
No, Gerald, don't.
Darling, don't. It's not fair...

34
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:56,918
Don't...

35
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:29,078
I cut away early
from a ghastly weekend party.

36
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,798
- Are you going up to town?
- Yes.

37
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:42,597
My name is Tietjens.

38
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,878
I'm Sylvia... Satterthwaite.

39
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:47,597
I know.

40
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:11,037
We will take a small house
in Knightsbridge. Lowndes Street.

41
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:14,317
Her mother will live with us.

42
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,438
- Mrs Satterthwaite has contributed handsomely.
- I see.

43
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:23,874
I haven't seen
that pretty box before.

44
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:26,957
Gerald Drake gave it to me.

45
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,157
Have you no shame?!
On your wedding day!

46
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,832
When did he give it to you?

47
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:35,101
- Last night.
- Oh!

48
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:37,157
You're a lying devil
to say such a thing!

49
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:40,037
Didn't I see her with it
on the Channel ferry!

50
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:44,358
So you're going to give me away
twice in one morning?!

51
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:49,558
- Did Father send word?
- He sent me.

52
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,644
- And my mother?
- Your mother's soft,

53
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,477
and brought you up soft.
Not your fault.

54
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,317
Second wife, late child, no Yorkshire woman -
a bad combination.

55
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:00,677
My mother is Yorkshire.

56
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:03,397
Oh, South Riding, by a whisker.

57
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:05,077
Will you give me a cigarette?

58
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:07,877
No, I will not give you a cigarette,
and I'm glad your father's dead

59
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:11,277
not to know today's work,
and I'm sorry for your mother.

60
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:15,157
Well, don't be.
Christopher Tietjens is a Godsend.

61
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:18,038
God-sent is one thing
that he is not!

62
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,318
So, you get yourself trapped by
a papist bitch carrying a baby.

63
00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:26,917
Yes! I won't marry now.

64
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,357
You're next, after me, and after you,
it's that whore's child,

65
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:33,438
who will be the 14th
Tietjens of Groby.

66
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:43,477
One heard things about you.
That you were a wrong 'un.

67
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:46,677
But better a wrong 'un than a mug.

68
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:50,078
Yes, I suppose I was a mug.

69
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:59,038
And yet, there's something
glorious about her.

70
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,718
Let Marchant go.

71
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:28,717
What's the matter, old fellow?

72
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:31,597
We had a nasty dream, didn't we?

73
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,317
- Now, lie down.
- No, no.

74
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:36,357
I know what to do.

75
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:40,998
A glass of warm milk, Marchie.
It's the best thing for bad dreams.

76
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:52,558
Now, a little conversation
till we're sleepy, that's what I do.

77
00:06:56,078 --> 00:06:59,238
I had bad dreams sometimes
when I was little.

78
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:04,558
You see that?

79
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:11,318
I could nearly touch Groby Tree
from the night nursery window.

80
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:17,797
There's all sorts of things
hanging on the tree.

81
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:20,078
They bring good luck.

82
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,998
There's a wishing well
in the stable yard.

83
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:36,057
They say it's twice as deep as
Groby Tree is high,

84
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,450
and you can drop a penny in it
and make a wish.

85
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:45,598
Should I tell you how long it falls?

86
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:50,358
I used to count, as long as this...

87
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:55,837
One,

88
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:59,677
two,

89
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:01,518
three,

90
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,198
four,

91
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:12,318
five,

92
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,598
six,

93
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:22,678
seven, eight,

94
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,918
nine,

95
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,918
ten.

96
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:46,517
Soft.

97
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:47,918
Oh, Mr Christopher!

98
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:56,717
- Telegram, sir.
- Thank you, Bridget.

99
00:08:56,718 --> 00:09:01,438
- While you're there, please, Bridget, teapot.
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,837
"Maisie Mulgrew wishes it
to be known that she is enjoying

101
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:20,237
"sexual connection with
Captain WM O'Donnell."

102
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:22,958
- What?
- No! China!

103
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,477
You! Pulling the strings of
the shower bath.

104
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:31,037
"The honourable Mrs Frederick Mulgrew,
whose husband, we hear,

105
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,037
"is spoken of for
the Vienna Embassy,

106
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:36,477
"enjoys the polo with
Captain WM O'Donnell."

107
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:40,397
That's Maisie getting even with Frederick Mulgrew
for his fling with Lady Egret.

108
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:42,478
You have no reason to say so.

109
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,838
Thank you, Bridget - Darjeeling.

110
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:51,477
And Mr Tietjens
needs more coffee, I expect.

111
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:54,677
Oh, I don't think Maisie's got
the gumption to go through with it.

112
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,817
But the readers like a whiff of sex
coming off our crowd,

113
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,788
like a vapour,

114
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,238
like the steam on the water
at the crocodile house at the zoo.

115
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:17,405
I'm bored!

116
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:20,502
Only you could be bored
with the end of the world upon us.

117
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:22,957
- Who says?
- I says.

118
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,157
The Prime Minister
has asked the King to create

119
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:32,437
400 Liberal peers so the working
classes can have free medicines.

120
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:37,517
Oh, but I see
the Association of Domestic Servants

121
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:40,557
is against the Insurance Bill.
Why would that be, I wonder?

122
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:42,637
Now is your chance to ask.
Thank you.

123
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:44,598
- Go on, then.
- Well, Bridget?

124
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:48,603
I'm sure I don't know, sir.

125
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:52,877
Well, I'm sure I do. It is because
the National Insurance Bill violates

126
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:57,238
that beautiful intimacy that exists
between a servant and their mistress.

127
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:02,917
The Association of Domestic Servants
is Tory through and through!

128
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:05,437
It is the duty of employers
to look after

129
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:08,963
the welfare of their employees,
and those who don't should go to prison.

130
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:11,864
- Who thinks that?
- I am the last, except for a few dukes,

131
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:13,357
like your cousin, Westershire.

132
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:15,837
- Do you wonder I can't bear him?
- No.

133
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:19,837
You married above your intellect and
don't take kindly to disadvantage.

134
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:22,840
However, the new Liberal peers
won't be necessary.

135
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:26,638
The Upper House will cave in
and vote to make itself irrelevant.

136
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:31,317
- And is that the end of the world?
- No.

137
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:34,518
- The world ended long ago, in the 18th Century.
- Ha-ha!

138
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:42,757
Do you know what he's doing?!

139
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:46,838
He's making corrections in
the Encyclopedia Britannica!

140
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:51,118
If I'd killed him,
no jury would convict!

141
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:07,558
Look, it's him with
the purple Rolls.

142
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:23,757
You've been giving the mare
less liquorice in her mash.

143
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:27,837
- I told you she'd go better.
- Trust you to remember, sir! Thank you.

144
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:29,518
Morning!

145
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:36,032
- Good morning!
- Good morning, sir.

146
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,277
Tietjens!
Did you receive my telegram?

147
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,237
And a very good morning to you, too, Macmaster.
So you looked over my figures.

148
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:43,837
Yes, and the Chief will
have my head if I give them to him.

149
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:45,837
Well, don't, then.
You asked for my help.

150
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:50,517
- Yes, and you've weighted the calculations as though...
- As though people became ill

151
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,797
according to what they have
to pay for medical treatment!

152
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:57,757
They do, it will ruin the Exchequer,
and I intend Sir Reginald to know it.

153
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:02,877
Suppose you could bolt with a new man
every week and no questions asked.

154
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:07,077
- Ripping! Can I have this?
- No.

155
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,877
But the question is,
how long would it stay ripping

156
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:14,515
before you're simply yawning
to get back to your husband?

157
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,356
- How long?
- It's not a riddle, Sylvia.

158
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,869
- I'm asking.
- Mmm.

159
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,797
Well...
It would have to be weekends only.

160
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:29,757
One would still need a home,
a husband for show midweek,

161
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:33,637
and a place to store one's maid.
I couldn't do without Hullo Central.

162
00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:41,197
Mrs Tietjens is not at home.

163
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:42,437
Oh, but she...

164
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:47,117
- Sylvia, you are such a rotter.
- Well, I'm not dressed for a picnic.

165
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:51,037
Anyway, I've realised there's no point in a fling
if one's husband doesn't notice.

166
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:56,317
- I'd go!
- It's no use, Potty loves me!

167
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:59,438
He wants me to leave Christopher
and go abroad with him.

168
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:03,597
Oh, I'd like to shake him!

169
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:08,757
- Who?
- My husband, of course.

170
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,398
Shake some reaction
out of that great lump!

171
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,877
Do you happen to have a cigarette?

172
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,158
Yes, of course.

173
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:24,518
Thank you.

174
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:42,957
Now look here,
don't be obtuse, Tietjens.

175
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,117
Dammit, man, is the department's duty
to support Waterhouse

176
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,397
and make his case to the house.
Do you understand?

177
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:51,061
Minister has to show the figures
for the insurance bill will balance.

178
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:54,847
Well, they won't. And I should have thought
it was this department's duty to tell him so.

179
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:58,717
Tietjens, you're the cleverest young
man in London, Macmaster says,

180
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:01,277
and I'm inclined to believe him.

181
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,557
But he and I,
with our blunt instruments,

182
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:07,717
have managed to grasp
something that you cannot.

183
00:15:07,718 --> 00:15:10,197
- Why thank you, Sir Reginald.
- Which is...

184
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:13,117
that if they don't get what they
require from you, they'll put some

185
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:16,998
competition-wallah head clerk on it
and take our credit from us.

186
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:22,997
I simply wish you to be
aware of the fact...

187
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:26,957
there's no difficulty in adjusting
the calculations to produce

188
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,957
a more congenial result.

189
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,282
I can let Macmaster have it
in the hour and 10 minutes remaining

190
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,718
but I insist on his taking
credit for it.

191
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:38,478
Good man.

192
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:41,477
Votes for women!

193
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:43,237
It's him, it's Waterhouse!

194
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,197
What the devil is going on here?

195
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:53,917
- Keep moving, sir.
- Excuse me.

196
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:55,957
This way, please.

197
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,397
We came through without a scratch.
Thanks, Bertram.

198
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:01,718
My fault for inviting a liberal.
Christmas spirit, you know?

199
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,758
Will you be going on to Diana's?

200
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,478
- Merry Christmas, Victoria.
- Merry Christmas...

201
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:19,758
- Christopher! There you are at last.
- Yeah, sorry.

202
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,660
- You look lovely.
- You look like thunder.

203
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:32,598
You didn't mind that
I let Potty bring me ahead.

204
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,237
No, of course not.

205
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:39,197
- Will you dance?
- I would if that were dancing.

206
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,918
Will you save me one
when there's a tune?

207
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:01,997
- You're a writer?
- Ah, yes, a little of the critic.

208
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:04,718
- My book on Rosetti will be appearing...
- Macmaster.

209
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:09,197
- How rude!
- That fellow over there with Sandbach.

210
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:12,437
He's the Right Honourable
Stephen Waterhouse.

211
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:15,917
He's the swine that made us
fake that schedule at the office.

212
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:18,877
- I'm going to have a word with him.
- For God's sake, Chrissie!

213
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:22,397
Those suffragettes, I would have
whipped till they bled.

214
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,877
Spank them, that's what I say.

215
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,837
What have we come to

216
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,997
when a government minister can't go
anywhere without a policeman?

217
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:32,237
Perhaps if the Prime Minister
had kept his promise to address

218
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:34,757
the women's concerns after
the summer recess...

219
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:39,157
- Christian, my dear fellow...
- The women would keep their promise to stop protesting,

220
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,437
- while the police had their hands full with the coronation.
- Give the PM a chit.

221
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:46,317
Quite right. Tietjens, hark to my
brother-in-law, the general.

222
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:50,717
Tietjens. Oh, you must be the genius.
Allow me to thank you.

223
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:54,117
We couldn't have got the insurance
bill before the house

224
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:56,957
till the next session
without your figures.

225
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,997
You're taking the credit
from Macmaster.

226
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:02,187
Oh, no, we know who to thank.
Sir Reginald let it out.

227
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,757
Macmaster?
He the fellow you brought with you?

228
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,678
Who are his people?

229
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:13,838
His father was a shipping
clerk in Edinburgh.

230
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,678
Well!

231
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:23,638
- Was he angry with me?
- Angry with his wife, I expect. We got the brunt.

232
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:29,317
- No! No, Potty.
- Yes.

233
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,397
Don't call me Potty.

234
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:33,558
But it suits you.

235
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:39,717
Will you come away with me?

236
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,558
Well, I might... one day.

237
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:17,037
Sylvia has gone off
with that fellow...

238
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,038
Perowne.

239
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:23,677
I'm letting Lowndes Street,
and warehousing the furniture.

240
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:25,517
I'm taking Michael
to my sister, Effie,

241
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:27,997
she's married to a vicar who has
one of our livings.

242
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:29,918
Marchant will go with him.

243
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,038
- So you'll be wanting your old rooms?
- Mm-hm.

244
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,197
One...

245
00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:24,157
two...

246
00:20:24,158 --> 00:20:25,696
Three...

247
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,678
Your aunt Effie.

248
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,838
Five... six...

249
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,401
Walk on.

250
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,040
Trott on.

251
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:05,968
Poor child, living like
an orphan with his aunt Effie.

252
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:11,918
Bear up, old girl. You'll
be near at hand now for Michael.

253
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:15,238
Your wife has shamed you both.

254
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:17,838
All of us.

255
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:29,499
You'll divorce?

256
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:32,878
No, only a blagger
would submit his wife to that.

257
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:37,317
Mrs Satterthwaite established
herself at a German spa,

258
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:41,078
so that it may be said that Sylvia
has gone abroad to nurse her.

259
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:44,598
The mother's a bitch
but a sensible one.

260
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:52,318
The motor-plough didn't serve.

261
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:56,989
It's all coming.

262
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:25,997
He's someone called Thurston,
I met him somewhere. He won't gossip.

263
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:28,437
I don't care if he does.

264
00:22:28,438 --> 00:22:33,797
- Well, thank you very much.
- What does it matter? Now or later.

265
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:35,918
We're not going to hide for ever.

266
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,278
- Well, that's the thing, Potty.
- What thing?

267
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:46,878
It's not for ever.

268
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:49,933
Yes, it is.

269
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:53,038
- I hope you're not going to behave badly.
- About what?

270
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,566
About my going back,
before it's too late.

271
00:22:57,589 --> 00:23:02,075
Oh, no, you're not.
What are you talking about?

272
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:05,117
- I miss my husband.
- No, you don't!

273
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:09,674
- You call him... a great lump of wood.
- Oh, he is.

274
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:13,396
I often want to kill him just to see
if there's any blood in him.

275
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,997
I'm permanently angry with him.

276
00:23:15,998 --> 00:23:19,277
But he's spoiled me for any other
decently groomed man in London.

277
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,797
He knows everything about everything.

278
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:24,157
That's the difference between being
with a grown man

279
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:26,238
and trying to entertain a schoolboy.

280
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:29,678
But you love me.

281
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:32,718
Don't you?

282
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:35,837
Er... I overlooked you.

283
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:40,917
Your dullness, and not knowing French
and drinking too much or too little

284
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:45,397
and oh, I don't know, everything really,
from being all over me

285
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:49,077
the moment we were on the train
to sulking if I'm not all over you.

286
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,717
Especially that side of things.

287
00:23:51,718 --> 00:23:55,958
Which became like reading a book
you've read before.

288
00:23:57,358 --> 00:24:03,918
Why can't one get a man to go away
with one and be just... light comedy?

289
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:08,398
I say, you're not going to kill yourself,
I hope, Potty.

290
00:24:12,358 --> 00:24:15,438
I want you to swear on your
St Anthony that you won't leave me.

291
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:19,558
- I'll do no such thing.
- Then I'll kill you if you try.

292
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:23,437
The French understand these things.

293
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:28,598
These hotels one has been staying in,
the notepaper is simply shaming.

294
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:40,797
A weekend on the golf links
might do me some good,

295
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,358
hobnobbing with our masters.

296
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:48,597
I will change into my golfing togs
when we get to our digs.

297
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:50,397
One never knows who might
be on the train.

298
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:54,838
Mr Sandbach MP,
going down to his constituency...

299
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:01,078
Ah!

300
00:25:04,158 --> 00:25:05,998
The proofs of my monograph.

301
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,598
Sylvia asks me to take her back.

302
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:26,398
She's joined her mother in Germany.

303
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:33,038
- Will you take her back?
- I imagine so.

304
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:38,317
There's the child to consider.

305
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:40,517
Marchant says he's...

306
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:43,078
beginning to talk like a farmer's
boy already.

307
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,797
Well, I shan't have a house again.

308
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:52,438
There's a certain discredit attaches
to itself to a cuckold, quite properly.

309
00:25:53,598 --> 00:25:56,877
Anything beyond a flat looks like
impudence in a man

310
00:25:56,878 --> 00:25:58,998
who can't keep his wife.

311
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:08,317
I wish you'd divorce her.
Drag her through the mud.

312
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,958
For a gentleman,
there's such a thing as...

313
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,438
- Call it parade.
- And if you met someone you want to marry?

314
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,321
It would change nothing.
I stand for monogamy.

315
00:26:22,345 --> 00:26:25,038
- You...
- Aye, monogamy and chastity.

316
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,078
And for not talking about it.

317
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:43,478
"Better far tho hearts may break
Bid farewell for aye!

318
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:50,278
"Lest thy sad eyes meeting mine
Tempt my soul away."

319
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:54,318
That's great poetry.

320
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:59,237
That's your obese poet painter
talking about it in language

321
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:01,478
like congealed bacon fat.

322
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:07,117
- You have a way of putting things.
- No, I haven't.

323
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:09,958
If I had, it would make it better for me.
Here.

324
00:27:11,438 --> 00:27:16,237
"Accept resumption yoke on condition
child stay with sister Effie and Anglican.

325
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:17,838
"Wire if acceptable."

326
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:23,438
I for one am sorry.

327
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:29,958
- She must have a way of putting things.
- She has.

328
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:36,957
"I am now ready to return to you,
if I can keep Hullo Central,

329
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:40,877
"there being no-one else
I can bear to have near me,

330
00:27:40,878 --> 00:27:43,358
"when I have retired for the night."
That's all.

331
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:50,757
She should be the consort of the...
I don't know,

332
00:27:50,758 --> 00:27:53,718
of the Viceroy of India.

333
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:04,997
We'll get in a round of golf today.

334
00:28:04,998 --> 00:28:08,997
Tomorrow a breakfasting with the
rector who'd helped me with my book.

335
00:28:08,998 --> 00:28:10,997
But of course he did.

336
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:14,717
You mean the Reverend Duchemin who hosted
those famous breakfasts at Cambridge?

337
00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:18,317
He's no longer at Cambridge.
He has a rectory near Rye.

338
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:19,518
Oh.

339
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:29,358
Lady Claudine says come and pick a
bone at Mountby. You too, Macmaster.

340
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:34,317
Thank you, I won't.
Macmaster would be delighted.

341
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:36,357
You're the great Macmaster?

342
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:38,477
That's very good of you to say,
Mr Sandbach.

343
00:28:38,478 --> 00:28:43,036
- The caddie heard tell.
- Plus one at North Berwick.

344
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:48,318
Oh, good God.
Is that Waterhouse up ahead?

345
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:04,678
Mm.

346
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,918
Hm!

347
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:15,718
Get Chrissie back to Sylvia
as quick as you can.

348
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:22,157
Believe me, Sylvia is a splendid girl.
Straight as a die.

349
00:29:22,158 --> 00:29:24,118
Takes her fences clean.

350
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:28,814
Chrissie must have been
running after the skirts.

351
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:30,341
- No?
- No.

352
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:32,717
- I dare say a little... No?
- No!

353
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:35,117
It will be resented.

354
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:39,158
Half the houses in London would be
closed to him, so do what you can.

355
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:52,957
Hooked it.

356
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,437
I loathe this game.

357
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:58,117
Why do you play, then?

358
00:29:58,118 --> 00:29:59,798
Macmaster has no-one else.

359
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,318
Votes for women!

360
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,757
- Oi! Come here, you!
- Votes for women!

361
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:32,878
Is it our blood you want
before you give in?

362
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:38,357
Stop! Stop! Stop where you are!

363
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:41,518
Votes for women! Votes for women!
Run, Gertie!

364
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:51,598
By jove! Miss Wannop!

365
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,878
Suffragettes.

366
00:30:58,318 --> 00:30:59,558
Get off!

367
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,677
You're under arrest!

368
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:04,718
Valentine!

369
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:12,558
I say, sorry to spoil your shot.

370
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:17,437
Go and see that they don't hurt Gertie.
I've lost her.

371
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:21,677
You've been demonstrating.

372
00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:24,957
Well, of course, we have, but you
won't see a girl be manhandled.

373
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:29,037
There looked to be some beasts
among them - a regular rat-hunt -

374
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:30,157
and Gertie can't run.

375
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:33,718
You cut away, then.
I'll look after Gertie.

376
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:39,077
- No, I'll come with you.
- Clear out, unless you want to go to gaol.

377
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:40,717
- Tally-ho!
- Help!

378
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:41,718
Run!

379
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:47,397
Strip the bitch naked!
Strip the bitch!

380
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:50,078
- Stark naked!
- Stop!

381
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:54,478
Stop! Stop! Stop!

382
00:31:58,038 --> 00:31:59,998
You couldn't have done more,
Officer.

383
00:32:01,998 --> 00:32:03,518
I expect you're a bit shaken.

384
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:06,597
Anybody would be.

385
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:08,198
Thank you, sir.

386
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:13,158
Run, Gertie!

387
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,718
We've got them! We've got them!

388
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,678
You'll have to go round
by Camber railway bridge!

389
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:45,878
Idiot!

390
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,717
I refuse to play with you.

391
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:52,997
In fact, I've a good mind to issue a warrant
for your arrest, for obstructing justice.

392
00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:55,998
You can't. You're not a borough magistrate.
Look it up.

393
00:32:59,318 --> 00:33:01,957
Chrissie, you are the bloody limit!

394
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:05,398
The bobby didn't want to arrest the girls.
He was yearning not to.

395
00:33:06,438 --> 00:33:13,077
Was that girl your... a friend of yours?
Had you arranged it with her?

396
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:16,957
If it was the Wannop girl -
if the woman that's come between you

397
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,517
and Sylvia, dammit,
is our little suffragette...

398
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:22,157
- Good God!
- Put her back, Chrissie.

399
00:33:22,158 --> 00:33:23,358
I give you my word.

400
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:27,398
They say they're all whores.

401
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,637
I beg your pardon,
if you like the Wannop girl.

402
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,077
Her father was a great friend
of your father's.

403
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:42,718
Of course, I remember...
Professor Wannop, the classicist.

404
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,157
He didn't leave a farthing
and there's a son at Eton.

405
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:51,357
The widow and daughter
have a deuced hard row to hoe.

406
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:55,518
I know Claudine takes them all the peaches
she can cadge out of Paul's gardener.

407
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:00,037
Perhaps you feel sorry for her,
is that it?

408
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,837
I think that's enough confusion
to be going on with.

409
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:06,437
But you should know Mrs Satterthwaite
is much recovered at her German spa

410
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:10,129
and I'm expecting to go over in a day or two
to bring Sylvia and her mother home.

411
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:11,902
Good boy!

412
00:34:13,598 --> 00:34:20,518
Kiss her fingertips for me.
She's the real thing, you lucky beggar.

413
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:39,997
The littleness of it...

414
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:43,437
our drawing-room comedy
of sex-obsession!

415
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:46,437
When the war comes,
it'll blow right through it, thank God!

416
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,037
War is impossible,

417
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:50,437
at any rate with this country in it.

418
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:53,477
Is that what they said
at your dinner with the Tories?

419
00:34:53,478 --> 00:34:55,837
In two years, round about
grouse-shooting time,

420
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:57,879
there'll be a European war,
with Britain plumb in the middle of it.

421
00:34:57,903 --> 00:35:00,275
Ah, the Tietjens exactitude!

422
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:04,678
- Where's your evidence?
- In the office.

423
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:07,077
It's late.

424
00:35:07,078 --> 00:35:09,837
We're expected
at the Duchemin's breakfast -

425
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,957
if you haven't been arrested.

426
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:18,917
I gave the policeman a £5 note from
that swine of a Cabinet Minister,

427
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:21,477
though I shouldn't call him that,
he gave me dinner.

428
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:23,398
Besides which, he's a decent fellow.

429
00:35:24,678 --> 00:35:26,957
So it's hands off the Wannop girl.

430
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,237
The fair one -
Miss Valentine Wannop,

431
00:35:31,238 --> 00:35:32,997
holder of the quarter-mile,
half-mile,

432
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,717
high jump and long jump records
for East Sussex,

433
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:40,437
and housemaid-typewriter
for her mother, the novelist.

434
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,237
The other one's not local,
probably London.

435
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:46,038
Never underestimate
the Sussex constabulary.

436
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:51,838
Oh, and it is generally believed that
Miss Wannop and I are in cahoots, if not worse.

437
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,398
Why do you look like that?

438
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:05,118
Because I'm waiting for my wife
to wire me to fetch her home.

439
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:07,958
And this is what I look like.

440
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:22,357
There are times when a woman hates a man,
even a very good man,

441
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:23,397
as my husband was.

442
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:27,917
I have walked behind a man's back
and nearly screamed with

443
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:31,157
the desire to sink my nails
into the veins of his neck.

444
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:33,277
And Sylvia's got it worse than I.

445
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:37,340
If the woman, as the Church directs,
would have children and live decent.

446
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:40,522
- But Sylvia's had a child.
- Whose?!

447
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:44,517
- That blaggard Drake's, wasn't it?
- It was probably Drake's.

448
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:46,597
I am here, you know!

449
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:48,478
I am done with men.

450
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:52,997
Think of all the ruin
that child has meant for me.

451
00:36:52,998 --> 00:36:55,157
And Christopher's
perfectly soppy about it.

452
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:57,157
You don't deserve your husband,
anyway.

453
00:36:57,158 --> 00:37:00,637
I can't imagine
why he sent that telegram.

454
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:01,917
Resume yoke, indeed!

455
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:09,157
He sent it out of lordly, dull, full-dress
consideration that drives me distracted.

456
00:37:09,158 --> 00:37:14,197
He couldn't write me a letter, because he'd
have to put "Dear Sylvia" - and I'm not.

457
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:17,837
He's that precise sort of imbecile.

458
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,517
I'll settle down by his side
and I'll be chaste.

459
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:26,357
I've made up my mind to it.
I'll be bored stiff for the rest of my life,

460
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:32,158
except for one thing - I can torment that man
and I'll do it, for all the times he's tormented me.

461
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:39,158
I've come from Normandy
without sleep, you see.

462
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:49,877
Oh! I'll tell them downstairs
to simply telegraph Christopher,

463
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:51,438
"Righto".

464
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:03,437
I'll send the Reverend Duchemin
a signed copy of my book.

465
00:38:03,438 --> 00:38:05,237
His word still carries weight.

466
00:38:05,238 --> 00:38:10,837
Of course, sucking up to Duchemin was always
the price for kedgeree and poached eggs!

467
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:16,398
Welcome! Welcome!

468
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:19,877
I'm the curate here!

469
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:21,358
Oh, Good Lord.

470
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:30,037
Thank you, thank you!

471
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:34,157
Ups-a-daisy. My name's Horsley.

472
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:36,478
- Macmaster.
- Where did you get this job lot?

473
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:42,157
Gosh, don't you know you've got a 13 hands
pony harness on a 16 and a half hands horse?

474
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:45,998
Let the bit out three holes.
It's tearing the animal's tongue in half.

475
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:50,745
I'm not sure it's playing the game,
Valentine, asking you to be here.

476
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:52,107
If your mother knew...

477
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,237
Mother wanted to come with me when
I told her it was to meet a critic,

478
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:57,718
but I got away in the carriage.

479
00:38:59,398 --> 00:39:02,558
That's perfect.
Nobody will even see your husband.

480
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:07,169
I've told Duchemin's keeper
to keep him out till a quarter past.

481
00:39:07,193 --> 00:39:10,046
I've set a place for your Gertie,
but never mind.

482
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:14,083
We've got the old curate's sister staying with us,
Miss Fox, and she's stone deaf!

483
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:16,420
An empty chair next to her
makes no difference.

484
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:18,381
This way!

485
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:23,357
The ladies will be in here!
We arrived together! He-he!

486
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,437
Miss... Good morning. I'm Macmaster.

487
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:30,917
We're living in a state of siege, ladies.
Tee-hee!

488
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:32,157
It's so good of you to come.

489
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:35,037
Pleasure, thank you for having me.
Christopher Tietjens.

490
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:38,677
A pleasure indeed and you must be
the famous Vincent Macmaster.

491
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:42,317
- Mr Sandbach MP and half a dozen...
- A pleasure, ma'am.

492
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:45,117
- I'm Edith Duchemin and this is Miss Wannop!
- Ah, Miss Wannop!

493
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:47,357
And armed with loaded canes...

494
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,437
Gentlemen, you must be tired from your journey.
Allow me to show you to your seats.

495
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:53,717
- Scouring the country lanes, tee-hee!
- Thank you.

496
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:55,761
- You are here Mr Tietjens, I thought.
- Thank you.

497
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:59,797
And here, for you, Mr Macmaster.
And I next to you!

498
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:02,117
Drink had been taken!

499
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:06,477
If you are hungry, there's...
Well, I hope you'll find something to your liking.

500
00:40:06,478 --> 00:40:11,437
- Thank you.
- Is said to have egged them on.

501
00:40:11,438 --> 00:40:15,637
He's putting up at Lady Claudine's
for Royal duties at Dover.

502
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:19,237
- Campion is taking the escort...
- I must thank you for yesterday.

503
00:40:19,238 --> 00:40:23,223
The Buffs' colours on the altar
of St Peter's tomorrow morning.

504
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:25,922
Ah, Mrs Wannop, what a pleasant surprise!

505
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:28,623
- Mother?!
- Which is Mr Macmaster, the critic?

506
00:40:32,398 --> 00:40:36,317
- Are you Mr Macmaster, the critic?
- I am Macmaster.

507
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:42,637
Oh, Mr Macmaster, my new book
is coming out on Tuesday...

508
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:44,757
Mother,
what have you done with Gertie?

509
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:48,597
She's lying low in the attic...
High, rather.

510
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:53,437
It will be of interest to you
to hear about my book.

511
00:40:53,438 --> 00:40:56,797
To you journalists, a little
inside information is always...

512
00:40:56,798 --> 00:40:58,437
I'm not a journalist!

513
00:40:58,438 --> 00:41:01,825
- Well, a critic.
- I don't review books.-

514
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:05,397
- I'm not a critic in the sense of...
- Of course you are.

515
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,077
I write for
the critical quarterlies.

516
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:11,557
- Mr Macmaster...
- Oh, the critical quarterlies!

517
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:17,197
Mr Horsley, sit Mrs Wannop
next to you and feed her!

518
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:21,637
That is exactly what my book needs -
a good, long, deep...

519
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:24,997
- Ups-a-daisy.
- That's the Reverend's chair.

520
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:28,003
The critical quarterlies have shown
a deplorable lack of interest -

521
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:31,455
- serious interest...
- That's better.

522
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:38,859
- Would you allow me to help you to...?
- Oh, a little caviar. A peach!

523
00:41:39,878 --> 00:41:46,157
I'm afraid I... I'm afraid I must...
You see, my husband...

524
00:41:46,158 --> 00:41:49,077
I beg you, dear lady,
do not concern yourself.

525
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:54,397
I think this party's very badly arranged.
Very bad management.

526
00:41:54,398 --> 00:41:56,547
Or perhaps not.
Sometimes you'd never know he was...

527
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:58,144
One understands.

528
00:41:58,158 --> 00:42:03,317
Only to spend a fleeting hour
in these perfect surroundings.

529
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:06,157
You know the lines,
"As when the swallow

530
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:09,037
"gliding from lofty portal
to lofty portal,

531
00:42:09,038 --> 00:42:12,677
"out of the dark and into the light
and out again into the dark"?

532
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:17,437
- Oh, yes! Yes! It takes a poet!
- I have a message for you, from Mr Waterhouse.

533
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:20,148
I told him I did not know you
and did not expect to see you.

534
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,921
He didn't believe me.

535
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,077
If it's to invite me for a chat,

536
00:42:25,078 --> 00:42:28,037
I don't intend to place myself
in the way of his condescension.

537
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:31,877
No, not that. He wants you to know that
there are no charges against you.

538
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:34,437
Well, what about Gertie?

539
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:37,289
Gertie, too,
as far as yesterday is concerned,

540
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,527
but I'd get her out from your attic,
if she's on the run from the Metropolitan Police,

541
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:43,159
which she is.

542
00:43:00,198 --> 00:43:01,717
Parry?

543
00:43:01,718 --> 00:43:05,957
Good God, it's Parry,
the Bermondsey light-middleweight!

544
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,837
Mr Macmaster seems to know him, too.

545
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:11,318
He taught me to box at Cambridge.

546
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,638
Good morning... Doctor.

547
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:25,037
I- I'm not a doctor.

548
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:26,997
Yes... Yes.

549
00:43:26,998 --> 00:43:32,078
The stethoscope packed in the hat
left in the hall.

550
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:38,237
And your friend? Another medical man?

551
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:40,877
It takes two doctors, of course,

552
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:44,477
to certify a lunatic. Ah, Parry.

553
00:43:44,478 --> 00:43:48,277
Sole fillets - very good!
Kidneys to follow.

554
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:49,278
Very good, sir.

555
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:53,317
I am Macmaster.

556
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:56,158
We corresponded
and you invited me for breakfast.

557
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,557
Of course I did!

558
00:43:58,558 --> 00:44:00,278
Macmaster, the budding critic!

559
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:03,117
And friend.

560
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:07,677
Macmaster and friend to breakfast!

561
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,118
Not medical men.

562
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:14,994
But you look tired.

563
00:44:16,538 --> 00:44:17,778
Worn.

564
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:20,158
Worn out.

565
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:24,358
I detect the pallor of self-abuse.

566
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:30,837
Don't turn round.
Vincent Macmaster is quite capable.

567
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:33,997
Post coitum tristia.
Ah, the sorrows of spent semen!

568
00:44:33,998 --> 00:44:36,917
Boys or girls, in your case?

569
00:44:36,918 --> 00:44:39,637
Sir, your fish is getting cold!
I'll bring the kidneys!

570
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:42,424
If he'll eat a little - it brings
the blood down from the head.

571
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:43,645
Oh, forgive!

572
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:45,157
It's dreadful for you.

573
00:44:45,158 --> 00:44:49,088
My dear lady, please don't worry,
it's what I'm for.

574
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:50,696
Oh, you good man.

575
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:58,637
Deprensum in puero tetricis me vocibus,
uxor, corripis et culum te quoque habere refers.

576
00:44:58,638 --> 00:45:02,077
Of course! The daughter of Professor
Wannop would know her Latin!

577
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:04,797
I can stop this. Shall I?

578
00:45:04,798 --> 00:45:07,477
Yes. Yes, anything!

579
00:45:07,478 --> 00:45:09,517
Marcus Valerius Martialis,
book 11, epigram 43,

580
00:45:09,518 --> 00:45:13,597
the lament of the wife
of a boy-buggerer -

581
00:45:13,598 --> 00:45:16,438
"My dear, I have an arsehole too!"

582
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:21,837
Get him out - the way you beat
Kid Cantor at Hackney Baths!

583
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:25,997
I have often had to refer my wife
to Marcus 11, 43.

584
00:45:25,998 --> 00:45:30,558
"Alas, my dear, with women, it's more
a case of having two cu..." Ugh!

585
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:35,798
You all right, sir?
It's time to write your sermon sir.

586
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,158
Ready? There we go.

587
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:45,597
Dearest lady, it's all over now.
I assure you.

588
00:45:45,598 --> 00:45:49,198
Please forgive!
You can never respect me?

589
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:52,078
You're the bravest woman I know.

590
00:45:56,118 --> 00:45:58,638
Goodbye!

591
00:46:11,598 --> 00:46:14,517
This isn't the rig for you,
Mrs Wannop.

592
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:19,077
A pony and basketwork chaise,
that's the trap for ladies.

593
00:46:19,078 --> 00:46:20,797
But she'll do well for
the work tonight.

594
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:22,717
Tonight?

595
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:25,277
Mr Tietjens means Gertie. Don't you?

596
00:46:25,278 --> 00:46:29,557
Yes. Do you know somewhere Gertie
can wait it out?

597
00:46:29,558 --> 00:46:31,997
They'll be watching
the trains at Ashford Junction.

598
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,757
- Oh, you'll help?
- I will not see you incommoded.

599
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:37,077
You've written the only
novel since the 18th century

600
00:46:37,078 --> 00:46:38,797
I've not had to correct
in the margins.

601
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:40,757
Well!

602
00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:43,517
But what shall we do with Gertie?

603
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:47,837
Bring her over, only don't pull
at her mouth, she'll come easy.

604
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,878
Oh, he is a beast! You don't know
when he's not talking about Gertie.

605
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:04,318
- I'll miss you, Gertie.
- See you in London.

606
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:22,718
She'll be all right.

607
00:47:29,918 --> 00:47:33,038
You should know, Miss Wannop,
we are being talked about.

608
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:37,877
And that'll teach you not to speak
to strange men on golf courses.

609
00:47:37,878 --> 00:47:41,317
It doesn't matter.
It really doesn't matter.

610
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:42,797
You'll live it down.

611
00:47:42,798 --> 00:47:45,478
The only thing that matters
is to do good work.

612
00:47:47,558 --> 00:47:51,277
It's true. I oughtn't to care what
those swines say about me,

613
00:47:51,278 --> 00:47:55,718
but I do, and I care about
what they say about you.

614
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:08,398
Listen.

615
00:48:11,998 --> 00:48:14,597
- A lark?
- Not that.

616
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:16,358
It was a nightingale.

617
00:48:18,158 --> 00:48:21,798
"It was the lark, the herald
of the morn, no nightingale."

618
00:48:23,158 --> 00:48:25,557
"Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale."

619
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,837
There! He sounds hoarse now.

620
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:33,758
Their song changes in June.

621
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:54,717
We're 13 miles from Brede,
six and a half miles from...

622
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:56,878
something like Uddlemere.

623
00:48:58,318 --> 00:48:59,758
The lamp went out.

624
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:02,638
Ground fog.

625
00:49:04,038 --> 00:49:06,158
And we are on the road to Uddlemere.

626
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:11,278
Do you mind telling me
if you know this road at all?

627
00:49:12,638 --> 00:49:14,557
It's Udimore, not Uddlemere.

628
00:49:14,558 --> 00:49:16,317
So it is the right road, then.

629
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:17,510
Go on!

630
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:18,379
Is it?

631
00:49:18,398 --> 00:49:21,157
You wouldn't let the mare go on
another five steps if it wasn't.

632
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,678
- You're soft on her.
- Not as soft as you.

633
00:49:25,038 --> 00:49:27,678
You're not so dreadfully ugly,
really.

634
00:49:31,158 --> 00:49:32,478
Don't mind me, I'm...

635
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:37,718
I'm so happy.

636
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:42,557
The next crossroad
is Grandfather's Wantways.

637
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:45,757
An old gentleman used to sit there
called Gran'fer Finn.

638
00:49:45,758 --> 00:49:50,557
Every Tenterden market day, he sold
fleed cakes from a basket to the carts going by.

639
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:54,717
Tenterden market
was abolished in 1845.

640
00:49:54,718 --> 00:49:56,998
Done in by the repeal
of the Corn Laws.

641
00:49:58,838 --> 00:50:01,598
Why do you suppose I make a
collection of obsolescent facts?

642
00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:04,318
Because you do.

643
00:50:05,398 --> 00:50:08,317
You make Toryism out of them.

644
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:10,517
I thought your type
were all in museums.

645
00:50:10,518 --> 00:50:13,117
You want to be an English country
gentleman spinning

646
00:50:13,118 --> 00:50:16,078
principles out of quaintness,
and letting the country go to hell.

647
00:50:17,238 --> 00:50:19,878
You won't stir a finger except to say,
"I told you so."

648
00:50:32,118 --> 00:50:33,438
Where are you?

649
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:38,117
I wish you'd make some noise.

650
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:43,398
♪ D'ye ken John Peel

654
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,118

657
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:40,117
We're nearly home.

658
00:51:40,118 --> 00:51:42,757
I found a milestone,
we're just above Mountby.

659
00:51:42,758 --> 00:51:44,598
You can go on now.

660
00:51:45,718 --> 00:51:47,157
Walk on.

661
00:51:47,158 --> 00:51:51,197
The Mountby drive is 100 yards.
Just... pull to the left

662
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:53,518
or the horse will walk
straight up to the house.

663
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:02,158
And, look, the sun.

664
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:07,837
It's the beginning of the longest day,
the summer solstice.

665
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:11,958
Sistere and sol, because the sun
seems to stand still.

666
00:52:16,598 --> 00:52:18,277
We got through the night.

667
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:19,638
Miss Wannop...

668
00:52:23,438 --> 00:52:25,558
Damn Mountby.

669
00:52:27,998 --> 00:52:31,878
My dear,
couldn't have lasted forever.

670
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:34,958
But you're a good man.

671
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:38,478
Very clever.

672
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:41,918
You'll make it through.

673
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:48,438
Whoa! Whoa!

674
00:52:58,278 --> 00:52:59,757
Whoa, whoa.

675
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:01,278
Good girl.

676
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:08,477
She's cut badly, come quick.

677
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:10,918
Red stocking from
the flank downwards.

678
00:53:12,718 --> 00:53:15,238
Take off your petticoat.

679
00:53:16,398 --> 00:53:19,118
Tear it into strips.
We need it for bandages.

680
00:53:21,038 --> 00:53:22,198
Jump the hedge.

681
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:24,998
I've seen you jump.

682
00:53:36,238 --> 00:53:41,557
Damn you! Go away! I went past
to get you out of Claudine's sight.

683
00:53:41,558 --> 00:53:44,557
- You'll have to pay for the horse.
- Why should I?

684
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:46,477
For not sounding your horn.

685
00:53:46,478 --> 00:53:50,157
You drove right into my drive!
Besides,

686
00:53:50,158 --> 00:53:51,478
- I did!
- No, you didn't!

687
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:06,397
What am I to tell my sister?
I believe she saw the girl.

688
00:54:06,398 --> 00:54:09,357
Go away. Tell her what you like,
but you'll pay for her horse.

689
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:10,677
I'm damned if I will.

690
00:54:10,678 --> 00:54:13,597
And send out the horse ambulance
when you go through Rye.

691
00:54:13,598 --> 00:54:14,998
There's your sister getting out.

692
00:54:18,398 --> 00:54:20,877
Nobody's dead.
Who was that with Tietjens?

693
00:54:20,878 --> 00:54:23,798
Never you mind.
Get in the car, we'll be late.

694
00:54:32,558 --> 00:54:35,798
Why did you try to quarrel
with the general?

695
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:38,677
You need a quarrel with him,

696
00:54:38,678 --> 00:54:41,398
it'll account for Lady Claudine
spreading slander.

697
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:45,917
You think of everything

698
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:48,638
when most men wouldn't be
able to think at all.

699
00:54:52,438 --> 00:54:54,118
Tell me about Groby.

700
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:59,798
It's older than Protestantism...

701
00:55:02,158 --> 00:55:07,077
And Groby Great Tree is the symbol
of the Yorkshire Tietjens.

702
00:55:07,078 --> 00:55:08,638
It's a big cedar.

703
00:55:10,118 --> 00:55:14,077
The crown darkens our topmost windows,
and the roots undermine our foundations.

704
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:16,798
So one of them will have to go.

705
00:55:18,518 --> 00:55:21,038
House or tree, one day.

706
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:28,118
If I ever take you there...

707
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:33,998
My dear...

708
00:55:35,638 --> 00:55:37,398
You'll never take me to Groby.

709
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:49,317
It's the postmaster's boy.

710
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:51,917
And he can take you home.

711
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:55,397
It's been perhaps
a short acquaintance,

712
00:55:55,398 --> 00:55:58,438
but I think you're
the splendidest...

713
00:56:07,438 --> 00:56:10,157
Whoa! Whoa! You, there.

714
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,478
You, stop there.

715
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:18,917
Good morning, Jimmy.

716
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:22,558
Morning, Miss Wannop.
I was just on my way to your cottage.

717
00:56:24,158 --> 00:56:27,558
There's a telegram re-directed care of Wannop.
It must be Macmaster.

718
00:56:29,118 --> 00:56:32,197
You're to take Miss Wannop home.

719
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:34,478
She's her mother's breakfast
to see to.

720
00:56:41,158 --> 00:56:42,958
Go on.

721
00:57:06,278 --> 00:57:08,478
Damn near forty miles in one night.

722
00:57:10,558 --> 00:57:12,398
You've lost a lot of blood.

723
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:16,638
I let you down, old girl, didn't I?

724
00:57:39,238 --> 00:57:43,946

725
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,317
Oh, that's my first suffragette.

726
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:07,677
I know what it is that makes a man

727
00:58:07,678 --> 00:58:09,717
want to go away
with a woman he likes.

728
00:58:09,718 --> 00:58:11,758
Oh, go away,
if you can't bear to look.

729
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:14,997
But that desire

730
00:58:14,998 --> 00:58:16,638
must be resisted.

731
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,557
Don't touch me now
when it's too late.

732
00:58:20,558 --> 00:58:22,597
You have something to live for.

733
00:58:22,598 --> 00:58:24,757
- Don't you want to be a man of influence?
- No.

734
00:58:24,758 --> 00:58:26,198
I'd prefer to be in the trenches.
