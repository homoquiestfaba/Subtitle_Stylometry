1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,210
<i>There's something I wanna tell you.</i>

2
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,513
<i>After I got shot...</i>

3
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,681
<i>... you wanna know the very first thing</i>
<i>that entered my mind...</i>

4
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,952
<i>... before I blacked out?</i>

5
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,498
<i>Coins.</i>

6
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,903
<i>I'm 8 years old again</i>
<i>on a tour of the U.S. Mint.</i>

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,003
<i>I'm listening to a guide explain</i>
<i>how coins are made.</i>

8
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,611
<i>How they're punched</i>
<i>out of sheet metal.</i>

9
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,009
<i>How they're rimmed and beveled.</i>

10
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,810
<i>How they are stamped and cleaned.</i>

11
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:28,681
<i>And how each and every batch</i>
<i>of coins are personally examined.</i>

12
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:33,121
<i>Just in case any have slipped through</i>
<i>with the slightest imperfection.</i>

13
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,193
<i>That's what popped into my head.</i>

14
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,188
<i>I am a coin</i>
<i>in the United States Army.</i>

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,560
<i>I was minted in the year 1980.</i>
<i>I've been punched from sheet metal.</i>

16
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,501
<i>I've been stamped and cleaned.</i>

17
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,472
<i>My ridges have been rimmed</i>
<i>and beveled.</i>

18
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,779
<i>But now I have</i>
<i>two small holes in me.</i>

19
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,876
<i>I'm no longer in perfect condition.</i>

20
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,414
<i>So there's something else</i>
<i>I wanna tell you.</i>

21
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,183
<i>Right before</i>
<i>everything went black...</i>

22
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:08,759
<i>... you wanna know the</i>
<i>very last thing that entered my mind?</i>

23
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,057
<i>You.</i>

24
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,289
Why not? Because there are
a lot of things you'd be doing.

25
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,429
Just like playing tennis.

26
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,899
Wimbledon? I don't know.

27
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,999
Just gonna go.
I'm gonna host the thing. Six-thirty.

28
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,667
And you and I could go at 10?

29
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,878
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, no!

30
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,140
- Oh, no, Randy, no!
- I'm sorry.

31
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,149
I'll get it, I'll get it,
I'm on it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,445
Okay? I'm on it.

33
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,951
My whole life is in that bag.

34
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,352
I got it. I got it.

35
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,070
You got it.

36
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,584
Dude. I was gonna get that.

37
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,385
I mean, thanks for jumping in.

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,584
Yeah, no problem.

39
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,093
But I mean, hey, I'll take it.

40
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,599
Thank you so much!

41
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,459
Who jumps off a 20-foot pier?

42
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:02,567
Gosh, I'm a mess.
You are a lifesaver. I'm Savannah.

43
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,607
- John.
- John.

44
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:10,010
Brave man. This is my life in here,
so I owe... I owe you.

45
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,207
Don't worry about it.

46
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,413
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

47
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,053
You all have a good night.

48
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,423
Yeah, thanks.
I was in the water for that.

49
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,722
I was seriously getting it for you.

50
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,187
This guy's crazy.

51
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:28,801
Yeah, no, I swear I'm not. I'm not
stalking you. I just gotta get my board.

52
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,267
- Are you staying here?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm from around here.

53
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,999
Hey, John, do you want to...?
My house is right over there.

54
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,838
We were actually going back
right now. Do you want to join us?

55
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,105
We're having a barbecue.

56
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,409
It's okay. I don't want to intrude
on y'all. My dad's making dinner.

57
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,074
Okay.

58
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:50,450
Well, I could at least give you
a beer for the walk home.

59
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,687
- Where is it?
- Right over there.

60
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,686
- You in the military or something?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,921
Really?

62
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,185
What branch are you in?

63
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,659
Army, Special Forces.

64
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,893
Oh, Special Forces.
That's impressive. That's...

65
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,600
Is that like a Special Forces ring they
give you? Is that what it says on it?

66
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,674
It looks nice on you.

67
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,301
Aren't you supposed to be wearing
a hat too? Like a French hat, a beret.

68
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,209
- That's what it's called?
- Randy.

69
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,644
I'm just joking with him.

70
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,548
You shouldn't make fun of a guy
who can kill you with his bare hands.

71
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,885
Big guy.

72
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,355
Rock them, sock them, let's go.

73
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,050
How about that?

74
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,360
You know, I'm gonna go get a beer.

75
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,295
Soldier. Pleasure.

76
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,237
I'm sorry about him.
He thinks he likes me.

77
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,434
Yeah, I think he likes you too.

78
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:22,775
No, I'm not his type.
He just doesn't know it yet.

79
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,117
What?

80
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,785
Come on, I just think
you're probably everybody's type.

81
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,025
See what I mean?

82
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:40,825
Is this who I think it is? Alan, Alan.

83
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,901
Hey, buddy, I want you to meet John.
John, this is Alan.

84
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,505
- Alan, nice to meet you.
- Say hi.

85
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,641
He's a little bit shy, isn't he?

86
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,299
Hey, where's your dad?

87
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:55,277
- Over there.
- Two steps behind, as usual.

88
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,849
Sorry, he's like a heat-seeking missile
every time he sees you.

89
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,610
- Oh, hey, I'm Tim.
- John.

90
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,913
Sorry.

91
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,282
Nice to meet you.

92
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,356
Oh, you Special Forces, huh?

93
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,890
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,228
You stationed out at Fort Bragg?

95
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,126
No, Germany, actually.

96
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,665
- Oh, you're on leave.
- Yes, sir.

97
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,302
I hope you're enjoying yourself.

98
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,762
Yeah, I think I am.

99
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:24,440
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
It's nice to meet you though.

100
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,013
- Nice to meet you too.
- Come on, son. Let's go.

101
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,285
Let's go.

102
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,817
Hello. Hello, John.

103
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,455
Hello, Alan.

104
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,696
- Wow, that was really amazing.
- Yeah?

105
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,527
He never talks to anybody.
Only his family.

106
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,861
He talked to you.

107
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:54,097
Yeah, but I'm practically his family.
I've known him since he was born.

108
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,740
Yeah?

109
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,980
When do you go back?

110
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,619
Two weeks.

111
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,919
It must be scary what you do.

112
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,789
Boring mostly.
You know, long stretches of boring.

113
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,522
Occasional flashes of scary.

114
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,563
Full moon tonight.

115
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,937
Do you ever notice how big
the moon is when it's rising?

116
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,507
And how little it gets
when it's up in the sky.

117
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,670
You know,
that's just your perspective.

118
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,874
It doesn't matter where it is
in the sky or where you are...

119
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,111
...if you hold your hand up
and close one of your eyes...

120
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,316
...it's never bigger than your thumb.

121
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,593
Where'd you learn that?

122
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,289
I don't know.

123
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,557
Somewhere.

124
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,244
You just made your own fire.

125
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,678
That's very impressive.

126
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,410
Very primal.

127
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,553
But you're still not gonna
be able to cook that hotdog, I fear.

128
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,555
I fear that as well.

129
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,292
I should probably
be getting going anyways.

130
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,326
I'm sorry. I hope you don't get into
too much trouble.

131
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,800
I think it's probably too late for that.

132
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,900
Yeah.

133
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,834
Thank you.

134
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,001
Yeah. No, you're welcome.

135
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,977
Would you wanna maybe
do this again tomorrow night?

136
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,986
Tomorrow is chicken.
I don't think you're gonna wanna try it.

137
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,592
I was kind of hoping maybe we'd let
somebody else do the cooking.

138
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,386
Type of thing.

139
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,992
- Okay.
- Yeah?

140
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,759
So maybe I'll come by around
6 or something?

141
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,868
- Okay.
- All right.

142
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,208
So I'll see you soon, then?

143
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,778
I'll see you soon, then.

144
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,780
Yeah. Soon.

145
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,954
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

146
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,125
We're headed into town
for some ice cream. You want a ride?

147
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,395
No, no, no, it's fine.
I don't mind walking at all. It's fine.

148
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,668
Sure?

149
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,308
- All right. I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

150
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,172
Hey, Alan, move on over here.

151
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,642
Here, I'll undo your belt.

152
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,985
Five, six, seven, eight...

153
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,519
- So how long are you in town for?
...nine.

154
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,054
We live here year-round now.

155
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,057
Yeah, we were driving down
every weekend anyways...

156
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:05,527
...so I finally just convinced my wife
this just made the most sense.

157
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,424
- She didn't want ice cream?
- Who?

158
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:12,162
Oh, my wife. No.

159
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,806
No, actually
she's on vacation herself.

160
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,568
White sheep, white sheep,
white sheep.

161
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,076
- It's difficult to take trips together.
- White sheep.

162
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,816
It's fine. We make it work.

163
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,209
I'm up here on the left.

164
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,195
Hey, John.

165
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,824
For the record,
if you do anything to hurt Savannah...

166
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,096
...l'm gonna
have to break something.

167
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:50,732
Something in your leg.
Some... One of the bones in there.

168
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,870
Okay.

169
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:58,278
It's just I know her father and he would
expect me to say something like that.

170
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:02,217
It'd just sound a lot more natural
coming out of his mouth.

171
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,753
It sounded fine.

172
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,247
It sounded fine.

173
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,290
- No, it...
- Yes, it did.

174
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,361
- No, it didn't.
- It did. It really did.

175
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,757
It didn't. But thank you.

176
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,865
- It really did.
- You think so?

177
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,295
Yeah, it did.

178
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,958
Okay.

179
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,204
Hey, don't honk the horn,
it's nighttime.

180
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,744
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Tim.

181
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,417
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah, no problem.

182
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,185
Hey, Dad, I'm not gonna be able
to stay for dinner.

183
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,621
Well, I made lasagna.

184
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,353
I know you made lasagna.
It's Sunday.

185
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,692
Can I borrow the car?

186
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,173
Thanks.

187
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,980
- Best seafood you'll ever have.
- Yeah, I know.

188
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,116
- I used to come here all the time.
- Really?

189
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,151
Are you sure you don't wanna go
somewhere, I don't know, nice?

190
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,982
Nice? No, I wanna go
somewhere good.

191
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,988
Okay.

192
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,026
What the hell you doing here?

193
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,430
Come on, Steve.
It's been three years already.

194
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,194
I don't want any trouble here.

195
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,839
You're not gonna get any. I promise.

196
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,342
All right.

197
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,943
Thank you.

198
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,317
What happened
with that guy out there?

199
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,509
- What guy?
- What's the story with him?

200
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,086
- No story.
- Really?

201
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,347
Yeah.

202
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,688
He's an old buddy of mine.

203
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,220
What?

204
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,731
Your dad get mad at you
for coming home late last night?

205
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,939
No. He's not really the type
that gets mad.

206
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,772
What kind of guy is he then?

207
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,143
Quiet one?

208
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,918
- Could be worse, I guess.
- I guess.

209
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,913
And your mom?

210
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,820
Nope, just me and my dad.

211
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,854
Did he raise you all by himself?

212
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,663
Yeah.

213
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,562
Why do you wanna know
about my dad?

214
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,293
Just curious.

215
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,001
Curious about
where you come from.

216
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,807
I wanna meet your dad.

217
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,013
Tonight.

218
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,585
Look, you're... You're not
gonna get very much out of him.

219
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,921
So, I don't know,
just don't take it personally, okay?

220
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,589
Hey, Pop.

221
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,459
I got somebody I want you to meet.

222
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,265
Hey.

223
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,100
- This is Savannah.
- Hi.

224
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,742
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Tyree.

225
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,340
He... This is my... He collects coins.
He... It's kind of like his big hobby.

226
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,508
This is amazing.

227
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,122
You have so many coins.
How did you get started in all this?

228
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,880
Through John, actually.

229
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,419
Not his thing anymore.

230
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:06,360
- Hey, we should probably maybe go.
- What is this coin?

231
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:10,127
That's a Sacagawean mule.

232
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,769
It's actually...

233
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:20,377
- Do you want to see some more?
- Absolutely, yes, if you don't mind.

234
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,606
- Put this glove on then.
- Thanks.

235
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,246
This is a humorous one.
This is a satirical coin.

236
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,445
This is massive.

237
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,352
Yeah, William Jennings Bryan,
when he ran for president...

238
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,688
...he was... He believed in...
No, don't turn it over.

239
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,124
Leave it here.

240
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:42,358
Do you remember that he had
the free silver policy. You remember.

241
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:47,665
And McKinley was his opponent
and he's... Wait, here.

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,277
Now see, that's a real silver dollar.
That's the size of a silver dollar.

243
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,244
And McKinley said that if
Bryan had his way...

244
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,907
...then the silver dollars
would be that big. Yeah.

245
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,110
- That's amazing.
- Can you imagine...

246
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,755
...walking around with that
in your pocket?

247
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,221
- That's really funny.
- That's humorous.

248
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,694
Now, these...

249
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,798
Pop, we can't do this right now.
We can't be here all night.

250
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,866
I have... I have some to show you.

251
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,593
This is fascinating.

252
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,204
These are all matched in color.

253
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,942
I had fun tonight.

254
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,441
I like your dad.

255
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,949
You shouldn't be too hard on him.

256
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,416
He loves you.

257
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,112
I can tell even if you can't.

258
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,956
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
Wait, Savannah. I mean...

259
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,963
So I guess I'll see you soon, then?

260
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,401
I'll see you soon, then.

261
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,168
Where you been all day?

262
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,837
- I've been busy.
- You're on spring break.

263
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,539
You're supposed to be
lounging on the beach all day.

264
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,413
You're not supposed to be busy
doing things.

265
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,484
I want to show you something.

266
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:50,658
The family that lived here, their home
was damaged by the hurricane.

267
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,788
- What, so now you're rebuilding it?
- Yup. Well, not just me.

268
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,162
You're starting to make me
a little nervous.

269
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,736
Why am I
starting to make you nervous?

270
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,539
Because I'm starting to think you
might be too good of a person for me.

271
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,803
No, I'm not that good of a person.

272
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,973
You're sneaking off every day to do
manual labor on a house for charity.

273
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,086
- On your spring break.
- Yeah, you're right.

274
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,849
It's selfish, really,
me being this generous.

275
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,521
- You don't drink, you don't smoke.
- Nope. Nope.

276
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,257
- You probably don't sleep around.
- Absolutely not.

277
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,931
Okay, look, you gotta have a fault.

278
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:35,005
- I do.
- Okay, care to enlighten me?

279
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,908
I curse.

280
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,440
- No.
- I do.

281
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,671
- No, you don't.
- I do.

282
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:47,114
- I haven't heard you.
- Well, that's because it's in my mind.

283
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,187
There's a never-ending stream
of curse words...

284
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,947
...that I'm thinking at all times.

285
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,251
Okay, fine, just say one then.

286
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,451
No, I can't tell you because it's filthy.

287
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,357
- Right.
- Yeah.

288
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,623
Okay, all right. Fair enough.

289
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,790
No, I have faults, John.

290
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:06,404
Trust me, I have plenty of them.
You'll see.

291
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,462
I hope so.

292
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,906
We have to be finished
with this in three weeks.

293
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,670
Hope that actually happens.

294
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,939
These are to be the bedrooms,
parents' room...

295
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,278
...the boys' rooms,
two boys, 7 and 9.

296
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,352
Living room and the bathroom.

297
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,716
And then this is the kitchen.

298
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,586
This is the best room because
the mom's a really good cook.

299
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,288
We're gonna make it really beautiful
with white tile floors and tiles...

300
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:37,367
...on the countertops
and there's gonna be a roof.

301
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,869
- Here, John, come here.
- A roof would definitely be good.

302
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,637
It's gonna be like this,
but it's gonna be everywhere.

303
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,369
It's the only cover we have.

304
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,106
Nice, we're gonna be here
for a while.

305
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,483
Where'd you get your scar?

306
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,776
That one?

307
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,085
A knife fight.

308
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:05,852
It was five years ago, we were really
drunk and the guy went for my eye.

309
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,259
That's terrible.

310
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,966
Why? He missed.

311
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:16,331
The way people act around you, the
way they treated you at that restaurant.

312
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:20,300
- It's like they're scared of you.
- They're not scared of me.

313
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,445
They might be scared
of who I used to be.

314
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,344
And who is that?

315
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,880
Somebody different?

316
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,680
So when did you change?
When you went into the Army?

317
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,694
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, partly yeah.

318
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,159
And the other part?

319
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,256
I don't know,
I'm still working on that.

320
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,463
So you used to be tough.

321
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,835
And maybe you still are a little bit.

322
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,909
- You don't scare me, John.
- No?

323
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,913
Well, you scare me.

324
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,307
Don't worry about him.

325
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,747
John!

326
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,494
What, you think you're safe
in there? Okay.

327
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,872
No!

328
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,700
It's all right.
Everybody understands.

329
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,601
What are you doing over here?

330
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,134
You're missing the party.

331
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,297
The party's just managing fine
without me.

332
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,332
What's wrong?

333
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,079
Why are you all the way
over here by yourself?

334
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,815
I'm dying, John.

335
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,444
What?

336
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,816
That's not even funny.

337
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,583
I'm gonna miss you.

338
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,189
It's almost over.

339
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,829
No, it's not almost over.

340
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,259
Yes, it is.

341
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,392
I leave tomorrow.
I have to go back to school.

342
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,628
- So?
- And you.

343
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:16,331
No, and me nothing.
My commitment's up in 12 months.

344
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,039
And then I'm back. For good.

345
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,974
A lot could happen
in 12 months, John.

346
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,308
You don't think I know that?

347
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,940
I know that.

348
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,920
And I'm not afraid at all.

349
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,423
I promise you...

350
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,325
...that it'll all be over
sooner than you think.

351
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,633
Then I'll be back for good.

352
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,237
You promise?

353
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,768
I promise.

354
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:15,321
I'm probably gonna be out of the Army
way before you're out of school.

355
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,330
Am I gonna be in the audience
when you graduate?

356
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,371
I think I might take
a little longer to graduate.

357
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,704
Been spending so much time
around your dad...

358
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,879
...and I think now
I want to teach special education.

359
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,643
- You don't say.
- I don't know why it's taken me...

360
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:38,915
...so long to realize. I mean,
I've lived next to Alan my whole life...

361
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,856
I'm sorry, back up. What does
that have to do with my dad?

362
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,694
Well, there's...

363
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:53,703
I mean, there's an explanation
for why he is the way he is.

364
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,575
Forget it. Never mind.

365
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,801
- No, no, no.
- No, let's go. Come here.

366
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,742
What?
So, just, what were you saying?

367
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,680
I grew up next to a kid with autism.

368
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,450
- I have a frame of reference.
- Whoa, autistic?

369
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:16,253
You saying my dad's like Alan?
You're saying my dad's retarded?

370
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,795
No, Alan's not retarded, John.
He's autistic.

371
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,762
There are milder forms of it
and these things go undiagnosed.

372
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:26,495
Is this what you've been doing?
You've just been studying my dad?

373
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,605
No. How could you even say that?

374
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:32,072
I've lived with my dad my entire life.
Put up with him my entire life.

375
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,541
You think I don't know
that he's not normal?

376
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,308
Yeah?

377
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,348
You think I need you to tell me
he's not normal?

378
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,552
Yeah.

379
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,686
Hey, soldier, leaving so soon, huh?

380
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,094
Here, have a beer. It's on me.

381
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,826
Come on, you should drink.
It'll make you feel better.

382
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,993
- Now's not a good time, all right?
- You sad?

383
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,436
No, come on. You just need to relax.
Come on. Just relax a little bit.

384
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,303
What's going on with Savannah?

385
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,502
- Just leave me alone.
- What's with Savannah?

386
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,011
- How about you get your hands off?
- Come on.

387
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,240
What is happening
with you and Savannah...?

388
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,850
Hey, man, what are you doing?

389
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,682
John!

390
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,917
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

391
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,648
- John!
- Stop him. What is he doing?

392
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,299
- Help him!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

393
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,593
I don't think she's home now.

394
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,321
But she hasn't
gone back to school yet.

395
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:06,062
She normally comes by and says
goodbye before she heads back, but...

396
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,474
Oh, shit, Tim.

397
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,339
Jesus, I'm sorry, man.

398
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:17,504
Hey, I like it.

399
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,582
I think it makes me look
pretty tough.

400
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,314
I just... I had no idea
it was you back there.

401
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,515
Hey, it was my fault.

402
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,148
I don't know what I was thinking,
sneaking up behind a green beret.

403
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,318
Hey, if you see her...

404
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,694
...can you give her a message
for me?

405
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,333
Yeah.

406
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,461
Just tell her I came by...

407
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,896
...and that I...

408
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,405
You wanna write it down?

409
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,601
Yeah.

410
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,013
I'll make sure she gets it.

411
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,584
Thank you.

412
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,890
Hey, Pop.

413
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,227
I didn't know if anyone
else was coming so...

414
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,430
...I made double.

415
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,416
No, I'll do it.

416
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,028
- I got it, Dad. It's okay. I got it.
- No, I'll do it.

417
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,290
- They're clean.
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

418
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,699
Okay.

419
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,150
Looks like you're gonna have
leftovers for once.

420
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:12,325
Oh, I'll have it next Sunday.

421
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,314
Excuse me, Pop.

422
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,356
Got your note.

423
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,854
- Short, sweet, to the point.
- I'm sorry.

424
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,495
John, I'm sorry.

425
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,793
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

426
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,696
I didn't mean to make you feel that.

427
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:54,360
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
No business pretending I'm a doctor.

428
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,734
- I was watching him today.
- John.

429
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,604
Please, I'm serious. I don't know
what I'm talking about.

430
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,677
I really don't. It means nothing.

431
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,279
Okay?

432
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,747
I'm headed back to school.

433
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,751
And I just wanted
to make sure that, you know...

434
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,684
Make sure that what?

435
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,291
I made you a promise, didn't I?

436
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,425
Yeah.

437
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:24,362
You wrote your first note
so I wrote mine.

438
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,299
Don't read it now. Wait till I'm gone.

439
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,804
Okay.

440
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:34,741
- Hey, can you...? You hungry?
- Yes.

441
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:38,939
Yeah? My dad made
a little extra for you.

442
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,982
You know, it's Sunday.

443
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,380
Okay.

444
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,521
- I can only stay a little while.
- I know.

445
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,917
Come on.

446
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,295
<i>Dear John...</i>

447
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,555
<i>... two weeks together...</i>

448
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,758
<i>... that's all it took.</i>

449
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,705
<i>Two weeks for me</i>
<i>to fall in love with you.</i>

450
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,354
<i>Now we have one year apart.</i>

451
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:24,258
<i>But what's one year apart</i>
<i>after two weeks like that together?</i>

452
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,473
- All right, Pop.
- Okay.

453
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,632
I gotta go.

454
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,176
- You be good, okay?
- Okay.

455
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,835
So...

456
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,340
- We're good. All right. See you later.
- Okay.

457
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,262
<i>You made me a promise.</i>

458
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,454
<i>A promise I know you'll keep.</i>

459
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:05,492
<i>So I only want one more promise from</i>
<i>you during this time we spend apart.</i>

460
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,235
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

461
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,175
<i>Write it all down, John.</i>
<i>Scribble it in a notebook.</i>

462
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,811
<i>Type it out, e-mail it to me...</i>

463
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,411
<i>... I don't care,</i>
<i>but I wanna know everything.</i>

464
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:25,181
<i>Then we'll be with each other all the</i>
<i>time even if we're not with each other.</i>

465
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,554
<i>That way before we know it,</i>
<i>I'll see you soon, then.</i>

466
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,872
- What's up, girls?
- Johnny!

467
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,200
What up, man?

468
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,967
- Hey, there he is.
- Look who it is.

469
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,510
- Welcome back, John.
- Look at you.

470
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,579
Welcome back.
Take a look at your voucher.

471
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,306
All right.

472
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,316
How was Atlantic City, man?

473
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,420
No, laugh it up. That's great.
Yeah. That's the one thing I ask him.

474
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,492
I didn't say.
First time I've seen him.

475
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,152
- Wouldn't ask if you didn't know.
- How could he know?

476
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,355
Don't even bother unpacking, guys.

477
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:12,196
We move out bright and early.
Enjoy.

478
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,572
Well, I'm excited.

479
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,278
<i>Dear Savannah, I promise.</i>
<i>I promise I'll see you soon, then.</i>

480
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,411
<i>I promise I'll write all the time.</i>

481
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,920
<i>I promise I'll tell you everything.</i>

482
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,324
<i>Be patient with me, it may take a while</i>
<i>for these letters to get back to you.</i>

483
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,228
<i>We've already been deployed</i>
<i>out on a mission.</i>

484
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,530
Come on, soldier, move it, move it.
Let's go!

485
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:57,039
<i>The problem is we can't exactly</i>
<i>use the local postal system here.</i>

486
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,706
<i>And there's no such thing</i>
<i>as Internet connection.</i>

487
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,478
<i>So I have to send everything</i>
<i>from here out by airmail.</i>

488
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,587
- Can you get this out for me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

489
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,316
- Don't lose it, all right?
- Yeah, I gotcha.

490
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:15,397
<i>Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to say</i>
<i>exactly where here is.</i>

491
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,297
<i>All I can tell you is</i>
<i>where we've been sent...</i>

492
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,630
<i>... makes me miss America</i>
<i>very much.</i>

493
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:25,773
<i>And the lack of anything resembling</i>
<i>an ocean makes me miss Charleston.</i>

494
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:58,339
<i>And everything around me</i>
<i>makes me miss you.</i>

495
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:04,678
<i>We move around a lot. So letters</i>
<i>tend to come late and out of order.</i>

496
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,783
<i>We may want to number</i>
<i>our letters...</i>

497
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,442
<i>... just so we know which order</i>
<i>we wrote them in.</i>

498
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,852
<i>But when they do finally get here...</i>

499
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,548
<i>... it's a good day.</i>

500
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,560
- <i>Whenever they don't...</i>
- All right, let's see here.

501
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:23,290
Not for me. Not for me.

502
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:27,301
Not for me. And not for me.

503
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,529
Figures.

504
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,674
- <i>... it's not.</i>
- Nothing for you either.

505
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:35,141
<i>But I know they'll still come.</i>
<i>I know it.</i>

506
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,488
That's right.

507
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,089
<i>Letter Number 8.</i>

508
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:54,357
<i>Dear John, I'm back at my</i>
<i>parents' farm for the weekend.</i>

509
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,092
<i>And they have some house guests</i>
<i>you may know.</i>

510
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,262
Savannah!

511
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,906
Savannah!

512
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,241
I think that horse suits you just fine.

513
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:14,316
<i>I took Alan out riding with me today.</i>
<i>It was his first time on a horse.</i>

514
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,145
You look good on that horse, Alan.

515
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:20,950
<i>You've heard of horse sense, horses</i>
<i>are somehow able to sense danger?</i>

516
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,218
<i>Sense out evil?</i>

517
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,852
<i>Well, I think autistic kids</i>
<i>have that too...</i>

518
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,129
<i>... so I had this idea.</i>

519
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,029
<i>This dream.</i>

520
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,967
<i>I wanna open up</i>
<i>a summer camp for autistic kids.</i>

521
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,073
I've never seen him
act like this before.

522
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,066
Are you hungry?

523
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,312
<i>Where they can ride horses</i>
<i>as much as they want.</i>

524
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,540
Are you hungry?

525
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,411
<i>For once in their life, a place where</i>
<i>they won't have to worry about a thing.</i>

526
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,117
<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>Pipe dream, huh?</i>

527
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,225
<i>No, it's not a pipe dream.</i>

528
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,555
<i>It's a perfect dream.</i>

529
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,926
Erget. Merry Christmas.

530
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:07,229
John, to a Mr. John Tyree.

531
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,497
- Shut up, man.
- Seven?

532
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,275
- Stop moving around.
- Can I keep this one?

533
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,572
<i>Letter Number 33.</i>

534
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:18,010
<i>Dear Savannah, the good news is</i>
<i>we've been sent somewhere new.</i>

535
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,912
<i>Although I can't tell you</i>
<i>where that is either.</i>

536
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:25,545
<i>The bad news is, this place actually</i>
<i>makes me miss the old place.</i>

537
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,624
<i>But it's a full moon here tonight,</i>
<i>which makes me think of you.</i>

538
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:32,991
<i>Because I know that no matter what</i>
<i>I'm doing, no matter where I am...</i>

539
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,258
<i>... this moon will always be</i>
<i>the same size as yours.</i>

540
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,992
<i>Half a world away.</i>

541
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,627
<i>Dear John...</i>

542
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,933
<i>... most nights I fall asleep</i>
<i>worrying about you.</i>

543
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,406
<i>Wondering where</i>
<i>you may be out there.</i>

544
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,505
<i>Not tonight.</i>

545
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,740
<i>Tonight you're here with me.</i>

546
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,321
<i>I visited your dad yesterday.</i>

547
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:04,520
<i>Summer's almost over and I wanted to</i>
<i>see him before I went back to school.</i>

548
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:05,787
<i>I hope that's okay.</i>

549
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,157
Hey.

550
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,662
I made you a pie.

551
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,899
<i>He made me dinner.</i>
<i>It was Sunday so we had lasagna.</i>

552
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:17,632
<i>And I got him talking about his coins.</i>
<i>So we had plenty of conversation.</i>

553
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,938
This one is kind of a cull,
a coin that's in really bad shape.

554
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:25,309
- Worthless to most collectors.
- But not to you.

555
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,444
No, not to me.

556
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,381
What is your favorite coin?

557
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:34,849
Out of all the coins that you have,
what is your absolute favorite coin?

558
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,816
Do you have one?

559
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,304
'Seventy-eight Jefferson mule.

560
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,204
That'd be my favorite.

561
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,608
Definitely.

562
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,344
Why? Is it worth the most?

563
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,477
Well, it's worth a lot, not the most.

564
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,552
But, you know...

565
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,882
What's the story behind it?

566
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,120
Here's one...

567
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:17,063
<i>So I'll ask you instead, John,</i>
<i>wherever you may be.</i>

568
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,577
<i>Dear Savannah, only because</i>
<i>I promised to tell you everything.</i>

569
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,640
Thank you.

570
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:34,306
<i>When I was 7 years old,</i>
<i>I bought an ice cream cone.</i>

571
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:40,050
<i>On the way home, I noticed one of</i>
<i>the pennies wasn't actually a penny.</i>

572
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,861
I don't know.

573
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:00,334
I don't know.
Never seen anything like it.

574
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,313
Did you find this, son?

575
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:05,640
Yeah?

576
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,117
No, it's a mule.

577
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,887
- It's a what?
- A mule. An error coin.

578
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,888
Every now and then
they make mistakes...

579
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,755
...batch accidentally slips through,
this thing...

580
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:22,729
...head's a nickel, tail's a penny. Mule.
Really more of a novelty than anything.

581
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,391
<i>Remember the horse sense</i>
<i>you were talking about?</i>

582
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,594
- The kid found it
I will buy it anyway.

583
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,398
Twenty bucks.

584
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,601
- No, thank you.
- <i>Well, my dad has it too.</i>

585
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,939
Now, wait a minute. Hang on.

586
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,309
Let me take another look
at that real quick.

587
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,276
John, let's go.

588
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,047
I'll be damned.

589
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,384
- Do you know what this is?
- No.

590
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,696
Look at that.

591
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,235
That's your coin.

592
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:02,895
You want my advice?

593
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,734
Dad to Dad?

594
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,239
Keep it.

595
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,140
Hold on to it.
Pass it down to your son.

596
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,214
Let him pass it to his son
and on and on, I'll tell you what...

597
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:16,285
...30, 40, a hundred years
from now...

598
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:20,082
...you're gonna have something
worth a whole lot more than $4000.

599
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,986
I promise you.

600
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,094
Hey.

601
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,820
Do you want to keep it?

602
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,830
- Good for you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

603
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,900
<i>At first I loved chasing after</i>
<i>those mules with my father.</i>

604
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,405
<i>We finally had something</i>
<i>to talk about.</i>

605
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,009
<i>You know, something</i>
<i>we could do together.</i>

606
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,212
<i>But he became obsessed with them.</i>
<i>You know how he is.</i>

607
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,285
<i>And then I became a teenager</i>
<i>and you know how I am.</i>

608
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:52,513
All the way up to Wooster
for another coin show. I'm just...

609
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,715
No, I'm not doing that.

610
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,360
You're going to one
every weekend now.

611
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:02,190
Oh, that's good.
I love warm milk. That's nice.

612
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,359
You spend all of our money on coins.
Get a fricking fridge that works.

613
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,874
<i>Eventually he stopped talking</i>
<i>about coins with me altogether.</i>

614
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:20,443
<i>And when that happened...</i>

615
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:24,053
<i>... we found there wasn't all that much</i>
<i>left to talk about.</i>

616
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,361
<i>So that's the story.</i>

617
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:36,033
<i>I miss you so much it hurts.</i>

618
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,933
Sorry, sorry.

619
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,601
Oh, my God.
My brother was in the towers.

620
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:47,301
- I love you too, babe.
- Please call me as soon as you can.

621
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,249
- Susan. Susan, is my dad there?
- Just calm down.

622
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,386
All right, fellas, here's the deal.

623
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,822
Requesting permission
to extend my tour, sir.

624
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,859
Requesting permission
to extend, sir.

625
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:41,293
Requesting permission
to extend as well, sir.

626
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,160
Requesting permission
to extend, sir.

627
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,631
Requesting permission
to extend as well, sir.

628
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,705
Okay, guys, listen. We're gonna get
our orders from Operations on Monday.

629
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:53,707
Before we do anything rash, let's take
the weekend to mull this over, all right?

630
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,708
I got a wife and kids to think about.

631
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,775
Nobody's asking you
to stay on too, captain.

632
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,008
Yeah, you are. This is my team.

633
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:02,652
Where you go, I go.

634
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,186
Where we go, we all go.

635
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:08,722
If everyone still wants to extend
on Monday, then we'll do it.

636
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,257
Together.

637
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,825
Don't get into trouble over there.

638
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,933
- Take care of yourself.
- Always.

639
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,661
Let's go, man.
The plane to Paris leaves in an hour.

640
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,396
You ready? Are you ready?

641
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,302
- It's gonna be amazing.
- I can't go.

642
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:25,839
What? Of course you're going.

643
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,237
I gotta go to Charleston.

644
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,208
- You're going to Charleston?
- Yup.

645
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,574
What are you, nuts?
We got two days off, man.

646
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,911
By the time you fly there and back,
you're gonna have like 18 hours.

647
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,349
It's 18 more than I had this morning.

648
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,381
I don't know when
I'll get that again...

649
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,149
...so I gotta go.

650
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,055
Nothing I can say
to change your mind?

651
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,495
Nope.

652
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,195
John!

653
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,802
John. John.
