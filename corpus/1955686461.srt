1
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,421
Where were you during
lauds? Why did you miss lauds?

2
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:43,989
She got out last night,
and I had to find her.

3
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,257
Took me all morning.

4
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,392
She got out again?
- Yeah.

5
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,428
Do you think she's
getting through the gate?

6
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,395
You think she could
get through the gate?

7
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,730
I should check the gates.

8
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,365
Or maybe she got
through the wall.

9
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,900
How would she get
through the wall, though?

10
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,279
I don't know. Why do you
care about the donkey so much?

11
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,326
Just doesn't make any sense.

12
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:02,085
Why are you wearing
your black habit? It's spring.

13
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,731
Because it was
dark when I left,

14
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:06,220
and it was the closest thing to me,
so I grabbed it. I finished my change.

15
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,591
Why are you asking me
so many questions?

16
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,607
Beautiful morning, sisters.

17
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:15,287
I told you to never talk to us,
you piece of shit! - How dare you, fuckers!

18
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,863
Get the fuck out of here!

19
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,991
<i> Blessed art thou, o Lord.</i>
<i> Teach me to know Thy will.</i>

20
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:32,492
By these lips, let the awards
thou makest ever be recorded.

21
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,720
Blithely, as one that has
found great possessions,

22
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:37,743
I follow thy decrees.

23
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,046
Bethinking me still
of the charge thou givest,

24
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,370
I will mark thy footsteps.

25
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:45,570
Be thy covenant
ever my delight,

26
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,905
thy words kept in memory.

27
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,318
Christ the lord was tempted
and suffered for us.

28
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,138
Come, let us adore him.

29
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,407
So, why weren't you at lauds
this morning?

30
00:04:57,442 --> 00:05:00,264
Because the donkey escaped in
the woods, and I had to catch her.

31
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,822
The donkey escaped again?

32
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:03,751
Yeah. I think she
got through the gate.

33
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,092
She got through the gate.

34
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:09,513
All right. Well... - But I'll
make sure it doesn't happen again.

35
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,576
Okay, good.
I'll tell father Tommasso.

36
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,005
<i> What's going on</i>
<i> with sister Alessandra?</i>

37
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,288
She's been so out of it.

38
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,047
I don't know. Her dad's probably
visiting or something. - Again?

39
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:55,143
Yeah.
She's fucking delusional.

40
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:57,026
Yeah. She's so delusional.

41
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,946
She's pathetic.

42
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:02,886
Just because your dad
gives money to the convent,

43
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:04,979
doesn't mean you're gonna
get everything you want. - Yeah.

44
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,786
(?....) another day, and she was literally
just staring out the window

45
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:10,054
for, like, 10 minutes,
not moving.

46
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:11,114
Really?

47
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:14,226
She's probably, like,
daydreaming about some guy

48
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:16,916
that's gonna magically come
and take her away from here.

49
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:18,352
It's like, "good luck."

50
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,563
I know.

51
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,103
So, what was mother
Marea saying to you earlier?

52
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:36,450
Nothing. Mind your
own fucking business.

53
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,811
Okay.

54
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,593
But I'll do that, yeah.

55
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:55,647
I can sweep it
if you want me to.

56
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,861
For some reason,
it keeps getting unorganized,

57
00:06:57,896 --> 00:06:59,262
and I'm not really sure
who's doing that.

58
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:01,091
Okay, yes, maybe
you could sweep the cellar,

59
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:03,045
because that's very dusty,
you know.

60
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,648
That's the cellar
and the altar.

61
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:07,699
because, for some reason,
it keeps getting all messed up,

62
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,415
and I'm not really
sure who's doing that.

63
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,262
But also, mother, there's
something else you should know. - Yes?

64
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:16,892
Last night at dinner. - Mmm- hmm.
- I saw sister Latizia take two portions.

65
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,795
I don't know. Maybe you're not
counting, so maybe it doesn't matter.

66
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,704
Just in case you are,
it was sister Latizia.

67
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,733
I don't think you should be concerning
yourself with the amount somebody is eating.

68
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,610
We all require
different amounts of food.

69
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,674
I know that some days I need
more food, some days less...

70
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:39,560
So, watching me eat so carefully,
that would make me uncomfortable.

71
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:42,173
So I don't think you should be
bothering yourself with that.

72
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:43,579
Yes, mother.

73
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:47,336
Hi, dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.

74
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:50,253
How are you, my angel?
- I'm good. How are you?

75
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,415
I'm well. You look beautiful.

76
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,331
Thank you.

77
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,468
What I can make out.

78
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,285
You look terrific.
Are they feeding you?

79
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,591
Eh...

80
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:03,249
They should be feeding you,
for all the money we send them here.

81
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:06,232
But you look beautiful.
- Thank you. Thank you. How's mom?

82
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:09,141
Mom is good. Mom is...
Everybody's well.

83
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:11,017
Good. The merchant Ricardo,
how's he?

84
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,406
Merchant Ricardo, uh, yes.
Glad you brought it up.

85
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:16,193
He's good.
- Has he asked about me?

86
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:18,296
Sure. You bet he has.

87
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,124
Hmm.

88
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,460
I was hoping that we'd have
the whole dowry situation locked up,

89
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,385
and, um,
we're not there just yet.

90
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:27,913
They're asking
for a lot of money,

91
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,381
and, you know, with the
money we're sending here,

92
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:34,444
and then to your sisters
and their children, it's a...

93
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:38,172
There's a lot of money going
out and not that much coming in, so...

94
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:42,128
But maybe... if we sent less
money here to the convent,

95
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:43,594
we could save it up,

96
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:46,081
and I could even come
and live with you and mom and...

97
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:47,824
I don't think sending less
money here is a good idea,

98
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:51,387
because, uh, that would
reflect badly on the family.

99
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:54,924
But I know how eager you are
to be married, my baby.

100
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:59,089
I know, but maybe it's...
Maybe that's not your calling.

101
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:04,121
How's your embroidery
going? You still doing that?

102
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,939
Mmm- hmm.

103
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,470
Because you so good, and
maybe that's your calling, you know.

104
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:12,238
Some people, it's marriage and
family and the warmth of a home,

105
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:15,339
and maybe for you it's...
It's the detailed embroidery.

106
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:17,982
You know, keep... please.

107
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:19,610
Keep your chin up.

108
00:09:20,152 --> 00:09:21,505
Give me...
Give me a little sugar.

109
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,871
Hey, hey, sweetie.

110
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:26,124
All right. Daddy loves you.

111
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:27,794
I love you.

112
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:30,700
Okay. All right,
you take care, and...

113
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:33,081
You don't... don't...
Don't you lose hope.

114
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:48,078
<i> The body of Christ.</i>

115
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,579
Amen.

116
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,850
The body of Christ.
- Amen.

117
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:58,021
The body of Christ.
- Amen.

118
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,161
The body of Christ.
- Amen.

119
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,066
Are you all right?

120
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,787
The body of Christ.

121
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,394
So, sister Alessandra,
how was your father's visit?

122
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:28,542
Good.

123
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,453
Good?

124
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:33,026
Yes, it was good.

125
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:38,951
Any potential suitors?

126
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:42,906
That's not even
what his visit was about.

127
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:45,046
We didn't even talk about that.
- Then what was his visit about?

128
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:49,418
Oh, my God. Hey, I told you
not to fucking look at us, you creep.

129
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:52,615
I'm sorry. I am... - Why are
you making eye contact with us?

130
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,211
Look at the ground,
you fucking pervert!

131
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,504
I'm sorry. - What is
this shit? - This is a turnip.

132
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:58,030
That's not a turnip!
It's shit!

133
00:10:58,065 --> 00:11:01,187
You expect us to eat shit?
You're a piece of shit!

134
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,587
Yeah, you are a piece of shit.
You're disgusting! - I'm sorry.

135
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,259
Yeah, you are
a disgusting piece of shit!

136
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:09,721
Think we can just eat any of this food?
We're fucking starving! You can't do anything right!

137
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,630
Look at this wall!
Look at the stuff you build!

138
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:13,458
It's horrible,
you fucking imbecile!

139
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:15,047
What do you even do here?

140
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:16,888
Please, please.
- Think you can talk to us?

141
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:17,601
You think you can look at us?

142
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:19,150
You know who my father is?

143
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:22,025
He pays you good money
to do nothing, you little rat!

144
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,937
You're a little fucking rat!

145
00:11:23,972 --> 00:11:25,219
What is this, maggot food?

146
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:29,174
Just hoarding all the food,
huh, like a fucking Jew?

147
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:31,933
Is that what you're doing?
We're all starving!

148
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:33,788
You know what you did!

149
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:36,567
We hate you!
- You deserve to die!

150
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:43,904
All right. Almost ready?
- Tommasso, yes.

151
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:46,820
Almost ready.
- Oh, look at this!

152
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:48,509
Isn't it beautiful?

153
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:50,767
That's gorgeous.
Who did that? - Sister Alessandra.

154
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:53,341
We have to make more
of that. That'll go big in town.

155
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:57,874
Tell Lurco to keep that garden gate
closed, because the deer are getting into it.

156
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:58,775
All right.

157
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,840
Are you ready for a journey?
Are you ready?

00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:39,950
They're not good people.
- No, Lurco...

170
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:42,720
No, I'm leaving.
The nuns, no. They spit on me.

171
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,422
Who spit on you?
- They spit on me.

172
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:45,976
Lurco, I have to leave.

173
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,119
I'm about to leave to go to the
market to sell the fabrics, please!

174
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,229
Father, I'm very sorry,
I'm very sorry. They spit on me.

175
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:52,446
They called me a Jew.

176
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:54,851
They called me a Jew,
father Tommasso. - Lurco, please.

177
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,300
They called me a Jew.
- Please.

178
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:59,536
Please, just wait two days!

179
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,843
<i> I want to think</i>
<i> we've had a nice life.</i>

180
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:09,624
<i> I think I surround you</i>
<i> in a lifestyle</i>

181
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:12,569
<i> that is pleasant</i>
<i> and luxurious.</i>

182
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:14,741
Enjoy this pheasant.

183
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:18,412
Soon as Florence gets here,

184
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:23,113
we'll be eating chicken like
a bunch of fucking Croatians.

185
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:27,446
I sent another messenger
to Florence. Messenger came back.

186
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:29,802
He's dealing
with the guelph soldiers.

187
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,626
He's got Florence.
He's got Arezzo.

188
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:35,045
He doesn't have Pisa yet,
but he will,

189
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:38,949
and then he's coming for us.
So, I sent a messenger to Arezzo.

190
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:41,744
He's not in Arezzo.

191
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:43,276
He's in Pisa.

192
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:46,684
He's going...
He's making a play for Pisa!

193
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,687
He doesn't have
Pisa yet, but he will.

194
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:52,370
They're weak,
like the guelphs.

195
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:55,654
You know what comes
after Pisa? Lucca.

196
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,013
He's coming
for our silk trade.

197
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,710
So, my dear,

198
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:03,003
enjoy this lavish lifestyle,
your two dresses,

199
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:07,119
your pheasant, your lentils.
Live it up.

200
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:13,125
This... this Florentine
conspiracy thing, I got the point

201
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,205
he talks about it so much,
it's like a mental illness.

202
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,136
I'll be fake sleeping... - Mmm- hmm.
- ...and he's still going on about it.

203
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,983
"We're gonna lose everything."
- Mmm- hmm.

204
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,023
"you know what? I hope we do,
just so you'll shut up."

205
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:25,219
Just shut up.
- Mmm- hmm.

206
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,088
He thinks that everything
that happens is because of them.

207
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:30,601
He thinks on lot of things.

208
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,231
He's just... Just, it's not...
Even his tone is awful.

209
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:36,958
Yeah? You act like I don't suffer
through it, too. I'm right there with you.

210
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:41,173
That sounded like him.

211
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:44,256
Hmm? - That sounded like
him. - No, no, that's not him.

212
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:46,488
He's always asleep.
Just relax.

213
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:48,094
You're so cute.

214
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:51,284
I felt like... I felt I
heard the... - No, no.

215
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,549
All right, we're gonna
fuck again. That'll help you relax.

216
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:55,605
No! That is him.

217
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,390
No! That's... that is him.

218
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:04,255
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

219
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:08,273
What have you done?
- Oh, what have I done?

220
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,637
Oh, what's out there?
- Is it the guelphs?

221
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:13,862
Is it Florence? Are they
coming? - Go get 'em!

222
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:15,904
I shall deal with you shortly.

223
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:18,618
I'm petrified.

224
00:16:29,683 --> 00:16:32,651
Now I'll know who
you are in the morning.

225
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:33,819
We'll settle this in private.

226
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,893
I'll tell you
what happened, 100%.

227
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:16,402
A demon came in here while
we were sleeping and cut our hair.

228
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,392
There's no way to prove it's not a demon,
so... - Which means that it was a demon.

229
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,003
What else was it?
A warlock?

230
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,109
Good morning.

231
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:31,977
My liege.

232
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:49,830
You common-born dogs.

233
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:55,549
One of you sluts thinks
he's quite the Jester.

234
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,041
What the fuck
are you looking at?

235
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,396
I'll fuck you
where you breathe.

236
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:12,364
What was that all about, huh?

237
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:16,863
I saw guelph men
rush into town...

238
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:21,289
Savage beasts,
tearing men from limb to limb.

239
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:23,965
I saw a little boy's head
crushed between a...

240
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:27,225
A man's boot and...
And a stone.

241
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,274
His eyeballs
came skittering across.

242
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:35,458
I saw my beautiful
eight-year-old sister, Benicia,

243
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:39,909
cleaved in half with one
swipe of a sword by the guelphs.

244
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,145
She was more beautifully
developed as a woman than you are today.

245
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,391
You see this copper
in my hair?

246
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:51,807
She had the most beautiful
hair of this color all over her body.

247
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:55,289
Shut up. Stop talking.
On this table

248
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:57,415
no more eyeballs or squishing
and all that kind of stuff.

249
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,909
I don't want to hear about
any more violence at the table,

250
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:01,836
'cause I'm eating, and I'm
digesting, so stop it. - Silence!

251
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:04,602
How dare you?

252
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:06,698
You are weak.

253
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:10,573
I've begun to suspect you have
guelph blood coursing through your veins.

254
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:13,372
Oh, no. How
did you find out?

255
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,779
I will bring the devil's goad
to your bedchamber this evening,

256
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,137
and it will be
freshly polished. - No.

257
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,125
We're not doing that anymore.
You're not putting anything in there.

258
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:28,746
Nothing's coming out, nothing.
- We'll see about that.

259
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:30,299
I'm not doing that anymore.

260
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,325
I need a refill.
- Don't.

261
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:44,892
Oh.
- Please don't do this.

262
00:19:45,256 --> 00:19:47,045
I just need a quick
little refill. Come here.

263
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:49,510
You've been so sweet to me.
- Stop, stop. Somebody's gonna catch us!

264
00:19:49,946 --> 00:19:52,661
Look, look, you're gonna
get me fuckin' killed! - Uh- huh.

265
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,680
If someone catches me...

266
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:57,089
I don't want to hurt you!
I don't want to hurt you!

267
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:00,058
It's like, why are there
so many folds in here?

268
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:05,798
Shit. Oh, shit.

269
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:09,456
Bring me his goddamn balls.

270
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:12,369
Shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

271
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,589
God dang it! Your twigs
are all over the place.

272
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:23,267
Keeping up?
You keeping up?

273
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:24,850
Just go without me!
- Go without you?

274
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:25,918
I'll get there.

275
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:29,488
Masseto, let's talk about this!

276
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,323
Just stop! Stop!

277
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,595
Masseto, come on!

278
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:37,069
Masseto, come on!

279
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,781
No running!
- Masseto!

280
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:43,778
Masseto!

281
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:22,261
Oh, no!

282
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:34,747
Oh, no!

283
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,363
No.

284
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,212
Father?

285
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,764
You stay away! These are mine!

286
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:49,907
No, it just looks like you...
- You stay away! They're mine!

287
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:53,934
Hey, stop! Stop! I'm just trying to
help you! - If you're a bandit,I will strike you!

288
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,815
You can either lose all
of your stuff,

289
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:57,439
or you can trust me
and let me help you!

290
00:21:57,865 --> 00:22:01,861
I was entrusted to take care
of these things, and I've ruined this!

291
00:22:02,276 --> 00:22:06,603
The sisters made all these things,
and I've lost them in the water. - It's all right.

292
00:22:07,014 --> 00:22:09,288
And now I've fallen...
- It's all right. I'm gonna help.

293
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,126
Are you all right?

294
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:15,694
I'm drunk!

295
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:17,386
And I have fallen
with my cart,

296
00:22:17,774 --> 00:22:19,906
and this animal went
the wrong way.

297
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:22,036
All right, all right, all
right, all right, just stay down.

298
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:23,168
Stay down, please.

299
00:22:33,246 --> 00:22:34,596
There. That's it.
- All right.

300
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:40,393
I wish there was something
i could give you in repayment.

301
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:42,985
I have no money. Or wine...
- No, father, I don't need any money, or wine.

302
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:45,264
That's... that's totally fine.
Yeah.

303
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,163
Are you sure there's nothing
i can do to repay you?

304
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:52,074
I don't know. If you maybe
had a place for me to stay tonight,

305
00:22:52,615 --> 00:22:54,043
I would really appreciate it.
- You have nowhere to stay?

306
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:55,411
No.

307
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, you're coming with me.

308
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:00,499
It was a total disaster.

309
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,478
I never should have stopped to
speak to Lurco. That's what's held me up.

310
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:07,150
And then I was out at night.

311
00:23:07,948 --> 00:23:10,032
I had to drink the wine,
because I had no water.

312
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:13,476
And then I just didn't realize
how drunk I was getting,

313
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:16,122
and I've lost everything!
- I'm sorry, father.

314
00:23:17,101 --> 00:23:19,310
I wish there was more I could
have done. - How am I gonna explain?

315
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:22,988
No, no, it's all right.
You've done... You've done a lot.

316
00:23:28,254 --> 00:23:31,205
Right, here you are.
Fresh bread for you.

317
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:34,591
Oh, careful. Go...
Take it easy.

318
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,258
It's really, really good.

319
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:41,771
Good, good. I'm...
I'm sorry I was so...

320
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:46,492
Excited and upset before. I...

321
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,216
That's all right. That's...

322
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,395
Would you like some wine?

323
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:53,792
Bottom up. Up.

324
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,048
Up! Uh- uh...

325
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:00,528
I didn't touch it.

326
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,324
This has been wonderful.

327
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:08,944
Too wonderful.

328
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,423
The best blessing I have ever
experienced. - You saved me!

329
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:15,381
You saved me! Are you kidding?

330
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,404
I'm not kidding.

331
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:18,717
I didn't save you.

332
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:21,663
I couldn't put it... The wheel
of the donkey cart back on.

333
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,237
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

334
00:24:26,313 --> 00:24:29,081
It has been years,

335
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:32,033
many years
since my last confession.

336
00:24:32,828 --> 00:24:33,768
Hmm.
- Here are my sins.

337
00:24:34,236 --> 00:24:35,641
I have slept
with another man's wife.

338
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:39,604
He's a nobleman,
and he is my master.

339
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,442
Well, that's adultery.

340
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:44,531
I know.
- It's a very serious sin.

341
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:46,272
Sometimes...

342
00:24:47,478 --> 00:24:52,133
She would place her
mouth around my sex.

343
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:54,885
Well, that's sodomy.

344
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:57,916
It's also a serious sin.

345
00:24:58,376 --> 00:24:59,909
Is it also considered
sodomy if...

346
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:04,885
If I placed my mouth
on her sex while...

347
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:09,975
She simultaneously had...
Had her mouth around mine?

348
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:13,530
Why would you do that?

349
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,808
Because she... she liked it.

350
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:18,317
Oh.

351
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,010
Well, yes, that's also sodomy.

352
00:25:24,532 --> 00:25:27,224
I thought sodomy was...
Was just when I would...

353
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:31,743
When someone would
penetrate the rear... the rear end.

354
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,614
Yes, that's...
That's also sodomy.

355
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:40,701
That's the traditional
form of sodomy. - Right.

356
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:41,774
Did you do that?

357
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:45,237
I... I did. Yes, I...
That also occurred.

358
00:25:45,665 --> 00:25:47,623
But you didn't spill
your seed in the rear end?

359
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:49,026
No, no, I did not.

360
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:50,289
Good, good.

361
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:52,755
I would spill my seed
on her... um...

362
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:56,006
On her back or on her bosom.

363
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:59,830
But most of the time,
she would request

364
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:02,614
that I spill my seed
all over her face.

365
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:07,925
Well...

366
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:11,263
These are serious sins.

367
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:16,855
And do you regret doing these things?
- I've learned my lesson, I really have.

368
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,183
And I just... I don't want
to be that person anymore.

369
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:22,853
If I go back out on the road,
they will catch me, and they will kill me.

370
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:26,630
Well, I'll give you
your penance.

371
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,933
I want you to say
10 Hail Marys... - Yeah.

372
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:32,737
...and 15 our fathers.
- Yes.

373
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:34,637
Now, as to the other situation

374
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:37,979
about you being pursued,

375
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:42,399
I think I may have a solution

376
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:44,823
that can be a blessing
to both of us.

377
00:26:45,508 --> 00:26:46,870
Yes, thank you, father.
Thank you.

378
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,488
Good morning, Marea.
- Good morning.

379
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,775
Is it a good time?
- Yes.

380
00:26:55,777 --> 00:26:57,949
I'd like to introduce you
to someone. This is Masseto.

381
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,414
He's a deaf-mute.
- Oh.

382
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:03,458
I met him on my trip
and spoke to his family,

383
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,663
and they explained to me that he's
very good with gardening, light carpentry.

384
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:08,636
I think he could help us
repair the cloister

385
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:10,825
and do all of the things
that Lurco was doing.

386
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:12,605
And I thought the fact
that he's a deaf-mute,

387
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:15,124
there would be a lot less
conflicts with the sisters.

388
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:17,609
I can't believe you met
a deaf-mute on your trip.

389
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:19,793
How was your trip?
Did you sell any fabrics?

390
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:21,867
We should talk
about it in private.

391
00:27:22,512 --> 00:27:23,828
But you said
he was a deaf-mute.

392
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:26,235
Right. Um...

393
00:27:28,074 --> 00:27:30,652
I was robbed.
- Were you hurt?

394
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:35,232
No, no, I'm fine. I wasn't hurt,
but the bandits took everything.

395
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:38,231
They took all the embroidery,
all of the silk,

396
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:41,384
I've come back empty- handed.
I'm sorry.

397
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,513
What can I say?
I'm very embarrassed, but...

398
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:50,169
All right. Don't worry too
much about it. I'll get him started.

399
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:51,735
We go. We go.

400
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:40,212
Hi.

401
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:46,252
Who are you?

402
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:50,022
I'm sister Ginevra.

403
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,227
What are you doing?

404
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,416
You're digging a ditch?

405
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:01,797
You're digging a ditch.

406
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,617
All right.

407
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:18,021
<i> Since God is perfect,</i>

408
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,797
it's our job to live in
unison with his essence.

409
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:30,094
But sometimes it's difficult to find
that happiness and things don't go our way.

410
00:29:31,631 --> 00:29:33,987
And we feel like we're
being punished, and it's not...

411
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:39,686
Thank you, sister Fernanda.
Thank you. - Of course.

412
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:43,676
Um...

413
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:47,954
But God...
God is... is perfect.

414
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:51,613
Fernanda! That's enough!

415
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:54,353
What?
-  This is...

416
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:56,106
Viola, go inside
and finish your reading.

417
00:29:57,842 --> 00:29:59,943
Stop it! Stop that!

418
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:01,710
What are you doing?

419
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:04,033
I said stop that!
That is enough!

420
00:30:04,632 --> 00:30:06,958
What's gotten into you today?
- Nothing. I'm so sorry.

421
00:30:07,424 --> 00:30:10,624
You know what? I'll just go
scoop some dung or scrub the cellars...

422
00:30:10,963 --> 00:30:12,544
I don't know where
this is coming from!

423
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,750
...and not bother you
while you walk in...

424
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:29,692
Did he just smile at you?

425
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,442
I don't know. - Why is he
smiling? Who is that? Wait!

426
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:33,805
Who the fuck are you?

427
00:30:33,995 --> 00:30:35,694
Who are you?

428
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:37,843
Who are you?
- Fernanda, stop!

429
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:40,190
He's an intruder. I don't
know who the fuck he is!

430
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:42,270
Let me get mother Marea!
- Fine! Go!

431
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,968
Tell me who you are.

432
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:47,034
What? Say something!

433
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:49,730
Where did you come from?
What is that?

434
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:51,114
What are you doing
with your hands?

435
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,621
What? What, are you hungry?

436
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:56,044
What is that, a bird?
You're praying?

437
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:57,962
What the fuck are you
saying to me?

438
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,606
Fucking tell me who you are!

439
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:01,215
Don't chop his head off!

440
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:05,097
He's Masseto! He's a deaf-mute!
He works for us! Father Tommasso hired him.

441
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,536
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about it.

442
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:09,933
You're always complaining
about how Lurco talks to you,

443
00:31:10,297 --> 00:31:11,552
and Masseto doesn't talk.

444
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,798
So, I would really like you
to give him a chance.

445
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:16,629
Please!

446
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:19,096
All right.

447
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,452
And, sister, I need
to speak to you.

448
00:31:28,948 --> 00:31:30,961
You can get up now!

449
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:32,619
He can't hear you.

450
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,381
Why are you defending him?

451
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:38,520
Now!

452
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:42,617
Father Tommasso was attacked
by a group of bandits, and...

453
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:44,351
No.
- He...

454
00:31:45,465 --> 00:31:47,489
Well, all the embroidery
was stolen.

455
00:31:52,353 --> 00:31:55,613
So everything I've done,
everything I've worked on, is gone?

456
00:31:56,944 --> 00:32:00,309
Yes, I'm afraid
that's what happened.

457
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,853
Are you all right?

458
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:09,988
Yeah.

459
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,056
It's...

460
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:14,193
I know this is a lot to...

461
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:16,654
To swallow.

462
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:20,250
I'd be more than
happy to get you

463
00:32:20,935 --> 00:32:24,236
extra help for the work,
which will be doubled

464
00:32:24,872 --> 00:32:28,340
to make up for everything
that was lost.

465
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:54,960
Hello?

466
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:00,999
Hi.

467
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,503
Um, I broke this.

468
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:07,306
Can you...

469
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:09,041
Fix this, yes?

470
00:34:10,376 --> 00:34:13,029
You've... really kind eyes.

471
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,697
Sorry to just
spring this on you.

472
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:18,383
It's only 'cause they
just sprang it on me.

473
00:34:18,385 --> 00:34:20,498
You know, they just
asked me to double production

474
00:34:20,888 --> 00:34:22,155
of my embroidery
out of nowhere.

475
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:25,782
And I'm basically doing it alone. They
told me that they would give me help,

476
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,326
and then they just stuck me
with this...

477
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:31,130
This, like, shriveled up, old,
comatose woman.

478
00:34:31,465 --> 00:34:33,384
And, you know,
I look at her, and I just...

479
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:36,660
I see me. That's
what I'm gonna become.

480
00:34:37,037 --> 00:34:38,636
I'm just gonna
waste away here.

481
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:44,817
This is not what I
imagined for myself, you know.

482
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,476
What are you doing?

483
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,585
Why are you hiding in
the weeds like an animal?

484
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:53,452
I just saw sister Alessandra
go into the toolshed.

485
00:34:54,988 --> 00:34:57,415
But I know he is not saving up
money for merchant Ricardo.

486
00:34:57,491 --> 00:34:58,911
This is like...
It's not even his fault.

487
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:01,606
There's just no hope
anywhere in the world.

488
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,252
It's so sad and depressing.

489
00:35:04,498 --> 00:35:07,705
There's no hope for
any of us. Yes, look at you.

490
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:11,642
Look at you. You can't speak.
You can't hear. It's not fair!

491
00:35:11,981 --> 00:35:14,286
You're just stuck here
with all these bitches,

492
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,626
and so am I!

493
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:18,287
I just don't even
know what to do!

494
00:35:19,146 --> 00:35:20,533
It's so unfair.

495
00:35:28,254 --> 00:35:29,502
What the fuck
is she doing in there?

496
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,984
I have no idea.

497
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:37,249
Let us pray.

498
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:40,361
Lord, give our
bodies restful sleep

499
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:43,977
and let our work we have done
today be sown for an eternal harvest

500
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:46,229
through Christ, our Lord.

501
00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:47,768
Amen.

502
00:35:48,294 --> 00:35:51,686
Lord, Grant us a quiet night
and a perfect end. Amen.

503
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,399
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

504
00:35:58,585 --> 00:36:00,568
It has been three days
since my last confession.

505
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:04,800
And what is it
you would like to confess?

506
00:36:06,526 --> 00:36:09,464
Yesterday, I walked by the garden,
and I picked a turnip and I ate the whole thing,

507
00:36:09,596 --> 00:36:10,970
and I didn't share it
with my sisters.

508
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:15,300
Hmm,
and you regret this?

509
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:17,097
Yes, father.

510
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:21,565
Because it was greedy, wasn't it?
- It was, father. - Hmm.

511
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:25,981
Anything else?

512
00:36:26,312 --> 00:36:27,498
Yes, father.

513
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:32,316
I've been having
impure thoughts.

514
00:36:33,086 --> 00:36:34,076
Hmm.

515
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,570
And have you acted
on these thoughts?

516
00:36:37,223 --> 00:36:38,102
No, father.

517
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:42,741
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

518
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,140
It's been two days
since my last confession.

519
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,660
And what do you
wish to confess?

520
00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:50,320
The other day, I found
a turnip in the garden

521
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:52,537
and I ate it all by myself,

522
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:54,039
and I didn't share it
with my sisters.

523
00:36:54,538 --> 00:36:55,669
And it was so delicious...
-  Sister.

524
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:59,869
Ginevra just told me
the same story.

525
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,350
Did you overhear
her confession?

526
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:06,205
No.

527
00:37:08,654 --> 00:37:10,132
Fine.

528
00:37:11,392 --> 00:37:13,114
Do you have
anything else to confess?

529
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:15,660
No. I have
nothing else to confess.

530
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:17,305
Well, you missed lauds,
sister. That's something.

531
00:37:17,637 --> 00:37:20,505
Well, that's because the donkey
escaped in the woods, and I saved her.

532
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:21,903
You should be
thanking me, father.

533
00:37:22,403 --> 00:37:24,946
Look,
I'm just gonna...

534
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,942
I don't know what
to do here.

535
00:37:29,264 --> 00:37:31,396
If you don't confess,
God can't forgive you, so...

536
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:32,696
I have nothing
to confess. - All right.

537
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:34,283
Well, just go and think
about what you've done.

538
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:36,070
Let's try it again
next week. - Yes, father.

539
00:37:45,058 --> 00:37:46,173
First day.

540
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:48,631
First day. Thank you.

541
00:37:49,128 --> 00:37:50,164
You survived.

542
00:37:50,297 --> 00:37:53,640
Mmm- hmm.
- How is going on?

543
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:56,867
Yeah, no... All the work
itself, it went really smoothly.

544
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:58,550
And I did a lot of
great work in the cloister,

545
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:00,562
and that was good.

546
00:38:01,036 --> 00:38:04,697
And I met a few of the...
The sisters, and they were...

547
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:08,139
They were... they were,
you know, very interesting.

548
00:38:08,506 --> 00:38:10,836
And just grateful...
Grateful to be here, so...

549
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,829
These girls can be
tough. I'm not gonna lie.

550
00:38:15,447 --> 00:38:17,823
They can be very tough.
- Really? - And violent.

551
00:38:18,525 --> 00:38:19,442
Violence? I...

552
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,751
Wow, I just... I find
that so hard to believe.

553
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:24,248
They were...
They were so lovely.

554
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:27,296
They physically
have attacked people.

555
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:30,574
So, if anything
happens, just tell me.

556
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:34,100
Whatever it is, I can fix it,
but you have to tell me.

557
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:38,542
I mean, this deaf-mute thing
is there to protect you...

558
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,924
Exactly.

559
00:38:40,147 --> 00:38:42,189
...and to keep the
sisters away from you.

560
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:44,103
'Cause they can have
a pack mentality.

561
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:46,887
Ultimately, this is gonna be
a very positive influence.

562
00:38:47,254 --> 00:38:49,927
Living ethically every
day, serving God.

563
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:51,815
It's really gonna
fortify your soul.

564
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:54,494
Yeah, you're right.
I think I can learn a lot

565
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,410
by watching the sisters
and everyone around,

566
00:38:57,598 --> 00:39:00,512
who seem very ethical
and, yeah. - Cheers.

567
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:10,492
Actually, I was
gonna ask you, is it...

568
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,845
Is it all right that we keep
drinking the sacramental wine?

569
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,979
Well, I blessed it, so...

570
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,753
You blessed it, so it's...
- I mean,

571
00:39:21,755 --> 00:39:24,389
don't mention it
to anyone else, but...

572
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:27,320
How could I?
I'm deaf and mute, remember?

573
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:57,889
Hi.
- Hi.

574
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,163
You're not going
to bed, are you?

575
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:04,024
No.

576
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:06,408
Do you have anything to drink?

577
00:40:18,578 --> 00:40:19,698
What do you want?

578
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:22,544
Father Tommasso
left the ambry unlocked.

579
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:35,511
Hi. I'm Marta.

580
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,731
She's my childhood friend.

581
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:40,377
Yeah, yeah, childhood friend.
-  We grew up together.

582
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:44,306
Are you drunk?

583
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:46,586
No. And...

584
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,080
Then you should have more.

585
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:51,194
Your room's gorgeous.

586
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:52,836
Yeah.
My dad got it for me.

587
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,584
Why is it so big?
It's a lot bigger than your room.

588
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:57,019
Is it?

589
00:40:58,385 --> 00:40:59,524
I've never been in your room.

590
00:41:00,987 --> 00:41:01,975
Yes, you have.

591
00:41:02,788 --> 00:41:03,821
No.

592
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,073
Don't laugh.

593
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:15,695
What are you doing?

594
00:41:15,902 --> 00:41:19,114
I can't sleep! You're
too loud! - Get outta here!

595
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,127
Get the fuck in here!
- What are you doing here?

596
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,851
Shut the fuck up.
- What are you doing?

597
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:26,961
Who... who are you?

598
00:41:26,996 --> 00:41:29,136
Hi.
- That's Marta. - I'm Marta.

599
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,661
You have an accent. Where
are you from? The south?

600
00:41:31,785 --> 00:41:33,522
Oh, my God.
- Are you from Umbria?

601
00:41:33,654 --> 00:41:37,315
No. What's she talking about?
- I sound just like you. - No. She's from here.

602
00:41:37,605 --> 00:41:40,196
You're not from Gartagnana. -  Yes, she is.
You do not sound like you're from Gartagnana.

603
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:41,716
Are you drinking
the sacramental wine?

604
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:46,183
No. Father Tommasso drinks it all
the time. - I'm gonna tell mother Marea.

605
00:41:46,218 --> 00:41:48,392
Why are you always
telling on people?

606
00:41:48,427 --> 00:41:50,436
Yeah, shut up.
Just drink a little bit of it.

607
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:53,026
Sister Alessandra wants you
to drink. - Ginevra, it's fine.

608
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,989
Nothing matters in life.
We're all gonna die.

609
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:58,141
Terrible things are
happening all the time.

610
00:41:58,345 --> 00:41:59,616
You're not allowed
to have visitors here.

611
00:41:59,646 --> 00:42:02,347
You're not allowed... - Just enjoy
this moment... We're all gonna die.

612
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:03,748
And just drink a little wine.

613
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,774
But we're not gonna get
in trouble? - Do it. - Do it.

614
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:07,994
Whoo!

615
00:42:10,556 --> 00:42:14,062
Oh, that tastes bad.
That's bad.

616
00:42:14,794 --> 00:42:15,930
I think there was sand in it.

617
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,673
Is it true
that you've never...

618
00:42:54,968 --> 00:42:57,237
Been touched by a man,
or touched a man?

619
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:58,593
No.

620
00:42:59,772 --> 00:43:00,739
Never?

621
00:43:00,974 --> 00:43:05,025
I feel sad for you. Do you
ever wonder what it's like?

622
00:43:05,045 --> 00:43:06,819
Why? Is it really so great?

623
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,161
It's the greatest
pleasure on earth.

624
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:11,206
Really?
- Mmm.

625
00:43:12,151 --> 00:43:13,158
Mmm.

626
00:43:14,053 --> 00:43:17,011
Oh, my God,
you have no idea.

627
00:43:17,524 --> 00:43:19,642
In fact, it's so good
that I've heard of women

628
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:23,072
who make this potion
out of this plant belladonna

629
00:43:23,782 --> 00:43:24,880
just to seduce men.

630
00:43:28,325 --> 00:43:30,718
We can't do it,
'cause we would get locked up.

631
00:43:31,638 --> 00:43:34,109
Yeah, it's a mortal sin.
We wouldn't get into heaven.

632
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:35,510
It's a mortal sin.

633
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:37,374
Yeah, then you
probably shouldn't do it.

634
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:38,859
Probably shouldn't do it.

635
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:41,851
Doesn't really matter, anyway,
'cause we're never gonna know that.

636
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:44,994
Nothing matters.

637
00:43:48,888 --> 00:43:50,335
Are you really
from Gartagnana?

638
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:53,140
Yeah. I am.
- Mmm- hmm.

639
00:44:16,048 --> 00:44:17,599
Hi, little one.

640
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:21,284
I don't feel well.

641
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:24,719
I don't feel well. - Yeah, it's
'cause this is too tight. - No...

642
00:44:26,025 --> 00:44:26,932
Yeah, let's just...

643
00:44:27,227 --> 00:44:28,360
I should go. I should go.

644
00:44:28,995 --> 00:44:30,548
Okay. No, I'm sorry.

645
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:35,038
I'm sorry! But what is...

646
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,560
Oh, no, it's my room.

647
00:44:39,939 --> 00:44:41,886
This is my room.
- Yeah, it's your room.

648
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:49,677
I'm sorry. - It's okay.
- I'm sorry. I don't...

649
00:45:05,322 --> 00:45:07,279
Hi. Um...

650
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:11,736
Hi.

651
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:14,078
Hi.

652
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:17,189
I made this for you.

653
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,991
For you, yes.
Let me show you.

654
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,195
You can, um, sort of...

655
00:45:29,288 --> 00:45:30,847
It says thank you, just for...

656
00:45:32,025 --> 00:45:33,902
Just letting me talk
to you the other day.

657
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:35,330
I talk so crazy, I know.

658
00:45:35,962 --> 00:45:38,742
I mean, you know,
you can't, you know, hear me.

659
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:42,861
Do you need help?
Do you need help?

660
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:43,844
I just...

661
00:45:46,872 --> 00:45:49,468
Okay. Is that help for you?

662
00:45:50,677 --> 00:45:53,280
Yeah.
Is that how you do it?

663
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:55,931
Okay. Okay.

664
00:45:56,282 --> 00:45:57,703
Oh, I'm so dirty.

665
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:00,379
It's so warm.

666
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:04,164
It's so hot out here.

667
00:46:04,957 --> 00:46:06,224
Just have to...

668
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,097
Oh...

669
00:46:10,195 --> 00:46:11,342
That's better.

670
00:46:25,978 --> 00:46:27,011
Sorry.

671
00:46:32,051 --> 00:46:33,184
Sorry.

672
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,962
You're right. You're right.

673
00:47:00,245 --> 00:47:01,629
That's too fast.

674
00:47:02,648 --> 00:47:04,729
That's too fast.
We should stop.

675
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:07,676
Sorry.

676
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,615
Sorry. I'm sorry.

677
00:47:12,858 --> 00:47:13,725
Okay.

678
00:47:14,226 --> 00:47:15,219
Bye.

679
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:23,334
Glory to god in the highest,

680
00:47:23,336 --> 00:47:25,701
and on earth,
peace to people of good will.

681
00:47:27,172 --> 00:47:29,058
We praise you.
We bless you.

682
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:32,877
We adore you.
We glorify you.

683
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:35,548
We give you thanks for
your great glory, Lord God.

684
00:47:36,116 --> 00:47:38,361
Heavenly king, o God,
almighty father...

685
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:52,195
Last night was nice.

686
00:47:58,003 --> 00:47:59,568
Are you tired?
- Yeah.

687
00:48:01,206 --> 00:48:02,164
Yeah, me too.

688
00:48:03,776 --> 00:48:05,807
You feel okay?
- No, I don't feel good.

689
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,526
I hade fun. - I said I don't feel
good. Can you please stop talking?

690
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:13,425
Well, okay.

691
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:19,489
Hi, ladies.
- What are you doing here?

692
00:48:22,127 --> 00:48:24,627
Um, I was just
in the neighborhood.

693
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:26,889
What?
- I'm kidding.

694
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,768
No, my veil just got
a little dirty,

695
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:33,728
and I knew you girls
were here,

696
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,470
and I thought I'd come visit

697
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:37,929
and wash it with you guys.

698
00:48:38,011 --> 00:48:39,283
You're gonna wash
your own veil?

699
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:46,038
Yeah. Why not?
- You never wash anything.

700
00:48:48,287 --> 00:48:51,253
Wasn't last night so fun?
- How'd your veil get so dirty?

701
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:54,658
Um...

702
00:48:57,096 --> 00:48:58,939
Well, earlier I was
in the garden,

703
00:48:58,974 --> 00:49:01,226
and the new handyman
was there digging a ditch,

704
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:03,378
and I just thought
I'd help him out.

705
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,038
Digging a ditch? - It was
actually... It was really fun.

706
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,308
So, what do I do?

707
00:49:08,757 --> 00:49:11,048
Do I just dip it in the...
In the water?

708
00:49:11,311 --> 00:49:12,416
It's so... ooh, it's...

709
00:49:13,345 --> 00:49:14,775
It's really dirty over here.

710
00:49:15,808 --> 00:49:20,007
First you put it in the water, and then...
you bring it over to the bowl that has the ash.

711
00:49:20,371 --> 00:49:22,559
And you put it in the bowl,
and you put the ash on top of it,

712
00:49:23,082 --> 00:49:26,023
and then you let it sit for a day.
So then tomorrow, you would come back

713
00:49:26,348 --> 00:49:28,984
and take it out of the bowl, and
then you rinse it really well in the water...

714
00:49:29,308 --> 00:49:31,480
And then you wring it out,
and then you hang it up on the line.

715
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,290
Sounds like you are
really good at this...

716
00:49:35,368 --> 00:49:38,985
So, maybe I'll just...
I'll leave it here with you.

717
00:49:39,272 --> 00:49:41,372
This was great.

718
00:49:41,374 --> 00:49:44,299
Thank you. Bye,
you guys. - Bye.

719
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:48,074
Guess I would have ended
up washing this eventually.

720
00:49:53,152 --> 00:49:54,081
Here. Finish this.

721
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,105
I have to go
tidy up the cellar.

722
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:11,215
Here it is.

723
00:50:17,376 --> 00:50:19,083
Yeah, there should
be enough here.

724
00:50:26,218 --> 00:50:27,282
Sister Fernanda?

725
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:38,003
Just have to remember not to
get this in your mouth, okay?

726
00:50:38,832 --> 00:50:39,739
I know.

727
00:50:46,538 --> 00:50:48,180
Take off the nun thing.

728
00:50:48,975 --> 00:50:50,170
You'll get it all over it.

729
00:50:51,977 --> 00:50:53,376
Okay, you ready?
-  Yeah.

730
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,847
All right.

731
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:15,967
Go for it.

732
00:51:34,286 --> 00:51:36,587
Just going to...

733
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:39,624
Make you look a little more...

734
00:51:39,626 --> 00:51:41,634
Presentable.

735
00:51:44,296 --> 00:51:46,163
Do exactly
what I tell you to do.

736
00:52:03,649 --> 00:52:05,185
Make sure he sees your eyes.

737
00:52:07,953 --> 00:52:09,153
Okay, kiss him.

738
00:52:10,322 --> 00:52:11,689
Kiss him.

739
00:52:13,392 --> 00:52:14,659
Come on.

740
00:52:36,648 --> 00:52:40,151
Okay, get closer.
Careful with the knife.

741
00:52:42,087 --> 00:52:43,487
Take it all in.

742
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:52,029
Okay.

743
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,753
Get on top of him.

744
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:03,063
Push your sex
into his stomach.

745
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:43,447
All right.

746
00:53:46,618 --> 00:53:47,685
He'll do.

747
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:58,753
What were you
doing in there? - Hi.

748
00:54:00,232 --> 00:54:01,132
Where'd you come from?

749
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,736
I was just picking
root vegetables.

750
00:54:05,771 --> 00:54:07,341
Are you really
from Gartagnana?

751
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,881
Yes, I'm really
from Gartagnana.

752
00:54:10,343 --> 00:54:11,642
Why do you keep asking me?

753
00:54:11,644 --> 00:54:14,345
You've asked me, like, 25...
You are the most annoying!

754
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,550
Are you ignoring me?

755
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:21,409
No.

756
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:24,048
I feel like you're
ignoring me. - I'm not.

757
00:54:27,426 --> 00:54:28,485
Can I ask you a question?

758
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:30,585
Yes.

759
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:34,278
Did last night
mean anything to you?

760
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:36,807
No.

761
00:54:37,537 --> 00:54:39,721
We were just
drunk and having fun.

762
00:54:40,472 --> 00:54:41,492
Forget about it.

763
00:54:53,185 --> 00:54:54,385
All right.

764
00:54:54,387 --> 00:54:56,360
Masseto, Masseto, Masseto.

765
00:54:56,522 --> 00:54:57,917
I'm actually...

766
00:54:58,257 --> 00:54:59,347
I'm all right right now.

767
00:54:59,592 --> 00:55:00,891
Oh, all right.

768
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:02,293
Yeah.

769
00:55:02,295 --> 00:55:03,188
How's it going?

770
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:04,736
It was a good day.

771
00:55:05,098 --> 00:55:05,900
Yeah, I um...

772
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,440
I don't know. I can kind of...

773
00:55:08,768 --> 00:55:11,340
I can kind of picture myself
maybe being here a while.

774
00:55:11,504 --> 00:55:13,412
Really? You think
you could stay on?

775
00:55:13,673 --> 00:55:15,240
If you'd have me, yeah.

776
00:55:15,808 --> 00:55:16,642
Are you kidding?

777
00:55:17,477 --> 00:55:19,258
That would solve
a lot of problems.

778
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:21,753
And how's it going with
the sisters? That's all right?

779
00:55:22,448 --> 00:55:23,998
I think they're
kind of warming up to me.

780
00:55:24,517 --> 00:55:26,488
Good. Good, good.
Not too much?

781
00:55:26,786 --> 00:55:27,964
No. Definitely...

782
00:55:28,654 --> 00:55:29,553
Definitely not too much.

783
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:31,809
It's the right amount,
feels like.

784
00:55:32,225 --> 00:55:33,637
Anyway, let's have a toast,

785
00:55:34,427 --> 00:55:35,534
just a quick toast...

786
00:55:36,796 --> 00:55:39,986
And then maybe head over
to confession. Like we allways do.

787
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:42,623
I think I'm good tonight, just
'cause I'm gonna... Feeling a little tired.

788
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:44,362
It's been a long day.
- All right, yeah.

789
00:55:44,537 --> 00:55:46,213
It's bad luck to put it
back in the pitcher, though...

790
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:48,324
So, let's just
have this one, and then...

791
00:55:58,783 --> 00:56:00,284
Hello?

792
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,254
Are you alone?

793
00:56:03,256 --> 00:56:06,007
Of course. - I thought I heard someone.
- No, no, no. I was talking to myself.

794
00:56:06,926 --> 00:56:08,187
Let's take a little walk.

795
00:56:20,939 --> 00:56:25,565
Bishop Bartolomeo, hello.
- Father Tommasso.

796
00:56:25,993 --> 00:56:28,218
Ah, it's good to see you.
- Thank you. - Come in.

797
00:56:28,526 --> 00:56:29,810
Come in. Come in.
- Hello.

798
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,822
Here. Let me take this.
You must be exhausted.

799
00:56:31,857 --> 00:56:33,231
Very tired, very long trip.

800
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:35,419
So good to see you.
- So good to see you, too.

801
00:56:35,788 --> 00:56:36,926
Somewhat unexpected.

802
00:56:37,455 --> 00:56:38,201
Looks great.

803
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:42,808
We'll get it together for you.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure you will.

804
00:57:43,688 --> 00:57:44,941
Oh, shit!

805
00:58:13,385 --> 00:58:15,437
Knock- knock.
Are they not here?

806
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:17,554
They disappeared.
-  Oh.

807
00:58:17,556 --> 00:58:21,493
And you know Alessandra, Ilario's
daughter? - Ilario's daughter, of course.

808
00:58:21,528 --> 00:58:25,880
Hi. - His business is not doing very
well at the moment. - Oh, that's terrible.

809
00:58:25,915 --> 00:58:28,991
Sorry to say, yeah.
- Yeah. - I want one of those.

810
00:58:29,535 --> 00:58:31,698
We can get you one.
- Yes, it's yours. It's yours.

811
00:58:31,733 --> 00:58:34,324
Thank you, sister Alessandra.
-  Thank you. - I'll see you.

812
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:35,339
We appreciate your time.

813
00:58:35,688 --> 00:58:37,545
And we all
went out to the field

814
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,004
and worked on a single plot.

815
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:09,554
I see your point, but
I'd like you to focus here.

816
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:12,002
No, but I'm fine with March.

817
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:15,232
In February, how did you
sell textiles before they were sold?

818
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:17,579
I like what you're saying,
and if you...

819
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,302
No. But this is March.
I'm fine with March.

820
00:59:20,592 --> 00:59:22,536
Mother Marea, I need to talk
to you about sister Fernanda.

821
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:25,306
Is she all right? - Well,
she's acting very suspicious.

822
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:26,924
And I've learned some things
i think you'd want to know.

823
00:59:26,926 --> 00:59:28,371
You know how she's been saying
that the donkey escaped?

824
00:59:28,689 --> 00:59:31,555
It's not escaping.
- Okay, this is not the right time.

825
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:34,288
She's lying about it.
You'll want to know about it.

826
00:59:36,636 --> 00:59:39,875
I'm so sorry about that. - Have
you seen these numbers? Who...

827
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:41,716
I supervise in general...

828
00:59:42,735 --> 00:59:44,251
The numbers, but...

829
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,721
Sister, I'm asking, please keep
your voice down. - She wasn't there!

830
00:59:47,047 --> 00:59:49,409
She was clearly lying.
She had a friend over,

831
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:57,154
She's staying up! I hear her
up all night. - Don't talk so much...

832
01:00:00,503 --> 01:00:02,219
She's clearly lying about
the donkey escaping.

833
01:00:02,612 --> 01:00:05,889
I don't know why she's lying,
but I checked the walls,

834
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:10,409
I think that donkey needs
someone else to take care of her.

835
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:11,679
I can take care of her.

836
01:00:12,804 --> 01:00:14,400
I will consider it.

837
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,357
Thank you, mother.
- We'll discuss this later.

838
01:00:18,543 --> 01:00:20,181
Isn't that amazing, sisters?

839
01:00:20,713 --> 01:00:22,133
That rose had the ability

840
01:00:22,434 --> 01:00:26,133
to predict the exact day
of the death of Frederick II.

841
01:00:27,401 --> 01:00:30,691
I think we all have this
ability to connect deeply with God.

842
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,616
I share the story, because
we don't always listen to God.

843
01:01:23,715 --> 01:01:24,824
Hey!

844
01:01:26,177 --> 01:01:27,239
What's going on?

845
01:01:27,913 --> 01:01:29,124
You can speak?

846
01:01:31,115 --> 01:01:33,150
No, no. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

847
01:01:33,152 --> 01:01:34,800
I heard you. I heard you!

848
01:01:35,254 --> 01:01:39,425
Or I'm gonna tell everyone
here that you've been tricking us!

849
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:41,699
All right, all right,
all right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

850
01:01:41,727 --> 01:01:43,268
I'm not supposed to
talk to you.

851
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,042
You're not supposed to
talk to me?

852
01:01:45,097 --> 01:01:46,630
What does that even mean?

853
01:01:46,966 --> 01:01:48,927
Hello? Hello?

854
01:01:49,568 --> 01:01:51,201
Get down. Get down.
-  Can you hear me?

855
01:01:51,203 --> 01:01:53,570
Can you
hear me? Hello?

856
01:01:53,572 --> 01:01:55,706
No,
you can't hear me.

857
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:56,873
Can you hear my thoughts?

858
01:01:56,942 --> 01:01:58,876
'Cause I can
hear your thoughts.

859
01:01:58,878 --> 01:02:00,277
I can hear your thoughts.

860
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,080
Hi.

861
01:02:33,144 --> 01:02:34,272
This feels different.

862
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:36,707
I think I like sex with girls.

863
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:38,301
I never told anyone.

864
01:02:38,751 --> 01:02:40,762
I have lots
of secrets. I'm Jewish.

865
01:02:41,654 --> 01:02:43,024
Nobody knows,
but now you know.

866
01:02:43,155 --> 01:02:44,982
But you don't know,
'cause you can't...

867
01:02:45,558 --> 01:02:47,382
There's the angels.
Do you see the angels?

868
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:51,352
I see the...
Oh, I hear 'em. I hear 'em.

869
01:02:51,742 --> 01:02:53,862
Oh, they know. They know
I'm here. They know I'm here.

870
01:02:54,387 --> 01:02:55,941
Oh, God. Okay.

871
01:03:00,204 --> 01:03:01,101
What are you doing here?

872
01:03:01,807 --> 01:03:03,931
I'm just looking
through the hay. - Shh!

873
01:03:50,722 --> 01:03:52,333
Fernanda! What the
fuck is wrong with you?

874
01:03:52,368 --> 01:03:53,770
Why is there blood
all over your face?

875
01:03:54,193 --> 01:03:55,257
Get out of my way!

876
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:57,580
Fernanda? Fernanda?

877
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:04,034
Over there. Come on.
They have the donkey.

878
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:09,358
Oh, jeez.
Are you okay?

879
01:04:09,974 --> 01:04:10,845
Are you okay?

880
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:15,084
I'm gonna throw up.
- Okay, okay, okay. Let it out.

881
01:04:16,214 --> 01:04:17,944
I'm not gonna
throw up. - Okay, okay.

882
01:04:18,384 --> 01:04:20,016
Let's keep moving.
We're gonna keep going.

883
01:04:20,853 --> 01:04:22,751
Keep going.
- I'm so hot. Why am I so hot?

884
01:04:22,888 --> 01:04:24,711
I don't know.
-  Oh, I'm so thirsty.

885
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:25,793
Gotta keep going.

886
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:42,956
What is the lights?
Look at the lights.

887
01:04:48,781 --> 01:04:50,881
What is it...

888
01:04:50,883 --> 01:04:53,449
I took the belladonna.
I took the belladonna. - What?

889
01:04:53,919 --> 01:04:56,522
She had it. She had the sex,
and so I was gonna have the sex.

890
01:04:56,863 --> 01:04:59,856
So I did belladonna
so I could have the sex...

891
01:05:22,313 --> 01:05:23,880
Witches.

892
01:05:24,415 --> 01:05:25,907
They're witches!

893
01:05:27,051 --> 01:05:28,481
He's making a lot of noise.

894
01:05:28,516 --> 01:05:31,121
It's okay. He's a deaf-mute.
- Yeah, well, maybe we should gag him.

895
01:05:31,156 --> 01:05:32,383
There's no point.
He can't talk.

896
01:05:33,991 --> 01:05:35,058
Shut up.

897
01:05:43,835 --> 01:05:45,402
Ginevra, no.

898
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:47,738
Ginevra, come back here.

899
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:49,740
Ginevra, get back here!

900
01:05:52,343 --> 01:05:53,744
Stop!

901
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:22,239
For so it was placed
when the goddess embraced.

902
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:25,008
The horned Lord, our God
who taught her the word.

903
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:27,268
Which quickened the
womb and conquered the tomb.

904
01:06:38,156 --> 01:06:40,899
Lance to grail,
spirit to flesh,

905
01:06:41,326 --> 01:06:42,637
sun to moon.

906
01:06:42,995 --> 01:06:44,393
Forever your flame
is the male.

907
01:06:44,428 --> 01:06:46,997
Don't fucking kill me.
No, don't, please.

908
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:50,258
We cured him.
- There's absolutely no way.

909
01:06:50,597 --> 01:06:53,154
You know nothing.
This is a fertility ritual.

910
01:06:53,463 --> 01:06:56,028
It'll be great
if you just listen next time.

911
01:06:58,142 --> 01:06:58,935
Okay.

912
01:07:11,222 --> 01:07:12,385
What are you
all looking at?

913
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:15,930
Why are you
looking at me?

914
01:07:16,428 --> 01:07:17,882
What is she doing here?

915
01:07:18,063 --> 01:07:20,036
What?

916
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:33,088
Ginevra!

917
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,215
Calm down.
Put the totem down!

918
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:38,239
You do not belong here!

919
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:40,799
Give it to me.
- You don't belong here!

920
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:47,062
No, no.
- You don't belong!

921
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,770
Spirit to flesh,
sun to moon.

922
01:07:51,463 --> 01:07:52,486
Quiet.

923
01:07:52,564 --> 01:07:54,932
Fernanda! Stop this!

924
01:07:55,434 --> 01:07:56,831
God, what are you doing here?

925
01:07:56,866 --> 01:07:59,474
Stop it, Alessandra!
I need to have sex with him!

926
01:08:00,938 --> 01:08:04,093
Why are you...
Why are you even here?

927
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,310
You don't know
the powers of...

928
01:08:16,828 --> 01:08:18,824
You're a witch? This is crazy!

929
01:08:19,024 --> 01:08:20,729
And you were lying
to us this whole time?

930
01:08:20,926 --> 01:08:22,919
Yes, explain yourself!
- All right, all right, all right.

931
01:08:23,657 --> 01:08:26,539
These people, they want
to kill me, and I went on the run...

932
01:08:26,632 --> 01:08:27,918
This is my donkey!

933
01:08:27,966 --> 01:08:30,803
We have to get her.
-  She's out of control.

934
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,393
All right, let's... - Enough
with the knife already.

935
01:08:57,695 --> 01:08:59,214
That fucking bitch.

936
01:09:05,002 --> 01:09:07,742
You need to know
what's going on!

937
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:09,597
You need to know!

938
01:09:18,549 --> 01:09:19,652
Wake up!

939
01:09:20,285 --> 01:09:23,017
Wake up! Wake up!

940
01:09:24,722 --> 01:09:26,059
You need to know
what's going on!

941
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:31,464
What are you doing? It's the
middle of the night! - They're witches!

942
01:09:32,164 --> 01:09:33,280
They're witches!

943
01:09:33,742 --> 01:09:35,165
You need to know
about the witches!

944
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:38,096
Put your clothes on. - Fernanda's
a witch, her friend's a witch!

945
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,408
Calm down! - They're all out there! Father
Bartolomeo, you need to know. There are witches...

946
01:09:41,673 --> 01:09:43,536
She's a witch!
She is a witch!

947
01:09:43,915 --> 01:09:45,319
I am not a witch!
-  Stop!

948
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:47,253
You're just jealous.
- No, I am not!

949
01:09:47,346 --> 01:09:48,519
Why are you wearing
your winter habit?

950
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:49,970
I saw him first.
- Why is the handyman here?

951
01:09:50,296 --> 01:09:52,478
What do you mean, you saw him
first? You don't even like men!

952
01:09:52,513 --> 01:09:55,581
You're sexually attracted to
women. - I am sexually attracted to men.

953
01:09:55,616 --> 01:09:56,978
What?
- I had sex with him!

954
01:09:57,271 --> 01:09:59,022
You are a bride of Christ!
- You did not have sex with him.

955
01:09:59,024 --> 01:10:00,123
You were just
writhing around on him.

956
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:04,964
How dare you? Bishop, I did
not have sex. - I'm telling the truth.

957
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:07,120
I know what you're doing
and she's my donkey now!

958
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,285
Don't talk about my donkey.

959
01:10:08,739 --> 01:10:10,421
I am on donkey duty now!
- What is wrong with her?

960
01:10:10,469 --> 01:10:11,821
She is on drugs!

961
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:13,855
She told me
she took belladonna tonight,

962
01:10:14,227 --> 01:10:17,310
and she's been dancing around
naked in the woods with witches.

963
01:10:17,609 --> 01:10:19,251
And she's a Jew!

964
01:10:23,614 --> 01:10:26,408
I am not a Jew!
- Sister Marea!

965
01:10:27,419 --> 01:10:28,379
Stop talking.

966
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:31,252
I am not a Jew! - Yes!
Stop. Stop. Sister Marea!

967
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,584
Sister Marea! Wake up!

968
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:35,192
I'm not a Jew.
I'm not a Jew.

969
01:10:36,061 --> 01:10:38,206
Come out here.
Look at this. - I was sleeping!

970
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,208
Complete chaos!
- I'm sorry.

971
01:10:40,232 --> 01:10:41,875
Everyone's awake.
- What's on your face?

972
01:10:42,034 --> 01:10:43,640
It's the middle of the night.
There's a donkey downstairs.

973
01:10:44,068 --> 01:10:45,438
Why do you have
pants on your head?

974
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,260
Okay, just please stop!

975
01:10:47,561 --> 01:10:50,060
I can explain everything,
all right? It's all my fault.

976
01:10:50,142 --> 01:10:51,207
I thought you couldn't speak!

977
01:10:51,209 --> 01:10:54,106
Yeah, he can talk. - I thought
you were a deaf-mute!

978
01:10:57,148 --> 01:10:58,186
It's a miracle.

979
01:11:04,321 --> 01:11:05,787
We're going to
begin the tribunal.

980
01:11:23,855 --> 01:11:25,900
Sister Ginevra,
these are your sins.

981
01:11:26,568 --> 01:11:27,706
Ingestion of drugs,

982
01:11:27,813 --> 01:11:28,938
lying with a woman,

983
01:11:29,714 --> 01:11:31,452
not being baptized.

984
01:11:31,749 --> 01:11:33,339
Not being baptized?

985
01:11:33,585 --> 01:11:35,214
That's what
makes you what you are.

986
01:11:36,288 --> 01:11:38,484
You can't... you shouldn't even
be coming through those doors!

987
01:11:40,148 --> 01:11:42,553
Being a busybody,
filthy conversation...

988
01:11:43,698 --> 01:11:46,017
Vain jangling, drinking...

989
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:47,761
Eating blood.

990
01:11:52,537 --> 01:11:55,027
Do you think I've ever written
down "eating blood" before?

991
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:56,951
Where am I?

992
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:01,298
Envy, fornication,
homosexuality...

993
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:04,275
That's the same as lying with
a woman, but we separate those.

994
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:08,504
Lustfulness, reveling,
mischief in your heart.

995
01:12:10,688 --> 01:12:14,024
That's the longest list
I've ever had... for sins.

996
01:12:14,225 --> 01:12:16,183
Please have mercy on me.

997
01:12:16,228 --> 01:12:17,529
For your punishment,

998
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:19,766
I'm going to have you
fast for one year.

999
01:12:19,865 --> 01:12:24,391
Okay. - I didn't explain it
yet, so it's not okay. - Okay.

1000
01:12:24,426 --> 01:12:26,653
Because a human being
can't live on not eating.

1001
01:12:26,672 --> 01:12:29,063
No. - I don't mean you're
not gonna eat for a whole year.

1002
01:12:29,098 --> 01:12:31,155
You just pick a meal
in the day

1003
01:12:31,577 --> 01:12:33,766
and skip it.
- Okay.

1004
01:12:33,946 --> 01:12:36,889
So, say, it's lunch. Every day,
you've got to skip lunch.

1005
01:12:36,924 --> 01:12:38,897
Yes.
- And what meal is that?

1006
01:12:39,117 --> 01:12:40,386
Uh...

1007
01:12:40,853 --> 01:12:44,224
Based on your
suggestion, I'll skip lunch.

1008
01:12:46,124 --> 01:12:48,025
It's not my suggestion.

1009
01:12:48,027 --> 01:12:50,728
You have to feel the sin.
- I can feel lunch.

1010
01:12:51,195 --> 01:12:52,828
Sister Alessandra.

1011
01:12:53,197 --> 01:12:54,337
You know...

1012
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,750
I'm friends with your father,

1013
01:12:56,785 --> 01:12:58,666
and now his daughter
is doing this?

1014
01:12:58,671 --> 01:13:02,283
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. - It's embarrassing.

1015
01:13:03,809 --> 01:13:05,861
For me, I'm embarrassed.

1016
01:13:06,286 --> 01:13:07,661
How do you think he's
gonna feel when he knows this?

1017
01:13:07,696 --> 01:13:10,577
There's no need to tell my father.
- He's a patron of the church,

1018
01:13:10,983 --> 01:13:12,246
one of the biggest.

1019
01:13:14,118 --> 01:13:17,105
And this place is completely
in disrepair. It's falling apart.

1020
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,873
It looks like a barn
in filicaia.

1021
01:13:20,725 --> 01:13:21,950
Have you been there?

1022
01:13:22,628 --> 01:13:24,060
It's disgusting.
- It's disgusting!

1023
01:13:24,129 --> 01:13:26,096
Please, please don't say that.

1024
01:13:26,098 --> 01:13:29,558
I think I want to call this place
little filicaia. - No, please. -  I might.

1025
01:13:29,593 --> 01:13:32,226
Sister Fernanda,
these are your sins.

1026
01:13:32,604 --> 01:13:34,135
Apostasy,

1027
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,387
heresy,

1028
01:13:35,841 --> 01:13:38,311
abusive language... - It's
just the tone of my voice.

1029
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:39,651
Homosexuality...

1030
01:13:40,745 --> 01:13:43,559
Revelings, witchcraft.

1031
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:46,974
Did you roll
your eyes? - No.

1032
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:50,231
You were rolling your eyes.

1033
01:13:51,889 --> 01:13:54,114
Sister Marea,
i don't know what to say.

1034
01:13:54,226 --> 01:13:55,933
I am shocked.

1035
01:13:56,195 --> 01:13:58,829
Fornication?
Living in pleasure?

1036
01:13:58,831 --> 01:14:01,665
You, sister Marea, you.

1037
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,293
Loving the world?

1038
01:14:03,402 --> 01:14:04,875
Why don't
you just stay here?

1039
01:14:05,037 --> 01:14:08,062
Why don't you stay in this
world that you love so much?

1040
01:14:08,097 --> 01:14:09,074
Isn't it fun?

1041
01:14:10,308 --> 01:14:11,841
Do you have
anything to say?

1042
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:14,724
I'm so sorry, your holiness.

1043
01:14:14,946 --> 01:14:16,248
Do you care?

1044
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:22,620
It's just complete lack of...
Are you guys smiling at each other?

1045
01:14:22,987 --> 01:14:25,649
Can you have a moment
to not look at each other?

1046
01:14:25,684 --> 01:14:27,405
You're both out of control.

1047
01:14:28,426 --> 01:14:29,889
Father Tommasso...

1048
01:14:30,996 --> 01:14:32,660
I don't even know
where to begin.

1049
01:14:34,298 --> 01:14:36,125
I ask your forgiveness...

1050
01:14:37,402 --> 01:14:39,248
And I ask God's forgiveness

1051
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:42,548
for failing as the
Shepherd of this flock.

1052
01:14:42,741 --> 01:14:47,505
I only ask that you please not punish
the sisters of this convent for my failings.

1053
01:14:53,084 --> 01:14:54,804
Marea.

1054
01:14:57,021 --> 01:14:58,440
I'm so sorry.

1055
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:02,272
He's taken
away my priesthood.

1056
01:15:03,361 --> 01:15:06,293
I have to go to San
Biagio and become a monk.

1057
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:09,267
I'm so sorry
for dragging you into this.

1058
01:15:09,302 --> 01:15:11,277
You're a good woman.
You're a good woman, Marea.

1059
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:13,962
I should... - What the
hell are you doing?

1060
01:15:15,206 --> 01:15:16,449
Get outta here!

1061
01:15:17,109 --> 01:15:18,851
You were just
crying in there?

1062
01:15:20,211 --> 01:15:21,551
What's wrong with you?

1063
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:24,735
Was lying
with Francesca worth it?

1064
01:15:24,783 --> 01:15:26,667
I really don't
want to talk about it.

1065
01:15:26,702 --> 01:15:28,961
What about that bosom?
Very ample.

1066
01:15:28,996 --> 01:15:31,901
Super ample,
plus it's Bruno's wife,

1067
01:15:31,936 --> 01:15:33,625
so it had to be so intense.

1068
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,486
Can you guys
please stop talking?

1069
01:15:35,521 --> 01:15:36,906
You heard what
happened to her, right?

1070
01:15:36,941 --> 01:15:38,725
No.
How could I have heard?

1071
01:15:45,737 --> 01:15:47,500
"At the end
of the cold season,

1072
01:15:47,873 --> 01:15:49,786
"when along the branch

1073
01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:53,257
"surges the sap that revives
the broom and Heather.

1074
01:15:53,979 --> 01:15:57,077
"When the peach trees blossom
and the frog sings in the pool

1075
01:15:57,816 --> 01:16:00,076
<i> "and the Willow</i>
<i> and elder grow,</i>

1076
01:16:00,119 --> 01:16:02,311
<i>"as I see the
dry months come,</i>

1077
01:16:02,988 --> 01:16:05,469
<i> "i concern myself</i>
<i> with a large orchard</i>

1078
01:16:05,504 --> 01:16:07,785
<i> "where there are beautiful</i>
<i> saplings in many places.</i>

1079
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,077
<i> "The grafts are large,</i>
<i> and the fruit fleshy</i>

1080
01:16:12,331 --> 01:16:14,637
<i> "on those that should</i>
<i> be the worst.</i>

1081
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,769
<i> "And the blossoms</i>
<i> look like those of apples."</i>

1082
01:16:18,903 --> 01:16:20,766
<i> "But when the fruit comes,</i>

1083
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,442
<i> "it is nothing but</i>
<i> Willow and elder.</i>

1084
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:29,173
<i>"And since the head is empty,</i>
<i> the members at the ends are in pain."</i>

1085
01:16:45,096 --> 01:16:46,802
Did you finish
cleaning the cellar?

1086
01:16:47,099 --> 01:16:48,819
Yeah, all done.

1087
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:51,584
Isn't it so annoying?

1088
01:16:51,619 --> 01:16:53,642
So annoying.
- I told you.

1089
01:16:54,972 --> 01:16:56,039
I know.

1090
01:17:03,915 --> 01:17:05,612
Sorry I told on you.

1091
01:17:06,584 --> 01:17:09,956
Sorry that I told mother
Marea every time I thought

1092
01:17:10,155 --> 01:17:12,777
something wasn't
right or weird.

1093
01:17:14,559 --> 01:17:16,822
Sorry I ruined your ritual.

1094
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:21,279
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you I was a witch.

1095
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:24,549
But honestly,

1096
01:17:25,337 --> 01:17:28,372
I thought eventually I could
turn you all into witches,

1097
01:17:28,407 --> 01:17:31,092
and you'd join my coven,
but I know that sounds stupid.

1098
01:17:31,877 --> 01:17:33,752
You really think
i could be a witch?

1099
01:17:36,414 --> 01:17:37,564
Yeah.

1100
01:17:45,389 --> 01:17:47,289
Do you think
they're gonna kill him?

1101
01:17:53,297 --> 01:17:55,965
I don't know what's
going on with Giovanni lately.

1102
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,804
Have you noticed the carrots
they're serving the soldiers are mushier?

1103
01:17:58,839 --> 01:18:00,762
I was saying
the same thing yesterday.

1104
01:18:00,797 --> 01:18:03,147
I would even be okay if
they were mushy on the outside

1105
01:18:03,182 --> 01:18:05,709
and crispy on the inside.
I don't need, like, a full crisp, but...

1106
01:18:05,744 --> 01:18:06,675
It could be a little mushy.

1107
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:08,445
I'm fine with a little mush.
'Cause this is basically carrot pudding.

1108
01:18:08,447 --> 01:18:09,697
Where is he?

1109
01:18:20,258 --> 01:18:22,062
Welcome back.

1110
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:29,105
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting. I've been in Sarzana

1111
01:18:29,468 --> 01:18:32,145
meeting with the
family of my new bride.

1112
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:37,445
Beautiful young lady who seems
like she might be up to fidelity.

1113
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,579
Imagine that.

1114
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:41,280
Once she hits puberty.

1115
01:18:42,347 --> 01:18:46,492
I have to thank you for
doing me an incredible favor.

1116
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:51,724
My wife, who had hidden her
guelph ancestry, turned out to be

1117
01:18:52,157 --> 01:18:54,459
quite the barren twat.

1118
01:18:54,494 --> 01:18:56,026
And you've given me
every reason

1119
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:58,635
to seal her up in a wall
with a boar and a dog.

1120
01:19:00,398 --> 01:19:02,288
I've got some good news

1121
01:19:02,567 --> 01:19:04,473
and some bad news.

1122
01:19:04,508 --> 01:19:06,109
Which would you like first?

1123
01:19:06,144 --> 01:19:11,121
The good news is I'm going to
keep you alive for as long as I can.

1124
01:19:12,543 --> 01:19:15,126
It sounds cheery.
The bad news is

1125
01:19:15,161 --> 01:19:17,980
it's only so that
i can inflict as much pain

1126
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:20,912
and degradation
as I torture your flesh.

1127
01:19:21,219 --> 01:19:23,395
I'm having
a hard time determining

1128
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:26,095
which of my favorite
torture methods

1129
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,677
to start with upon you.

1130
01:19:27,712 --> 01:19:31,032
Got the thumbscrew.
I have a Catherine wheel.

1131
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:32,812
I have a rack out back.

1132
01:19:32,847 --> 01:19:34,464
It was taking up
too much space in here,

1133
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:36,888
but still fully functional.

1134
01:19:36,923 --> 01:19:40,535
There's a new one called
the rat box just in from Sicily.

1135
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:42,973
The rat box,
not to be confused with

1136
01:19:42,975 --> 01:19:45,173
what I call
my wife's private area

1137
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,894
after you'd been to visit.

1138
01:19:47,411 --> 01:19:49,963
It's a box of rats
with one open side

1139
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:51,488
placed against your abdomen.

1140
01:19:51,523 --> 01:19:53,964
I light a fire on
the other side of the box,

1141
01:19:54,286 --> 01:19:56,880
so that the rats,
in their attempts to escape,

1142
01:19:56,915 --> 01:19:59,236
burrow through your guts.

1143
01:19:59,358 --> 01:20:02,361
Anyway, we'll have
a lot of fun together

1144
01:20:02,396 --> 01:20:04,283
in the coming days
and maybe weeks,

1145
01:20:04,997 --> 01:20:06,862
depending on
how tough you are.

1146
01:20:09,266 --> 01:20:10,850
Don't go anywhere.

1147
01:20:15,506 --> 01:20:17,159
Shit.

1148
01:20:22,446 --> 01:20:25,621
There was no good
news in that at all.

1149
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:29,259
Hey, um... I'd actually...

1150
01:20:29,287 --> 01:20:31,843
I'd really appreciate it if
you guys let me out now. - Oh.

1151
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:33,582
Can't do that to us.

1152
01:20:33,617 --> 01:20:35,467
Please.
- It's a tough position.

1153
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:37,743
Hey, hey,
we're friends, all right?

1154
01:20:37,778 --> 01:20:38,815
You don't want
to be here either.

1155
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:40,617
Just let me out.
We'll make a run for it.

1156
01:20:40,652 --> 01:20:41,589
I...
- We can't.

1157
01:20:42,534 --> 01:20:44,415
He can't make a run
for anything.

1158
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:46,500
If I die, that's
on your conscience.

1159
01:20:46,671 --> 01:20:49,453
You don't want to
live with that. Please.

1160
01:20:49,508 --> 01:20:50,774
What... is...

1161
01:20:50,776 --> 01:20:53,676
Okay. You're gonna have
to move quick,

1162
01:20:53,678 --> 01:20:55,632
especially around the moat.

1163
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:57,835
The guards out there
have a real thirst for blood.

1164
01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:59,815
Yes, of course.
Thank you so much.

1165
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:01,597
Okay, here I go.
- Okay.

1166
01:21:01,632 --> 01:21:03,226
I'm unlocking you.

1167
01:21:05,123 --> 01:21:06,823
What are you...

1168
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:09,760
There's a turtle with
a candle on it! - Really?

1169
01:21:10,262 --> 01:21:11,628
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't leave me!

1170
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:13,296
Hey, where are you
going? Don't leave me!

1171
01:21:13,298 --> 01:21:17,427
Come on! Just please.
Stop, you shits!

1172
01:21:17,536 --> 01:21:19,873
Let's see what
he does. - Shit.

1173
01:21:36,353 --> 01:21:40,223
What are you doing here?
- We're getting you out. Hi.

1174
01:21:44,628 --> 01:21:45,695
Come on!

1175
01:21:48,332 --> 01:21:49,833
Come on. Come on.

1176
01:21:49,835 --> 01:21:52,202
Whoa, whoa. Come on!

1177
01:21:52,204 --> 01:21:54,490
No, no, it's okay.
I'm giving it to you.

1178
01:21:54,525 --> 01:21:55,583
You can trust us.

1179
01:21:56,174 --> 01:21:58,145
We're rescuing you!

1180
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,262
I embroidered this doll
to put in your place.

1181
01:22:00,545 --> 01:22:02,924
We brought you a lunar
habit to hide you in the night.

1182
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:04,414
We want to bring
you back to the convent.

1183
01:22:08,252 --> 01:22:09,786
All right.

1184
01:22:09,788 --> 01:22:11,020
All right, let's go.

1185
01:22:11,123 --> 01:22:12,803
I'm gonna need that back.

1186
01:22:12,838 --> 01:22:13,623
Put on the habit.
Key. Oh, key!

1187
01:22:20,664 --> 01:22:22,398
Okay. All right.

1188
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:26,188
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1189
01:22:31,609 --> 01:22:33,864
You think this has something
to do with our hair being cut?

1190
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:39,101
You think we should
tell Bruno about that?

1191
01:22:39,136 --> 01:22:42,397
He's got his hands full with
the wife in the wall and everything.

1192
01:22:42,854 --> 01:22:44,838
We just saw
the wildest thing.

1193
01:22:45,496 --> 01:22:46,908
You would not believe it.

1194
01:22:47,692 --> 01:22:49,620
Well, it was a turtle...

1195
01:22:55,766 --> 01:22:56,833
Come on.

1196
01:23:30,868 --> 01:23:34,631
Hello.
- Tommasso.

1197
01:23:35,272 --> 01:23:37,095
How are things
at the convent?

1198
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:40,748
It's lonely.

1199
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,199
That monastery is so boring.

1200
01:23:48,385 --> 01:23:50,283
All we do is pray.

1201
01:23:51,289 --> 01:23:53,313
I mean, it's important, but...

1202
01:23:54,658 --> 01:23:56,461
It's all men.

1203
01:23:57,494 --> 01:23:59,848
It's so good
to see your face.

1204
01:24:08,305 --> 01:24:09,987
Someone's coming.

1205
01:24:17,581 --> 01:24:19,273
Come on!

1206
01:24:21,385 --> 01:24:22,602
Come on.

1207
01:24:33,697 --> 01:24:35,700
They're gone.

1208
01:24:48,279 --> 01:24:49,800
All right, come on.
