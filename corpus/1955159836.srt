ANYTHING BAD TO HAPPEN.

1211
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,700
SO YOU JUST WANTED
TO MAKE US LOOK STUPID

1212
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,170
FOR YOUR OWN SICK,
TWISTED PLEASURE?

1213
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:15,639
BUT NOT FOR ANYTHING BAD.

1214
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:19,540
Claire: COME ON, GUYS.

1215
01:08:19,612 --> 01:08:22,182
HEY, AND THAT
WAS PRETTY FUNNY
WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT--

1216
01:08:35,928 --> 01:08:37,628
HEY!

1217
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:40,126
WHAT ARE YOU READING?

1218
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,399
BREAKAWAY.

1219
01:08:41,467 --> 01:08:44,397
I'M IMMERSING MYSELF
IN FICTIONAL CHARACTERS.

1220
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:46,640
THEY CAN'T GET MAD AT YOU.

1221
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:47,935
I LOVE BREAKAWAY.

1222
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:50,677
OOH, IS THAT THE ONE
WHERE ZORON GOES
TO MARS,

1223
01:08:50,743 --> 01:08:53,283
AND SAVES QUEEN SCHLOFF
AND THE ARGOLINKS?

1224
01:08:53,345 --> 01:08:55,205
NO, THAT'S FEBRUARY.

1225
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:58,151
THIS IS THE ONE WHERE
ZORON FINDS, UH,
SUBATOMIC PARTICLES

1226
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:02,117
AND HOW THEY'RE CONNECTED
TO A MYSTERIOUS QUANTUM FORCE.

1227
01:09:02,188 --> 01:09:04,418
OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW,
THAT'S AN OLD ONE.

1228
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:05,720
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

1229
01:09:05,791 --> 01:09:07,291
THAT'S ACTUALLY BASED ON
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED.

1230
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,929
IT WAS, UH, GENEVA, 1997.

1231
01:09:09,995 --> 01:09:13,625
SWISS SCIENTISTS WERE
ABLE TO SPLIT A PHOTON,

1232
01:09:13,699 --> 01:09:17,239
AND EVEN THOUGH THE PARTICLES
ARE 6 MILES APART,

1233
01:09:17,303 --> 01:09:20,213
WHATEVER ONE DOES,
THE OTHER ONE DOES

1234
01:09:20,272 --> 01:09:23,712
EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

1235
01:09:23,776 --> 01:09:25,406
COOL!

1236
01:09:27,213 --> 01:09:29,513
YOU KNOW, IF WE SPLIT
OUR GRAVITON,

1237
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,982
WE COULD STUDY
ITS QUANTUM FORCE,

1238
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:34,790
AND MAYBE UNLOCK
THE SECRET AS TO HOW
IT WORKS.

1239
01:09:34,854 --> 01:09:37,194
AND THEN...

1240
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:40,526
Krickstein and Charlie:
DEFY GRAVITY.

1241
01:09:41,994 --> 01:09:42,994
LET'S GET TO WORK.

1242
01:09:46,332 --> 01:09:47,972
2-7, 3-7...

1243
01:09:48,033 --> 01:09:49,773
AND THE OUTPUT
LEVEL IS 999.

1244
01:09:49,835 --> 01:09:51,935
OK.

1245
01:09:52,004 --> 01:09:55,614
NOW THIS CHIP HAS
33 ANTIGRAVITY HALVES.

1246
01:09:55,674 --> 01:09:58,044
AND YOURS
HAS THE PROTOTYPES.

1247
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,080
WHY THE RUBBER COATING?

1248
01:09:59,145 --> 01:10:00,275
THEY ALL ACT LIKE
SUPERBALLS.

1249
01:10:00,346 --> 01:10:02,006
IT'S JUST FOR PROTECTION.

1250
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:03,781
AND WHEN I PRESS THIS BUTTON,

1251
01:10:03,849 --> 01:10:06,919
WHATEVER MINE DOES,
YOURS CAN DO THE SAME THING.

1252
01:10:06,986 --> 01:10:08,286
HERE WE GO.

1253
01:10:08,354 --> 01:10:11,064
1...2...3...

1254
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:13,323
[BUZZING]

1255
01:10:13,392 --> 01:10:16,432
[LAUGHS]

1256
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:17,625
HEY, CHARLIE?

1257
01:10:17,696 --> 01:10:18,696
YEAH?

1258
01:10:18,764 --> 01:10:19,904
STOP HITTIN' YOURSELF
IN THE HEAD.

1259
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:23,095
AH, CHARLIE,
ARE YOU TICKLISH?

1260
01:10:23,169 --> 01:10:25,869
[BOTH LAUGH]

1261
01:10:25,938 --> 01:10:27,968
OK!

1262
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,040
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

1263
01:10:30,109 --> 01:10:32,279
THE WINDUP AND THE PITCH!

1264
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,063
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?!

1265
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:47,655
THE NOBEL PRIZE!

1266
01:10:47,726 --> 01:10:49,656
NO...IT MEANS
I CAN MAKE AMENDS

1267
01:10:49,728 --> 01:10:52,158
FOR ALL THE DAMAGE
I'VE DONE.

1268
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:54,501
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1269
01:10:54,567 --> 01:10:56,667
WELL, WITH WHAT
WE JUST DISCOVERED,

1270
01:10:56,735 --> 01:10:59,165
I FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO HELP NORTHERN
BEAT RUMSEN.

1271
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:01,108
AND THEN THEY'LL WIN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP,

1272
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:03,113
AND CLAIRE'S DAD
CAN KEEP HIS JOB,

1273
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,605
AND MY FRIENDS'LL
BE HAPPY WITH ME
AGAIN,

1274
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:09,108
AND MAYBE...
CLAIRE MIGHT
LIKE ME AGAIN, TOO.

1275
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:10,621
A LITTLE.

1276
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:11,783
MAYBE.

1277
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:12,950
ALL I KNOW IS

1278
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:15,118
IS THAT I'VE LET
EVERYBODY DOWN,

1279
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:17,117
AND IF I GET A CHANCE
TO MAKE IT RIGHT,

1280
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,389
I GOTTA TAKE IT!

1281
01:11:18,457 --> 01:11:20,387
WELL, WAIT,
WAIT A SECOND.

1282
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:21,629
FIRST OF ALL...

1283
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,634
YOU HAVEN'T
LET ME DOWN.

1284
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,126
YOU SAVED ME!

1285
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:28,397
CHARLIE, I COULD
NEVER HAVE DONE THIS
WITHOUT YOU!

1286
01:11:28,467 --> 01:11:30,397
YOU'RE MORE THAN
MY ASSISTANT.

1287
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:31,739
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

1288
01:11:31,804 --> 01:11:34,144
THANKS, DOC.

1289
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:35,866
BUT I GOTTA GO.

1290
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,360
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

1291
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:00,931
I NEED HELP.

1292
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,300
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

1293
01:12:03,369 --> 01:12:06,299
I FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO HELP THE TEAM TONIGHT,

1294
01:12:06,372 --> 01:12:07,812
KEEP RUMSEN FROM CHEATING,

1295
01:12:07,873 --> 01:12:10,313
GIVE OUR GUYS
A CHANCE TO WIN.

1296
01:12:10,376 --> 01:12:12,336
WHY...SO YOU CAN
LOOK GOOD?

1297
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:15,351
NO. SO NORTHERN
CAN FINALLY BEAT RUMSEN.

1298
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:18,354
SO YOUR DAD
CAN KEEP HIS JOB.

1299
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,617
I'M DOING IT
FOR EVERYBODY.

1300
01:12:21,687 --> 01:12:23,917
DON'T DO US
ANY FAVORS.

1301
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:29,131
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LEAVE US ALONE...

1302
01:12:29,194 --> 01:12:30,564
CHAZ?

1303
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:35,502
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

1304
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:39,635
MY NAME'S NOT CHAZ.

1305
01:12:39,705 --> 01:12:41,035
IT'S CHARLIE.

1306
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,083
CHARLIE BOYLE.

1307
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:51,350
I CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

1308
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:11,166
YEAH!
YEAH!

1309
01:13:11,236 --> 01:13:13,096
Game announcer:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

1310
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:14,612
WELCOME TO NORTHERN ARENA!

1311
01:13:14,673 --> 01:13:15,873
THIS IS BASE OPS.

1312
01:13:15,941 --> 01:13:19,381
I NEED A GO/NO GO
ON OPERATION RACK RUMSEN.

1313
01:13:19,445 --> 01:13:21,445
SKATES IS GO, OPS.

1314
01:13:21,513 --> 01:13:23,453
VIDEO?

1315
01:13:23,515 --> 01:13:24,945
ROGER THAT.

1316
01:13:25,017 --> 01:13:26,277
BLADES?

1317
01:13:26,352 --> 01:13:28,392
I WOULD LIKE IT
TO BE KNOWN

1318
01:13:28,454 --> 01:13:30,394
THAT I AM HERE
UNDER EXTREME PROTEST,

1319
01:13:30,456 --> 01:13:33,616
AND I'M ONLY DOING THIS
SO MY FATHER
DOESN'T WIND UP

1320
01:13:33,692 --> 01:13:35,632
STAGE MANAGING
THE ICE CAPADES.

1321
01:13:35,694 --> 01:13:37,734
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A GO, BLADES.

1322
01:13:37,796 --> 01:13:40,566
SKATES, RUMSEN
BUS SHOULD BE
IN TARGET RANGE...

1323
01:13:40,632 --> 01:13:42,772
NOW.

1324
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,195
ROGER THAT, OPS.

1325
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:48,311
OK, YOU GUYS,
LET'S MOVE OUT!

1326
01:14:28,914 --> 01:14:30,954
VIDEO,
MOVE INTO POSITION.

1327
01:14:33,685 --> 01:14:36,185
VIDEO'S IN PLACE,
OPS.

1328
01:14:36,255 --> 01:14:37,885
ROGER, VIDEO.

1329
01:14:49,501 --> 01:14:50,441
HEY, DEION.

1330
01:14:50,502 --> 01:14:51,442
HEY, CHARLIE.

1331
01:14:51,503 --> 01:14:52,943
HOW'S IT GOING?

1332
01:14:53,005 --> 01:14:54,435
VIDEO'S A GO.

1333
01:14:54,506 --> 01:14:55,636
WHERE'S BLADES?

1334
01:14:55,707 --> 01:14:56,837
RIGHT HERE.

1335
01:14:58,777 --> 01:15:00,177
YOU LOOK GREAT!

1336
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,245
LET'S JUST HOPE
THIS WORKS.

1337
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:09,020
IS IT ME,
OR DID IT JUST
GET COLDER IN HERE?

1338
01:15:12,558 --> 01:15:14,358
MIKE, YOU KNOW
THEY'RE COMIN' AFTER YOU.

1339
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:16,256
FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE,
I'M PULLIN' YOU OUT!

1340
01:15:16,328 --> 01:15:18,358
YOU JUST TRY
AND DO THAT!

1341
01:15:20,365 --> 01:15:22,495
HOUSTON, WE HAVE FACE-OFF!

1342
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:28,111
Game announcer:
AND NOW, THE FACE-OFF

1343
01:15:28,173 --> 01:15:31,113
FOR THE RE-SCHEDULED
CENTRAL CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP

1344
01:15:31,176 --> 01:15:35,506
BETWEEN THE RUMSEN RAIDERS
AND YOUR NORTHERN LIGHTS!

1345
01:15:46,058 --> 01:15:48,388
HOW'S THIS
SUPPOSED TO WORK
AGAIN?

1346
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:51,400
WE'RE GOING TO
CONTROL KEY PLAYERS
ON RUMSEN FROM HERE.

1347
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:53,503
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

1348
01:15:53,565 --> 01:15:56,825
I'VE IMPLANTED
MICROCHIPS IN THE SKATES
OF RYDER, STOKER, CROSS,

1349
01:15:56,902 --> 01:15:59,942
THE 3 MAIN PLAYERS
WHO GIVE UP
THE RUMSEN RACK.

1350
01:16:00,005 --> 01:16:04,075
NOW, EACH MICROCHIP
IS INFUSED WITH
TRILLIONS OF
GRAVITON HALVES,

1351
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:06,112
LIKE THE SUPER BALLS
I SHOWED YOU.

1352
01:16:06,178 --> 01:16:08,848
CORRESPONDING
MICROCHIPS WITH OTHER
GRAVITON HALVES

1353
01:16:08,914 --> 01:16:10,884
WILL BE IN OUR SKATES.

1354
01:16:10,949 --> 01:16:14,989
WHATEVER OUR SKATES DO,
THEIR SKATES WILL BE
FORCED TO DO.

1355
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,415
MONKEY SEE,
MONKEY DO!

1356
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,020
EXACTLY.

1357
01:16:20,092 --> 01:16:21,392
ISN'T THAT...CHEATING?

1358
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,360
WE ONLY NEED TO KEEP
RUMSEN FROM CHEATING.

1359
01:16:23,428 --> 01:16:25,358
OUR GUYS
CAN DO THE REST.

1360
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:28,130
NOW, WHEN THE TIME
COMES, DEION WILL
FLIP THE SWITCH,

1361
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,300
ACTIVATING
THE PARTICLES,
AND WE'RE ON.

1362
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:36,772
AND I HELPED YOU
GET A "C" IN SCIENCE.

1363
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:57,627
YOU SURE DID
A NUMBER
ON THIS LAB.

1364
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,626
WON'T THAT
PROFESSOR GUY
CARE?

1365
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:02,568
NAH. I'LL HAVE IT
BACK TO NORMAL
AFTER THE GAME.

1366
01:17:02,634 --> 01:17:05,574
BESIDES, I'VE ARRANGED
HIS SCHEDULE SO THAT
HE'LL BE GONE ALL DAY.

1367
01:17:05,637 --> 01:17:07,567
AND HE'S NEVER HERE
DURING HOCKEY GAMES.

1368
01:17:07,639 --> 01:17:09,069
WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?

1369
01:17:09,141 --> 01:17:10,581
OK. ALMOST NEVER.

1370
01:17:10,642 --> 01:17:12,582
CHARLIE...THIS HAS GONE
WAY TOO FAR!

1371
01:17:12,644 --> 01:17:15,584
I LOOKED THE OTHER WAY
WHEN YOU ALMOST DESTROYED
THE ACCELERATOR,

1372
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,007
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN.

1373
01:17:17,082 --> 01:17:19,122
I TOLD YOU
I HAD TO DO WHAT
I HAD TO DO.

1374
01:17:19,184 --> 01:17:21,594
NO. THIS HAS GOTTA STOP,
AND IT'S GOTTA STOP
RIGHT NOW.

1375
01:17:21,653 --> 01:17:23,593
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON MY SIDE!

1376
01:17:23,655 --> 01:17:25,585
YOU KNOW
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

1377
01:17:25,657 --> 01:17:27,927
BUT YOU'RE PUTTING
EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE
IN JEOPARDY.

1378
01:17:27,993 --> 01:17:30,093
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
