<i>Mr. Collins, you're here</i>
<i>because your entire class</i>

<i>Mr. Collins has tenure.</i>

1320

<i>an explanation.</i>

1322
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,739

<i>Mr. Collins,</i>
<i>wouldn't it be fair to say</i>

01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:34,368
<i>these children are of</i>
<i>below-average intelligence?</i>

<i>to retake the test.</i>

1328

1330
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,679

<i>flew into the room,</i>

<i>making it impossible</i>
<i>to focus on the test.</i>
