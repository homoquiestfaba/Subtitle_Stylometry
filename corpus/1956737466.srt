Life is cruel, Satoshi.

10
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:50,500

[Sonya grunts]

189
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,517
[man coughs]

190
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:29,987
My teeth. My teeth!

191
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:32,255
Honestly, it's an improvement.

192
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:34,257
Oh, shit!

193
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,693
[groans]

194
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:46,470
[crowd cheering]

195
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:49,706
[crowd chanting] Sonya!

196
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:51,708
Sonya! Sonya!

197
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,443
Sonya! Sonya!

198
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:00,550
He'll be there?

199
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:02,786
If he's not,

200
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:05,322
there's nowhere on Earth
you'll be able to hide from me.

201
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:06,556
Understand?

202
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:17,834
[screams]

203
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:19,669
[panting]

204
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:31,815
Satoshi.

205
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:33,350
Harumi.

206
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,852
[demons snarling]

207
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,220
What is this?

208
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,554
Where am I?

209
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:39,422
[gasps]

210
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:45,529
[yells]

211
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:47,464
[pants]

212
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:52,636
[chuckling] Don't start
without me.

213
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:55,873
Ah!

214
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,942
Fresh meat.

215
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:02,579
[grunting]

216
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:05,950
What in the hell...

217
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:10,487
Close. Netherrealm.

218
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:14,357
[Hanzo grunting]

219
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:17,460
It's no use.

220
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:20,397
You are a prisoner here.

221
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:22,399
[panting]

222
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:24,467
For how long?

223
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:27,604
[laughs maliciously]

224
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:30,540
Forever.

225
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:33,376
Listen.

226
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,846
[indistinct cries and screams]

227
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:40,383
[demon] Ah!

228
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:43,054
Do you hear it?

229
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,722
The symphony of pain.

230
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:49,593
Your voice will soon
join the others,

231
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:54,464
rising up to please
the great Shinnok.

232
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:57,068
Shinnok?

233
00:16:57,134 --> 00:17:00,004
The master of Netherrealm.

234
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,672
There.

235
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:07,844
The only place of reprieve
in this realm.

236
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:12,582
Look on it
and weep. [chuckles]

237
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:21,791
Sharp enough.

238
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:27,064
[Hanzo straining]

239
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:29,867
[grunting in pain]

240
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,138
Calm yourself.

241
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:39,110
Save your energy
for what is about to come.

242
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:40,443
[Hanzo gasps]

243
00:17:42,113 --> 00:17:44,481
[screams and groans]

244
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,549
Now you see,

245
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,486
you feel pain,

246
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:53,157
though you can
no longer perish.

247
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:55,625
We can do this

248
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:59,163
for all eternity.

249
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:02,532
[indistinct muttering]

250
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,336
Huh?

251
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:07,271
What is it you say?

252
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:09,073
[continues muttering]

253
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:13,377
Is that a prayer? [laughs]

254
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:14,577
No.

255
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:18,916
No God can help you here.

256
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:20,885
I need no God!

257
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:23,921
- [grunts]
- [demon groans]

258
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,589
[spits]

259
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:43,606
I will take pleasure
in ripping your flesh

260
00:18:43,673 --> 00:18:45,409
from your bones!

261
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:46,911
[grunting]

262
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:52,016
[roars in pain]

263
00:18:54,852 --> 00:18:57,554
[roaring and grunting]

264
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:19,743
[demon 2] Human,

265
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:22,812
you have made
a big mistake.

266
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:33,057
There are thousands of us,
and only one of you.

267
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,494
[choking]

268
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,528
[demons growling]

269
00:19:39,864 --> 00:19:41,932
[Hanzo] Minus one.

270
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:43,868
[demons growling and snarling]

271
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:47,171
[growling]

272
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:57,281
[squawking]

273
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:20,670
Shinnok!

274
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:24,508
No, Shinnok is...

275
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:25,708
indisposed.

276
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:27,912
Then go fetch him for me.

277
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,712
[man] If only I could.

278
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:31,781
I am Quan Chi,

279
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:33,984
in charge of this realm

280
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:35,752
until the master's return.

281
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:39,756
And who do I have
to thank for ruining my rug?

282
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,225
Hanzo Hasashi.

283
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:45,062
Your reputation precedes you,
Hanzo Hasashi.

284
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:46,897
Welcome. Though,

285
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:50,034
I'm not entirely sure
how you made it here.

286
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:53,237
What is it you want, Hanzo?

287
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:54,872
To return home.

288
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:57,141
To seek my revenge.

289
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,476
Home?

290
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:00,411
[laughs]

291
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,612
You can't return home.

292
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:04,482
[grunts]

293
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:06,550
You will do as I say,

294
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:09,186
or I will flay you alive.

295
00:21:11,155 --> 00:21:12,356
[Hanzo grunts]

296
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,795
Did you think me
defenseless, dog?

297
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:21,398
In my realm no less.

298
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:22,699
[Hanzo groaning]

299
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:24,969
You may be a vengeful spirit,

300
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:28,139
but even they
have their limits.

301
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,907
[Hanzo screaming]

302
00:21:32,243 --> 00:21:34,078
[groaning]

303
00:21:42,286 --> 00:21:46,689
Besides, that's not what
you really want, is it?

304
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,395
Once a generation,
there is a tournament.

305
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:53,796
During that time,

306
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:55,599
the veil is lifted,

307
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:59,769
so that warriors may gather to
fight on behalf of their realm.

308
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:01,704
I can send you there.

309
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:05,708
[pants] Why would
I fight for you?

310
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:09,313
[Quan Chi] Because he will
be in attendance.

311
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,148
[panting]

312
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:15,886
What do you want?

313
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:20,858
[Quan Chi] Good, skilled
and smart. [laughs]

314
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,161
Long ago,

315
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:28,165
my master, Shinnok,
was unjustly imprisoned.

316
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:31,202
This is the key to his release.

317
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:34,238
It's being kept
at the temple of Shang Tsung,

318
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:35,805
the putrid mortal

319
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:38,909
that has the favor
of the emperor of Outworld.

320
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:42,279
The tournament will take place
on his island.

321
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:44,781
Get me that key.

322
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:47,451
Once my master is released,

323
00:22:47,518 --> 00:22:49,653
he can return your family.

324
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:53,624
Even you,
back to the mortal realm.

325
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:56,894
Do we understand
each other, Hanzo?

326
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,432
Hanzo is dead.

327
00:23:01,498 --> 00:23:03,434
Call me Scorpion.

328
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:09,839
[boat horn blows]

329
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:14,378
Hold the boat! I'm coming!

330
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:15,879
[panting]

331
00:23:15,946 --> 00:23:18,015
[grunting]

332
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:22,453
Coming through. I'm co...

333
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,623
Whoa, whoa... [grunts]

334
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:26,857
[Sonya] Hmm.

335
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:31,962
Mmm?

336
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:39,903
[clears throat] Hope no fans saw that.
I'm wearing slip-ons.

337
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:47,044
Lui Kang,
of the White Lotus Society.

338
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:49,713
Johnny Cage,
of the superstar variety,

339
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:51,682
but you probably knew that.

340
00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:53,250
And you are?

341
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:55,586
Not interested.

342
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:58,155
Oh, you will be.
They always are.

343
00:23:58,222 --> 00:24:00,391
So, you guys
in this thing, too?

344
00:24:00,457 --> 00:24:03,594
Yes, I have trained
many years for this moment.

345
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:05,129
Oh, yeah? Listen,

346
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,530
I love acting classes and all,

347
00:24:06,597 --> 00:24:09,033
but they're really
kind of a time suck.

348
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:10,800
You know what I mean?
No? Anyway,

349
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:13,137
my agent said this would
really put me back on the map.

350
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,539
Kind of a back-end-deal-type-of-thing.
Should be fun.

351
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:17,840
[Raiden] We are
approaching the veil.

352
00:24:19,677 --> 00:24:20,810
Who is that? Let me guess.

353
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,913
He's kind of like
our, uh, Merlin.

354
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,682
That is Lord Raiden.

355
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:26,283
Protector of Earthrealm.

356
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,986
Boom! Nailed it.
Wait, Earthrealm?

357
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,721
Did you guys get
a script already or something?

358
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:32,089
Look, I'd love a copy.

359
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:34,224
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

360
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,560
but I am pretty good
at improv. So, uh...

361
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:39,863
Lord Raiden, right?

362
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,998
Good to meet you.

363
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:44,435
So, tell me more
about this veil.

364
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:46,236
The space between realms,

365
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:49,807
to prevent Outworld
from merging with Earthrealm.

366
00:24:49,873 --> 00:24:51,041
Prevented by what?

367
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:52,910
Always the soldier,

368
00:24:52,976 --> 00:24:55,012
evaluating risks.

369
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:59,750
What guards the veil is of less
consequence than why it does so.

370
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:02,052
If Shao Kahn
wins this tournament,

371
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,622
Earth, as you know it,
will cease to exist.

372
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:07,024
Not to fear, Lord Raiden.

373
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,625
I, Johnny Cage,

374
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:11,161
will make sure that
Earthrealm, [softly] so dumb,

375
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:13,130
will be safe from harm.

376
00:25:13,197 --> 00:25:15,032
You have my word on it.

377
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:24,141
Lord Raiden,
these are the champions you gathered?

378
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,410
You doubt my choices?

379
00:25:26,477 --> 00:25:27,945
No, I just meant...

380
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:31,281
You see only what is in front
of you, Lui Kang,

381
00:25:31,348 --> 00:25:33,250
but your eyes deceive you.

382
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:36,320
It is what is inside
that matters.

383
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:37,856
Sonya Blade,

384
00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:40,124
a most formidable warrior.

385
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,493
She has had
to prove herself against many

386
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,897
who thought she was
nothing more than a weak girl.

387
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:49,666
Believe me,
she is anything but.

388
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:53,470
And him? He only seems to be concerned
about himself and material wealth.

389
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:56,073
[muttering angrily]

390
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,574
[Raiden] That will
keep him alive,

391
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:01,044
until he finds something more
to care about.

392
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:03,914
Something greater
than himself to live for.

393
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,749
[Johnny Cage]
Are you kidding me?

394
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:08,152
I paid extra for international,
and I can't even get a signal.

395
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,220
Uh, Raiden, are getting one?

396
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:11,355
[grunts]

397
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:18,429
What in the...

398
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:22,699
[shrieks]

399
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,001
Stay in the vessel.

400
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:26,170
It is under
Lord Raiden's protection.

401
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:28,839
Out there,
there's nothing good.

402
00:26:28,907 --> 00:26:30,941
Oh, right.

403
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,309
Paparazzi.

404
00:26:33,444 --> 00:26:34,611
We've arrived.

405
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,984
Look.

406
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:26,029
That must be the bad guy.

407
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:31,668
One at a time, everybody.
One at a time.

408
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,104
Brought enough
for everyone. Okay.

409
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:35,506
Where'd you guys
put my trailer?

410
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,808
I'd like to freshen up
before we start shooting.

411
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:39,343
Ugh.

412
00:27:42,546 --> 00:27:44,715
He has no idea
what he is doing.

413
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:46,116
Should we tell him?

414
00:27:46,183 --> 00:27:48,920
His journey
is one of discovery.

415
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:51,655
Besides, I find it amusing.

416
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:07,271
Remember our deal, Scorpion.

417
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:13,143
[Johnny Cage panting]

418
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,381
[sighs]

419
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,302
Whoa.

420
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:42,839
[crowd cheering]

421
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,514
[burps]

422
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:52,516
Yeah! Yeah!

423
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:00,992
[grunts]

424
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:02,726
[grunts]

425
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:04,161
[crowd cheering]

426
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:20,110
Be on guard.

427
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:22,512
Shang Tsung
is not to be trusted.

428
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:24,648
Oh, look!
Craft services. Great!

429
00:29:24,715 --> 00:29:26,416
[Sonya sighs]

430
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:42,633
[sniffs] Hey, do you know if
any of this stuff is organic?

431
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:43,935
[snarls]

432
00:29:44,002 --> 00:29:45,769
Just asking. Geez!

433
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:55,245
Now is your chance.

434
00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:02,619
[drums beating]

435
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,863
[all cheering]

436
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:24,541
[Shang Tsung] <i>In the beginning,</i>

437
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:26,743
<i>were the elder Gods.</i>

438

<i>In their wisdom,</i>

439
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:31,448
<i>they created a tournament</i>

440
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:36,219
<i>to safeguard each realm

441
00:30:36,286 --> 00:30:37,989
<i>Once a generation,</i>

442
00:30:38,056 --> 00:30:40,457
<i>the finest warriors

443
00:30:40,524 --> 00:30:43,427
<i>to decide the fate

00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:46,030
<i>The winner will be

447
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:54,138

448

welcome you

00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:15,659
- [crowd cheering]
- [man] Mortal Kombat!

455
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:38,883
[grunting]

456
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:03,673
Now,

457
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,910
as host of this tournament,

458
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:10,148
I think it only fitting that
I provide you with some...

459
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:12,415
entertainment. [claps]

460
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,758
Kano.

461
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:26,663
[grunts]

462
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,968
Jax! [grunts]

463
00:32:33,336 --> 00:32:35,405
[cheering]

464
00:32:41,245 --> 00:32:42,646
Jax! [grunts]

465
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:45,950
Listen, you son of a bitch,

466
00:32:46,017 --> 00:32:48,718
you better open this,
whatever it is,

467
00:32:48,785 --> 00:32:52,489
or I'm gonna use your ass as
my own personal punching bag.

468
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:54,091
Oh, that is so hot.

469
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:56,593
[Sonya grunting]

470
00:32:58,229 --> 00:33:00,397
- [Jax] Princess.
- Asshole.

471
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:02,133
I told you to wait for me.

472
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,500
I got excited.

473
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:06,270
You got caught
by that idiot Kano.

474
00:33:06,336 --> 00:33:09,273
[sighs] Yeah, that too.

475
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:13,743
Unless you want me to rip that
pencil-thin mustache off your face,

476
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,081
I think it's best
you let me go, old man.

477
00:33:17,148 --> 00:33:18,682
Absolutely.

478
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:21,319
You are free
to leave at any time.

479
00:33:21,384 --> 00:33:23,720
The doorway is right there.

480
00:33:25,522 --> 00:33:26,790
Of course,

481
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:29,227
you have to get past
my champion.

482
00:33:29,293 --> 00:33:31,595
[drums beating]

483
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:35,765
[chanting] Goro! Goro! Goro!

484
00:33:36,901 --> 00:33:39,904
[all chanting]
Goro! Goro! Goro!

485
00:33:44,507 --> 00:33:46,944
[chanting continues]

486
00:33:52,415 --> 00:33:54,852
[chanting continues]

487
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:04,128
What the hell?

488
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:07,430
[crowd cheering]

489
00:34:10,902 --> 00:34:11,936
[gasps]

490
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:20,177
[Goro growls]

491
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,048
Jax! No!

492
00:34:24,115 --> 00:34:26,483
Relax, kid. I've got this.

493
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:28,252
All right, ugly.

494
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:29,854
You wanna dance?

495
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:31,255
Let's dance.

496
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:33,590
[grunts]

497
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:35,192
[gasps]

498
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:36,559

499
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:40,830
[chuckles]

500
00:34:43,134 --> 00:34:44,434
[grunts]

501
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:57,781
[Raiden] I wouldn't.

502
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:02,719
Let me guess.

503
00:35:02,786 --> 00:35:06,489
Quan Chi promised you life
if you would do his bidding.

504
00:35:06,924 --> 00:35:09,226
Ah... No.

505
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:12,063
Not you. Someone else.

506
00:35:12,129 --> 00:35:13,830
Someone you lost.

507
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:15,866
Someone you care about.

508
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:19,070
Do you think Quan Chi
is a man to be trusted?

509
00:35:19,136 --> 00:35:21,372
[Scorpion]
What choice do I have?

510
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:23,274
We all have choices.

511
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:24,774
Live in the past,

512
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:27,711
or live for the future.

513
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:30,613
The key won't
solve your problems.

514
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,218
It will, however,
create new ones.

515
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:35,618
[Scorpion] And my revenge?

516
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:39,190
Revenge is too heavy
a burden to carry.

517
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:40,824
You are a free man.

518
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,994
It's time you start
acting like it.

519
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:55,172
[Jax groans]

520
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,074
[Jax panting]

521
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,344
- [crowd cheering]
- [man laughing]

522
00:36:00,411 --> 00:36:02,712
[indistinct shouting]

523
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:04,647
[Jax groaning]

524
00:36:14,557 --> 00:36:16,626
[groans]

525
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:23,633
[grunts]

526
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:29,006
Really, Goro, you shouldn't
play with your food.

527
00:36:29,073 --> 00:36:30,908
[Goro growls]

528
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:38,848
[groaning, screaming]

529
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,019
[bones snapping]

530
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,788
[laughs]

531
00:36:44,855 --> 00:36:47,158
[Jax screaming]

532
00:36:47,224 --> 00:36:49,026
Stop it! You'll kill him.

533
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:51,095
That's the idea.

534
00:36:51,162 --> 00:36:52,496
Finish him.

535
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:54,498
[Jax screaming]

536
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:56,566
[bones snapping]

537
00:36:58,169 --> 00:36:59,636
[screams]

538
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:01,038
[all cheering]

539
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:02,006
No!

540
00:37:02,073 --> 00:37:03,274
[all cheering]

541
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,209
Yeah!

542
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,485
Pfft! Fake.

543
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:16,153
These special effects suck.

544
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:19,924
[Goro growls]

545
00:37:20,558 --> 00:37:21,758
[Raiden] Enough!

546
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,693
- [electricity crackling]
- [Goro grunts]

547
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:35,072
[Shang Tsung] You forget
yourself, Lord Raiden.

548
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:37,707
You are not to interfere
in the tournament.

549
00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:40,743
I was unaware
the tournament had begun.

550
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:44,814
[electricity crackling]

551
00:37:45,648 --> 00:37:47,318
[Goro growls and grunts]

552
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:55,625
We are here for Mortal Kombat,

553
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:58,162
not your barbarism.

554
00:37:59,563 --> 00:38:01,132
As you wish.

555
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:02,166
Kano!

556
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:07,371
[Sonya] Jax!

557
00:38:07,438 --> 00:38:09,739
Hold on! I'm coming for you!

558
00:38:09,806 --> 00:38:11,108
You hear me?

559
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:14,378
No matter what!
I'm coming for you!

560
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:16,547
Wow! She's great.

561
00:38:16,614 --> 00:38:19,383
[stutters] I mean,
that is some serious method acting there.

562
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,484
Am I right?

563
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:23,087
[snarls]

564
00:38:23,154 --> 00:38:26,756
I can see we're all anxious
to get started.

565
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:28,825
Good.

566
00:38:28,893 --> 00:38:31,128
I have determined
your opponents

567
00:38:31,195 --> 00:38:33,931
and where on the island
you will fight.

568
00:38:33,998 --> 00:38:36,433
Let Mortal Kombat begin!

569
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,582
Uh... Okay.

570
00:38:51,649 --> 00:38:52,883
That was weird.

571
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,252
Did someone slip me something?

572
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:56,753
Or... Holy shit!

573
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:03,027
Hello? Sonya?

574
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,896
Lord Reagan? Radar?
Whatever your name is.

575
00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:10,100
This thing better not
go straight to video.

576
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:28,118
Gunpowder?

577
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:30,354
Must be some
sort of old fortress.

578
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:44,734
Bingo.

579
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:56,080
Hard as a fossil.

580
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:57,615
No craft services, no trailers.

581
00:39:57,681 --> 00:40:00,017
My agent is gonna hear
about this when I get home.

582
00:40:02,953 --> 00:40:05,755
- Sheesh.
- [clanking]

583
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:08,158
Hello?

584
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:10,194
I should at least get
a per diem.

585
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:12,896
[growls menacingly]

586
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:14,831
Oh, hey, how's it goin'?

587
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:17,767
That... That is
one hell of a costume.

588
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,970
- [Baraka growling]
- [grunting]

589
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:24,841
[grunts] Uh... Are we live?

590
00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:27,077
[stutters] Like,
you wanna do this now?

591
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,848
[roaring]

592
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:34,018
Whoa, buddy, pro-tip.

593
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:36,053
Uh, next time, pop a few mints.

594
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:39,890
[grunts, groans]

595
00:40:41,492 --> 00:40:43,494
Whoa! Whoa! Go easy!

596
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,995
We haven't even rehearsed.

597
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:48,332
Hey, asshole!

598
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:51,535
- That was custom! Dick.
- [growls]

599
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:55,239
[grunting]

600
00:40:58,808 --> 00:40:59,943
[Baraka snarls]

601
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,844
And barrel.

602
00:41:03,681 --> 00:41:05,082
[grunting]

603
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:13,590
[grunting]

604
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:18,929
[groans]

605
00:41:18,996 --> 00:41:20,998
- [Baraka growling]
- [grunts]

606
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:32,910
[panting]

607
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:34,511
[grunts]

608
00:41:57,134 --> 00:41:58,602
Eat me, buttercup.

609
00:42:05,642 --> 00:42:08,178
[grunts, panting]

610
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:16,186
Toasty.

611
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:30,667
[ominous music playing]

612
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,073
- [thuds]
- [grunts]

613
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:44,381
[grunting]

614
00:42:45,516 --> 00:42:46,383
[grunts]

615
00:42:47,886 --> 00:42:49,486
[breathing heavily]

616
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:52,389
[panting]

617
00:42:53,056 --> 00:42:54,758
[grunting]

618
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:57,694
Come on! Face me like a man!

619
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:04,234
[panting]

620
00:43:06,737 --> 00:43:08,138
[sighs]

[Sonya grunts]

623
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,621
[Reptile snarls]

624
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:27,157
All right, asshole.
Let's see what you've got.

625
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:29,526
[grunts]

626
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,501
[grunting]

627
00:43:41,873 --> 00:43:42,739
[growls]

628
00:43:52,649 --> 00:43:53,750
[Sonya grunts]

629
00:43:56,888 --> 00:43:58,622
- [Sonya grunts]
- [Reptile snarls]

630
00:44:03,427 --> 00:44:04,428
[snarls]

631
00:44:05,162 --> 00:44:07,331
[both grunting]

632
00:44:14,104 --> 00:44:16,039
[Sonya yells]

633
00:44:16,106 --> 00:44:18,141
[panting]

634
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,046
[Sonya grunts]

635
00:44:26,049 --> 00:44:27,584
[groaning]

636
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:28,819
[Reptile choking]

637
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:31,788
Not so fun now, is it,
you cold-blooded bastard?

638
00:44:32,656 --> 00:44:33,925
[Sonya straining]

639
00:44:33,992 --> 00:44:35,425
Heads up!

640
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:43,600
Fuck with the Blade,
you're gonna get cut. [kisses]

641
00:44:47,638 --> 00:44:48,539
[panting]

642
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:50,741
[grunts]

643
00:44:57,949 --> 00:45:00,050
[straining, grunts]

644
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:05,622
- [Scorpion grunting]
- [groans]

645
00:45:09,994 --> 00:45:12,663
You move like the Shirai Ryu.

646
00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:14,331
But they're dead.

647
00:45:14,398 --> 00:45:16,633
Who are you? What do you want?

648
00:45:17,534 --> 00:45:18,669
Revenge!

649
00:45:23,007 --> 00:45:25,342
Tell me, Lin Kuei scum,

650
00:45:25,409 --> 00:45:27,210
where is Sub-Zero?

651
00:45:27,277 --> 00:45:29,746
[choking, spits]

652
00:45:31,682 --> 00:45:35,252
Die, knowing I will kill
every last member

653
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:38,188
of the Lin Kuei on this island.

654
00:45:38,255 --> 00:45:41,692
Every last one.

655
00:45:41,758 --> 00:45:43,126
[groans]

656
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,271
[both grunting]

657
00:46:00,711 --> 00:46:03,614
You are Raiden's
chosen one. [chuckles]

658
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,516
No wonder your realm
has lost so many tournaments.

659
00:46:09,453 --> 00:46:10,320
[grunts]

660
00:46:11,822 --> 00:46:13,523
[Kitana grunting]

661
00:46:14,257 --> 00:46:16,159
[Kitana cries out]

662
00:46:16,226 --> 00:46:17,794
I do not wish to hurt you.

663
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:19,596
Spare me your pity.

664
00:46:20,163 --> 00:46:21,698
[grunts]

665
00:46:21,765 --> 00:46:23,868
[both grunt]

666
00:46:24,801 --> 00:46:25,702
[Kitana yells]

667
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:29,740
[yells]

668
00:46:32,043 --> 00:46:34,478
[Lui Kang] Do not get up.

669
00:46:34,544 --> 00:46:37,514
I take no pleasure in hurting
such a worthy foe.

670
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:40,283
But, know this.
I will do whatever it takes

671
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:42,819
to defend Earthrealm,
and win this tournament.

672
00:46:44,454 --> 00:46:46,289
[Kitana] Then you are a fool.

673
00:46:46,356 --> 00:46:48,792
Shao Kahn cannot be defeated.

674
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,328
He will take your world,
and you will bow your knee

675
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:53,031
like countless others
before you.

676
00:46:53,097 --> 00:46:57,367
I promise you, I will never bow
before that madman.

677
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:01,471
I yield.

678
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:07,344
What makes you so sure
you will win?

679
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:10,982
Because I have something
no one in Outworld has.

680
00:47:11,049 --> 00:47:13,283
- What?
- Hope.

681
00:47:30,734 --> 00:47:32,736
[Shang Tsung]
Impressive, Raiden.

682
00:47:32,803 --> 00:47:35,639
Your warriors have made it
further than I would have thought.

683
00:47:35,706 --> 00:47:39,309
They are strong in spirit,
Shang Tsung.

684
00:47:39,376 --> 00:47:41,445
You will not win today.

685
00:47:41,511 --> 00:47:45,083
I have heard
such promises before.

686
00:47:45,149 --> 00:47:47,284
Thankfully, after Goro kills

687
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,820
whomever makes it
to the final round,

688
00:47:49,887 --> 00:47:52,622
I will not have to
hear them again.

689
00:47:52,689 --> 00:47:56,894
And, Quan Chi,
your warrior from Netherrealm,

690
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:59,197
he is proving to be
quite formidable.

691
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:01,398
For the glory of Outworld,

692
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:04,634
I serve at the pleasure
of Shao Kahn.

693
00:48:05,903 --> 00:48:07,004
Indeed.

694
00:48:07,071 --> 00:48:08,805
You won't succeed.

695
00:48:08,873 --> 00:48:11,241
No matter how many foes
you put between

696
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:13,643
the Earthrealm fighters
and your champion,

697
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,545
they will make it to the end.

698
00:48:15,612 --> 00:48:19,516
Oh? I'm glad you feel that way.

699
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:22,819
Surely you know
of the Black Dragon.

700
00:48:22,887 --> 00:48:25,555
It seems that several have
made it onto the island

701
00:48:25,622 --> 00:48:28,425
with orders to kill
your Earthrealm friends.

702
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:31,062
How dare you?

703
00:48:31,129 --> 00:48:34,132
Are you accusing me
of something, Lord Raiden?

704
00:48:34,198 --> 00:48:35,432
You brought them here

705
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:37,034
to interfere
with the tournament!

706
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:39,369
And break the rules?

707
00:48:39,436 --> 00:48:41,705
Even I am not so bold
as to anger

708
00:48:41,772 --> 00:48:44,441
the elder Gods in such a way.

709
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:47,245
You will not succeed,
Shang Tsung.

710
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:50,280
We'll know soon enough,
won't we?

711
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,898
[sighs] What I wouldn't give
for a frozen margarita.

712
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:12,803
- [Sonya] Hey!
- [yelps]

713
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,038
Really?

714
00:49:14,105 --> 00:49:16,740
I know, look at this shirt.
It's ridiculous.

715
00:49:16,807 --> 00:49:18,642
I'm glad to see you, though.

716
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:20,544
Okay, you won't believe this,

717
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,914
but this isn't
some sort of movie.

718
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,449
This is the real deal. Maybe a snuff
film or something. I don't know.

719
00:49:26,516 --> 00:49:28,418
But I had to fight some, uh...

720
00:49:28,485 --> 00:49:30,154
I don't even know what it was.

721
00:49:30,221 --> 00:49:32,223
I barely got out alive.

722
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,623
I can believe that.

723
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,592
Listen, I'll get you
out of here,

724
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:37,061
but we'll need to
stick together.

725
00:49:37,128 --> 00:49:40,198
First rule of combat
is to secure our position.

726
00:49:40,264 --> 00:49:41,398
Let's find somewhere
to hole up,

727
00:49:41,464 --> 00:49:42,867
and then we can start recon.

728
00:49:42,934 --> 00:49:45,069
Find out where we are,
what we are up against.

729
00:49:45,136 --> 00:49:46,403
[Lui Kang] A sound strategy.

730
00:49:47,138 --> 00:49:48,805
You both made it. Good.

731
00:49:48,873 --> 00:49:50,740
I fear it's only
going to get harder from here.

732
00:49:50,807 --> 00:49:52,944
Whoa. Wait,
what's gonna get harder?

733
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,947
I just fought a walking pair of
teeth on the side of a mountain.

734
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:58,950
I'm not Tom Cruise,
you know. I act.

735
00:49:59,016 --> 00:50:01,651
I leave that stunt shit
for the stunt people.

736
00:50:01,718 --> 00:50:03,855
Listen, sweetheart,
we should get out of here...

737
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:06,224
- [Sonya grunting]
- [groaning] Oh, my... dick.

738
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:10,061
Fuckballs, no one touches me
without permission, you got it?

739
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:11,229
Got it.

740
00:50:11,295 --> 00:50:12,395
You said you knew
where we were?

741
00:50:12,462 --> 00:50:13,563
I do.

742
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:15,132
But it will be dark soon.

743
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,335
We need to make camp. Rest.

744
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,501
Agreed.

745
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:20,637
[screaming in distance]

746
00:50:22,706 --> 00:50:25,877
No, no. Don't wait for me.
I'm fine.

747
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:28,212
Let me just pee out
some blood first.

748
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:30,380
[grunting in pain]

749
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:32,616
[screaming]

750
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:39,991
[Black Dragon soldier
shivering]

751
00:50:40,057 --> 00:50:42,059
- [bones breaking]
- [Black Dragon soldier groans]

752
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:45,695
What the fuck?

753
00:50:48,598 --> 00:50:51,768
I think I'm
gonna be sick. [retching]

754
00:50:52,836 --> 00:50:54,504
[Johnny coughs, vomits]

755
00:50:54,571 --> 00:50:56,706
Stay behind me.
I'll take care of this.

756
00:50:56,773 --> 00:50:58,608
What is this, 1950?

757
00:50:58,675 --> 00:51:01,611
Step back, Bruce Lee.
Bring it, bitch.

758
00:51:01,678 --> 00:51:04,814
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
everyone just chillax, okay?

759
00:51:04,882 --> 00:51:06,583
No one needs to fight anyone.

760
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:08,252
Especially some guy
that just went psycho

761
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,253
on a bunch of, uh...

762
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,056
Black Dragon. Mercenaries.

763
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:14,591
Assassins. Bad guys.

764
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:16,060
Yeah, those guys.

765
00:51:16,127 --> 00:51:17,361
We have to continue.

766
00:51:17,427 --> 00:51:19,230
Once Mortal Kombat
has been declared,

767
00:51:19,297 --> 00:51:20,298
it must be finished.

768
00:51:20,364 --> 00:51:23,334
Did you declare Mortal Kombat?

769
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:25,002
- Did you?
- Nope.

770
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:27,939
What about you, Mister...

771
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:29,273
Scorpion.

772
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,375
Oh, it's catchy. I like that.

773
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:32,809
Did you declare Mortal Kombat?

774
00:51:33,978 --> 00:51:37,214
Good. Good. Great!
Then no one needs to die.

775
00:51:37,281 --> 00:51:38,715
Sheesh.

776
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:42,153
Now, who's hungry?

777
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:51,228
[Lui Kang] I know you didn't believe
it before, but it's all true.

778
00:51:51,295 --> 00:51:54,432
The elder Gods,
the tournament, everything.

779
00:51:54,497 --> 00:51:58,269
Emperor Shao Kahn has won nine
previous Mortal Kombat tournaments.

780
00:51:58,336 --> 00:51:59,937
If he wins a tenth...

781
00:52:00,972 --> 00:52:01,872
Then what?

782
00:52:01,939 --> 00:52:04,141
[Scorpion] Then you all die.

783
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:06,643
Great. Just great.

784
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:10,714
Yeah. Okay, monsters, magic,
this can't be real.

785
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,582
Somebody must have slipped
something into my drink.

786
00:52:12,649 --> 00:52:15,419
- I'm hallucinating.
- Get a grip, Johnny.

787
00:52:15,485 --> 00:52:17,855
Whatever this is, it's real.

788
00:52:17,922 --> 00:52:20,925
There's no use sitting around
and whining about it.

789
00:52:20,992 --> 00:52:22,625
If what Lui Kang says is true,

790
00:52:22,692 --> 00:52:24,295
then the whole world
is in trouble,

791
00:52:24,362 --> 00:52:26,030
and we have to stop it.

792
00:52:26,696 --> 00:52:28,732
If I can get to a radio,

793
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:31,634
a communications array,
I can call in reinforcements.

794
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:35,339
Turn this island
into the next cautionary tale.

795
00:52:35,406 --> 00:52:37,540
[Raiden] If only
it were that easy.

796
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:40,177
- [Lui Kang] Lord Raiden.
- [Scorpion] You.

797
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,146
[Sonya] What do you mean,
"If only it were that easy"?

798
00:52:42,213 --> 00:52:44,748
Do you know
what a Hellfire missile can do?

799
00:52:44,814 --> 00:52:47,784
I'm sure it's very powerful
on Earth.

800
00:52:47,852 --> 00:52:50,955
But we are not on Earth.

801
00:52:51,022 --> 00:52:54,992
This island lives in a place
between realms.

802
00:52:55,059 --> 00:52:57,928
A place set aside specifically
for the tournament.

803
00:52:57,995 --> 00:52:59,964
Uh-huh. Sure. Sounds great.

804
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,967
So, if what Lui Kang
says is true,

805
00:53:03,034 --> 00:53:06,370
then you're really
some sort of God, right?

806
00:53:06,437 --> 00:53:08,372
I have been given many names.

807
00:53:08,439 --> 00:53:09,572
Well, shoot, Buddha!

808
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:11,208
Snap your fingers. Get us home!

809
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:13,978
I'm done with psycho monsters
and bad food.

810
00:53:14,045 --> 00:53:16,013
And by the way,
I'll never complain

811
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,681
about doing a sequel again
in my life.

812
00:53:18,748 --> 00:53:21,118
He cannot.
Lord Raiden is forbidden

813
00:53:21,185 --> 00:53:23,220
from interfering
in the tournament.

814
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:25,356
It is a bargain he made
to save Earthrealm

815
00:53:25,423 --> 00:53:27,224
from being taken over eons ago.

816
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,060
Well, that's insane.

817
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:31,495
The fate of the world
is being decided

818
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:33,497
by some sort of
karate tournament?

819
00:53:33,563 --> 00:53:34,899
Are you kidding me?

820
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:38,035
You are the only hope left
for Earthrealm.

821
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:42,139
Head toward the temple where
your final battles await...

822
00:53:42,206 --> 00:53:45,042
and your destinies
will be made clear.

823
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:46,609
But be on guard.

824
00:53:46,676 --> 00:53:48,079
There are others on this island

825
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:51,115
who will try to keep you
from the final round.

826
00:53:55,685 --> 00:53:58,456
Great. So, uh,
we are screwed.

827
00:53:58,522 --> 00:54:01,724
If Lord Raiden believes
we can make it, we can.

828
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:04,661
No, you can't.

829
00:54:04,727 --> 00:54:07,697
Well, you seem very fun,
Mr. Scorpion.

830
00:54:07,764 --> 00:54:09,599
[Scorpion]
Shang Tsung has the numbers.

831
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:12,903
He has that... monster.

832
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:16,840
Go. Hide in the jungle
until it is over.

833
00:54:16,907 --> 00:54:18,808
And let Earth be destroyed?

834
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:21,345
Sorry, pal.
I took an oath to defend it,

835
00:54:21,412 --> 00:54:22,745
no matter the odds.

836
00:54:22,812 --> 00:54:24,348
He would not understand, Sonya.

837
00:54:24,415 --> 00:54:26,050
Someone such as him,

838
00:54:26,117 --> 00:54:28,352
has never known anything
worth dying for.

839
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,655
You cannot survive.

840
00:54:32,722 --> 00:54:36,726
My will is strong.
My destiny is my own.

841
00:54:39,063 --> 00:54:42,466
You are as naive,
as you are doomed.

842
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:44,368
I have waited here too long.

843
00:54:44,435 --> 00:54:49,306
Know that the next time
we meet, it will not end well.

844
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,775
Well, that was cheery.

845
00:54:52,842 --> 00:54:54,378
Shut up, botox.

846
00:54:54,445 --> 00:54:56,881
I'm just sayin', he really
killed the vibe around here.

847
00:54:56,947 --> 00:54:58,715
I was just... [groaning]

848
00:54:59,984 --> 00:55:02,486
Shutting up. Yep.
[continues groaning]

849
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:03,720
Scorpion was right about
one thing,

850
00:55:03,786 --> 00:55:05,523
we've rested long enough.

851
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:06,991
We must continue on.

852
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:13,397
I've found them.

853
00:55:14,198 --> 00:55:15,065
[grunts]

854
00:55:23,207 --> 00:55:26,143
[Johnny] So, we're here,
now what?

855
00:55:32,682 --> 00:55:35,085
Oh, great. This is fair.

856
00:55:35,152 --> 00:55:37,488
The rules state
that it must be single combat.

857
00:55:37,555 --> 00:55:39,722
[Kano] These lads aren't here
for the tournament.

858
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:41,926
They've been paid to kill you.

859
00:55:41,992 --> 00:55:46,597
Hello, love.
Nice to see you again. Mwah.

860
00:55:46,664 --> 00:55:49,633
Why don't you come over here
and I'll give you a hug?

861
00:55:49,699 --> 00:55:51,969
Well, you'd do a better job
than Jax.

862
00:55:57,675 --> 00:55:59,109
I guess Raiden was wrong.

863
00:55:59,176 --> 00:56:01,345
- Oh, you think?
- No, stay together.

864
00:56:01,412 --> 00:56:03,414
We'll survive. We have to.

865
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,915
Yeah, we better.

866
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:07,184
I need to make it home,
so I can kill my agent.

867
00:56:15,725 --> 00:56:17,827
- Be ready.
- For what?

868
00:56:17,895 --> 00:56:20,130
- [gun cocking]
- [groans]

869
00:56:21,764 --> 00:56:23,033
Aah!

870
00:56:26,403 --> 00:56:27,737
[groans]

871
00:56:51,028 --> 00:56:52,863
[all grunting, groaning]

872
00:56:58,102 --> 00:57:00,237
You see? I knew he liked us.

873
00:57:05,442 --> 00:57:06,776
[Sonya grunts]

874
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:08,879
[Johnny grunts]

875
00:57:08,946 --> 00:57:10,514
- [all grunting]
- [Sonya] Stay down!

876
00:57:10,581 --> 00:57:13,917
- I know how to fight...
- [Sonya grunts, yells]

877
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,055
[all groaning]

878
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,293
Sure you do. Just stay down.

879
00:57:24,928 --> 00:57:26,829
Oh, man, is she hot!

880
00:57:26,897 --> 00:57:29,300
[grunting]

881
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:30,234
[yells]

882
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,438
[guns cocking]

883
00:57:35,973 --> 00:57:39,209
[muffled heartbeats]

884
00:57:39,276 --> 00:57:40,344
[gun clicks]

885
00:57:40,411 --> 00:57:42,012
[muffled gunshots]

886
00:57:45,249 --> 00:57:47,251
[Lui Kang grunting rapidly]

887
00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:54,858

[Lui Kang grunting]

[Black Dragon soldier groans]

891
00:58:06,337 --> 00:58:08,372
[groaning]

892
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,607
[Lui Kang yells]

893
00:58:12,009 --> 00:58:13,277
[Lui Kang grunts]

894
00:58:14,844 --> 00:58:16,513
[all grunting]

895
00:58:19,183 --> 00:58:20,584
[soldiers straining]

896
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,420
[grunts]

897
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:26,623
Down!

898
00:58:28,692 --> 00:58:30,060
[grunting]

899
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:33,464
[Johnny gasps]

900
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,065
[laughing wickedly]

901
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:38,135
Huh? What gives?

902
00:58:38,202 --> 00:58:41,004
You dishonor this tournament.

903
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:42,606
- [Sub-Zero grunts]
- [Kano screams]

904
00:58:49,546 --> 00:58:50,414
[Sub-Zero groans]

905
00:58:54,084 --> 00:58:56,220
You will die for what you did!

906
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,159
[grunts]

907
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:14,271

[yells]

913
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:37,428
[Scorpion] That's for my clan!

914
00:59:38,262 --> 00:59:40,564

Partner?

925
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:23,440
Raiden said your
destiny would be clear.

926
01:00:23,507 --> 01:00:25,108
So, there she is.

927
01:00:25,175 --> 01:00:28,545
You know what, I guess I don't
mind having my balls crushed.

928

By her, I mean.

929
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:32,382

[Quan Chi] I'm disappointed.

932
01:00:51,101 --> 01:00:53,437
I brought you here
for one purpose.

933
01:00:54,271 --> 01:00:56,807
And you have failed me.

934
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:59,443
You're as weak
as your wife was.

935
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:01,545
As your child.

936
01:01:02,947 --> 01:01:04,916
Yes, you fool.

937
01:01:04,983 --> 01:01:08,085
It wasn't Sub-Zero at all.

938

do as I wanted.</i>

942
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:24,101
You are strong, Scorpion.

943
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:26,837
But not immortal.

944
01:01:26,905 --> 01:01:29,039
I think I'll leave you here.

945
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:31,842
Just like I left your son.

946
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:34,177

Ah, I'm impressed, Raiden.

969

You were right.

970
01:02:53,992 --> 01:02:55,893
He has great spirit.

And even greater skill.

Yield, and Shao Kahn
will grant you mercy.

got you to betray your world?

will be complete.

1097
01:08:54,751 --> 01:08:58,055
It's too bad you won't live
long enough to see it.

1098
01:08:58,122 --> 01:08:59,156
[groaning]

1099
01:08:59,223 --> 01:09:01,225
Finish him.

1100
01:09:01,292 --> 01:09:02,759
[Lui Kang groaning]

1101
01:09:04,728 --> 01:09:06,931
[Lui Kang straining]

1102
01:09:06,998 --> 01:09:08,832
- [Lui Kang groaning]
- [Goro laughing]

1103
01:09:10,434 --> 01:09:12,669
Does it hurt?

1104
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:14,238
[Lui Kang screams]

1105
01:09:15,272 --> 01:09:16,806
[grunting]

1106
01:09:16,874 --> 01:09:19,076
[Lui Kang screaming]

1107
01:09:22,947 --> 01:09:26,984
Soon, your weak species
will be no more.

1108
01:09:28,352 --> 01:09:29,887
[Goro grunts]

1109
01:09:40,364 --> 01:09:41,866
[groans]

1110
01:09:47,038 --> 01:09:48,272
Who dares?

1111
01:09:52,143 --> 01:09:53,010
Scorpion.

1112
01:09:56,047 --> 01:09:57,314
Impossible.

1113
01:09:57,381 --> 01:10:01,551
It would seem I underestimated
your champion, Quan Chi.

1114
01:10:02,953 --> 01:10:05,789
You are Scorpion
of Netherrealm, yes?

1115
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:09,692
You have killed Goro.

1116
01:10:09,759 --> 01:10:12,430
Thus you must take
your rightful place

1117
01:10:12,496 --> 01:10:14,165
as the champion of Outworld.

1118
01:10:14,231 --> 01:10:17,535
I want nothing to do
with your game.

1119
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,803
I've come for him.

1120
01:10:20,504 --> 01:10:22,239
[Shang Tsung laughs]

1121
01:10:22,306 --> 01:10:23,673
Interesting.

1122
01:10:24,442 --> 01:10:26,110
Defeat Lui Kang,

1123
01:10:26,177 --> 01:10:29,712
and you can have Quan Chi
to do with as you wish.

1124
01:10:29,779 --> 01:10:31,449
Defeat Lui Kang,

1125
01:10:31,515 --> 01:10:35,785
and my emperor will give you
all that you dream of.

1126
01:10:36,786 --> 01:10:39,023
Vengeance is not the way,
Scorpion.

1127
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:40,524
Of course it is,

1128
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:41,892
and it's yours.

1129
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:44,228
All you have to do

1130
01:10:45,129 --> 01:10:46,263
is kill him.

1131
01:10:51,668 --> 01:10:53,736
[Lui Kang panting]

1132
01:11:02,113 --> 01:11:03,080
[exhales]

1133
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:05,149
[Shang Tsung] Good.

1134
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:07,284
Good.

1135
01:11:07,351 --> 01:11:10,687
What choice did he
really have, Lord Raiden?

1136
01:11:11,889 --> 01:11:14,291
There's always
another choice.

1137
01:11:20,663 --> 01:11:22,699
Now. Fight.

1138
01:11:28,906 --> 01:11:31,909
[grunts] What are you doing?

1139
01:11:31,976 --> 01:11:34,245
[Scorpion]
Living for the future.

1140
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:36,713
- Give me the key.
- [Shang Tsung grunts]

1141
01:11:39,183 --> 01:11:40,351
You fool.

1142
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:42,219
Shao Kahn will hear about this

1143
01:11:42,286 --> 01:11:45,089
- and kill you.
- I'm already dead.

1144
01:11:45,156 --> 01:11:46,490
Lui Kang.

1145
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:48,926
- I yield.
- No. [groans]

1146
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,196
Then the tournament
is finished.

1147
01:11:52,263 --> 01:11:53,964
Outworld has lost.

1148
01:11:54,031 --> 01:11:56,400
Earthrealm is safe.

1149
01:11:56,467 --> 01:11:57,334
[grunts]

1150
01:11:58,335 --> 01:12:01,005
I will kill you all.

1151
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:03,307
The tournament is over,
Shang Tsung.

1152
01:12:03,374 --> 01:12:07,810
I am no longer bound
by rules of non-interference.

1153
01:12:07,878 --> 01:12:10,314
Return to your Emperor.

1154
01:12:10,381 --> 01:12:11,848
Tell him of your failure.

1155
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:14,885
You have made a mistake,
Lord Raiden.

1156
01:12:14,952 --> 01:12:18,622
Emperor Shao Kahn
will have his revenge.

1157
01:12:18,688 --> 01:12:19,924
I'm counting on it.

1158
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:22,126
No.

1159
01:12:24,727 --> 01:12:26,497
Without Shang Tsung's power,

1160
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:27,865
the island will collapse.

1161
01:12:27,932 --> 01:12:29,333
We must go.

1162
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,002
What about Scorpion?

1163
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:33,803
His path lies elsewhere.

1164
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:35,072
- But...
- Now.

1165
01:12:37,575 --> 01:12:39,742
I knew you would survive.

1166
01:12:39,809 --> 01:12:42,513
I chose you for a reason.

1167
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,114
Give me the key

1168
01:12:44,181 --> 01:12:47,918
and we can leave this place
before it is destroyed.

1169
01:12:47,985 --> 01:12:49,587
[Scorpion] Come take it.

1170
01:12:49,653 --> 01:12:51,889
Like you did my family.

1171
01:12:53,591 --> 01:12:56,193
Very well. But please,

1172
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:59,829
put up more of a fight
than your wife did.

1173
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:02,700
[Scorpion screams]

1174
01:13:02,765 --> 01:13:03,934
[both grunt]

1175
01:13:04,868 --> 01:13:06,403
[Scorpion grunting]

1176
01:13:09,772 --> 01:13:10,975
[Quan Chi grunting]

1177
01:13:13,711 --> 01:13:15,379
[Quan Chi grunting]

1178
01:13:16,614 --> 01:13:17,948
[Scorpion groans]

1179
01:13:20,985 --> 01:13:24,722
I'm going to finish the job
my demons couldn't.

1180
01:13:24,787 --> 01:13:26,156
Die,

1181
01:13:26,223 --> 01:13:28,791
- you wretched vermin.
- [Scorpion gasping]

1182
01:13:28,859 --> 01:13:30,327
[Scorpion groaning]

1183
01:13:31,462 --> 01:13:32,329
[Scorpion grunts]

1184
01:13:32,396 --> 01:13:33,830
[bone cracking]

1185
01:13:36,033 --> 01:13:39,169
[panting] It's time to die.

1186
01:13:40,571 --> 01:13:42,640
Indeed. [growls]

1187
01:13:42,706 --> 01:13:44,341
[both grunting]

1188
01:13:47,978 --> 01:13:50,114
[grunting, roars]

1189
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:56,819
[distant explosion]

1190
01:13:58,722 --> 01:13:59,723
[Lui Kang grunts]

1191
01:13:59,789 --> 01:14:02,825
Lui, Lord Randy. Need a lift?

1192
01:14:07,965 --> 01:14:09,033
[grunting]

1193
01:14:12,036 --> 01:14:13,304
[Scorpion grunting]

1194
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:18,609
[Scorpion roars]

1195
01:14:18,676 --> 01:14:19,842
[grunting]

1196
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:21,278
[bone crunching]

1197
01:14:21,345 --> 01:14:22,880
[groaning]

1198
01:14:22,946 --> 01:14:24,915
[both grunting]

1199
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,028
[Scorpion growling]

1200
01:14:38,696 --> 01:14:40,197
[roaring]

1201
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:42,599
[Scorpion grunts]

1202
01:14:44,468 --> 01:14:45,669
[Quan Chi groaning]

1203
01:14:45,736 --> 01:14:47,271
[grunting]

1204
01:14:58,782 --> 01:15:00,284
[screaming]

1205
01:15:04,555 --> 01:15:06,090
[grunting]

1206
01:15:08,659 --> 01:15:10,594
[Quan Chi screams]

1207
01:15:10,661 --> 01:15:11,995
[Quan Chi groans]

1208
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,601
[bones crunching]

1209
01:15:17,668 --> 01:15:19,236
[screaming]

1210
01:15:19,303 --> 01:15:21,472
- [Scorpion] Get over here.
- [groans]

1211
01:15:26,677 --> 01:15:29,646
My God will avenge me.

1212
01:15:30,581 --> 01:15:32,883
Damn your God.

1213
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:34,318
[groans]

1214
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,995
[screaming]

1215
01:16:12,589 --> 01:16:14,258
So, is that it?

1216
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:16,760
- Did we win?
- For now.

1217
01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:18,996
All right! Yeah!

1218
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,698
Uh... May I?

1219
01:16:25,269 --> 01:16:28,005
[Johnny Cage]
All right, yeah. Mmm.

1220
01:16:28,071 --> 01:16:29,940
Hmm, cinnamon.

1221
01:16:30,841 --> 01:16:32,176
Mmm, yeah, pat me there.

1222
01:16:32,242 --> 01:16:33,878
Doesn't mean I'm gonna
break the hug.

1223
01:16:33,944 --> 01:16:35,479
- That's enough.
- [Johnny] Okay.

1224
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,081
Think she'll ever like me?

1225
01:16:38,148 --> 01:16:40,117
She didn't hit you in the nuts,
did she?

1226
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:43,387
Yes, she did, Jax.
Yes, she did.

1227
01:16:44,755 --> 01:16:46,190
I have failed you.

1228
01:16:46,256 --> 01:16:47,658
I could not defeat Goro.

1229
01:16:48,759 --> 01:16:50,427
If it wasn't for Scorpion...

1230
01:16:50,494 --> 01:16:52,329
Failed? No.

1231
01:16:52,396 --> 01:16:56,834
Your destiny was never
to defeat Goro, Lui Kang.

1232
01:16:56,901 --> 01:16:59,269
It was to defeat Shao Kahn.

1233
01:17:00,604 --> 01:17:01,805
[Shang Tsung groaning]

1234
01:17:01,873 --> 01:17:03,440
[Shao Kahn] You have failed me.

1235
01:17:04,074 --> 01:17:05,944
I'm sorry, Master.

1236
01:17:06,009 --> 01:17:08,078
It was that old fool, Raiden.

1237
01:17:08,145 --> 01:17:10,547
- He...
- [Shao Kahn] Silence!

1238
01:17:10,614 --> 01:17:12,449
Gather our forces.

1239
01:17:12,516 --> 01:17:15,452
It's time to end this game...

1240
01:17:16,253 --> 01:17:18,555
once and for all.

1241
